The book is an introduction to the physical principles of modern semiconductor devices and their advanced 
fabrication technology. It is intended as a text for undergraduate students in applied physics, electrical and 
electronics engineering, and materials science. It can also serve as a reference for graduate students and 
practicing engineers as well as scientists who are not familiar with the subject or need an update on device  
and technology developments.
 
WHAT’S NEW IN THE THIRD EDITION 
r
 35% of the material has been revised or updated. We have added many sections of current 
interest such as CMOS image sensors, FinFET, 3rd generation solar cells, and atomic layer 
deposition. In addition, we have omitted or reduced sections of less important topics to 
maintain the overall book length.
r
 We have expanded the treatment of MOSFET and related devices to two chapters because of 
their importance in electronic applications. We have also expanded the treatment of photonic 
devices to two chapters because of their importance in communication and alternative energy 
sources.
r
 To improve the development of each subject, sections that contain graduate-level mathematics 
or physical concepts have been omitted or moved to the Appendixes,.
 
TOPICAL COVERAGE
r
 Chapter 0 gives a brief historical review of major semiconductor devices and key technology 
developments. The following text is organized in three parts.
r
 Part I, Chapters 1–2, describes the basic properties of semiconductors and their conduction 
processes, with special emphasis on the two most important semiconductors, silicon (Si) and 
gallium arsenide (GaAs). The concepts in Part I , which will be used throughout the book, 
require a background knowledge of modern physics and college calculus.
r
 Part II, Chapters 3–10, discusses the physics and characteristics of all major  semiconductor 
devices. We begin with the p–n junction, the key building block of most semiconductor devices. 
We proceed to bipolar and field-effect devices and then cover microwave, quantum-effect, hot-
electron, and photonic devices.
r
 Part III, Chapters 11–15, deals with processing technology from crystal growth to impurity 
doping. We present the theoretical and practical aspects of the major steps in device fabrication 
with an emphasis on integrated devices.  
Preface
vii

 
KEY FEATURES
Each chapter includes the following features:
r
 The chapter starts with an overview of the topical contents. A list of covered learning goals is 
also provided. 
r
 The third edition contains many worked-out examples that apply basic concepts to  specific 
problems. 
r
 A chapter summary at the end of each chapter summarizes the important concepts and helps 
the student review the content before tackling the homework problems that follow.
r
 The book includes about 250 homework problems. Answers to odd-numbered  problems with 
numerical solutions are provided in Appendix L.
 
COURSE DESIGN OPTIONS
The third edition can provide greater flexibility in course design. The book contains enough material for a 
full-year sequence in device physics and processing technology. Assuming three lectures per week, a two-
semester sequence can cover Chapters 0–7 in the first semester, leaving Chapters 8–15 for the second semester. 
For a three-quarter sequence, the logical breakpoints are Chapters 0–5, Chapters 6–10, and Chapters 11–15.
A two-quarter sequence can cover Chapters 0–5 in the first quarter. The instructor has several options 
for the second quarter. For example, covering Chapters 6, 12, 13, 14 and 15 produces a strong emphasis on 
MOSFET and related process technologies, while covering Chapters 6–10 emphasizes all major devices. For 
a one-quarter course on semiconductor device processing, the instructor can cover Section 0.2 and Chapters 
11–15.
A one-semester course on basic semiconductor physics and devices can cover Chapters 0–7. A one-
semester course on microwave and photonic devices can cover Chapters 0–3, and 7–10. For students with 
some familiarity with semiconductor fundamentals, a one-semester course on MOSFET physics and 
technology can cover Chapters 0, 5, 6, and 11–15. Of course, there are many other course design options 
depending on the teaching schedule and the instructor’s choice of topics.

Introduction
 
0.1 SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES
 
0.2 SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY
 
SUMMARY
As an undergraduate in applied physics, electrical engineering, electronics engineering, or materials science, 
you might ask why you need to study semiconductor devices. The reason is that semiconductor devices are 
the foundation of the electronics industry, which is the largest industry in the world. A basic knowledge of 
semiconductor devices is essential to the understanding of advanced courses in electronics. This knowledge will 
also enable you to contribute to the Information Age, which is based on electronic technology. 
 
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
Four building blocks of semiconductor devices.
r
Eighteen important semiconductor devices and their roles in electronic applications.
r
 Twenty three important semiconductor technologies and their roles in device processing.
r
 Technology trends toward high-density, high-speed, low-power consumption,  
and nonvolatility.
 
0.1 SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES
Figure 1 shows the sales volume of the semiconductor-device–based electronics industry in the past 30 years 
and projects sales to the year 2020. Also shown are the gross world product (GWP) and the sales volumes of the 
automobile, steel, and semiconductor industries.1,2  We note that the electronics industry surpassed the automobile 
industry in 1998. If the current trends continue, in year 2020 the sales volume of the electronics industry will reach 
two trillion dollars and will constitute about 3% of GWP. It is expected that the electronic industry will remain  
the largest industry in the world throughout the 21st century. The semiconductor industry, which is a subset of  
the electronic industry, will surpass the steel industry around 2010 and constitute 25% of the electronics industry  
in 2020.
0.1.1 
Device Building Blocks
Semiconductor devices have been studied for over 135 years.3 To date, there are 18 major devices, with over  
140 device variations related to them.4 All these devices can be constructed from a small number of device  
building blocks.
Figure 2a is the metal-semiconductor interface, which is an intimate contact between a metal and a 
semiconductor. This building block was the first semiconductor device ever studied (in the year 1874). This 
interface can be used as a rectifying contact; that is, the device allows electrical current to flow easily only in one 
direction, or as an ohmic contact, which can pass current in either direction with a negligibly small voltage drop.

Why add a chapter 0 ??

steel industries from 1980 to 2010 and projected to 2020.1,2
We can use this interface to form many useful devices. For example, by using a rectifying contact as the gate* and 
two ohmic contacts as the source and drain, we can form a MESFET (metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor), 
an important microwave device.
The second building block is the p–n junction (Fig. 2b), which is formed between a p-type (with positively 
charged carriers) and an n-type (with negatively charged carriers) semiconductor. The p–n junction is a key 
building block for most semiconductor devices, and p–n junction theory serves as the foundation of the physics 
of semiconductor devices. By combining two p–n junctions, that is, by adding another p-type semiconductor, we 
form the p–n–p bipolar transistor, which was invented in 1947 and had an unprecedented impact on the electronic 
industry. If we combine three p–n junctions to form a p–n–p–n structure, it becomes -a switching device called a 
thyristor.
The third building block (Fig. 2c) is the heterojunction interface, that is, an interface formed between two 
dissimilar semiconductors. For example, we can use gallium arsenide (GaAs) and aluminum arsenide (AlAs) to form 
a heterojunction. Heterojunctions are the key components for high-speed and photonic devices.
Figure 2d shows the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure. The structure can be considered a 
combination of a metal-oxide interface and an oxide-semiconductor interface. By using the MOS structure as 
the gate and two p–n junctions as the source and drain, we can form a MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor). 
The MOSFET is the most important device for advanced integrated circuits, which contains tens of thousands of 
devices per integrated circuit chip.

0.1.2    Major Semiconductor Devices
Some major semiconductor devices are listed in Table 1 in chronological order; those with a superscript b are 
two-terminal devices, and the others are three-terminal or four-terminal devices.3 The earliest systematic study of 
semiconductor devices (metal-semiconductor contacts) is generally attributed to Braun,5 who in 1874 discovered 
that the resistance of contacts between metals and metal sulfides (e.g., copper pyrite) depended on the magnitude 
and polarity of the applied voltage. The electroluminescence phenomenon (for the light-emitting diode) was 
discovered by Round6 in 1907. He observed the generation of yellowish light from a crystal of carborundum when 
he applied a potential of 10 V between two points on the crystal.
In 1947, the point-contact transistor was invented by Bardeen and Brattain.7  This was followed by Shockley’s8 
classic 1949 paper on p–n junctions and bipolar transistors. Figure 3 shows the first transistor. The two point 
contacts at the bottom of the triangular quartz crystal were made from two stripes of gold foil separated by about 
50 μm (1 μm = 10–4 cm) and pressed onto a semiconductor surface. The semiconductor used was germanium. With 
one gold contact forward biased, that is, having positive voltage with respect to the third terminal, and the other 
reverse biased, the transistor action was observed: that is, the input signal was amplified. The bipolar transistor is a 
key semiconductor device and has ushered in the modern electronic era.

Introduction 3

Fig. 3 The first transistor.7 (Photograph courtesy of Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent Co)
In 1952, Ebers9 developed the basic model for the thyristor, which is an extremely versatile switching 
device. The solar cell was developed by Chapin et al.10 in 1954 using a silicon p–n junction. The solar cell is a 
major candidate for obtaining energy from the sun because it can convert sunlight directly to electricity and is 
environmentally benign. In 1957, Kroemer11 proposed the heterojunction bipolar transistor to improve transistor 
performance; this device is potentially one of the fastest semiconductor devices. In 1958, Esaki12 observed negative 
resistance characteristics in a heavily doped p–n junction, which led to the discovery of the tunnel diode. The tunnel 
diode and the associated tunneling phenomenon are important for ohmic contacts and carrier transport through 
thin layers.
The most important device for advanced integrated circuits is the MOSFET, which was reported by Kahng 
and Atalla13 in 1960. Figure 4 shows the first device using a thermally oxidized silicon substrate. The device has 
a gate length of 20 μm and a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm (1 nm = 10–7 cm). The two keyholes are the source 
and drain contacts, and the top elongated area is the aluminum gate evaporated through a metal mask. Although 
present-day MOSFETs have been scaled down to the nanometer regime, the choice of silicon and thermally grown 
silicon dioxide used in the first MOSFET remains the most important combination of materials. The MOSFET 
and its related integrated circuits now constitute about 95% of the semiconductor device market. An ultrasmall 
MOSFET with a gate length of 5 nm has been demonstrated recently.14 This device can serve as the basis for the 
most advanced integrated circuit chips containing over one trillion (>1012) devices.
In 1962, Hall et al.15 first achieved lasing in semiconductors, and in 1963, Kroemer16 and Alferov and 
Kazarinov17 proposed the heterostructure laser. These proposals laid the foundation for modern laser diodes, which 
can be operated continuously at room temperature. Laser diodes have revolutionized optoelectronic technology 
for a wide range of applications, including digital video disks, optical-fiber communication, laser printing, and 
atmospheric–pollution monitoring.
Three important microwave devices were invented or realized over the next three years. The first was the 
transferred-electron diode (TED; also called the Gunn diode) invented by Gunn18 in 1963. The TED is used 
extensively in such millimeter-wave applications as detection systems, remote controls, and microwave test 
instruments. The second device is the IMPATT diode; its operation was first observed by Johnston et al.19 in 
1965. IMPATT diodes can generate the highest continuous wave (CW) power at millimeter-wave frequencies of 
all semiconductor devices. They are used in radar systems and alarm systems. The third device is the MESFET, 
invented by Mead20 in 1966, which is a key device for monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC).
4 Semiconductors

Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent Co)
Another important semiconductor memory device was invented by Kahng and Sze21 in 1967. This is the 
nonvolatile semiconductor memory (NVSM), which can retain its stored information for 10 to 100 years when the 
power supply is switched off. A schematic diagram of the first NVSM is shown in Fig. 5. Although it is similar 
to a conventional MOSFET, the major difference is the addition of the floating gate, in which semipermanent 
charge storage is possible. NVSM has revolutionized information-storage technology and enabled or enhanced 
the development of nearly all electronic products, especially portable electronic systems such as the cellular phone, 
digital camera, notebook computer, and global positioning system.22
The charge-coupled device (CCD), invented by Boyle and Smith23 in 1970, is used in digital cameras and 
optical sensing applications. The resonant tunneling diode (RTD) was first studied by Chang et al.24 in 1974. RTD 
is the basis for most quantum-effect devices, which offer extremely high density, ultrahigh speed, and enhanced 
functionality because RTD significantly reduces the number of devices necessary to perform a given circuit 
function. In 1980, Minura et al.25 developed the MODFET (modulation-doped field-effect transistor). With the 
proper selection of heterojunction materials, the MODFET is expected to be the fastest field-effect transistor.
Since the invention of the bipolar transistor in 1947, the number and variety of semiconductor devices have 
increased tremendously as advanced technology, new materials, and broadened comprehension have been applied 
to the creation of new devices. In Part II of the book, we consider all the devices listed in Table 1. It is hoped that 
this book can serve as a basis for understanding other devices not included here and perhaps not even conceived at 
the present time.

0.2 SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY
0.2.1 
Key Semiconductor Technologies
Many important semiconductor technologies have been derived from processes invented centuries ago. For 
example, the lithography process was invented in 1798; in this first process, the pattern, or image, was transferred 
from a stone plate (lith- is Greek for ‘stone’).26 In this section, we consider the milestones of technologies that were 
applied for the first time to semiconductor processing or were developed specifically for semiconductor-device 
fabrication. 
Table 2 lists some key semiconductor technologies in chronological order. In 1918, Czochralski27 developed a 
liquid-solid monocomponent growth technique. The Czochralski growth is the process used to grow most of the 
crystals from which silicon wafers are produced. Another growth technique, developed by Bridgman28 in 1925, 
has been used extensively for growing gallium arsenide and related compound semiconductor crystals. Although 
the semiconductor properties of silicon have been widely studied since early 1940, the study of semiconductor 
compounds was neglected for a long time. In 1952, Welker29 noted that gallium arsenide and its related III–V 
compounds were semiconductors. He was able to predict their characteristics and prove them experimentally. The 
technology and devices of these compounds have since been actively studied. 
The diffusion of impurity atoms in semiconductors is important for device processing. Basic diffusion theory 
was considered by Fick30 in 1855. The idea of using diffusion techniques to alter the type of conductivity in silicon 
was disclosed in a patent in 1952 by Pfann.31 The lithography process was first applied to semiconductor-device 
fabrication by Andrus in 1957.32 He used photosensitive etch-resistant polymers (photoresist) for pattern transfer. 
Lithography is a key technology for the semiconductor industry. The continued growth of the industry has been 
the direct result of improved lithographic technology. Lithography is also a significant economic factor, currently 
representing over 35% of the integrated-circuit manufacturing cost.
The oxide masking method was developed by Frosch and Derick33 in 1957. They found that an oxide layer 
can prevent most impurity atoms from diffusing through it. In the same year, the epitaxial growth process based 
on chemical vapor deposition technique was developed by Sheftal et al.34 Epitaxy (from the Greek epi, meaning 
on, and taxis, meaning arrangement) is a technique of crystal growth to form a thin layer of semiconductor 
materials on a crystal surface that has a lattice structure identical to that of the crystal. This method is important 
in improving device performance and creating novel device structures.
In 1958, Shockley35 proposed a method of using ion implantation to dope semiconductors. Ion implantation 
has the capability of precisely controlling the number of implanted dopant atoms. Diffusion and ion implantation 
can complement each other for impurity doping. For example, diffusion can be used for high-temperature, deep-
junction processes, whereas ion implantation can be used for lower-temperature, shallow-junction processes.

In 1959, a rudimentary integrated circuit (IC) was made by Kilby.36 It contained one bipolar transistor, three 
resistors, and one capacitor, all made in germanium and connected by wire bonding—a hybrid circuit. Also in 
1959, Noyce37 created the monolithic IC by fabricating all devices in a single semiconductor substrate (monolith 
means ‘single stone’) and connecting the devices by aluminum metallization. Figure 6 shows the first monolithic 
IC of a flip-flop circuit containing six devices. The aluminum interconnection lines were obtained by etching 
evaporated aluminum layer over the entire oxide surface using the lithographic technique. These inventions laid the 
foundation for the rapid growth of the microelectronics industry.
The “planar” process was developed by Hoerni38 in 1960. In this process, an oxide layer is formed on a 
semiconductor surface. With the help of a lithographic process, portions of the oxide can be removed and 
windows cut in the oxide. Impurity atoms will diffuse only through the exposed semiconductor surface, and p–n 
junctions will form in the oxide window areas.

Introduction 7

As the complexity of the IC increased, we have moved from NMOS (n-channel MOSFET) to CMOS 
(complementary MOSFET) technology, which employs both NMOS and PMOS (p-channel MOSFET) to form 
the logic elements. The CMOS concept was proposed by Wanlass and Sah 39 in 1963. The advantage of CMOS 
technology is that logic elements draw significant current only during the transition from one state to another 
(e.g., from 0 to 1) and draw very little current between transitions, allowing power consumption to be minimized. 
CMOS technology is currently the dominant technology for advanced ICs.
In 1967, an important two-element circuit, the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), was invented by 
Dennard.40 The memory cell contains one MOSFET and one charge-storage capacitor. The MOSFET serves as a 
switch to charge or discharge the capacitor. Although DRAM is volatile and consumes relatively high power, we 
expect that DRAM will continue to be used in most electronic systems as an important working memory where 
information is held temporarily before being filed for long-term storage (e.g., in NVSM). 
To improve the device performance, the polysilicon self-aligned gate process was proposed by Kerwin et al.41 
in 1969. This process not only improved device reliability but also reduced parasitic capacitances. Also in 1969, the 
metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method was developed by Manasevit and Simpson.42 This is a 
very important epitaxial growth technique for compound semiconductors such as GaAs.
As the device dimensions were reduced, a dry etching technique was developed to replace wet chemical 
etching for high-fidelity pattern transfer. This technique was initiated by Irving et al.43 in 1971 using a CF4 – O2 gas 
mixture to etch silicon wafers. Another important technique developed in the same year by Cho is molecular beam 
epitaxy. 44 This technique has the advantage of near-perfect vertical control of composition and doping down to 
atomic dimensions. It is responsible for the creation of numerous photonic devices and quantum-effect devices.
In 1971, the first microprocessor was made by Hoff et al.45 They put the entire central processing unit (CPU) 
of a simple computer on one chip. This was a four-bit microprocessor (Intel 4004), shown in Fig. 7, with a chip 
size of 3 mm × 4 mm, and it contained 2300 MOSFETs and operated at 0.1 MIPS (million instructions per 
second). It was fabricated by a p-channel, polysilicon gate process using an 8 μm design rule. This microprocessor 
performed as well as those in $300,000 IBM computers of the early 1960s—each of which needed a CPU the 
size of a large desk. This was a major breakthrough for the semiconductor industry. Currently, microprocessors 
constitute the largest segment of the industry.

Semiconductors

Since early 1980, many new technologies have been developed to meet the requirements of ever-shrinking 
minimum feature lengths. An important technique, atomic layer deposition (ALD), was developed for nanoscaled 
dielectric film deposition by Suntola in 1981.46 This deposition technique involves exposing the chemical 
precursors to the growth surface in a sequential, one-at-a-time manner. The film thickness can be reliably 
controlled down to atomic dimensions.
The trench isolation technology was introduced by Rung et al.47 in 1982 to isolate CMOS devices and has 
ultimately replaced all other isolation methods. In 1989, Davari et al.48 developed the chemical-mechanical 
polishing method for global planarization of the interlayer dielectrics. This is a key process in multilevel 
metallization. 
At submicron dimensions, a widely known failure mechanism is electromigration, which is the transport of 
metal ions through a conductor due to the passage of an electrical current. Although aluminum has been used 
since the early 1960s as the interconnect material, it suffers from electromigration at high electrical current. The 
copper interconnect was introduced in 1993 by Paraszczak et al.49 to replace aluminum for minimum feature 
lengths below 100 nm. 
The increased component density and improved fabrication technology have helped realize the system-on-
a-chip (SOC), which is an IC chip containing a complete electronic system. The system-on-a-chip was integrated 
into a three-dimensional (3-D) system with improved performance by Banerjee in 2001.50
In order to extend the optical photolithography to the nanoscale regime, Owa et al. in 200351 developed 
immersion lithography through the addition of water between the exposure lens and the wafer surface. Immersion 
lithography increases the resolution by a factor equal to the refractive index of the liquid, and the minimum 
feature size can be made below 45 nm. In Part III of this book, we consider all the technologies listed in Table 2.
0.2.2 
Technology Trends
Since the beginning of the microelectronics era, the smallest line width or the minimum feature length of an 
integrated circuit has been reduced at a rate of about 13% per year.52 At that rate, the minimum feature length will 
shrink to about 10 nm in the year 2020. Figure 8 shows the minimum feature length versus year of first production 
from 1978 to 2010 and projected to 2020. In 2002 we entered the nanoelectronics era by reducing the minimum 
feature length below 100 nm.
Fig. 8 Exponential decrease of the minimum feature length versus time.52   
Introduction 9

Fig. 9 Exponential increase in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) density and nonvolatile 
semiconductor memory (NVSM) density versus year.52
Device miniaturization results in reduced unit cost per circuit function. For example, the cost per bit of 
memory chips has halved every two years for successive generations of DRAMs. As device dimension decreases, 
the intrinsic switching time also decreases: device speed has improved by five orders of magnitude since 1959. 
Higher speeds lead to expanded IC functional throughput rates. In the future, digital ICs will be able to perform 
data processing and numerical computation at terabit-per-second rates. As devices become smaller, they consume 
less power. Therefore, device miniaturization also reduces the energy used for each switching operation. The energy 
dissipated per logic gate has decreased by over ten million times since 1959.
Figure 9 shows the exponential increase in the actual memory density versus year of first production over 
the past 30 years. We note that the DRAM density increased by a factor of 2 every 18 months from 1978 to 2000. 
After 2000, the growth rate of DRAM density slowed down considerably. On the other hand, NVSM density has 
continued the original growth rate of DRAM density, i.e., doubling every 18 months. If the trends continue, we 
expect that NVSM density will increase to 1000 Gb or 1 terabits (1012 bits) around 2015. 
Figure 10 shows the exponential increase of microprocessor computational power. The computational power 
also increases approximately by a factor of 2 every 18 months. Currently, a Pentium-based personal computer 
has greater computational power than the CRAY 1 supercomputer of the late 1960s; yet, the PC is four orders of 
magnitude smaller. If the trends continue, we will reach 107 MIP (million instructions per second) around 2015.
Figure 11 illustrates growth curves for different technology drivers.53 At the beginning of the modern 
electronic era (1950–1970), the bipolar transistor was the technology driver. From 1970 to 1990, the DRAM and 
the microprocessor based on MOS devices were the technology drivers because of the rapid growth of personal 
computers and advanced electronic systems. Since 1990, nonvolatile semiconductor memory has been the 
technology driver, mainly because of the rapid growth of portable electronic systems.

SUMMARY
Although the field of semiconductor devices is a relatively new area of study,* it has had enormous impact on our 
society and the global economy. This is because semiconductor devices are the foundation of the largest industry 
in the world—the electronics industry.
This introductory chapter has presented a historical review of major semiconductor devices from the first 
study of metal-semiconductor contact in 1874 to the fabrication of an ultrasmall 5-nm MOSFET in 2004. Of 
particular importance are the invention of the bipolar transistor in 1947, which ushered in the modern electronic 
era; the development in 1960 of the MOSFET, the most important device for integrated circuits; and the invention 
of the nonvolalite semiconductor memory in 1967, which has been the technology driver of the electronic industry 
since 1990.
We have also described key semiconductor technologies. The origins of many technologies can be traced 
back to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Of particular importance are the development of the 
lithographic photoresist in 1957, which established the basic pattern-transfer process for semiconductor devices; 
the invention of the integrated circuits in 1959, which was seminal to the rapid growth of the microelectronic 
industry; and the developments of the DRAM in 1967 and the microprocessor in 1971, which constitute the two 
largest segments of the semiconductor industry. 
There is a vast literature on semiconductor-device physics and technology.54 To date, more than 500,000 
papers have been published in this field. In this book, each chapter deals with a major device or a key technology. 
Each is presented in a clear and coherent fashion without heavy reliance on the original literature. However, we 
have selected a few important papers at the end of each chapter for reference and for further reading.

SUMMARY
In this chapter, we consider some basic properties of semiconductors. We begin with a discussion of crystal 
structure, which is the arrangement of atoms in a solid. We then present the concepts of valence bonds and energy 
bands, which relate to conduction in semiconductors. Finally, we discuss the concept of carrier concentration in 
thermal equilibrium. These concepts are used throughout this book.
 
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
Element and compound semiconductors and their basic properties.
r
The diamond structure and its related crystal planes.
r
The bandgap and its impact on electrical conductivity.
r
The intrinsic carrier concentration and its dependence on temperature.
r
The Fermi level and its dependence on carrier concentration.
 
1.1 SEMICONDUCTOR MATERIALS
Solid-state materials can be grouped into three classes—insulators, semiconductors, and conductors. Figure 
1 shows the range of electrical conductivities σ (and the corresponding resistivities ρ = 1/σ)* associated with 
some important materials in each of the three classes. Insulators such as fused quartz and glass have very 
low conductivities, on the order of 10-18– 10-8 S/cm; and conductors such as aluminum and silver have high 
conductivities, typically from 104 to 106 S/cm.§ Semiconductors have conductivities between those of

insulators and those of conductors. The conductivity of a semiconductor is generally sensitive to temperature, 
illumination, magnetic field, and minute amounts of impurity atoms (typically, about 1 μg to 1 g of impurity 
atoms in 1 kg of semiconductor materials). This sensitivity in conductivity makes the semiconductor one of the 
most important materials for electronic applications.
1.1.1 
Element Semiconductors
The study of semiconductor materials began in the early nineteenth century.1 Over the years many semiconductors 
have been investigated. Table 1 shows a portion of the periodic table related to semiconductors. The element 
semiconductors, those composed of single species of atoms, such as silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), can be found 
in Column IV. In the early 1950s, germanium was the major semiconductor material. Since the early 1960s silicon 
has become a practical substitute and has now virtually supplanted germanium as a semiconductor material. 
The main reasons we now use silicon are that silicon devices exhibit better properties at room temperature, and 
high-quality silicon dioxide can be grown thermally. There are also economic considerations. Device-grade silicon 
costs much less than any other semiconductor material. Silicon in the form of silica and silicates comprises 25% 
of the Earth’s crust, and silicon is second only to oxygen in abundance. Currently, silicon is one of the most 
studied elements in the periodic table, and silicon technology is by far the most advanced among all semiconductor 
technologies.

1.1.2 
Compound Semiconductors
In recent years a number of compound semiconductors have found applications for various devices. The important 
compound semiconductors as well as the two-element-semiconductors are listed2 in Table 2. A binary compound 
semiconductor is a combination of two elements from the periodic table. For example, gallium arsenide (GaAs) is 
a III-V compound that is a combination of gallium (Ga) from Column III and arsenic (As) from Column V.
In addition to binary compounds, ternary compounds and quaternary compounds are made for special 
applications. The alloy semiconductor AlxGa1-xAs, which has Al and Ga from Column III and As from Column 
V is an example of a ternary compound, whereas quaternary compounds of the form AxB1-xCyD1-y can be 
obtained from the combination of many binary and ternary compound semiconductors. For example, GaP, InP, 
InAs, and GaAs can be combined to yield the alloy semiconductor GaxIn1-xAsyP1-y. Compared with the element 
semiconductors, the preparation of compound semiconductors in single-crystal form usually involves much more 
complex processes.
Many of the compound semiconductors have electrical and optical properties that are different from those 
of silicon. These semiconductors, especially GaAs, are used mainly for high-speed electronic and photonic 
applications. Although we do not know as much about the technology of compound semiconductors as we do 
about that of silicon, advances in silicon technology have also helped progress in compound semiconductor 
technology. In this book we are concerned mainly with device physics and processing technology of silicon and 
gallium arsenide. A detailed discussion of the crystal growth of silicon and gallium arsenide can be found in 
Chapter 11.
 
1.2 BASIC CRYSTAL STRUCTURES
The semiconductor materials we will be studying are single crystals; that is, the atoms are arranged in a three-
dimensional periodic fashion. The periodic arrangement of atoms in a crystal is called a lattice. In a crystal, an 
atom never strays far from a single, fixed position. The thermal vibrations associated with the atom are centered 
about this position. For a given semiconductor, there is a unit cell that is representative of the entire lattice; by 
repeating the unit cell throughout the crystal, one can generate the entire lattice.

1.2.1    Unit Cell  
A generalized primitive three-dimensional unit cell is shown in Fig. 2. The relationship between this cell and the 
lattice is characterized by three vectors a, b, and c, which need not be perpendicular to each other and may or may 
not be equal in length. Every equivalent lattice point in the three-dimensional crystal can be found using the set   
 
R = ma + nb + pc, 
(1)
where m, n, and p are integers.

Fig. 2 A generalized primitive unit cell.
Figure 3 shows some basic cubic-crystal unit cells. Figure 3a shows a simple cubic (sc) crystal; it has an atom 
at each corner of the cubic lattice, and each atom has six equidistant nearest-neighbor atoms. The dimension a is 
called the lattice constant. In the periodic table, only polonium is crystallized in the simple cubic lattice. Figure 3b 
is a body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal where, in addition to the eight corner atoms, an atom is located at the center 
of the cube. In a bcc lattice, each atom has eight nearest-neighbor atoms. Crystals exhibiting bcc lattices include 
those of sodium and tungsten. Figure 3c shows the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal that has one atom at each of 
the six cubic faces in addition to the eight corner atoms. In this case, each atom has 12 nearest-neighbor atoms. A 
large number of elements exhibit the fcc lattice form, including aluminum, copper, gold, and platinum.
 EXAMPLE 1
If we pack hard spheres in a bcc lattice so that the atom in the center just touches the atoms at the corners of the 
cube, find the fraction of the bcc unit cell volume filled with hard spheres.
SOLUTION Each corner sphere in a bcc unit cell is shared with eight neighboring cells; thus, each unit cell contains 
one-eighth of a sphere at each of the eight corners for a total of one sphere. In addition, each unit cell contains 
one central sphere. We have the following:
Spheres (atoms) per unit cell = (1/8) × 8 (corner) + 1 (center) = 2;
Nearest-neighbor distance (along the diagonal AE in Fig. 3b) = a 3 2
/ ;
Radius of each sphere = a 3 4
/ ;
Volume of each sphere = 4 π/3 × (a 3/4)3 = π a3 3/16; and
Maximum fraction of unit cell filled = Number of spheres × volume of each sphere/total volume 
of each unit cell = 2( π a3 3/16)/a3 = π 3/8 ≈ 0.68.
Therefore, about 68% of the bcc unit cell volume is filled with hard spheres, and about 32% of  
the volume is empty.

1.2.2 
The Diamond Structure
The element semiconductors, silicon and germanium, have the diamond lattice structure shown in Fig. 4a. This 
structure also belongs to the fcc crystal family and can be seen as two interpenetrating fcc sublattices with one 
sublattice displaced from the other by one-quarter of the distance along the body diagonal of the cube (i.e., a 
displacement of a 3/4). Although chemically identical, the two sets of atoms belonging to the two sublattices are 
different in terms of the crystal structure. It can be seen in Fig. 4a that if a corner atom has one nearest neighbor 
in the body diagonal direction, then it has no nearest neighbor in the reverse direction. Consequently, two such 
atoms are required in the unit cell. Alternatively, a unit cell of a diamond lattice consists of a tetrahedron in which 
each atom is surrounded by four equidistant nearest neighbors that lie at the corners (the spheres connected by 
darkened bars in Fig. 4a).
Most of the III-V compound semiconductors (e.g., GaAs) have a zincblende lattice, shown in Fig. 4b, which is 
identical to a diamond lattice except that one fcc sublattice has Column III atoms (Ga) and the other has Column 
V atoms (As). Appendix F gives a summary of the lattice constants and other properties of important element and 
binary compound semiconductors.
 EXAMPLE 2
At 300 K the lattice constant for silicon is 5.43 Å. Calculate the number of silicon atoms per cubic centimeter and 
the density of silicon at room temperature.
SOLUTION There are eight atoms per unit cell. Therefore,
8/a3 = 8/(5.43 × 10-8)3 = 5 × 1022 atoms/cm3; and
Density = no. of atoms/cm3 × atomic weight/Avogadro’s number = 5 × 1022 (atoms/cm3) × 28.09 (g/mol)/6.02 × 1023 
(atoms/mol) = 2.33 g/cm3.

1.2.3 
Crystal Planes and Miller Indices
In Fig. 3b we note that there are four atoms in the ABCD plane and five atoms in the ACEF plane (four atoms 
from the corners and one from the center) and that the atomic spacing is different in the two planes. Therefore, 
the crystal properties along different planes are different, and the electrical and other device characteristics can 
be dependent on the crystal orientation. A convenient method of defining the various planes in a crystal is to use 
Miller indices.3 These indices are obtained using the following steps:
1. Find the intercepts of the plane on the three Cartesian coordinates in terms of the lattice constant.
2. Take the reciprocals of these numbers and reduce them to the smallest three integers having the same ratio.
3. Enclose the result in parentheses (hkl) as the Miller indices for a single plane.
 EXAMPLE 3
As shown in Fig. 5, the plane has intercepts at a, 3a, and 2a along the three coordinates. Taking the reciprocals of 
these intercepts, we get 1, 1⁄3, and 1⁄2. The smallest three integers having the same ratio are 6, 2, and 3 (obtained 
by multiplying each fraction by 6). Thus, the plane is referred to as a (623)-plane.

1.3    VALENCE BONDS
As discussed in Section 1.2, each atom in a diamond lattice is surrounded by four nearest neighbors. Figure 
7a shows the tetrahedron bonds of a diamond lattice. A simplified two-dimensional bonding diagram for the 
tetrahedron is shown in Fig. 7b. Each atom has four electrons in the outer orbit, and each atom shares these 
valence electrons with its four neighbors. This sharing of electrons is known as covalent bonding; each electron pair 
constitutes a covalent bond. Covalent bonding occurs between atoms of the same element or between atoms of 
different elements that have similar outer-shell electron configurations. Each electron spends an equal amount of 
time with each nucleus. However, both electrons spend most of their time between the two nuclei. The force of 
attraction for the electrons by both nuclei holds the two atoms together.
Gallium arsenide crystallizes in a zincblende lattice, which also has tetrahedron bonds. The major bonding 
force in GaAs is also due to the covalent bond. However, gallium arsenide has a small ionic contribution that is an 
electrostatic attractive force between each Ga+ ion and its four neighboring As– ions, or between each As– ion and 
its four neighboring Ga+ ions. Electronically, this means that the paired bonding electrons spend slightly more time 
in the As atom than in the Ga atom.
At low temperatures, the electrons are bound in their respective tetrahedron lattice; consequently, they are not 
available for conduction. At higher temperatures, thermal vibrations may break the covalent bonds (ionize one 
electron from the bond). When a bond is broken, a free electron results and can participate in current conduction.
§  In Chapter 5, we show that the 100  orientation is preferred for silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor       
field-effect  transistors (MOSFETs).

resulting in a conduction electron and a hole. (b) A broken bond at position B.
Figure 8a shows the situation when a valence electron in silicon becomes a free electron. An electron deficiency is 
left in the covalent bond. This deficiency may be filled by one of the neighboring electrons, which results in a shift 
of the deficiency location, as from location A to location B in Fig. 8b. We may, therefore, consider this deficiency 
as a particle similar to an electron. This fictitious particle is called a hole. It carries a positive charge and moves, 
under the influence of an applied electric field, in the direction opposite to that of an electron. Therefore, both the 
electron and the hole contribute to the total electric current. The concept of a hole is analogous to that of a bubble 
in a liquid: although it is actually the liquid that moves, it is much easier to talk about the motion of the bubble in 
the opposite direction.
 
1.4 ENERGY BANDS
1.4.1    Energy Levels of Isolated Atoms
For an isolated atom, the electrons can have discrete energy levels. For example, the energy levels for an 
isolated hydrogen atom are given by the Bohr model:4

where m0 is the free-electron mass, q is the electronic charge, ε0 is the free-space permittivity, h is the Planck 
constant, and n is a positive integer called the principal quantum number. The quantity eV (electron volt) is an 
energy unit corresponding to the energy gained by an electron when its potential is increased by one volt. It is 
equal to the product of q (1.6 × 10–19 coulomb) and one volt, or 1.6 × 10–19 J. The discrete energies are –13.6 eV for 
the ground- state energy level (n = 1), – 3.4 eV for the first excited-state energy level (n = 2), and so on. Detailed 
studies reveal that for higher principle quantum numbers (n ≥ 2), energy levels are split according to their angular 
momentum quantum number (ℓ = 0, 1, 2, …, n – 1).
We now consider two identical atoms. When they are far apart, the allowed energy levels for a given principal 
quantum number (e.g., n = 1) consist of one doubly degenerate level; that is, both atoms have exactly the 
same energy. When they are brought closer, the doubly degenerate energy levels will spilt into two levels by the 
interaction between the atoms. The split occurs due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no more 
than two electrons in a given system can reside in the same energy state at the same time. As N isolated atoms are 
brought together to form a solid, the orbits of the outer electrons of different atoms overlap and interact with 
each other. This interaction, including those forces of attraction and repulsion between atoms, causes a shift in the 
energy levels, as in the case of two interacting atoms. However, instead of two levels, N separate but closely spaced 
levels are formed. When N is large, the result is an essentially continuous band of energy. This band of N levels can 
extend over a few eV at the inter-atomic distance of the crystal. The electrons can no longer be treated as belonging 
to their parent atoms. They belong to the crystal as a whole. Figure 9 shows the effect, where the parameter a 
represents the equilibrium inter-atomic distance of the crystal. 
Fig. 9 The splitting of a degenerate state into a band of allowed energies.
24 Semiconductors

Fig. 10 Schematic representation of an isolated silicon atom.
The actual band splitting in a semiconductor is much more complicated. Figure 10 shows an isolated silicon 
atom that has 14 electrons. Of the 14 electrons, 10 occupy deep-lying energy levels whose orbital radius is much 
smaller than the interatomic separation in the crystal. The four remaining valence electrons are relatively weakly 
bound and can be involved in chemical reactions. Therefore, we only need to consider the outer shell (the n =3 
level) for the valence electrons, since the two inner shells are completely full and tightly bound to the nucleus. The 
3s subshell (i.e., for n = 3 and ℓ = 0) has two allowed quantum states per atom. This subshell will contain two 
valence electrons at T = 0 K. The 3p subshell (i.e., n = 3 and ℓ = 1) has six allowed quantum states per atom. This 
subshell will contain the remaining two valence electrons of an individual silicon atom.
Figure 11 is a schematic diagram of the formation of a silicon crystal from N isolated silicon atoms. As the 
interatomic distance decreases, the 3s and 3p subshell of the N silicon atoms will interact and overlap to form 
bands. As the 3s and 3p bands grow, they merge into a single band containing 8 N states. At the equilibrium 
interatomic distance determined by the condition of minimum total energy, the bands will again split, with 4 N 
states in the lower band and 4 N states in the upper band. 
At a temperature of absolute zero, electrons occupy the lowest energy states, so that all states in the lower 
band (the valence band) will be full and all states in the upper band (the conduction band) will be empty. The 
bottom of the conduction band is called EC and the top of the valence band is called EV. The bandgap energy 
Eg between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band (EC – EV) is the width of the 
forbidden energy gap, as shown at the far left of Fig. 11. Physically, Eg is the energy required to break a bond in the 
semiconductor to free an electron to the conduction band and leave a hole in the valence band.

where p is the momentum and m0 is the free-electron mass. If we plot E vs. p, we obtain a parabola as shown in Fig. 
12. In a semiconductor crystal, an electron in the conduction band is similar to a free electron in being relatively 
free to move about in the crystal. However, because of the periodic potential of the nuclei, Eq. 3 can no longer be 
valid. However, it turns out that we can still use Eq. 3 if we replace the free-electron mass in Eq. 3 by an effective 
mass mn (the subscript n refers to the negative charge on an electron), that is,

Fig. 12 The parabolic energy (E) vs. momentum (p) curve for a free electron.
Therefore, the narrower the parabola, corresponding to a larger second derivative, the smaller the effective 
mass. A similar expression can be written for holes (with effective mass mp where the subscript p refers to the 
positive charge on a hole). The effective-mass concept is very useful because it enables us to treat electrons and 
holes essentially as classical charged particles.
Figure 13 shows a simplified energy-momentum relationship of a special semiconductor with an electron 
effective mass of mn= 0.25 m0 
 in the conduction band (the upper parabola) and a hole effective mass of mp = m0 in the 
valence band (the lower parabola). Note that the electron energy is measured upward and the hole energy is measured 
downward. The spacing at p = 0 between these two parabolas is the bandgap Eg, shown previously in Fig. 11.
The actual energy-momentum relationships (also called energy-band diagram) for silicon and gallium 
arsenide are much more complex. Visualized in three dimensions, the relationship between E and p is a complex 
surface. They are shown in Fig. 14 only for two crystal directions. Since the periodicity of most lattice is different 
in various directions, the energy-momentum diagram is also different for different directions. In the case of the 
diamond or zincblende lattice, the maximum in the valence band and minimum in the conduction band occur at p 
= 0 or along one of these two directions. If the minimum of the conduction band occurs at p = 0, this means the 
effective mass of the electrons in every direction in the crystal is the same.  It also indicates that the electron motion 
is independent of crystal direction. If the minimum of the conduction band occurs at p ≠ 0, this means that the 
electron behavior in every direction is not the same in the crystal. In general, the minimum of conduction band of 
polar (with partly ionic binding) semiconductors tend to be at p = 0, which is related to the lattice structure and the 
fraction of ionicity in the bond.

We note that the general features in Fig. 14 are similar to those in Fig. 13. First of all, the valence bands 
are simpler than the conduction bands. They are qualitatively similar for most semiconductors because the 
environments for holes moving in the covalent bonds are similar due to the similar structures in diamond and 
zincblende. There is a bandgap Eg between the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band. 
Near the minimum of the conduction band or the maximum of the valence band, the E-p curves are essentially 
parabolic. For silicon (Fig. 14a) the maximum in the valence band occurs at p = 0, but the minimum in the 
conduction band occurs along the [100] direction at p = pc. Therefore, in silicon, when an electron makes a 
transition from the maximum point in the valence band to the minimum point in the conduction band, not only 
an energy change (≥ Eg) but also some momentum change (≥ pc) is required.
For gallium arsenide (Fig. 14b) the maximum in the valence band and the minimum in the conduction 
band occur at the same momentum (p = 0). Thus, an electron making a transition from the valence band to the 
conduction band can do so without a change in momentum.
Gallium arsenide is called a direct semiconductor because it does not require a change in momentum for 
an electron transition from the valence band to the conduction band. Silicon is called an indirect semiconductor 
because a change of momentum is required in a transition. This difference between direct and indirect band 
structures is very important for light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers. These devices require direct 
semiconductors to generate efficiently photons (see Chapters 9 and 10). 
We can obtain the effective mass from Fig. 14 using Eq. 5. For example, for gallium arsenide with a very 
narrow conduction–band parabola, the electron effective mass is 0.063 m0, while for silicon, with a wider 
conduction–band parabola, the electron effective mass is 0.19 m0.
1.4.3 
Conduction in Metals, Semiconductors, and Insulators
The enormous variation in electrical conductivity of metals, semiconductors, and insulators shown in Fig. 1 may 
be explained qualitatively in terms of their energy bands. Figure 15 shows the energy band diagrams of three 
classes of solids—metals, semiconductors, and insulators.
28 Semiconductors

(either the partially filled conduction band shown at the upper portion or the overlapping  
bands shown at the lower portion), (b) a semiconductor, and (c) an insulator.
Metals
The characteristics of a metal (also called a conductor) include a very low value of resistivity and a conduction band 
that either is partially filled (as in Cu) or overlaps the valence band (as in Zn or Pb) so that there is no bandgap, as 
shown in Fig. 15a. As a consequence, the uppermost electrons in the partially filled band or electrons at the top of the 
valence band can move to the next higher available energy level when they gain kinetic energy (e.g., from an applied 
electric field). Electrons are free to move with only a small applied field in a metal because there are many unoccupied 
states close to the occupied energy states. Therefore, current conduction can readily occur in conductors.
Insulators
In an insulator such as silicon dioxide (SiO2), the valence electrons form strong bonds between neighboring atoms. 
Since these bonds are difficult to break, there are no free electrons to participate in current conduction at or 
near room temperature. As shown in the energy band diagram (Fig. 15c), insulators are characterized by a large 
bandgap. Note that electrons occupy all energy levels in the valence band and all energy levels in the conduction 
band are empty. Thermal energy§ or the energy of an applied electric field is insufficient to raise the uppermost 
electron in the valence band to the conduction band. Thus, although an insulator has many vacant states in the 
conduction band that can accept electrons, so few electrons actually occupy conduction band states that the overall 
contribution to electrical conductivity is very small, resulting in a very high resistivity. Therefore, silicon dioxide is 
an insulator; it can not conduct current.
Semiconductors
Now, consider a material that has a much smaller energy gap, on the order of 1 eV (Fig. 15b). Such materials 
are called semiconductors. At T = 0 K, all electrons are in the valence band, and there are no electrons in the 
conduction band. Thus, semiconductors are poor conductors at low temperatures. At room temperature and 
under normal atmospheres, values of Eg are 1.12 eV for Si and 1.42 eV for GaAs. The thermal energy kT at room 
temperature is a good fraction of Eg, and appreciable numbers of electrons are thermally excited from the valence 
band to the conduction band. Since there are many empty states in the conduction band, a small applied potential 
can easily move these electrons, resulting in a moderate current.
 
1.5 INTRINSIC CARRIER CONCENTRATION
We now derive the carrier concentration in the thermal equilibrium condition, that is, the steady-state condition 
at a given temperature without any external excitations such as light, pressure, or an electric field. At a given 
temperature, continuous thermal agitation results in the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the 
conduction band and leaves an  equal number of holes in the valence band. An intrinsic semiconductor is one that 
contains relatively small amounts of impurities compared with the thermally generated electrons and holes.
§  The thermal energy is of the order of kT. At room temperature, kT is 0.026 eV, which is much smaller than the bandgap  
of an insulator.

Fig. 16 Fermi distribution function F(E) versus (E – EF) for various temperatures.
To obtain the electron density (i.e., the number of electrons per unit volume) in an intrinsic semiconductor, 
we first evaluate the electron density in an incremental energy range dE. This density n(E) is given by the product 
of the density of states N(E), that is, the density of allowed energy states (including electron spin) per energy range 
per unit volume,§  and by the probability of occupying that energy range F(E). Thus, the electron density in the 
conduction band is given by integrating N(E) F(E) dE from the bottom of the conduction band (EC initially taken 
to be E = 0 for simplicity) to the top of the conduction band Etop:

The Fermi distribution is illustrated in Fig. 16 for different temperatures. Note that F(E) is symmetrical around the 
Fermi level EF. 
For energies that are 3kT above or below the Fermi energy, the exponential term in Eq. 7 becomes larger 
than 20 or smaller than 0.05, respectively. The Fermi distribution function can thus be approximated by simpler 
expressions:

the product of N(E) in Fig. 17b and F(E) in Fig. 17c gives the n(E)-versus-E curve (upper curve) in Fig. 17d. The 
upper shaded area in Fig. 17d corresponds to the electron density. 
There are a large number of allowed states in the conduction band. However, for an intrinsic semiconductor 
there will not be many electrons in the conduction band. Therefore, the probability of an electron occupying one 
of these states is small. Also, there are a large number of allowed states in the valence band. By contrast, most of 
these are occupied by electrons. Thus, the probability of an electron occupying one of these states in the valence 
band is nearly unity. There will be only a few unoccupied electron states, that is, holes, in the valence band. From 
Fig. 16 then, all electrons are in the valence band, and there are no electrons in the conduction band at T = 0 K. 
The Fermi energy EF for which the probability of occupation by an electron is 0.5 lies midway between the two 
bands. At a finite temperature, the number of electrons in the conduction band is equal to the number of holes 
in the valence band. The Fermi distribution is symmetrical around the Fermi level EF. The Fermi level must be at 
the midgap in order to obtain equal electron and hole concentrations if the density of state in the conduction and 
valence bands is the same. That is to say, EF is independent of temperature for an intrinsic semiconductor. As can 
be seen, the Fermi level is located near the middle of the bandgap. Substituting the last equation in Appendix H 
and Eq. 8a into Eq. 6 yields§

For an intrinsic semiconductor, the number of electrons per unit volume in the conduction band is equal to 
the number of holes per unit volume in the valence band, that is, n = p = ni where ni is the intrinsic carrier density. 
This relationship of electrons and holes is depicted in Fig. 17d. Note that the shaded area in the conduction band 
is the same as that in the valence band.

The Fermi level for an intrinsic semiconductor is obtained by equating Eq.13 and Eq. 14:
 
EF = Ei= (EC + EV)/2 + (kT/2) ln (NV/NC). 
(16)
At room temperature, the second term is much smaller than the bandgap. Hence, the intrinsic Fermi level Ei 
of an intrinsic semiconductor generally lies very close to the middle of the bandgap.

larger the bandgap, the smaller the intrinsic carrier density.

1.6 DONORS AND ACCEPTORS
When a semiconductor is doped with impurities, the semiconductor becomes extrinsic and impurity energy levels 
are introduced. Figure 19a shows schematically that a silicon atom is replaced (or substituted) by an arsenic atom 
with five valence electrons. The arsenic atom forms covalent bonds with its four neighboring silicon atoms. The 
fifth electron has a relatively small binding energy to its host arsenic atom and can be “ionized” to become a 
conduction electron at a moderate temperature. We say that this electron has been “donated” to the conduction 
band. The arsenic atom is called a donor and the silicon becomes n-type because of the addition of the negative 
charge carrier. Similarly, Fig. 19b shows that when a boron atom with three valence electrons substitutes for a 
silicon atom, an additional electron is “accepted” to form four covalent bonds around the boron, and a positively 
charged “hole” is created in the valence band. This is a p-type semiconductor, and the boron is an acceptor.
The impurity atoms are imperfections and interrupt the perfect periodicity of the lattice; energy levels within 
the band gap that were forbidden are no longer disallowed. That is to say, the impurity atoms will introduce an 
energy level or multiple energy levels in the band gap.
We can estimate the ionization energy for the donor ED by replacing m0 with the electron effective mass mn and 
taking into account the semiconductor permittivity εs in the hydrogen atom model, Eq. 2:

(20)
The ionization energy for donors, measured from the conduction band edge and calculated from Eq. 20 is 
0.025 eV for silicon and 0.007 eV for gallium arsenide. The hydrogen atom calculation for the ionization level of 
acceptors is similar to that for donors. We consider the unfilled valence band as a filled band plus a hole in the 
central force field of a negative charged acceptor. The calculated ionization energy, measured from the valence 
band edge, is 0.05 eV for both silicon and gallium arsenide.
This simple hydrogen atom model cannot account for the details of the ionization energy, particularly for the 
deep impurity levels in semiconductors (i.e., with ionization energies ≥3 kT). However, the calculated values do 
predict the correct order of magnitude of the true ionization energies for shallow impurity levels. Figure 20 shows 
the measured ionization energies for various impurities in silicon and gallium arsenide.8 Note that it is possible for 
a single atom to have many levels; for example, oxygen in silicon has two donor levels and two acceptor levels in 
the forbidden energy gap.

Fig. 20 Measured ionization energies (in eV) for various impurities in Si and GaAs. The levels  
below the gap center are measured from the top of the valence band and are acceptor levels unless  
labeled by D for donor level. The levels above the gap center are measured from the bottom of the 
conduction band and are donor levels unless indicated by A for acceptor level.8
1.6.1    Nondegenerate Semiconductor
In our previous discussion, we have assumed that the electron or hole concentration is much lower than the 
effective density of states in the conduction band or the valence band, respectively. In other words, the Fermi level 
EF is at least 3kT above EV or 3kT below EC. In such cases, the semiconductor is referred to as a nondegenerate 
semiconductor.
For shallow donors in n-type silicon and gallium arsenide, there usually is enough thermal energy to supply 
the energy ED to ionize all donor impurities at room temperature and  thus  provide  the  same  number  of  
electrons in the conduction band.  This condition is called complete ionization. Under a complete ionization 
condition, we can write the electron density as

and (b) acceptor ions.

n = ND, 
(21)
where ND is the donor concentration. Figure 21a illustrates complete ionization where the donor level ED is 
measured with respect to the bottom of the conduction band and equal concentrations of electrons (which are 
mobile) and donor ions (which are immobile) are shown. From Eqs. 13 and 21, we obtain the Fermi level in terms 
of the effective density of states NC and the donor concentration ND:
 
EC – EF = kT ln (NC/ND). 
(22)
Similarly, for shallow acceptors for p-type semiconductors as shown in Fig. 21b, if there is complete 
ionization, the concentration of holes is
 
p = NA, 
(23)
where NA is the acceptor concentration. We can obtain the corresponding Fermi level from Eqs. 14 and 23:
 
EF – EV  =  kT ln (NV/NA). 
(24)
From Eq. 22 we can see that the higher the donor concentration, the smaller the energy difference (EC – EF); 
that is, the Fermi level will move closer to the bottom of the conduction band. Similarly, for higher acceptor 
concentration, the Fermi level will move closer to the top of the valence band. Figure 22 illustrates the procedure 
for obtaining the carrier concentrations for an n-type semiconductor. This figure is similar to that shown in Fig. 
17. However, the Fermi level is closer to the bottom of the conduction band, and the electron concentration (upper 
shaded area) is much larger than the hole concentration (lower shaded area).
It is useful to express electron and hole densities in terms of the intrinsic carrier concentration ni and the 
intrinsic Fermi level Ei since Ei is frequently used as a reference level when discussing extrinsic semiconductors.

2. This result is identical to that for the intrinsic case, 
Eq. 17. Equation 17 is called the mass action law, and is valid for both intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors under 
thermal equilibrium conduction. In an extrinsic semiconductor, the Fermi level moves toward either the bottom 
of the conduction band (n-type) or the top of the valence band (p-type). Either n- or p-type carriers will then 
dominate, but the product of the two types of carriers will remain constant at a given temperature.
 EXAMPLE 4
A silicon ingot is doped with 1016 arsenic atoms/cm3. Find the carrier concentrations and the Fermi level at room 
temperature (300 K).
SOLUTION At 300 K, we can assume complete ionization of impurity atoms. We have
 
n ≈ ND= 1016 cm-3.
From Eq. 17, 
p ≈ ni
2/ND = (9.65 × 109)2/1016 = 9.3 × 103 cm–3.
The Fermi level measured from the bottom of the conduction band is given by Eq. 22:
 
EC – EF = kT ln (NC /ND)
 
= 0.0259 ln(2.86 × 1019/1016) = 0.205 eV.
The Fermi level measured from the intrinsic Fermi level is given by Eq. 25:
 
EF – Ei ≈ kT ln (ND /ni)
 
= 0.0259 ln(1016/9.65 × 109) = 0.358 eV.
These results are shown graphically in Fig. 23. 
If both donor and acceptor impurities are present simultaneously, the impurity that is present in a greater 
concentration determines the type of conductivity in the semiconductor. 
The Fermi level must adjust itself to preserve charge neutrality, that is, the total negative charges (electrons 
and ionized acceptors) must equal the total positive charges (holes and ionized donors). Under complete 
ionization condition, we have

Generally, the magnitude of the net impurity concentration |ND – NA| is greater than the intrinsic carrier 
concentration ni; therefore, the above relationships can be simplified to
 
nn ≈ ND – NA   if    ND > NA, 
(32)
 
pp ≈ NA – ND   if    NA > ND. 
(33)
From Eqs. 28 to 31 together with Eqs. 13 and 14, we can calculate the position of the Fermi level as a function 
of temperature for a given acceptor or donor concentration. Figure 24  plots these calculations for silicon9 and 
gallium arsenide. We have incorporated in the figure the variation of the bandgap with temperature (see Problem 
7). Note that as the temperature increases, the Fermi level approaches the intrinsic level, that is, the semiconductor 
becomes intrinsic.
Figure 25 shows electron density in Si as a function of temperature for a donor concentration of 
ND 
 = 1015 cm-3. At low temperatures, the thermal energy in the crystal is not sufficient to ionize all the donor 
impurities present. Some electrons are “frozen” at the donor level and the electron density is less than the donor 
concentration. As the temperature is increased, the condition of complete ionization is reached,  
(i.e., nn = ND). As the temperature is further increased, the electron concentration remains essentially the  same over 
a wide temperature range. This is the extrinsic region. However, as the temperature is increased even further, we 
reach a point where the intrinsic carrier concentration becomes comparable to the donor concentration. Beyond 
this point, the semiconductor becomes intrinsic. The temperature at which the semiconductor becomes intrinsic 
depends on the impurity concentrations and the bandgap value and can be obtained from Fig. 18 by setting the 
impurity concentration equal to ni.

concentration of 1015 cm-3.

1.6.2 Degenerate Semiconductor
When the doping concentration becomes equal or larger than the corresponding effective density of states, we can 
no longer use the approximation of Eq. 8, and the electron density (Eq. 6) has to be integrated numerically. For 
very heavily doped n-type or p-type semiconductor, EF will be above EC or below EV. The semiconductor is referred 
to as a degenerate semiconductor.
An important aspect of high doping is the bandgap-narrowing effect; that is, high impurity concentration 
causes a reduction of the  bandgap. The bandgap  reduction  ΔEg for silicon at room temperature is given by

where the doping is in cm-3. For example, for ND 
 ≤ 1018 cm-3, ΔEg 
 ≤ 0.022 eV, which is less than 2% of  
the original bandgap. However, for ND 
 ≥ NC 
 = 2.86 × 1019 cm-3, ΔEg 
 ≥ 0.12 eV, which is a significant fraction of Eg.
 
SUMMARY
At the beginning of the chapter we listed a few important semiconductor materials. The properties of 
semiconductors are determined to a large extent by the crystal structure. We have defined the Miller indices to 
describe the crystal surfaces and crystal orientations. A discussion of how to grow semiconductor crystals can be 
found in Chapter 11.
The bonding of atoms and the electron energy-momentum relationship in a semiconductor were considered in 
connection with the electrical properties. The energy band diagram can be used to understand why some materials 
are good conductors of electric current whereas others are poor conductors. We have also shown that changing the 
temperature or the amount of impurities can drastically vary the conductivity of a semiconductor.

SUMMARY
In this chapter, we investigate various transport phenomena in semiconductor devices. The transport processes 
include drift, diffusion, recombination, generation, thermionic emission, space charge effect, tunneling, and impact 
ionization. We consider the motion of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in semiconductors under the influence 
of both an electric field and a carrier concentration gradient. We also discuss the concept of the nonequilibrium 
condition, where the carrier concentration product pn is different from its equilibrium value ni
2. Returning to an 
equilibrium condition through the generation-recombination processes will be discussed next. We then derive the 
basic governing equations for semiconductor device operation, which includes the current density equation and 
the continuity equation. This is followed by a discussion of thermionic emission, the tunneling process, and the 
space-charge effect. The chapter closes with a brief discussion of high-field effects, including velocity saturation 
and impact ionization. 
 
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
The current density equation and its drift and diffusion components.
r
The continuity equation and its generation and recombination components.
r
 Other transport phenomena, including thermionic emission, tunneling, space-charge effect, 
transferred-electron effect, and impact ionization.

 Methods to measure key semiconductor parameters such as resistivity, mobility, majority-
carrier concentration, and minority-carrier lifetime.
 
2.1 CARRIER DRIFT
2.1.1  Mobility
Consider an n-type semiconductor sample with uniform donor concentration in thermal equilibrium. As discussed 
in Chapter 1, the conduction electrons in the semiconductor conduction band are essentially free particles, since 
they are not associated with any particular lattice or donor site. The influence of crystal lattices is incorporated 

in the effective mass of conduction electrons, which differs somewhat from the mass of free electrons. Under 
thermal equilibrium, the average thermal energy of a conduction electron can be obtained from the theorem for 
equipartition of energy, 1/2 kT units of energy per degree of freedom, where k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the 
absolute temperature. The electrons in a semiconductor have three degrees of freedom; they can move around in a 
three-dimensional space. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electrons is given by

where mn is the effective mass of electrons and υth is the average thermal velocity. At room temperature (300 K), the 
thermal velocity of electrons in Eq. 1 is about 107 cm/s for silicon and gallium arsenide.
The electrons in the semiconductor are therefore moving rapidly in all directions. The thermal motion of 
an individual electron may be visualized as a succession of random scattering from collisions with lattice atoms, 
impurity atoms, and other scattering centers, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The random motion of electrons leads 
to zero net displacement of an electron over a sufficiently long period of time. The average distance between 
collisions is called the mean free path, and the average time between collisions is called the mean free time τc. For a 
typical value of 10–5 cm for the mean free path, τ is about 1 ps (i.e., 10–5/υth ≅ 10–12 s).
When a small electric field E is applied to the semiconductor sample, each electron will experience a force 
–qE from the field and will be accelerated along the field (in the opposite direction to the field) during the time 
between collisions. Therefore, an additional velocity component will be superimposed upon the thermal motion of 
electrons. This additional component is called the drift velocity. The combined displacement of an electron due to 
the random thermal motion and the drift component is illustrated in Fig. 1b. Note that there is a net displacement 
of the electron in the direction opposite to the applied field.
We can obtain the drift velocity υn by equating the momentum (force × time) applied to an electron during 
the free flight between collisions to the momentum gained by the electron in the same period. The equality is 
valid because in a steady state all momentum gained between collisions is lost to the lattice in the collision. The 
momentum applied to an electron is given by –qE τc, and the momentum gained is mnυn. We have

Equation 2a states that the electron drift velocity is proportional to the applied electric field. The proportionality 
factor depends on the mean free time and the effective mass. The proportionality factor is called the electron 
mobility μn with units of cm2/V-s, or

Mobility is an important parameter for carrier transport because it describes how strongly the motion of an 
electron is influenced by an applied electric field. A similar expression can be written for holes in the valence band: 
 
υ
μ
p
pE ,
 
(5)
where υp is the hole drift velocity and μp is the hole mobility. The negative sign is removed in Eq. 5, because holes 
drift in the same direction as the electric field.
In Eq. 3 the mobility is related directly to the mean free time between collisions, which in turn is determined 
by the various scattering mechanisms. The two most important mechanisms are lattice scattering and impurity 
scattering. Lattice scattering results from thermal vibrations of the lattice atoms at any temperature above absolute 
zero. These vibrations disturb the lattice periodic potential and allow energy to be transferred between the carriers 
and the lattice. Since lattice vibration increases with increasing temperature, lattice scattering becomes dominant at 
high temperatures; hence the mobility decreases with increasing temperature. Theoretical analysis1 shows that the 
mobility due to lattice scattering μL will decrease in proportion to T–3/2.
Impurity scattering results when a charge carrier travels past an ionized dopant impurity (donor or acceptor). 
The charge carrier path will be deflected because of Coulomb force interaction. The probability of impurity 
scattering depends on the total concentration of ionized impurities, that is, the sum of the concentration of 
negatively and positively charged ions. However, unlike lattice scattering, impurity scattering becomes less 
significant at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures, the carriers move faster; they remain near the impurity 
atom for a shorter time and are therefore scattered less effectively. The mobility due to impurity scattering μI can be 
shown to vary as T3/2/NT, where NT is the total impurity concentration.2
The number of collisions taking place in a unit time, 1/τc, is the sum of the numbers of collisions due to the 
various scattering mechanisms:

Figure 2 shows the measured electron mobility as a function of temperature for silicon with five different 
donor concentrations.3 The inset shows the theoretical temperature dependence of mobility due to both lattice and 
impurity scatterings. For lightly doped samples (e.g., the sample with doping of 1014 cm–3), the lattice scattering 
dominates, and the mobility decreases as the temperature increases. For heavily doped samples, the effect of 
impurity scattering is most pronounced at low temperatures. The mobility increases as the temperature increases, 
as can be seen for the sample with doping of 1019 cm–3. For a given temperature, the mobility decreases with 
increasing impurity concentration because of enhanced impurity scatterings.

theoretical temperature dependence of electron mobility.
Figure 3 shows the measured mobilities and diffusivities in silicon and gallium arsenide as a function of 
impurity concentration at room temperature.3 Mobility reaches a maximum value at low impurity concentrations; 
this corresponds to the lattice-scattering limitation. Both electron and hole mobilities decrease with increasing 
impurity concentration and eventually approach a minimum value at high impurity concentrations. Note also 
that the mobility of electrons is greater than that of holes. Greater electron mobility is due mainly to the smaller 
effective mass of electrons.

2.1.2 Resistivity
We now consider conduction in a homogeneous semiconductor material. Figure 4a shows an n-type 
semiconductor and its band diagram at thermal equilibrium. Figure 4b shows the corresponding band diagram 
when a positive biasing voltage is applied to the right-hand terminal. We assume that the contacts at the left-hand 
and right-hand terminals are ohmic, that is, there is negligible voltage drop at each of the contacts. The behavior 
of ohmic contacts is considered in Chapter 7. As mentioned previously, when an electric field E is applied to a 
semiconductor, each electron will experience a force – qE from the field. The force is equal to the negative gradient 
of potential energy; that is,
 
– qE = – (gradient of electron potential energy) = 
dE
dx
C . 
(7)
Recall that in Chapter 1, the bottom of the conduction band EC corresponds to the potential energy of an 
electron. Since we are interested in the gradient of the potential energy, we can use any part of the band diagram 
that is parallel to EC (e.g., EF, Ei, or EV, as shown in Fig. 4b). It is convenient to use the intrinsic Fermi level Ei 
because we shall use Ei when we consider p–n junctions in Chapter 3. Therefore, from Eq. 7 we have

Comparison of Eqs. 8 and 9 gives
ψ = −E
q
i ,  
(10)
which provides a relationship between the electrostatic potential and the potential energy of an electron. For the 
homogeneous semiconductor shown in Fig. 4b, the potential energy and Ei, decrease linearly with distance; thus, 
the electric field is a constant in the negative x-direction. Its magnitude is the applied voltage divided by the sample 
length.
The electrons in the conduction band move to the right side, as shown in Fig. 4b. The kinetic energy 
corresponds to the distance from the band edge (i.e., EC for electrons). When an electron undergoes a collision, it 
loses some or all of its kinetic energy to the lattice and drops toward its thermal equilibrium position. After the 
electron has lost some or all its kinetic energy, it will again begin to move toward the right and the same process 
will be repeated many times. Conduction by holes can be visualized in a similar manner but in the opposite 
direction.
The transport of carriers under the influence of an applied electric field produces a current called the drift 
current. Consider a semiconductor sample shown in Fig. 5, that has a cross-sectional area A, a length L, and a 
carrier concentration of n electrons/cm3. Suppose we now apply an electric field E to the sample. The electron 
current density Jn flowing in the sample can be found by summing the product of the charge (-q) on each electron 
and the electron velocity over all electrons (n) per unit volume.

The most common method for measuring resistivity is the four-point probe method shown in Fig. 6. The 
probes are equally spaced. A small current I from a constant-current source is passed through the outer two probes 
and a voltage V is measured between the inner two probes. For a thin semiconductor sample with thickness W that 
is much smaller than the diameter d, the resistivity is given by

where CF is a well-documented “correction factor”. The correction factor depends on the ratio of d/s, where 
s is the probe spacing. When d/s > 20, the correction factor approaches 4.54. Figure 7 shows the measured 
room-temperature resistivity as a function of the impurity concentration for silicon and gallium arsenide. At 
this temperature and for low impurity concentrations, all donor (e.g., P and As in Si) or acceptor (e.g., B in Si) 
impurities that have shallow energy levels will be ionized. Under these conditions, the carrier concentration is equal 
to the impurity concentration. From these curves we can obtain the impurity concentration of a semiconductor if 
the resistivity is known, or vice versa.

2.1.3 The Hall Effect
The carrier concentration in a semiconductor may be different from the impurity concentration, because the 
ionized impurity density depends on the temperature and the impurity energy level. To measure the carrier 
concentration directly, the most common method is the Hall effect. Hall measurement is also one of the most 
convincing methods to show the existence of holes as charge carriers, because the measurement can

give the carrier type directly. Figure 8 shows an electric field applied along the x-axis and a magnetic field applied 
along the z-axis. Consider a p-type semiconductor sample. The Lorentz force qυ × B (= qx
z
B ) due to the 
magnetic field will exert an average upward force on the holes flowing in the x-direction. The upward Lorentz force 
causes an accumulation of holes at the top of the sample that gives rise to a downward-directed electric field Ey. 
Since there is no net current flow along the y-direction in the steady state, the electric field along the y-axis exactly 
balances the Lorentz force; that is,

Once the electric field Ey becomes equal to x

The establishment of the electric field is known as the Hall effect. The electric field in Eq. 18 is called the Hall 
field, and the terminal voltage VH = EyW (Fig. 8) is called the Hall-voltage. Using Eq. 12 for the hole drift velocity, 
the Hall field Ey in Eq. 18 becomes

2.2 CARRIER DIFFUSION
2.2.1 Diffusion Process 
In the preceding section, we considered the drift current, that is, the transport of carriers when an electric field is 
applied. Another important current component can exist if there is a spatial variation of carrier concentration 
in a semiconductor material. The carriers tend to move from a region of high concentration to a region of low 
concentration. This current component is called the diffusion current.
To understand the diffusion process, let us assume an electron density that varies in the x-direction, as shown 
in Fig. 9. The semiconductor is at uniform temperature, so that the average thermal energy of electrons does not 
vary with x; only the density n(x) varies. Consider the number of electrons crossing the plane at x = 0 per unit 
time and per unit area. Because of finite temperature, the electrons have random thermal motions with a thermal 
velocity th and a mean free path l  (note that th is the thermal velocity in the x-direction, l
th c
υ τ , where  c is the 
mean free time). The electrons at x
l, one mean free path away on the left side, have equal chances of moving 
left or right; and in a mean free time  c, one half of them will move across the plane x = 0. The average rate of 
electron flow per unit area F1 of electrons crossing plane x = 0 from the left is then

The diffusion current is proportional to the spatial derivative of the electron density. Diffusion current results 
from the random thermal motion of carriers in a concentration gradient. For an electron density that increases 
with x, the gradient is positive and the electrons will diffuse toward the negative x-direction. The current is positive 
and flows in the direction opposite to that of the electrons, as indicated in Fig. 9.

that characterize carrier transport by diffusion and by drift in a semiconductor. The Einstein relation also applies 
between Dp and μp. Values of diffusivities for silicon and gallium arsenide are shown in Fig. 3.

μpE should be replaced by the saturation velocity υs discussed in Section 2.7.

2.3 GENERATION AND RECOMBINATION PROCESSES 
In thermal equilibrium the relationship pn
ni
 = 
2 is valid. If excess carriers are introduced to a semiconductor 
so that pn
ni
 > 
2, we have a nonequilibrium situation. The process of introducing excess carriers is called carrier 
injection. Most semiconductor devices operate by the creation of charge carriers in excess of the thermal 
equilibrium values. We can introduce excess carriers by optical excitation or forward-biasing a p–n junction 
(discussed in Chapter 3).
Whenever the thermal-equilibrium condition is disturbed (i.e., pn ≠ ni
2), processes exist to restore the system 
to equilibrium (i.e., pn
ni
 = 
2). In the case of injection of excess carriers, the mechanism that restores equilibrium 
is recombination of the injected minority carriers with the majority carriers. Depending on the nature of the 
recombination process, the energy released from the recombination process can be emitted as a photon or 
dissipated as heat to the lattice. When a photon is emitted, the process is called radiative recombination; otherwise, 
it is called nonradiative recombination.
Recombination phenomena can be classified as direct and indirect processes. Direct recombination, also 
called band-to-band recombination, usually dominates in direct-bandgap semiconductors, such as gallium 
arsenide, whereas indirect recombination via bandgap recombination centers dominates in indirect-bandgap 
semiconductors, such as silicon.
2.3.1  Direct Recombination 
Consider a direct-bandgap semiconductor, such as GaAs, in thermal equilibrium. In terms of the band diagram, 
the thermal energy enables a valence electron to make an upward transition to the conduction band, leaving a hole 
in the valence band. This process is called carrier generation and is represented by the generation rate Gth (number 
of electron-hole pairs generated per cm3 per second) in Fig. 10a. When an electron makes a transition downward 
from the conduction band to the valence band, an electron-hole pair is annihilated. This reverse process is called 
recombination; it is represented by the recombination rate Rth in Fig. 10a. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, 
the generation rate Gth must equal the recombination rate Rth , so that the carrier concentrations remain constant 
and the condition pn = ni
2 is maintained.
When excess carriers are introduced to a direct-bandgap semiconductor, the probability is high that electrons 
and holes will recombine directly, because the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band 
have the same momentum and no additional momentum is required for the transition across the bandgap. The 
rate of the direct recombination R is expected to be proportional to the number of electrons available in the 
conduction band and the number of holes available in the valence band; that is,
 
R
p , 
(34)
where β is the proportionality constant. As discussed previously, in thermal equilibrium the recombination rate 
must be balanced by the generation rate. Therefore, for an n-type semiconductor, we have

In this notation for carrier concentrations the first subscript refers to the type of the semiconductor. The subscript 
o indicates an equilibrium quantity. The nno and pno represent electron and hole densities, respectively, in an n-type 
semiconductor at thermal equilibrium. When we shine a light on the semiconductor to produce electron-hole 
pairs at a rate GL (Fig. 10b), the carrier concentrations are above their equilibrium values. The recombination and 
generation rate become  
 
R = β nn pn = β (nno + Δn) (pno + Δp),

G = GL + Gth ,

where U is the net recombination rate. Substituting Eqs. 35 and 36 into Eq. 40 yields
 
U = β(nno + pno + Δp)Δp.

The physical meaning of lifetime can best be illustrated by the transient response of a device after the sudden

Figure 11b shows the variation of pn with time. The minority carriers recombine with majority carriers  
and decay exponentially with a time constant τp, which corresponds to the lifetime defined in Eq. 44. Note that  
pn (t→∞) = pno.
58 Semiconductors

This case illustrates the main idea of measuring the carrier lifetime using the photoconductivity method. 
Figure 11c shows a schematic setup. The excess carriers, generated uniformly throughout the sample by the light 
pulse, cause a momentary increase in the conductivity. The increase in conductivity manifests itself by a drop 
in voltage across the sample when a constant current is passed through it. The decay of the conductivity can be 
observed on an oscilloscope and is a measure of the lifetime of the excess minority carriers.

From the example, it is obvious that the excitation causes a large percentage change in the minority carrier 
concentration and almost no change in the majority concentration. The separation of the quasi-Fermi levels is 
a direct measure of the deviation from equilibrium. It is very useful to visualize majority and minority carrier 
concentrations varying with position in devices.
2.3.3  Indirect Recombination
For indirect-bandgap semiconductors, such as silicon, a direct recombination process is very unlikely, because the 
electrons at the bottom of the conduction band have nonzero momentum with respect to the holes at the top of 
the valence band (see Chapter 1). A direct transition that conserves both energy and momentum is not possible 
without a simultaneous lattice interaction. Therefore the dominant recombination process in such semiconductors 
is indirect transition via localized energy states in the forbidden energy gap.4 These states act as stepping stones 
between the conduction band and the valence band.
Figure 13 shows various transitions that occur in the recombination process through intermediate-level states 
(also called recombination centers). We illustrate the charging state of the center before and after each of the 
four basic transitions taking place. The arrows in the figure designate the transition of the electron in a particular 
process. The illustration is for the case of a recombination center with a single energy level that is neutral when 
not occupied by an electron and negative when it is occupied. In indirect recombination, the derivation of the 
recombination rate is more complicated; the detailed derivation is given in Appendix I. The recombination rate is 
given by

where υth is the thermal velocity of carriers given in Eq. 1, Nt is the concentration of the recombination center in 
the semiconductor, and σn is the electrons capture cross section. The quantity σn describes the effectiveness of the 
center in capturing an electron and is a measure of how close the electron has to come to the center to be captured. 
σp is the capture cross section of holes. Et is the energy level of the recombination center.
We can simplify the general expression for the dependence of U on Et by assuming equal electron and hole

Carrier Transport Phenomena 61

The recombination rate for indirect recombination is given by the same expression as Eq. 43; however, τp depends 
on the locations of the recombination centers in the bandgap.
2.3.4  Surface Recombination
Figure 14 shows schematically the bonds at a semiconductor surface.5 Because of the abrupt discontinuity of 
the lattice structure at the surface, a large number of localized energy states or generation-recombination centers 
may be introduced at the surface region. These energy states, called surface states, may greatly enhance the 
recombination rate at the surface region. The kinetics of surface recombination is similar to those considered 
before for bulk centers. The total number of carriers recombining at the surface per unit area in unit time can be 
expressed in a form analogous to Eq. 50. For a low-injection condition, and for the limiting case where an electron 
concentration at the surface is essentially equal to the bulk majority carrier concentration, the total number of 
carriers recombining at the surface per unit area and unit time can be simplified to
 
Us ≅ υthσp Nst(ps – pno), 
(53)
where ps denotes the hole concentrations at the surface, and Nst is the recombination center density per unit area 
in the surface region. Since the product υthσpNst has its dimension in centimeters per second, it is called the low-
injection surface recombination velocity Slr:
 
Slr ≡ υth σp Nst. 
(54)
 
2.4 CONTINUITY EQUATION
In the previous sections we considered individual effects such as drift due to an electric field, diffusion due to a 
concentration gradient, and recombination of carriers through intermediate-level recombination centers. We now 
consider the overall effect when drift, diffusion, and recombination occur simultaneously in a semiconductor 
material. The governing equation is called the continuity equation.
Fig. 14 Schematic diagram of bonds at a clean semiconductor surface. The bonds are anisotropic and 
differ from those in the bulk.5
62 Semiconductors

To derive the one-dimensional continuity equation for electrons, consider an infinitesimal slice with thickness 
dx located at x, as shown in Fig. 15. The number of electrons in the slice may increase due to the net current flow 
into the slice and the net carrier generation in the slice. The overall rate of electron increase is the algebraic sum of 
four components: the number of electrons flowing into the slice at x, minus the number of electrons flowing out 
at x + dx, plus the rate at which electrons are generated, minus the rate at which they are recombined with holes in 
the slice.
The first two components are found by dividing the currents at each side of the slice by the charge of an 
electron. The generation and recombination rates are designated by Gn and Rn , respectively. The overall rate of 
change in the number of electrons in the slice is then

the algebraic sum of the charge carrier densities and the ionized impurity concentrations, q (p – n + ND

).
In principle, Eqs. 59 through 61 together with appropriate boundary conditions have a unique solution. 
Because of the algebraic complexity of this set of equations, in most cases the equations are simplified with 
physical approximations before a solution is attempted. We solve the continuity equations for three important 
cases.
2.4.1 Steady-State Injection from One Side
Figure 16a shows an n-type semiconductor in which excess carriers are injected from one side as a result of 
illumination. It is assumed that light penetration is negligibly small (i.e., the assumptions of zero field and zero 
generation for x > 0). At steady state there is a concentration gradient near the surface. From Eq. 60

2.4.2  Minority Carriers at the Surface
When surface recombination is introduced at one end of a semiconductor sample under illumination (Fig. 17), 
the hole current density flowing into the surface from the bulk of the semiconductor is given by qUs. In this 
example, it is assumed that the sample is uniformly illuminated with uniform generation of carriers. The surface 
recombination leads to a lower carrier concentration at the surface. This gradient of hole concentration yields a 
diffusion current density that is equal to the surface recombination current. Therefore, the boundary condition at 
x = 0 is
Fig. 17 Surface recombination at x = 0. The minority carrier distribution near the surface is affected by 
the surface recombination velocity.6

2.4.3  The Haynes-Shockley Experiment
One of the classic experiments in semiconductor physics is the demonstration of drift and diffusion of minority 
carriers, first made by Haynes and Shockley.7 The experiment allows independent measurement of the minority 
carrier mobility μ and diffusion coefficient D. The basic setup of the Haynes–Shockley experiment is shown in Fig. 
18a. When localized light pulses generate excess minority carriers in a semiconductor, the transport equation after 
a pulse is given by Eq. 60 by setting Gp = 0 and ∂E/∂x = 0:

If an electric field is applied along the sample, the solution is in the form of Eq. 71, but with x replaced by  
x – μpEt (Fig. 18c); thus the whole “package” of excess minority carrier moves toward the negative end of the 
sample with the drift velocity μpE. At the same time, the carriers diffuse outward and recombine as in the field-free 
case. With a known sample length, applied oscilloscope), the drift field, and the time delay between the applied 
electric pulse and the detected pulse (both displayed on the mobility μp = L/Et can be calculated.

Carrier Transport Phenomena 67

 
2.5 THERMIONIC EMISSION PROCESS
In previous sections, we considered carrier transport phenomena inside the bulk semiconductor. At the 
semiconductor surface, carriers may recombine via the recombination centers due to the dangling bonds at the 
surface region. In addition, if the carriers have sufficient energy, they may be “thermionically” emitted into the 
vacuum. This is called the thermionic emission process.
Figure 19a shows the band diagram of an isolated n-type semiconductor. The electron affinity, qχ, is the 
energy difference between the conduction band edge and the vacuum level in the semiconductor; the work 
function, qϕs, is the energy between the Fermi level and the vacuum level in the semiconductor. From Fig. 19b, it is 
clear that an electron can be thermionically emitted into the vacuum if its energy is above qχ.
The electron density with energies above qχ can be obtained from an expression similar to that for the electron 
density in the conduction band (Eqs. 6 and 13 of Chapter 1) except that the lower limit of the integration is qχ 
instead of EC:

Calculate the thermionically emitted electron density, nth, at room temperature for an n-type silicon sample with an

From the above example, we see that at 300 K there is no emission of electrons into vacuum for qχ = 4.05 
eV. However, if we can lower the effective electron affinity to 0.6 eV, a substantial number of electrons can be 
thermionically emitted. The thermionic emission process is of particular importance for metal-semiconductor 
contacts, to be considered in Chapter 7.
 
2.6 TUNNELING PROCESS
Figure 20a shows the energy band diagram when two isolated semiconductor samples are brought close together. 
The distance between them is d and the potential barrier height qV0 is equal to the electron affinity qχ. If the 
distance is sufficiently small, the electrons in the left-side semiconductor may transport across the barrier and 
move to the right-side semiconductor, even if the electron energy is much less than the barrier height. This process 
is associated with the quantum tunneling phenomenon.
Based on Fig. 20a, we have redrawn the one-dimensional potential barrier diagram in Fig. 20b.  We first 
consider the transmission (or tunneling) coefficient of a particle (e.g., electron) through this barrier. In the 
corresponding classic case, the particle is always reflected if its energy E is less than the potential barrier height 
qV0. However, in the quantum case, the particle has finite probability to transmit or “tunnel” through the potential 
barrier.
The behavior of a particle (e.g., a conduction electron) in the region where qV(x) = 0 can be described by the

2.7  SPACE-CHARGE EFFECT
The space charge in a semiconductor is determined by both the ionized impurity concentrations (ND
+ and NA
–) and 
the carrier concentrations (n and p), 
 
ρ = q (p – n + ND
+ – NA
–) 
(82)
In the neutral region of a semiconductor, n = ND
+ and p = NA
–, the space-charge density is zero. If we inject 
electrons into an n-type semiconductor (with ND
+ >> NA
– ≈ p ≈ 0) so that the electron concentration n is much 
larger than ND
+, the space-charge density is no longer zero (i.e., ρ ≈ –qn). The injected carrier density will effectively 
be the space-charge density, which will in turn determine the electric-field distribution from Poisson’s equation. 
This is the space-charge effect.
In the presence of a space-charge effect, if the current is dominated by the drift component of the injected 
carriers, it is called the space-charge-limited current. Figure 21a shows the band diagram for the case of electron 
injection; the drift current is given by
 
J = qnυ . 
(83)
The space charge is determined by the injected carriers (assuming n >> ND

In the velocity-saturation regime, Eq. 83 becomes J = qnυs, where υs is the saturation velocity. Substituting

2.8 HIGH-FIELD EFFECTS
At low electric-fields, the drift velocity is linearly proportional to the applied field. We assume that the time 
interval between collisions, τc, is independent of the applied field. This is a reasonable assumption as long as the 
drift velocity is small compared with the thermal velocity of carriers, which is about 107 cm/s for silicon at room 
temperature.
As the drift velocity approaches the thermal velocity, its field dependence on the electric field will begin to 
depart from the linear relationship given in Section 2.1. Figure 22 shows the measured drift velocities of electrons 
and holes in silicon as a function of the electric field. It is apparent that initially the field dependence of the drift 
velocity is linear, corresponding to a constant mobility. As the electric field is increased, the drift velocity increases 
less rapidly. At sufficiently large fields, the drift velocity approaches a saturation velocity. The experimental results 
can be approximated by the empirical expression8

where υs is the saturation velocity (107cm/s for Si at 300 K), E0 is a constant, equal to 7 × 103 V/cm for electrons 
and 2 × 104 V/cm for holes in high-purity silicon materials, and γ is 2 for electrons and 1 for holes. Velocity 
saturation at high fields is particularly likely for field-effect transistors (FETs) with very short channels. Even 
moderate voltage can result in a high field along the channel. This effect is discussed in Chapter 5 and 6.

The high-field transport in n-type gallium arsenide is different from that of silicon.9 Figure 23 shows the 
measured drift velocity versus field for n-type and p-type gallium arsenide. The results for silicon are also shown in 
this log-log plot for comparison. Note that for n-type GaAs, the drift velocity reaches a maximum, then decreases 
as the field further increases. This phenomenon is due to the energy-band structure of gallium arsenide, which 
allows the transfer of conduction electrons from a high-mobility energy minimum (called a valley) to low-mobility, 
higher-energy satellite valleys, that is, electron transfer from the central valley to the satellite valleys along the [111] 
direction shown in Fig. 14 of Chapter 1. This is called the transferred-electron effect.
To understand this phenomenon, consider the simple two-valley model of n-type gallium arsenide shown 
in Fig. 24. The energy separation between the two valleys is ΔE = 0.31 eV. The lower valley’s electron effective 
mass is denoted by m1, the electron mobility by μ1, and the electron density by n1. The upper-valley quantities are 
denoted by m2, μ2, and n2, respectively, and the total electron concentration is given by n = n1 + n2. The steady-state 
conductivity of the n-type GaAs can be written as

For simplicity we make the following assignments for the electron concentrations in the various ranges of 
electric-field values illustrated in Fig. 24. In Fig. 24a, the field is low and all electrons remain in the lower valley. In 
Fig. 24b, the field is higher and some electrons gain sufficient energies from the field to move to the higher valley. 
In Fig. 24c, the field is high enough to transfer all electrons to the higher valley. Thus, we have

If μ1Ea is larger than μ2Eb, there is a region in which the drift velocity decreases with increasing field between

material is used in the microwave transferred-electron devices discussed in Chapter 8.

Carrier Transport Phenomena 75

When the electric field in a semiconductor is increased above a certain value, the carriers gain enough 
kinetic energy to generate electron-hole pairs by the avalanche process shown schematically in Fig. 26. Consider 
an electron in the conduction band (designated by 1). If the electric field is high enough, this electron can gain 
kinetic energy before it collides with a valence electron. The high-energy electron in the conduction band can 
transfer some of its kinetic energy to the valence electron to make an upward transition to the conduction band. 
An electron-hole pair is generated (designated by 2 and 2′). Similarly, the generated pair begins to accelerate in the 
field and collides with other valence electrons, as indicated in the figure. In turn, they will generate other electron-
hole pairs (e.g., 3 and 3′, 4 and 4′), and so on. This process is called the avalanche process; it is also referred to as 
the impact ionization process. This process will result in breakdown in the p–n junction as discussed in Chapter 3.
To gain some ideas about the ionization energy involved, let us consider the process leading to 2–2′ shown in 
Fig. 26. Just prior to the collision, the fast-moving electron (no. 1) has a kinetic energy m1υs
2/2 and a momentum 
m1υs, where m1 is the effective mass and υs is the electron velocity. After collision, there are three carriers: the 
original electron plus an electron–hole pair (no. 2 and no. 2′). If we assume that the three carriers have the same 
effective mass, the same kinetic energy, and the same momentum, the total kinetic energy is 3/2m1υf
2, and the total 
momentum is 3m1υf, where υf is the velocity after collision. To conserve both energy and momentum before and 
after the collision, we require that

It is obvious that E0 must be larger than the bandgap for the ionization process to occur. The actual energy 
required depends on the band structure. For silicon, the value for E0 is 1.6 eV (1.5 Eg) for electrons and ~2.0  
eV (1.8 Eg) for holes.
The number of electron-hole pairs generated by an electron per unit distance traveled is called the ionization 
rate for the electron, αn. Similarly, αp is the ionization rate for the holes. The measured ionization rates for silicon 
and gallium arsenide are shown9 in Fig. 27. We note that both αn and αp are strongly dependent on the electric 
field. For a substantially large ionization rate (say 104 cm–1), the corresponding electric field is ≥ 3 × 105 V/cm for 
silicon and ≥ 4 × 105 V/cm for gallium arsenide. The electron-hole pair generation rate GA from the avalanche

SUMMARY
Various transport processes are at work in semiconductor devices. These include drift, diffusion, generation, 
recombination, thermionic emission, tunneling, space-charge effect, and impact ionization.
One of the key transport processes is the carrier drift under the influence of an electric field. At low fields, 
the drift velocity is proportional to the electric field. This proportionality constant is called mobility. Another 
key transport process is the carrier diffusion under the influence of the carrier concentration gradient. The total 
current is the sum of the drift and diffusion components.
Carrier Transport Phenomena 77

Excess carriers in a semiconductor cause a nonequilibrium condition. Most semiconductor devices operate 
under nonequilibrium conditions. Carriers can be generated by various means such as forward biasing a p–n 
junction, incident light, and impact ionization. The mechanism that restores equilibrium is the recombination 
of the excess minority carriers with the majority carriers by direct band-to-band recombination or via localized 
energy states in the forbidden energy gap. The governing equation for the rate of change of charge carriers is the 
continuity equation.
Among other transport processes, thermionic emission occurs when carriers in the surface region gain enough 
energy to be emitted into the vacuum level. Another, the tunneling process, is based on the quantum tunneling 
phenomena that results in the transport of electrons across a potential barrier even if the electron energy is smaller 
than the barrier height. In addition, we have the space-charge-limited current when the injected carriers are not 
compensated by the ionized impurities in the semiconductor.
As the electric field becomes higher, the drift velocity in silicon departs from its linear relationship with the 
applied field and approaches a saturation velocity. This effect is particularly important in the short-channel silicon 
field-effect transistors discussed in Chapter 5 and 6. The drift velocity in n-type GaAs reaches a maximum and 
then decreases as the field further increases. This is due to the transferred-electron effect, and the material is used 
in microwave devices discussed in Chapter 8. When the field exceeds a certain value, the carriers gain enough 
kinetic energy to generate electron-hole pair through Coulombic interaction. This effect is particularly important 
in the study of p–n junctions. The high field accelerates these new electron-hole pairs, which collide with the lattice 
to create more electron-hole pairs. As this process, called impact ionization or the avalanche process, continues, the 
p–n junction breaks down and conducts a large current. The junction breakdown is discussed in Chapter 3.

SUMMARY
In the preceding chapters we considered the carrier concentrations and transport phenomena in homogeneous 
semiconductor materials. In this chapter we discuss the behavior of single-crystal semiconductor material 
containing both p- and n-type regions that form a p–n junction. 
A p–n junction serves an important role both in modern electronic applications and in understanding 
other semiconductor devices. It is used extensively in rectification, switching, and other operations in electronic 
circuits. It is a key building block for the bipolar transistor and thyristor (Chapter 4), as well as for metal-oxide-
semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) (Chapters 5 and 6). Given proper biasing conditions or when 
exposed to light, the p–n junction also functions as either a microwave (Chapter 8) or photonic device (Chapters 9 
and 10).
We also consider a related device—the heterojunction, which is a junction formed between two dissimilar 
semiconductors. It has many unique features that are not readily available from the conventional p–n junction. 
The heterojunction is an important building block for heterojunction bipolar transistors (Chapter 4), modulation 
doped field-effect transistors (Chapter 7), quantum-effect devices (Chapter 8), and photonic devices (Chapters 9 
and 10).
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
The band diagram of a p–n junction at thermal equilibrium.
r
The behavior of the junction depletion layer under voltage biases.
r
 The current transport in a p–n junction and the influence of the generation and  
recombination processes.
r
The charge storage in a p–n junction and its influence on the transient behavior.
r
 The avalanche multiplication in a p–n junction and its impact on the maximum     
reverse voltage
r
The heterojunction and its basic characteristics.

Fig. 1 Current-voltage characteristics of a typical silicon p–n junction.
 
3.1 THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM CONDITION
Today, planar technology is used extensively for p–n junction and integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. The planar 
processes include oxidation, lithography, ion implantation, and metallization; they will be discussed in Chapters 
11-15. The most important characteristic of p–n junctions is that they rectify: that is, they allow current to flow 
easily in only one direction. Figure 1 shows the current-voltage characteristics of a typical silicon p–n junction. 
When we apply “forward bias” to the junction (i.e., positive voltage on the p-side), the current increases rapidly as 
the voltage increases. However, when we apply a “reverse bias,” virtually no current flows initially. As the reverse 
bias is increased the current remains very small until a critical voltage is reached, at which point the current 
suddenly increases. This sudden increase in current is referred to as the junction breakdown. The applied forward 
voltage is usually less than 1V, but the reverse critical voltage, or breakdown voltage, can vary from just a few volts 
to many thousands of volts, depending on the doping concentration and other device parameters.
1.1.1 
Band Diagram
In Fig. 2a, we see two regions of p- and n-type semiconductor materials that are uniformly doped and physically 
separated before the junction is formed. Note that the Fermi level EF is near the valence band edge in the p-type 
material and near the conduction band edge in the n-type material. While p-type material contains a large 
concentration of holes with few electrons, the opposite is true for n-type material.
Fig. 2 (a) Uniformly doped p-type and n-type semiconductors before the junction is formed. (b) The electric  
field in the depletion region and the energy band diagram of a p–n junction in thermal equilibrium.
p–n Junction 83

When the p- and n-type semiconductors are jointed together, the large carrier concentration gradients at the 
junction cause carrier diffusion. Holes from the p-side diffuse into the n-side, and electrons from the n-side diffuse 
into the p-side.  As holes continue to leave the p-side, some of the negative acceptor ions (NA
–) near the junction 
are left uncompensated because the acceptors are fixed in the semiconductor lattice, whereas the holes are mobile. 
Similarly, some of the positive donor ions (ND
+) near the junction are left uncompensated as the electrons leave 
the n-side. Consequently, a negative space charge forms near the p-side of the junction and a positive space charge 
forms near the n-side. This space charge region creates an electric field that is directed from the positive charge 
toward the negative charge, as indicated in the upper illustration of Fig. 2b. 
The electric field is in the direction opposite to the diffusion current for each type of charge carrier. The lower 
illustration of Fig. 2b shows that the hole diffusion current flows from left to right, whereas the hole drift current 
due to the electric field flows from right to left. The electron diffusion current also flows from left to right, whereas 
the electron drift current flows in the opposite direction. Note that because of their negative charge, electrons 
diffuse from right to left, opposite to the direction of electron current.
3.1.2 
Equilibrium Fermi Levels
At thermal equilibrium, i.e. the steady-state condition at a given temperature with no external excitations, the 
individual electron and hole currents flowing across the junctions are identically zero. Thus, for each type of 
carrier the drift current due to the electric field must exactly cancel the diffusion current due to the concentration 
gradient. From Eq. 32 in Chapter 2,

Thus, for the condition of zero net electron and hole currents, the Fermi level must be constant (i.e., 
independent of x) throughout the sample, as illustrated in the energy band diagram of Fig. 2b.
The constant Fermi level required at thermal equilibrium results in a unique space charge distribution at the 
junction. We repeat the one-dimensional p–n junction and the corresponding equilibrium energy band diagram in 
Figs. 3a and 3b, respectively. The unique space charge distribution and the electrostatic potential ψ are given by

3.1.3 
Space Charge
Moving from a neutral region toward the junction, we encounter the narrow transition region shown in Fig. 3c. 
Here the space charge of impurity ions is partially compensated by the mobile carriers. Beyond the transition 
region we enter the completely depleted region where the mobile carrier densities are zero. This is called the 
depletion region (also the space-charge region). For typical p–n junctions in silicon and gallium arsenide, the width 
of each transition region is small compared with the width of the depletion region. Therefore, we can neglect the 
transition region and represent the depletion region by the rectangular distribution shown in Fig. 3d, where xp 
and xn denote the depletion layer widths of the p- and n-sides for the completely depleted region with p = n = 0. 
Equation 7 becomes

3.2 DEPLETION REGION
To solve Poisson’s equation (Eq. 13) we must know the impurity distribution. In this section we consider two 
important cases—the abrupt junction and the linearly graded junction. Figure 5a shows an abrupt junction, that 
is, a p–n junction formed by shallow diffusion or low-energy ion implantation. The impurity distribution of 
the junction can be approximated by an abrupt transition of doping concentration between the n- and p-type 
regions. Figure 5b shows a linearly graded junction. For either deep diffusions or high-energy ion implantations, 
the impurity profiles may be approximated by linearly graded junctions: that is, the impurity distribution varies 
linearly across the junction. We consider the depletion regions of both types of junction.

p–n Junction 89

When the impurity concentration on one side of an abrupt junction is much higher than that on the other 
side, the junction is called a one-sided abrupt junction (Fig. 7a). Figure 7b shows the space charge distribution of 
a one-sided abrupt p+–n junction, where NA >> ND. In this case, the depletion layer width of the p-side is much 
smaller than that of the n-side (i.e., xp << xn), and the expression for W can be simplified to

The previous discussions are for a p–n junction at thermal equilibrium without external bias. The equilibrium 
energy band diagram, shown again in Fig. 8a, illustrates that the total electrostatic potential across the junction 
is Vbi. The corresponding potential energy difference from the p-side to the n-side is qVbi. If we apply a positive 
voltage VF to the p-side with respect to the n-side, the p–n junction becomes forward-biased, as shown in Fig. 
8b. The total electrostatic potential across the junction decreases by VF; that is, it is replaced with Vbi – VF. Thus, 
forward bias reduces the depletion layer width.
By contrast, as shown in Fig. 8c, if we apply positive voltage VR to the n-side with respect to the p-side, the 
p–n junction now becomes reverse-biased and the total electrostatic potential across the junction increases by VR: 
that is, it is replaced by Vbi + VR. Here, we find that reverse bias increases the depletion layer width. Substituting 
these voltage values in Eq. 21 yields the depletion layer widths as a function of the applied voltage for a one-sided 
abrupt junction:

the junction.

Solving the transcendental equation that results when W is eliminated from Eqs. 31 and 32 yields the built-in 
potential as a function of a. The results for silicon and gallium arsenide linearly graded junctions are shown in Fig. 
10.
When either forward or reverse bias is applied to the linearly graded junction, the variations of the depletion 
layer width and the energy band diagram will be similar to those shown in Fig. 8 for abrupt junctions. However, 
the depletion layer width will vary as (Vbi – V)1/3, where V is positive for forward bias and negative for reverse bias.
 EXAMPLE 3
For a silicon linearly graded junction with an impurity gradient of 1020 cm–4, calculate the depletion-layer width 
and the maximum field and built-in voltage (T = 300 K).
SOLUTION  To solve the transcendental equation of Eq. 32, we can use a simple numeric method to find the built-in 
potential Vbi and the depletion layer width W simultaneously. We start with a reasonable Vbi value, e.g., 0.3 V, to 
calculate W by Eq. 31. W is 0.619 μm. Then, W and a are substituted in Eq. 32 to obtain Vbi.  Vbi is 0.657 V. This 
Vbi value is substituted in Eq. 31 to obtain a new W, and in turn to calculate a new Vbi. After several trials as shown 
in the following table, we obtain the final Vbi of 0.671 V and W of 0.809 μm.

3.3   DEPLETION CAPACITANCE
The junction depletion-layer capacitance per unit area is defined as Cj = dQ/dV, where dQ is the incremental 
change in depletion-layer charge per unit area for an incremental change in the applied voltage dV.*
Figure 11 illustrates the depletion capacitance of a p–n junction with an arbitrary impurity distribution. The 
charge and electric-field distributions indicated by the solid lines correspond to a voltage V applied to the n-side. If 
this voltage is increased by an amount dV, the charge and field distributions will expand to those regions bounded 
by the dashed lines. 
In Fig. 11b, the incremental charge dQ corresponds to the colored area between the two charge distribution 
curves on either side of the depletion region. The incremental space charges on the n- and p-sides of the depletion 
region are equal but with an opposite charge polarity, thus maintaining overall charge neutrality. This incremental 
charge dQ causes an increase in the electric field by an amount dE = dQ/εs (from Poisson’s equation). The 
corresponding change in the applied voltage dV, represented by the colored area in Fig. 11c, is approximately WdE, 
which equals WdQ/ εs. Therefore, the depletion capacitance per unit area is given by

3.3.1 
Capacitance-Voltage Characteristics
Equation 33 for the depletion capacitance per unit area is the same as the standard expression for a parallel-plate 
capacitor where the spacing between the two plates represents the depletion-layer width. The equation is valid for 
any arbitrary impurity distribution.
In deriving Eq. 33 we have assumed that only the variation of the space charge in the depletion region 
contributes to the capacitance. This certainly is a good assumption for the reverse-bias condition. For forward 
biases, however, a large current can flow across the junction, corresponding to a large number of mobile carriers 
present within the neutral region. The incremental change of these mobile carriers with respect to the biasing 
voltage contributes an additional term, called the diffusion capacitance, which is considered in Section 3.5.

It is clear from Eq. 35 that a plot of 1/Cj
2 versus V produces a straight line for a one-sided abrupt junction. The 
slope gives the impurity concentration NB of the substrate, and the intercept (at 1/Cj
2 = 0) gives Vbi.
 EXAMPLE 4
For a silicon one-sided abrupt junction with NA = 2 × 1019 cm–3 and ND = 8 × 1015 cm–3, calculate the junction 
capacitance at zero bias and a reverse bias of 4 V (T = 300 K).

Evaluation of Impurity Distribution
The capacitance-voltage characteristics can be used to evaluate an arbitrary impurity distribution. We consider the 
case of p+–n junction with a doping profile on the n-side, as shown in Fig. 12a. As before, the

incremental change in depletion layer charge per unit area dQ for an incremental change in the applied voltage dV 
is given by qN(W )dW (i.e., the shaded area in Fig. 12b). The corresponding change in applied voltage (shaded area 
in Fig. 12c) is

Thus, we can measure the capacitance per unit area versus reverse-bias voltage and plot 1/Cj
2 versus V. The 
slope of the plot, that is, d (1/Cj
2)/dV, yields N(W). Simultaneously, W is obtained from Eq. 33. A series of such 
calculations produces a complete impurity profile. This approach is referred to as the C–V method for measuring 
impurity profiles.

3.3.3 
Varactor
Many circuit applications employ the voltage-variable properties of reverse-biased p–n junctions. A p–n junction 
designed for such a purpose is called a varactor, which is a shortened form of variable reactor. As previously 
derived (Eq. 34 for abrupt and Eq. 38 for linearly graded junctions), the reverse-biased depletion capacitance is 
given by

where n = 1/3 for a linearly graded junction and n = 1/2 for an abrupt junction. Therefore, the voltage sensitivity of 
C (i.e., variation of C with VR) is greater for an abrupt junction than for a linearly graded junction. We can further 
increase the voltage sensitivity by using a hyperabrupt junction having an exponent n (Eq. 39) greater than 1/2.
Figure 13 shows three p+–n doping profiles with the donor distribution ND(x) given by B(x/x0)m, where B 
and x0 are constants, m = 1 for  a  linearly  graded  junction,  m = 0  for  an abrupt junction,  and m = –3/2 for  
a  hyperabrupt  junction. The hyperabrupt profile can be achieved by epitaxial growth techniques discussed in 
Chapter 11. To obtain the capacitance-voltage relationship, we solve the equation:

Comparing Eq. 42 with Eq. 39a yields n = l/(m + 2). For hyperabrupt junctions with n > 1/2, m must be a negative 
number.
By choosing different values for m, we can obtain a wide variety of Cj-versus-VR dependencies for specific 
applications. One interesting example, shown in Fig. 13, is the case for m = –3/2. For this case, n = 2. When this 
varactor is connected to an inductor L in a resonant circuit, the resonant frequency varies linearly with the voltage

3.4 CURRENT-VOLTAGE CHARACTERISTICS
A voltage applied to a p-n junction will disturb the precise balance between the diffusion current and drift current of 
electrons and holes. Under forward bias, the applied voltage reduces the electrostatic potential across the depletion 
region, as shown in the middle of Fig. 14a. More electrons in the high-energy tail of the n-side conduction band 
shown in Fig. 22d in Chapter 1 have enough energy to surmount the smaller barrier and diffuse from the n-side to 
p-side. Similarly, holes in the p-side valence band diffuse to the n-side over the smaller barrier. Therefore, minority 
carrier injections occur, that is, electrons are injected into the p-side, whereas holes are injected into the n-side. Under 
reverse bias, the applied voltage increases the electrostatic potential across the depletion region, as shown in the 
middle of Fig. 14b. This greatly reduces the diffusion currents.  For the drift current, it is almost the same despite 
the barrier change. Because a low concentration of minority electrons or holes in the p or n side that wander into the 
transition region will drift into the n or p side, the drift current depends mainly on the number of minority carriers, 
which travel at almost their saturation velocity. The drift current and the diffusion current coexist in the depletion 
region and make it more difficult to derive the current equations. Therefore, we derive the current equations only 
by the diffusion equations outside the depletion region. In this section, we first consider the ideal current-voltage 
characteristics. We then discuss departures from these ideal characteristics due to generation, recombination, and 
other effects.
 
3.4.1 Ideal Characteristics
We now derive the ideal current-voltage characteristics based on the following assumptions: (a) the depletion 
region has abrupt boundaries and, outside the boundaries, the semiconductor is assumed to be neutral; (b) the 
carrier densities at the boundaries are related by the electrostatic potential difference across the junction; (c) the 
low-injection condition, that is, the injected minority carrier densities are small compared with the majority carrier 
densities (in other words, the majority carrier densities are changed negligibly at the boundaries of neutral regions 
by the applied bias); (d) neither generation nor recombination current exists in the depletion region and the electron 
and hole currents are constant throughout the depletion region. Departures from these idealized assumptions are 
considered in the next section.
At thermal equilibrium, the majority carrier density in the neutral regions is essentially equal to the doping 
concentration. We use the subscripts n and p to denote the semiconductor type and the subscript o to specify the 
condition of thermal equilibrium. Hence, nno and npo are the equilibrium electron densities in the n- and p-sides, 
respectively. The expression for the built-in potential in Eq. 12 can be rewritten as

We note from Eqs. 45 and 46 that the electron density and the hole density at the two boundaries of the depletion 
region are related through the electrostatic potential difference Vbi at thermal equilibrium. From our second 
assumption we expect that the same relation holds when the electrostatic potential difference is changed by an 
applied voltage. 
When a forward bias is applied, the electrostatic potential difference is reduced to Vbi – VF ; but when a reverse 
bias is applied, the electrostatic potential difference is increased to Vbi + VR. Thus, Eq. 45 is modified to

where nn and np are the nonequilibrium electron densities at the boundaries of the depletion region in the n- and

the injected minority carrier density is much smaller than the majority carrier density; therefore, nn ≅ nno.

at x = xn for the n-type boundary. Figure 14 shows band diagrams and carrier concentrations in a p–n junction 
under forward-bias and reverse-bias conditions. Note that the minority carrier densities at the boundaries (–xp and 
xn) increase substantially above their equilibrium values under forward bias, whereas they decrease below their 
equilibrium values under reverse bias. Equations 48 and 49 define the minority carrier densities at the boundaries 
of depletion region. These equations are the most important boundary conditions for the ideal current-voltage 
characteristics. In the depletion region, the slopes of carrier distributions decrease with the forward bias, as shown 
in Fig. 14. This comes from the fast sweep of the carriers across the narrower depletion width. 
Under our idealized assumptions, no current is generated within the depletion region; all currents come from 
the neutral regions. In the neutral n-region, there is no electric field, thus the steady-state continuity equation

The hole and electron currents at the boundaries are given by Eqs. 52 and 54, respectively. The hole diffusion 
current will decay exponentially in the n-region with diffusion length Lp, and the electron diffusion current will 
decay exponentially in the p-region with diffusion length Ln.

with positive bias on the p-side, for V ≥ 3kT/q, the rate of current increase is constant, as shown in Fig. 16b. At 300 
K for every decade change of current, the voltage change for an ideal diode is 60 mV (= 2.3 kT/q). In the reverse 
direction, the current density saturates at –Js.

The current is small if the forward bias is less than (EF   – EV)/q. The current increases rapidly if the forward 
bias is slightly higher than (EF   – EV)/q. This is the cut-in voltage, which is slightly less than the bandgap value in 
electron volts, as shown in Fig. 1. Basically, the cut-in voltage increases with the bandgap.

Generation-Recombination and High-Injection Effects
The ideal diode equation, Eq. 55, adequately describes the current-voltage characteristics of germanium p–n 
junctions at low current densities. For silicon and gallium arsenide p–n junctions, however, the ideal equation can 
give only qualitative agreement because of the generation or recombination of carriers in the depletion region.
Consider the reverse-bias condition first. Under reverse bias, carrier concentrations in the depletion region 
fall far below their equilibrium concentrations. The dominant generation-recombination processes discussed 
in Chapter 2 are those of electron and hole emissions through bandgap generation-recombination centers. The 
capture processes are not important because their rates are proportional to the concentration of free carriers, 
which is very small in the reverse-biased depletion region.
The two emission processes operate in the steady state by alternately emitting electrons and holes. The rate of 
electron-hole pair generation can be obtained from Eq. 50 of Chapter 2 with the conditions pn < ni and nn < ni :

The generation rate reaches a maximum value at Et = Ei and falls off exponentially as Et moves in either direction 
away from the middle of the bandgap. Thus, only those centers with an energy level of Et near the intrinsic Fermi

VR > 3kT/q, can be approximated by the sum of the diffusion current in the neutral regions and the generation 
current in the depletion region:

For semiconductors with large values of ni, such as germanium, the diffusion current dominates at room

arsenide, the generation current in the depletion region may dominate.

If we apply a reversed bias of 4 V, the generation current density is 2.66 × 10–7 A/cm2. 
Under forward bias, the concentrations of both electrons and holes exceed their equilibrium values. The

where the factor η is called the ideality factor. When the ideal diffusion current dominates, η = 1; whereas when the 
recombination current dominates, η = 2. When the two currents are comparable, η has a value between 1 and 2.
Figure 17 shows the measured forward characteristics of a silicon and gallium arsenide p–n junction at room 
temperature.2 At low current levels, recombination current dominates and η = 2. At higher current levels, diffusion 
current dominates and η approaches 1.
At even higher current levels, we notice that the current departs from the ideal η = 1 situation and increases 
more gradually with forward voltage. This phenomenon is associated with two effects: series resistance and high 
injection. We first consider the series resistance effect. At both low- and medium-current levels, the IR drop across 
the neutral regions is usually small compared with kT/q (26 mV at 300 K), where I is the forward current and R 
is the series resistance. For example, for a silicon diode with R = 1.5 ohms, the IR drop at 1 mA is only 1.5 mV. 
However, at 100 mA, the IR drop becomes 0.15 V, which is six times larger than kT/q. This IR drop reduces the 
bias across the depletion region; therefore, the current becomes

and the ideal diffusion current is reduced by the factor exp[q(IR)/kT].
At high-current densities, the injected minority carrier density is comparable to the majority concentration; 
that is, at the n-side of the junction, pn (x = xn) ≅ nn. This is the high-injection condition. By substituting the high-
injection condition in Eq. 60, we obtain pn (x = xn) ≅ ni exp (qV/2kT). Using this as a boundary condition, the 
current becomes roughly proportional to exp (qV/2kT). Thus, the current increases at a slower rate under the high-
injection condition.
3.4.3 
Temperature Effect
Operating temperature has a profound effect on device performance. In both the forward-bias and reverse-bias 
conditions, the magnitudes of the diffusion and the recombination-generation currents depend strongly on 
temperature. We consider the forward-bias case first. The ratio of hole diffusion current to the recombination is 
given by

This ratio depends on both the temperature and the semiconductor bandgap. Figure 18a shows the temperature 
dependence of the forward characteristics of a silicon diode. At room temperature for small forward voltages, 
the recombination current generally dominates, whereas at higher forward voltages the diffusion current usually 
dominates. At a given forward bias, as the temperature increases, the diffusion current will increase more rapidly 
than the recombination current. Therefore, the ideal diode equation will be followed over a wide range of forward 
biases as the temperature increases.

This ratio is proportional to the intrinsic carrier density ni. As the temperature increases, the diffusion current 
eventually dominates. Figure 18b shows the effects of temperature on the reverse characteristics of a silicon 
diode. At low temperatures, the generation current dominates and the reverse current varies as VR  in accordance 
with Eq. 58 for an abrupt junction  (i.e.,  W ~ VR ).  As the temperature  increases beyond 175°C, the current 
demonstrates a saturation tendency for VR ≥ 3kT/q, at which point the diffusion current becomes dominant.
 
3.5 CHARGE STORAGE AND TRANSIENT BEHAVIOR
Under forward bias, electrons are injected from the n-region into the p-region and holes are injected from the 
p-region into the n-region. Once injected across the junction, the minority carriers recombine with the majority 
carriers and decay exponentially with distance, as shown in Fig. 15a. These minority-carrier distributions lead 
to current flow and to charge storage in the p–n junction. We consider the stored charge, its effect on junction 
capacitance, and the transient behavior of the p–n junction due to sudden changes of bias.
108 Semiconductors

3.5.1 
Minority-Carrier Storage
The charge of injected minority carriers per unit area stored in the neutral n-region can be found by integrating the 
excess holes in the neutral region, shown as the shaded area in the middle of Fig. 15a, using Eq. 51:

Lp is the average distance of a hole diffusion before recombining. The stored charge can be regarded as the hole 
diffusion with an average distance of Lp away from the boundary of the depletion region. The number of stored 
minority carriers depends on both the diffusion length and the charge density at the boundary of the depletion 
region. A similar expression can be obtained for the stored electrons in the neutral p-region. We can express the 
stored charge in terms of the injected current. From Eqs. 52 and 75, we have

The average lifetime of holes in n-side is τp. Thus, the stored charges Qp must be replenished every τp seconds. 
Equation 76 states that the amount of stored charge depends on the current and lifetime of the minority carriers. 
 EXAMPLE 7
For an ideal abrupt silicon p+–n junction with ND = 8 × 1015 cm–3, calculate the stored minority carriers per unit 
area in the neutral n-region when a forward bias of 1V is applied. The diffusion length of the holes is 5 μm.

3.5.2 
Diffusion Capacitance
The depletion-layer capacitance considered previously accounts for most of the junction capacitance when the 
junction is reverse biased. When the junction is forward biased, there is an additional significant contribution 
to junction capacitance from the rearrangement of the stored charges in the neutral regions. This is called the 
diffusion capacitance, denoted Cd, a term derived from the ideal-diode case in which minority carriers move across 
the neutral region by diffusion.
The diffusion capacitance of the stored holes in the neutral n-region is obtained by applying the definition  
Cd ≡ AdQp /dV to Eq. 75:

where A is the device cross-section area. We may add the contribution to Cd of the stored electrons in the neutral 
p-region in cases of significant storage. For a p+–n junction, however, npo << pno , and the contribution to Cd 
of the stored electrons becomes insignificant. Under reverse bias (i.e., V is negative), Eq. 77 shows that Cd is 
inconsequential because of negligible minority-carrier storage.
In many applications we prefer to represent a p–n junction by an equivalent circuit. In addition to diffusion 
capacitance Cd and depletion capacitance Cj, we must include conductance to account for the current through the 
device. In the ideal diode the conductance can be obtained from Eq. 55:

The diode equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 19, where Cj stands for the total depletion capacitance (i.e., the result 
in Eq. 33 times the device area A). For low-voltage, sinusoidal excitation of a diode that is biased quiescently (i.e., 
at dc), the circuit shown in Fig. 19 provides adequate accuracy. Therefore, we refer to it as the diode small-signal 
equivalent circuit.
3.5.3 
 Transient Behavior
For switching applications, the forward-to-reverse-bias transition must be nearly abrupt and the transient time 
should be short. Figure 20a shows a simple circuit where a forward current IF flows through a p–n junction. At 
time t = 0, switch S is suddenly thrown to the right and an initial reverse current IR ≅ V/R flows. The transient time 
toff, plotted in Fig. 20b, is the time required for the current to reach 10% of the initial reverse current IR.
The transient time may be estimated as follows. Under the forward-bias condition, the stored minority 
carriers in the n-region for a p+–n junction is given by Eq. 76:

where IF is the total forward current and A is the device area. If the average current flowing during the turn-off

Thus the turn-off time depends on both the ratio of forward to reverse currents and the lifetime of the 
minority carriers. The result of a more precise turn-off time calculation3 taking into account the time-dependent 
minority-carrier diffusion problem is shown in Fig. 21. For fast-switching devices, we must reduce the lifetime of 
the minority carriers. Therefore, we usually introduce recombination-generation centers that have energy levels 
located near mid-bandgap, such as gold in silicon.

3.6 JUNCTION BREAKDOWN
When a sufficiently large reverse voltage is applied to a p–n junction, the junction breaks down and conducts a 
very large current. Although the breakdown process is not inherently destructive, the maximum current must be 
limited by an external circuit to avoid excessive junction heating. Two important breakdown mechanisms are the 
tunneling effect and avalanche multiplication. We consider the first mechanism briefly and then discuss avalanche 
multiplication in detail, because avalanche breakdown imposes an upper limit on the reverse bias for most diodes. 
Avalanche breakdown also limits the collector voltage of a bipolar transistor (Chapter 4) and the drain voltage of a 
MOSFET (Chapters 5 and 6). In addition, the avalanche multiplication mechanisms can generate microwave power, 
as in an IMPATT diode (Chapter 8), and detect optical signals, as in an avalanche photodetector (Chapter 10).
p–n Junction 111

3.6.1 
Tunneling Effect
When a high electric field is applied to a p–n junction in the reverse direction, a valence electron can make a 
transition from the valence band to the conduction band, as shown in Fig. 22a. This process, in which an electron 
penetrates through the energy bandgap, is called tunneling.
The tunneling process is discussed in Chapter 2. Tunneling occurs only if the electric field is very high. The 
typical field for silicon and gallium arsenide is about 106 V/cm or higher. To achieve such a high field, the doping 
concentrations for both p- and n-regions must be quite high (> 5 × 1017 cm–3). The breakdown mechanisms for 
silicon and gallium arsenide junctions with breakdown voltages of less than about 4Eg/q, where Eg is the bandgap, 
are the result of the tunneling effect. For junctions with breakdown voltages in excess of 6Eg/q, the breakdown 
mechanism is the result of avalanche multiplication. At voltages between 4 and 6Eg/q, the breakdown is due to a 
mixture of both avalanche multiplication and tunneling.4
3.6.2 
Avalanche Multiplication
The avalanche multiplication process is illustrated in Fig. 22b. The p–n junction, such as a p+–n one-sided abrupt 
junction with a doping concentration of ND ≅ 1017 cm–3 or less, is under reverse bias. This figure is essentially the 
same as Fig. 26 in Chapter 2. A thermally generated electron in the depletion region (designated by 1) gains kinetic 
energy from the electric field. If the field is sufficiently high, the electron can gain enough kinetic energy that on 
collision with an atom, it can break the lattice bonds, creating an electron-hole pair (2 and 2′). The newly created 
electron and hole both acquire kinetic energy from the field and create additional electron-hole pairs (e.g., 3 and 
3′). These in turn continue the process, creating other electron-hole pairs. This process is therefore called avalanche 
multiplication.
To derive the breakdown condition, we assume that a current Ino is incident at the left-hand side of the 
depletion region of width W, as shown in Fig. 23. If the electric field in the depletion region is high enough 
to initiate the avalanche multiplication process, the electron current In will increase with distance through the 
depletion region to reach a value MnIno at W, where Mn, the multiplication factor, is defined as
 
M

(81)
Similarly, the hole current Ip increases from x = W to x = 0. The total current I = (Ip + In) is constant at steady 
state. The incremental electron current at x equals the number of electron-hole pairs generated per second in the 
distance dx:

From both the breakdown condition described above and the field dependence of the ionization rates, we may 
calculate the critical field (i.e., the maximum electric field at breakdown) at which the avalanche process takes 
place. Using measured αn and αp (Fig. 27 in Chapter 2), the critical field Ec is calculated for silicon and gallium 
arsenide one-sided abrupt junctions and shown in Fig. 24 as functions of the impurity concentration of the 
substrate. Also indicated is the critical field for the tunneling effect. It is evident that tunneling occurs only in 
semiconductors having high doping concentrations.
With the critical field determined, we may calculate the breakdown voltages. As discussed  previously, voltages 
in the  depletion  region are  determined from the solution of Poisson’s equation:

for linearly graded junctions, where NB is the background doping of the lightly doped side, εs is the semiconductor 
permittivity, and a is the impurity gradient. Since the critical field is a slowly varying function of either NB or a, 
the breakdown voltage, as a first-order approximation, varies as NB
–1 for abrupt junctions and as a–1/2 for linearly 
graded junctions.

Figure 25 shows the calculated avalanche breakdown voltages for silicon and gallium arsenide  junctions.5  
The  dash-dot  line  (to  the  right)  at  high  dopings  or  high-impurity gradients indicates the onset of the 
tunneling effect. Gallium arsenide has higher breakdown voltages than silicon for a given NB or a, mainly because 
of its larger bandgap. The larger the bandgap, the larger the critical field must be for sufficient kinetic energy to 
be gained between collisions. As Eqs. 85 and 86 demonstrate, the larger critical field, in turn, gives rise to higher 
breakdown voltage.
The inset in Fig. 26 shows the space-charge distribution of a diffused junction with a linear gradient near 
the surface and a constant doping inside the semiconductor. The breakdown voltage lies between the two 
limiting cases of abrupt junction and linearly graded junction considered previously.6 For large a and low NB, 
the breakdown voltage of the diffused junctions is given by the abrupt junction results shown by the bottom line 
in Fig. 26, whereas for small a and high NB, VB is given by the linearly graded junction results indicated by the 
parallel lines in Fig. 26.

In Figs. 25 and 26 we assume that the semiconductor layer is thick enough to support the reverse-biased 
depletion layer width Wm at breakdown. If the semiconductor layer W is smaller than Wm, as shown in the inset 
of Fig. 27, the device will be punched through; that is, the depletion  layer  will  reach  the n–n+ interface  prior to 
breakdown. Increase the reverse bias further and the device will break down. The critical field E c is essentially the 
same as that shown in Fig. 24. Therefore, the breakdown voltage !

Punch-through occurs when the doping concentration NB becomes sufficiently low, as in a p+–π–n+ or p+–ν–n+ 
diode, where π stands for a lightly doped p-type and ν stands for a lightly doped n-type semiconductor. The 
breakdown voltages for such diodes calculated from Eqs. 85 and 87 are shown in Fig. 27. For a given thickness, the 
breakdown voltage approaches a constant value as the doping decreases.

For a GaAs p+–n one-sided abrupt junction with ND = 8 × 1014 cm–3, calculate the depletion width at breakdown. 
If the n-type region of this structure is reduced to 20 μm, calculate the breakdown voltage.
SOLUTION From Fig. 25, we can find that the breakdown voltage (VB) is about 500 V, which is much larger than

radius of curvature. (b) Cylindrical and spherical regions formed by diffusion through a rectangular mask.
Fig. 29 Breakdown voltage versus impurity concentration for a one-sided abrupt doping profile with cylindrical and 
spherical junction geometries,7 where rj is the radius of curvature indicated in Fig. 28.
Another important consideration of breakdown voltage is the junction curvature effect.7 When a p–n junction 
is formed by diffusion through a window in the insulating layer on a semiconductor, the impurities diffuse 
downward and sideways (see Chapter 14). Hence, the junction has a plane (or flat) region with nearly cylindrical 
edges, as shown in Fig. 28a. If the diffusion mask contains sharp corners, the corner of the junction will acquire 
the roughly spherical shape shown in Fig. 28b. Because the spherical or cylindrical regions of the junction have 
higher field intensity, they determine the avalanche breakdown voltage. The calculated results for silicon one-
sided abrupt junctions are shown in Fig. 29. The solid line represents the plane junctions considered previously. 
Note that as the junction radius rj becomes smaller, the breakdown voltage decreases dramatically, especially for 
spherical junctions at low impurity concentrations.
 
3.7    HETEROJUNCTION
A heterojunction is defined as a junction formed between two dissimilar semiconductors. Figure 30a shows the 
energy band diagram of two isolated pieces of semiconductors prior to the formation of a heterojunction. The two 
semiconductors are assumed to have different energy bandgaps Eg, different dielectric permittivities εs, different 
work functions qϕs, and different electron affinities qχ. The work function is defined as the energy required to 
remove an electron from Fermi level EF to a position just outside the material (the vacuum level). The electron 
affinity is the energy required to remove an electron from the bottom of the conduction band EC to the vacuum 
level. The difference in energy of the conduction band edges in the two semiconductors is represented by ΔEC, 
and the difference in energy of the valence band edges is represented by ΔEV. From Fig. 30a, ΔEC and ΔEV can be 
expressed by

Figure 30b shows the equilibrium band diagram of an ideal abrupt heterojunction formed between 
these semiconductors.8 In this diagram it is assumed that there is a negligible number of traps or generation-
recombination centers at the interface of the two dissimilar semiconductors. Note that this assumption is valid 
only when heterojunctions are formed between semiconductors with closely matched lattice constants. Therefore, 
we must choose lattice-matched materials to satisfy the assumption.§  For example, the AlxGa1–x As materials, with 
x from 0 to 1, are among the most important materials for heterojunctions. When x = 0, we have GaAs, with a

bandgap of 1.42 eV and a lattice constant of 5.6533 Å at 300 K. When x = 1, we have AlAs, with a bandgap of 
2.17 eV and a lattice constant of 5.6605 Å. The bandgap for the ternary AlxGa1–xAs increases with x; however, the 
lattice constant remains essentially constant. Even for the extreme cases where x = 0 and x = 1, the lattice constant 
mismatch is only 0.1%.
There are two basic requirements in the construction of the energy band diagram: (a) the Fermi level must be 
the same on both sides of the interface in thermal equilibrium, and (b) the vacuum level must be continuous and 
parallel to the band edges. Because of these requirements, the discontinuity in conduction band edges ΔEV and 
valence band edges ΔEV will be unaffected by doping as long as the bandgap Eg and electron affinity qχ are not 
functions of doping (i.e., as in nondegenerate semiconductors). The total built-in potential Vbi can be expressed by

Under the conditions that the potential and the free-carrier flux density (defined as the rate of free-carrier 
flow through a unit area) are continuous at the heterointerface, we can derive the depletion widths and capacitance 
from the Poisson equation using the conventional depletion approximation. One boundary condition is the 
continuity of electric displacement,  that  is, ε1E1 = ε2E2,  where E1  and E2  are  the  electric  fields  at  the  interface

We see that most of the built-in potential is in the semiconductor with a lower doping concentration.  
The depletion width there is also much wider. 
 
SUMMARY
A p–n junction is formed when a p-type and an n-type semiconductor are brought into intimate contact. The 
p–n junction, in addition to being a device used in many applications, is the basic building block for other 
semiconductor devices. Therefore, an understanding of junction theory serves as the foundation to understanding 
other semiconductor devices.
When a p–n junction is formed, there are uncompensated negative ions (NA
–) on the p-side and 
uncompensated positive ions (ND
+) on the n-side. Therefore, a depletion region (i.e., depletion of mobile carriers) 
is formed at the junction. This region, in turn, creates an electric field. At thermal equilibrium, the drift current 
due to the electric field is exactly balanced by the diffusion current due to concentration gradients of the mobile 
carriers on the two sides of the junction. When a positive voltage is applied to the p-side with respect to the n-side, 
a large current will flow through the junction. However, when a negative voltage is applied, virtually no current 
flows. This “rectifying” behavior is the most important characteristic of p–n junctions.
The basic equations presented in Chapters 1 and 2 have been used to develop the ideal static and dynamic 
behaviors of p–n junctions. We derived expressions for the depletion region, the depletion capacitance, and the ideal 
current-voltage characteristics of p–n junctions. However, practical devices depart from these ideal characteristics 
because of carrier generation and recombination in the depletion layers, high injection under forward bias, and 
series-resistance effects. The theory and methods of calculating the effects of these departures from the ideal are 
discussed in detail. We also considered other factors that influence p–n junctions, such as minority-carrier storage, 
diffusion capacitance, and transient behavior in high-frequency and switching applications.
A limiting factor in the operation of p–n junctions is junction breakdown—especially that due to avalanche 
multiplication. When a sufficiently large reverse voltage is applied to a p–n junction, the junction breaks down and 
conducts a very large current. Therefore, the breakdown voltage imposes an upper limit on the reverse bias for p–n 
junctions. We derived equations for the breakdown condition of the p–n junction and showed the effect of device 
geometry and doping on the breakdown voltage.
A related device is the heterojunction formed between two dissimilar semiconductors. We obtained 
expressions for its electrostatic potentials and depletion widths. These expressions are simplified to that for a 
conventional p–n junction when these two semiconductors become identical.

SUMMARY
The transistor (a contraction for transfer resistor) is a multijunction semiconductor device. Normally, the transistor 
is integrated with other circuit elements for voltage gain, current gain, or signal-power gain. The bipolar transistor, 
also called the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), is one of the most important semiconductor devices. It has been 
used extensively in high-speed circuits, analog circuits, and power applications. Bipolar devices are semiconductor 
devices in which both electrons and holes participate in the conduction process. This is in contrast to the field-
effect devices, discussed in Chapters 5, 6, and 7, in which predominantly only one kind of carrier participates.
The bipolar transistor was invented by a research team at Bell Laboratories1 in 1947. The device had two 
metal wires with sharp points making contact with a germanium substrate (see Fig. 3 in Chapter 0). The first 
transistor was primitive by today’s standards, yet it revolutionized the electronics industry and changed our way of 
life.
In modern bipolar transistors, we have replaced the germanium with silicon and the point contacts with two 
closely coupled p–n junctions in the form of p-n-p or n-p-n structures. In this chapter, we consider the transistor 
action of the coupled junctions and derive the static characteristics from the minority carrier distributions in the 
device. We also discuss the frequency response and switching behavior of the transistor. In addition, we briefly 
consider the heterojunction bipolar transistor in which one or both p–n junctions are formed between dissimilar 
semiconductors.
In the final section, a related bipolar device called a thyristor is introduced. The basic thyristor has three 
closely coupled p–n junctions in the form of a p-n-p-n structure.2 The device exhibits bistable characteristics and 
can be switched between a high-impedance “off ” state and a low-impedance “on” state. (The name thyristor is 
derived from gas thyratron, which is a gas-filled tube with similar bistable characteristics.) Because of the two 
stable state (on and off) and the low power dissipation in these states, thyristors are useful in many applications. 
We consider the physical operation of the thyristor and a few related switching devices. Furthermore, the various 
thyristor types and their applications are briefly introduced.

4.1 TRANSISTOR ACTION
A perspective view of a discrete p-n-p bipolar transistor is shown in Fig. 1. The transistor is formed by starting 
with a p-type substrate. An n-type region is thermally diffused through an oxide window into this p-type substrate. 
A very heavily doped p+ region is then diffused into the n-type region. Metallic contacts are made to the p+- and 
n-regions through the windows opened in the oxide layer and to the p-region at the bottom. The details of 
transistor fabrication processes are considered in later chapters.
An idealized, one-dimensional structure of a p-n-p bipolar transistor between the dashed lines in Fig. 1 is 
shown in Fig. 2a. Normally, the bipolar transistor has three separately doped regions and two p–n junctions. The 
heavily doped p+-region is called the emitter (symbol E in the figure). The narrow central n-region, with moderately 
doped concentration, is called the base (symbol B). The width of the base is small compared with the minority-
carrier diffusion length. The lightly doped p-region is called the collector (symbol C). The doping concentration 
in each region is assumed to be uniform. Note that the concepts developed for the p–n junction can be applied 
directly to the transistor.

dimensional schematic of an n-p-n bipolar transistor and (d) its circuit symbol.
Figure 2b shows the circuit symbol for a p-n-p transistor. The current components and voltage polarities 
are shown in the figure. The arrows of the various currents indicate the direction of current flow under normal 
operating conditions (also called the active mode). The + and – signs are used to define the voltage polarities. We 
can also denote the voltage polarity by a double subscript on the voltage symbol. In the active mode, the emitter-
base junction is forward biased (VEB > 0) and the base-collector junction is reverse biased (VCB < 0). According to 
Kirchhoff’s circuit laws, there are only two independent currents for this three-terminal device. If two currents are 
known, the third current can be obtained.
The n-p-n bipolar transistor is the complementary structure to the p-n-p bipolar transistor. The structure 
and circuit symbol of an ideal n-p-n transistor are shown in Figs. 2c and 2d, respectively. The n-p-n structure can 
be obtained by interchanging p for n and n for p in the p-n-p transistor. As a result, the current flows and voltage 
polarities are all reversed. In subsequent sections, we concentrate on the p-n-p type because the direction of 
minority-carrier (hole) flow is the same as that of current flow. It provides a more intuitive base for understanding 
the mechanisms of charge transport. Once we understand the p-n-p transistor, we need only reverse the polarities 
and conduction types to describe the n-p-n transistor.

3b shows the impurity densities in the three doped regions, where the emitter is more heavily doped than the 
collector. However, the base doping is less than the emitter doping but greater than the collector doping. Figure 3c 
shows the corresponding electric-field profiles in the two depletion regions.
Figure 3d illustrates the energy band diagram, which is a simple extension of the thermal-equilibrium 
situation for the p–n junction applied to a pair of closely coupled p+-n and n-p junctions. The results obtained for 
the p–n junction in Chapter 3 are equally applicable to the emitter-base and base-collector junctions. At thermal 
equilibrium there is no net current flow, and hence the Fermi level is a constant in the regions.

with abrupt impurity distributions. (c) Electric-field profile. (d) Energy band diagram at thermal equilibrium.
Figure 4 shows the corresponding cases when the transistor in Fig. 3 is biased in the active mode. Figure 4a is 
a schematic of the transistor connected as an amplifier with the common-base configuration, that is, the base lead 
is common to the input and output circuits.3 Figures 4b and 4c show the charge densities and the electric fields, 
respectively, under biasing conditions. Note that the depletion layer width of the emitter-base junction is narrower 
and the collector-base junction is wider than in the equilibrium case in Fig. 3.
Figure 4d shows the corresponding energy band diagram under the active mode. Since the emitter-base 
junction is forward biased, holes are injected (or emitted) from the p+ emitter into the base and electrons are 
injected from the n base into the emitter. Under the ideal-diode condition, there is no generation-recombination 
current in the depletion region; these two current components constitute the total emitter current. The collector-
base junction is reverse biased and a small reverse saturation current will flow across the junction. However, if 
the base width is sufficiently small, the holes injected from the emitter can diffuse through the base to reach the 
base-collector depletion edge and then “float up” into the collector (recall the “bubble analogy”). This transport 
mechanism gives rise to the terminology of emitter, which emits or injects carriers, and collector, which collects 
these carriers injected from a nearby junction. If most of the injected holes can reach the collector without 
recombining with electrons in the base region, the collector hole current will be very close to the emitter hole 
current. 
Therefore, carriers injected from a nearby emitter junction can result in a large current flow in a reverse-biased 
collector junction. This is the transistor action, and it can be realized only when the two junctions are physically 
close enough to interact in the manner described. The two junctions are called the interacting p–n junctions. If, 
on the other hand, the two junctions are so far apart that all the injected holes are recombined in the base before 
reaching the base-collector junction, then the transistor action is lost and the p-n-p structure becomes merely two 
diodes connected back to back.

4.1.2    Current Gain
Figure 5 shows the various current components in an ideal p-n-p transistor biased in the active mode. Note 
that we assume that there are no generation-recombination currents in the depletion regions. The holes injected 
from the emitter constitute the current IEp, which is the largest current component in a well-designed transistor. 
Most of the injected holes will reach the collector junction and give rise to the current ICp. There are three base 
current components, labeled IBB, IEn, and ICn. IBB corresponds to electrons that must be supplied by the base to 
replace electrons recombined with the injected holes (i.e., IBB = IEp – ICp). IEn corresponds to the current arising 
from electrons being injected from the base to the emitter. However, IEn is not desirable, as shown later. It can 
be minimized by using heavier emitter doping (Section 4.2) or a heterojunction (Section 4.5). ICn corresponds to 
thermally generated electrons that are near the base-collector junction edge and drift from the collector to the base. 
As indicated in the figure, the direction of the electron current is opposite the direction of the electron flow.
We can now express the terminal currents in terms of the various current components described above:
 
IE = IEp + IEn , 
 (1)
 
IC = ICp + ICn , 
   (2)

The electron flow is in the opposite direction to the electron current.
 
IB = IE – IC = IEn + (IEp – ICp) – ICn .

4.2 STATIC CHARACTERISTICS OF BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS
In this section, we study the static current-voltage characteristics for an ideal transistor and derive equations for 
the terminal currents. The current equations are based on the minority-carrier concentration in each region and 
therefore are described by semiconductor parameters such as doping and minority-carrier lifetime.
Bipolar Transistors and Related Devices 129

4.2.1    Carrier Distribution in Each Region
To derive the current-voltage expression for an ideal transistor, we assume the following:
 1. The device has uniform doping in each region.
 2. The hole drift current in the base region as well as the collector saturation current is negligible.
 3. There is low-level injection.
 4. There are no generation-combination currents in the depletion regions.
 5. There are no series resistances in the device.
Basically, we assume that holes are injected from the emitter into the base under the forward-biased condition. 
These holes then diffuse across the base region and reach the collector junction. Once we determine the minority-
carrier distribution (i.e., holes in the n-type base region), we can obtain the current from the minority-carrier 
gradient.

The sinh function, sinh(Λ), can be approximately expressed by Λ when Λ << 1. For example, when Λ < 0.3, the 
difference between sinh(Λ) and Λ is less than 1.5 percent. Therefore, when W/Lp << 1, the distribution equation 
can be simplified as

The distribution approaches a straight line. The approximation is reasonable because the width of the base region 
is designed to be much smaller than the diffusion length of the minority carrier. Figure 6 shows a linear minority-
carrier distribution in a typical transistor operated under active mode. Note that assuming linear minority-carrier 
distribution can simplify the derivation of current-voltage characteristics. Therefore, we use the assumption 
hereafter to derive equations for the current-voltage characteristics.
 
Emitter and Collector Regions
The minority-carrier distributions in the emitter and collector can be obtained in a manner similar to the one 
used to obtain the distributions for the base region. In Fig. 6, the boundary conditions in the neutral emitter and 
collector regions are

4.2.2    Ideal Transistor Currents for Active Mode Operation
Once the minority-carrier distributions are known, the various current components shown in Fig. 6 can be 
calculated. The hole current IEp, injected from the emitter at x = 0, is proportional to the gradient of the minority 
carrier concentration. For W/Lp << 1, the hole current IEp can be expressed by using Eq. 15:

From these discussions, we see that the currents in the three terminals of a transistor are mainly determined 
by the minority carrier distribution in the base region. Once we derive the current components, the common-base 
current gain α0 can be obtained by using Eqs. 6 through 8.
 EXAMPLE 2
An ideal p+-n-p transistor has impurity concentrations of 1019, 1017, and 5 × 1015 cm–3 in the emitter, base, and 
collector regions, respectively; the corresponding lifetimes are 10–8, 10–7, and 10–6 s. Assume that an effective cross 
section area A is 0.05 mm2 and the emitter-base junction is forward-biased to 0.6 V. Find the common-base current 
gain of the transistor. Note that the other device parameters are DE = 1 cm2/s, Dp = 10 cm2/s, DC = 2 cm2/s, and

Fig. 7 Junction polarities and minority carrier distributions of a p-n-p transistor under four modes of operation.
4.2.3 
Modes of Operation
A bipolar transistor has four modes of operation, depending on the voltage polarities on the emitter-base junction 
and the collector-base junction. Figure 7 shows the VEB and VCB voltages for the four modes of operations of a 
p-n-p transistor. The corresponding minority carrier distributions are also shown. So far in this chapter we have 
considered the active mode of transistor operation. In the active mode, the emitter-base junction is forward biased 
and the base-collector junction is reverse biased.
In the saturation mode, both junctions are forward biased, leading to the nonzero minority-carrier distribution 
at the edge of each depletion region. Therefore, the boundary condition at x = W becomes pn(W) = p e

kT
CB /
 
instead of that given by Eq. 13b. The saturation mode corresponds to small biasing voltage and large output 
current, that is, the transistor is in a conducting state and acts as a closed (or on) switch.
In the cutoff mode, both junctions are reverse biased. The boundary conditions of Eq. 13 become pn(0) = 
pn(W) = 0. The cutoff mode corresponds to the open (or off) state of the transistor as a switch.
The fourth mode of operation is the inverted mode, called the inverted active mode. In this mode, the emitter-
base junction is reverse biased and the collector-base junction is forward biased. The inverted mode corresponds to 
the case where the collector acts as the emitter and the emitter acts as a collector. In this condition, the device is used 
backward. However, the current gain for the inverted mode is generally lower than that for the active mode. It is 
because of poor “emitter efficiency” resulting from low collector doping with respect to the base doping (Eq. 31).
The current-voltage relationships for the various modes of operation can be obtained by following the same 
procedures used for the active mode, with an appropriate change in the boundary conditions as in Eq. 13. The 
general e xpressions applicable to all modes of operations are

4.2.4 
Current-Voltage Characteristics of Common-Base and Common-Emitter Configurations   
Using Eq. 32, we can obtain the current-voltage characteristics for a transistor in a common-base configuration. 
Note that in this configuration, VEB and VBC are the input and output voltages and IE and IC are the input and 
output currents, respectively.
However, in circuit applications the common-emitter configuration is the one most often used, where the 
emitter lead is common to the input and output circuits. The general expressions for the currents, shown in 
Eq. 32, are also applicable to the common-emitter configuration. In this case, to generate the current-voltage 
characteristics, VEB and IB are the input parameters and VEC and IC are the output parameters.
Common-Base Configuration
Figure 8a shows  the  common-base configuration of a p-n-p transistor.  Figure 8b shows the measured results 
of output current-voltage characteristics for the common-base configuration. The various modes of operation 
are indicated on the figure. Note that the measured results of the output current-voltage characteristics for the 
common-base collector current are practically equal to the emitter current (i.e., α0 ≅ 1) and virtually independent 
of VBC. This is in close agreement with the ideal transistor behavior given by Eqs. 10 and 27. The collector current 
remains practically constant, even down to zero volts for VBC, where the holes are still extracted by the collector. 
This is indicated by the hole distributions shown in Fig. 9a. Since the hole gradient at x = W changes only 
slightly from VBC > 0 to VBC = 0, the collector current remains essentially the same over the entire active mode of 
operation. To reduce the collector current to zero, we have to apply a small forward bias, about 1 V for silicon, to 
the base-collector junction (in the saturation mode), as shown in Fig. 9b. The forward bias will sufficiently increase 
the hole density at x = W to make it equal to that of the emitter at x = 0 (see the horizontal line in Fig. 9b). 
Therefore, the hole gradient at x = W as well as the collector current will be reduced to zero.

Because the value of α0 is generally close to unity, ß0 is much larger than 1. For example, if α0 = 0.99, ß0 is 99 and if 
α0 is 0.998, ß0 is 499. Therefore, a small change in the base current  can give  rise  to  a  much  larger  change  in  the  
collector  current.  Figure 10b shows  the measured results of output current-voltage characteristics with various 
input base currents. Note that the figure shows nonzero collector-emitter leakage current ICEO when IB = 0.

In an ideal transistor with the common-emitter configuration, the collector current for a given IB is expected 
to be independent of VEC for VEC > 0. This is true when we assume that the neutral base width (W) is constant. 
However, since the width of the space charge region extending into the base region varies with the base-collector 
voltage, the base width is a function of the base-collector voltage. The collector current, therefore, is dependent on 
VEC. As the base-collector reverse-bias voltage increases, the base width will be reduced as shown in Fig. 11a. The 
reduced base width causes the gradient in the minority-carrier concentration to increase, which causes an increase 
in the diffusion current. As a result, ß0 will be increased. Figure 11b shows pronounced slopes and IC increasing 
with increasing VEC. This deviation is known as the Early effect4 or the base width modulation. By extrapolating the 
collector currents and intersecting the VEC axis, we can obtain the voltage VA, which is called the Early voltage.
 
4.3 FREQUENCY RESPONSE AND SWITCHING OF BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS
In Section 4.2 we discussed four possible modes of operation that depend on the biasing conditions of the emitter-
base and collector-base junctions. Generally, in analog or linear circuits the transistors are operated in the active 
mode only. However, in digital circuits all four modes of operation may be involved. In this section we consider the 
frequency response and switching characteristics of bipolar transistors.

currents meet at –VA.
4.3.1 
Frequency Response
High-Frequency Equivalent Circuit
In previous discussions, we were concerned with the static [or direct current (dc)] characteristics of the bipolar 
transistor. We now study its alternating current (ac) characteristics when a small-signal voltage or current is 
superimposed upon the dc values. The term small-signal means that the peak values of the ac signal current 
and voltage are smaller than the dc values. Consider an amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 12a, where the transistor 
is connected in a common-emitter configuration. For a given dc input voltage VEB,  a dc base current IB and dc 
collector current IC flow in the transistor. These currents correspond to the operating point shown in Fig. 12b. The 
load line, determined by the applied voltage VCC and the load resistance RL, intercepts the VEC axis at VCC and has 
a slope of (– 1/RL). When a small ac signal is superimposed on the input voltage, the base current IB will vary as 
a function of time, as illustrated in Fig12b. This variation, in turn, brings about a corresponding variation in the 
output current iC, which is ß0 times larger than the input current variation. As a result, the transistor amplifies the 
input signal.

138 Semiconductors

The equivalent circuit for this low-frequency amplifier is shown in Fig. 13a. At higher frequencies, we extend 
the equivalent circuit by adding the appropriate capacitances. Since the emitter-base junction is forward biased, we 
expect to have a depletion capacitance CEB and a diffusion capacitance Cd similar to that of a forward-biased p–n 
junction. For the reverse-biased collector-base junction, we expect to have only a depletion capacitance CCB. The 
high-frequency equivalent circuit with the three added capacitances is shown in Fig. 13b. Note that g

Cutoff Frequency
In Fig. 13c, the transconductance gm and the input conductance gEB are dependent on the common-base current 
gain. At low frequencies, the current gain is a constant, independent of the operating frequency. However, the 
current gain will decrease after a critical frequency is reached. A typical plot of the current gain versus operating 
frequency is shown in Fig. 14. The common-base current gain α can be described as

The cutoff frequency ƒT can also be expressed as (2πτT)–1 , where τT is the total time of the carrier transit from 
the emitter to the collector. τT  includes the emitter delay time τE, the base transit time τB, and the collector transit 
time τC. The most important delay time is τB. The distance traveled by the minority carriers in the base in a time 
interval dt is dx = υ(x)dt, where υ(x) is the effective minority-carrier velocity in the base. This velocity is related to 
the current as
 
I p = qυ(x)p(x)A, 
(42)
where A is the device area and p(x) is the distribution of the minority carriers. The transit time τB required for a

To improve the frequency response, the transit time of minority carriers across the base must be short. 
Therefore, high-frequency transistors are designed with a narrow base width. Because the electron diffusion 
constant in silicon is about three times larger than that of holes, all high-frequency silicon transistors are of the 
n-p-n type (i,e., the minority carrier in the base is the electron). Another way to reduce the base transit time is to 
use a graded base with a built-in field. For a large doping variation (i.e., high base doping near the emitter and low 
base doping near the collector), the built-in field in the base helps move carriers toward the collector and reduces 
the base transit time.
4.3.2 
Switching Transients
In digital applications, a transistor is designed to function as a switch. In these applications, we use a small base 
current to change the collector current from an off condition to an on condition (or vice versa) in a very short 
time. The off condition corresponds to a high-voltage and low-current state, and the on condition corresponds to 
a low-voltage and high-current state. A basic setup of a switching circuit is shown in Fig. 15a, where the emitter-
base voltage VEB is suddenly changed from a negative value to a positive value. The output current of the transistor 
is shown in Fig. 15b. The collector current is initially very low because both the emitter-base junction and the 
collector-base junction are reverse biased. The current will follow the load line through the active region and will 
finally reach a high current level, where both junctions become forward biased. Thus, the transistor is virtually 
open-circuited between the emitter and collector terminals in the off condition, which  corresponds  to  the  
cutoff  mode,  and  short-circuited  in  the  on  condition,  which corresponds to the saturation mode. Therefore, a 
transistor operated in this mode can nearly duplicate the function of an ideal switch.
The switching time is the time required for a transistor to switch from the off condition to the on condition, 
or vice versa. Figure 16a shows that when a positive input current pulse is applied to the emitter-base terminal at 
time t = 0, the transistor starts to turn on. At t = t2, the base current is suddenly switched to zero and the transistor 
starts to turn off. The transient behavior of the collector current IC can be determined by the variation of the 
total excess minority carrier charge stored in the base, QB(t). A plot of QB(t) as a function of time is shown in Fig. 
16b. During the turn-on transient, the base-stored charge will increase from zero to QB(t2). During the turn-off 
transient, the base-stored charge will decrease from QB(t2) to zero. For QB(t) < QS, where QS is the base charge 
when VCB = 0 (i.e., at the edge of saturation, as shown in Fig. 16d), the transistor is in the active mode.
Fig. 15 (a) Schematic of a transistor switching circuit. (b) Switching operation from cutoff to saturation.

Fig. 16 Transistor switching characteristics. (a) Input base current pulse. (b) Variation of the base-stored charge with 
time. (c) Variation of the collector current with time. (d) Minority-carrier distributions in the base at different times.
The variation of IC with time is plotted in Fig. 16c. In the turn-on transient, the stored base charge reaches 
QS, the charge at the edge of saturation at t = t1. For QB > QS the device is operated in saturation mode, and both 
the emitter and collector currents remain essentially constant. Figure 16d shows that for any t > t1 (say t = ta), the 
hole distribution pn(x) will be parallel to that for t = t1. Therefore, the gradients at x = 0 and x = W, as well as the 
currents, remain the same. In the turn-off transient, since the device is initially in the saturation mode, the collector 
current remains relatively unchanged until QB is reduced to QS (Fig. 16d). The time from t2 to t3 when QB = QS 
is called the storage time delay tS. When QB = QS, the device enters the active mode at t = t3. After that time, the 
collector current will decay exponentially toward zero. 
The turn-on time depends on how fast we can add holes (minority carriers in the p-n-p transistor) to the 
base region. The turn-off time depends on how fast we can remove the holes by recombination. One of the most 
important parameters for switching transistors is the minority carrier lifetime τp. One effective method to reduce τp 
for faster switching is to introduce efficient generation-recombination centers near the midgap.
 
4.4 NONIDEAL EFFECTS
From the above discussion, the emitter doping should be much higher than that of base to have higher current 
gain. What will it be if the emitter doping is degenerate? In an ideal transistor, the impurity distribution in the base 
region is uniform. What will it be in a real transistor? The current is limited to the low-level injection described in 
previous sections. What will it be under a high-injection condition?
4.4.1 
Emitter Bandgap Narrowing 
To improve current gain, the emitter should be much more heavily doped than the base, that is, NE >> NB.  
However, as the emitter doping becomes very high, we have to consider the bandgap-narrowing effect.3  
The bandgap narrowing in heavily doped silicon has been studied based on the broadening of both the  
conduction band and the valence band in Section 1.6.2 (Chapter 1). Figure 17 shows the experimental data and 
empirical fit for bandgap narrowing in silicon.5 It is approximately analogous to HBT discussed in the following

4.4.2 
Graded-Base Region 
In a real p-n-p transistor fabricated by diffusion or by the ion implantation process of dopant into an epitaxial 
substrate, the impurity distribution in the base is not uniform but is strongly graded, as shown in Fig. 18a. The 
corresponding band diagram is shown in Fig. 18b. Because of the impurity gradient, the electrons within the 
base tend to diffuse toward the collector.  However,  in  thermal  equilibrium  a  built-in  electric field exists in 
the neutral base to counterbalance the diffusion current: that is, the electric field will push the electrons toward 
the emitter and no current will flow. The same electric field can aid the motion of injected holes. Under an active 
biasing condition, the injected minority carriers (holes) will move not only by diffusion but also by drift caused by 
the built-in field of the base region.
The main advantage of the built-in field is to reduce the time needed for the injected holes to travel across 
the base region. This in turn will improve the transistor’s high-frequency response. An associated advantage is the 
improvement of the base transport factor αT, since the holes will spend, on the average, less time in the base region 
and thus will be less likely to recombine with electrons there.
4.4.3 
Current Crowding 
The base resistance consists of two parts. One is from the base contacts to the emitter edge; the other is the 
resistance under the emitter shown in Fig. 19,3 which causes a resistive voltage drop and reduces the net VBE 
across the junction along the emitter edge, and is more severe toward the center of the emitter. The base current 
IB decreases with the position toward the center  of  the  emitter. In  other  words, the  emitter  current  crowds  
toward  the edge  of  the emitter and increases at high current. The current crowding will cause high injection 
effects that tend to reduce the current gain.
This current crowding puts some restriction on the design of the emitter strip width. In modern transistors, 
the emitter strip width can be made small and current crowding is not a major problem. For power transistor, two 
bases or even an interdigitated structure are used to reduce the base resistance, which, in turn, reduces the current 
crowding effects.

thermal equilibrium.

effective emitter width.
4.4.4 
Generation-Recombination Current and High-Current Effect
In a real transistor, there is a generation current in the depletion region of the reverse-biased  base-collector  
junction.  This  current  is  added  to  the  leakage  current. A forward-biased emitter-base junction has a 
recombination current in its depletion region and, therefore, a current component is added to the base current. 
This recombination current has a profound effect on the current gain. Figure 20a shows the collector current 
and base current versus VEB for a bipolar transistor operated in the active mode. At low-current levels the 
recombination current is the dominant current component, and the base current varies as exp(qVEB/ηkT), with 
η ≅ 2. Note that the collector current IC is not affected by the emitter-base recombination current because IC is 
primarily due to those holes injected into the base that diffuse to the collector.

gain for the transistor data in (a).
Figure 20b shows the common-emitter current gain ß0, which is obtained from Fig. 20a. At low collector 
current levels, the contribution of the recombination current in the emitter-base depletion region is larger than 
the diffusion current of minority carriers across the base, so that the emitter efficiency is low. By minimizing the 
recombination-generation centers in the device, ß0 can be improved at low-current levels. As the base diffusion 
current becomes dominant, ß0 increases to a high plateau. 
Bipolar Transistors and Related Devices 145

At higher collector current levels, ß0 starts to decrease. This is caused by the high-injection effect, where the 
injected minority carrier density (holes) in the base approaches the impurity concentration and the injected carriers 
effectively increase the base doping, in turn causing the emitter efficiency to decrease. Another factor contributing 
to the degradation of ß0 at high-current levels is emitter crowding, which gives rise to a nonuniform distribution 
of current density under the emitter. The current density at the emitter periphery may be much higher than the 
average current density. Therefore, the high-injection effect occurs at the emitter periphery, resulting in a reduction 
of ß0. In addition, the significant voltage drop on the base resistance also contributes the drop of the current gain 
at high-injection regime.
 
4.5 HETEROJUNCTION BIPOLAR TRANSISTORS
We have considered the heterojunction in Section 3.7. A heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is a transistor 
in which one or both p–n junctions are formed between dissimilar semiconductors. The primary advantage of 
an HBT is its high emitter efficiency (γ). The circuit applications of the HBT are essentially the same as those 
of bipolar transistors. However, the HBT has higher-speed and higher-frequency capability in circuit operation. 
Because of these features, the HBT has gained popularity in photonic, microwave, and digital applications. For 
example, in microwave applications, HBTs are used in solid-state microwave and millimeter-wave power amplifiers, 
oscillators, and mixers.
4.5.1 
Current Gain in HBT
Let semiconductor 1 be the emitter and semiconductor 2 be the base of an HBT. We now consider the impact of 
the bandgap difference between these two semiconductors on the current gain of an HBT.

4.5.2 
Basic HBT Structures
Most developments of HBT technology are for the AlxGa1–xAs/GaAs material system. Figure 21a shows a 
schematic structure of a basic n-p-n HBT. In this device, the n-type emitter is formed in the wide bandgap AlxGa1–x 
As, whereas the p-type base is formed in the lower bandgap GaAs. The n-type collector and n-type subcollector are 
formed in GaAs with light doping and heavy doping, respectively. To facilitate the formation of ohmic contacts, 
a heavily doped n-type GaAs layer is formed between the emitter contact and the AlGaAs layer. Due to the large 
bandgap difference between the emitter and the base materials, the common-emitter current gain can be extremely 
large. However, in homojunction bipolar transistors, there is essentially no bandgap difference; instead, the ratio of 
the doping concentration in the emitter and base must be very high. This is the fundamental difference between the 
homojunction and the heterojunction bipolar transistors (see Ex. 4).
Figure 21b shows the energy band diagram of the HBT under the active mode of operation. The bandgap 
difference between the emitter and the base will provide band offsets at the heterointerface.  In fact, the superior 
performance of the HBT results directly from the valence-band discontinuity ΔEV at the heterointerface. ΔEV 
increases the valence-band barrier height in the emitter-base heterojunction and thus reduces the injection of holes 
from the base to the emitter. This effect in the HBT allows the use of a heavily doped base while maintaining a 
high emitter efficiency and current gain. The heavily doped base can reduce the base sheet resistance.6

Fig. 22 IC-VCE characteristics show an offset voltage.
In addition, the base can be made very thin without concern about the punch-through effect in the narrow base 
region. The punch-through effect arises when the base-collector depletion region completely penetrates the base 
and reaches the emitter-base depletion region. A thin base region is desirable because it reduces the base transit 
time and increases the cutoff frequency.7
One drawback of an HBT is the offset voltage in the common-emitter configuration, as shown in Fig. 22. The 
offset voltage ΔVCE is defined as the collector-emitter voltage at which the collector current reaches zero. It comes 
from the potential barrier in the conduction band between the base-emitter junction that hinders the carrier flow 
into the base and, thus, creates an offset voltage, i.e., an additional voltage drop in the base-emitter junction. The 
effect  of  this offset  voltage  can  be  alleviated with a graded base-emitter junction, which will be discussed later. 
It can also be eliminated by incorporating another heterojunction as the base-collector junction.
4.5.3 
Advanced HBTs
In recent years the InP-based (InP/InGaAs or AlInAs/InGaAs) material systems have been extensively studied. 
The InP-based heterostructure has several advantages.8 The InP/InGaAs structure has very low surface 
recombination and, because of a higher electron mobility in InGaAs than in GaAs, superior high-frequency 
performance is expected. A very high cutoff frequency of 550 GHz is obtained.9 In addition, the InP collector 
region has higher drift velocity at high fields than the GaAs collector. Also, the InP collector breakdown voltage is 
higher than that of GaAs.
Another heterojunction is in the Si/SiGe material system. This system has several properties  that  are  attractive  
for  HBT  applications.  Like  AlGaAs/GaAs  HBTs, Si/SiGe HBTs have high-speed capability since the base can 
be heavily doped because of the bandgap difference. The small trap density at the silicon surface minimizes the 
surface recombination current and ensures a high current gain even at low collector current. Compatability with the 
standard silicon technology is another attractive feature. Compared with GaAs- and InP-based HBTs, the Si/SiGe 
HBT, however, has a lower cutoff frequency of 300 GHz10 because of the lower mobilities in Si.
The conduction band discontinuity ΔEC shown in Fig. 21b is not desirable, since the discontinuity will make 
it necessary for the carriers in the heterojunction to transport by means of thermionic emission across a barrier or 
by tunneling through it. Therefore, the emitter efficiency and the collector current will suffer. The problem can be 
alleviated by improved structures such as the graded-layer and the graded-base heterojunctions. Figure 23 shows 
an energy band diagram in which the ΔEC is eliminated by a graded layer placed between the emitter and base 
heterojunction. The thickness of the graded layer is Wg.
The base region can also have a graded profile, which results in a reduction of the bandgap from the emitter 
side to the collector side. The energy band diagram of the graded base HBT is illustrated in Fig. 23 (dotted line). 
Note that there is a built-in electric field Ebi in the quasi-neutral base. It results in a reduction in the minority-carrier 
transit time, and thus an increase in the common-emitter current gain and the cutoff frequency of the HBT. Ebi can 
be obtained, for example, by varying linearly the Al mole fraction x of AlxGa1–xAs in the base from x = 0.1 to x = 0.

junction and with and without a graded-base layer.
For the design of the collector layer, it is necessary to consider the collector transit time delay and the 
breakdown voltage requirement. A thicker collector layer will improve the breakdown voltage of the base-collector 
junction but proportionally increase the transit time. In most devices for high-power applications, the carriers move 
through the collector at their saturation velocities because very large electric fields are maintained in this layer.
It is possible, however, to increase the velocities by lowering the electric field with certain doping profile in the 
collector layer. One way is to use p− collectors with a p+ pulse-doped layer near the subcollector for an n-p-n HBT. 
Therefore, electrons entering the collector layer can maintain their higher mobility of the lower valley during most 
of the collector transit time. Such a device is called a ballistic collection transistor (BCT).11 An energy band diagram 
of a BCT is shown in Fig. 24. The BCT has been shown to have more favorable frequency response characteristics 
compared with conventional HBTs over a narrow range of bias voltages. Because of its advantages at relatively 
low collector voltage and current conditions, the BCT is used for switching applications and microwave-power 
amplifications.
 
4.6 THYRISTORS AND RELATED POWER DEVICES
The thyristor is an important power device that is designed for handling high voltages and large currents. The 
thyristor is mainly used for switching applications that require the device to change from an off or blocking state 
to an on or conducting state, or vice versa.12 We have considered the use of bipolar transistors in this application, 
in which the base current drives the transistor from cutoff to saturation for the on-state, and from saturation to 
cutoff for the off-state. The operation of a thyristor is intimately related to the bipolar transistor, in which both 
electrons and holes are involved on the transport processes. However, the switching mechanisms in a thyristor 
are different from those of a bipolar transistor. Also, because of the device construction, thyristors have a much 
wider range of current- and voltage-handling capabilities. Thyristors are now available13 with current ratings from 
a few milliamperes to over 5000 A and voltage ratings extending above 10,000 V. We first consider the operating 
principles of basic thyristors and discuss some related high-power and high-frequency thyristors.

4.6.1 
Basic Characteristics
Figure 25a shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a thyristor structure, which is a four-layer p-n-p-n device with 
three p–n junctions in series: J1, J2, and J3. The contact electrode to the outer p-layer is called the anode and that to 
the outer n-layer is called the cathode. This structure without any additional electrode is a two-terminal device and 
is called the p-n-p-n diode. If an additional electrode, called the gate electrode, is connected to the inner p-layer (p2), 
the resulting three-terminal device is commonly called the semiconductor-controlled rectifier (SCR) or thyristor.
A typical doping profile of a thyristor is shown in Fig. 25b. An n-type, high-resistivity silicon wafer is chosen 
as the starting material (n1-layer). A diffusion step is used to form the p1- and p2-layers simultaneously. Finally, 
an n-type layer is alloyed (or diffused) into one side of the wafer to form the n2-layer. Figure 25c shows the energy 
band diagram of a thyristor in thermal equilibrium. Note that at each junction there is a depletion region with a 
built-in potential that is determined by the impurity doping profile.
The basic current-voltage characteristics of a p-n-p-n diode are shown in Fig. 26. It exhibits five distinct 
regions:
 
0-1:  The device is in the forward-blocking or off-state and has very high impedance. 
Forward breakover (or switching) occurs where dV/dI = 0, and at point 1 we define a 
forward-breakover voltage VBF and a switching current IS.
 
1-2:  The device is in a negative-resistance region, that is, the current increases as the 
voltage decreases sharply.
 
2-3:  The device is in the forward-conducting or on state and has low impedance. At point 
2, where dV/dI = 0, we define the holding current Ih and holding voltage Vh.
 
0-4: The device is in the reverse-blocking state.
 
4-5: The device is in the reverse-breakdown region.
Thus, a p-n-p-n diode operated in the forward region is a bistable device that can switch from a high-
impedance, low-current off state to a low-impedance, high-current on state and vice versa.
To understand the forward-blocking characteristics, we consider the device as two bipolar transistors, a p-n-p 
transistor and an n-p-n transistor, connected in a special way, as shown in Fig. 27. They are connected with the 
base of one transistor attached to the collector of the other, and vice versa. The relationships among the emitter, 
collector, and base currents and the dc common-base current gain were given in Eqs. 3 and 10. The base current of 
the p-n-p transistor (transistor 1 with current gain α1) is

Consider a thyristor in which the leakage currents I1 and I2 are 0.4 and 0.6 mA, respectively. Explain the forward-
blocking characteristics when (α1 + α2) is 0.01 and 0.9999.
SOLUTION The current gains are functions of the current I and generally increase with increasing current. At low 
currents both α1 and α2 are much less than 1, and we have

In this case, the current flowing through the device is the sum of the leakage currents I1 and I2 (≅ 1 mA).
As the applied voltage increases, the current I also increases, as do α1 and α2. This in turn causes I to increase 
further—a regenerative behavior. When α1 + α2 = 0.9999,

This value is 10,000 times larger than I1+ I2. Therefore, as (α1 + α2) approaches 1, the current I increases without 
limit; that is, the device is at forward conduction. 
152 Semiconductors

The variations of the depletion layer widths of a p-n-p-n diode biased in different regions are shown in Fig. 
28. At thermal equilibrium, Fig. 28a, there is no current flowing and the depletion layer widths are determined by 
the impurity doping profiles. In the forward-blocking state, Fig. 28b, junction J1 and J3 are forward biased and 
J2 is reverse biased. Most of the voltage drop occurs across the central junction J2. In the forward-conduction 
state, Fig. 28c, all three junctions are forward biased. The two transistors (p1-n1-p2 and n1-p2-n2) are in saturation 
mode of operation. Therefore, the voltage drop across the device is very low, given by (V1 – |V2| + V3),  which 
is  approximately equal to the  voltage  drop  across  one  forward-biased p-n junction. In the reverse-blocking 
state, Fig. 28d,  junction  J2 is  forward  biased but both  J1 and J3 are reversed biased. For the doping profile 
shown in Fig. 25b, the reverse-breakdown voltage will be mainly determined by J1 because of the lower impurity 
concentration in the n1-region.
Figure 29a shows the device configuration of a thyristor that is fabricated by planar processes with a gate 
electrode connected to the p2-region. A cross section of the thyristor along the dashed lines is shown in Fig. 
29b. The current-voltage characteristic of the thyristor is similar to that of the p-n-p-n diode, except that the gate 
current Ig causes an increase of α1 + α2 and results in a breakover at a lower voltage. Figure 30 shows the effect 
of gate current on the current-voltage characteristics of a thyristor. As the gate current increases, the forward 
breakover voltage decreases.
A simple application of a thyristor is shown in Fig. 31a, where a variable power is delivered to a load from a 
constant line source. The load RL may be a light bulb or a heater, such as furnace. The amount of power delivered 
to the load during each cycle depends on the  timing  of  the  gate-current  pulses  of  the  thyristor  (Fig. 31b).  
If  the current pulses are  delivered to the gate near the beginning of each cycle,  more  power will be delivered to 
the load. However, if the current pulses are delayed, the thyristor will not turn on until later in the cycle, and the 
amount of power delivered to the load will be substantially reduced.

4.6.2 
Bidirectional Thyristor
A bidirectional thyristor is a switching device that has on and off states for positive and negative anode voltages 
and is therefore useful in ac applications. The bidirectional p-n-p-n diode switch is called a diac (diode ac switch). 
It behaves like two conventional p-n-p-n diodes with the anode of the first  diode  connected  to  the  cathode  of  
the  second,  and  vice versa. Figure 32a illustrates such a structure where M1 stands for main terminal 1 and M2 
for main terminal 2. When we integrate this arrangement into a single two-terminal device, we have a diac, as 
shown in Fig. 32b. The symmetry of this structure will result in identical performance for either polarity of applied 
voltage.
154 Semiconductors

Fig. 31 (a) Schematic circuit for a thyristor application. (b) Wave forms of voltages and gate current.
When a positive voltage is applied to M1 with respect to M2, junction J4 is reverse biased so that the n2′ 
region does not contribute to the functioning of the device. Therefore, the  p1-n1-p2-n2 layers constitute a  
p-n-p-n diode that produces the forward portion of the I-V characteristic shown in Fig. 32c. If a positive voltage 
is applied to M2 with respect to M1, a current will conduct in the opposite direction and J3 will be reverse 
biased. Therefore, the p1′-n1′-p2′-n2′ layers of the reverse p-n-p-n diode produce the reverse portion of the I-V 
characteristics shown in Fig. 32c.
A bidirectional three-terminal thyristor is called a triac (triode ac switch). The triac can switch the current in 
either direction by applying a low-voltage, low-current pulse of either polarity between the gate and one of the two 
main terminals, M1 and M2, as shown in Fig. 33. The operational principles and the I-V characteristics of a triac 
are similar to those of a diac. By adjusting the gate current, the breakover voltage can be varied in either polarity.
 
SUMMARY
The bipolar transistor, developed in 1947, remains one of the most important semiconductor devices. A bipolar 
transistor is formed when two p–n junctions of the same semiconductor materials are physically close enough to 
interact. Charge carriers injected from the forward-biased first junction result in a large current flow in the reverse-
biased second junction.
We have considered the static characteristics of bipolar transistors, such as the modes of operation and the 
current-voltage characteristics of the common-emitter configuration. We have also considered the frequency 
response and switching behavior. A key device parameter of a bipolar transistor is the base width, which must be 
very small compared with the minority-carrier diffusion length to improve the current gain and to increase the 
cutoff frequency.
Bipolar transistors are used extensively as discrete devices or in integrated circuits for current-gain, voltage-
gain, and power-gain applications. They are also used in bipolar-CMOS combination circuits (BiCMOS), covered 
in Chapters 6 and 15, for high-density, high-speed operations.
The frequency limitations of a conventional bipolar transistor are the result of its low-base doping and 
relatively wide base. To overcome these limitations, a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) formed between two 
dissimilar semiconductors can have much higher-base doping and a much narrower base. The HBT has, therefore, 
gained popularity in millimeter-wave and high-speed digital applications.
Another important bipolar device is the thyristor, which is formed of three or more p–n junctions. The 
thysistor is used mainly for switching applications. These devices can have current ratings from a few milliamperes 
to over 5000 A and voltage ratings extending above 10,000 V. We considered the basic characteristics of thyristor 
operation. In addition, we discussed the bidirectional thyristor (diac and triac) that has on-off states with either 
positive or negative terminal voltages. Thyristors can cover a wide range of applications from low-frequency high-
current power supplies to high-frequency, low-power applications, including lighting controls, home appliances, 
and industrial equipment.

SUMMARY
The metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor is of paramount importance in semiconductor device physics 
because the device is extensively used in the study of semiconductor surfaces.* In integrated circuits, the device 
is used as storage capacitor and forms the basic building block for charge-coupled devices (CCD). The metal-
oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is composed of an MOS capacitor and two p-n junctions 
placed immediately adjacent to the MOS capacitor.1 Since its first demonstration in 1960, the MOSFET has 
been developed quickly and has become the most important device for advanced integrated circuits such as 
microprocessors and semiconductor memories. This is because MOSFET has many unique and unprecedented 
features, including low-power consumption and a high manufacturing yield.
Specifically, we cover the following topics: 
r
The ideal and practical MOS capacitors.
r
The inversion condition and threshold voltage of an MOS capacitor.
r
C-V and I-V characteristics of an MOS capacitor.
r
The charge-coupled device.
r
Basic characteristics of MOSFET.
 
5.1 IDEAL MOS CAPACITOR
A perspective view of an MOS capacitor is shown in Fig. la. The cross section of the device is shown in Fig. lb, 
where d is the thickness of the oxide and V is the applied voltage on the metal plate. Throughout this section we 
use the convention that the voltage V is positive when the metal plate is positively biased with respect to the ohmic 
contact and V is negative when the metal plate is negatively biased with respect to the ohmic contact.
The energy band diagram of an ideal p-type semiconductor MOS at V = 0 is shown in Fig. 2.1 The work 
function is the energy difference between the Fermi level and the vacuum level (i.e., qϕm for the metal and qϕs for 
the semiconductor). Also shown are the electron affinity qχ, which is the energy difference between the conduction 
band edge and the vacuum level in the semiconductor, qχi, the oxide electron affinity, qϕB, the energy barrier 
between the metal and the oxide, and qψB, the energy difference between the Fermi level EF and the intrinsic Fermi 
level Ei.
*A more general class of device is the metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) capacitor. However, because in 
most experimental studies the insulator has been silicon dioxide, in this text the term “MOS capacitor” is used 
interchangeably with “MIS capacitor.”

An ideal MOS is defined as follows: (a) At zero applied bias, the energy difference between the metal work 
function qϕm and the semiconductor work function qϕs is zero, or the work function difference qϕms is zero: *

where the sum of the three items in the brackets equals qϕs. In other words, the energy band is flat (flat-band 
condition) when there is no applied voltage. (b) The only charges that exist in the capacitor under any biasing 
conditions are those in the semiconductor and those with equal but opposite sign on the metal surface adjacent to 
the oxide. (c) There is no carrier transport through the oxide under direct current (dc)-biasing conditions, or the 
resistivity of the oxide is infinite. This ideal MOS theory serves as a foundation for understanding practical MOS 
devices.
When an ideal MOS capacitor is biased with positive or negative voltages, three cases can exist at the 
semiconductor surface. For a p-type semiconductor, when a negative voltage (V < 0) is applied to the metal 
plate, excess positive carriers (holes) will be induced at the SiO2-Si interface. In this case, the bands near the 
semiconductor surface are bent upward, as shown in Fig. 3a. For an ideal MOS capacitor, no current flows in the 
device regardless of the value of the applied voltage, therefore, the Fermi level in the semiconductor remains
* This is for a p-type semiconductor. For an n-type semiconductor, the term qψB is replaced by –qψB.

The upward bending of the energy band at the semiconductor surface causes an increase in the energy 
Ei – EF there, which in turn gives rise to an enhanced concentration or accumulation of holes near the oxide-
semiconductor interface. This is called the accumulation case. The corresponding charge distribution is shown on 
the right side of Fig. 3a, where Qs is the positive charge per unit area in the semiconductor and Qm is the negative 
charge per unit area (| Qm | = Qs ) in the metal. When a small positive voltage (V > 0) is applied to an ideal MOS 
capacitor, the energy bands near the semiconductor surface are bent downward and the majority carriers (holes) 
are depleted (Fig. 3b). This is called the depletion case. The space charge per unit area, Qsc, in the semiconductor is 
equal to – qNAW , where W is the width of the surface depletion region.
When a larger positive voltage is applied, the energy bands bend downward even more so that the intrinsic 
level Ei at the surface crosses over the Fermi level, as shown in Fig 3c. As a result, the positive

in the semiconductor depends exponentially on the energy difference EF – Ei, and is given by

(3)
In the case shown in Fig. 3c, (EF – Ei) > 0. Therefore, the electron concentration np at the interface is larger 
than ni, and the hole concentration given by Eq. 2 is less than ni. The number of electrons (minority carriers) at the 
surface is greater than holes (majority carriers); the surface is thus inverted. This is called the inversion case. 
Initially, the surface is in a weak inversion condition since the electron concentration is small. As the bands 
are bent further, eventually the conduction band edge comes close to the Fermi level. The onset of strong inversion 
occurs when the electron concentration near the SiO2-Si interface is equal to the substrate doping level. After this 
point most of the additional negative charges in the semiconductor consist of the charge Qn (Fig. 3c) in a very 
narrow n-type inversion layer 0 ≤ x ≤ xi, where xi is the width of the inversion region. Typically, the value of xi, 
ranges from 1 to 10 nm and is always much smaller than the surface depletion-layer width.
Once strong inversion occurs, the surface depletion-layer width reaches a maximum. This is because when 
the bands are bent downward far enough for strong inversion to occur, even a very small increase in band bending 
corresponding to a very small increase in depletion-layer width results in a large increase in the charge Qn in the 
inversion layer. Thus, under a strong inversion condition the charge per unit area Qs in the semiconductor is the 
sum of the charge Qn in the inversion layer and the charge Qsc in the depletion region:
 
Qs = Qn + Qsc = Qn – qNAWm , 
(4)
where Wm is the maximum width of the surface depletion region.
 
The Surface Depletion Region
Figure 4 shows a more detailed band diagram at the surface of a p-type semiconductor. The electrostatic potential 
ψ is defined as zero in the bulk of the semiconductor. At the semiconductor surface, ψ = ψs; ψs is called the surface 
potential. We can express electron and hole concentrations in Eqs. 2 and 3 as a function of ψ:

depletion approximation that we have employed in the study of p–n junctions. When the semiconductor is depleted 
to a width of W and the charge within the semiconductor is given by ρs = – qNA, integration of Poisson’s equation

The surface is inverted whenever ψs is larger than ψB. However, we need a criterion for the onset of strong 
inversion, after which the charges in the inversion layer become significant. A simple criterion is that the electron 
concentration at the surface is equal to the substrate impurity concentration, i.e., ns = NA. Since NA = n e

Equation 10 states that a potential ψB is required to bend the energy bands down to the intrinsic condition at the 
surface (Ei = EF), and bands must then be bent downward by another qψB at the surface to obtain the condition of 
strong inversion.
As discussed previously, the surface depletion layer reaches a maximum when the surface is strongly inverted.

which predicts that the capacitance will decrease with increasing metal-plate voltage while the surface is being 
depleted. When the applied voltage is negative, there is no depletion region, and we have an accumulation of holes 
at the semiconductor surface. As a result, the total capacitance is close to the oxide capacitance εox/d.
In the other extreme, when strong inversion occurs, the width of the depletion region will not increase with 
a further increase in applied voltage. This condition takes place at a metal-plate voltage that causes the surface 
potential ψs to reach ψs(inυ), as given in Eq.10. Substituting ψs(inυ) into Eq. 13 and noting that the corresponding 
charge per unit area is qNAWm yields the metal-plate voltage at the onset of strong inversion. This voltage is called 
the threshold voltage:

Although we have considered only the p-type substrate, all of the considerations are equally valid for 
an n-type substrate with the proper changes in signs and symbols (e.g., Qp for Qn). The capacitance-voltage 
characteristics will have identical shapes but will be mirror images of each other, and the threshold voltage is a 
negative quantity for an ideal MOS capacitor on an n-type substrate.
In Fig. 7a we assumed that when the voltage on the metal plate changes, all the incremental charge appears 
at the edge of the depletion region. Indeed, this happens when the measurement frequency is high. If, however, 
the measurement frequency is low enough so that generation-recombination rates in the surface depletion region 
are equal to or greater than the voltage variation, then the electron concentration (minority carrier) can follow the 
alternating current (ac) signal and lead to charge exchange with the inversion layer in step with the measurement 
signal. As a result the capacitance in strong inversion will be that of the oxide layer alone, Co. Figure 7b shows the 
measured MOS C-V curves at different frequencies.2 Note that the onset of the low-frequency curves occurs at  
ƒ ≤ 100 Hz.

gate materials.
 
5.2 SIO2-SI MOS CAPACITOR
Of all the MOS capacitors, the metal-SiO2-Si is the most extensively studied. The electrical characteristics of the 
SiO2-Si system approach those of the ideal MOS capacitor. However, for commonly used metal electrodes, the 
work function difference qϕms is generally not zero, and there are various charges inside the oxide or at the SiO2-Si 
interface that will, in one way or another, affect the ideal MOS characteristics.
 
The Work Function Difference
The work function of a semiconductor qϕs, which is the energy difference between the vacuum level and the Fermi 
level (Fig. 2), varies with the doping concentration. For a given metal with a fixed work function qϕm we expect 
that the work function difference qϕms ≡ (qϕm – qϕs) will vary depending on the doping of the semiconductor. One 
of the most common metal electrodes is aluminum, with qϕm = 4.1 eV. Another material also used extensively is the 
heavily doped polycrystalline silicon (also called polysilicon). The work function for n+- and p+-polysilicon are 4.05 
and 5.05 eV, respectively. Figure 8 shows the work function differences for aluminum, n+-, and p+-polysilicon on 
silicon as the doping is varied. It is interesting to note that ϕms can vary over a 2 V range depending on the electrode 
materials and the silicon doping concentration.
To construct the energy band diagram of an MOS capacitor, we start with an isolated metal and an isolated 
semiconductor with an oxide layer sandwiched between them (Fig. 9a). In this isolated situation, all bands are flat; 
this is the flat-band condition. At thermal equilibrium, the Fermi level must be a constant and the vacuum level 
must be continuous. To accommodate the work function difference, the semiconductor bands bend downward, as 
shown in Fig. 9b. Thus, the metal is positively charged and the semiconductor surface is negatively charged at 
MOS Capacitor and MOSFET 169

thermal equilibrium. To achieve the ideal flat-band condition of Fig. 2, we have to apply a voltage equal to the 
work function difference qϕms. This corresponds exactly to the situation shown in Fig. 9a, where we must apply a 
negative voltage VFB, called the flat-band voltage (VFB = ϕms), to the metal.
 
Interface Traps and Oxide Charges
In addition to the work function difference, the MOS capacitor is affected by charges in the oxide and traps at the 
SiO2-Si interface. The basic classification of these traps and charges are shown in Fig. 10. They are the interface-
trapped charge, fixed-oxide charge, oxide-trapped charge, and mobile ionic charge.3
Interface-trapped charges Qit are the charges in interface traps (historically also called interface states, fast 
states, or surface states) due to the interruption of the periodic lattice structure at the SiO2-Si interface, and are 
dependent on the chemical composition of this interface. The traps are located at the SiO2-Si interface with energy 
states in the silicon forbidden bandgap. The interface trap density, i.e., number of interface traps per unit area and 
per eV, is orientation dependent. In 100 orientation, the interface trap density is about an order of magnitude 
smaller than that in 111 orientation. Present-day MOS capacitors with thermally grown silicon dioxide on silicon 
have most of the interface-trapped charges passivated by low-temperature (450°C) hydrogen annealing. The value 
of Qit/q for 100-oriented silicon can be as low as 1010 cm–2, which amounts to about one interface-trapped charge 
per 105 surface atoms. For <111>-oriented silicon, Qit/q is about 1011 cm–2.
Similar to bulk impurities, an interface trap is considered a donor if it is neutral and can become positively 
charged by donating (giving up) an electron. So, the donor state usually exists in the lower half of the bandgap, as 
shown in Fig. 11. Because a negative voltage is applied, the Fermi level moves down with respect to the interface-
trap levels and the interface traps become positively charged. An acceptor interface trap is neutral and becomes 
negatively charged by accepting an electron. So, the acceptor state usually exists in the upper half of the bandgap 
also shown in Fig. 11. 
Figure 11 shows an interface-trap system consisting of both acceptor states and donor states, in which the 
states above a neutral level E0 are of the acceptor type and those below E0 are of the donor type. To calculate the 
trapped charge, we can assume that at room temperature, the occupancy takes on the value of 0 and 1 above and 
below EF. With these assumptions, the interface-trapped charges Qit can now be easily calculated by:
Fig. 9 (a) Energy band diagram of an isolated metal and an isolated semiconductor with an oxide layer between them.

This is the method used to determine Dit experimentally from the change of Qit in response to the change of 
EF or surface potential ψs. On the other hand, Eq. 20 cannot distinguish whether the interface traps are of donor 
type or acceptor type but only determine the magnitude of Dit.
When a voltage is applied, the Fermi level moves up or down with respect to the interface-trap levels and a 
change of charge in the interface traps occurs. This change of charge affects the MOS capacitance and alters the 
ideal MOS curve. 
Fig. 11 Any interface-trap system consisting of both acceptor states and donor states can be interpreted by an 
equivalent distribution with a neutral level E0 above which the states are of the acceptor type and below which of the 
donor type. When EF is above (below) E0, the net charge is – (+).   
MOS Capacitor and MOSFET 171

The fixed charge Qf is located within approximately 3 nm of the SiO2-Si interface. This charge is fixed and 
cannot be charged or discharged over a wide variation in surface potential ψs. Generally, Qf is positive and depends 
on oxidation and annealing conditions and on silicon orientation. It has been suggested that when the oxidation is 
stopped, some ionic silicon is left near the interface. These ions, along with uncompleted silicon bonds (e.g., Si-Si 
or Si-O bonds) at the surface, may result in the positive interface charge Qf . Qf can be regarded as a charge sheet 
located at the SiO2-Si interface. Typical fixed-oxide charge densities for a carefully treated SiO2-Si interface system 
are about 1010 cm–2 for a 100 surface and about 5 × 1010 cm–2 for a 111 surface. Because of the lower values of 
Qit and Qf, the 100 orientation is preferred for silicon MOSFETs.
The oxide-trapped charges Qot are associated with defects in the silicon dioxide. These charges can be created, 
for example, by X-ray radiation or high-energy electron bombardment. The traps are distributed inside the oxide 
layer. Most of process-related Qot can be removed by low-temperature annealing.
The mobile ionic charges Qm, such as sodium or other alkali ions, are mobile within the oxide under high-
temperature (e.g., >100°C) and high electric-field operations. Trace contamination by alkali metal ions may cause 
stability problems in semiconductor devices operated under high-bias and high-temperature conditions. Under 
these conditions mobile ionic charges can move back and forth through the oxide layer and cause shifts of the 
C-V curves along the voltage axis. Therefore, special attention must be paid to eliminate mobile ions in device 
fabrication.
The charges are the effective net charges per unit area in C/cm2. We now evaluate the influence of these 
charges on the flat-band voltage. Consider a positive sheet charge per unit area, Qo, within the oxide, as shown in 
Fig. 12. This positive sheet charge will induce negative charges partly in the metal and partly in the semiconductor, 
as shown in the upper part of Fig. 12a. The resulting field distribution, obtained from integrating Poisson’s 
equation once, is shown in the lower part of Fig. 12a, where we have assumed that there is no work function 
difference, or qϕms = 0.
To reach the flat-band condition (i.e., no charge induced in the semiconductor), we must apply a negative 
voltage to the metal, as shown in Fig. 12b. As the negative voltage increases, more negative charges are put on 
the metal and thereby the electric-field distribution shifts downward until the electric field at the semiconductor 
surface is zero. Under this condition, the area contained under the electric-field distribution corresponds to the 
flat-band voltage VFB:

The flat-band voltage is thus dependent on both the density of the sheet charge Qo and its location xo within the 
oxide. When the sheet charge is located very close to the metal
that is, if xo = 0
it will induce no charges in the 
silicon and therefore have no effect on the flat-band voltage. On the other hand, when Qo is located very close to 
the semiconductor
xo = d
such as the fixed-oxide charge Qf, it will exert its maximum influence and give rise to 
a flat-band voltage

The curve in Fig. 13a shows the C-V characteristics of an ideal MOS capacitor. Due to nonzero ϕms, Qf, Qm, or 
Qot, the C-V curve will be shifted by an amount given by Eq. 25. The parallel shift of the C-V curve is illustrated in 
Fig. 13b. If, in addition, there are large amounts of interface-trapped charges, the charges in the interface traps will 
vary with the surface potential. The C-V curve will be displaced by an amount that itself changes with the surface 
potential. Therefore, Fig. 13c is distorted as well as shifted because of interface-trapped charges.

5.3 CARRIER TRANSPORT IN MOS CAPACITORS
In an ideal MOS capacitor, the conductance of the insulating film is assumed to be zero. Real insulators, however, 
show some degree of carrier conduction when the electric field or temperature is high. 
5.3.1 Basic Conduction Processes in Insulators 
Tunneling is the conduction mechanism through insulators under high fields. The tunneling emission is a result 
of quantum mechanics by which the electron wave function can penetrate a potential barrier. From Section 2.6 of 
Chapter 2, the tunneling current is proportional to the transmission coefficient exp (−2βd), where d is the insulator 
thickness and β ~ (qV0 – E)1/2 ~ {[E1 + (E2 – qV)]/2}1/2. The term [E1 + (E2 – qV)]/2 is the average potential barrier 
height, where E1 and E2 are the barrier heights shown in Fig. 14a and V is

fixed-oxide charges. (c) Nonparallel shift along the voltage axis due to interface traps.

the applied voltage. When V increases, β will decrease and the transmission coefficient as well as the tunneling 
current will increase. Therefore, the current is dependent on the applied voltage but is independent of temperature. 
Figure 14a is for the direct tunneling, i.e., tunneling through the complete width of the insulator. Figure 14b is for 
the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling in which carrier tunneling through only a partial width of the barrier. In this case, 
both the average potential barrier height and the tunneling distance are reduced from those of direct tunneling.
The thermionic emission (Schottky emission) process is from the carrier transport of electrons with energies 
sufficient to overcome the metal-insulator barrier or the insulator-semiconductor barrier shown in Fig. 14c. From 
Section 2.5 of Chapter 2, the thermionic emission current is proportional to the electron density with energies 
above the barrier height, i.e. qχ for a vacuum-semiconductor interface or qϕB for a metal-insulator interface. 
Therefore, for the MOS capacitor the current is proportional to exp (qϕB/kT). It increases exponentially with 
decreasing barrier height and increasing temperature.   
The Frenkel-Poole emission, shown in Fig. 14d, is due to the emission of trapped electrons into the 
conduction band through thermal excitation. The emission is similar to that of the Schottky emission. The barrier 
height, however, is the depth of the trap potential well.
At low voltage and high temperature, current is carried by thermally excited electrons hopping from one 
isolated state to the next. This mechanism yields an ohmic characteristic exponentially dependent on temperature.
The ionic conduction is similar to a diffusion process. Generally, the dc ionic conductivity decreases during 
the time the electric field is applied because ions cannot be readily injected into or extracted from the insulator. 
After an initial current flow, positive and negative space charges will build up near the metal-insulator and the 
semiconductor-insulator interfaces, causing a distortion in the potential distribution. When the applied field is 
removed, large internal fields remain that cause some, but not all, ions to flow back toward their equilibrium 
position. This will result in an I-V hysteresis.
The space-charge-limited current results from carriers injected into a lightly doped semiconductor or an 
insulator, where no compensating charge is present. The current is proportional to the square of the applied 
voltage.
For a given insulator, each conduction process may dominate in a certain temperature and voltage range. 
Figure 15 shows plots of current density versus 1/T for three different insulators, Si3N4, Al2O3, and SiO2
4. The 
conduction here can be divided into three temperature ranges. At high temperatures (and high fields), the 
current J1 is due to Frenkel-Poole emission. At intermediate temperature, the current J3 is ohmic in nature. At 
low temperatures, the conduction is tunneling limited and the current J2 is temperature insensitive. One can also 
observe that the tunneling current strongly depends on the barrier height, which is related to the energy gap of the 
insulators (Si3N4 (4.7 eV) < Al2O3 (8.8 eV) < SiO2 (9 eV)). The larger the energy gap, the lower the current. The 
current in SiO2 is three orders of magnitude lower than that in Si3N4.
MOS Capacitor and MOSFET 175

5.3.2 Dielectric Breakdown
Microscopically, the percolation theory shown in Fig. 16 is used to explain breakdown.4 Under a large bias, some 
current will conduct through the insulator, most commonly a tunneling current. When energetic carriers move 
through the insulator, defects are generated randomly in the bulk of the dielectric film. When defects are dense 
enough to form a continuous chain connecting the gate to the semiconductor, a conduction path is created and 
catastrophic breakdown occurs.
A measure to quantify reliability is time to breakdown, tBD, which is the total stress time until breakdown 
occurs. An example for tBD versus oxide field for different oxide thickness is shown in Fig. 17.4 A few key points can 
be noticed in the figure. First, tBD is a function of bias. Even for a small bias, eventually the oxide will break down, 
taking a very long time. Conversely, a large field can be sustained for a very short time without breaking down. In 
addition, the breakdown field decreases as the oxide becomes thicker. This is because for a given electric field, a 
higher voltage is required for a thicker film. A higher voltage provides higher energy for the carriers, causing more 
damages to the oxide and reducing tBD.

semiconductor.

5.4  CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICES (CCD)
A schematic view of a CCD is shown5 in Fig. 18. The basic device consists of a closely spaced array of MOS 
capacitors on a continuous insulator (oxide) layer that covers the semiconductor substrate. A CCD can perform a 
wide range of electronic functions, including image sensing and signal processing. The operating principle of the 
CCD involves the charge storage and transfer actions controlled by the gate electrodes.
Figure 18a shows a CCD to which sufficiently large positive bias pulses have been applied to all the electrodes 
to produce surface depletion. A slightly higher bias has been applied to the central electrode so that the center 
MOS structure is under greater depletion and a potential well is formed there; i.e., the potential distribution is 
shaped like a well because of the larger depletion-layer width under the central electrode. If minority carriers 
(electrons) are introduced, they will be collected in the potential well. If the potential of the right-hand electrode 
is increased to exceed that of the central electrode, we obtain the potential distribution shown in Fig. 18b. In this 
case, the minority carriers will be transferred from the central electrode to the right-hand electrode. Subsequently, 
the potential on the electrodes can be readjusted so that the quiescent storage site is located at the right-hand 
electrode. By continuing this process, we can transfer the carriers successively along a linear array.
 
CCD Shift Register
Figure 19 shows more details about the basic principle of charge transfer in a three-phase, n-channel CCD array. 
The electrodes are connected to the ϕ1, ϕ2, and ϕ3 clock lines. Figure 19b shows the clock waveforms and Fig. 19c 
illustrates the corresponding potential wells and charge distributions.
At t = t1, clock line ϕ1 is at a high voltage and ϕ2 and ϕ3 are at low voltages. The potential wells under ϕ1 
will be deeper than the others. We assume that there is a signal charge at the first ϕ1 electrode. At t = t2, both ϕ1 
and ϕ2 have high bias as charge starts to transfer. At t = t3, the voltage at ϕ1 is returning to the low value while ϕ2 
electrodes are still held at high voltage. The electrons stored under ϕ1 are being emptied in this period. At t = t4, the 
charge transfer is complete and the original charge packet is now stored under the first ϕ2 electrode. This process 
will be repeated and the charge packet continues to shift to the right. CCDs can be operated with two, three, 
or four phases, with different design structures. Multiple electrode structures and clocking schemes have been 
proposed and implemented.6

potential (and charge) vs. distance at different times.6
CCD Image Sensor
For analog and memory devices, the charge packets are introduced by injection from a p-n junction in the vicinity 
of the CCD. For optical imaging applications, the charge packets are formed as a result of electron-hole pair 
generation caused by incident light.  
When CCD used in imaging array systems such as a camera or video recorder, CCD image sensors must be 
spaced c1osely to one another in a chain and function as shift registers to transport the signals. The structure of 
the surface-channel CCD image sensor is similar to that of the CCD shift register, with the exception that the gates 
are semitransparent to let light pass through. Common materials for the gates are metal, polysilicon, and silicide.

imagers with (b) interline transfer and (c) frame transfer. Gray pixels represent CCDs as photodetectors. The output 
register is usually clocked at higher frequency than the internal transfer.
Alternatively, the CCD can be illuminated from the back of the substrate to avoid light absorption by the gate. 
In this configuration, the semiconductor has to be thinned so that most of the light can be absorbed within the 
depletion region at the top surface.
MOS Capacitor and MOSFET 179

Because the CCDs can also be used as a shift registers, there is great benefit to using CCDs as photodetectors 
in an imaging-array system since the signals can be brought out sequentially to a single node, without complicated 
x-y addressing to each pixel. The photogenerated carriers are integrated during light exposure, and the signal is 
stored in the form of a charge packet, to be transported and detected later. The detection mode of the integrated 
charge over a long period of time enables detection of weaker signals. In addition, the CCDs have the advantages 
of low dark current, low noise, low-voltage operation, good linearity, and good dynamic range. The structure is 
simple, compact, stable, and robust, and is compatible with MOS technology. These factors contribute to high 
yield, which makes the CCDs desirable in consumer products.
Different readout mechanisms for the line imager and the area imagers are shown in Fig. 20.4 A line imager 
with dual output registers has improved readout speed (Fig. 20a). Most common area imagers use either interline-
transfer (Fig. 20b) or frame-transfer (Fig. 20c) readout architecture. In the former case, signals are transferred 
to the neighboring pixels and are subsequently passed along to the output register chain while the light-sensitive 
pixels start to collect a charge for the next data. In the frame-transfer scheme, signals are shifted to a storage area 
away from the sensing area. The advantage of this over the interline transfer is a more efficient light-sensing area, 
but there is more image smear since CCDs continue to receive light as signal charges are passed through them. 
For both interline transfer and frame transfer, all columns advance their charge signals to the horizontal output 
register simultaneously, and the output register carries these signals out at a much higher clocking rate.
 
5.5 MOSFET FUNDAMENTALS
The MOSFET has many acronyms, including IGFET (insulating-gate field-effect transistor), MISFET 
(metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor) and MOST (metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor). A 
perspective view of an n-channel MOSFET is shown in Fig. 21. It is a four-terminal device consisting of a p-type 
semiconductor substrate in which two n+ regions, the source and drain, are formed. The metal plate on the oxide is 
called the gate. Heavily doped polysilicon or a combination of a silicide such as WSi2 and polysilicon can be used 
as the gate electrode. The fourth terminal is an ohmic contact to the substrate. The basic device parameters are 
the channel length L, which is the distance between the two metallurgical n+-p junctions, the channel width Z, the 
oxide thickness d, the junction depth rj, and the substrate doping NA.§ Note that the central section of the device 
corresponds to the MOS capacitor discussed in Section 5.1.
The first MOSFET was fabricated in 1960 using a thermally oxidized silicon substrate.7 The device had a 
channel length of 20 μm and a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm.* Although present-day MOSFETs have been 
scaled down considerably, the silicon and thermally grown silicon dioxide used in the first MOSFET remains the 
most important combination.8 Most of the results in this section are obtained from the Si-SiO2 system.
§For p-channel MOSFETs, doping types in substrate and source/drain regions become n and p+, respectively. 
* A photograph of the first MOSFET is shown in Fig. 4 of Chapter 0.
180 Semiconductors

5.5.1  Basic Characteristics
The source contact is used as the voltage reference throughout this section. When no voltage is applied to the gate, 
the source-to-drain electrodes correspond to two p–n junctions connected back to back. The only current that can 
flow from the source to drain is the reverse-leakage current.† When we apply a sufficiently large positive bias to 
the gate, the MOS structure is inverted so that a surface inversion layer (or channel) is formed between the two n+-
regions. The source and drain are then connected by a conducting surface n-channel through which a large current 
can flow. The conductance of this channel can be modulated by varying the gate voltage. The substrate contact 
can be at the reference voltage or is reverse biased with respect to the source; the substrate bias voltage will also 
affect the channel conductance.
 
Linear and Saturation Regions
We now present a qualitative discussion of MOSFET operation. Let us consider that a voltage is applied to the 
gate, causing an inversion at the semiconductor surface (Fig. 22). If a small drain voltage is applied, electrons 
will flow from the source to the drain (the corresponding current will flow from drain to source) through the 
conducting channel. Thus, the channel acts as a resistor, and the drain current ID is proportional to the drain 
voltage. This is the linear region, as indicated by the constant-resistance line in the right-hand diagram of Fig. 22a.
When the drain voltage increases, eventually it reaches VDsat, at which the thickness of the inversion layer xi 
near y = L is reduced to zero; this is called the pinch-off point, P (Fig. 22b). Beyond the pinch-off point, the drain 
current remains essentially the same, because for VD > VDsat, at point P the voltage VDsat remains the same. Thus, 
the number of carriers arriving at point P from the source or the current flowing from the drain to the source 
remains the same. This is the saturation region, since ID is a constant regardless of an increase in the drain voltage. 
The major change is the decrease of L to the value L′ shown in Fig. 22c. Carrier injection from P into the drain 
depletion region is similar to that of carrier injection from an emitter-base junction to the base-collector depletion 
region of a bipolar transistor.
We now derive the basic MOSFET characteristics under the following ideal conditions. (a) The gate structure 
corresponds to an ideal MOS capacitor, as defined in Section 5.1, that is, there are no interface traps, fixed-oxide 
charges, or work function differences. (b) Only drift current is considered. (c) Carrier mobility in the inversion layer 
is constant. (d) Doping in the channel is uniform. (e) Reverse-leakage current is negligibly small. (f) The transverse 
field created by the gate voltage (E x in the x-direction, shown in Fig. 21, which is perpendicular to the current flow) 
in the channel is much larger than the longitudinal field created by the drain voltage  (Ey in the y-direction,
† This is true for the n-channel, normally off MOSFET. Other types of MOSFET are discussed in Section 5.5.2.

which is parallel to the current flow). The last condition is called the gradual-channel approximation and generally 
is valid for long-channel MOSFETs. Under this approximation, the charges contained in the surface depletion 
region of the substrate are induced solely from the field created by the gate voltage.
Figure 23a shows the MOSFET operated in the linear region. Under the above ideal conditions, the total 
charge induced in the semiconductor per unit area, Qs, at a distance y from the source is shown in Fig. 23b, which 
is an enlarged central section of Fig. 23a. Qs is given from Eqs. 13 and 14 by

The Subthreshold Region
When the gate voltage is below the threshold voltage and the semiconductor surface is only weakly inverted, the 
corresponding drain current is called the subthreshold current. The subthreshold region is particularly important 
when the MOSFET is used as a low-voltage, low-power device, such as a switch in digital logic and memory 
applications, because the subthreshold region describes how the switch turns on and off.
In the subthreshold region, the drain current is dominated by diffusion instead of drift and is derived in 
the same way as the collector current in a bipolar transistor with homogeneous base doping. If we consider the 
MOSFET as an n-p-n (source-substrate-drain) bipolar transistor (Fig. 23b), we have

A typical measured curve for the subthreshold region is shown in Fig. 25. Note the exponential dependence of 
ID on (VG – VT) for VG < VT. An important parameter in this region is the subthreshold swing, S, which is defined as 
ln10[dVG/d(lnID)]. The parameter quantifies how sharply the transistor is turned off by the gate voltage and is given 
by the gate-voltage change needed to induce a drain-current change of one order of magnitude. S is typically 70 ~ 
100 mV/decade of drain current at room temperature. To reduce the subthreshold current to a negligible value, we 
must bias the MOSFET a half-volt or more below VT.
5.5.2  Types of MOSFET
There are basically four types of MOSFETs, depending on the type of inversion layer. If, at zero gate bias, the 
channel conductance is very low and we must apply a positive voltage to the gate to form the n-channel, then the 
device is a normally off (enhancement) n-channel MOSFET. If an n-channel exists at zero bias and we must apply 
a negative voltage to the gate to deplete carriers in the channel to reduce the channel conductance, then the device 
is a normally on (depletion) n-channel MOSFET. Similarly, we have the p-channel normally off (enhancement) 
and normally on (depletion) MOSFETs.
MOS Capacitor and MOSFET 187

Fig. 26 Cross section, output, and transfer characteristics of four types of MOSFETs.
The device cross sections, output characteristics (i.e., ID versus VD), and transfer characteristics (i.e., ID versus 
VG) of the four types are shown in Fig. 26. Note that for the normally off n-channel device, a positive gate bias 
larger than the threshold voltage VT must be applied before a substantial drain current flows. For the normally on 
n-channel device, a large current can flow at VG = 0, and the current can be increased or decreased by varying the 
gate voltage. This discussion can be readily extended to p-channel device by changing polarities.
5.5.3 Threshold Voltage Control
One of the most important parameters of the MOSFET is the threshold voltage. The ideal threshold voltage is 
given in Eq. 37. However, when we incorporate the effects of the fixed-oxide charge and the difference in work 
function, there is a flat-band voltage shift. Additionally, substrate bias can also influence the threshold voltage. 
When a reverse bias is applied between the substrate and the source, the depletion region is widened and the 
threshold voltage required to achieve inversion must be increased to accommodate the larger Qsc. These factors in 
turn cause a change in the threshold voltage:

Fig. 27 Calculated threshold voltage of n-channel (VTn) and p-channel (VTp) MOSFETs as a function of impurity 
concentration, for devices with n+–, p+– polysilicon, and mid-gap work function gates assuming zero fixed charge. The 
thickness of the gate oxide is 5 nm. NMOS is an n-channel MOSFET; PMOS is a p-channel MOSFET.
Figure 27 shows the calculated threshold voltage of n-channel (VTn) and p-channel (VTp) MOSFETs with n+-, 
p+- polysilicon and mid-gap work function gate electrodes as a function of their substrate doping, assuming d = 5 
nm, VBS = 0, and Qf = 0. Mid-gap gate materials are those with a work function of 4.61 eV, which equals the sum 
of the electron affinity qχ and Eg/2 of silicon (see Fig. 2).
Precise control of the threshold voltage of MOSFETs in an integrated circuit is essential for reliable circuit 
operation. Typically, the threshold voltage is adjusted through ion implantation into the channel region. For 
example, a boron implantation through a surface oxide is often used to adjust the threshold voltage of an 
n-channel MOSFET (with p-type substrate). Using this method, it is possible to obtain close control of threshold 
voltage because very precise quantities of impurity can be introduced. The negatively charged boron acceptors 
increase the doping level of the channel. As a result, VT increases. Similarly, a shallow boron implant into a 
p-channel MOSFET can reduce VT.
 EXAMPLE 6
For an n-channel n+-polysilicon-SiO2-Si MOSFET with NA = 1017 cm–3 and Qf /q = 5 × 1011 cm–2, calculate VT for 
a gate oxide of 5 nm. What is the boron ion dose required to increase VT to 0.6 V? Assume that the implanted 
acceptors form a sheet of negative charge at the Si-SiO2 interface.

We can also control VT by varying the oxide thickness. Threshold voltage becomes more positive for an 
n-channel MOSFET and more negative for a p-channel MOSFET as the oxide thickness is increased. This is 
simply due to the reduced field strength at a fixed gate voltage for a thicker oxide. Such an approach is used 
extensively for isolating transistors fabricated on a chip. Figure 28 shows the cross section of an isolation oxide 
(also called field oxide) between an n+ diffusion and an n-well. Details about the field oxide formation and the well 
technology are given in Chapter 15. The n+ diffusion region is the source or drain region of a normal n-channel 
MOSFET. The gate oxide of MOSFET is much thinner than the field oxide. When a conductor line is formed over 
the field oxide, a parasitic MOSFET, also called a field transistor, results with the n+ diffusion and n-well regions 
as the source and drain, respectively. The VT of the field oxide is typically an order of magnitude larger than that 
of the thin gate oxide. During circuit operation, the field transistor will not be turned on. Consequently, the field 
oxide provides good isolation between the n+ diffusion and n-well regions.
 EXAMPLE 7
For an n-channel field transistor with NA = 1017 cm–3 and Qf /q = 5 x 1011 cm–2, calculate VT for a gate oxide (i.e., the 
field oxide) of 500 nm.

Substrate bias can also be used to adjust the threshold voltage. The source and substrate may not be at the 
same potential. The p-n junction between source and substrate must be zero or reverse biased. If the VBS is zero, 
the gate voltage is at the threshold voltage as in Eq. 47, and the surface potential of substrate is 2ψB. When a 
reverse substrate-source bias is applied (VBS > 0), the potential of electrons in the channel is raised to be higher 
than that of the source. The electrons in the channel will be pushed laterally to the source. If the electron density 
in the channel under heavy inversion condition is kept the same, the gate voltage must be raised to 2ψB + VBS. 
According to Eq. 47, the change in threshold voltage due to the substrate bias is

If we plot the drain current versus VG, the intercept at the VG-axis corresponds to the threshold voltage, Eq. 37. 
Such a plot is shown in Fig. 29 for three different substrate biases. As the magnitude of the substrate VBS increases 
from 0 V to 2 V, the threshold voltage also increases from 0.56 V to 1.03 V. The substrate effect can be used to raise 
the threshold voltage of a marginal enhancement device (VT ~ 0) to a larger value.

For the MOSFET discussed in Ex. 6 with VT  of –0.02 V, if the reverse substrate bias is increased from zero to 2 V, 
calculate the change in threshold voltage.

Another way to control VT is to adjust the work function difference by choosing an appropriate gate material. A 
number of conducting materials have been proposed, such as W, TiN, and a heavily doped polycrystalline silicon-
germanium layer.9 In deep submicron device fabrication, control of the threshold voltage and device performance 
becomes more difficult because of the geometric effects encountered in device scaling (see the discussion in the 
next chapter). The use of other gate materials to replace the conventional n+ polysilicon could make device design 
more flexible.
 
SUMMARY
In this chapter, we first consider the MOS capacitor, a core component of MOSFET. Charge distributions at the 
oxide/semiconductor interface (accumulation, depletion, and inversion) in an MOS device can be controlled by 
the gate voltage. The quality of an MOS capacitor is determined by the qualities of the oxide bulk and oxide/
semiconductor interface. For commonly used metal electrodes, the work function difference qϕms is generally not 
zero, and there are various charges inside the oxide or at the SiO2-Si interface that will, in one way or another, 
affect the ideal MOS characteristics. The qualities of the oxide bulk and oxide/semiconductor interface can be 
evaluated by capacitance-voltage and current-voltage relationships. We then introduced the basic characteristics 
and the operational principles of the MOSFET. The MOSFET is formed when a source and a drain are placed 
adjacent to the MOS capacitor. Output current (i.e., drain current) is controlled by varying the gate and drain 
voltages. The threshold voltage is the main parameter that determines the on-off characteristics of an MOSFET. 
The threshold voltage can be adjusted by choosing suitable substrate doping, oxide thickness, substrate bias, and 
gate materials.

SUMMARY
MOSFET is the most important device in modern high-density advanced integrated circuits (IC). We have 
considered the basic characteristics of the so-called long-channel MOSFET in the previous chapter. Since 1970 
the gate length of MOSFETs in production ICs has been scaled down at a rate about 13% per year, and it will 
continue to shrink in the foreseeable future. The reduction of device dimensions is driven by requirements for both 
performance and density. In this chapter we will consider some advanced topics on MOSFET scaling, novel scaled 
device structures, and logic and memory devices.
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
MOSFET scaling and its associated short-channel effects.
r

6.1  MOSFET SCALING
Scaling down of MOSFET’s dimensions is a continuous trend since its inception. Smaller device size makes 
possible higher device density in an integrated circuit. In addition, a smaller channel length improves the 
driving current (ID ~ 1/L) and thus the operation performance. As a device’s dimensions are reduced, however, 
influences from the side regions of the channel (i.e., source, drain, and isolation edge) become significant. Device 
characteristics, therefore, deviate from those derived from gradual-channel approximation for long-channel 
MOSFETs.
6.1.1  Short-Channel Effects
The threshold voltage given in Eq. 47 in Chapter 5 is derived based on the gradual-channel approximation stated 
in Section 5.5.1. That is, the charges contained in the surface depletion region of the substrate are induced solely 
from the field created by the gate voltage. In other words, the third term on the right-hand side of Eq. 47 in 
Chapter 5 is independent of the lateral fields from the source and drain. As channel length is reduced, however,

field-effect transistor technology.1
the fields originating from the source/drain regions may influence the charge distribution and, thus, device 
characteristics such as the threshold voltage control and device leakage. When the source and drain depletion 
regions become a substantial fraction of the channel length, short channel effects start to occur.
 
Threshold Voltage Roll-off in Linear Region
When short-channel effects become non-negligible, the threshold voltage in the linear region usually becomes less 
positive as channel length decreases for n-channel MOSFETs and less negative as channel length decreases for 
p-channel MOSFETs. Figure 1 shows an example of this VT roll-off phenomenon with |VDS| = 0.05 and 1.8 V.1 
Roll-off can be explained by the charge-sharing model.2 2-dimensional examination at the ends of the channel 
reveals that some of the depletion charge is balanced by the source and drain, as shown in Fig. 2a, in which WDm 
is the maximum depletion-layer width, WS and WD are the vertical depletion-layer widths under the source and 
drain. yS and yD are the horizontal depletion-layer width at the source and drain ends. WD > WS and yD > yS are 
for VD > 0. For small drain bias, we can assume that WS ≅ WD ≅ WDm as shown in Fig. 2b. The channel depletion 
region overlaps the source and drain depletion regions, charges induced by the field created by the gate bias can be 
approximated by those within the trapezoidal region as illustrated in Fig. 2c. 
The threshold voltage shift ΔVT is due to the reduction of charge in the depletion layer from the rectangular 
region L × Wm to the trapezoidal region (L + L′)Wm/2. ΔVT is given by (see Prob. 2)

For long-channel devices, the charge reduction is smaller, since Δ (Fig. 2c) is much smaller than L. For short-
channel devices, however, the charges needed to turn on the device are dramatically reduced, since Δ is comparable 
to L. As can be seen from Eq. 1, for a given set of NA, Wm , rj and Co, the threshold voltage decreases with 
decreasing channel length.
Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL)
For an n-channel MOSFET, the p-Si substrate forms a potential barrier between n+ source and drain and limits 
the electron flow from source to drain. In the long-channel case operated in the saturation region, the increase in 
depletion-layer width of the drain junction will not affect the potential barrier height at the source end shown in 
Fig. 3a. That is to say, for a long-channel device a drain bias can change the effective channel length but the barrier 
at the source end remains constant. When the drain is close to the source, as in a short-channel MOSFET, the 
drain bias can influence the barrier height at the source end. This is ascribed to the field penetration at the surface 
region from the drain to the source. Figure 3b shows the energy bands along the semiconductor surface. 
For a short-channel device, this lowered barrier with decreasing channel length or increasing drain bias is 
commonly called drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL). The lowering of the source barrier causes an injection 
of extra carriers from the source to the drain, thereby increasing the current substantially. This increase of current 
will be shown in both the above-threshold and subthreshold regions, and the threshold voltage will decrease with 
increasing drain bias.

channel MOSFETs, showing the DIBL effect in the latter. Dashed lines: VD = 0. Solid lines: VD > 0.
Figure 4 illustrates the subthreshold characteristics of a long and a short n-channel MOSFET at low and high 
drain bias conditions. The parallel shift in subthreshold current in the short-channel device (Fig. 4b) as the drain 
voltage increases indicates that a significant DIBL effect has been induced.
Bulk Punch-through
DIBL causes the formation of a leakage path at the SiO2/Si interface. If the drain voltage is large enough, 
significant leakage current may also flow from drain to source via the bulk of the substrate for a short-channel 
MOSFET. This is also ascribed to the increase in the depletion-layer width of the drain junction with increasing 
drain voltage.
In the extreme case for a short-channel MOSFET, the sum of depletion-layer width for source and drain 
junctions is comparable to the channel length (yS + yD ≅L). The depletion region of the drain junction gradually 
merges with that of the source junction as the drain voltage is increased. An example of severe punch-through 
characteristics above threshold is shown in Fig. 5a. For this device, at VD = 0 the sum of yS and yD is 0.26 μm, 
which is larger than the channel length of 0.23 μm. Therefore, the depletion region of the drain junction has 
reached the depletion region of the source junction. Over the drain range shown, the device is operated in punch-
through condition. Electrons in the source region can be injected into the depleted channel region, where they

The DIBL and bulk punch-through effects on subthreshold current are shown in Fig. 5b for various channel 
lengths. The device with a 7-μm channel length shows long-channel behavior; that is, the subthreshold drain 
current is independent of drain voltage. For L = 3 μm, there is a substantial dependence of current on VD, with 
a corresponding shift of VT (which is at the point of current departure of the I-V characteristic from the straight 
line). The subthreshold swing also increases. For an even shorter channel, L = 1.5 μm, long-channel behavior is 
totally lost. The subthreshold swing becomes much worse and the device cannot be turned off.
Figure 6 shows the subthreshold characteristics of a short-channel (L = 0.23 μm) MOSFET. When the drain 
voltage is increased from 0.1 to 1 V, DIBL is induced with the parallel shift in the subthreshold characteristics 
similar to that shown in Fig. 4b. When the drain voltage is further increased to 4 V, the subthreshold swing is much 
larger than that for lower drain biases. Consequently, the device has a very high leakage current. This indicates that 
the bulk punch-through effect is very significant. The gate can no longer turn the device completely off and loses 
control of the drain current.

6.1.2 
Scaling Rules
As device dimensions are reduced, the short-channel effects must be minimized to maintain normal device and 
circuit operation. Some guidelines are necessary in scaled-device design. One elegant approach to maintaining the 
long-channel behavior is to simply reduce all dimensions and voltages by a scaling factor κ (> 1), so that the internal 
electric fields are the same as those of a long-channel MOSFET. This approach is called constant-field scaling.3
Table 1 summarizes the scaling rules of the constant-field scaling for various device and circuit parameters.4 
The circuit performance (speed and power consumption in the on state) can be enhanced as the device dimensions 
are scaled down.* In practical integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing, however, the electric fields inside smaller 
devices are not kept constant but increased to some extent. This is mainly because the voltage factors (e.g., power 
supply, threshold voltage) cannot be scaled arbitrarily. If the threshold voltage is too small, the leakage level in the 
off-state (VG = 0) will increase significantly because of the nonscalable subthreshold swing. Consequently, standby 
power consumption will also increase.5 By applying the scaling rules, MOSFETs have been fabricated that have a 
channel length as short as 5 nm, a very low gate delay (CV/I > 0.22 ps), high on/off current ratio (>5×104), and a 
reasonable subthreshold swing ( ~ 75 mV/decade).6

MOSFET Structures to Control Short-Channel Effects
Many device structures have been proposed to control short-channel effects and improve MOSFET performance5. 
The improvements of an MOSFET structure can be made in three separate parts: channel doping, gate stack, and 
source/drain design.
 
Channel Doping Profile
Figure 7 shows the schematic structure of a typical high-performance MOSFET based on planar technology. 
The channel doping profile has a peak level slightly below the semiconductor surface. This retrograde profile is 
achieved with ion implantation, often of multiple doses and energies. The low concentration at the surface has 
the advantages of higher mobility, mainly from the alleviation of surface scattering by normal field reduction due 
to lower threshold voltage as well as by reduced impurity scattering in the channel. The high peak concentration 
below the surface is to control punch-through and other short-channel effects. The lower concentration is typically 
below the junction depth, reducing the junction capacitance as well as the substrate-bias effect on threshold 
voltage. 
 
Gate Stack
The gate stack consists of the gate dielectric and the gate contact material. As the thickness of SiO2 for the gate 
dielectric is scaled into the range below 2 nm, fundamental problems of tunneling and technological difficulty of 
defects start to demand alternative techniques. High-dielectric materials or high-k dielectrics can have a thicker 
physical thickness for the same capacitance, thus reducing its electric field. The common terminology used is the 
equivalent oxide thickness (EOT = physical thickness × kSiO2/k). Some material options being examined are Al2O3, 
HfO2, ZrO2, La2O3, Ta2O5, and TiO2. The EOT can be easily extended to below 1 nm. 
The gate contact material has been polysilicon for a long time. The advantages of a poly-Si are its 
compatibility with the silicon processing, and its ability to withstand the high-temperature anneal that is

junction, and self-aligned silicide source/drain contact.

required after self-aligned source/drain implantation. The self-aligned process can eliminate parasitic capacitances 
from the overlay errors between gate and source/drain. Another important factor is that the work function can 
be varied by doping it into n-type and p-type, as shown in Fig. 8, Chapter 5. Such flexibility is crucial for the 
symmetric CMOS technology. One limitation of the poly-Si gate is its relatively high resistance. It will increase 
the input impedance and hence lower high-frequency performances. Another shortcoming of poly-Si gate is 
the depletion effect. Taking an n+-polysilicon-gate n-channel MOS capacitor biased under inversion condition 
for example, as shown in Fig. 8a, the direction of oxide electric field will expel electrons in n+ polysilicon at the 
poly-Si/oxide interface. The bands in the n+ polysilicon bend slightly upward toward the oxide interface to form a 
depletion region there. The gate depletion results in an additional capacitance in series with the oxide capacitance. 
This reduces the effective gate capacitance and the inversion-layer charge density to degrade MOSFET 
transconductance. This becomes more severe with thinner oxides, as shown in Fig. 8b. To circumvent the problems 
of resistance and depletion, we have to use silicides and metals as the gate contact materials. Potential candidates 
are TiN, TaN, W, Mo, and NiSi.
 
Source/Drain Design 
As the channel length becomes shorter, the bias voltage must be scaled down accordingly. Otherwise, the increased 
electrical field could induce avalanche breakdown at the drain. The source/drain structures shown in Fig. 7 have 
two sections. The extension near the channel has shallower junction depth to minimize short-channel effects. 
Usually it is doped less heavily (called a lightly doped drain (LDD)) to reduce the lateral peak field and to minimize 
impact ionization by hot carriers in the gate-to-drain overlap region. The deeper junction depth away from the 
channel helps to minimize the series resistance. The LDD structure can have two disadvantages, the fabrication 
complexity and the higher drain resistance. However, LDD will result in higher performance.
In the discussion of MOSFET current, the source and drain regions are assumed to be perfectly conducting. 
Due to the finite silicon resistivity and metal contact resistance, there is a small voltage drop in the source/drain 
region. In a long-channel MOSFET, the source/drain parasitic resistance is negligible compared with the channel 
resistance. In a short-channel MOSFET, the source/drain series resistance can be an appreciable fraction of the 
channel resistance and cause significant current degradation. 
A schematic diagram of the current-flow pattern in the source/drain region is shown in Fig. 9. The total 
source/drain resistance can be divided into several parts: Rac is the accumulation-layer resistance in the gate-
source (or -drain) overlap region where the current mainly stays near the surface; Rsp is associated with the current 
spreading from the surface layer into a uniform pattern across the depth of the source/drain; Rsh 
is the sheet resistance of the source/drain region where the current flows uniformly; and Rco is the contact 
resistance in the region where the current flows into a metal line. Once the current flows into an aluminum line, 
there is very little additional resistance, since the resistivity of aluminum is very low.
202 Semiconductors

There are three ways to reduce the source/drain series resistance. 
 
(a) Silicide Contact Technology
A major milestone for source/drain design is the development of silicide contact technology. A highly conductive 
silicide film is formed on all the gate and source/drain surfaces separated by dielectric spacers in a self-aligned 
process, as shown in Fig. 7. (This self-aligned silicide process has been called salicide.) The details of silicide 
formation will be described in Chapter 12 (Section 12.5.6). Since the sheet resistivity of silicide is 1~2 orders of 
magnitude lower than that of the source/drain, the silicide layer practically shunts all the currents. Both Rsh and Rco 
are greatly reduced. The only significant contribution to Rsh is from the nonsilicided region under the spacer. 
 
(b) Schottky-Barrier Source/Drain
Instead of a p-n junction, the use of Schottky-barrier contacts for the source and drain of a MOSFET, as shown 
in Fig. 10a, can yield some advantages in fabrication and performance. For a Schottky contact, the junction depth 
can effectively be made zero to minimize the short-channel effects. n-p-n bipolar-transistor action is also absent for 
undesirable effects such as the bipolar breakdown and latch-up (see Section 6.2.2) phenomena in CMOS circuits. 
In addition, the elimination of high-temperature implantation can promote better quality in the oxides and better 
device control. 
At thermal equilibrium with VG = VD = 0, the barrier height of the metal to the p-substrate for holes is qϕBp 
(e.g., 0.84 eV for an ErSi-Si contact), as shown in Fig. 10b. When the gate voltage is above threshold to invert 
the surface from p-type to n-type, the barrier height between the source and the inversion layer (electrons) is qϕBn 
= 0.28 eV, as shown in Fig. 10c. Note that the source contact is reverse-biased under operating conditions (Fig. 
10d). For a 0.28 eV barrier, the thermionic-type reverse-saturation current density is of the order of 103 A/cm2 
at room temperature. To increase current density, metals should be chosen to give the highest majority-carrier 
barrier so the minority-carrier barrier height is minimized, as seen in Eq. 3 in Chapter 7. Additional current due to 
tunneling through the barrier should help improve the supply of channel carriers. Currently, making the structure 
on a p-type Si substrate for n-channel MOSFET is more difficult than a p-channel device with n-substrate because 
metals and silicides that give large barrier heights on p-type silicon are less common.   
The disadvantages of the Schottky source/drain are high series resistance due to the finite barrier height, and 
higher drain leakage current. As also shown in Fig. 10, the metal or silicide contact has to extend underneath the 
gate for continuity. This process is much more demanding than a junction source/drain which is done by self-
aligned implantation diffusion.

layer resistance, Rsp is spreading resistance, Rsh is the sheet resistance, and Rco is the contact resistance.

Note that an extension underneath the spacer is still needed for continuity.

6.2 CMOS AND BiCMOS
Complementary MOS (CMOS) refers to a complementary p-channel and n-channel MOSFET pair. CMOS logic 
is the most popular technology utilized in present-day integrated circuit design. The main reasons for the success 
of CMOS are low power consumption and good noise immunity.
6.2.1 
The CMOS Inverter
A CMOS inverter, which is the basic element of CMOS logic circuits, is shown in Fig. 12. In a CMOS inverter, 
the gates of the p- and n-channel transistors are connected and serve as the input node to the inverter. The drains 
of the two transistors are also connected and serve as the output node to the inverter. The source and substrate 
contacts of the n-channel MOSFET are grounded, whereas those of the p-channel MOSFET are connected to the 
power supply (VDD). Note that both p-channel and n-channel MOSFETs are enhancement-type transistors. When 
the input voltage is low (e.g., Vin = 0, VGSn = 0 < VTn), the n-channel MOSFET is off.* The p-channel MOSFET, 
however, is on, since |VGSp| ≅ VDD > |VTp| (VGSp and VTp are negative). Consequently, the output node is charged to 
VDD through the p-channel MOSFET. When the input voltage goes high so that the gate voltage equals VDD, the 
n-channel MOSFET is turned on, since VGSn = VDD > VTn, and the p-channel MOSFET is turned off, since |VGSp| ≅ 
0 < |VTp|. Therefore, the output node is discharged to ground through the n-channel MOSFET.
For a more detailed understanding of the operation of the CMOS inverter, we can plot the output 
characteristics of the transistors. This plot is given in Fig. 13, in which Ip and In are shown as a function of output 
voltage (Vout). Ip is the current of p-channel MOSFET in the direction from the source (connected to VDD) to the 
drain (output node). In is the current of n-channel MOSFET in the direction from the drain (output node) to the 
source (connected to ground). Note that the increase in input voltage (Vin) tends to increase In but decrease Ip at 
fixed Vout. In steady state, however, In should be equal to Ip. For a given Vin, we can determine the corresponding 
Vout from the intercept of In(Vin) and Ip(Vin), as shown in Fig. 13. The Vin-Vout curve, as shown in Fig. 14, is called 
the transfer curve of the CMOS inverter.4
An important characteristic of the CMOS inverter is that when the output is in a steady logic state, i.e., Vout 
= 0 or VDD , only one transistor is on. The current flow from the power supply to ground is thus very low and is 
equal to the leakage current of the off device. In fact, there is significant current conduction only during the short 
transient period when the two devices are temporarily on. Therefore the power consumption is very low in the 
static state compared with other types of logic circuits, such as n-channel MOSFETs, bipolar, etc.

6.2.2  Latch-up
In order to fabricate both p-channel and n-channel MOSFETs in the same chip for CMOS applications, extra 
doping and diffusion steps are needed to form the “well” or “tub” in the substrate. The doping type in the well is 
different from that of the surrounding substrate. Typical well types are the p-well, n-well, and twin well. Details of 
the well technology are given in Chapter 15. Figure 15 shows a cross-sectional view of a CMOS inverter fabricated 
using p-well technology. In this figure, the p-channel and n-channel MOSFETs are fabricated in the n-type Si 
substrate and the p-well region, respectively.
A major problem related to the well structure in CMOS circuits is the latch-up phenomenon. The cause of 
latch-up is the action of the parasitic p-n-p-n diode in the well structure. As shown in Fig. 15, the parasitic p-n-
p-n diode consists of a lateral p-n-p and a vertical n-p-n bipolar transistor. The p-channel MOSFET’s source, 
n-substrate, and p-well correspond to the emitter, base, and collector of the lateral p-n-p bipolar transistor, 
206 Semiconductors

respectively. The n-channel MOSFET’s source, p-well, and n-substrate are the emitter, base, and collector of the 
vertical n-p-n bipolar transistor, respectively. The equivalent circuit of the parasitic components is illustrated in 
Fig. 16, where RS and RW are the series resistance in the substrate and the well, respectively. The base of each 
transistor is driven by the collector of the other to form a positive feedback loop. This configuration is similar 
to the thyristor discussed in Chapter 4. Latch-up is induced when the current gain product of the two bipolar 
transistors, αnpn αpnp, is larger than 1. When latch-up occurs, a large current will flow from the power supply (VDD) 
to the ground contact. This can interrupt normal circuit operation and even destroy the chip itself because of the 
high power dissipation required.
To avoid latch-up, the current gains of the parasitic bipolar transistors must be reduced. One method is to 
use gold doping or neutron irradiation to lower the minority carrier lifetimes. However, this approach is difficult 
to control. Besides, it also causes an increase of the leakage current. A deeper well structure or high-energy 
implantation to form retrograde wells can also reduce the current gain of the vertical bipolar transistor by raising 
the impurity concentration in the base. In the retrograde well, the peak of the well doping concentration is located 
within the substrate away from the surface.

Fig. 16 Equivalent circuit of the p-well structure shown in Fig. 15.
Advanced MOSFET and Related Devices 207

Fig. 17 Prevention of latch-up with a heavily doped substrate.7  
Another way to reduce latch-up is to use a heavily doped substrate with devices fabricated on a lightly doped 
epitaxial layer, as shown7 in Fig. 17. The heavily doped substrate provides a highly conductive path to collect the 
current. The current then is drained away through the surface contacts (Vsub).
Latch-up can also be avoided with the trench isolation scheme. A process for forming trench isolation is 
discussed in Chapter 15. This approach can eliminate latch-up because the n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs are 
physically isolated by the trench.
6.2.3 
CMOS Image Sensor
For consumer imaging products such as digital cameras and video recorders, the CCD image sensor discussed 
in Section 5.4, Chapter 5, dominates the market. However, since the late 1990s8 this huge market has been 
increasingly eroded by the CMOS image sensor fabricated by using standard CMOS processes.
In principle a CMOS image sensor, shown in Fig. 18,9 has a very similar architecture to a semiconductor 
memory. It is composed of an array of identical pixels. Each pixel has a photodiode (a p-n junction photodiode10), 
that converts incident light into photocurrent, and an addressing transistor that acts as a switch, as shown in Fig. 
19a. A Y-addressing or scan register is used to address the sensor line by line, by activating the in-pixel addressing 
transistor. An X-addressing or scan register is used to address the pixels on one line, one after another. Some of 
the readout circuits need to convert the photocurrent into electric charge or voltage and to read it off the array.
The working principle of a pixel is as follows: (1) at the beginning of an exposure the photodiode is reverse 
biased to a high voltage; (2) during the exposure time, impinging photons decrease the reverse voltage across 
the photodiode; (3) at the end of the exposure time the remaining voltage across the diode is measured, and the 
voltage drop from the original value is a measure of the number of photons falling on the photodiode during the 
exposure time; (4) the photodiode is reset to allow a new exposure cycle. 
The most basic form of imaging array shown in Fig. 19b is called PPS (passive pixel sensor), where in each 
pixel a select transistor controls each photodetector. The advantage is that many cells in a row are accessed at the 
same time, as in a memory array, so the speed is higher than CCD whose readout is serial in nature. The penalty is 
larger size.
Many of the differences between CCD and CMOS image sensors arise from differences in their readout 
architectures. In a CCD (see Fig. 20, Chapter 5), charge is shifted out of the array via vertical and horizontal 
CCDs, converted into voltage via a simple follower amplifier, and then serially read out. In a CMOS image sensor, 
charge voltage signals are read out one row at a time in a manner similar to a random-access memory using row 
and column select circuits.

CMOS image sensors.
The replacement of CCD by CMOS image sensors is growing due to the increasing integration of more 
functionality within each pixel discussed above, taking advantages of the conventional CMOS scaling and 
inexpensive technology. Moreover, the advantages of the CMOS image sensor include higher speed due to 
random-access capability, larger signal-to-noise ratio, lower power due to low vo1tage requirements, and low cost 
because of mainstream technology. Conversely, the CCD maintains some advantages such as small pixe1 size, 
low-light sensitivity, and high dynamic range. However, CCD requires a different process optimization, so CCD 
systems that include CMOS circuitry are naturally more expensive.

BiCMOS
CMOS has the advantages of low power dissipation and high device density that make it suitable for fabricating 
complex circuits. However, CMOS suffers from low drive capability compared with bipolar technology, which 
limits its circuit performance. BiCMOS is a technology that integrates both CMOS and bipolar device structures 
in the same chip. A BiCMOS circuit contains mostly CMOS devices, with a relatively small number of bipolar 
devices. The bipolar devices have better switching performance than their CMOS counterparts without consuming 
too much extra power. However, this performance enhancement is achieved at the expense of extra manufacturing 
complexity, longer fabrication time, and higher cost. The fabrication processes for BiCMOS are discussed in 
Chapter 15.
 
6.3 MOSFET ON INSULATOR
For certain applications, MOSFETs are fabricated on an insulating substrate rather than on a semiconductor 
substrate. The characteristics of these transistors are similar to those of an MOSFET. Usually, we call such devices 
thin film transistors (TFT) if the channel layer is an amorphous or polycrystalline silicon. If the channel layer is a 
monocrystalline silicon, we call it silicon-on-insulator (SOI).
6.3.1 
Thin Film Transistor (TFT)
Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and polysilicon are the two most popular materials for TFT fabrication. 
They are usually deposited on an insulating substrate such as a glass, quartz, or Si substrate with a thin SiO2 
capping layer.
The a-Si:H TFT is an important device in electronic applications that require a large area, such as liquid 
crystal displays (LCD) and contact imaging sensors (CIS). The a-Si:H materials are usually deposited with a 
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. Since the deposition temperature is low (typically 
200° – 400°C), inexpensive substrate materials such as glass can be used. The role played by the hydrogen atoms 
contained in the a-Si:H is to passivate dangling bonds in the amorphous silicon matrix and thus reduce the defect 
density. Without hydrogen passivation, the gate voltage cannot adjust the Fermi level at the insulator and the a-Si 
interface, since the Fermi level is pinned by the large amount of defects.
The a-Si:H TFT is usually fabricated using the inverted staggered structure, as shown in Fig. 20. The inverted 
staggered structure is a bottom-gate scheme. A metal gate can be used since the post-process temperature is 
low (< 400°C). A dielectric layer such as silicon nitride or silicon dioxide, also deposited by PECVD, is often 
used as the gate dielectric. An undoped a-Si:H layer is subsequently deposited to form the channel. The source 
and drain of the TFT are formed with an in situ–doped n+ a-Si:H layer complying with the requirement of low 
process temperature. A dielectric layer that serves as an etch- stop for patterning of n+ a-Si:H is often used. Device 
characteristics of TFTs with the bottom-gate structure are usually better than those with the top-gate structure. 
This is because the a-Si:H channel could be damaged by plasma during PECVD gate-dielectric deposition of 
top-gated TFTs. In addition, the source/drain formation process is easier for the bottom-gate structure. A typical 
subthreshold characteristic of the a-Si:H TFT is shown in Fig. 21. Because of the amorphous matrix present in the 
channel material, its carrier mobility is usually very low (< 1 cm2/V-s).
The polysilicon TFT uses a thin polysilicon as the channel layer. Polysilicon consists of many Si grains. Within 
the grains are the monocrystalline Si lattices. The orientations of two side-by-side grains are, however, different 
from each other. The interface between the two grains is called the grain boundary. Polysilicon TFT exhibits 
much higher carrier mobility and thus better drive capability than a-Si:H TFT because of higher crystallinity. 
Carrier mobility of these devices typically ranges from 10 to several hundred cm2/V-s, depending on the grain 
size and process conditions. Polysilicon is usually deposited with low-pressure CVD (LPCVD). The grain size of 
polysilicon is an important factor in determining TFT performance, since the carrier mobility generally decreases 
with decreasing grain size. This is mainly because of the large number of defects contained in the grain boundaries 
that impede the transport of carriers.

Fig. 21 Subthreshold characteristics of an a-Si:H TFT (L/Z = 10/60 μm/μm). The field-effect carrier mobility  
is 0.23 cm2/ V-s.
The defects at the grain boundary can also affect the threshold voltage and subthreshold swing of the device. 
When gate voltage is applied to induce an inversion layer in the channel, these defects act as traps and impede 
the movement of the Fermi level in the forbidden gap. To alleviate these drawbacks, a hydrogenation step is often 
adopted after device fabrication. The hydrogenation treatment is usually done in a plasma reactor. Hydrogen 
atoms or ions generated in the plasma diffuse into the grain boundaries and passivate these defects. After 
hydrogenation, there is significant improvement in device performance. 
Unlike a-Si:H TFT, polysilicon TFT is usually fabricated with the top-gate structure, as shown in Fig. 22. A 
self-aligned implant is used to form the source/drain. One main limitation of polysilicon TFT manufacturing is 
the high process temperature (> 600°C). Consequently, expensive substrates such as quartz are usually needed to 
tolerate the high process temperatures. This makes polysilicon TFT less attractive than a-Si:H TFT in production 
for low-end applications because of higher cost. Laser crystallization of Si is a potential way to overcome the 
problem. In this method, an a-Si layer is deposited first on a glass substrate at low temperatures by PECVD

or LPCVD. A high-power laser source is then used to irradiate the a-Si. The energy is absorbed by the a-Si  
and melting occurs locally in the a-Si layer. After cooling, the a-Si turns into polysilicon with very large grain  
size (≥ 1 μm). Very high carrier mobility, approaching that of crystalline Si MOSFETs, can be obtained using  
this method.
6.3.2  Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) Devices
Many SOI devices have been proposed, including silicon-on-sapphire (SOS), silicon-on-spinel, silicon-on-nitride, 
and silicon-on-oxide.11 Figure 23 shows a schematic diagram of an SOI CMOS built on silicon dioxide. Compared 
with CMOS built on a bulk Si substrate (also called bulk CMOS), SOI’s isolation scheme is simple and does not 
need complicated well structures. Device density can thus be increased. The latch-up phenomenon inherent in 
bulk CMOS circuits is also eliminated. The parasitic junction capacitance in the source and drain regions can 
be significantly reduced with the insulating substrate. Additionally, significant improvement over bulk CMOS in 
radiation-damage toleration is achieved in SOI because of the small volume of Si available for electron-hole pair 
generation by radiation. This property is particularly important for space applications.
Depending on the thickness of the Si channel layer, SOI can be classified into partially depleted (PD) and 
fully depleted (FD) types. PD-SOI uses a thicker Si channel layer so that the depletion width of the channel does 
not exceed the thickness of Si layer. Device design and performance of a PD-SOI are similar to that of bulk 
CMOS. One major difference is the floating substrate used in SOI devices. During device operation, a high field 
near the drain could induce impact ionization there. Majority carriers (holes in the p-substrate for an n-channel 
MOSFET) generated by impact ionization will be stored in the substrate, since there is no substrate contact to

drain away these charges. Therefore, the substrate potential will be changed, which results in a reduction of the 
threshold voltage. This, in turn, may cause an increase or a kink in the current-voltage characteristics. The kink 
phenomenon is shown11 in Fig. 24. This float-body or kink effect is especially dramatic for n-channel devices, 
because of the higher impact-ionization rate of electrons. The kink effect can be eliminated by forming a substrate 
contact to the source of the transistor. This will, however, complicate the device layout and process flow.
FD-SOI uses a Si layer thin enough so that the channel of the transistor is completely depleted before 
threshold is reached. This allows the device to be operated at a lower voltage. In addition, the kink effect caused by 
high-field impact ionization can be eliminated. FD-SOI is very attractive for low-power applications. Nevertheless, 
the FD-SOI’s characteristics are sensitive to variation in the Si thickness. If an FD-SOI circuit is built on a wafer 
with nonuniform Si thickness, its operation will be unstable.
 EXAMPLE 1
Calculate the threshold voltage for an n-channel SOI device having NA = 1017 cm–3, d = 5 nm, and Qf /q = 5 × 1011 
cm–2. Si thickness, dSi, for the device is 50 nm.
SOLUTION From Ex. 1, Chapter 5, the maximum depletion width, Wm, for a bulk NMOS device is 100 nm. 
Therefore, the SOI device is a fully depleted type. Since the width of the depletion region is now the Si thickness, 
Wm used in Eq. 17 and Eq. 47, Chapter 5 for calculating the threshold voltage should be replaced by dSi:

6.3.3  Three-Dimensional Structures
In device scaling, the optimum design entails MOSFET built on a body of an ultra-thin layer so that the body 
is fully depleted under the whole bias range. A design to achieve this more efficiently is to have a surround gate 
structure that encloses the body layer from at least two sides. Two examples of these three-dimensional structures 
are shown in Fig. 25. They can be classified according to their current-flow pattern: the horizontal transistor12 
(FinFET, the fabrication process, introduced in Chapter 15) and the vertical transistor13. Both of these are very 
challenging from a fabrication point of view. The horizontal transistor is more compatible with SOI technology.
Advanced MOSFET and Related Devices 213

Fig. 25 Schematic three-dimensional MOSFETs. (a) Horizontal structure. (b) Vertical structure.
A set of difficulties arise because the majority or all of the channel surface is on a vertical wall for both of these 
structures. This presents great challenges in achieving a smooth channel surface from etching and growth or 
deposition of gate dielectrics on these surfaces. Formation of the source/drain junction is no longer trivial by 
means of ion implantation. Salicide formation will also be much more difficult. Whether one of these turns out to 
be the future device of choice remains to be seen.
 
6.4  MOS MEMORY STRUCTURES
Semiconductor memories can be classified as volatile and nonvolatile. Volatile memories such as dynamic 
random-access memories (DRAMs) and static random-access memories (SRAMs) lose their stored information 
if the power supply is switched off. Nonvolatile memories, on the other hand, can retain the stored information. 
Currently, DRAM and SRAM are extensively used in personal computers and workstations, mainly because of 
DRAM’s attributes of high density and low cost and SRAM’s attribute of high speed. The nonvolatile memory 
is used extensively in portable electronics systems such as the cellular phone, digital camera, and smart IC cards, 
mainly because of its attributes of low-power consumption and nonvolatility.
6.4.1 
DRAM
Modern DRAM technology consists of a cell array using the storage cell structure shown14 in Fig. 26. The cell 
includes an MOSFET and an MOS capacitor [i.e., one transistor/one capacitor (1T/1C) cell]. The MOSFET acts 
as a switch to control the writing, refreshing, and read-out actions of the cell. The capacitor is used for charge 
storage. During the write cycle, the MOSFET is turned on so that the logic state in the bit line is transferred to the 
storage capacitor. For practical applications, charges stored in the capacitor will be gradually lost because of the 
small but nonnegligible leakage current of the storage node. Consequently, the operation of DRAM is “dynamic,” 
since the data need to be refreshed periodically within a fixed interval, typically 2–50 ms.
The 1T/1C DRAM cell has the advantages of very simple and small area construction. In order to increase 
the storage density of a chip, aggressive scaling of the cell size is necessary. However, this will degrade the storage 
capability of the capacitor, since the capacitor electrode area will be diminished as well. To solve this problem, 
three-dimensional (3-D) capacitor structures are required. Some novel 3-D capacitor structures are discussed in 
Chapter 15. High dielectric-constant materials can also be used to replace conventional oxide-nitride composite 
layers (dielectric constant: 4 ~ 6) as the capacitor dielectric materials in order to increase the capacitance.

6.4.2 
SRAM
SRAM is a matrix of static cells using a bistable flip-flop structure to store the logic state, as shown in Fig. 27. 
The flip-flop consists of two cross-coupled CMOS inverters (T1, T3 and T2, T4). The output of the inverter 
is connected to the input node of the other inverter. This configuration is called “latched.” Two additional 
n-channel MOSFETs, T5 and T6, with their gates connected to the word line, are used to access the SRAM cell. 
The operation of the SRAM is static since the logic state is sustained as long as the power is applied. Therefore, 
SRAM does not have to be refreshed. The two p-channel MOSFETs (T1 and T2) in the inverters are used as 
the load transistors. There is essentially no dc current flow through the cell, except during switching. In some 
situations, p-channel polysilicon TFTs or polysilicon resistors are used instead of bulk p-channel MOSFETs. 
These polysilicon load devices can be fabricated over the bulk n-channel MOSFETs. 3-D integration can effectively 
reduce the cell area and thus increase the storage capacity of the chip.
6.4.3 
Nonvolatile Memory
When the gate electrode of a conventional MOSFET is modified so that semipermanent charge storage inside 
the gate is possible, the new structure becomes a nonvolatile memory device. Since the first nonvolatile memory 
device was proposed15 in 1967, various device structures have been made. Nonvolatile memory devices have been 
used extensively in ICs such as the erasable-programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable-
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and flash memory.
There are two groups of nonvolatile memory devices, floating-gate devices and charge-trapping devices (Fig. 
28). In both types of devices, charges are injected from the silicon substrate across the first insulator and stored 
in the floating gate or in the nitride. The stored charges give rise to a threshold-voltage shift, and the device is 
switched to a high-threshold state (programmed or logical 1). In a well-designed memory device, the charge 
retention time can be over 100 years. To return to the low-threshold state (erased or logical 0), a gate or other 
means (such as ultraviolet light) can be applied to erase the stored charges.
 
Floating-Gate Devices
In floating-gate memory devices, charge is injected to the floating gate to change the threshold voltage. The 
programming can be done by either hot carrier injection or a Fowler-Nordheim tunneling process. Figure 29a, 
which is the same as Fig. 28b, shows the hot electron injection scheme in an n-channel floating-gate device. Near 
the drain, the lateral field is at its highest level. The channel electrons acquire energy from the field and become hot 
electrons. Some of the hot electrons with energy higher than the barrier height of SiO2/Si conduction band (~3.2 
eV) can surmount the barrier and are injected into the floating gate. At the same time, the high field also induces 
impact ionization. These generated secondary hot electrons can also be injected to the floating gate. Figure 29b 
and c show the band diagrams of a floating-gate device under programming and erasing conditions, respectively.

In the programming mode, the electric field across the bottom oxide layer is most critical. On application of 
a positive voltage VG to the control gate, an electric field is established in each of the two dielectrics. We have, from 
Gauss’ law, that (assuming the voltage drop in the semiconductor is small):
 
ε1E 1 = ε2E 2 + Q 
(4)
and
 
VG = V1 + V2 = d1E1 + d2E2 , 
(5)
where the subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to the bottom and top oxide layer respectively, and Q (negative) is the 
stored charge in the floating gate. In practical devices, the bottom layer has a tunnel oxide of ~ 8 nm, while the top 
insulator stack typically has an equivalent oxide thickness of ~ 14 nm.

The threshold-voltage shift can be measured directly as shown in the ID-VG plots (Fig. 30). Alternately, this

The change in VT results in a change in the channel conductance gD. The gD-VG plot shifts to the right by ΔVT.
To erase the stored charge, a negative bias is applied to the control gate or a positive bias to the source/drain. 
The process is the reverse of the programming process, and the stored electrons tunnel out of the floating gate to 
the substrate.
Figure 28a shows a floating-gate memory device without the control gate. The first EPROM was developed 
using heavily doped polysilicon as the floating-gate material. The polysilicon gate is embedded in oxide and 
is completely isolated. Similar to the stacked-gate transistor shown in Fig. 29, the drain junction is biased to 
avalanche breakdown, and electrons in the avalanche plasma are injected from the drain region into the floating

gate. This device is known as a floating-gate avalanche-injection MOS memory (FAMOS). To erase the FAMOS 
memory, ultraviolet light or x-ray is used, which can excite the stored charges into the conduction band of the gate 
oxide and back to the substrate. Electrical erasing cannot be used because the device has no external gate.   
Flash Memory
Several types of floating-gate devices are differentiated by the erase mechanisms. In the EPROM, which has only a 
floating gate and no control gate, erasing is done by UV irradiation. The EPROM has the advantage of small cell 
area due to the 1T (one storage transistor)/cell structure. Nevertheless, its erase scheme necessitates the use of an 
expensive package with a quartz window. In addition, the erasing time is long. 
The EEPROM uses the tunneling process to erase the stored charges. Unlike the EPROM device, in which 
all cells are erased during erasing, a cell in an EEPROM can be erased only when it is “selected.” This function 
is accomplished through the selection transistor contained in each cell. Such “bit-erasable” characteristics make 
the EEPROM more flexible. However, the 2T (one selection transistor plus one storage transistor)/cell feature of 
EEPROM limits its storage capacity.
The cell structure of flash memory consists of three layers of polysilicon, as shown in Fig. 31.16 The cell is 
programmed by a channel hot carrier injection mechanism similar to EPROM. Erasing is accomplished by field 
emission of electrons from the floating gate to an erase gate. The erase gate is supplied with a boosted voltage 
that makes possible field emission from the floating gate. The erasing speed is much faster than that of EPROM, 
whence the name “flash.” The storage cells for a flash memory are divided into several sectors (or blocks). 
The erasing scheme is performed on one selected sector with the tunneling process. During erasing, all cells in 
the selected sector are erased simultaneously. The third polysilicon layer is used both as a gate of the selection 
transistor and a control gate of the cell, and the 1T/cell feature makes the storage capacity of the flash memory 
higher than that of EEPROM.
Single-electron Memory Cell
A related device structure is the single-electron memory cell (SEMC), which is a limiting case of the floating-gate 
structure17. By reducing the length of the floating gate to ultrasmall dimensions, say 10 nm, we obtain the SEMC. 
A cross-sectional view of an SEMC is shown in Fig. 32. The floating dot corresponds to the floating gate in Fig. 
28b. Because of its small size the capacitance is also very small (~1 aF). When an electron tunnels into the floating 
dot, because of the small capacitance, a large tunneling barrier arises to prevent the transfer of another electron. 
SEMC is the ultimate floating-gate memory cell, since we need only one electron for information storage. A single-
electron memory with densities as high as 256 terabits (256 × 1012 bits) that can operate at room temperature has 
been projected.

Charge-Trapping Devices
 
MNOS Transistor
In the MNOS transistor as shown in Fig. 28c, the silicon-nitride layer is used as an efficient material to trap 
electrons as current passes through the dielectric. Other insulators instead of the silicon-nitride film, such as 
aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, and titanium oxide, have been used but are not as common. Electrons are 
trapped in the nitride layer close to the oxide-nitride interface. The function of the oxide is to provide a good 
interface to the semiconductor and to prevent back-tunneling of the injected charge for better charge retention. Its 
thickness has to be balanced between retention time and programming voltage and time. 
    Figure 33 shows the basic band diagram for the programming and erasing operations. In the programming 
process, a large positive bias is applied to the gate. Electrons are emitted from the substrate to the gate. The current 
conduction mechanisms in the two dielectric layers are very different. The current through the oxide is by electrons 
tunneling through the trapezoidal oxide barrier, followed by a triangular barrier in the nitride. This form of 
tunneling has been identified as modified Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, as opposed to Fowler-Nordheim tunneling 
through a single triangular barrier. Then, electrons pass through the nitride layer by Frenkel-Poole transport. 
When the negative charge starts to build up, the oxide field decreases and the modified Fowler-Nordheim 
tunneling starts to limit the current.
The threshold voltage is shown in Fig. 34 as a function of programming pulse width. Initially, the threshold 
voltage changes linearly with time, followed by a logarithmic dependence, and finally it tends to saturate. 
This programming speed is largely affected by the choice of oxide thickness: a thinner oxide allows shorter 
programming time. Programming speed must be balanced with charge retention time, since too thin an oxide will 
allow the trapped charge to tunnel back to the silicon substrate.

where the capacitances Cox = εox/dox and Cn = εn/dn correspond to the oxide and nitride layers, respectively. The

In the erasing process, a large negative bias is applied to the gate (Fig. 33b). Traditionally, the discharge process 
was believed to be due to the tunneling of trapped electrons back to the silicon substrate. New evidence shows that 
the major process is due to tunneling of holes from the substrate to neutralize the trapped electrons. The discharge 
process as a function of pulse width is also shown in Fig. 34.
The advantages of the MNOS transistor include reasonable speed for programming and erasing, so it is a 
candidate as a nonvolatile RAM device. It also has superior radiation hardness, due to minimal oxide thickness 
and the absence of a floating gate. The drawbacks of the MNOS transistor are large programming and erasing 
voltages and nonuniform threshold voltage from device to device. The passage of tunneling current gradually 
increases the interface-trap density at the semiconductor surface and also causes a loss of trapping efficiency due 
to leakage or tunneling of trapped electrons back to the substrate. These result in a narrowing threshold voltage 
window after many cycles of programming and erasing. The major reliability problem of the MNOS transistor is 
the continuous loss of charge through the thin oxide. It should be pointed out that, unlike a floating-gate structure, 
the programming current has to pass through the entire channel region, so that the trapped charge is distributed 
uniformly throughout the channel. In a floating-gate transistor, the charge injected to the floating gate can 
redistribute itself within the gate material, and injection can take place locally anywhere along the channel.

SONOS Transistor
The SONOS (silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon) transistor (Fig. 28d) is sometimes called the MONOS (metal-
oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon) transistor. It is similar to an MNOS transistor except that it has an additional blocking 
oxide layer placed between the gate and the nitride layer, forming an ONO (oxide-nitride-oxide) stack. This top 
oxide layer is usually similar in thickness to the bottom oxide layer. The function of the blocking oxide is to 
prevent electron injection from the metal to the nitride layer during erase operation. As a result, a thinner nitride 
layer can be used, leading to lower programming voltage as well as better charge retention. The SONOS transistor 
now replaces the older MNOS configuration but the operation principle remains the same.

Semiconductors

 
6.5  POWER MOSFET
The input impedance of MOS devices is very high because of the insulating SiO2 between the gate and 
semiconductor channel. This feature makes the MOSFET an attractive candidate in power-device applications. 
Because of the high-input impedance, the gate leakage is very low, and thus the power MOSFET does not require 
complex input drive circuitry compared with bipolar devices. In addition, the switching speed of the power 
MOSFET is much faster than that of the power bipolar device. This is because the unipolar characteristics of 
MOS operation do not involve storage or recombination of minority carriers during turn-off.
The basic operation of power MOSFETs is the same as that of any MOSFET. However, the current handing 
capability is usually in the ampere range. Large current can be obtained with a large channel width. The drain 
to source blocking voltage is in the range of 50 to 100 volts or even higher. In general, power MOSFETs employ 
thicker oxides and deeper junctions, and have longer channel lengths. These generally post a penalty on device 
performance such as transconductance (gm) and speed (fT). However, power MOSFET applications have been on 
the rise, for example, due to the increasing demand of cellular phones and cellular base stations that require extra-
high voltage.
Figure 35 shows three basic power MOSFET structures.18 Unlike the MOSFET structure used in advanced 
integrated circuits, the power MOSFETs employ a vertical structure with the source and drain at the top and 
bottom surfaces of the wafer, respectively. This vertical scheme has the benefit of large channel width and reduced 
field crowding at the gate. These properties are important for power applications.
 Figure 35a is the V-MOSFET, in which the gate has a V-shaped groove. The V-shaped groove can be formed 
by preferential wet-etching using a KOH solution. When the gate voltage is larger than the threshold voltage, an 
inversion channel is induced at the surface along the edge of the V-shaped groove and forms the conductive path 
between source and drain. One main limitation of V-MOSFET development is related to process control. The high 
field at the tip of the V-shaped groove may lead to current crowding there and degrade device performance.
Figure 35b shows the cross-section of the U-MOSFET, which is similar to the V-MOSFET. The U-shaped 
trench is formed by reactive ion etching, and the electric fields at the bottom corners are substantially lower than 
that at the tip of the V-shaped groove. Another power MOSFET is the D-MOSFET, shown in Fig. 35c. The gate 
is formed at the top surface and then serves as a mask for the subsequent double-diffusion process. The double 
diffusion process (the reason why it is called “D”-MOSFET) is used to take advantage of the higher diffusion rate 
of the p-dopant (e.g., boron) than the n+ dopant (e.g. phosphorus) to determine the channel length between the 
p-base and n+ source portions. This technique can yield very short channels without depending on a lithographic 
mask. The advantages of D-MOSFET are its short drift time across the p-base region and the avoidance of high-
field corners.
There is an n– region in the drain for all the three power MOSFET structures. The doping concentration 
of the n– drift region is lower than the p-base region. When a positive voltage is applied to the drain and the 
drain/p-base junction is reverse biased, most of the depletion width will be developed across the n– drift region. 
Consequently, the doping level and width of the n– drift region are important parameters that determine the 
drain blocking voltage capability. On the other hand, there is a parasitic n-p-n–-n+ device in the power MOSFET 
structures. To prevent the action of the bipolar transistor during power MOSFET operation, the p-base and n+ 
source (emitter) are shorted, as shown in Fig. 35. This can keep the p-base at a fixed potential.

SUMMARY
The Si MOSFET is the most important device in advanced integrated-circuit (IC) applications. Its success is 
ascribed mainly to the high-quality SiO2 material and its stable Si/SiO2 interface properties. CMOS technology 
is currently the only viable solution meeting the stringent requirement for low power consumption in an IC chip, 
and is widely implemented. Superior power dissipation performance can be understood from the discussion of the 
CMOS inverter.
Scaling down of device dimensions is a continuing trend in CMOS technology to increase the device density, 
operating speed, and functionality of a chip. The short-channel effects, however, cause deviations in device 
operation and require attention in device scaling. Optimization of device structural parameters depends on the 
main requirement of the applications, such as minimized power consumption or faster operating speed,
224 Semiconductors

TFT and SOI are MOSFET devices fabricated on insulating substrates, in contrast to the conventional 
MOSFETs fabricated on a bulk Si substrate. TFT uses an amorphous or polycrystalline semiconductor as the 
active channel layer. The carrier mobility of the TFT is degraded by the presence of a large number of defects in 
the channel. However, TFT can be applied to a large-area substrate, which is difficult for bulk MOS technology, 
e.g., the switching element of pixels in a large-area flat-panel display. TFT can also be used as the load devices in 
the SRAM cell. SOI MOSFETs use a monocrystalline Si channel layer. Compared with bulk-MOS devices, SOI 
devices provide lower parasitic junction capacitance and improved resistance to radiation damage. SOI is also 
more attractive for low-power, high-speed applications.
MOSFETs have been employed for semiconductor memory applications, including DRAM, SRAM, and 
nonvolatile memory. These products constitute a significant portion of the IC market. Owing to the aggressive 
shrinkage of device size, the storage capacity of the MOS memories improves rapidly. For example, the density of 
nonvolatile memories has doubled every 18 months and the single-electron memory has been projected to reach 
a multiterabit level. Finally, we considered three power MOSFETs. These devices use a vertical structure to allow 
higher operating voltage and current.

SUMMARY
The metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET) has current-voltage characteristics similar to those of 
a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). However, it uses a metal-semiconductor rectifying 
contact instead of a MOS structure for the gate electrode. In addition, the source and drain contacts of MESFET 
are ohmic,* whereas in a MOSFET they are p–n junctions.
Like other field-effect devices, a MESFET has a negative temperature coefficient at high current levels; that is, 
the current decreases as temperature increases. This characteristic leads to more uniform temperature distribution 
and the device is therefore thermally stable, even when the active area is large or when many devices are connected 
in parallel. Furthermore, because MESFETs can be made from compound semiconductors with high electron 
mobilities, such as GaAs and InP, they have higher switching speeds and higher cutoff frequencies than do silicon 
MOSFETs.
The basic building block of a MESFET is the metal-semiconductor contact. This contact is electrically similar 
to a one-sided abrupt p–n junction, yet it can be operated as a majority carrier device with inherently fast response. 
There are two types of metal-semiconductor contacts: the rectifying and the nonrectifying or ohmic types. In 
this chapter, we begin with the two types of contacts and then consider the basic characteristics and microwave 
performance of the MESFET. In the last section we discuss modulation-doped field-effect transistor (MODFET), 
which is similar to the device configuration of a MESFET but can offer even higher-speed performance.
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
The rectifying metal-semiconductor contact and its current-voltage characteristics.
r
The ohmic metal-semiconductor contact and its specific contact resistance.
r
The MESFET and its high-frequency performance. 
r
The MODFET and its two-dimensional electron gas.
r
A comparison of three field-effect transistors—MOSFET, MESFET, and MODFET.
*The concept of rectifying was discussed in Chapter 3; the concept of ohmic contact is presented in Section 7.1.

 
7.1 METAL-SEMICONDUCTOR CONTACTS
The first practical semiconductor device was the metal-semiconductor contact in the form of a point-contact 
rectifier, that is, a metallic whisker pressed against a semiconductor. The device found many applications 
beginning in 1904. In 1938, Schottky suggested that the rectifying behavior could arise from a potential barrier 
as a result of the stable space charges in the semiconductor.1 The model arising from this concept is known as 
the Schottky barrier. Metal-semiconductor contacts can also be nonrectifying; that is, the contact has negligible 
resistance regardless of the polarity of the applied voltage. This type of contact is called an ohmic contact. All 
semiconductor devices as well as integrated circuits need ohmic contact to make connections to other devices in 
an electronic system. We consider the energy band diagram and the current-voltage characteristics of both the 
rectifying and ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts.
7.1.1 Basic Characteristics
The characteristics of point-contact rectifiers were not reproducible from one device to another. The contact was 
just a simple mechanical contact or formed by an electrical discharge process that could result in a small alloyed 
p-n junction. The advantage of a point-contact rectifier is its small area, which can give very small capacitance, 
a desirable feature for microwave application.  The rectifiers are subject to wide variations such as the whisker 
pressure, contact area, crystal structure, whisker composition, and heat or forming processes, and they have 
been largely replaced by metal-semiconductor contacts fabricated by planar processes (see Chapters 11–15). A 
schematic diagram of such a device is shown in Fig. 1a. To fabricate the device, a window is opened in an oxide 
layer, and a metal layer is deposited in a vacuum system. The metal layer covering the window is subsequently 
defined by a lithographic step. We consider the one-dimensional structure of the metal-semiconductor contact 
shown in Fig. 1b, which corresponds to the central section in Fig. 1a, between the dashed lines.
Figure 2a shows the energy band diagram of an isolated metal adjacent to an isolated n-type semiconductor. 
Note that the metal work function qϕm is generally different from the semiconductor work function qϕs. The work 
function is defined as the energy difference between the Fermi level and the vacuum level. Also shown is the 
electron affinity qχ, which is the energy difference between the conduction band edge and the vacuum

structure of a metal-semiconductor contact.

level in the semiconductor. When the metal makes intimate contact with the semiconductor, the Fermi levels in the 
two materials must be equal at thermal equilibrium. In addition, the vacuum level must be continuous. These two 
requirements determine a unique energy band diagram for the ideal metal-semiconductor contact, as shown in 
Fig. 2b.
For this ideal case, the barrier height qϕBn is simply the difference between the metal work function and the 
semiconductor electron affinity§:
 
qϕBn = qϕm– qχ. 
(1)
Similarly, for the case of an ideal contact between a metal and a p-type semiconductor, the barrier height qϕBp is 
given by 
 
qϕBp = Eg – (qϕm – qχ), 
(2)
where Eg is the bandgap of the semiconductor. Therefore, for a given semiconductor and for any metal, the sum of 
the barrier heights on n-type and p-type substrates is expected to be equal to the bandgap:

On the semiconductor side in Fig. 2b, Vbi is the built-in potential that is seen by electrons in the conduction band 
trying to move into the metal.
 
Vbi = ϕBn – Vn.. 
(4)
The qVn is the distance between the bottom of the conduction band and the Fermi level. Similar results can be 
given for the p-type semiconductor.
§ Both qϕBn (in electron volts) and ϕBn (in volts) are referred to as the barrier height. 
230 Semiconductors

Fig. 3 Measured barrier height for metal-silicon and metal-gallium arsenide contacts.2,3
Figure 3 shows the measured barrier heights for n-type silicon2 and n-type gallium arsenide.3 Note that qϕBn 
increases with increasing qϕm. However, the dependence is not as strong as predicted by Eq. 1. This is because 
in practical Schottky diodes, the disruption of the crystal lattice at the semiconductor surface produces a large 
number of surface energy states located in the forbidden bandgap. These surface states can act as donors or 
acceptors that influence the final barrier height. For silicon and gallium arsenide, Eq. 1 generally underestimates 
the n-type barrier height and Eq. 2 overestimates the p-type barrier height. The sum of qϕBn and qϕBp, however, is in 
agreement with Eq. 3.
Figure 4 shows energy band diagrams for metals on both n-type and p-type semiconductors under different 
biasing conditions. Consider the n-type semiconductor first. When the bias voltage is zero, as shown in the left side 
of Fig. 4a, the band diagram is under a thermal equilibrium condition. The Fermi levels for both materials are 
equal. If we apply a positive voltage to the metal with respect to the n-type semiconductor, the semiconductor-to-
metal built-in potential decreases as shown on the left side of Fig. 4b. This is a forward bias. When a forward bias 
is applied, electrons can move easily from the semiconductor into the metal because the barrier has been reduced 
by a voltage VF. For a reverse bias (i.e., a negative voltage is applied to the metal), the barrier is increased by a 
voltage VR, as depicted on the left side of Fig. 4c. It is more difficult for electrons to flow from the semiconductor 
into the metal. We have similar results for p-type semiconductor, however, the polarities must be reversed. In the 
following derivations, we consider only the metal-n-type semiconductor contact. The results are equally applicable 
to a p-type semiconductor with an appropriate change of polarities. 
The charge and field distributions for a metal-semiconductor contact are shown in Fig. 5a and 5b, 
respectively. The metal is assumed to be a perfect conductor; the charge transferred to it from the semiconductor 
exists in a very narrow region at the metal surface. The extent of the space charge in the semiconductor is W, i.e., 
ρs = qND for x < W and ρs  = 0 for x > W. Thus, the charge distribution is identical to that of a one-sided abrupt 
p+-n junction.
The magnitude of the electric field decreases linearly with distance. The maximum electric field Em is located 
at the interface. The electric field distribution is then given by

Thus, measurements of the capacitance C per unit area as a function of voltage can provide the impurity

plotting 1/C2 versus V. Figure 6 is a plot of the measured capacitance versus voltage for tungsten-silicon and 
tungsten-gallium arsenide Schottky diodes.4 From Eq. 11, the intercept at 1/C2 = 0 corresponds to the built-in 
potential Vbi. Once Vbi is determined, the barrier height ϕBn can be calculated from Eq. 4.

Since the intercept Vbi  is 0.42 V, then the barrier height is ϕBn = 0.42 + 0.24 = 0.66 V. 
7.1.2 The Schottky Barrier 
A Schottky barrier refers to a metal-semiconductor contact having a large barrier height (i.e., ϕBn or ϕBp >> kT) and 
a low doping concentration that is less than the density of states in the conduction band or valence band.
The current transport in a Schottky barrier is due mainly to majority carriers, unlike a p-n junction where 
current transport is due mainly to minority carriers. For Schottky diodes operated at moderate temperature (e.g., 
300 K), the dominate transport mechanism is thermionic emission of majority carriers from the semiconductor 
over the potential barrier into the metal.
234 Semiconductors

Fig. 7 Current transport by the thermionic emission process. (a) Thermal equilibrium; (b) forward bias; and (c)  
reverse bias.5
Figure 7 illustrates the thermionic emission process.5 At thermal equilibrium (Fig. 7a), the current density 
is balanced by two equal and opposite flows of carriers, and thus there is zero net current. Electrons in the 
semiconductor tend to flow (or emit) into the metal, and there is an opposing balanced flow of electrons from 
metal into the semiconductor. These current components are proportional to the density of electrons at the 
boundary.
As discussed in Section 2.5 of Chapter 2, at the semiconductor surface an electron can be thermionically 
emitted into the metal if its energy is above the barrier height. Here the semiconductor work function qϕs is 
replaced by qϕBn, and

With the same argument for the reverse-bias condition (see Fig. 7c), the expression for the net current is identical 
to Eq. 16 except that VF is replaced by –VR.
The coefficient C1NC is found to be equal to A*T2, where A* is called the effective Richardson constant (in units 
of A/K2-cm2) and T is the absolute temperature. The value of A* depends on the effective mass and is equal to 110 
and 32 for n- and p-type silicon, respectively, and 8 and 74 for n- and p-type gallium arsenide, respectively.6

where Js is the saturation current density and the applied voltage V is positive for forward bias and negative 
for reverse bias. Experimental forward I-V characteristics of two Schottky diodes4 are shown in Fig. 8. By 
extrapolating the forward I-V curve to V = 0, we can find Js. From Js and Eq. 17a we can obtain the barrier height.
In addition to the majority carrier (electron) current, a minority-carrier (hole) current exists in a metal n-type 
semiconductor contact. The electron-hole pairs can be easily created in the valence band (interband transition) in 
the depletion region. Electrons in the valence band flow into the metal because there is no barrier there and holes 
diffuse into the semiconductor to form the minority current under forward bias. The hole diffusion current is the 
same as in a p-n junction, which is described in Chapter 3. The current density is given by

Under normal operating conditions, the minority-carrier diffusion current is orders of magnitude smaller than 
the majority-carrier current. Therefore, a Schottky diode is a unipolar device (i.e., predominately only one type of 
carrier participates in the conduction process). The minimum minority-carrier storage makes the Schottky barrier 
to operate at much higher frequencies (~100 GHz) compared to a p-n junction (~1 GHz).
 EXAMPLE 2
For a tungsten-silicon Schottky diode with ND = 1016 cm–3, find the barrier height and depletion-layer  
width from Fig. 8. Compare the saturation current Js with Jpo, assuming that the minority-carrier lifetime in 
Si is 10–6 s.
SOLUTION From Fig. 8, we have Js = 6.5 × 10–5 A/cm2. The barrier height can be obtained from Eq. 17a:

7.1.3 The Ohmic Contact 
An ohmic contact is defined as a metal-semiconductor contact that has a negligible contact resistance relative to 
the bulk or series resistance of the semiconductor. A satisfactory ohmic contact should not significantly degrade 
device performance and can pass the required current with a voltage drop that is small compared with the drop 
across the active region of the device. 
A figure of merit for ohmic contacts is the specific contact resistance RC, defined as

Equation 20 shows that a metal-semiconductor contact with a low barrier height should be used to obtain a small 
RC.
For contacts with high doping concentration, the barrier width becomes very narrow, and the tunneling 
current becomes dominant. The tunneling current, as described in the upper inset of Fig. 9, is proportional to the 
tunneling probability, which is given in Section 2.6 of Chapter 2:

The calculated values of RC are plotted6 in Fig. 9 as a function of 1/
ND . For ND ≥ 1019 cm–3, RC is dominated 
by the tunneling process and decreases rapidly with increased doping. On the other hand, for ND ≤ 1017 cm–3, 
the current is due to thermionic emission, and RC is essentially independent of doping. Also shown in Fig. 9 are 
experimental data for platinum silicide-silicon (PtSi-Si) and aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) diodes. They are in close 
agreement with the calculated values. Figure 9 shows that a high doping concentration, a low barrier height, or 
both must be used to obtain a low value of RC. These two approaches are used for all practical ohmic contacts.
 EXAMPLE 3
An ohmic contact has an area of 10–5 cm2 and a specific contact resistance of 10–6 Ω –cm2. The ohmic contact is 
formed in an n-type silicon. If ND = 5 × 1019 cm–3, ϕBn = 0.8 V, and the electron effective mass is 0.26 m0, find the 
voltage drop across the contact when a forward current of 1A flows through it.

become significant when the contact area is reduced to 10–8 cm2 or smaller. 
 
7.2 MESFET
7.2.1 Basic Device Structures 
The metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MESFET) was proposed7 in 1966. The MESFET has three metal-
semiconductor contacts—one Schottky barrier for the gate electrode and two ohmic contacts for the source and 
drain electrodes. A perspective view of a MESFET is illustrated in Fig. 10a. The basic device parameters include 
L, the gate length, Z, the gate width, and a, the thickness of the epitaxial layer. Most MESFETs are made of n- 
type III-V compound semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, because of their high electron mobilities, which 
help to minimize series resistances, and because of their high saturation velocities, which result in the increase in 
the cutoff frequency.
Practical MESFETs are fabricated by using epitaxial layers on semiinsulating substrates to minimize 
parasitic capacitances. In Fig. 10a, the ohmic contacts are labeled source and drain, and the Schottky barrier is 
labeled gate. A MESFET is often described in terms of the gate dimensions. If the gate length (L) is 0.5 μm and 
the gate width (Z) is 300 μm, the device is referred to as a 0.5 × 300 μm device. A microwave- or millimeter-wave 
device typically has a gate length in the range 0.1–1.0 μm. The  thickness  a  of  the  epitaxial layer is typically one-
third to one-fifth of the gate length. The spacing between the electrodes is one to four times that of the gate length. 
The current handling capability of a MESFET is directly proportional to the gate width Z because the cross-
sectional area available for channel current is proportional to Z.

region of a MESFET.
7.2.2 Principles of Operation 
To understand the operation of a MESFET, we consider the section under the gate, Fig. 10b. The source is 
grounded, and the gate and drain voltage are measured with respect to the source. Under normal operating 
conditions, the gate voltage is zero or reverse biased and the drain voltage is zero or forward biased; that is,  
VG ≤ 0 and VD ≥ 0. Since the channel is n-type material, the device is referred to as an n-channel MESFET. Most 
applications use the n-channel MESFET rather than the p-channel MESFET because of higher carrier mobility  
in n-channel devices.

where ND is the donor concentration, A is the cross-section area for current flow and equals Z(a – W), and W is the 
width of the depletion region of the Schottky barrier.
When no gate voltage is applied and VD is small, as shown in Fig. 11a, a small drain current ID flows in 
the channel. The magnitude of the current is given by VD/R, where R is the channel resistance given in Eq. 24. 
Therefore, the current varies linearly with the drain voltage. Of course, for any given drain voltage, the voltage 
along the channel increases from zero at the source to VD at the drain. Thus, the Schottky barrier becomes 
increasingly reverse biased as we proceed from the source to the drain. As VD is increased, W increases, and the 
average cross-sectional area for current flow is reduced. The channel resistance R also increases. As a result, the 
current increases at a slower rate.
MESFET and Related Devices 241

Fig. 11 Variation of the depletion-layer width and output characteristics of a MESFET under various biasing 
conditions. (a) VG = 0 and a small VD. (b) VG = 0 and at pinch-off. (c) VG = 0 at post pinch-off (VD > VDsat).  
(d) VG = –1V and a small VD.
As the drain voltage is further increased, eventually the depletion region touches the semiinsulating substrate, 
as shown in Fig. 11b.  This happens when W = a at the drain.  We can obtain the corresponding value of the drain 
voltage, called the saturation voltage, VDsat, from Eq. 7 where V = –VDsat:

At this drain voltage, the source and the drain are pinched off or completely separated by a reverse-biased 
depletion region. The location P in Fig. 11b is called the pinch-off point. At this point, a large drain current called 
the saturation current IDsat can flow across the depletion region. This is similar to the situation caused by injecting 
carriers into a reverse-biased depletion region such as the collector-base depletion region of a bipolar transistor. 
Beyond the pinch-off point, as VD is increased further, the depletion region near the drain will expand and 
point P will move toward the source, as indicated in Fig. 11c. However, the voltage at point P remains the same, 
VDsat. Thus, the number of electrons per unit time arriving from the source to point P, and hence the current 
flowing in the channel, remain the same because the potential drop in the channel from source to point P  does  
not change. Therefore, for drain voltages larger than VDsat, the current remains essentially at the value IDsat and is 
independent of VD.
When a gate voltage is applied to reverse bias the gate contact, the depletion-layer width W increases. For a 
small VD , the channel again acts as a resistor but its resistance is higher because the cross-sectional area available 
for current flow is decreased. As indicated in Fig. 11d, the initial current is smaller for VG = –1 V than for VG = 0. 
When VD is increased to a critical value, the depletion region again touches the semiinsulating substrate. The value 
of this VD is given by

For an n-channel MESFET, the gate voltage is negative with respect to the source, so we use the absolute value of 
VG in Eq. 26 and in subsequent equations. We see from Eq. 26 that the application of a gate voltage VG reduces the 
drain voltage required for the onset of pinch-off by an amount equal to VG.
7.2.3 Current-Voltage Characteristics
We now consider a MESFET before the onset of pinch-off, as shown in Fig. 12a. The drain voltage variation 
along the channel is shown in Fig. 12b. The voltage drop across an elemental section dy of the channel is given by

The voltage VP is called the pinch-off voltage, that is, the total voltage (VD + VG + Vbi) at which W2= a.
In Fig. 13 we show the I-V characteristics of a MESFET having a pinch-off voltage of 3.2 V. The curves 
shown are calculated for 0 ≤ VD ≤ VDsat using Eq. 31. Beyond VDsat the current is taken to be constant in accordance 
with our previous discussion. Note that there are three different regions in the current-voltage characteristics. 
When VD is small, the cross-section area of the channel is essentially independent of VD and the I-V characteristics 
are ohmic or linear. We refer to this region of operation as the linear region. For VD ≥ VDsat, the current saturates 
at IDsat. We refer to this region of operation as the saturation region. As the drain voltage is further increased, 
avalanche breakdown of the gate-to-channel diode occurs and the drain current suddenly increases. This is the 
breakdown region.

In the breakdown region, the breakdown voltage occurs at the drain end of the channel, where the reverse 
voltage is the highest:
 
VB (breakdown voltage) = VD + |VG| 
(37)
For example, in Fig. 13 the breakdown voltage is 12 V for VG = 0. At |VG | = 1, the breakdown voltage is still 12 V 
and the drain voltage at breakdown is (VB – |VG|) or 11 V.

 V.
The built-in potential is 
 
Vbi = fBn - Vn = 0.89 - 0.14 = 0.75 V. 
So far we have considered only a normally on (or depletion-mode) device; that is, the device has a conductive 
channel at VG = 0. For high-speed, low-power applications, the normally off device is preferred. This device does 
not have a conductive channel at VG = 0; that is, the built-in potential Vbi of the gate contact is sufficient to deplete 
the channel region. This is possible, for example, in a gallium arsenide MESFET with a very thin epitaxial layer on 
a semiinsulating substrate. For a normally off MESFET, a positive bias must be applied to the gate before channel 
current begins to flow. The required voltage, called the threshold voltage VT, is given by 
VT = Vbi – VP 
(38a)
or
Vbi = VT + VP, 
(38b)
where VP is the pinch-off voltage defined in Eq. 31b. Near the threshold voltage, the drain current in the saturation 
region can be obtained by substituting Vbi of Eq. 38b in Eq. 34 and by using the Taylor series expansion assuming 
(VG – VT)/Vp   1. We obtain

In deriving Eq. 39 we used a negative sign for VG to take into account its polarity.
The basic current-voltage characteristics of normally on and normally off devices are similar. Figure 14 
compares these two modes of operation. The main difference is the shift of threshold voltage along the VG axis. 
The normally off device (Fig. 14b) has no current conduction at VG = 0, and the current varies as in Eq. 39 when 
VG > VT. Since the built-in potential of the gate is less than about 1 V, the forward bias on the gate is limited to 
about 0.5 V to avoid excessive gate current.

7.2.4 High-Frequency Performance 
For high-frequency applications of MESFETs, an important figure of merit is the cutoff frequency ƒT , which is 
the frequency at which the MESFET can no longer amplify the input signal. The small-signal input current is the 
product of the gate admittance and the small-signal gate voltage, assuming that the device has negligibly small 
series resistance:

where we used Eq. 36 for gm. From Eq. 43 we see that to improve high-frequency performance, we should use a 
MESFET having high carrier mobility and short channel length. This is the reason that the n-channel MESFET, 
which has higher electron mobility, is preferred.
These derivations are based on the assumption that the carrier mobility in the channel is a constant 
independent of the applied field. However, for very-high-frequency operations, the longitudinal field, i.e., the 
electric field directed from the source to the drain, is sufficiently high that the carriers travel at their saturation 
velocity.

Therefore, to increase ƒT, we must reduce the gate length L and employ a semiconductor with a high saturation 
velocity. Figure 15 shows the electron drift velocity versus electric field for five semiconductors.8 Note that GaAs 
has an average velocity§ of 1.2 × 107 cm/s and a peak velocity of 2 × 107 cm/s, which are 20%–100% higher than the 
saturation velocity of silicon. Also note that Ga0.47In0.53As and InP have higher average and peak velocities than 
GaAs. Consequently, the cutoff frequencies of these semiconductors will be higher than that from GaAs.

7.3 MODFET
7.3.1 MODFET Fundamentals 
The modulation-doped field-effect transistor (MODFET) is a heterostructure field-effect device. The MODFET 
has been an alternative to MESFETs in high-speed circuits. Other names commonly applied to the device include 
high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), two-dimensional electron gas field-effect transistor (TEGFET), 
and selectively doped heterostructure transistor (SDHT). Frequently, it is referred to by a general name of 
heterojunction field-effect transistor (HFET).
The most-common heterojunctions for the MODFETs are the AlGaAs/GaAs, AlGaAs/InGaAs, and InAlAs/
InGaAs heterointerfaces. Figure 16 shows a perspective view of a conventional AlGaAs/GaAs MODFET. The 
special features of a MODFET are its heterojunction structure under the gate and its modulation doped layers. 
For the device in Fig. 16, AlGaAs is the wide bandgap semiconductor, whereas GaAs is the narrow bandgap 
semiconductor. The two semiconductors are modulation doped, i.e., the AlGaAs is doped (~1018 cm-3), except for 
a narrow region do, which is undoped, whereas the GaAs is undoped. Electrons in the AlGaAs will diffuse to the 
undoped GaAs, where a conduction channel can be formed  at  the  surface  of  the  GaAs.  The  net  result  of  
this  modulation  doping  is  that channel carriers have high mobilities because there is no impurity scattering. The 
undoped AlGaAs spacer layer is used to reduce the Coulomb scattering from ionized donors in doped AlGaAs 
and leads to enhanced carrier mobility in the channel.
A comparison of low-field electron mobility of the modulation-doped 2-D channel to bulk GaAs at 
different doping levels is shown in Fig. 17. In a MESFET the channel has to be doped to a reasonably high level 
(> 1017 cm-3), and thus the electron suffers from impurity scattering. However, the modulation-doped channel 
has much higher mobilities at all temperatures. It is also interesting to compare the modulation-doped channel, 
which usually has an unintentional doping below 1014 cm-3, to lowly doped bulk samples (with a similar impurity 
concentration of 4 × 1013 cm-3). The bulk mobility as a function of temperature shows a peak but drops at both

doping levels.9
high temperature and low temperature. The decrease of bulk mobility with an increase of temperature is due to 
phonon scattering. At low temperatures, the bulk mobility is limited by impurity scattering. It depends on the 
doping level and also decreases with a decrease in temperature. In the modulation-doped channel, its mobility at 
temperatures above ~ 80 K is comparable to the value of a lowly doped bulk sample. However, mobility is much 
enhanced at lower temperatures. The modulation-doped channel does not suffer from impurity scattering,

which dominates at low temperatures. This benefit stems from the screening effect of a two-dimensional electron 
gas (2 DEG), where its conduction path is confined to a small cross-section, smaller than 10 nm, with high volume 
density. 
Figure 18a shows the band diagram of a MODFET in a thermal equilibrium condition. Similar to a 
standard Schottky barrier, qϕBn is the barrier height of the metal on the wide-bandgap semiconductor.10 ΔEC is the 
conduction band discontinuity for the heterojunction structure, and VP is the built-in potential given by

where d1 is the thickness of the doped region in AlGaAs and εs is the dielectric permittivity.
A key parameter for the operation of a MODFET is the threshold voltage VT , which is the gate bias at 
which the channel starts to form between the source and drain. With reference to Fig. 18b, VT corresponds to the 
situation where the bottom of the conduction band at the GaAs surface coincides with the Fermi level:

The threshold voltage VT can be adjusted by using different values for ϕBn and Vp. However, ΔEC is fixed for a given 
set of semiconductors. Figure 18b has a positive VT, and the MODFET is an enhancement-mode device (normally 
off), as opposed to a depletion-mode device with a negative VT (normally on).
When the gate voltage is larger than VT, a charge sheet ns(y) is capacitively induced by the gate at the 
heterojunction interface. The charge sheet is similar to the charge Qn /q in the inversion layer of a MOSFET (see 
Section 5.1):

d1 and d0 are the doped and undoped AlGaAs thickness (Fig. 16) and Δd is the channel thickness or the thickness 
of the inversion layer, estimated to be about 8 nm. V(y) is the channel potential with respect to the source. The 
channel potential varies along the channel from 0 to the drain bias VD, similar to that shown in Fig. 12b. The 
charge sheet is also called a two-dimensional electron gas. This is because that the electrons in the inversion layer 
are confined in the x-direction by ΔEC on the left side and by the potential distribution of the conduction band on 
the right side (Fig. 18b). However, these electrons can make two-dimensional movements: in the y-direction from 
the source to the drain and in the z-direction parallel to the channel width (Fig. 16).
Equation 49 shows that a negative gate bias will reduce the two-dimensional electron gas. If, on the other 
hand, a positive VG is applied, ns will increase.
 EXAMPLE 5 
Consider an AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction with n-AlGaAs doped to 2 ×1018 cm–3 and a thickness of 40 nm.

where Cp is the parasitic capacitance. To improve ƒT, we should consider a semiconductor with a large 's , a gate 
structure with an ultrashort gate length, and a device configuration with minimum parasitic capacitance. 
A comparison of the cutoff frequencies of various FETs is shown in Fig. 19. The cutoff frequency ƒT is 
plotted against the channel or gate length.8,11 Note that for a given length, a silicon n-type MOSFET has the lowest 
ƒT because of the relatively low mobility and a low average velocity of electron in silicon. GaAs MESFET has an 
ƒT about three times higher than does a silicon MOSFET.
Also shown are three MODFETs. The conventional GaAs MODFET (i.e., AlGaAs-GaAs structure) has 
an ƒT  about 30% higher than that of the GaAs MESFET. The pseudomorphic SiGe MODFET (i.e., Si-SiGe 
structure where the SiGe lattice is shrunk slightly to match the silicon lattice) has an ƒT  comparable to the GaAs 
MODFET. SiGe MODFETs  are  attractive  because  they  can  be  processed  in  a  silicon fabrication facility. For 
even higher cutoff frequencies, we have the Al0.48In0.52As-Ga0.47In0.53As MODFET formed on an InP substrate. The 
superior performance is mainly due to the high electron mobility in Ga0.47In0.53As and its high average and peak 
velocities. It is estimated that at a gate length of 50 nm ƒT  can be as high as 600 GHz.

SUMMARY
When a metal makes intimate contact with a semiconductor, it forms a metal-semiconductor contact. There are 
two types of contacts. The first type is the rectifying contact, also called the Schottky barrier contact, which has a 
relatively large barrier height and is formed on a semiconductor with a relatively low doping concentration. The 
potential and field distribution in a Schottky barrier are identical to those of a one-sided abrupt p–n junction. 
However, the current transport in a Schottky barrier is by thermionic emission and, therefore, has an inherent fast 
response.
The second type is the ohmic contact, which is formed on a degenerate semiconductor in which carrier 
transport is by the tunneling process. An ohmic contact can pass the required current with a very small voltage 
drop across it. All semiconductor devices and integrated circuits need ohmic contacts to make connections to 
other devices in an electronic system.
Metal-semiconductor contacts are building blocks for MESFET and MODFET devices. By employing 
a Schottky barrier as the gate electrode and two ohmic contacts as the source and drain electrodes, we form a 
MESFET. This three-terminal device is important for high-frequency applications, especially for monolithic 
microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). Most MESFETs are made with n-type III-V compound semiconductors 
because of their high electron mobilities and high average drift velocities. Of particular importance is GaAs, 
because of its relatively mature technology and the availability of high-quality GaAs wafers.
The MODFET is a device with enhanced high-frequency performance. This device structure is similar to that 
of a MESFET except there is a heterojunction under the gate. A two-dimensional electron gas, i.e., a conductive 
channel, is formed at the heterojunction interface, and electrons with high mobility and high average drift velocity 
can be transported from the source through the channel to the drain.
The output characteristics of all field-effect transistors (FETs) are similar. They all have a linear region at 
low-drain biases. As the bias increases, the output current eventually saturates, and at a sufficiently high voltage, 
avalanche breakdown occurs at the drain. Depending on whether it requires a positive- or negative-threshold 
voltage, FET can be either normally off (enhancement mode) or normally on (depletion mode).
The cutoff frequency ƒT is a figure of merit for the high-frequency performance of an FET. For a given 
length, the silicon MOSFET (n-type) has the lowest ƒT and the GaAs MESFET has an ƒT  about three times higher 
than that of silicon. The conventional GaAs MODFET and the pseudomorphic SiGe MODFET have ƒT  about 
30% higher than that of the GaAs MESFET. For even higher cutoff frequencies, we have the GaInAs MODFET, 
which has a projected ƒT of 600 GHz at a gate length of 50 nm.

SUMMARY
Many semiconductor devices discussed in the previous chapters can be operated in the microwave region (0.1 ~ 
3000 GHz). However, two-terminal devices generate the highest power levels per device area in system applications, 
especially at higher frequencies. Additionally, pulsed operation of these devices overcomes thermal limits and 
increases peak rf (radio frequency) power levels by more than an order of magnitude.1 In this chapter, we consider 
some special two-terminal microwave devices including the tunnel diode, the impact ionization avalanche transit-
time (IMPATT) diode, the transferred-electron device, and the resonant tunneling diode.
In the past two decades, we have witnessed considerable research and effort in the development of device 
structures that could exploit quantum-effect and hot-electron phenomena to enhance circuit performances. Speed 
is often cited as a primary benefit that quantum-effect devices (QEDs) and hot-electron devices (HEDs) can 
offer. The tunneling process, on which most QEDs rely, is an intrinsically fast process. In HEDs, carriers under 
ballistic transport can move at velocities considerably in excess of their equilibrium thermal velocity. However, a 
more significant advantage of QEDs and HEDs is their greater functionality. These devices can perform relatively 
complex circuit functions with a greatly reduced device count, replacing large numbers of transistors or passive 
circuit components.1 The basic device structures and operating principles of QEDs and HEDs are discussed in this 
chapter.
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
Advantages of millimeter-wave devices over those operated at lower frequencies.
r
 The quantum tunneling phenomenon and its related devices—tunnel diode, resonant tunneling 
diode (RTD), and unipolar resonant tunneling transistor.
r
The IMPATT diode—the most powerful semiconductor source of millimeter-wave power.
r
The transferred-electron device and its transit-time domain mode.
r
The real-space–transfer transistor and its advantages as a functional device.

 
8.1 MICROWAVE FREQUENCY BANDS
The microwave frequencies cover the range from about 0.1 GHz (108 Hz) to 3000 GHz with corresponding 
wavelengths from 300 cm to 0.01 cm. For frequencies from 30 to 300 GHz, we have the millimeter-wave band 
because the wavelength is between 10 and 1 mm. For even higher frequencies, we have the submillimeter-wave 
band. The microwave frequency range is usually grouped into different bands.2 The bands and corresponding 
frequency ranges as designated by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) are listed in 
Table 1. It is recommended that both the band and the corresponding frequency range be used when referring to 
microwave devices.
The development of microwave technology was driven by the demands of short-wave-length radio (and 
later radar) systems. The history of microwaves started with the first experiments of Heinrich Hertz around 
1887. Hertz used a spark transmitter that produced signals in a very broad frequency band and he selected from 
these a frequency around 420 MHz with a half-wavelength antenna for his experiments. The rapid development 
of wireless communication products has led to an explosion in microwave technology. Since the introduction 
of cellular telephone service in the 1980s, there has been rapid growth of these systems as well as mobile 
paging devices and a variety of wireless data-communication services under the broad heading of personal 
communication services (PCS). In addition to these terrestrial communication systems, the field of satellite-based 
video, telephone, and data communication systems has also grown rapidly. These systems use the microwave 
frequencies from several hundred MHz to well over 60 GHz—the millimeter-wave region.3
Millimeter-wave technology offers many advantages for communications and radar systems, such as radio 
astronomy, clear-air turbulence detection, nuclear spectroscopy, air-traffic–control beacons, and weather radar. 
The advantages of millimeter waves over lower microwave and infrared systems include light weight, small size, 
broad bandwidths (several GHz), operation in adverse weather conditions, and narrow beamwidths with high 
resolution.  The principal frequencies of interest in the millimeter-wave band are centered around 35, 60, 94, 
140, and 220 GHz.4 The reason for choosing these specific frequencies is mainly the atmospheric absorption of 
horizontally propagated millimeter waves. The atmospheric “windows” where absorption is at a local minimum 
are found at about 35, 94, 140, and 220 GHz. The absorption peak due to O2 at 60 GHz can be used for secure 
communication systems.

8.2 TUNNEL DIODE
The tunnel diode is associated with the quantum tunneling phenomena.5 The tunneling time across the device is 
very short, permitting its use well into the millimeter-wave region. Because of its mature technology, the tunnel 
diode is used in special low-power microwave applications, such as local oscillators and frequency-locking circuits.
A tunnel diode consists of a simple p–n junction in which both the p- and n-sides are degenerate (i.e., very 
heavily doped with impurities). Figure 1 shows a typical static current-voltage characteristic of a tunnel diode 
under four different bias conditions. The I-V characteristic is the result of two current components: tunneling 
current and thermal current.
When no voltage is applied to the diode, it is in thermal equilibrium (V = 0). Because of the high dopings, the 
depletion region is very narrow and the tunneling distance d is quite small (5–10 nm). The dopings also cause the 
Fermi levels to be located within the allowed bands. The amount of degeneracy, qVp and qVn, shown at the far left 
of Fig. 1, is typically 50–200 meV.
When a forward bias is applied, there exists a band of energy states that is occupied on the n side and a 
corresponding band of energy states that is available and unoccupied on the p side. The electrons can tunnel from 
the n-side to the p-side. When the applied bias equals approximately (Vp + Vn)/3, the tunneling current  reaches  its  
peak value IP and the  corresponding  voltage  is  called the peak voltage VP. When the forward voltage is further 
increased, there are fewer available unoccupied states on the p-side (VP < V < VV, where VV is the valley voltage) 
and the current decreases. Eventually, the band is “uncrossed,” and at this point the tunneling current can no 
longer flow. With still further voltage increase, the normal thermal current will flow (for V > VV).
From this discussion we expect that in the forward direction the tunneling current increases from zero to a 
peak current IP as the voltage increases. With a further increase in voltage, the current then decreases to zero when 
V = Vn + Vp, where V is the applied forward voltage. The decreasing portion after the peak current in Fig. 1 is 
the negative differential resistance region. The values of the peak current IP and the valley current IV determine 
the magnitude of the negative resistance. For this reason their ratio IP/IV is used as a figure of merit for the tunnel 
diode.

Figure 2 shows a comparison of the typical current-voltage characteristics of Ge, GaSb, and GaAs tunnel 
diodes at room temperature. The current ratios of IP/IV are 8:1 for Ge and 12:1 for GaSb and GaAs. Because of 
its smaller effective mass (0.042 m0) and small bandgap (0.72 eV), the GaSb tunnel diode has the largest negative 
resistance of the three devices.
 
8.3 IMPATT DIODE
The name IMPATT stands for impact ionization avalanche transit-time. IMPATT diodes employ impact 
ionization and transit-time properties of semiconductor devices to produce a negative resistance at microwave 
frequencies. The IMPATT diode is one of the most powerful solid-state sources of microwave power. At present, 
the IMPATT diode can generate the highest continuous wave (cw) power output of all solid-state devices at 
millimeter-wave frequencies—above 30 GHz. It is extensively used in radar systems and alarm systems. There 
is one noteworthy difficulty in IMPATT applications: the noise is high because of random fluctuations of the 
avalanche multiplication processes.

respectively. IV and VV are the valley current and valley voltage, respectively. The upper figures show the band diagrams 
of the device at different bias voltages.

8.3.1 Static Characteristics
The IMPATT diode family includes many different p–n junction and metal-semiconductor devices. The first 
IMPATT oscillation was obtained from a simple silicon p–n junction diode biased into reverse avalanche 
breakdown and mounted in a microwave cavity.6 Figure 3a shows the doping profile and electric-field distribution 
at avalanche breakdown of a one-sided abrupt p–n junction. Because of the strong dependence of the ionization 
rate on the electric field, most of the avalanche multiplication processes occurs in a narrow region near the highest 
electric field between 0 and xA (shaded area). xA is the width of the avalanche region, the distance over which 95% 
of the contribution to the ionization integrand is obtained.
Microwave Diodes; Quantum-Effect and Hot-Electron Devices 261

Fig. 3 Doping profiles and electric-field distributions at avalanche breakdown of three single-drift IMPATT diodes: (a) 
one-sided abrupt p–n junction; (b) hi-lo structure; and (c) lo-hi-lo structure.
Figure 3b shows the hi-lo structure, in which a high doping N1 region is followed by a lower doping N2 region. 
With proper choices of the doping N1 and its thickness b, the avalanche region can be confined within the N1 
region. Figure 3c is the lo-hi-lo structure in which a “clump” of donor atoms is located at x = b. Since a nearly 
uniform high-field region exists from x = 0 to x = b, the avalanche region xA is equal to b, and the maximum field 
can be much lower than that for a hi-lo structure.
The breakdown voltage VB (including the built-in potential Vbi) is given by the area underneath the electric-
field versus distance plot (Fig. 3). For the one-sided abrupt junction (Fig. 3a), VB is simply EmW /2. For the hi-lo 
diode and the lo-hi-lo diode, the breakdown voltages are, respectively:

where Q in Eq. 4 is the number of impurities/cm2 in the clump. The maximum field at breakdown for a hi-lo diode 
with a given N1 is the same as the value of the one-sided abrupt junction with the same N1. The maximum field 
of a lo-hi-lo structure can be calculated from the ionization coefficient. These structures are single-drift IMPATT 
diodes because only one type of charge carriers, electrons, traverses the drift region. If, on the other hand, we form 
a p+-p-n-n+ structure, we have a double-drift IMPATT diode in which both electrons and holes participate in device 
operation over two separate drift regions, i.e., electrons move to the right side and holes move to the left side from 
the avalanche region. Similar approaches can be used to obtained breakdown voltages for various double-drift 
diodes.
262 Semiconductors

8.3.2 Dynamic Characteristics
We now use the lo-hi-lo structure, shown in Fig. 3c, to discuss the injection delay and transit-time effect of the 
IMPATT diode. When a reverse direct current (dc) voltage VB is applied to the diode so that the critical field for 
avalanche Ec is just reached (Fig. 4a), avalanche multiplication will begin. An alternating current (ac) voltage is 
superimposed onto this dc voltage at t = 0. This voltage is shown in Fig 4e. Holes generated in the avalanche 
region move to the p+
 -region, and electrons enter the drift region. As the applied ac voltage goes positive, more 
electrons are generated in the avalanche region, as shown by the dotted line in Fig 4b. The electron pulse keeps 
increasing as long as the electrical field is above Ec. Therefore, the electron pulse reaches its peak value not at π/2 
when the voltage is maximum, but at π (Fig. 4c). The important consequence is that there is a π/2 phase delay 
inherent in the avalanche process itself, that is, the injected-carrier density (electron pulse) lags the ac voltage by 
90°.
An additional delay is provided by the drift region. Once the applied voltage drops below VB (π ≤ ωt ≤ 2π), the 
injected electrons will drift toward the n+-contact (Fig. 4d) with a saturation velocity, provided the field across the 
drift region is sufficiently high.
The situation described above is illustrated by the injected carriers in Fig. 4f. By comparing Figs. 4e and 4f, 
we note that the peak value of the ac field (or voltage) occurs at π/2, but the peak of the injected carrier density 
occurs at π. The injected carriers then traverse the drift region at the saturation velocity, thereby introducing the 
transit-time delay. The induced external current is also shown in Fig. 4f. Comparing the ac voltage and the external 
current shows that the diode exhibits a negative resistance characteristic.

time (a–d); (e) the ac voltage, and (f) the injected and external current.6

We can also estimate the dc-to-ac power conversion efficiency of the IMPATT diode using Figs. 4e and 4f. 
The dc power input is the product of the average dc voltage and the average dc current, that is, VB (I0/2). The ac 
power output can be estimated by assuming that the maximum ac voltage swing to be 1/2 VB, that is, Vac = VB /2, 
and the external current is zero between 0 ≤ ωt ≤ π and is I0 between π ≤ ωt ≤ 2π. Therefore, the microwave power-

State-of-the-art IMPATT diodes have cw power capabilities up to 3 W at 30 GHz with over 22% efficiency, up 
to 1 W at 100 GHz with 10% efficiency, and 50 mW at 250 GHz with 1% efficiency.7 The substantial reduction in 
power and efficiency at higher frequencies is due to difficulties in device fabrication and circuit optimization.
264 Semiconductors

The reduction is also caused by the nonoptimal transit-time delays introduced by the finite time required to 
transfer energy to the carriers and the tunneling process for the very narrow depletion-layer width.
 
8.4 TRANSFERRED-ELECTRON DEVICES
The transferred-electron effect was first observed in 1963. In the first experiment,8 a microwave output was 
generated when a dc electric field that exceeded a critical threshold value of several thousand volts per centimeter 
was applied across a short n-type sample of GaAs or InP. The transferred-electron device (TED) is an important 
microwave device. It is used extensively as a local oscillator and power amplifier covering the microwave frequency 
range from 1 to 150 GHz. The power output and efficiency of TEDs are generally lower than that of IMPATT 
diodes. However, TEDs have lower noise, lower operating voltages, and relatively easier circuit designs. The TEDs 
have matured to become important solid-state microwave sources used in detection systems, remote controls, and 
microwave test instruments.
8.4.1 Negative Differential Resistance
In Chapter 2 we considered the transferred-electron effect, that is, the transfer of conduction electrons from a high-
mobility energy valley to low-mobility higher-energy satellite valleys. N-type gallium arsenide and n-type indium 
phosphide are the most widely studied and used. Their measured room-temperature velocity field characteristics 
are shown in Fig. 15 of Chapter 7. Basically, the room-temperature velocity-field characteristics have a region of 
negative differential resistance (NDR),9 as shown in Fig. 5a. Also shown are the threshold field ET  corresponding 
to the onset of the NDR. The threshold field ET is 3.2 kV/cm for gallium arsenide and 10.5 kV/cm for indium 
phosphide. The peak velocity υp is about 2.2 × 107 cm/s for gallium arsenide and 2.5 × 107 cm/s for indium 
phosphide. The maximum negative differential mobility (i.e., dυ/dE) is about –2400 cm2/V-s for gallium arsenide 
and –2000 cm2/V-s for indium phosphide.    
For the transferred-electron mechanism to give rise to the NDR, certain requirements must be met. (a) The 
lattice temperature must be low enough that in the absence of an electric field most of the electrons are in the 
lower valley (the conduction band minimum); that is, the energy separation between the two valleys ΔE > kT. (b) 
In the lower valley the electrons must have high mobility and small effective mass, whereas in the upper satellite 
valleys the electrons must have low mobility and large effective mass. (c) The energy separation between the two 
valleys must be smaller than the semiconductor bandgap (i.e., ΔE < Eg) so that avalanche breakdown does not 
begin before the transfer of electrons into the upper valleys.
When a TED is biased in the region of negative resistance with E0 as shown in Fig. 5a, a momentary space 
charge and the electrical field distribution become internally unstable. (This is a unique feature of the TED since 
other negative-resistance devices are stable internally.) The instability in a TED starts with a dipole (also called a 
domain) which consists of excess electrons (negative charge) and depleted electrons (positive charge),9 as shown 
in Fig. 5b. The dipole may arise from any possibility, such as doping inhomogeneity, material defect, or random 
noise. The dipole is usually formed near the cathode contact, because the largest doping fluctuation and space-
charge perturbation exists there. The dipole sets up a higher field for the electrons at that location. This higher 
field, according to Fig. 5a, slows these electrons down relative to the electrons outside the dipole. As a result, the 
region of excess electrons will grow because the trailing electrons behind the dipole are arriving with a higher 
velocity. The region of depleted electrons also grows because electrons ahead of the dipole leave with a higher 
velocity shown in Fig. 5c.  
Also shown in Fig. 5c is that as the dipole grows, the field at that location also increases, but at the expense of 
the field everywhere else outside the dipole. The field inside the dipole is always above E0, and its carrier velocity 
decreases monotonically with field. The field outside the dipole is lower than E0, and its carrier velocity goes 
through the peak value and then decreases monotonically as the field is lowered. When, the field outside the dipole 
decreases to a certain value Es (called sustaining field), the velocities of electrons inside and outside the dipole are 
the same. At this point the dipole ceases to grow and is said to mature to a domain, usually still near the cathode. 
The domain then transits from near the cathode to the anode. The terminal-current waveform is shown

a mature domain. (d) Terminal-current oscillation. Between t1 and t2 , the matured domain is annihilated at the anode 
and another is formed near the cathode.
in Fig. 5d. At t2, a domain is formed. At t1, the domain reaches the anode. Before another domain is formed, 
the field throughout the TED jumps to E0. During the formation of a domain (t2–t1), the field outside the dipole 
passes through the value of ET where the peak velocity occurs. This causes a peak current. The current pulse width 
corresponds to the interval between the annihilation of the domain at the anode and the formation of a new 
domain. The period T corresponding to the transit time of the domain from cathode to anode is L/υ, where L is 
the device length and υ is the average velocity. The corresponding frequency is f = υ/L. The TED can be operated 
in numerous modes. The above operation of TED is the transit-time domain mode, in which a domain has enough 
time to mature and transit to the anode. 
We now treat the domain formation formally. The one-dimensional continuity equation is given by

8.4.2 Device Performances
The TEDs require very pure and uniform materials with a minimum of deep impurity levels and traps. Modern 
TEDs almost always have epitaxial layers on n+-substrates deposited by various epitaxial techniques. Typical donor 
concentrations range from 1014 to 1016 cm–3 and typical device lengths range from a few micrometers to several 
hundred micrometers. A TED having an epitaxial n-layer on n+-substrate and an ohmic n+-contact to the cathode 
electrode is shown in Fig. 6a. Also shown are the energy band diagram at thermal equilibrium and the electric-
field distribution when a voltage V = 3VT is applied to the device where VT is the product of the threshold field ET 
and the device length L. For such an ohmic contact there is always a low-field region near the cathode. There is no 
domain formation there due to finite heating time of the lower-valley electrons. The dead zone may be as large as 1 
μm, which imposes a constraint on the minimum device length and hence the maximum operating frequency. The 
field is nonuniform across the device length because the electrical field in the domain grows with distance as seen in 
Fig. 5b and c. 
To improve device performance, we use the two-zone cathode contact instead of the n+-ohmic contact. The 
two-zone cathode contact consists of a high-field zone and an n+-zone (Fig. 6b). This configuration is similar to 
that of a lo-hi-lo IMPATT diode. Electrons are “heated” in the high-field zone and subsequently injected into the 
active region, which has a uniform field. This structure has been used successfully over a wide temperature range 
with high efficiency and high power output.

is the average  drift velocity of the space-charge layer. For large space-charge growth, this growth factor must be

for GaAs and InP. A strong space-charge instability is dependent on the condition that enough charge is available 
in the semiconductor and the device is long enough that the necessary amount of space charge can be built up 
within the transit time of electrons indicated in Eq. 16.  Below this critical noL level, the field and carriers are 
intrinsically stable. 
Figure 7 shows a simulated time-dependent behavior of a domain in a gallium arsenide TED 100 μm long 
with a doping of 5 × 1014cm–3 (n0L = 5 × 1012 cm–2).10  The time between successive vertical displays of E (x,t) is 
16τR, where τR is the low-field dielectric relaxation time from Eq. 14 (τR = 1.5 ps for this device).
State-of-the-art TED diodes have cw power capabilities up to 0.5 W at 30 GHz with 15% efficiency, up to 0.2 
W at 100 GHz with 7% efficiency, and 70 mW at 150 GHz with 1% efficiency. The power output of TED is lower 
than that of IMPATT; however, TED has much lower noise (e.g., 20 dB less at 135 GHz).7

 EXAMPLE 2
A GaAs TED is 10 μm long and is operated in the transit-time domain mode. Find the minimum electron density 
n0 required and the time between current pulses.
SOLUTION For transit-time domain mode, we require n0 L ≥ 1012 cm–2:
 
n0 ≥ 1012/ L = 1012/ 10 × 10−4 = 1015 cm–3.
The time between current pulses is the time required for the domain to travel from the cathode to the anode:
 
t = L/υ = 10 ´ 10–4 /107 = 10–10 s = 0.1 ns. 
The operation modes of a TED depends on five factors: doping concentration and doping uniformity in the 
device, length of the active region, cathode contact characteristics, type of circuit, and operating bias voltage.11 For 
example, if no internal domain has built up, the TED is operated in uniform-field mode. It has a uniform electrical 
field and acts as a regular NDR device. The operating frequency is not restricted to the domain transit time. 
If the domain can be quenched before it reaches the anode, the TED is operated in quenched mode. In this 
mode, domain quenching occurs when the bias voltage is reduced sufficiently below the threshold during an ac 
cycle. When the bias voltage swings back above the threshold, a new dipole layer is nucleated and the process 
repeated. The operating frequency can remove the limitation due to the domain transit time. Therefore, the 
oscillation occurs at the frequency of the resonant circuit.
 
8.5 QUANTUM-EFFECT DEVICES
A quantum-effect device (QED) uses quantum mechanical tunneling to provide controlled carrier transport. In 
such a device, the active layer thickness is very small, on the order of 10 nm. These small dimensions give rise to 
a quantum size effect that can alter the band structures and enhance device transport properties. The basic QED 
is the resonant tunneling diode (RTD), discussed in Section 8.5.1. Many novel current-voltage characteristics can 
be obtained by combining a RTD with the conventional devices considered in previous chapters. QEDs are of 
particular importance because they can serve as functional devices, that is, they can performance a given circuit 
function with a greatly reduced number of components.

Fig. 8 Band diagram of a resonant-tunneling diode.
8.5.1 Resonant Tunneling Diode
Figure 8 shows the band diagram of a RTD. It has a semiconductor double-barrier structure containing four 
heterojunctions, a GaAs/AlAs/GaAs/AlAs/GaAs structure, and one quantum well in the conduction band. There 
are three important device parameters for a RTD—the energy barrier height E0, which is the conduction band 
discontinuity, the energy barrier thickness LB, and the quantum well thickness LW.
We now concentrate on the conduction band of a RTD as shown12 in Fig. 9a. If the well thickness LW is 
sufficiently small (on the order of 10 nm or less), a set of discrete energy levels will exist inside the well (such as 
E1, E2, E3, and E4 in Fig. 9a). If the barrier thickness LB is also very small, resonant tunneling will occur. When an 
incident electron has an energy E that exactly equals one of the discrete energy levels inside the well, it will tunnel 
through the double barrier with a unity (100%) transmission coefficient.
The transmission coefficient decreases rapidly as the energy E deviates from the discrete energy levels. For 
example, an electron with an energy 10 meV higher or lower than the level E1 will result in 105 times reduction in 
the transmission coefficients, as depicted in Fig. 9b. The transmission coefficient can be calculated by solving the 
one-dimensional Schrödinger equations in the five regions in Fig. 9a (I, II, III, IV, V). Since the wavefunctions and 
their first derivatives at each potential discontinuity must be continuous, we can obtain the transmission coefficient 
Tt. Appendix J shows the calculation of the transmission coefficient for the RTD.
The energy levels, En, at which the transmission coefficient exhibits its first and second resonant peaks in 
GaAs/AlAs RTD are shown in Fig. 10a as a function of barrier thickness LB with the well thickness LW as a 
parameter.13 It is apparent that En is essentially independent of LB but is dependent on LW. The calculated width of 
the peak ΔEn (i.e., the full width at the half-maximum point of the transmission coefficient where Tt = 0.5) is shown 
in Fig. 10b as function of LB and LW. For a given LW, the width ΔEn decreases exponentially with LB.
The cross section of a RTD is shown13 in Fig. 11. The alternating GaAs/AlAs layers are grown sequentially 
by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on an n+ GaAs substrate (the MBE process is discussed in Chapter 11). The 
barrier thicknesses are 1.7 nm and the well thickness is 4.5 nm. The active regions are defined with ohmic contacts. 
The top contact is used as a mask to isolate the region under the contact by etching mesas.
The measured current-voltage characteristic of this RTD is shown in Fig. 12. Also shown are the band 
diagrams for varies dc biases. Note that the I-V curve is similar to that of a tunnel diode (Fig. 1). At thermal 
equilibrium, V = 0, the energy diagram is similar to that in Fig. 9a (here only the lowest energy level E1 is shown). 
As we increase the applied voltage, the electrons in the occupied energy states near the Fermi level to the left side 
of the first barrier tunnel into the quantum well. The electrons subsequently tunnel through the second barrier 
into the unoccupied states in the right side.  Resonance occurs when the energy of the injected electrons becomes 
approximately equal to the energy level E1, where the transmission probability is maximum. This is illustrated by 
the energy diagram for V = V1 = VP, where the conduction band edge on the left side is lined up with E1.

272 Semiconductors

When the voltage is further increased, that is, at V = V2, the conduction band edge is above E1 and the number 
of electrons that can tunnel decreases, resulting in a small current. The valley current IV is due mainly to the excess 
current components, such as electrons that tunnel via an upper valley in the barrier. At room temperature and 
higher, there are other components due to tunneling current associated with either lattice vibrations or impurity 
atoms. To minimize the valley current, we must improve the quality of the heterojunction interfaces and eliminate 
impurities in the barrier and well regions. For even higher applied voltages, V > VV, we have the thermionic current 
component Ith, due to electrons injected through higher discrete energy levels in the well or thermionically injected 
over the barriers. The current Ith increases monotonically with increasing voltage similar to that of a tunnel diode. 
To reduce Ith, we should increase the barrier height and design a diode that operates at relatively low bias voltages.
RTDs can be operated at very high frequencies because of their smaller parasitics. In the RTD the main 
contribution to the capacitance is from the depletion region (refer to the band diagram for V = V2 in Fig. 12). Since 
the doping density there can be much lower than in a degenerate p–n junction, the depletion capacitance is much 
smaller. The cutoff frequency for a RTD can reach the THz (1012 Hz) range. It can be used in ultra-fast pulse-
forming circuits, in THz radiation detection systems, and in oscillators to generate THz signals.
 EXAMPLE 3
Find the ground energy level and the corresponding width of the peak for the RTD in Fig. 11. Compare the peak 
voltage VP in Fig. 12 with 2E1/q.
SOLUTION From Fig. 10 we find that the ground energy level for LW = 4.5 nm is at 140 meV, and the width of  
the peak ΔE1 is about 1 meV. In Fig. 12, VP is 700 mV, which is larger than 280 mV (2E1/q). The difference  
(420 mV) is due to voltage drops at the accumulation and the depletion regions. 
8.5.2 Unipolar Resonant Tunneling Transistor
A schematic band diagram of a unipolar resonant tunneling transistor14 is shown in Fig. 13. The structure consists 
of a resonant tunneling (RT) double barrier placed between the GaAs emitter and base layers. The RT structure 
was made of a GaAs quantum well (5.6 nm thick) sandwiched between two Al0.33Ga0.67As barriers (5 nm thick). 
High-energy electrons can be injected from the emitter through the RT into the base region. The electrons are 
then transported through the n+-base region 100 nm thick before being collected at the 300 nm thick Al0.2Ga0.8As 
collector barrier. The barriers and the quantum well are undoped, whereas the emitter, base, and collector layers 
are all n-type and doped to 1 × 1018 cm–3.
The operation of the device in the common-emitter configuration with a fixed collector-emitter voltage 
VCE is shown in the band diagrams of Fig. 13. When the base-emitter voltage VBE is zero (Fig. 13a), there is no 
electron injection; hence, the emitter and collector currents are zero even with a positive VCE. A peak in the emitter 
and collector currents occurs when VBE is equal to 2E1/q, where E1 is the energy of the first resonant level in the 
quantum well (Fig. 13b). With a further increase in VBE, RT is quenched (Fig. 13c) with a corresponding drop 
in the collector current. The current-voltage characteristic is shown in Fig. 13d. Note that a current peak occurs 
around VBE = 0.4 V. If we connect two inputs A and B to the base terminal (Fig. 13e), the device can perform 
an exclusive NOR logic function;§ that is, the output voltage will be high if A and B are both high or both low, 
otherwise the output voltage will be low. To perform the same function, we need eight conventional MESFETs. 
Therefore, many quantum-effect devices are useful as functional devices. 
§Exclusive NOR logic function: when the two inputs are both high or both low, the output is high.  
Otherwise, the output is low.

8.6 HOT-ELECTRON DEVICES
Hot electrons are electrons with kinetic energies substantially above kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T 
is the lattice temperature. As the dimensions of semiconductor devices shrink and the internal fields rise, a large 
fraction of carriers in the active regions of the device during its operation are in a state of high kinetic energy.  At 
a given point in time and space the velocity distribution of carriers may be narrowly peaked, in which case one 
speaks about “ballistic” electron packets. At other times and locations, the electron ensemble can have a broad 
velocity distribution, similar to a conventional Maxwellian distribution but with an effective electron temperature 
Te larger than the lattice temperature T.
Over the years, many hot electron devices have been studied. We now consider two important devices—the 
hot-electron heterojunction bipolar transistor and the real–space–transfer transistor. 
8.6.1 Hot-Electron HBT
Hot-electron injection is made possible in heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) by designing structures 
with a wider-bandgap emitter,15 for example, an AlInAs/GaInAs HBT lattice matched to InP. There are several 
advantages of the hot-electron effect. Electrons are injected by thermionic emission over the emitter-base barrier at 
an energy ΔEC = 0.5 eV  above the conduction band edge in the  p-GaInAs base. Here the purpose of the ballistic 
injection is to shorten the base traversal time by replacing the relatively slow diffusion motion by faster ballistic 
propagation.
274 Semiconductors

transfer into the wide-gap layers. (c) If the mobility in layer 2 is lower, the transfer results in a negative differential 
conductivity.16
8.6.2 Real-Space–Transfer Transistor
The original real-space transfer (RST) structure, illustrated in Fig. 14a, is a heterostructure with alternate doped 
wide-gap AlGaAs and undoped narrow-gap GaAs layers. In thermal equilibrium the mobile electrons reside in 
the undoped GaAs quantum wells and are spatially separated from their parent donors in the AlGaAs layers.16 
If the power input into the structure exceeds the rate of energy loss by the system to the lattice, then the carriers 
“heat up” and undergo partial transfer into the wide-gap layer, where they may have a different mobility (Fig. 
14b). If the mobility in layer 2 is much lower, negative differential resistance will occur in the two-terminal circuit 
(Fig. 14c). There is a strong analogy to the transferred-electron effect, based on the momentum-space intervalley 
transfer, whence the name real-space transfer. Two-terminal RST oscillators do not appear to offer any significant 
advantages over Gunn oscillators because a large mobility ratio between layer 1 and 2 in  the RST  structure  
is  more  difficult  to  realize  than  in  homogeneous  multiple-valley semiconductors. But the  possibility  of  
extracting  the  transferred hot-carrier via a third terminal in an RST transistor makes the RST structure more 
interesting.
Figure 15 shows a schematic cross-section and the corresponding band diagram of a three-terminal RST 
transistor (RSTT) implemented in a GaInAs/AlInAs material system.17,18 The source and drain contacts are to an 
undoped high-mobility Ga0.47In0.53As (Eg = 0.75 eV  with  μn = 13800 cm2/V-s)  channel, and the collector contact is 
to a doped Ga0.47In0.53As conducting layer. This layer is separated from the channel by a larger-bandgap material. 
(i.e., an Al0.48In0.52As with Eg = 1.45 eV). At VD = 0 an electron density is induced in the source-drain channel by a 
sufficiently positive collector bias VC with respect to the grounded source, but no collector current IC flows because 
of the AlInAs barrier. As VD increases, however, a drain current ID begins to flow and the channel electrons heat
Microwave Diodes; Quantum-Effect and Hot-Electron Devices 275

up to some effective temperature Te (VD). This electron temperature determines the RST current injected over the 
AlInAs collector barrier. The injected electrons are swept into the collector by the VC –induced electric field, giving 
rise to IC. Transistor action results from control of the electron temperature Te in the source-drain channel, which 
modulates the IC flowing into the collector electrode.
The drain current ID and the collector current IC versus drain voltage VD at a fixed VC = 3.9 V are shown19 
in Fig. 16. In contrast to the two-terminal device, the RST current is removed from the drain current and leads 
to very strong NDR in the ID-VD curve. On the ID-VD characteristics, the RSTT shows pronounced negative 
differential resistance, with a peak-to-valley ratio that reaches 7000 at 300 K. In the IC-VD characteristics, the 
collector current increases approximately linearly and eventually reaches a saturation value similar to a field-effect 
transistor.

The RSTT can be used as a conventional high-speed transistor with high transconductance, gm ≡ ∂IC/∂VD (at 
a fixed VC), and a high cutoff frequency ƒT. In addition, the RSTT is another useful functional device for logic 
circuits.  This is because the source and drain contacts of an RSTT are symmetrical. A single device, such as that 
shown in Fig. 16, can perform an exclusive OR (XOR) logic function* because the collector current IC flows if the 
source and drain are at different logic values, regardless of which is “high.” 
 
SUMMARY
Diodes associated with the tunneling phenomenon (such as the tunnel diode), the avalanche breakdown (IMPATT 
diode), and momentum-space transfer of electrons (TED) are devices that are used at microwave frequencies. 
Those two-terminal devices have relatively simple construction and much less parasitic resistance and capacitance 
than do their three-terminal counterparts. These microwave diodes can operate in the millimeter-wave band (30–
300 GHz) and some devices can operate in the submillimeter-wave band (> 300 GHz). Among microwave devices, 
the IMPATT diode is the most extensively used semiconductor device for millimeter-wave power applications. 
However, the TED is often used in local oscillators and amplifiers because it has lower noise and can be operated 
at lower voltages than the IMPATT diode.
We also considered the quantum-effect and hot-electron devices. Quantum effects become important when 
the device dimensions are reduced to about 10 nm. A key quantum-effect device is the resonant tunneling diode 
(RTD), which is a heterostructure having a double barrier and a quantum well. If the incoming carrier energy 
is equal to a discrete energy level in the quantum well, the tunneling probability through the double barrier 
becomes 100%. This effect is called resonant tunneling. Microwave detectors that operate up to the THz (1012 
Hz) range have been made using a RTD. By combining RTD with conventional devices we can obtain many 
novel characteristics. One example is the unipolar resonant tunneling transistor, which can perform a given logic 
function with a greatly reduced number of components.
HEDs can be classified into two groups—ballistic devices and the RST devices, depending on the type of a 
hot-electron ensemble employed in the operation. Ballistic devices, such as the hot-electron heterojunction bipolar 
transistor, have the potential for ultrahigh-speed operation. In ballistic devices, high–kinetic-energy electrons are 
injected over the emitter-base barrier by thermionic emission. This “ballistic propagation” greatly reduces the 
transit time through the base. In RST devices, electrons in a narrow-gap semiconductor can gain energy from 
the input power and undergo transfer into a wide-gap semiconductor, giving rise to a NDR characteristic. These 
devices such as the RSTT have high transconductance and a high cutoff frequency. RSTTs are also used in logic 
circuits, where they permit a lower component count for a given function than do other devices.

SUMMARY
Photonic devices are devices in which the basic particle of light—the photon—plays a major role. We consider four 
groups of photonic devices: light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers (light amplification by stimulated emission 
of radiation), which convert electrical energy to optical energy; photodetectors, which electrically detect optical 
signals; and solar cells, which convert optical energy into electrical energy. In this chapter, we focus on LEDs and 
semiconductor lasers. Photodetectors and solar cells will be discussed in the next chapter.
 
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
Basic interactions between a photon and an electron.
r
Generation of photons by spontaneous emission for conventional and organic LEDs.
r
Generation of photons by stimulated emission for heterostructure lasers.
 
9.1  RADIATIVE TRANSITIONS AND OPTICAL ABSORPTION
Figure 1 shows the electromagnetic spectrum of the optical region. The detectable range of light by the human 
eye extends only from approximately 0.4 m to 0.7 m. Also shown are the major color bands from violet to red 
in the expanded scale. The ultraviolet region includes wavelengths from 0.01 m to 0.4 m, and the infrared region 
extends from 0.7 m to 1,000 m. In this chapter, we are primarily interested in the wavelength range from near-
ultraviolet (~ 0.3 m) to near-infrared (~1.5 m).
Figure 1 also shows the photon energy on a separate horizontal scale. To convert the wavelength to photon 
energy, we use the relationship

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, ν is the frequency of light, h is Planck’s constant, and hν is the energy of a 
photon measured in electron volts. For example, a 0.5 m green light corresponds to a photon energy of 2.48 eV.

9.1.1  Radiative Transitions
There are basically three processes for interaction between a photon and an electron in a solid: absorption, 
spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission. We use a simple system to demonstrate these processes.1 Consider 
two energy levels E1 and E2 of an atom, where E1 corresponds to the ground state and E2 corresponds to the 
excited state (Fig. 2). Any transition between these states involves the emission or absorption of a photon with 
frequency ν12 given by hν12 = E2 – E1. At room temperature, most of the atoms in a solid are at the ground state. 
This situation is disturbed when a photon of energy exactly equal to hν12 impinges on the system. An atom in state 
E1 absorbs the photon and thereby goes to the excited state E2. The change in the energy state is the absorption 
process, shown in Fig. 2a. The excited state of the atom is unstable. After a short time, without any external 
stimulus, it makes a transition to the ground state, giving off a photon of energy hν12. This process is called 
spontaneous emission (Fig. 2b). When a photon of energy hν12 impinges on an atom while it is in the excited state 
(Fig. 2c), the atom can be stimulated to make a transition to the ground state and gives off a photon of energy 
hν12, which is in phase with the incident radiation. This process is called stimulated emission. The radiation from 
stimulated emission is monochromatic because each photon has precisely an energy hν12 and is coherent because 
all photons emitted are in phase.
The dominant operating process for LEDs is spontaneous emission, for the laser diodes (LDs) it is stimulated 
emission, and for the photodetectors and the solar cells it is absorption.
Let us assume that the instantaneous populations of E1 and E2 are n1 and n2, respectively. Under a thermal 
equilibrium condition and for (E2 – E1) > 3kT, the population is given by the Boltzmann distribution:

initial state is at the left; the final state, after the transition, is at the right. (a) Absorption. (b) Spontaneous emission. (c) 
Stimulated emission.
The negative exponent indicates that n2 is less than n1 in thermal equilibrium; that is, most electrons are at the 
lower energy level.
In steady state, the stimulated-emission rate (i.e., the number of stimulated-emission transitions per unit time) 
and the spontaneous-emission rate must be balanced by the rate of absorption to maintain the population n1 and 
n2 constant. The stimulated-emission rate is proportional to the photon-field energy density ρ ν
(
)
h 12 , which is 
the total energy in the radiation field per unit volume per unit frequency. Therefore, the stimulated-emission rate 
can be written as B21n2 ρ ν
(
)
h 12 , where n2 is the number of electrons in the upper level and B21 is a proportionality 
constant. The spontaneous-emission rate is proportional only to the population of the upper level and can be 
written as A21n2, where A21 is a constant. The absorption rate is proportional to the electron population at the lower 
level and to ρ ν
(
)
h 12 ; this rate can be written as B12n1 ρ ν
(
)
h 12 , where B12 is a proportionality constant. Therefore, we 
have at steady state

If the stimulated emission of photon is to dominate over the absorption of photons, we must have higher electron 
density in the upper level than in the lower level. This condition is called population inversion, since under an 
equilibrium condition the reverse is true. In Section 9.3 on semiconductor lasers, we consider various ways to have 
a large photon-field energy density and achieve population inversion, so that the stimulated emission becomes 
dominant over both spontaneous emission and absorption.
9.1.2 Optical Absorption
Figure 3 shows the basic transitions in a semiconductor. When a semiconductor is illuminated, photons are 
absorbed to create electron-hole pairs (EHPs), as shown in Fig. 3a, if the photon energy is equal to the bandgap 
energy, that is, hν equals Eg. If hν is greater than Eg, an electron-hole pair is generated and, in addition, the 
excess energy (hν- Eg) is dissipated as heat, as shown in Fig. 3b. Both processes (Figs. 3a and b) are called intrinsic 
transitions (or band-to-band transitions). On the other hand, for hν less than Eg, a photon will be absorbed only if 
there are available energy states in the forbidden bandgap due to chemical impurities or physical defects, as shown 
in Fig. 3c. That process is called extrinsic transition. This discussion also is generally true for the reverse situation. 
For example, an electron at the conduction band edge combining with a hole at the valence band edge will result in 
the emission of a photon with energy equal to that of the bandgap.

Fig. 4 Optical absorption. (a) Semiconductor under illumination. (b) Exponential decay of photon flux.
Assume that a semiconductor is illuminated from a light source with hν greater than Eg and a photon flux of 
Φ0 in units of photons per square centimeter per second. As the photon flux travels through the semiconductor, 
a fraction of the photons absorbed is proportional to the intensity of the flux. Therefore, the number of photons 
absorbed within an incremental distance x (Fig. 4a) is given by αϕ(x)x, where α is a proportionality constant 
defined as the absorption coefficient. From the continuity of photon flux as shown in Fig. 4a, we obtain

because the optical band-to-band absorption becomes negligible for hυ < Eg, or λ > λc. From Fig. 5, we notice 
that 63%, i.e., (1– e
W
−α ) for W = 1, of the optical flux will be absorbed over a distance W = 1/. 1/ is called the 
penetration depth δ, which is also shown in Fig. 5.
The absorption coefficient rises sharply with decreasing wavelength from λc for direct bandgap materials 
GaAs, CdS, Ga0.30In0.70As0.64P0.36 in Fig. 5, because it requires no assistance from lattice vibrations (phonons). For 
indirect bandgap semiconductors such as Si and Ge, photon absorption requires phonon absorption and emission 
during the absorption process. The absorption coefficient rises slowly with decreasing wavelength from λc. Thus 
the absorption energy for indirect bandgap semiconductors does not exactly coincide with Eg, but typically it is 
very close to Eg: 
 
hν = Eg ± hω 
(10)
where hν is the absorption energy, h ω is the phonon energy.

recombination by intrinsic transitions.

9.2  LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are p-n junctions that can emit spontaneous radiation in ultraviolet, visible, or 
infrared regions. The visible LED has a multitude of applications as an information link between electronic 
instruments and their users. The infrared LED is useful in opto-isolators and for optical-fiber communication.
9.2.1 Structure of LED
The basic structure of an LED is a p-n junction. Under forward bias, electrons are injected from the n-side and 
holes from the p-side as shown in Fig. 6a. The built-in potential of the junction is lowered by an amount equal to 
the applied potential V, and the injected carriers can pass across the junction where they become excess minority 
carriers. In the vicinity of the junction, the excess of carriers is more than the equilibrium value (pn > ni
2), and 
the recombination will take place, as shown in Fig. 6b. However, if a double heterojunction design is utilized, 
the LED efficiency can be much improved. Figure 6c shows the central material, which is bound by layers with 
a higher energy gap. Excess carriers of both types are injected and confined at the same space to produce light. 
The number of excess carriers in the central region can be significantly increased. The radiative recombination 
lifetime is shortened due to higher EHP concentrations, and more efficient radiative recombination is obtained. 
In this configuration, the central layer is usually undoped and bound by layers of opposite types. This double-
heterojunction design yields a much higher efficiency and is the preferred approach. 
Furthermore, if the thickness of the central active layer is reduced to the range of 10 nm or less, a quantum 
well is formed. A quantum well is a potential well that confines carriers, which were originally free to move in 
three dimensions, to two dimensions. Two-dimensional carrier densities become sharper at the band edge, as 
discussed later and in Appendix H. The carrier densities can be pushed to higher levels and can result in higher 
recombination efficiency. Another advantage of a thin active layer is that it can accommodate higher level of 
lattice mismatch in epitaxial growth. Epitaxial growth will be introduced in Chapter 11.
9.2.2 Optical characteristics of the LED  
Band-to-band Recombination
The recombination of electron and hole produces a photon with energy hν nearly equal to the band gap. Because 
the largest electron concentration in the conduction band is at an energy kT/2 above EC, similarly the most 
probable energy for a hole in the valence band has an energy kT/2 below EV. The photon energy is approximately 
 
hν = Eg + kT . 
(11)

p-side. (b) Recombination taking place in the vicinity of the junction. (c) Higher carrier densities confined in a double 
heterojunction.
For practical purposes we can ignore the kT term and 
 
hν = Eg . 
(11a)
Spectral Width
The spectral width is given by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) intensity. The light spectrum of an LED 
shows a peak at the wavelength λm given by Eq. (11). A simple differentiation of Eq. (1) with respect to λ shows 
that there is a spread of wavelengths Δλ associated with a spread of energy ΔE:
 
Δ
≈
Δ
λ
λ

2
hc
E . 
(12)
ΔE is given by kT from Eq. (11). The spectral width on either side of the wavelength peak thus has a dependence 
on λ2 and T.3 The spectral width is given by 2Δλ. The FWHM becomes larger as the wavelength is increased 
from visible to infrared. For example, at λm = 0.55 m (green), FWHM is about 20 nm, but at 1.3 m (infrared), 
FWHM is over 120 nm.
Frequency Response
The electrical input signal is generally modulated at high frequencies. This signal causes direct modulation of 
the injected current in an LED. Parasitic elements such as the depletion-layer capacitance and series resistance 
can cause a delay of carrier injection into the junction and a delay in the light output. The ultimate limit on how 
fast one can vary the light output depends on the carrier lifetime, which is determined by various recombination 
processes, such as the surface recombination discussed in Chapter 2. If the current is modulated at an angular 
frequency ω, the light output P(ω) is given by

τ approaches τr when τr << τnr. τr decreases as the doping in the active layer is increased and f becomes larger. To 
increase speed, an increase of doping concentration in the middle active layer of the heterostructure is desirable. 
The frequency response determines the maximum frequency at which the LED can be turned on and off, and thus 
the maximum transmission rate of data.

9.2.3 Quantum Efficiency
Internal Quantum Efficiency
For a given input power, the radiative recombination processes are in competition with the nonradiative ones. The 
band-to-band transition and transitions via traps can be either radiative or nonradiative. Examples of nonradiative 
band-to-band recombination are those in indirect-bandgap semiconductors. Examples of radiative recombination 
via traps are those via isoelectronic levels, which will be discussed later.
The internal quantum efficiency ηin is the efficiency of converting injected carriers to emitted photons, defined 
as 
 
ηin
number of photons emitted internally
number of carriers passing the junction .  
(16)
This can be related to the fraction of the injected carriers that recombine radiatively to the total recombination 
rate, and may also be written in terms of their lifetimes as

(17)
Here Rr and Rnr are the radiative and nonradiative recombination rates, respectively. It is evident that the radiative 
lifetime τr needs to be small to yield high internal quantum efficiency. For low-level injection, the radiative 
recombination rate in the p-side of the junction is given by 
288 Semiconductors

 
Rr = Recnp ~ Rec ΔnNA,  
(18)
where Rec is the recombination coefficient and Δn is the excess carrier density, which is much larger than the 
minority carrier density in equilibrium, Δn >> npo. Rec is a function of the band structure and temperature. Its 
value is ~ 10-10 cm3/s for direct bandgap materials, and much smaller for indirect bandgap materials (Rec ~ 10-15 
cm3/s).
For low-level injection (Δn < ppo), the radiative lifetime τr is related to the recombination coefficient by

(19)
For high-level injection, however, τr would decrease with increasing Δn due to higher probability of carriers 
recombination. So in double-heterostructure LEDs, carrier confinement increases Δn and τr is reduced to improve 
the internal quantum efficiency as in Eq. (17). 
    The nonradiative lifetime is usually ascribed to traps or recombination centers of density Nt,

where σ is the capture cross section and th  is the average thermal velocity. 
External Quantum Efficiency 
Obviously, for LED applications, what matters is the light emitted external to the device. The parameter to 
measure the efficiency of the light emitted externally is the optical efficiency ηop, sometimes called the extraction 
efficiency. The external quantum efficiency is defined as
 
ηex = number of photons emitted externally
number of carriers passing the junction =η η
in
op. 
(21)
Basically, there are several main loss mechanisms that reduce the optical efficiency. We focus on the device optical 
paths and optical interfaces.
1. Absorption within the LED material: The magnitude of the loss is related to the absorption coefficient for a 
given photon wavelength, as discussed in Section 9.1. Absorption can be minimized by placing the junction 
closer to the emitting surface.
2. Absorption in the substrate: The direct-bandgap GaAsP LED, which emits red light, fabricated on a GaAs 
substrate, is shown in Fig. 7a. The indirect bandgap GaAsP LED with higher bandgap energy, which emits 
orange, yellow, or green light fabricated on a GaP substrate, is shown in Fig. 7b. A graded-alloy GaAs1-
yPy layer is grown epitaxially to minimize the nonradiative centers that result from lattice mismatch at 
the interface. The absorption loss for a GaAsP red LED on a GaAs substrate is large since the substrate 
is opaque to light and it absorbs about 85% of the photons emitted at the junction, as shown in Fig. 7a. 
For orange, yellow, or green GaAsP LEDs on a GaP transparent substrate, photons emitted downward 
can be reflected back with only about 25% absorption by the bottom metal contact. The efficiency can 
be significantly improved, as shown in Fig. 7b. Of course, the absorption in the substrate can be less with 
a thinner substrate. After LED fabrication, the substrate is usually ground to about 100 μm to enhance 
extraction efficiency. However, too thin a substrate will lose mechanical strength.
Light-Emitting Diodes and Lasers 289

3. Fresnel reflection loss: For normal light incidence from semiconductor to air, the direction of the optical 
path is not changed. But it suffers from the Fresnel loss with a reflection coefficient associated with the 
different refractive indices shown as the optical path A in Fig. 7a:

where n1  and n2  are the refractive indices of semiconductor and outside medium (usually air n1 = 1). This 
optical loss can be minimized by an anti-reflection coating on the LED surface.
4. Total internal reflection loss: The incident light at an angle greater than the critical angle θc defined by 
Snell’s law will be totally reflected back to the semiconductor shown as the optical path B in Fig. 7a:

where the light passes from a medium with a refractive index of n2 , such as GaAs with n2  = 3.66 at λ = 0.8 
m, to a medium of n1 , such as air with n1  = 1. For GaAs,the critical angle is about 16o and for GaP with 
n2  = 3.45 at λ = 0.8 m, the critical angle is about 17o. The total internal reflection can be minimized by 
surface roughness.5 
The forward current-voltage characteristics of a LED are similar to those of the GaAs p-n junction discussed 
in Chapter 3. At low forward voltages, the diode current is dominated by the nonradiative recombination current 
due mainly to surface recombination near the perimeter of LED chip. At higher forward voltages, the diode 
current is dominated by the radiative diffusion current. At even higher voltages, the series resistance will limit the 
diode current. The total diode current can be written as

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are p-n junctions that can emit spontaneous radiation in ultraviolet, visible, or 
infrared regions. The visible LED has a multitude of applications as an information link between electronic 
instruments and their users. The white LED has become a key component in backlight source for the liquid-
crystal flat-panel display and street lamps. It has a potential to replace the conventional light sources for solid-state 
lighting applications when the costs of blue, green and red LEDs, especially blue LEDs, become competitive. The 
infrared LED is useful in opto-isolators, optical-fiber communication and health care applications.
9.3.1 Visible LEDs
Figure 8 shows the relative eye response as a function of wavelength (or the corresponding photon energy). The 
maximum sensitivity of the eye is at 555 nm. The eye response falls to nearly zero at the extremes of the visible 
spectrum at about 400 and 700 nm. For normal vision at the peak response of the eye, 1 W of  radiant energy is 
equivalent to 683 lumen.
Since the eye is sensitive only to light with a photon energy hν equal to or greater than 1.8 eV (< 700 nm), 
semiconductors of interest must have an energy bandgap larger than this limit. Figure 8 also shows the bandgaps 
of various semiconductors. Table 1 lists the semiconductors used to produce light in the visible and infrared parts 
of the spectrum. Among all the semiconductors shown, the most important materials for visible LEDs are the 
alloy GaAs1-yPy and GaxIn1-xN III-V compound systems. An alloy III-V compound is formed when more than one 
group III element is distributed randomly on group III lattice sites (e.g., gallium sites) or more than one group V 
element is distributed randomly on group V lattice sites (e.g., arsenic sites). The notation used is AxB1-xC or AC1-
yDy for ternary (three elements) compounds and AxB1-xCyD1-y for quaternary (four elements) compounds, where 
A and B are the group III elements, C and D are the group V elements, and x and y are the mole fractions, that is, 
the ratios of the number of atoms of a given species to the total number of group III or group V atoms in the alloy 
compound.
Figure 9a shows the energy gap for GaAs1-yPy as a function of the mole fraction y. For 0 < y < 0.45, the 
bandgap is direct and increases from Eg = 1.424 eV at y = 0 to Eg = 1.977 eV at y = 0.45. For y > 0.45, the bandgap 
is indirect. Figure 9b shows the corresponding energy-momentum plots for selected alloy compositions.6 As 
indicated, the conduction band has two minima. The one along p = 0 is the direct minimum and the one along 
p = pmax is the indirect minimum. Electrons in the direct minimum of the conduction band and holes at the top 
of the valence band have equal momenta (p = 0). But electrons in the indirect minimum of the conduction band 
and holes at the top of the valence band have different momenta. The radiative transition mechanisms are found 
predominantly in direct-bandgap semiconductors, such as GaAs and GaAs1-yPy (y < 0.45).

However, for GaAs1-yPy with y greater than 0.45 and GaP, which are indirect-bandgap semiconductors, 
the probability of radiative transitions is very small, since lattice interactions or other scattering agents must 
participate in the process to conserve momentum. Therefore, for indirect-bandgap semiconductors, special 
recombination centers are incorporated to enhance the radiative processes. Incorporating nitrogen into the crystal 
lattice can form efficient radiative recombination centers in GaAs1-yPy.
When nitrogen is introduced, it replaces phosphorus atoms in the lattice sites. Nitrogen and phosphorus 
belong to the same group in the period table. The outer electronic structure of nitrogen is similar to that of 
phosphorus, but the electronic core structures of these atoms are different. This difference introduces a trap level 
below the conduction band. The trapped electron subsequently can attract a hole and recombine to give a radiative 
emission with the energy of 50 meV smaller than the band gap. Nitrogen serves as a recombination center but 
cannot contribute extra carriers, and therefore it is called an iso-electronic center. This recombination center can 
greatly enhance the probability of radiative transition in indirect-bandgap semiconductors.
Another interpretation of the N-doped bandgap system can be found using the Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle. One representation of this equation is 
 
ΔpΔx≧ , 
(25)
where p is the momentum and x is the position. Because the position of a localized state due to any nitrogen atom 
is well known (each one could in theory be identified), Δx is small. If so, Δp is large. This means that the wave 
function of the level spreads out in k- space and has a finite value directly above the top of the valence band. An 
electron dropping from the conduction band to the nitrogen level has a finite probability of appearing directly 
above the top of the valence band, as shown in Fig. 10a. Thus the indirect bandgap semiconductor looks like a 
direct bandgap material. Figure 10b shows the quantum efficiency, the number of photons generated per electron-
hole pair, versus alloy composition for GaAs1-yPy with and without the isoelectronic impurity nitrogen.7 The 
efficiency without nitrogen drops sharply in the composition range 0.4 < y < 0.5 because the bandgap changes 
from direct to indirect at y = 0.45. The efficiency with nitrogen is considerably higher for y > 0.5 but nevertheless 
decreases steadily with an increasing y because of the increasing separation between the direct and indirect 
bandgap (Fig. 9b).
For high-brightness blue LEDs (455-492 nm), II-VI compounds such as ZnSe, III-V nitride compounds such 
as GaN, and IV-IV compounds such as SiC have been investigated. However, their short lifetimes prevent II-VI-
based devices from being commercialized at present and the indirect bandgap of SiC results in low-brightness blue 
LEDs. The most promising candidates are GaN (Eg = 3.44 eV) and related III-V nitride semiconductors such as 
AlGaInN, which have direct bandgaps ranging from 0.7 eV to 6.2 eV with corresponding wavelengths from 200 
nm to 1770 nm.8 Although there are no lattice-matched substrates for the growth of GaN, high-quality GaN has 
been grown on sapphire (Al2O3) using a low-temperature grown GaN or AlN as a buffer layer.
Figure 11a shows a DH nitride LED grown on a sapphire substrate. Due to the high resistivity of the sapphire 
substrate, both the n- and p-type ohmic contacts are formed on the top surface. The blue light originates from the 
radiative recombination InxGa1-xN region, which is sandwiched between two larger bandgap semiconductorsa 
p-type AlxGa1-xN layer and an n-type GaN. The higher bandgap p-type AlxGa1-xN confinement layer is used 
to block effectively the electron injected from n-GaN due to the higher conduction band offset. The multiple 
quantum well InxGa1-xN/GaN LED is shown in Fig. 11b, which has higher quantum efficiency from higher carrier 
recombination efficiency.
Visible LEDs can be used for full-color displays, full-color indicators, and lamps with high efficiency and 
high reliability. Figure 12 shows diagrams of two LED lamps.8 An LED lamp contains an LED chip and a plastic 
lens, which is usually colored to serve as an optical filter and to enhance contrast. The lamp in Fig. 12a uses a 
conventional diode header. Figure 12b shows a package that is suited for a transparent semiconductor, such as 
GaP and sapphire, which emits light through all five facets (four sides and the top) of the LED chip.

9.3.2 Organic LED
In recent years, certain organic semiconductors have been studied for electroluminescent applications. The organic 
light-emitting diode (OLED) is particularly useful for a multicolor, large-area flat-panel display because of its 
attributes of low-power consumption and excellent emissive quality with a wide viewing angle.10

Light-Emitting Diodes and Lasers 295

OLED and PLED
OLEDs are made from small molecules or polymers. Commonly, macro-molecules with a molecular weight 
greater than 10,000 atomic mass units (amu) are called polymers, whereas lighter molecules are referred to small 
molecules. Usually, a polymer light-emitting diode is referred to as a PLED. A small molecule light-emitting diode 
is referred to as an OLED because the first high-efficiency OLED was made from small molecules. The structures 
of the OLED prepared by vacuum deposition techniques or the PLED prepared by spin-coating, screen printing 
etc, are usually amorphous with current preparation methods.
Conductivities of Polymers and Small Molecules 
Carbon can form two primary hybrid structures. One structure is the tetrahedrally directed covalent bonds 
(sp3 hybridized) where valence electrons are tightly bound and act as insulators, as in diamond and saturated 
polymers (e.g., ethane, C2H6). The other structure is the hexagonally directed covalent bonds (sp2 hybridized) with 
planar geometry, as in graphite and conjugated polymers (e.g., ethylene, C2H4). The electron orbital will form a 
weak delocalized π-π bond with neighboring carbon atoms to result in alternating single and double bonds. The 
structure is said to be conjugated. The π electrons do not belong to a single bond or atom, but rather to a group 
of atoms. The electrons in the π-bonds are less strongly bound than the electrons in the σ-bonds and have the 
potential to display either semiconducting or metallic behavior.
Benzene (C6H6) has also the molecular structure of sp2 hybrid orbitals. It is a planar six-carbon ring with 
alternating single and double bonds, as shown in Fig. 13. The structural of benzene is also conjugated. In OLED, 
the benzene ring is an important base and is in charge of electron transport within small molecules; however, 
charge transport across the molecules is ascribed to a hopping process. In most organic semiconductors and unlike 
inorganic semiconductors, the mobility increases with temperature due to higher thermal energy. For OLED the 
mobility is low and related to the disordered nature of the solid-state nanostructure. The highest hole mobility is 
about 15 cm2/V-s and the highest electron mobility is about 0.1 cm2/V-s for a single crystal of small molecules. The 
molecules packed into well organized polycrystalline films will lead to higher mobility. 
Bandgaps
An organic molecule is covered with electrons with a specific spatial distribution and energy, which is the 
molecular orbital. Electrons occupy molecular orbitals from the lowest first to higher energy level. 
HOMO and LUMO are acronyms for highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular 
orbital, respectively. When two molecules interact, a splitting of the HOMO and the LUMO energy levels will 
be induced. When many molecules interact, a continuum HOMO band and LUMO band corresponding to 
the valence band and the conduction band of inorganic semiconductors will be formed, similar to inorganic 
semiconductors discussed in Chapter 1. The energy difference of the highest energy of HOMO band and the 
lowest energy of LUMO band is the band gap. Various kinds of organic semiconductors have various bandgaps. 
The optical emission and absorption of an OLED depends on its bandgap.
Fig. 13 Structure and delocalized π-bond and σ-bond of benzene. 
296 Semiconductors

Only 25% of the transitions are radiative recombinations according to spin statistics, and efficient 
electroluminescence is difficult to achieve using purely organic materials. An excited molecule (host emitter) can 
transfer energy to a molecule (guest emitter or dopant) in a lower energy state. If the dopant has higher efficiency, 
it can enhance the emission efficiency and also change the electroluminescence color and lifetime. 
OLED Structures
The high-performance OLED was developed using the concept of multilayer structures. Figure 14a shows the 
molecular structure of two representative organic semiconductors used for a double-layer structure.11 They are the 
tris (quinolin-8-olato) aluminum (AlQ3), and the aromatic diamine. AlQ3 contains six benzene rings connected 
to a central aluminum atom, which can strongly attract electrons and creates an electron-deficient state that is 
an electron transport layer (ETL). The aromatic diamine also contains six benzene rings but with a different 
molecular arrangement. Nitrogen in the diamine structure has a lone electron pair, which is easily ionized to accept 
holes. Therefore, diamine is a hole transport layer (HTL). A basic OLED has a number of layers on a transparent 
substrate (e.g., glass). On this substrate are deposited, in sequence, a transparent conductive anode [e.g., ITO 
(indium tin oxide)], the diamine as a HTL layer, the A1Q3 as a ETL layer, and the cathode contact (e.g., Mg alloy 
with 10% Ag). A cross-sectional view is shown in Fig. 14b. Figure 14c shows the band diagram of the OLED. 
It is basically a heterojunction formed between A1Q3 and diamine. Under proper biasing, electrons are injected 
from the cathode and move toward the heterojunction interface, whereas holes are injected from the anode and 
also move toward the interface. Because of the energy barriers ΔEC and ΔEV, these carriers will accumulate at the 
interface to enhance the chance of radiative recombination.
The function of the HTL is to assist the injection of holes from the anode, accept these holes, and transport 
them to the heterojunction interface. Therefore, the energy levels between the HTL and the anode should match 
for hole injection from the anode and the hole mobility should be high. It is better if the HTL layer also has an 
electron blocking function. The ETL has the function of assisting the injection of electrons from a metal cathode 
and transporting them throughout the ETL film. Therefore, the energy levels between the ETL and cathode 
should match for electrons injection from the cathode and the electron mobility should be high. It is better if 
the ETL layer also has a hole-blocking function. For the diamine/AlQ3 bilayer structure, ΔEV < ΔEC. The larger 
electron barrier ΔEC effectively blocks the electrons and confines them to the interface. The hole barrier ΔEV, 
however, is relatively small and thus can still allow significant amounts of hole injection into the AlQ3. Therefore, 
the ETL layer is also an emissive layer (EML). This configuration apparently improves EL efficiency by forcing the 
recombination to occur in the AlQ3 and limiting the electron leakage current. It is worth noting that the smaller 
a hole barrier, the smaller the applied voltage needed for the same current. But the increased hole injection into 
ETL/EML may not be desired because a larger portion of the holes can leak into the cathode or combine near the 
cathode where photoquenching centers are abundant. The photoquenching centers, i.e., nonemissive electron-hole 
recombination centers, are from the carbonyl groups that are formed by an oxidation reaction from the diffusion 
of oxygen and moisture from air into the AlQ3 through microscopic pinholes and cracks or grain boundaries in 
the cathode during the light exposure in the normal ambient. 
From Fig. 14c, we can specify the design criteria for an OLED: (a) ultrathin layers for low biasing voltage—
for example, the total thickness of the organic semiconductor layers shown is only 150 nm; (b) low injection 
barriers—the barrier height qϕ1 for hole injection and the barrier height qϕ2 for electron injection must be low 
enough to allow large carrier injections for high-current density operation, and (c) proper bandgaps for the 
required color. For A1Q3, the emitted light is green. By choosing different organic semiconductors with different 
bandgaps, various colors including red, yellow, and blue can be obtained.
Light-Emitting Diodes and Lasers 297

Fig. 14 (a) Organic semiconductors. (b) OLED cross-sectional view. (c) Band diagram of an OLED.
A triple-layer structure may be used where a thin EML is sandwiched between HTL and ETL (ITO/HTL/
EML/ETL/Metal), as shown in Fig. 15a. The electron and hole concentrations can be higher in EML and hence 
the light emission efficiency is higher, as shown in the band diagram of Fig. 15a. The insertion of a thin hole 
injection layer (HIL) between the ITO and the HTL to lower the barrier height qϕ1 not only lowers the drive 
voltage but also improves device durability. This is a four-layer structured OLED. The insertion of a thin electron 
injection layer (EIL) between the metal cathode and the ETL yields a five-layer (ITO/HIL/HTL/EML/ETL/EIL/
Metal) OLED with the corresponding band diagram shown in Fig. 15b. This structure will have higher efficiency.
9.3.3 White-Light LED 
There has been interest in the development of white LEDs for general illumination because LEDs have much 
higher efficiency than incandescent lamps. In addition, LEDs can last 10 times longer. 
White light can be produced by mixing two or three colors of an appropriate intensity ratio. There are 
basically two approaches to achieving white light. The first is to combine LEDs of different colors: red, green, 
and blue. This is not a popular approach since it is more costly and involves sophisticated electro-optical design 
to control the blending of different colors. The second approach, most commonly used, is to have a single LED 
covered with a color converter. A color converter is a material that absorbs the original LED light and emits 
light of different frequency. The converter material can be phosphor, organic dye, or another semiconductor, 
with phosphor the most common of the three.12 The light output from a phosphor generally has a much broader 
spectrum than the LED light. The efficiencies of these color converters can be very high, near 100%. One popular 
version is to use a blue LED together with a yellow phosphor. In this scheme, the LED light is partially absorbed 
by phosphor. The blue LED light is mixed with yellow light produced by the phosphor to give white light. Another 
version is to use a UV LED to stimulate red, green, and blue phosphors to give a white light.
9.3.4 Infrared LED
Infrared LEDs include gallium arsenide LEDs, which emit light near 0.9 m, and many III-V compounds, such as 
the quaternary GaxIn1-xAsyP1-y LEDs, which emit light from 1.1 to 1.6 m.
An important application of infrared LEDs is in opto-isolators, where an input or control signal is decoupled 
from the output. Figure 16 shows an opto-isolator having an infrared LED as the light source and a photodiode as 
the detector. When an input signal is applied to the LED, light is generated and subsequently detected by the

photodiode. The light is then converted back to an electrical signal as a current that flows through a load resistor. 
Opto-isolators transmit signals at the speed of light and are electrically isolated because there is no electrical 
feedback from the output to the input. 
Another important application of infrared LEDs is for transmission of an optical signal through an optical 
fiber, as in a communication system. An optical fiber is a waveguide at optical frequencies. The fiber is usually 
drawn from a preform of glass to a diameter of about 100 m. It is flexible and can guide optical signals over 
distances of many kilometers to a receiver, similarly to the way a coaxial cable transmits electrical signals.

Fig. 17 Optical fibers. (a) Step-index fiber having a core with slightly larger reflective index. (b) Graded-index fiber 
having a parabolic grading of the reflective index in the core.13
Two types of optical fibers are shown in Fig. 17. One type of fiber has a cladding layer of relatively pure 
fused silica (SiO2) surrounding a core of doped glass (e.g., germanium doped glass) with a higher refractive index 
than the cladding layer.13 This type of fiber is called a step-index fiber. The light is transmitted along the length of 
the fiber by internal reflection at the step in the refractive index. The critical angle for internal reflection is about

 (core, 20% Ge-doped), as calculated from Eq. 23. Note that 
different rays will propagate with different path lengths (Fig. 17a). A light pulse reaching the end of a step index 
fiber will result in a pulse spread. In a graded-index fiber (Fig. 17b), the index decreases from the core center by a 
parabolic law. Now, rays traversing toward the cladding have a higher velocity (due to lower refractive index) than 
rays along the center of the core. The pulse spread is significantly reduced. As the light is transmitted along the 
optical fiber, the light signal will be attenuated. However, due to the transparency of ultrapure silica used for  
the fiber material in the wavelength region from 0.8 to 1.6 m, the attenuation is quite low and is proportional  
to λ-4. Typical attenuations are about 3 dB/km at a wavelength of 0.8 m, 0.6 dB/km at 1.3 m, and 0.2 dB/km  
at l.55 m.14
300 Semiconductors

A simple point-to-point optical-fiber communication system is shown in Fig. 18, where the electrical input 
signals are converted to optical signals using an optical source (LED or laser). The optical signals are coupled into 
the fiber and transmitted to the photodetector, where they are converted back to electrical signals.
The surface-emitting infrared InGaAsP LED used for optical-fiber communication is shown15 in Fig. 19. 
The light is emitted from the central surface area and coupled into the optical fiber. The use of heterojunctions 
(e.g., InGaAsP-InP) can increase the efficiency that results from the confinement of the carrier by the layers of the 
higher-bandgap semiconductor InP surrounding the radiative-recombination region InGaAsP. The heterojunction 
can also serve as an optical window to the emitted radiation because the higher-bandgap-confining layers do not 
absorb radiation from the lower-bandgap-emitting region.

9.4 SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS
Semiconductor lasers are similar to the solid-state ruby laser and helium-neon gas laser in that the emitted 
radiation is highly monochromatic and produces a highly directional beam of light. However, the semiconductor 
laser differs from other lasers in that it is small (on the order of 0.1 mm long) and is easily modulated at high 
frequencies simply by modulating the biasing current. Because of these unique properties, the semiconductor 
laser is one of the most important light sources for optical-fiber communication. It is also used in video recording, 
optical reading, and high-speed laser printing. In addition, semiconductor lasers have significant applications in 
many areas of basic research and technology, such as high-resolution gas spectroscopy and atmospheric pollution 
monitoring.
9.4.1 Semiconductor Materials
All lasing semiconductors have direct bandgaps. This is expected because the momentum is conserved and 
the radiative-transition probability in a direct-bandgap semiconductor is high. At present, the laser emission 
wavelengths cover the range from 0.3 to over 30 m. Gallium arsenide was the first material to emit laser radiation 
and its related III-V compound alloys are the most extensively studied and developed. 
The three most important III-V compound alloy systems are GaxIn1-xAsyP1-y, GaxIn1-xAsySb1-y and AlxGa1-
xAsySb1-y solid solutions. Figure 20 shows the bandgaps plotted against the lattice constant for the three alloy 
systems and their binary, ternary and quaternary compounds.16 To achieve a heterostructure with negligible 
interface traps, the lattices between the two semiconductors must be matched closely.
If we use GaAs (a = 5.6533 Å) as the substrate, the ternary compound AlxGa1-xAs can have a lattice mismatch 
less than 0.1% for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1. With InP (a = 5.8687 Å) as the substrate, the quaternary compound GaxIn1-xAsyP1-y 
can have a nearly perfect lattice match, as indicated by the center vertical line in Fig. 20.

302 Semiconductors

Fig. 21 (a) Compositional dependence of the AlxGa1-xAs energy gap.1 (b) Compositional dependence of the refractive 
index at 1.38 eV.
Figure 21a shows the bandgap of ternary AlxGa1-xAs as a function of aluminum composition.1 The alloy 
has a direct bandgap up to x = 0.45, then becomes an indirect-bandgap semiconductor. Figure 21b shows the 
compositional dependence of the refractive index. Basically, the refractive index is inversely proportional to the 
bandgap. For example, for x = 0.3, the bandgap of AlxGa1-xAs is 1.789 eV, which is 0.365 eV larger than that of 
GaAs; its refractive index is 3.385, which is 6% smaller than that of GaAs. These properties are important for 
continuous operation of semiconductor lasers at and above room temperature.
The new class of nitride-based materials (AlGaN and AlInN) made a significant advance in the past decade. 
Blue lasers usually operate at 405 nm but in general the operation of these devices is demonstrated between 360 
and 480 nm. These devices have applications in many areas ranging from optical data storage in high-density 
digital video disc (HD DVD) to medical applications. Infrared and red lasers with a wavelength between 780 nm 
and 650 nm are currently used for optical data storage. To increase the capacity of optical disks, laser diodes with 
much shorter wavelengths are needed because the minimum spot size of focused light is limited by the wavelength 
of the light.
9.4.2 Laser Operation
Figure 22 shows schematic representations17 of the band diagram under forward-bias, the refractive index profile, 
and the optical-field distribution of light generated at the junction of a homojunction laser (Fig. 22a) and a 
double-heterostructure (DH) laser (Fig. 22b).
Population Inversion
As discussed in Section 9.1.1, to enhance the stimulated emission for laser operation we need population inversion. 
To achieve population inversion in a semiconductor laser, we consider a p-n junction or a double heterojunction 
(DH) formed between degenerate semiconductors. This means that the doping levels on both sides of the 
junction are high enough that the Fermi level EFV is below the valence band edge on the p-side and EFC is above 
the conduction band edge on the n-side. When a sufficiently large bias is applied (the band diagrams in Fig. 22), 
high injection occurs: that is, large concentrations of electrons and holes are injected into the transition region. 
As a result, the region d (Fig. 22) contains a large concentration of electrons in the conduction band and a large 
concentration of holes in the valence band; this is the required condition for population inversion. For band-to-
band transition, the minimum energy required is the bandgap energy Eg. Therefore, from the band diagram in Fig. 
22, we can write the condition necessary for population inversion: (EFC - EFV) > Eg.

The second from the top row shows energy band diagrams under forward bias. The refractive index change for a 
homojunction laser is less than 1%. The refractive index change for DH laser is about 5%. The confinement of light is 
shown in the bottom row.17
Carrier and Optical Confinement
As can be seen in the DH laser, the carriers are confined on both sides of the active region by the heterojunction 
barriers, whereas in the homojunction laser the carriers can move away from the active region, where radiative 
recombination occurs.
For the homojunction laser, the difference in the refractive indices between the center waveguiding layer and 
the adjacent layers arises from the difference of carrier density. Material with higher carrier density has a lower 
refractive index. Here the carrier density of the active layer is less than that heavily doped n+- and p+-layers. The 
refractive index change for a homojunction laser is only 0.1% to about 1%. In the DH laser the optical field is 
confined within the active region by the abrupt reduction of the refractive index outside the active region. The 
optical confinement can be explained by Fig. 23, which shows a three-layer dielectric wave guide with refractive 
indices n1 , n2  and n3, where an active layer is sandwiched between two confining layers (Fig. 23a). Under the 
condition n

≥
, the ray angle $12 at the layer 1/layer 2 interface in Fig. 23b exceeds the critical angle given 
by Eq. 23. A similar situation occurs for $23 at the layer 2/ layer 3 interface. Therefore, when the refractive index in 
the active layer is larger than the index of its surrounding layers, the propagation of the optical radiation is guided 
(confined) in a direction parallel to the layer interfaces. We can define a confinement factor Γ as the ratio of the 
light intensity within the active layer to the sum of light intensity both within and outside the active layer. The 
confinement factor is given as

where C is a constant, Δ n is the difference in the refractive index, and d is the thickness of the active layer. It is 
clear that the larger Δ n and d are, the higher Γ will be.
Optical Cavity and Feedback
We have considered the condition necessary to produce laser action: population inversion. Photons released by 
stimulated emission are likely to cause further stimulations as long as there is population inversion. This is the 
phenomenon of optical gain. The gain obtained in a single travel of an optical wave down a laser cavity is small. 
To increase gain, multiple passes of a wave must occur. This is achieved using mirrors placed at either end of 
the cavity, shown as the reflection planes at the left side and right side in Fig. 23a. For a semiconductor laser, the 
cleaved ends of the crystal forming the device can act as the mirrors. For a GaAs device, cleaving along (110) 
plane creates two parallel identical mirrors. Sometimes the back mirror of the laser is metallized to enhance the 
reflectivity. The reflectivity R at each mirror can be calculated as

that is, 32% of the light will be reflected at the cleaved surface. 
If an integral number of half-wavelengths fits between the two end planes, reinforced and coherent light will be 
reflected back and forth within the cavity. Therefore, for stimulated emission, the length L of the cavity must 
satisfy the condition

where m is an integral number. Obviously, many values of λ can satisfy this condition (Fig. 24a), but only those 
within the spontaneous emission spectrum will be produced (Fig. 24b). In addition, optical losses in the path 
traveled by the wave mean that only the strongest lines will survive, leading to a set of lasing modes, as shown 
in Fig. 24c. These modes are called longitudinal modes, as they occur because of standing waves formed in the 
longitudinal direction of a laser diode. The separation λ between the allowed modes in the longitudinal direction 
is the difference in the wavelengths corresponding to m and m +1. Differentiating Eq. 28a with respect to λ, we

As a typical laser is operated at low currents, the spontaneous emission has broad spectral distribution with 
a full width of half-maximum intensity of 5 to 20 nm. It is similar to emission in an LED. As the bias current 
approaches the threshold value, the optical gain can be high enough for amplification so that intensity peaks start 
to appear. At this bias level, the light is still incoherent due to the nature of spontaneous emission. When the bias 
reaches the threshold current, the lasing spectra suddenly become much narrower (< 1 Å), as shown in Fig. 24c, 
and the light is coherent and much more directional. The number of longitudinal modes can be reduced with 
further increase of bias current.

9.4.3 Basic Laser Structure
Figure 25 shows three laser structures.17,18 The first structure (Fig. 25a) is a basic p-n junction laser and is called 
a homojunction laser because it has the same semiconductor material (e.g., GaAs) on both sides of the junction. 
Under appropriate biasing conditions laser light will be emitted from these planes (only the front emission is 
shown in Fig. 25). The two remaining sides of the diode are roughened to eliminate lasing in the directions other 
than the main ones. This structure is called a Fabry-Perot cavity, with a typical cavity length L of about 300 m. 
The Fabry-Perot cavity configuration is used extensively for modern semiconductor lasers. 
Figure 25b shows a double-heterostructure (DH) laser, in which a thin layer of a semiconductor (e.g., GaAs) 
is sandwiched between layers of a different semiconductor (e.g.,AlxGa1-xAs). The laser structures shown in Figs. 
25a and b are broad-area lasers because the entire area along the junction plane can emit radiation. Figure 25c 
shows a DH laser with a stripe geometry. The oxide layer isolates all but the stripe contact; consequently the lasing 
area is restricted to a narrow region under the contact. The stripe widths S are typically 5-30 m. The advantages 
of the stripe geometry are reduced operating current, elimination of multiple-emission areas along the junction, 
and improved reliability that is the result of removing most of the junction perimeter. Due to the narrow active 
region, there is a substantial diffraction of the ouput at the interface with the air and the light output becomes a 
broad beam.
Threshold Current Density
One of the most important parameters for laser operation is the threshold current density Jth, which is the 
minimum current density required for lasing to occur. Figure 26 shows Jth versus operating temperature for 
a homojunction laser and a DH laser.17 Note that as the temperature increases, Jth for the DH laser increases 
much more slowly than Jth for the homojunction laser. Because of the low values of Jth for DH lasers at 300 K, 
DH lasers can be operated continuously at room temperature. This characteristic has led to the increased use of 
semiconductor lasers, especially in optical-fiber communication systems.
In a semiconductor laser, the gain g, the incremental optical energy flux per unit length, depends on the 
current density. The gain g can be expressed as a function of a nominal current density Jnom, which is defined for 
unity quantum efficiency (i.e., number of carriers generated per photon, η = 1) as the current density required to 
uniformly excite a 1 m thick active layer. The actual current density is then given by

As discussed previously, at low currents we have spontaneous emissions in all directions. As the current 
density increases, the gain increases (Fig. 27) until the threshold for lasing is reached, that is, until the gain satisfies

The term (J0d/g0ηΓ)is often called 1/β, where β is known as the gain factor. To reduce Jth, we can increase η, Γ, L,

Figure 28 compares the calculated Jth from Eq. 35 to experimental results from AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs DH lasers.1 
The Jth decreases with decreasing d, reaching a minimum, and then increases again. The increase of Jth at very 
small active layer thickness is caused by the poor confinement factor Γ. For a given d, Jth decreases with increasing 
Al composition x because of the improved optical confinement.

Modulation Frequency and Longitudinal Modes
For optical fiber communications, the optical source must be modulated at high frequencies. Unlike LEDs, whose 
output power decreases with increasing modulation bandwidth (Eq. 13), the output power of typical GaAs or 
GaInAsP laser remains at a constant level (e.g., 10 mW per facet) well into GHz range.
For a stripe-geometry GaInAs-AlGaAs DH laser at a current above the threshold, many emission lines exist 
that are approximately evenly spaced with a separation of λ (e.g., λ = 4 Å in Ex. 4). These emission lines belong 
to the longitudinal modes given in Eq. 29. Because of these longitudinal modes, the stripe geometry laser is not a 
spectrally pure light source. For optical-fiber communication systems, an ideal light source is one that has a single 
frequency. This is because light pulses of different frequencies travel through optical fiber at different speeds, thus 
causing pulse spread.
9.4.4 Distributed Feedback Lasers
Because of the multimodes in stripe-geometry lasers, these devices are useful only for telecommunication systems 
operated at relatively low rates (i.e., below 1 Gbit/s). For advanced optical fiber systems, single-frequency lasers are 
necessary. A single frequency laser operates in only one longitudinal mode. The fundamental approach is to take a 
laser cavity that allows only one mode to resonate and to provide a constructive interference mechanism that picks 
out a single frequency. Two laser configurations use this approach—the distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser 
and the distributed feedback (DFB) laser, as shown in Fig. 30.21
The DBR is a mirror that has been designed like a reflection type diffraction grating, which has a period 
corrugated structure. The diffraction grating is somewhat like the double-slit arrangement, but has a much 
greater number of slits. When monochromatic light is sent through the slits, it forms narrow interference fringes. 
Diffraction gratings can also be opaque surfaces with narrow parallel grooves arranged like the slits. Light then 
scatters back from the grooves to form interference fringes rather than being transmitted through open slits. 
Such reflectors act as frequency-selective mirrors because the constructive and destructive diffraction interference 
patterns are extremely sensitive to the wavelength of light. The particular Fabry-Perot cavity mode close to λB can 
lase and exist in the output.
Figure 30a shows the cross section of a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. The region that conducts 
electric current is called the pumped region. A wavelength-selection grating is placed outside the pumped region. 
Because of efficient coupling between the active region and the passive grating structure, the reflection is enhanced 
at the wavelength λB, known as the Bragg wavelength, which is related to the period of the grating Λ by
 
λB
n
l
2 Λ  
(37)
where n  is the effective refractive index of the mode and l is the integer order of the grating. The mode at the 
Bragg wavelength that has the lowest loss, and thus the lowest threshold gain, will have the dominant output.
Figure 30b shows the distributed feedback (DFB) laser, which has a corrugated grating structure within 
the active region. The grating region has a periodically varying index of refraction that enhances the wavelength 
closest to the Bragg wavelength, thus achieving single-frequency operation. Because of the small temperature 
dependence of the refractive index, the lasing wavelength of the DFB laser has a very small temperature coefficient 
(~0.5 Å/oC), while the temperature coefficient for a corresponding stripe-geometry laser is much larger (~3 Å/oC), 
because it follows the temperature dependence of the bandgap. DBR and DFB lasers are also useful as optical 
sources in integrated optics, which uses miniature optical waveguide components and circuits made by planar 
technology on rigid substrates.

9.4.5 Quantum-Well Lasers
The structure of a quantum-well (QW) laser21,22 is similar to that of a DH laser except that the thickness of the 
active layer in a QW laser is very small, about 10-20 nm. Figure 31a shows the band diagram of a QW laser where 
the central GaAs region (Ly ≅ 20 nm) is sandwiched between two larger bandgap AlGaAs layers. The length Ly is 
comparable to the de Broglie wavelength (λ = h/p, where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum of the 
charge carrier), and the carriers are confined in a finite potential well in the y-direction.
Figure 31b shows the energy levels in the quantum well derived in Appendix H. The values of En are shown 
as E1, E2, E3 for electrons, Ehh1, Ehh2, Ehh3, for heavy holes,§ and Elh1, Elh2 for light holes.21 The usual parabolic forms 
for the conduction and valence band density of states have been replaced by a “staircase” representation of 
discrete levels (Fig. 31c). Since the density of states is constant rather than gradually increasing from zero, as in a 
conventional laser, there is a group of electrons of nearly the same energy available shown in Fig. 31d to recombine 
with a group of holes of nearly the same energy, for example, the level E1 in the conduction band with the level 
Ehh1 in the valence band. The sharper electron profile at the band edge, E1 in this case, makes population inversion 
much easier to achieve, so that QW lasers offer significant improvement in laser performance, such as reduced 
threshold current, high output power, and high speed, compared with the conventional DH lasers. QW lasers 
made in GaAs/AlGaAs material systems have threshold current densities as low as 65 A/cm2 and submilliampere 
threshold currents. These lasers operate at emission wavelengths around 0.9 m.
At high current bias, more than one subbands are filled with injected carriers. The internal emission spectrum 
is thus much wider. The lasing wavelength, however, is also selected by other means such as the optical cavity 
length. So in a quantum-well laser, wavelength tuning can cover a wider range.
 
§ In GaAs, the effective mass for heavy holes is 0.62 mo and that for light holes is 0.07 mo.

well, (c) density of states for electrons and holes within the well, and (d) electron concentration distribution.
9.4.6 Separate-Confinement Heterostructure MQW laser
One drawback of the thin active layer in a quantum-well laser is the poor optical confinement. This can be 
improved with multiple quantum wells stacked on the top of one another. Multiple-quantum-well lasers have 
higher quantum efficiency as well as higher output power. Single or multiple quantum wells can be incorporated in 
a separate-confinement heterostructure (SCH) scheme to improve optical confinement.
Figure 32a shows a schematic diagram of a separate-confinement-heterostructure (SCH) MQW laser for the 
1.3 m and 1.5 m wavelength regions where four QWs of GaInAs with GaInAsP barrier layers are sandwiched 
between the InP cladding layers to form a waveguide with a step-index change.23 These alloy compositions are 
chosen so that they are lattice matched to the InP substrate. The active region is composed of four 8 nm thick, 
undoped GaInAs QWs (with Eg of 0.75 eV) separated by 30 nm thick undoped GaInAsP barrier layers (with Eg  
of 0.95 eV ).

bandgaps to approximate the graded-index change.23
Figure 32b shows the corresponding band diagram of the active region. The n- and p-cladding InP layers 
are doped with sulfur (1018 cm-3) and zinc (l017cm-3), respectively. A graded-index SCH (GRIN-SCH) is shown in 
Fig. 32c, in which a GRIN of the waveguide is accomplished by several small stepwise increases of the bandgap 
energies of multiple cladding layers. The GRIN-SCH structure confines both the carriers and the optical field 
more effectively than the SCH structure and, consequently, leads to an even lower threshold current density. 
9.4.7 Quantum-Wire and Quantum-Dot lasers
In quantum-wire and quantum-dot lasers, the active regions are reduced to the de Broglie wavelength regime, into 
1-D (one dimension) (wire) and 0-D (zero dimension) (island) formation. These wires and dots are placed between 
a p-n junction as shown in Fig. 33. To realize such small dimensions, the small active regions are mostly formed by 
epitaxial regrowth on specially processed surfaces (etched, cleaved, vicinal, or V-groove), or by a process called self-
ordering after epitaxy. The advantages of these lasers are similar to the quantum-well laser. These advantages also 
stem from their respective densities of states. These densities of states give rise to the optical-gain spectra which are 
compared in Fig. 34.24 
The optical gains include those from regular 3-D (bulk) active layer down to quantum dots. As seen, the 
peak gains for quantum wires and quantum dots are progressively higher, and their shapes are sharper. These 
gain characteristics give low threshold current. The reduction of threshold current for different structures are 
summarized in Fig. 35,25,26 which also indicates their introduction in chronological order.

spectrum as dimensionality is reduced.24
9.4.8 Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL)
So far the lasers discussed are edge-emitting so that the light output is parallel to the active layer. In a 
surface-emitting laser as shown in Fig. 36, however, the light output is orthogonal to the active layer and the 
semiconductor surface, whence the name vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL).27 The VCSEL usually has 
an active layer formed by multiple quantum wells. The optical cavity is formed by two distributed-Bragg reflectors 
(DBRs) surrounding the active layer. These DBRs have a high reflectivity of more than 90%.
The high reflectivity is required since the optical gain per pass is small due to the small optical cavity 
compared to an edge-emitting laser. The benefits of a small optical cavity include low threshold current, and 
single-mode lasing, since the mode separation is wide (Eq. 29). Other advantages of the VCSEL are the realization 
of a 2-D laser array, ease of coupling light output to other media such as optical fiber and optical interconnect, 
compatibility with IC processing for integrated optics, high-volume and low-cost production, high speed, and on-
wafer testing capability.

9.4.9
Quantum-Cascade Laser  
The structure of the quantum cascade laser is shown in Fig. 37.28 The active region is composed of multiple 
quantum wells (usually two or three quantum wells) or a superlattice, which create quantized subband energy 
levels in the conduction band. The electron transition between intersubband emits a photon with an energy much 
smaller than the energy gap. The quantum cascade laser is capable of lasing in long wavelengths, without the 
difficulties of very narrow-energy-gap semiconductors, which are much less stable and less developed. Wavelengths 
beyond 70 μm have been achieved. Besides, the wavelength is tunable by varying the quantum-well thicknesses. The 
intersubband transition is the major difference from the interband transition in a conventional laser.

A period consists of an active region and a superlattice injector, and is repeated in series.28
Fig. 38 Energy-band diagrams for heterostructure superlattice. 
The difference between multiple quantum wells and a superlattice is that when quantum wells are separated 
from one another by thick barrier layers, there is no communication between them and this system can be 
described only as multiple quantum wells. However, when the barrier layers between them become thin enough 
that wavefunctions start to overlap, a heterostructure superlattice is formed (e.g., GaAs/AlxGa1–xAs, with each layer 
10 nm or less in thickness). The superlattice has two major differences from a multiple-quantum-well system: (1) 
the energy levels are continuous in space across the barrier, and (2) the discrete bands widen into minibands, as 
shown in Fig. 38. Since the continuous conduction band is divided into subbands, electrons no longer reside on the 
band edges EC but on these subbands only. 
The electron injector is composed of a superlattice with the miniband formed in the conduction band. 
Electrons in the injector are injected through resonant tunneling to the sublevel E3 in the active region. (see Section 
8.5 for resonant tunneling.) The radiative transition between E3 and E2 in the active region is responsible for lasing. 
Electrons in E2 relax to E1 and then tunnel to the miniband of the succeeding injector through resonant tunneling, 
or they can also tunnel directly from E2 to the injector. Resonant tunneling is a very fast process so that the 
electron concentration in E2 is always less than that in E3; thus population inversion is maintained. 
Design of the minibands plays a critical role and is dependent on the nonuniform thicknesses of the quantum 
wells. Notice that in Fig. 37 E3 is not aligned to a miniband of the succeeding injector, so tunneling to the injector 
is blocked and high concentration at E3 can be maintained. The design of the injector is also critical. Under bias, 
the miniband should remain flat for efficient resonant tunneling. This has to be done by careful tailoring of the 
injector superlattice with a special doping profile, thickness profile, or barrier profile.
318
Semiconductors

The period, consisting of the active region plus the injector, is repeated many times (20-100), and this cascade 
scheme helps to establish a high external quantum efficiency and low threshold current since the same carrier 
can produce many photons. This phenomenon is not possible in a conventional laser. Due to the small transition 
energy, lower-temperature operation is required. Nevertheless, CW operation has been achieved at ~ 150K and 
pulsed operation at room temperature.
 
SUMMARY
The operation of photonic devices (LEDs and laser diodes) depends upon the emission of photons. Photons are 
emitted when charge carriers recombine.
LEDs are p-n junctions that can emit spontaneous radiation due to recombination of electrons and holes in 
a forward-biased junction. Visible LEDs can emit radiation with photon energies in the range of 1.8 to 2.8 eV, 
corresponding to wavelengths from 0.7 to 0.4 μm. They are used extensively for displays and various electronic 
instruments. By combining LEDs of different colors (i.e., red, green, and blue), we can form white LEDs that 
are useful for general illumination. Organic semiconductors can also be used for display applications. OLED is 
particularly useful for multicolor large-area flat-panel displays. Infrared LEDs can emit radiation with hv < 1.8 eV. 
They are used for opto-isolator and short-distance optical-fiber communication.
The laser diode is also a p-n junction operated under forward bias condition. However, the diode structure 
must provide the confinement of the carriers and the optical field so that the stimulated emission condition can be 
established. Laser diodes have evolved from the homojunction, to double heterojunction, to distributed feedback 
configuration, and to quantum-well structures. The main objectives are to lower the threshold current density and 
to have single-frequency operation. The laser diode is a key device in long-distance optical-fiber communication 
systems. It is also extensively used for video recording, high-speed printing, and optical reading.

SUMMARY
Photodetectors are semiconductor devices that electrically detect optical signals. At its operating wavelength, the 
photodetector should have high sensitivity, high response speed, minimum noise, small size, low voltage, and high 
reliability under operating conditions. Solar cells are used to generate power from the sunlight and have some 
similarities with photodetectors. The main differences between them are device area, operating frequency, and 
optical source. 
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
Absorption of photons to create electron-hole pairs for photodetectors.
r
Structures of some important photodetectors.
r
Absorption of photons to convert them to electrical energy from solar cells.

10.1 PHOTODETECTORS
Photodetectors are semiconductor devices that can convert optical signals into electrical signals. The operation of 
a photodetector involves three steps: carrier generation by incident light, carrier transport and/or multiplication 
by whatever current-gain mechanism may be available, and interaction of the current with the external circuit to 
provide the output signal.
Photodetectors have a broad range of applications, including infrared sensors in optoisolators and detectors 
for optical-fiber communications. For these applications, the photodetectors must have high sensitivity at the 
operating wavelengths, high response speed, and low noise. In addition, the photodetector should be compact, use 
low biasing voltages or currents, and be reliable under the required operating conditions.
10.1.1 Photoconductor
A photoconductor consists simply of a slab of semiconductor with ohmic contacts at each end of the slab as 
shown in Fig. 1a, and a corresponding layout that consists of interdigitated contacts shown in Fig. 1b. When 
incident light falls on the surface of the photoconductor, electron-hole pairs are generated either by band-to-band 
transition (intrinsic) or by transitions involving forbidden-gap energy levels (extrinsic), resulting in an increase in 
conductivity.

and the increase in conductivity under illumination is due mainly to the increase in the number of carriers. 
The long-wavelength cutoff for an intrinsic photoconductor is given by Eq. 9, Chapter 9. For the extrinsic 
photoconductor, photoexcitation may occur between the band edge and an energy level in the energy gap. In this 
case, the long-wavelength cutoff is determined by the depth of the forbidden-gap energy level.
Consider the operation of a photoconductor under illumination. At time zero, the number of carriers 
generated in a unit volume by a given photon flux is n0- At a later time t, the number of carriers n(t) in the same 
volume decays by recombination as

If we assume a steady flow of photon flux impinging uniformly on the surface of a photoconductor (Fig. 1a) with 
an area A = WL, the total number of photons arriving at the surface is (Popt/hν) per unit time, where Popt is the 
incident optical power and hν is the photon energy. At steady state, the carrier-generation rate G must be equal to 
the recombination rate n/τ. If the detector thickness D is much larger than the light penetration depth 1/α, the total

For a sample with long minority-carrier lifetime and short electrode spacing, the gain can be substantially 
greater than unity. Gains as high as 106 can be obtained from some photoconductors. The response time of a 
photoconductor is determined by the transit time tr. To achieve short transit time requires that we use small 
electrode spacing and a high electric field. The response times of photoconductors cover a wide range, from 10-3 
to 10-10 seconds. They are extensively used for infrared detection, especially for wavelengths greater than a few 
micrometers.
10.1.2 Photodiode
A photodiode is basically a p-n junction operated under reverse bias. The space-charge and the electric-field 
distributions are similar to those in Fig. 6 in Chapter 3 except under reverse bias. Note that the electric-field 
distribution is nonuniform and the maximum field is at the junction. When an optical signal penetrates into the 
depletion region of the photodiode, the electric field in the depletion region serves to separate the photogenerated 
EHPs (electron-hole pairs) and an electric current, called photocurrent Ip, flows in the external circuit. The 
photogenerated holes drift in the depletion region, diffuse into the neutral p region, and then combine with 
Photodetectors and Solar Cells 325

electrons entered from the negative electrode. Similarly, photogenerated electrons drift in the opposite direction. 
When an optical signal penetrates within a diffusion length outside the depletion region, the photogenerated 
carriers will diffuse into the depletion region and drift across the depletion region to the other side. These neutral 
regions can be regarded as resisitive extensions of electrodes to the depletion region. The photocurrent depends 
on the number of photogenerated EHPs and the drift velocities of the carriers. It should be noted that the 
photocurrent in the external circuit is due only to the flow of electrons, even though there is electron and hole drift 
in the depletion region. 
For high-frequency operation, the depletion region must be kept thin to reduce the transit time. On the other 
hand, to increase the quantum efficiency the depletion layer must be sufficiently thick to allow a large fraction of 
the incident light to be absorbed. Thus, there is a trade-off between the response speed and quantum efficiency.
Quantum Efficiency
The quantum efficiency, as mentioned above, is the number of EHPs generated for each incident photon:

(9)
where Ip is the photogenerated current from the absorption of incident optical power Popt at a wavelength λ 
(corresponding to a photon energy hν) and is known more specifically  as the external quantum efficiency. The 
internal quantum efficiency is defined as the photogenerated number of EHPs per absorbed photon. One of 
the key factors that determine η is the absorption coefficient α (Fig. 5, Chapter 9). Since α is a strong function 
of the wavelength, the wavelength range in which appreciable photocurrent can be generated is limited. The 
long-wavelength cutoff λc is established by the bandgap (Eq. 9, Chapter 9) and is about 1.8 m for germanium 
and 1.1 m for silicon. For wavelengths longer than λc, the values of α are too small to give appreciable band-to-
band absorption. For wavelengths much shorter than λc, the values of α are too large (~105 cm-1), and hence the 
radiation is mostly absorbed very near the surface where recombination time is short. Therefore, the photocarriers 
can recombine before they can be collected in the depletion region of p-n junction. 
The photogenerated carriers in the depletion region may disappear by recombination or by trapping without 
contributing to the photocurrent. The quantum efficiency is always less than unity. It depends on the absorption 
coefficient and the device structure. The quantum efficiency can be increased by reducing the surface reflection on 
the device to increase the absorption in the depletion region, and by preventing the recombination or trapping of 
carriers through improving material and device quality.

326 Semiconductors

Fig. 3 Responsivity vs. wavelength for an ideal photodiode with η = 1 and for a typical commercial Si photodiode. 
Figure 2 shows typical plots of quantum efficiency versus wavelength for some high-speed photodiodes.1,2 
Note that in the ultraviolet and visible region, metal-semiconductor photodiodes (discussed  in Section 10.1.4) 
show good quantum efficiencies. In the near-infrared region, silicon photodiodes (with an antireflection coating) 
can reach 100% quantum efficiency near the 0.8- to 0.9-μm region. In the 1.0- to 1.6-μm region, germanium 
photodiodes and Group III-V photodiodes (e.g., GaInAs) have shown high quantum efficiencies. For even longer 
wavelengths, photodiodes are cooled (e.g., to 77 K) for high-efficiency operation.
Responsivity
The responsivity R of a photodiode is defined as the generated photocurrent (Ip) per incident optical power (Popt). 
R is also called the spectral responsivity or radiant sensivity:
 
R = Ip/ Popt 
(10)
From the definition of quantum efficiency, we have
 
R = Ip/ Popt = ηq/hν=ηqλ/hc 
(11)
If a photodiode has an ideal quantum efficiency of 100%, then R should be linearly proportional to the 
wavelength. In practice, the relationship of R and λ is shown in Fig. 3. The quantum efficiency limits the 
responsivity below the ideal photodiode.
Response Speed
The response speed is limited by three factors: (1) diffusion of carriers, (2) drift time in the depletion region, 
and (3) capacitance of the depletion region. Carriers generated outside the depletion region must diffuse to the 
junction, resulting in considerable time delay. To minimize the diffusion effect, the junction should be formed very 
close to the surface. The greatest amount of light will be absorbed when the depletion region is wide. However, 
the depletion layer must not be too wide or transit time effects will limit the frequency response. It also should 
not be too thin, or excessive capacitance C will result in a large RC time constant, where R is the load resistance. 
The optimal compromise is the width at which the depletion layer transit time is approximately one half the 
modulation period. For example, for a modulation frequency of 2 GHz, the optimal depletion-layer thickness in 
silicon (with a saturation velocity of 107 cm/s) is about 25 m.
Photodetectors and Solar Cells 327

10.1.3 p-i-n Photodiode
As described above, the p-n junction photodiode has two major drawbacks. First, the junction capacitance is not 
sufficiently small, due to the small depletion layer width. For example, the depletion layer width is below 1 μm 
for a p+-n silicon junction as in Ex. 2 in Chapter 3. It contributes a large RC time constant so that the photodiode 
cannot operate at high modulation frequencies. In addition, its depletion layer is not sufficiently wide to make 
the penetration depth greater than the depletion layer width at long wavelengths. The penetration depth is about 
33 μm, for example, at the wavelength 900 nm shown in Fig. 5, Chapter 9. Most incident photons are absorbed 
outside the depletion region where there is no field to separate the EHPs.
The p-i-n (p-intrinsic-n) photodiode is one of the most common photodetectors, because the depletion layer 
thickness (the intrinsic layer) can be tailored to optimize the quantum efficiency and frequency response. The 
i-layer thickness is typically 5~50 μm depending on the particular application. The intrinsic i-layer in a p-i-n 
photodiode is completely depleted. The junction capacitance is sufficiently small due to the large depletion layer 
width to make the p-i-n photodiode operate at high modulation frequencies. Its depletion layer is also wide enough 
to have a large absorption in the depletion layer at long wavelengths.
Figure 4a shows a cross section of a p-i-n photodiode that has an antireflection coating to increase quantum 
efficiency. The surface reflection of the incident light from air (n = 1) into semiconductor silicon (n = 3.5) is 
about 0.31, from Eq. 22 in Chapter 9. This means that 31% of incident light is reflected and is not available for 
conversion to electrical energy. Covering the surface with an antireflection coating with a refractive index n = (nSi)1/2 
minimizes the total reflection. Si3N4 with n = 1.9 is a good choice. Figures 4b shows the energy band diagram of 
the p-i-n diode under reverse bias condition. The conduction band decreases linearly with distance and the electric 
field is uniform in the i-layer. 
The optical absorption is shown in Fig. 4c. The p-i-n structure is designed so that almost complete optical 
absorption occurs over the i-layer. The EHPs produced in the depletion region or within a diffusion length of it 
from light absorption will eventually be separated by the electric field and a current flows in the external circuit as 
carriers drift across the depletion layer.
Generally, the response time is limited by the drift time of the slowest photogenerated carriers, holes, across 
the width of i-layer. A narrower i-layer improves the response time but decreases the quantity of absorbed photons 
and hence reduces the responsivity. To increase the response speed, i.e., to reduce the drift time, we have to increase 
the reverse bias. There is therefore a trade-off between speed and responsivity.
In practice, the i-layer will have a slight background doping, The structure is more like p+-π-n+ or p+-ν-n+ 
mentioned in Fig. 27 in Chapter 3. The field is not uniform across the i-layer. As an approximation, we can still 
consider it as a p-i-n structure. 
 EXAMPLE 2
On reaching the surface of the semiconductor, the incident optical power P0 will have its level reduced to P0(l - R) 
on entering the material, where R is the reflection coefficient. On passing though the semiconductor the light will 
be absorbed, and so at any depth x the amount of residual optical power P(x) is given by P(x) = P0(l - R) exp(-αx). 
For α = 104 cm-1 and R = 0.1, calculate the depth at which half the incident optical power has been absorbed in a 
material.

The diameter of the optical receiving area of a Si p-i-n photodiode is 0.06 cm. It is illuminated with an incident 
optical intensity of 0.2 mW/cm2 at wavelength 800 nm to generate a photocurrent of 3 × 10-4 mA. What are the 
responsivity and quantum efficiency of the p-i-n photodiode at 800 nm?
SOLUTION
The incident optical intensity is 0.2 mW/cm2 and the diameter of optical receiving area is 0.06 cm. Thus, the 
incident power is 
 
Popt = π (0.03cm)2 × 0.2 mW/cm2 = 5.6 × 10-4 mW
The responsivity is 
 
R = Ip/ Popt = 3 × 10-4 mA/5.6 × 10-4 mW = 0.54 A/W
Photodetectors and Solar Cells 329

The quantum efficiency is 
 
η= R (hc /qλ) = 0.54 A/W (6.62 × 10-34 J-s)(3 × 108 m/s)/(1.6 × 10-19 C)(80
 
× 10-9m) = 0.84 = 84% . 
10.1.4 Metal-Semiconductor Photodiode
The construction of a high-speed metal-semiconductor (M-S) photodiode is shown in Fig. 5. To avoid large 
reflection and absorption losses when the diode is illuminated through the metal contact, the metal film must 
be very thin (~10 nm) and an antireflection coating must be used. Metal-semiconductor (M-S) photodiodes are 
particularly useful in the ultraviolet- and visible-light regions. In these regions the absorption coefficients, α, in 
most common semiconductors are very high, of the order of 105 cm-1 or more, which corresponds to an effective 
absorption length 1/α of 0.1 m or less. It is possible to choose a metal and an antireflection coating so that a 
large fraction of the incident radiation will be absorbed near the surface of the semiconductor. As an example, for 
a gold-silicon photodetector having 10 nm gold and 50 nm zinc sulfide as the antireflection coating, more than 
95% of the incident light with λ = 0.6328 m (helium-neon laser wavelength, red light) will be transmitted into the 
silicon substrate.
    The M-S photodiode can be operated in two modes, depending on the photon energy. For hν > Eg (Fig. 6a), the 
radiation produces EHPs in the semiconductor, and the general characteristics of the M-S photodiode are very 
similar to those of a p-i-n photodiode. For smaller photon energy (longer wavelength) qϕB < hν < Eg (Fig. 6b), the 
photoexcited electrons in the metal can surmount the barrier and be collected by the semiconductor. This process 
is called internal photoemission and has been used extensively to determine the Schottky-barrier height and to 
study the hot electron transport in metal films.
When a Schottky-barrier diode is scanned with light of variable wavelength, Fig. 6c shows that the quantum 
efficiency has a threshold of qϕB that increases with the photon energy. When the photon energy reaches the 
energy-gap value, the quantum efficiency jumps to a much higher value. In practical applications, however, the 
internal photoemission has typical quantum efficiencies of only less than 1%.
For detectors with internal photoemission, it is more efficient to direct the incoming light through the 
substrate. Since the barrier height is always smaller than the energy gap, light with qϕB < hν < Eg is not absorbed 
in the semiconductor, and the intensity is not reduced at the metal/semiconductor interface. The metal layer, in 
this case, can be thicker for easier thickness control and to minimize series resistance. For Si devices, options are 
available using silicides in place of the metal. A silicide usually has a more reproducible interface since it is formed 
by reacting metal with Si so that the new interface is never exposed. Common silicides used for this purpose are 
PtSi, Pd2Si, and IrSi. Another advantage of a Schottky-barrier diode is that it does not require high-temperature 
processing for diffusion or implantation annealing.

10.1.5  Avalanche Photodiode
An avalanche photodiode (APD) is operated under a reverse-bias voltage that is sufficient to enable avalanche 
multiplication. The multiplication results in internal current gain and the device can respond to light modulated at 
frequencies as high as microwave frequencies.
One important consideration in the design of an APD is the need to minimize avalanche noise. The avalanche 
noise arises from the random nature of the avalanche multiplication process, in which every electron-hole pair 
generated at a given distance in the depletion region does not experience the same multiplication. The avalanche 
noise depends on the ratio of the ionization coefficients αp /αn: the smaller the ratio, the smaller the avalanche 
noise. This is because when αp = αn, each incident photocarrier results in three carriers in the multiplicating region: 
the primary carrier and its secondary hole and electron. A fluctuation that changes the number of carriers by 
one represents a large percentage change, and the noise will be large. On the other hand, if one of the ionization 
coefficients approaches zero (e.g., αp → 0), each incident photocarrier can result in a large number of carriers in 
the multiplication region. In this case, a fluctuation of one carrier is a relatively insignificant perturbation. To 
minimize the avalanche noise, we should use semiconductors with a large difference in αp and αn. The noise factor 
is given by

where M is the multiplication factor. We can see from Eq. 12 that when αp = αn, the noise factor has a maximum 
value of M; while for αp /αn = 0 and for a large M, the minimum noise factor is 2.

distribution. (d) Quantum efficiency.
Figure 7a shows the structure of typical silicon APD having a n+-p-π-p+ doping profile (π is a lightly doped 
p-region). The n+-side is thin and is illuminated through a window. There are three p-type layers p-π-p+ with 
different doping concentrations next to the n+-layer. The net space charge distribution is shown in Fig. 7b. The 
field distribution across the diode is shown in Fig. 7c. The maximum electric field is at the n+-p junction, and then 
decreases slowly through the p-layer. It decreases slightly through the π-layer due to the small net space charge 
density. The field vanishes at the end of the narrow depletion layer in the p+-side. The diode is reverse biased to 
increase the fields in the depletion region. Under zero bias the depletion width in the p-region does not normally 
extend to the π-layer. Under sufficient reverse bias, the depletion width in the p-region can be widened to reach 
through the π-layer. The absorption of photons and hence EHPs generation is mainly in the π-layer due to the very 
thin n+ and p layers. The electrons and holes drift in the π-layer at saturation velocities. When the electrons reach 
the p-layer, they experience high fields and acquire sufficient kinetic energy to cause avalanche and a large number 
of EHPs can be generated. This internal gain can result in a quantum efficiency in excess of unity. 
The photogeneration is in the π-layer and the avalanche is in the p-layer. The advantage of the separation of 
photogeneration region and avalanche region is that the photogenerated electrons drift into the avalanche region 
but not the photogenerated holes in Fig. 7. The avalanche caused by electrons with the higher impact ionization 
efficiency has minimum noise.
There is an n-type doped guard ring surrounding the central n+ region, so that the breakdown voltage around 
the periphery is higher and avalanche is confined to the illuminated area.
The quantum efficiency is near 100% at a wavelength of about 0.75 m for a device having a SiO2-Si3N4 
antireflection coating (Fig. 7d). Because the ratio of αp /αn is about 0.04, the noise factor obtained from Eq. 12 is 
2.3 for M = 10.

10.1.6 Phototransistor
A phototransistor can have high gain through the internal bipolar-transistor action. On the other hand, the 
fabrication of a phototransistor is more complicated than that of a photodiode, and the inherent larger area 
degrades its high-frequency performance. Compared to an avalanche photodiode, it eliminates the high voltage 
required and high noise associated with avalanche, yet provides reasonable photocurrent gain.
A structure of bipolar phototransistor is shown in Fig. 8a, together with its circuit model in Fig. 8b. It differs 
from a conventional bipolar transistor in having a large base-collector junction as the light-collecting element, 
represented by a parallel combination of a diode and a capacitor in the model. 
The phototransistor is biased in the active regime. For an n-p-n structure with a floating base, the collector is 
positively biased with respect to the emitter. This simply means that the collector-base junction is reversed biased 
and emitter-base junction is forward biased. The energy-band diagram illustrating the response to light is shown 
in Fig. 8c. The photogenerated holes, in the base-collector depletion region and within a distance of the diffusion 
length, flow to the energy maximum and are trapped in the base. This accumulation of holes or positive charges 
lowers the base energy (raises the potential) and allows a large flow of electrons from the emitter to the collector 
due to the exponential relationship between IE and VBE, i.e., IE∝ e qVBE / kT .. The result of a much larger electron 
current caused by a small hole current is the consequence of emitter injection efficiency γ and is the dominant gain 
mechanism that is common to the bipolar transistor and the phototransistor, provided that the electron transit 
time through the base is much shorter than the minority-carrier lifetime. The photogenerated electrons in the base-
collector depletion region that are within a diffusion length distance can flow to the emitter or to the collector, 
depending on the location of origin. Strictly speaking, they can reduce the emitter current or enhance the collector 
current, but only by a very small amount since the gain is large and the total collector current or emitter current is 
much larger than the photocurrent.
For simplicity, we assume that light is absorbed near the base-collector junction. Since the base is open, we 
have IE = IC. From Fig. 8c and using the conventional bipolar transistor parameters, the total collector current is 
given by
 
IC = Iph + ICO + αTInE, 
(13)
Fig. 8 (a) Schematic structure of phototransistor. (b) Equivalent circuit. (c) Energy-band diagram under bias showing 
different current components. Dashed lines indicate the shift of base potential (open base) under illumination. 
Photodetectors and Solar Cells 333

where Iph is the photocurrent, ICO is the reverse leakage current of the collector-base junction, and αT is the base 
transport factor. Since the base is open, the net base current is zero and
 
IpE + (1 - αT)InE = Iph + ICO. 
(14)
From Eqs, 13 and 14, and the definition of emitter efficiency γ, we have
 
InE = γIE, 
(15)
Then, Eq. 15 is changed to
 
IC = IE = ICEO = (Iph + ICO)(βo + 1) ~ βo Iph. 
(16)
The I-V characteristics of a phototransistor under different light intensities are similar to those of the bipolar 
transistor, except the base incremental current is replaced with increasing light intensities. Equation 16 indicates 
a photocurrent gain of (βo+1). In practical homojunction phototransistors, gains vary from 50 to a few hundred. 
The heterojunction phototransistor, whose emitter has a larger energy gap than base, can have advantages similar 
to that of a regular heterojunction bipolar transistor. Gains up to 10,000 can be obtained. Unfortunately, the dark 
current is also amplified by the same factor. 
This device is particularly useful in opto-isolator applications because it offers high current-transfer ratios, 
i.e., the ratio of output photodetector current to the input light-source (LED or laser) current, of the order of 50% 
or more, as compared to a typical photodiode with a current-transfer ratio of 0.2%.
10.1.7 Heterojunction Photodiode
A heterojunction device is formed by depositing a large-bandgap semiconductor epitaxially on a smaller-bandgap 
semiconductor. One advantage of a heterojunction photodiode is that the quantum efficiency does not depend 
critically on the distance of the junction from the surface, because the large-bandgap material can be used as 
a window for the transmission of optical power. In addition, the heterojunction can provide unique material 
combinations so that the quantum efficiency and response speed can be optimized for a given optical-signal 
wavelength.
    To obtain a heterojunction with low leakage current, the lattice constants of the two semiconductors must be 
closely matched. Ternary III-V compounds AlxGa1-xAs epitaxially grown on GaAs can form heterojunctions with 
perfectly matched lattices. These heterojunctions are important for photonic devices operated in the wavelength 
range from 0.65 to 0.85 m. At longer wavelengths (1 to 1.6 m), ternary compounds such as Ga0.47In0.53As (with 
Eg = 0.75 eV) and quaternary compounds such as Ga0.27In0.73As0.63P0.37 (with Eg = 0.95 eV) can be used. These 
compounds have a nearly perfect lattice match to the InP substrate. This device has superior performance to the 
Ge photodiode because of the direct bandgap, which gives rise to a larger absorption coefficient, so that a thinner 
depletion width can be used to give a higher response speed. The quantum efficiency is greater than 70% over the 
wavelength range from 1 to 1.6 m, as shown in Fig. 2 (GaInAs curve).
10.1.8 Superlattice APD
As mentioned before, the APD exhibits excess noise from the random nature of the avalanche multiplication 
process. This avalanche noise is minimized when only the electron is involved. Figure 9a shows the energy band 
diagram of a staircase superlattice APD to achieve only electron avalanche multiplication.3 The energy band 
gap of each layer changes from a minimum Eg1 to a maximum Eg2 that is more than twice Eg1. The ΔEC in the 
conduction band between two neighboring layers is larger than Eg1.
    Under bias, as shown in Fig. 9b, the photogenerated electrons drift in the graded layer conduction band and 
then drift into the neighboring layer; they will have kinetic energy ΔEC as a result of the transition and ΔEC (> Eg1) 
is sufficiently high to cause the impact ionization there. Therefore, the device does not need the high field typical 
of avalanche multiplication in a bulk semiconductor. The impact ionized holes experience only a small ΔEV that is 
insufficient to cause impact ionization. The staircase superlattice APD exhibits low avalanche noise. However, the 
staircase superlattice APD is difficult to fabricate due to the graded bandgap.

10.1.9 Quantum-Well Infrared Photodetector
The quantum-well infrared photodetector (QWIP) is based on photoconductivity due to intersubband excitation.1 
The infrared absorption of QWIP is within the conduction band or the valence band, instead of band-to-band, 
in a quantum well. The three types of transitions are depicted in Fig. 10. In the bound-to-bound transition, two 
quantized energy states are confined and below the barrier energy. A photon excites an electron from the ground 
state to the first bound state and the electron subsequently tunnels out of the well. In the bound-to-continuum (or 
bound-to-extended) excitation, the first state above the ground state is over the barrier and excited electrons can 
escape the well more easily. This bound-to-continuum excitation is more promising in that it has higher absorption, 
broader wavelength response, lower dark current, and higher detectivity, and requires lower voltage. In the bound-
to-miniband transition, a miniband is present because of the superlattice structure. QWIPs based on this have 
shown great promise for focal-plane array-imaging sensor system applications.
The structure of a QWIP using a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure is shown in Fig. 11. The quantum-well 
layers, in this case GaAs, have a thickness of about 5 nm and are usually doped to n-type in the 1017 cm-3 range. 
The barrier layers are undoped and have thickness in the range of 30-50 nm. A typical number of periods is 
between 20 and 50.
For quantum wells formed by direct-bandgap materials, the incident light normal to the surface has zero 
absorption because intersubband transitions require that the electric field of the electromagnetic wave has 
components normal to the quantum-well plane. This polarization selection rule demands techniques to couple 
light to the light-sensitive area. In Fig. 11a, a polished 45o-facet is made at the edge adjacent to the detector. Notice 
that the wavelength of interest is transparent to the substrate. In Fig. 11b, a grating on the top surface refracts light 
back to the detector. Alternatively, a grating can be made on the substrate surface to scatter the incoming light.

intersubband transition. (b) Bound-to-continuum transition. (c) Bound-to-miniband transition.1

angle. (a) Light incident normal to a polished facet makes a 45o angle to the quantum well. (b) A grating is used to 
refract light coming from the substrate.1
The QWIP is an attractive alternative for long-wavelength photodetectors that use HgCdTe material, which 
has problems of excessive tunneling of dark current and reproducibility of the precise composition required 
to produce the exact energy gap. Moreover, the QWIP is compatible with GaAs technology and circuits for 
monolithic integration. The detection wavelength range can also be tuned by the quantum-well thickness, and 
the long-wavelength capability can be close to 20 μm. It has high speed and fast response due to its intrinsic short 
carrier lifetime in the quantum wells. One difficulty with the QWIP, at least for n-type GaAs wells, is the detection 
of normal-incidence light.
 
10.2 SOLAR CELLS
Solar cells are useful for both space and terrestrial applications. Solar cells furnish the long-duration power supply 
for satellites. The solar cell is an important candidate for an alternative terrestrial energy source because it converts 
sunlight directly to electricity with good conversion efficiency, provides nearly permanent power at low operating 
cost, and is virtually nonpolluting.4,5
10.2.1 Solar Radiation
The radiative energy output from the sun derives from a nuclear fusion reaction. Every second, about 6 × 1011 
kg hydrogen is converted to helium, with a net mass loss of about 4 × 103 kg. The mass loss is converted through 
the Einstein relation (E = mc2) to 4 × 1020 J. This energy is emitted primarily as electromagnetic radiation in the 
ultraviolet to infrared region (0.2 to 3 m). The total mass of the sun is now about 2 × 1030 kg, and a reasonably 
stable life with a nearly constant radiative-energy output of over 10 billion (1010) years is projected.
The intensity of solar radiation outside the earth’s atmosphere, at the average distance of its orbit around the 
sun, is defined as the solar constant and has a value of 1367 W/m2. Terrestrially, the sunlight is attenuated by clouds 
and by atmospheric scattering and absorption. The attenuation depends primarily on the length of the light’s path 
through the atmosphere, or the mass of air through which it passes. This “air mass” is defined as l/cos ϕ, where ϕ is 
the angle between the vertical and the sun’s position.
 EXAMPLE 4
The air mass can most easily be estimated from the length of the shadow, s, of a vertical structure of height h, as

We have an air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5). The corresponding cos ϕ is 1/1.5 = 0.667 and the angle ϕ between the vertical 
and the sun’s position is cos-l (0.667) = 48o. The maximum sunlight intensity occurs when the sun is straight 
overhead (i.e., AM 1.0 with ϕ = 0o). 
Figure 12 shows two curves related to solar spectral irradiance (power per unit area per unit wavelength).6 
The upper curve, which represents the solar spectrum outside the Earth’s atmosphere, is the air mass zero 
condition (AM0). The AM0 spectrum is relevant for satellite and space vehicle applications. Terrestrial solar-
cell performance is specified with reference to the air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) spectrum. This spectrum represents the 
sunlight at the Earth’s surface when the sun is at an angle of 48o from the vertical. At this angle the incident power 
is about 963 W/m2.     
10.2.2 p-n Junction Solar Cell
A schematic representation of a p-n junction solar cell is shown in Fig. 13. It consists of a shallow p-n junction 
formed on the surface, a front ohmic contact stripe and fingers, a back ohmic contact that covers the entire back 
surface, and an antireflection coating on the front surface. The surface reflection of the incident light from air  
( n  = 1) into semiconductor silicon ( n = 3.5) is about 0.31. This means that 31% of incident light is reflected and is 
not available for conversion to electrical energy in a silicon solar cell.   
When the cell is exposed to the solar spectrum, a photon that has an energy less than the bandgap Eg makes 
no contribution to the cell output. A photon that has energy greater than Eg contributes an energy Eg to the 
cell output. Energy greater than Eg is wasted as heat. When EHPs are created in the depletion layer, they are 
separated by the built-in electric field. Hence, the potential difference is limited by the built-in voltage, which is in 
turn determined by the energy gap. On the other hand, only photons with energies larger than the bandgap are 
absorbed in a semiconductor, and hence the light-generated current decreases with the increase in energy gap due 
to the limited solar spectrum.

To derive the conversion efficiency, we consider the energy band diagram of a p-n junction, shown in Fig. 14a, 
under solar radiation. We can see that VOC depends on the light intensity. The efficiency does not depend critically 
on the bandgap. Semiconductors with bandgaps between 1 and 2 eV can all be considered solar cell materials. The 
equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 14b, where a constant-current source is in parallel with the junction. The source 
IL results from the excitation of excess carriers by solar radiation, Is is the diode saturation current, and RL is the 
load resistance.

T = 300 K. The curve passes through the fourth quadrant, and therefore power can be extracted from the device. 
The I-V curve is more generally represented by Fig. 15b, which is an inversion of Fig. 15a about the voltage axis. A 
load RL is connected to the solar cell as shown in Fig. 14b. The current through the RL is in the opposite direction 
to the conventional current flow. Thus, 
 
I =−V/RL 
(18)
This current and the current in the circuit must satisfy both the I-V characteristics of the solar cell Eq. 17 and that 
of the load Eq. 18 simultaneously. The load line with slope -1/ RL is shown in Fig. 15a. The intersection point is 
the operating point at which the load and the solar cell have the same current and voltage. By choosing a proper 
load, close to 80% of the product ISC VOC can be extracted, where ISC is the short-circuit current and VOC  is the 
open-circuit voltage of the cell; the shaded area in the figure is the maximum-power rectangle. Also defined in Fig. 
15b are the quantities Im and Vm that correspond to the current and voltage, respectively, for the maximum power

. In practice, a good fill factor is around 0.8. To maximize the efficiency, we should maximize all three 
items in the numerator of Eq. 23a. 
The ideal efficiency can be obtained from the ideal I-V characteristics defined by Eq. 17. For a given 
semiconductor, the saturation current density is obtained from Eq. 17a. For a given air mass condition (e.g., AM 
1.5), the short-circuit current IL is the product of q and the number of the available photons with energy hν   Eg 
in the solar spectrum. Once IS and IL are known, the output power P and the maximum power Pm can be obtained 
from Eqs. 20 through 22. The input power Pin is the integration of all the photons in the solar spectrum (Fig. 
12). Under AM 1.5 condition, the efficiency Pm/Pin has a broad maximum5,7 of about 29% and does not depend 
critically on Eg. Therefore, semiconductors with bandgap between 1 and 2 eV can all be considered as solar cell 
materials. Many factors degrade the ideal efficiency, so that efficiencies actually achieved are lower. The ideal peak 
efficiency is 31% for one sun and 37% for 1000 suns. 1,7
Spectrum Splitting 
The simplest way to improve the efficiency is by spectrum splitting. By splitting sunlight into narrow wavelength 
bands and directing each band to a cell that has a bandgap optimally chosen to convert just this band, as shown 
in Fig. 16a, efficiency above 60% is in principle possible.8 Fortunately, simply stacking cells on top of one another 
with the highest bandgap cell uppermost, as in Fig. 16b, automatically achieves an identical spectral-splitting 
effect, making this “tandem” cell approach a reasonably practical way of increasing cell efficiency.

Fig. 17 Current-voltage characteristics and the equivalent circuit of solar cells that have resistances.
Series Resistance and Recombination Current
Many factors degrade the ideal efficiency. One of the major factors is the series resistance Rs from the ohmic loss 
in the front surface. As shown in Fig. 13, the photogenerated electrons traverse the n-layer to the finger electrodes 
and introduce an effective series resistance. If the finger electrodes are thin, the series resistance will be further 
increased. There is also a series resistance in the p-region, but it is generally small due to the bulky volume. On the 
other hand, a shunt resistance will also be present because a fraction (usually small) of the photogenerated carriers 
can flow through the crystal surface (or through grain boundaries in polycrystalline devices) instead of through 
the external load. Typically the shunt resistance is less important than the series resistance. The equivalent circuit is 
shown in Fig. 17. From the ideal diode current given by Eq. 17, the I-V characteristics are found to be

A plot of this equation is shown in Fig. 17, with Rs = 0 and 5 Ω and where the other parameters Is, IL, and T are 
the same as those in Fig. 15. It can be seen that a series resistance of only 5 Ω reduces the available power to less 
than 30% of the maximum power with Rs = 0. The output current and output power are

The series resistance depends on the junction depth, the impurity concentrations of p-type and n-type regions, 
and the arrangement of the front-surface ohmic contacts. For a typical silicon solar cell with the geometry shown 
in Fig. 13, the series resistance is about 0.7 Ω for n+-p cells and 0.4 Ω for p+-n cells. The difference in resistance is 
mainly the result of the lower resistivity in n-type substrates.
Another factor is the recombination current in the depletion region. For single-level centers, the 
recombination current can be expressed as

similar to Eqs. 19 through 22, with the exception that Is is replaced by Is
'  and the exponential factor is divided 
by 2. The efficiency for the recombination current case is found to be much less than the ideal current due to the 
degradation of both VOC and the fill factor. For silicon solar cells at 300 K, the recombination current can cause a 
25% reduction in efficiency.
 
10.3  SILICON AND COMPOUND-SEMICONDUCTOR SOLAR CELLS
The main requirements for solar cells are high efficiency, low cost, and good reliability. Many solar-cell 
configurations have been proposed and demonstrated with impressive results. However, for solar cells to supply 
a significant portion of world energy, more challenges are still ahead. Nevertheless, we believe that the goal is 
achievable. We consider a few key solar-cell designs and their performances. In general, there are two categories of 
solar cells: wafer-based and thin-film solar cells.
10.3.1 Wafer-Based Solar Cells
Silicon is the most important semiconductor for solar cells. It is nontoxic and is second only to oxygen in 
prevalence in the earth’s crust. Therefore, silicon poses minimal environmental or resource-depletion risks if used 
on a large scale. It also has a well established technological base because of its use in microelectronics.
III-V compound semiconductors and their alloy systems provide wide choices of bandgaps with closely 
matched lattice constants. These compounds are ideal for producing tandem solar cells. For example, AlGaAs/
GaAs, GaInP/GaAs, and GaInAs/InP material systems have been developed for solar cells in satellite and space 
vehicle applications.
Silicon PERL Cell
Usually, short-circuit current losses come from metal-finger coverage of the top surface, top-surface reflection 
loss, and imperfect light trapping in the cell. The voltage losses arise from finite surface and bulk recombination. 
The fill factor losses come not only from ohmic series resistance loss within the cell, but also from the same factors 
producing the open-circuit voltage loss. The silicon passivated emitter and rear locally-diffused (PERL) cell9 shown 
in Fig. 18a is a solar cell design taking all those loss factors into account. 
The cell has inverted pyramids on the top that are formed by using anisotropic etches to expose the slowly 
etching (111) crystallographic planes. The pyramids reduce reflections of light incident on the top surface, 
since incident light perpendicular to the cell will strike one of the inclined (111) planes obliquely and will be 
refracted obliquely into the cell. This enhanced light trapping reduces the short-circuit current loss.
The cell is characterized by the use of a thin, thermally grown oxide to “passivate” (reduce the electronic 
activity of) the top surface of Si wafer for a junction diffusion. Then, a shallow, low-sheet-resistivity phosphorus 
diffusion n-layer is formed. The oxide passivation of the cell surfaces can improve the open-circuit voltage. It can 
also function as an antireflection coating with refractive index n = 1.46 to further reduce the total reflection. The 
rear locally diffused region is formed in the area of the rear point contact.
Photodetectors and Solar Cells 343

(b)
Fig. 18 (a) Passivated emitter rear locally diffused (PERL) cell.9 (b) Energy-band diagram for the back-surface field.
The incorporation of a heavily doped layer under the back contact, a so-called “back-surface field,” is shown 
in Fig. 18b. The potential energy q
p
$  provides a minority carrier-reflecting region between this contact and the 
substrate. The back surface field also results in a very small recombination velocity at the back. Therefore, the 
short-circuit current will increase. The open-circuit voltage is also increased due to the increased short-circuit 
current. It also reduces the contact resistance and improves the fill factor. The rear contact is separated from the 
silicon by an intervening oxide layer. This gives much better rear reflection than an aluminum layer. To date, the 
PERL cell shows the highest conversion efficiency of 24.7%.
III-V Compound Tandem Solar Cell  
A major factor limiting conversion efficiency in single bandgap cells to 31% is that the absorbed photon energy 
above the semiconductor band gap is lost as heat. The main approach to reducing this efficiency loss is to use 
tandem p-n junctions in which higher-bandgap semiconductors and lower-bandgap semiconductors are connected 
together with a p+-n+ tunneling diode. Higher-energy photons are absorbed in the higher-bandgap semiconductors 
and lower-energy photons in the lower-bandgap semiconductors with band gaps better matched to the solar 
spectrum, and the overall heat loss is reduced. Stacking dozens of different cells together can theoretically increase 
efficiency to 68%. But this results in technical problems such as strain damages to the crystal layers. The most 
efficient multi-junction solar cell is one that has three cells. 
Figure 19 shows the structure of a monolithic tandem solar cell.1 A p-type germanium, which has a lattice 
constant very close to that of GaAs and Ga0.51In0.49P, is used as the substrate. The top junction is the GaInP 
junction (Eg = 1.9 eV), which can absorb photons with energy hν > 1.9 eV. The bottom junction is the GaAs p-n 
junction (Eg = 1.42 eV), which can absorb photons with energy 1.9 eV > hν > 1.42 eV. A tunneling p+-n+ GaAs 
junction is placed between the top and bottom junctions to connect the cells. A p-AlGaInP layer is grown below 
the top junction to form a high-low junction p-AlGaInP/p-GaInP, and a p-GaInP layer is grown below the bottom 
junction to form a high-low junction p-GaInP/p-GaAs. They also function as a “back surface field,” as mentioned 
above. The potential energy barrier qϕp for the back surface field can be higher for heterojunctions than that for 
p-p+ homojunctions and drives minority carriers (electrons) back in the lower bandgap region of the high-low 
junction. There is a window at the top of each cell. A narrow layer of a wide bandgap semiconductor serves as 
a window, n-AlInP for the top cell and n-GaInP for the bottom cell, for the sunlight that reaches the narrow-gap 
semiconductor with little loss. These layers can passivate the surface defects normally present in a homojunction 
cell, thereby overcoming the surface recombination and improving cell efficiency. The window layer is typically 
very heavily doped.

Fig. 19 Monolithic tandem solar cell.1
It has a higher built-in voltage and hence a higher open-circuit voltage, and a higher cell efficiency. High 
doping also reduces the parasitic series resistance. Similar InGaP/GaAs/InGaAs 3-junction cells grown on a Ge 
substrate show a higher efficiency. Tandem solar cells with efficiency as high as 40% have been obtained.10
10.3.2 Thin-Film Solar Cells
The biggest problem with the conventional Si solar cell is cost. It requires a relatively thick layer of single 
crystalline silicon in order to have reasonable photon capture rates, and such silicon is an expensive commodity. 
The thin-film solar cell can provide a lower-cost alternate approach.
Amorphous Si Solar Cell
Amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films can be deposited directly on low-cost large-area substrates. In amorphous 
silicon, the distribution of bond lengths and bond angles disturb the long-range order of the crystalline silicon 
lattice and change the optical and electronic properties. The optical energy gap increases from 1.12 eV of single 
crystalline silicon to about 1.7 eV. Due to internal scattering, the apparent optical absorption is nearly an order of 
magnitude higher than the crystalline material.
The basic cell structure for a series interconnected a-Si solar cells is shown11 in Fig. 20. A layer of SiO2 
followed by a transparent conducting layer of a large bandgap, degenerately doped semiconductor such as SnO2 
is deposited onto a glass substrate and patterned using a laser. The substrate is then coated by a p-i-n junction 
stack of amorphous silicon by the decomposition of silane in a radio-frequency plasma-discharge system. After 
deposition, the a-Si layers are patterned by a laser system. A layer of aluminum is sputtered onto the rest of the 
silicon and this layer is also patterned by laser. This technique forms a series of interconnected cells, as shown in 
Fig. 20. The cell has the lowest manufacturing cost but a modest efficiency of 6%. 
Photodetectors and Solar Cells 345

Fig. 20 Series-interconnected a-Si solar cells deposited on a glass substrate with a rear glass cover bonded using 
ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA).11
The amorphous silicon obtained by this process is incorporated with a fairly large concentration of hydrogen. 
The hydrogen atoms tie up dangling silicon bonds and decrease the density of localized states in the energy gap. 
These localized states play a dominate role in determining the carrier transport properties of amorphous silicon. 
The typical deposition temperature is below 300 °C, otherwise no hydrogen is incorporated in the film. 
Due to the low carrier mobilities, the collection of photogenerated carriers has to be supported by an internal 
electrical field. To create a high field in the intrinsic layer of the p-i-n structure the cells have to be thin, of the order 
of a few hundred nanometers. For the p-i-n structure, the p- and n-doped layers are generally kept very thin (< 50 
nm), since material quality decreases significantly as the doping level increases, and hence very few of the carriers 
generated in these layers contribute to photocurrent. However, these doped layers do establish an electric field in 
the better-quality i-layer (~ 0.5 μm thick), which aids the collection of carriers generated in this region.
In larger outdoor “power” modules, the beneficial effect of the hydrogen upon the amorphous-Si properties 
deteriorates under illumination. A steady drop of output efficiency occurs over the first few months. The stability 
problem is caused by the so called “Staebler-Wronski” degradation—the illumination by light with photon energies 
larger than the energy gap leads to new light-induced defect states. After that, the output stabilizes. Amorphous-Si-
based modules are generally rated by manufacturers in terms of such “stabilized” output.
An improvement in efficiency can be achieved by utilizing tandem cells. High-quality a-Si:Ge:H alloys 
can be used as the narrow bandgap material. The bandgap of a-Si incorporated with Ge is reduced to about 
1.5 eV. Therefore, we can fabricate higher efficiency a-Si:H /a-Si:Ge:H tandem cells with better collection of the 
red portion of the solar spectrum. A stabilized efficiency around 8% for large-area modules was obtained with 
these cells. A stabilized efficiency above 13% was obtained using a triple junction with the top cell consisting of 
a layer of a-Si:H and the bottom two cells having increased thicknesses and containing increasing percentage of 
germanium.5,12 But the corresponding process gas GeH4 contributes substantially to the cost of the module.
One promising microcrystalline tandem solar cell with much higher efficiency (14.5%) than the amorphous 
type has been developed.13,14 The structure shown in Fig. 21a consists of a microcrystalline bottom cell (μc-Si:H) 
and a conventional amorphous top cell in tandem. The optical energy gap of μc-Si:H is somewhere around 1 eV, 
which is close to that of crystalline Si and very different from that of a-Si:H (1.7 eV).
The short-wavelength light is absorbed by the top amorphous cell and long-wavelength light is absorbed by 
the bottom microcrystalline cell. The spectral sensitivity of the microcrystalline tandem solar cell in Fig. 21b shows 
higher efficiency because the microcrystalline cell absorbs the long-wavelength light that cannot be absorbed by the 
amorphous silicon. Compared with a-Si:H /a-Si:Ge:H tandem cells, the spectral response of the a-Si:H/μc-Si:H

tandem cell is strongly extended towards longer wavelengths. Because the microcrystalline Si has a lower optical-
absorption coefficient than the amorphous type, the thickness of the i-layer of the microcrystalline solar cell needs 
to be much greater than the amorphous solar cell.
CIGS Solar Cell 
In 1974, Bell Telephone Laboratories reported the first copper indium diselenide (CuInSe2) solar cell with 
a conversion efficiency of 6%. In 1982, the CdS/CuInSe2 solar cell with a conversion efficiency of 10% was 
developed. With indium partially replaced by gallium in CuInSe2 to form the copper indium gallium diselenide 
(CIGS), the new material has larger optical bandgap than pure CIS, thus increasing the open-circuit voltage. The 
conversion efficiency of CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) was raised to 15% in 1993, to 17.7% in 1996, to 19.2% in 2003, 
5,15 and to 19.9 % in 2008.16 
The CIS is a direct bandgap semiconductor material and its absorption coefficient is higher over a broader 
wavelength range than other semiconductors, as shown in Fig. 22a.17 The bandgap of CIGS can vary continuously 
from about 1.0 eV (for CuInSe2) to about 1.7 eV (for CuGaSe2). A typical structure of CIGS solar cell is shown 
in Fig. 22b. The soda-lime glass [the most prevalent type of glass prepared with sodium carbonate (soda), 
limestone, etc.] was used as the substrate. Na ions in soda-lime glass will diffuse through Mo into CIGS during 
growth, and the grain of polycrystalline CIGS can grow larger with fewer defects. Sodium not only improves 
crystallization of the film but also increases conductivity due to the sodium incorporated at grain boundaries or 
defects. The mechanism is still not clear. Mo with high reflectivity and low resistivity forms good ohmic contact 
with CIGS. P-type CIGS absorbs most of the light and has been deposited using various methods, including 
co-evaporation, reactive sputtering sublimation, chemical bath deposition, laser evaporation, and spray pyrolysis. 
The p-n heterojunction is formed by depositing a very thin n-type CdS and an n-type transparent conducting 
oxide ZnO (ZnO:Al). CdS is used to modify the CIGS sensitive surface and lower the band discontinuity between 
ZnO and CIGS. ZnS may replace CdS due to environmental concerns. The direct deposition of ZnO on CdS will 
induce local defects (such as pin holes) and local fluctuations in CIGS properties (e.g., bandgap). An intrinsic ZnO 
(i-ZnO) buffer layer would decrease these problems. MgF2 is used as an anti-reflection coating. CIGS-based solar 
cells are presently one of the best candidates for a new generation of large-scale, low-cost thin-film photovoltaic 
systems.

10.4 THIRD-GENERATION SOLAR CELLS
The third generation photovoltaic cell is a range of novel alternatives to “first generation” (silicon single-crystal 
p-n junction or wafer solar cells) and “second generation” (low-cost, but low-efficiency thin-film) cells. Research 
and development in this area generally aim to provide higher efficiency and lower cost per watt of electricity 
generated.18
Dye-sensitized Solar Cells
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are currently the most efficient third-generation solar technology available and 
are ready for mass production.19 The cell in Fig. 23a has a layer of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) [usually 
fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2:F)] deposited on glass used as anode. On the conductive plate is a layer of titanium 
dioxide (TiO2), formed into a highly porous 3-D structure with an extremely high surface area for holding large 
numbers of dye molecules. The plate is then immersed in a mixture of a photosensitive ruthenium-polypyridine 
dye solution. The dye molecules are quite small (nanometer sized). In order to capture a reasonable amount of the 
incoming light, the layer of dye molecules covalently bonded on highly porous 3-D nano-structured TiO2 surface 
needs to be fairly thick. A separate backing is made with a thin layer of the iodide/iodine electrolyte spread over a 
conductive platinum sheet. 
The bulk of the semiconductor (TiO2) is used solely for charge transport; the photoelectrons are provided 
from a separate photosensitive dye. Charge separation occurs at the surfaces between the dye, semiconductor, and 
electrolyte. Photons with enough energy will create an excited state of the dye, as shown in Fig. 23b. An excited 
electron in the conduction band has a probability to go back to valence band of the dye as the loss path 1. The 
excited electron can be injected directly into the conduction band of the TiO2, and from there it moves by diffusion 
to the anode. Meanwhile, the dye molecule strips one electron from iodide in electrolyte, oxidizing it into triiodide. 
348 Semiconductors

(b)
Fig. 23 (a) DSSC cell structure. (b) Energy band diagram and main carrier losses. 
This reaction occurs quite quickly compared to the time for the injected electron to recombine with the oxidized 
dye molecule, which is the loss path 2 shown in Fig. 23b. The triiodide then recovers its missing electron by 
diffusing to the counter-electrode, which reintroduces the electrons after flowing through the external circuit. The 
third loss is from the recombination of injected electron with the electrolyte (path 3).
Due to the porosity of the TiO2 nanostructure, there is a very high chance that a photon will be absorbed. 
The dye is highly efficient in converting photons into electrons, but only those electrons with enough energy 
can cross the TiO2 bandgap and result in photocurrent. In addition, the electrolyte limits the speed at which the 
dye molecules can regain their electrons and become available for photoexcitation again. These factors limit the 
photocurrent generated by a DSSC. The bandgap is slightly larger than silicon, which means that fewer of the 
photons in sunlight can be used for carrier generation. The maximum voltage generated, in theory, is simply the 
difference between the Fermi level of the TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte, about 0.7 V (Voc). DSSCs 
offer slightly higher Voc than the silicon solar cell (about 0.6 V). The fill factor is about 70%, and the quantum 
efficiency is about 11%.20
Organic Solar Cells
Carrier mobilities are very low because their transport processes are dominated by carrier hopping in organic 
semiconductors, as mentioned in Sec. 9.3.2 of Chapter 9, and therefore the thicknesses of organic active layers 
in organic solar cells are limited to a few hundred nanometers for lower series resistance. However, organic 
semiconductors show strong absorption in UV and visible regions and the penetration depth of the incident 
light is typically 80-200 nm. Thus, only a 100 nm thick organic active layer is sufficient for effective absorption. 
Currently, the power conversion efficiency is only 5.7 %,21 but organic solar cells attract high interest due to their 
large-area, low-cost potential.
Photodetectors and Solar Cells 349

Due to electrostatic interactions, the EHP upon absorption of a photon of sufficient energy forms a 
tightly bound state exciton, whose binding energy is expected to be in a range of 200 ~ 500 meV. The exciton 
binding energy is roughly one order of magnitude larger than that for inorganic semiconductors like Si, where 
photoexcitations typically lead directly to free carriers at room temperature. In general, only 10% of the excitons 
dissociate into free carriers, while the remaining excitons decay via radiative or nonradiative recombination 
pathways after a short time. Thus, the energy efficiencies of single-layer polymer solar cells typically remain below 
0.1%.
Solar cells with a heterojunction between donor and acceptor molecules can efficiently dissociate 
photogenerated excitons into free carriers at the interface and exhibit superior performances. After photo-
excitation of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO shown in Fig. 24, the electron can jump from the LUMO 
of the donor (with the higher LUMO) to the LUMO of the acceptor if the potential difference ΔΦ between the 
ionization potential of the donor and the electron affinity of the acceptor is larger than the exciton binding energy. 
However, this process of so-called photo-induced charge transfer can lead to free charges only if the hole remains 
on the donor with the higher HOMO level. Moreover, the space between donor and acceptor should be in the 
range of the exciton diffusion length for efficient transfer and dissociation. A heterojunction can be prepared with 
donor and acceptor bilayers shown in Fig. 25a. This bilayer geometry guarantees directional photoinduced charge 
transfer across the interface, and the recombination losses are reduced. However, the interfacial area and thus 
the exciton dissociation efficiency are limited. Higher interfacial area and thus the improved exciton dissociation 
efficiency can be achieved if a mixture layer contains both electron donor and electron acceptor (so-called bulk 
heterojunctions) shown in Fig. 25b, but needs a percolating pathway for the separated charge carriers to reach their 
corresponding electrodes. Both approaches can be carried out either by sublimation of small molecules or by spin-
coating of polymers.

Quantum Dot Solar Cells
As mentioned above, one way of increasing the conversion efficiency is to utilize tandem or cascaded solar cells 
that use two or more solar cells to increase the number of photons absorbed from the incident light. 
Another approach to increasing the conversion efficiency is to utilize the hot carriers before they relax to the 
band edge via phonon emission.22,23 There are two fundamental ways of doing this: one is to extract hot carriers 
before they cool to enhance the photovoltage, the other is to utilize the energetic hot carriers to produce secondary 
(or more) EHPs through impact ionization to enhance the photocurrent.
The crucial point is to retard the relaxation of photogenerated carriers. Usually the energy of hot carriers is 
lost by multiphonon processes and heat is dissipated in the semiconductor. When the carriers in the semiconductor 
are confined by potential barriers in regions that are smaller than or comparable to their deBroglie wavelength or 
to the Bohr radius of excitons in the semiconductor bulk, i.e., in semiconductor quantum wells, quantum wires, 
and especially quantum dots (QDs), the relaxation of photogenerated carriers, especially hot carriers, may be 
markedly reduced by quantization effects in the semiconductor, and the rate of impact ionization can approach the 
rate of carrier cooling. 
In order to achieve the former approach, the rates of photogenerated carrier separation, transport, and 
interfacial transfer across the contacts to the semiconductor must all be large compared to the rate of carrier 
cooling, as shown in Fig. 26a. In this configuration, the QDs are formed into an ordered 3-D array with inter-QD 
spacing sufficiently small so that strong electronic coupling occurs and minibands are formed to allow long-range 
electron transport. The QD array is placed in the intrinsic region of a p+-i-n+ structure. The delocalized quantized 
3-D miniband states could be expected to slow down the carrier cooling and permit the transport and collection of 
hot carriers at their respective p and n contacts to produce a higher photopotential in a solar cell.
The latter approach requires that the rate of impact ionization be greater than the rates of carrier cooling 
and other relaxation processes for hot carriers, as shown in Fig. 26b. Unlike bulk semiconductors, QDs possess 
a unique ability to generate multiple pairs of charge carriers with a single high-energy photon. In conventional 
bulk semiconductors, a single EHP is generated per absorbed photon. This means that both high- and low-energy 
photons create only a single pair of charge carriers (electron and hole). More simply, the extra energy of near-UV 
photons is not utilized fully when using bulk semiconductor films. In QDs, however, high-energy photons can 
produce multiple charge carriers by a process known as impact ionization, setting the stage for achieving photon-
conversion efficiencies greater than 100%.

Fig. 27 Efficiency, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor versus solar concentration.1
However, hot-electron transport/collection and impact ionization cannot occur simultaneously; they are 
mutually exclusive and only one of these processes can be present in a given system. The QD solar cells not only 
promise high power-conversion efficiencies, but also offer spectral tunability, because the absorption properties 
of semiconductor quantum dots are size-dependent. QD solar cells have the potential to increase the maximum 
conversion efficiency up to 66%. 
 
10.5 OPTICAL CONCENTRATION
Sunlight can be focused by using mirrors and lenses. Optical concentration offers an attractive and flexible 
approach to reducing high cell costs by substituting a concentrator area for much of the cell area. It also offers 
other advantages, such as a 20% increase in efficiency for a concentration of 1000 suns (an intensity of 963 × l03 
W/m2). Figure 27 shows the measured results of a typical silicon solar cell mounted in a concentrated system.1 
Note that device performances improve as the concentration increases from one sun toward 1000 suns. The short-
circuit current density increases linearly with concentration. The open-circuit voltage increases at a rate of 0.1 V 
per decade, while the fill factor varies slightly. The efficiency, which is the product of the foregoing three factors 
divided by the input power, increases at a rate of about 2% per decade. With a proper antireflection coating, we 
project an efficiency increase of 30% at 1000 suns. Therefore, one cell operated under 1000-sun concentration can 
produce the same power output as 1300 cells under one sun. Potentially, the optical concentration approach can 
replace expensive solar cells with less expensive concentrator materials and a related tracking and heat-removal 
system to minimize the overall system cost.
 
SUMMARY
The operation of photodetectors and solar cells depends upon the absorption of photons. Photons are absorbed 
to create charge carriers. Photodetectors include photoconductors, photodiodes avalanche photodiodes 
phototransistor and etc.. They can convert optical signals into electrical signals. When photons are absorbed, 
EHPs are generated in the device that are subsequently separated by an electrical field to produce a photo-current 
flowing between the electrodes. Photodetectors are used for optical sensing and detection in opto-isolators and 
optical-fiber communication systems.
352 Semiconductors

A solar cell is similar to a photodiode and has the same operational principle. However, the solar cell 
differs from a photodiode in that it is a large-area device and covers a wide range of the optical spectrum (solar 
radiation). Solar cells furnish the long-duration power supply for satellites. The solar cell is a major candidate 
for a terrestrial energy source because it can convert sunlight directly to electricity with good efficiency and is 
environmentally benign. Currently, the important solar cells are the highly efficient silicon PERL cell (24%), the 
GaInP/GaAs tandem cell (30%), and the low-cost thin-film microcrystalline a-Si solar cell (15%) and CIGS solar 
cell (19.8%). The next target for the solar cells is generally to provide higher efficiency and lower cost per watt of 
electricity generated. These so-called third-generation photovoltaic cells are under research and development.

SUMMARY
As discussed in Chapter 1, the two most important semiconductors for discrete devices and integrated circuits are 
silicon and gallium arsenide. In this chapter we describe the common techniques for growing single crystals of 
these two semiconductors. The starting materials, silicon dioxide for a silicon wafer and gallium and arsenic for a 
gallium arsenide wafer, are chemically processed to form a high-purity polycrystalline semiconductor from which 
single crystals are grown. The single-crystal ingots are shaped to define the diameter of the material and sawed 
into wafers. These wafers are etched and polished to provide smooth, specular surfaces on which devices will be 
made.
A technology closely related to crystal growth involves the growth of single-crystal semiconductor layers 
on a single-crystal semiconductor substrate. This is called epitaxy, from the Greek words epi (meaning “on”) 
and taxis (meaning “arrangement”). The epitaxial layer and the substrate materials may be the same, giving rise 
to homoepitaxy. For example, an n-type silicon can be grown epitaxially on an n+-silicon substrate. On the other 
hand, if the epitaxial layer and the substrate are chemically and often crystallographically different, we have 
heteroepitaxy, such as the epitaxial growth of AlxGa1–xAs on GaAs.
 
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
Basic techniques to grow silicon and GaAs single-crystal ingots.
r
Wafer-shaping steps from ingots to polished wafers.
r
Wafer characterization in term of its electrical and mechanical properties.
r
Basic techniques of epitaxy, that is, growing a single-crystal layer on a single-crystal substrate.
r
Structures and defects of lattice-matched and strained-layer epitaxial growth.
 
11.1 SILICON CRYSTAL GROWTH FROM THE MELT
The basic technique for silicon crystal growth from the melt, which is material in liquid form, is the Czochralski 
technique.1,2 The Czochralski process is the most common and most advanced method for semiconductor single 
crystal growth. The process is named after Polish scientist Jan Czochralski, who discovered the method in 1916 

while investigating the crystallization rates of metals. A substantial percentage (> 90%) of the silicon crystals 
for the semiconductor industry are prepared by the Czochralski technique and virtually all the silicon used for 
fabricating integrated circuits is prepared by this technique.
11.1.1 Starting Material
The starting material for silicon is a relatively pure form of sand (SiO2) called quartzite. This is placed in a furnace 
with various forms of carbon (coal, coke, and wood chips). Although a number of reactions take place in the 
furnace, the overall reaction is
 
SiC (solid) + SiO2 (solid) → Si (solid) + SiO (gas) + CO (gas). 
  (1)
This process produces metallurgical-grade silicon with a purity of about 98%. Next, the silicon is pulverized and 
treated with hydrogen chloride (HCl) to form trichlorosilane (SiHCl3):

(2)
The trichlorosilane is a liquid at room temperature (boiling point 32°C). Fractional distillation of the liquid 
removes the unwanted impurities. The purified SiHCl3 is then used in a hydrogen reduction reaction to prepare the 
electronic-grade silicon (EGS):
 
SiHCl3 (gas) + H2 (gas) → Si (solid) + 3HCl (gas). 
(3)
This reaction takes place in a reactor containing a resistance-heated silicon rod,that serves as the nucleation 
point for the deposition of silicon. The EGS, a polycrystalline material of high purity, is the raw material used to 
prepare device-quality, single-crystal silicon. Pure EGS generally has impurity concentrations in the parts-per-
billion range. 
11.1.2 The Czochralski Technique
The Czochralski technique uses an apparatus called a crystal puller shown in Fig. 1a. The puller has three 
main components: (a) a furnace, which includes a fused-silicon (SiO2) crucible, a graphite susceptor, a rotation 
mechanism (clockwise as shown), a heating element, and a power supply. The crucible rotates during the growth to 
prevent the formation of local hot or cold regions; (b) a crystal-pulling mechanism that includes a seed holder and 
a rotation mechanism (counter–clockwise); and (c) an ambient control that includes a gas source (such as argon to 
prevent contamination of the molten silicon), a flow control, and a exhaust system. In addition, the puller has an 
overall microprocessor-based control system to control process parameters such as temperature, crystal diameter, 
pull rate, and rotation speeds, as well as to permit programmed process steps. Also, various sensors and feedback 
loops allow the control system to respond automatically, reducing operator intervention.
In the crystal-growing process, polycrystalline silicon (EGS) is placed in the crucible shown in Fig. 1b and the 
furnace is heated above the melting temperature of silicon (1412oC). A suitably oriented seed crystal (e.g., <111>) 
is suspended over the crucible in a seed holder. The seed is inserted into the melt. Part of it melts, but the tip of 
the remaining seed crystal still touches the liquid surface. It is then slowly withdrawn from the melt, as shown 
in Fig. 1c. The molten silicon adhering to the crystal freezes or solidifies, using the crystal of the seed crystal as 
a template. Progressive freezing at the solid-liquid interface yields a large single crystal. The desired impurity 
concentration is obtained by adding impurities to the melt in the form of heavily doped silicon prior to crystal 
growth Figure 2 shows silicon ingot weight and wafer diameter will reach 450 Kg and 450 mm (18 in.) around 
2015. The relentless increase is mainly to reduce the processing cost per unit area

11.1.3 Distribution of Dopant
In crystal growth, a known amount of dopant is added to the melt to obtain the desired doping concentration in 
the grown crystal. For silicon, boron and phosphorus are the most common dopants for p- and n-type materials, 
respectively.

crystal being pulled from the melt. (Photographs courtesy of Taisil Electronic Materials Corp., Taiwan.) 
As a crystal is pulled from the melt, the doping concentration incorporated into the crystal (solid) is usually 
different from the doping concentration of the melt (liquid) at the interface. The ratio of these two concentrations 
is defined as the equilibrium segregation coefficient k0:

where Cs and Cl are, respectively, the equilibrium concentrations of the dopant in the solid and liquid near the 
interface. Table 1 lists values of k0 for the commonly used dopants for silicon. Note that most values are below 
1, which means that during growth the dopants are rejected into the melt. Consequently, the melt becomes 
progressively enriched with the dopant as the crystal grows.
Consider a crystal being grown from a melt having an initial weight M0 with an initial doping concentration 
C0 in the melt (i.e., the weight of the dopant per 1 g of melt). At a given point of growth when a crystal of weight 
M has been grown, the amount of dopant remaining in the melt (by weight) is S. For an incremental amount of 
the crystal with weight dM, the corresponding reduction in the dopant (– dS) from the melt is Cs dM, where Cs is 
the doping concentration in the crystal (by weight):
 
–dS = Cs dM.

Figure 3 illustrates the doping distribution as a function of the fraction solidified (M/ M0) for several 
segregation coefficients.3,4 As crystal growth progresses, a composition initially at k0C0 will increase continually for 
k0 < 1 and decrease continually for k0 > 1. When k0 ≅ 1, a uniform impurity distribution can be obtained.
 EXAMPLE 1
A silicon ingot that should contain 1016 boron atoms/cm3 is to be grown by the Czochralski technique. What 
concentration of boron atoms should be in the melt to give the required concentration in the ingot? If the initial 
load of silicon in the crucible is 60 kg, how many grams of boron (atomic weight 10.8) should be added? The 
density of molten silicon is 2.53 g /cm3.
SOLUTION Table 1 shows that the segregation coefficient k0 for boron is 0.8. We assume that Cs= k0Cl throughout 
the growth. Thus, the initial concentration of boron in the melt should be

11.1.4 Effective Segregation Coefficient
While the crystal is growing, dopants are constantly being rejected into the melt (for k0 < 1). If the rejection rate 
is higher than the rate at which the dopant can be transported away by diffusion or stirring, then a concentration 
gradient will be developed at the interface, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The segregation coefficient (given in Section 
11.1.3) is k0= Cs/Cl(0). We can define an effective segregation coefficient ke that is the ratio of Cs and the impurity 
concentration far away from the interface:

Consider a small, virtually stagnant layer of melt with width δ in which the only flow is that required to replace 
the crystal being withdrawn from the melt. Outside this stagnant layer, the doping concentration has a constant 
value Cl. Inside the layer, the doping concentration can be described by the continuity equation (Eq. 59) derived 
in Chapter 2. At steady state, the only significant terms are the second and third terms on the right-hand side (we 
replace np by C and μn E  by υ):

The solution of Eq. 11 is
 
C = A1e–υx/D + A2

where A1 and A2 are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions. The first boundary condition is that 
C = Cl(0) at x = 0. The second boundary condition is the conservation of the total amount of dopants; that is, the 
sum of the dopant fluxes at the interface must be zero. By considering the diffusion of dopant atoms in the melt

The doping distribution in the crystal is given by the same expression as in Eq. 9, except that k0 is replaced 
by ke. Values of ke are larger than those of k0 and can approach 1 for large values of the growth parameter υδ/D. 
Uniform doping distribution (ke → 1) in the crystal can be obtained by employing a high pull rate and low rotation 
speed (since δ is inversely proportional to the rotation speed). Another approach to achieve uniform doping 
is to add ultrapure polycrystalline silicon continuously to the melt so that the initial doping concentration is 
maintained.
 
11.2 SILICON FLOAT–ZONE PROCESS
The float–zone process can be used to grow silicon that has lower contamination than that normally obtained 
from the Czochralski technique. A schematic setup of the float-zone process is shown in Fig. 5a. A high-purity 
polycrystalline rod with a seed crystal at the bottom is held in a vertical position and rotated. The rod is enclosed 
in a quartz envelope within which an inert atmosphere (argon) is maintained. During the operation, a small zone 
(a few centimeters in length) of the crystal is kept molten by a radio-frequency heater, which is moved from the 
seed upward so that this floating zone traverses the length of the rod. The molten silicon is retained by surface

we obtain
tension between the melting and growing solid-silicon faces. As the floating zone moves upward, a single-crystal 
silicon freezes at the zone’s retreating end and grows as an extension of the seed crystal. Materials with higher 
resistivities can be obtained from the float-zone process than from the Czochralski process because it can be 
used to purify the crystal more easily. Furthermore, since no crucible is used in the float-zone process, there is no 
contamination from the crucible (as with Czochralski growth). At the present time, float-zone crystals are used 
mainly for high-power, high-voltage devices, where high-resistivity materials are required.
To evaluate the doping distribution of a float-zone process, consider the simplified model shown in Fig. 5b. 
The initial, uniform doping concentration in the rod is C0 (by weight). L is the length of the molten zone at a 
distance x along the rod, A the cross-sectional area of the rod, ρd the specific density of silicon, and S the amount 
of dopant present in the molten zone. As the zone traverses a distance dx, the amount of dopant added to it at 
its advancing end is C0ρdA dx, whereas the amount of dopant removed from it at the retreating end is ke(S dx/L), 
where ke is the effective segregation coefficient. Thus,

Figure 6 shows the doping concentration versus the solidified zone length for various values of ke.
These two crystal growth techniques can also be used to remove impurities. Comparison of Fig. 6 with Fig. 
3 shows that a single pass in the float-zone process does not produce as much purification as a single Czochralski 
growth. For example, for k0= ke = 0.1, Cs/C0 is smaller over most of the solidified ingot made by the Czochralski 
growth. However, multiple float-zone passes can be performed on a rod much more easily than a crystal can be 
grown, the end region cropped off, and regrown from the melt. Figure 7 shows the impurity distribution for an 
element with ke = 0.1 after a number of successive passes of the zone along the length of the rod.4 Note that there 
is a substantial reduction of impurity concentration in the rod after each pass. Therefore, the float-zone process is 
ideally suited for crystal purification. This process is also called the zone-refining technique, and it can provide a 
very high purity level of the raw material.

lengths.4

If it is desirable to dope the rod rather than purify it, consider the case in which all the dopants are introduced 
in the first zone (S0 = C1AρdL) and the initial concentration C0 is negligibly small. Equation 17 gives

Therefore, if kex/L is small, Cs will remain nearly constant with distance except at the end that is last to solidify.
For certain switching devices, such as high-voltage thyristors discussed in Chapter 4, large chip areas are used, 
frequently an entire wafer for a single device. This size imposes stringent requirements on the uniformity of the 
starting material.  To obtain homogeneous distribution of dopants, we use a float-zone silicon slice that has an 
average doping concentration well below the required amount. The slice is then irradiated with thermal neutrons. 
This process, called neutron irradiation, gives rise to fractional transmutation of silicon into phosphorus and dopes

The half-life of the intermediate element Si14

in conventionally doped silicon and in silicon doped by neutron irradiation.5 Note that the resistivity variations for 
the neutron-irradiated silicon are much smaller than for the conventionally doped silicon.

11.3 GaAs CRYSTAL-GROWTH TECHNIQUES
11.3.1 Starting Materials
The starting materials for the synthesis of polycrystalline gallium arsenide are elemental, chemically pure gallium 
and arsenic. Because gallium arsenide is a combination of two materials,  its  behavior  is  different  from  that  of  
a  single  material  such  as  silicon.  The behavior of a combination can be described by a phase diagram. A phase 
is a state (e.g., solid, liquid, or gaseous) in which a material may exist. A phase diagram shows the relationship 
between the two components, gallium and arsenic, as a function of temperature.
Figure 9 shows the phase diagram of the gallium-arsenic system. The abscissa represents various 
compositions of the two components in terms of atomic percent (lower scale) or weight percent (upper scale).6,7 
Consider a melt that is initially of composition x (e.g., 85 atomic percent arsenic shown in Fig. 9). When the 
temperature is lowered, its composition will remain fixed until the liquidus line is reached. At the point (T1, x), 
material of 50 atomic percent arsenic (i.e., gallium arsenide) will begin to solidify. 
 EXAMPLE 2
In Fig. 9, consider a melt of initial composition Cm (weight percent scale) that is cooled from T a (on the liquidus 
line) to Tb. Find the fraction of the melt that will be solidified.
SOLUTION At Tb, Ml is the weight of the liquid, Ms the weight of the solid (i.e., GaAs), and Cl and Cs are the 
concentrations of dopant in the liquid and the solid, respectively. Therefore, the weights of arsenic in the liquid 
and solid are MlCl and MsCs, respectively. Because the total arsenic weight is (Ml + Ms)Cm, we have
 
MlCl + MsCs = (Ml + Ms)Cm

As can be seen from Fig. 9, about 10% of the melt is solidified. 
Crystal Growth and Epitaxy 367

Fig. 9 Phase diagram for the gallium-arsenic system.6
Unlike silicon, which has a relatively low vapor pressure at its melting point (~10–6 atm at 1412°C), arsenic has 
much higher vapor pressures at the melting point of gallium arsenide (1240°C). In its vapor phase, arsenic has As2 
and As4 as its major species. Figure 10 shows the  vapor  pressures  of  gallium  and  arsenic  along  the  liquidus  
curve.8  Also  shown  for comparison is the vapor pressure of silicon. The vapor pressure curves for gallium 
arsenide are double valued. The dashed curves are for arsenic-rich gallium arsenide melt (right side of liquidus 
line in Fig. 9), and the solid curves are for gallium-rich gallium arsenide melt (left side of liquidus line in Fig. 9). 
Because there is more arsenic in an arsenic-rich melt than in a gallium-rich melt, more arsenic (As2 and As4) will 
be vaporized from the arsenic-rich melt, thus resulting in a higher vapor pressure. A similar argument can explain 
the higher vapor pressure of gallium in a gallium-rich melt. Note that long before the melting point is reached, 
the surface layers of liquid gallium arsenide may decompose into gallium and arsenic. Since the vapor pressures 
of gallium and arsenic are different, there is a preferential loss of the more volatile arsenic species, and the liquid 
becomes gallium rich.
To synthesize gallium arsenide, an evacuated, sealed quartz-tube system with a two-temperature furnace 
is commonly used. The high-purity arsenic is placed in a graphite boat and heated to 610°–620°C, whereas 
the high-purity gallium is placed in another graphite boat and heated to slightly above the gallium arsenide 
melting temperature (1240° –1260°C). Under these conditions, an overpressure of arsenic is established (a) to 
cause the transport of arsenic vapor to the gallium melt, converting it into gallium arsenide, and (b) to prevent 
decomposition of the gallium arsenide while it is being formed in the furnace. When the melt cools, a high-purity 
polycrystalline gallium arsenide results. This serves as the raw material to grow single-crystal gallium arsenide.7
11.3.2 Crystal-Growth Techniques
There are two techniques for GaAs crystal growth: the Czochralski technique and the Bridgman technique. Most 
gallium arsenide is grown by the Bridgman technique. However, the Czochralski technique is more popular for the 
growth of larger-diameter GaAs ingots.
For Czochralski growth of gallium arsenide, the basic puller is identical to that for silicon. However, to prevent 
decomposition of the melt during crystal growth, a liquid encapsulation method is employed. The liquid
368 Semiconductors

Fig. 10 Partial pressure of gallium and arsenic over gallium arsenide as a function of  temperature.8 Also shown is 
the partial pressure of silicon.
encapsulant is a molten boron trioxide (B2O3) layer about 1 cm thick. Molten boron trioxide is inert to the gallium 
arsenide surface and serves as a cap to cover the melt. This cap prevents decomposition of the gallium arsenide as 
long as the pressure on its surface is higher than 1 atm (760 Torr). Because boron trioxide dissolves silicon dioxide, 
the fused-silica crucible is replaced with a graphite crucible.
To obtain the desired doping concentration in the grown crystal of GaAs, cadmium and zinc are commonly 
used for p-type materials, whereas selenium, silicon, and tellurium are used for n-type materials. For semiinsulating 
GaAs, the material is undoped. The equilibrium segregation coefficients for dopants in GaAs are listed in Table 2. 
As in Si, most of the segregation coefficients are less than 1. The expressions derived previously for Si are equally 
applicable to GaAs (Eqs. 4 to 15).
Figure 11 shows a Bridgman system in which a two-zone furnace is used for growing single-crystal gallium 
arsenide. The left-hand zone is held at a temperature (~610°C) to maintain the required overpressure of arsenic, 
whereas the right-hand zone is held just above the melting point of gallium arsenide (1240°C). The sealed tube is 
made of quartz and the boat is made of graphite. In operation, the boat is loaded with a charge of polycrystalline 
gallium arsenide, with the arsenic kept at the other end of the tube.
As the furnace is moved toward the right, the melt cools at one end. Usually, there is a seed placed at the left 
end of the boat to establish a specific crystal orientation. The gradual freezing (solidification) of the melt allows 
a single crystal to propagate at the liquid-solid interface. Eventually, a single crystal of gallium arsenide is grown. 
The impurity distribution can be described essentially by Eqs. 9 and 15, where the growth rate is given by the 
traversing speed of the furnace.

11.4  MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION
11.4.1 Wafer Shaping
After a crystal is grown, the first shaping operation is to remove the seed and the other end of the ingot, which 
is last to solidify.1 The next operation is to grind the surface so that the diameter of the material is defined. After 
that, one or more flat regions are ground along the length of the ingot. These regions, or flats, mark the specific 
crystal orientation of the ingot and the conductivity type of the material. The largest flat, the primary flat, allows a 
mechanical locator in automatic processing equipment to position the wafer and to orient the devices relative
370 Semiconductors

to the crystal. Other smaller flats, called secondary flats, are ground to identify the orientation and conductivity 
type of the crystal, as shown in Fig. 12. For crystals with diameters equal or larger than 200 mm, no flats are 
ground. Instead, a small groove is ground along the length of the ingot.
The ingot is now ready to be sliced by diamond saw into wafers. Slicing determines four wafer parameters: 
surface orientation (e.g., <111> or <100>), thickness (e.g., 0.5–0.8 mm, depending on wafer diameter); taper, which 
is the wafer thickness variations from one end to another; and bow, which is the surface curvature of the wafer, 
measured from the center of the wafer to its edge.
After slicing, both sides of the wafer are lapped using a mixture of Al2O3 and glycerine to produce a typical 
flatness uniformity within 2 μm. The lapping operation usually leaves the surface and edges of the wafer damaged 
and contaminated. The damaged and contaminated regions can be removed by chemical etching (see Chapter 
12). The final step of wafer shaping is polishing. Its purpose is to provide a smooth, specular surface where 
device features can be defined by lithographic processes (see Chapter 12), Figure 13 shows a 300 mm silicon 
ingot and polished wafers. Table 3 shows the specifications for 125, 150, 200, 300, and 450 mm diameter polished 
silicon wafers from the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (SEMI). As mentioned previously, 
for large crystals (≥ 200 mm diameter) no flats are ground; instead, a groove is made on the edge of the wafer for 
positioning and orientation purposes.
Gallium arsenide is a more fragile material than silicon. Although the basic shaping operation of gallium 
arsenide is essentially the same as that for silicon, greater care must be exercised in gallium arsenide wafer 
preparation. The state of gallium arsenide technology is relatively primitive compared with that for silicon. 
However, the technology of group III-V compounds has advanced partly because of the advances in silicon 
technology.

11.4.2 Crystal Characterization
Crystal Defects
A real crystal (such as a silicon wafer) differs from the ideal crystal in important ways. It is finite; thus, surface 
atoms are incompletely bonded. Furthermore, it has defects, which strongly influence the electrical, mechanical, 
and optical properties of the semiconductor. There are four categories of defects: point defects, line defects, area 
defects, and volume defects.
Figure 14 shows several forms of point defects.1,9 Any foreign atom incorporated into the lattice at either 
a substitutional site [i.e., at a regular lattice site (Fig. 14a)] or interstitial site [i.e., between regular lattice sites 
(Fig.14b)] is a point defect. A missing atom in the lattice creates a vacancy, also considered a point defect (Fig. 
14c). A host atom that is situated between regular lattice sites and adjacent to a vacancy is called a Frenkel defect 
(Fig. 14d). Point defects are particularly important subjects in the kinetics of diffusion and oxidation processes. 
These topics are considered in Chapters 12 and 14.
The next class of defects is the line defect, also called a dislocation.10 There are two types of dislocations: the 
edge and screw types. Figure 15a is a schematic representation of an edge dislocation in a cubic lattice: an extra 
plane of atoms AB is inserted into the lattice. The line of the dislocation would be perpendicular to the plane of 
the page. 
372 Semiconductors

Fig. 14 Point defects. (a) Substitutional impurity. (b) Interstitial impurity. (c) Lattice vacancy. (d) Frenkel-type 
defect.9
The screw dislocation may be considered as being produced by cutting the crystal partway through and 
pushing the upper part one lattice spacing over, as shown in Fig. 15b. Line defects in devices are undesirable 
because they act as precipitation sites for metallic impurities, which may degrade device performance.
Area defects represent large area discontinuities in the lattice. Typical defects are twins and grain boundaries. 
Twinning represents a change in the crystal orientation across a plane. A grain boundary is a transition between 
crystals having no particular orientational relationship to one another. Such defects appear during crystal growth. 
Another area defect is the stacking fault.9 In this defect, the stacking sequence of atomic layer is interrupted. In 
Fig. 16 the sequence of atoms in a stack is ABCABC . . . . When a part of layer such as C in Fig. 16a is missing, it 
is called an intrinsic stacking fault. If an extra plane such as A in Fig. 16b is inserted between layers B and C, it is 
an extrinsic stacking fault. These defects may appear during crystal growth. Crystals having these area defects are 
not usable for integrated-circuit manufacture and are discarded.

Crystal Growth and Epitaxy 373

Fig. 16 Stacking faults in a semiconductor. (a) Intrinsic stacking fault. (b) Extrinsic stacking fault.9
Precipitates of impurities or dopant atoms make up the fourth class of defects, the volume defects. These 
defects arise because of the inherent solubility of the impurity in the host lattice. There is a specific concentration 
of impurity that the host lattice can accept in a solid solution of itself and the impurity. Figure 17 shows solubility 
versus temperature for a variety of elements in silicon.11 The solubility of most impurities decreases with decreasing 
temperature. Thus, at a given temperature, if an impurity is introduced to the maximum concentration allowed by 
its solubility and the crystal is then cooled to a lower temperature, the crystal can achieve an equilibrium state only 
by precipitating the impurity atoms in excess of the solubility level. However, the volume mismatch between the 
host lattice and the precipitates results in dislocations.
Material Properties
Table 4 compares silicon characteristics and the requirements for ultra-large-scale integration* (ULSI).12,13 The 
semiconductor material properties listed in Table 4 can be measured by various methods.  The  resistivity  is  
measured  by the four-point probe method discussed in Section 2.1, Chapter 2, and the minority-carrier lifetime 
can be measured by the photoconductivity method considered in Section 2.3, Chapter 2. The trace  impurities  
such  as  oxygen and carbon in silicon can be analyzed by the secondary-ion-mass spectroscope (SIMS) techniques 
to be described in Chapter 14. Note that although current capabilities can meet most of the wafer specifications 
listed in Table 3, many improvements are needed to satisfy the stringent requirements for ULSI technology.13
The oxygen and carbon concentrations are substantially higher in Czochralski crystals than in float-zone 
crystals because of the dissolution of oxygen from the silica crucible and transport of carbon to the melt from the 
graphite susceptor during crystal growth. Typical carbon concentrations range from 1016 to about 1017 atoms/cm3, 
and carbon atoms in silicon occupy substitutional lattice sites. The presence of carbon is undesirable because it 
aids the formation of defects. Typical oxygen concentrations range from 1017 to 1018 atoms/cm3. Oxygen, however, 
has both deleterious and beneficial effects. It can act as a donor, distorting the resistivity of the crystal caused 
by intentional doping. However, oxygen in an interstitial lattice site can increase the yield strength of silicon. 
This beneficial effect increases with concentration until the oxygen begins to precipitate. Figure 17 shows that 
the typical oxygen concentration in Si wafer will precipitate at most common processing temperatures. A volume 
mismatch occurs as the precipitates grow in size, and results in a compressive strain on the lattice that is relieved 
by the formation of stacking faults (a type of dislocation) and other defects. The metal atoms do not fit in the 
silicon lattice easily because of their very different atomic sizes. They preferentially reside at sites in the silicon 
lattice where imperfections exist. Therefore, these defects can attract fast-diffusing metallic species [(diffusivities of 
metals are several orders of magnitude larger than those of common dopants like P, B, and As in silicon (Fig. 4 in 
Chapter 14)], which give rise to large junction leakage currents.
* The number of components in an ultralarge-scale integrated circuit is more than 107.
374 Semiconductors

Fig. 17 Solid solubilities of impurity elements in silicon.11
Certain precipitates can capture harmful impurities; this is called gettering. Gettering is a general term 
meaning a process that removes harmful impurities or defects from the region in a wafer where devices are 
fabricated. It is difficult to reduce the concentrations of impurities by purifying the wafers and by excluding metal 
contaminants from manufacturing environments. There are two basic methods for gettering. One is intrinsic 
gettering, which makes use of oxygen precipitates to getter metal atoms within the wafer bulk.

376 Semiconductors

The other, called extrinsic gettering, is created on the wafer backside by many methods, such as grinding, 
sandpaper abrasion, ion implantation, laser melting, depositing amorphous or polycrystalline films, high-
concentration backside diffusion, etc. Once the backside damage sites are created, any subsequent high-
temperature processing step will allow the metal atoms to diffuse to the backside where they can be trapped (note 
that metal atoms can easily diffuse completely through a silicon wafer at most common processing temperatures).
When the wafer is subjected to high-temperature treatment (e.g., 1050°C in N2), oxygen evaporates from the 
surface. This lowers the oxygen content near the surface. The treatment creates a defect-free (or denuded) zone 
for device fabrication, as shown in the inset1 of Fig. 18. Additional thermal cycles can be used to promote the 
formation of oxygen precipitates in the interior of the wafer for gettering of impurities. The depth of the defect-
free zone depends on the time and temperature of the thermal cycle and on the diffusivity of oxygen in silicon. 
Measured results for the denuded zone are shown1 in Fig. 18. It is possible to obtain Czochralski crystals of silicon 
that are virtually free of dislocations.
Commercial melt-grown materials of gallium arsenide are heavily contaminated by the crucible. However, 
for photonic applications, most requirements call for heavily doped materials (between 1017 and 1018 cm–3). For 
integrated circuits or for discrete MESFET (metal-semiconductor field-effect transistor) devices, undoped gallium 
arsenide can be used as the starting material, with a resistivity of 109 Ω-cm. Oxygen is an undesirable impurity in 
GaAs because it can form a deep donor level, which contributes to a trapping charge in the bulk of the substrate 
and increases its resistivity.  Oxygen contamination can be minimized by using graphite crucibles for melt growth. 
The dislocation content for Czochralski-grown gallium arsenide crystals is about two orders of magnitude higher 
than that of silicon. For Bridgman GaAs crystals, the dislocation density is about an order of magnitude lower 
than that of Czochralski-grown GaAs crystals.
 
11.5 EPITAXIAL-GROWTH TECHNIQUES
In an epitaxial process, the substrate wafer acts as the seed crystal. Epitaxial processes are differentiated from 
the melt-growth processes described in previous sections in that the epitaxial layer can be grown at a temperature 
substantially below the melting point, typically 30–50% lower. The common techniques for epitaxial growth are 
chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) and molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). 
11.5.1 Chemical-Vapor Deposition
CVD, also known as vapor-phase epitaxy (VPE), is a process whereby an epitaxial layer is formed by a chemical 
reaction between gaseous compounds. CVD can be performed at atmospheric pressure (APCVD) or at low 
pressure (LPCVD).
Figure 19 shows three common susceptors for epitaxial growth. Note that the geometric shape of the 
susceptor provides the name for the reactor: horizontal, pancake, and barrel susceptors—all  made  from  graphite  
blocks.  Susceptors in  the  epitaxial  reactors are analogous to the crucible in the crystal-growing  furnaces.  Not 
only  do  they  mechanically support the wafer, but in induction-heated reactors they also serve as the source of 
thermal energy for the reaction. The mechanism of CVD involves a number of steps: (a) the reactants such as 
the gases and dopants are transported to the substrate region, (b) they are transferred to the substrate surface 
where they are adsorbed, (c) a chemical reaction occurs, catalyzed at the surface, followed by growth of the 
epitaxial layer, (d) the gaseous products are desorbed into the main gas stream, and (e) the reaction products are 
transported out of the reaction chamber.
CVD for Silicon
Four silicon sources have been used for VPE growth: silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), dichlorosilane (SiH2Cl2), 
trichlorosilane (SiHCl3), and silane (SiH4). Silicon tetrachloride has been the most studied and has the widest 
industrial use. The typical reaction temperature is 1200°C. Other silicon sources are used because of lower reaction 
temperatures. The substitution of a hydrogen atom for each chlorine atom from silicon tetrachloride permits about 
a 50°C reduction in the reaction temperature. The overall reaction of silicon tetrachloride that results in the growth 
of silicon layers is

As a result, if the silicon tetrachloride concentration is too high, etching rather than growth of silicon will take 
place. Figure 20 shows the effect of the concentration of silicon tetrachloride in the gas on the reaction, where 
the mole fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of molecules of a given species to the total number 
of molecules.14 Note that initially the growth rate increases linearly with increasing concentration of silicon 
tetrachloride. As the concentration of silicon tetrachloride is increased, a maximum growth rate is reached. 
Beyond that, the growth rate starts to decrease and eventually etching of the silicon will occur. Silicon is usually 
grown in the low-concentration region, as indicated in Fig. 20.
The reaction of Eq. 22 is reversible, that is, it can take place in either direction. If the carrier gas entering the 
reactor contains hydrochloric acid, removal or etching will take place. Actually, this etching operation is used for 
in-situ cleaning of the silicon wafer and coating on the reactor chamber wall prior to epitaxial growth.
The dopant is introduced at the same time as the silicon tetrachloride during epitaxial growth (Fig. 19a). 
Gaseous diborane (B2H6) is used as the p-type dopant, whereas phosphine (PH3) and arsine (AsH3) are used as 
n-type dopants. Gas mixtures are ordinarily used with hydrogen as the diluent to allow reasonable control of flow 
rates for the desired doping concentration. The dopant chemistry for arsine is illustrated in Fig. 21, which shows 
arsine being adsorbed on the surface, decomposing, and being incorporated into the growing layer. Figure 21 also 
shows the growth mechanisms at the surface, which are based on the surface adsorption of host atoms (silicon) 
as well as the dopant atom (e.g., arsenic) and the movement of these atoms toward the ledge sites.15 To give these 
adsorbed atoms sufficient mobility for finding their proper positions within the crystal lattice, epitaxial growth 
needs relatively high temperatures.

CVD for GaAs
For gallium arsenide, the basic setup is similar to that shown in Fig. 19a. Since gallium arsenide decomposes into 
gallium and arsenic upon evaporation, its direct transport in the vapor phase is not possible. One approach is 
the use of As4 for the arsenic component and gallium chloride (GaCl3) for the gallium component. The overall 
reaction leading to epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide is
 
As4 + 4GaCl3 +6H2 → 4GaAs +12HCl. 
(24)
The As4 is generated by thermal decomposition of arsine (AsH3):
 
4AsH3 → As4 + 6H2, 
(24a)
and the gallium chloride is generated by the reaction
 
6HCl + 2Ga → 2GaCl3 + 3H2. 
(24b)
The reactants are introduced into a reactor with a carrier gas (e.g., H2). Usually, the temperature for Eq. 24b is 
800oC. The growth temperature of GaAs epilayer for Eq. 24 is below 750 oC. A two-zone reactor is needed for 
this exptaxial growth. Moreover, both reactions are exothermic: the epitaxy requires a reactor with hot walls. 
The reactions are near equilibrium condition, and process control is difficult. During the epitaxy, there must be 
sufficient arsenic overpressure to prevent thermal decomposition of the substrate and the growing layer.

Metalorganic CVD
Metalorganic CVD (MOCVD) is also a VPE process based on pyrolytic reactions. Unlike conventional CVD, 
MOCVD is distinguished by the chemical nature of the precursor. It is important for those elements that do not 
form stable hydrides or halides but that form stable metalorganic compounds with reasonable vapor pressure. 
MOCVD has been extensively applied in the heteroepitaxial growth of III-V and II-VI compounds.
To grow GaAs, we can use metalorganic compounds such as trimethylgallium Ga(CH3)3 for the gallium 
component and arsine AsH3 for the arsenic component. Both chemicals can be transported in vapor form into the 
reactor. The overall reaction is
 
AsH3 + Ga(CH3)3 → GaAs + 3CH4. 
(25)
For Al-containing compounds, such as AlAs, we can use trimethylaluminum Al(CH3)3. During epitaxy, the GaAs 
is doped by introducing dopants in vapor form. Diethylzinc Zn(C2H5)2 and diethylcadmium Cd(C2H5)2 are typical 
p-type dopants and silane SiH4 is an n-type dopant for III-V compounds. The hydrides of sulfur and selenium or 
tetramethyltin are also used for n-type dopants and chromyl chloride is used to dope chromium into GaAs to form 
semiinsulating layers. Since these compounds are highly poisonous and often spontaneously inflammable in air, 
rigorous safety precautions are necessary in the MOCVD process.
A schematic of an MOCVD reactor is shown16 in Fig. 22. Due to the endothermic reaction, a reactor with a 
cold wall is used. Typically, the metalorganic compound is transported to the quartz reaction vessel by hydrogen 
carrier gas, where it is mixed with AsH3 in the case of GaAs growth. The chemical reaction is induced by heating  
the  gases  to 600°–800°C above a substrate placed on a graphite susceptor using radio-frequency heating. A 
pyrolytic reaction forms the GaAs layer. The advantages of using metalorganics are that they are volatile at 
moderately low temperatures and there are no troublesome liquid Ga or In sources in the reactor. A single hot 
zone and nonequilibrium (one-way) reaction make the control of MOCVD easier.
11.5.2 Molecular-Beam Epitaxy
MBE17 is an epitaxial process involving the reaction of one or  more  thermal  beams  of atoms or molecules with 
a crystalline surface under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions (~10–8 Pa).§ MBE can achieve precise control in both 
chemical compositions and doping profiles. Single-crystal multilayer structures with dimensions on the order of 
atomic layers can be made using MBE. Thus, the MBE method enables the precise fabrication of semiconductor 
heterostructures having thin layers from a fraction of a micron down to a monolayer. In general, MBE growth 
rates are quite low, and for GaAs, a value of 1 μm/hr is typical.
 
§  The international unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa); 1 Pa =1 N/m2. However, various other units have been used. 
The conversion of these units is: 1 atm = 760 mm Hg = 760 Torr = 1.013 × 105 Pa.

reactor.16 DEZn is diethylozinc Zn(C2H5)2, TMGa is trimethylgallium Ga(CH3)3, and TMAl is trimethylaluminum 
Al(CH3)3. 
Figure 23 shows a schematic of an MBE system for gallium arsenide and related III-V compounds such 
as AlxGa1–xAs. The system represents the ultimate in film deposition control, cleanliness, and in-situ chemical 
characterization capability. Separate effusion ovens made of pyrolytic boron nitride are used for Ga, As, and the 
dopants. All the effusion ovens are housed in an ultrahigh-vacuum chamber (~10–8 Pa). The temperature of each 
oven is adjusted to give the desired evaporation rate. The substrate holder rotates continuously to achieve uniform 
epitaxial layers (e.g., ±1% in doping variations and ±0.5% in thickness variations).
To grow GaAs, an overpressure of As is maintained, since the sticking coefficient of Ga to GaAs is unity, 
whereas that for As is zero, unless there is a previously deposited Ga layer. For a silicon MBE system, an electron 
gun is used to evaporate silicon. One or more effusion ovens are used for the dopants. Effusion ovens behave like 
small-area sources and exhibit a cosθ emission, where θ is the angle between the direction of the source and the 
normal to the substrate surface.
MBE uses an evaporation method in a vacuum system. An important parameter for vacuum technology is 
the molecular impingement rate, that is, how many molecules impinge on a unit area of the substrate per unit time. 
The impingement rate ϕ is a function of the molecular weight, temperature, and pressure. The rate is derived in 
Appendix K and can be expressed as18
 
ϕ = P(2πmkT)–1/2

where P is the pressure in Pa, m is the mass of a molecule in kg , k is Boltzmann’s constant in J/K, T is the 
temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molecular weight. Therefore, at 300 K and 10–4 Pa pressure, the impingement 
rate is 2.7 × 1014 molecules/cm2-s for oxygen (M = 32).

To avoid contamination of the epitaxial layer, it is of paramount importance to maintain ultrahigh-vacuum 
conditions (~10–8 Pa) for the MBE process. 
During molecular motion, molecules will collide with other molecules. The average distance traversed by all 
the molecules between successive collisions with each other is defined as the mean free path. It can be derived from 
a simple collision theory. A molecule having a diameter d and a velocity υ will move a distance υδt in the time δt. 
The molecule suffers a collision with another molecule if its center is anywhere within a distance d of the center 
of another molecule. Therefore, it sweeps out (without collision) a cylinder of diameter 2d. The volume of the

Assume an effusion oven geometry of area A = 5 cm2 and a distance L between the top of the oven and the 
gallium arsenide substrate of 10 cm. Calculate the MBE growth rate for the effusion oven filled with gallium 
arsenide at 900ºC. The surface density of gallium atom is 6 × 1014 cm–2, and the average thickness of a monolayer 
is 2.8 Å.
SOLUTION  
On heating gallium arsenide, the volatile arsenic vaporizes first, leaving a gallium-rich solution. Therefore, only the 
pressures marked Ga-rich in Fig. 10 are of interest. The pressure at 900ºC is 5.5 × 10–2 Pa for gallium and 1.1 Pa 
for arsenic (As2). The arrival rate can be obtained from the impingement rate (Eq. 26a) by multiplying it by A/πL2:

Note that the growth rate is relatively low compared with that of VPE. 
There are two ways to clean a surface in situ for MBE. High-temperature baking can decompose native oxide 
and remove other adsorbed species by evaporation or diffusion into the wafer. Another approach is to use a low-
energy ion beam of an inert gas to sputter-clean the surface, followed by a low-temperature annealing to reorder 
the surface lattice structure. 
MBE can use a wider variety of dopants than CVD and MOCVD, and the doping profile can be exactly 
controlled. However, the doping process is similar to the vapor-phase growth process: a flux of evaporated
dopant atoms arrives at a favorable lattice site and is incorporated along the growing interface. 
Crystal Growth and Epitaxy 383

Fine control of the doping profile is achieved by adjusting the dopant flux relative to the flux of silicon atoms 
(for silicon epitaxial films) or gallium atoms (for gallium arsenide epitaxial films). It is also possible to dope the 
epitaxial film using a low-current, low-energy ion beam to implant the dopant (see Chapter 14).
The substrate temperatures for MBE range from 400°–900ºC; and the growth rates range from 0.001 to  
0.3 μm/min. Because of the low-temperature process and low growth rate, many unique doping profiles and  
alloy compositions not obtainable from conventional CVD can be produced in MBE. Many novel structures have 
been made using MBE, among them the superlattice and the heterojunction field-effect transistors discussed in 
Chapter 7.
A further development in MBE has replaced the group III elemental sources by metalorganic compounds 
such as trimethylgallium (TMG) or triethylgallium (TEG). This approach is called metalorganic molecular-beam 
epitaxy (MOMBE) and is also referred to as chemical-beam epitaxy (CBE). Although closely related to MOCVD, 
it is considered a special form of MBE. The metalorganics are sufficiently volatile that they can be admitted 
directly into the MBE growth chamber as a beam and are not decomposed before forming the beam. The dopants 
are generally elemental sources, typically Be for p-type and Si or Sn for n-type GaAs epitaxial layers.
 
11.6 STRUCTURES AND DEFECTS IN EPITAXIAL LAYERS
11.6.1 Lattice-Matched and Strained-Layer Epitaxy
For conventional homoepitaxial growth, a single-crystal semiconductor layer is grown on a single-crystal 
semiconductor substrate. The semiconductor layer and the substrate are the same material and have the same 
lattice constant. Therefore, homoepitaxy is, by definition, a lattice-matched epitaxial process. The homoepitaxial 
process offers an important means of controlling the doping profiles so that device and circuit performance can be 
optimized. For example, an n-type silicon layer with a relatively low doping concentration can be grown epitaxially 
on an n+-silicon substrate. This structure substantically reduces the series resistance associated with the substrate.
Fig. 24 Schematic of (a) lattice-matched, (b) strained, and (c) unstrained hetero-epitaxial structures.19 Homoepitaxy 
is structurally identical to lattice-matched heteroepitaxy.
384 Semiconductors

For heteroepitaxy, the epitaxial layer and the substrate are two different semiconductors, and the epitaxial 
layer must be grown in such a way that an idealized interfacial structure is maintained. This implies that atomic 
bonding across the interface must be continuous without interruption. Therefore, the two semiconductors must 
either have the same lattice spacing or be able to deform to adopt a common spacing. These two cases are referred 
to as lattice-matched epitaxy and strained-layer epitaxy.
Figure 24a shows lattice-matched epitaxy, where the substrate and the film have the same lattice constant. An 
important example is the epitaxial growth of AlxGa1–xAs on a GaAs substrate where for any x between 0 and 1, 
the lattice constant of AlxGa1–xAs differs from that of GaAs by less than 0.13%.
For the lattice-mismatched case, if the epitaxial layer has a larger lattice constant and is flexible, it will be 
compressed in the plane of growth to conform to the substrate spacing. Elastic forces then compel it to dilate in 
a direction perpendicular to the interface. This type of structure is called strained-layer epitaxy and is illustrated19 
in Fig. 24b. On the other hand, if the epitaxial layer has a smaller lattice constant, it will be dilated in the plane 
of growth and compressed in a direction perpendicular to the interface. In the above strained-layer epitaxy, as the 
strained-layer thickness increases, the total number of atoms under strain or the distorted atomic bonds grows, 
and at some point misfit dislocations are nucleated to relieve the homogeneous strain energy. This thickness 
is referred to as the critical layer thickness for the system. Figure 24c shows the case in which there are edge 
dislocations at the interface.
The critical layer thicknesses for two material systems are shown20 in Fig. 25. The upper curve is for the 
strained-layer epitaxy of a GexSi1–x layer on a silicon substrate, and the lower curve is for a Ga1–xInxAs layer on a 
GaAs substrate. For example, for Ge0.3Si0.7 on silicon, the maximum epitaxial thickness is about 70 nm. For thicker 
films, edge dislocations will occur.

and Ga1–xInxAs on GaAs.
Crystal Growth and Epitaxy 385

Fig. 26 Illustration of the elements and formation of an strained-layer superlattice.17 Arrows show the direction of 
the strain.
A related heteroepitaxial structure is the strained-layer superlattice (SLS). A superlattice is an artificial one-
dimensional periodic structure constituted by different materials with a period of about 10 nm. Figure 26 
shows17 a SLS having two semiconductors with different equilibrium lattice constants a1> a2 grown in a structure 
with a common inplane lattice constant b, where a1> b > a2. For sufficiently thin layers, the lattice mismatch is 
accommodated by uniform strains in the layers. Under these conditions, no misfit dislocations are generated at the 
interfaces, so high-quality crystalline materials can be obtained. These artificially  structured  materials, which can 
be  grown  by  MBE, provide a new area in semiconductor research and permit new solid-state devices, especially 
for high-speed and photonic applications.
11.6.2 Compound Semiconductors on Silicon
The technologies of strained-layer, high-k gate oxide, nanowire, and multigate have been utilized in IC fabrication. 
To continue the development of IC industry, the heteroepitaxial technology has gained much attention in recent 
years. The superior properties (higher electron mobility, larger bandgap) of III-V compounds (e.g., GaAs, InP) 
make heteroepitaxial layers of these compounds on Si substrates attractive. In addition, this heteroepitaxial 
approach can provide lower cost, higher mechanical strength, better thermal conductivity, larger wafer area, and 
the possibility of monolithic integration of electronic and optical devices.

There are three problems in the heteroepitaxy process21: (1) antiphase domains (APD) from polar 
semiconductor grown on nonpolar semiconductor shown in Fig. 27a, (2) high dislocation density from large lattice 
mismatch (4% for GaAs/Si, 8% for InP/Si), and (3) cracking, bowing, and bending from large thermal-expansion-
coefficient mismatch (GaAs is 2.2 times of Si) during cooling from the growth temperature. 
There are many techniques used to eliminate or minimize these problems. The most common techniques 
are the tilted substrates and the pseudomorphic (strained-layer) superlattice buffer layer. The tilted substrate can 
create double steps to reduce antiphase domains, as shown in Fig. 27b. For GaAs/Si, 4% lattice mismatch means 
one dislocation generation for every 25 atomic planes. A substrate with a suitable tilted angle can create a plateau 
with a width less than 25 atoms  on the substrate surface, as shown in Fig. 27c, and the lattice misfit dislocation 
can be reduced. The pseudomorphic superlattice buffer layer provides a strain field to bend the dislocation and 
prevent it from propagating into the active region of a device, as shown in Fig. 27d. However, there is no effective 
way to avoid thermal-expansion-coefficient mismatch. Although the stress during cooling is not large enough to 
cause dislocations, the repeated thermal cycles would cause bowing, bending, and even cracking. However, high-
quality enhancement-mode In0.7Ga0.3As quantum-well transistors on silicon substrate have been obtained by these 
techniques.22
Recently, the critical thickness of a nanowire has been found to be roughly an order of magnitude larger than 
the critical thickness on the same substrate in thin film systems.23 Nanowire heterostructures may exhibit defect-
free interfaces even for systems with large lattice mismatch. This approach may provide another possible solution 
for the heteroepitaxial growth of III-V compounds on Si.  
Crystal Growth and Epitaxy 387

 
SUMMARY
Several techniques are available to grow single crystals of silicon and gallium arsenide. For silicon crystals, we use 
sand (SiO2) to produce polycrystalline silicon, which then serves as the raw material in a Czochralski puller. A 
seed crystal with the desired orientation is used to grow a large ingot from the melt. Over 90% of silicon crystals 
are prepared by this technique. During crystal growth, the dopant in the crystal will redistribute. A key parameter 
is the segregation coefficient, i.e., the ratio of the dopant concentration in the solid to that in the melt. Since most 
coefficients are less than 1, the melt becomes progressively enriched with the dopant as the crystal grows.
Another growth technique for silicon is the float-zone process. It offers lower contamination than that 
normally obtained from the Czochralski technique. Float-zone crystals are used mainly for high-power, high-
voltage devices where high-resistivity materials are required.
To make GaAs, we use chemically pure gallium and arsenic as the starting materials that are synthesized 
to form polycrystalline GaAs. Single crystals of GaAs can be grown by the Czochralski technique. However, a 
liquid encapsulant (e.g., B2O3) is required to prevent decomposition of GaAs at the growth temperature. Another 
technique is the Bridgman process, which uses a two-zone furnace for gradual solidification of the melt.
After a crystal is grown, it usually goes through wafer-shaping operations to give an end product of highly 
polished wafers with a specified diameter, thickness, and surface orientation. For example, 300 mm silicon wafers 
for a MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) fabrication line should have a diameter of 300 
± 1 mm, a thickness of 0.765 ± 0.01 mm, and a surface orientation of (100) ± 1°. Wafers with diameters larger 
than 300 mm are being manufactured for future integrated circuits. Their specifications are listed in Table 3.
A real crystal has defects that influence the electrical, mechanical, and optical properties of the 
semiconductor. These defects are point defects, line defects, area defects, and volume defects. We also discussed 
means to minimize such defects. For the more demanding ULSI applications, the dislocation density must be less 
than 1 per square centimeter. Other important requirements are listed in Table 4.
A technology closely related to crystal growth is the epitaxial process. In this process, the substrate wafer 
is the seed. High-quality, single-crystal films can be grown at temperatures 30%–50% lower than the melting 
point. The common techniques for epitaxial growth are chemical-vapor deposition (CVD), metalorganic CVD 
(MOCVD), and molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). CVD and MOCVD are chemical deposition processes. Gases 
and dopants are transported in vapor form to the substrate, where a chemical reaction occurs that results in the 
deposition of the epitaxial layer. Inorganic compounds are used for CVD, whereas metalorganic compounds are 
used for MOCVD. MBE, on the other hand, is a physical deposition process. It is done by the evaporation of a 
species in an ultrahigh vacuum system. Because it is a low-temperature process that has a low growth rate, MBE 
can grow single-crystal, multilayer structures with dimensions on the order of atomic layers.
In addition to conventional homoepitaxy, such as n-type silicon on an n+-silicon substrate, we have also 
considered heteroepitaxy, which includes lattice-matched and strained-layer structures. For strained-layer epitaxy, 
there is a critical layer thickness above which edge dislocations will nucleate to relieve the strain energy.
The heteroepitaxy and superior properties of III-V compounds on Si are attractive in continuing 
development in the IC industry. Various means have been presented to minimize or even eliminate the problems. 
But they are not solved completely. The critical thickness of a nanowire has been found to be roughly an order of 
magnitude larger than the critical thickness on the same substrate in thin-film systems. This approach may provide 
another possible solution for the heteroepitaxial growth of III-V compounds on Si.

SUMMARY
To fabricate discrete devices and integrated circuits, we use many different kinds of thin films. We can classify thin 
films into four groups: thermal oxides, dielectric layers, polycrystalline silicon, and metal films. Figure 1 shows a 
schematic view of a conventional silicon n-channel MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) 
that uses all four groups of films. The first important thin film from the thermal oxide group is the gate-oxide 
layer, under which a conducting channel can be formed between the source and the drain. A related layer is the 
field oxide, which provides isolation from other devices. Both gate and field oxides generally are grown by a 
thermal oxidation process because only thermal oxidation can provide the highest-quality oxides having the lowest 
interface trap densities.
Dielectric layers such as silicon dioxide and silicon nitride are used for insulation between conducting 
layers, for diffusion and ion implantation masks, for capping doped films to prevent the loss of dopants, and for 
passivation to protect devices from impurities, moisture, and scratches. Polycrystalline silicon, usually referred to as 
polysilicon, is used as a gate electrode material in MOS devices, a conductive material for multilevel metallization, 
and a contact material for devices with shallow junctions. Metal films such as copper and silicides are used to form 
low-resistance interconnections, ohmic contacts, and rectifying metal-semiconductor barriers.
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
The current density equation and its drift and diffusion components.
r
The thermal oxidation process to form silicon dioxide (SiO2).
r
Chemical –vapor deposition techniques to form dielectrics and polysilicon films.
r
Metallization and related global planarization.
r
Atomic layer deposition to form thin films of the order of a monolayer.
r
Characteristics of these thin films and their compatibility with integrated-circuit processing.
 
12.1 THERMAL OXIDATION 
Semiconductors can be oxidized by various methods. These include thermal oxidation, electrochemical 
anodization, and plasma reaction. Among these methods, thermal oxidation is by far the most important for 
silicon devices. It is the key process in modern silicon integrated-circuit technology. For gallium arsenide, however, 
thermal oxidation results in generally nonstoichiometric films. The oxides provide poor electrical insulation and

semiconductor surface protection; hence, these oxides are rarely used in gallium arsenide technology. 
Consequently, in this section we concentrate on the thermal oxidation of silicon.
The basic thermal oxidation setup is shown1 in Fig. 2. The reactor consists of a resistance-heated furnace, a 
cylindrical fused-quartz tube containing the silicon wafers held vertically in a slotted quartz boat, and a source of 
either pure dry oxygen or pure water vapor. The loading end of the furnace tube protudes into a vertical flow hood 
where a filtered flow of air is maintained. Flow is directed as shown by the arrow in Fig. 2. The hood reduces dust 
and particulate matters in the air surrounding the wafers and minimizes contamination during wafer loading. The 
oxidation temperature is generally in the range of 900°-1200 °C and the typical gas flow rate is about 1 liter/min. 
The oxidation system uses microprocessors to regulate the gas flow sequence, to control the automatic insertion 
and removal of silicon wafers, to ramp the temperature up (i.e., to increase the furnace temperature linearly) 
from a low temperature to the oxidation temperature so that the wafers will not warp due to sudden temperature 
change, to maintain the oxidation temperature to within ±1°C, and to ramp the temperature down when oxidation 
is completed.

12.1.1 Kinetics of Growth
The following chemical reactions describe the thermal oxidation of silicon in oxygen or water vapor:
 
Si(solid) + O2 (gas) → SiO2 (solid), 
(1)
 
Si(solid) + 2H2O (gas) → SiO2 (solid) + 2H2 (gas). 
(2)
The silicon-silicon dioxide interface moves into the silicon during the oxidation process. This creates a fresh 
interface region with surface contamination on the original silicon ending up on the oxide surface. The densities 
and molecular weights of silicon and silicon dioxide are used in the following example to show that growing an 
oxide of thickness x consumes a layer of silicon 0.44x thick (Fig. 3).
 EXAMPLE 1
If a silicon oxide layer of thickness x is grown by thermal oxidation, what is the thickness of silicon being 
consumed? The molecular weight of Si is 28.9 g/mol, and the density of Si is 2.33 g/cm3. The corresponding values 
for SiO2 are 60.08 g/mol and 2.21 g/cm3.

Two-dimensional representation of the amorphous structure of silicon dioxide.1
The basic structural unit of thermally grown silicon dioxide is a silicon atom surrounded tetrahedrally by four 
oxygen atoms, as illustrated1 in Fig. 4a. The silicon-to-oxygen internuclear distance is 1.6 Å, and the oxygen-to-
oxygen internuclear distance is 2.27 Å. These tetrahedra are joined together at their corners by oxygen bridges in 
a variety of ways to form the various phases or structures of silicon dioxide (also called silica). Silica has several 
crystalline structures (e.g., quartz) and an amorphous structure. When silicon is thermally oxidized, the silicon 
dioxide structure is amorphous. Typically amorphous silica has a density of 2.21 g/cm3 compared with 2.65 g/cm3 
for quartz.
The basic difference between the crystalline and amorphous structures is that the former is a periodic 
structure, extending over many molecules, whereas the latter has no periodic structure at all. Figure 4b is a two-
dimensional schematic diagram of a quartz crystalline structure made up of rings with six silicon atoms. Figure 4c 
is a two-dimensional schematic diagram of an amorphous structure for comparison. In the amorphous structure 
there is still a tendency to form characteristic rings with six silicon atoms. Note that the amorphous structure in 
Fig. 4c is quite open because only 43% of the space is occupied by silicon dioxide molecules. The relatively open 
structure accounts for the lower density and allows a variety of impurities (such as sodium) to enter and diffuse 
readily through the silicon dioxide layer.
The kinetics of thermal oxidation of silicon can be studied using the simple model illustrated2 in Fig. 5. A 
silicon slice contacts the oxidizing species (oxygen or water vapor), resulting in a surface concentration of C0 
molecules/cm3 for these species. The magnitude of C0 equals the equilibrium bulk concentration of the species 
at the oxidation temperature. The equilibrium concentration generally is proportional to the partial pressure of 
the oxidant adjacent to the oxide surface. At 1000 °C and a pressure of 1 atm, the concentration C0 is 5.2×1016 
molecules/cm3 for dry oxygen and 3×1019 molecules/cm3 for water vapor.
The oxidizing species diffuses through the silicon dioxide layer, resulting in a concentration Cs at the surface 
of silicon. The flux F1 can be written as

At the silicon surface, the oxidizing species reacts chemically with silicon. Assuming the rate of reaction is 
proportional to the concentration of the species at the silicon surface, the flux F2 is given by
 
F2 = κCs,

The reaction of the oxidizing species with silicon forms silicon dioxide. Let C1 be the number of molecules of 
the oxidizing species in a unit volume of the oxide. There are 2.2 × 1022 silicon dioxide molecules/cm3 in the oxide, 
and we add one oxygen molecule (O2) to each silicon dioxide molecule, whereas we add two water molecules 
(H2O) to each silicon dioxide molecule. Therefore, C1 for oxidation in dry oxygen is 2.2 × 1022 cm-3, and for 
oxidation in water vapor it is twice this number (4.4 x 1022 cm-3). Thus, the growth rate of the oxide layer

We can solve this differential equation subject to the initial condition x(0) = d0, where d0 is the initial oxide

During the early stages of oxide growth, when the surface reaction is the rate-limiting factor, the oxide thickness 
varies linearly with time. As the oxide layer becomes thicker, the oxidant must diffuse through the oxide layer to 
react at the silicon-silicon dioxide interface and the reaction becomes diffusion limited. The oxide growth then 
becomes proportional to the square root of the oxidizing time, which results in a parabolic growth rate.

for the parabolic region. For this reason, the term B/A is referred to as the linear rate constant and B as the 
parabolic rate constant. Experimentally measured results agree with the predictions of this model over a wide 
range of oxidation conditions. For wet oxidation, the initial oxide thickness d0 is very small, or τ ≅0. However, for 
dry oxidation, the extrapolated value of d0 at t = 0 is about 20 nm.
The temperature dependence of the linear rate constant B/A is shown in Fig. 6 for both dry and wet oxidation 
and for (111)- and (l00)-oriented silicon wafers.2 The linear rate constant varies as exp (–Ea/kT), where the 
activation energy Ea is about 2 eV for both dry and wet oxidation. This agrees closely with the energy required to 
break silicon-silicon bonds, 1.83 eV/molecule. Under a given oxidation condition, the linear rate constant depends 
on crystal orientation. This is because the rate constant is related to the rate of incorporation of oxygen atoms 
into the silicon. The rate depends on the surface bond structure of silicon atoms, making it orientation dependent. 
Because the density of available bonds on the (111)-plane is higher than that on the (100)-plane, the linear rate 
constant for (111)-silicon is larger.
Figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the parabolic rate constant B, which can also be described by 
exp(–Ea/kT). The activation energy Ea is 1.24 eV for dry oxidation. The comparable activation energy for oxygen 
diffusion in fused silica is 1.18 eV. The corresponding value for wet oxidation, 0.71 eV, compares favorably with 
the value of 0.79 eV for the activation energy of diffusion of water in fused silica. The parabolic rate constant is 
independent of crystal orientation. This independence is expected because it is a measure of the diffusion process 
of the oxidizing species through a random network layer of amorphous silica.
Although oxides grown in dry oxygen have the best electrical properties, considerably more time is required to 
grow the same oxide thickness at a given temperature in dry oxygen than in water vapor. For relatively thin oxides 
such as the gate oxide in a MOSFET (typically ≤ 20 nm), dry oxidation is used.  
Film Formation 397

However, for thicker oxides such as field oxides (≥ 20 nm) in MOS integrated circuits and for bipolar devices, 
oxidation in water vapor (or steam) is used to provide both adequate isolation and passivation.

Figure 8 shows experimental results for silicon dioxide thickness as a function of reaction time and 
temperature for two substrate orientations.3 Under a given oxidation condition, the oxide thickness grown on 
a (111)-substrate is larger than that grown on a (100)-substrate because of the larger linear rate constant of the 
(111)-orientation. Note that for a give temperature and time, the oxide film obtained using wet oxidation is about 
5–10 times thicker than that obtained using dry oxidation.
 EXAMPLE 2
Using Fig. 8, determine the thickness of an SiO2 layer grown on a (100) bare Si wafer in the following three 
sequential steps: (a) 60 min., 1200 oC, dry O2, (b) 18 min., 900 oC, stream, (c) 30 min., 1050 oC, stream.
SOLUTION
(a)  Since we are beginning with a bare silicon wafer, we can use Fig. 8a directly. We find a   
value of 0.18 μm or 180 nm.
Film Formation 399

(b)  Using 0.18 μm as a starting point on Fig. 8b, we find that we have grown the  
equivalent of 0.7 hr or 42 min. We add another 18 min, bringing the total time to 60    
min. Figure 8b shows a total oxide thickness of 0.22 μm.
(c)  Using 0.22 μm as a starting point on Fig. 8b, we find that we have grown the    
equivalent of 15 min. We add another 30 min, bringing the total time to 45 min.  
Figure 8b shows a total oxide thickness of 0.48 μm. 
12.1.2 Thin Oxide Growth 
Relatively slow growth rates must be used to grow thin oxide films of precise thicknesses reproducibly. Various 
approaches to achieving such slower growth rates have been reported. The mainstream approach for gate oxides 
10–15 nm thick is to grow the oxide film at atmospheric pressure and lower temperatures (800°–900°C). With this 
approach, processing using modern vertical oxidation furnaces can grow reproducible, high-quality 10 nm oxides 
to within 0.1 nm across the wafer.
We noted earlier that for dry oxidation, there is an apparently rapid oxidation that gives rise to an initial 
oxide thickness d0 of about 20 nm. Therefore, the simple model presented in Section 12.1.1 is not valid for dry 
oxidation with oxide thickness ≤ 20 nm. For ultralarge-scale integration (ULSI), the ability to grow thin (5–20 nm), 
uniform, high-quality reproducible gate oxides has become increasingly important. We briefly consider the growth 
mechanisms of such thin oxides.
In the early stage of growth in dry oxidation, there is a large compressive stress in the oxide layer that reduces 
the oxygen diffusion coefficient in the oxide. As the oxide becomes thicker, the stress will be reduced due to the 
viscous flow of silica and the diffusion coefficient will approach its stress-free value. Therefore, for thin oxides, the 
value of D/κ may be sufficiently small that we can neglect the term Ax in Eq. 11 and obtain

,  which is the initial oxide thickness when time is extrapolated to zero, 
and B is the parabolic rate constant defined previously. We therefore expect the initial growth in dry  
oxidation to follow a parabolic form.
 
12.2 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION OF DIELECTRICS
Deposited dielectric films are used mainly for insulation and passivation of discrete devices and integrated 
circuits. Considerations in selecting a deposition process are the substrate temperature, the deposition rate and 
film uniformity, the morphology, the electrical and mechanical properties, and the chemical composition of the 
dielectric films.
12.2.1 Chemical Vapor Deposition
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most useful method for the deposition of a wide variety of thin films 
in semiconductor device fabrication. CVD is used to deposit, for example, polysilicon for gate conductor, silica 
glass, doped silica glass such as borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) and phosphosilicate glass (PSG), silicon nitride 
for dielectric films, and tungsten, tungsten silicide, and titanium nitride for conducting films. Other emerging 
dielectrics such as high-dielectric-constant materials (e.g., hafnium silicate), low-dielectric-constant materials (e.g., 
carbon-doped silicate glass), and conductors (e.g., copper barrier/tantalum nitride, copper, ruthenium) can also be 
deposited by CVD.
There are three commonly used deposition methods: atmospheric-pressure CVD, low-pressure CVD 
(LPCVD), and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD, or plasma deposition). The reactor for 
atmospheric-pressure CVD is similar to the one shown in Fig. 2, except that different gases are used at the gas 
inlet. LPCVD is a CVD process operated at subatmospheric pressures. Reduced pressures can reduce unwanted 
gas-phase reactions and improve film uniformity across the wafer. However, it suffers from low deposition
400 Semiconductors

Fig. 9 Schematic diagrams of chemical-vapor deposition reactors. (a) Hot-wall LPCVD reactor.  
(b) Parallel-plate rf (radio frequency) plasma deposition reactor.4 
rates. In a hot-wall LPCVD reactor as shown in Fig. 9a, the quartz tube is heated by a three-zone furnace, and 
gas is introduced at one end and pumped out at the opposite end. The semiconductor wafers are held vertically in 
a slotted quartz boat.4 The quartz tube wall is hot because it is adjacent to the furnace, in contrast to a cold-wall 
reactor such as the horizontal epitaxial reactor, which uses radio frequency (rf) heating. The choice of a hot-wall 
or cold-wall reactor depends on whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. For the exothermic reaction, 
the deposition rate is lower with increasing temperature. These processes require a hot-wall reactor. However, in a 
cold-wall reactor, deposition would occur on the cooler reactor walls. Consequently, for the endothermic reaction, 
a cold-wall reactor is used. The deposition rate is higher on the substrates with higher temperatures.
PECVD is an energy-enhanced CVD method in which plasma energy is added to the thermal energy 
of a conventional CVD system. The parallel-plate, radial-flow PECVD reactor shown in Fig. 9b consists of 
a cylindrical glass or aluminum chamber sealed with aluminum endplates. Inside are two parallel aluminum 
electrodes. An rf voltage is applied to the upper electrode, whereas the lower electrode is grounded. The rf voltage 
causes a plasma discharge between the electrodes. Wafers are placed on the lower electrode, which is heated 
to between 100° and 400oC by resistance heaters. The reaction gases flow through the discharge from inlets 
located along the circumference of the lower electrode. The main advantage of this reactor is its low deposition 
temperature. However, its capacity is limited, especially for large-diameter wafers, and the wafers may become 
contaminated if loosely adhering deposits fall on them.
The substrate surface not only receives active precursors but is subject to the bombardment of charged 
species. The short-lived active species react and deposit on the surface, while the thermal energy and ion 
bombardment continue to modify the deposited materials. The plasma-enhanced deposited films tend to be of 
smaller grain size or even amorphous, and contain amounts of impurities such as hydrogen, carbon or halide 
atoms.
Film Formation 401

The combination of low temperature, self-cleaning capability, and versatile film tunability has assured the 
importance of PECVD in the semiconductor industry. To minimize deposits on the reactor surfaces, limiting 
the plasma area is beneficial. The standard parallel-plate configuration provides an efficient design to focus the 
deposition on the wafer. At the same time, the reactor’s plasma capability also provides the potential for in-situ 
plasma cleaning by introducing etchant cleaning gases such as C2F6 or NF3 to remove silicon dioxide and silicon 
nitride deposition from chamber surfaces. One limitation of plasma deposition involves the potential charge 
imbedded in the film.
To overcome charge damage and still maintain the advantages of a low-temperature process, remote plasma 
instead of in-situ plasma is used. Reactants are plasma dissociated or activated remotely, then introduced onto the 
substrate surface along with second reactants to complete the reaction. But one has to consider the short lifetime 
of the activated species and how to distribute them over the large substrate surface. There is one closely related 
successful example, TEOS/O3. Fortunately, the O3 is stable enough and the concentration can be high enough to 
produce a reasonable silica deposition rate and provide good step coverage.
CVD Processes 
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a method of forming a thin solid film on a substrate by the reaction of 
vapor-phase chemicals that contain the required constituents. The CVD process can be generalized in a sequence 
of steps. (1) Reactants are introduced into the reactor; (2) Gas species are activated and dissociated by mixing, 
heating, plasma, or other means; (3) Reactive species are adsorbed on the substrate surface; (4) Adsorbed species 
undergo chemical reaction or react with other incoming species to form a solid film; (5) Reaction byproducts are 
desorbed from the substrate surface; (6) Reaction byproducts are removed from the reactor.
Although film growth is primarily accomplished at step 4, the overall growth rate is controlled by steps 1-6 
in series. The slowest step determines the final growth rate. As in any typical chemical kinetics, the determining 
factors are the concentrations of surface species, wafer temperature, and incoming charged species and their 
energies. Chemical vapor deposition process parameters must be finely adjusted to meet all the film properties and 
production requirements. 
12.2.2 Silicon Dioxide
CVD silicon dioxide does not replace thermally grown oxides because the best electrical properties are obtained 
with thermally grown films. CVD oxides are used instead to complement thermal oxides. A layer of undoped 
silicon dioxide is used to insulate multilevel metallization, to mask ion implantation and diffusion, and to increase 
the thickness of thermally grown field oxides. Phosphorus-doped silicon dioxide is used both as an insulator 
between metal layers and as a final passivation layer over devices. Oxides doped with phosphorus, arsenic, or 
boron are used occasionally as diffusion sources.
Deposition Methods
Silicon dioxide films can be deposited by several methods. For low-temperature deposition (300°-500°C), the films 
are formed by reacting silane (SiH4), dopant, and oxygen. The chemical reactions for phosphorus-doped oxides are

The deposition process can be performed either at atmospheric pressure CVD or at LPCVD (Fig. 9a). The low 
deposition temperature of the silane-oxygen reaction makes it a suitable process when films must be deposited over 
a layer of aluminum.
For intermediate-temperature deposition (500°-800°C), silicon dioxide can be formed by decomposing 
tetraethylorthosilicate, Si(OC2H5)4, in an LPCVD reactor. The compound, abbreviated TEOS, is vaporized from a 
liquid source. The TEOS compound decomposes as follows:

forming both SiO2 and a mixture of organic and organosilicon byproducts. Although the higher temperature 
required for the reaction prevents its use over aluminum, it is suitable for polysilicon gates requiring a uniform 
insulating layer with good step coverage. The good step coverage is a result of enhanced surface mobility at higher 
temperatures. The oxides can be doped by adding small amounts of the dopant hydrides (phosphines, arsine, or 
diborane), similar to the process in epitaxial growth.
The deposition rate as a function of temperature varies as e-Ea/kT, where Ea is the activation energy. The  
Ea of the silane-oxygen reaction is quite low: about 0.6 eV for undoped oxides and almost zero for  
phosphorus-doped oxide. In contrast, Ea for the TEOS reaction is much higher: about 1.9 eV for undoped  
oxide and 1.4 eV when phosphorus doping compounds are present. The dependence of the deposition rate 
on TEOS partial pressure is proportional to (1–e p p
/
0 ), where P is the TEOS partial pressure and P0 is 
about 30 Pa. At low TEOS partial pressures, the deposition rate is determined by the rate of the surface reaction. 
At high partial pressures, the surface becomes nearly saturated with adsorbed TEOS and the deposition rate 
becomes essentially independent of TEOS pressure.4
Recently, atmospheric-pressure and low-temperature CVD processes using TEOS and ozone (O3) have been 
proposed.5 This CVD technology produces oxide films with high conformality and low viscosity at low deposition 
temperatures. Because of their porosity, TEOS/O3 CVD oxides are often accompanied by plasma-assisted oxides 
to permit planarization in ULSI processing.
For high-temperature deposition (900°C), silicon dioxide is formed by reacting dichlorosilane, SiCl2H2, with 
nitrous oxide at reduced pressure:

This deposition gives excellent film uniformity and is sometimes used to deposit insulating layers over polysilicon.
Properties of Silicon Dioxide
Deposition methods and properties of silicon dioxide films are listed4 in Table 1. In general, there is a direct 
correlation between deposition temperature and film quality. At higher temperatures, deposited oxide films are 
structurally similar to silicon dioxide that has been thermally grown. 
The lower densities occur in films deposited below 500°C. Heating deposited silicon dioxide at temperatures 
between 600° and 1000°C causes densification, during which the oxide thickness decreases whereas the density 
increases to 2.2 g/cm3. The refractive index of silicon dioxide is 1.46 at a wavelength of 0.6328 μm. Oxides with 
lower indices are porous, such as the oxide from the silane-oxygen deposition, which has a refractive index of 
1.44. The porous nature of the oxide also is responsible for the lower dielectric strength and hence a higher 
leakage current in the oxide film. The etch rates of oxides in a hydrofluoric acid solution depend on deposition 
temperature, annealing history, and dopant concentration. Usually higher-quality oxides are etched at lower rates.

Step Coverage
Step coverage relates the surface topography of a deposited film to the various steps on the semiconductor 
substrate. Step coverage is one of the main advantages of the CVD method, especially compared with PVD. To 
get good step coverage, the inherent chemistries and operating conditions are critical. In the illustration of ideal, or 
conformal, step coverage shown in Fig. 10a, film thickness is uniform along all surfaces of the step. The uniformity 
of the film thickness, regardless of topography, is due to the rapid migration of reactants after adsorption on the 
step surfaces.6
Figure 10b shows an example of nonconformal step coverage, which results when the reactants adsorb and 
react without significant surface migration. In this instance, the deposition rate is proportional to the arrival angle of 
the gas molecules. Reactants arriving along the top horizontal surface come from many different angles and ϕ1, the 
arrival angle, varies in two dimensions from 0 to 180°, whereas reactants arriving at the top of a vertical wall have an 
arrival angle ϕ2 that varies from 0° to 90°. Thus, the film thickness on the top surface is double that on a wall surface. 
Further down the wall, ϕ3 is related to the width of the opening, and the film thickness is proportional to
 
φ3 ≅arctan W
l , 
(19)
where l is the distance from the top surface and W is the width of the opening. This type of step coverage is thin 
along the vertical walls, with a possible crack at the bottom of step caused by self-shadowing.
Silicon dioxide formed by TEOS decomposition at reduced pressure gives a nearly conformal coverage due 
to rapid surface migration. Similarly, the high-temperature dichlorosilane-nitrous oxide reaction also results in 
conformal coverage. However, during silane-oxygen deposition, no surface migration takes place and the step 
coverage is determined by the arrival angle. Most evaporated or sputtered materials have a step coverage similar to 
that in Fig. 10b.
P-Glass Flow
A smooth topography is usually required for the deposited silicon dioxide used as an insulator between metal 
layers. If the oxide used to cover the lower metal layer is concave, circuit failure may result from an opening 
that may occur in the upper metal layer during deposition. Because phosphorus-doped silicon dioxide (P-glass) 
deposited at low temperatures becomes soft and flows upon heating, it provides a smooth surface and is often used 
to insulate adjacent metal layers. This process is called P-glass flow. In addition, the phosphorus can further getter 
sodium to prevent its penetration to sensitive gate areas.
Figure 11 shows four cross sections of scanning-electron-microscope photographs of P-glass covering a 
polysilicon step.6 All samples are heated in steam at 1100°C for 20 min. Figure 11a shows a sample of glass that 
contains a negligibly small amount of phosphorus and does not flow. Note the concavity of the film and that 
the corresponding angle θ is about 120°. Figures 11b, 11c, and 11d show samples of P-glass with progressively 
higher phosphorus contents up to 7.2 wt% (weight percent). In these samples the decreasing step angles of the 
P-glass layer indicate how flow increases with phosphorus concentration. P-glass flow depends on annealing time, 
temperature, phosphorus concentration, and the annealing ambient.6

(20)
If we want an angle smaller than 45° we require a phosphorus concentration larger than 6 wt%. However, at 
concentrations above 8 wt%, the metal film (e.g., aluminum) may be corroded by the acid products formed during 
the reaction between the phosphorus in the oxide and atmospheric moisture. Therefore, the P-glass flow process 
uses phosphorus concentrations of 6–8 wt%.
The efficiency of dopant incorporation is controlled by the decomposition mechanism of the dopant sources. 
In the thermal process, temperature is the dominant factor. In the plasma-enhanced process, the temperature 
dependence is much less, and plasma power is much more critical. 
12.2.3 Silicon Nitride
It is difficult to grow silicon nitride by thermal nitridation (e.g., with ammonia, NH3) because of its low  
growth rate and high growth temperature. However, silicon nitride films can be deposited by an  
intermediate-temperature (750°C) LPCVD process or a low-temperature (300°C) plasma-assisted CVD  
process.7,8 The LPCVD films are of stoichiometric composition (Si3N4) with high density (2.9–3.1 g/cm3).  
These films can be used to passivate devices because they serve as good barriers to the diffusion of water  
and sodium. The films also can be used as masks for the selective oxidation of silicon because silicon  
nitride oxidizes very slowly and prevents the underlying silicon from oxidizing. The films deposited by  
plasma-assisted CVD are not stoichiometric and have a lower density (2.4–2.8 g/cm3). Because of the low 
Film Formation 405

deposition temperature, silicon nitride films can be deposited over fabricated devices and serve as their final 
passivation. The plasma-deposited nitride provides excellent scratch protection, serves as a moisture barrier, and 
prevents sodium diffusion.
In the LPCVD process, dichlorosilane and ammonia react at reduced pressure to deposit silicon nitride at 
temperatures between 700° and 800°C. The reaction is

(21)
Good film uniformity and high wafer throughput (the number of wafers processed per hour) are advantages of the 
reduced-pressure process. As in oxide deposition, silicon nitride deposition is controlled by temperature, pressure, and 
reactant concentration. The activation energy for deposition is about 1.8 eV. The deposition rate increases with increasing 
total pressure or dichlorosilane partial pressure and decreases with increasing ammonia-to-dichlorosilane ratio.
Silicon nitride deposited by LPCVD is an amorphous dielectric containing up to 8 atomic percent 
(at%) hydrogen. The etch rate in buffered HF is less than 1 nm/min. The film has a very high tensile stress of 
approximately 1010 dynes/cm2, which is nearly 10 times that of TEOS-deposited SiO2. Films thicker than 200 nm 
may crack because of the very high stress. The resistivity of silicon nitride at room temperature is about 1016 Ω-cm. 
Its dielectric constant is 7 and its dielectric strength is 107 V/cm.
In the plasma-assisted CVD process, silicon nitride is formed either by reacting silane and ammonia in an 
argon plasma or by reacting silane in a nitrogen discharge. The plasma dissociates the precursors and creates 
high-energy forms of the reactant species that accelerate the reaction rate at a much lower temperature. Ions and 
electrons are charged species associated with plasma. The reactions are as follows:

(22b)
The products depend strongly on deposition conditions. The radial-flow pallel-plate reactor (Fig. 9b) is used 
to deposit the films. The deposition rate generally increases with increasing temperature, power input, and reactant 
gas pressure.
Large concentrations of hydrogen are contained in plasma-deposited films. The plasma nitride (also referred to 
as SiN) used in semiconductor processing generally contains 20-25 at% hydrogen. Films with low tensile stress (~2 
× 109 dynes/cm2) can be prepared by plasma deposition. Film resistivities range from 105 to 1021 Ω-cm, depending 
on silicon-to-nitrogen ratio, whereas dielectric strengths are between 1 × 106 and 6 × 106 V/cm. For passivation, the 
films must be a moisture and sodium diffusion barrier with good step coverage and no pinholes. Silicon nitride is an 
ideal material for a passivation layer, but high-temperature thermally deposited nitride exceeds the temperature for Al 
metallization and the hydrogen content in lower temperature PECVD nitride can cause a degradation in hot carrier 
lifetime.
12.2.4 Low-Dielectric-Constant Materials
As devices continue to scale down to the deep submicron region, they require multilevel interconnection architecture 
to minimize the time delay due to parasitic resistance R and capacitance C. The gain in device speed at the gate level 
will be offset by the propagation delay at the metal interconnects because of the increased RC time constant, as 
shown in Fig. 12. For example, in devices with gate length of 250 nm or less, up to 50% of the time delay is due to 
the RC delay of long interconnections.9 Therefore, the device interconnection network becomes a limiting factor in 
determining chip performance by affecting device speed, cross talk, and power consumption of ULSI circuits.    
To reduce the RC time constant of ULSI circuits, interconnection materials with low resistivity and  
interlayer films with low capacitance are required. For low-capacitance (C = εi A/d, where εi is the dielectric 
permittivity, A the area, and d the thickness of the dielectric film), it is not easy to lower the parasitic  
capacitance by increasing the thickness d of the interlayer dielectric (which makes gap filling more  
difficult), or decreasing wiring height and area A (which results in the increase of interconnect resistance).  
Therefore, materials with a low dielectric constant (low k) are required. The εi is equal to the product of k  
and εo, where k and εo are the dielectric constant and the vacuum permittivity, respectively.
406 Semiconductors

Fig. 12 Calculated gate and interconnect delay versus generation technology. The dielectric constant for the low-k 
material is 2.0. Both Al and Cu interconnects are 0.8 μm thick and 43 μm long. 
Material Options
The properties of the interlayer dielectric film and how they are formed have to meet the following requirements: 
low dielectric constant, low residual stress, high planarization capability, high capability for gap filling, low 
deposition temperature, process simplicity, and ease of integration.
A substantial number of low-k materials have been synthesized for the intermetal dielectric in ULSI circuits. 
Some of the promising low-k materials are shown in Table 2. These materials can be either inorganic or organic 
and can be deposited by either CVD or spin-on techniques.9 CVD technique offers process flexibility. Bulk film 
and interface film properties can be easily altered in CVD processes by the adjustment of the process gas flow ratio 
or other process parameters, while those prepared by a spin-on technique can be changed only by modifying the 
precursor chemistry.
Basically, low-k materials are Si- and C-based, with very different characteristics. C-based materials (e.g., 
PAE, SiLK) generally have lower k values. Si-based materials (e.g., FSG, black diamond, HSQ, Xerogel) usually 
have higher thermal stability and hardness than C-based materials, but Si-based materials tend to be more 
prone to moisture absorption. Si-based materials are much more compatible with integration issues: adhesion to 
dielectrics and metals is better and they are easily etched with F-based etching chemistry and are more compatible 
with CMP processing.
Fluorine is one of the most electronegative elements. F in the silicate network would tie up electron density 
around itself, making the overall film less polarizable and hence reducing the dielectric constant.
There appear to be two possible migration paths for the future. The first is to continue with Si-based materials 
and introduce additional porosity into the film to reduce k. Possible disadvantages include lower mechanical 
strength and moisture absorption due to the porosity. The second path is to switch to C-based organic materials, 
which generally have lower k than Si-based materials. Which path will prevail depends on whether Si-based 
materials can prove extensibility to k < 2.0 or if the integration difficulties of C-based materials cannot be resolved 
in cost-effective ways.

12.2.5 High-Dielectric–Constant Materials
High-k materials are required for ULSI circuits, especially for dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The 
storage capacitor in a DRAM has to maintain a certain value of capacitance for proper operation (e.g., 40 fF). For 
a given capacitance (εiA/d), usually a minimum d is selected to meet the conditions of maximum allowed leakage 
current and minimum required breakdown voltage. The area of the capacitor can be increased by using stacked or 
trench structures. These structures are considered in Chapter 15. However, for a planar structure, area A is reduced 
with increasing DRAM density. Therefore, the dielectric constant of the film must be increased.
Several high-k materials have been proposed, such as barium strontium titanate (BST) and lead zirconium 
titanate (PZT). They are shown in Table 3. In addition, there are titanates doped with one or more acceptors, 
such as alkaline earth metals, or doped with one or more donors, such as rare earth elements. The tantalum oxide 
(Ta2O5) has a dielectric constant in a range of 20–30.

As a reference, the dielectric constant of Si3N4 is in a range of 6–7 and that of SiO2 is 3.9. A Ta2O5 film can be 
deposited by a CVD process using gaseous TaC15 and H2O as the starting materials.
A Ta2O5 film can also be deposited by a thermal CVD process using metal-organic precursors, tantalum 
ethoxide (TAETO) or tantalum tetraethoxy dimethylaminoethoxide (TATDMAE), as the starting materials. For 
good step coverage the deposition process has to be carried out in the reaction-rate limited region. As-deposited 
TaOx film is oxygen deficient and resistive in nature. Oxygen annealing of this film is essential for it to act as an 
effective dielectric material.

A DRAM capacitor has the following parameters: capacitance C = 40 fF, cell size A = 1.28 μm2, and dielectric 
constant k = 3.9 for silicon dioxide. If we replace SiO2 with Ta2O5 (k = 25) without changing the thickness, what is

12.3 CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION OF POLYSILICON
Using polysilicon as the gate electrode in MOS devices is a significant development in MOS technology. One 
important reason is that polysilicon surpasses aluminum in electrode reliability. Figure 13 shows the maximum 
time to breakdown for capacitors with polysilicon and aluminum electrodes.10 The polysilicon is clearly superior,
Film Formation 409

Fig. 13 Maximum time to breakdown versus oxide thickness for a polysilicon electrode and an aluminum electrode.10
especially for thinner gate oxides. The inferior time to breakdown of aluminum electrode is 
due to the migration of aluminum atoms into the thin oxide under an electrical field. Polysilicon is also used as 
a diffusion source to create shallow junctions and to ensure ohmic contact to crystalline silicon. Additional uses 
include the manufacture of conductors and high-value resistors.
A low-pressure reactor (Fig. 9a) operated between 600° and 650°C is used to deposit polysilicon by pyrolyzing 
silane according to the following reaction:
 
SiH
Si
2H

⎯⎯

. 
(23)
Of the two most common low-pressure processes, one operates at a pressure of 25–130 Pa using 100% silane, 
whereas the other process involves a diluted mixture of 20%–30% silane in nitrogen at the same total pressure. Both 
processes can deposit polysilicon on hundreds of wafers per run with good uniformity (i.e., thickness within 5%)
Figure 14 shows the deposition rate at four deposition temperatures. At low silane partial pressure, the 
deposition rate is proportional to the silane pressure.4 At higher silane concentrations, saturation of the deposition 
rate occurs. Deposition at reduced pressure is generally limited to temperatures between 600° and 650°C. In this 
temperature range, the deposition rate varies as exp (–Ea /kT), where the activation energy Ea is 1.7 eV, which is 
essentially independent of the total pressure in the reactor. At higher temperatures, gas-phase reactions that result 
in a rough, loosely adhering deposit become significant and silane depletion will occur, causing poor uniformity. 
At temperatures much lower than 600°C, the deposition rate is too slow to be practical.
Process parameters that affect the polysilicon structure are deposition temperature, dopants, and the 
heat cycle applied following the deposition step. A columnar structure results when polysilicon is deposited at 
temperatures of 600°–650°C. This structure is comprised of polycrystalline grains ranging in size from 0.03 to 0.3 
μm at a preferred orientation of (110). When phosphorus is diffused at 950°C, the structure changes to crystallite 
and the grain size increases to between 0.5 and 1.0 μm. When the temperature is increased to 1050°C during 
oxidation, the grains reach a final size of 1–3 μm. Although the initially deposited film appears amorphous
410 Semiconductors

Fig. 14 Effect of silane concentration on the polysilicon deposition rate.4
when deposition occurs below 600°C, growth characteristics similar to the polycrystalline-grain columnar structure 
are observed after doping and heating.
Polysilicon can be doped by diffusion, ion implantation, or the addition of dopant gases during deposition, 
referred to as in-situ doping. The implantation method is most commonly used because of its lower processing 
temperatures. Figure 15 shows the sheet resistance of single crystal silicon and of 500 nm polysilicon doped 
with phosphorus and antimony using ion implantation.11 The ion implantation process is considered in Chapter 
14. Implant dose, annealing temperature, and annealing time all influence the sheet resistance of implanted 
polysilicon. Carrier traps at the grain boundaries cause a very high resistance in the lightly implanted polysilicon. 
As Fig. 15 illustrates, resistance drops rapidly, approaching that of implanted single crystal silicon, as the carrier 
traps become saturated with dopants.

12.4 ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a special chemical vapor deposition technique that is capable of depositing 
thin films of the order of a monolayer. ALD has emerged as an important method for nano-device fabrication, 
particularly for conformal coating on device structures with high aspect ratios from 20 - 100:1 at feature size below 
100 nm.
ALD differs from conventional CVD in that CVD uses a continuous supply of chemical reactants that coexist 
in space and time above the semiconductor substrate. ALD uses sequential exposures of chemical reactants, each 
reactant having self-limiting deposition separated in time. In CVD, chemical reactions occur in the gas phase or on 
the substrate; but in ALD, chemical reactions take place only on the substrate and can prevent gas-phase reactions. 
ALD is operated at low pressure. In an ALD binary thin film deposition, there are two sequential reactions.
 
Reaction 1    AX + S(sub) →" r 4(sub) + X(g)
3FBDUJPO 
#:  " r 4(sub) →#" r 4(sub) + Y(g) 
where AX is precursor 1, BY is precursor 2, S(sub) is the substrate, and X(g),Y(g) are residuals.                  
A typical ALD cycle is shown in Fig. 16:
 1. Expose precursor 1 for time (tex1) to carry out the first surface reaction.
 2. Removal (purge) time (tr1) of the unused precursor and reaction products of reaction 1.
 3. Expose precursor 2 for time (tex2) to carry out the second surface reaction.
 4. Removal (purge) time (tr2) of the unused precursor and reaction products of reaction 2.
The cycle time can be as short as a fraction of a second or as long as a few minutes. The processes are repeated 
to build the film. The cycle time is defined as the sum of exposure and removal periods. Like CVD, ALD may be 
carried out by thermal reactions or by plasma-assisted processes.
We take the ALD-Al2O3 as an example to depict ALD growth processes. Figure 17 illustrates the two 
sequential reactions of ALD-Al2O3 using Al(CH3)3) (trimethylaluminum-TMA) as precursor 1 and H2O as 
precursor 2.12 Silicon is used as the substrate. The two sequential reactions of ALD-Al2O3 are:

The reactions are repeated to build the ALD-Al2O3 film. The “ALD window” is the temperature range in 
which the deposition rate (Å/cycle) is a constant, independent of the deposition temperature, as shown in Fig. 
18. At lower temperatures, there is insufficient energy to achieve a complete chemical reaction. The chemical 
adsorption-reaction dominates and the deposition rate increases with temperature. At higher temperatures, a 
region of desorption dominates and the deposition rate decreases with temperature.
A non-ALD deposition associated with condensation phenomena is shown at the upper left at lower 
temperatures. Additionally, deposition by pyrolytic CVD from the decomposition of precursors at higher 
temperatures is shown in the upper right. The deposition rates of these processes may be higher than that of the 
ALD process.

Film Formation 413

In ALD, film thickness depends only on the number of reaction cycles, which makes thickness control 
accurate and simple. There is less need of reactant flux homogeneity than in CVD. Therefore, ALD can give large 
area (large batch and easy scale-up) capability and excellent conformality and reproducibility. ALD can be used to 
deposit several types of thin films, including oxides (e.g., Al2O3, TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, HfO2), metal nitrides (e.g. TiN, 
TaN, WN, NbN), metals (e.g. Ru, Ir, Pt), and metal sulfides (e.g. ZnS). ALD has potentials in three mainstream 
applications: capacitors, gates, and interconnects. The major limitation of ALD is its low deposition rate; usually 
only a fraction of a monolayer is deposited in one cycle. Fortunately, the films needed for future-generation ICs are 
very thin and thus ALD’s low deposition rate is not such an important issue.
 
12.5 METALLIZATION
12.5.1 Physical-Vapor Deposition
The primary semiconductor applications of physical-vapor deposition (PVD) technology are the deposition of 
metal and compounds such as Ti, Al, Cu, TiN, and TaN for lines, pads, vias, contacts, and related connections that 
are used to connect with the junctions and devices on the Si wafer surface.
The most common methods of PVD of metals are evaporation, e-beam evaporation, plasma spray 
deposition, and sputtering. Evaporation occurs when a source material is heated above its melting point in an 
evacuated chamber. The evaporated atoms then travel at high velocity in straight-line trajectories. The source can 
be made molten by resistance heating, by rf heating, or with a focused electron beam. Evaporation and e-beam 
evaporation were used extensively in earlier generations of integrated circuits, but they have been replaced for 
ULSI circuits by sputtering due to its volatility and high film quality.
Sputtering involves the transport of material from a target to a substrate. It is accomplished by the 
bombardment of the target surface with gas ions, typically Ar but occasionally other inert gas species (Ne, Kr) or 
reactive species such as oxygen or nitrogen. Particles of atomic dimension from the target are ejected as a result 
of momentum transfer between incident ions and the target, as shown in Fig. 19. The process is analogous to the 
action of a billiard ball hitting another billiard ball.
There are basically two kinds of sputtering systems, dc and rf sputtering. The dc (direct current) sputtering is 
usually used for metal film deposition. Figure 20a shows the standard sputtering system. There are two electrodes 
in the dc sputtering system. As a negative dc bias is applied directly on the cathode electrode of the metal 
target, the stray electrons accelerate and gain energy from the electric field to bombard Ar neutral atoms. If the 
bombarding electrons have sufficiently higher energy than the argon ionization energy (i.e., 15.7 eV), Ar is ionized 
and plasma is created. The positive argon ions in plasma are accelerated toward the metal target and sputter metal 
atoms off. The glow region of the plasma is a good conductor. At the start of Ar gas breakdown, the voltage 
between the two electrodes drops and hardly sustains a high field for the generation of plasma. The secondary 
electrons emitted from the metal target during sputtering sustain the plasma.
For semiconductor applications, a magnetron sputtering based on the variation of dc sputtering has higher 
efficiency. The cathode in magnetron sputtering differs from a conventional planar cathode in that there is a local 
magnetic field parallel to the cathode surface. The effect of the tangential magnetic field can move the emitted 
secondary electrons to the cathode surface. These electrons are trapped close to the cathode region and can lead to 
very high levels of gas ionization, which increases the ion density and hence, the sputter-deposition rate.
Directional Deposition
Contact holes with large aspect ratio are difficult to fill with material, mainly because scattering events cause the 
top opening of the hole to seal before appreciable material has deposited on its floor. The fundamental problem 
of putting atoms into a deep feature can be solved by enhanced directionality of the atoms as they are deposited. 
There are two ways to enhance sputtering directionality: long-throw sputtering and collimated sputtering.
414 Semiconductors

Fig. 19 Schematic of sputtering process.
Fig. 20 (a) Standard sputtering, (b) long-throw sputtering, and (c) sputtering with a collimator.
Long-Throw Sputtering
By moving the sample farther away from the cathode for “long-throw” sputter deposition, as shown in Fig. 20b, 
an increasing fraction of the sputtered atoms is lost onto the sidewall of the chamber. This fraction is mainly 
determined by the target-to-substrate separation, dts, and scattering of the flux by the working gas. The larger 
dts is, the wider the angular distribution. The atoms arriving at the substrate are more likely to be closer to 
normal incidence than the conventional, short-throw deposition. The throw distance of the “long-throw” sputter 
deposition needs to be on the order of the cathode diameter. The process is limited in a practical sense by the gas 
scattering, which is associated with the operating pressure of the system. To reduce in-flight scattering, the mean 
free path for the sputtered atoms should exceed the throw distance. For “long-throw” sputtering deposition, the 
working pressure is very low (less than 0.1 Pa), again to reduce in-flight scattering. At such a low pressure, gas 
scattering is less important and the dts can be greatly increased. This allows more deposits at the bottom of high-
aspect features such as contact holes.
Collimated Sputtering
In a long-mean-free-path deposition environment (mean free path > throw distance), geometric filtering of the 
deposition flux can be obtained by placing a collimator between the target and the sample. The collimator serves 
as a simple directional filter by collecting the atoms that impinge on its walls, as shown schematically in Figure 
20c. The degree of filtering is simply a function of the aspect ratio of the collimator, where aspect ratio is defined 
as the thickness of the collimator divided by the diameter of a tube. 
Film Formation 415

Fig. 21 Schematic diagram of RF sputtering.
RF sputtering
Rf (radio-frequency, typically 13.56 MHz, a frequency chosen because of its non-interference with radio-
transmitted signals) sputtering is usually used in cases of dielectric materials, such as the high-k  dielectrics. Figure 
21 shows the standard rf sputtering system. Its has several advantages: (a) its ability to sputter dielectrics as well 
as metals, (b) its ability to operate in the bias-sputtering mode, and (c) its ability to permit sputter-etching of 
substrates prior to deposition. When a time-varying potential is applied to a metal plate behind the dielectric target 
in rf sputtering, another time-varying potential is developed on the opposite target surface through the impedance 
of the target. Once the gas is broken down by the acceleration of stray electrons from the electric field to start a 
discharge, the current can flow from the plasma to the target surface. Since electrons are more mobile than positive 
ions, more electrons are attracted to the front surface of the target during the positive half cycle than are positive 
ions in the negative half cycle. Therefore, the current is larger in the positive cycle than that in the negative cycle, as 
in a diode. The resultant electron current causes the target surface to acquire an increasingly negative bias voltage 
during successive cycles until the negative average dc voltage is sufficiently high to retard the electrons’ arrival, so 
that the net charge arriving at the target surface is zero.
Since the target potential is negative with respect to the plasma, electrons are forced away from the surface, 
yielding an ion sheath that is visible as a dark space (because there is no optical emission from the recombination 
of electrons and ions) near the target surface. Positive ions in the sheath are accelerated toward the target by the 
negative potential. To prevent accumulation of excessive positive ions at the target surface, the frequency of the 
applied voltage must be high. The frequency must be at least 106 Hz for any appreciable sputtering to occur. Below 
this frequency, the average energy of the ions is reduced significantly as a result of positive ions accumulating on 
the target. 
RF-sputter etching is the reverse of the sputtering process, and is also known as back sputtering, reverse 
sputtering, ion etching, or sputter cleaning. The normal rf power flow is electrically reversed; the substrate has 
a negative average dc voltage and an anode takes the place of the target. RF-sputter etching is used to clean 
substrates prior to sputtering a film on them, or to make patterns on substrates. 
Bias-sputtering is the bombardment by energetic positive ions of a growing film that has a negative bias. This 
technology can remove impurities on the growing film. Usually, it is used for substrate surface cleaning before 
dielectric film deposition.
12.5.2 CVD Metal Deposition 
CVD is attractive for metallization because it offers coatings that are conformal, has good step coverage, and 
can coat a large number of wafers at a time. The basic CVD setup is the same as that used for the deposition of 
dielectrics and polysilicon (see Fig. 9a). Low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) is capable of producing conformal step 
coverage over a wider range of topographical profiles, often with lower electrical resistivity than that from PVD.
One of the major new applications of CVD metal deposition for integrated circuits is in the area of 
refractory-metal deposition. For example, tungsten’s low electrical resistivity (5.3 μΩ-cm) and its refractory nature 
make it a desirable metal for use in integrated circuits.
416 Semiconductors

CVD Tungsten
Tungsten is used both as a contact plug and as a first-level metal. The CVD tungsten film is known for its excellent 
step coverage. For contact or via holes with size < 0.8 μm and aspect ratios greater than two, it is difficult to use 
conventional Al sputtering for continuous coating inside the feature and maintain the electrical performance. The 
effective via resistance and electromigration resistance have been improved by the introduction of CVD tungsten. 
The CVD tungsten process has been a key technology enabling multilevel interconnection metallization. 
Tungsten can be deposited by using WF6 as the W source gas, since it is a liquid that boils at room 
temperature. WF6 can be reduced by silicon, hydrogen, or silane. The basic chemistry for CVD-W is as follows:
 
WF6 + 3H2 → W + 6HF (hydrogen reduction), 
(24)
 
2WF6 + 3Si → 2W + 3SiF4 (silicon reduction), 
(25)
 
2WF6 + 3SiH4 → 2W + 3SiF4 + 6H2 (silane reduction). 
(26)
On a Si contact, the selective process starts from a silicon reduction process. This process provides a 
nucleation layer of W grown on Si but not on SiO2. The hydrogen reduction process can deposit W rapidly on the 
nucleation layer, forming the plug. The hydrogen reduction process provides excellent conformal coverage of the 
topography. This process, however, does not have perfect selectivity, and the HF gas by-product of the reaction is 
responsible for the encroachment of the oxide, as well as for the rough surface of deposited W films.
The silane reduction process gives a high deposition rate and much smaller W grain size than that obtained 
with the hydrogen reduction process. In addition, the problems of encroachment and rough W surface are 
eliminated because there is no HF by-product. Usually, a silane reduction process is used as the first step in blanket 
W deposition to serve as a nucleation layer and to reduce junction damage. After the silane reduction process, 
hydrogen reduction is used to grow the blanket W layer.
CVD TiN
Titanium nitride (TiN) is widely used as a diffusion barrier-metal layer in metallization and has numerous 
applications: (1) a cladding layer in Al metallization to enhance interconnection wiring electromigration resistance, 
(2) a CVD-W adhesion layer over oxide and a barrier against the interaction of WF6 with Al and Si, (3) local 
interconnection where Al metallization cannot bear the temperature, (4) a plate electrode for Ta2O5 capacitors, 
and (5) the node and plate electrodes for MIM (metal-insulator-metal) capacitors where the insulator is either an 
atomic-layer-deposited Al2O3 or HfO2/Al2O3 laminate.
TiN can be deposited by sputtering from a compound target or by CVD. The CVD TiN can provide better 
step coverage than PVD methods in deep submicron technology. CVD TiN can be deposited,13–15 using TiC14 with 
NH3, H2/N2, or NH3/H2:
 
6TiCl4+ 8NH3 → 6 TiN + 24HCl + N2, 
(27)
 
2TiCl4 + N2 + 4H2 → 2TiN + 8HCl, 
(28)
 
2TiCl4 + 2NH3 + H2 → 2 TiN + 8HCl. 
(29)
The deposition temperature is about 400°–700°C for NH3 reduction and is above 700°C for the H2/N2 reaction. The 
higher the deposition temperature, the better the TiN film and the less Cl incorporated in the TiN (~5%).
12.5.3 Aluminum Metallization
Aluminum and its alloys are used extensively for metallization in integrated circuits. The Al film can be deposited 
by a PVD or CVD method. Because aluminum and its alloys have low resistivities (2.7 μΩ-cm for Al and up to 3.5 
μΩ-cm for its alloys), these metals satisfy the low-resistance requirements. Aluminum also adheres well to silicon 
dioxide. However, the use of aluminum in integrated circuits with shallow junctions often creates problems such 
as spiking and electromigration. We consider the problems of aluminum metallization and their solutions in this 
section.
Film Formation 417

Fig. 22 Phase diagram of the aluminum-silicon system.16
Junction Spiking
Figure 22 shows the phase diagram of the A1-Si system at 1 atm.16 The phase diagram relates these two 
components as a function of temperature. The A1-Si system exhibits eutectic characteristics; that is, the addition 
of either component lowers the system’s melting point below that of either metal. Here, the minimum melting 
temperature, called the eutectic temperature, is 577°C, corresponding to a 11.3% Si and 88.7% A1 composition. 
The melting points of pure aluminum and pure silicon are 660°C and 1412°C, respectively. Because of the eutectic 
characteristics, during aluminum deposition the temperature on the silicon substrate must be limited to less than 
577°C.
The inset of Fig. 22 also shows the solid solubility of silicon in aluminum. For example, the solubility of 
silicon in aluminum is 0.25 wt% at 400°C, 0.5 wt% at 450°C, and 0.8 wt% at 500°C. Therefore, wherever aluminum 
contacts silicon, the silicon will dissolve into the aluminum during annealing. The amount of silicon dissolved 
will depend not only on the solubility at the annealing temperature but also on the volume of aluminum to be 
saturated with silicon. Consider a long aluminum metal line in contact with an area ZL of silicon as shown in 
Fig. 23. After an annealing time t, the silicon will diffuse a distance of approximately 
Dt  along the aluminum 
line from the edge of the contact, where D is the diffusion coefficient given by 4 × 10–2 exp(–0.92/kT) for silicon 
diffusion in deposited aluminum films. Assuming that this length of aluminum is completely saturated with silicon, 
the volume of silicon consumed is then

For T = 500°C, t = 30 min, ZL = 16 μm2, Z = 5 μm, and H = 1 μm. Find the depth b, assuming uniform 
dissolution.
SOLUTION The diffusion coefficient of silicon in aluminum at 500°C is about 2 ×10–8 cm2/s; thus, 
Dt   
is 60 μm. The density ratio is 2.7/2.33 = 1.16.

Aluminum will fill a depth of b = 0.35 μm from which silicon is consumed. If at the contact point there is a shallow 
junction whose depth is less than b, the diffusion of silicon into aluminum can short-circuit the junction. 
In a practical situation, the dissolution of silicon does not take place uniformly but rather at only a few points. 
The effective area in Eq. 31 is less than the actual contact area; hence b is much larger. Figure 24 illustrates the 
actual situation in the p–n junction area of aluminum penetrating the silicon at only the few points where spikes 
are formed. One way to minimize aluminum spiking is to add silicon to the aluminum by coevaporation until the 
amount of silicon contained by the alloy satisfies the solubility requirement. Another method is to introduce a 
barrier metal layer between the aluminum and the silicon substrate (Fig. 25). This barrier metal layer must meet 
the following requirements: it forms low contact resistance with silicon, it will not react with aluminum, and its 
deposition and formation are compatible with the overall process. Barrier metals such as titanium nitride (TiN) 
have been evaluated and found to be stable for contact annealing temperatures up to 550°C for 30 min.

gate electrode of silicide and polysilicon.
Electromigration
In Chapter 6 we discussed scaled-down devices. As the device becomes smaller, the corresponding current density 
becomes larger. High current densities can cause device failure due to electromigration, which refers to the 
transport of mass (i.e., atoms) in metals under the influence of current. It occurs by the transfer of momentum 
from the electrons to the positive metal ions. When a high current passes through thin metal conductors in 
integrated circuits, metal ions in some regions will pile up and voids will form in other regions. The pileup can 
short-circuit adjacent conductors, whereas the voids can result in an open circuit.
The mean time to failure (MTF) of a conductor due to electromigration can be related to the current density 
J and the activation energy Ea by

Experimentally, a value of Ea  ≅ 0.5 eV is obtained for deposited aluminum. This indicates that low-temperature 
grain-boundary diffusion is the primary vehicle of material transport, since Ea  ≅ 1.4 eV would characterize the self-
diffusion of single-crystal aluminum. The electromigration resistance of aluminum conductors can be increased by 
using several techniques, including alloying with copper (e.g., A1 with 0.5% Cu), encapsulating the conductor in a 
dielectric, or incorporating oxygen during film deposition.

12.5.4 Copper Metallization
It is well known that both high-conductivity wiring and low–dielectric-constant insulators are required to lower the 
RC time delay of the interconnect network. Copper is the obvious choice for a new interconnection metallization 
because it has higher conductivity and higher electromigration resistance than aluminum. Copper can be deposited 
by PVD, CVD, and electrochemical methods. However, the use of Cu as an alternative material to Al in ULSI 
circuits has drawbacks, such as its tendency to corrode under standard chip manufacture conditions, its lack of 
a feasible dry-etching method or a stable self-passivating oxide similar to Al2O3 on Al, and its poor adhesion to 
dielectric materials, such as SiO2 and low-k polymers. In this section, we discuss the copper metallization techniques.
Several different techniques for fabrication of multilevel Cu interconnects have been reported.18,19 The 
first method is a conventional method to pattern the metal lines followed by dielectric deposition. The second 
method is to pattern the dielectric layer first and fill copper metal into trenches. This step is followed by chemical 
mechanical polishing, discussed in Section 12.5.5, to remove the excess metal on the top surface of dielectric and 
leave Cu material in the vias and trenches. This method is also known as a damascene process.
Damascene Technology
The approach for fabricating a copper/low-k dielectric interconnect structure is by the “damascene” or “dual 
damascene” process. Figure 26 shows the dual damascene sequence for an advanced Cu interconnection structure. 
For a typical damascene structure, trenches for metal lines are defined and etched in the interlayer dielectric 
(ILD) and then followed by metal deposition of Ta(N)/Cu. The Ta(N) layer serves as a diffusion barrier layer and 
prevents copper from penetrating the low-k dielectric. The excess copper metal on the surface is removed to obtain 
a planar structure with metal inlays in the dielectric.
For the dual damascene process, the vias and trenches in the dielectric are defined using two lithography and 
reactive ion etching (RIE) steps before depositing the Ta(N)/Cu metal (Fig. 26a–c). Then a chemical-mechanical 
polishing process is used to remove the metal on the top surface, leaving the planarized wiring and via embedded 
in the insulator.20 One special benefit of dual damascene is that the via plug is now of the same material as the 
metal line and the risk of via electromigration failure is reduced.

If we replace Al with Cu wire associated with some low-k dielectric (k = 2.6) instead of SiO2 layer, what percentage 
of reduction of RC time constant will be achieved? (The resistivity of Al is 2.7 μΩ-cm, and the resistivity of Cu is 
1.7 μΩ-cm.)

12.5.5 Chemical-Mechanical Polishing
In recent years, the development of chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) has become increasingly important 
for multilevel interconnection because it is the only technology that allows global planarization (i.e., making a 
flat surface across the whole wafer). It offers many advantages over other types of technologies—better global 
planarization over large or small structures, reduced defect density, and reduced plasma damage. Three CMP 
approaches are summarized in Table 4.
The CMP process consists of moving the sample surface against a pad that carries slurry between the sample 
surface and the pad. Abrasive particles in the slurry cause mechanical damage on the sample surface, loosening 
the material for enhanced chemical attack or fracturing off pieces of surface into the slurry where they dissolve or 
are swept away. The process is tailored to provide an enhanced material removal rate from high points on surfaces, 
thus affecting the planarization because most chemical actions are isotropic.

(b) reactive ion etching dielectric and resist patterning; (c) trench and via definition; and (d) Cu deposition followed by 
chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP).
Mechanical grinding alone can theoretically achieve the desired planarization but is not desirable because of 
extensive associated damage to the material surfaces. There are three main parts of the process: the surface to be 
polished, the pad—the key medium enabling the transfer of mechanical action to the surface being polished—and 
the slurry, which provides both chemical and mechanical effects. Figure 27 shows the CMP setup. 21

The oxide removal rate and the removal rate of a layer underneath the oxide (called a stop layer) are 1r and 0.1r, 
respectively. To remove 1 μm oxide and 0.01 μm stop layer, the total removal time is 5.5 min. Find the oxide 
removal rate.

12.5.6 Silicide
Silicon forms many stable metallic and semiconducting compounds with metals called silicides. As the line width 
of these interconnections goes below 1 μm, the resistance of doped poly-Si (with a resistivity of the order of 500 
μΩ-cm) became unacceptable. Several metal silicides show low resisivity and high thermal stability, making them 
suitable for ULSI application. Silicides such as titanium silicide (TiSi2), cobalt silicide (CoSi2), and nickel silicide 
(NiSi) have reasonably low resistivities and are generally compatible with integrated-circuit processing. Silicides 
have become important metallization materials as devices have become smaller. One important application of 
silicide is for the MOSFET gate electrode, either alone or with doped polysilicon (polycide) above the gate oxide. 
In the following polycide and salicide processes, the presence of the poly-Si was necessary to keep the properties of 
the interface SiO2/poly-Si intact. Table 5 compares TiSi2 CoSi2 and NiSi.
Metal silicides have been used to reduce the contact resistance of the source and drain, the gate electrodes, 
and the interconnections. The self-aligned metal silicide technology (salicide) has been proven to be a highly 
attractive technique for improving the performance of submicron devices and circuits. The self-aligned process 
uses the silicide gate electrode as the mask to form the source and drain electrodes of a MOSFET (e.g., by ion 
implantation, considered in Chapter 14). This process can minimize the overlaps of these electrodes and thus 
reduce the parasitic capacitances.

28a. For sputter deposition, a high-temperature, high-purity compound target is used to ensure the quality of 
the silicide. The most commonly used silicides for the polycide process are WSi2, TaSi2, and MoSi2. They are all 
refractory, thermally stable, and resistant to processing chemicals. A self-aligned silicide process is illustrated in 
Fig. 28b. In the process, the polysilicon gate is patterned without any silicide, and a sidewall spacer (silicon oxide 
or silicon nitride) is formed to prevent shorting the gate to the source and drain during the silicidation process. A 
metal layer, either Ti or Co, is blanket-sputtered on the entire structure, followed by silicide sintering. Silicide is 
formed, in principle, only where the metal is in contact with Si. A wet chemical wash then rinses off the unreacted 
metal, leaving only the silicide. This technique eliminates the need to pattern the composite polycide gate structure 
and adds silicide to the source/drain area to reduce the contact resistance.
The silicides are promising materials for ULSI circuits because of their low resistivity and excellent thermal 
stability. Cobalt silicide has been widely investigated recently because of its lowest resistivity and high-temperature 
thermal stability. However, cobalt is sensitive to native oxide as well as an oxygen-contained environment, and a 
large amount of silicon is consumed during silicidation.
From the polycide and salicide formation processes in Figure 28, we can deduce the following desired 
properties for a silicide material:
 1. Low resistivity (limits contact alignment issues for multilayers and reduces device resistance).
 2. Etch selectivity of the silicide vs. the metal (allows self-aligned process).
 3. Etch resistance in reactive ion etch (RIE) environment (allows opening of via holes).
 4. Acceptable diffusion barrier properties.
 5. Low roughness (gives a minimal junction penetration).
 6. Preferably high resistance to oxidation. 
Beside these six characteristics, the silicide must also fill the following criteria: high morphological stability, 
minimal Si consumption (limited doped Si available), and controlled film stress.

 SUMMARY
Modern semiconductor device fabrication requires the use of thin films. Currently, there are four important 
types of films—thermal oxides, dielectric layers, poly-crystalline silicon, and metal films. The major issues related 
to film formation are low-temperature processing, step coverage, selective deposition, uniformity, film quality, 
planarization, throughput, and large-wafer capacity.
Thermal oxidation offers the best quality for the Si-SiO2 interface and has the lowest interface trap density. 
Therefore, it is used to form the gate oxide and the field oxide. LPCVD of dielectrics and polysilicon offers 
conformal step coverage. In contrast, PVD and atmospheric-pressure CVD generally result in noncomformal step 
coverage. CMP offers global planarization and reduces defect density. Conformal step coverage and planarization 
are also required for precise pattern transfer at lithography level below 100 nm. Pattern transfer technology is 
discussed in the next chapter. An emerging technology for film formation is atomic-layer deposition, which is 
capable of depositing oxide and metal thin films of the order of a monolayer in thickness.
To minimize the RC time delay due to parasitic resistance and capacitance, the silicide process for ohmic 
contacts, copper metallization for interconnects, and low–dielectric-constant materials for interlayer films are 
used extensively to meet the requirements for the multilevel interconnect structures of ULSI circuits. In addition, 
we have investigated high-dielectric-constant materials to improve gate insulator performance and to increase the 
capacitance per unit area for DRAM.

SUMMARY
Lithography is the process of transferring patterns of geometric shapes on a mask to a thin layer of radiation-
sensitive material (called resist) covering the surface of a semiconductor wafer.1 These patterns define the various 
regions in an integrated circuit such as the implantation regions, the contact windows, and the bonding-pad areas. 
The resist patterns defined by the lithographic process are not permanent elements of the final device but only 
replicas of circuit features. To produce circuit features, these resist patterns must be transferred once more into the 
underlying layers comprising the device. The pattern transfer is accomplished by an etching process that selectively 
removes unmasked portions of a layer.2   
 
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
The importance of a clean room for lithography.
r
 The most widely used lithographic method —optical lithography and its esolution-
enhancement techniques.
r
Advantages and limitations of other lithographic methods.
r
Mechanisms for wet chemical etching of semiconductors, insulators, and metal films.
r
Dry etching (also called plasma-assisted etching) for high-fidelity pattern transfer.
 
13.1 OPTICAL LITHOGRAPHY 
The vast majority of lithographic equipment for integrated-circuit (IC) fabrication is optical equipment using 
ultraviolet light (λ ≅ 0.2–0.4 μm). In this section we consider the exposure tools, the masks, the resists, and 
resolution-enhancement techniques used for optical lithography. We also consider the pattern transfer process, 
which serves as a basis for other lithographic systems. We first briefly consider the clean room, because all 
lithographic processes must be performed in an ultraclean environment.

Fig. 1 Various ways in which dust particles can interfere with photomask patterns.3
13.1.1 The Clean Room
An IC fabrication facility requires a clean processing room, especially in the area used for lithography. The 
need for such a clean room arises because dust particles in the air can settle on semiconductor wafers and 
lithographic masks and can cause defects in the devices and hence circuit failure. For example, a dust particle 
on a semiconductor surface can disrupt the single-crystal growth of an epitaxial film, causing the formation of 
dislocations. A dust particle incorporated into the gate oxide can result in enhanced conductivity and cause device 
failure due to low breakdown voltage. The situation is even more critical in the lithographic area. When dust 
particles adhere to the surface of a photomask, they behave as opaque patterns on the mask, and these patterns 
will be transferred to the underlying layer along with the circuit patterns on the mask. Figure 1 shows three dust 
particles on a photomask.3 Particle 1 may result in the formation of a pinhole in the underlying layer. Particle 2 is 
located near a pattern edge and may cause a constriction of current flow in a metal runner. Particle 3 can lead to a 
short circuit between the two conducting regions and render the circuit useless.
In a clean room, the total number of dust particles per unit volume must be tightly controlled along with the 
temperature and humidity. Figure 2 shows the particle-size distribution curves for various classes of clean rooms. 
We have two systems to define the classes of clean room.4 In the English system, the numerical  designation of the  
class  is taken from the maximum allowable number of particles 0.5 μm and larger, per cubic foot. For the metric 
system, the class is taken from the logarithm (base 10) of the maximum allowable number of particles 0.5 μm and 
larger, per cubic meter. For example, a class 100 clean room (English system) has a dust count of 100 particles/ft3 
with particle diameters of 0.5 μm and larger, whereas a class M 3.5 clean room (metric system) has a dust count 
of 103.5 or about 3500 particles/m3 with particle diameters of 0.5 μm and larger. Since 100 particles/ft3 = 3500 
particles/m3, a class 100 in English system corresponds to a class M 3.5 in the metric system.
For most IC fabrication areas, a class 100 clean room is required, that is, the dust count must be about four 
orders of magnitude below that of ordinary room air. However, for the lithography area, a class 10 clean room or 
one with a lower dust count is required.

 EXAMPLE 1
If we expose a 300-mm wafer for 1 minute to an air stream under a laminar-flow condition at 30 m/min, how 
many dust particles will land on the wafer in a class-10 clean room?
SOLUTION For a class 10 clean room, there are 350 particles (0.5 μm and larger) per cubic meter. The air volume 
that goes over the wafer in 1 minute is

The number of dust particles (0.5 μm and larger) contained in the air volume is 350 × 2.12 = 742 particles.
Therefore, if there are 800 IC chips on the wafer, the particle count amounts to one particle on each of 92% 
of the chips. Fortunately, only a fraction of the particles that land adhere to the wafer surface, and of those 
only a fraction are at a circuit location critical enough to cause a failure. However, the calculation indicates the 
importance of the clean room.

Fig. 3 Schematic of optical shadow printing techniques:1 (a) contact printing, (b) proximity printing.
13.1.2 Exposure Equipment
The pattern transfer process is accomplished by using lithographic exposure equipment. The performance of 
exposure equipment is determined by three parameters: resolution, registration, and throughput. Resolution is the 
minimum feature dimension that can be transferred with high fidelity to a resist film on a semiconductor wafer. 
Registration is a measure of how accurately patterns on successive masks can be aligned (or overlaid) on previously 
defined patterns on the wafer. Throughput is the number of wafers that can be exposed per hour for a given mask 
level.
There are basically two optical exposure methods: shadow printing and projection printing.5,6 Shadow 
printing may have the mask and wafer in direct contact with each other as in contact printing, or in close proximity 
as in proximity printing. Figure 3a shows a basic setup for contact printing where a resist-coated wafer is brought 
into physical contact with a mask, and the resist is exposed by a nearly collimated beam of ultraviolet light 
through the back of the mask for a fixed time. The intimate contact between resists and mask provides a resolution 
of ~1 μm. However, contact printing suffers a major drawback caused by dust particles. A dust particle or a speck 
of silicon dust on the wafer can be imbedded into the mask when the mask makes contact with the wafer. The 
imbedded particle causes permanent damage to the mask and results in defects in the wafer with each succeeding 
exposure.
To minimize mask damage, the proximity exposure method is used. Figure 3b shows the basic setup. It is 
similar to the contact printing method except that there is a small gap (10–50 μm) between the wafer and the mask 
during exposure. The small gap results in optical diffraction at feature edges on the photomask: that is, when light 
passes by the edges of an opaque mask feature, fringes are formed and some light penetrates into the shadow 
region. As a result, the resolution is degraded to the 2–5 μm range.
In shadow printing, the minimum linewidth [or critical dimension (CD)] that can be printed is roughly 
 
CD ≅
λg,  
(1)
where λ is the wavelength of the exposure radiation and g is the gap between the mask and wafer and includes the 
thickness of the resist. For λ = 0.4 μm and g = 50 μm, the CD is 4.5 μm. If we reduce λ to 0.25 μm (the wavelength 
range of 0.2–0.3 μm is in the deep-UV spectral region) and g to 15 μm, CD becomes 2 μm. Thus, there is an 
advantage in reducing both λ and g. However, for a given distance g, any dust particle with a diameter larger than 
g can potentially cause mask damage.
To avoid the mask damage problem associated with shadow printing, projection-printing exposure equipment 
has been developed to project an image of the mask patterns onto a resist-coated wafer many centimeters away 
from the mask. To increase resolution, only a small portion of the mask is exposed at a time, allowing a uniform 
source of light. The small image area is scanned or stepped over the wafer to cover the entire wafer surface. Figure 
4a shows a 1:1 wafer scan projection system.6,7 A narrow, arc-shaped image field  ~1 mm in width serially transfers 
the slit image of the mask onto the wafer. The image size on the wafer is the same as on the mask.
Lithography and Etching 431

Fig. 4 Image-partitioning techniques for projection printing: (a) annual-field wafer scan, (b) 1:1 step-and-repeat, (c) 
M:1 reduction step-and repeat, and (d) M:1 reduction step-and-scan.6,7 
The small image field can also be stepped over the surface of the wafer by two-dimensional translations of the 
wafer only, while the mask remains stationary. After the exposure of one chip site, the wafer is moved to the next 
chip site and the process is repeated. Figure 4b and 4c show the partitioning of the wafer image by step-and-repeat 
projection with a ratio of 1:1 or at a demagnification ratio M:1 (e.g., 10:1 for a 10 times reduction on the wafer), 
respectively. The demagnification ratio is an important factor in our ability to produce both the lens and the mask 
from which we wish to print. The 1:1 optical systems are easier to design and fabricate than 10:1 or 5:1 reduction 
systems, but it is much more difficult to produce defect-free masks at 1:1 than at a 10:1 or a 5:1 demagnification 
ratio.
Reduction projection lithography can also print larger wafers without redesigning the stepper lens as long 
as the field size (i.e., the exposure area onto the wafer per se) of the lens is large enough to contain one or more 
IC chips. When the chip size exceeds the field size of the lens, further partitioning of the image on the mask is 
necessary. In Fig. 4d the image field on the mask can be a narrow, arc-shaped for M:1 step-and-scan projection 
lithography. For the step-and-scan system, we have two-dimensional translations of the wafer with speed υ, and 
one-dimensional translation of the mask with M times that of the wafer speed.
The resolution of a projection system lm is usually determined by the quality of the lens, but is ultimately 
limited by diffraction and given by
 
l

NA ,

where λ is again the exposure wavelength, k1 is a process-dependent factor, and NA is the numerical aperture, 
which is given by
 
NA = n sinθ  = n  sin (tan-1 D/2f ) ≈ n (D/2f ) 
(3)
432 Semiconductors

with n  the index of refraction in the image medium (usually air, where n  = 1), θ the half-angle of the cone of 
light converging to a point image at the wafer, D the diameter of the lens and f the focal length, as shown5 in Fig. 
5. Hence the numerical aperture of an optical system is a dimensionless number that characterizes the range of angles 
over which the system can accept or emit light. Also shown in the figure is the depth of focus (DOF), which can be 
expressed as

where k2 is another process-dependent factor. The depth of focus is a measure of the distance from the lens in 
which the film or sensor plane will remain in focus. In photolithography, it is useful to specify the flatness and 
thickness of the resist to assure sharp focus.
Equation 2 indicates that resolution can be improved (i.e., smaller lm) by either reducing the wavelength or 
increasing NA or both. However, Eq. 4 indicates that the DOF degrades much more rapidly by increasing NA 
than by decreasing λ. This explains the trend toward shorter-wavelength sources in optical lithography.
The high-pressure mercury-arc lamp is widely used in exposure equipment because of its high intensity and 
reliability. The mercury-arc spectrum is composed of several peaks. The terms G-line, H-line, and I-line refer to 
the peaks at 436 nm, 405 nm, and 365 nm, respectively. I-line lithography with 5:1 step-and-repeat projection can 
offer a resolution of 0.3 μm with resolution enhancement techniques (see Section 13.1.6). Advanced exposure 
equipment such as the 248 nm lithographic system using a KrF excimer laser, the 193 nm lithographic system 
using an ArF excimer laser, and the immersion 193 nm system (in which the lens is immersed in water to increase 
the index of refraction from 1 to 1.33) have been developed for mass production with resolutions of 180 nm, 100 
nm, and below 70 nm, respectively.
13.1.3 Masks
Reduction techniques are usually used to fabricate masks for IC manufacturing. The first step in mask making  
is to use a computer-aided design (CAD) system in which designers can completely describe the circuit patterns 
electrically. The digital data produced by the CAD system then drives a pattern generator, which is an electron-
beam lithographic system (see Section 13.2.1) that transfers the patterns directly to electron-sensitized mask. The 
mask consists of a fused silica substrate covered with a chrominum layer. The circuit pattern is first transferred to 
the electron-sensitized layer (electron resist), which is transferred once more into the underlying chrominum layer 
for the finished mask. The details of pattern transfer are considered in Section 13.1.5.
Lithography and Etching 433

Fig. 6 An integrated-circuit photomask.1
The patterns on a mask represent one level of an IC design. The composite layout is broken into mask levels 
that correspond to the IC process sequence such as the isolation region on one level, the gate region on another, 
and so on. Typically, 15–20 different mask levels are required for a complete IC process cycle.
The standard-size mask substrate is a fused silica plate 15 × 15 cm square and 0.6 cm thick. The size is needed 
to accommodate the lens field sizes for 4:1 or 5:1 optical exposure equipment, whereas the thickness is required to 
minimize pattern placement errors due to substrate distortion. The fused silica plate is needed for its low coefficient 
of thermal expansion, high transmission at shorter wavelengths, and mechanical strength. Figure 6 shows a mask 
on which patterns of geometric shapes have been formed. A few secondary-chip sites used for process evaluation 
are also included in the mask.
One of the major concerns about masks is the defect density. Mask defects can be introduced during the 
manufacture of the mask or during subsequent lithographic processes. Even a small mask-defect density has a 
profound effect on the final IC yield. The yield is defined as the ratio of good chips per wafer to the total number 
of chips per wafer. As a first-order approximation, the yield Y for a given masking level can be expressed as
 
Y ≅ e–DA, 
(5)
where D is the average number of “fatal” defects per unit area and A is the area of an IC chip. If D remains the 
same for all mask levels (e.g., N = 10 levels), then the final yield becomes
 
Y ≅ e–NDA. 
(6)
Figure 7 shows the mask-limit yield for a 10-level lithographic process as a function of chip size for various 
values of defect densities. For example, for D = 0.25 defect/cm2, the yield is 10% for a chip size of 90 mm2, and 
it drops to about 1% for a chip size of 180 mm2. Therefore, inspection and cleaning of masks are important 
to achieve high yields on large chips. Of course, an ultraclean processing area is mandatory for lithographic 
processing.

13.1.4 Photoresist
The photoresist is a radiation-sensitive compound. Photoresists are classified as positive and negative, depending 
on how they respond to radiation. For positive resists, the exposed regions become more soluble and thus more 
easily removed in the development process. The net result is that the patterns formed (also called images) in the 
positive resist are the same as those on the mask. For negative resists, the exposed regions become less soluble, and 
the patterns formed in the negative resist are the reverse of the mask patterns.
Positive photoresists have three components: a photosensitive compound, a base resin, and an organic 
solvent. Prior to exposure, the photosensitive compound is insoluble in the developer solution. After exposure, 
the photosensitive compound absorbs radiation in the exposed pattern areas, changes its chemical structure, and 
becomes soluble in the developer solution. After development, the exposed areas are removed.
Negative photoresists are polymers combined with a photosensitive compound. After exposure, the 
photosensitive compound absorbs the optical energy and converts it into chemical energy to initiate a polymer 
linking reaction. This reaction causes cross linking of the polymer molecules. The cross-linked polymer has a 
higher molecular weight and becomes insoluble in the developer solution. After development, the unexposed areas 
are removed. One major drawback of a negative photoresist is that in the development process, the whole resist 
mass swells by absorbing developer solvent. This swelling action limits the resolution of negative photoresists.
Figure 8a shows a typical exposure response curve and image cross section for a positive resist.1 The response 
curve describes the percentage of resist remaining after exposure and development versus the exposure energy. 
Note that the resist has a finite solubility in its developer, even without exposure to radiation. As the exposure 
energy increases, the solubility gradually increases until at a threshold energy ET, the resist becomes completely 
soluble. The sensitivity of a positive resist is defined as the energy required to produce complete solubility in the 
exposed region. Thus, ET corresponds to the sensitivity. In addition to ET, a parameter γ , the contrast ratio, is 
defined to characterize the resist:

where E1 is the energy obtained by drawing the tangent at ET to reach 100% resist thickness as shown in Fig. 8a. A 
larger γ  implies a higher solubility of the resist with an incremental increase of exposure energy and yields sharper 
images.
The image cross section in Fig. 8a illustrates the relationship between the edges of a photomask image and the 
corresponding edges of the resist images after development. The edges of the resist image are generally not at the 
vertically projected positions of the mask edges because of diffraction. The edge of the resist image corresponds to 
the position where the total absorbed optical energy equals the threshold energy ET. 
Figure 8b shows the exposure-response curve and image cross section for a negative resist. The negative resist 
remains completely soluble in the developer solution for exposure energies lower than the threshold energy ET. 
Above ET, more of the resist film remains after development. At exposure energies twice the threshold energy, 
the resist film becomes essentially insoluble in the developer. The sensitivity of a negative resist is defined as the 
energy required to retain 50% of the original resist film thickness in the exposed region. The parameter γ is defined 
similarly to γ in Eq. 7 except that E1 and ET are interchanged. The image cross section for the negative resist (Fig. 
8b) is also influenced by the diffraction effect.

For deep UV lithography (e.g., 248 and 193 nm), we cannot use conventional photoresists because these resists 
require a high-dose exposure in deep UV, which will cause lens damage and lower throughput. The chemical-
amplified resist (CAR) has been developed for the deep UV process. CAR consists of a photo-acid generator, a 
resin polymer, and a solvent. CAR is very sensitive to deep UV radiation and the exposed and unexposed regions 
differ greatly in their solubility in the developer solution.
13.1.5 Pattern Transfer
Figure 9 illustrates the steps to transfer IC patterns from a mask to a silicon wafer that has an insulating SiO2 
layer on its surface.8 The wafer is placed in a clean room that is typically illuminated with yellow light, since 
photoresists are not sensitive to wavelengths greater than 0.5 μm. To ensure satisfactory adhesion of the resist, 
the surface must be changed from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. This change can be made by the application of 
an adhesion promoter, which  can  provide a  chemically  compatible  surface  for  the  resist. The most common 
adhesion promoter for silicon ICs is hexa-methylenedi-siloxane (HMDS). After the application of this adhesion 
layer, the wafer is held on a vacuum spindle and 2–3 cc of liquid resist is applied to the center of wafer. The wafer 
is then rapidly accelerated up to a constant rotational speed that is maintained for about 30 seconds. Spin speed is 
generally in the range of 1000–10,000 rpm (2000–5000 rpm is common) to coat a uniform film about 0.5 to 1 μm 
thick, as shown in Fig. 9a. The thickness of photoresist is correlated with its viscosity.
After the spinning step, the wafer is given a soft bake (typically at 90°–120°C for 60–120 seconds) to remove 
the solvent from the photoresist film and to increase resist adhesion to the wafer. The wafer is aligned with 
respect to the mask in an optical lithographic system, and the resist is exposed to UV light, as shown in Fig. 9b. 
If a positive photoresist is used, the exposed resist is dissolved in the developer, as shown in the left side of Fig. 
9c. Photoresist development is usually done by flooding the wafer with the developer solution. The wafer is then 
rinsed and dried. After development, postbaking at ~100°–180°C may be required to increase the adhesion of the 
resist to the substrate. The wafer is then put in an ambient that etches the exposed insulation layer but does not 
attack the resist, as shown in Fig. 9d. Finally, the resist is stripped (e.g., using solvent or plasma oxidation), leaving 
behind an insulator image (or pattern) that is the same as the opaque image on the mask (left side of Fig. 9e).
For the negative photoresist, the procedures described are also applicable, except that the unexposed areas are 
removed. The final insulator image (right side of Fig. 9e) is the reverse of the opaque image on the mask.
The insulator image can be used as a mask for subsequent processing. For example, we use ion implantation 
to dope the exposed semiconductor region, but not the area covered by the insulator. The dopant pattern is a 
duplicate of the design pattern on the photomask (for a negative photoresist) or is its complementary pattern (for 
a positive photoresist). The complete circuit is fabricated by aligning the next mask in the sequence to the previous 
pattern and repeating the lithographic transfer process.
A related pattern-transfer process is the liftoff technique, shown in Fig. 10. A positive resist is used to form 
the resist pattern on the substrate (Fig. 10a and 10b). The film (e.g., aluminum) is deposited over the resist and the 
substrate (Fig. 10c); the film thickness must be smaller than that of the resist. Those portions of the film on the 
resist are removed by selectively dissolving the resist layer in an appropriate liquid etchant so that the overlying 
film is lifted off and removed (Fig. 10d). The liftoff technique is capable of high resolution and is used extensively 
for discrete devices such as high-power MESFETs. However, it is not as widely applicable for ultralarge-scale 
integration, in which dry etching is the preferred technique.

Wet Photoresist Stripping
The photoresist can be stripped off with a strong acid such as H2SO4 or an acid-oxidant combination such as 
H2SO4–Cr2O3 attacking the resist but not the oxide or the Si. Other liquid strippers are organic-solvent strippers 
and alkaline strippers. Acetone can be used if the postbaking was not too long or at too high a at 120 oC we can

use acetone. However, with a post-bake at 140 oC, the resist develops a tough skin and has to be burned away in 
oxygen plasma. 
Dry Photoresist Stripping
Dry resist stripping (or ashing) can provide a cleaner surface than wet resist stripping. It also has fewer 
problems with toxic, flammable, and dangerous chemicals. The stripping rate is almost a constant and causes no 
undercutting and broadening of the resist. In addition, it is less corrosive with respect to metal features on the 
wafer.
There are three methods for dry resist stripping. Oxygen plasma stripping employs a low-pressure plasma 
discharge to split molecular oxygen (O2) into its more reactive atomic form (O). This atomic oxygen converts an 
organic resist into a gaseous product that may be pumped away. In ozone strippers, ozone attacks the resist at 
atmosphere pressure. In UV/ozone stripping, the UV helps to break bonds in the resist, so that ozone can make a 
more efficient attack. Ozone strippers have the advantage that no plasma damage can occur on the devices in the 
process. The barrel plasma reactor has been used primarily for resist stripping and will be discussed in Section 13.5.
13.1.6  Resolution Enhancement Techniques
Optical lithography has been continuously challenged to provide better resolution, greater depth of focus (DOF), 
and wider exposure latitude in IC processing. These challenges have been met by reducing the wavelength of the 
exposure equipment and developing new resists. In addition, many resolution–enhancement techniques have been 
developed to extend the capability of optical lithography to even smaller feature lengths.
Lithography and Etching 439

Fig. 11 The principle of phase-shift technology. (a) Conventional technology; (b) phase-shift technology.9
Phase Shift Technology 
An important resolution enhancement technique is the phase-shifting mask (PSM). The basic concept is shown9 
in Fig. 11. For a conventional mask, the electric field has the same phase at every aperture (clear area) in Fig. 11a. 
Diffraction and the limited resolution of the optical system spread the electric field at the wafer, as shown by the 
dotted lines. Interference between waves diffracted by the adjacent apertures enhances the field between them. 
Because the intensity I is proportional to the square of the electric field, it becomes difficult to separate the two 
images that are projected close to one another. The phase-shift layer that covers adjacent apertures reverses the sign 
of the electric field, as shown in Fig. 11b. Because the intensity at the mask is unchanged, the electric field of the 
images at the wafer can be cancelled. Therefore, images that are projected close to one another can be separated. A 
180° phase change can be obtained by using a transparent layer with the thickness of d

the refractive index and λ is the wavelength, that covers one aperture, as shown in Fig. 11b.
Optical Proximity Correction
High-performance optical projection imaging for lithography is strongly impacted by diffraction effects. The 
individual pattern features do not image independently, but rather interact with neighboring pattern features. 
The result from the diffraction overlap is the so-called proximity effect. The proximity effect becomes much more 
prominent as the feature sizes and spaces between the feature sizes approach the resolution limits of the projection 
optics. 
A resolution-enhancement technique to minimize this effect is optical proximity correction (OPC), which uses 
modified shapes of adjacent subresolution geometry to compensate for image errors due to diffraction effects. For 
example, a line with a width near the resolution limit will print a line with round corners as shown as Fig. 12a due 
to the diffraction effect. Modifying the edge of the line pattern with additional geometrics at the corners as shown 
in Fig. 12b will help print a more accurate line. The addition of OPC features to the mask layout allows tighter 
design rules and significantly improves process reliability and yield. 
Immersion Lithography 
As mentioned in Sec. 13.1.2, immersion lithography is an advanced photolithography system in which the usual air 
gap between the lens and the wafer surface is replaced with a liquid medium that has a refractive index greater

than air. The resolution can be enhanced by increasing the numerical aperture (Eq. 2), which is proportional to the 
refractive index of the image medium (Eq. 3). Therefore, the resolution is increased by a factor equal to the refractive 
index. Current immersion-lithography equipment uses highly purified water ( n = 1.33) for this liquid to fabricate 
new-generation nano-scaled CMOS ICs. Immersion lithography is being developed for processes below 32 nm.
 
13.2 NEXT-GENERATION LITHOGRAPHIC METHODS
Why is optical lithography so widely used and what makes it such a promising method? The reasons are that it 
has high throughput, good resolution, low cost, and ease of operation. However, due to IC process requirements 
for features below 100 nm, optical lithography has some limitations not yet solved. Although we can use PSM, 
OPC, or immersion lithography to extend its useful span, the complexity of mask production and mask inspection 
can not be easily resolved. In addition, the cost of the masks is very high. Therefore, we need to find postoptical 
lithography to process nanometer ICs. Various types of next-generation lithographic methods for IC fabrication 
are discussed in this section. 
13.2.1 Electron-Beam Lithography
Electron-beam lithography is primarily used to produce photomasks. Relatively little equipment is dedicated 
to direct exposure of the resist by a focused electron beam without a mask. Figure 13 shows a schematic of an 
electron-beam lithography system.10 The electron gun is a device that can generate a beam of electrons with a 
suitable current density. A tungsten thermionic-emission cathode or single-crystal lanthanum hexa-boride (LaB6) 
is used for the electron gun. Condenser lenses are used to focus the electron beam to a spot size 10–25 nm in 
diameter. Beam-blanking plates that turn the electron beam on and off and beam deflection coils are computer 
controlled and operated at MHz or higher rates to direct the focused electron beam to any location in the scan field 
on the substrate. Because the scan field (typically 1 cm) is much smaller than the substrate diameter, a precision 
mechanical stage is used to position the substrate to be patterned.
The advantages of electron-beam lithography include the generation of nanometer resist geometries, highly 
automated and precisely controlled operation, greater depth of focus than available from optical lithography, 
and direct patterning on a semiconductor wafer without using a mask. The disadvantage is that electron beam 
lithographic machines have low throughput—approximately 2 wafers per hour at less than 100 nm resolution. 
This throughput is adequate for the production of photomasks, for situations that require small numbers of 
custom circuits, and for design verification. However, for maskless direct writing, the machine must have the 
highest possible throughput and therefore the largest beam diameter possible consistent with the minimum device 
dimensions.
Lithography and Etching 441

Fig. 13 Schematic of an electron-beam machine.10
There are basically two ways to scan the focused electron beam: raster scan and vector scan.11 In a raster scan 
system, resist patterns are written by a beam that moves through a regular mode, vertically oriented, as shown 
in Fig. 14a. The beam scans sequentially over every  possible  location  on  the  mask  and  is  blanked  (turned  
off)  where  no  exposure  is required. All patterns on the area to be written must be subdivided into individual 
addresses, and a given pattern must have a minimum incremental interval that is evenly divisible by the beam 
address size.
In the vector scan system, as shown in Fig. 14b, the beam is directed only to the requested pattern features 
and jumps from feature to feature, rather than scanning the whole chip, as in raster scan. For many chips, the 
average exposed region is only 20% of the chip area, so we can save time by using a vector-scan system.
Figure 14c shows several types of electron beams employed for e-beam lithography: the Gaussian spot beam 
(round beam), variable-shaped beam, and cell projection. In variable-shaped beam system, the patterning beam 
has a rectangular cross section of variable size. Therefore, the vector scan method using variable-shaped beam has 
higher throughout than the conventional Gaussian spot beam. It is also possible to pattern a complex geometric 
shape in one exposure with an electron beam system; this is called cell projection, as shown in the far right of Fig. 
14c. The cell projection technique12 is particularly suitable for highly repetitive designs, as in MOS memory cells, 
because several memory cell patterns can be exposed at once. Cell projection has not yet achieved the throughput 
of optical exposure equipment.

Electron Resist
Electron resists are polymers. The behavior of an electron-beam resist is similar to that of a photoresist: that is, a 
chemical or physical change is induced in the resist by irradiation. This change allows the resist to be patterned. 
For a positive electron resist, the polymer-electron interaction causes chemical bonds to be broken (chain scission) 
to form shorter molecular fragments, as shown13 in Fig. 15a. As a result, the molecular weight is reduced in the 
irradiated area, which can be dissolved subsequently in a developer solution that attacks the low-molecular-weight 
material. Common positive electron resists include poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and poly-butene-1 sulfone 
(PBS). Positive electron resists can achieve resolutions of 0.1 μm or better.
For a negative electron resist, the irradiation causes radiation-induced polymer linking, as shown in Fig. 15b. 
The cross linking creates a complex three-dimensional structure with a molecular weight higher than that of the 
nonirradiated polymer. The nonirradiated resist can be dissolved in a developer solution that does not attack the 
high-molecular-weight material. Poly-glycidyl methacrylate-co-ethyl acrylate (COP) is a common negative electron 
resist. COP, like most negative photoresists, also swells during development, so the resolution is limited to about 1 μm.
Lithography and Etching 443

Fig. 15 Schematic of (a) positive and (b) negative resists used in electron-beam lithography.13
The Proximity Effect
In optical lithography, the resolution is limited by diffraction of light. In electron-beam lithography, the resolution 
is limited not by diffraction (because the wavelengths associated with electrons of a few keV and higher energies 
are less than 0.1 nm) but by electron scattering. When electrons penetrate the resist film and underlying substrate, 
they undergo collisions that lead to energy losses and path changes. Thus, the incident electrons spread out 
as they travel through the material until either all of their energy is lost or they leave the material because of 
backscattering.
Figure 16a shows computed electron trajectories of 100 electrons with initial energy of 20 keV incident at the 
origin of a 0.4 μm PMMA film on a thick silicon substrate.14 The electron beam is incident along the z-axis, and all 
trajectories have been projected onto the xz plane. This figure shows qualitatively that the electrons are distributed 
in an oblong pear-shaped volume with a diameter on the same order of magnitude as the electron penetration 
depth (~3.5 μm). Also, there are many electrons that undergo backscattering collisions and travel backward from 
the silicon substrate into the PMMA resist film and leave the material.
Figure 16b shows the normalized distributions of the forward-scattering and backscattering electrons at the 
resist-substrate interface. Because of the backscattering, electrons can irradiate several micrometers away from the 
center of the exposure beam. Since the dose of a resist is given by the sum of the irradiations from all surrounding 
areas, the electron-beam irradiation at one location will affect the irradiation in neighboring locations. This 
phenomenon is called the proximity effect. The proximity effect places a limit on the minimum spacings between 
pattern features. To correct for the proximity effect, patterns are divided into smaller segments. The incident 
electron dose in each segment is adjusted so that the integrated dose from all its neighboring segments is the 
correct exposure dose. This approach further decreases the throughput of the electron-beam system because of the 
additional computer time required to expose the subdivided resist patterns.

for forward scattering and backscattering at the resist-substrate interface.
13.2.2 Extreme-Ultraviolet Lithography
Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is a promising next-generation lithographic technology to extend minimum 
linewidths below 30 nm without throughput loss.15 Figure 17 shows a schematic diagram of an EUV lithographic 
system. A laser-produced plasma or synchrotron radiation can serve as the EUV source of λ = 10–14 nm EUV 
light. The EUV radiation is reflected by a mask that is produced by patterning an absorber material deposited on a 
multilayer-coated flat silicon or glass-plate mask blank. EUV radiation is reflected from the nonpatterned regions 
(i.e., nonabsorbing regions) of the mask through a 4× reduction camera and imaged into a thin layer of resist on 
the wafer.
Since the EUV radiation beam is narrow, the mask must be scanned by the beam to illuminate the entire 
pattern field that describes the circuit mask layer. Also, for a 4× four-mirror (i.e., the two-paraboloid, one-ellipsoid, 
and one-plane mirrors) reduction camera, the wafer must be scanned at one-fourth the mask speed in a direction 
opposite to the mask movement to reproduce the image field on all chip sites on the wafer surface. A precision system 
is required to perform
Lithography and Etching 445

the chip-site alignment and to control the wafer and mask stage movements and exposure dose during the 
scanning process. EUV lithography is capable of printing 50-nm features with PMMA resist using 13-nm 
radiation. However, the production of EUV exposure equipment has a number of challenges. Since EUV is 
strongly absorbed in all materials, the lithography process must be performed in vacuum. The camera must use 
reflective-lens elements, and the mirrors must be coated with multilayer coatings that produce distributed quarter-
wave Bragg reflectors. In addition, the mask blank must also be multilayer coated to maximize its reflectivity at  
λ = 10–14 nm.
13.2.3 Ion-Beam Lithography
Ion-beam lithography can achieve higher resolution than optical or electron-beam lithographic techniques because 
ions have a greater mass and therefore scatter less than electrons. The most important application is the repair of 
masks for optical lithography, a task for which commercial systems are available.
The computer-simulated trajectories of 50 H+ ions implanted at 60 keV into PMMA and various substrates16 
shows that the spread of the ion beam at a depth of 0.4 μm is only 0.1 μm in all cases (compare with Fig. 16 for 
electrons). The backscattering is completely absent for the silicon substrate, and there is only a small amount of 
backscattering for the gold substrate. However, ion-beam lithography may suffer from a random (or stochastic) 
space-charge effect, causing broadening of the ion beam.
There are two types of ion-beam lithography systems: a scanning focused-beam system and a mask-beam 
system. The former system is similar to the electron-beam machine (Fig. 13), in which the ion source can be Ga+ 
or H+. The latter system is similar to an optical 5× reduction projection step-and-repeat system, which projects 100 
keV light ions such as H+
2 through a stencil mask.
13.2.4 Comparison of Various Lithographic Methods
The lithographic methods discussed above all have 100 nm or better resolution. However, each method has its 
own limitations. For IC fabrication, many mask levels are involved. However, it is not necessary to use the same 
lithographic method for all levels. A mix-and-match approach can take advantage of the unique features of each 
lithographic process to improve resolution and to maximize throughput. For example, a 4:1 EUV method can be 
used for the most critical mask levels, whereas 4:1 or 5:1 optical system can be used for the rest.
446 Semiconductors

According to the Roadmap of the Semiconductor Industry Association, IC manufacturing technology will 
reach the 15 nm generation around 2020. With each new technology generation, lithography has become an 
even more important key driver for the semiconductor industry because of the requirements of smaller feature 
size and tighter overlay tolerance. In addition, lithography equipment costs have become higher relative to the 
total equipment costs for IC manufacturing facility. Currently, the technology development of next-generation 
lithography is conducted by multinational research projects or industrial partners.
 
13.3 WET CHEMICAL ETCHING 
Wet chemical etching is used extensively in semiconductor processing. Starting from the sawed semiconductor 
wafers, chemical etchants are used for lapping and polishing to give an optically flat, damage-free surface. Prior to 
thermal oxidation or epitaxial growth, the semiconductor wafers are chemically cleaned to remove contamination 
that results from handling and storing. Wet chemical etchings are especially suitable for blanket etches (i.e., over 
the whole wafer surface) of polysilicon, oxide, nitride, metals, and III-V compounds.
The mechanisms for wet chemical etching involve three essential steps: the reactants are transported by 
diffusion to the reacting surface, chemical reactions occur at the surface, and the products from the surface are 
removed by diffusion. Both agitation and the temperature of the etchant solution will influence the etch rate, 
which is the amount of film removed by etching per unit time. In IC processing, most wet chemical etchings 
proceed by immersing the wafers in a chemical solution or by spraying the wafers with the etchant solution. For 
immersion etching, the wafer is immersed in the etch solution. Mechanical agitation is usually required to ensure 
etch uniformity and a consistent etch rate. Spray etching has gradually replaced immersion etching because it 
greatly increases the etch rate and uniformity by constantly supplying fresh etchant to the wafer surface.
Etch rates must be uniform across a wafer, from wafer to wafer, from run to run, and for any variations in 
feature sizes and pattern densities. Etch rate uniformity is given by:

Calculate the Al average etch rate and etch rate uniformity on a 300 mm diameter silicon wafer, assuming the etch 
rates at the center, left, right, top, and bottom of the wafer are 750, 812, 765, 743, and 798 nm/min, respectively.
SOLUTION
 
Al average etch rate = (750 + 812 + 765 + 743 + 798) ÷ 5 = 773.6 nm/min.
 
Etch rate uniformity = (812 – 743) ÷ (812 + 743) × 100% = 4.4 %. 

13.3.1 Silicon Etching
For semiconductor materials, wet chemical etching usually starts with oxidation followed by dissolution of the 
oxide by a chemical reaction. For silicon, the most commonly used etchants are mixtures of nitric acid (HNO3) 
and hydrofluoric acid (HF) in water or acetic acid (CH3COOH). Nitric acid oxidizes silicon to form a SiO2 layer.17 
The oxidation reaction is 
 
Si + 4HNO3 → SiO2 + 2H2O + 4NO2. 
(9)
Lithography and Etching 447

Hydrofluoric acid is used to dissolve the SiO2 layer. The reaction is: 
 
SiO2+ 6HF → H2SiF6 +2H2O. 
(10)
Water can be used as a diluent for this etchant. However, acetic acid is preferred because it reduces the dissolution 
of the nitric acid.
Some etchants dissolve a given crystal plane of single-crystal silicon much faster than another plane; this 
results in orientation-dependent etching.18 For a silicon lattice, the (111)-plane has more available bonds per 
unit area than the (110)- and (100)-planes; therefore, the etch rate is expected to be slower for the (111)-plane. 
A commonly used orientation-dependent etch for silicon consists of a mixture of KOH in water and isopropyl 
alcohol. For example, a solution with 19 wt% KOH in deionized (DI) water at about 80°C removes the (100)-plane 
at a much greater rate than the (110)- and (111)-planes. The ratio of the etch rates for the (100)-, (110)-, and 
(111)-planes is 100:16:1.
Orientation-dependent etching of <100>-oriented silicon through a patterned silicon dioxide mask creates 
precise V-shaped grooves,10 the edges being (111)-planes at an angle of 54.7° from the (111)-surface, as shown 
at the left of Fig. 18a. If the window in the mask is sufficiently large or if the etching time is short, a U-shaped 
groove will be formed, as shown at the right of Fig. 18a. The width of the bottom surface is given by

where W0 is the width of the window on the wafer surface and l is the etched depth. If <–110>-oriented silicon is 
used, essentially straight-walled grooves with sides of (111)-planes can be formed, as shown in Fig. 18b. We can 
use the large orientation dependence in the etch rates to fabricate device structures with submicron feature lengths.
13.3.2 Silicon Dioxide Etching
The wet etching of silicon dioxide is commonly achieved in a dilute solution of HF with or without the addition of 
ammonium fluoride (NH4F). Adding NH4F is referred to as a buffered HF solution (BHF), also called buffered-
oxide-etch (BOE). The addition of NH4F to HF controls the pH value and replenishes the depleted fluoride ions, 
thus maintaining stable etching performance. The overall reaction for SiO2 etching is the same as that in Eq. 10. 
The etch rate of SiO2 etching depends on the etchant solution, etchant concentration, agitation, and temperature. 
In additional, density, porosity, microstructure, and the presence of impurities in the oxide also influence the etch 
rate. For example, a high concentration of phosphorus in the oxide results in a rapid increase in the etch rate, and 
a loosely structured chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) or sputtered oxide exhibits a faster etch rate than thermally 
grown oxide.
Silicon dioxide can also be etched in vapor-phase HF. Vapor-phase-HF oxide-etch technology has a potential 
for etching feature lengths below 100 nm because the process can be well controlled.
13.3.3 Silicon Nitride and Polysilicon Etching
Silicon nitride films can be etched at room temperature in concentrated HF or buffered HF and in a boiling 
H3PO4 solution. Selective etching of nitride to oxide is done with 85% H3PO4 at 180ºC because this solution 
attacks silicon dioxide very slowly. The etch rate is typically 10 nm/min for silicon nitride, but less than 1 nm/min 
for silicon dioxide. However, photoresist adhesion problems are encountered when etching nitride with boiling 
H3PO4 solution. Better patterning can be achieved by depositing a thin oxide layer on top of the nitride film before 
resist coating. The resist pattern is transferred to the oxide layer, which then acts as a mask for subsequent nitride 
etching. 
Etching polysilicon is similar to etching single-crystal silicon. However, the etch rate is considerably larger 
because of grain boundaries. The etch solution is usually modified to ensure that it does not attack the underlying 
gate oxide. Dopant concentrations and temperature may affect the etch rate of polysilicon.
13.3.4 Aluminum Etching
Aluminum and aluminum alloy films are generally etched in heated solutions of phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic 
acid, and DI water. The typical etchant is a solution of 73% H3PO4, 4% HNO3, 3.5% CH3COOH, and 19.5% DI 
water at 30°–80°C. The wet etching of aluminum proceeds as follows: HNO3 oxidizes aluminum, and H3PO4 then 
dissolves the oxidized aluminum. The etch rate depends on etchant concentration, temperature, agitation of the 
wafers, and impurities or alloys in the aluminum film. For example, the etch rate is reduced when copper is added 
to the aluminum.
Wet etching of insulating and metal films is usually done with the similar chemicals that dissolve these 
materials in bulk form. Generally, film materials will be etched more rapidly than their bulk counterparts. Also, the 
etch rates are higher for films that have a poor microstructure, built-in stress, departure from stoichiometry, or have 
been irradiated. Some useful etchants for insulating and metal films are listed in Table 1.
13.3.5 Gallium Arsenide Etching
A wide variety of etches has been investigated for gallium arsenide; however, few of them are truly isotropic.19 This 
is because the surface activities of the (111)-Ga and (111)-As faces are very different. Most etches give a polished 
surface on the arsenic face, but the  gallium face tends to show crystallographic defects and etches more slowly. 
The most commonly used etchants are the H2SO4-H2O2-H2O and H3PO4-H2O2-H2O systems. For an etchant with 
an 8:1:1 volume ratio of H2SO4:H2O2:H2O, the etch rate is 0.8 μm/min for the <111>-Ga face and 1.5 μm/min 
for all other faces. For an etchant with 3:1:50 volume ratio of H3PO4:H2O2:H2O, the etch rate is 0.4 μm/min for 
<111>-Ga face and 0.8 μm/min for all other faces.

13.4 DRY ETCHING
In pattern-transfer operations, a resist pattern is defined by a lithographic process to serve as a mask for etching 
of its underlying layer (Fig. 19a).20 Most of the layer materials (e.g., SiO2, Si3N4, and deposited metals) are 
amorphous or polycrystalline thin films. If they are etched in a wet chemical etchant, the etch rate is generally 
isotropic (i.e., the lateral and vertical etch rates are the same), as illustrated in Fig. 19b. If hf is the thickness of the 
layer material and l the lateral distance etched underneath the resist mask, we can define the degree of anisotropy

transfer.20
where t is the time and Rl and Rυ are the lateral and vertical etch rates, respectively. For isotropic etching, Rl = Rυ 
and Af = 0.
The major disadvantage of wet chemical etching for pattern transfer is the undercutting of the layer 
underneath the mask, resulting in a loss of resolution in the etched pattern. In practice, for isotropic etching, the 
film thickness should be about one-third or less of the resolution required. If patterns are required with resolutions 
much smaller than the film thickness, anisotropic etching (i.e., 1 ≥ Af >0) must be used. In practice, the value of Af 
is chosen to be close to unity. Figure 19c shows the limiting case where Af = 1, corresponding to l = 0 (or Rl = 0).
To achieve high-fidelity transfer of the resist patterns required for ultralarge-scale integration processing (Af 
=1), dry etching methods have been developed. Dry etching is synonymous with plasma-assisted etching, which 
denotes several techniques that use plasma in the form of low-pressure discharges. Dry-etch methods include 
plasma etching, reactive ion etching (RIE), sputter etching, magnetically enhanced RIE (MERIE), reactive ion 
beam etching, and high-density plasma (HDP) etching.
13.4.1 Plasma Fundamentals
Plasma is a fully or partially ionized gas composed of equal numbers of positive and negative charges and 
a different number of unionized molecules. A simple capacitively coupled radio frequency (rf) plasma etcher 
schematically shown in Fig. 20 is used to demonstrate the plasma fundamentals. The cathode is capacitively coupled to 
an rf generator and the anode is grounded, similarly to the sputtering discussed in the previous chapter. The rf frequency 
is typically 13.56 MHz because of its non-interference with radio-transmitted signals. The plasma is initiated by free 
electrons always present in a gas, generated by cosmic rays, thermal excitation, or other means. The free electrons 
oscillate and gain kinetic energy from the rf electric field and collide with gas molecules. The energy transferred

plasma system. 
in the collision causes the gas molecules to be ionized. When the applied voltage is larger than the breakdown 
potential of the gas, sustainable plasma is generated throughout the reaction chamber. The ionization rate is on the 
order of 10-4 to 10-6. 
Sheath
The formation of sheath in dry etching is similar to that in rf sputtering discussed in Chapter 12. Plasma is 
electrically neutral in the central  region  of  the  chamber.  Electrons  are  more mobile than positive ions, and 
therefore more electrons are attracted to the front surface of the electrodes during the positive half cycle than 
positive ions in the negative half cycle. Therefore, the current is larger in the positive cycle than that in the negative 
cycle. The resultant electron current charges up the capacitively coupled electrode (powered electrode) since no 
charge can be transferred through the capacitor. The powered electrode (cathode) acquires an increasing negative 
bias voltage during successive cycles until the negative average voltage VDC (also called ‘self-bias’) is sufficiently 
high to retard the electrons and the net charge arriving at the surface is zero. The magnitude of the powered 
electrode self-bias voltage depends on the amplitude and frequency of the voltage applied to the electrode. Since 
the powered electrode develops a negative self-bias, the plasma forms a compensating positive potential Vp relative 
to the grounded anode, as shown in the lower part of Fig. 20. 
The voltage gradients near the cathode and anode form intense electric fields near plasma-electrode 
interfaces known as sheaths (also called dark space because the high-energy electrons there are more likely to 
cause ionization than light-generating excitation) that play a significant role in the plasma etching processes. Since 
typical sheaths are thin (~ 10 μm to 1 mm) and conformal with the electrode surface, positive ion energy gain is 
primarily in the direction normal to the surface and the ion beam is essentially unidirectional there. Anisotropic 
etching relies on bombardment of unidirectional energetic ions at the substrate surface, which can be placed on 
the cathode or anode. This is achieved in plasma etching reactors by accelerating positive ions in the sheath above 
the substrate surface. The asymmetric voltage distribution at the cathode and anode causes a very large field in 
front of the cathode in comparison with the field in front of the anode or in the glow region. Anisotropic etching 
is very strong on the cathode surface due to the very strong field there, and is weaker on anode surface due to the 
relatively weaker field. 
452 Semiconductors

13.4.2 Surface Chemistry
The plasma used for etching is not in thermal equilibrium. As a result, the temperature of electrons, which are the 
lightest component of the plasma, is substantially higher than the neutral gas and ion temperature. The electron 
temperature is approximately in the range of 20,000~100,000 K; the ion temperature might be up to 2,000 K, while 
neutral radicals and molecules are less than 1,000 K. These energetic electrons can therefore generate reactive 
radicals and ions and enhance chemical reactions that cannot be achieved by other means. Radicals produced 
during dissociation tend to be more reactive than the parent gases and these radicals can further enhance the surface 
processes and plasma chemistry.
Plasma etching has to satisfy many stringent requirements simultaneously, including control of feature 
sidewall and bottom surface profiles, etch selectivity to other exposed materials, uniformity of the etch process 
over large substrate surfaces, and interaction with preceding and following processing steps. The crucial points 
related to fundamental surface processes are physical sputtering, reactive ion etching (RIE), chemical etching, and 
polymer deposition.
Physical Sputtering
One of the simplest material removal processes is physical sputtering, which involves the bombardment of target 
material by energetic ions or neutrals. However, sputtering tends to be non-selective.
Reactive Ion Etching
Most plasma etching processes rely primarily on reactive ion etching for material removal. RIE involves 
simultaneous bombardment of energetic ions and reactive neutral radicals onto the material surface. Ions bombard 
the substrate surface almost normally and etching by the reactive neutral radicals occurs anisotropically. RIE is 
similar to sputtering, but more selective than physical sputtering due to its partially chemical nature from reactive 
neutral radicals.
Chemical Etching
A simple example of chemical plasma etching is Si etching using F, which has a high etch rate even at room 
temperature:
 
Si (solid) + 4F → SiF4 (gas). 
(13)
Chemical etching is often isotropic as incoming neutral etchants have a uniform angular distribution. However, for 
some crystalline materials, chemical etching can be sensitive to crystallographic orientation. During the fabrication 
of submicron-sized features in CMOS devices, chemical etching often cannot be tolerated due to its isotropic 
nature. Processing conditions are therefore chosen so as to minimize chemical etching. 
Polymer Deposition
To generate small features, anisotropic etching also requires that etching take place only in the vertical direction 
with no etching in the horizontal direction. Although careful design of the plasma etching reactor and appropriate 
choice of etching gases can help to achieve these goals, one surface mechanism that has proven indispensable is 
polymer deposition. Presence of these films on vertical surfaces limits contact of the material surface with the 
etchant species to inhibit horizontal etching.
There are at least two mechanisms that can account for this buildup of sidewall passivation. The first is the 
deposition of polymeric material that is known to occur in plasma discharges with carbon-containing source gases. 
In the case of fluorine-containing Freons as source gases, this polymer deposition is linked to the formation of 
unsaturated CF2 radicals generated by the plasma. The second source of material on feature sidewalls is the etch 
product species generated at horizontal surfaces exposed to ion bombardment. These products are frequently 
nonvolatile and can stick to and react with vertical surfaces not exposed to ion bombardment. This source of 
sidewall building is termed redeposition.
A series of sequential cross sections depicting the anisotropic etching of a feature with sidewall redeposition is 
shown in Fig. 21, in which the six sequential profiles result from five etch-redeposition-etch steps.
Lithography and Etching 453

Fig. 21 The sequential formation, from left to right, of an etching feature profile in the presence of redeposition. 
The etching of horizontal surfaces and redeposition onto vertical surfaces are assumed to occur sequentially.
Substrate Temperature
Many of the above-mentioned fundamental surface processes take place simultaneously in etching processes.  
Plasma operating conditions must be carefully monitored to enhance or reduce the contribution of individual 
surface process and control the final results. One parameter that is particularly useful is the substrate temperature 
because many fundamental surface processes exhibit strong temperature dependence. For example, the chemical 
etching rate generally increases with surface temperature. Therefore, for processes in which both physical and 
chemical etching components are present, one can vary the degree of anisotropic or isotropic etching by varying 
the substrate temperature to control the feature profile.
13.4.3 Capacitively Coupled Plasmas Etchers
Dry etching technology in the IC industry has changed dramatically since the first application of plasma 
processing to photoresist stripping. A reactor for dry etching contains a vacuum chamber, pump system, power 
supply generators, pressure sensors, gas flow control units, and end-point detector. Each reactor uses a particular 
combination of pressure, electrode configuration and type, and source frequency to control the two primary etch 
mechanisms—chemical and physical. Higher etch rates and automation are required for most etchers used in 
IC fabrication. There are basically two groups of dry etchers based on how the plasma is produced: the capacitively 
coupled etchers and the inductively coupled etchers.1
In the simplest form of a capacitively coupled plasma etcher, etchant gases are injected between two parallel 
metallic electrodes with symmetrical size and position to which voltage is applied on one electrode. The potential 
drop across the gas breaks it down and generates the plasma. A significant fraction of the input power is 
consumed by ions accelerating in the sheaths, and is dissipated at the electrode surfaces (or substrates placed on 
them) during ion bombardment. Therefore, a small fraction of the input power is used for plasma generation. The 
gas dissociation fraction is low and electron density is also low (~ l09 to l010 cm-3). In addition, simple commercial 
capacitively coupled plasma etchers are typically operated at moderate gas pressures (~ 50 to 500 mTorr) and the 
scattering of gas prevents their use for fabrication of extremely small features. 
As shown in Fig. 20, a wafer can be placed on the grounded electrode. This is the plasma etch mode with 
energetic ion bombardment since the plasma potential is always above the grounded potential. If a wafer is 
placed on the powered electrode (cathode), it is operated in the reactive ion etch mode with higher energetic ion 
bombardment due to higher self-bias VDC. Physical and chemical etch mechanisms occur in both the plasma etch 
mode and the reactive ion etch mode. However, energies of bombarding ions are about ten times higher in the 
reactive ion etch mode. 
Reactive Ion Etcher
A capacitively coupled plasma etcher operated in the reactive ion etch mode is called a reactive ion etcher (RIE) 
or a reactive sputter etcher (RSE). RIE has been extensively used in the microelectronic industry. The wafers are 
placed on the powered electrode (cathode). This allows the grounded electrode to have a significantly larger area, 
as shown in Fig. 22, and leads to significantly higher plasma-sheath potentials (20-500 V) at the wafer surface. The 
process can be explained as follows.
454 Semiconductors

Fig. 22 Capacitively coupled plasma etcher with larger area for the grounded electrode.
The glow region of the plasma is a good electrical conductor. The dark spaces in plasma are areas of limited 
conductivity and can be modeled as capacitances, i.e., C = A/d, where A is the electrode area and d is the sheath 
thickness of the dark space. A voltage will split between two capacitances in series, i.e.
 
 
VC/VA = CA/CC = (AA/dA)/( AC/dC) 
(14)
where VC (CC) and VA (CA) are the voltage drops (capacitances) over the sheath thicknesses of the dark space on 
the cathode and anode and AC, AA are the areas of the cathode and anode. The current between two electrodes 
is dominated by space-charge-limited current in a capacitively coupled plasma system. The space-charge-limited 
current (described in Section 2.7, Chapter 2) of positive ions must be equal on both anode and cathode, i.e.
 
VC
3/2/dC
2 = VA
3/2/dA
2 
(15)
Therefore, 
 
VC/VA = (AA/AC)4 
(16)
That is to say, the potential difference across the dark space of each electrode will be the same if the electrodes are 
of similar area. The increase of the relative surface area of the grounded electrode can increase the sheath voltage 
at the powered electrode. The etching rate can be much enhanced, but the etch selectivity of this system is relatively 
low because of strong physical sputtering. However, selectivity can be improved by choosing the proper etch 
chemistry, for example by polymerizing the silicon surface with fluorocarbon polymers to obtain selectivity of SiO2 
over silicon. 
Magnetically Enhanced Reactive Ion Etcher   
In the magnetically enhanced reactive ion etcher (MERIE), the magnetic field crossed with the electric field reduces 
electron mobility towards the electrodes and their loss there. Densities of electrons and other species in the plasma 
are therefore larger in MERIE reactors for the same input power, which enhances the material etch rate. For a 
given power, higher electron (and ion) densities in MERIE reactors will consume more fractional power and 
therefore smaller fractional power will be used to accelerate ions in the sheaths. Consequently, ion-bombardment-
induced damage on the substrate and electrode surfaces diminishes. Etch uniformity is improved in MERIE 
reactors by either shaping the applied magnetic field or rotating it physically or electrically. Magnetically enhanced 
reactive ion etchers have been used extensively for dielectric etching in the semiconductor industry.
Lithography and Etching 455

Fig. 23 Schematic of a triode reactive ion etch reactor with two different radio-frequency power  sources. 
Fig. 24 Schematic of a typical barrel reactor.
Triode Reactive Ion Etcher
Another innovation in capacitively coupled plasma etcher design is the use of two (or more) sources at different 
frequencies as shown in Fig. 23. At the same input power, capacitively coupled plasmas are generated more 
efficiently at higher frequencies due to higher collision frequencies, and higher electron densities are accumulated 
at lower frequencies and hence higher self-biases are induced at the cathode. A high-frequency source (25 MHz and 
above) is therefore used in dual-frequency plasma systems to generate the plasma efficiently, while a low-frequency 
source (typically a few MHz or lower) accelerates ions. One can therefore obtain a higher plasma density relative to 
a simpler capacitive plasma system, and independently control ion energy as well.
Barrel Plasma Etcher
The barrel plasma reactor has been used primarily for resist stripping, as discussed in Ch. 12. It is one of the earliest 
plasma systems. The barrel reactor has a cylindrical design operated at a pressure of about 0.1 to 1 Torr. The 
power is applied on electrodes placed on both sides of the cylinder. An inner metal cylinder with holes can confine 
the plasma to the region between the metal cylinder and chamber wall (Fig. 24). The etchant species in the plasma 
diffuse through holes to etching area, while the energetic ions and electrons of the plasma cannot enter this region. 
Wafers are placed vertically on a quartz boat with a small separation between wafers, and placed parallel to the 
electric field to minimize physical etching. The etching is almost purely chemical with isotropic etching and high 
selectivity. 
13.4.4 Inductively Coupled Plasma Etchers 
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etchers were developed in the early 1990s to address the difficult process 
requirements of high-aspect-ratio (AR) oxide etch with high selectivity. ICP etchers are operated at lower gas 
pressure (~3 to 50 mtorr) than capacitively coupled plasma etchers. The lower pressure reduces gas collisions that 
cause loss of the etching profile. It also increases the mean free path of etchants and etching byproducts, and they can 
move easily into and out of high-aspect ratio features. However, the lower pressure also reduces the etch rate due
456 Semiconductors

Fig. 25  Inductively coupled plasma etcher.
to the reduction in ion density. Therefore, high-density plasma (HDP) is needed to generate sufficient active species for 
an acceptable etch rate at lower pressures. The gas dissociation rate of HDP can reach about 10% compared with 0.1% 
of capacitively coupled plasmas etchers.
ICP etchers utilize a set of coils that are physically separated from the gas through a dielectric window as 
shown in Fig. 25. Radio-frequency current through the coils generates an electromagnetic wave that penetrates 
the plasma chamber, azimuthally accelerates electrons, and generates the plasma. As most of the input power 
is consumed by electrons, the electron density is substantially larger (~ 1011- 1012 cm-3) in ICP etchers than in 
capacitively coupled plasmas. Therefore, the ICP etcher is a high-density plasma (HDP) etcher. 
In addition, a second source can be used in ICP etchers to separately bias the substrate during etching and 
impart energy to bombarding ions to enhance the etch rate. As separate sources are used for plasma generation 
and ion acceleration, high-aspect-ratio oxide etching is possible. Although a higher degree of dissociation enhances 
etch rate, it has detrimental effects on material selectivity in many cases.
Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) Plasma Etcher
The ECR plasma etcher shown in Fig. 26, which is similar to an ICP etcher, uses resonant wave-plasma interaction. In 
an ECR etcher, microwave (typically at 2.45 GHz) is launched into a magnetized chamber containing the etchant 
gas at low pressure (<10 mTorr). Electron cyclotron resonance occurs at spatial locations where the local electron 
cyclotron frequency (eB/me) matches the applied frequency. By carefully designing the magnetic field profile, one 
can obtain high-density uniform plasma above the substrate surface. Plasma densities in ECR etchers are higher or 
comparable to ICP reactors. The ECR etcher is also a HDP etcher. Electron cyclotron resonance etchers are also 
operated at lower gas pressures than capacitively coupled plasma etchers and allow independent biasing of the 
substrate. Similarly to ICP, ECR etchers are characterized by high degrees of gas dissociation.
Neutral Beam Plasma Etcher
Because of the presence of charged species or ultraviolet radiation in plasma, electrical damage to circuits on the 
substrate remains a constant  concern  during  plasma  etching.  To alleviate this problem, plasma etch sources 
that rely on energetic neutral beams have been developed in recent years. A typical neutral beam source is shown 
in Fig. 27, and similar designs have been used in the past for ion milling applications. Plasma of the appropriate 
gas is generated through conventional means and is then allowed to seep through holes in the electrodes. Ions 
can then be accelerated and neutralized before they bombard the substrate, resulting in energetic neutral-species 
bombardment on the substrate. Neutral beam sources are under development currently and have not yet been used 
for high-volume production. Another technique that has been utilized to alleviate plasma charge damage is
Lithography and Etching 457

Fig. 26 Schematic of an electron cyclotron resonance reactor.21
to generate the plasma remotely, i.e., away from the substrate, and transport neutral species to the substrate so that 
ions are either excluded or neutralized. Remote plasma sources or chemical downstream etchers are used for many 
plasma cleaning and material treatment applications. These etchers are also useful for high-rate removal of blanket 
films that do not have any patterned features. Their application for anisotropic etching applications is, however, 
limited due to the broad angular distribution of neutral etchants.
Single-Wafer Etcher
For modern circuits with nanometer feature sizes, etching processes are more critical. More vertical profiles, better 
linewidth control, higher selectivity, and better uniformity are necessary. One approach to this problem is to use 
single-wafer etchers that etch one wafer at a time. Single-wafer etchers can tailor the electrode geometry and 
gas flow to maximize etch uniformity across the wafer. These machines are easily automated to perform wafer 
cassette-to-cassette operations so that no operator handling is required. They can incorporate a 
Fig. 27 Neutral beam plasma etcher.
458 Semiconductors

load-locked chamber so that the process chamber need not be vented under normal use. This enhanced uniformity, 
combined with automatic endpoint detection and microprocessor control, can also provide good process control. 
A drawback of single-wafer etchers is that they must etch at higher rates to compete with the throughput of 
batch etchers. This constraint forces commercial singer-wafer etchers to operate at higher rf power densities and 
sometimes higher pressures, where process control and selectivity are more difficult to achieve. For this reason, 
some manufactures offer hybrid reactors that combine a few single-wafer etchers in one machine.
Clustered Plasma Processing
Semiconductor wafers are processed in clean rooms to minimize exposure to ambient particulate contamination. 
As device dimensions shrink, particulate contamination becomes a more serious problem. To minimize particulate 
contamination, clustered plasma tools use a wafer handler to pass wafers from one process chamber to another in 
a vacuum environment. The clustered plasma processing tools can also increase throughput. Figure 28 shows the 
multilayer metal interconnect (TiW/AlCu/TiW) etching process with clustered tools of an AlCu etch chamber, a 
TiW etch chamber, and a strip passivation chamber. The clustered tools provide an economic advantage through 
their high chip yield because the wafer is exposed to less ambient contamination and is handled less.
13.4.5 Plasma Diagnostics and End-Point Control
Plasma Diagnostics
Most processing plasmas emit radiation from infrared to ultraviolet. A simple analytical technique is to measure the 
intensity of these emissions  versus  wavelength  with  the  aid  of optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Using 
observed spectral peaks, it is usually possible to determine the presence of neutral and ionic species by correlating 
these emissions with previously determined spectral series. Relative concentrations of the species can be obtained 
by correlating changes in intensity with the plasma parameter. The emission signal derived from the primary 
etchant or byproduct begins to rise or fall at the end of the etch cycle.
Lithography and Etching 459

Fig. 29 The relative reflectance of the etching surface of a composite silicide/poly-Si layer. The end point of the etch is 
indicated by cessation of the reflective oscillation.
End-Point Control
Dry etching differs from wet chemical etching in that dry etching does not have enough etch selectivity to the 
underlying layer. Therefore, the plasma reactor must be equipped with a monitor that indicates when the etching 
process is to be terminated (i.e., an end point detection system). Laser interferometry of the wafer surface is 
used to continuously monitor etch rates and to determine the end point. During etching, the intensity of laser 
light reflected from a thin film surface oscillates because of the phase interference between the light reflected 
from the outer and inner interfaces of the etching layer. This layer must therefore be optically transparent or 
semitransparent to observe the oscillation. Figure 29 shows a typical signal from a silicide/polycrystalline Si gate 
etch. The period of the oscillation is related to the change in film thickness by
 
n
/ 2
d
 
(17)
where Δd is the change in film thickness for one period of reflected light, λ is the wavelength of the laser light, and 
n is the refractive index of the etching layer. For example, Δd for polysilicon is 80 nm, measured by using a helium-
neon laser source for which λ = 632.8 nm. The end point of the etch is indicated by the cessation of the reflection 
oscillation.
13.4.6 Etching Chemistries and Applications
Besides the etching equipment, etch chemistry also plays a critical role in the performance of etch processes. Table 2 
lists some etch chemistries for different etch processes.
Silicon Trench Etching
As device feature size decreases, a corresponding decrease is needed in the wafer surface area occupied by the 
isolation between circuit elements and the storage capacitor of a DRAM cell. This surface area can be reduced by 
etching trenches into the silicon substrate and filling them with suitable dielectric or conductive materials. Deep 
trenches, usually with depths greater than 5 μm, are used mainly for forming storage capacitors. Shallow trenches, 
usually with depths less than 1 μm, are often used for isolation.
Chlorine-based and bromine-based chemistries have a high silicon etch rate and high etch selectivity to the 
silicon dioxide mask. The combination HBr + NF3 + SF6 + O2 gas mixtures is used to form a trench capacitor 
with a depth of ~7 μm. It is also used for shallow trench isolation etching. Aspect-ratio-dependent

etching (i.e., variation in etch rate with aspect ratio) is often observed in submicron-deep silicon trench etching, 
caused by limited ion and neutral transport within the trench. Trenches with large aspect ratios are etched more 
slowly than trenches with small aspect ratios.
Polysilicon and Polycide Gate Etching
Polysilicon or polycide (i.e., low-resistance metal silicides over polysilicon) is usually used as a gate material 
for MOS devices. Anisotropic etching and high etch selectivity to the gate oxide  are  the  most  important  
requirements  for  gate  etching. For example, the selectivity required in 1G DRAM is more than 150 (i.e., the 
ratio of etch rates for polycide and gate oxide is 150:1). Achieving high selectivity and etch anisotropy at the same 
time is difficult for most ion-enhanced etching processes. Therefore, multistep processing is used in which different 
etch steps in the process are optimized for etch anisotropy and selectivity. On the other hand, the trend in plasma 
technology for anisotropic etching and high selectivity is to utilize a low-pressure, high-density plasma using 
relatively low power. Most chlorine-based and bromine-based chemistries can be used for gate etching to achieve 
the required etch anisotropy and selectivity.
Dielectric Etching
The patterning of dielectrics, especially silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, is a key process in the manufacture of 
modern semiconductor devices. Because of their higher bonding energies, dielectric etching requires aggressive ion-
enhanced, fluorine-based plasma chemistry. Vertical profiles are achieved by sidewall passivation as discussed in 
Section 13.4.2, typically by introducing a carbon-containing fluorine species to the plasma (e.g., CF4, CHF3, C4F8). 
High ion-bombardment energies are required to remove this polymer layer from the oxide, as well as to mix the 
reactive species into the oxide surface to form SiFx products. 
A low-pressure, high-density plasma is advantageous for aspect-ratio-dependent etching. However, the high-
density plasma etchers (HDP, e.g., ICP and ECR) generate high-temperature electrons and subsequently produce 
a high degree of dissociation of ions and radicals, far more active radicals and ions than RIE or MERIE plasmas. 
In particular, a high F concentration worsens the selectivity to silicon. Various methods have been tried to enhance 
the selectivity in the high-density plasma. A parent gas with a high C/F ratio, such as C2H6, C4H8, or C5H8, has 
been successfully tried. Also, other methods to scavenge F radicals have been developed.22
Interconnect Metal Etching
Etching of a metallization layer is a very important step in IC fabrication. Aluminum, copper, and tungsten are the 
most popular materials used for interconnection. These materials usually require anisotropic etching. Chlorine-
based (e.g., Cl2/BCl3 mixture) chemistry has a very high chemical etch rate with aluminum and tends to produce an

deposition W and then using reaction ion etching etchback.
undercut during etching. Carbon-containing gas (e.g., CHF3) or N2 is added to form sidewall passivation during 
aluminum etching to obtain anisotropic etching.
Copper has attracted much attention because of its low resistivity (~1.7 μohm-cm) and superior resistance to 
electromigration compared with Al or Al alloys. However, because of the low volatility of copper halides, plasma 
etching at room temperature is difficult. Process temperatures higher than 200 oC are required to etch copper films. 
Therefore, the damascene process is used to form Cu interconnection without dry etching. Damascene processing, 
as discussed in Chapter 12, involves the creation of interconnect lines by first etching a trench or canal in a planar 
dielectric layer and then filling that trench with metal, such as aluminum or copper. In dual damascene processing 
shown in Fig. 26 in Section 12.5.4, Chapter 12, a second level is involved where a series of holes (i.e., contacts 
or vias) are etched and filled in addition to the trench. After filling, the metal and dielectric are planarized by 
chemical-mechanical processing (CMP). The advantage of damascene processing is that it eliminates the need for 
metal etch. This is an important concern as the industry moves from aluminum to copper interconnections.
Low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) tungsten (W) has been widely used for filling contact holes and first-level 
metallization because of its excellent deposition conformability. Both fluorine- and chlorine-based chemistries etch 
W and form volatile etch products. An important tungsten etch processes is the blanket W etchback to form a W 
plug. The blanket LPCVD W is deposited on top of a TiN barrier layer, as shown in Fig. 30. A two-step process 
is usually used. First, 90% of the W is etched at a high etch rate, and then the etch rate is reduced to remove the 
remaining W with an etchant with a high W-to-TiN selectivity.
 
SUMMARY 
The continued growth of the semiconductor industry is a direct result of the ability to transfer smaller and smaller 
circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers. The two major processes for transferring patterns are lithography and 
etching.
Currently, the vast majority of lithographic equipment is optical systems. The primary factor limiting 
resolution in optical lithography is diffraction. However, because of advancements in excimer lasers, photoresist 
chemistry, and resolution enhancement techniques such as the PSM, OPC and immersion technique, optical 
lithography will remain the mainstream technology, at least to the 32 nm generation.
Electron-beam lithography is the technology of choice for mask making and nanofabrication, in which new 
device concepts are explored. Other lithographic processing technologies are EUV and ion-beam lithography. 
Although all these have 100 nm or better resolution, each process has its own limitation: proximity effect in 
electron-beam lithography, mask blank production difficulties in EUV lithography, and stochastic space charge in 
ion-beam lithography.
At the present time, no obvious successor to optical lithography can be identified unambiguously. However, 
a mix-and-match approach can take advantage of the unique features of each lithographic process to improve 
resolution and to maximize throughput.
Wet chemical etching is used extensively in semiconductor processing. It is particularly suitable for blanket 
etching. We have discussed wet chemical etching processes for silicon and gallium arsenide, insulators, and metal

interconnections. The undercutting of the layer underneath the mask has resulted in loss of resolution in the 
etched pattern.
Dry etching methods are used to achieve high-fidelity pattern transfer. We have considered plasma 
fundamentals and various dry-etching systems, which have grown from relatively simple, parallel-plate 
configurations to complex chambers with multiple-frequency generators and a variety of process-control sensors.
The challenges for future etching technology are high etch selectivity, better critical-dimension control, high 
aspect-ratio–dependent etching, and low plasma-induced damage. Low-pressure, high-density plasma reactors 
are necessary to meet these requirements. As processing evolves from 300 mm to even larger wafers, continued 
improvements are required for etch uniformity within the wafer. New gas chemistries must be developed to provide 
the improved selectivity necessary for advanced integration circuits.

SUMMARY
Impurity doping is the introduction of controlled amounts of impurity dopants into semiconductor materials. The 
practical use of impurity doping is primarily to change the electrical properties of the semiconductors. Diffusion 
and ion implantation are the two key methods of impurity doping. Until the early 1970s, impurity doping was done 
mainly by diffusion at elevated temperatures, as shown in Fig. 1a. In this method the dopant atoms are placed on 
or near the surface of the wafer by deposition from the gas phase of the dopant or by using doped-oxide sources. 
The doping concentration decreases monotonically from the surface, and the profile of the dopant distribution is 
determined mainly by the temperature and diffusion time.
Since the early 1970s, many doping operations have been performed by ion implantation, as shown in Fig. 
1b. In this process the dopant ions are implanted into the semiconductor by means of an ion beam. The doping 
concentration has a peak distribution inside the semiconductor and the profile of the dopant distribution is 
determined mainly by the ion mass and the implanted-ion energy. Both diffusion and ion implantation are used in 
fabricating discrete devices and integrated circuits because these processes generally complement each other.1,2 For 
example, diffusion is used to form a deep junction (e.g., a twin well in CMOS), whereas ion implantation is used to 
form a shallow junction (e.g.. a source/drain junction of a MOSFET).
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
 The movement of impurity atoms in the crystal lattice under high temperature and high  
concentration-gradient conditions.
r
Impurity profiles for constant diffusivity and concentration-dependent diffusivity.

The impact of lateral diffusion and impurity redistribution on device characteristics.

implantation.

semiconductor substrate.
 
14.1 BASIC DIFFUSION PROCESS
Diffusion of impurities is typically done by placing semiconductor wafers in a carefully controlled high-
temperature quartz-tube furnace and passing a gas mixture that contains the desired dopant through it. The 
temperature usually ranges between 800° and 1200°C for silicon and 600° and 1000°C for gallium arsenide. The 
number of dopant atoms that diffuse into the semiconductor is related to the partial pressure of the dopant 
impurity in the gas mixture.
For diffusion in silicon, boron is the most popular dopant for introducing a p-type impurity, whereas arsenic 
and phosphorus are used extensively as n-type dopants. These three elements are highly soluble in silicon, as they 
have solubilities above 5 × 1020 cm-3 in the diffusion temperature range. These dopants can be introduced in several 
ways, including solid sources (e.g., BN for boron, As2O3 for arsenic, and P2O5 for phosphorus), liquid sources (BBr3 
AsCl3, and POCl3), and gaseous sources (B2H6, AsH3, and PH3). However, liquid sources are most commonly 
used. A schematic diagram of the furnace and gas flow arrangement for a liquid source is shown in Fig. 2. This 
arrangement is similar to that used for thermal oxidation. An example of the chemical reaction for phosphorus 
diffusion using a liquid source is
 
4POCl3 + 3O2 → 2P2O5 + 6Cl2 ↑. 
(1)
The P2O5 forms a glass on a silicon wafer and is then reduced to phosphorus by silicon,
 
2P2O5 + 5Si → 4P + 5SiO2; 
(2)
the phosphorus is released and diffuses into the silicon and Cl2 is vented.
For diffusion in gallium arsenide, the high vapor pressure of arsenic requires special methods to prevent 
the loss of arsenic by decomposition or evaporation.2 These methods include diffusion in sealed ampules with 
an overpressure of arsenic and diffusion in an open-tube furnace with a doped-oxide capping layer (e.g., silicon 
nitride). Most of the studies on p-type diffusion have been confined to the use of zinc in the forms of Zn-Ga-As 
alloys and ZnAs2 for the sealed-ampule approach or ZnO-SiO2 for the open-tube approach. The n-type dopants in 
gallium arsenide include selenium and tellurium.
Impurity Doping 467

Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of a typical open-tube diffusion system.
14.1.1 Diffusion Equation
Diffusion in a semiconductor can be visualized as atomic movement of the diffusant (dopant atoms) in the crystal 
lattice by vacancies or interstitials. Fig.3 shows the two basic atomic-diffusion models in a solid.1,3 The open circles 
represent the host atoms occupying the equilibrium lattice positions and the solid dots represent impurity atoms. 
At elevated temperatures the lattice atoms vibrate around the equilibrium lattice sites. There is a finite probability 
that a host atom acquires sufficient energy to leave the lattice site and become an interstitial atom, thereby creating 
a vacancy. When a neighboring impurity atom migrates to the vacancy site as illustrated in Fig. 3a, the mechanism 
is called vacancy diffusion. If an interstitial atom moves from one place to another without occupying a lattice site 
(Fig. 3b), the mechanism is interstitial diffusion. An atom smaller than the host atom often moves interstitially.
In addition, there is extended interstitial diffusion, sometimes called interstitialcy diffusion. The interstitial 
host atom (self-interstitial) pushes the substitutional impurity atom into an interstitial site. Subsequently, the 
impurity atom displaces another host atom and creates a new self-interstitial. Then the process is repeated. 
Interstitialcy diffusion is faster than substitutional diffusion. Vacancy and interstitialcy diffusion are considered 
the dominant mechanisms for diffusion of P, B, As, and Sb in silicon. Phosphorus and boron diffuse via a dual 
(vacancy and interstitialcy) mechanism, with the interstitialcy component dominating. Arsenic and antimony 
diffuse predominately via a vacancy mechanism.1
The basic diffusion process of impurity atoms is similar to that of charge curriers (electrons and holes), 
discussed in Chapter 2. Accordingly, we define a flux F as the number of dopant atoms passing through a unit area 
in a unit time and C as the dopant concentration per unit volume. From Eq. 27 in Chapter 2, we have

where we have substituted C for the carrier concentration and the proportionality constant D is the diffusion 
coefficient or diffusivity. Note that the basic driving force of the diffusion process is the concentration gradient  
dC/dx. The flux is proportional to the concentration gradient, and the dopant atoms will move (diffuse) away  
from a high-concentration region toward a lower-concentration region.
If we substitute Eq. 3 into the one-dimensional continuity equation, Eq. 56 in Chapter 2, under the condition 
that no materials are formed or consumed in the host semiconductor (i.e., Gn = Rn = 0), we obtain

where D0 is the diffusion coefficient in cm2/s extrapolated to infinite temperature and Ea is the activation energy in

For the interstitial diffusion model, Ea is related to the energies required to move dopant atoms from one 
interstitial site to another. The values of Ea are found to be between 0.5 and 2 eV in both silicon and gallium 
arsenide. For the vacancy diffusion model, Ea is related to both the energies of motion and the energies of 
formation of vacancies. Thus, Ea for vacancy diffusion is larger than that for interstitial diffusion; usually between 
3 and 5 eV.
For fast diffusants, such as Cu in Si and GaAs, shown in the upper portion of Fig. 4a and 4b, the measured 
activation energies are less than 2 eV, and interstitial atomic movement is the dominant diffusion mechanism. For 
slow diffusants, such as As in Si and GaAs, shown in the lower portion of Fig. 4a and 4b, Ea is larger than 3 eV, 
and vacancy diffusion is the dominant mechanism. For interstitialcy-dominated diffusion, such as P in silicon, Ea 
is also larger than 3 eV, but the diffusion coefficient is four times greater than As over the temperature range shown 
in Fig. 4a.

14.1.2 Diffusion Profiles
The diffusion profile of the dopant atoms is dependent on the initial and boundary conditions. In this subsection 
we consider two important cases, namely, constant-surface-concentration diffusion and constant-total-dopant 
diffusion. In the first case, impurity atoms are transported from a vapor source onto the semiconductor surface 
and diffuse into the semiconductor wafers. The vapor source maintains a constant level of surface concentration 
during the entire diffusion period. In the second case, a fixed amount of dopant is deposited onto the 
semiconductor surface and is subsequently diffused into the wafers.
Constant-Surface-Concentration Diffusion
The initial condition at t = 0 is
 
C(x, 0) = 0, 
(7)
which states that the dopant concentration in the host semiconductor is initially zero. The boundary conditions are
 
C(0, t) = Cs 
(8a)
470 Semiconductors

and
 
C(∞, t) = 0 
(8b)
where Cs is the surface concentration (at x = 0), which is independent of time. The second boundary condition 
states that at large distances from the surface there are no impurity atoms.
The solution of the diffusion equation (Eq. 5) that satisfies the initial and boundary conditions is given by6

condition is shown in Fig. 5a, where we plot, on both linear (upper) and logarithmic (lower) scales, the normalized 
concentration as a function of depth for three values of the diffusion length 
Dt  corresponding to three 
consecutive diffusion times and a fixed D for a given diffusion temperature. Note that as the time progresses, the 
dopant penetrates deeper into the semiconductor.

Constant–Total-Dopant Diffusion
For this case, a fixed (or constant) amount of dopant is deposited onto the semiconductor surface in a thin layer 
and the dopant subsequently diffuses into the semiconductor. The initial condition is the same as in Eq. 7. The 
boundary conditions are

This expression is the Gaussian distribution. Since the dopant will move into the semiconductor as time increases,

In integrated-circuit processing, a two-step diffusion process is commonly used in which a predeposition 
diffused layer is first formed under a constant–surface–concentration condition. This step is followed by a drive-in 
diffusion (also called redistribution diffusion) under a constant–total-dopant condition. For most practical cases, 
the diffusion length 
Dt  for the predeposition diffusion is much smaller than the diffusion length for the drive-in 
diffusion. Therefore, we can consider the predeposition profile as a delta function at the surface, and we can regard 
the extent of the penetration of the predeposition profile as negligibly small compared with that of the final profile 
that results from the drive-in step.

Arsenic was predeposited by arsine gas and the resulting total amount of dopant per unit area is 1 × 1014 atoms/

14.1.3 Evaluation of Diffused Layers
The results of a diffusion process can be evaluated by three measurements—the junction depth, the sheet 
resistance, and the dopant profile of the diffused layer. The junction depth can be delineated by cutting a groove 
into the semiconductor and etching the surface with a solution (e.g., 100 cm3 HF and a few drops of HNO3 for 
silicon) that stains the p-type region darker than the n-type region, as illustrated in Fig. 6a. If R0 is the radius of 
the tool used to form the groove, then the junction depth xj is given by

(18)
The junction depth xj as illustrated in Fig. 6b is the position where the dopant concentration equals the 
substrate concentration CB, or
 
C(xj) = CB. 
(19)
Thus, if the junction depth and CB are known, the surface concentration Cs and the impurity distribution can be 
calculated, provided the diffusion profile follows one or the other simple equation derived in Section 14.1.2.
The resistance of a diffused layer can be measured by the four-point probe technique described in Chapter 
2. The sheet resistance R is related to the junction depth xj, the carrier mobility μ (which is a function of the total 
impurity concentration), and the impurity distribution C(x) by the following expression:7

For a given diffusion profile, the average resistivity ρ = Rx j  is uniquely related to the surface concentration Cs and 
the substrate-doping concentration for an assumed diffusion profile. Design curves relating C and   have been 
calculated for simple diffusion profiles, such as the erfc or Gaussian distribution.8 To use these curves correctly 
we must be sure that the diffusion profiles agree with the assumed profiles. For low concentrations and deep 
diffusions, the diffusion profiles generally can be represented by the aforementioned simple functions. However, 
as we discuss in the next section, for high concentrations and shallow diffusions, the diffusion profiles cannot be 
represented by these simple functions.

concentration are equal. 
Impurity Doping 475

The diffusion profile can be measured using the capacitance-voltage technique described in Chapter 7. The 
majority carrier profile, which is equal to the impurity profile if impurities are fully ionized, can be determined by 
measuring the reverse-bias capacitance of a p-n junction or a Schottky barrier diode as a function of the applied 
voltage. A more elaborate method is the secondary-ion–mass spectroscope (SIMS) technique, which measures the 
total impurity profile. In the SIMS technique, an ion beam sputters material off the surface of a semiconductor, 
and the ion component is detected and mass analyzed. This technique has high sensitivity to many elements, such 
as boron and arsenic, and is an ideal tool for providing the precision needed for profile measurements in high-
concentration or shallow-junction diffusions.9
 
14.2  EXTRINSIC DIFFUSION
The diffusion profiles described in Section 14.1 are for constant diffusivities. These profiles occur when the doping 
concentration is lower than the intrinsic-carrier concentration ni (T) at the diffusion temperature. For example, 
at T = 1000°C, ni equals 5 × 1018 cm–3 for silicon and 5 × 1017 cm–3 for gallium arsenide. The diffusivity at low 
concentrations is often referred to as the intrinsic diffusivity Di (T). Doping profiles that have concentrations less 
than ni (T) are in the intrinsic diffusion region as indicated in the left side of Fig. 7. In this region, the resulting 
dopant profiles of sequential or simultaneous diffusions of n- and p-type impurities can be determined by 
superposition; that is, the diffusions can be treated independently. However, when the impurity concentration, 
including both the substrate and the dopant, is greater than ni (T), the semiconductor becomes extrinsic and the 
diffusivity is considered to be extrinsic. In the extrinsic diffusion region the diffusivity becomes concentration 
dependent.10 In the extrinsic diffusion region the diffusion profiles are more complicated, and there are interactions 
and cooperative effects among the sequential or simultaneous diffusions.
14.2.1 Concentration-Dependent Diffusivity
As mentioned previously, when a host atom acquires sufficient energy from the lattice vibration to leave its lattice 
site, a vacancy is created. The presence of a vacancy in a crystal results in four unsatisfied and distorted bonds. 
The electrons of these bonds may spill into the vacancy. A neutral vacancy will act as an acceptor by acquiring 
a negative charge, V 0 + e– = V –. Therefore, depending on the charges associated with a vacancy, we can have a 
neutral vacancy V 0, an acceptor vacancy V –, a double-charged acceptor vacancy V 2–, a donor vacancy V +, and so 
forth. We expect that the vacancy density of a given charge state (i.e., the number of vacancies per unit

diffusion.10

where Ci is the intrinsic vacancy density, EF is the Fermi level, and Ei is the intrinsic Fermi level.
If the dopant diffusion is dominated by the vacancy mechanism, the diffusion coefficient is expected to be 
proportional to the vacancy density. At low doping concentrations (n < ni), the Fermi level coincides with the 
intrinsic Fermi level (EF = Ei). The vacancy density is equal to Ci and is independent of doping concentration. 
The diffusion coefficient, which is proportional to Ci, also is independent of doping concentration. At high 
concentrations (n > ni), the Fermi level will move toward the conduction band edge (for donor-type vacancies), 
and the term [exp (EF – Ei)/kT] becomes larger than unity. This causes CV to increase, which in turn causes the 
diffusion coefficient to increase, as shown in the right side of Fig. 7.
When the diffusion coefficient varies with dopant concentration, Eq. 4 should be used as the diffusion 
equation instead of Eq. 5, in which D is independent of C. We consider the case where the diffusion coefficient can 
be written as

where Cs is the surface concentration, Ds is the diffusion coefficient at the surface, C and D are the concentration 
and the diffusion coefficient in the bulk, and γ is a parameter to describe the concentration dependence. For such a 
case, we can write the diffusion equation, Eq. 4, as an ordinary differential equation and solve it numerically.
Figure 8 shows the solutions11 for a constant–surface-concentration diffusion with different values of γ. For 
γ = 0, we have the case of constant diffusivity and the profile is the same as that shown in Fig. 5a. For γ > 0 the 
diffusivity decreases as the dopant concentration decreases, and increasingly steep and box-like concentration 
profiles result for increasing γ. Therefore, highly abrupt junctions are formed when diffusions are made into a 
background of an opposite impurity type due to higher impurity concentration. The abruptness of the doping 
profile results in a junction depth virtually independent of the background concentration. Note that the junction 
depth (see Fig. 8) is given by

In the case of γ = –2, the diffusivity increases with decreasing concentration, which leads to a concave profile, as 
opposed to the convex profiles for other cases.

14.2.2 Diffusion Profiles
Diffusion in Silicon
The measured diffusion coefficients of boron and arsenic in silicon have a concentration dependence with γ ≅ 1. 
Their concentration profiles are abrupt, as depicted in curve c of Fig. 8. For gold and platinum diffusion in silicon, 
γ is close to –2 and their concentration profiles have the concave shape shown in curve d of Fig. 8.
The diffusion of phosphorus in silicon is associated with the doubly charged acceptor vacancy V2–, and the 
diffusion coefficient at high concentration varies as C2. We would expect that the diffusion profile of phosphorus 
resembles that shown in curve b of Fig. 8. However, because of a dissociation effect, the diffusion profile exhibits 
anomalous behavior.
Figure 9 shows phosphorus diffusion profiles for various surface concentrations after diffusion into silicon 
for 1 hour at 1000°C.12 When the surface concentration is low, corresponding to the intrinsic diffusion region, 
the diffusion profile is given by an erfc (curve a). As the concentration increases, the profile begins to deviate 
from the simple expression (curves b and c). At very high concentration (curve d), the profile near the surface is 
indeed similar to that in curve b of Fig. 8. However, at concentration ne, a kink occurs and is followed by a rapid 
diffusion in the tail region. The concentration ne corresponds to a Fermi level 0.11 eV below the conduction 
band. At this energy level, the coupled impurity-vacancy pair (P+V2–) dissociates to P+, V–, and an electron. Thus, 
the dissociation generates a large number of singly charged acceptor vacancies V–, which in turn enhances the 
diffusion in the tail region of the profile. The diffusivity in the tail region is over 10–12 cm2/s, which is about two 
orders of magnitude larger than the intrinsic diffusivity at 1000°C. Because of its high diffusivity, phosphorus is 
commonly used to form deep junctions, such as the n-tubs in CMOS.

Zinc Diffusion in Gallium Arsenide
We expect diffusion in gallium arsenide to be more complicated than in silicon because the diffusion of impurities 
may involve atomic movements on both the gallium and arsenic sublattices. Vacancies play a dominant role in 
diffusion processes in gallium arsenide because both p- and n-type impurities must ultimately reside in lattice sites. 
However, the charge states of the vacancies have not been established.
Zinc is the most extensively studied diffusant in gallium arsenide. Its diffusion coefficient is found to vary as 
C2. Therefore, the diffusion profiles are steep, as shown13 in Fig. 10, and resemble curve b of Fig. 8. Note that even 
for the case of the lowest surface concentration, the diffusion is in the extrinsic-diffusion region, because ni for 
GaAs at 1000oC is less than 1018 cm-3. As can be seen in Fig.10, the surface concentration has a profound effect 
on the junction depth. The diffusivity varies linearly with the partial pressure of the zinc vapor, and the surface 
concentration is proportional to the square root of the partial pressure. Therefore, from Eq. 23, the junction depth 
is linearly proportional to the surface concentration.
Diffusion in Strained Silicon
Strained silicon is a promising candidate for the channel of MOSFET due to the high mobility of the carriers.14,15 
In the meantime, strain can alter the activation energy of many major steps involved in dopant diffusion, including 
formation of native defects and displacement of a dopant atom to form a mobile dopant complex. Strain-related 
bandgap narrowing can also change the charged point-defect concentration. Therefore, the diffusion associated 
with the defect concentration is a strong function of the strain. It impacts junction depth and effective channel 
length. The strain-related effects are strong for MOSFETs with scale less than 65 nm.
Impurity Doping 479

Fig. 10 Diffusion profiles13 of zinc in GaAs after annealing at 1000°C for 2.7 hours. The different surface 
concentrations are obtained by maintaining the Zn source at temperatures in the range of 600°-800°C.
Under compressive stress, the lattice constant of Si near the surface becomes smaller. To relieve it, Si atoms 
near the surface jump to the surface, and vacancies are created near the surface. These vacancies diffuse into 
the bulk and recombine with self-interstitials to decrease self-interstitials. As discussed in Section 14.1.1, since 
both phosphorus and boron diffuse mainly through an interstitialcy mechanism, the compressive stress results 
in retarded diffusion.16 Tensile stress has opposite effects to compressive stress: the lattice constant of Si becomes 
larger and the interstitial-mediated diffusion is enhanced. The vacancy concentration is lower due to the lattice 
relaxation and the vacancy-mediated diffusion is retarded. 
 
14.3 DIFFUSION-RELATED PROCESSES
In this section we consider two processes in which diffusion plays an important role and the impact of these 
processes on device performance.
14.3.1 Lateral Diffusion
The one-dimensional diffusion equation discussed previously can describe the diffusion process satisfactorily 
except at the edge of the mask window. Here the impurities will diffuse downward and sideways (i.e., laterally). 
In this case, we must consider a two-dimensional diffusion equation and use a numerical technique to obtain the 
diffusion profiles under different initial and boundary conditions.
Figure 11 shows the contours of constant doping concentration for a constant-surface-concentration 
diffusion condition assuming that the diffusivity is independent of concentration.17 At the far right of the figure, 
the variation of the dopant concentration from 0.5 to 10-4 C/CS (where CS is the surface concentration) corresponds 
to the erfc distribution given by Eq. 9. The contours are in effect a map of the locations of the junctions created 
by diffusing into various background concentrations. For example, at C/CS =10-4 (i.e., the background doping is 
104 times lower than the surface concentration), we see from this constant-concentration curve that the vertical 
penetration is about 2.8 μm, whereas the lateral penetration (i.e., the penetration along the diffusion
480 Semiconductors

Fig. 11 Diffusion contours at the edge of an oxide window, where rj is the radius of curvature.17
mask-semiconductor interface) is about 2.3 μm. Therefore, the lateral penetration is about 80% of the penetration 
in the vertical direction for concentrations three or more orders of magnitude below the surface concentration. 
Similar results are obtained for a constant-total-dopant diffusion condition. The ratio of lateral to vertical 
penetration is about 75%. For concentration-dependent diffusivities, the ratio is found to be reduced slightly, to 
about 65%-70%.
Because of the lateral-diffusion effect, the junction consists of a central plane (or flat) region with 
approximately cylindrical edges with a radius of curvature rj, as shown in Fig. 11. In addition, if the diffusion 
mask contains sharp corners, the shape of the junction near the corner will be roughly spherical because of lateral 
diffusion. Since the electric- field intensities are higher for cylindrical and spherical junction regions, the avalanche 
breakdown voltages of such regions can be substantially lower than that of a plane junction having the same 
background doping. This junction “curvature effect” was discussed in Chapter 3.
14.3.2  Impurity Redistribution During Oxidation
Dopant impurities near the silicon surface will be redistributed during thermal oxidation. The redistribution 
depends on several factors. When two solid phases are brought together, an impurity in one solid will redistribute 
between the two solids until it reaches equilibrium. This is similar to our previous discussion on impurity 
redistribution in crystal growth from the melt. The ratio of the equilibrium concentration of the impurity in the 
silicon to that in the silicon dioxide is called the segregation coefficient and is defined as
 
k  equilibrium concentration  of impurity in silicon
equilibrium concentration of impurity in SiO2
. 
(24)
A second factor that influences impurity distribution is that the impurity may diffuse rapidly through the 
silicon dioxide and escape to the gaseous ambient. If the diffusivity of the impurity in silicon dioxide is large, 
this factor will be important. A third factor in the redistribution process is that the oxide is growing, and thus 
the boundary between the silicon and the oxide advances into the silicon as a function of time. The relative rate 
of this advance compared with the diffusion rate of the impurity through the oxide is important in determining 
the extent of the redistribution. Note that even if the segregation coefficient of an impurity k equals unity, some 
redistribution of the impurity in the silicon will still take place. As indicated in Fig. 3 of Chapter 12, the oxide layer 
will be about twice as thick as the silicon layer it replaced. Therefore, the same amount of impurity will now be 
distributed in a larger volume, resulting in a depletion of the impurity from the silicon.
Impurity Doping 481

Four possible redistribution processes are illustrated6 in Fig. 12. These processes can be classified into two 
groups. In one group the oxide takes up the impurity (Fig. 12a and and b for k<1), and in the other the oxide 
rejects the impurity (Fig.12c and d for k >1). In each case, what happens depends on how rapidly the impurity 
can diffuse through the oxide. In group 1, the silicon surface is depleted of impurities; an example is boron with k 
approximately equal to 0.3. Rapid diffusion of the impurity through the silicon dioxide increases the amount of 
depletion; an example is boron-doped silicon heated in a hydrogen ambient because hydrogen in silicon dioxide 
enhances the diffusivity of boron. In group 2, k is greater than unity, so that the oxide rejects the impurity. If 
diffusion of the impurity through the silicon dioxide is relatively slow, the impurity piles up near the silicon 
surface; an example is phosphorus, with k approximately equal to 10. When diffusion through the silicon dioxide is 
rapid, so much impurity may escape from the solid to the gaseous ambient that the overall effect will be a depletion 
of the impurity; an example is gallium, with k approximately equal to 20.
The redistributed dopant impurities in silicon dioxide are seldom electrically active. However, redistribution 
in silicon has an important effect on processing and device performance. For example, nonuniform dopant 
distribution will modify the interpretation of the measurements of interface-trap properties (see Chapter 6), and 
a change in the surface concentration will modify the threshold voltage and device contact resistance (see Chapter 
7).

14.4 RANGE OF IMPLANTED IONS
Ion implantation is the introduction of energetic charged particles into a substrate such as silicon. Implantation 
energies are between 300 eV and 5 MeV, resulting in ion distributions with average depths ranging from 10 nm 
to 10 μm. Ion doses vary from 1012 ions/cm2 for threshold voltage adjustment to 1018 ions/cm2 for the formation 
of a buried insulating layer. Note that the dose is expressed as the number of ions implanted into 1 cm2 of 
the semiconductor surface area. The main advantages of ion implantation are its more precise control and 
reproducibility of impurity dopings and its lower processing temperature than those of the diffusion process.
Basic CMOS processes usually use fifteen to seventeen ion implants per wafer. Current leading-edge CMOS 
processes use 20 to 23 implants, and specialized CMOS circuits (e.g., flash memory) use up to 30 implantation 
steps. Virtually all doping in modern CMOS devices is accomplished by ion implantation; no other technique 
offers comparable process control and repeatability for both the amount and position of the doping. 
Figure 13 shows schematically a medium-energy ion implantor.18 The ion source has a heated filament to 
break up a source gas such as BF3 or AsH3 into charged ions (B+ or As+). An extraction voltage, around 40 kV, 
causes the charged ions to move out of the ion source chamber into a mass analyzer. The magnetic field of the 
analyzer is chosen such that only ions with the desired mass-to-charge ratio can travel through it without being 
filtered. The selected ions then enter the acceleration tube, where they are accelerated to the implantation energy as 
they move from high voltage to ground. Apertures ensure that the ion beam is well collimated. The pressure in the 
implantor is kept below 10-4 Pa to minimize ion scattering by gas molecules. The ion beam is then scanned over the 
wafer surface using electrostatic deflection plates and is implanted into the semiconductor substrate.
The energetic ions lose their energies through collision with electrons and nuclei in the substrate and finally 
come to rest at some depth within the lattice. The average depth can be controlled by adjusting the acceleration 
energy. The dopant dose can be controlled by monitoring the ion current during implantation. The principal 
side effect is the disruption or damage of the semiconductor lattice due to ion collisions. Therefore, a subsequent 
annealing treatment is needed to remove these damages.

Impurity Doping 483

14.4.1 Ion Distribution
The total distance that an ion travels in coming to rest is called its range R and is illustrated19 in Fig. 14a. The 
projection of this distance along the axis of incidence is called the projected range RP. Because the number 
of collisions per unit distance and the energy lost per collision are random variables, there will be a spatial 
distribution of ions having the same mass and the same initial energy. The statistical fluctuations in the projected 
range are called the projected straggle σp. There is also a statistical fluctuation along an axis perpendicular to the 
axis of incidence, called the lateral straggle σ⊥.
Figure l4b shows the ion distribution. Along the axis of incidence, the implanted impurity profile can be 
approximated by a Gaussian distribution function:

where S is the ion dose per unit area. This equation is similar to Eq. 14 for constant-total-dopant diffusion, except 
that the quantity 4Dt is replaced by 2σp
2 and the distribution is shifted along the x-axis by Rp.
Fig. 14 (a) Schematic of the ion range R and projected range σp. (b) Two-dimensional distribution of the implanted 
ions.19
484 Semiconductors

Thus, for diffusion, the maximum concentration is at x = 0, whereas for ion implantation the maximum 
concentration is at the projected range Rp. The ion concentration is reduced by 40 % from its peak value at  
(x– Rp) = ± σp, by one decade at ± 2σp by two decades at ± 3σp, and by five decades at ± 4.8 σp.
Along the axis perpendicular to the axis of incidence, the distribution is also a Gaussian function of the 
form exp(– y2/2σ⊥
2). Because of this distribution, there will be some lateral implantation.20 However, the lateral 
penetration from the mask edge (on the order of σ⊥) is considerably smaller than that from the thermal diffusion 
process discussed in Section 14.3.
14.4.2 Ion Stopping
There are two stopping mechanisms by which an energetic ion, on entering a semiconductor substrate (also called 
the target), can be brought to rest. The first is by transferring its energy to the target nuclei. This causes deflection 
of the incident ion and also dislodges many target nuclei from their original lattice sites. If E is the energy of 
the ion at any point x along its path, we can define a nuclear stopping power Sn(E) ≡ (dE/dx)n to characterize 
this process. The second stopping mechanism is the interaction of the incident ion with the cloud of electrons 
surrounding the target’s atoms. The ion loses energy in collisions with electrons through Coulombic interaction. 
The electrons can be excited to higher energy levels (excitation), or they can be ejected from the atom (ionization). 
We can define an electronic stopping power Se(E) ≡ (dE/dx)e to characterize this process.
The average rate of energy loss with distance is given by a superposition of the above two stopping 
mechanisms:

where E0 is the initial ion energy. The quantity R has been defined previously as the range.
We can visualize the nuclear stopping process by considering the elastic collision between an incoming hard 
sphere (energy E0 and mass M1) and a target hard sphere (initial energy zero and mass M2),

as illustrated in Fig. 15. When the spheres collide, momentum is transferred along the centers of the spheres. 
The deflection angle θ and the velocities υ1 and υ2 can be obtained from the requirements for conservation of 
momentum and energy. The maximum energy loss is in a head-on collision. For this case, the energy loss by the 
incident particle M1 or the energy transferred to M2 is

Since M2 is usually of the same order of magnitude as M1, a large amount of energy can be transferred in the 
nuclear stopping process.
Detailed calculations show that the nuclear stopping power increases linearly with energy at low energies 
(similar to Eq. 28), and Sn(E) reaches a maximum at some intermediate energy. At high energies, Sn(E) becomes 
smaller because fast particles may not have sufficient interaction time with the target atoms to achieve effective 
energy transfer. The calculated values of Sn(E) for arsenic, phosphorus, and boron in silicon at various energies are 
shown in Fig. 16 (solid line, where the superscript indicates the atomic weight).21 Note that heavier atoms, such as 
arsenic, have larger nuclear stopping power, that is, larger energy loss per unit distance.
The electronic stopping power is found to be proportional to the velocity of the incident ion, or

where the coefficient ke is a relatively weak function of atomic mass and atomic number. The value of ke is 
approximately 107 (eV)1/2/cm for silicon and 3 × 107 (eV)1/2/cm for gallium arsenide. The electronic stopping power 
in silicon is plotted in Fig. 16 (dotted line). Also shown in the figure are the crossover energies at which Se(E)

equal Sn(E). For boron, which has a relatively low ion mass compared with the target silicon atom, the crossover 
energy is only 10 keV. This means that over most of the implantation energy range of 1 keV to 1 MeV, the main 
energy loss mechanism is electronic stopping. On the other hand, for arsenic with relatively high ion mass, the 
crossover energy is 700 keV. Thus, nuclear stopping dominates over most of the energy range. For phosphorus, 
the crossover energy is 130 keV. For an E0 less than 130 keV, nuclear stopping will dominate; for higher energies, 
electronic stopping will take over.
Once Sn(E) ans Se(E) are known, we can calculate the range from Eq. 27. This in turn can give us the projected 
range and projected straggle with the help of the following approximate equations18:

Figure 17a shows the projected range (Rp), the projected straggle (σp), and the lateral straggle (σ⊥) for arsenic, 
boron, and phosphorus in silicon.22 As expected, the larger the energy loss, the smaller the range. Also, the 
projected range and straggles increase with ion energy. For a given element at a specific incident energy, σp and σ⊥ 
are comparable and usually within ± 20 %. Figure 17b shows the corresponding values for hydrogen, zinc, and

hydrogen) have larger projected ranges in silicon than they have in gallium arsenic.

14.4.3  Ion Channeling
The projected range and straggle of the Gaussian distribution discussed previously give a good description of 
the implanted ions in amorphous or fine-grained polycrystalline substrates. Both silicon and gallium arsenide 
behave as if they were amorphous semiconductors, provided the ion beam is misoriented from the low-index 
crystallographic direction (e.g., <111>). In this situation, the doping profile described by Eq. 25 is followed closely 
near the peak and extended to one or two decades below the peak value. This is illustrated19 in Fig. 18. However, 
even for a misorientation of 7° from the <111>-axis, there still is a tail that varies exponentially with distance as 
exp (–x/λ), where λ is typically on the order 0.1 μm.
The exponential tail is related to the ion-channeling effect. Channeling occurs when incident ions align with 
a major crystallographic direction and are guided between rows of atoms in a crystal. Figure 19 illustrates a 
diamond lattice viewed along a <110>-direction.23 Ions implanted in the <110>-direction will follow trajectories 
that will not bring them close enough to a target atom to lose significant amounts of energy in nuclear collisions. 
Thus, for channeled ions, the only energy loss mechanism is electronic stopping and the range of channeled ions 
can be significantly larger than it would be in an amorphous target. Ion channeling is particularly critical for low-
energy implant and heavy ions. 
Channeling can be minimized by several techniques: a blocking amorphous surface layer, wafer 
misorientation, and creating a damage layer in the wafer surface. The usual blocking amorphous layer is simply a 
thin layer of grown silicon dioxide (Fig. 20a). The layer randomizes the direction of the ion beam so that the

ions enter the wafer at different angles and not directly down the crystal channels. Misorientation of the wafers 
5°-10° from the major plane also has the effect of preventing the ions from entering the channels (Fig. 20b). With 
this method, most implantation machines tilt the wafer by 7° and then apply a 22° twist from the flat to prevent 
channeling. Predamaging the wafer surface with a heavy silicon or germanium implant creates a randomizing 
layer in the wafer surface (Fig. 20c). This method, however, increases the use of the expensive ion implantor and 
produces point defects that become leakage paths during subsequent processing.
 
14.5  IMPLANT DAMAGE AND ANNEALING
14.5.1 Implant Damage
When energetic ions enter a semiconductor substrate, they lose their energy in a series of nuclear and electronic 
collisions and finally come to rest. The electronic-energy loss can be accounted for in terms of electronic 
excitations to higher energy levels or of the generation of electron-hole pairs. However, electronic collisions do not 
displace semiconductor atoms from their lattice positions. Only nuclear collisions can transfer sufficient energy 
to the lattice that host atoms are displaced, resulting in implant damage (also called lattice disorder).24 These 
displaced atoms may possess large fractions of the incident energy, and can in turn cause cascades of secondary 
displacement of nearby atoms to form a tree of disorder along the ion path. When the displaced atoms per unit 
volume approach the atomic density of the semiconductor, the material becomes amorphous.
The tree of disorder for light ions is quite different from that for heavy ions. Much of the energy loss for 
light ions., 11B+ in silicon (e.g) is due to electronic collisions (see Fig. 16), which do not cause lattice damage. The 
ions lose their energies as they penetrate deeper into the substrate. Eventually, the ion energy is reduced below the 
crossover energy (10 keV for boron) where nuclear stopping becomes dominant. Therefore, most of the lattice 
disorder occurs near the final ion position. This is illustrated in Fig. 21a.
We can estimate the damage by considering a 100 keV boron ion. Its projected range is 0.31 μm, (Fig.17a), 
and its initial nuclear energy loss is only 3 eV/Å (Fig.16). Since the spacing between lattice planes in silicon is about 
2.5 Å, this means that the boron ion will lose 7.5 eV for each lattice plane because of nuclear stopping. The energy 
required to displace a silicon atom from its lattice position is about 15 eV. Therefore, the incident boron ion does 
not release enough energy from nuclear stopping to displace a silicon atom when it first enters the silicon substrate. 
When the ion energy is reduced to about 50 keV (at a depth of 1500 Å), the energy loss due to nuclear stopping 
increases to 15 eV for each lattice plane (i.e., 6 eV/ Å), sufficient to create a lattice disorder. Assuming that one 
atom is displaced per lattice plane for moves roughly 25 Å from its original position, the damage volume is

Fig. 21 Implantation disorder caused by (a) light ions and (b) heavy ions.2,18
given by VD ≅ π (25 Å)2( 1500 Å)=3 × 10-18 cm3. The damage density is 600/VD = 2 × 1020 cm-3, which is only 0.4% 
of the atoms. Thus, very high doses of light ions are needed to create an amorphous layer.
For heavy ions, the energy loss is primarily due to nuclear collisions; therefore, we expect substantial damage. 
Consider a 100 keV arsenic ion with a projected range of 0.06 μm or 60 nm. The average nuclear energy loss over 
the entire energy range is about 1320 eV/nm (Fig. 16). This means that the arsenic ion loses about 330 eV for each 
lattice plane on the average. Most of the energy is given to one primary silicon atom. Each primary atom will 
subsequently displace 22 target atoms (i.e., 330 eV/15 eV). The total number of displaced atoms is 5280. Assuming 
a range of 2.5 nm for the displaced atoms, the damage volume is VD ≅ π (25 nm)2( 60 nm)=10-18 cm3. The damage 
density is then 5280/VD ≅ 5 × 1021 cm-3, or about 10% of the total number of atoms in VD. As a result of the heavy-
ion implantation, the material has become essentially amorphous. Figure 21b illustrates the situation where the 
damage forms a disordered cluster over the entire projected range.
To estimate the dose required to convert a crystalline material to an amorphous form, we can use the criterion 
that the energy density is of the same order of magnitude as that needed for melting the material (i.e.. 1021 keV/cm3). 
For 100 keV arsenic ions, the dose required to make amorphous silicon is then

For 100 keV boron ions, the dose required is 3 × 1014 ions/cm2 because Rp for boron is five times larger than for 
arsenic. However, in practice, higher doses (>1016 ions/cm2) are required for boron implantation into a target at 
room temperature because of the nonuniform distribution of the damage along the ion path. 
14.5.2 Annealing
Because of the damaged region and the disorder cluster that result from ion implantation, semiconductor 
parameters such as mobility and lifetime are severely degraded. In addition, most of the ions as implanted are not 
located in substitutional sites. To activate the implanted ions and restore mobility and other material parameters,
Impurity Doping 491

we must anneal the semiconductor at an appropriate combination of time and temperature. Annealing is a heat 
treatment that alters the microstructure of a material, causing changes in properties.
In conventional annealing, we use an open-tube batch-furnace system similar to that for thermal oxidation. 
The wafers are in an isothermal environment: the furnace walls are at the same temperature as the wafers. This 
process requires long time and high temperature to remove the implant damages. However, conventional annealing 
may cause substantial dopant diffusion and cannot meet the requirement for shallow junctions and narrow doping 
profiles. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is an annealing process that employs a variety of energy sources with a 
wide range of times, from 100 seconds down to nanoseconds—all short compared with conventional annealing. 
RTA can activate the dopant fully with minimal redistribution.
Conventional Annealing of B and P
Annealing characteristics depend on the dopant type and the dose involved. Figure 22 shows the annealing 
behaviors of boron and phosphorus implantation into silicon substrates.22 The substrate is held at room 
temperature (Ts) during implantation. For a given ion dose, the annealing temperature is defined as the 
temperature at which 90% of the implanted ions are activated by a 30-minute annealing in a conventional 
annealing furnace. For boron implantation, higher annealing temperatures are needed for higher doses. For 
phosphorus at lower doses, the annealing behavior is similar to that for boron. However, when the dose is greater 
than 1015 cm-2, the annealing temperature drops to about 600 oC. This phenomenon is related to the solid-phase 
epitaxy process. At phosphorus doses greater than 6 × 1014 cm-2 the silicon surface layer becomes amorphous. The 
single-crystal semiconductor underneath the amorphous layer serves as a seeding area for recrystallization of the 
amorphous layer. The epitaxial-growth rate along the <100> direction is 10 nm/min at 550 oC and 50 nm/min at 
600 oC, with an activation energy at 2.4 eV. Therefore, a 100-500 nm amorphous layer can be recrystallized in a few 
minutes. During the solid-phase epitaxial process, the impurity dopant atoms are incorporated into the lattice sites 
along with the host atoms; thus, full activation can be obtained at relatively low temperatures.
Fig. 22 Annealing temperature versus dose for 90% activation of boron and phosphorus.
492 Semiconductors

Fig. 23 Rapid thermal annealing system that is optically heated.
Rapid Thermal Annealing
A rapid thermal annealing system with transient lamp heating is shown in Fig. 23. Typical lamps in a RTA system 
are tungsten filaments or arc lamps. The processing chamber is made of quartz, silicon carbide, stainless steel, or 
aluminum, and has quartz windows through which the optical radiation passes to illuminate the wafer. The wafer 
holder is often made of quartz and contacts the wafer in a minimum number of places. A measurement system 
is placed in a control loop to set wafer temperature. The RTA system interfaces with a gas-handling system and 
a computer that controls system operation. Typically, wafer temperature in a RTA system is measured with a 
noncontact optical pyrometer that determines wafer’s temperature.    
In RTA, wafer is heated quickly under atmospheric conditions or at low pressure. However, the wafer is not 
in thermal equilibrium with its environment. The tungsten-halogen lamps (1500~2500 oC) are much hotter than 
the wafers (600~1100 oC)25,26 and the chamber walls (20~500 oC) are usually much cooler than the wafer. It is these 
temperature differences that permit rapid heating and cooling of the wafer. Because of the high temperatures 
of both the wafer and the lamps, the physics of RTA is dominated by radiation heat transfer, and the optical 
properties of the wafer and the chamber play an important part in the behavior. 
One key advantage of RTA for ion implanted layers is the ability to reduce transient-enhanced diffusion. 
Transient-enhanced diffusion is the very large increase in dopant diffusivity in ion-implanted silicon, which is 
from the large excess of point defects that result from the ion implantation process. The phenomenon is especially 
severe for boron doping, since boron is already a fast diffuser, and its diffusivity is increased by silicon interstitials. 
Transient-enhanced diffusion effects are more severe at lower temperatures, because the degree of the excess of 
silicon interstitials over the equilibrium value (super-saturation) is greater at lower temperatures than higher ones. 
As a result, annealing at higher temperatures reduces the effects of transient-enhanced diffusion, so long as the 
heating cycle can be kept sufficiently short.
A comparison between conventional furnace and RTA technologies is shown in Table 2. To achieve short 
processing times using RTA, trade-offs must be made in temperature and process uniformity, temperature 
measurement and control, and wafer stress and throughput. In addition, there are concerns over the introduction 
of electrically active wafer defects during the very fast (100 o-300oC /s) thermal transients. Rapid heating with 
temperature gradients in the wafers can cause wafer damage in the form of slip dislocations induced by thermal 
stress. On the other hand, conventional furnace processing brings with it significant problems, such as particle 
generation from the hot walls, limited ambient control in an open system, and a large thermal mass that restricts 
controlled heating times to tens of minutes. In fact, requirements on contamination, process control, and cost of 
manufacturing floor space have resulted in the paradigm shift to the RTA process.
Impurity Doping 493

Other Applications of Rapid Thermal Processing 
Rapid thermal processing (RTP), which includes RTA, is a key technology in the fabrication of advanced 
integrated circuits, with a wide range of applications. In addition, for ion implantation damage annealing and 
dopant activation, RTP is also used for metal silicide and nitride formation, dielectric formation and annealing, 
and reflow of deposited oxides.26 Typical RTP systems use radiant energy sources, often tungsten-halogen 
lamps, to heat a wafer to a high temperature for a period of less than a minute. Shrinking device dimensions 
and increasing wafer diameters are expected to make the use of RTP even more widespread as a result of its low 
thermal budget, fast cycle time, and compatibility with single-wafer processing. New applications, including gate 
dielectric formation and rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD), are also emerging.

Millisecond Annealing
As devices have scaled down to below 40 nm technology node, even 1 nm of diffusion is significant for ultra-
shallow junctions. The requirement of much less diffusion leads to the need for millisecond-duration heating cycles 
during annealing. Adequate implant damage annealing and dopant activation in millisecond heating push the 
annealing peak temperature somewhat below the melting point of silicon.
The peak-temperature time for conventional RTP systems is usually limited by the maximum cooling rate of 
the wafer and the time to switch off the heating energy source. These factors typically limit the peak-temperature 
time to 1 second. With the use of arc lamp energy sources, which can be switched off very fast, the spike width can 
be reduced to ~ 0.3 second, but this is not short enough to meet future requirements.
For millisecond annealing, the wafer is rapidly heated with a fast ramp to an intermediate temperature and 
then a very short, high-energy pulse from an array of powerful water-wall flash-lamps produces a temperature 
jump on the whole front surface of the wafer. This condition allows extremely fast cooling through conduction of 
heat away from the surface into the bulk of the wafer. The nature of the heating cycle is illustrated in Fig. 24. The 
ability to adjust the intermediate temperature and the magnitude of the temperature jump provide flexibility in 
tuning the amount of diffusion relative to the amount of activation.

14.6 IMPLANTATION-RELATED PROCESSES
In this section we consider a few implantation-related processes, such as multiple implantation, masking, high-
angle implantation, high-energy implantation, and high- current implantation.
14.6.1 Multiple Implantation and Masking 
In many applications, doping profiles other than the simple Gaussian distribution are required. One such case 
is the preimplantation of silicon with an inert ion to make the silicon surface region amorphous. This technique 
allows close control of the doping profile and permits nearly 100% dopant activation at low temperatures, as 
discussed previously. In such a case, a deep amorphous region may be required. To obtain this type of region, we 
must make a series of implants at varying ion energies and doses.
Multiple implantation can also be used to form a flat doping profile, as shown in Fig. 25. Here, four boron 
implants into silicon are used to provide a composite doping profile. The measured carrier concentration and that 
predicted using range theory are shown in the figure. Other doping profiles, unavailable from diffusion techniques, 
can he obtained by using various combinations of impurity dose and implantation energy. Multiple implants have 
been used to preserve stoichiometry during the implantation and annealing of GaAs. This approach, whereby 
equal amount of gallium and n-type dopant (or arsenic and p-type dopant) are implanted prior to annealing, has 
resulted in higher carrier activation.
To form p-n junctions in selected areas of the semiconductor substrate, an appropriate mask should be used 
for the implantation. Because implantation is a low-temperature process, a large variety of masking materials can 
be used. The minimum thickness of masking material required to stop a given percentage of incident ions can be 
estimated from the range parameters for ions. The inset in Fig. 26 shows the profile of an implant in a masking 
material. The dose implanted in the region beyond a depth d (shown shaded) is given by integration of Eq. 25 as

photoresist as masking materials.19,25 Mask thicknesses given in this figure are for boron, phosphorus, and arsenic 
implanted into silicon. These mask thicknesses also used as guidelines for impurity masking in gallium arsenide. 
The dopants are shown in parentheses. Since both Rp and σp vary approximately linearly with energy, the

minimum thickness of the masking material also increases linearly with energy. In certain applications, instead of 
totally stopping the beam, the masks can be used as attenuators, that can provide an amorphous surface layer to 
the incident ion beam to minimize the channeling effect.

14.6.2  Tilt-Angle Ion Implantation
In scaling devices to submicron dimensions, it is important also to scale dopant profiles vertically. We need to 
produce junction depths less than 15 nm for the 28 nm technology node, including diffusion during dopant 
activation and subsequent processing steps. Modern device structures, such as the lightly doped drain (LDD), 
require precise control of dopant distributions vertically and laterally.
It is the ion velocity perpendicular to the surface that determines the projected range of an implanted ion 
distribution. If the wafer is tilted at a large angle to the ion beam, then the effective ion energy is greatly reduced. 
Figure 27 illustrates this for 60 keV arsenic ions as a function of the tilt angle, showing that it is possible to achieve 
extremely shallow distributions using a high tilt angle (86o). In tilt-angle ion implantation, we should consider 
the shadow effect (inset in Fig. 27) for the patterned wafer. A lower tilt angle leads to a small shadow area. For 
example, if the height of the patterned mask is 0.5 μm, with vertical sidewalls, a 7o incident ion beam will induce a 
61 nm shadow. This shadow effect may introduce an unexpected series resistance in the device.
14.6.3  High-Energy and High-current Implantation
High-energy implantors, capable of energies as high as 1.5-5 MeV, are available and have been used for some novel 
applications. The majority of these depend on the ability to dope the semiconductor to many micrometers in 
depth, without the need for long diffusion times at high temperatures. High-energy implantors can also be used to 
produce low-resistivity buried layers. For example, a buried layer 1.5-3 μm below the surface for a CMOS device 
can be achieved by high-energy implantation.
High-current implantors (10-20 mA) operating in the 25-30 keV range are routinely used for the predeposition 
step in diffusion technology because the amount of total dopant can be controlled precisely. After the 
predeposition, the dopant impurities can be driven in by a high-temperature diffusion step at the same time that

angle ion implantation.

Fig. 28 Threshold voltage adjustment using boron ion implantation.28
implant damage at the surface region is annealed out. Another application is the threshold voltage adjustment in 
MOS devices. A precisely controlled amount of dopant (e.g., boron) is implanted through the gate oxide to the 
channel region29 (Fig. 28a). Because the projected range of boron in silicon and silicon oxide are comparable, if 
we choose a suitable incident energy, the ions will penetrate just the thin gate oxide, not the thicker-field oxide. The 
threshold voltage will vary approximately linearly with the implanted dose. After boron implantation, polysilicon 
can be deposited and patterned to form the gate electrode of the MOSFET. The thin oxide surrounding the gate 
electrode is removed, and the source and drain regions are formed as shown in Fig. 28b by another high-dose 
arsenic implantation.
High-current implantors with energies in the 150-200 keV range are now available. A major use for these 
machines is to form a buried silicon dioxide layer by implanting oxygen ions into a silicon substrate followed 
by a thermal annealing process. This separation by implantation of oxygen (SIMOX) is a key SOI (silicon-on-
insulator) technology. The SIMOX process as shown in Fig. 29 uses a high-energy O+ beam, typically in the 150 
to 200 keV range, so that the oxygen ions have projected ranges of 100-200 nm. A heavy dose, 1-2 × 1018 ions/cm2, 
is used to produce an insulating layer of SiO2 that is 100-500 nm thick. The use of SIMOX material leads to a 
significant reduction of source/drain capacitances in MOS devices. Moreover, it reduces coupling between devices 
and thus allows tighter packing without the problem of latchup. It is widely proposed as the material of choice for 
advanced, high-speed CMOS circuits.
Fig. 29 The SIMOX process for SOI wafer.
Impurity Doping 499

Currently, 10%-20% of SOI wafers are made by the SIMOX process and 80%-90% are made by Smart Cut 
technology, which utilizes wafer bonding and layer transfer from a donor or seed wafer to a support handle wafer. 
The Smart Cut technology is shown in Fig. 30. A seed wafer is oxidized to a desired thickness. The next step is a 
hydrogen implantation through the oxide and into Si with a dose that is typically greater than 5 × 1016 cm-2. After 
the implantation, the seed wafer and the handle wafer are carefully cleaned in order to eliminate any particles and 
surface contaminants, and to make both surfaces hydrophilic. Wafer pairs are aligned and contacted. The wafer 
bonding relies on chemical assistance through hydrogen bonds and water molecules. There are a few monolayers 
of water trapped between two native oxide films immediately after the wafers are fused together. When the bonded 
wafer pair is heated to high temperature, the water will diffuse through the thin oxide to the Si interfaces to form 
more oxide. Finally, a complete closure of the interface occurs by coupling of the interface hydroxyl species and 
liberates hydrogen into the Si bulk.
The bonded wafer pairs is loaded into a furnace and heated to a temperature of 4000-6000C, at which point 
the wafers split along the hydrogen implanted plane. The mechanism for splitting is that sufficient high-dosage 
hydrogen implantation will produce a sufficiently high density of platelets or microcavities. Microcavities grow to 
form microcracks and eventually lead to splitting of a thin layer away from the main substrate. The as-split wafer 
surface has a mean roughness of a few nanometers. A light touch-polish or other surface treatment brings the 
same surface roughness as in the standard bulk Si. The SOI technology can reduce not only the parasitic device 
capacitance but also the short channel effects, and thereby improve performance of scaled devices.

SUMMARY
Diffusion and ion implantation are the two key methods for impurity doping. We first considered the basic 
diffusion equation for constant diffusivity. We obtain the complementary error function (erfc) and the Gaussian 
function for the constant- surface-concentration case and constant-total-dopant case, respectively. The results of 
a diffusion process can be evaluated by measurements of the junction depth, the sheet resistance, and the dopant 
profile.
When the doping concentration is higher than the intrinsic carrier concentration ni at the diffusion 
temperature, the diffusivity becomes concentration dependent. This dependence has profound effects on the 
resulting doping profile. For example, arsenic and boron diffusivities in silicon vary linearly with the impurity 
concentration. Their doping profiles are much more abrupt than the erfc profile. Phosphorus diffusivity in 
silicon varies as the square of concentration. This dependence and a dissociation effect give rise to a phosphorus 
diffusivity that is 100 times larger than its intrinsic diffusivity.
Lateral diffusion at the edge of a mask and impurity redistribution during oxidation are two processes in 
which diffusion can have an important impact on device performance. The former can substantially reduce the 
breakdown voltage, and the latter will influence the threshold voltage as well as the contact resistance.
The key parameters for ion implantation are the projected range Rp and its standard deviation σp, also called 
the projected straggle. The implantation profile can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution with peak located 
at Rp from the surface of the semiconductor substrate. The advantages of ion implantation process are more 
precise control of the amount of dopant, a more reproducible doping profile, and lower processing temperature 
compared with the diffusion process.
We considered Rp and σp for various elements in silicon and gallium arsenide and discussed the channeling 
effect and ways to minimize this effect. However, implantation may cause severe damage to the crystal lattice. 
To remove the implant damage and to restore mobility and other device parameters, we must anneal the 
semiconductor at an appropriate combination of time and temperature. Currently, rapid thermal annealing 
(RTA) is preferred to conventional furnace annealing because RTA can remove implant damage without thermal 
broadening of the doping profile.
Ion implantation has wide applications for advanced semiconductor devices. These include (a) multiple 
implantation to form novel distributions, (b) selection of masking materials and thickness to stop a given 
percentage of incident ions from reaching the substrate. (c) tilt-angle implantation to form ultrashallow junctions, 
(d) high-energy implantation to form buried layers, and (e) high-current implantation for predeposition and 
threshold voltage adjustment and to form an insulating layer for SOI applications.

SUMMARY
Microwave, photonic, and power applications generally employ discrete devices. For example, an IMPATT 
diode is used as a microwave generator, an injection laser as an optical source, and a thyristor as a high-power 
switch. However, most electronic systems are built on the integrated circuit (IC), which is an ensemble of both 
active (e.g., transistor) and passive devices (e.g., resistor, capacitor, and inductor) formed on and within a single-
crystal semiconductor substrate and interconnected by a metallization pattern.1 ICs have enormous advantages 
over discrete devices connected by wire bonding. The advantages includes (a) reduction of the interconnection 
parasitics because an IC with multilevel metallization can substantially reduce the overall wiring length, (b) full 
utilization of semiconductor wafer’s “real estate,” because devices can be closely packed within an IC chip, and (c) 
drastic reduction in processing cost, because wire bonding is a time-consuming and error-prone operation. 
In this chapter we combine the basic processes described in previous chapters to fabricate active and 
passive components in an IC. Because the key element of an IC is the transistor, specific processing sequences 
are developed to optimize its performance. We consider three major IC technologies associated with the three 
transistor families: the bipolar transistor, the MOSFET, and the MESFET.
Specifically, we cover the following topics:
r
The design and fabrication of the IC resistor, capacitor, and inductor.
r
The processing sequence for the standard bipolar transistor and advanced bipolar devices. 
r
The processing sequence for MOSFET with special emphasis on CMOS and memory devices.
r
The processing sequence for high-performance MESFET and monolithic microwave ICs.
r
 The major challenges for future nanoelectronics, including the ultrashallow junction, ultrathin 
oxide, new interconnection materials, low power dissipation, and isolation.
Figure 1 illustrates the interrelationship among the major process steps used for IC fabrication. Polished wafers 
with a specific resistivity and orientation are used as the starting material. The film formation steps include 
thermally grown oxide films and deposited polysilicon, dielectric, and metal films (Chapter 12). Film formation 
is often followed by lithography (Chapter 13) or impurity doping (Chapter 14). Lithography is generally followed 
by etching, which in turn is often followed by another impurity doping or film formation. The final IC is made by 
sequentially transferring the patterns from each mask, level by level, onto the surface of the semiconductor wafer.

After processing, each wafer contains hundreds or thousands of identical rectangular chips (or dice), typically 
between 1 and 20 mm on each side, as shown in Fig. 2a. The chips are separated by sawing or laser cutting; Figure 
2b shows a separated chip. Schematic top views of a single MOSFET and a single bipolar transistor are shown in 
Fig. 2c to give some perspective on the relative size of a component in an IC chip. Prior to chip separation, each 
chip is electrically tested. Defective chips are usually marked with an inkless map file. Good chips are selected 
and packaged to provide an appropriate thermal, electrical, and interconnection environment for electronic 
applications.2
506 Semiconductors

IC chips may contain from a few components (transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, etc.) to as many as 
a billion or more. Since the invention of the monolithic IC in 1959, the number of components on a state-of-
the-art IC chip has grown exponentially. We usually refer to the complexity of an IC as small-scale integration 
(SSI) for up to 100 components per chip, medium-scale integration (MSI) for up to 1000 components per chip, 
large-scale integration (LSI) for up to 100,000 components per chip, very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) for up to 
107 components per chip, and ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) for larger numbers of components per chip. In 
Section 15.3, we show two ULSI chips, a 48-core microprocessor chip that contains over 1.3 billion transistors 
(45 nm process) and an 8 Gbit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip that contains over 16 billion 
components. 
 
15.1 PASSIVE COMPONENTS
15.1.1 The Integrated-Circuit Resistor 
To form an IC resistor, we can deposit a resistive layer on a silicon substrate, then pattern the layer by lithography 
and etching. We can also define a window in a silicon dioxide layer grown thermally on a silicon substrate and then 
implant (or diffuse) impurities of the opposite conductivity type into the wafer. Figure 3 shows top and cross-
sectional views of two resistors formed by the latter approach: one has a meander shape and the other has a bar 
shape. 
Consider the bar-shaped resistor first. The differential conductance dG of a thin layer of the p-type material 
that is of thickness dx parallel to the surface and at a depth xj (as shown by the B-B cross section) is

where 1/g usually is defined by the symbol R  is called the sheet resistance. The sheet resistance has units of ohms 
but is conventionally specified in units of ohms per square (Ω/ ).
Many resistors in an integrated circuit are fabricated simultaneously by defining different geometric patterns 
in the mask such as those shown in Fig. 3. Since the same processing cycle is used for all these resistors, it is 
convenient to separate the resistance into two parts: the sheet resistance R , determined by the implantation (or 
diffusion) process; and the ratio L/W, determined by the pattern dimensions. Once the value of R  is known, the

contacts have the same size.   
resistance is given by the ratio L/W, or the number of squares (each square has an area of W × W) in the resistor 
pattern. The end contact areas will introduce additional resistance to the IC resistors. For the type shown in Fig. 3, 
each end contact corresponds to approximately 0.65 square. For the meander-shape resistor, the electric-field lines 
at the bends are not spaced uniformly across the width of the resistor but are crowded toward the inside corner. A 
square at the bend does not contribute exactly 1 square but rather 0.65 square.
 EXAMPLE 1
Find the value of a resistor 90 μm long and 10 μm wide, such as the bar-shaped resistor in Fig. 3. The sheet 
resistance is 1 kΩ/ .
SOLUTION The resistor contains 9 squares. The two end contacts correspond to 1.3 . The value of the resistor  
is (9 + 1.3) × 1 kΩ/  = 10.3 kΩ. 
15.1.2 The Integrated-Circuit Capacitor
There are basically two types of capacitors used in integrated circuits: MOS capacitors and p–n junctions. The 
MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) capacitor can be fabricated by using a heavily doped region (such as an emitter 
region) as one plate, the top metal electrode as the other plate, and the intervening oxide layer as the dielectric. Top 
and cross-sectional views of a MOS capacitor are shown in Fig. 4a. To form a MOS capacitor, a thick oxide layer 
is thermally grown on a silicon substrate. Next, a window is lithographically defined and then etched in the oxide. 
Diffusion or ion implantation is used to form a p+-region in the window area, while the surrounding thick oxide 
serves as a mask. A thin oxide layer is then thermally grown in the window area, followed by a metallization step. 
The capacitance per unit area is given by where εox is the dielectric permittivity of silicon dioxide (the dielectric

constant εox/ε0 is 3.9) and d is the thin-oxide thickness. To increase the capacitance further, insulators with higher 
dielectric constants are being studied, such as Si3N4, and Ta2O5, with dielectric constants of 7 and 25, respectively. 
The MOS capacitance is essentially independent of the applied voltage, because the lower plate of the capacitor is 
made of heavily doped material. This also reduces the series resistance associated with it. 
A p–n junction is sometimes used as a capacitor in an integrated circuit. The top and cross sectional views 
of an n+-p junction capacitor are shown in Fig. 4b. The detailed fabrication process is considered in Section 15.2 
because this structure forms part of a bipolar transistor. As a capacitor, the device is usually reverse biased, that  
is, the p-region is reverse-biased with respect to the n+-region. The capacitance is not a constant but varies as  
(VR +Vbi)–1/2, where VR is the applied reverse voltage and Vbi is the built-in potential. The series resistance is 
considerably higher than that of a MOS capacitor because the p-region has higher resistivity than the p+-region.
 EXAMPLE 2 
What are the stored charge and the number of electrons on an MOS capacitor with an area of 4 μm2 for (a) a 
dielectric of 10 nm thick SiO2 and (b) a 5 nm thick Ta2O5? The applied voltage is 5 V for both cases.

15.1.3 The Integrated-Circuit Inductor 
IC inductors have been widely used in III-V-based monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC)3. With the 
increased speed of silicon devices and advances in multilevel interconnection technology, IC inductors have started 
to receive more and more attention in silicon-based radio-frequency (rf) and high-frequency applications.

circuit model for an integrated inductor.
Many kinds of inductors can be fabricated using IC processes. The most popular method is the thin-film spiral 
inductor. Figure 5a and b shows the top view and cross section of a silicon-based, two-level–metal spiral inductor. 
To form a spiral inductor, a thick oxide is thermally grown or deposited on a silicon substrate. The first metal is 
then deposited and defined as one end of the inductor. Next, another dielectric is deposited onto metal 1. A via 
hole is defined lithographically and etched in the oxide. Metal 2 is deposited and the via hole is filled. The spiral 
patterned can be defined and etched on metal 2 as the second end of the inductor. 
To evaluate the inductor, an important figure of merit is the quality factor, Q, defined as Q = Lω/R, where 
L, R, and ω are the inductance, resistance, and frequency, respectively. The higher the Q values, the lower the loss 
from resistance, hence the better the performance of the circuits. Figure 5c shows the equivalent circuit model. R1 
is the inherent resistivity of the metal, Cp1 and Cp2 are the coupling capacitances between the metal lines and the 
substrate, and Rsub1 and Rsub2 are the resistances of the silicon substrate associated with the metal lines, respectively. 
The Q increases linearly with frequency initially and then drops at higher frequencies because of parasitic 
resistances and capacitances. 
There are some approaches to improving the Q value. The first is to use low-dielectric-constant materials 
(<3.9) to reduce Cp. Another is to use a thick film metal or low-resistivity metals (e.g., Cu, Au to replace Al) to 
reduce the R1. A third approach uses an insulating substrate (e.g., silicon-on-sapphire, silicon-on-glass, or quartz) 
to reduce Rsub loss.
To obtain the exact value of a thin-film inductor, a complicated simulation tool, such as computer-aided 
design, must be employed for both circuit simulation and inductor optimization. The model for the thin-film 
inductor must take into account the resistance of the metal, the capacitance of the oxide, line-to-line capacitance, 
the resistance of the substrate, the capacitance of the substrate, and the inductance and mutual inductance of the 
metal lines.

Hence, it is more difficult to calculate the integrated inductance compared with the integrated capacitors or 
resistors. However, a simple equation to estimate the square planar spiral inductor is 3

15.2 BIPOLAR TECHNOLOGY
For IC applications, especially VLSI and ULSI, the size of bipolar transistors must be reduced to meet the high-
density requirement. Figure 6 illustrates the reduction in the size of the bipolar transistor in recent years.4 The 
main differences between a bipolar transistor in an IC and a discrete transistor are that all electrode contacts are 
located on the top surface of the IC wafer, and each transistor must be electrically isolated to prevent interactions 
between devices. Prior to 1970, both the lateral and vertical isolations were provided by p–n junctions (Fig. 6a) 
and the lateral p-isolation region was always reverse biased with respect to the n-type collector. In 1971, thermal 
oxide was used for lateral isolation, resulting in a substantial reduction in device size (Fig. 6b), because the base 
and collector contacts abut the isolation region. In the mid-1970s, the emitter extended to the walls of the oxide, 
resulting in an additional reduction in area (Fig. 6c). At the present time, all the lateral and vertical dimensions 
have been scaled down and emitter stripe widths have dimensions in the submicron region (Fig. 6d).

isolation. (c and d) Scaled oxide isolation.4

15.2.1 The Basic Fabrication Process 
The majority of bipolar transistors used in ICs are of the n-p-n type because the higher mobility of minority 
carriers (electrons) in the base region results in higher-speed performance than can be obtained with p-n-p types. 
Figure 7 shows a perspective view of an n-p-n bipolar transistor, in which lateral isolation is provided by oxide 
walls and vertical isolation is provided by the n+-p junction. The lateral oxide isolation approach reduces not only 
the device size but also the parasitic capacitance because of the smaller dielectric constant of silicon dioxide (3.9 
compared with 11.9 for silicon). We consider the major process steps that are used to fabricate the device shown in 
Fig. 7. 
For an n-p-n bipolar transistor, the starting material is a p-type lightly doped (~1015 cm-3), 〈111〉- or 
〈000〉-oriented polished silicon wafer.  Because the  junctions  are  formed inside the semiconductor, the choice of 
crystal orientation is not as critical as for MOS devices. The first step is to form a buried layer. The main purpose 
of this layer is to minimize the series resistance of the collector. A thick oxide (0.5–1 μm) is thermally grown on the 
wafer and a window is then opened in the oxide. A controlled amount of low-energy arsenic ions (~30 keV, ~1015 
cm–2) is implanted into the window region to serve as a predeposit (Fig. 8a). Next, a high-temperature (~1100°C) 
drive-in step forms the n+-buried layer, which has a typical sheet resistance of 20 Ω/ .
The second step is to deposit an n-type epitaxial layer. The oxide is removed and the wafer is placed in an 
epitaxial reactor for epitaxial growth. The thickness and the doping concentration of the epitaxial layer are 
determined by the ultimate use of the device. Analog circuits (with their higher voltages for amplification) require 
thicker layers (~10 μm) and lower dopings (~5 × 1015 cm–3), whereas digital circuits (with their lower voltages for 
switching) require thinner layers (~3 μm) and higher dopings (~2 × 1016 cm-3). Figure 8b shows a cross-sectional 
view of the device after the epitaxial process. Note that there is some outdiffusion from the buried layer into the 
epitaxial layer. To minimize the outdiffusion, a low-temperature epitaxial process should be employed and low-
diffusivity impurities should be used in the buried layer (e.g., As). 
The third step is to form the lateral oxide isolation region. A thin-oxide pad (~50 nm) is thermally grown 
on the epitaxial layer, followed by a silicon-nitride deposition (~100 nm). If nitride is deposited directly onto the 
silicon without the thin-oxide pad, the nitride may cause damage to the silicon surface during the subsequent high-
temperature steps. Next, the nitride-oxide layers and about half of the epitaxial layer are etched using a photoresist 
as mask (Fig. 8c and 8d). Boron ions are then implanted into the exposed silicon areas (Fig. 8d).
The photoresist is removed and the wafer is placed in an oxidation furnace. Since the nitride layer has a very 
low oxidation rate, thick oxides will be grown only in the areas not protected by the nitride layer. The isolation 
oxide is usually grown to a thickness such that the top of the oxide becomes coplanar with the original silicon 
surface to minimize the surface topography. This oxide isolation process is called local oxidation of silicon 
(LOCOS). Figure 9a shows the cross section of the isolation oxide after the removal of the nitride layer.

oxide. (d) Emitter and collector implant. 
Because of segregation effects, most of the implanted boron ions are pushed underneath the isolation oxide 
to form a p+-layer. This is called a p+ channel stop (or chanstop), because the high concentration of p-type 
semiconductor will prevent surface inversion and eliminate possible high-conductivity paths (or channels) among 
neighboring buried layers.
The fourth step is to form the base region. A photoresist is used as a mask to protect the right half of 
the device; then, boron ions (~1012 cm-2) are implanted to form the base regions, as shown in Fig. 9b. Another 
lithographic process removes all the thin-pad oxide except a small area near the center of the base region (Fig. 9c).
The fifth step is to form the emitter region. As shown in Fig. 9d, the base contact area is protected by a 
photoresist mask; then a low-energy, high-arsenic–dose (~1016 cm–2) implantation forms the n+-emitter and the n+-
collector contact regions. The photoresist is removed, and a final metallization step forms the contacts to the base, 
emitter, and collector as shown in Fig. 7.
Integrated Devices 513

Fig. 10 n-p-n transistor doping profiles. 
In this basic bipolar process, there are six film formation operations, six lithographic operations, four ion 
implantations, and four etching operations. Each operation must be precisely controlled and monitored. Failure of 
any one of the operations generally will render the wafer useless. 
The doping profiles of the completed transistor along a coordinate perpendicular to the surface and 
passing through the emitter, base, and collector are shown in Fig. 10. The emitter profile is abrupt because of the 
concentration-dependent diffusivity of arsenic. The base doping profile beneath the emitter can be approximated 
by a Gaussian distribution for a limited-source diffusion. The collector doping is given by the epitaxial doping 
level (~2 × 1016 cm-3) for a representative switching transistor; however, at larger depths, the collector doping 
concentration increases because of outdiffusion from the buried layer. 
15.2.2 Dielectric Isolation 
In the isolation scheme described previously for the bipolar transistor, the device is isolated both from other 
devices by the oxide layer around its periphery and from its common substrate by a n+–p junction (buried layer). 
In high-voltage applications, a different approach, called dielectric isolation, is used to form insulating tubs to 
isolate a number of pockets of single-crystal semiconductors. In this approach the device is isolated from both its 
common substrate and its surrounding neighbors by a dielectric layer. 
In the process for the dielectric isolation, an oxide layer is formed inside a <100>-oriented n-type silicon 
substrate by SIMOX process or Smart Cut technology, as discussed in Chapter 14, Section 14.6.3. Since the top 
silicon is so thin, the isolation region is easily formed by the LOCOS process illustrated in Fig. 8c or by etching a 
trench and refilling it with oxide. The other processes are almost the same as those in Figs. 8c through 9 to form 
the p-type base, n+-emitter, and collector. 
The main advantage of this technique is its high breakdown voltage between the emitter and the collector, 
which can be in excess of several hundred volts. This technique is also compatible with modern CMOS integration. 
This CMOS-compatible process is very useful in mixed high-voltage and high-density IC.
15.2.3 Self-Aligned Double-Polysilicon Bipolar Structure 
The process shown in Fig. 9c needs another lithographic process to define an oxide region to separate the base and 
emitter contact regions. This gives rise to a large inactive device area within the isolated boundary that increases 
not only the parasitic capacitances but also the resistance that degrades transistor performance. The most effective 
way to reduce these effects is by using the self-aligned structure. 
514 Semiconductors

Fig. 11 Cross-section of a self-aligned, double-polysilicon bipolar transistor with advanced trench isolation.5
The most widely used self-aligned structure is the double-polysilicon structure with the advanced isolation 
provided by a trench refilled with polysilicon,5  as shown in Fig. 11. Figure 12 shows the detailed sequence of steps 
for the self-aligned double-polysilicon (n-p-n) bipolar structure.6 The transistor is built on an n-type epitaxial layer. 
A trench 5.0 μm deep is etched by reactive ion etching through the n+-subcollector region into the p– substrate 
region. A thin layer of thermal oxide is then grown and serves as the screen oxide for the channel stop implant of 
boron at the bottom of the trench. The trench is then filled with undoped polysilicon and capped by a thick planar 
field oxide. 
The first polysilicon layer is deposited and heavily doped with boron. The p+-polysilicon (called poly 1) will 
be used as a solid-phase diffusion source to form the extrinsic base region and the base electrode. This layer is 
covered with a chemical-vapor deposition (CVD) oxide and nitride (Fig. 12a). The emitter mask is used to pattern 
the emitter-area regions, and a dry-etch process is used to produce an opening in the CVD oxide and poly 1 (Fig. 
12b). A thermal oxide is then grown over the etched structure, and a relatively thick oxide (approximately 0.1–0.4 
μm) is grown on the vertical sidewalls of the heavily doped poly. The thickness of this oxide determines the spacing 
between the edges of the base and emitter contacts. The extrinsic p+ base regions are also formed during the 
thermal-oxide growth step as a result of the outdiffusion of boron from the poly 1 into the substrate (Fig. 12c). 
Because boron diffuses laterally as well as vertically, the extrinsic base region will be able to make contact with the 
intrinsic base region that is formed next, under the emitter contact.
Following the oxide-grown step, the intrinsic base region is formed using ion implantation of boron (Fig. 
12d). This serves to self-align the intrinsic and extrinsic base regions. After the contact is cleaned to remove any 
oxide layer, the second polysilicon layer is deposited and implanted with As or P. The n+–polysilicon (poly 2) is 
used as a solid-phase diffusion source to form the emitter region and the emitter electrode. A shallow emitter 
region is then formed through dopant outdiffusion from poly 2. A rapid thermal anneal  for  the base and emitter 
outdiffusion steps facilitates the formation of shallow emitter-base and collector-base junctions. Finally, Pt film is 
deposited and sintered to form PtSi over the n+-polysilicon emitter and the p+-polysilicon base contact (Fig. 12e).
This self-aligned structure allows the fabrication of emitter regions smaller than the minimum lithographic 
dimension. When the sidewall-spacer oxide is grown, it fills the contact hole to some extent because the thermal 
oxide occupies a larger volume than the original volume of polysilicon. Thus, an opening 0.8 μm wide will shrink 
to about 0.4 μm if sidewall oxide a 0.2 μm thick is grown on each side.

15.3 MOSFET TECHNOLOGY 
At present, MOSFET is the dominant device used in ULSI circuits because it can be scaled to smaller dimensions 
than other types of devices. The dominant technology for MOSFET is CMOS (complementary MOSFET) 
technology, in which both n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs (NMOS and PMOS, respectively) are provided 
on the same chip. CMOS technology is particularly attractive for ULSI circuits because it has the lowest power 
consumption of all IC technology. 
Figure 13 shows the reduction in size of the MOSFET in recent years. In the early 1970s, the gate length was 
7.5 μm and the corresponding device area was about 6000 μm2. As the device is scaled down, there is a drastic 
reduction in the device area. For a MOSFET with a gate length of 0.5 μm, the device area shrinks to less than 1% 
of the early MOSFET. We expect that device miniaturization will continue and gate length may approach the 10 ~ 
20 nm range by the year 2020. We consider future trends in the devices in Section 15.5.

15.3.1 The Basic Fabrication Process 
Figure 14 shows a perspective view of an n-channel MOSFET prior to its final metallization.7 The top layer is a 
phosphorus-doped silicon dioxide (P-glass) that is used as an insulator between the polysilicon gate and the gate 
metallization and also as a gettering layer for mobile ions. Compare Fig. 14 with Fig. 7 for the bipolar transistor 
and note that a MOSFET is considerably simpler in its basic structure. Although both devices use lateral oxide 
isolation, there is no need for vertical isolation in the MOSFET, whereas a buried-layer n+-p junction is required 
in the bipolar transistor. The doping profile in a MOSFET is not as complicated as that in a bipolar transistor 
and the control of the dopant distribution is also less critical. We consider the major process steps that are used to 
fabricate the device shown in Fig. 14.
Fig. 14 Perspective view of an n-channel MOSFET.7 
Integrated Devices 517

To process an n-channel MOSFET (NMOS), the starting material is a p-type, lightly doped (~1015 cm-3), 
〈100〉-oriented polished silicon wafer. The 〈100〉-orientation is preferred over 〈111〉 because it has an interface-trap 
density that is about one-tenth that of 〈111〉. The first step is to form the oxide isolation region using LOCOS 
technology. The process sequence for this step is similar to that for the bipolar transistor. A thin-pad oxide (~35 
nm) is thermally grown, followed by a silicon nitride (~150 nm) deposition (Fig. 15a).7 
The active device area is defined by a photoresist mask and a boron chanstop layer is then implanted through 
the composite nitride-oxide layer (Fig. 15b). The nitride layer not covered by the photoresist mask is subsequently 
removed by etching. After stripping the photoresist, the wafer is placed in an oxidation furnace to grow an oxide 
(called the field oxide), where the nitride layer is removed, and to drive in the boron implant. The thickness of the 
field oxide is typically 0.5–1 μm. 
The second step is to grow the gate oxide and to adjust the threshold voltage (see Chapter 5, Section 5.5.3). 
The composite nitride-oxide layer over the active device area is removed, and a thin-gate oxide layer (less than 10 
nm) is grown. For an enhancement-mode n-channel device, boron ions are implanted in the channel region, as 
shown in Fig. 15c, to increase the threshold voltage to a predetermined value (e.g., + 0.5V). For a depletion-mode 
n-channel device, arsenic ions are implanted in the channel region to decrease the threshold voltage (e.g., – 0.5V).
The third step is to form the gate. A polysilicon is deposited and is heavily doped by diffusion or implantation 
of phosphorus to a typical sheet resistance of 20–30 Ω/ . This resistance is adequate for MOSFETs with gate 
lengths larger than 3 μm. For smaller devices, polycide, a composite layer of metal silicide and polysilicon, such as 
W-polycide, can be used as the gate material to reduce the sheet resistance to about 1 Ω/ .  
The fourth step is to form the source and drain. After the gate is patterned (Fig. 15d), it serves as a mask for 
the arsenic implantation (~30 keV, ~5 × 1015cm-2) to form the source and drain (Fig. 16a), which are self-aligned 
with respect to the gate.7 At this stage, the only overlapping of the gate is due to lateral straggling of the implanted 
ions (for 30 keV As, σ⊥ is only 5 nm). If low-temperature processes are used for subsequent steps to minimize 
lateral diffusion, the parasitic gate-drain and gate-source coupling capacitances can be much smaller than the gate-
channel capacitance.

(d) Top view of the MOSFET. 
The last step is the metallization. A phosphorus-doped oxide (P-glass) is deposited over the entire wafer and 
is flowed by heating the wafer to give a smooth surface topography (Fig. 16b). Contact windows are defined and 
etched in the P-glass. A metal layer, such as aluminum, is then deposited and patterned. A cross-section view of the 
completed MOSFET is shown in Fig. 16c, and the corresponding top view is shown in Fig. 16d. The gate contact 
is usually made outside the active device area to avoid possible damage to the thin-gate oxide. 
 EXAMPLE 4
What is the maximum gate-to-source voltage that a MOSFET with a 5 nm gate oxide can withstand? Assume that 
the oxide breaks down at 8 MV/cm and the substrate voltage is zero. 
SOLUTION 
 
V= E × d = 8 ×106 ×5 ×10-7 = 4 V. 
15.3.2 CMOS Technology 
Figure 17a shows a CMOS inverter. The gate of the upper PMOS device is connected to the gate of the lower 
NMOS device. Both devices are enhancement-mode MOSFETs with threshold voltage VTp less than zero for the 
PMOS device and VTn greater than zero for the NMOS device (typically the threshold voltage is about 1/4 VDD). 
When the input voltage Vi is zero, the potential VGS of PMOS is –VDD (which is more negative than VTp), and 
the NMOS device is off. Hence, the output voltage Vo is very close to VDD (logic 1). When the input is at VDD, the 
PMOS (with VGS = 0) is turned off, and the NMOS is turned on (Vi = VDD > VTn). Therefore, the output voltage 
Vo equals zero (logic 0). The CMOS inverter has a unique feature: in either logic state, one device in the series 
path from VDD to ground is nonconductive. The current that flows in either steady state is a small leakage current, 
and only when both devices are on during switching does a significant current flow through the CMOS inverter. 
Thus, the average power dissipation is small, on the order of nanowatts. The low power consumption is the most 
attractive feature of the CMOS circuit. As the number of components per chip increases, power dissipation 
becomes a major limiting factor.
Integrated Devices 519

Fig. 17 Complementary MOS (CMOS) inverter. (a) Circuit diagram. (b) Circuit layout. (c) Cross section along dotted 
A-A¢ line of (b). 
Figure 17b shows a layout of the CMOS inverter and Fig. 17c shows the device cross section along the A-A′ 
line. In processing, a p-tub (also called a p-well) is first implanted and subsequently driven into the 
n-substrate. The p-type dopant concentration must be high enough to overcompensate the background doping of 
the n-substrate. The subsequent processes for the n-channel MOSFET in the p-tub are identical to those 
described previously. For the p-channel MOSFET, 11B+ or 49(BF2)+ ions are implanted into the n-substrate to 
form the source and drain regions. A channel implant of 75As+ ions may be used to adjust the threshold voltage 
and a n+-chanstop is formed underneath the field oxide around the p-channel device. Because of the p-tub and 
the additional steps needed to make the p-channel MOSFET, the number of steps to make a CMOS circuit is 
essentially double that to make an NMOS circuit. Thus, we have a trade-off between complexity of processing and 
reduction in power consumption. 
Instead of the p-tub described above, an alternate approach is to use an n-tub formed in p-type substrate, 
as shown in Fig. 18a. In this case, the n-type dopant concentration must be high enough to overcompensate for 
the background doping of the p-substrate (i.e., ND > NA). In both the p-tub and the n-tub approach, the channel 
mobility will be degraded because mobility is determined by the total dopant concentration (NA + ND). A recent 
approach using two separated tubs implanted into a lightly doped substrate is shown in Fig. 18b. This structure 
is called a twin tub.1 Because no overcompensation is needed in either twin tub, higher channel mobility can be 
attained. 
All CMOS circuits have the potential for a troublesome problem called latchup that is associated with 
parasitic bipolar transistors (for how this problem can occur, see Chapter 6). An effective processing technique to 
eliminate latchup problem is to use the deep-trench isolation, as shown8 in Fig. 18c. In this technique, a trench
520 Semiconductors

Fig. 18 Various CMOS structures. (a) n-tub. (b) Twin tub1. (c) Refilled trench.8
with a depth deeper than the well is formed in the silicon by anisotropic reactive sputter etching. An oxide layer is 
thermally grown on the bottom and walls of the trench, which is then refilled by deposited polysilicon or silicon 
dioxide. This technique can eliminate latchup because the n-channel and p-channel devices are physically isolated 
by the refilled trench. The detailed steps for some related CMOS processes are now considered.
Well-Formation Technology 
The well of a CMOS can be a single well, a twin well, or a retrograde well. The twin-well process has some 
disadvantages; e.g., it needs high-temperature processing (above 1050°C) and a long diffusion time (more than 8 
hours) to achieve the required depth of 2–3 μm. In this process, the doping concentration is highest at the surface 
and decreases monotonically with depth. To reduce the process temperature and time, high-energy implantation 
is used, i.e., implanting the ion to the desired depth instead of diffusing from the surface. Since the depth is 
determined by the implantation energy, we can design the well depth with different implantation energy. The 
profile of the well in this case can have a peak at a certain depth in the silicon substrate. This is called a retrograde 
well. Figure 19 compares the impurity profiles in the retrograde well and the conventional thermal diffused well.9 
The energy for the n- and p-type retrograde wells is around 700 keV and 400 keV, respectively. As mentioned above, 
the advantage of the high-energy implantation is that it can form the well under low-temperature and short-time 
conditions, and hence, can reduce lateral diffusion and increase device density. The retrograde well can offer some 
additional advantages over the conventional well: (a) because of high doping near the bottom, the well resistivity 
is lower than that of the conventional well and the latchup problem can be minimized, (b) the chanstop can be 
formed at the same time as the retrograde well implantation, reducing processing steps and time, and (c) higher 
well doping in the bottom can reduce the chance of punch through from the drain to the source.

Gate-Engineering Technology 
If we use n+-polysilicon for both PMOS and NMOS gates, the threshold voltage for PMOS (VTP  ≅ –0.5 to –1.0 V) 
has to be adjusted by boron implantation. This makes the channel of the PMOS a buried type, as shown in Fig. 
20a. The buried-type PMOS suffers serious short-channel effects as the device size shrinks to 0.25 μm and less. The 
most noticeable phenomena for short-channel effects are the VT  roll-off, drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL), 
and the large leakage current at the off state so that even with the gate voltage at zero, leakage current flows 
through source and drain. To alleviate this problem, one can change n+-polysilicon to p+-polysilicon for PMOS. 
Due  to  the  work  function  difference (there is a 1.0 eV difference from n+- to p+-polysilicon), one can obtain a 
surface p-type channel device without the boron VT adjustment implantation. Hence, as the technology shrinks 
to 0.25 μm and less, dual-gate structures are required, i.e., p+-polysilicon gate for PMOS, and n+-polysilicon for 
NMOS (Fig. 20b). A comparison of VT for the surface channel and buried channel is shown in Fig. 21. We note 
that the VT of the surface channel rolls off slowly in the deep-submicron regime compared with the buried-channel 
device. This makes the surface-channel device with the p+-polysilicon suitable for deep-submicron device operation. 
To form the p+-polysilicon gate, ion implantation of BF2
+ 
is commonly used. However, boron penetrates easily 
from the poly-Si through the oxide into the silicon substrate at high temperatures, resulting in a VT shift. This 
penetration is enhanced in the presence of a F-atom. There are methods to reduce this effect: use of rapid thermal 
annealing to reduce the time at high temperatures and, consequently, the diffusion of boron; use of nitrided oxide 
to suppress the boron penetration, since boron can easily combine with nitrogen and becomes less mobile; and 
making a multilayer of polysilicon to trap the boron atoms at the interface of the two layers.

15.3.3 BiCMOS Technology 
The BiCMOS technology combines both CMOS and bipolar device structures in a single IC. The reason to 
combine these two different technologies is to create an IC chip with the advantages of both CMOS and bipolar 
devices. We know that CMOS exhibits advantages in power dissipation, noise margin, and packing density, 
whereas bipolar has advantages in switching speed, current drive capability, and analog capability. As a result, for 
a given design rule, BiCMOS can have a greater speed than CMOS, better performance in analog circuits than 
CMOS, a lower power-dissipation than bipolar, and higher component density than bipolar. 
BiCMOS has been widely used in many applications. In the early days, it was used in SRAM. At the present 
time, BiCMOS technology has been successfully developed for transceiver, amplifier, and oscillator applications 
in wireless-communication equipment. Most of the BiCMOS processes are based on the CMOS process, with 
some modifications, such as adding masks for bipolar transistor fabrication. The following example is for a high-
performance BiCMOS process based on the twin-well CMOS process, shown11 in Fig. 23.
Fig. 23 Optimized BiCMOS device structure. Key features include self-aligned p and n+ buried layers for improved 
packing density, separately optimized n- and p-well (twin-well CMOS) formed in an epitaxial layer with intrinsic 
background doping, and a polysilicon emitter for improved bipolar performance.11

Semiconductors

The initial material is a p-type silicon substrate with an n+-buried layer formed to reduce the collector’s 
resistance. The buried p-layer is  formed  through  ion  implantation to increase the doping level to prevent 
punchthrough. A lightly doped n-epi layer is grown on the wafer and a twin-well process for the CMOS is 
performed. To achieve high performance of the bipolar transistor, four additional masks are needed. They are 
the buried n+-mask, the collector deep-n+-mask, the base p-mask, and the poly-emitter mask. In other processing 
steps, the p+-region for the base contact can be formed with the p+-implant in the source/drain implantation of the 
PMOS and the n+-emitter can be formed with the source/drain implantation of the NMOS. The additional masks 
and longer processing time than a standard CMOS are the main drawbacks of BiCMOS. The additional cost 
should be justified, however, by the enhanced performances of BiCMOS.
15.3.4 FinFET Technology
To overcome short channel effects, three-dimensional MOSFETs were developed as discussed in Chapter 6, 
Section 6.3.3. Among them, FinFET is a typical structure. The device structure of the FinFET is shown in Fig. 
24.12 The channel was formed on the side “vertical” surface of the Si-fin, and the current flows in parallel to the 
wafer surface. The heart of the FinFET  is a thin (~10 nm) Si fin that serves as the body of the MOSFET. A 
heavily doped poly-Si film wraps around the fin and makes electrical contact with its vertical faces. The poly-
Si film greatly reduces the source/drain series resistance and provide a convenient means for local interconnect 
and making connections to the metal. A gap is etched through the poly-Si film to separate the source and drain. 
The width of this gap, further reduced by the dielectric spacers, determines the gate length. The channel width is 
basically twice the fin height (plus the fin width). The conducting channel is wrapped around the surface of the 
fin (hence the name FinFET). Because the source/drain and gate are much thicker (taller) than the fin, the device 
structure is quasiplanar.
The typical fabrication sequence is shown in Fig. 25.
 1. A conventional SOI wafer with a 400-nm thick buried oxide layer and 50-nm thick silicon film can be used 
as the starting material, except that the alignment notch of the wafer is preferably rotated 45° about the 
axis of symmetry of the wafer. The reason for this deviation is to provide {100} planes on silicon fins.
 2. The CVD Si3N4 and SiO2 stack layer is deposited on the silicon film to make a cover layer that will protect 
the Si-fin through the fabrication process. The fine Si-fin is patterned by electron beam lithography. 
 3. Phosphorus-doped amorphous Si (for source and drain pads) is deposited at 480oC, and will be 
polycrystallized in the following step. After amorphous Si deposition, SiO2 is deposited at 450oC. The 
process temperatures are low enough to suppress impurity diffusion into the Si fin.

Integrated Devices 525

Fig. 25 Process flow of FinFET: (a) after depositing the Si3N4 and SiO2 stacked layer, the Si fin is formed; (b) a 
phosphorus-doped-poly Si and SiO2 stacked layer is deposited; (c) the source and drain are etched while the Si fin is 
covered by the mask layer; (d) a SiO2 space layer is etched into the buried oxide layer; and (e) after depositing B-doped 
SiGe, the gate pattern is delineated.12 
 4. Using electron-beam lithography, the S/D pads with a narrow gap in between them are delineated. The 
SiO2 and amorphous Si layers are etched and the gap is formed. While the cover layer protects the Si fin, 
the amorphous Si is completely removed from the side of the Si fin. The amorphous Si in contact with the 
Si fin at its side surfaces becomes the impurity diffusion source that forms the transistor S/D later. 
 5. CVD SiO2 is deposited to make spacers around the S/D pads. The height of the Si fin is 50 nm, and the 
total pads thickness is 400 nm. Making use of the difference in the heights, the SiO2 spacer on the sides of 
the Si-fin is completely removed by over etching of SiO2 while the cover layer protects the Si-fin. The Si 
surface is again exposed on the sides of the Si fin. During this over-etching, SiO2 on the S/D pads and the 
buried oxide between S/D pads are etched.  
 6. By oxidizing the Si surface, gate oxide as thin as 2.5 nm is grown. During gate oxidation, the amorphous Si 
of the S/D pads is crystallized. Also, phosphorus diffuses from the S/D pads into the Si fin and forms the 
S/D extensions under the oxide spacers. Then, the gate deposition follows.
15.3.5 Memory Devices 
Memories are devices that can store digital information (or data) in terms of bits (binary digits). Various memory 
chips have been designed and fabricated using CMOS technology. MOS memory structures were introduced in 
Chapter 6, Section 6.4. In a RAM, memory cells are organized in a matrix structure and data can be accessed 
(i.e., stored, retrieved, or erased) in random order, independent of their physical locations. A static random access 
memory (SRAM) can retain stored data indefinitely as long as the power supply is on. The SRAM is basically a 
flip-flop circuit that can store one bit of information. A SRAM cell has four NMOSFETs and two PMOSFETs in 
CMOS technology.13
To reduce the cell area and power consumption, the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has been 
developed. Figure 26a shows the circuit diagram of the one-transistor DRAM cell in which the transistor serves 
as a switch and one bit of information can be stored in the storage capacitor. The voltage level on the capacitor 
determines the state of the cell. For example, +1.5 V may be defined as logic 1 and 0 V defined as logic 0. The 
stored charge will typically be removed in a few milliseconds mainly because of the leakage current of the 
capacitors; thus dynamic memories require periodic “refreshing” of the stored charge. 
Figure 26b shows the layout of a DRAM cell and Fig. 26c shows the corresponding cross section through 
AA′. The storage capacitor uses the channel region as one plate, the polysilicon gate as the other plate, and
526 Semiconductors

the gate oxide as the dielectric. The row line is a metal track to minimize the delay due to parasitic resistance 
(R) and parasitic capacitance (C), the RC delay. The column line is formed by n+-diffusion. The internal drain 
region of the MOSFET serves as a conductive link between the inversion layers under the storage gate and the 
transfer gate. The drain region can be eliminated by using the double-level polysilicon approach shown in Fig. 
26d. The second polysilicon electrode is separated from the first polysilicon capacitor plate by an oxide layer that 
is thermally grown on the first-level polysilicon before the second electrode has been defined. The charge from the 
column line can therefore be transmitted directly to the area under the storage gate by the continuity of inversion 
layers under the transfer and storage gates. 
To meet the requirements of high-density DRAM, the DRAM structure has been extended to the third 
dimension with stacked or trench capacitors. Figure 27a shows a simple trench cell structure.14 The advantage of 
the trench type is that the capacitance of the cell can be increased by increasing the depth of the trench without 
increasing the surface area of silicon occupied by the cell. The main difficulties of making trench-type cells are the 
etching of the deep trench, which needs a rounded bottom corner and growth of a uniform, thin dielectric film on 
the trench walls. Figure 27b shows a stacked cell structure. The storage capacitance increases as a result of stacking 
the storage capacitor on top of the access transistor. The dielectric is formed using the thermal oxidation or CVD 
nitride methods between the two-polysilicon plates. Hence, the stacked cell process is easier than the trench type 
process.

Figure 28 shows an 8 Gb DRAM chip.15 This memory chip uses 50 nm fabrication process for the high-speed, 
low-power DRAM. The memory chip has an area of 98 mm2 and operates at 1.5 V. Low-resistance copper wiring 
and low-dielectric-constant film (k = 2.96) are used for the wiring.
Both SRAM and DRAM are volatile memories: that is, they lose their stored data when power is switched 
off. Nonvolatile memories discussed in detail in Section 6.4.3 of Chapter 6, on the other hand, can retain their 
data. A floating-gate nonvolatile memory is basically a conventional MOSFET that has a modified gate electrode. 
The composite gate has a regular (control) gate and a floating gate that is surrounded by insulators. When a large 
positive voltage is applied to the control gate, charge will be injected from the channel region through the gate 
oxide into the floating gate. When the applied voltage is removed, the injected charge can be stored in the floating 
gate for a long time. To remove this charge, a large negative voltage must be applied to the control gate, so that the 
charge will be injected back into the channel region.

Another version of nonvolatile memory is the metal-nitride-oxide-semiconductor (MNOS) type also 
discussed in Section 6.4.3 of Chapter 6. When a positive gate voltage is applied, electrons can tunnel through the 
thin oxide layer (~2 nm) and be captured by the traps at the oxide-nitride interface, thus becoming stored charges 
there. The charge stored in the capacitor C causes a shift in the threshold voltage, and the device remains at the 
higher threshold-voltage state (logic 1). In a well designed memory device, the charge retention time can be over 
100 years. To erase the memory (the stored charge) and return the device to a lower threshold-voltage state (logic 
0), a gate voltage or other means (such as ultraviolet light) can be used.
The nonvolatile semiconductor memory (NVSM) has been extensively used in portable electronic systems, 
such as cellular phones and the digital cameras. Another interesting application is the chip card, also called an 
IC card. Figure 29 shows a 5.6 MB/s, 64 Gb, 4b/cell NAND flash memory.16 In contrast to the limited volume (1 
kbytes) inside a conventional magnetic tape card, the size of the nonvolatile memory can be increased depending 
on the application (e.g., you can store personal photos or fingerprints). Through IC card read/write machines, the 
data can be used in numerous applications, such as telecommunications (card telephone, mobile radio), payment 
transactions (electronic purse, credit card), pay television, transport (electronic ticket, public transport), health care 
(patient-data card), and access control. The IC card will play a central role in the global information and service 
society of the future.17
 
15.4 MESFET TECHNOLOGY 
Recent advances in gallium arsenide processing techniques in conjunction with new fabrication and circuit 
approaches have made possible the development of “silicon-like” gallium arsenide IC technology. There are 
three inherent advantages of gallium arsenide compared with silicon: higher electron mobility, which results in 
lower series resistance for a given device geometry; higher drift velocity at a given electric field, which improves 
device speed; and the ability to be made semi-insulating, which can provide a lattice-matched dielectric-insulated 
substrate. However, gallium arsenide also has three disadvantages: a very short minority-carrier  lifetime;  lack  of  
a stable,  passivating native oxide; and crystal defects that are many orders of magnitude greater than in silicon. 
Integrated Devices 529

The short minority-carrier lifetime and the lack of high-quality insulating  films  have  prevented the development 
of bipolar devices and delayed MOS technology using gallium arsenide. Thus, the emphasis of gallium arsenide 
IC technology is in the MESFET area, in which our main concerns are majority-carrier transport and the metal-
semiconductor contact.
High-performance MESFET structures fall into two major categories: the recessed-channel (or recessed-
gate) structure and the ion-implanted planar structure. A typical fabrication sequence18,19 for a recessed-channel 
MESFET is shown in Fig. 30. The active layers are grown epitaxially over the semi-insulating substrate (Fig. 
30a). An intrinsic buffer layer is first grown and followed by an active n-channel layer. The buffer layer serves to 
eliminate defects from the semi-insulating substrate. Finally, an epitaxial n+-contact is grown over the active
Fig. 30 Fabrication sequence of a GaAs MESFET.18

and drain regions are self-aligned to the gate.20
Integrated Devices 531

n-channel to reduce the source and drain contact resistance. A mesa-etch step is performed for isolation (Fig. 
30b), and a metal layer is evaporated for the source and drain ohmic contacts (Fig. 30c). A channel-recess etch is 
followed by a gate-recess etch and gate evaporation (Fig. 30d and e). Sometimes this etching process is monitored 
by measuring the current between source and drain for more precise control of the final channel current. One of 
the advantages of this recessed-channel structure is that the surface is further away from the n-channel layer so that 
surface effects such as transient response and other reliability problems are minimized. One disadvantage of this 
scheme is the additional steps required for isolation, which could be  a  mesa-etching  process  (as  shown)  or an  
isolation  implantation  that  converts  the semiconductor into high-resistivity material. After a liftoff process that 
removes the photoresist, as shown in Fig. 30e, the MESFET is completed (Fig. 30f).
Note that the gate is offset toward the source to minimize the source resistance. The epitaxial layer is thick 
enough to minimize the effect of surface depletion on the source and drain resistance. The gate has the shape 
of a T-gate or mushroom-gate. The shorter dimension at the bottom of the gate is the electrical channel length 
and serves to optimize fT and gm, while the wider top portion reduces the gate resistance for an improved fmax. In 
addition, the length LGD is designed to be greater than the depletion width at gate-drain breakdown. 
The ion-implanted planar structure is useful for the fabrication of MESFET integrated circuit as shown20 in 
Fig. 31. The active region is created by ion implantation to overcompensate the deep-level impurities in the semi-
insulating substrate. A relatively light channel implant is used for the enhancement-mode switching device and a 
heavier implant is used for the depletion-mode load device. To minimize the source and drain parasitic resistance, 
the deeper n+-implantation source and drain regions should be as c1ose to the gate as possible. This is done by 
various self-aligned processes. In a gate-priority self-aligned process, the gate is formed first and the source/drain 
ion implantation is self-aligned to the gate. In this process, since ion implantation requires high-temperature 
annealing for activation, the gate must be made of materials that can withstand high-temperature processing. 
Examples are Ti-W alloy (for example TiWN), WSi2, and TaSi2. The second approach is ohmic-priority, where 
the source/drain implantation and anneal are done before the gate formation. This process relaxes the previous 
requirement on the gate material. A gate recess is usually not used for such digital IC fabrication because the 
uniformity of each depth is difficult to control, leading to unacceptable variation in the threshold voltage. This 
process sequence can also be used for a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC). Note that the gallium 
arsenide MESFET processing technology is similar to the silicon-based MOSFET processing technology.
Gallium arsenide ICs with complexities up to the large-scale integration level (~10,000 components per chip) 
have been fabricated. Because of the higher drift velocity (~20% higher than silicon), gallium arsenide ICs will have 
a 20% greater speed than silicon ICs that use the same design rules. However, substantial improvements in crystal 
quality and processing technology are needed before gallium arsenide can seriously challenge the preeminent 
position of silicon in ULSI applications.
 
15.5 CHALLENGES FOR NANOELECTRONICS 
Since the beginning of the integrated-circuit era in 1959, the minimum device dimension, also called the minimum 
feature length, has been reduced at an annual rate of about 13% (i.e., a reduction of 35% every three years). 
According to a prediction of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors,21 the minimum feature 
length will shrink from 130 nm in 2002 to 35 nm  around 2014, as shown in Table 1. Also shown in Table 1 is the 
DRAM size. The DRAM quadruples its memory cell capacity every three years, and 64 Gbit DRAM will be 
available in 2011 using 50 nm design rules. The table also shows that wafer size will increase to 450 mm (18 in. 
diameter) in 2014. In addition to the feature size reduction, challenges come at the device level, material level, and 
system level, as discussed in the following sections. 
15.5.1 Challenges for Integration 
Figure 32 shows the trends in power supply voltage VDD, threshold voltage VT, and gate oxide thickness d versus 
channel length for CMOS logic technology.22 From the figure, one  can find that the gate oxide thickness will soon 
approach the tunneling-current limit of 2 nm. VDD scaling will slow down because of nonscalable VT   (i.e., to

a minimum VT of about 0.3 V due to subthreshold leakage and circuit noise immunity). Some challenges of the 
180 nm technology and beyond are shown23 in Fig. 33. The most stringent requirements are as follows. 
Ultrashallow Junction Formation 
As mentioned in Chapter 6, the short-channel effect happens as the channel length is reduced. This problem 
becomes critical as the device dimension is scaled down to 100 nm. To achieve an ultrashallow junction with 
low sheet resistance, low-energy (less than 1 keV) implantation technology with high dosage must be employed 
to reduce the short-channel effect. Table 1 shows the required junction depth versus technology generation. The 
requirements of junction depths for 100 nm are around 20–33 nm with a doping concentration of 1 × 1020 /cm3.
Ultrathin Oxide 
As the gate length shrinks below 100 nm, the oxide equivalent thickness of gate dielectric must be reduced to 
around 2 nm to maintain performance. However, if only SiO2 (with a dielectric constant of 3.9) is used, leakage 
through the gate becomes very high because of direct tunneling. For this reason, thicker high-k dielectric materials 
that have lower leakage current are used to replace oxide. Candidates for the short term are silicon nitride (with a 
dielectric constant of 7), Ta2O5 (25), HfO2 (20–25), and TiO2 (60–100).
Silicide Formation 
Silicide-related technology has become an integral part of submicron devices for reducing parasitic resistance to 
improve device and circuit performance. The conventional Ti-silicide process has been widely used in 350–250 nm 
technology. However, the sheet resistance of a TiSi2 line increases with decreasing line width, which limits the use 
of TiSi2 in 180 nm CMOS applications and beyond. CoSi2 or NiSi processes will replace TiSi2 in the technology 
beyond 180 nm. 
534 Semiconductors

New Materials for Interconnection 
To achieve high-speed operation, the RC time delay of the interconnection must be reduced. 24 Figure 12 of 
Chapter 12 showed the delay as a function of feature size. It is obvious that the gate delay decreases as the channel 
length decreases; meanwhile, the delay resulting from interconnect increases significantly as the size decreases. This 
causes the total delay time to increase as the dimension of the device size scales below 100 nm. Consequently, both 
high-conductivity metals, such as Cu, and low-dielectric-constant (low-k) insulators, such as organic (polyimide) 
or inorganic (F-doped oxide) materials offer major performance gains. Cu exhibits superior performance because 
of its high conductivity (1.7 μΩ-cm compared with 2.7 μΩ-cm of Al) and is 10–100 times more resistant to 
electromigration. The delay using the Cu and low-k material shows a significant decrease compared with that of 
the conventional Al and oxide. Hence, Cu with the low-k material is essential in multilevel interconnection for 
future deep-submicron technology. 
Power Limitations 
The power required merely to charge and discharge circuit nodes in an IC is proportional to the number of gates 
and the frequency at which they are switched (clock frequency). The power can be expressed as P ≅  1/2CV 2 nf, 
where C is the capacitance per device, V is the applied voltage, n is the number of devices per chip, and f is the 
clock frequency. The temperature rise caused by this power dissipation in an IC package is limited by the thermal 
conductivity of the package material, unless auxiliary liquid or gas cooling is used. The maximum allowable 
temperature rise is limited by the bandgap of the semiconductor (~100°C for Si with a bandgap of 1.1 eV). For 
such a temperature rise, the maximum power dissipation of a typical high-performance package is about 10 W. 
As a result, we must limit either the maximum clock rate or the number of gates on a chip. As an example, in an 
IC containing 100 nm MOS devices with C = 5 × 10–2 fF, running at a 20 GHz clock rate, the maximum number 
of gates we can have is about 107 if we assume a 10% duty cycle. This is a design constraint fixed by basic material 
parameters. 
SOI Integration 
The isolation of the SOI was mentioned in Chapter 15, Section 15.2.2. Recently SOI technology has received 
more attention. The advantages of SOI integration become significant as the minimum feature length is reduced 
below 100 nm. From the process point of view, SOI does not need the complex well structure and isolation 
processes. In addition, shallow junctions are directly obtained through the SOI film thickness. There is no risk of 
nonuniform interdiffusion of silicon and Al in the contact regions because of oxide isolation at the bottom of the 
junction. Hence, the contact barrier is not necessary. From the device point of view, the modern bulk silicon device 
needs high doping at the drain and substrate to eliminate short-channel effects and punch-through. This high 
doping results in high capacitance when the junction is reversed bias. On the other hand, in SOI, the maximum 
capacitance between the junction and substrate is the capacitance of the buried insulator whose dielectric constant 
is three times smaller than that of silicon (3.9 versus 11.9). Based on the ring oscillator performance, the 130 nm 
SOI CMOS technology can achieve 25% faster speed or require 50% less power than a similar bulk technology.25 
SRAM, DRAM, CPU, and rf CMOS have all been successfully fabricated using SOI technology. Therefore SOI is 
a key candidate for the future system-on-a-chip technology, considered in the following section.

15.5.2 System-on-a-Chip 
The increased component density and improved fabrication technology have helped the realization of the system-
on-a-chip (SOC), that is, an IC chip that contains a complete electronic system. The designers can build all the 
circuitry needed for a complete electronic system, such as a camera, radio, television, or personal computer (PC), 
on a single chip. Figure 34 shows the SOC application in the PC’s motherboard. Components (11 chips in this 
case) once found on boards have become virtual components on the chip at the right.26 In addition, the system-on-
a-chip can be integrated into 3-D system integration27 and can have higher-level functions.
There are two obstacles to the realization of the SOC. The first is the huge complexity of the design. Since the 
component board is presently designed by different companies and different design tools, it is difficult to integrate 
them into one chip. The other is the difficulty of fabrication. In general, fabricating processes for the DRAM are 
significantly different from those of logic IC (e.g., CPU). Speed is the first priority for the logic, whereas leakage 
of the stored charge is the priority for memory. Therefore, multilevel interconnection using five to eight levels of 
metals is essential for logic IC to improve the speed. However, DRAM needs only two to three levels. In addition, 
to increase the speed, a silicide process must be used to reduce the series resistance, and ultrathin gate oxide is 
needed to increase the drive current. These requirements are not critical for the memory.
To achieve the SOC goal, an embedded DRAM technology is introduced, i.e., to merge logic and DRAM into 
a single chip with compatible processes. Figure 35 shows the schematic cross section of the embedded DRAM, 
including the DRAM cells and the logic CMOS devices.28 Some processing  steps  are  modified  as  a  compromise.  
The trench-type capacitor is used instead of the stacked type so that there is no height difference in the DRAM 
cell structure. In addition, multiple gate oxide thicknesses exist on the same wafer to accommodate multiple supply 
voltages and/or combine memory and logic circuits on one chip.

SUMMARY 
In this chapter we considered processing technologies for passive components, active devices, and ICs. Three 
major IC technologies based on the bipolar transistor, the MOSFET, and the MESFET were discussed in detail. 
It appears that the MOSFET will be the dominant technology in the foreseeable future because of its superior 
performance compared with the bipolar transistor. For sub-100 nm CMOS technology, a good candidate is the 
combination of an SOI-substrate with interconnections using Cu and low-k materials. 
Because the rapid reduction in feature length, the technology will soon reach its practical limit as the channel 
length is reduced to about 20 nm. What the device beyond the CMOS will be is the question being asked by 
research scientists. Major candidates include many innovative devices based on quantum mechanical effects. This 
is because when the lateral dimension is reduced to below 100 nm, depending on the materials and the temperature 
of operation, electronic structures will exhibit nonclassical behaviors. The operation of such devices will be on the 
scale of single-electron transport. This approach has been demonstrated by the single-electron memory cell. The 
realization of such systems with trillions of components will be a major challenge beyond CMOS.29

Derivation of the Density of States 
in a Semiconductor
3-D Density of States
For a three dimensional (3-D) structure such as a bulk semiconductor, to calculate the electron and hole concentrations 
in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, we need to know the density of states, that is, the number of allowed 
energy states per unit energy per unit volume (i.e., in the unit of number of states/eV/cm3). 
When electrons move back and forth along the x-direction in a semiconductor material, the movements can 
be described by standing-wave oscillations. The wavelength λ of a standing wave is related to the length of the 
semiconductor L by
 
L
nx
λ
, 
(1)
where nx is an integer. The wavelength can be expressed by de Broglie hypothesis:
 
λ
h
px
, 
(2)
where h is the Planck’s constant and px is the momentum in the x-direction. Substituting
Eq. 2 into Eq. 1 gives
 
Lp
hn
x
x . 
(3)
The incremental momentum dpx required for a unity increase in nx is
 
Ldp
h
x
. 
(4)
For a three-dimensional cube of side L, we have
 
L3 dpx dpy dpz = h3. 
(5)
The volume dpx dpy dpz in the momentum space for a unit cube (L = 1) is thus equal to h3. Each incremental change 
in n corresponds to a unique set of integers (nx, ny, nz), which in turn corresponds to an allowed energy state. Thus, the 
volume in momentum space for an energy state is h3. Figure 1 shows the momentum space in spherical coordinates. 
The volume between two concentric spheres (from p to p+dp  p2dp. The number of energy states contained in the 
volume is the 	
p2dp)/h3, where the factor 2 accounts for the electron spins.

quantum dot (0-D) 
2-D Density of States 
In two-dimensional structures such as the quantum well, the derivation of 2-D density of states is almost the same as 
for 3-D except that one of the p-space components is fixed. Instead of finding the number of p-states enclosed within a 
sphere, we calculate the number of p-states lying in an annulus of radius p to p + dp. The incremental momentum dpx 
required for a unity increase in nx is
 
Ldpx = h. 
(10)
For a two-dimensional square of side L, we have
 
L2 dpx dpy = h2. 
(11)
The area dpx dpy in the momentum space for a unit square (L = 1) is thus equal to h2. Figure 3 shows the momentum 
space in circular coordinates. The area between two concentric circles (from p to p+dp  	pdp. The number of energy

The 2-D density of states does not depend on energy. As the top of the energy gap is reached, there is a significant 
number of available states. Taking into account the other energy levels in the quantum well, the density of states 
becomes the staircase-like function shown in Fig. 2b.
551

Fig. 3 The momentum space in circular coordinates.
1-D Density of States 
In one-dimensional structures such as the quantum wire, two of the p-space components are fixed. Compared with 2-D, 
the p-space becomes a line. The wavelength λ of a standing wave is related to the length of the semiconductor L by
 
L
nx
λ / 2 =

(14)
The incremental momentum dpx required for a unity increase in nx is
 
2LdP
h

(15)
The dpx in the momentum space for a line with a unit length (L= 1) is thus equal to h/2. 
Figure 4 shows the momentum space in line coordinates. The length between p to p+dp is dp. The number of energy 
states contained in the line is then 2dp/(h/2), where the factor 2 accounts for the electron spins.

0-D Density of States 
In a 0-D structure such as a quantum dot, the values of p are quantized in all directions. All the available states exist only 
at discrete energies and can be represented by a delta function as shown in Fig. 2d. The density of states in a quantum 
dot is continuous and independent of energy. In a real quantum dot, however, the size distribution leads to a broadening 
of this line function.

Derivation of 
Recombination Rate for 
Indirect Recombination
A schematic diagram of the various transitions that occur in recombination through recombination centers is 
shown in Fig. 13 of Chapter 2. If the concentration of centers in the semiconductor is Nt, the concentration of 
unoccupied centers is given by Nt(1-F), where F is the Fermi distribution function for the probability that a center 
is occupied by an electron. In equilibrium,

where Et is the energy level of the center and EF is the Fermi level.
Therefore, the capture rate of an electron by a recombination center (Fig. 13a of Chapter 2) is  given by

(3)
The product vthn may be visualized as the volume swept out per unit time by an electron with cross section n. If 
the center lies within this volume, the electron will be captured by it.
The rate of emission of electrons from the center (Fig. 13b) is the inverse of the electron capture process. The 
rate is proportional to the concentration of centers occupied by electrons, that is, NtF. We have

(4)
The proportionality constant en is called the emission probability. At thermal equilibrium the rates of capture and 
emission of electrons must be equal (Ra = Rb) Thus, the emission probability can be expressed in terms of the quantities 
already defined in Eq. 3:

Let us now consider the nonequilibrium case in which an n-type semiconductor is illuminated uniformly to 
give a generation rate GL. Thus in addition to the process shown in Fig. 13, electron-hole pairs are generated as a 
result of light. In steady state the electrons entering and leaving the conduction band must be equal. This is called 
the principle of detailed balance, and it yields

Calculation of the Transmission Coefﬁcient 
for a Symmetric Resonant-Tunneling Diode
To calculate the transmission coefficient, we consider Fig. 9a of Chapter 8 where the five regions (I, II, III, IV, 
V) are specified by the coordinates (x1, x2, x3, x4). The Schrödinger equation for an electron in any region can be 
written as

For a double-barrier structure with finite barrier height and width, the energy level (for a given n) will be lower; 
however, it will have a similar dependence on the effective mass and well width, that is, En increases with decreasing

where P is the pressure, V is the volume of one mole of gas, R is the gas constant (1.98 cal/mol-K, or 82 atm-

Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 10-23 J/K, or 1.37 × 10-22 atm-cm2/K). Since real gases behave more and more like 
the ideal gas as the pressure is lowered, Eq. l is valid for most vacuum processes. We can use Eq. l to calculate the

An important parameter for vacuum technology is the molecular impingement rate, that is, how many 
molecules impinge on a unit area per unit time. To obtain this parameter, first consider the distribution function fυx
