Zero-Point Energy
c.1923 – early 1925. Only after the introduction of the concept of  spin in late 1925
and the development of quantum mechanics could the observed splittings and rela-
tive intensities for the anomalous Zeeman effect be properly derived and physically
understood as the result of gyroscopic forces of the electron’s magnetic moment
μ = −eh/2mc, i.e. one full Bohr magneton and not half a Bohr magneton, as would
be expected from classical electron theory (see [9, pp. 97ff., 108] [6]).

Zero-Point Energy
Peter W. Milonni
The concept of zero-point energy ﬁrst appeared in 1912, when Max Planck (1858–
1947) published his “second theory” of  black-body radiation [1]. In this theory the
energy of a harmonic oscillator of frequency ν in thermal equilibrium at temperature
T is equal to

where h and k are, respectively, the Planck and Boltzmann constants. The second
term on the right is the zero-point energy, i.e., the energy at zero temperature, where
all motion should cease and the energy should be zero according to classical physics.
The assumptions about the emission and absorption of radiation that led to Planck’s
expression were not justiﬁed by the fully developed quantum theory that came later,
but (1) turned out to be correct. Zero-point energy was invoked shortly after Planck’s
work by Einstein and Stern [2], who used it to explain the observed temperature de-
pendence of the speciﬁc heat of molecular hydrogen, and by Debye [3], who noted
that zero-point energy of the atoms of a crystal lattice would cause a reduction in
the intensity of the diffracted radiation in X-ray diffraction even as the temperature
approached absolute zero. In 1924 Mulliken [4] provided direct evidence for the
zero-point energy of molecular vibrations by comparing the band spectra of B10O
and B11O: the isotopic difference in the transition frequencies between the ground
vibrational states of two different electronic levels would vanish if there were no
zero-point energy, in contrast to the observed spectra. A year later the zero-point
energy of a harmonic oscillator was deduced from Heisenberg’s  matrix mechan-
ics [5] and shortly thereafter from  Schr¨odinger’s equation. The energy levels of a
harmonic oscillator of frequency ν are given according to quantum theory by
En = (n + 1
2)hν , n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... .

For an oscillator with spring constant k and mass m, ν =

k/4π2m and the
zero-point energy E0 =
)
h2k/16π2m is seen to be largest for small masses. Thus,
because of their small masses, He3 and He4 do not solidify at small pressures as
T →0 because their zero-point motion prevents crystallization.
Zero-point energy is important in the quantum theory of radiation, according to
which each ﬁeld mode of frequency ν has zero-point energy 1
2hν. This allows the
interpretation of the van der Waals interaction between two atoms, for instance,
in terms of a change in the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. More
generally the presence of matter modiﬁes the zero-point ﬁeld energy in a way that
depends on the nature and distribution of the matter, and this can result in small
but measurable forces between macroscopic bodies. The best known example of
this consequence of zero-point ﬁeld energy is the Casimir force between uncharged,
perfectly conducting plates.  Casimir effect.
Although zero-point energy is an integral part of basic quantum theory [6–8],
it leads to a profound difﬁculty when considered in the context of general rela-
tivity. Any energy density of the vacuum contributes to a cosmological constant
of the type introduced by Einstein in order to obtain static solutions to his ﬁeld
equations. The zero-point energy density of the vacuum, due to all quantum ﬁelds,
is extremely large, even when we cut off the largest allowable frequencies based
on plausible physical arguments. It implies a cosmological constant larger than the
limits imposed by observation by about 120 orders of magnitude. This “cosmologi-
cal constant problem” remains unresolved.
