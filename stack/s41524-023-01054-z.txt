INTRODUCTION
“I really am not seeing how women are still considered
disadvantaged in our ﬁeld.”
This phrase is heard all-too-often by woman scientists across
many ﬁelds. And while attitudes on gender equity and parity have
considerably improved in recent history, there are still measurable
inequities stemming from systemic bias in the career progression,
recognition, and perception of women in the sciences, including
our sub-ﬁeld of computational materials research.
Addressing the obstacles to equity is in the interests of all of us.
Making research inclusive is critical, not only from an ethical
standpoint, but also for attracting and retaining dedicated and
talented minds, enhancing the vibrancy of all ﬁelds, and nurturing
a diverse range of ideas. Diversity in representation and thought
can increase a group’s collective intelligence, improve productiv-
ity, and improve retention in growing ﬁelds such as ours1–3.
Representation of the entire populace is also necessary for
ensuring that science is responsible and relevant to societal
needs4.
In this perspective, we review the current challenges and
barriers for women in the sciences, citing data and analyses from
the literature, and including, where appropriate, contextualized
anecdotes. Many of these experiences are not singular to gender,
and often intersect and compound with other aspects of one’s
identity, including those related to race, sexual orientation,
religion, country of origin, and disability. Yet, while it may be
true that improving equity along one dimension of diversity may
improve the environment for everyone, it is important to both
independently and intersectionally center these other dimensions
in actions and initiatives, as biases against other underrepresented
populations are also nuanced and deserving of attention.
Although the intersecting set of challenges faced by women in
the sciences is daunting, numerous efforts are ongoing to address
them at both the individual and collective levels. We close by
outlining some of these successful practices to further equity in
the sciences.
HOW REPRESENTATIVE IS THE CURRENT ACADEMIC
LANDSCAPE IN COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS RESEARCH?
"During my undergraduate studies (only about a decade
ago), I had one woman professor in my materials science
classes and none in my computer science classes. And in
these classrooms, I was one of a few women, if not the only
woman, present. Because of this, my male professors often
took an opportunity to single me out or ask me to relate
their examples to my lived-in experience. All of this
subconsciously communicated that I didn’t belong or that
I had to be extraordinary to justify my presence.” (Female
researcher)
We start by quantifying and contextualizing the number of
women within the relevant ﬁelds of materials science and
engineering (MSE), chemical engineering (ChE), physics, and
chemistry, noting especially how the proportion of women drops
at every rung of the career ladder (a phenomenon often referred
to as the “leaky pipeline”).
Each year the US Department of Education National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES) reports the number of degrees
awarded by US academic institutions, separated by discipline
and gender. From their reported data (covering 1992–2019)5, see
Fig. 1, we see some improvement in undergraduate representa-
tion over the past 30 years in the chemistry and MSE ﬁelds, in
which the percentage of degrees awarded to women increased by
5–10% (with chemistry recently reaching parity). Other ﬁelds, such
as chemical engineering and physics, have remained somewhat
stagnant in undergraduate degree representation. Across all ﬁelds,
the proportion of graduate degrees awarded to women has
steadily increased over the past 30 years. While we lack similarly
granular data for most other countries, corresponding trends have
been noted for non-US institutions6–8, namely that despite gains
in proportional representation in related graduate degrees, the
gap between male and female undergraduates in science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines
often still looms large. These trends project that many graduate
programs should reach parity within the next century;
however, reaching parity within the undergraduate popula-
tions (apart from chemistry) is likely impossible in the near
future without any meaningful changes in the current rates.
These trends reﬂect the disciplines at large, not solely the
computationally-focused subdivisions within each ﬁeld. Alar-
mingly, the nearby ﬁelds of computer science and mathematics
have shown a noted decline in the proportion of female
graduates in the past decades9, which suggests that the
improvement in the representation of women in theory- and
computation-focused physical sciences may be below what is
suggested by the discipline-wide data.
According to the Academic Analytics Research Center, which
compiles data on academic representation and recognition,
roughly 14–20% of professors (at all ranks) in these ﬁelds are
women10,11, see Fig. 2, with the representation dropping with

professorial rank (i.e., signiﬁcantly more women are junior and
mid-level professors than full professors). The proportion of
women entering faculty positions in STEM has risen in recent
years12; thus, the lack of senior women faculty could be partially
explained by the retirement and turnover of historically male
faculties. However, Wapman et al.13 showed that the higher
attrition rate of (both non-white and) female faculty members
largely contributes to the lack of diversity at higher professorial
ranks and noted that strong emphasis should be placed on
retaining diverse colleagues in academic departments.
WHAT CAUSES AND PERPETUATES DISADVANTAGES IN
RESEARCH ENVIRONMENTS?
In order to take positive actions to address the current and
historical barriers faced by women in STEM environments, it is
ﬁrst necessary to understand the underlying causes and effects
of these barriers. We hope this will not only help to raise
awareness in the community, but will also serve as a concise
summary and starting point for researchers committed to
making a difference in transforming the research landscape.
We summarize the sociological phenomena that lead to
gender-based inequities, many of which can be addressed by
thorough
and
regular
unconscious
bias
training.
These
inequities can be primary and/or secondary in nature, i.e.,
disadvantages caused by both underlying stereotypes of
women and by the response of society, institutions, and
persons to these stereotypes. These are also summarized in
Fig. 3.
Implicit bias
“I would say the societal expectation that scientists should
be non-female. This starts out as an expectation from
families and school teachers and friends that young women
shouldn’t become scientists so that they don’t explore the
option. Then it manifests as unconscious bias or even active
discrimination in evaluations of woman scientists’ work, as
well as in gender-based harassment. I would say that the
expectation probably stems in turn from the fact that there
are not so many leading women scientists and so when
people think of a scientist, they don’t think of somebody
female.” (Prof. Dr. Nicola Spaldin, when asked about the
biggest challenges facing women scientists)14
We all hold unconscious biases, shaped by the stereotypes of
our wider cultural environment and experiences. While creating
such stereotypes is an unavoidable consequence of human
cognition, these perceptions often negatively affect women (or,
more broadly, anyone adopting behavior typically associated with
women15,16), even if there is no intention of hurt or discrimina-
tion17. Addressing unconscious bias is difﬁcult and necessary for
even the most allied scientist, as most of our stereotypes and
schemas operate below the level of awareness.
Unrecognized biases mean that women often face rather
different expectations than their male colleagues in the research
environment18,19. STEM areas (especially engineering and
computing) are still widely perceived as “boys’ subjects”19.
These perceptions are not only ingrained in our society’s
understanding of certain topics but also shape society’s ongoing
narrative about who is a scientist and what it looks like to
achieve scientiﬁc progress. For example, recent efforts have
focused on training artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) on societal data in
order to predict correlations20. If you ask a recently trending
image generator21 for “four computational materials scientists
having a research discussion”, the generator will return an image
of four older white men around a table (see Fig. 4). As AI
technologies become embedded in every aspect of modern life, it
is pivotal that we engage in a critical discussion on how we can
avoid using these tools to reinforce harmful stereotypes.

Women’s contributions are often further underrepresented
in or excluded from science textbooks22, contributing to
damaging
stereotypes
about
who
is (and
who
is not)
a
“scientist”23.
The
widespread
perception
that
women
lack
academic excellence in comparison to their male peers exists at
all levels of the science educational system24–27. The internaliza-
tion of these stereotypes can lead to lower performance28 and
interest29 among women and girls in scientiﬁc environments, thus
compounding the exclusion of women from these spaces.
Women are also deemed less likely to be leaders (by both men
and other women) and are less likely to be accepted as leaders18,30.
This directly affects researchers’ success, as students are less likely to
choose a female supervisor or join a group with a female primary
investigator (PI), believing them to be less capable of helping one’s
career progression and less prestigious to work with overall31.
The Madame Curie strategy
“... the Madame Curie strategy, as it was termed earlier, of
quiet but deliberate over-qualiﬁcation, personal modesty,
strong self-discipline, and inﬁnite stoicism [required to
assimilate into a male-dominated workplace].” (Margaret
Rossiter)32
Despite the decades since this coinage, the “narrow band of
acceptable behavior” specially required for women’s success in
science, particularly personality traits associated with modesty and
quietude, is a common theme in many women’s accounts of social
obstacles to their success33. These expectations can both determine

how women choose to comport themselves and how they are
received—statistically, women are offered fewer opportunities to
express their opinion than men, responses and answers given to
women are often less detailed and less informative, women are
more likely to be interrupted when speaking, and their ideas
dismissed (then sometimes, ironically, applauded when a man raises
them)31,34. When women are not in the extreme minority and
encouraged to participate meaningfully, there is a measurable
positive impact on the productivity and problem-solving capacity of
a team, based on increases in conversational turn-taking and
cooperativeness and improved collaborative patterns1,35–37.
Women also tend to underestimate their own skills, especially
in environments where gendered stereotypes are active38, and
this culminates in “biased” self-assessment and reductions in
seeking out opportunities, self-promotion, and self-nomination.
Successful self-promotion is a crucial tool for succeeding in a
research
environment
and
enhancing
one’s
visibility
and
perceived competence. While men usually employ this success-
fully, self-promoting women are found to be less likable or
hireable16,18,39–41.
Thus when women deviate from socially expected behaviors
and adopt traditionally male-associated communication styles,
there is a backlash12,42,43, and noting these more subtle forms of
discrimination are often dismissed as personal sensitivity.
Caring responsibilities
“If you were to draw conclusions about faculty demo-
graphics from reading conﬁdential letters, you’d conclude
that only women have children (as you rarely read about
family matters in letters about men).” (Judith D. Singer,
quoting a reference letter she had received)44
Many will point to familial responsibilities as a reason for the
delayed progression of women in research positions45. Child-
bearing typically occurs within the crucial and productive early
stages of a research career, and women researchers are more
likely than their male counterparts to limit their starting or
growing of a family in order to further their career46. Additionally,
women are twice as likely to leave their STEM research positions
than men in the years following the birth of their ﬁrst child, with
an attrition rate of 50% compared to 25%47. The irony is that
balancing work and family is a conundrum universal to all parents,
of any gender. So why are women with children experiencing
greater career depression than men with children47,48?
Despite the evolution of gender roles over the past ﬁfty years,
caring roles are still mostly assumed by women12, with the COVID-
19 pandemic likely to have caused setbacks49. There are multiple
arguments
to
be
made
here:
(1)
women
choose
familial
obligations over scientiﬁc ambition or (2) the social norms and
infrastructure of STEM institutions do not adequately support
women who both want to pursue a scientiﬁc career and choose to
have children or care for a relative.
The reality is a messy combination of the two—women
should always be free to choose to have children or to leave
scientiﬁc careers, but some have this choice made for them
based upon a lack of meaningful partner engagement or
institutional support. And even if a woman chooses to pursue
both paths in life, the assumptions made about a woman’s
commitment or responsibilities can result in further exclusion
from networking and collaboration opportunities12, leading
many women with children or caring responsibilities to feel
behind their male counterparts50.
Lack of role models and visibility
“I don’t think there are any role models I know who
managed to balance academic career and a family and life”
(Female chemistry PhD student)11
Lack of female role models negatively inﬂuences self-esteem
and prevents the formation of one’s identity as a woman
scientist51. The lack of visibility creates the perception that female
scientists are isolated and disconnected, which discourages other
women from imagining their own place in the research landscape,
thereby contributing to the leaky pipeline31.
Representation at conferences can be a particularly powerful
way of enhancing visibility and increasing the esteem of women
scientists. At the Psi-k conference series (1000+ international
participants) in 2010, only 10% of invited speakers were women;
this proportion increased slightly to 16% in 2015, which still meant
that at least half of the symposia had no women as invited
speakers. Encouragingly, due to the (slow) change in the
landscape and an increased emphasis by the organizers on an
improved balance of representation, in 2022, 25% of invited
speakers were women (with the proportion of women being the
same for contributed talks as well.)
HOW DO THESE DISADVANTAGES MANIFEST?
The biases and barriers described in the previous section manifest
in a range of different measurable ways. It is worth noting that
even 1–3% differential effects result in a signiﬁcant disparity in
career progression in the long term, due to cumulative effects52,
and so addressing these barriers is of utmost importance for
fostering an equitable community.
Like their underlying causes, many of these disadvantages can
be primary (directly stemming from one of the causes in the
previous section) or secondary/tertiary (a resultant effect of
historical or institutional inequity). Note that we are not discussing
explicit sexism (e.g., inappropriately commenting on a colleague’s
physical appearance or personal life), harassment, or abuse. As a
community, we should agree that explicit sexism should be
universally condemned, and perpetrators of these actions
should be held accountable. These overt actions are often
mistakenly considered the sum-total of sexism in the workplace;
here, we choose to elaborate on less clear-cut microaggressions
and inequities and the cumulative harm that they cause53.
Recognition
“I am more likely to be dismissed when I contribute. It took
a lot longer for my efforts to be recognized than my male
counterparts. More credence is given to male coworkers’
ideas who have not proven themselves yet.” (Female
software engineer)34
“Several times, I was so excited as I made ‘famous people’
in my ﬁeld ‘wake up’ or pay attention when I took the
podium at a conference (because of the novelty of a
woman speaking) or spoke in a meeting; only afterwards
to hearing through the grapevine that they just commen-
ted on my looks. Honestly, it is a very double-edged sword,
being different in any way. Immediate attention is yours,
but many times—no matter how well you do and how you
perform—you can’t sway the inherent prejudice. I imagine
that is the same for any ﬁeld when you are not
mainstream.” (Prof. Kristin Persson, in an interview with
the Edison Awards, on the support of the ﬁeld in the
context of being a woman)54

The under-attribution of women’s contributions to the scientiﬁc
endeavor is a phenomenon that has been identiﬁed and discussed
for over 150 years55, and is ubiquitous enough to have garnered
the name the “Matilda Effect”56. Women often do not receive
the same level of recognition for scientiﬁc achievements as
men, with their contributions more likely to be overlooked,
discredited, or attributed to a man. This under-attribution can
manifest in many ways within academia, including the devaluing
of women’s contributions to research papers57, the association of
women authors’ contributions with lower scientiﬁc value24, the
increased likelihood that women will not be credited with
authorship for the work they produce (especially if that work
has a higher potential to attract signiﬁcant recognition)58, fewer
invited papers published by women59, and lower rates of success
among women in disseminating their work online60. The effects of
these exclusions are particularly damaging for scientists in the
early stages of their careers, for whom recognition often unlocks
future opportunities within the broader research community. The
following sections detail manifestations of this under-recognition
in speciﬁc academic contexts.
Citation.
“I often notice at conferences that as a woman steps onto
the podium, several members of the audience open their
devices to check her citation record and H-index. This rarely
happens to male speakers.” (Male early career researcher)
Citations are one of the primary means by which academics
recognize each other’s work61. In keeping with the general trend
of the under-recognition of women’s contributions to science,
papers written by women suffer from lower citation rates with
respect to papers written by men across a wide range of
ﬁelds62–74. This discrepancy is more pronounced in ﬁelds with a
larger gender disparity74, or if a man most likely compiled the
reference list73. In analyzing their own editorial decisions, the
Royal Society of Chemistry also found that small gender disparities
also exist in the authorship of manuscripts rejected without peer
review74.
Recommendation letters.
“When you read conﬁdential letters, you often ﬁnd that
women are nice, have children, and balance work and
career. I’m conﬁdent that most of the people who write
these things truly believe they’re being helpful, but I’m here
to say that they are not!” (Judith D. Singer)44
Subjective evaluation is a necessary part of recognition –
without mechanisms for subjective input, each researcher would
be boiled down to citation metrics and funding numbers.
However, it was shown that recommendation letters for women
researchers are shorter and contain more references to personal
traits, fewer to academic achievements, and more “doubt-raisers”,
i.e., word or phrase choices that bring into question an applicant’s
qualiﬁcation. These doubt-raisers can be as simple as including
irrelevant information or hedging qualiﬁers (“the candidate may
make a good colleague”) or they can be as overt as focusing on
candidate’s weaknesses, rather than strengths.75–77
Funding and resources.
In a survey led by the International Union
of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), female researchers were
signiﬁcantly less likely to feel that they had access to sufﬁcient
resources (both monetary and otherwise) to conduct their work
than their male counterparts50. And it has been shown that the
proportion of women grant awardees is lower than the proportion
of women applicants78,79. Even when overall success rates for men
and women are equal, women receive less research funding than
men, and are less often listed as principal investigators. Studies
show that the language used through the funding allocation
process (from the original funding call to instructions and
evaluations) is often heavily gendered, with “the quality of
researcher” regularly being rated higher for men, even where no
gender difference in the “quality of proposal” was found78.
Awards and prizes.
“In the 27 years that this award has been given, I am the ﬁrst
female recipient. While I would not argue with the worthiness
or accomplishments of the previous winners, you would be
hard-pressed to convince me that there hasn’t been one
woman before me who deserved this honor.” (Prof. Sharon C.
Glotzer, upon winning the Aneesur Rahman Prize for
Computational Physics from the American Physical Society)
Men continue to win a higher proportion of awards for scholarly
research than expected based on their representation in the
nomination pool (eight times more likely for scholarly awards and
three times more likely for young investigator awards)80. For
example, for awards relevant to our ﬁeld, where we could collect
data on awardees for multiple years: PRACEdays Award (10%),
Volker Heine Young Investigator Award ﬁnalists (10%). This is the
result of the combination of lack of self-promotion and self-
nomination of women and lack of seeking out nominations by
others. Man-only panels are 50% less likely to choose a female
scientist than a panel with one female member, with the gender
of the panel chair mattering the most43,81.
“Women-only” awards and funding (including schemes for those
returning from a career break or having caring responsibilities, which
predominantly receive applications from women) were originally
structured to address award-based inequities, and many provide
scientists with non-traditional backgrounds the opportunity to
pursue research and increase their visibility. However, siloing
women into restricted categories can have several unintended
troubling effects, including gender-restricted awards being per-
ceived as “lesser” versions of non-gender-restricted awards, and can
over-inﬂate the statistics of gender equity in awards24,80. For
example, the authors of ref. 80 noted that gender-based awards
caused a 55% inﬂation in the proportion of American Physical
Society honors awarded to women in the 2000s. Quotas can be
regarded as tokenism, resulting in a backlash from colleagues and
negatively impacting the conﬁdence of women82.
Student evaluations.
“I teach a computational modeling class for undergraduates
together with a male colleague. Students regularly address
him as ‘Professor’ and address me as ‘Miss’, and once a
student told me they had not expected that women could
write a code.” (Female assistant professor)
Bias is also present in student evaluations83. Female lecturers
are more often evaluated based on personality or appearance. As
feminine behavioral characteristics are associated with being
likeable and approachable, students generally expect more
sympathy and social sensitivity from female lecturers84, and thus
penalize discrepancies from this stereotype, such as ageism,
especially for middle-aged women85. On the other hand, mascu-
line traits are associated with more competence and better
leadership30, with male lecturers generally achieving higher
student ratings, even in experimental studies that equalize
teaching quality84,86,87. While evaluation differences seem to have
been decreasing over the past decade, it is a worrying trend that
in recent years the proportion of abusive student comments have
increased, speciﬁcally towards women and those from margin-
alized groups88.

Barriers in working environment
Opportunities for networking.
Social networks appear to be more
beneﬁcial for men, with similar networks resulting in more job and
collaboration opportunities for men than for women89. Informal
social settings are often dominated by men, due to their higher
availability (looser caring commitments), choice of setting (venues
perceived as male-dominated, e.g. pubs), or women not being
invited to avoid misconception of sexual advances. This exclusion
from informal research networks12 reduces women’s ability to
network, feeling of connectedness and inclusion, and ability to
gather information through informal channels34,90. Furthermore,
in male-dominated groups gender-linked interactional behaviors
are more likely to emerge. Data has shown that male group-
leaders are not only less likely to have female graduate students
and postdoctoral researchers in their group, but that the ratio gets
worse as the prestige of the group (or the PI) increases91. This
negatively affects the training and networking opportunities
available through the most elite environments.
Workload.
“There are lots of things expected of you as a woman in
academia but there is no equality in terms of what is
recognized that contributes to your progression” (Female
academic)11
“In addition, very often women, especially women in STEM
ﬁelds, are in high demand for service roles in their home
institutions as well as in service to the ﬁeld. Committees for
federal funding agencies, technical societies, and within
universities, as well as editorial positions, strive to ensure
gender balance. Because there are generally fewer women
in STEM ﬁelds, this means that a smaller number of women
are asked to serve on a large number of these positions.
This can be overwhelming for women at every stage of their
career.” (Prof. Susan Sinnott, in an interview with Elsevier)92
While an organizational culture of overwork results in dis-
satisfaction for both women and men, women are more likely to
suffer negative consequences, from poor health to leaving their
academic positions19,93. Women tend to be asked to do more,
more often94, and are more likely to agree to (and volunteer to)
perform tasks95 that are less likely to be taken into account during
promotion processes (e.g., mentoring, report writing, and note-
taking in meetings)96. Women also tend to have higher teaching
loads97. These responsibilities do not necessarily lead to promo-
tion within academia, further exacerbating gender segregation at
higher career stages (or vertical gender segregation).
OKAY... SO WHAT CAN WE DO?
The ﬁrst step in addressing the barriers is to acknowledge the
existence of bias and that we are all inﬂuenced by stereotypes,
either consciously or unconsciously. First and foremost, raising
awareness, educating ourselves, participating in training, and
learning to challenge others’ and our own perceptions is
critical. Similarly, while creating action plans based on research
and evidence is an important tool to facilitate institutional change,
holding ourselves accountable for actually implementing action
plans is just as crucial98.
Unconscious bias training consists of raising awareness of
gender biases and working actively to make unconscious biases
conscious, so that they can be challenged. It is important that this
happens both among men and women and targets both students
and established researchers, to facilitate culture change in the
long term99. Experiential training can change perceptions, raise
self-awareness, and teach skills to effectively respond to and avert
biased situations. Taking these lessons, we can then more
consciously
and
effectively
employ
EDI-focused
toolkits
to
improve our practices as educators and researchers100.
However, unconscious bias training is not a silver bullet: To be
effective, the employed training programs have to be well-designed
and evidence-based101, and augmented with other positive actions.
Implicit assumption tests might be useful tools for augmenting
training programs102. There are tools available for both identifying
our own biased thoughts and gender-based wording in letters,
assessments and advertisements, including but not limited to:
●
Implicit Bias across Multiple Dimensions
●
Gender Bias in Recommendation Letters
●
Gender Bias in Job Advertisements
“It will also be important to ensure that biases are fought
with and for them at every step of the way, EACH and
EVERY time they arise, including subtle biases.” (Prof. Giulia
Galli, in an interview with AZoM, on barriers facing women
in the ﬁeld)103
Gender representation metrics
While collecting data in itself does not bring change, having
access
to
good
quality
statistics
is
necessary
to
pinpoint
particularly problematic processes or to measure progress in
gender representation in research. Accordingly, the collection of
information related to gender ratios in various academic contexts
(if this can be done anonymously) would contribute to useful
benchmarks. For example, it would be useful to quantify and
report the proportion of women attending or presenting at
conferences, or to publish yearly reports on the gender ratio of
authors in scientiﬁc journals.
Changing the narrative
STEM research, especially engineering and computing, is often
perceived as unengaged from society and mostly involving
solitary work. By showing and advertising how these research
areas can contribute to communal goals, we can help dismantle
these barriers and make the area more appealing to students of
more diverse backgrounds. For example, we can emphasize that a
wide variety of expertise is necessary to become a STEM scientist,
thereby
removing
the
narrow
focus
on
speciﬁc
math
or
computing skills, to ﬁght the perception that women are not
naturally a good ﬁt in these STEM research areas19.
Role models are critical for encouraging women to join computa-
tional materials science and helping to engender a sense of
belonging and professional conﬁdence51,104. To increase the visibility
of women in academic contexts, individuals can strive to draw from a
diverse range of examples in teaching, or invite a balanced set of
speakers at conferences, seminar series, and panel discussions.
However, until we reach parity, we must remember that a 50–50
representation can put an unrealistic burden on the much smaller
number of female researchers. Accommodating ﬂexibility in
timing and virtual attendance can help to alleviate some of the
burden, in addition to incorporating free childcare facilities at
conferences for those lacking alternate support.
As a community, we should spearhead a multi-national,
multi-institution effort to create a database of female and
underrepresented
computational
materials
scientists
to
amplify lesser-known researchers and distribute the efforts
put forth in favor of equity, and individuals should follow those
already involved in the effort of highlighting female scientists (e.g.,
Dr. Jess Wade and the 500 Women Scientists Project or Dr. Adriana
Paluszny and the Watson Forum).

Mentoring of young researchers from diverse backgrounds is
critical to support those historically excluded from the ﬁeld. Effective
mentoring offers regular contact for an extended time period, with
meaningful training offered for mentors105. Individuals should
promote multi-dimensional mentorship and evaluation in both
research and teaching endeavors (for which there are many resources,
including ref.
100), and institutions should develop and support
formalized mentoring programs that extend not only to academic
development but also adopt a holistic view of professional growth106.
“I would suggest trying to ﬁnd a good mentor, a person who
does not just want you to publish a certain number of papers
per year for their celebrity, but that instead really tries to help
you grow as a person and teaches you, for example, how to
give good presentations, how to write papers, how to deal
with these difﬁcult situations, and also how to behave as a
scientist.” (Prof. Laura Gagliardi, in an interview with AZoM, on
advice for young women in the ﬁeld)107
Reform of funding and research metrics
We advocate for an innovative reform of the funding landscape to
address cumulative bias, such as introducing a “Universal Basic
Research grant”, and open discussions on the role and legitimacy of
individual awards43,108. For all grants and awards, we can actively
work on widening the nomination pool, and encouraging a wider
set of researchers to nominate. We can also create and publish
metrics of nominators and nominees at the end of the selection
process (thereby raising awareness, practicing transparency, and
tracking our progress in addressing bias)109. The recommendations
of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA),
which intends to stop the practice of correlating publication and
journal impact factor to the merits of an individual scientist’s
contributions110, are especially salient here. Double-blind peer
review can also be a helpful tool to lessen the effect of biases111.
Improving the working environment consists of ensuring that
job responsibilities can be adjusted (part time, ﬂexible working,
leave policy) without carrying a stigma93, and that adjustments are
made available irrespective of the staff member’s gender.
Inclusiveness at the workplace must also extend to informal social
interactions, to foster a shared identity and improve career
outcomes for women90.
For family responsibilities12, adjustments consist of providing
adequate on-site childcare facilities, promoting shared parental-
leave policies, and creating institutional policies for modiﬁed duties
(with a reduction of non-promotable workload)112,113. Sufﬁcient
parental leave and professional responsibility adjustments are
critical pillars of institutional support, not only for mothers but for
all parents, as well as the cultivation of the norm that both parents
make use of these policies46–48. We point interested readers to the
excellent book “Do Babies Matter?: Gender and Family in the Ivory
Tower”, for a focused discussion on the topic46.
“I can just advise young women to think for themselves, and
be conﬁdent in what they do not to give up their dreams
too easily. And don’t let anybody tell them that they have to
choose between a career and a family.” (Prof. Dr. Silvana
Botti, in an interview with Friedrich Schiller University Jena,
on life balance)114
Citation metrics
The ﬁrst step toward citation equity consists of a transparent
disclosure and analysis of citation behavior at the individual author
and collective journal levels. To this end, we advocate for the
inclusion of a citation diversity statement (CDS) at the conclusion of
papers,
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
inclusion
of
funding
acknowledgments or statements of conﬂicts of interest. The CDS
is a simple acknowledgment of the importance of citation diversity
and a self-reporting of the gender-breakdown of a paper’s
citations115. It effectively places each paper in the gendered
context of the knowledge base on which it relies, and serves as a
tool through which authors and readers can examine their own
citation practices. A number of journals have embraced the CDS,
including the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience70 and all journals
published by the Biomedical Engineering Society116. Editors at the
Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience reported a clear reduction of
gender imbalances in citations in the year following the journal’s
embrace of the CDS117. For readers interested in calculating and
reporting their own citation statistics, several publicly available tools
exist that are both journal-speciﬁc70 and journal-general118.
FINAL REMARKS
Gender equity is a nuanced and complex topic, with enough aspects
to ﬁll several graduate theses. We don’t set out to be exhaustive on
this topic, but to provide summaries and resources for those seeking
them within the ﬁeld of computational materials research. For the
interested reader, we suggest similar perspectives from the ﬁeld of
Neuroscience9,119, or the comprehensive reports of the American
Association of University Women19 and the Workshop on Gender
Equity in Materials Science and Engineering12.
We also note that this perspective is but one (incomplete) lens
through which to view broader issues of bias and discrimination
within STEM. Left out of this conversation are scientists with
intersecting marginalized identities. Trans and non-binary scien-
tists, for example, face unique challenges not fully covered by our
discussion. We look forward to future work that will foreground
these communities and push academia toward an ever-more
equitable landscape.
CITATION DIVERSITY STATEMENT
In writing this paper, we sought to proactively consider choosing
references that reﬂect the diversity of the ﬁeld in thought, form of
contribution, gender, and other factors. We use databases that
store the probability of a name being carried by people of
different genders to mitigate our own citation bias at the
intersection of name and identity. Based on the databases used,
the set of names assigned the “woman” label will contain a
predominance of women and the set of names assigned the
“man” label will contain a predominance of men, but both sets
may also contain other genders. By this measure (supplemented
by manual research of some individual authors and excluding self-
citations to the ﬁrst and last authors of our current paper, and
papers whose authors’ ﬁrst names could not be determined), our
references contain 46.1% woman(ﬁrst author)/woman(last author),
15.7% man/woman, 24.5% woman/man, and 13.7% man/man
categorization. This method is limited in that names, pronouns,
and social media proﬁles used to construct the databases may not,
in every case, be indicative of gender identity. Furthermore,
probabilistic studies of names cannot be used to detect citation
costs that are speciﬁc to intersex, non-binary, or transgender
people who are out to a large number of their colleagues. We look
forward to future work that could help us to better understand
how to support equitable practices in science.
