To develop high-quality AI models, we employ a range of programming 
languages, including Python, C++, Java, and others. We utilize popular libraries 
and frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn, and OpenCV. These 
tools allow us to create and train AI models, perform tasks such as deep learning, 
machine learning, computer vision, and more.
Blockchain technology plays a vital role in our project, as we aim to create 
decentralized AI models that can run on the blockchain and be utilized in 
different applications. We leverage blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, 
Polkadot, Solana, and others to develop decentralized applications and smart 
contracts that regulate the operation of our AI models.
By utilizing DAO contracts, we empower network participants to make decisions 
regarding AI model development and usage, as well as the fair distribution of 
rewards among participants. Furthermore, we explore the application of 
machine learning technology to improve the functioning of blockchain networks 
and enhance the efﬁciency of decentralized applications.
To promote collaboration and community involvement, we embrace an open 
approach and leverage AGPL licenses, allowing the wider community to 
contribute to the development and improvement of our AI models. We believe

Gyber Experiment
The Macroeconomic Dao
The realization of an idea is only a matter of its relevance
The Gyber Experiment is an initiative that combines cryptography, computer 
science, sociology, and economics to create a cyber-social corporation. It aims to 
establish a mechanism for direct socio-economic interaction among 
participants, allowing the concentration of public and ﬁnancial resources to 
realize ambitious global projects and manage them effectively. The experiment 
revolves around the Gyber Social Platform, which is a social network owned and 
managed by the users themselves through a decentralized autonomous 
organization (DAO).
The Gyber Social Platform provides basic social networking functionalities such 
as text and voice chats, ﬁle sharing, and video hosting. The platform emphasizes 
data security and offers multiple levels of data protection, including encryption 
options on the client side or server-side encryption using the client's public key. 
The platform stores voluminous data on the IPFS network, with additional 
content pinning provided by nodes deployed within the experiment.
The architecture of the platform is designed to be open and scalable, with 
various input and output points for data and multiple cores. Each user can 
contribute their own code module or feature, which can be included in a node 
and distributed among interested parties. The platform encourages community 
scalability, allowing anyone to add to it and enabling the community to support 
and distribute speciﬁc add-on modules.
The platform operates on a stack level, with a multilingual cross-platform 
pipeline cluster managed by the experiment participants. Different cores are 
responsible for speciﬁc layers of processes, and the development of these cores is 
carried out in various programming languages such as Java, Dart, Go, and C++. 
The platform undergoes parallel development of modules and cores to 
determine the most effective stack for different tasks and ensure ﬂexibility in 
long-term architecture development.
To govern the experiment, secure smart contracts based on Solidity language 
and the OpenZeppelin library are implemented. These contracts include 
management tokens and utility tokens for decision-making and platform 
interaction. The contracts' source code is available on GitHub, and important 
decisions within the experiment are made through proposal and voting 

mechanisms of the DAO contract. Transparency and security are ensured 
through blockchain technology.
Tokenomics play a crucial role in the Gyber Experiment. Two types of tokens are 
utilized: Gyber Token, a utility token required for platform interaction, and Gyber 
Community Token, a governance token used for managing the experiment and 
making collective decisions. The distribution of tokens is allocated among 
different categories of holders, including developers, experiment participants, 
large investors and funds, and the public market. A reserve fund is also created to 
optimize the deployment processes of the experiment.
The experiment follows a set of project phases, starting with idea proposal and 
discussion, moving to accumulation of funds, project implementation, and ﬁnally 
functioning. Projects can have external clients who use ﬁat currency, special 
clients who enjoy discounts with Gyber tokens, and super clients who receive 
even greater discounts with speciﬁc project's internal tokens. Staking Gyber 
tokens or internal project tokens allows participants to earn reputation and 
passive income within the experiment.
The internal organization of the community is based on personal and public 
interests of the participants. Implementers are responsible for project 
management and ensuring its functioning, and decisions are made through 
voting by implementers. Implementers have personal and community 
responsibilities, and unethical behavior may lead to exclusion from the 
experiment. Interaction among participants occurs through discussion and 
private groups, with each project having its dedicated group. The experiment 
also incorporates different types of DAOs, including social DAOs, code DAOs, 
commercial DAOs, and economic DAOs, to facilitate decision-making and project 
implementation.
Overall, the Gyber Experiment aims to create a decentralized and 
community-driven platform that enables effective socio-economic interaction, 
project implementation, and decision-making. It leverages cryptography, 
computer science, and blockchain technology to ensure data security, 
transparency, and scalability.

About cyber society
This is a document that has one purpose - to deﬁne the main features of a 
cybersocial society.
The time when approximately half of the planet carries in their pockets 
computing devices, the power of which, by several orders of magnitude, exceeds 
the power of all computing technology of the past century combined; It's hard 
not to call the era of supercomputers. But since any machine or computer is 
always just an extension of a person, it would be more accurate to call this time 
the era of super communication.
The exclusive goal and opportunity of the society is the most effective association 
of its participants in the interests of the society itself. The development process of 
the Human social mechanism deﬁnes itself as a continuous development of 
relations between people, and this development, due to the scale of the 
participants in the global society, is an inﬁnitely diverse development.
The information age has accelerated the processes of this development to 
literally cosmic speeds. And the main reason for this is that information 
technologies, mechanisms and systems are easily integrated into relations 
between members of society, accelerating, complicating and expanding these 
relations, thereby contributing to their development. Thus, with the development 
of information technology systems, we are seeing an acceleration in the blurring, 
ﬁrst of all, of geographical, social and cultural boundaries in the global civilization, 
which in the future entails the erasure of ﬁnancial and economic boundaries.
The methods of the past, failing today, turn out to be barbaric, requiring constant 
sacriﬁce on the part of society and the planet as a whole.
The technological power of human civilization has long required sustainable and 
reasonable management of human wealth, resources and potential, and none of 
the existing socio-economic formations is able to cope with this task.
We may not survive global economic and social upheavals and we need a 

full-ﬂedged, reasonable association on a planetary scale, at the same time we are 
in great danger of a global uniﬁcation of the economy in the interests of only a 
certain part of society, provided that its (society) social division increases, which 
will entail followed by the continuation of the observed cycle, crises and 
upheavals, inextricably linked with the socio-economic situation of recent history.
Structure and ethics of existing computer, network systems and opportunities 
for the development of global civilization.
The rapid development of technology, and especially electronics and computer 
science, already today determines the main vector of problems related to 
information, its safe storage and exchange.
In our time, information has long been a valuable resource that is constantly 
generated and moved across countless kilometers of network space. In everyday 
life, we all use information technology, and even those of us who are not directly 
related to computer science and electronics are personally involved in the 
process of generating a huge amount of data, which is all sorts of valuable 
information that is easily used for all sorts of manipulations and just as easily 
monetized. .
The value of data, and therefore the value of control over its storage and 
movement, is increasingly seen as a well-known fact, at a time when hackers do 
not cease revealing vulnerabilities in even the most important and seemingly 
invulnerable systems, thereby showing that the security of even the most 
valuable data more wishful thinking than actual.
Blockchain partially solves this problem now, and as the industry develops and 
penetrates into the depths of the real sector of the economy, the absolute 
solution to the problem of data security will approach.
In addition to data leakage as a result of the activities of hackers and errors 
associated with the imperfection of equipment and code, we are dealing with a 
signiﬁcantly different leakage;  from quite reliable in terms of information 
security closed, corporate, information, social media environments of various 
kinds (social networks, instant messengers, navigators, various electronic services, 
etc.).

Most large IT companies consider user accounts as corporate property, and the 
huge data constantly generated by users as a full-ﬂedged product of the 
company. And from a technical point of view, this is true, due to the fact that the 
accounts created by users are formed and stored on the companies' own servers. 
Probably 99% of the Internet content known to the broad masses is stored on 
closed proprietary servers that are physically protected no worse (or rather even 
better) than the most protected military facilities, and of course this is all 
maintained at the expense of network users.
The fundamental, technical concept of the Internet is simple - it is a set of 
computers connected by a network. In reality, the Internet is people who send 
physical signals to each other through a computer network, which the computer 
converts for us into information of the type we need.
Of course, not all computers on the network are real users, but without people, 
the Internet would not be alive, it is obvious that it is not conceivable without 
society, because this is the living result of the activity of society, at a real moment 
in time, which cannot exist without it.
From an ethical point of view, data created by users is at least their personal 
intellectual property and personal data, and the appropriation of these data by 
obsolete economic institutions, due to temporary technical circumstances, is a 
glaring fact, signaling the backwardness of the humanitarian development of 
modern society from the development of its technical .
Adding here the fact that 99% of the Internet runs on open (free) software 
products and is fundamentally on open Linux servers, the absurdity of the 
capture of the Internet space by obsolete economic institutions becomes 
obvious.
Trade in user data in our time is already a well-established, ordinary and 
completely legal phenomenon. Companies are developing long user 
agreements (which are still almost never read) in which they take various kinds of 
consent from users, such as for the processing of their personal data, which gives 
them the legal right to appropriate the data of millions of users around the world, 
analyze it and trade them.
And the multi-million community of real users remains excluded from managing 
and controlling their own data, which in the long term leads to the 
decomposition of the fundamental principles of freedom of personal 

information, security and control of personal data, freedom of society, and in 
every possible way slows down and oppresses the process of historical 
socio-economic development of society.
Obviously, from the point of view of ethics, the user is the sole owner of all rights 
to the content he generates, including meta data and any other types of data 
that he produces, not to mention the inviolability of personal correspondence, 
interest shown on the network and other things.
Of course, many technical products that use user data provide convenient, useful 
and interesting functions for users, but it is obvious that all of them should be 
enabled and disabled at will, and the mechanism of their action should be 
transparent, ensure user data security and control, and this should be conﬁrmed 
by open source product.
Also a very important point is the individual ﬂexibility and variability of services. 
The user must have full control over the part of the overall system that he 
personally uses, and the possibilities of changes made by the user must be 
unlimited within his personal part of the system. The individual possibilities of 
expanding the system must also be unlimited, the system must be expandable 
in all directions.
The main problem of the Internet is that the means of manipulating data of 
various kinds, necessary for society for convenient and effective interaction, are 
mainly centralized and belong to traditional, closed, hierarchical, corporate 
structures. And this problem is more humanitarian than technical due to the fact 
that society ﬁrst needs to deeply comprehend important socio-economic 
phenomena, of course including a technical one, but from the point of view of 
philosophy, ethics, history, sociology and economics, in order to form a fairly 
holistic humanitarian a system that meets modern requirements, capable of 
becoming the basis for the technical implementation of open, decentralized, 
information, socio-economic systems belonging to all users.
The development of a humanitarian theory describing the mechanism of the 
global Human organism (society) as an integral socio-economic system will set 
the movement to identify new directions for the formation and development of 
new, applied, areas of economic science.
 
As information technologies develop and penetrate deeper into the global 
socio-economic environment, their role becomes more and more important, and 

competition in the development and design of information products is growing.
There are attempts on the part of fairly powerful, already fully formed global 
corporate structures to monopolize the global software development market, 
but the individual characteristics of the IT ﬁeld, such as general accessibility, 
breadth and depth, speed of development and evolution, make this almost 
impossible, unlike other sectors of the economy.
The history of software development as an independently developing applied 
area, although not so great, however, the development of this area has already 
passed a certain, not a small path of evolutionary transformation.
 
Computer science began its development as a closed area of  technology, 
accessible only to corporations and governments. Computers were costly, bulky 
machines available mainly from large technical institutions  and corporations.
We can roughly deﬁne this stage as the initial stage, followed by the stage of 
accelerating the development of information technology; it can be deﬁned as 
the time when the computer becomes available to a larger number of 
developers. At this time, competition in the ﬁeld of software development 
expanded and two main competing currents in the world of software 
development were identiﬁed.
 
This is followed by a certain stage of formation of these two approaches and 
balancing their impact on the overall course of the global evolution of software 
and related socio-economic transformations.
As a result of overcoming these abstract stages of development, we are seeing 
an unprecedented surge in activity in the ﬁeld of OPEN SOURCE development, 
improving the quality and usability of open source software products and 
expanding their scope and a signiﬁcant increase in the number of users.
 
 
OPEN SOURCE is increasingly contributing to the emergence of revolutionary 
technologies. We can even observe a whole round of evolution of global 
socio-economic relations directly connected and fed by the global OPEN 
SOURCE community and its ideas, the general vector of which is the open 
comprehensive development of software and society as a whole.

Another of the main, modern problems that are looming over societies is the 
growth of centralized control over the dissemination of ideas that are relevant to 
society.
Outdated economic institutions, due to their hopeless but rather powerful 
position, tend to quickly improve their own mechanisms for controlling and 
monitoring society in order to identify relevant, advanced, socially signiﬁcant 
ideas and projects and counteract their activity before they spread in society.
Together with the fact that the vast majority of large, resource-intensive projects 
are initiated and ﬁnanced by the same obsolete socio-economic institutions, we 
basically have a world that reﬂects exclusively the interests of these obsolete 
institutions and is extremely reactionary to any kind of revolutionary, 
fundamental changes, and therefore to the development of society generally.
At the same time, and partly as a result of this, we see the active development of 
decentralized technologies, which has already formed into a powerful, global 
distributed socio-economic movement that has already united quite a wide and 
educated masses of people.
In fact, we are witnessing the process of the formation of a new type of global 
creative intelligentsia, capable of combining their ideas and interests with other 
social forces into a single ideology fully aimed at the universal good and  
development, to become the basis for the ﬁnal formation of a new, advanced  
creative class, able to ﬁnally step over to long overdue, global, socio-economic 
changes that meet sufﬁciently the modern requirements of global Civilization.
Today a new, global public consciousness is being formed - the main organ of 
social self-government of Mankind. 
Although the era of “kings” with all its characteristic, rigidly centralized and 
hindering the education and development of society, science and technology, 
control mechanisms has long since passed, and today we see the rapid 
ﬂourishing of culture, education, science and technology, in the historical sense, 
and the penetration them (due to the historically consistent social 
transformations that have already taken place) to almost all sectors of society, the 
process of decentralization of global mechanisms of economic interaction is still 
far from its ﬁnal stage.

Decentralization of information technology is a process that has been 
harmoniously developing in the depths of the Internet community for a long 
time, periodically making itself felt by the emergence of powerful decentralized 
technological mechanisms that solve certain problems of society, such as 
BitTorrent, IRC, Bitcoin, i2P, FileCoin, IPFS and others. The ﬁght against such 
decentralized technologies is practically useless and, at best, leads to a 
temporary difﬁculty in the operation of services, which subsequently leads to 
their modernization and stabilization of work, that is, contributes to their 
development.
Decentralization solves many of the existing problems of information security 
and ethics today, and in the future it is able to transform the vast majority of IT 
services into neutral, open, owned by all users, decentralized systems, which in 
turn will allow transforming the most complex global  macro economic 
processes into self-governing cyber-social economic systems directly controlled 
by society.
Of course, many technical products that use user data today provide users with 
convenient, useful and interesting functions, but it is obvious that they must be 
user-controlled, and their mechanism of action must be transparent, ensure the 
safety of user data, and this must be conﬁrmed by the open source of the 
product. .
A very important point is the ﬂexibility and changeability of services. The user 
must have full control over the part of the overall system that he personally uses, 
and the possibilities for changes made by the user must be unlimited, at least 
within his personal part of the system. The possibilities of expanding the system 
must also be unlimited, the system must expand in all directions. 
There are many such fundamental qualities of a software product, many of which 
are deﬁned in the GPL and other similar documents. However, much work is 
required to identify and systematize the features of a cybersocial corporation in 
order to apply the free principle to the global economic process.
The ideas about free software, as they develop and become technologies widely 
used in the real sector of the economy, brought to the world ideas about free 
ﬁnance, which, as technologies develop and spread, open the way for new ideas 
of a free economy.

Development of public systems for managing economic processes.
The evolution of global socio-economic processes consists in the gradual 
transformation of management methods from political hegemony towards 
economic hegemony, from which, in turn, the movement goes towards 
technological hegemony. This movement is not determined by any form, it can 
be several forms of movement of socio-economic processes.
The relation of these forms to each other determines the existing directions of 
these forms. For example, it can be the withering away of political hegemony in 
favor of strengthening economic hegemony, that is, it can represent a kind of 
hereditary transfer of the functions of managing global socio-economic 
processes from a separate hegemon of the monarch to a more decentralized 
dictate of the parliament, representing the interests of broader economic forces 
in the social sense.
Or the combination of economic methods of management with technological 
ones, which naturally gives rise to and strengthens ﬁnancial hegemony. There 
may also be other forms of interaction of global socio-economic processes.
Combinations of these various forms of socio-economic interaction can give rise 
to new sustainable forms, which inevitably stimulates the emergence of new 
types of global socio-economic systems that are increasingly decentralized, 
self-governing, resistant to crises and ensuring stable, progressive development 
of the global economy, ﬁnance, culture and social environment.
Obviously, the desire of the global socio-economic mechanism in its historical 
development to come to the most distributed peer-to-peer form, controlled by 
means of cyber-social ﬁnancial mechanisms that affect the global 
socio-economic resource, that is, a mechanism located in the hands of the public 
and controlled directly by the public.
 
With the development of information technologies and as they penetrate into 
the real sector of the ﬁnancial and economic space, society acquires an 
increasing number of levers of signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the direction of global 
economic development.
Technologically, the global economy is on the verge of large-scale 
transformations associated with the transition of society to a new level of 
socio-economic interaction directly using innovative decentralized cyber-social 

economic mechanisms.
 
With the advent of Blockchain technology, the possibility of building 
decentralized ﬁnancial systems has opened up, and their development really 
contributes to the emergence of opportunities for building global self-governing 
cyber-social economic structures that expand the possibilities of intellectual 
inﬂuence of society on the global economic process.
The recurring crisis phenomena of the modern global economy clearly signal the 
absence of a sufﬁciently decentralized tool for really reasonable management of 
such a complex system as a global socio-economic mechanism.
And with each larger crisis, the social organism of mankind is increasingly forced 
to create an instrument capable of stabilizing global economic processes and 
managing them in order to progressively develop society and increase social 
economic wealth.
 
Whatever happens in the world and no matter how powerful human forces 
inﬂuence the course of history, the organism of society invariably produces a 
cycle of evolutionary transformation - adaptable change. It becomes more 
perfect and this process takes place, ﬁrst of all, not in the stands of debates, 
ﬁnancial and economic congresses and other hypocritical places, but in the 
minds of people, from the beginning in isolated cases, then gaining momentum, 
becomes stronger in society and developing in a spiral.
And of course, all this development is accompanied and approved by the 
emergence of revolutionary, fundamental, philosophical, legal and technical 
documents and products, which are various moments of a single dialectic of the 
development of global socio-economic relations, systematizing and developing it 
to the limit required for the transition to a new stage of development.
We live in the era of cybersocialization of the economy - the transition of society 
to a new, conscious level of global interaction, management and development. 
This neologism quite accurately deﬁnes the possibilities of reorganization and 
transformation of society into a global, highly efﬁcient, thinking socio-economic 
structure endowed with a collective mind, open to us today.

GyberExperiment is an experiment in the ﬁeld of cryptography, computer 
science, sociology and economics to create a Cyber-social corporation - a new 
form of socio-economic interaction - a new form of economic unit.
GyberComputer is a private distributed computing network of the community, 
where the necessary functionality for the activities of the participants of the 
experiment will be deployed.
Gybernet is a secure community blockchain used by the platform to ensure the 
security and transparency of the experiment.
GyberToken of the GYBER community, necessary for interaction with the 
GyberNet Blockchain and the distributed GyberComputer supercomputer. To get 
GYBER, the burning of the main GBR token is necessary.
GyberCommunityToken GBR is a platform management token, the main 
decision-making tool within the experiment. It is also used by the community as 
a means of evaluating work on projects within the experiment. To participate in 
the management, the wallet of the management token holder must be active, 
the activity of wallets is checked by a special algorithm when allowed to vote and 
sign the proposal.
MacroeconomicDao is a transparent system of interaction and decision-making 
based on Blockchain and proven smart contracts in the Solidity language.
Objectives of the Experiment
To create a mechanism of direct socio-economic interaction belonging to all 
participants, allowing to concentrate public and ﬁnancial resources for the 
implementation and management of even the most ambitious, global projects. 
In fact, this is the implementation of a new form of economic unit, necessary to 
create a new form of global socio-economic space.
Using the economic potential of the implemented projects for more effective 
implementation of the following projects.
Main community projects
Gyber Social Platform
To meet the communication needs of the experiment at the start stage, ﬁrst of 
all, the main functionality of the Gyber Social Platform will be implemented - a 
social network owned by all users, managed by them through the DAO and 
expandable using the GitHub repository.
From the user's point of view, the starting model of the platform has the basic 
functions of a social network, such as text and voice chats, hosting and sharing 
videos and other types of ﬁles.
All the functions presented on the platform are implemented in accordance with 
the ethics and philosophy of the Gybernaty community, which guarantees users 

the security and control of data, leaving the possibility of full encryption of the 
account on the client side or encryption on the server using the client's public 
key.
In addition to the main functions, the platform provides an opportunity for the 
user to create projects for implementation as part of an experiment, becoming 
its implementer.
The user can offer a ready-made project or just an idea and, together with the 
community, develop it into a real project.
About the data
When designing and implementing the social platform, ﬁrst of all, emphasis was 
placed on data security and conﬁdentiality of their storage. There are several 
levels of data protection to choose from on the platform at the start-up 
architecture stage.
The data is processed by a special algorithm that allows you to use encryption at 
different levels and provide an almost absolute level of security for the client.
The platform stores all the bulk data in the IPFS network, in which nodes for 
additional content creation are deployed as part of the experiment.
Architecture
The platform is designed as an open scalable structure with different data input 
and output points with multiple cores. Each user will be able to write their own 
code module (which can be included in the node and offered to those who wish) 
or design a new feature so that it can be implemented in real production.
The code structure is managed through git hub repositories managed by the 
community. Everyone can create their own module and distribute it to everyone.
Distribution
The modular architecture we are creating is a network of nodes with a set of 
microservice containers. Each node can be supplemented with any existing 
modules, or any required modules can be written and embedded in the 
assembly of a speciﬁc node.
The platform practically does not store data on its servers. All massive user data is 
uploaded to the IPFS network in open or encrypted form, and the user has 
several levels of protection when encrypting their ﬁles. To maintain access to 
unpopular ﬁles on the IPFS network, the platform provides a pinning service, 
which is a network of IPFS nodes running in containers on the main nodes of the 
Gybernet network.
The network also has a virtual machine that combines the power of all currently 

operating nodes.
Encryption
The platform provides three levels of user data protection, but even the weakest 
level of protection provides optimal protection.
User data can be fully encrypted on the client side, providing 100% control over 
the data for the user.
Only some data is encrypted on the client side, and the rest is transmitted to the 
server for encryption with the key speciﬁed by the user.
Automatic mode conﬁgures the data protection algorithm by default.
The platform is built in such a way that users can control their data and have 
conﬁdential access to it.
Also, the main principle of the platform is community extensibility, since this is an 
open source platform. Everyone can supplement it, and the community can 
support one or another module of the supplement and distribute it over the 
Gybernet network.
Stack
At the stack level, the network is a multilingual cross-platform containerized 
cluster managed by a community of experiment participants.
Each node consists of isolated cores communicating with each other, 
distributing the work received from the users of the Gyber Social Platform. Each 
of the cores is responsible for its own layer of processes. Initially, the development 
of the core core module is conducted in the Rust language. Each core has its 
own auxiliary infrastructure, which is also run in isolation on separate containers. 
As part of the experiment, parallel development of modules and cores is used to 
determine the best stack for solving certain tasks and ensuring maximum 
ﬂexibility in the development of the platform architecture in the long term. 
Modules for the platform can be written by anyone and in any way, but to be 
included in the node and connected to the network, it must be checked by a 
special test algorithm that will check its compatibility with the network and 
whether it has the necessary functionality to ensure the operation of the node. 
There is also an aspect of trust in a particular node, based on the activity and 
connections of its owner within the experiment. The community should trust 
every node. We call it Proof of Community. The management of the production 
versions of the platform and the current state of the program code takes place 
through the github repository and is controlled by the developer community.

AiC (large-scale study of the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial experiment)
A large-scale study of artiﬁcial intelligence, organized by the Gybernaty 
community, which aims to create an open community for the development and 
use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) models in the blockchain environment. Our 
project uses the capabilities of DAO contracts to regulate the operation of these 
models, ensuring transparency and openness in their development and use.
The problem we are solving is the high cost and complexity associated with the 
development and use of artiﬁcial intelligence models, as well as problems related 
to privacy and security when using these models in various ﬁelds. AiC offers a 
solution by creating an open community, whose members can jointly create and 
use artiﬁcial intelligence models in a blockchain environment. The use of DAO 
contracts ensures transparency, openness and regulation of artiﬁcial intelligence 
models.
The advantages of AiC are the ability of participants to share knowledge and 
experience by creating and using artiﬁcial intelligence models in a blockchain 
environment with minimal costs. In addition, the use of DAO contracts increases 
security and transparency throughout the entire process.
AiC can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, allowing 
you to create artiﬁcial intelligence models in various ﬁelds, such as medicine, 
ﬁnance, transport and much more.
To develop high-quality artiﬁcial intelligence models, we use a number of 
programming languages, including Python, C++, Java and others. We use 
popular libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn 
and OpenCV. These tools allow us to create and train artiﬁcial intelligence 
models, perform tasks such as deep learning, machine learning, computer vision 
and much more.
Blockchain technology plays a vital role in our project, as we strive to create 
decentralized artiﬁcial intelligence models that can run on the blockchain and 
be used in various applications. We use blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, 
Polkadot, Solana and others to develop decentralized applications and smart 
contracts that regulate the operation of our artiﬁcial intelligence models.
Using DAO contracts, we give network participants the opportunity to make 
decisions regarding the development and use of an artiﬁcial intelligence model, 
as well as the fair distribution of rewards among participants. In addition, we are 
studying the application of machine learning technology to improve the 

functioning of blockchain networks and increase the efﬁciency of decentralized 
applications.
Internal functioning
To move the project into the accumulation phase, it is necessary to burn GBR 
tokens by 0.1% of the required amount for the implementation of the project.
The transition process consists in issuing a limited number of internal tokens of a 
speciﬁc project, for sale at a price of 1 BUSD.
The maximum amount for the implementation of the project is also limited by 
the reputation of the implementer or the general reputation of the 
implementers of one project.
Participants gain a reputation as a result of live activity in the experiment: 
posting and discussing projects, participating in ﬁnancing and implementing 
projects.
Reputation can also be obtained as a result of the Gyber token staking.
There are no restrictions on assets received from the sale of wrapped tokens of 
the project.
Project implementers can freely dispose of assets by following the 
documentation and roadmap of the project.
Assets received from the sale of wrapped tokens are unblocked in parts or 
completely by a simple signature of a single or several implementers of one 
project, which are determined at the time of the project proposal and the release 
of internal tokens of a particular project.
Steaking
Staking is a universal tool within the framework of the project. With its help, you 
can improve the reputation of participants and receive passive income.
As part of the experiment, two staking options are provided:
GyberToken = 0.00000000007% of the total income of all projects in Gyber 
tokens.
Internal project tokens = 10 / [total number of tokens issued by the project] % 
from the income of a speciﬁc project.
The minimum term of staking is 1 year
Organization
The community is built on the basis of the personal and public interests of the 
participants.
Participants are veriﬁed by means of an electronic signature.

The maximum amount for the implementation of the project is also limited by 
the reputation of the implementer or the general reputation of the 
implementers of one project.
All important decisions in projects are made on the basis of the vote of the 
implementers by means of electronic signatures.
Each implementer is an active economic unit, which can represent entire 
companies in the real sector of the economy or even a set of organizations.
Responsibility
Each implementer is responsible to the entire community primarily by his 
reputation and can be excluded from the experiment for unfair treatment.
Also, the implementer bears internal personal responsibility to other 
implementers of a particular project.
The roles and tasks of the implementers within the projects are determined by 
the implementers themselves, but the common task of all implementers is the 
organization of the project and ensuring its functioning
Assets received from the sale of wrapped tokens are unblocked in parts or 
completely by a simple signature of a single or several implementers of one 
project, which are determined at the time of the project proposal and the release 
of internal tokens of a particular project.
The order of interaction of participants
A discussion group is created for each project, where everyone can get in. 
Further, private groups with a speciﬁc description can be created within the 
general group to discuss the project, in which participants are allowed by the 
implementers.
Private groups
The main form of organizing any work on a project within the framework of an 
experiment. They are used for discussion and concrete work on the 
implementation of the project in the circle necessary for a speciﬁc task.
The circle of participants in a particular private group is strictly limited to the 
participants required to solve a speciﬁc task.
Private groups can also be created inside already existing private groups, which 
provides a more subtle interaction within a speciﬁc topic.

The Macroeconomic Dao
Ecosystem
Each Dao in the ecosystem involves the implementation of a speciﬁc project, 
enterprise, event, decision-making or any other public action proposed by the 
community of experiment participants and developers.
Social DAOs are used for making decisions within the community and organizing 
any social events within the community. They do not concern either business 
ideas or external public projects. It can be just a vote for some proposal, or a 
collection of resources (public and material) for some internal event or a charity 
gathering.
The current state of the code of the entire platform is supported by the state of 
the main branch of the repository on GitHub, in order to make changes to which 
it is required to pass a Code DAO vote. In this way, decentralized management of 
the global code structure is carried out.All members of the developer community 
can be Code Dao initiators.
Commerce DAO is a simple implementation of the concept of crowdinvesting, 
where entrepreneurs and enthusiasts can offer a business idea or a real business 
plan for implementation at the expense of investors, in turn, investors get the 
opportunity to consume the products of the implemented project on exclusive 
terms and the opportunity to receive a share of the proﬁts of the implemented 
project.
Economic DAO is a completely new concept of organizing public ﬁnancing, 
project management and socio-economic interaction, which allows 
accumulating social, ﬁnancial and economic resources for the most effective 
implementation of any relevant public projects and ideas.
Practical logic of organization and self-management of users
At the ﬁrst level, the system is a peer-to-peer structure consisting of all users of 
the community who have equal privileges and own equal parts of a common 
active resource representing the aggregate, creative and economic potential of 
the community.
The main application function of the community is effective interaction with the 
aim of realizing the interests, ideas and projects of all users, increasing the overall 
active resource of the community, developing the community and users.

Using the functionality of the extensible creative platform Gyber Social, users can 
safely communicate, share relevant information, propose ideas and projects for 
implementation and work collectively on all stages of project implementation 
and management. The platform includes all the necessary functionality for news 
exchange, communication and teamwork on projects, and its architecture is built 
in such a way that it ensures the security of user data and the ability to control 
them directly from users and is comprehensively and easily expanded by users 
directly or through collective interaction.
The main method of user interaction is shared spaces: news, messages, ideas and 
projects, which are shared thematic folders in which each user can create folders 
with content, thereby sharing news, messages, ideas and projects with the 
community.
News, messages, discussions of ideas and projects added by users to shared 
spaces represent the main content, which, in turn, can form its own internal 
directory tree, access rights to which are determined by the administrators of the 
main content.
Internal catalogs of the main content are directly related to the subject of the 
main content and constitute its internal interactive user interaction environment.
When the main content is added to any of the ﬁelds, a child directory is created 
in the root of a speciﬁc common ﬁeld, and the author becomes its director (main 
implementer) and can assign administrators (additional implementers), groups, 
access rights to it and change them. Also, each child directory in a speciﬁc ﬁeld 
must have some mandatory attributes and some additional ones. These 
attributes are determined based on the thematic features of each of the 
common ﬁelds.
The concept of socio-economic selection
Basic concepts:
A new kind of ﬁnancial community is a peer–to-peer community of people 
organized for effective interaction in order to implement ideas and projects of 
interest to them, at the expense of the collective capital of participants, 
promotion and management of them, by means of advanced information 
technologies and ﬁnancial mechanisms.

The social and investment circle is an unlimited number of members of a new 
type of ﬁnancial community interested in the implementation of a speciﬁc idea 
and project.
The active group (the core of the provision) is the optimal number of participants 
from among the social and investment circle who want to actively participate in 
the implementation of a speciﬁc idea and project.
A professional coordination group is an auxiliary administrative resource of a new 
type of ﬁnancial community, hired for a fee from professionals, which may 
consist of both community members and non–community members. The main 
task is professional assistance, ensuring the project activities of active groups.
Social relevance is a project parameter directly determined by the sufﬁciency of 
the number of participants in the social and investment circle for the 
implementation of the project at the expense of the collective capital of 
participants on the principle of minimum individual participation.
The threshold of social relevance is the ratio of the cost of implementing a 
project and the number of participants in the social and investment circle 
sufﬁcient for its implementation at the expense of the collective capital of 
participants on the principle of minimum individual participation in ﬁnancing.
The collective capital (of the participants) is the total investment ability of the 
participants interested in the implementation of a particular project.
The principle of minimum individual participation (in ﬁnancing)
is a principle in which the full cost of the project is distributed equally to all 
participants in ﬁnancing, and the amount of individual participation in ﬁnancing 
is determined by the minimum possible size, that is, it decreases as the number 
of participants increases until the threshold of the relevance of the project is 
passed.
Interaction Properties of User spaces The main functional workspace of the 
expandable creative platform is the project space. It forms projects from the 
ideas of the community, offers interesting projects for implementation, discusses 
projects, and direct intellectual work on the implementation and management 
of projects. The main concept of the project ﬁeld is the 
idea-project-implementation model, a pipeline that accepts relevant ideas for 
collective implementation at the entrance, forms concrete, ready-to-implement 

projects based on them and implements them at the expense of an actual 
community resource, which is formed by the ratio of the total active community 
resource and the number of users interested in implementing a speciﬁc project. 
After the initial formation of the project, it is discussed and as interest in the 
project grows from the community, the Director determines the active project 
group, which will be engaged mainly in the intellectual management of the 
project. Project ﬁnancing is based on the principle of minimal individual 
participation, which is described in detail in the community concept sheet. The 
main content in the general project space is a social and investment circle 
consisting of users interested in the implementation of a speciﬁc project. The 
circle may consist of users with different attitudes to the project, for example, an 
active group, a passive group, which in turn, if necessary, may have their own 
internal gradations. The ﬁnal structure of the circle is individual and comes from 
the internal qualities of the project and the external conditions of 
implementation. The main distinguishing quality of the social and investment 
circle, after the ﬁnal formation of a speciﬁc project, is the unconditional unity of 
its participants. The circle includes and consists exclusively of those users who are 
interested in implementing a speciﬁc project. If internal contradictions arise 
among the participants of the social and investment circle, a separate discussion 
is held in a special directory within the circle, where the main contradictions are 
identiﬁed in order to form a uniﬁed solution for the implementation of the 
project that meets the interests of the overwhelming majority of participants. If 
this is not possible, the project can always be divided into several independent 
ones and identify the most relevant one for implementation on the principle of 
minimum individual participation in ﬁnancing.
