THE (ANTI-)HOLOMORPHIC SECTOR IN
C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY, AND THE
WITTEN CLASS
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
Abstract. Atiyah’s classical work on circular symmetry and sta-
tionary phase shows how the ˆA-genus is obtained by formally apply-
ing the equivariant cohomology localization formula to the loop space
of a simply connected spin manifold. The same technique, applied to
a suitable “antiholomorphic sector” in the C{Λ-equivariant cohomol-
ogy of the conformal double loop space MapspC{Λ, Xq of a rationally
string manifold X produces the Witten genus of X. This can be seen
as an equivariant localization counterpart to Berwick-Evans super-
symmetric localization derivation of the Witten genus.

1. Introduction
In the classic work [Ati85], Atiyah shows how to recover the ˆA-class
of a compact smooth spin1 manifold X via a formal inﬁnite dimensional
version of the Duistermaat-Heckman formula applied to the smooth loop
space MapspT, Xq of maps from a circle to X. Such a formula is a par-
ticular case of the well known localization formula for torus equivariant
Date: January 19, 2023.
1The spin structure on X is needed in order to have an orientation on the free
loop space MapspT, Xq.
For the constructions in the present paper, since we are
not concerned with integration over loop spaces, the weaker assumption that X is
orientable will suﬃce.

cohomology, extensively treated in [AB84]. The appearance of the ˆA-
class in such an inﬁnite dimensional version of localization techniques in
torus equivariant cohomology was pointed out by Atiyah as “a brilliant
observation of the physicist E. Witten” and suggests that, reasoning as
in [Ati85], the Witten class WitpXq [Wit87,Wit88], should emerge from
a localization formula for the torus equivariant cohomology of the double
loop space MapspT2, Xq of maps from a 2-dimensional torus to X. This is
indeed the case, as long as one makes an a priori unjustiﬁed assumption:
that the generators u, v of the T2-equivariant cohomology of a point over
C,
H˚
T2ppt; Cq – Cru, vs,
are not independent but rather satisfy a C-linear dependence condition
of the form
v “ τu
where τ is a point in the complex upper half plane H, see [Lu08]. Al-
though the hypothesis of C-linear dependence of the polynomial variables
u, v may appear somewhat “ad hoc” to make the computations work out,
it suggests that if instead of looking at a topological torus T2 we consider
a complex torus C{Λ then there should exist a version of the localization
theorem for torus equivariant cohomology, where only a holomorphic
variable ξ (or its conjugate ξ) appears, instead of the two real variables
u, v. In this paper we show that such a holomorphic (resp. antiholomor-
phic) sector of the C{Λ-equivariant cohomology can indeed be deﬁned
and that an (anti-)holomorphic localization formula holds. Going back
to what inspired it, in the ﬁnal part of the paper we show how the Witten
class of a compact smooth manifold emerges from the antiholomorphic
localization formula for the C{Λ-equivariant cohomology of the double
loop space MapspC{Λ, Xq. More precisely, the idea is to formally apply
the ﬁnite-dimensional antiholomorphic localization formula obtained in
the ﬁrst part of the paper to the inclusion of X in MapspC{Λ, Xq as
the submanifold of constant maps (that are the ﬁxed points for the C{Λ-
translation action on MapspC{Λ, Xq). It turns out, however, that the
inﬁnite products that would naively deﬁne the equivariant Euler class
for the normal bundle νΛ of X in MapspC{Λ, Xq do not converge, so a
suitable ζ-regularization is needed in order to make sense of these inﬁnite
products. Once this is done, one obtains that if X is a compact rational
string manifold, i.e., if X is a compact manifold with torsion ﬁrst Pon-
tryagin class, then the inverse of the normalized Euler class of νΛ deﬁnes
a modular form with values in the complex cohomology of X, which turns
out to be the Witten class of X. In particular, the integral over X of

C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE WITTEN CLASS

the inverse of the normalized Euler class of νΛ is the Witten genus of X.
From the point of view of C{Λ-equivariant cohomology, the geometric
condition that X needs to be a rationally string manifold will emerge
as the condition ensuring that the ζ-regularization procedure involved
in the inﬁnite rank localization formula is independent of the choice of
arguments for the nonzero elements in the lattice Λ Ă C. This condi-
tion will also imply that the expected modular properties of the inverse
normalized Euler class are not disrupted by the ζ-regularization.
Equivariant cohomology and the Atiyah–Bott localization formula ad-
mit an elegant rephrasing in terms of supergeometry.2 Reversing this
point of view, every diﬀerential geometric construction obtained through
supersymmetric localization techniques in quantum ﬁeld theory should
in principle admit a derivation internal to the setting of equivariant co-
homology.
In this sense, the results of this paper can be seen as an
equivariant localization counterpart to Berwick-Evans supersymmetric
localization derivation of the Witten genus [BE13,BE19], with the Weier-
straß ζ-regularization of equivariant Euler classes playing the role of the
ζ-regularization of inﬁnite dimensional determinants in supersymmetric
quantum ﬁeld theory.

2. 1d Euclidean tori equivariant cohomology
2.1. The Euclidean Cartan complex for circle actions. As a half-
way step towards two dimensional real tori endowed with a complex struc-
ture C{Λ, we start by recalling a few basic constructions in the equi-
variant cohomology for 1-dimensional torus actions, formulating them
for 1-dimensional Euclidean tori R{Λ rather than for the topological 1-
dimensional torus T.
Here Λ Ă R is a lattice in R, i.e.
an additive
subgroup of R isomorphic to Z.
The quotient R{Λ can be thought of as a circle of length ℓ, with ℓthe
minimum strictly positive element of Λ. It has a natural structure of
2This is a classical idea whose origin can be traced back to the foundational works in
supersymmetric ﬁeld theories from the 70s and the 80s. It has then become popular
in the mathematical community through purely mathematical applications such as
Witten’s [Wit82], and has been a main source of inspiration for Atiyah and Bott’s
[AB84], which is in turn one of the main sources for this note. See, e.g., [BT95], [SZ97],
and [PZ17] for modern surveys from the point of view of supersymmetric ﬁeld theories.

real Lie group; we will denote its Lie algebra by tΛ. Next we consider
a compact smooth manifold M with a smooth action of R{Λ, denote by
Ω‚pM; RqR{Λ the R{Λ-invariant part of the de Rham algebra of M, and
endow
Ω‚pM; RqR{Λ bR SymptΛ
_r´2sq
with a bigrading where the component of bidegree pk, lq is Ωk´lpM; RqR{ΛbR
SymlptΛ_r´2sq. This bigraded vector space comes equipped with a struc-
ture of bicomplex where the diﬀerential of degree p1, 0q is the de Rham
diﬀerential (acting trivially on SymptΛ_r´2sq) and the diﬀerential of de-
gree p0, 1q is the operator eΛ_r´2sιveΛ, where peΛ, eΛ_q is a pair consisting
of a linear generator of tΛ and of its dual element in t_
Λ, and veΛ is the
vector ﬁeld on M corresponding to eΛ via the diﬀerential of the action.
The operator ι is the contraction operator. It is immediate to see that
eΛ_r´2sιveΛ is independent of the choice of the generator eΛ.
Deﬁnition 2.1. The Cartan complex of R{Λ œ M is the total complex
of the bicomplex
pΩ‚pM; RqR{Λ bR SymptΛ
_r´2sq; ddR, eΛ
_r´2sιveΛq.
The total diﬀerential in the Cartan complex is denoted by dR{Λ and is
called the equivariant diﬀerential. Elements in the Cartan complex that
are dR{Λ-closed are called equivariantly closed forms.
Remark 2.2. The importance of the Cartan complex resides in the fact its
cohomology is the real R{Λ-equivariant cohomology H‚
R{ΛpM; Rq of M.
So it provides a diﬀerential geometric tool to compute this cohomology.
It is the generalization to the equivariant setting of the de Rham complex
computing real singular cohomology.
Remark 2.3. Evaluation at 0 P t_
Λr´2s is a morphism of complexes from
the Cartan complex to the de Rham complex pΩ‚pM; RqR{Λ, ddRq of R{Λ-
invariant forms. One says that an element eω in the Cartan complex is
an extension of an invariant form ω if eω|0 “ ω.
Remark 2.4. The quotient map R Ñ R{Λ gives a distinguished Lie al-
gebra isomorphism LiepRq
„ÝÑ tΛ. By means of this isomorphism, the
Cartan bicomplex is isomorphic to
pΩ‚pM; RqR{Λrus; ddR, uιvd{dxq
where d{dx is the standard basis vector in LiepRq and u is a degree 2
formal variable corresponding to the dual 1-form dx placed in degree 2.
Notice that with respect to the bigrading, the variable u has bidegree
p1, 1q.

Remark 2.5. With the usual bigrading on the Cartan complex, i.e., with
ΩkpM; RqR{Λ bR SymlptΛ_r´2sq in bidegree pk, 2lq, the diﬀerentials ddR
and eΛ_r´2sιveΛ have bidegree p1, 0q and p´1, 2q, respectively. We made
a linear change in the grading so that they have bidegree p1, 0q and p0, 1q,
respectively.
2.2. R{Λ-equivariant characteristic classes. Equivariant vector bun-
dles over an R{Λ-manifold come with a natural notion of equivariant char-
acteristic classes. When the action on the manifold is trivial3, equivariant
characteristic classes admit a simple combinatorial/representation theo-
retic description that we recall below.
Remark 2.6. A typical situation where one meets equivariant vector bun-
dles on a R{Λ-trivial base is by considering equivariant vector bundles
on the R{Λ-ﬁxed point locus FixpMq in an R{Λ-manifold M.
Notice
that, since R{Λ is a compact Lie group, its action on M is automatically
proper and so FixpMq is a smooth submanifold of M. Equivariant vector
bundles on FixpMq need not be restrictions of equivariant vector bun-
dles on M. A classical example is the normal bundle ν for the inclusion
FixpMq ãÑ M.
For ease of exposition, we will tacitly assume FixpMq to be connected:
in the more general situation of a possibly nonconnected ﬁxed point locus
all the constructions we recall in this section are to be repeated for each
of the connected components of FixpMq.
Remark 2.7. For a R{Λ-trivial manifold one has M “ FixpMq, so it is
actually not restrictive to work with submanifolds of the form FixpMq
when one is interested into equivariant vector bundles over R{Λ-trivial
base manifolds.
Remark 2.8. As the R{Λ-action is trivial on FixpMq, the associated Car-
tan bicomplex is
pΩ‚pFixpMq; Rq bR SymptΛ
_r´2sq; ddR, 0q
and so the R{Λ-equivariant cohomology of FixpMq is
H‚
R{ΛpFixpMq; Rq “ H‚pFixpMq; Rq bR SymptΛ
_r´2sq.
The key to the combinatorial description of equivariant complex vec-
tor bundles over R{Λ-trivial base manifolds is the following statement,
which is an immediate consequence of the regularity of the decomposition
into isotypic components of smooth families of complex representations of

compact Lie groups. The statement is well known, see, e.g., [Sin01, Propo-
sition 4.6] where however it is given without a proof. For completeness,
we provide a proof for the particular case we are interested in.
Lemma 2.9. An R{Λ-equivariant complex line bundle on FixpMq is
equivalently the datum of a pair pL, χq, where L is a complex line bundle
on FixpMq and χ: R{Λ Ñ Up1q is a character of R{Λ.
Proof. Let us denote by Lp the ﬁber of L on the point p P M. The datum
of an R{Λ-equivariant complex line bundle L on FixpMq is the datum
of a collection of group homomorphisms R{Λ Ñ AutCpLpq, smoothly de-
pending on p P FixpMq. Since Lp is 1-dimensional, one has a canonical
isomorphism AutCpLpq – C˚, so our datum is the datum of a smooth
family of Lie group homomorphisms χp : R{Λ Ñ C˚. Since R{Λ is com-
pact, these have to factor through Up1q and so they form a smooth family
of characters χp : R{Λ Ñ Up1q. Since Up1q-valued characters of R{Λ are
uniquely deﬁned by their topological degree as smooth maps R{Λ Ñ Up1q
and the topological degree is a homotopy invariant, we have that χp is
constant on connected components of FixpMq. Therefore, if FixpMq is
connected, as we are assuming, we are reduced with the datum of a single
Up1q-valued character χ of R{Λ.
□
By the above Lemma, in what follows we will write an R{Λ-equivariant
complex line bundle over FixpMq as a pair pL, χq.
Deﬁnition 2.10. Let χ: R{Λ Ñ Up1q be a character. The weight of χ
is the linear map
wχ : tΛ Ñ R
deﬁned as follows: 2πiwχ is the Lie algebra homomorphism 2πiwχ : tΛ Ñ
2πiR “ LiepUp1qq associated with the Lie group homomorphism χ, i.e.,
2πiwχ is the linear map making the diagram

commute.
Remark 2.11. Notice that, by deﬁnition, wχ is an element of tΛ_, and so
wχr2s P tΛ_r´2s Ď SymptΛ_r´2sq.
Deﬁnition 2.12. Let pL, χq be an R{Λ-equivariant complex line bundle
over FixpMq. The equivariant ﬁrst Chern class of pL, χq is the element
of H‚pFixpMq; Rq bR SymptΛ_r´2sq given by
c1,R{ΛpL, χq :“ c1pLq ` wχr´2s.

C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE WITTEN CLASS

Remark 2.13. It is convenient to give a more explicit description of
c1,R{ΛpL, χq in terms of the isomorphism
H‚
R{ΛpFixpMq; Rq – H‚pFixpMq; Rqrus
induced by the Lie algebra isomorphism LiepRq
„ÝÑ tΛ. In order to do so,
recall that characters of R{Λ are indexed by the dual lattice Λ_ of Λ and
that via the standard inner product in R this is identiﬁed with Λ: every
character of R{Λ is of the form
χpxq “ ρλpxq :“ expp2πiλvolpR{Λq´2xq,
for some λ P Λ. The associated weight wλ is then wλ “ λvolpR{Λq´2dx so
that wλr´2s “ λvolpR{Λq´2u. The equivariant ﬁrst Chern class of pL, ρλq
is then written as c1,R{ΛpL, ρλq “ c1pLq ` λvolpR{Λq´2u. Introducing the
rescaled formal variable uΛ :“ volpR{Λq´2u, of the same bidegree as u,
this is written
c1,R{ΛpL, ρλq “ c1pLq ` λuΛ.
For a R{Λ-equivariant complex vector bundle E on FixpMq one deﬁnes
the equivariant Chern classes of E by the equivariant splitting principle.
Namely, ﬁrst one decomposes E as the direct sum of its isotypic compo-
nents,
E “
M
χPΛ_
Eχ;
next, one deﬁnes the equivariant Chern roots of each component Eχ via
the splitting principle:
{αi,R{ΛpEχq}i“1,...rkEχ “ {αipEχq ` wχr´2s}i“1,...rkEχ,
where the αipEχq’s are the Chern roots of Eχ. Finally one deﬁnes the
total R{Λ-equivariant Chern class of E by means of these equivariant
Chern roots.
Deﬁnition 2.14. In the same notation as above, the total R{Λ-equivariant
Chern class of E is
cR{ΛpEq :“

Remark 2.15. All through the paper we will denote by rkE the complex
rank of a complex vector bundle and by rkRpEq the real rank of a real
vector bundle (and of the real vector bundle underlying a complex vector
bundle). Notice that for rkEχ “ 0 the product QrkEχ
i“1 is an empty product
and so it is 1 by deﬁnition. That is, only the χ’s with rkEχ ě 1 actually
contribute to the above products.

between Λ_ and Λ, these read

It is convenient to isolate the contribution from the isotypic component
of the trivial character 0 P Λ_, corresponding to the zero weight. We
write

Eχ “ E0 ‘

and call Eeﬀthe eﬀectively acted bundle. By multiplicativity of the total
Chern class and of the top Chern class one ﬁnds
cR{ΛpEq “ cpE0qcR{ΛpEeﬀq;
ctop,R{ΛpEq “ ctoppE0qctop,R{ΛpEeﬀq.
Deﬁnition 2.17. The weight polynomial of Eeﬀis the element in SymptΛ_r´2sq

Remark 2.18. By construction, the weight polynomial wppEeﬀq is a nonzero

By localizing the R{Λ-equivariant cohomology of FixpMq at wppEeﬀq,
i.e., by formally inverting wppEeﬀq one can rewrite the top R{Λ-equivariant
Chern class of Eeﬀas

2.3. Equivariant Euler classes of real vector bundles. Since equi-
variant vector bundles come naturally with a notion of equivariant char-
acteristic classes, real oriented equivariant vector bundles come with a
natural notion of equivariant Euler class. And again, if the equivariant
vector bundle has a base space with trivial R{Λ-action, the combinatorics
behind the computation of an equivariant Euler class is purely represen-
tation theoretic.
Real irreducible representations of R{Λ are indexed by the quotient
set Λ_{˘. The unique ﬁxed point 0 corresponds to the trivial represen-
tation, which is the unique 1-dimensional real representation of R{Λ; the
equivalence class rχs of the complex character χ corresponds to the irre-
ducible real 2-dimensional representation χR. As χ´1 – χ, we see that
pχ´1qR and χR are isomorphic as real representations. In terms of the
distinguished isomorphism of Λ_ – Λ induced by the inner product, the
involution on Λ_ reads λ Ø ´λ and the above isomorphism of complex
characters is ρ´λ – ρλ. In particular, we see that every nontrivial irre-
ducible real representation of R{Λ factors through a complex character
via the standard inclusion Up1q – SOp2q ãÑ Op2q:
R{Λ
Up1q
Op2q
χ
ϕ
As a consequence, if we decompose an R{Λ-equivariant real vector bundle
V over FixpMq as
V “ Vr0s ‘ V eﬀ“ Vr0s ‘
M
rχsPΛ_z{0}{˘
Vrχs,
we see that the eﬀective component V eﬀcan always be endowed (non
canonically) with a complex structure. In particular V eﬀis always an
even rank orientable vector bundle.

10
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
Remark 2.22. By choosing an orientation for V eﬀone has a well deﬁned
equivariant Euler class for it, and a change in the choice of the orientation
corresponds to a sign change in the equivariant Euler class.
The above remark leads to the following doubling trick. The two pos-
sible equivariant Euler classes for V eﬀ, corresponding to the two possible
orientations, are precisely the two solutions of the equation
(2.3)
rωs2 “ p´1q
rk V eﬀ
2
ctop,R{ΛpV eﬀb Cq
with rωs of degree 1
2 rkR V eﬀ. The choice of one solution then determines
an orientation of V eﬀ; namely, the orientation whose corresponding equi-
variant Euler class is the chosen solution.
Remark 2.23. Since characteristic classes with real or complex coeﬃcients
can be computed via Chern-Weil theory, equation (2.3) has a simple ori-
gin in linear algebra: if F∇P Ω2pM, sop2kqq is the curvature 2-form for a
Riemannian connection ∇on an even rank orientable vector bundle V on
a smooth manifold M, then the top Chern class of V bC has a closed form
representative given by the determinant detp 1
2πiF∇q “ p´1qk detp 1
2πF∇q,
while the Euler class of V has a closed form representative given by the
Pfaﬃan Pfp 1
2πF∇q, and for any skew-symmetric matrix A in sop2kq one
has PfpAq2 “ detpAq.
Deﬁnition 2.24. Let a choice of arguments for the elements λ P Λz{0}
be ﬁxed. The equivariant Euler class eulR{ΛpV eﬀq deﬁned by this choice
is the distinguished solution of equation (2.3), given by
(2.4)

where the determination of the square root is such that √1 ` t “ 1`t{2`
¨ ¨ ¨ . The distinguished orientation on V eﬀdeﬁned by the given choice of
arguments is the one that is coherent with this choice of equivariant Euler
class.
Remark 2.25. Since we are assuming V is a ﬁnite rank vector bundle,
only ﬁnitely many ranks rkpV eﬀb Cqρλ are nonzero. So the product in
(2.4) is actually a ﬁnite product and one actually only needs to choose
arguments for the ﬁnitely many λ’s in Λz0 such that rkpV eﬀb Cqρλ is
nonzero.
Deﬁnition 2.26. The pR{Λq-equivariant cohomology class
\
eulR{ΛpV eﬀq :“

\
ctop,R{ΛpV eﬀb Cq
is called the normalized equivariant Euler class of V eﬀ.

C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE WITTEN CLASS
11
Remark 2.27. The normalized equivariant Euler class \
eulR{ΛpV eﬀq is in-
dependent of any choice of arguments, and so is canonically associated
with the real equivariant vector bundle V .
Remark 2.28. If the R{Λ-equivariant vector bundle V is oriented, one
endows Vr0s with the orientation compatible with those of V and V eﬀ.
By this procedure, applied to the tangent bundle of an oriented R{Λ-
manifold M, one gets a canonical orientation for FixpMq once a choice
of arguments for the nonzero elements in the lattice Λ has been ﬁxed.
3. The (anti-)holomorphic sector for a complex torus
action
With this short reminder of equivariant cohomology for 1d Euclidean
tori actions, we have set the stage to describe the Cartan complex and
equivariant cohomology classes for the action of 2d ﬂat tori equipped
with a complex structure.
By deﬁnition, these tori are given by the quotients C{Λ of C by two
dimensional lattices Λ Ă C, so they are the natural generalization of the
Euclidean 1d tori R{Λ considered in the previous section. The quotients
C{Λ have a natural structure of Lie groups and, as in the 1d case, we
will denote their Lie algebra by tΛ. Moreover C{Λ, carries a holomorphic
structure compatible with the group addition, so that complex tori are
an example of holomorphic Lie groups. This gives the Lie algebra tΛ a
complex Lie algebra structure that will allow us to give the complexi-
ﬁed Cartan complex of a C{Λ-action a holomorphic kick. The following
statement is immediate.
Lemma 3.1. Let M be a compact smooth manifold M equipped with a
smooth action by C{Λ œ M. The complex structure on tΛ gives a natural
splitting tΛ bR C – tΛ1,0 ‘ tΛ0,1 inducing a decomposition
Ω‚pM; CqC{Λ bC SympptΛ
1,0q_r´2sq bC SympptΛ
0,1q_r´2sq,
of the complexiﬁed Cartan complex
Ω‚pM; CqC{Λ bC SympptΛ bR Cq_r´2sq
computing the equivariant cohomology of C{Λ œ M with coeﬃcients in C.
This realizes the complexiﬁed Cartan complex as the total complex of a tri-
complex with Ωk´p´qpM; CqC{Λ bC Symppt1,0

the de Rham diﬀerential; the diﬀerential of degree p0, 1, 0q is the operator
eΛ_r´2sιveΛ, where peΛ, eΛ_q is a pair consisting of a C-linear generator
of tΛ1,0 and of its dual element in ptΛ1,0q_, and veΛ is the complex vector

ﬁeld on M corresponding to eΛ via the diﬀerential of the action; the dif-
ferential of degree p0, 0, 1q is the operator eΛ_r´2sιveΛ, where peΛ, eΛ_q is
a pair consisting of a C-linear generator of tΛ0,1 and of its dual element
in ptΛ0,1q_.
Remark 3.2. The isomorphism LiepCq
„ÝÑ tΛ induced by the projection
C Ñ C{Λ induces natural C-linear generators for t1,0
Λ and t0,1
Λ , given by the
images of the complex invariant vector ﬁelds B{Bz and B{Bz, respectively.
Denoting by ξ and ξ the dual invariant 1-forms dz and dz placed in degree
2, the complexiﬁed Cartan tricomplex is written
pΩ‚pM; CqC{Λrξ, ξs; ddR, ξιvB{Bz, ξιvB{Bzq.
With respect to the given trigrading, the variables ξ and ξ have tridegree
p1, 1, 0q and p1, 0, 1q, respectively.
Remark 3.3. The somehow unusual trigrading is chosen so that the dif-
ferentials have tridegree p1, 0, 0q, p0, 1, 0q and p0, 0, 1q, respectively. See
Remark 2.5.
By restricting the Cartan tricomplex only to the antiholomorphic (resp.
holomorphic) part, i.e. by taking only tΛ0,1 (resp. tΛ1,0) instead of tΛbRC,
and taking the associated total complex, we end up with the deﬁnition of
the antiholomorphic (resp. holomorphic) sector of the Cartan complex
over C.
Deﬁnition 3.4. In the same assumptions as in Lemma 3.1, the antiholo-
morphic sector of the complexiﬁed Cartan complex is the total complex
associated with the bicomplex
pΩ‚pM; CqC{Λ bC SympptΛ
0,1q_r´2sq; ddR, eΛ
_r´2sιveΛq.
Its total diﬀerential will be denoted by BC{Λ and its cohomology by the
symbol H‚
C{Λ;BpM; Cq. By changing tΛ0,1 into tΛ1,0 one obtains the deﬁni-
tion of the holomorphic sector.
Remark 3.5. In terms of the distinguished basis {B{Bz, B{Bz} of LiepCq b
C, the antiholomorphic sector of the Cartan complex over C is the total
complex associated to the bicomplex
pΩ‚pM; CqC{Λrξs; ddR, ξιvB{Bzq.
3.1. C{Λ-equivariant Chern classes. Exactly as in the R{Λ case, C{Λ-
equivariant complex line bundles over FixpMq are equivalently pairs pL, χq
consisting of a complex line bundle L over FixpMq and a character

C{Λ-equivariant Cartan complex is

Chern classes of higher rank C{Λ-equivariant complex vector bundles are
deﬁned exactly as in the R{Λ setting: one ﬁrst decomposes the bundle
as the direct sum of its isotypic components, and then formally splits
each of these as a direct sum of line bundles.
This way one deﬁnes
the equivariant Euler classes eulC{ΛpV eﬀq and the normalized equivariant
Euler classes \
eulC{ΛpV eﬀq by generalizing Deﬁnitions 2.24 and 2.26.
Remark 3.6. By means of the standard Hermitian pairing on C, the dual
lattice Λ_ of characters of C{Λ is identiﬁed with Λ: every character of
C{Λ is of the form
ρλpzq “ exp

for some λ P Λ. The corresponding weight is

We will be particularly interested in the antiholomorphic part of the

sector obtained by evaluating the holomorphic parameter ξ at 0. By the
splitting principle, these are determined by the antiholomorphic parts of
the equivariant ﬁrst Chern classes,

By analogy with the construction in Section 2.3, for real C{Λ-equivariant
bundles we have a notion of (normalized) equivariant Euler classes in the
antiholomorphic sector for their eﬀectively acted parts.
Deﬁnition 3.10. Let V be a real C{Λ-equivariant bundle on FixpMq
and let V eﬀbe its eﬀectively acted subbundle. For a ﬁxed choice of the
arguments for the elements λ P Λz{0}, the equivariant Euler class of V eﬀ
in the antiholomorphic sector is the element in H‚

4. The antiholomorphic localization theorem
Localization techniques are a very common and powerful tool in equi-
variant cohomology. We will brieﬂy recall the main theorem, the Atiyah-
Bott localization theorem for a d-dimensional torus actions [AB84] stated
in its Euclidean version, i.e., for ﬂat tori of the form Rd{Λ, and then show
how for complex tori C{Λ the result continues to hold even when we re-
strict our attention to the antiholomorphic sector.
4.1. The localization formula for a Euclidean torus actions. Let
Rd{Λ be a d-dimensional Euclidean torus, with Lie algebra tΛ, and let
M be a smooth compact connected oriented ﬁnite dimensional manifold
endowed with a smooth Rd{Λ-action. Assume FixpMq is a nonempty
smooth submanifold of M, and denote by ν the normal bundle to the
inclusion ι: FixpMq ãÑ M. The Rd{Λ-action on ν is completely eﬀective,
i.e., ν{0} “ 0 and so, by the same argument used above in the case d “ 1,
the real bundle ν carries a complex structure. In particular, it is of even

16

rank and orientable. Once an orientation is ﬁxed, one has a well deﬁned
equivariant Euler class for ν, that can be written as
eulRd{Λpνq “ wppνq \
eulRd{Λpνq
with wppνq a degree 2 rk ν element in Sympt_
Λr´2sq, called the weight
polynomial, and \
eulRd{Λpνq a degree zero invertible element in the Rd{Λ-
equivariant cohomology of FixpMq localized at wppνq, of the form 1`¨ ¨ ¨ .
One orients FixpMq in such a way that its orientation is compatible
with those on M and on ν. Having ﬁxed this notation, the Atiyah-Bott
localization theorem reads as follows.
Theorem 4.1 (Localization isomorphism). After localization at the weight
polynomial wppνq, the equivariant cohomologies of M and FixpMq become
isomorphic Sympt_
Λr´2sqpwppνqq-modules. An explicit isomorphism is given
by:
H‚
Rd{ΛpM, Rqpwppνqq
H‚
Rd{ΛpFixpMq, Rqpwppνqqr´rkνs.
eulRd{Λpνq´1¨ι˚
The inverse isomorphism is given by the equivariant pushforward ι˚.
Remark 4.2. In what follows we are not making use of pushforwards in
equivariant cohomology, so the last line in the statement of Theorem
4.1 is included only for completeness. We address the interested reader
to [AB84] for details on pushforwards in equivariant cohomology.
Remark 4.3. The localization isomorphism is induced by a morphism
between the Cartan complexes. To realize such a morphism one only
needs to choose closed forms representatives in Ω‚pFixpMq; CqRd{Λ for the
Chern classes of the normal bundle ν, endowed with a chosen complex
structure. Such a choice determines a representative for eulRd{Λpνq´1 in
Ω‚pFixpMq; RqRd{Λ bR Sympt_
Λr´2sqpwppνqq, which we will denote by the
same symbol eulR{Λpνq´1, and one has a morphism of diﬀerential graded
Sympt_
Λr´2sqpwppνqq-modules
Ω‚pM, RqRd{Λ bR Sympt_
Λr´2sqpwppνqq
Ω‚pFixpMq, RqRd{Λ bR Sympt_
Λr´2sqpwppνqqr´rkνs.
eulRd{Λpνq´1¨ι˚
The Atiyah-Bott theorem then says that this morphism is a quasi-isomorphism.
The fact that the inverse of eulRd{Λpνq´1 ¨ ι˚ is the equivariant pushfor-
ward ι˚ has the following important consequence.

Corollary 4.4 (Localization formula). Let ˜ω P pΩ‚pM; RqRd{Λqwppνq be

M. Then

Corollary 4.4 is often used in the following version, to compute integrals

Corollary 4.5. Let ω P Ωdim MpM; RqRd{Λ be an invariant top degree
form on M.
Assume one has an equivariantly closed extension ˜ω P

Remark 4.6. In the particular setting of Corollary 4.5, the localization
formula (4.2) tells us that the term on its right hand side, which is a priori
an element in the R-algebra Sympt_
Λr´2sqpwppνqq, is actually a constant,
i.e., an element of R. Also notice that despite the right-hand side in (4.2)
appears on ﬁrst sight to depend on the choice of an orientation of ν it
actually does not depend on it, as the orientation of FixpMq is not ﬁxed
a priori but is determined by that of ν in such a way that they are jointly
compatible with the orientation of M.
Remark 4.7. When d “ 1, one can use (2.4) to write the localization
formula (4.2) as

The right hand side of (4.3) a priori depends on the choice of the argu-
ments for the elements λ P Λz{0}, and it is actually independent of it
due to the same argument as in remark 4.6.
4.2. The antiholomorphic localization theorem. Let us now con-
sider complex tori C{Λ.
In this situation, Theorem 4.1 becomes the
following.
Theorem 4.8 (Localization Isomorphism in the Antiholomorphic Sec-
tor). After localization at the antiholomorphic weight polynomial wpBpνq,
the antiholomorphic sectors of equivariant cohomologies of M and FixpMq
become isomorphic CrξspwpBpνqq-modules. An explicit isomorphism is given
by:

C{Λ;BpM, CqpwpBpνqq

The inverse isomorphism is given by the restriction of the equivariant
pushforward ι˚ to the antiholomorphic sector.
Proof. In terms of the distinguished variables ξ and ξ introduced in Re-
mark 3.2, the localization quasi-isomorphism is written as the quasi iso-
morphism of diﬀerential graded Crξ, ξspwppνqq-modules
Ω‚pM, CqC{Λrξ, ξspwppνqq

where the commutativity of the bottom square follows from Lemma 3.13.
Since the ﬁrst two horizontal arrows are quasi-isomorphisms by the
Atiyah-Bott localization theorem, so is the third one. This proves the
ﬁrst part of the statement. Since the diﬀerential on the Cartan complexes
for the ﬁxed point loci reduces to the de Rham diﬀerential acting trivially
on the variables ξ, ξ, the induced linear map

make Up1q – SOp2q act on S2 by rotations around the vertical axis,
i.e., via the embedding SOp2q ãÑ SOp3q given by A ÞÑ diagpA, 1q. For
any nonzero λ P Λ Ă C, use the character ρλ: C{Λ Ñ Up1q to deﬁne
a C{Λ-action on S2. Using stereographic coordinates on S2 and polar

5. C˚-equivariant families of C{Λ-manifolds and modularity
So far we have been considering a single C{Λ-manifold M together with
a C{Λ-equivariant bundle E, for a ﬁxed lattice Λ. Interesting phenomena
happen if we let the lattice, the manifold and the bundle vary. More
precisely, we will be interested into a smooth family MΛ of C{Λ-manifolds
equipped with a smooth family of C{Λ-equivariant bundles EΛ, with Λ
ranging over all oriented lattices in C. And, in particular, we will be
interested in the case when these data are C˚-equivariant.
Remark 5.1. By saying that the families we are considering are smooth
we are implicitly saying that the set of all oriented lattices in C has a
natural structure of a smooth manifold. It is indeed so: any lattice Λ Ď C
admits a basis given by an ordered pair pω1, ω2q P C2 with Impω1ω2q ą 0.
Denoting this open subset of C2 by U, one has that
Lattices`pCq “ U{SLp2; Zq.
Since the SLp2; Zq-action on U is free and properly discontinuous, one
sees that Lattices`pCq is naturally a smooth manifold.
The intuitive

C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE WITTEN CLASS
21
notion of a smooth family of manifolds parametrized by lattices can
then be formalized as the datum of a smooth and proper submersion
M Ñ Lattices`pCq. Similarly, one formalizes the notion of a smooth fam-
ily of C{Λ-manifolds by working in the category of smooth group actions
over the base manifold Lattices`pCq. Analogous considerations apply to
the deﬁnition of smooth families of C{Λ-equivariant bundles. However, it
turns out that as soon as C˚-equivariance comes into play the only possi-
ble way of having nontrivial smooth families of C{Λ-equivariant bundles
is by considering inﬁnite rank bundles. This abruptly takes us out of the
ﬁnite rank constructions of the previous sections and the product formu-
las deﬁning equivariant Chern classes become inﬁnite products that need
regularization in order to be meaningful. We are going to work this out in
detail in the example leading to the Witten genus in Section 6. Here, in
consideration of the fact that even a detailed presentation of C{Λ-families
in terms of the base manifold Lattices`pCq will actually not allow us to
derive the main results of this Section in terms of the ﬁnite-rank tech-
nology developed so far, we will content ourselves in giving “ﬁbrewise
deﬁnitions”, leaving to the interested reader task of writing them in terms
of global objects over a base. Although the deﬁnitions will be given ﬁbre-
wise, it is always assumed that whenever an entity depends on a lattice
Λ the dependence is smooth in Λ. More crucially, we will pretend to be
unaware that the nontrivial bundles occurring in the constructions in the
present Section have necessarily inﬁnite rank, and only at the very end
of the Section we will reveal the reader where this inﬁnite-dimensionality
occurs. So the whole Section is written pretending that the bundles ap-
pearing in it are of ﬁnite rank, and has to be intended as a presentation
of the abstract nonsense motivating why one should expect the modular
properties of the Witten genus. These properties will then be rigorously
derived in Section 6. We also remark that, since we are ultimately in-
terested only in manifolds with trivial C{Λ-actions, one could give the
deﬁnitions in this Section directly in this setting, simplifying both the
exposition and the construction. However, this shortcut would not be
very natural from the point of view of the family MΛ :“ MapspC{Λ, Xq
leading to the Witten genus, so we prefer to avoid it. The idea is that,
while this Section is only fully rigorous for trivial examples, yet it pro-
vides the abstract geometric framework where the construction of the
Witten genus and a proof of its modular properties take place and so it
can help understanding their speciﬁc presentation given in Section 6.
The multiplicative group C˚ of nonzero complex numbers smoothly

We say that the family {MΛ} of C{Λ-manifolds is a C˚-equivariant fam-
ily if it is compatible with this C˚-action. More precisely, we give the
following.
Deﬁnition 5.2. An C˚-equivariant family of C{Λ-manifolds is a smooth
family {MΛ} of C{Λ-manifolds such that, for any a P C˚ and any oriented
lattice Λ one is given diﬀeomorphisms

Remark 5.3. In the same spirit of Remark 5.1, one can express the notion
of a C˚-equivariant family in terms of smooth ﬁber bundles over the
moduli stack
M1,1pCq “ Lattices`pCq{{C˚ “ H{{SLp2, Zq
of elliptic curves over C. Notice that neither the C˚-action on Lattices`pCq
nor the SLp2, Zq on the upper complex half-plane H “ {τ P C : Impτq ą
0} are free due the fact that the multiplication by ´1 acts trivially. In
terms of elliptic curves this corresponds to the standard involution re-
alizing them as ramiﬁed double covers of P1C. Additionally, there are
points with larger stabilizers, corresponding to lattices with nontrivial
symmetries, e.g., the square lattice Zris Ď C.
Remark 5.4. Equipping a manifold X with the trivial C{Λ-action for any
lattice Λ produces a C˚-equivariant family of equivariant cohomologies
of X parametrized by the elliptic curves C{Λ. Arguably, taking the anti-
holomorphic sectors one obtains a holomorphic vector bundle EpXq over
the moduli space of elliptic curves whose holomorphic sections describe

elliptic cohomology classes of X with C-coeﬃcients. More precisely, one
should have an elliptic Chern character isomorphism EℓℓpXq b C
„ÝÑ
ΓpM1,1; EpXqq. This statement, motivated by the analogous one estab-
lished by Daniel Berwick-Evans in the setting of supersymmetric ﬁeld
theories [BE13,BE19], will be hopefully investigated in detail elsewhere.
Remark 5.5. It is immediate from Deﬁnition 5.2 that the diﬀeomorphisms
ϕa,Λ induce, by restriction to the ﬁxed points loci, diﬀeomorphisms
ϕa,Λ : FixpMΛq
„ÝÑ FixpMaΛq.
Thanks to the compatibilities between the morphisms pϕa,Λ, ma,Λq and
the elliptic curve actions in a C˚-equivariant family, one sees that the
pullback morphisms ϕ˚
a,Λ : Ω‚pMaΛ; Cq Ñ Ω‚pMΛ; Cq induce, by restric-
tion to invariant forms, pullback morphisms
ϕ˚
a,Λ : Ω‚pMaΛ; CqC{aΛ Ñ Ω‚pMΛ; CqC{Λ.
The complex Lie group isomorphism ma,Λ induce, by passing to Lie alge-
bras, complex linear isomorphisms of abelian Lie algebras dma,Λ : tΛ Ñ
taΛ.
Under the isomorphism LiepCq
„ÝÑ tΛ induced by the projection
C Ñ C{Λ, these linear isomorphisms are just multiplications by the com-
plex number a. Complexifying and dualizing we obtain the C-linear au-
tomorphism of LiepCq_ b C that acts on the distinguished basis pdz, dzq
as dz ÞÑ a dz and dz ÞÑ a dz. Therefore,in terms of the distinguished

the C-linear isomorphism

Corollary 5.8. The data of a C˚-equivariant family of C{Λ-manifolds
induce isomorphisms between the antiholomorphic sector of the complex-
iﬁed Cartan complex of MaΛ and that of MΛ, for any oriented lattice Λ
and every a P C˚.
Corollary 5.9. In a C˚-equivariant family, the C{Λ-equivariant coho-
mology of MΛ and the C{aΛ-equivariant cohomology of MaΛ are canoni-
cally isomorphic. The same holds for their (anti-)holomorphic sectors.
Remark 5.10. In global terms, Corollary 5.9 amounts to saying that
H‚

C{Λ;BpMΛ; Cq deﬁne complex vector bundles over the

5.1. Equivariant vector bundles over C˚-equivariant families. Given
a family {MΛ} of C{Λ-manifolds, we can consider a family of C{Λ-
equivariant vector bundles EΛ over the ﬁxed loci FixpMΛq. Again, regu-
larity of the family {EΛ} can be expressed in terms of a single equivariant
vector bundle E over FixpMq, where M Ñ Lattices`pCq is the smooth
and proper submersion from Remark 5.1, but here too we will content us

with ﬁbrewise deﬁnitions. When {MΛ} is a C˚-equivariant family, it is
natural to consider vector bundles EΛ that form a C˚-equivariant family,
too. This leads to the following.
Deﬁnition 5.11. A C˚-equivariant family of C{Λ-equivariant vector
bundles EΛ over the ﬁxed loci of a C˚-equivariant family of C{Λ-manifolds
is a smooth family of equivariant vector bundles equipped with isomor-

Example 5.12. The restrictions to the ﬁxed loci of the tangent bundles
TMΛ for a C˚-equivariant family {MΛ} are a C˚-equivariant family of
C{Λ-equivariant vector bundles, with isomorphisms ψa,Λ given by the
diﬀerentials of the diﬀeomorphisms ϕa,Λ:

Equation (5.2) in this case is
dϕa1a2,Λ “ ϕ˚

and so it is satisﬁed due to the chain rule for diﬀerentials, since ϕa1a2,Λ “
ϕa2,a1Λ ˝ ϕa1,Λ. The tangent bundles TFixpMΛq to the ﬁxed loci form a

By the splitting principle we therefore get the following.

5.2. Trivializations of the ﬁxed points bundle and modular forms.
Assume now we have a trivialization of the family of ﬁxed points subman-
ifolds of a C˚-equivariant family {MΛ}. In terms of smooth bundles over
the moduli stack M1,1, this is a trivialization of the smooth ﬁber bundle
FixpMq Ñ M1,1. In terms of ﬁbrewise deﬁnitions, this is the following.
Deﬁnition 5.17. Let {MΛ} be a C˚-equivariant family. A trivializa-
tion of the C˚-equivariant family {FixpMΛq} is the datum of a smooth
manifold X and of a collection of diﬀeomorphisms

A trivialization of the ﬁxed points bundle produces a trivialization of
the C{Λ-equivariant cohomologies of the ﬁxed loci and of their antiholo-
morphic sectors. More precisely, we have the following lemma, whose
proof is immediate from Remark 5.6 and Deﬁnition 5.17.

The second statement in Lemma 5.18 clearly continues to hold after
we localize H‚pFixpMΛq, CqrξΛs at ξΛ and H‚pX, CqrξXs at ξX. Recalling
Remark 3.12, we can now give the main deﬁnition of this section.
Deﬁnition 5.19. Let {MΛ} be a C˚-equivariant family of C{Λ-manifolds
with a given trivialization pX, {jΛ}q of its ﬁxed points, and let E “ {EΛ}
and V “ {VΛ} be C˚-equivariant families of C{Λ-equivariant complex

Proposition 5.20. The k-th complex W-class WE;k is a modular form
of weight k with values in H2kpX, Cq. The k-th real W-class WR;V;k is a
modular form of weight 2k with values in H4kpX, Cq.

Proof. We give a proof for the complex W-classes ﬁrst. We have to show
that for any a P C˚ and any oriented lattice Λ we have
WE;kpaΛq “ a´kWE,kpΛq

behavior of WE;k for τ Ñ `i8, showing that WE;k is indeed a modular
form, immediately follows from the discussion at the end of this Section.
The proof for the real W classes is identical, by using Corollary 5.15.

C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE WITTEN CLASS

As in every respectable detective story it is now time to unveil the
mystery around the somehow suspicious Proposition 5.20 and the role
inﬁnite rank bundles secretly play in it: after all, how is it possible that
the ﬁnite product deﬁning the total complex W-class of E deﬁnes a mod-
ular form? The point is that Proposition 5.20 is true, but it is trivially
true: a C˚-equivariant family of C{Λ-equivariant ﬁnite rank bundles only
carries the trivial action by C{Λ, so that Eeﬀ
Λ “ 0 and the normalized
top Chern class of Eeﬀ
Λ is 1. The k-th complex W class of E is then 1 for
k “ 0 and 0 for k ą 0. These are clearly modular forms, but trivially
so. The reason for the triviality of the C{Λ-action on EΛ is hidden in
Lemma 5.13. There, we consider a C˚-equivariant family {pLΛ, χΛq} of
C{Λ-equivariant complex line bundles on FixpMΛq. By looking at the
second component of the pair pLΛ, χΛq we have in particular an associa-
tion Λ ÞÑ χΛ. Identifying the characters of C{Λ with the lattice Λ itself,
we therefore see we are picking an element of Λ or every Λ. And the
only way of doing this in a continuous and equivariant manner is to pick
the element 0 for any Λ. Indeed, a continuous C˚-equivariant choice of
χΛ is equivalent to the datum of a continuous and SLp2; Zq-equivariant
function H Ñ Z2, where one has the standard action of SLp2; Zq on Z2.
Since H is connected, this is the datum of an SLp2; Zq-invariant element
of Z2 and the only such an element is p0, 0q. If instead of a family of
line bundles we consider a family of ﬁnite-rank vector bundles not much
changes: now for each lattice Λ we are picking the set of characters of
C{Λ corresponding to the formal decomposition of EΛ into a direct sum
of C{Λ-equivariant line bundles, and doing this in a continuous way is
equivalent to picking a ﬁnite SLp2; Zq-invariant subset of Z2. But the
only such subset is {p0, 0q}: an invariant subset is an union of orbits,
and all the SLp2; Zq-orbits in Z2, except {p0, 0q} are inﬁnite.
Things
drastically change if we allow inﬁnite-rank vector bundles. Now we can
have nontrivial SLp2; Zq-invariant subsets of Z2 and so the construction
in Proposition 5.20 will formally produce a modular form. Yet, since the
normalized top Chern class of Eeﬀ
Λ will now be an inﬁnite product with
no reason to converge, this modular form will only be a formal expression.
What one can do is to try to use regularization techniques to change the
possibly divergent inﬁnite product into a convergent one and hope that
the modular properties of the formal expression survive the regulariza-
tion process. In the next Section we show that this is indeed so in the
particular case of this general construction leading to the Witten genus
of a rational string manifold.

6. The Witten class of double loop spaces
Let now X be a smooth d-dimensional manifold. A paradigmatic ex-
ample of a C˚-equivariant family of C{Λ-manifolds is given by
MΛ :“ MapspC{Λ, Xq,
the spaces of smooth maps from C{Λ to X, with their standard Fr´echet
inﬁnite-dimensional smooth manifold structures, and with C{Λ-actions
given by translation: z ‹ γ : p ÞÑ γpp ` zq. The isomorphisms
ϕa,Λ : MapspC{Λ, Xq
„ÝÑ MapspC{aΛ, Xq
are given by the pullbacks along ma´1,aΛ : C{aΛ Ñ C{Λ. The commuta-
tivity of (5.1) is then the trivial identity a´1pp`azq “ a´1p`z. The sub-
manifold of ﬁxed points for this action consists of the submanifold of con-
stant loops, so that we have a canonical trivialization jΛ : X
„ÝÑ FixpMΛq
mapping a point x P X to the constant map γx : C{Λ Ñ X with con-
stant value x. The commutativity of (5.3) is trivial. We are thus in the
situation considered in Section 5.2 and so, by Proposition 5.20 and Corol-
lary 5.21, modular forms are naturally associated with the C˚-equivariant
family {MapspC{Λ, Xq} and so, ultimately, to X.
Things are however not so straightforward.
Indeed, as the normal
bundle to X in MapspC{Λ, Xq has inﬁnite rank, we will need to make
sense of the now inﬁnite products deﬁning normalized equivariant top
Chern classes and Euler classes. The idea here is to write
 
1 ` αipEρλqξ
´1
Λ
λ
!
“

1 ` z
λ

z“αipEρλqξ
´1
Λ
where we think of the degree zero variable z as of a complex variable, to
compute the product of the factors 1`z{λ so to obtain an entire function
Φpzq and then to compute ΦpαipEρλqξ
´1
Λ q by putting z “ αipEρλqξ
´1
Λ
in
the Taylor expansion of Φ at z “ 0. Notice that this last operation makes
sense without any convergence issue as, by the ﬁnite dimensionality of
X, the degree zero element αipEρλqξ
´1
Λ is nilpotent. Yet, there is no guar-
antee that the inﬁnite product of the factors 1 ` z{λ will converge, and
actually it does not. So one has to suitably regularize it in order to get
a convergent product. A convenient way of doing so is by the technique
of Weierstraß ζ-regularization that we recall below. Our problems are
not over, yet: ζ-regularization may disrupt the expected modularity of
W-classes, so we will have to check in the end whether this is preserved.
It will turn out that a topological constraint on X has to be imposed in
order to maintain modularity: X has to be a rational string manifold.
With these premises, we can now determine the W-classes of the C˚-
equivariant family {MΛ} “ {MapspC{Λ, Xq}. We will assume X to be

C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE WITTEN CLASS
33
2-connected so that MΛ is connected. One can weaken this assumption
by requiring X to be only connected, and taking MΛ to be the space
Maps0pC{Λ, Xq of homotopically trivial maps from C{Λ to X. Or one
can even remove any connectedness assumption on X by working sepa-
rately on each of the connected components of Maps0pC{Λ, Xq (which
bijectively correspond to the connected components of X).
As the smooth structure on MΛ is the standard Fr´echet one, the tan-
gent space at the point γ P MapspC{Λ, Xq is the space H0pC{Λ; γ˚TXq
of smooth sections of the pullback of the tangent bundle of X via γ. In
particular, for any x P X we have
TγxMΛ “ C8pC{Λ; TxXq “ C8pC{Λ; Rq bR TxX,
and so the restriction of the complexiﬁed tangent bundle of MΛ to X “
FixpMΛq is
TMΛ b C

X “ C8pC{Λ; Cq bC pTX bR Cq.
Remark 6.1. In writing X “ FixpMΛq we have identiﬁed X with FixpMΛq
via jΛ. We will keep this identiﬁcation ﬁxed in all that follows, so that
we will see X as a submanifold of MΛ and consequently reduce jΛ to the
identity of X.
Since Fourier polynomials are dense in the Fr´echet topology of C8pC{Λ; Cq,
in the same vein of [Ati85], we consider the dense inclusion

one uses Weierstraß ζ-regularization. For the reader’s convenience we
recall the basics of the procedure here.
A detailed treatment can be

the inﬁnite product deﬁning Wei⃗κ,⃗ppzq is unchanged under simultaneous
renumbering of {κn} and {pn}. If Λ Ď C is a lattice, then the series

the ζ-function ζΛz{0} will then be deﬁned at every positive integer, and
one can formally write

Thanks to
absolute convergence, the terms ep´z{λqk freely move in and out from the
product over Λz{0} for k ą 2. Therefore, the last term in the above
chain of formal identities is independent of r as soon as r ě 2 and we
arrive at the following.
Deﬁnition 6.2. Let a choice of arguments for the elements λ P Λz{0}
in such a way that ζΛz{0} is deﬁned at s “ 1 and at s “ 2 be ﬁxed. The
Weierstraß ζ-regularized product of the factors p1 ` z{λq with λ ranging

Remark 6.3. Choices of arguments for the elements λ P Λz{0} such that
ζΛz{0}p1q and ζΛz{0}p2q are deﬁned do actually exist and moreover there
are quite natural choices with this property, see [QHS93, Example 13].
We can now turn (6.1) into a formal deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.4. Let νΛ be the normal bundle for the inclusion X ãÑ
MapspC{Λ, Xq. The Weierstraß ζ-regularized equivariant top Chern class
of νΛ b C in the antiholomorphic sector is deﬁned as

By analogy with Deﬁnition 5.19 we then give the following.
Deﬁnition 6.5. In the same assumptions as in Deﬁnitions 6.2 and 6.4,
the ζ-regularized total complex W-class of ν b C is the function

where σΛpzq is the Weierstraß σ-function of the lattice Λ.
Proof. By deﬁnition of the Weierstraß σ-function (see, e.g., [WW15, Sec-
tion 20.42] or [Sil09, IV.3])4, one has

and by comparing with Deﬁnition 6.2.

sition 10.9])

C{Λ-EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE WITTEN CLASS
37
recalls that the odd Chern classes of the complexiﬁcation of a real vector
bundle vanish, and uses the relation c2pTXbRCq “ ´p1pTXq to conclude.
□
It is important to stress that the ζ-function ζΛz{0} and its value at 2
depend on the choice of arguments for the elements λ in Λz{0}. Therefore,
also Wζ
νbC depends on this choice.
One removes this dependence by
requiring that p1pXq is zero in H4pX; Qq, i.e., by requiring that X is a
rational string manifold. With this assumption, formula (6.4) reduces to
(6.6)
Wζ
νbCpΛq “

σΛpzq

z“αipXqξ

,
where now the right hand side is a canonically deﬁned equivariant coho-
mology class in the antiholomorphic sector.
The entire function z{σΛpzq is the characteristic power series for the
complex Witten genus [AHR06]. Therefore, summing up, we have ob-
tained the following.
Proposition 6.8. Let X be a d-dimensional rational string manifold.
Then Wζ
νbC is the complex Witten class of the manifold X. In particular,
if d is even then
Z
X
Wζ
νbC;d{2
is the complex Witten genus of X.
Remark 6.9. Proposition 6.8 in particular tells us that if X is a rational
string manifold, then the ζ-regularized complex W-classes
Wζ
νbC;k : Lattices`pCq Ñ H2kpX, Cq
are modular forms of weight k. This can be directly seen from (6.6) by
the modular properties of the function pΛ, zq ÞÑ z{σΛpxq, which are in
turn immediate from the product formula (6.3).
Remark 6.10. When Λ “ Z ‘ Zτ with Impτq ą 0, with the standard
choice of arguments ´π ď argpλq ă π, one gets
ζΛz{0}p2q “ ´4πiη1pτq
ηpτq “ G2pτq
where η is the Dedekind η-function and G2 is the quasi-modular Eisen-
stein series

38
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
appearing in the expression of the Witten class for a non rationally string
manifold for lattices of the standard form Z ‘ Zτ. More generally, once
an oriented basis pω1, ω2q for the lattice Λ is chosen, one can write Λ “
ω´1
1 pZ ‘ τZq with τ “ ω2{ω1, choose an argument for ω1 in r´π, πq and
choose the arguments of the elements λ P Λz{0} so that
´π ` argpω1q ď argpλq ă π ` argpω1q.
With this choice one has ζΛz{0}p2q “ ω´2
1 G2pτq.
As an immediate corollary, we get the analogous of Proposition 6.8 for
the real W-class. We ﬁrst need a couple of obvious deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 6.11. Let νΛ be the normal bundle for the inclusion X ãÑ
MapspC{Λ, Xq. The Weierstraß ζ-regularized equivariant Euler class of
νΛ in the antiholomorphic sector is deﬁned as
eulB;ζ

where the determination of the square root is such that √1 ` ¨ ¨ ¨ “ 1 `

Deﬁnition 6.12. In the same assumptions as in Deﬁnitions 6.2 and 6.4,
the ζ-regularized total real W-class of ν is the function

From equation (6.6) and by the usual √z Ø z rule for passing from
Pontryagin classes of a real vector bundle to Chern classes of its complexi-
ﬁcation in characteristic power series for genera (see, e.g., [Hir78, Section
1.3]), we have that if X is a rational string manifold of even dimension

where the βipXq are the Pontryagin roots of TX. From this, one has the
real W-classes analogue of Proposition 6.8.
Proposition 6.13. Let X be a rational string manifold of even dimen-
sion d. Then Wζ

ular, if d ” 0 mod 4 then
