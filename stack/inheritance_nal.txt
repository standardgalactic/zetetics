called

in

of
this

[

As

Concretely
,
it

the
follo
wing
features:
Finite:
The

Real-time:

Op
en:
No

and
questions
that
the
sys-
tem
can
encoun

as
long
as
they
are
expressible
in
the
formal
lan-

Adaptiv
e:
The
system
self-impro

es
its
b
eha
viors
under
the
assumption
that
its
future
exp

will
b
e
similar
to
its
past
exp

where
the
\exp

of
the
system
is
indicated
b
y
its
history
of
comm
u-

with
its
en

What
follo
ws
from
the
ab

ts
is:
the
system
need
to

t

of
uncertain

,
and
to

plausible

according
to

Therefore,
the
traditional
logic
sys-
tems,
suc
h
as
rst-order
predicate

cannot
b
e
applied.
Though
there
are
already
man

approac

that
are
designed
to
deal
with
uncertain

in-
complete

none
of

Extension

In

the

of

dened,
relativ

The

of
T
is
a
set
of

I
T
=
fx
j
(T

x)

K

g.

This
denition
is
of
great
imp
ortance.
T
raditionally
,
extension
and
in-
tension
refer
to
t
w
o
asp
ects
in
the
meaning
of
a
term:
its
instanc
es
and
its
pr
op
erties.
Extension
is
usually
dened
as
an
obje
ct,
or
a
set
of
ob-
jects,
whic
h
is
in
a
\ph

and
denoted
b

in
tension
is
usually
dened
as
a

whic
h
is
in
a
\Platonic

and
denot-

the

[

In
spite
of
the

among
the
exact
w
a
ys
the

are
used
b
y
dieren
t
authors,
they
indicate
relations
b
et
w
een
a
term
in
a
language
and
something
outside
the
language.
Ho
w
ev
er,
in
the
curren
t
theory
,
they
are
dened
as
(the
t
w
o
sides
of
)
a
relation
b
et
w
een
t
w
o
terms,
whic
h
is
within
the
language,
and
the
denition
still
k
eeps
the
in
tuitiv
e
senses
that
extension
refers
to
\instances",
and
in
tension
refers
to
\prop
erties".
W
e
can
see
wh
y
suc
h
a
denition
is
appropriate
when
the
ma
jor
result
of
the
pap

NAL,
is
discussed.
No

let
us
simply
accept
the
denition
and
its
implicatio

whic

are:

Extension

are
dened
in
suc

for
an

of

.
Since
the

all

at


Accurately

the

of

also
includes

Though
the

inuence
the

of
the

they
do
not
eect
the
ev

of
a
truth

therefore
they
are
ignored
here.


What
mak
es
the
things
more
complicated
is
the
fact
that,
also
b
ecause
of
the
insuciency
of
resources,
it
is
imp
ossible
for
the
system
to
tak
e
the
complete
E
in
to
accoun
t
when
ev
aluating
the
truth
v

of
a
judgmen

As
a
result,
truth
v
alues
are
usually
determined
according
to
a
se
ction
of
E
.
It
is
another
source
of
conicts
among
the
judgmen
ts.
Because

judgmen

ma
y
conict
with
eac
h
other.
It
is
p
ossible,
in
theory
,
to
use
binary
logic
in
this
situation.
F
or
example,
w
e
can
distinguish
four
t
yp
es
of
judgmen
ts,
based
on
the
giv
en
exp

E
,
b
y
whether
it

(as
in

Ho
w
ev

suc
h
a
logic
is
to

w

F
or
the
system
to
b
e
adaptiv
e,
the
weight
(or
amoun
t)
of

is
imp
ortan
t.
A
judgmen

that
has
b

times
should
denitely
win
a
comp

with
a

that
has
b
een
conrmed
only
once.
When
a
judgmen
t
has
b
oth
p
ositiv
e
and
negativ
e
evidence,
a
quan
titativ
e
comparison
is
necessary
.
Otherwise,
the
system
will
b
e
unable
to
mak
e
a
c
hoice
among
comp

answ

for
a

|
they
ma
y
b
e
all
mark

as
\p

No
w,
since
the
truth
v
alue
of
a
judgmen
t
is
actually
a
measuremen
t
of
the
p
ositiv
e
and
negativ
e
evidence,
then
what
w
e
need
to
do
is:
.
to
concretely
dene
the
p
ositiv
e
and
negativ
e
evidence
for
a
judgmen
t,
and
.
to
dene
a
measuremen
t
unit.
These
problems
are
hard
for
predicate
logics
(as
rev
ealed
b
y
the
famous
\Ra

arado

[

but
in
a
term
logic
lik
e
NAL,
w
e
can
nd
a
natural
solution
of
them.
In
summary
,
the
truth
v
alue
of
a
judgmen
t
in
NAL
is
a
n
umerical
represen
tation
indicating
the
w
eigh
ts
of
p
ositiv
e
and
negativ
e
evidence,
according
(part
of
)
the
exp
erience
of
the
system.
Ho
w
ev
er,
exp
erience
is
nothing
else
but
a
string
of
judgmen
ts,
with
their
truth
v
alues,
to

So,
w
e
seems
dene
a
truth

circularly
b

This
is
wh

W
e
will
build
NAL

and
use

construct
an
\ideal

for
eac
h
judgmen

in
NAL,
so
to
break
the

Alik

in

in

what

Ho
w
ev
er,
as
discussed
b
efore,
the
a;
e;
i;

in

need
to

F

a

what
is
its

Ob
vi-

,
if
(according

there
is
a

then
it

then
it

According

A

under

it
mak

F

w

not
mean
that
all
answ
ers
are
equally
go
o
d
for
a
question.
As
an
adaptiv
e
system,
NARS
should
answ
er
curren
t
questions
according
to
past
exp
erience.
So,
in
this
situation,
an
inference
rule
is
valid
not
b
ecause
the
conclusions
will
not
b
e
c
hallenged
in
the
future,
but
the
conclusions
are
summaries
of
(and
only
of
)
the
information
carried
in
the
premises,
according
to
the
seman
tics
of
the
system.
A
direct
implication
of
the
ab
o
v
e
consequence
is
that
all
the
inference
rules
are
\lo
cal
rules",
in
the
sense
that
eac
h
rule
only
tak
es
a
constan
t
n
um
b
er
of
premises
to
get
conclusions.
In
NAL,
all
rules
tak
e
one
or
t
w
o
judgmen
t(s)
as
premises.
Sev
eral
authors,
for
instance
P
earl
[	
],
ha
v
e
correctly
p
oin
ted
out
that
suc
h
lo
cal
rules
can
cause
problems,
for
examples
ignoring
related
information,
rep
eated
using
of
correlated
evidence,
and
so
on.
With
insucien
t
resources,
ignoring
related
information
is
inevitable
in
eac
h
inference
step.
As
long
as
the
system
can
revise
the
conclusion
when
the
related
information
is
tak
e
in
to
accoun
t
in
a
future
inference
step,
this
is
not
a
reason
to
reject
lo
cal
rules.
The
fact
that
the
system's
resources
are
insucien
t
itself
implies
the
p
ossibilit
y
of
ignoring
relev
an
t
evidence.
What
w
e
need
to
do,
when
designing
the
system,
is
not
to
mak
e
sure
that
all
relev
an
t
evidence
will
b
e
considered
when
a
question
is
answ
ered,
but
to
let
the
system
use
relev
an
t
evidence
as
m
uc
h
as
p
ossible,
under
the
constrain
ts
of
aordable
resources.
The

Revision
As
discussed
ab
o
v
e,
it
is
p
ossible
(actually
it
is
usually
the
case)
for
the
judgmen
ts
in
the
memory
of
NARS
to
conict
with
eac
h
other,
in
the
sense
that
at
a

there
are

where
the

are


Suc
h

are
caused
b
y
the
fact
that

are
based
on
dier-
en
t
sections
of
the
exp
erience
of
the
system,
sa
y
E

and
E

.
In
principle,
w
e
can
accurately
dene
the
section
of
exp
erience
that
a
judgmen
t
is
based
on:
eac
h
input
judgmen
t
is
an
atomic
section
of

and
a
deriv

t
is
based
on
the
union
of
the

sections

on
whic
h
the

are

in

is
a

According
to
the
seman
tics
of
NAL,
as
long
as
E

and
E

has
no
com-
mon
elemen
ts,
the
t
w
o
b
o
dies
of
evidence
supp
orting
the
t
w
o
judgmen
ts
are
not
c
orr
elate
d
to
eac
h
other
(that
is,
no
evidence
is
rep
eatedly
coun
ted
in
the
t
w
o
premises).
Therefore,
the
conclusion
deriv
ed
from
the
t
w
o
should
b
e
S

P

+

+
w

g;
where
the
evidence
from
dieren
t
sections
of
exp
erience
is
summarized,
or
p
o
oled
[
].
This
sounds
easy
,
but
with
insucien
t
resources,
NARS
cannot
main
tain
a
complete
record
of
related
exp
erience
for
eac
h
judgmen
t,
b
ecause
to
do
this,
w
e
ha
v
e
to
assume
that,
no
matter
ho
w
m
uc
h
space
is
required
for
the
record
(the
length
of
an
exp
erience
section
has
no
upp
er
b
ound)
and
ho
w
m
uc
h
time
is
required
for
the
pro
cessing,
it
can
alw
a
ys
b
e
satised.
Therefore
the
\correlated-evidence
recognition
problem"
cannot
b
e
com-
pletely
solv
ed
with
insucien
t
resource.
Actually
,
this
is
also
true
for
h
u-
man
b
eings:
w
e
simply
cannot
exactly
remem
b
er
all
evidence
that
supp
orts
eac
h
judgmen
t
w
e
made.
On
the
other
hand,
the
problem
m
ust
b
e
han-
dled
someho
w,
otherwise,
as
P
earl
said
in
[	
]:
in
a
bidirectional
reasoning
system,
\A
cycle
w
ould
b
e
created
where
an
y
sligh
t
evidence
in
fa
v
or
of
A
w
ould
b
e
amplied
via
B
and
fed
bac
k
to
A,
quic
kly
turning
in
to
a
stronger
conformation
(of
A
and
B
),
with
no
apparen
t
factual
justication."
What
NAL
do
es
for
the
problem
is
to
record
only
a
c
onstant
part
of
the
related
exp
erience
for
eac
h
judgmen
t,
and
use
it
to
determine
whether
t
w
o
judgmen
ts
are
based
on
correlated
evidence.

Though
not
p
erfect,
it
is
a
reasonable
solution
when
resources
are
insucien
t,
and
\reasonable
solu-
tions"
are
exactly
what
w
e
exp
ect
from
a
non-axiomatic
system.
It
is
also
similar
to
the
strategy
of
h
uman
mind,
since
w
e
usually
ha
v
e
impressions
ab
out
where
our
judgmen
ts
come
from,
but
suc
h
impressions
are
far
from
complete
and
accurate.

What

Unfortunately

this

b
ecause

The

Ho

therefore

Because

Conclusions
The
ma
jor
aim
of
this
pap
er
is
to
completely
dene
NAL.
The
detailed
comparisons
of
it
with
other
theories
are
left
for
other
pap
ers.
The
most
imp
ortan
t
con
tribution
of
NAL
is
that
it
is
designed
to
w
ork
in
a
rea-
soning
system
whic
h
is
adaptiv
e,
nite,
real-time,
and
op
en.
T
o
do
this,
ideas
including
term-orien
ted
language,
exp
erience-grounded
seman
tics,
lo-
cal
syllogistic
rules,
and
so
on,
are
in
v
en
ted
and
applied.
The
most
distinguishing
features
of
NAL
is
its
abilit
y
of
uniformly
rep-
resen
ting
and
pro
cessing
m
ultiple
t
yp
es
of
uncertain
t
y
(including
random-
ness,
fuzziness,
and
ignorance),
and
doing
m
ultiple
t
yp
es
of
inference
(in-
cluding
deduction,
induction,
ab
duction,
and
revision).
The
ma
jor
limitatio
n
of
NAL
is
its
expressiv
e
capacit
y
.
With
a
single
inheritance
relation
and
atomic
terms,
NAL
has
problems
in
represen
ting
man
y
t
yp
es
of
kno
wledge.
Ho
w
ev
er,
this
limitatio
n
b
elongs
to
NAL
only
,
rather
than
to
the
NARS
pro
ject
as
a
whole.
Actually
,
as
the
simplest
one
in
the
NAL
family
,
NAL
is
delib
erately
equipp
ed
with
a
formal
lan-
guage
that
is
as
simple
as
p
ossible.
It
is
not
designed
to
b
e
used
directly
for
practical
purp
ose,
but
to
b
e
a
protot
yp
e
b
y
whic
h
some
ideas
can
b
e
demonstrated
and
tested.
In
its
future
extensions,
other
inheritance
re-
lations
(suc
h
as
\"
and
\=")
and
structured
terms
(suc
h
as
the
unions,
in
tersections,
dierences,
and
ordinary
relations
of
terms)
will
b
e
in
tro-
duced,
and
hop
efully
the
system
will
b
ecome
comp
eten
t
in
its
expressiv
e
capacit
y
.


NAL
is
not
a
\logicist"
approac
h,
since
it
do
es
not
use
rst
order
predi-
cate
logic
and
mo
del-theoretic
seman
tics,
and
ha
v
e
non-deductiv
e
rules.
It
is
still
a
logic,
ho
w
ev
er,
in
the
sense
that
it
uses
a
domain-indep
enden
t
for-
mal
language
to
represen
t
kno
wledge,
and
uses
formal
rules
to
capture
pat-
terns
app
earing
in
h
uman
reasoning
[
].
By
naming
it
a
\Non-Axiomatic
Logic",
I
am
trying
to
sho
w
that,
from
the
viewp
oin
t
of
articial
in
telli-
gence,
the
problems
of
the
traditional
\sym
b
olic
AI"
[,
,

]
are
not
caused
b
y
the
ideas
lik
e
\formalization"
,
\sym
b
olization",
\logical
infer-
ences",
and
so
on,
but
b
y
the
ideas
lik
e
\axiomatization",
\computation",
\binary
logics",
\consisten
t
and
complete
system",
and
other
concepts
that
explicitly
or
implicitly
assume
the
suciency
of
kno
wledge
and
resources.
Curren
tly
,
the
t
w
o
classes
of
ideas
are
not
clearly
distinguished.
I
b
eliev
e
the
second
class
is
improp
er
for
AI,
but
the
rst
class
can
still
b
e
fruitful.
In
NAL,
all
judgmen
ts
are
ab
out
\to
what
exten
t
one
term
can
b
e
used
as
another",
and
all
inferences
are
ab
out
the
\can-b
e-used-as"
relation
(for-
mally
dened
as
the
inheritance
relation),
whic
h
remind
us
mathematicia
n
Ulam's
commen
t
on
logic
and
articial
in
telligence:
\It
is
the
w
ord
`as'
that
m
ust
b
e
mathematicall
y
formalized
:
:
:
Un
til
y
ou
do
that,
y
ou
will
not
get
v
ery
far
with
y
our
AI
problem".
Hofstadter
discussed
this
opinion
in
[
],
and
generalized
it
in
to
\Ulam's
thesis":
\AS
is
the
k
ey
to
AI".
NAL
can
b
e
seen
as
a
primary
step
in
this
direction.
