Instrumentation: Sensors and Transducers
•
An important component in mechatronic systems that is linked to 
instrumentation is the sensor, whose function is to provide a mechanism 
for collecting information about a particular process.
•
Sensors transform real-world data into electrical signals. The sensor may 
be defined as a device that produces an output signal for the purpose of 
sensing of a physical phenomenon. Sensors are also referred as 
transducers.
•
The extent to which sensors and transducers are used depends upon the 
level of automation and the complexity of the control system. There is 
always a need for faster, sensitive, and precise measuring devices, 
accordingly, sensors are being miniaturized in solid state form by combing 
several sensors and signal processing mechanisms.

Types of Sensors
•
Active Sensors: They require external power for their operation.
•
Passive Sensors: Examples include piezoelectric, thermoelectric, and 
radioactive.
•
Analog Sensors: They have an output that is proportional to the variable 
being measured.
•
Digital Sensors: They are accurate and precision.
•
Deflection Sensors: They are used in a physical setup where the output is 
proportional to the measured quantity that is displayed.
•
Null Sensors: In this type, any deflection due to the measured quantity is 
balanced by the opposing calibrated force so that any imbalance is detected.

Resistance Transducers
•
A displacement transducer that uses the variable resistance transduction 
principle may be manufactured with a rotary or linear potentiometer 
(rotation or displacement is converted into a potential difference). 
•
Such potentiometers consist of a wiper that makes contact with a resistive 
element, and as this point of contact moves, the resistance between the 
wiper and end leads of the device changes in proportion to the angular 
displacement.
•
Through voltage division, the change in resistance can be used to create an 
output voltage that is directly proportional to the input displacement.
wiper

Inductance Transducers
•
Inductance transducers are used 
for proximity sensing when the 
presence or absence of an object 
must 
be 
detected 
with 
an 
electronic 
non-contact 
sensor. 
They are also used for motion 
position detection, motion control, 
and process control applications.
•
Variable inductance transducers 
are based on Faraday’s law of 
induction in a coil: the induced 
voltage is equal to the rate at 
which the magnetic flux through 
the circuit changes

Temperature Effect in Strain Gage
•
The strain gauge environment is often influenced by temperature 
change. The electrical resistivity
of most alloys changes with 
temperature, increasing as temperature rises and decreasing as it falls. 
Usually metals used in strain gauges have a temperature coefficient (αo) 
on the order of 0.004/oC. The resistance at temperature T is given by

Velocity Measurement: Tachometer
•
A permanent magnet DC generator can be used for analog measurement of 
angular velocity. ω is the angular velocity to be measured, T is the torque 
required to drive the generator, L and R are the inductance and the 
capacitance of the rotor, I is the current in the rotor windings, and V is the 
voltage output at the rotor windings terminals.

Operational Amplifier
•
Operational amplifier is an amplifier whose output voltage is 
proportional to the negative of its input voltage and that boosts the 
amplitude of an input signal, many times, i.e., has a very high 
gain.High-gain amplifiers.
•
They were developed to be used in synthesizing mathematical 
operations in early analog computers, hence their name.
•
Typified by the series 741 (The integrated circuit contains 8-pin mini-
DIP, 20 transistors and 11 resistors).
•
Used for amplifications, as switches, as filters, as rectifiers, and in 
digital circuits.
•
Take advantage of large open-loop gain.
•
It is usually connected so that part of the output is fed back to the 
input.
•
Can be used with positive feedback to produce oscillation.

The Ideal and Real Op-Amp
 
Ideal Amplifier:
•
Two Inputs:
– Inverting.
– Non-inverting.
•
Vo = A (V+ - V-)
•
Gain A is large (∞).
•
Vo = 0, when V+ = V-
•
Infinite 
input 
resistance, 
which produces no currents 
at the inputs. 
•
The output resistance is 
zero, so it does not affect 
the output of the amplifier by 
loading. 
•
The gain A is independent 
of the frequency.
 
Real Amplifier:
• Gain (105 - 109).
• Input resistance
– 106 for BJTs
– 109 - 1012
• Output resistance: 100-1000 
Ω.

A Practical Application: Why Feedback
• Self-balancing mechanism, which allows the amplifier 
to preserve zero potential difference between its input 
terminals.
• A practical example that illustrates a common 
application of negative feedback is the thermostat. 
This simple temperature control system operates by 
comparing the desired ambient temperature and the 
temperature measured by the thermometer and 
turning a heat source on and off to maintain the 
difference between actual and desired temperature as 
close to zero as possible.

Protection
• There are cases where the connection of a sensor to the next 
unit can lead to the possibility of damage as a result of high 
current or high voltage. 
• The high current can be protected against by the incorporation 
in the input line of a series resistor to limit the current to 
certain level and a fuse to break if the current does exceed a 
safe level.
• High voltage and wrong polarity may be protected against by 
the use of a Zener diode circuit. Zerner diodes behave like 
ordinary diodes up to some breakdown voltage when they 
become conducting.

Filtering
The term filtering is used to describe the process of removing a certain band of 
frequencies from a signal and allowing others to be transmitted. The range of 
frequencies passed by a filter is known as the pass band. Filters are classifies 
as. The term cutoff is defined as being that at which the output voltage is 70.7% 
of that in the passband.
•
Low Pass Filter: Allows frequencies from 0 up to some frequency to 
pass.
•
High Pass Filter: Allows frequencies from some value up to infinity to 
be transmitted.
•
Band Pass Filter: Allows all the frequencies within a specified band to 
be transmitted.
•
Band-Stop Filter: Stops all frequencies within a particular band from 
being transmitted.

Digital Signal
• Analog to Digital Converter: The A/D converts the information 
from analog to digital form. Often, the time variations of the 
analog signal must be arrested with a sample-and-hold circuit 
while A/D conversion is taking place.
• Digital to Analog Converter: Often, the computer must provide 
outputs in analog form. If, for example, the data monitor were 
part of the control system, the computer might furnish analog 
signals as feedback to the controller of the process affecting the 
physical measurements.

Analog to Digital Conversion
•
ADC, 
or 
digitizing, 
converts 
analog 
waveforms 
to 
digital 
representations that can be processed and stored in digital form. 
•
The analog wave is “sampled,” or read, hundreds or thousands of times 
per second to map out the wave digitally. Digital music requires
extremely high sampling rates (44,100 samples/sec), while it is usually 
acceptable to sample voice at 11,000 samples/sec or higher. There is 
also a factor that determines the precision of the captured signal-the 
more bits used to record the value of the sampled signal, the higher its 
resolution and the better its sound when played back. 
•
However, the more bits used, the more disk space is required for
storage or bandwidth for transmission. For example, one minute of 
sampling at 44.1 kHz using 16 bits per sample requires 5.292 MB of 
disk space.

•
The telephone companies convert analog voice to digital at their
central offices for transmission across trunk lines to other central 
offices or to long-distance systems. Voice converted to digital requires 
a 64-kbit/sec channel.
•
ADCs are used in a variety of information-processing applications. 
Information collected from analog phenomena such as sound, light, 
temperature, and pressure can be digitized and made available for 
digital processing. 
•
A codec (coder/decoder) is the device that transforms the analog
signals to digital signals. The process involves sampling, quantizing, 
and digitizing. The amplitude of a signal is measured at various
intervals. The tighter these intervals, the more accurate the recording. 

ADC

Sampling Theorem
ADC samples analog signals at regular intervals and convert these values to 
binary words. The sampling rate should be at least twice that of the highest 
frequency in the analog signal that the sample gives the original signal. This 
criterion is known as the Nyquist Criterion or Shannon’s sampling theorem.

Multiplexers
•
Several analog channels are processed sequentially through a multiplexer, 
which is a digitally controlled switch. The multiplexer accepts parallel 
inputs from several channels and provides one analog output at a time for 
conversion to digital form.

Data Acquisition System
The term data Acquisition or DAQ is used for the process of taking data from 
sensors and moving them into a computer for processing. The sensors are 
connected via signal conditioning to data acquisition board which is plugged into 
the back of a computer. 
The DAQ board is a printed circuit board that, for analog inputs, basically 
provides a multiplexer, amplification, ADC, register, and control circuit so that 
the sampled digital signals are applied to the computer system.
Computer software is used to control the acquisition of data via the DAQ board. 
When the program requires an input from a particular sensor, it activates the board 
by sending a control word to the control and status register. Such a word indicates 
the type of operation the board has to carry out. As a consequence the board 
switches the multiplexer to the appropriate input channel. The signal from the 
sensor will move via the amplifier to ADC, data register and then processed by 
the computer.
In brief, data Acquisition means storing data from sensors using a microprocessor 
or a computer.
