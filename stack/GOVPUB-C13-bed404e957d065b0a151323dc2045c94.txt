LETTERS OF SUBMITTAL
Washington, October 10, 1923.
Mr. Ira H. Woolson,
Chairman, Building Code Committee,
Department of Commerce,
Washington, D.
C.
Dear Sir: We,
the undersigned, members
of the subcommittee
on plumbing, submit the following final report covering our investi-
gations of plumbing in dwelling houses.
Certain important matters not within the scope
of our instruc-
tions were considered by the committee but were not brought to a
conclusion,
namely,
tests
of
materials,
standardization
of dimen-
sions, and plumbing administration.
It
is our opinion that simplified practice and standardization
of
plumbing should be brought about by mutual agreement of interested
parties
rather
than by
detailed
legislation,
but
without
uniform
basic
regulation
standardization
of
plumbing
is
impossible.
We
have, therefore, given our chief attention to this part of the problem
and have embodied
the
results
of our
studies
in
a recommended
Code of Plumbing Rules.
It
is our opinion that important changes in present methods
of
governmental control of plumbing are needed but that these should
not be attempted
until
the
parties most
interested have had an
opportunity to discuss thoroughly not only the legal but the business
and labor problems which are involved.
In our investigations we have necessarily been obliged
to
consider
the
subject from
the
point
of view
of
sanitarian,
manufacturer,
plumber, and inspector, but in formulating the code we have endeav-
ored
to keep
first in our minds the interests
of the people whose
health may be endangered by faulty plumbing and whose comfort
will be increased by living in houses well supplied with means for
using water and for disposing of liquid wastes.
Respectfully yours,
,
George
C. Whipple, Chairman .

LETTERS OF SUBMITTAL
Washington, December 15, 1923.
Mr. George
C. Whipple,
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Plumbing of the
Department of Commerce.
Dear Sir: The report of your committee transmitted with your
letter of July 3,
1923, has been received and has been given careful
consideration by
the
individual members
of
the
Building
Code
Committee, and it is my pleasure to inform you that we are a unit
in expressing our admiration of the exhaustive treatment your com-
mittee has given to the subject assigned.
There
is abundant evidence of the thorough study given to each
phase of the subject and the earnest effort made to base your recom-
mendations upon demonstrated physical facts, unbiased by personal
opinion or the rules of existing practice.
It
is recognized that the
judgment and
experience
of your committee members
has
been
freely
exercised
in
analyzing
the
evidence produced
in
order
to
interpret its full significance and determine its value.
My committee was particularly impressed with the thorough and
comprehensive character of the original research conducted by the
Bureau
of
Standards
under
your
committee’s
direction.
Such
investigations are of great value not only for the information devel-
oped for your report, but also for
the accumulation of data useful
for comparison with subsequent similar studies.
The Building Code Committee has instructed me
to express to
your
committee
its
sincere
appreciation
of
the
excellent
service
rendered.
The report more than fulfills our expectations, and we believe
it
will prove a very valuable public document, helpful
alike to indi-
viduals and municipalities in simplifying the operations and reducing
the
cost
of
plumbing
installations,
particularly in dwelling-house
construction.
The report
will be duly transmitted
to Secretary Hoover, with
an
expression
of my committee’s
approval,
and recommendation
that it be printed for distribution.
Yours very truly,
Ira H. Woolson,
Chairman, Building Code Committee,
Department of Commerce.
Washington, December 15, 1923 .
Hon. Herbert Hoover,
Secretary of Commerce,
Washington, D.
C.
My Dear Mr. Secretary:
I have the honor to transmit here-
with the report of the subcommittee on plumbing appointed by you
to cooperate with the Building Code Committee.
The report bears
evidence of its thorough and conscientious preparation.

It is a valuable document.
The views of my committee upon the
merits of the report are briefly expressed in our letter of
acknowl-
edgment
to
the chairman

copy of which
is
attached hereto and hence need not be repeated.
The
Building
Code
Committee
respectfully
recommends
that
this report be approved and printed for public distribution as a docu-
ment of the Department of Commerce.

LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE
Department of Commerce,
Office of the Secretary,
Washington , February 11, 1924,
Mr. Ira H. Woolson,
Chairman
, Building Code Committee,
Department of Commerce,
Washington, D.
C.
Dear
Mr. Woolson:
I am indeed well
pleased with the com-
pletion of the Recommended Minimum Requirements for Plumbing
in Dwellings and Similar Buildings.
The members of the subcom-
mittee and
of the Bureau
of Standards
staff deserve the greatest
credit for their unselfish and public-spirited devotion
to the work.
Economical and sanitary plumbing systems are a vital necessity
for health in
all settled communities and are hardly less essential in
rural
households.
Although
the American
people have expended
hundreds of millions of dollars for plumbing installations, the prin-
ciples of their general layout have never been thoroughly understood.
Actual practice has been governed by opinions and guesswork, often
involving needless costly precautions which many families could
ill
afford.
The lack of generally recognized principles is responsible to
a certain extent for the contradictory plumbing regulations in differ-
ent localities.
Thanks
to
the work of the subcommittee and
of the Bureau* of
Standards, the whole situation
is
altered, and there
is now a scien-
tific basis upon which State and local codes and
small-dwelling in-
stallations may be based.
The way is opened for effective standardization of plumbing sup-
plies, with reduced costs to the industry and savings to the consumer.
The subcommittee achieved these fine results by enlisting the aid
of the voluntary professional and commercial
associations
to which
its members
are attached and
of public
officials,
engineers, manu-
facturers, and representatives of workers, who willingly gave their
time and services in helping to
arrive at conclusions
in accordance
with the most varied experience.
The experimental work necessary
was performed with the utmost economy on account of the
ability
of
the Bureau
of Standards
staff,
the
contributions
of materials
by manufacturers
and
the
assistance
given by members
of
the
subcommittee.
The report stands as a credit to leading men in the industry and
in public regulation.
Prompt recognition of
its principles by local
authorities and by the plumbing industry generally
is forecast by
advices
that have reached
this department, and such
action
will
mean cheaper and better sanitation for the American people.
Yours faithfully,
Herbert Hoover,

RECOMMENDED MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PLUMBING
*
Report of Subcommittee on Plumbing of the Building Code Committee
PART I.—INTRODUCTION—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
In May,
1921, there was organized in the Department
of Com-
merce a group of architects and engineers experienced in matters of
building regulation,
to be known as the Department of Commerce
Building Code Committee.
Investigations by several agencies, and
particularly by the Senate Committee on Reconstruction and Pro-
duction, had disclosed that prevailing inactivity in the building in-
dustries was due in part
to unnecessarily restrictive building code
requirements, and that under normal conditions great economic loss
resulted from lack of uniformity and justice in such regulations.
The Building Code Committee proceeded
to gather information
upon
which minimum
code
requirements
governing
the
various
phases
of building construction might be based.
These
are being
issued in the form of ordinances recommended for adoption by those
writing or revising building codes.
Early in
its work the committee undertook as a part of its pro-
gram
the formulation
of rules
for the plumbing
of small dwelling
houses.
Data regarding present practice were secured,
and,
in
re-
sponse to a questionnaire, the opinions of plumbers, sanitary engi-
neers, and others in regard to some
of the mooted questions were
obtained.
It soon became evident that the problem could not be
solved satisfactorily by the questionnaire method, and that instead
of mere opinions there should be conclusions deduced logically from
scientific
evidence
obtained
by
experiment
and
experience.
The
committee therefore decided to have the Bureau of Standards inves-
tigate the underlying
principles
of house drainage under the gen-
eral supervision of a subcommittee of experienced sanitary engineers
and
plumbers.
This
subcommittee
was
appointed
by
Secretary
Hoover in September, 1921, as follows:
George C. Whipple ,
1 chairman, professor of sanitary engineering in Harvard
University, Cambridge, Mass.
American Society of Civil Engineers.
American Public Health Association (fellow).
American Water Works Association.
New England Water Works Association.
American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
American Chemical Society.
Royal Sanitary Institute (honorary fellow).
1 Professor Whipple died Nov. 27, 1924.
The first edition of the report was completed under his leader-
ship.
The report in its present form preserves all the basic principles established at that time but differs
in the extension of those principles to larger structures.

MODE OF PROCEDURE
Several meetings were held for planning and discussion of the tests
which were
carried on
at the Bureau
of Standards.
At the
first
meeting Secretary Hoover received the members of the subcommittee
and explained in a general way his hopes in regard to the solution of
the problem, emphasizing especially the benefits which should result
from simplified practice in plumbing as well as in other branches of
industry.

whom was delegated the task of conducting the experimental work.
TENTATIVE REPORT
On June
17,
1922,
a preliminary
report was submitted
to
the
chairman
of
the
Building Code Committee,
stating
the
tentative
conclusions
of
the committee
at
that time
and
briefly
describing
the experimental work at the Bureau of Standards.
This tentative
report was signed by
all
of the members
of the committee except
William J. Spencer, who presented a minority report favoring individ-
ual venting for traps but concurred in the rest of the tentative report.
(See p. 225.)
One thousand copies
of the tentative report were distributed in
all parts of the country among sanitary engineers, plumbers,
archi-
tects, manufacturers, plumbing inspectors, and others whose experi-
ence qualified them to discuss plumbing matters with authority, with
a request for
critical
discussion
of the proposed requirements.
In
response nearly 200 communications were
received,
discussing the
subject from all points of view and bringing to bear a vast amount of
practical experience and operating data.
The discussions and
criti-
cisms
thus* obtained were found much more valuable than usually
result from the ordinary questionnaire method of obtaining informa-
tion.
The tentative report afforded a focus for criticisms and sug-
gestions, and the recommendations of the committee have been revised
in the light of the information thus received.
It is worthy of note
that approval of the majority report on the part of those who
dis-
cussed
its
provisions was
quite
general.
More than
half
of
the
respondents
approved
the
tentative
findings
unconditionally,
and
many more had only minor criticisms or suggestions to make.
Very
few of the correspondents supported the contention of the minority
report.
The
letters received indicated that some matters had not been
made sufficiently
clear, and the committee took pains in preparing
the final report to
clarify these doubtful points.
Where the treat-
ment of any particular question evoked considerable
criticism,
the
reasons for the final conclusions of the committee were stated in a
series of notes to be found in chapter 10.
The final report also was
influenced by the results of much additional experimental work at
the United States Bureau of Standards, completed since the tentative
report was distributed,

INTRODUCTION
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
REVISION OF FINAL REPORT
The committee reassembled in the spring of 1928
to review the
effect of its recommendations during the past five years and to con-
sider
whether
any
changes
seemed
to
be
indicated.
In
a
very
extensive use that had developed, the only major need for revision
seemed to be with respect to the sizes of drains, stacks, and vents in
high buildings.
Its
original work had been concentrated on prob-
lems arising in dwellings and similar buildings, and the recommenda-
tions for other structures had been quite incidental.
In response to
a well-defined demand for the most economical requirements possible
in
the
case
of high
buildings,
the members reviewed
all
available
information both on the side of theoretical calculations and on instal-
lations that had given no trouble in actual use.
As a result,
it has
felt warranted in giving requirements somewhat modified from those
mentioned in the previous report.
The committee feels that these
requirements are the best that can be arrived at in the present state
of knowledge of the subject, but that a comprehensive program of
experimentation should be undertaken as soon as possible to deter-
mine whether even more
economical
installations
are
practicable.
It has recommended that such a program be undertaken by the Bureau
of Standards.
LOCAL CONDITIONS
Although the findings of this report are believed to be based on
sound
general
principles,
nevertheless
the
committee
• recognizes
that in a large country like the United States, which includes wide
differences of climate and living conditions, situations will occasionally
be found which will justify modification of the practices recommended.
No attempt has been made to outline these special situations.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The committee wishes
to express
its sincere appreciation
of the
cooperation extended by the Bureau
of Standards under direction
of Dr.
S. W. Stratton and Dr. George K. Burgess.
Measures for
the
furtherance
of
its
investigations have been prompt and
ade-
quate.
Especial commendation should be given to Dr. R. B. Hunter
for his ingenious and accurate physical investigations of the hydraulics
and pneumatics
of
drainage systems under
various
conditions
of
use.
Acknowledgment is made of the valuable cooperation extended
by the great number of engineers, plumbing inspectors and plumbers,
architects, and others who have furnished data, reviewed the tenta-
tive recommendations, and have otherwise exhibited interest in the
work.

CHAPTER
1.—REGULATION OF PLUMBING
DEFINITION OF PLUMBING
The
“ plumbing”
of a building,
as the term
is commonly used,
includes the pipes for distributing the water supply, the fixtures for
using
water,
and
drainage
pipes
for removing
waste
water
and
sewage, together with fittings and appurtenances
of various kinds,
all within or adjacent to the building.
The “ service pipe/’ which
forms the connection between the water main and the building, and
the “house sewer,” which conveys the waste water and sewage from
the building to the street sewer or other point of disposal, are included
in the “plumbing system” of a building, using the term in a broader
sense.
Connections for rain water are also included
if the water is
discharged
through
a house sewer
or
a house
drain.
The water
supply and drainage system
are mutually dependent.
Drains
are
needed to carry away the used water; water is needed to cleanse the
fixtures and transport solid wastes.
The work of the committee has emphasized the necessity of con-
sidering the plumbing systems of buildings as intimately related to
and forming an integral part of public water-supply and sewerage
systems.
The number
and
character
of
plumbing
fixtures
in
a
building are largely matters of individual choice, and owners have
not sufficiently considered their relation to features of public service.
Plumbing fixtures are the
terminals
of water-supply systems,
and,
to a large extent, control the quantity of water used.
At the same
time they are the beginnings of the sewerage system.
The aggregate
discharges from plumbing fixtures determine the flow in sewers and
the volume
of sewage reaching the
outfall,
this volume materially
affecting the cost of any pumping or treatment of the sewage.
It is
evident, therefore, that the public interest may well justify a certain
degree of governmental control over plumbing fixtures as affecting
both the quantity of water available for public use and the economical
operation of the sewerage system.
RELATION OF PLUMBING TO HEALTH
An important function
of the house-drainage system
is to carry
away from plumbing fixtures human excreta and wastes which may
contain disease-producing bacteria.
Because of the possible presence
of such organisms sewage may be dangerous and must be disposed of
in such a manner that there will be no chance of disease transmission.
Sanitarians to-day place great emphasis on the importance of sewage
treatment and safe methods of ultimate sewage disposal.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
The leakage of polluted water from the house-drainage system
is
insanitary and dangerous.
Leakage "within the house may pollute
the habitation and permit food
infection through
the medium
of
insects.
Leakage
in
the
ground
outside
the
house may
pollute
water supplies taken from neighboring wells
or find its way into or
under the building.
The maintenance
of water seals between
fix-
tures and drains and the permanent tightness of plumbing systems
arc important not only because they prevent the passage of air, but
because they prevent
the
access
of
insects
to
the
interior
of the
drains and sewers.
If cockroaches, water bugs, and other vermin
can pass from drains to food, they may transport disease germs, and
thus be a bacteriological menace to health.
It is therefore important
that the drainage system be tight and without danger of leakage.
L. O. Howard, chief of the Bureau of Entomology of the United
States Department
of Agriculture, and
C. W.
Stiles, United States
Public Health Service, in personal conversation with the late chairman
of the committee, are authority for the statement that insects can and
do pass from the interior of leaking drainage systems to living quar-
ters.
Several other observers
also report such occurrences.
Another danger
to be guarded against
is the use
of fixtures in
which the "water supply and waste connections are so arranged that
polluted waste water from the fixtures may, under certain circum-
stances, return into the water-supply pipes.
The line where the safe water supply ends and sewage begins
is
sometimes very finely drawn.
If faucets with open spouts discharge
over plumbing fixtures and if there is a break between the water sup-
ply and the waste pipe, self-protection exists against possible pollution
of the water-supply distributing system by the back flow of waste
water into it.
Plumbing fixtures such as water-closets, urinals, bidets,
bathtubs, and lavatories with direct connections, secret wastes and
overflows, and combination cocks offer possible sources of pollution.
The air in sewers and drains often contains gases resulting from
the decomposition of excreta, soap, fats, and other wastes, together
with gases from mineral oils which may come from garages, streets,
and industrial establishments.
Illuminating gas may
also find
its
way into sewers through leakage.
Among these gases may be found
methane,
sulphuretted
hydrogen,
and
carbonic
oxide.
In
large
amounts those gases are poisonous to the human system, and there
are physiological objections to breathing them even in small quan-
tities.
Hence, the air of sewers or drains should be kept from enter-
ing buildings intended for human habitation or occupancy by the
use of proper plumbing installations and by suitable ventilation of
the rooms or compartments in which the plumbing fixtures are located.
The smell
of these gases and other emanations from decomposing
organic matter is naturally repugnant to human beings.
It not only

REGULATION OF PLUMBING
7
offends the
sensibilities, but may produce shallow breathing, head-
ache, and even nausea.
In
addition
to
the above
facts,
it
is important
to
consider
the
bacteriological aspects of sewer and drain
air, a subject upon which
there
has
been
some
misunderstanding.
In
recent years bac-
teriologists have made studies which have thrown light upon
this
subject.
They have shown by experiment that while sewage often
contains
disease-producing
bacteria
derived from human
excreta
and body wastes these bacteria are rarely found in the
air which
escapes from sewers and drains.
Hence, it has been argued by some
that escaping sewer air has no influence on health.
The committee
does not agree with
this conclusion.
Health may be influenced by
factors which do not cause specific diseases,
for
there
are chemical
and physiological as well as bacteriological factors involved.
The
investigations thus far made by bacteriologists should be considered
to be merely a beginning of larger and more complete investigations
which
will
doubtless be made
as
the science
of bacteriology
ad-
vances.
The
committee
is
of
the
opinion,
therefore,
that
until
further light on
this somewhat obscure subject has been obtained
the escape of sewer air from the house-drainage system, at frequent
intervals or in considerable quantities,
threatens the health of the
building’s occupants.
This whole matter has a quantitative as well as a qualitative aspect.
The temporary losses of water seal in traps, which rarely occur and
which are immediately replaced, do not involve any great danger to
the health of the occupants, for in many cases the final drainage from
the fixture will renew the seal within a short time, but where a loss
of seal is likely to be of frequent occurrence and not readily replaced,
or where breaks in the system admit sewer air continually to a build-
ing, the health of the occupants is subject to the dangers heretofore
described.
PUBLIC CONTROL OF PLUMBING JUSTIFIABLE
For the above-mentioned reasons regulations governing the installa-
tion
of plumbing have been
established by law
in many
places.
These regulations have been potent in improving living conditions
throughout the country; in fact, they have even set the standards
for those places where plumbing
is not under public control.
The
knowledge now in possession of sanitarians in regard to the lessened
bacteriological dangers of sewer
air leads logically to some simpli-
fication in plumbing design, but
it should not lead to an abandon-
ment of practices necessary to protect buildings against the
air of
drains, which, in addition to its possible danger,
is offensive to the
smell.
The committee believes that good plumbing
is
a matter which
concerns health.
Government has the right to protect the people’s

8
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
health,
blit people
also have rights, and plumbing regulations car-
ried too far are unjust.
Regulations which will not be supported by
the courts fully and without question under a liberal interpretation
of the police power may be regarded as unjust.
Sanitary science,
however, must be the guide to justice in this matter.
The principles
of science change as knowledge advances, and it is proper, therefore,
that plumbing regulations be reviewed from time
to time and,
if
necessary, revised.
LEGAL PRINCIPLES
It is impossible to study the subject of plumbing regulation with-
out having a proper conception of the common-law principle known
as u police power,” for, though a part of the common law and without
absolutely definite limits,
it can and must control
court
decisions,
without which plumbing
regulations would
be
futile.
Attention
should be called to the fact that this legal term “ police power” does
not mean the power of a policeman.
It is true that the policeman,
with his uniform and his stick, is one agency for enforcing the “ police
power,” but plumbing inspectors, building inspectors,
fire marshals,
and health officers also act under the same “ police power.”
Police
power
is
that
inherent power
of government which
protects
the
people against harmful acts
of individuals, in so far as matters
of
safety, health, morals, or the like are concerned.
“ Police power” is
“ community
power.”
Injuries
against
health
come
within
the
proper scope of the police power; but acts of government to enhance
or promote health above normal, while
laudable and often justifi-
able, do not fall within the scope of the police power.
There is a difference between conferring a benefit and preventing
an
injury,
which,
though
difficult
to
define,
is
nevertheless
real.
Some of the requirements now generally included in plumbing codes
represent a failure to make this distinction properly and can not be
justified as essential to the protection of the public health from injury.
When there is difficulty in enforcing such regulations and the cases
are brought into court, it often happens that the code requirements
are not supported.
In this way well-meaning citizens comply with
regulations which can not be enforced upon the unwilling citizen, and
injustice results.
Unfortunately, this situation exists to-day.
Plumb-
ing regulations, therefore, should be carefully examined in the light
of modern sanitary science and accepted legal principles to determine
their legality, keeping in mind that in so far as they protect the
human health
against injury they
are
justifiable, but no
farther.
It should be observed also that legally the police power has to do
with “health,” not merely the “ public health.”
This is a distinction
which even a health officer often fails to make.
The following principles may be considered as safe guides in the
matter of governmental control:

REGULATION OF PLUMBING
9
1. The control
of plumbing by government
is
distinctly an
act
done under the police power, because it has to do with protection of
the health of the people against injury, using this term in its broad
and popular sense.
2.
This use of the police power resides fundamentally in the State
governments, but may be and often is delegated to cities, towns, or
other subdivisions of States.
3. The police power has not been delegated to the Federal Govern-
ment, except so far as needed to cany out certain delegated powers
(as,
for example, quarantine); hence,
the Federal Government has
only advisory powers regarding its employment by States.
4. The use of the police power in plumbing regulations is justified
on the theory, supported by scientific evidence, that the passage of
rats, cockroaches, water bugs, and other vermin in and out of drains,
or the escape of sewage or of
air from drains or sewers into occupied
human dwellings, are menaces to health, using this term in its broad
and popular sense.
5. Plumbing
regulations
can
not
legally contain
requirements
which do not, either directly or indirectly, prevent injury to health,
safety, morals,
or the
like.
No requirements can legally be made
which have
to
do
merely
with
economies
of
construction,
with
benefits to the house owner or occupants, or with benefits to manu-
facturers, traders, or laborers, for the right and only legal use of the
police power is to protect against injury.
6. The design of plumbing systems is properly within the scope of
legal regulation in so far as
it has to do with the escape of solids,
liquids, or gases from, or the access of vermin and insects to drains and
sewers, in such a way as to endanger health, and in so far as a safe
and adequate supply of water to the fixtures is concerned.
7. Plumbing materials are properly subject to legal regulation in
so far as their reliability in preventing dangers to health is concerned,
looking ahead to a reasonable life of the building.
8.
Methods
of
plumbing
construction
are
properly
subject
to
legal regulation in so far as they may be necessary to guard against
danger to health through faulty workmanship.
9. The control of plumbing by the system of permit and inspection
and test is a logical and apparently a satisfactory way of guarding
against injury
to health through faulty plumbing; but in view
of
different
conditions
existing
in
large and
small
communities
the
States should delegate to local communities the manner of adminis-
trating this control.
10. The system of examining plumbers is for the public benefit and
should be continued, but it might be better for the examining authori-
ties to issue certificates of competency rather than “licenses.”
11. The requirement that plumbing work, subject to permit and
inspection, be done by
licensed plumbers
is
justifiable under
the
police power.

10
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
12. Uniformity in methods
of plumbing
control
is
desirable,
as
it makes for convenience and economy.
Uniformity can be secured
by following models set up by Federal or State governments.
13. Standardization
of plumbing designs,
so far as dimensioning
is concerned, standardization of plumbing materials, and even stand-
ardization
of
code requirements
are for the
public benefit, rather
than for protection against injury, and should be brought about by
agreement and concerted action.
They can not be required legally
under the police power.
14. As the police power resides in State governments and as uni-
formity in plumbing regulation is for the public benefit, it is well for
all States to have simple, uniform, State-wide plumbing regulations
alike in essential respects, limited
to matters which properly come
within the scope of the police power under a wide range of conditions,
with provision for permitting local communities to regulate installa-
tion and inspection by such methods as they see fit to adopt.
These
may be appropriately called “ basic plumbing principles.”
15. The residence or dwelling is the basis for plumbing codes, be-
cause the majority of
all buildings are of this type.
A code appli-
cable
to dwellings
is
also
applicable, although not necessarily suf-
ficient, for other classes of buildings.
Buildings differ as to plumb-
ing
conditions, so that
different regulations
for
different
classes
of
buildings are fully justified under the police power.
In fact, to apply
the same
regulations
to
different
conditions;
that
is,
to
require
practices necessary in one case for another case where they are not
necessary,
is an improper use of the police power.
The fourteenth
amendment
to the
Constitution
of the United States provides for
“ equal protection
of the law,” but equal protection means under
like circumstances.
16. In addition to the basic plumbing principles, it is well for each
State to adopt a code of plumbing rules conforming substantially to
that hereinafter recommended, which has been so drawn that compli-
ance
therewith
will
practically
assure
compliance with
the
basic
plumbing principles.
17.
It
is a well-established principle in drawing specifications for
works which involve operation that guaranteed results and detailed
methods
of construction should not both be specified
at the same
time.
If
certain guaranteed
results
are demanded,
the contractor
should be
allowed some
latitude
in
construction,
and
if
detailed
methods of construction are specified, it should be expected that the
desired results will follow as a matter of course.
Similarly,
if reli-
ance is placed on a general code of basic plumbing principles, there
should obviously be freedom of choice as to many details; whereas
if cities or towns choose to adopt a more rigid and detailed set of re-
quirements
compliance
with
them
should
be
regarded
as
prima
facie evidence that the desired results will be obtained.

CHAPTER 2.—PRESENT STATUS OF PLUMBING
REGULATIONS
The committee has
collected a large number of plumbing codes,
State
laws,
and
local
ordinances
and
given them
careful
study.
The situation may be described as chaotic.
1
Some States have no laws which regulate plumbing other than
local
enactments.
A few
States have Xnandatory plumbing laws
state-wide
in
scope.
Some have laws mandatory
for
cities
of
a
certain
size
or for
cities and towns having public water
supplies.
Others
require
cities
to
adopt
ordinances
regulating
plumbing.
Still
others have permissive
acts.
There
is an utter lack
of uni-
formity in legal procedure governing these matters.
In
the
matter
of
administration some
cities
and some
States
require master plumbers and journeymen to be licensed, but some
cities do not require licenses even though there are plumbing ordi-
nances.
The method of permit and inspection
is almost universal,
where there is any regulation at
all, but sometimes the inspection is
under a board
of health, sometimes under a building department,
occasionally
under
a
special
plumbing
inspector,
and,
in
a
few
instances, under a water department.
In
the matter
of codes
the lack
of uniformity
is even
greater.
Some State
codes
are simple
in
their provisions;
others
set forth
rules
of plumbing
practice
in
great
detail.
In many
States
the
different
cities have
different
codes.
In one State there
is
a per-
missive State code,
as well as many city codes resulting from local
enactments.
Going further into detail, it is found that there are unaccountable
differences in the regulations.
Thus, in one State, where the whole
subject
of plumbing has
recently been under
investigation, some
cities require the use of the running trap, other near-by cities pro-
hibit its use, and some allow its use to be optional with the owner.
Minor
differences
in regulations
in
different parts
of
the country
may sometimes be justified on account of different climatic or local
conditions, but the many radical differences found in the cities of a
single State are unjustifiable.
Nearly
all
of
the
present plumbing
codes
are
applied
in
their
entirety to all of the buildings within the limits of
their jurisdiction.
Compiled originally for dwellings, they have been extended to other
types
of buildings, but proper discrimination has not always been
made between high and low buildings, single or multiple, public or
private,
or between
buildings
used
for
different
purposes.
It
is
1 The situation outlined in chapter 2 was that existing at the time of the committee’s first report in 1923,
Considerable improvement has been effected, but to a large extent the description is still applicable to-day.
11

12
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
natural, perhaps, that codes should have developed in a rigid way,
because the
first code drawn was based on
the requirements
of a
single
city.
Subsequent codes have been influenced by precedent,
local pride, and selfish prejudice.
Many codes have been established
by copying other codes.
Prejudice in favor of this or that method
of construction has brought about unnecessary differences.
SUPERVISION OF PLUMBING INSPECTION
There
is frequently a lack
of coordination between the different
municipal departments which, in one way or another, are concerned
with plumbing, namely, the departments of health, fire, water, sewers,
buildings, and streets.
Under prevailing arrangements the owner or
plumbing contractor must often obtain several permits from different
city authorities and arrange for inspection by several men in order to
comply fully with the regulations.
For example, he may be obliged
to go to the department of public works for permission to cut the
pavement and for an inspector to see that the
fill is property made,
to the city engineer for line and grade of the sewer, to the city engi-
neer and health officer for permission to make connections with the
sewer, to the division of water supply for permission to make water
connection, and to the plumbing inspector for approval of his plumb-
ing installation.
CONCLUSIONS BASED ON SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURE
Because of the irregularities and incongruities in plumbing codes
the committee has not attempted to formulate minimum plumbing
requirements by any method of selection or by any averaging process
based on
existing
codes.
Instead,
the committee has studied the
entire problem anew and has based
its conclusions for buildings on
legal principles and the applications of modern science, but has kept
in mind existing conditions in order that suggested changes may not
be great enough to cause serious inconvenience.

CHAPTER 3.—BASIC PLUMBING PRINCIPLES
The committee has given consideration to the formulation of a set
of basic plumbing principles so general in scope and so fundamental
in character as to be worthy of adoption by State, city, or town as a
basis for its sanitary law.
These have been drawn on the principle
of specifying the results
desired, making provision for testing the
plumbing work to ascertain if the results are likely to be secured, but
not attempting to specify details of construction.
These requirements are not regarded as sufficient for all cities, but
the committee is of the opinion that States should adopt them on a
state-wide mandatory basis or should give to cities, towns, or other
subdivisions the power to choose between them and the more detailed
plumbing code hereinafter recommended.
These principles were adopted by the committee early in its work
as embodying the fundamental sanitary considerations which suc-
cessful plumbing systems must satisfy.
They have been utilized as
a guide, both in directing the investigational work and in formulating
recommendations.
In adopting these
basic plumbing
principles
the committee has
endeavored to keep in mind differences in climate in different parts
of the country, differences in buildings, in methods of sewerage and
sewage
disposal,
in
disposal
of
rain
water,
and
other
differences.
Some of the details of plumbing construction must vary with these
conditions, but the basic sanitary principles
are the same and the
results desired and necessary to protect the health of the people are
the same everywhere.
These principles are stated in the following pages.
Explanations
of the reasons for their adoption and of their application to conditions
met with in practice are given in the notes in chapter 10.
In making
these explanatory notes the committee has given careful considera-
tion to the questions raised by those who have reviewed the tentative
report and has attempted to deal with the considerations naturally
arising when the adoption of such basic principles is under discussion.
1. All premises intended for human habitation or occupancy shall
be provided with a supply of pure and wholesome water, neither con-
nected
with
unsafe
water
supplies
nor
cross
connected
through
plumbing fixtures to the drainage system.
2. Buildings in which water-closets
and other plumbing fixtures
exist shall be provided with a supply of water adequate in volume and
pressure for flushing purposes.
3. The pipes conveying water to water-closets shall be of sufficient
size
to supply the water
at a rate required for adequate flushing
without unduly reducing the pressure at other fixtures.
13

14
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
4. Devices for heating water and storing
it in “boilers,”
or hot-
water
tanks,
shall be
so
designed and
installed
as
to prevent
all
dangers from explosion and
also prevent a back flow of hot water
through a meter connected with a public water supply.
5. Every building intended
for human habitation
or occupancy
on premises abutting on a street in which there
is a public sewer
shall have a connection with the
sewer, and,
if possible, a separate
connection.
6. In multiple dwellings provided with a house drainage system
there shall be for each family at least one private water-closet.
7. Plumbing fixtures shall be made
of smooth nonabsorbent ma-
terial,
shall be
free from concealed fouling
surfaces, and
shall be
set free of inclosures.
8. The
entire house drainage system
shall be so
designed,
con-
structed, and maintained as to conduct the waste water or sewage
quickly from
the
fixture
to
the
place
of
disposal with
velocities
which will guard against fouling and the deposit of solids and will
prevent clogging.
9. The drainage pipes shall be so designed and constructed as to
be proof for a reasonable life of the building against leakage of water
or drain air due to defective materials, imperfect connections, corro-
sion, settlements or vibrations of the ground or building, temperature
changes, freezing, or other causes.
10. The
drainage
system
shall be
provided
with
an
adequate
number of cleanouts so arranged that in case of stoppage the pipes
may be readily accessible.
11. Each fixture or combination fixture shall be provided with a
separate,
accessible, seK-scouring, reliable water-seal trap placed as
near to the fixture as possible.
12. The house-drainage system shall be so designed that there will
be an adequate circulation of air in all pipes and no danger of siphon-
age, aspiration, or forcing of trap seals under conditions of ordinary
use.
13. The soil stack shall extend full size upward through the roof
and have a free opening,
the roof terminal being so located
that
there will be no danger of air passing from it to any window and no
danger of clogging of the pipe by frost or by articles being thrown
into it or of roof water draining into it.
14. The plumbing system
shall be subjected
to a water
or
air
pressure test and to a final air-pressure test in such a manner as to
disclose all leaks and imperfections in the work.
15. No substances which
will
clog
the
pipes, produce explosive
mixtures,
or destroy the pipes
or
their
joints
shall be allowed
to
enter the house-drainage system.

BASIC PLUMBING PRINCIPLES
15
16.
Refrigerators,
ice boxes,
or receptacles for storing food
shall
not be connected directly with the drainage system.
17. No water-closet shall be located in a room or compartment
which is not properly lighted and ventilated to the outer air.
18.
If water-closets or other plumbing fixtures exist in buildings
where there is no sewer within reasonable distance, suitable provision
shall be made for disposing of the house sewage by some method of
sewage treatment and disposal satisfactory to the health authority
having jurisdiction.
19. Where a house-drainage system may be
subjected
to back
flow of sewage, suitable provision shall be made to prevent its over-
flow in the building.
20. Plumbing systems shall be maintained in a sanitary condition.


PART II.-—CHAPTER 4—RECOMMENDED PLUMBING CODE
As
a
result of
its investigations the committee has drafted
the
following code of minimum requirements for plumbing.
Starting with the fundamental principle that plumbing regulations
are applications of the police power in the interest of health, two
ideas have been kept steadily in mind—simplification and standardi-
zation.
Early
studies showed
the
futility
of attempting
to
bring
about complete standardization by law.
Apart from questionable
legality was the insuperable difficulty of including in a code the in-
numerable items that w*ouid be necessary.
The committee’s attitude
in regard to the subject of standardization is set forth in chapter 8.
On the other hand, an attempt to simplify plumbing regulations by
eliminating
all items which are in the nature of specifications would
reduce them practically to the list of basic principles given in chapter
3.
The code recommended is a compromise between the two extreme
ideas.
It is shorter than some of the codes now being used, curtail-
ments having been made in the interest of simplicity; it is longer than
some, details having been included with a view to bringing to pass a
certain amount of standardization.
It is hoped that its requirements
of design, coupled with its detailed structural requirements, will result
not only in cheaper and better plumbing, but in a fairer and more uni-
form administration.
A study of the recommended code will show
that its length is due quite as much to its detailed classification as to
its subject matter, brevity being sacrificed for the sake of clearness.
Attention should be called to the fact that the code, as
originally
presented, was drawn primarily for dwelling houses, although most
of its provisions applied to any sort of building.
With slight modi-
fications
required
to
adapt
it
to
local
administrative
conditions,
the committee believes that its adoption in its present form by States
and
municipalities
will tend
to
bring order out
of the chaos
still
existing.
In Article III, which covers the subject of quality and weight of
plumbing materials, references are made
to standard specifications
adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials, instead of
writing these
detailed requirements into
the code, but
for the
in-
formation of persons studying this report the specifications referred
to are given in Appendix D.
In the case of lead pipe, no specifica-
tions have yet been adopted by the American Society for Testing
Materials, and, therefore, detailed weights are inserted in the code.
The idea
of the committee
is
that codes adopted throughout the
country shall require that plumbing materials conform to prevailing
standards
of good
practice,
and
that
an
association
of
technical
experts is better qualified to establish such standards and revise them
as manufacturing arts progress than the State or municipal legisla-
tive authorities responsible for the plumbing code.

drain,
soil,
or waste
stacks.
When such pipe does
not connect
directly with
a house
drain or soil stack, it is termed a special waste.
Sec.

For V/i and
inch wastes the
vent shall be of the same diameter as the waste pipe, and in no case
shall a branch or main vent have a diameter less than one-half that of
the
soil or waste pipe served, and in no case shall the length
of
a
branch vent of given diameter exceed the maximum length permitted
for the main vent serving the same size soil or vent stack.
Sec. 105. Vent-Pipe
Grades
and
Connections.—All vent and
branch vent pipes shall be free from drops or sags and be so graded
and connected as to drip back to the soil or waste pipe by gravity.
Where vent pipes connect to a horizontal soil or waste pipe, the vent
branch shall be taken off above the center line of the pipe, and the
vent pipe must rise vertically or at an angle of 45° to the vertical
to a point 6 inches above the fixture
it
is venting before offsetting
horizontally or connecting to the branch, main waste, or soil vent.
Sec. 106. Circuit and Loop Vents.—A circuit or loop vent will
be permitted as follows: A branch
soil or waste pipe to which two
and not more than eight water-closets, pedestal urinals, trap standard
slop sinks, or shower stalls are connected in the series may be vented
by a circuit or loop vent, which shall be taken off in front of the last
fixture
connection.
Where
fixtures
discharge
above
such
branch,
each branch
shall be provided with
a
relief one-half the diameter
of the soil or waste stack, taken off in front of the first fixture con-
nection.
Sec. 107. Vents not Required.—No vents
will be required on
a down spout or rain leader trap, a back-water trap, a subsoil catch
basin trap, or on a cellar floor drain, provided the cellar floor drain
branches into the house drain on the sewer side
at a distance of 5
feet or more from the base of the stack.
Where bathrooms or water-closets or other fixtures are located on
opposite sides of a wall or partition or directly adjacent to each other
within the prescribed
distance, such fixtures may have
a common
soil or waste pipe and common vent.

If applied
to the
entire system,
all openings in the piping
44

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
45
shall be tightly closed, except the highest opening above the roof and
the system filled with water to the point of overflow above the roof.
If the system
is tested in sections, each opening shall be tightly
plugged, except the highest opening of the section under
test, and
each section shall be filled with water; but no section shall be tested
with less than a 10-foot head of water or a 5-pound pressure of air.
In testing successive sections at least the upper 10 feet of the next
preceding section shall be retested, so that no joint or pipe in the
building shall have been submitted to a test of less than a 10-foot
head of water or a 5-pound pressure of air.
Under any test the water or air pressure shall remain constant for
not less than 15 minutes without any further addition of water or air.
(ib ) Air test .—The air test shall be made by attaching the air com-
pressor or
test apparatus
to any
suitable opening and
closing
all
other inlets and outlets to the system, then forcing air into the sys-
tem until there
is a uniform pressure sufficient to balance a column
of mercury 10 inches in height or 5 pounds per square inch on the
entire system.
This pressure shall be maintained for 15 minutes.
(c)
Final
air
test —The
air machine
shall be connected
to any
suitable opening or outlet and an air pressure equivalent to
1 inch
water column shall be applied and left standing at least 15 minutes.
If there is no leakage or forcing of trap seals indicated by the fluctu-
ation of the drum, float,, or water column, the system shall be deemed
air-tight.
Sec.
142. Order of Tests.—The tests may be made separately,
as follows
(a) The house sewer and
all
its branches from the property line

PART III.—EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, STANDARD*
IZATION, ADMINISTRATION, AND COMMENTS
CHAPTER 5.—EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
One of the chief reasons for appointing the committee on plumbing
was the manifest need
of a
carefully planned investigation
of the
scientific principles of plumbing systems.
In spite of many experi-
mental investigations which have been made in England, Germany,
and the United States, some of the latter being of recent date, there
is a widespread feeling that the subject
is
still imperfectly under-
stood, and that some
of the present-day plumbing regulations are
without an adequate scientific foundation.
The committee, therefore,
welcomed the
opportunity
of having
a
scientific study
of house-
drainage systems made under its direction by the Bureau of Stand-
ards.
The results have thoroughly justified this course.
Through the courtesy of Dr. S. W. Stratton, then Director of the
Bureau of Standards, and Dr. L.
J. Briggs, chief of the engineering
physics division, accommodations were provided at the laboratories
of the Bureau of Standards in Washington, and Dr. R. B. Hunter
and L. W. Snyder were assigned to the work.
The investigations
were begun
in
November,
1921,
and
were
pursued
continuously
imtil January, 1923.
The original intention of the committee was to begin with vertical
stacks and the simple elements
of plumbing, combine these in an
orderly and
progressive way, and study the hydraulic and pneu-
matic principles, proceeding from simple low systems to higher and
more complex layouts.
Necessity for haste in the solution of certain
problems applicable to the types of small dwellings under considera-
tion by the Building Code Committee caused this plan to be deferred
and led to tests of certain concrete examples of plumbing installation
suitable for one-story one-family dwellings, and for two-story one-
family and two-family dwellings.
Wherever possible the work was
extended so that the results could be applied to plumbing in larger
buildings.
In view of the extensive nature of the series
of experiments de-
scribed, the systematic manner in which the subject was approached,
the extreme
care with which
the measurements and
observations
were made and recorded,
the generous
facilities
afforded and
the
disinterested attitude of the investigators, the committee
is
of the
opinion that the results of the experimental work performed at the
Bureau
of Standards
are by
far
the most important
of any yet
obtained.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
In view of the importance of corrosion as an element in the lon-
gevity of plumbing systems, one of the members of the committee
has prepared a memorandum on this subject, which will be found in
the appendix.
Another experimental study bearing on the subject
of corrosion was made
in the Sanitary Engineering Laboratory
of
Harvard University, under the direction of the chairman of the com-
mittee, by Dana E. Kepner and Warren E. Howland.
It concerned
the movements
of
air and gases
in horizontal branch waste-pipes,
especially
long
branches.
Mr.
Howland’s
memorandum,
to
be
found in the appendix, describes only a few of the many experiments
conducted during a period of about six months.
Doctor Hunter’s original report
(see
ch.
6)
will speak for
itself,
but because of its length and its technical character the committee
wishes to call attention to some of its salient features and to express
its own views on certain matters pertinent to the investigation.
UNIT OF FIXTURE DISCHARGE
In order to study the capacity of house drainage systems,
it was
found desirable
to establish a unit of fixture discharge—a unit in-
volving both volume and time;
that is, rate.
The rate of discharge
of an ordinary washbasin having a nominal
1 J-mch outlet, trap, and
waste was found to be about 7.5 gallons per minute, a figure so near
to
1 cubic foot per minute that the latter was taken as the
definition
of one fixture unit.
The maximum rate of discharge of other fixtures
may be expressed in terms of this unit*
For example, it will be seen
from Table
1 that a sink with a l^-inch outlet is equivalent to
1J
units;
a bathtub with a
1 J-inch
outlet,
to 2
units; and
a water-
closet, to 6 units.
Fixtures differ a great deal, however, and minor
details of design may considerably affect the rate of discharge.
It
would be
useful
in designing plumbing systems
to know the unit
value of each of the common fixtures on the market.
No attempt
was made
to
collect
this
information,
although
a dozen
or more
fixtures were studied with reference to their rates of discharge.
WATER-CLOSETS
Doctor Hunter devised an ingenious
apparatus for determining
the rates of discharge of water-closets by means of an autographic
record.
This showed the advantage of siphonic action in flushing.
While no attempt was made to set definite limits for the rate of flush
or for the volume of water required,
it may be said that for “ wash-
down
closets”
efficient
flushing was
obtained by
using
rates
of
27 to 33 gallons per minute, or 3.6 to 4.4 units;
for siphon-jet closets,
3.2 to 4.8 units, the average value being about 30 gallons per minute,
or 4 fixture units.
If the rate of discharge is too low, the closet may
not be properly cleansed;
if it is too high, flushing will be less efficient

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
49
and there will be a waste of water.
There seems to be good reason
for limiting the volume of water to 5 gallons per flush and the rate
of discharge
to 5 units.
The maximum rate of discharge of a closet
may for an instant be
as high
as 45 gallons per minute; hence in
Table
1 the water-closet was rated as 6 units.
The committee is of the opinion that it is possible to design water-
closets which, while preserving the necessary rate of discharge, will
give a satisfactory flush with less than 5 gallons
of water, perhaps
with half this amount.
It must not be forgotten, however, that the
flow must be large enough to carry the solid matter into the street
sewer.
If
this change were brought about, savings
of water con-
sumption
of
5
to
10
gallons
per
capita
daily might be
effected.
Future conservation of water resources will demand this saving.
A few studies of pressure flushing as compared with tank flushing
were made, but were not followed up.
From the standpoint of dis-
charge, the two systems are not materially different.
Flush valves
make a more severe
draft on the house water supply and demand
supply
pipes
of
larger
diameter
than
do
the
water-closet
tanks,
which fill slowly after the closet has been used.
A tank may be used
in connection with a flush valve, and the necessity for using water
pipes of a larger size somewhat obviated.
Flush valves on a small
house
service interfere with the proper operation
of the ordinary
five-eighths inch water meter.
A larger meter
is undesirable not
only because
of added
cost, but because larger volumes
of water
might pass without registration.
The committee
is of the opinion
that the use of flush valves without tanks in small dwelling houses is
undesirable, although they should not be debarred.
PEAK LOADS IN HOUSE DRAINAGE SYSTEMS
Most house drainage systems are designed to carry away the water
from more than one fixture, and obviously the pipes must be large
enough
to
carry the
total volume
of simultaneous
or overlapping
discharges.
In a small dwelling, where the fixtures are so installed
that
all might be used and discharged at the same time, the house
drain must have a capacity equal
to
the
total number
of fixture
units.
In larger buildings, where there are many fixtures of the same
kind, the capacity of the house drain need not be equal to the total
number
of fixture units but must take into account the probable
frequency of coincident discharges.
Up to the present time this has
been estimated by a rule-of-thumb
procedure, which in the case of
many fixtures has given
too large a
total and in the case
of few
fixtures too small a total.
Doctor Hunter has submitted this problem
to a mathematical analysis, applying the principles of probability to
certain facts and observations secured by members of the committee
in regard to the use of water-closets in public places.
His computa-
20141°—29

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
tions, set forth in pages 91 to 98 of his report (see ch. 6), give some
interesting results, of which the following is a typical instance.
If, in a group of four water-closets, it be assumed that each flush
lasts 10 seconds, and that the interval between flushes is 5 minutes
during a rush period of 2 hours, the frequency of occurrence of 3
closets being discharged so that the flushes would overlap is once in
52
days, and the frequency
of occurrence of
all 4 overlapping
is
once in 28 years.
In such a case
it
is
sufficient to provide
for a
peak load of 3 times 6 fixture units; that is, 18 units, and not 4 times
6 units, or 24 units.
Thus, even in such a commonplace subject as
plumbing the so-called higher mathematics may be used
to show
what capacities are necessary and sufficient.
In the case of small
dwellings
less dependence
has
been
placed on mathematics,
and
required capacities have been established by the common judgment
of the committee.
Doctor Hunter has contributed further calculations, giving what
are believed to be more precise results than heretofore available in
the
case
of
tall
buildings,
in
his supplementary paper on
stacks,
drains, and vents, pages 188-205.
CAPACITIES OF HOUSE DRAINS
In designing a drainage system the house drain should be consid-
ered
first and
its capacity determined on the basis of the greatest
number of fixture units likely to be frequently discharged together
or so as to overlap, including rain water if discharged into
it.
The
house drain should be able to take away the water as fast as received
without backing up into the soil or waste stacks and at a velocity
sufficient to prevent the deposit of solids; that is, a velocity of about
2
feet or more per second.
A table (Table 4) based upon Darcy’s
formula has been prepared which shows for different sizes and slopes
the volume of water in gallons per minute and the number of fixture
units which can be safely delivered to the house drain.
For example,
a 4-inch pipe with a grade of one-fourth inch per foot will accommodate
14 fixture units, or practically one water-closet (6), one washbasin (1),
one bathtub
(2), one kitchen sink (li), and two combined laundry
trays
(3),
all discharged at once, which would seldom be the case.
The figures in this table have been checked with Williams and Hazen’s
hydraulic tables.
For small dwelling houses the common sizes and
grades for house drains appear to be reasonable.
At this point attention is called to the fact that street sewers not
infrequently become overloaded because of the growth of the city,
the substitution of apartment houses for single-family dwellings, and
skyscrapers for low buildings.
This may cause sewage to back up
in the house drain.
CAPACITIES OF SOIL STACKS
There has been a tendency to use soil stacks and waste stacks which
are
too
large.
Starting with the assumption
that no
static head
should be developed
in
the
stack and
considering
that
the
place

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
51
where the stack would he first likely to run full would be immediately
below the fitting through which the water entered,
it was reasoned
that the capacity of the stack should be determined by the capacity
of
the
inlet
fitting.
Experiments were,
therefore, made
to
deter-
mine the capacity
of
inlet
fittings and, with these
as a basis,
the
capacities of stacks of different sizes were found by experiments and
computations.
Doctor Hunter
deduced
a
mathematical
formula
for stack capacities.
The following figures will show the capacities
of certain commonly used stacks and
inlet
fittings:
Capacity of stack in
fixture units
Diameter of stack in inches
Single or
double
sanitary T
fittings
Single or
double Y,
combina-
tion Y, and
one-eighth
bend
fittings
2

It will be observed that the sanitary T
is much less satisfactory
than a Y or a combination Y and one-eighth bend as an inlet fitting,
as
it limits the stack capacity.
Or,
to put the matter in another
way, a 3-inch stack with proper inlet fittings has almost as large a
capacity as a 4-inch stack with sanitary T inlet fittings.
Another critical point in the design is the turn where the vertical
stack
enters
the
horizontal
house
drain.
In
systems where
the
stack and house drain have the same- diameter no special provision
need be made beyond providing a turn of sufficient radius to make
an easy bend.
In systems where the house drain
is one
or more
sizes larger than the stack the bend should have a diameter at least
one size larger than that of the stack.
CHARACTERISTICS OF FALL OF WATER IN PARTIALLY FILLED STACKS
Small flows of water down a stack tend to adhere to the sides and
to
follow
a
spiral
course.
In
the
case
of
larger
flows
frictional
resistance
of the
air causes
the water
to form diaphragms
across
the pipe which persist temporarily and then break through.
With
still larger flows
the diaphragms become
slugs and do not break
through.
Solids tend to encourage the formation of slugs.
The studies
of velocities in partially filled pipes were interesting
and instructive.
The acceleration of falling water under the influ-
ence of gravity and the friction of the water on the sides of the pipe,
which increases approximately as the square
of the velocity, unite
to produce
a
velocity which,
after
it
attains
a
certain maximum,
remains practically constant.
This maximum
is reached in a com-

52
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
paratively short fall and increases as the volume of flow increases.
This whole subject of vertical velocity
is a matter of importance in
the design of tall stacks, and the studies indicate that the height of
stacks need not be limited because of the fear of excessive downward
velocities.
For example,
in
a 3-inch stack open at both ends
the
velocity attained
after a
fall
of 20 feet
is 29
feet
per
second and
after 100 feet 34.2 feet per second, a relatively small increase.
Doctor
Hunter’s experiments and computations are a valuable contribution
to hydraulic science in this field.
VENT REQUIREMENTS
The subject of venting is complicated and can not be discussed in
a few words.
The committee has given attention to the necessity of
relieving back pressure, partial vacuum, and self-siphonage of traps
in order that a plumbing system may function
efficiently.
It has
also made studies of air circulation and diffusion.
The experiments
have been very numerous, and the results can be understood only
by giving
careful study to
the particular arrangement
of pipes in
each
case.
The committee suggested
as a
criterion of satisfactory
trappage that the 2-inch seal of a trap should not be reduced to less
than
1 inch.
Stacks of 3 and 2 inches were chiefly used.
Speaking in general terms, it may be said that the size of the vent
stack depends upon three principal factors—the diameter of the soil
pipe, the maximum volume of water discharged, and the length of
the soil and vent stacks.
Specifically, it was found that for a 3-inch
stack carrying its capacity load of 26 fixture units a 2-inch vent 36
feet long or a l|-inch vent 15 feet long gave satisfactory results.
The flow of air in pipes
is the controlling factor in vent require-
ments.
Use was made of well-known pneumatic laws for air flow,
and these laws, together with the experiments themselves, gave the
basis for some important generalizations in regard to the design of
vent stacks.
Given the discharge and the developed length of vent
stack, the diameter required for a given soil stack can be determined.
Increasing the diameter of a soil stack requires greater proportional
increase in the diameter of the vent stack because of the increased
volume of air to be moved.
On the other hand, decreasing the diame-
ter
of
a
soil stack permits a greater proportional
decrease in the
diameter of the vent stack, but there are objections to using a vent
stack less than
1 \ inches in diameter.
ADMISSION OF STORM WATER
There are advantages in not admitting roof water to an interior
house
drainage
system.
If
the
city has
a “separate”
system oi
sewers—that
is, domestic sewage and
rain water kept
apart—the
admission of roof water to the house sanitary sewer would not be

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
53
allowed.
If the city has the “combined” system, the storm water
should be carried separately
to
the house sewer.
There
is a
ten-
dency to change from the combined to the separate system, and
if
this were done the cost
of
alterations in the plumbing required to
bring about the separation would be much greater
if the roof water
entered the house drain than if it entered the house sewer outside the
building.
The admission of roof water to a house drain increases the danger
of back pressure near the base of the stack,
this danger increasing
rapidly with the rainfall.
In its computations the committee con-
sidered that a
rainfall rate
of 4 inches per hour was a reasonable
allowance, and hence it was decided that 180 square feet of drained
area in horizontal projection should be considered as equivalent to
one fixture unit.
The method of applying this figure to the table
given in the code (see ch. 4, sec. 116) allows a large factor of safety.
This figure was reached after a careful study of the frequency of
occurrence
of
different
rates
of
rainfall
in
different
parts
of
the
United States as published by the Weather Bureau of the United
States Department of Agriculture.
At New York
a
rainfall
rate
of 4 inches per hour occurs once in about two years; at New Orleans,
every year; and at St.
Paul, Minn., once in
three years.
Where
large systems are being designed the committee’s reasonable allow-
ance should not be used, but some other figure based on a careful
study of local rainfall intensity should be substituted for it.
In computing the capacity of a house drain
this rain allowance
should be added to the other requirements, for, although the chance
of such a rainfall as that assumed occurring at the time of the peak
load from the fixtures is small, the factor of safety thus provided is
none too large.
Storm water, a high tide, or sewer stoppage may cause the house
sewer or even the house drain to be submerged, giving back-pressure
effects similar to those produced by admitting roof water to the sys-
tem.
Where such complications as this are likely to occur the com-
mittee favors a distance of at least 3 feet between the lowest fixture
inlet to the stack and the house drain.
RUNNING TRAP
Whatever be the supposed advantages of the house trap, or run-
ning trap, as a protection of the house drainage system against the air
of street sewers, the experiments made by Doctor Hunter indicate
that this device produces an effect similar to a partially submerged
drain.
Whether vented or not, it decreases the capacity of the house
drain.
Other reasons against using the house trap are given in note
19, chapter 10.

54
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
EFFECT OF WIND BLOWING OVER STACK TOPS
Studies of the effect of winds blowing over the tops of stacks were
included
in
the experiments.
These
effects were measurable, hut
too small to be of practical importance in the case of small dwellings.
FROST CLOSURE OF THE STACK TOPS
The closure of the top
of the stack by frost or other cause was
studied.
Complete closure caused some of the traps to be siphoned
by the discharge of a single water-closet, and this occurred whether
or not the traps were individually vented.
Incomplete closures gave
less noticeable effects.
It
is., a matter to be guarded against as well
as possible, but can not be controlled by modifications of the venting
system.
SIPHONAGE OF FIXTURE TRAPS
Careful study has been made of the action of plain traps; that is,
the ordinary S,
| S, and
§ S
(or P)
traps, under different conditions.
The efficiency of a trap
is sometimes thought to mean its resistance
to loss of seal, but the real efficiency is resistance to alternate suction
and back pressure.
Loss
of seal does not concern the trap
alone.
The fixture
itself
is an element when self-siphonage
is being con-
sidered.
A trailing discharge, such as occurs in a bathtub, kitchen
sink,
or laundry
tray,
is
almost
invariably
sufficient
to
refill an
ordinary
trap; but with an
oval basin, where
the
discharge ends
suddenly,
greater
care must be
taken
to
prevent
self-siphonage.
The diameter of the tailpiece relative to that of the trap is an element.
There are advantages in having the tailpiece one nominal size smaller
than the trap.
The length of the waste pipe and its inclination to
the horizontal are also elements,
as well as the presence
of elbows
in the wastepipes.
Hence, it is more logical to consider the efficiency
of the trap and waste pipes as a whole than that of
the trap alone
using the changes in trap seal as a measure of the efficiency of the
system.
With this idea in mind extensive studies were made to ascertain
the effects of pressure,
aspiration, and self-siphonage on the seal of
traps and the best arrangement of designing waste pipes to secure
an efficient system in the simplest way.
The possible situations are
so numerous that the reader
is referred to the detailed statements
and diagrams in Dr. Hunter’s report.
The committee, reached the
conclusion that the minimum seal for a plain trap should be 2 inches,
and that a loss of seal greater than
1 inch in such a trap should be
regarded as unsatisfactory.
While it is true that a seal is not actually
broken
unless
the water
in
the
trap
falls below the “dip,” some
factor of safety must be allowed to provide for unexpected shocks,
for evaporation, capillary loss, and for oscillations due to wind pres-
sure, while a lowering of the seal exposes a foul surface on the house
side of the trap.

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
55
A fixture trap is almost sure to foul to some extent; sediment may
collect at the bottom, grease may adhere to the sides, and growth of
fungi may develop.
The deeper the trap seal the greater the extent
of the fouling.
While deep seal traps can withstand siphonage better
than traps of shallow seal, these other practical considerations com-
bine to make it advisable to place a maximum limit upon trap seals,
and the committee has placed
this
at 4 inches.
Experiments and
computations made by Mr. Howland (Appendix C) have shown that
the danger of gases in the drainage system diffusing through the trap
seal
is negligible for water seals between 2 and 4 inches; that the
liability of odors from deposits in the trap is also negligible; but that
the possibility of odors from deposits on the pipe between the fixture
and the trap in the overflow waste pipe, and in the trap itself when
its seal is lowered below normal, is more important.
While it is true
that many traps which have seals as deep as 6 or 7 inches are in use,
and while such deep-seal traps can not be said
to be injurious
to
health the committee
is of the opinion that the establishment of a
minimum limit of 2 inches and a maximum limit of 4 inches for plain
traps is desirable, and gives a basis for standardization.
RESEALING OR ANTISIPHON TRAPS
The committee has given attention to the subject of antisiphon,
nonsiphon,
or
resealing
traps,
as
they
are
called.
Practically
all
traps, except the plain traps already mentioned, may be included in
this class.
There are many different kinds, many of them patented
and more expensive than plain traps.
They are supposed to resist
siphonage better than plain traps by reason of having a deep seal,
a greater area or volume, tortuous passages for the water, projecting
lips,
partitions,
or,
in some cases, moving parts.
The best of the
resealing traps when clean resist siphonage more than a plain trap
of 2 to 4 inch seal, and this may be the case even when slightly fouled.
When more completely fouled,
this resistance to siphonage rapidly
lessens.
Properly
designed
resealing
traps
unvented
and
clean
resist back pressure somewhat more than unvented plain traps
of
the same depth of seal, but the difference
is not sufficient to justify
their general use without vents.
Their greater complexity causes
them to clog more quickly than plain traps, and,
if clogged, they are
less
easily cleaned by the householder and can not be thoroughly
cleaned by the usual method
of using a force pump
or plunger.
Lack
of
standardization
of
these
traps makes replacement more
troublesome and expensive.
The supposed advantages of a resealing
trap
lie in the fact that greater resistance
to siphonage makes
it
possible to omit some of the vent pipes commonly installed and to
use longer horizontal unvented waste-pipes and thus secure greater
freedom in the location of fixtures.
Long unvented horizontal runs,
however, are in themselves objectionable.

56
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
As before stated, the efficiency of traps should not be considered
alone; plain traps should not be compared with “resealing traps’ ’;
the
true comparison
is between a drainage system including plain
traps and a drainage system including resealing traps.
The experi-
ments made by the Bureau of Standards have indicated that simpli-
fications
in venting
are
possible even when plain
traps
are
used.
Plain
traps have
the
advantages
of economy,
simplicity,
greater
freedom from fouling, and greater ease of cleaning.
For these reasons
the committee favors having drainage systems designed on the basis
of plain traps rather than on the basis of resealing traps and
is of
the
opinion
that
the
plain-trap
system,
with
simplified
venting,
affords ample
range
in
the
location
of
fixtures.
Resealing
traps
should not be accorded any special privilege with respect to venting
over plain traps, but their use can not be prevented by regulation.
In short,
plain trapping with vents should be the prescribed
rule,
with
resealing
traps
without
vents
permitted
only
under
very
restricted conditions.
UNVENTED HORIZONTAL BRANCH WASTE PIPES
Directly involved with the question
of resealing traps
is that of
the
allowable
length
of unvented
horizontal branch waste
pipes,
because it is chiefly in connection with long branches that resealing
traps have an advantage over plain traps.
Long branches have a number of practical disadvantages.
There
is a tendency to give them too little slope.
Long straight runs are
likely to interfere with framing timbers and encourage unnecessary
cutting.
If the fixture discharge is small and only partially fills the
pipe, deposits may occur, and if the discharge is so large as to com-
pletely
fill the
pipe,
self-siphonage
of
the
trap may
occur.
It .is
this last danger that the resealing trap is supposed to prevent.
If a
long branch becomes stopped,
it
is more
difficult
to clean than a
short branch.
If long branches are unvented, there is danger of corrosion.
While
this
is well known by experience, especially where wrought iron or
steel is the metal used, the committee thought it worth while to have
this subject studied.
The results
of the experiments show that in
unvented horizontal branches connected to a stack the movements
of air in the stack produce eddy currents in the branch to a distance
of only
1
or 2 feet; that temperature changes may cause slight
air
movements
in the branch;
that
diffusion
of gases throughout the
length of the branch occurs; that
if such a gas as carbon dioxide
is
produced from deposits of organic matter uniformly along the branch
the maximum concentration of this gas will increase as the square of
the length of the branch; that deposits of moisture occur on the inner
walls
of
a
pipe,
especially
along
the
top;
that
iron
rust
absorbs
moisture; that moisture thus collected absorbs carbonic acid, which

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
57
tends to stimulate the corrosion of iron.
In other words, the danger
of corrosion in an unvented branch 10 feet long is about four times
as great as in a branch 5 feet long.
In the case of exposed horizontal
pipes leakage from corrosion might be detected and the pipe could
be readily replaced, but waste pipes
are usually concealed, where
leakage might go undetected and replacement would be costly.
From the standpoint of self-siphonage the slope should lie between
one-eighth and one-half inch per foot and the outlet should not be
below the dip of the trap.
Doctor Hunter’s experiments show that
in the case of wash basins plain traps of 2 to 4 inch seal, connected to
horizontal wastes
of 4 to
8
feet, would be safe against siphonage,
and in the case of wide bottom fixtures the lengths might be about
twice as long, with one 90° elbow not more than 18 inches from the
trap.
But on the basis of
all the evidence at hand the committee
decided that 5 feet should be established as a reasonable limit for
the* length of an unvented horizontal waste, measured horizontally
from the vertical inlet of the trap to the vent opening.
VENTING OF BRANCH WASTES
A clogged vent pipe is useless, just as useless as if no vent pipe had
been installed.
If waste pipes are so arranged that the waste water
may rise into the vent pipe at times of discharge, the latter is very
liable to become clogged.
If the connection
of the vent pipe and
waste
pipe
lies below
the hydraulic grade—that
is,
below
a
line
which connects the high-water line of the fixture and the point where
the waste pipe enters the stack—water is likely to rise into the vent
pipe.
The crown vent is an example of this condition, and the fre-
quent clogging of this vent has caused this arrangement to be looked
upon with disfavor and even
to be prohibited by regulation, but
almost any vent which rises from a horizontal branch may act in
the same way if the discharge fills the waste pipe.
If the vent forms
a continuation of the vertical leg of the waste pipe and
if this con-
nection is above the hydraulic grade, there will be no danger of the
vent becoming clogged.
This
is a reason for limiting the length of
all horizontal waste pipes, whether vented or not.
Doctor Hunter’s
explanations of this subject are clear and illuminating.
SEPARATE TRAP VENTING NOT NECESSARY
Every
trap
seal
of
a
plumbing
system
should
be
adequately
protected against failure, but to accomplish this
it
is not necessary
that each particular trap have an individual vent pipe.
For example,
stack venting appropriate for the highest fixtures is the most efficient
and
certain
of
all forms
of venting.
Venting requirements relate
to the drainage system as a whole.
Wet vents—that is, portions of
the waste pipe which are used alternately for the discharge of water
and
for
venting
purposes—are
unobjectionable
if
installed
with
regard to the principles already set forth.

58
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
The committee
is strongly of the opinion that
if due thought
is
given to the design of the drainage system vent pipes may be reduced
in size and number, plain traps may be used, and the whole system
made simpler and cheaper than
is often
the case
to-day.
To do
this, however, generally requires that fixtures be located relatively
near a stack, and architects are urged
to design buildings so that
this can be done.
THE 3-INCH SOIL STACK
An important conclusion reached by the committee after a thor-
ough
discussion
of
the experimental
data was
that
a
3-inch
soil
stack has a greater capacity than has often been thought, provided
that the house drain is of adequate size, that the points of inlet are
well chosen, and the inlet fittings of proper type.
While admitting
that a larger size has a greater capacity and may under some con-
ditions be desirable, a 3-inch soil stack is deemed sufficient for any
ordinary
dwelling.
The
economies
resulting from
using
a
3-inch
instead of a 4-inch size are material.
Less metal is required, trans-
portation and construction costs are
less.
The 3-inch pipe can be
placed in an ordinary frame dwelling wall, thus saving cost and room
space.
A 3-inch soil pipe can be placed in a partition having 4-inch
studding, and a 3-inch bend can be housed in the flooring better
*than a 4-inch bend.
A 3-inch soil stack may be satisfactorily used
for a high building,
if the necessary conditions are complied with.
The reader is referred to Doctor Hunter’s report for information on
this point.
CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF VENT REQUIREMENTS
It is quite difficult to set forth vent requirements in words, and for
that reason it is difficult to frame regulations which will be adequate
and never
unreasonable.
Even Doctor Hunter’s
conclusions,
set
forth on page 176 of his report, are difficult to visualize.
The com-
mittee, therefore, asked him to arrange a series of plumbing layouts,
which should
set forth
in
a concrete way
the venting which
the
experiments indicated to be desirable, assuming that plain traps are
used and
that
the
simultaneous
discharges
of
fixtures
are
those
reasonably to be expected.
These are shown in Figures 90, 91, and
92.
It will be seen that in houses of the single, low bungalow type
very little individual venting is required; that with fixtures on two
stories an additional vent stack is needed, but few
if any vents for
waste branches; that with fixtures on three stories venting of branch
waste
pipes becomes
necessary,
but
that even
here
group
vents
rather than individual vents for each fixture suffice.
These figures do not, of course, represent all possible layouts, but
they may be taken as types and deserve careful study.
Attention is

EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
59
called also to some of the more detailed layouts shown on Figures
81 to 89, which will give a better idea of the situation than can be
told in words.
FACTORS OF SAFETY
The committee has given much attention to the factors of safety
needed
in plumbing
systems.
That some margin should
exist
is
obvious,
for unforeseen
conditions may
arise,
partial
or complete
stoppages of portions of a drainage system may occur, fixtures may
remain out
of use for long periods, workmanship
is never
perfect.
On the other hand, the occasional failure of a trap seal does not injure
the structure of the plumbing system, and in this instance the com-
mittee has decided that in the case of a trap having a water seal of
2 inches, two is a sufficient factor; that is, a 2-inch seal should never
be reduced to less than
1 inch.
In structural work factors of safety
of four or five are properly required.
With the best of intentions, factors of safety have sometimes been
multiplied,
one upon another,
until the system was overburdened
with precautions and expense.
Yet even where
this has occurred
there have been examples
of unimportant matters being
stressed
while vital requirements were neglected.
The committee
is
of the
opinion that a careful study of Doctor Hunter’s report will clarify
many ideas in regard to plumbing design.
PLANNING FOR SIMPLICITY
The committee has less faith in plumbing regulations than in the
education
of plumbers and the cooperation between sanitary engi-
neers, plumbers, and
architects.
The plumbing system
is an inte-
gral part of a modern dwelling.
Structurally it must interlock with
other parts of the building.
It should be given serious thought when
the building
is planned.
Simple plumbing can be obtained
if
it
is
planned for, but if the plumbmg is made the last element of the de-
sign complications are sure to arise.
The committee
is
of the opinion that the principles of plumbing
and house drainage are not being given sufficient attention in schools
of
engineering
and
architecture;
that
present-day
textbooks
of
plumbing give too much attention to fixture details and not enough
to the governing hydraulic and pneumatic principles of house drainage,
and that in many ways the whole matter of plumbing has been put
on
a commercial rather than on an engineering plane.
The com-
mittee hopes that the report of the experiments made under its direc-
tion by the Bureau of Standards will mark a turning point in the
popular
attitude toward plumbing and
the plumber.
Simplifying
regulations should not be a matter of “ letting down the bars” to
encourage simpler designs; but better and simpler designs, resulting
from scientific work, should make simple regulations sufficient.

CHAPTER 6.—PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS.
REPORT
OF EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL INVESTIGATIONS
By R.
B. Hunter and L. W. Snyder
Bureau of Standards
PURPOSE AND METHOD OF INVESTIGATIONS
The purpose of these investigations was to supply data to aid the
subcommittee on plumbing in the formulation of
essential regulations
and sound rules of practice applicable to small dwelling-house con-
struction with the view of securing simplification of plumbing design
and uniformity
of requirements and
practice through
the general
adoption of these rules.
This report is a consolidation of the oral and written reports made
to the committee at various times during the progress of the work.
These partial or progress reports have been rearranged and abridged,
retaining only the more essential data and applications.
The
series
of experiments
outlined by the committee,
including
tests of several concrete examples of plumbing installation, covering
one story, one story and basement, and two story and basement, one-
family houses; one story and basement duplex, and two story and
basement, two-family houses, has not been completed in
all parts.
However, the investigations have advanced to the point where con-
clusions and generalizations, in so far as they affect small dwelling
construction, are justified.
Certain phases
of the investigation, the results of which may be
applied to the general problem of house drainage, have been carried
beyond the requirements for the small dwelling and
are reported.
It seems impractical to attempt to divorce entirely the requirements
for dwellings from those of other types of buildings, since many of
the principles involved are applicable, without modification or with
only
slight
modification,
to
all
classes
of plumbing
construction.
This led to a number
of independent experimental and theoretical
investigations related to the general problem of house drainage.
The nature of the problem as presented and the manner in which
the experimental work developed make
it impractical to report the
investigations in the order in which they were conducted.
There-
fore, the separate
fields
of investigation have been arranged in
as
logical an order as possible leading to final conclusions.
The
fact
that
a plumbing system
consists
of many
parts—the
sewer, the house drain, the vertical stacks, the connections between
the stacks and the house drain, lateral branch drains of various sizes,
lengths and forms, the vent system, and the water-supply system
60

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
61
each of which may be varied independently and which are certain to
be varied in practice, coupled with the fact that, in general, the pipes
are only partially filled and that both water and air movements must
be accounted for, make
it impractical,
if not impossible, to develop
an}^
single mathematical
expression
for
general
application.
The
problem
of developing even a
series
of formulas
is rendered more
difficult by the failure of certain types of results to duplicate when
the experiment is repeated.
For example, with the simplest system,
consisting of a washbasin fitted with a plain P trap and short waste
open at the end there is a wide difference in results produced on the
final seal of the trap when the basin
is repeatedly discharged with
the same quantity of water and
as nearly
as possible in the same
manner.
Some
other types
of experiments
duplicate
results with
unfailing accuracy.
For the most part conclusions have been drawn
from the latter type of experiments and results of the former type
have
been
applied
with
extreme
caution.
Therefore,
because
of
these complications
the
different
parts
of the problem have been
taken up
separately
for experimentation and
discussion,
and
the
results combined for application to the complete system and finally
tested in a number
of complete
test
installations.
The results
as
applied
are
approximations,
though
based whenever
possible
on
experimental values.
Many simple experiments in which the general result could have
been
foretold from
theoretical
considerations
or
experience have
been performed merely to obtain numerical values
to aid in tying
the
different parts
together, and for the same reason some simple
principles are treated at some length.
Experimental work and
tables on
hydraulics and flow
of gases
have been freely consulted and used whenever possible in checking
our own experimental
results and
in extending them
to
a wider
application.
Many
of the
tables represent such a combination
of
existing tables and the results of these investigations.
The growing belief that the 3-inch stack
is adaptable to a much
wider use than found in present practice has given
it a prominent
place
in
these
investigations from
the beginning.
The modifying
effects
of
external
conditions,
frost
closure,
strong
winds, heavy
rainfall in case of combined sewer systems, house trap in main house
drain, and submerged outfall of house drain have been considered in
connection with the proportioning of soil, waste, and vent pipes, and
have been made the subjects of special experimentation.
In passing we wish to state that available reports of other experi-
mental work on plumbing have been examined with
considerable
care,
and
that we have
observed,
as have
others,
contradictory
conclusions
reached from
experiments
apparently conducted with
similar
apparatus
and
under
similar
conditions.
Some
of
these

62
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
stand out from the others as conducted by men of high standing in
their professions, and we venture the opinion that at least in these
instances the work was honestly conducted and honestly reported,
and that the charges of self-interest found in some of the later reviews
of such experiments were unwarranted.
Further,
it
is our opinion
that the disagreements were due rather to what we may
call small
differences in the apparatus employed,
to limited
facilities, and to
the viewpoint that experiments on a single system are conclusive.
Certain
criticism
of
the
committee’s
tentative
report
that has
appeared, arising in part at least from misinterpretation due to lax
reading, leads us to caution the reader against what seems to have
been one of the most common forms of misinterpretation—namely,
the extension
of
specific statements and
conclusions
to
a general
application—and
to
caution
against
drawing general
conclusions
from a single phase of the experimental work unless the results are
clearly of such character as will not be modified when the part
is
included in a complete system or will be modified in such a manner
as to increase the efficiency of the system.
A superficial reading can
be
of
little value, and a careful reading
of the report
as a whole,
with a clear understanding of the application
of the principles
in-
volved, will be found necessary to afford an intelligent, independent
interpretation.
There is also a tendency on the part of some to discount experi-
mental evidence supporting
established
physical
principles on
the
grounds that it is not in accord with experience.
In most cases such
criticism
is founded on impressions or prejudices rather than on a
knowledge of the facts of the case.
The fact that we get opposite opin-
ions relative to the same point, both based on the so-called experience,
indicates that
little weight should be attached
to them unless the
opinions are backed by very specific data, gathered under accurately
known conditions.
It
is true that the solution of certain points in
the problem
is
offered only through experience, and that the final
test
of the whole problem
is
its working under service conditions.
For that reason we have drawn freely on the knowledge of experienced
engineers and plumbers and have kept in close touch with the plumb-
ing committee and opinions obtained through their correspondence.
No claim is made that these investigations have been exhaustive
in every detail or that the conclusions may not be modified or ex-
tended by improvement in materials
or design.
It
is fully recog-
nized that in the matter
of venting
it would be possible in some
cases to omit some of the vents recommended for general applica-
tion were it possible to have each system designed by a man familiar
with
all the principles involved and with
all the conditions
to be
encountered where the system is to be installed.
The judicious use
of special fittings and traps would further modify the general con-

elusions for special cases.
Stock materials not covered by patents
have been used almost entirely.
We believe that our conclusions as far as they go are sound, offer-
ing a common ground on which
all interests may safely unite, and
a foundation on which the work may be extended
to cover build-
ings other than the small house.
The Bureau of Standards desires to acknowledge and express
its
appreciation
of
the
valuable
material
assistance rendered by
the
committee
as
individuals and
as
a body and by
various
private
parties and
firms
in presenting problems,
in
offering
suggestions,
and in supplying equipment without which
assistance the accom-
plishment
of
the
results
obtained within
the time
allotted would
have been impossible.
RATES OF DISCHARGE FROM PLUMBING FIXTURES
In order to obtain data for the determination of the strain on any
plumbing
installation
and
for
establishing
a
serviceable
unit
of
measure
for such
strain,
the
rates
of
discharge from
the various
types
of plumbing
fixtures
ordinarily
installed
in
dwellings were
determined
as
a
preliminary
to
other
experiments.
To
this
end
fixtures, flush tanks, flush valves, traps, and fittings, believed to be
representative in kind and number, were secured.
'
APPARATUS EMPLOYED
The apparatus employed
is shown
in Figure
1
and
in
detailed
section in Figure 2.
It consists of a beam balance 10 feet 6 inches
Fig. 2.—Detailed section of fixture-rating apparatus.
A, ball-bearing fulcrum; B, weighing tank; C, spring

long supported on
a ball-bearing fulcrum, A, a suspended tank, B,

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENT'S
oil the recording device, and a dash pot,
F, for damping out vibra-
tions of the beam.
The recording device consists of a small motor
geared to draw a specially prepared wax paper from a drum across
a smooth plane
at
a uniform
rate.
A
fixed
stylus, G ,
traces the
zero
line,
or X
axis, and
the recording
stylus,
E,
rising with the
beam under the weight of the discharge,
traces a smooth curve on
the waxed
paper.
The
discharge
pipes
from
the
fixture
to
the
weighing tank were varied
to meet the demands
of each purpose.
The sketch
(fig.
2)
represents
a
water-closet
operating on
a low
tank supply and discharging through a 3-inch cast iron closet bend
into a section of vertical 3-inch stack.
The part below the fitting is
a glass section 3 inches by 2 feet.
Around this
is a moveable pipe,
H, carrying a baffle plate,
/,
to take the impact
of the discharge.
During the operation the baffle plate, suspended with
a moveable
section of pipe from the platform above,
is kept level with the sur-
face of water in the tank and the discharge thrown horizontally to
the walls
of the tank.
The impact
of the discharge
is thus taken
by the platform and
resultant vibrations reduced
to
a minimum.
A baffle
plate serving the same purpose was arranged for each fix-
ture rated.
Any lag produced
either by the
baffle plate
or dash
pot is imperceptible in the general form of the record curve.
The apparatus was
accurately
calibrated,
so
that
the discharge
in gallons at one second intervals may be obtained from an accurate
measurement
of
the
record
curve.

The slight waves observed in the record curve do not materially
affect the accuracy and are entirely eliminated in the plotted curve.
Figure 5 is the derivative curve of the same discharge plotted with
Pig. 5.—Derivative curve (rate of discharge against time) plotted from Figure 3.
Total discharge 4.7 gal-
lons, peak discharge 45.8 gallons per minute, mean rate of discharge 30.0 gallons per minute
rates
of discharge in gallons per minute
as ordinates and time in
seconds as abscissa.
The data for this last form of curve are obtained
by reducing the mean rate of discharge for each second of the total
time of discharge to rate
of discharge in gallons per minute.
The
exact maximum at a point is in some cases slightly higher than the
maximum obtained in the above manner.
This
difference
is par-
tially corrected by the method of drawing a smooth curve through
the plotted points of the derivative curve, thus giving in many cases
20141°—29
6

66
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
a slightly higher maximum than any plotted point on the curve and
one corresponding to the maximum slope of the original curve.
The
difference, however, is unimportant, since a maximum that does not
last for more than one second can have little effect on the combined
maximum
rate
of
discharge from two
or more
water-closets.
In
this connection we have considered a mean maximum rate
of
dis-
charge over a two-second interval, which we refer to as the peak dis-
charge.
This is believed to be a more representative value than the
simple maximum for two
reasons,
first in
all
efficient flushes
the
approximate maximum was sustained for periods
of from two
to
three seconds,
and,
second, any swell in the discharge
of shorter
duration has but slight bearing on the problem.
It will be noticed
that for all high rates of supply the “peak discharge” and maximum
rate of discharge approach the same value.
The mean rate of dis-
charge recorded is the mean for the whole time neglecting the trail
discharge at the end.
This is approximately the same as the mean
rate of supply to the water-closet.
The reader is cautioned against
confusing the rate of supply and rate of discharge in later discussions.
A number of derivative curves plotted as in Figure 5, with descrip-
tive
details
of
the
conditions under which each was
determined,
follow.
These are believed to be sufficiently representative
of the
characteristics
and
rates
of
discharge
from
water-closets
under
different conditions for our purpose.
It should be kept in mind that
the detailed results herein recorded represent a small part
of the
total work done on the subject.
Duplicate records of most deter-
minations were made.
The method is sufficiently accurate that, in
general,
duplicates superimposed show no
difference
to
the
eye.
The slight differences that do appear are evidently due to variations
in the operation of the supply devices rather than to inaccuracies in
the weighing and recording apparatus.
No attempt has been made
to average duplicate records, since such averages tend to obscure the
true characteristics of the discharge.

WATER-CLOSETS
The water-closet supply tanks used in the plotted determinations
were filled automatically through the supply valve furnished with the
tank, operating on a supply with pressure varying from 50
to 60
pounds per square inch.
The floats were adjusted to allow the tanks
to fill approximately to the overflow, thus giving a greater total vol-
ume and slightly greater rate of supply than the same tanks would
give in service where they are usually adjusted to give a margin of
safety
in
the
overflow.
The
water-closets were
flushed by
fully
opening the tank valve, then allowing it to close automatically under

The maximum rate of discharge may he read from the graph.
The

The curves shown in Figures 20 to 38 were obtained by discharging
the water-closets through a

cast-iron
closet bend “sanitary

conditions than

The upper end

The supply

50 and 60 pounds per square inch, and a 1-inch section connecting
from

The

for the new supply line run later.
Two curves
(figs. 24 and 25) are
shown to illustrate the characteristics with low rates of supply yet
sufficient to induce siphon action in the closet bowl.
It should be
noted that the rate of supply for these two curves is limited by the
supply
line, and only
slight change was produced by adjustments
in the flush valve.
To
give adequate supply and
allow adjustment
in
the
rate
of
supply, a new supply line, not drawn to scale
(fig. 26), was installed.
It consisted of a lj-inch section about 16 feet long leading from the
2-inch main and a section of
1 inch about 9| feet long from the 1J-
inch section to the flush valve, with gate valve, pressure gauge, and
elbows in positions shown in the figures.
The gate valve was installed
to throttle the line and control the maximum rate of supply and in

The pressure gauge enabled us to read the static
pressure in the supply line and the minimum pressure to which the
pressure dropped in the 1-inch section of the line during operation.
The static pressure in the line at the time is recorded as the maximum
pressure and varied between 44 and 60 pounds per square inch.
The
minimum pressure is also recorded for each figure given and represents
the lowest operating pressure for the 1-inch section in that particular

The operating pressure quickly dropped to the minimum
when
the flush valve was opened, and gradually approached
the
maximum as the valve closed.
This variation in operating pressure
is similar to the variation that occurs
in
service lines during
use.
When supply lines give unnecessarily high rates under the service
pressure, the rate of supply may be reduced to the desired value by
partially closing the shut-off valve usually installed with flush valves.
The general effect is similar to that produced by partially closing the
gate valve in the experimental supply line used.

It
is recognized
that had
the
testing
of
flush
valves been our
purpose the work would be incomplete without a more accurate control
of the operating pressure by means of pressure regulators
or other
devices.
The variations secured were
sufficient for our immediate
purpose, namely, the determination of rates and characteristics of the
discharge from water-closets relative to the rate of supply.
In this connection we wish to state that we have made no tests on
flush valves, and that their use has been incidental to the other experi-
ments.
It is true we have gained some information on the relative
merits of the flush valves used, which we withhold from this report.

maximum and 5 pounds minimum pressure.
Total discharge 4.6 gallons, peak discharge 35.9 gallons

It would be unfair to the manufacturers to publish incomplete data
on the subject.
Interpretation and Discussion of Results.—In the interpre-
tation of the preceding rate-of-discharge curves it is essential that the
characteristics of the discharge producing the best results be kept in
mind.
The most certain and efficient cleansing of the water-closet
bowl occurs when there is a strong siphon action in the first two or
three seconds, followed by a period of weak or broken siphon action,
during which the bowl is practically empty, and this in turn followed
by a second siphon action.
These characteristics appear in the rate
curves as a maximum point on from the second to the fourth second,
-followed by a minimum or decided tendency toward a minimum point,
in turn followed by a second maximum point lower than the
first.
The curves showing these maxima and minima points as described are
indicative of strong efficient flushes.

80
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
If the rate of supply
is too low, a complete break in the siphon
action occurs, and in extreme cases the minimum point approaches
zero while the bowl is refilling following the first siphon action.
(See
figs. 24 and 25.)
The result is a sluggish and uncertain flush.
If the
rate of suppty is too high, the siphon action becomes continuous with
the bowl partially filled until the end of the flush.
This may result in
paper and fecal matter being floated in the bowl to settle to the bottom,
Fig. 29—Rate of discharge curve for a Mott siphon jet bowl supplied by Sloan flush valve operating under
50 pounds maximum and 25 pounds minimum pressure.
Total discharge 4.0 gallons, peak discharge
46.6 gallons per minute, mean rate of discharge 37.2 gallons per minute
or at best to be drawn into the trap at the end of the flush, and in an
incomplete refill, due to the flush ending with a strong siphon action.
The curves showing a single maximum with no tendency toward a
minimum point are indicative of rates of supply too high for the best
results.
The
dividing
line appears
to be that which permits the
discharge to drop from a maximum to an approximately constant rate
of flow.
(See figs. 10, 31, and 36.) A rate lower than this permits the
formation of a minimum
(figs.
11,
14, and
17).
A rate higher than

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
81
this gives a continuous rate of discharge approximately equal to the
maximum, which drops abruptly at the end of the discharge
(figs.
9,
12, and 21).
The conclusion, therefore, is that a rate of supply that
does not permit the formation of a minimum
is unnecessarily high.
The siphon jet bowl, due to the jet action, has a somewhat wider
range of serviceable supply than the wash-down bowl, and for the
same reason the upper limit of the most serviceable rates
is not as
sharply marked as for the wash-down bowl.

29, the flush valve operating under 44
pounds maximum and 14 pounds minimum pressure.

It is impossible to fix a definite value for either the rate of supply
or the
total quantity
of water required which
will give the best
results for
all water-closets.
These
will vary with different bowls
and
conditions.
There
are, however, pretty
definite limits within
which the serviceable rates for
all water-closets employed in these
tests, and we believe
all water-closets that should be approved for
general
use,
fall.
A study
of
the
curves
of
discharge given
will
show
that
for wash-down
closets
the
curves
indicating
a
strong
efficient flush were obtained when the mean rate
of discharge and
approximately the mean rate of supply was between 27 and 33 gallons
per minute.
For siphon-jet closets the range
is between 24 and 36
gallons per minute.
This gives
a mean value of approximately 30
20141°—29
7

82
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
gallons per minute as a rate of supply that, in general,
will prove
satisfactory for either type of closet bowl.
The quantity of water
required depends on the duration of the flush.
The time varies from
6 to 10 seconds, the lower rate of supply, in general, requiring the
longer time.
Considering this in connection with the curves of dis-
charge indicates a range of from 3 to 5 gallons as a serviceable quan-
tity.
No doubt
there
are many
closets on
the market which

Total discharge

smaller quantity would serve satisfactorily under certain conditions.
The approximate mean values
are,
therefore, 4 gallons supplied at
the average rate of 30 gallons per minute for eight seconds.
If the mean rate of supply exceeds 36 gallons per minute, in gen-
eral, not only does a less efficient flush result, but there is an unneces-
sary waste of water and an unnecessary strain placed on the drain-
age and sewage- disposal systems.
It is believed these are sufficient
reasons for prohibiting for general use any flushing device that deliv-

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
83
ers more than 5 gallons or at a mean rate greater than 36 gallons
per minute and for prohibiting for general use any water-closet that
requires a greater quantity or greater rate than this.
This leads to
slight,
if any, change in existing materials or practice, since prac-
tically
all flushing
devices,
with minor adjustments
possible and
desirable at the time of installation, as well as the requirements of
most water-closets,
fall within these
limits.
The
details
of
these
restrictions apply more particularly to the water-supply system than
to the drainage system, which is the particular field of this investiga-
tion and which is concerned only with the limits.
If the above restriction, which is believed justifiable,
is granted,
we may proceed at once to determine the maximum rate of discharge
Fig. 32—Rate of
discharge curve for the same set-up as
Figure 31, the flush valve operating under 50
pounds maximum and 15 pounds minimum pressure.
Total discharge 4.3 gallons, peak discharge 36.0
gallons per minute, mean rate of discharge 28.2 gallons per minute
from
water-closets.
A
further
reference
to
the
curves
will show
that in one case only, in which the mean rate of supply does not
exceed 36 gallons per minute, does the “peak discharge” rise above
45 gallons per minute.
There are several reasons for selecting and applying the “peak
discharge’
7
(see
p.
66)
as determined
rather than
the maximum
discharge at a point or for periods as low as
1 second.
First, the
application will have a particular bearing on the subject only when
the peak load
is approaching the limiting capacity of the stack or
drain.
This will be the combined discharge of four or more water-
closets for stacks and possibly three or more water-closets for lateral
branch drains.
Second, the combined discharge from several water-
closets in coincidence or overlapping will, in general, be more uni-
form than the discharge from any single one of the group.
This

84
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
combined
discharge
will become more uniform
as
the number
of
water-closets
is
increased.
Third, in general, not more than two
water-closets will discharge at the same point in a system and the
effect, barring stoppage or overcharging, will tend to make combined
discharges when overlapping occurs more uniform and tend toward
a mean value.
And, finally, there
is ordinarily but slight difference
Fig. 33.—Rate of discharge curve for a Trenton Potteries siphon jet bowl supplied by Sloan valve operat-
ing under 55 pounds maximum and 33 pounds minimum pressure.
Total discharge 3.9 gallons, peak
discharge 50.8 gallons per minute, mean rate of discharge 43.2 gallons per minute
between the “peak discharge” and maximum when the rates are
high enough to produce a “peak discharge” of 45 gallons per minute.
It therefore seems reasonable to assume a maximum rate of dis-
charge from water-closets to be allowed for of 45 gallons per minute.
This
is a value
that, in general,
will not be exceeded and seldom
reached
if the former reasonable restriction in the rate of supply is
adhered to.
The rate may be criticized by some as too high, but it
should be kept in mind that
it
is our purpose to fix minimum re-

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
85
quirements on the basis of maximum
effects; that the employment
of this rate will be relative to the rate of discharge of other plumbing
fixtures ; and that due to the nature of the material and more thorough
scouring the rate will decrease less than that of other fixtures.
FIXTURES OTHER THAN WATER-CLOSETS
The curves
of discharge obtained from plumbing fixtures other
than water-closets show no characteristic that may not readily be
predicted from the conditions involved.

33, the flush valve operating under 55
pounds maximum and 21 pounds minimum pressure.
Total discharge 4.2 gallons, peak discharge 45.5
gallons per minute, mean rate of discharge 36.6 gallons per minute
The rate of discharge from these fixtures, which we hereafter refer
to
collectively
as
“ standing
fixtures,”
is
evidently dependent on
the head of water in the fixture itself, on the developed head in the
unvented portion of the waste, on the area of the cross sections of
the outlet orifices, tailpiece, trap, and waste, with modifying effects
produced by strainer, bends, etc.
The curves of discharge for “standing fixtures” are smooth curves
showing a uniformly decreasing rate
of discharge with decrease
in
head in the
fixture,
the rate
of decrease being dependent on
the
area of horizontal cross section of the fixture.

head
is independent of the area of the cross section and the shape
of the fixture.
These points are not of sufficient importance to justify the use of
the space necessary for a detailed description and illustration.
We
therefore omit these curves and data and confine the discussion to
results based more on data obtained from fixtures set in place on
the
stacks
of
the
test
installations.
After
a few
determinations

Total discharge 5.0 gallons,
peak discharge 52.2 gallons per minute, mean rate of discharge 46.2 gallons per minute
which verify certain of these points it became evident that data for
11 standing fixtures” more
applicable
to our purpose could readily
be obtained from time and volume measurements with the fixtures
set in place on the stacks of the test installations.
It
is impossible with the
greeot variety of fittings now
7- in use to
establish a single common unit of measure applicable to
all.
Even
by restricting the application to one size of outlet
orifice., trap, and

88
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
waste, a unit that will serve to express relative rates of discharge
must
at
best be a rough approximation.
Evidently such
a
unit
should represent highest mean rates of discharge.
The fixtures were
fitted with plain P traps and wastes running
from the traps to the stacks or vented wastes with one-fourth inch
fall to the foot; hence, the rates of discharge are strictly applicable
only when this condition is approximated.
Any change in the form
of installation, such as the use of an unvented S trap and waste to
the floor, that tends to develop a greater head, increases the rate of

discharge from that fixture.
Ordinarily the application of the same
value for either condition in the case of a small fixture would lead
to no difficulties and would avoid complicated tables.
Based on all the data at hand from both sources, we propose the
following rates of discharge for “ standing fixtures’
7 applicable when
the specifications are approximately adhered to
For washbasins fitted with 1 J-inch P traps and wastes, with nominal
lj-inch tailpieces and strainers giving equal cross-sectional areas of
orifices, the highest mean rate of discharge is approximately 7.5 gal-
lons
(1 cubic foot) per minute.

PHYSICS OP PLUMBING SYSTEMS
89
For bathtubs fitted with
IJ-inch outlet and wastes, and nominal
H-inch outlet connections with strainer giving equal cross-sectional
areas of orifices, the highest mean rate
is approximately 15 gallons
per minute.
For kitchen
sinks
fitted with
IJ-inch P
traps and
wastes,
and
nominal lj-inch tailpieces with strainers giving equal cross-sectional
areas of orifices, the highest mean rate is approximately 11.3 gallons
per minute.
This refers to the normal use of sinks wuth the outlet
orifice continually open.
If the sink
is used with a plug and
dis-
charged by filling and lifting the plug, the rate of discharge approaches
that given for laundry trays.
For laundry
trays
fitted with
IJ-inch
tailpieces,
with
strainers
giving equal cross-sectional areas of orifices, the highest mean rate
is approximately 22.5 gallons per minute.
For a combination
fixture
of one kitchen sink and one
or two
laundry
trays,
or
of two
or
three laundry
trays,
fitted with one
1 1-inch P trap and waste and nominal lj-inch tailpieces, the maximum
rate of discharge when two or more are discharging simultaneously
is not greater, and, in general, is less, than the maximum rate of the
one
of the group giving the highest rate when discharging alone.
This conclusion has been questioned, and in its support we offer the
following data obtained from two combinations of laundry trays of
two each.
Two single laundry trays practically identical and without strainers
were set end to end on the same level and fitted with a l|-inch lead
P trap with nominal 2-inch seal depth and short lj-inch wrought-iron
waste and nominal IJ-inch tailpieces and connection.
The tailpiece
of one tray, A, was connected vertically into the P trap, the
tail-
piece of the other tray, B, was connected vertically into the short
arm of a l§-inch lead one-fourth bend, and the long arm of the lead
bend was wiped into the side of the trap inlet above the water seal,
forming a T union.
(See
fig.
80.)
They were filled with the same
volume each time and were discharged separately and also together
by lifting the plugs simultaneously.
The time was taken from lifting
the plugs to the beginning of the swirl and trail discharge at the end.
The experiment was also repeated using trays A' and B' of smaller
capacity, with strainers.

These results are as were anticipated and are fully explained by the
fact that the resistance at the point of junction of two streams from
different directions more than balances the decreases in resistance,
due to the two outlets to the point of junction, the head being the
same in both cases.
The above
is true in case there is no material
change in sizes of waste.
If the trap and waste were increased in
size at and beyond the point of junction over that of the waste pipes
to the point of junction, the combined rate
of discharge would be
greater than the rate of a single fixture of the combination, but in
no case would it be double that of the one giving the highest rate of
discharge.
It may be anything between these values, depending on
the relative lengths and cross-sectional areas of the portions of the
combination waste
pipes.
The combination rate
in most
cases
is
nearer that of a single fixture than double the rate and frequently
falls below the rate of a single fixture.
It therefore seems reasonable
to treat combination fixtures as one fixture and groups
of
fixtures
with separate traps as separate fixtures.
The normal use of combi-
nation fixtures would be separate discharging, so that generally the
single-fixture rating would apply directly.
The variation in combi-
nation rate of discharge from the single-fixture rate of discharge
is,
in general, so small that no material error would be introduced by
treating the combination as one fixture and the discharge rate the
same as for a single fixture of the same kind.
Any attempt to allow
for possible variation in combination fixtures leads to complications
that destroy any value attached to a table of relative rates of dis-
charge.
Such a table to be of service must necessarily be as simple
as possible.
The following table, based on
all determinations and observations
made, is offered as approximately representing the rates of discharge
of the common plumbing fixtures under

1 Outlets from fixtures are commonly made one nominal size smaller than the trap for convenience in
making slip-union joints, a practice that offers other advantages; hence the actual diameter is less than
stated nominal values, varying from one-eighth to one-fourth inch.
2 Time for emptying the basin and sink are given for the full fixture If and 6 gallons capacity, respec-
tively.
The time given for other fixtures gives a range that will vary with the capacity of the fixture
and extent of filling.
3 No determinations were made with 2-inch bathtub outlets, and the values given represent an esti-
mate to the nearest one-half fixture unit.
It will be observed that the fixture unit adopted, 7.5 gallons per
minute, is approximately 1 cubic foot per minute.
It may be found
more convenient to express rates of flow in cubic feet per unit time
than in gallons per minute as has been done in later tables.
DETERMINATION OF THE PEAK LOAD IN ANY PLUMBING SYSTEM
In fixing the limits of use of soil stacks and drains it seems to have
been
the custom
to
establish
arbitrarily
a given
fraction
of
the
combined
discharge
of
all
the
fixtures on
a plumbing system
as
representing the probable peak load to be provided for.
It is gen-
erally recognized
that
it
is unnecessary
to provide
for
the
total
simultaneous
discharge
of
all
the
fixtures.
While
the
arbitrary
fixing of the peak load
is supported to some extent by experience,
this only shows that the estimates have been liberal on the side of
safety.
METHOD OF PROBABILITIES
From the standpoint of economy in the installation of plumbing
systems it is obviously desirable to secure a closer approximation of
the peak load and the frequency of
its occurrence based logically
upon data representing the conditions involved.
This can be done
by determining the probability of coincident discharge of the various
fixtures based upon the observed frequency of use, the duration of
the individual discharge, and the predetermined rates
of discharge
of the various fixtures.
The application of the method of probabilities to such a problem
is not precise, since
it
is based upon variable and somewhat inde-
terminate time factors.
The results are, therefore, to be regarded as
approximations and
applicable to large systems more closely than

92
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENT'S
to small ones.
The method will, however, be found helpful in the
analysis of small systems.
To
illustrate the method,
let us suppose
a system composed
of
five water-closets and assume
(1)
that each water-closet
requires
10 seconds to flush, and (2) that each water-closet is flushed at ran-
dom
once
during
a
10-minute,
or
600-second,
interval.
Let
us
assume also that the flushing of two water-closets
is coincident
if
the flush periods overlap nine seconds or more.
Probability may be defined as the ratio of the favorable ways in
which an event may occur to the total number of ways, favorable
and
unfavorable,
in which
the same
event may
occur.
On
the
assumption
of random
flushing,
any
one
of
the
5
water-closets
may begin its flush during any of the 600 seconds in the 10-minute
interval.
Therefore, the total number of ways in which the event
may occur
is 600
5
.
Suppose we wish to determine the probability
of
3
of
the
5
water-closets being flushed
together.
The number
of
different combinations
of
5
objects
taken
3
at
a
time
Cl
is
5X4X3
3X2X1 = 10 .
The
3
water-closets
of any
of
these
combinations
may begin
their
flushes during any one
of
the
600
seconds, and
either of the 2 remaining water-closets may begin its flush during any
of the remaining 599 seconds.
The number of ways in which the
event may occur favorable to the coincidence of 3 water-closets only,
is,
therefore,
(7|X 600x599x599 = 10x600x599
2
.
Therefore,
the
probability of 3 only of the 5 water-closets flushing in coincidence is
= 3

or once

or

A close approximation simplifying the computation may be made
as follows: In general,
if n
is the number
of water-closets on the
system and r the number flushing in coincidence, and Cn
r
the com-
bination of n things r at a time, the probability of coincidence of r
only out
of n water-closets, provided r
is equal to or greater than
n

If r
is less than
the probability of coincidence of r only is also less than
Cn
The approximation
in both
cases
is
close and
in
reality
includes all coincidences from r to n water-closets.
Overlapping Discharges.—It
is
evident
that
the
chance
of
actual coincidence is so remote as not to require serious consideration.
There is, however, a greater chance for overlapping discharges which
may produce effects in a plumbing system quite as great as actual
coincidence.
It
is necessary,
therefore,
to extend
the method
to

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
93
include overlapping.
The process
of transforming the equation to
include
overlapping
is
tedious
and somewhat
complicated.
The
final form, however,
is fully as simple as the original approximation
for probability of actual coincidence.
In overlapping both the duration of flush and period of overlap
come into the full equation.
If we take into account all overlapping
of 4 seconds or more in flushes of 10 seconds duration, we shall have
included
all except trail discharges at the beginning and end of the
flush.
If the results determined on the basis of
10 seconds duration of
flush and an overlap of 4 secbnds or more are applied to a system in
which the duration of flush is only 6 seconds, all overlapping will be
included.
A study of the discharge curves of water-closets in this
connection shows that
if we allow for an overlap
of 4 seconds or
more, few,
if any,
of the overlapping coincidences will give a com-
bined maximum rate of discharge equal to the sum of the maximum
rates of the individual water-closets.
Briefly, the inclusion of all overlapping of from 4 to 10 seconds is
equivalent
to
reducing
the
interval between
flushes by the
ratio
10 — 4 = 6.
The
probability
of
overlapping
flushes
then becomes
(7?/100r_1
, and
also includes the probability of from r to n water-
closets overlapping.
This is evidently fixing sufficiently wide ranges
to include
all
variations
that might produce
detrimental
effects.
The probability of 3 or more out of 5 water-closets overlapping 4 sec-
onds or more, then, is Of/100

o
a more tangible form and allow for rush periods and periods of infre-
quent use, they have been reduced to occurrence of once in a period
of days or years as follows
:
If we assume a rush period of two hours
daily during which all fixtures on the system are in constant use, and
assume that, at other times only a small part of the fixtures are in
use, then, there will be 12 flushes of each closet, or 12 complete cycles
within the two hours rush period in which coincidences may occur,
60
2= 12.
Then the probability of once in

becomes once m ^
~ = 33 days, or once m
years.
If it were possible to deal with accurately determined time inter-
vals throughout, the results by this method might be directly applied
with perfect safety.
In practice
all the factors will vary according
to conditions, the duration of the flush with the kind and condition
of supply apparatus, the interval between flushes with the number of
people using the system and their habits, and the length of the rush
period with the type of installation and
its location.
The effect of

94
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
each of these time factors on the results should be considered in con-
nection with any data on which it is based before passing judgment
on the selection of the factor.
The longer the duration of the flush the greater is the probability
of overlapping discharges.
In selecting this factor we have chosen
10 seconds as the maximum duration of flush which we believe should
be permitted for general use and a value that represents an approxi-
mate maximum as water-closets are installed at present.
The same
value would apply in all types of installation.
Mixed Systems.—Up
to
this point we have considered systems
composed of water-closets alone.
While it is possible by
a
similar
method to calculate probabilities for mixed systems of water-closets
and other smaller fixtures,
all the time factors vary with the kind of
fixture and are more indeterminate for the small
fixtures than
for
water-closets.
It may be shown, however, that for two systems both
having the same
total combined rate
of
discharge, one composed
entirely
of water-closets and
the other a mixed system
of water-
closets and smaller fixtures, the probability of a given volume dis-
charge is greater for the system composed of water-closets than for
the mixed system.
We therefore propose the extension of the tables
for water-closets to include water-closets or equivalents, translating
in terms of fixture units.
Any error thus introduced will be on the
safe side and simplifies the application by reducing the number of
tables necessary.
Time Factors.—Before considering the other two time factors,
the interval between flushes and the length of the rush period, we
would
divide
installations
into
at
least two
classes—private and
public.
The first class includes homes, private baths in hotels, and
such installations, in which a number of fixtures are inclosed in the
same room
or compartment and
are
ordinarily not
accessible
to
more than one person at a time.
The second class includes public-
comfort stations, railway toilets, factory and office building toilets,
schools,
etc.,
in which each fixture
is inclosed in a separate com-
partment or is open and accessible for use at all times.
Other classi-
fications might be made if found desirable.
We have prepared Table 2 to apply to the private class of installa-
tion and Table 3 to apply to public installations.
Table 2 is based
on the
average
interval
of
10 minutes between
flushes and rush
periods of one, two and three hours daily.
Table 3
is based on the
average interval of five minutes between flushes and rush periods of
2,
3, and
10 hours
daily.
These two
time
factors
are
the most
difficult to determine with any degree of accuracy and are the most
variable.
Both the interval between flushes during the rush period
and the length of the rush period should be taken as the averages
over the whole period of years considered.
It will be observed that
the shorter the interval between flushes the greater the probability

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
95
of coincidence
or overlapping and the longer the rush period
the
greater the probability.
We have based the interval between flushes for Table 3 on the
data following, supported by our own observations, and by physical
limitations as to possible frequency of use.'
It is physically impos-
sible for a number of people normally to use water-closets at a much
higher average rate except as urinals.
Table 3
is merely a sugges-
tion of possible application to larger structures and has no applica-
tion to our immediate problem, the small dwelling house plumbing.

Evidently, though not stated, these observations included use as
urinals.
Both the very short periods of use and the manner in which
the number of persons for different periods vary indicate this.
The
highest number of uses by males was for between 4 and 5 minutes
and the highest number of females between 5 and 6 minutes, indicat-
ing an average of approximately 5 minutes when not used as urinals.
However, taking the mean of the two sets of data regardless of the
kind of use, it is 5.11 minutes per person.
The mean, weighted ac-
cording to number of users, is 5.4 minutes per person.

96
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
The five-minute interval made the basis of Table 3 is close enough
to indicate the possibilities of the method as a means of approxima-
tion.
It would be desirable and perhaps necessary, to secure more
data on the subject before making an extended application.
The
method might also be applied with some modification to the propor-
tioning of water-supply pipes for large buildings.
Table 2 applicable to private systems, though carried beyond the
requirements
of separate dwelling houses, has some application in
this
field.
The
basic
difference
between
the
two
classes
is
the
inclosure
of
several
fixtures
in one room
or compartment
in
the
private system.
This at once restricts the possible use if privacy is
maintained.
The time intervals for Table 2 are not based on any
specific data, but rather on the extent of use they allow.
It is to be
kept in mind that the rush period is not only an average over a long
period of time, but is independent of the number or duration of the
short rush periods into which the assumed daily rush period may be
broken.
The real consideration is the number of cycles that occur
at the rush rate in the entire period
of years considered.
A rush
period of two hours on alternate with none on intervening days will
have exactly the same effect in the long run as a rush period of one
hour daily.
On this basis consider the extent of service a flushing interval or
frequency of use of 10 minutes and a daily rush period of one hour
will permit in the case of a mixed system.
It will allow an average
of six persons to the bath for an average time of 10 minutes each,
each person flushing the water-closet, the bathtub, and the basin, or
it will allow half the number of persons for double the time each
flushing the fixtures twice.
If the same number of persons use the
bath to the same extent in a two-hour period instead of one hour,
the probability
of overlapping
is
decreased.
Again,
it should be
remembered
that
the method
will
apply,
in
general,
to
systems
composed of several bathrooms and that six persons per bath
is a
high, and
10 minutes per person
to use
all three
fixtures a low,
average for these conditions.
The liberal allowance here will amply
take care of cases of the same person flushing one or more of the
fixtures twice in one use of the bathroom.
In addition to the use
of the bath as described, the assumptions would allow kitchen
sinks,
laundry trays, and any other separate fixture on the system each to
flush
6
times
within
the one-hour rush
period.
This
is
a very
liberal allowance for these fixtures.
Not only will any rush period
for these, in general, be at a different time in the day, but weekly
rather
than
daily
for
laundry
trays.
Laundry
trays
and
even
kitchen sinks might well be neglected so far as their presence affects
the required sizes for main stack and house drain.
They have not
been disregarded but have been rated at full value throughout.
We

97
have discussed this subject at length merely to show that any con-
ceivable normal variation
in service from the conditions assumed
tends to
decrease the probability
of coincident
or
of overlapping
discharges.

These tables have been placed early in the report for the purposes
of reference in later chapters.
The question of what frequency of
occurrence should be provided for in an installation
is one closely
connected with establishing a reasonable factor of safety, and the
dividing line should vary with the size and character of the installa-
tion.
We, therefore, leave this question and the details of applica-
tion for amplification in the chapter dealing with factors
of safety
in plumbing systems.

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
CAPACITIES OF STACKS AND DRAINS
The problem of accurately determining the carrying capacity of a
system of drainage pipes composed of vertical and horizontal sections
of varying diameters in which, in general, the vertical sections are
only partially filled is difficult in comparison with the determination
of the carrying capacity
of the same system flowing
full under a
known head.
The problem is further complicated in the plumbing
system by the fact that both water and air movements must be taken
into account.
Apparently, in view of the varying degrees to which the system or
parts
of the system may be
filled,
a very rough approximation
of
the maximum carrying capacity is
all that may be hoped for.
The
fact that an appreciable head of water developed in any portion of a
plumbing system into which branches are discharging tends to im-
pair the efficiency of the drainage indicates a limiting condition on
which to base determinations of capacities.
While the development
of a head of water in certain portions
of
a given system—namely,
in unvented
small
waste branches—may produce no detrimental
effects,
the
assumption
of
a
condition under which no head can
develop in any portion of the stacks or house drain
is certainly a
safe procedure and apparently the only one that will permit a general
application of results.
The determinations following have, therefore,
been based on this assumption.
With a system composed of vertical and horizontal sections of the
same diameter throughout it is evident that on the assumption that
no static head may develop the limit of carrying capacity will first
be reached in the horizontal sections of the systems.
This at once
suggests the separate consideration
of vertical and horizontal sec-
tions.
The economical use of material would be that gradation of
diameters which gave the same carrying capacities in ah sections.
The limitations in number of pipe sizes available and the nature of
demands from certain fixtures both render such close approximation
impractical and again lead to rough approximation by selection of
the nearest size above actual requirements.
The plumbing
1 system naturally
divides
into
distinct sections—
the house drain, the vertical stack or stacks, the lateral horizontal
branch drains, and the bends or turns connecting the stacks and ver-
tical branches
to horizontal
sections.
The house drain and large
lateral branch drains, which we have referred to as horizontal sec-
tions, in reality sections of low hydraulic gradient, may be considered
together since either may run full without head.
By the expression
“without head” we mean flowing under its own head, that is, with-
out developing a static head above the highest point in the horizontal
section.
DRAIXS
Existing hydraulic formulas
offer means for fairly close approxi-
mations
under
these
conditions.
Kutter’s
formula
is
generally

100
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
accepted as the most applicable to large sizes (14 inches in diameter
and over).
Darcy’s formula
is generally considered more accurate
for smaller sizes (under 14 inches in diameter), being based on data
obtained from pipes in this region while Kutter’s formula was based
on data obtained from large pipes and open conduits.
Results
calculated by
Kutter’s formula
with n = 0.015
and by
Darcy’s formula agree for a pipe of
14 inches diameter and show
increasing divergence on either side of this diameter, Darcy’s formula
giving higher values for smaller sized pipes and lower values for large
sized pipes than Kutter’s formula.
We
therefore submit the following
table
of
capacities for pipes
flowing full under their own head, based on Darcy’s formula for old
cast-iron pipes lined with deposit, which is offered for approximating
required sizes of lateral drains in which a static head is undesirable or
detrimental.

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
101
Tables for steady flow are not strictly applicable to the conditions
of intermittent
flow
encountered
in house
drains.
However,
the
component of the entrance velocity from the stacks in the direction
of flow in the house drain is invariably greater than the velocity for
steady flow, hence the tendency is toward a greater capacity than
that given in the tables.
Any increase in capacity due to an entrance
velocity operates as a factor of safety.
The necessity of a house drain of ample capacity can not be over-
emphasized.
The development of a head that extends up into the
vertical stacks produces detrimental effects difficult to prevent, and
in extreme cases even impossible to prevent by any system of venting.
STACKS
We have found no formula, tables, or data applying to the flow of
water in partially filled vertical pipes.
Therefore, independent deter-
minations of stack capacities, based again on the assumption that no
static head is developed in the stack itself, have been made.
In vertical stacks a static head can develop only after the stack
has become
filled
at some point.
With the water introduced at a
given rate by volume, this will first occur at the point of lowest veloc-
ity, evidently at a point of entrance.
Since the vertical component
of the entrance velocity is less than the maximum velocity attained
in the stack, the velocity increases from the point of entrance until
the maximum
is reached.
The vertical component of the entrance
velocity depends on the rate of flow by volume, the cross-sectional
area
of the
inlet, and
the
angle
of
entrance.
This points
to
the
capacity of the fitting as a measure of the “practical capacity” of the
stack.
We will define the capacity of the fitting as the rate of flow in
gallons per minute at which the water just begins to build up in the
vertical part of the fitting above the inlet branch of the fitting.
This
is then taken as a measure of the practical capacity of the stack con-
structed with that fitting.
With any rate of flow not exceeding this
value then the stack, barring stoppage or marked retardation, will not
be completely filled at any point.
Determinations were made with different fittings on both 2 and
3 inch stacks as follows
: The fittings were set in the top of the stack
and water introduced at known rates through a trap and the fitting
inlet
(fig. 39), observation being made in the open upper end of the
fitting.
So long as the water flowed freely with no appreciable retard
in the fitting, the rate was considered below that fitting capacity.
The
rate at which the first tendency to back vertically into the fitting above
the level of the inlet appeared, was taken as the fitting capacity. When
the water stood above the level of the inlet, even temporarily during
the sustained rate of flow,
it was considered that the capacity had

102
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
been exceeded.
This last condition in the case of only one inlet to
the stack would do no particular harm, and
it should be noted that
the rate of flow that causes the water to stand in the fitting is greatly
in excess of the rate at which the tendency to build up first appears,
double the rate in some cases.
The flow was maintained for from
15 to 30 seconds by means of the tanks, thus giving ample time for
observation and for any effect from lower portions of the stack to be
transmitted.
Various lengths of stacks from 30 to 45 feet both with
and without house drains were employed, but as no modifying effect
from the part of the system below the fitting was observed in any
case only the fitting and tank connections are illustrated in Figure 39,
showing a double Y fitting with water introduced simultaneously at
both inlets.
Fig. 39—Supply tanks at top of stack for determining the capacity ox fittings and stack
The preceding description applies to capacities with entrance at
one level with either one or two inlets.
For entrance at two levels
two fittings of the kind under test were set at two points in the stack
approximately 11 feet apart, and a 1-inch glass tube bent in L shape
was set in a side inlet in the lower of the two fittings and water in-
troduced simultaneously at known rates through the main inlets of
the two fittings as before.
Any retard or interference in the lower
fitting sufficient to cause a slight back flow, neglecting splashes, into
the glass L tube was taken as exceeding the capacity of the fitting
under
these
conditions.
As might be
expected,
the
tendency
is
toward an increase in capacity with the water introduced at two
levels.
This is essentially different from the effects in pipes flowing
full.
It therefore seems safe to assume that the capacity of a given
stack with entrance points at more than one level is not less than the
capacity of the same stack with entrance points at one level only.

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
103
In fact, there is strong evidence that the capacity increases with the
increase
in number of entrance points
at
different
levels,
tending
toward a maximum capacity measured by the stack flowing full with
the maximum velocity attained by water flowing in a vertical stack
of that diameter.
What we have really determined is, therefore, the
maximum capacity
of the stack for methods
of construction
that
give a relatively small maximum capacity compared to what might
be secured by other methods or design of construction.
The experi-
ments were based on the assumption that present methods of con-
necting the fixtures directly to the stack through short waste or soil
branches, especially for small house construction, would be continued.
The possibilities of extension of the serviceable limits to which the
smaller sizes of stacks might be used by some changes in the method
of construction will be pointed out later.
Based on the observations described, the approximate ''practical
capacities’
7 of 2 and 3 inch cast-iron stacks with entrance points at
one or more levels is as follows:

1 Capacities for the 4, 5, 6, and 8 inch stacks were calculated from the equation.
The capacity of a stack
is approximately expressed by capacity
= Ted2
, in which d is the diameter of the pipe in inches and
Tc, a con-
stant,
is 22.5 for 45° Y inlets, 11.25 for San-T inlets.
There are good
reasons for believing the same relation substantially holds for larger
sizes.
BASE FITTINGS
The remaining point for consideration in connection with capaci-
ties—namely,
the bend or turn connecting between the stack and
house drain or a lateral branch to the house drain—is not readily
determined
by
experimentation.
It
is
evident
that
insufficient
capacity in
this part would produce
effects very
similar
to those
produced by an insufficient house drain.
Ample capacity may be
secured without material change
in
present methods.
For
small

104
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
systems no
special provision
as
to
sizes
is
necessary.
For larger
systems,
in which
the
probable peak load
approaches
the
stack
capacity, it is necessary to specify the construction in order to insure
a capacity in the stack base fitting at least equal to that of the stack.
In such cases the house drain will be one or more sizes larger than the
stack.
A requirement that the increase be made at the union of the
stack and base fitting rather than at the union of the base fitting
and house drain would solve the problem.
In case the house drain
is two
sizes larger than
the
stack
the base
fitting might be
the
intermediate
size.
For
example,
in
a
system
that
requires
a
3-
inch
stack
and
a
4-inch
house
drain
the
base
fitting
should
also be 4 inches, or in a system which requires a 3-inch stack and
a 5-inch house drain the base
fitting should be
at
least
4
inches
in diameter.
The specification might be simplified by the require-
ment that in
all cases for
soil stacks the base fitting between the
stack and house
drain should be one
size
larger than
the
stack.
This last would work no particular hardship when the requirement
is not actually needed and would reduce the
possibilities
of
detri-
mental back pressures around the base of the stack, which may occur
under certain conditions even in very small installations.
The same
requirement should be observed whether the turn is made by means
of a long sweep one-fourth bend, by means of the two Y
fittings or
by means of a Y
fitting and one-eighth bend.
In
this connection
the long sweep one-fourth bend with reducing hub
will
give
the
desired connections with one
less
fitting than
if an ordinary long
sweep bend is used.
We have used this bend with 3-inch stack and
4-
inch house drain in test installations with decidedly better results
than were obtained with 3-inch stack, 3-inch base fitting, and 4-inch
house drain.
CHARACTERISTICS OF FLOW OF WATER IN PARTIALLY FILLED
VERTICAL PIPES
The character of the flow of water in a partially filled vertical pipe
varies with the extent
to which the pipe
is
filled.
Limited oppor-
tunity for direct observation of the flow was offered in the experi-
mental work.
Opportunity was given to observe the flow past glass
sections
set near the point
of entrance and near the base
of the
stack, the flow from the open lower end of a vertical stack, and in a
few cases through the stack itself.
For small volumes of flow amount-
ing to little more than a trickle the flow is entirely on the inner wall
of the stack.
With increase in volume the adherence of the flow to
the wall continues up to the point where the frictional resistance of
the air causes it to diaphragm across the pipe, temporarily forming
a short slug of water which descends as a slug filling the stack until
increased
air pressure breaks through,
the water forming the slug

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
105
either being thrown again to the wall or falling for a short distance
as separate streamlets in the center of the pipe.
This diaphragming
and forming slugs probably first appears in a 3-inch stack when the
stack
is from one-fourth to one-third
full.
As the volume
of flow
increases, the slugs thus formed are more frequent and more per-
sistent and in a stack open at the lower end may not be broken
through.
This intermittent
rate
partially
accounts
for the
rapid
erratic oscillations of pressure in a plumbing system.
SPIRAL FLOW
There
is
a
decided tendency
for the water
to
spiral with very
low volumes of flow, evidently due to the variable frictional resistance
encountered.
The direction of the spiral motion is dependent on the
resistance of the uneven surface.
With increased volume the spiral
motion
is
less
evident and was not
detected
at
all with volumes
sufficient to entirely cover the wall of the pipe.
If such spiral motion
does occur, it is not sufficiently marked to justify its being taken into
account.
VELOCITY OF FLOW
Investigation of the velocities attained by water falling in partially
filled vertical pipes leads to some interesting results that may be of
considerable importance
in
their
application.
It
is
a well-known
fact that a body moving under a constant force against a resistance
that
varies
as the square
of the velocity tends toward maximum
constant velocity as the resistance and the moving force approach
the same value.
This is illustrated by bodies falling in the air and
is especially apparent with bodies of relatively low density.
Well-
established principles of hydraulics show that the frictional resistance
in water pipes increases approximately as the square of the velocity
and that it is independent of the pressure.
In vertical pipes the re-
sistance evidently varies in about the same manner, and in partially
filled vertical pipes the flow is mainly on the wall.
The resistances
for the full and for the partially filled pipe are not materially different.

While these results
are not dependable they indicate the magnitude of velocities to be
measured
in
experimental
determinations.
Such
determinations
were made for 2 and 3 inch vertical stacks, with open ends at the
top and bottom,
flowing

capacities”
and

To plot the velocity curve for any height of stack from this equa-

Employing a vertical 3-inch cast-iron stack 45 feet in height, open
at top and bottom, water was introduced at the top through a 45°
double Y fitting as shown in Figure 39 and the velocities determined
by means of a Pitot tube
(fig. 40) set in the stream at the open lower
end of the stack.
The Pitot tube was kept full of water by means of
the flask reservoir and correction made for rise of water in the flask
under impact.
The purpose of the air reservoir in the flask was to
damp
out
rapid
fluctuations and
overthrows
in
the manometers,
enabling a more accurate reading.
The flow was sustained for 17.5
seconds,
allowing
sufficient time for

The velocity was obtained from the equa-

, in which h is the length of the supported column

Velocity
curves, plotted from the equation with £ and V0 determined experi-
mentally, for the 3-inch stack, with volumn-of-flow of 100 and 200
gallons per minute, and the velocity curve for a free fall with the con-
stant acceleration, g, are shown in Figure 41.'
Numerous other determinations of velocities with various heights
from 5 to 45 feet of 3-inch stack gave values that fell on the curve
plotted within the estimated errors of the determinations.
Similar
less accurate determinations of velocities in a 2-inch cast-iron stack
up to 30 feet in length with volumes of flow of 90 and 45 gallons per
minute gave maximums of 24 and 18.5 feet per second, respectively,
attained in a fall of 20 feet.
The work
is
still incomplete, but the
results are conclusive in some respects, namely,
(1) that water falling
Fig. 40—Pitot tube for measuring velocity of water at base of stack
in vertical stacks reaches an approximate maximum in a compara-
tively short
fall;
(2) that
in a given stack the maximum
increases
with increased volume of flow;
(3) that in a given stack the approxi-
mate maximum
is attained in a shorter fall with lower volumes of
flow;
(4) that with volumes of flow proportional to the areas of the
cross sections—that
is, proportional to the
u practical
capacities”
the maximum is smaller and is attained in a shorter fall in the smaller
of two given stacks; and
(5)
that with equal volumes of flow the
maximum is greater and a greater fail is required to attain the maxi-
mum in the smaller of two given stacks.
The conclusions are all on
the assumption that while the stack is only partially filled the vol-
umes of flow are sufficient to completely cover the walls of the stacks.
If the walls are not completely covered, the maximum velocity
is
practically independent of the size of the stack, is very small, and is
attained in a very short fall.
If the stacks are completely filled and
flowing under their own head, the maximum velocity and the height
in which it is attained increases with increased size of stack.

It should be noted that, with volumes
of flow of 90 gallons per
minute in a 2-inch
stack and
200 gallons per minute
in a 3-inch
stack, slugs of water completely filling a short length of the stack are
occasionally formed and
that
the maximum
velocity
attained by
such slugs approaches the maximum velocity for a completely filled
stack.
As the maximum indicated by the manometer used with the

The fact that the air resistance encountered in an actual plumbing
installation, due to the influence of the horizontal house drain, was
not present in the determinations from which the curves were plotted,
should also be noted.
Evidently the air resistance offered in a par-
tially closed system, such as presented by a complete plumbing instal-
lation, increases more rapidly than the square of the velocity.
There-
fore, the velocity not only approaches the maximum more rapidly
than
indicated by
the
curves,
but probably
reaches
an

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
iod
maximum
within
the
distances
indicating
approximate maximum
velocities
in
the
curves.
There have been some indications
of
a
slight decrease in velocity toward the base when measurements were
made in the open end of a long sweep one-fourth bend set on the
lower end
of
the
vertical
stack.
A marked
decrease
in
velocity
could be produced
only with
the base
of
the system
completely
closed to the passage of
air.
This is again getting away from prac-
tical conditions,
for,
if the house drain may become closed
to the
passage
of
air, the fixture inlets and vents
offer an
outlet with a
relatively small increase in
pressure.
Even
the small increase
in
pressure necessary to produce circulation
of
air through vents will
have some effect on the kind described.
It
therefore seems reasonable
to assume
that
the approximate
maximum
velocity
of
32.8
feet per second
attained
in a
45-foot
length of 3-inch stack open at the top and bottom will not be ex-
ceeded in a 3-inch soil or waste stack of any height in the partially
closed system presented by a complete plumbing installation.
The only apparent application
of
this data
is on
the point
of
limitation of height of stack of given diameter.
For example,
if a
3-inch stack in which a height to the highest group
of fixtures
of
20 feet is permitted, there is slight reason, on the grounds of increased
velocity,
for placing any
limitation on
the
height
allowed.
The
velocity attained in a fall of 20 feet in a 3-inch stack open at both
ends is 29 feet per second.
That attained in a fall of 100 feet will
be 34.2 feet per second.
The maximum velocity attained in a given vertical stack
is ap-
parently a linear function of the volume rate of flow; that
is, the
maximum velocity is proportional to the volume rate of flow.
Evi-
dently this relation holds only with volume rates
of flow between
that which will completely cover the wall of the pipe and that which
continuously completely
fills the pipe.
Below the former limit the
flow becomes a trickle on the wall of the pipe and the resistance is
relatively greater.
Above the latter limit a static head is developed
in the pipe and the equation no longer holds.
No doubt the velocities could be reduced by the introduction of
devices, such as spiral sections or fittings, that would hold the water
on the wall
of the pipe.
There has been no time or opportunity
offered yet for investigation
of such
devices.
The
effects
of such
fittings on the system in other respects are problematical, and we
offer no opinion as
to general
effects
of
special
fittings without a
thorough investigation by experiment and test.
VENT REQUIREMENTS
There are three principal effects produced in a plumbing system
which must be relieved through venting in order to insure its efficient
functioning, namely, back pressure,
or increase above atmospheric

110
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
pressure,
partial vacuum,
or decrease below atmospheric pressure,
and self-siphonage, a purely local phenomenon.
To these may be
added the possible concentration of corrosive gases at certain points
in the system.
In general, a relief of the first three conditions will
largely prevent the
last.
In any event
it should be
treated as a
separate consideration.
The fact that back pressures and partial vacuums do not occur in
their maximum intensities in the same part of the system, and, in
general, where they do occur alternately are of relatively small in-
tensity,
suggests
a separate
consideration
of
the requirements
to
relieve each.
PRESSURE EFFECTS
Numerous
air-pressure measurements were made with
sensitive
pressure gauges at various points from the base of the stack upward
in the plumbing test installations used.
In ail cases back pressures
only were encountered at the base of the stack.
The region of back
pressures extended upward as the volume of the discharge was in-
creased.
In the upper portions
of
the stack below the entrance
point
of
the
discharge
partial vacuums
only
were
encountered.
Between
these two
is
a
region
in which
the
pressure
alternates
between positive and negative pressures measured from atmospheric
pressure as the zero.
Figures 42 and 43 illustrate the pressure effects in a 3-inch stack,
unvented except by the open stack top.
The stack connected into
a 4-inch house
drain,
38
feet developed length,
consisting
of two
straight sections connected by a return bend, inclined at an angle of
45°.
The connection from the stack was made by a 3-inch Y
set
in a 4 by 3 inch Y of the house drain.
These pressures, especially
the partial vacuums, are not necessarily those in the center of the
stack, but rather the pressures that would be produced in an unvented
branch line connecting at that point.
The two lower points were
measured in 3-inch branches of fittings, the upper points by tapping
a
one-fourth-inch gas
cock
in the pipe at that point.
The small
orifice does not give the same results as the larger fitting opening,
the values being sometimes higher and
at other times lower than
measurements taken in a 2 or 3 inch fitting inlet at the same level.
However, they are sufficient to show the general characteristics, and
as no direct application was made of measurements taken through
small
orifices
the
degree
of accuracy
is not important.
In
later
experiments where results have been applied
all pressure measure-
ments were made in or through branches of a fitting.
In the figures
solid
lines connect points
for which
actual records
of maxima
or
minima were obtained and dotted
lines, portions interpolated from
observations of fluctuations in the pressure gauges in reaching the
maximum or minimum.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
Several types of pressure gauges were used, U-tube manometers,
both water and mercury, and a sensitive differential pressure gauge.
Figure 44
illustrates the principle
of the
last.
It
consists
of two
shallow drums with flexible diaphragms attached to two light circular
plates of equal area connected at their centers by a small aluminum
rod.
The mid-point of the connecting rod is attached to the end of
a short lever balanced on a pivot.
To the other end of the lever
two light
coiled springs
are attached.
A light stylus attached
to
the pivot above the lever records the deflection on a drum rotated
by clockwork.
The gauge was calibrated to 0.01 inch of water and
for small deflections
is sensitive to that degree, being particularly
free from overthrows under rapidly fluctuating pressures.
Figure 45 shows an arrangement
of water manometers giving a
maximum and minimum pressure gauge.
The valves in the bulbs
were constructed of sheet rubber and automatically closed, stopping
the back flow from the highest point.
The scale was graduated to
0.1
inch with
the
possibility
of estimating
0.01
inch.
The same
principle in a modified form was used with mercury manometers.
The
operation
of
the
valves was
fairly
dependable.
By
careful
observation
any
failure
could
be
detected
and
the
experiment
repeated.
The records are given to the nearest
0.1 inch
of water
and for the lower ranges are accurate to this degree.
In the higher
ranges with the drum gauge the absolute accuracy decreases, while
the relative accuracy remains the same.
In view of the characteristics of pressure fluctuations produced in
a plumbing system and of the accuracy of established laws of flow of
gases in pipes under pressure, it is evidently possible to calculate the
requirements
in
sizes
of
vents
necessary
to
relieve
detrimental
conditions, provided
a starting point for the
calculation
is given.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
This starting point we have established on the following assumptions :
(1)
That
the
stack
is
carrying
its
full
“ practical
capacity,” 200
gallons per minute (26 fixture units) , for the 3-inch stack or a known
fraction of this;
(2) that a vent which will relieve the pressure effect
at the point of maximum effect is ample for all other points; and
(3)
that no positive or back pressure greater than 1 inch and no negative
pressure or partial vacuum less than 1 inch of water, measured from
atmospheric pressure as the zero,
is to be developed in any branch
drain connecting to the stack above the house drain.
It should be
kept in mind that pressure variations in the stack which can not
possibly be transmitted
to
a fixture trap have no bearing on
the
problem.
We
are only concerned with the pressure
effects
in the
branches, whether vented or unvented.
The most widely distributed pressure effect
is the production of
partial vacuums, and it should receive first consideration.
The partial
vacuums
are generally due to
the
aspirating
effect of
the stream
of water in the stack flowing past the opening of a branch waste or
soil pipe.
The magnitude of the effect is evidently a function of the
volume of water per unit length and its velocity.
However, the most
practical way, considering the many modifications of conditions to be
encountered, seems to
b*e to work for the
size of vent required
to
relieve the effect for the conditions producing the maximum effect.
Evidently,
since
the
aspirating
effect increases with increase
in
velocity, the maximum will be obtained with a vertical stack open at
the bottom.
With the stack closed at the top it is possible to pro-
duce vacuums limited only by the vapor tension
of water.
J. E.
Denton
at Stevens
Institute,
about
1890, under
these
conditions
produced vacuums
equivalent
to
25.25
inches
of mercury.
Such
results have no application except to show the necessity of keeping
the
stack
top
open.
We
have,
therefore,
experimented with
the
stack top open or only partially closed to simulate
frost closure.
.
Pressure Effects in a Stack-Vented System.—With the 3-inch
stack 33 feet long
(fig. 46) unvented except through the open top
water was introduced through a P trap and Y fitting
at the rate of
200 gallons per minute and measurements taken in 3-inch Y fittings
at intervals
of
5 feet 10 inches,
beginning
at
a
point
10
inches
below
the
entrance
point.
The mean of two independent sets of
measurements
is
plotted
in
Figure
47.
The maximum
of
any
individual pressure reading was 31.3 inches of water vacuum at the
point 10 inches below the entrance point.
Measurements taken in a
2-inch stack at a point 7 inches below the entrance gave a maximum
of 28.5 inches of water vacuum when water was flowing into the stack
at 90 gallons per minute,
12 fixture units.
Other measurements in
Y and sanitary T branches indicate that there is slight difference in
the aspirating effects produced at Y or sanitary T branch inlets with

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
115
branches either 2 or 3 inches diameter.
Figure 48 shows the curve
of pressures obtained in the 2-inch stack 34 feet high open at both
ends and water introduced at one point 29 feet from the bottom at
the rate of 90 gallons per minute.
Figure 49 is the curve of pressures
for the same 2-inch stack with water introduced simultaneously at
Fig. 46.—Experimental stack and vent system for determining air movements in a plumbing system
two points
and P2 12 feet 4 inches apart, each at the rate of 45
gallons per minute.
These determinations show conclusively that
the maximum aspirating effect under these conditions
is below and
near a point of entrance and were made principally for the purpose
of verifying this fact.
Partial Vacuums and Vent
Requirements.—The next

in a branch waste connecting
to

of water.
(See discussion of factor of safety in a later part of the report for
justification of
this.)

Numerous arrangements of vent pipes of various sizes and lengths
were attached to the 2 and 3 inch stacks, with vents connecting at
one or two levels, and water introduced at different rates at one or
two
levels.
Pressure measurements were made in the vents near
their
connections
with
the
stack
in
each
arrangement.
Further
variations were made by partially
closing
the stack tops in imita-
tion of frost closure and by adding short horizontals
to the lower
end of the stack.
An anemometer was set in the end of the vent
in each case to determine the velocity of air in the vent.

RECOMMENDED PIjUMBTNG REQUIREMENTS
Without going into details of other determinations we may sum-
marize the results for 2 and 3 inch stacks as follows: A 2-inch vent
20 feet long with 3 elbows, equivalent to approximately 36 feet of
straight pipe
is
sufficient
to prevent
a vacuum in a branch from
a 3-inch stack greater than
1 inch of water, with the stack carrying
200 gallons per minute.
A lj-inch vent 14 feet long with 3 elbows
Fig. 49.—Pressure curve for a 2-inch stack, water introduced at rate of 45 gallons per minute each at Pi
and P 2 , pressure measurements at P3, P<, Ps, and Pe
equivalent to 23 feet of straight pipe is sufficient to prevent a vacuum
in a branch from a 3-inch stack greater than 1.0 inch of water, with
the stack carrying 100 gallons per minute.
A
1-inch pipe 22 feet
long with
1 elbow, equivalent to 24 feet of straight pipe,
is sufficient
to prevent a vacuum in a branch from a 2-inch stack greater than
0.5 inch of water, with the stack carrying 90 gallons per minute.

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
119
The above values in connection with rates of air flow in the vents
measured simultaneously, and laws of flow of gases under pressure
enable a fairly close approximation of requirements for main vents to
relieve the aspirating effects in 2 and 3 inch stacks within the measured
limits of stack capacities.
The laws of flow of gases referred to are
expressed by the equation: W
PIP
Id
in which V is the velocity or
volume per unit time, the value depending on the units employed, P
the drop in pressure, D the diameter of the pipe,
l the length of the
pipe, d the density of the gas, and K a constant whose value depends
on the units employed.
Allowing the development of a vacuum equal
to
1 inch of water gives a drop in pressure through the vent of 1 inch
of water.
Evidently the intensity of the vacuum produced is depend-
ent
on
the intensity
of
the
aspirating
effect and on the rate
at
which the vent pipe will deliver air to the point of connection under
the drop in pressure thus created.
Therefore, pipes that will deliver
air at the same rate under the same drop in pressure are equivalent
in venting effects.
Calculations made from the preceding data and other data not
herein recorded indicate that a straight vent pipe 36 feet long 0.9
inch in diameter would prevent the production of a vacuum in a branch
from a 2-inch stack greater than 1 inch of water, with the stack carry-
ing 90 gallons per minute.
The result is believed to be dependable,
since similar calculations made for other sizes of pipes were checked
very closely by measurements of the kind employed.
A 0.9 inch vent,
if available,
is an impractical size to employ, and
the data are valuable only for purposes of calculation.
There appear
to be good reasons for not employing any vent less than 1J inch in
diameter.
The following tables, adapted from tables for flow of gases under
low pressures, are presented as a basis for extension of the data ob-
tained.
The calculations for short lengths of pipe have been carried
through on the assumption that the short length in question
is a
part of a longer pipe in which the pressure gradient is as indicated.
In
other words, no correction has been made for the end effects observed
in fluid flow through short pipes which would decrease the rate of
flow somewhat.

Back Pressures and Vent Requirements.
The maximum back
air pressures can not be readily determined by experiment due to

the tendency to develop a head
of water in the lower part of the
stack as the conditions producing maximum
air pressures
are ap-
proached.
However,
it may be shown theoretically,
that,
in gen-
eral, the vent required to relieve maximum aspirating effects is suffi-
cient
to
prevent
detrimental back
pressures,
provided
the house
drain and stack base
fitting have the proper capacity
to prevent
back-water effects.
Assuming a condition in which the house drain
is closed to the
passage of air from the stack and an inflow of air, then the volume
rate at which air must be removed from the lower portions of the
stack, in order that the pressure may not rise above
1 inch of water
measured from atmospheric pressure,
will be equal
to
the rate
of
displacement by the discharge into the &tack; that
is, equal to the
rate of inflow into the stack.
The “ practical capacity” (see p. 101)
determined for the type
of construction under consideration, was
used
as a basis for determining vent requirements for the relief of
maximum aspirating effects.
On the same basis under the assumed
condition the vent required for a 3-inch stack to prevent the produc-
tion of a back pressure greater than 1 inch of water must be capable
of carrying air under the difference of pressure at a volume rate equal
to the “ practical capacity” of the 3-inch stack, namely, 200 gallons
per minute.
Reference
to Table
6 shows that a
lj-inch pipe
16
feet long, a 2-inch pipe 64 feet long, a 2i-inch pipe 169 feet long, or a
3-inch pipe 600 feet long have approximately that capacity.
It
is conceivable that in rare instances a condition might occur
in which a piston effect would be produced, driving the total volume
of
air
in
the stack through
the
vent.
Under
this
condition
the
volume of air passing through the vent would not be greater than
the difference between the total volume of air in the stack ahead of
the piston and the water content in the same portion of the stack.
Allowing a maximum velocity, 30 feet per second of fall to be attained
in a 3-inch stack in a two or three story building, the maximum rate
at which
air would have
to be removed would be 660 — 200 = 460
gallons per minute.
Under a pressure difference of
1 inch of water
the lengths of 1J, 2,
2-J, and 3 inch pipe that will remove air at that
rate are 3,
12, 39, and 110 feet, respectively.
In this connection it
should be kept in mind that with vent connections
at each
floor
level below the top floor the vent stack is not called upon to function
throughout its entire length as a relief to back pressure but only in
the first 10 or 20 feet at its base, since aspirating effects are produced
in the upper portions of the stack when back pressures are produced
at the base.
The portion operating in relief to back pressure may
thus be under a greater difference in pressure than the 1 inch of water
allowed.
To illustrate, suppose P2 in Figure 46
is near the base of
the stack, and that water is flowing in the stack at a rate sufficient

122
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
to produce back pressure, or a positive pressure measured from at-
mospheric pressure as zero, equivalent to + 1 inch of water,
at the
same time Pv being higher on the stack and near the point of entrance
of water, will be under reduced pressure; that
is, under a negative
pressure
measured
from
atmospheric
pressure
as
zero.
Suppose
this negative pressure
is equivalent to — 1
inch
of water, then the
difference of pressure in the vent between P2 and P 1 willbe + 1 — ( — 1) =
+ 2 inches of water, and there will be a flow of air from P2 to P 1
under a differential head of 2 inches of water.
The effective pressure
in the vent
is measured between
the
absolute pressure
at P2 and
another absolute pressure somewhat lower than atmospheric.
There
is thus produced,
in systems
in which both
aspiration
and back
pressure are present, a certain amount of recirculation of air in the
lower portions of the system giving greater relief in this region than
is obtained when the entire length of vent stack is functioning in one
direction only.
It
is impossible to assign any definite value to the
extent of the relief due to recirculation of air, since it will vary with
conditions
of installation and volume
of water discharged.
How-
ever, the extent of recirculation
of
air without doubt increases as
the intensity of back pressure increases with volume of discharge.
It
is therefore concluded that the vent required to relieve maxi-
mum aspirating effects if extended down undiminished into the region
of back pressures is sufficient to relieve the latter effect, except under
conditions where a static head due to back water is developed in the
stack.
This last condition is one that must be avoided by a proper
proportioning of the house drain and base fitting to the peak discharge
of the system.
Self-siphonage and Vent Requirements.—The vent required
to
prevent
self-siphonage may be
considered
on
a
similar
basis.
Any vent that will supply air to the waste or soil line at a volume rate
equal to that of the fixture discharging through the line will prevent
a siphon pull on the trap greater than the pressure difference neces-
sary to produce this rate of flow in the vent line.
Reference to the
table on flow of air in pipes shows that under a difference of pressure of
1 inch of water a 1-inch pipe 16 feet long will deliver air at the rate of
59 gallons per minute, a rate greater than the rate of discharge of
any single fixture in a dwelling.
In fact, with a vent of this size and
length the pull on the trap of such a fixture would be much less than
1 inch of water, since the vent pipe will begin to deliver air as soon as
a difference in pressure begins to develop.
It is evident then that the
vent of the size most practical to install will be ample to prevent any
loss in the trap seal of the fixture from self-siphonage.
For convenience we have plotted the results in Figure 50, giving
a chart from which the size of vent stack required for the 3-inch
soil stack may be read when the peak load or probable maximum dis-

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
123
charge and the total developed length of the vent stack are known.
For example,
the coordinate point for an estimated peak load
of
180 gallons per minute, 24 fixture units, and a developed length of
vent stack of 100 feet
lies between the curves for a 2-inch and a
2J-inch vent, therefore, for such an installation a 2§-inch vent stack
is required for a 3-inch soil stack of this height and peak load.
The curves
are
plotted from
results
of rough measurements
in
gome
respects,
but
calculations made
from
these
measurements
check measurements on rate of flow of air made at the same time so
closely, to the nearest unit in many cases, that the results are believed
to be more accurate than a casual review would imply.
At any rate
they
are believed
to be
sufficiently
accurate,
in view
of the
rigid
Fig.
50.—Chart for determining the permissible length of main vent of a given diameter for a 3-inch soil
or waste stack when the maximum discharge through it is known
restriction imposed and the fact that only rough approximations are
possible in the application.
The method may readily be extended to other and larger sizes of
soil
stacks
if
the
demand
justifies,
and
certain
refinements
in
methods of measurements are also possible
if closer approximations
are desired.
It
is interesting to note the relation of vent requirements for the
2 and 3 inch stacks with volumes of flow equal to their rated capaci-
ties, 90 and 200 gallons per minute, respectively.
For vents of the
same developed total length the requirements are approximately ex-

There
are good reasons for believing that the same relation holds for larger-
sized stacks.

124
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
The relation
of rates
at which
air
is moved through the vents
during the discharge
is
also
interesting and may serve
to answer
some questions raised with reference to the use
of the 3-inch
soil
stack.
With equal volumes of flow in the 2 and 3 inch stack and
with
vents
that
allowed
approximately
the same vacuum
to be
produced at the point of connection
of the vent to the stack, the
ratio of the rates by volume at which
air was drawn through the
vents was found
to be
1
to
5.
The ratio of the fourth powers of
the
diameters
of
the
stacks
2 4/3
4 = 16/81 = 1
to
5,
approximately.
This not only checks the preceding equation for vent requirements
for 2 and 3 inch stacks carrying their full practical capacities
(see
p. 101), but also indicates the requirement
of a larger vent for the
3-inch stack when the two stacks are carrying equal volumes, pro-
vided
the volumes approach
the
practical
capacity
of
the 2-inch
stack.
A similar relation may be expected for 3 and 4 inch or 5
and 6 inch stacks, probably more marked than for the small stacks,
since with
1 inch difference in diameter the ratio of the smaller to
the larger cross section of two pipes increases with increase in size.
MODIFYING CONDITIONS
Numerous conditions are encountered in service which may produce
sufficient modifying effects on the functioning of a plumbing system
to justify special provisions.
Among these the effects of heavy rains,
of submerged sewer outfall, of strong winds over the stack tops, and
of closure or partial closure
of stack tops by frost or snow have
received special attention and have been made the subject of experi-
ments to determine the magnitude of the effects and a means of pre-
venting or alleviating them.
These are grouped together here for
discussion and for convenience of reference.
All the experiments were made on complete plumbing test installa-
tions, and specific data for some will be found in the report on such
test, installations.
Heavy Rains.—The only direct effect of heavy rains on a plumb-
ing system is encountered when a combined sewer system is employed.
There is no doubt that a complete separation of storm and sewage
mains greatly simplifies the problem of house drainage.
When the
street mains are combined sewers, the problem would be simplified
to a lesser degree by separate connections to the street main.
Means of introducing water into the house drain at known rates
was provided.
Figure 51 shows a typical arrangement providing for
the introduction
of the water through rain leader A ahead
of the
stack, or through rain leader B, beyond the stack, or simultaneously
through both rain leaders.
The worst conditions were encountered
with storm water introduced ahead of the stack discharge as through
A, Figure 51.
The effects in the stack were only slightly less with

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
125
storm water at the same total rate equally divided between A and B.
The
effects were appreciably
less with storm water introduced
at
the same rate through B alone.
Only one distance, approximately
6 feet between soil stack and rain leader B connection to the house
drain, was employed.
It
is evident that the farther from the
soil
stack the rain-leader connection on the sewer side
is removed,
the
less the effects of storm water will be felt in the plumbing stacks.
The effect of storm water in all cases is an increase in back pressures
around
the base
of
the
stack,
the
effects increasing
rapidly with
increase in the rate of introduction
of storm water.
This
is
true
even with a house drain of sufficient capacity to carry off the total
discharge from stack and rain leaders
if
it were introduced
to the
house drain at one point only.
The apparent decrease in carrying
capacity of the house drain is evidently due to two or more streams
entering it from different directions.
If the combined discharge from
the stacks and rain leaders exceeds the carrying capacity of the house
drain under its own head, the result
is backwater into the base of
the
stack.
When
the backwater
extends upward
into
the
stack
above the level of the lowest fixtures, it is impossible to protect the
traps
of
such
fixtures
completely by
venting.
It
is
necessary,
therefore, to look for the cure by insuring an ample capacity in the
house drain.
Detrimental effects may be further reduced or rendered
less liable to occur by giving the greatest possible vertical distance
between the lowest level of fixture inlets and the house drain when
this
distance
is
short.
Whether the combined
or separate sewer
systems
are employed,
there
is
a
distinct advantage in having a
vertical distance of at least 3 feet between the lowest fixture inlet
to the stack and the house drain, the distance increasing with the
height of the stack and volume of discharge through it.

126
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
The
plumbing
committee
has
agreed
that
an
allowance
for
a
rainfall
of 4 inches per hour
is
liberal, and that an allowance for
1,500 square feet
of roof or drained area was
sufficient
to include
all types
of the
small
dwelling
house
under
consideration
in
its
report.
Before
this agreement had been reached many
tests had
been made allowing for a
rainfall of 6 inches per hour over 1,200
square feet
of roof area.
If these rates seem too high to some,
it
should be remembered
that
a much lower
rate
of
rainfall
for an
extended period under certain conditions, in low-lying territory,
etc.,
may prove as detrimental as the higher rate for a short period of time.
A rate of rainfall 4 inches per hour discharges water to the sewer
at the rate of approximately 1 gallon per minute for every 24 square
feet of drained area, which
is equivalent to
1 fixture unit for every
180 square feet of drained area.
The house drain should have suffi-
cient capacity to carry
off the combined estimated peak discharge
from the stacks and the discharge from the drained area.
It is true
there
is
small chance
of
the two maximum
discharges
occurring
together, but the effects from the combined sewer are so detrimental
and
the
conditions
encountered
so
varied
that
this
allowance
in
capacity
will not give an unnecessarily large margin
of safety
in
low-lying territory and regions of frequent heavy rains.
Submerged
Drains.—The
effects
arising
from
a
submerged
house drain or submerged
outfall
of house drain are very similar
to those produced by an overcharged house drain in the combined
sewer system.
Tests were made with submerged outfall
(fig.
52),
from 2 inches up to 3 feet depth, the latter giving backwater in the
house drain to the base of the soil stack.
Increase in the size of the
house drain will afford slight,
if any, relief to this latter condition.
The only complete protection seems
to be
to specify construction
that
will insure the lowest fixtures being well above
the
level of
submergence, otherwise such fixtures
will be forced out
of service
during periods of submergence.
The problem
is not
to be solved
by experimentation.
House Traps.—The effects of a house trap
(fig.
53), or running
trap, in the house drain are similar to those arising from a partially
submerged drain.
Whether the house trap
is vented or unvented
the
first effect
is a decrease in the carrying capacity of the house
drain due to the added resistance.
In the British
il Report of the
Departmental
Committee
on
the
use
of
Intercepting
Traps
in
House Drains,” 1 following thorough investigation, both experimen-
tal and by observation on systems in use, the advantages and
dis-
advantages of intercepting traps are fully discussed.

PHYSICS OP PLUMBING SYSTEMS

Our experiments have shown that the effect of an unvented trap
in the house drain
is similar
to that of partial submergence.
For
heavy discharges with the trap either vented or unvented the effect
is similar to that
of a considerable degree of submergence.
With
the trap vented on the house side, for small discharges not sufficient
to
fill the house drain to the point of closing the vent, the effect is
practically that of an open house drain.
There seems to be no case
in which the house trap increases the capacity of the system.
Offsets in Stacks.— Many questions have been asked concerning
the effects of offsets in soil or waste stacks.
We may answer these
questions as far as the data at hand and theoretical considerations
justify conclusions.
If the
offset
is above the highest fixture con-
nections to the stack, there can be but slight effect on the functioning
of the system.
If the
offset
is below the lowest point
of fixture
connections to the stack, the effect will be similar to that from a
house drain at the same level as the
offset.
The longer the offset
Fig. 52.—Submerged outfall of house sewer
Fig. 53.—Vented running trap
the more nearly the effects will approach those of a house drain at
the same level.
The farther the
offset
is placed below the lowest
fixture connection the more nearly the effect will approach that of
the straight stack.
The effect of offsets in the stack between levels
of fixture connections to the stack is problematical and will doubtless
be found to vary with different installations.
This last is a condition
of construction which should be avoided when possible and which,
if impossible
to
avoid,
should be safeguarded by additional vent
connections to the stack at the fixture levels on either side of the offset.
Winds.^-The
effect
of winds was obtained by directing an
air
current over the stack tops by means of a motor-driven fan of the
propeller type
(fig.
54).
By means of rheostats the velocity could
be varied up to 45 miles per hour (55 miles per hour U. S. Weather
Bureau rating).
The frame carrying the motor was constructed to
permit
adjustment
directing
the
current
horizontally
or
at
an
inclination of 30° to the horizontal in either direction.
The effect
of air currents was studied in connection with complete plumbing-
test installations.
All of the tests involving wind effects were made

128
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
on systems with 3-inch soil stacks, 2-inch waste stacks, and 4-inch
house drains.
With the system idle, the 2-inch waste line closed and the end of
the house drain open
the maximum
effect obtained by a 45-mile
per hour air current directed horizontally over the 3-inch stack top
was a decrease in pressure in the system of 0.2 inch of Water.
With
the end of the house drain submerged, giving a system closed at the
lower end, a decrease in pressure of 0.36 inch of water was produced
by
a 45-mile per hour current
directed
horizontally and
0.4 inch
of water by a 45-mile per hour current directed upward at 30° to
the horizontal.
With fixtures on the system discharging, the wind effect was gener-
ally masked
or shut
off from unvented fixture branches below the
e>J
Fig. 54.—Apparatus for producing air current over stack top
point of discharge.
In individually vented branches and unvented
branches above
the
point
of
discharge
the
combined
effect was
the sum of the separate wind and fixture effects.
In no case was a
combined
effect observed greater than that indicated by the addi-
tive relation.
There seems
to be no ready means
of protecting
against wind
effects when the vent stack
or vent
lines
are connected
into
the
soil stack before passing through the roof, since they are transmitted
more readily to vented than to unvented fixtures during use and as
readily during idle times.
In view of the small effects encountered,
it seems reasonable to assume that in the small dwelling house they
will be taken care of by factors of safety referred to elsewhere.
A
considerable
degree
of
protection would be
afforded
in
tall
buildings or other buildings exposed to very high winds by running
the soil stacks and vent stacks separately through the roof and con-

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
129
necting them together above the highest fixture inlets and branch-
vent connections,
thus giving an opportunity for relief
of pressure
differences
above
the
fixture
connections.
Then
only when
the
effect was of the same kind and intensity over both stacks would
the
full intensity reach the fixture traps.
Frost Closure.—Frost closure was simulated by setting sections
of pipe
of various diameters and length into the stack tops.
No
measurable effect was produced by setting a li-inch pipe 20 inches
long into the tops of the 3-inch stacks of the different systems.
A
1-inch pipe 12 inches long set in the 3-inch stack only slightly in-
creased the vacuum produced by a heavy discharge from the fixtures.
No doubt the effect would be felt more with an increase in the volume
of discharge.
With a complete closure of the stack top the water
was sucked from one
or more
traps by the discharge
of a
single
water-closet on
the system.
This
occurs whether
the
traps
are
individually vented or not provided the stack tops are completely
closed.
Floor Drains.—The floor drain, though not itself a modifying
condition,
is considered
in
this connection because
the
type and
position in which
it may be installed will be determined by such
modifying conditions.
No
tests were made with true floor drains.
However, tests were made with traps connected to the soil stack near
its base and connected into the house drain on the sewer side.
There seems to be no reason why a floor drain might not be con-
nected into a
soil or waste stack when conditions permit, subject
to the same requirements in venting,
etc.,
as a fixture connecting
into the stack at the same point.
If the house drain is sufficient in
size for the system and located high enough to be free from back-
water
effects, a floor drain might connect directly to a nominally
horizontal house drain at a point 5 feet or more from the base of the
stack on the sewer
side without danger from
aspiration
or back
pressure, and, hence, need not be separately vented unless its form
is such as to induce self-siphonage or for other good reasons.
The
velocity of flow attained in a house drain is insufficient to produce
aspiration, and the head is not great enough at
such a point to pro-
duce sufficient back pressure to endanger the trap seal.
In all places
where there
is any danger of backwater or overcharged sewers the
floor drain,
if installed, should be fitted with a suitable backwater
valve.
SIPHONAGE OF FIXTURE TRAPS
The subject of trap siphonage is somewhat more complicated than
expected from a casual consideration.
Whether the effect is due to
self-siphonage or siphonage by aspiration or a vacuum transmitted
to the trap from some other part of the system, the extent of siphon-
20141 0—29
10

130
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
age is evidently dependent on the intensity of the pull and a quan-
tity factor
or, in other words, the energy that may be expended on
the trap.
In the case of aspirating effects the energy is great, and a
considerable volume of air must be moved into the system to protect
the trap when the intensity is equal to or greater than the pressure
represented by the seal depth of the trap.
The venting of a branch
line on which a trap
is placed prevents, by the introduction of
air,
the intensity of the vacuum produced from
rising above
a
fixed
value.
The problem of venting
to protect against aspiration and
back pressure was taken up in an
earlier section.
These same con-
siderations enter into the problem of self-siphonage.
Self-siphonage.—The intensity
of the pull in self-siphonage
is
determined by two different causes which may be present at the same
time.
The first is an unbalanced column of water as represented in
the common siphon.
The second is the momentum pull exerted by
the moving column of water, which
is present whether the pipe
is
horizontal, vertical, or inclined and its intensity is dependent on the
length of the column or length of
filled pipe and
its velocity.
In
vertical pipes the former cause is predominant.
In pipes approach-
ing the horizontal the latter is predominant.
The quantity factor
is dependent on the volume of the pipe, hence, on the length of the
pipe.
The volume
of
pipe
inducing
the
siphonage
effect
is
in
small fixture
traps
relatively small, hence,
a small volume
of
air
introduced is sufficient to prevent the intensity from rising to a point
that endangers the seal of the trap.
Before taking up the discussion of self-siphonage in detail we desire
to
call attention
to some very pertinent facts
in connection with
wide-bottom fixtures, such as bathtubs, kitchen sinks, and laundry
trays.
In the discharge from such fixtures a swirl is formed before
the fixture
is empty which draws
air through the
trap, tending to
reduce the intensity
of the pull toward the end
of the discharge.
There is a long trail discharge from such fixtures during which the
velocity in the waste pipes
is reduced with a resultant reduction in
the pull due to velocity.
Refer to Figure 55 for illustration of the
effects of swirl and
trail discharges.
In no case, using flat-bottom
fixtures, have we been able to reduce the final seal materially below
the normal full seal and in no case with such fixtures set in place
on a test system have we detected any reduction in seal.
With oval-bottom fixtures tending toward a funnel shape, as the
washbasin, it is essentially different.
In such fixtures the discharge
ends
abruptly with
a very short
swirl.
Self-siphonage
is
almost
certain when an unvented waste has a
vertical section greater in
length than the seal depth of the trap and followed by a horizontal
section of near the same diameter
(fig. 56)
.
If the entire waste from
the trap
is nominally horizontal
(fig. 57)
the momentum pull in its

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
131
Fig. 56 —Arrangement of waste pipe to produce self-siphonage of a fixture trap

132
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
full intensity is exerted at the end of the discharge.
In a “P” trap
a part of the water invariably flows back from the horizontal part of
the
trap.
At least a partial seal
is always
left.
Any seal left
is
theoretically sufficient to prevent air circulation from the plumbing
system to the room, except where the waste connects low on the
stack within the region of back pressure.
It of course may be com-
pletely destroyed by evaporation.
The degree of protection of traps
connecting to the stack above the region of back pressures is there-
fore dependent on the frequency of use as well as on the seal depth.
Because of the differences in siphonage effects in wide and oval-
bottom fixtures, except for a few independent tests to verify the facts
regarding wide-bottom fixtures, the laboratory tests were confined to
self-siphonage in washbasins.
Including a number of
tests on
fix-
Fig. 57.—Fixture and waste pipe to study effect of length of horizontal pipe on self-siphonage
tures set in place on the test installations, several hundred tests were
made.
Space will only permit detailed description of a few of the
most pertinent.

The unbalanced column of water in the waste is the same in each
case.
Evidently, then, the reduction in self-siphonage with reduc-
tion in size of outlet orifice is due to the slight reduction in velocity
thus produced.
An outlet orifice and tailpiece slightly less in diam-
eter than the trap and waste only slightly reduces the velocity in the
waste pipe, so does not materially affect the scouring effects.
At the
same time there is an increased velocity through the tailpiece itself,
giving a better scouring in this part which is always exposed to the
room.
It therefore seems reasonable and
offers many advantages
to allow the tailpiece of a fixture to be the nominal size smaller than
the trap, convenient for making a slip joint between the two.
2. To determine relative resistance to self-siphonage of unvented
plain P traps of various seal depths, tests were made with the fixtures
connected
to a 3-inch stack plumbing
test installation.
The oval
washbasin and bathtub were served by a common waste, 1£ inches
from the bathtub and 1 J inches from the basin.
The basin waste was
26 inches vertical from the outlet end of the trap to its connection
into a recessed combination Y and £ bend in the l|-inch bath waste
2
feet 6 inches from the stack.
The horizontal distance from the
basin outlet to the trap connection with the vertical waste was 15
inches.
The exact arrangement is unimportant, the point being to
secure a strong siphonage effect on the basin trap.
The data follow-
ing represents the effect of the combined discharge of the washbasin
and bathtub, which is stronger than that of the basin alone.
The
intensity and quantity pull were
practically
the same for each of
the
traps.
The
tailpiece of the basin had an internal diameter of
1£ inches, the internal diameter of the traps and basin waste were
approximately the same, l-^ inches.

These data, supported by other observations on seals retained by
traps of various seal depth of from 2 to 7 inches on different waste
lines, indicate a retained seal proportional to the depths of the normal
full seals.
Other considerations enter into the question of permitted
depths of seal.
The effect of seal depth on scouring properties has
not been specifically investigated.
However,
it is evident that the
scouring properties decrease with depth of seal, especially with refer-
ence
to heavy
materials.

offering less resistance to self-siphonage
is less resistant, because of
smaller volume of water, to loss of seal by evaporation.
We there-
fore suggest a minimum normal seal of 2 inches and a maximum of 4
inches as serviceable limits.
From a consideration of
all tests our
personal inclination
is toward a nominal seal depth of 3 inches for
washbasins not separately vented.

5. To determine the influence on self-siphonage of a 90° elbow in
a nominally horizontal unvented waste
(fig. 58) several independent
experiments were conducted.
No more
specific conclusions follow
from
these data than may be drawn from
other
experiments
in
which such an elbow was employed.
It
is sufficient to state that
an elbow in a nominally horizontal waste at a horizontal distance
from the vertical inlet arm
of the trap not greater than 18 to 20
inches reduces the self-siphonage effect.
This means that from the
standpoint of self-siphonage alone a greater length of pipe may be
permitted when an elbow
is placed within these limits than where
the waste pipe is straight from the trap to its connection with the
stack or a vented branch.
6. To determine the effect of fouled waste pipes on self-siphonage:
The experiments conducted for this purpose were not wholly satis-
factory because of the difficulties of securing representative fouling
of the waste pipes.
If extreme fouling
is assumed, such as
to
re-
duce the
cross
section
of the waste materially below
that
of the
fixture
outlet
orifice and
of
the
trap,
the
self-siphonage
is much
greater than
if we assume a slight degree
of fouling in which the
cross section of the waste
is not reduced below that of the fixture
outlet
orifice.
The whole question
of degree of fouling that takes
place in traps and small waste pipes in service is one that must be
decided from extended observation and specific records under actual
service
conditions.
Time and
facilities have not
permitted
such
observations.
The alternative
is to require construction that
will
tend
to reduce fouling
ol wastes
to a minimum and assume that
under such conditions the fouling that takes place will not reduce
the
cross-sectional
area
of
the
trap and waste below
that
of the

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
137
fixture
outlet
orifice and
tailpiece.
On
this assumption
the data
would permit an approximation
of allowable length
of horizontal
unvented waste.
It is necessary further to arbitrarily assume some
permissible degree of self-siphonage.
If no reduction of seal
is per-
mitted,
it
leads
to one
conclusion.
If any other remaining
seal
depth
is assumed,
it leads
to another
conclusion.
The plumbing
committee fixed on a minimum remaining seal of
1 inch as repre-
senting the limit
of satisfactory conditions in
tests for traps with
nominal 2-inch
full
seals.
Any reduction in seal below this value
was considered unsatisfactory.
In this connection we wish to say
that we believe this
is a fair limit for a trap with a 2-inch normal
seal.
In
general,
a remaining
seal
of not
less than
one-half
the
normal full seal would more nearly represent the dividing line be-
tween
safe and unsafe
conditions than an
arbitrarily
fixed value
irrespective of normal
seal.
An S or a P trap seal may be drawn
to the point of breaking the seal with a loss of approximately one-
half its full seal, after which it may be subjected repeatedly to the
same or a smaller strain with no further loss of seal.
Reference
to
the data shows
that with a
fixture-outlet
orifice
equal to the cross section of the waste a clean straight waste laid
one-fourth inch fall to the foot and 2 feet 8 inches long measured
from the center of the inlet arm of the trap did not reduce the nominal
2-inch seal of trap below 1 inch; and that with a 90° elbow 13 inches
from the trap and 5 feet 2 inches of clean waste laid one-fourth inch
fall to the foot beyond the elbow did not reduce the nominal 2-inch
seal below 1.5 inches.
It is a fact, although not shown in the data,
that an increase in the length of the section beyond the elbow pro-
duces slight,
if any, increase in self-siphonage effect until the outlet
end of the waste falls below the dip of the trap.
No specific recommendations are made as to the allowable length
for an unvented horizontal waste from a washbasin.
We
desire,
however,
to
call
attention
again
to
certain modifying conditions:
A slight reduction in the
size of the outlet
orifice of a washbasin
appreciably decreases the self-siphonage; a decrease in the size of
the waste by fouling or other causes tends to increase self-siphonage.
In general, if a washbasin is placed in a region
of no or
slight back
pressure, there is no particular danger if the seal left is reduced below
1
inch, except as
it may be affected by the factor of evaporation.
The washbasin
is, in general, the most frequently used fixture of the
bathroom group and the factor of evaporation is usually negligible.
On the grounds of self-siphonage an increase in depth of normal
seal would permit a proportional
increase
in
allowable length
of
unvented waste.
There is no necessity for limiting the length of an
unvented horizontal waste laid with a fall of cue-fourth inch to the

138
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
foot from a bathtub, kitchen sink, and laundry tray on the grounds
of sclf-siphonage, except as it is limited by the requirement that the
outfall end may not be below the dip of the trap.
A long sloping
waste
(fig. 59) with the sloping section of the same cross section aa
the
trap
and
horizontal
section
will
not
produce
self-siphonage
when the angle
of inclination from the horizontal
is greater than
30°,
provided
the
horizontal
section
is not
in
itself
sufficient
to
induce self-siphonage.
This is true in service only if the cross section
of the inclined part does not become materially reduced by fouling.
Whether
it
is a practical form of installation or not depends on its
liability to foul to such an extent.
Permissible Length of Unvented Horizontal Branch Waste
Pipes.
Four reasons for limiting the length of an unvented horizon-
tal waste or soil branch have been advanced.
These are increased
danger
of self-siphonage, increased
corrosion due to decreased
cir-
culation
of
air,
increased
liability
to
stoppage
or
fouling due
to
decreased velocity of flow and increased cooling and fouling area and
decreased facility of use of fixtures due to sluggish action in long hori-
zontals.
If the reasons advanced were
all of the same weight and
supported by uncontrovertible evidence of the
effects claimed, the
problem would be immediately limited to the one placing the greatest
restriction.
As it stands there is some uncertainty,
especially con-
cerning the
effect
of long unvented branches on
corrosion.
There
are no data bearing directly on this effect available.
The opinions
expressed by practical men are based for the most part on the fact

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
139
that long unvented branches have been found badly corroded in many
cases.
There is no evidence at hand that a vented branch in the same
position and service would not have corroded to the same or greater
extent, or that the corrosion was due to lack of air circulation in the
branch.
Experiments conducted at Harvard University during the
past year for the plumbing committee have shown that induced cir-
culation of air in an unvented horizontal
1 £ inches in diameter takes
place up to a length of about 2 feet, due to the circulation of air in
the stack to which the unvented branch is connected.
The same and
other earlier experiments show a fairly rapid change of air by con-
vection
currents and
diffusion up
to
a much
greater
length.
It
would seem, then, that
if the contention that lack of air circulation
hastens corrosion were granted there would still be slight grounds for
Fig. 60.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of horizontal waste pipe on velocity and scour
limiting the length of an unvented branch to less than 6 feet.
The
same arguments might be applied to any unvented branch whether
horizontal or vertical.
In any event, it is a question
of the
life of
the pipe rather than one of functioning until the pipe has corroded
through or has corroded to the extent
of
materially
reducing the
cross-sectional
area.
The questions of stoppage,
fouling, decreased rate of flow apply
also to
all horizontal wastes and drains whether they are vented or
not.
In fact, the general
effect of a vent in a branch waste
is to
decrease the rate of flow.
Compare Figures 60 and 61 to the same
wastes unvented.
With
the vents shown
in
the waste
lines
the
effective head on the horizontal waste will be measured by
b.
In
the same systems unvented the effective head will be measured by a.
It is evident, without experimentation to show the magnitude of the
effects, that from the standpoint of drainage alone long wastes leading

140
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
directly from the trap on the horizontal or with small gradient are
bad practice and should he reduced to the minimum consistent with
other requirements.
As to self-siphonage and its relation to the limit of the allowable
length of an unvented horizontal waste pipe, our experiments indicate
that the slope should be confined between the limits of a fall of one-
fourth inch to the foot and one-half inch to the foot, and that the outlet
end should not extend below the dip of the trap.
It will be observed
that from a consideration of self-siphonage
effects alone there are so
Fig. 61.—Diagram to illustrate the effect of a vertical section of waste pipe on velocity and scour
many conflicting elements that any conclusion is largely a matter of
judgment.
For these reasons and because of the uncertainty of the
effect of long unvented branches on corrosion it is difficult to make
specific
recommendations.
However,
the
following
table
sum-
marizes the results of the experiments, giving what are believed to
be safe maximum lengths for nominally horizontal unvented wastes
from fixtures connected to a stack or vented branch at points where
they are free from detrimental aspirating or back-pressure
effects.
It is to be understood that they refer to self-siphonage only.
Pos-
sible increase in self-siphonage due
to fouling has been taken into
account.

These lengths are from the center of the trap to stack or larger
vented branch waste and would permit one 90° elbow in the waste
at a distance not greater than 18 inches from the inlet arm of the
trap.
Elbows in other positions or added elbows should be counted
as equivalent lengths of pipe.
Resealing
Traps.—It
should
be
noted
that
the
preceding
restrictions refer to the use of plain P traps.
The experiments with
“reseating,”
so-called
“antisiphon”
traps,
owing
to
difficulties
encountered in satisfactorily fouling the traps and in determining the
kind and degree of fouling to be expected in different kinds of service,
have not been completed.
The tests have shown that “resealing” traps when clean retain a
greater
seal under a suction
test and
are more
resistant
to back
pressure with the seal left after the suction test than clean unvented
plain P traps of the same full seal depth when subjected to the same
suction and pressure
tests.
The same
is true to a lesser degree for
resealing traps of the better types, fouled by artificial means.
The tests so far indicate that there is a field in which a judicious
use of the better types of resealing traps would be found a distinct
advantage, such as in places where there is danger of self-siphonage
or of aspiration and back pressure within certain limits and where
structural difficulties are encountered that make the venting of the
plain trap costly or impractical.
The data are not yet at hand to
determine to what extent “resealing” traps may be used with safety.
With data available it will be found difficult to state in a general way
the extent
of
their use without opening a way for misuse under
certain conditions.
Where an unvented plain trap will serve there
is no special advantage gained in using
a “resealing”
trap
at an
added cost, and there is no advantage gained by the use of “resealing”
traps in places where it is necessary to vent individually regardless of
the kind of trap used.
It is obvious that, tied up as the question of the use of “resealing”
traps
is, with efficiency of functioning and economy of construction

142
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
and surrounded,
as
it
is, by strong prejudices both for and against
their use, any general regulations must be administered with con-
siderable latitude of discretionary powers
if full advantageous use of
11 resealing ” traps is to be obtained and no abuse
is to result.
Such
discretionary powers would, of course, assume a complete knowledge
of the subject on the part
of the administrative
officer and might
easily lead to special privileges.
It is unfortunate that the data are
not available to enable us at least to state the limits beyond which
resealing traps may not be used with safety.
The same questions are bound to rise with respect to other usages
in plumbing work; for example,
that
of individual venting of fix-
tures.
With any rules that may be applied generally with safety
many places will be found where we could go beyond the limits stated
in the rules with perfect safety were there a competent authority
to prescribe the limits for the condition encountered.
Back Venting.—In connection with the employment of individual
or group vents as a protection against siphonage and pressure effects
Fig. 62.—Diagram to illustrate type of venting liable to clog
or as a means of insuring air circulation, it is of extreme importance
that the position and manner of making the vent connection receive
special attention and be safeguarded by regulations.
The
experi-
ments on fouling conducting at the Bureau of Standards and numer-
ous instances cited for service installations indicate that there
is a
strong liability
of a vent line becoming completely closed near
its
junction with the waste line when conditions for fouling are favorable.
It has been shown that vents are required at certain points in a
complex plumbing installation of two or more floors in order to pro-
tect the trap
seals.
It
is evident that a vent poorly installed has
not met
the condition and
that one
that has become completely
stopped in service
is as bad as
if no vent had been installed.
The
method of crown venting has been generally prohibited because of
liability
of
closure by
fouling.
Some forms
of
continuous waste
and vent may give rise to conditions quite as bad as crown venting.
The “ continuous waste and vent” has been favored by the plumb-
ing committee.
As “ continuous waste and vent” is defined it would

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
143
permit the vent being taken off the top of a horizontal waste or the
continuation
of a horizontal waste
as
a vent.
For illustration
of
three distinct effects,
all of which fall within the definition of “con-
tinuous waste and vent/’
refer to Figures
62,
63, and
64.
Figure
62 represents a nominally horizontal waste vented from the top of a
combinationY and J bend in the horizontal waste line in which the waste
and vent are in the same vertical plane.
Assuming the same cross
sections of trap and waste throughout x-aj represents the approximate
Fig. 64—Diagram to illustrate type of venting liable to clog
hydraulic gradient when the waste line is flowing full under the head
in the fixture.
Evidently in an arrangement of this kind there will be
periodic back flow into the vent and strong liability to stoppage in
the vent.

zontal distance between the fixture and stack,
in which there
is a
vertical section,
c, following the point
of venting.
Here the vent
connection lies above the hydraulic gradient, x-y, therefore the vent
line is protected against back flow and consequent stoppage.
When
venting is necessary to protect trap seals, the type of venting repre-
sented in Figure 63
is believed
to be the best possible; that
is,
a
“continuous waste and vent” in which the vent is a continuation of
a vertical section of the waste.
The restriction necessary to insure
protection against back flow into the vent or vent connection would
be that ~ is equal to or greater than g

For small fixtures, a washbasin or kitchen sink, a might be
measured from the top of the fixture outlet with perfect safety, since
by the time the waste has become filled by the discharge the fixture
will have practically emptied.
Call
this new distance a

new hydraulic gradient is x
xy.
It will be observed that the direction
at which b leads into
c makes no difference.
To apply concretely
to a practical case suppose a washbasin with trap
set close to the
fixture and the waste from the trap leading directly into the wall,
thence vertically to the floor, and thence horizontally through the
floor to the stack.
Suppose a

relation-?a

It is recog-
nized that in the case of bathtubs and other fixtures which set low
on the floor it is impractical to attempt to hold any relation between
verticals and horizontals, such as suggested when a long waste leads
through the floor on which the fixture
is
set.
Figures
62 and 64
show that in this case the vent connection
is always below the hy-
draulic gradient for a full fixture and a full waste line.

in which
it would be
possible
to
hold
the
relation
^
so far as the dry vent
is con-
cerned.
The wet vent portion would be kept open by the discharge
of the fixture that it serves as a waste.
For this reason these types
of group venting are believed to be better than individual venting
when the one vent fully protects the traps of the two fixtures.
The preceding discussion has been based on the assumption that
the trap and its waste would be of the same nominal cross section
throughout.
If a gradation of sizes were employed in which the hori-
zontal section beyond the point
of vent connection were increased
over that of the parts preceding, the results would be modified.
The
purpose has been to emphasize the necessity of limiting permitted
lengths of vented horizontals if the vent is to be surrounded by condi-

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
tions favorable to its continuous operation in service and
if the best
scouring effects in the waste lines are to be secured.
It is not to be inferred that the following opinions and recommenda-
tions are based
entirely on the above
theoretical reasoning.
The
effects were observed in a general way during the experiments.
There
seems to be little chance of obtaining new data on the subject more
suitable for general application than the direct application
of the
principles of hydraulics.
Recommendations.—From a consideration of the subject of limita-
tion of length of small waste branches from all standpoints, facility of
drainage,
self-scouring of waste lines,
circulation of air, self-siphon-
age, stoppage of vents, some of which are mutually conflicting in
their requirements, the following is suggested as a solution
:
1. That the developed length of an unvented horizontal waste be
limited to 6 feet.
2. That the developed length of an unvented horizontal waste from
a washbasin or other oval-bottomed fixture be limited to 4 feet for
traps with nominal 2-inch seals and
6 feet for nominal
3-inch,
or
more, seals. 2
3. That a horizontal section of the vented portion of a waste be
limited to 6 feet, except when the vent is the continuation of a vertical
portion of the waste, in which case it may be extended to
c
(see
fig. 63), section b being in general the length necessary to make the
connection from the fixture to the vertical section,
c, in the partition
or wall, limited always by the condition pertaining to an unvented
horizontal waste.
4. That whenever practical a vent be the continuation of a vertical
section of the waste.
THE FACTOR OF SAFETY IN A PLUMBING SYSTEM AND DETER-
MINATION OF THE UPPER LIMIT OF SERVICE FOR A 3-INCH SOIL
STACK
The determination
of the allowable upper limits
of service
of a
given soil stack—that is, the determination of the number of fixtures
of different kinds or number of fixture units that may with safety be
drained into the stack—involves a consideration of
all parts of the
plumbing system in their relation to each other and unless extreme
care
is
exercised may lead
to
inconsistencies.
It
is necessary
to
know the maximum carrying capacity of the stack under the con-
ditions involved and the “peak load” determined or estimated from
the total number of fixtures of different kinds that are to be drained
into the stack.
The former has been determined for certain con-
8 The plumbing committee later
agreed
on a maximum developed length
of 5
feet permissible for
horizontal unvented waste pipes for all fixtures.

PHYSICS OF PLUMBIHG SYSTEMS
147
ditions by observation of known rates of discharge into the stack.
It is proposed to estimate the latter from predetermined maximum
rates of discharge from individual fixtures and probable coincident
discharge of these fixtures.
Before combining these
it
is necessary
to establish a reasonable factor
of
safety
and
to determine some
boundary lines for frequencies of coincidence that need or need not
be accounted for in estimating the “peak load.”
ESTABLISHMENT OF A FACTOR OF SAFETY
The establishment of a factor of safety is difficult because in reality
not one, but many factors of safety are involved.
With reference
to the pneumatics of the system the fixture traps are the weak points.
The variations in air pressure in the stacks themselves is of no im-
portance, as this is not transmitted to the traps.
In the determina-
tions for vent requirements a factor of safety of 2 against aspirating
effects has been proposed by the plumbing committee and used for
traps of 2-inch normal seal depth.
Recommended methods of con-
struction by which branches would be connected to points of mini-
mum aspirating effect, rather than at point of maximum
effect,
as
was done in determining vent requirements; the method employed of
always keeping the estimated peak discharge from
a permitted in-
stallation under the rated capacity for the stack; and the method of
alw;ays employing a vent
of the nearest
size larger than
the
cal-
culated required size to give this factor of safety, all operate to give
a factor of safety greater than the assumed one of
2.
The same
applies to back pressures, except that in regions where there
is no
aspirating effect, as is generally the case where there are strong back
pressures, the initial assumed factor of safety becomes 4 instead of 2
with trap seals of 2 inches employed.
In both aspects an increase
in normal seal depths of traps employed would increase the factor of
safety proportionally.
FUNCTIONAL FACTOR OF SAFETY DISTINGUISHED FROM STRUCTURAL
It should be kept in mind that this is a factor of safety in function-
ing and that it materially differs from a structural factor of safety.
A strain on the system sufficient to use up the entire factor of safety
can result in no more than a temporary decrease in
efficiency
of
functioning and no structural depreciation, except in the matter of
overflowing or flooding, which has no
direct connection with
the
matter
of
venting.
It
is
evident
from
the maximum
carrying
capacity of stacks, which is greatly in excess of the rated “practical
capacity” used in fixing the limits of service for a stack, that the
factor of safety would have to be greatly exceeded before any material
reduction
of efficiency of functioning occurred.
Apparently,
then,
the only danger is from overflowing or flooding, and this only when
the estimated “peak load” for the system approaches the maximum

148
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
carrying capacity of the stack, which is three or more times the rated
practical capacity.
The matter of local flooding of lateral branches
must
be
considered
separately from
the
requirements
for
stack
vents
and house
drains.
The
greatest
danger
of
overflowing
or
flooding,
except
local,
is from complete stoppage
of
the stack or
house drain, which may occur even with any size of stacks and even
with small loads.
In view of the preceding relations and in view of
certain
relations
of
frequencies
of
occurrence
in
the
probability
tables, it seems reasonable to assume that an estimated “peak load”
occurring once in the order of one year is ample allowance for fixing
the size of stacks, vents, and drains to the nearest size, and to assume
that a coincident discharge occurring once in the order of 10 or 100
years may be neglected.
Referring to Table
2,
it will be observed
for systems up to 12 water-closets that
if the probability of coinci-
dence of a given number of water-closets
is of the order of once in
one year the probability of coincidence of one more than this number
is of the order of once in 100 years.
Also, from a consideration of
the equations from which the tables were computed, the chance that
if a given number of water-closets in coincidence is exceeded it will
be exceeded by one and not more than one is of the order of 100 to 1.
A concrete illustration may be made for the 3-inch stack.
Refer-
ence to Table 2 shows that allowing for a rush period of one hour
daily the probability of overlapping coincidence of 4 out of 12 water-
closets on a system is once in 336 days, the probability of 5 out of 12
once in 56 years.
LIMITS OF SERVICE FOR A 3-INCH SOIL STACK
The rated “practical capacity” of the 3-inch stack for the type of
construction in which a
part, at least, of the waste pipes from the
small fixtures connect directly into the stack falls between the com-
bined discharge of 4 water-closets and that of 5 water-closets.
It is
therefore concluded that a 3-inch
soil stack with properly propor-
tioned house drain, lateral branches, and vents will efficiently serve
in this type of construction for 12 water-closets or their equivalent.
The requirements in house drain and vents may be taken from the
tables or charts for this or any smaller number of water-closets or
their equivalent.
This
is far in excess of the requirements for any
separate dwelling and would permit
its use to include a maximum
of 72 fixture units, or 8 complete bathroom groups of fixtures.
Increased by Methods of Construction.—We have previously
mentioned the possibility of extension of the limits of service of the
3-inch or other stacks by a slight change in methods of construction.
No doubt the limits could be extended without change in methods of
construction by increasing the size and number of vents.

PHYSIOS OF PLUMBING ‘SYSTEMS
149
It will be remembered that the ''practical capacity” of the 3-inch
stack was rated on the assumption that the stack may not flow full
at any point.
If the construction
is made such that no fixture
is
connected directly onto the stack, then there
is no reason why the
stack may not be permitted to flow full and even under a slight head.
Experiments have shown that a velocity of 30 feet per second in a
3-inch stack is attained in a fall of between 25 and 30 feet with a
possible maximum velocity of about 35 feet per second.
A 3-inch
stack flowing
full with a velocity of 30 feet per second
will carry
Fig. 67 —Diagram to illustrate type of yoke venting tending to increase the capacity of a system
water at the rate of 660 gallons per minute, approximately equivalent
to the combined discharge of 15 water-closets.
Reference to Table 2
shows that a carrying capacity of this amount would allow 100 water-
closets with an ample margin of protection against flooding or over-
flowing.
It would seem, then, that the service to which the 3-inch
stack may be adopted for certain types of buildings
is practically
unlimited.
Figures 67 and 68 illustrate a step in this direction, representing
single floors for two types of buildings which may be duplicated on
any number of floors up to the limit of service of the 3-inch stack.
With such an arrangement the soil stack will serve only as a carrier

150
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
during heavy discharges, each floor approximating the
effects in
a
separate small system.
No specific tests have been made with such
construction, but the data at hand enables us to approximate the
limits to which the 3-inch vent may be employed by extension of the
curves in Figure
50.
With bathroom units in corresponding posi-
tions on successive floors in apartment houses or hotels the type of
construction represented in Figure 67 might be carried to any height
with a 3-inch soil stack, the only precaution necessary being that of
insuring sufficient capacity in the house drain and base of stack con-
Fig. 68.—Diagram to illustrate type of yoke venting applied to larger toilet rooms
nection to the drain, one that
is necessary regardless of the size of
stack employed.
There are limits to the height to which a 3-inch
vent stack might be employed.
Estimates made on the
basis
of
Table 2 for probable coincident discharge and an extension of the
3-inch vent curve in Figure 50 to include higher rates of discharge
give an approximate maximum length of 3-inch vent stack of 150
feet.
Allowing for elbow or other reductions and for length of vent
above level of fixtures indicates a limitation of height for a 3-inch
vent to about 12 stories.
Up to this height the construction might
be a 3-inch soil stack, a 3-inch vent stack, and 3-inch main vent con-
nection on each floor.
Above that height an increase in size of vent
stack only would be required.
With lower structures on the same

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
151
plan both the vent stack and main vent connection might be reduced
below 3 inches.
The construction would serve equally well in duplex,
as indicated by dotted branch of double Y and branch vent connec-
tion, with only a small reduction in limited heights.
Figure 68 repre-
sents the same method applied to
office building toilet-room con-
struction.
As indicated these are very rough estimates, based as they are on
the extension of data obtained for vent requirements with smaller
“peak loads” than would be encountered in these larger systems.
However, we have elaborated
to a
considerable extent merely
to
emphasize the
possibilities
of service
of the 3-inch stack.
Before
any definite recommendation can be made
it will be necessary to
make further determinations and test the results thoroughly.
It should be observed that there are limitations for the employ-
ment of 3-inch stacks imposed by 3-inch lateral branches leading to
the stack for types of construction in which the number of fixtures
emptying into the stack on the same floor exceeds approximately
six water-closets, or their equivalent in fixture units, because of the
liability to local flooding.
No such restriction need be placed on
the employment of 4-inch stacks and 4-inch lateral branches to the
stack
in
the same plan
of construction
(fig.
68).
With a 4-inch
horizontal and water-closets set 30 inches apart the holding capacity
of the pipe and
closet bends
is approximately equal
to the
total
discharge from
all
the
water-closets
thus
placed
on
any
4-inch
horizontal.
There
is
therefore no
danger
of
flooding from
local
causes and the run-off during the discharge will practically insure
proper functioning with any possible combination of discharges of
water-closets on such
a
line, always assuming that
it
is properly
vented
to
protect
it
against pneumatic
effects.
It would
seem,
therefore, that there is no necessity for using a soil stack larger than
4 inches in diameter for any building, provided the construction
is
such as to protect the fixture traps from the pneumatic effects pro-
duced
in
the stack
itself.
Here,
again,
definite recommendations
are dependent on further experiments and a complete testing of the
plan.
The size of main vents or vent stacks required by the proposed
plan would be about the same as now commonly employed with the
4-inch
soil stack.
The required
size
of the house drain would be
dependent on the total number of fixtures on the system and the
kind of use for which it is intended.
SIMPLIFICATION OF PLUMBING CONSTRUCTION
The degree to which plumbing construction may be simplified and
the resultant reduction in cost depend to a large extent on the plan-
ning for such simplification.
The planning to
secure
the
greatest

162
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
degree of simplification should begin with the architects design and
extend throughout to the completion of the plumbing work.
It
is
not to be expected that the architect will plan the building around
the plumbing system.
It is not, however, too much to expect that
he should he familiar with the plumbing requirements of the place
for which the building is designed and that he should keep in mind
(1) that the plumbing is an integral part of the completed building,
and
(2) that the mere location of the position of the fixtures without
any consideration to the possible location of the stacks and branch
drains is not sufficient.
It is a fact, so evident as to be almost an axiom, that the shorter
and more direct the drainage pipes in a plumbing system are, con-
sistent with pneumatic effects produced, the more efficient the drain-
age
will be.
The most
direct system
of pipes
will be secured by
grouping the fixtures closely around the stack serving them.
In a
few cases the necessity of venting against pneumatic effects may be
accentuated by the close grouping, but this will be more than bal-
anced by a corresponding simplification of the vent system, by de-
crease
in length
of connecting vent
pipes,
etc.
These points
are
especially true of the small dwelling house, with only one bath, in
which
it
is possible by close grouping of the fixtures to install the
plumbing system with no venting except the soil stack and at the
same time secure more efficient and safer drainage of the fixtures than
if they were individually back vented.
The same principle applies
in a lessened degree to systems of two or more bathrooms and other
fixtures.
Minor considerations in the design of the building that will fre-
quently serve the above ends may be here pointed out.
Bathrooms
should be located,
if possible, so that the soil stacks may be placed
in or adjacent to the walls of
it.
The fixtures should be located in
the bathroom so as to reduce the length of wastes and branch vents,
when required, to a minimum.
Where such an arrangement is not
practical
or
desirable,
an arrangement should be made
that
will
permit the
installation
of
a simple system
of wastes and branch
vents within the limits of length governing such installations.
It is
hardly necessary to add that the paths of wastes and vents through
the walls or floors from the fixtures to the stacks must be kept in
mind in the location of the fixtures.
SEPARATE FLOOR LAYOUTS TESTED
With these points on efficiency of drainage and simplicity of con-
struction
in mind
several
different arrangements and methods
of
connecting wastes to the soil stack were installed in complete plumb-
ing test installations.
These are considered separately from the rest
of the installation for purposes
of illustration and
discussion, and

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
153
the advantage and defects of each design are pointed out.
The vent
lines shown in the sketches
are not
to be considered
as required,
since gate valves were installed in the lines to enable cutting out
portions of the vent line not needed and the form of connecting the
vents to main vents or stacks
is not always recommended as a de-
sirable
one.
The
point was
to determine when
individual vents
were and were not needed.
Specific data applicable to each sketch
will be found in connection with the tests on complete installations
in which the same design was used.
Figure 69 shows a design employed on the top floor in a one story
and basement
construction with
a water-closet and laundry
trays
installed in the basement.
It
is shown here,
as used, with double
branch fittings in the stack and waste lines, thus giving opportunity
to throw the same into a duplex system with two bathroom groups of
fixtures set back to back.
During the tests for a single system the
Y branches opposite the water-closet and bathtub were plugged and
a deep seal glass trap set in the fitting branch opposite the wash-
basin.
With all valves in the vent closed, the discharge of the wash-
basin and bathtub together almost completely siphoned the washbasin
trap.
With valves 3 and 4 only open there was no loss in either the
bath or basin traps by self-siphonage from the single or combined
discharge of the two.
With all valves in the vents closed, one of the

154
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
traps would practically lose its seal from the discharge of the water-
closet.
This is due to aspirating effect of the water-closet discharge
flowing past the waste opening into the stack.
With the vent valves
3 and 4 open no measurable loss of seal in either the basin or bath
trap was produced by any combination or order of discharge of the
three fixtures.
At times a very slight back pressure was observed in
the bath trap when the basin was discharged.
With the duplex installation
it was found necessary to vent each
pair of fixtures, the baths by the "common vent”
(ft); the basins by
the common
vent
(3),
the
water-closets
being
“ stack
vented.”
With a pair of fixtures thus placed back to back the valve in the
"common vent” for the pair closed the discharge of one of the pair
invariably pulled the seal from the other trap.
The effect was not

as great with the pair of bathtubs as with the pair of washbasins,
yet was sufficient to reduce the trap seal materially.
The plan of connecting the bath and basin common waste into a
fitting below the water-closet
fitting was
also
tested with
TJ-inch
waste from the bathtub with similar results.
These results, verified
by later pressure measurements in similar positions on a straight 3-
inch stack, indicate that the waste pipe connection to the stack was
made near the point of maximum aspirating effect of the water-closet
discharge.
One result is to require a larger vent to protect the traps
against the aspirating effect than would be required to protect against
self-siphonage
alone.
The employment
of
a
side
inlet
termed
a
u crowfoot”
fitting was suggested by the plumbing committee as a
practical means
of
protecting
fixture
traps
from
the
aspirating
effects produced by water-closets on the same
floor.
The “ crow-
foot” fitting is illustrated in Figure 70, showing elevation and plan
views of these fittings with side inlets at 45, 90, and 135° to the main
inlet branch.
The fitting may readily be made right and left for all

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
155
three types, as well as with two or more side inlets at different angles
if required.
The special advantages of the “crowfoot” fitting for small-house
construction will become evident from the applications made in the
tests.
Pressure measurements made in the complete plumbing test
installations and
in
straight 3-inch stacks
at points on the stack
above the inlet through which water was introduced into the stack
showed no measurable
effects when
the stack top was open.
At
the same level as the inflow only very slight suctions or back pressures
were produced.
The use
of the “crowfoot”
fitting affords almost
complete
protection from
aspirating
effects produced by
the
dis-
charge
of fixtures on the same
floor.
The “ crowfoot”
fitting,
as
described,
is not a patented
fitting.
Its use somewhat
simplifies
the venting necessary to protect from the aspirating effects of dis-
charges from higher floors.
Figure 71 shows an arrangement of fixtures similar to Figure 69
with a kitchen sink added.
This was tested as the highest floor on
the system.

156
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
With valves
(1)
and
(2)
closed
the arrangement
illustrated
in
Figure 71 showed no measurable loss of seal in any trap of the group
from aspirating effect, with fixtures discharged in any combination
and in any order when the group is the highest on the system.
There
was the usual loss of seal in the basin trap by siphonage when the
basin and bath were discharged together, and some loss in seal from
self-siphonage when
the
basin
discharged
alone.
There was
no
measurable
loss
of seal in any trap when valve
(1 ) was opened.
Therefore, to completely protect the traps of the group from all local
effects a small vent from the basin branch is necessary.
The same arrangement of fixtures
(fig. 71) was completely tested
as the first floor of a two story and basement structure with 10 feet
10 inches between first and second floors with the fixtures arranged
as shown in Figure 72 installed on the second floor.
The discharge
Fig. 72—Arrangement of stack vented bathroom group tested
from the water-closets was varied by adjustment of supply devices
up to a mean rate of discharge of 60 gallons per minute.
The tests
show that the venting with valves (1) and
(2) open (fig. 71) is suffi-
cient and needed to completely protect the bath, basin, and sink traps
in that particular layout' against the aspirating effects produced by
the combined discharge of a water-closet with paper and soil, a bath-
tub, a washbasin, and a kitchen sink from the floor above.
Repeated
tests with a heavy discharge from the second-floor fixtures in con-
junction with the discharge
of the washbasin on the
first floor in
various
orders of sequence
failed
to produce any measurable loss
of seal in the bath trap on the first floor.
Apparently the interval
between the closing of vent
(1 ) by the washbasin discharge and the
closing of the horizontal waste from the bath is too short to permit
the transmission of aspirating effects
to the bath
trap.
Once the
horizontal waste is filled the bath trap is completely protected from
aspirating effects.
With valve
(2) closed a complete loss of seal was
produced in the sink trap by a heavy combined discharge or by the
repeated
discharge
of
a
single water-closet from
the
floor above.

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
157
The protection
offered the water-closet trap by the venting with
valves
(1 ) and
(2) open is not complete.
A heavy discharge from
the second floor, in conjunction with either or both the washbasin
and bathtub on the
first
floor discharging, produced a measurable
loss of seal in the water-closet trap on the first floor.
A repeated
discharge of a water-closet with paper and soil, washbasin, bathtub
and kitchen sink from the top floor in conjunction with either or both
the basin and bathtub on the first floor left approximately 0.7 inch
seal in the closet trap on the first floor, starting with a normal full
seal of 4 inches in the water-closet trap.
A single discharge of the
same fixtures did not reduce the water-closet seal on the first floor
Fig. 73—Alternate arrangement of bathroom and kitchen-sink group tested
below 1 inch.
The conclusions to be drawn with reference to layout
(fig. 71) with a bathroom group, or bathroom group and kitchen sink,
on a floor above
are:
( 1 ) That each small waste connecting inde-
pendently into the stack must be vented;
{2) that considering the
slight probability of
all the fixtures of the group above discharging
at the same time as the basin or bathtub in the lower group, the
water-closet may be left without a separate vent with comparative
safety; and
(3) that with possible heavier discharges from above than
described the water-closet should be
separately vented.
Figure 73 represents a
plan,
of rearrangement
of the fixtures
of
the group
(fig. 71), interchanging the relative positions of the wash-

158
RECOMMENDED' PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
basin and bathtub.
It was tested in the same position on the 3-inch
stack and in the same manner as for layout
(fig. 71).
With valve (I)
only open Ho loss of seal in any trap of the group was produced by
any combination or order of discharge of the fixtures within the group
itself.
With valves
(1) and
(#) open and the discharge of a water-
closet, washbasin, bathtub, and kitchen sink from the floor above in
conjunction with the washbasin of the lower group the seal of the
bathtub trap was materially reduced, leaving in one instance only
0.2-inch seal
of a normal 2.0-inch
full
seal.
The conclusions
are:
(1) That for the highest group of fixtures on a stack a vent from the
basin waste is sufficient, and (2) that for a lower floor the vent require-
ments are the same as for the plan in Figure 71 with the addition
of a separate vent for the bathtub waste.
To eliminate the necessity of any except stack venting for a single-
floor group or the highest group of fixtures on the stack, the arrange-
ment of fixtures shown in Figure 74 was installed and tested.
With
this layout no measurable loss of seal was produced in any trap of
the group by any combination or order of discharge of the fixtures
of the group itself, or in conjunction with other fixtures lower on the
stack.
The combined discharge from a washbasin and kitchen sink
into a
3-inch stack
is not
sufficient
to produce
aspirating
effects
great enough to cause measurable loss of seal in traps whose unvented
wastes connect to the stack at points below.
The conclusion
is that within the limits of permitted length and
fall of unvented wastes
it
is unnecessary to individually vent any

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
159
fixture of a group installed on this plan
(fig. 74).
It will be observed
that with “crowfoot”
fittings a great variety of arrangement and
spacing of fixtures within the limits of permitted lengths and fall of
unvented wastes may be secured without in any way affecting the
general
results
indicated.
The
preceding layouts
of
construction
(figs.
69 and
74), though closely representing the
installations
as
tested, are not drawn to scale and are not to be considered as approved
in
detail.
A number
of
detailed drawings representing approved
application of the plans and principles involved are given later.
TESTS OF COMPLETE PLUMBING INSTALLATIONS
As has been previously indicated, the final test of any plumbing
design or detail of plan of construction must be its satisfactory opera-
tion in service.
While much of the preceding investigation has a
wider application, a full knowledge of the principles thus disclosed
are believed essential for an intelligent interpretation of test results
on small-house installations.
In order to hasten the work, the following tests of complete test
plumbing installations, covering one story, one story and basement,
and two story and basement dwellings were carried on parallel to
the general investigations
of
the hydraulics and pneumatics
of a
plumbing system.
The result has been that many tests were made
which might well have been omitted as having no direct bearing on
small-house plumbing.
In this report an attempt has been made to
condense into small space the results of elaborate tests on plumbing
installations by omitting
all data, except results of “critical tests”
and a few additional tests which serve to emphazise the principles
disclosed in the general investigations or stated in that connection
from theoretical considerations.
CRITICAL TESTS
The term “critical test” may be defined as any combination or se-
quence
of discharge
of fixtures on a given installation which may
occur frequently enough and which in conjunction with modifying
conditions may prove detrimental to the functioning of the plumbing
system.
It is evident that there may be many “critical tests” for
the same system and that in this connection the discharge of a single
fixture may be of more importance in some cases than the combined
discharge of several fixtures on the same system.
Almost any plumbing installation, either test or service, may be
shown good or bad according to the severity of the modifying con-
ditions imposed or assumed and according
to
the' severity
of the
test in the matter of combined discharge from fixtures to which it is
subjected.
Just what constitutes a fair test in the way of combined
discharge and severity of imposed modifying conditions and what is

160
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
a fair measure of satisfactory results must be decided as matters of
judgment.
Any decision reached by an individual or group of indi-
viduals readily lends itself to adverse criticism from unsympathetic
reviewers, who may be prejudiced by personal interest or a narrow
point of view.
For large installations the matter of coincxdent discharge consti-
tuting a maximum fair test might be determined from tables of prob-
able coincident discharge similar to Tables 2 and
3.
For small
in-
stallations
consisting
of two
or
three bathroom
units
and
other
small fixtures the arbitrary method of selection (Table 10) adopted
by the plumbing committee is believed more applicable for the types
of buildings under consideration.

TEST CONDITIONS
To illustrate the number of variations of modifying conditions to
be
considered
in connection with complete
tests and
to guide in
outlining and classifying tests, Table 11 was prepared by the plumbing
committee.
It is not to be understood that
all combinations given
were tested with each installation or that the table represents
all
possible combinations
of
conditions.
It
is
possible
to
strike out
many and reserve only certain ones which may be referred
to
as
critical test conditions, for example, the occurrence of a high wind,
frost closure, and a heavy rain at the same time is so unlikely that it
need not be considered.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
The manner of making tests and interpreting the results of tests is
another matter that is dependent on judgment.
Assuming that the
condition in which the trap seals are left by the test is the best criterion
for determining satisfactory and unsatisfactory results, and that a
minimum remaining seal representing satisfactory results has been
established,
the question
of repeating
tests without
restoring
the
trap seals to normal is still undecided.
It is evidently a fair test in
all respects to repeat the discharge of a single fixture on a system any
number of times without restoring the trap seals.
It is manifestly an
unfair test of normal service to repeat the coincident discharge of
several fixtures, of which the chance of coincidence is very remote,
without between tests restoring the trap seals to normal or to the
seal left by some less severe test that is likely to occur frequently in
ordinary service.
The preceding
points
in
reference
to
“ critical
tests,”
“ critical
conditions,” and manner of making the tests should
all be kept in
mind in the interpretation of results.
The validity of results obtained from clear water tests is frequently
questioned.
In
this connection we wish
to
point out
that
these
tests have not been
entirely clear-water
tests.
Many
tests were
made using
toilet paper and imitation
fecal matter,
hereafter
re-
ferred to as
“soil,” in the water-closet discharge.
With this type
of discharge from a single water-closet a marked, though somewhat
erratic,
effect was produced.
With the discharge
of two or more
water-closets with imitation
“soil”
in conjunction with other
fix-
tures on the system the added effect of “soil” became less marked
and was usually lost, evidently because in the latter case the imi-
tation
“soil”
is
at once separated and
carried forward
in
small
separate units by the increased volume
of discharge.
The use of
foul water in a clean system could not possibly materially change
the
results
of
clear-water
tests.
With
reference
to
the
effect
of
fouled waste pipes,
it should be remembered that, in general, the
first effect of such fouled waste pipes must necessarily be a decreased
rate
of discharge from the fixtures served by them and that the
general requirements for venting would not be materially changed
thereby.
It will be observed,
too, that most fixtures used in the
tests were adjusted to give higher rates of discharge than the rates
on
which minimum
requirements have
been
calculated.
A
test
that
holds under
these
rates would more
surely hold under
the
lower service rates of discharge.
The matter of the effect of fouled
waste pipes on self-siphonage has been discussed in an earlier part
of the report and should be treated as a separate consideration.
As has been before stated the data which follow are a small part
of the total obtained from plumbing-test installations.
An attempt
has been made
to arrange
the data given
into
a form rendering

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
163
interpretation more
easy.
From the nature of the case
it will be
observed
that
there
is a
different
“ critical
test”
for the highest
group, for the lowest group, and for a middle group of fixtures on
a system, and frequently a different “ critical test” for each fixture
within a group.
For these reasons the data have been arranged in
series and groups, a series, in general, being all the tests on an in-
stallation, and a group,
the
“ critical
tests/’
for each floor of the
installation.
The data given
are,
in general, for the test showing
the greatest effect when there was a choice between several
tests.
To the “ critical tests,” which are intended to cover normal, heavy
service conditions, other tests giving heavier discharges have been
added to test for possibilities of flooding or overflowing.
It is be-
lieved that the latter should not be considered in connection with
vent requirements but only in the connection stated.
NOTATION
The following notation will serve as a key to the illustrations of
test installations and tabulated data for tests on the same:
B denotes a bathtub
or bathtub trap; C denotes a water-closet
or water-closet
trap; L denotes a lavatory (washbasin)
or lavatory
trap; S denotes a kitchen
sink or kitchen-sink
trap; T denotes a
laundry tray or laundry-tray trap.
Subscripts are used with the above letters to designate the floor
on which the fixture was installed; thus C0 denotes a water-closet
in the basement, Ct a water-closet on the first floor, and C2 a water-
closet on the second
floor.
A prime denotes that the fixture was
installed on a waste stack; thus S'2
is a kitchen sink on the second
floor connected
to
a waste
stack.
Quotation marks
are used
to
denote a second
fixture
of the same kind on the same floor; thus
“ C0 ”
denotes
a
second
water-closet
on
the basement
floor.
R
denotes a trapped rain leader connected to the house drain at the
base of the stack, and with subscript the rate of rainfall used in the
test.
R' denotes a trapped rain leader connected to the house drain
on the sewer side, and with subscript the rate of rainfall used in the
test; thus in the tabulated data R\ denotes water introduced through
rain leader R'
at a rate equivalent to a rainfall of 4 inches per hour
over a drained
area
of
1,500
square
feet.
D denotes
submerged
outfall of house drain with subscript to denote extent of submergence
in inches.
F denotes partial
closure of stack tops simulating frost
closure with subscript
to
denote the diameter
of
free opening
in
inches.
W denotes a wind
current of 45 miles per hour over the
stack tops
directed
horizontally
unless
otherwise
stated.
Vv V2 ,
etc., denotes valves in vent lines numbered from left to right and
from the top floor down.
Gt , G2 ,
etc., denotes gate valves in hori-
zontal waste pipes or horizontal drains numbered from the highest

164

down and from right
to
left on each
floor.
“Soil” denotes
toilet
paper and
imitation
fecal matter added
to
the
water-closet
dis-
charges.
TEST INSTALLATION NO.
1
Experimental plumbing
installations with framework and
plat-
forms to carry the pipes and fixtures were installed in an 8 by 12 foot
elevator shaft.
The different installations are described in consid-
erable detail.
The
first installation for which data are recorded in
this report is shown in Figure 75.
The house sewer of 4-inch cast-
iron pipe was carried in line with the house drain, at a fall of one-
fourth inch to the foot, to a return bend
(fig.
76), 22 feet from the
base of the 3~inch soil stack and then back to the pit of the elevator
shaft with the same
fall
in
the
straight run, where
it discharged
through an open or submerged end
as the imposed conditions de-
manded.
The return bend in the house sewer, composed of two 4-
inch short sweep one-fourth bends, was set at an angle of 45°.
The
total developed length of house drain and house sewer was 38 feet.
The fittings taking the fixture discharge were double “sanitary tees”
of which one side was plugged flush with the inner wall of the fitting
when employed as a single house installation, with the exception of
the two deep seal glass traps shown.
These were also plugged in the
trap during tests in which the pressure changes were great enough to
break the trap seals.
The valves in the vent lines were of the cock-
valve type, giving cross-sectional openings equal in area to the pipes
in which they were installed.
The valves in the branch horizontals
of the house drain were gate valves.
The traps of the individually trapped fixtures were lj-inch lead
P traps with nominal 2-inch seals except the lavatory, which was a
li-inch cast brass trap with a nominal 2.5-inch seal.
The traps were
fitted with glass windows and scales
(fig. 77) to enable the reading of
the seal depth at any time.
Air-pressure measurements were made
at various
points
in
the
3-inch stack and in the vent lines during the tests.
These pressure
measurements have but little value in judging the defects or advan-
tages of a particular system, hence have been discussed elsewhere in
connection with the pneumatics of plumbing systems.
The data are to be considered typical of the type of tests made and
representative of maximum effects under the assumed “critical tests”
and “critical conditions” imposed.
Practically every group of tests,
as well as individual
tests, was repeated at least once.
Other tests
giving discharges near the assumed “ critical test” rate were made in
most cases.
Many slight modifications were made in the different
installations,
of which only
those showing
appreciable changes
in
results of tests are recorded in detail.

Note—The partial loss of seal in trap To in tests 3, 5, and 6 was evidently due to waving from back pres-
sure.
The term “blown” in column 5 indicates that water was thrown up into the closet bowl by back
pressure.
The term “steady” indicates a steady,
slight oscillation in the water-closet trap
Co.
In all
cases even when “blown” there was only a slight loss of seal in trap
Co.
Conclusions.— 1
. For
the
installation
as
represented
(fig.
75)
with separate sewer system a single loop vent from the washbasin
branch is required and is sufficient to prevent a material loss in any
trap
seal on
the system.
It should be noted, however,
that
the
horizontal branch from
the laundry tray and
water-closet
in
the
basement connect to the stack near the point of minimum pressure
variation, and that a connection either closer to or farther from the
house drain would be more in need of back venting.
Therefore, in
many cases a back vent from the lowest horizontal branch would
be necessary for complete protection of trap seals, preferably in this
case the vent represented by 7e from the water-closet O0 .
2. With a combined sewer system a vent line represented by line
when 7e , 71; 7S , and 74 are open
is required and
is
sufficient to
protect the trap seals.

168
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
3. The different waste and soil stacks of a system may be consid-
ered independently so far as vent requirements are concerned, pro-
vided the house drain and house sewer are sufficient in capacity for
the system.
Tests were made on the same system with the stack tops partially
closed to represent frost closure, with a wind current over the stack
tops, with a vented running trap in the house drain, and with a sub-
merged outfall of the house sewer.
The general effects of a running
trap
in
the house
drain have been
described
in
connection with
modifying conditions.
Data from later installations show the effects
to be expected from partial frost closure, wind, and submerged outfall
of house sewer to better advantage.
TEST INSTALLATION NO. 2
The installation
(fig. 78) was constructed by remodeling the 3-inch
stack and vent system of the first installation (fig. 75), the house drain,
house sewer, 2-inch waste stack, and rain leader systems being left
as before.
The water-closets were connected to “ crowfoot ” fittings
as shown, and small fixture waste lines were connected to side inlets
or to fittings above the water-closet branch fittings.
The waste and
vent
lines were reduced
to what was believed
to be the smallest
convenient serviceable size from
all considerations for general con-
struction in dwelling houses.
Flush valves were installed to supply
the water-closets and adjusted to give a mean rate of supply of approxi-
mately 60 gallons per minute for periods varying from 6 to 10 seconds.
Under
these
conditions
the maximum
rate
of discharge from
the
water-closet does not materially differ from the rate of supply
(see
curves of discharge and discussion in the
first part of the report).
The kind of supply
is not an essential factor in the test work, the
purpose of the high rates being to prove and emphasize the adequacy
of the pipe system as installed for the same fixtures with satisfactory
service rates of supply.
The strainers were removed from
all the
separately trapped smaller fixtures, hence the rates of discharge from
these were also slightly higher than those given in Table 4.

It
is apparently impossible
to
destroy permanently
the
seal
of
water-closet C1 by discharges from above, when the side inlet branch
waste
is vented.
With 10 feet or more of straight stack below the
water-closet
there
is
slight danger
of
it being
subjected
to back
pressure from the stack.
The only danger of air leakage through the
water-closet
is
therefore from complete
loss
of
the
trap
seal
by
evaporation.
It is necessary to back vent each small waste branch
connected independently to the stack on a middle floor.

Note.—The term “steady” means steady fluctuation in the trap
seal under back pressure.
“Blown”
means water thrown up from the closet bowl or out of the bowl by back pressure.
“ Bubble” or “bubbles ”
means a small quantity of air forced back through the trap by back pressure.
Evidently much of the trouble from back pressures in test groups
5 and 6 is directly due to insufficient capacity of the house drain and
house sewer.
The presence of the return bend in the house sewer
and
submerged
outfall
impose
rather
severe
conditions
and
the
volume of water discharged
is somewhat greater than the same
fix-
tures would give in ordinary service.
Attention has been called to the
fact that the water-closet discharge approached or exceeded 60 gallons
per minute.
The carrying capacity
of the 4-inch drain has been
estimated at 108 gallons per minute when laid with a grade
of one-
fourth inch per foot and flowing full under its own head.
The com-
bined rate of discharge for most of the tests exceeds this value; for
example, No.
1, group 6 gives a combined rate of discharge to the
house drain, including that from the rain leader, of nearly 200 gal-

172
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
Ions per minute.
In order
to show
the presence
of backwater in
the
stack
the
2-inch combination Y and $ bend branch A
in the
stack above the water-closet C0 was opened up, F3 closed, the water-
closet C0 stopped in the trap and the following discharged into the
stack and drain, BzLzCzSiT0RbDz giving a total estimated discharge
of 215 gallons per minute.
The water spurted from the branch of the
fitting to a distance of 3 or 4 feet, showing that the stack was flowing
under considerable head above that point.
Therefore, the tests of
group 6 mean but little in connection with vent requirements and
serve only to emphasize the need of an adequate house drain.
The
tests of group 6 do show the danger from back pressure when fixtures
are connected near the base of the
stack.
In order further to
test

Tests of groups 7 and 8 show that with fixtures connecting near
the base of the stack it is necessary to back vent each branch sepa-
rately, and that with inadequate house drain or submergence near
the base of the stack it is difficult if not impossible in extreme cases
to protect completely the trap seals of fixtures thus located.
TEST INSTALLATION NO.
3
The final tests on small-house plumbing systems were made on an
installation
(fig.
80), erected for the purpose of permitting anyone
interested in the work to witness or make any test
desired.
In a
measure
it embodies the better features of the earlier installations.
The system
as
displayed consisted
of
a two story and basement
structure with a bathroom group of fixtures on the upper or second
floor, a bathroom group on the first or middle floor, and two water-
closets on the basement or lower floor,
all connected to the 3-inch soil
stack, and in addition two batteries of two laundry trays each on the
basement floor and one kitchen sink on each of the first and second
floors connected to a 2-inch waste stack.
Gate valves were installed
in the vent lines so that the fixtures below the upper floor might be
back vented or not as desired.
Data for only a few representative “ critical tests” are given.
The
construction and tests for the upper floor were so nearly the same as
that in Figure 78 that no data are given.
It was impossible to re-
duce the seal of any trap on this floor materially by any combina-
tion or sequence of discharge of fixtures on the system.
Likewise,
it
is unnecessary to consider one stack in reference to the other for
floors above the basement.
Basement
floor fixtures on one stack
may be affected by discharge into the other stack.
The water-closets
in the system
(fig*
80) were installed with low-tank supply
giving
rates of discharge approaching that given in Table 4.
The strainers
were removed from the separately trapped fixtures, hence the rates
of discharge were slightly higher than given for the same fixtures in
Table 4.

he blowing of the seals of the laundry-tray traps in test No. 3 was evidently due in part to
overcharging of the horizontal drain from the 2-inch stack.
There was only slight permanent loss of seal
in either laundry tray or water-closet traps in any of the tests of groups even when the seals were “blown"
by back pressure.
The
tests
of the installations represented by Figures 75 and 78
showed the deterimental effect to be expected in a combined sewer
system when the house drain is insufficient in capacity to carry both
the storm water and discharge from the stacks.
To test the effects
with an adequate house drain, the 5-inch house drain and house sewer
represented at the bottom of Figure 80 were connected in place of
the 4-inch drains shown connected in the drawing.
The rain leader
was 3-inch diameter, 22 feet long, with box arranged at the top as
before described.
The tests on the upper floors did not differ in results from those
with 4-inch
drains and separate sewer system, hence no data for
these are reported.

Note—Test No. 5 was made merely to determine whether or not the system would drain with the total
possible discharge from the fixtures in combination with storm water.
The dashes (-) inserted with fix-
tures discharged indicates an interval of time between starting discharges on the different floors in order
to obtain a greater volume rate of discharge into the house drain.
There was a poor flush in the basement
water-closets in No. 5, the water rising in the bowls to about 1 inch of the top then flowing out as the water
receded from the house drain.
The test is abnormal, and, as stated, shows only the degree of safety against
flooding or overflowing during any normal heavy use.
The total rate of discharge into the house drain
was slightly in excess of 300 gallons per minute.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
The results of the preceding tests in connection with other experi-
ments justify a number of general conclusions which may safely be
applied to
all dwelling-house plumbing, namely:
1. The 3-inch stack
is adequate for
all separate dwelling house
plumbing.
2.
It
is possible by close grouping of the fixtures around the soil
stack to obtain safe and
efficient drainage for a single floor and for
the highest floor of a more complex system without back venting
any of the fixtures.
3.
It is necessary to back vent individually or in groups all small
branch waste lines connecting directly into the stack below a water-
closet on the same stack to protect fully the seals of traps on such
branches.
4. A back-vented side-inlet branch to a “crowfoot”
fitting on a
middle floor offers a degree of protection that makes
it unnecessary
to back vent
the
water-closet
individually,
provided the
possible
discharge does not exceed that from one bathroom group
plus
a
kitchen sink or 10 J fixture units.
5. In cases where the possible discharge from floors above exceeds
10^ fixture units it
is necessary to back vent each separate branch
individually, including water-closet branches, on a middle floor.
6.
It
is necessary to back vent each separate branch connection
individually on the lower floor including water-closet branches, un-
less there is 3 feet or more of straight stack below the fittings taking
such branches,
in whicji case the rules for a middle floor may be
applied with safety.
7. In
a combined sewer system
it
is necessary
to make
ample
provision in the size
of house drain and
house
sewer in
order to
protect fixtures set low on the stack, even when such
fixtures
are
individually back vented.
The above conclusions are based on the assumption of the use of
plain traps and with the
realization that
in practice considerable
departure from any fixed conditions assumed for test purposes may

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
177
occur.
The conclusions embodied in the recommended desings are
of construction which follow, Figures 81 to 89.

The layouts were originally prepared
by the plumbing committee, but have been modified and elaborated
with their full approval to bring out certain features in venting and
to illustrate possible variations that may be made by use of properly

tions that may be made with the more elaborate systems composed

to be sufficient to indicate other variations that might be made to
meet different structural conditions encountered without in any way
changing the general results or in any way lessening the efficiency of
the system.

location)
We have pointed out that the most efficient drainage will be secured
with the most direct wastes consistent with the general requirements
to protect the trap seals.
It follows that an individual vent installed
where one is not needed is not only an added expense but may prove
a detriment by reducing the velocity of flow and consequently the
scour in the waste or soil pipe thus vented.
For these reasons we
have given preference
to the plan involving the simplest venting.
This, in general, involves a close grouping of fixtures about the stack,
assuming that the stack will be located so as to make possible such

PHYSICS OF PLUMBING SYSTEMS
179
grouping within the limits
of allowable length of unvented wastes.
It is recognized that such grouping and arrangement will not always
be possible, and alternate plans in the order of preference are given
for
each
type
of
building
represented.
The
types
go from
the
simplest to the more complex, and, in general, a plan for one type will
serve equally well in the same position in a simpler type of building.
It will be observed that the plans
(figs. 81 to 89) in connection with
Figures 90 to 92 graphically represent a summary of conclusions in
so
far
as
they apply
to
small
dwelling-house
construction.
The
maximum developed length of all horizontal unvented waste branches
is limited to 5 feet with slopes of one-fourth to one-half inch per foot.
In general, the drawings are shown for wrought-iron construction in
waste and vent pipes.
Any approved material may be used within
the same limits.
For the most part dimensions are omitted from the
drawings, since the same construction applies to any sized soil stack
and required vent and waste pipes.
Design A
(fig. 81)
is suitable for the highest group of fixtures on
the soil stack.
A kitchen sink, with an independent waste branch

180
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
connecting to the stack above the water-closet branch, may be added
to
the group without other change.
It will be observed that the
design offers great flexibility in the matter of spacing and order of
arrangement of fixtures by the selection of the proper
“ crowfoot ”
fitting,
the
principal restriction being
the
limitation
of unvented
horizontal
waste branches
to
a maximum developed length
of
5
feet.
Still greater flexibility may be secured by a proper location of
the stack relative to the desired fixture positions.

These are not adapted to as many variations in order of arrangement
as design A, but permit some which can not be secured in design A,
such as the location of the lavatory on the opposite side of the bath-
room from the soil stack.
A kitchen sink may be added to the group
with the same restrictions as before.
Design B will also serve with
comparative safety on a lower floor when the possible discharge from
above does not exceed one bathroom group plus a kitchen sink or
10J fixture units.
Design E (fig. 85) may be used on a lower floor
under the same conditions.

Figures 90 to 92 represent types for small dwellings which we believe
to be sufficiently varied to illustrate all types within the scope of the
present
report.
Many
variations
of
each
type
might
be made
without in any way changing the principles or the requirements.
In
general, a fixture or a group of fixtures may be omitted from a lower
floor of any type without changing the requirements in venting for
other fixtures on the same floor or floors above.
Types 1 and 3 may use any one of the designs A to E with varia-
tions within the limits prescribed elsewhere for installing the fixtures.

183
Types 2 and 4 may use any one of the same designs for the upper
floor, with the basement fixtures vented as indicated in any of the
approved methods of venting for the position.
Types 5 and 6 may use on the second floor any of the approved
designs for the highest floor of a system and designs B, E, or F, with
the sink or combination fixture vented in approved manner as indi-
cated,
and

Types 7 and 8 may use design G
(fig. 86) or any equivalent varia-
tion for the upper floor within prescribed limits of permitted lengths
and design H

with the basement water-closet type 8 vented in an approved manner.
Types

12, two story and two story and basement

Types 9 and 10 may use any of designs B, E, or F on the first floor
with the sink or combination fixture vented in an approved manner
as indicated.
Types 11 and 12 may use any designs B, E, or F on the first floor for
the main stack, with fixtures on the waste stack vented in an approved
manner.
It
is impossible to describe or illustrate
all possible variations in
design in which the same general characteristics can be maintained.
The preceding construction has been described in considerable detail
to
illustrate
the
flexibility
of
the
designs given
to meet
different
conditions.
It has been previously pointed out that there
is con-
siderable flexibility in the designs themselves.
Figures 81 to 89 are
limited always by the permitted lengths of wastes and by venting
requirements for the position in which the layout
is to be his tailed.

Preference has been given in all illustrations to the simplest form
of venting that we believe will be safe for general application because

The experiments so far indicate that this would
not be true and that, in general, where vents are required for a 3-inch
stack they would also be required for a 4-inch stack.
Theory indi-
cates that in many cases larger vents would be required for a 4-inch
than for a 3-inch stack with the same fixtures installed on both.

CHAPTER 7.—SIZES OF SOIL, WASTE, AND VENT PIPES IN
PLUMBING SYSTEMS
By R. B. Hunter
Bureau of Standards
(Supplementary paper prepared for the consideration of the committee,
1928)
INTRODUCTION
In the paper on the “ physics of plumbing systems/’ published in
the final report of the subcommittee on plumbing/ certain tables were
included as applicable to large plumbing systems.
With reference to
these tables on which the tables of the Recommended Plumbing Code
were largely based, further study and experimentation have led to the
conclusion on the part of the writer that if safe and serviceable, and
at
the same
time
the most
economical,
construction were
to
be
obtained with various sizes of soil and vent pipes, it would be neces-
sary
to
differentiate in requirements regarding both
the height
of
the structure and the type of inlet fitting (sanitary T or 45° Y) used
in the construction.
While attention was called to the effect of these
differences in construction on the capacity of soil and waste stacks,
no differentiation in these respects was made in the tables referred to.
It is the purpose of this paper, taking into account these differences,
to develop tables and charts applying to
all plumbing construction,
for the consideration of the committee in a contemplated revision of
the Recommended Plumbing Code.
It will be understood that only
approximations are possible in tables for general application,
since
the demands on plumbing systems even of the same size and general
layout
differ greatly because
the land and distribution
of fixtures
and the occupancy and use of the buildings
differ in the different
systems.
An exact list of the requirements in pipe sizes for any one
system can only approximately meet the demands of many others of
the same size and type.
CARRYING CAPACITIES OF VERTICAL CAST-IRON PIPES
Experiments reported in the former paper, pages 101-109, showed
that water introduced into a 3-inch
cast-iron stack through a 45°
3-inch inlet at the volume rate of 200 gallons per minute attained a
velocity of 32.8 feet per second in a fall of 45 feet.
The velocity-height
curve obtained indicates
that, given
sufficient height, a maximum
velocity of about 34 feet per second would be attained in a pipe of
this size with this volume rate of flow.

States Department of Commerce, Elimination of Waste Series, 1924.

The experiment referred to verified the assumption that, for water
flowing in a vertical pipe without external head, the
frictional re-
sistance
(.F) varies as the square of the velocity
( V); that is, F=KV2
.
The hydraulic formula,
,
jLV 2
T/r
fV

h=W>’ 0Th,L=kD
(1)
applies to a sloping pipe without external head and expresses the same
relation, since
for maximum velocity under
this condition
(Ji)
is a
measure of the frictional resistance and
is a constant.
In a full
vertical pipe the hydraulic gradient h/L becomes unity, and we may
write the equation
for that condition
as
jV2
,
2jD = l01 v= '2jny>
(2 )
It
is known that the
frictional constant (/)
decreases both with
increase in diameter
of pipe and increase in
velocity, and
for the
present it will be treated as a variable.
From equation (2) we may obtain,
expressing the relation between the maximum velocities, V and Vh
obtained in full pipes of diameters, D and Zh, with frictional constants
/ and/i, respectively.
The carrying capacity (C) varies as V D

For maximum
velocity,
the
frictional resistance must equal
the
force acting in the direction of flow, and
in equation
(1)
is a
measure of frictional resistance per unit length of pipe.
Since in a
partially filled vertical pipe (mg) is the force, we may replace
by
(mgc).
This leads to the following relation between maximum veloci-
ties and masses of water per unit length of pipe.

Treating
(/) as a constant in equations
(5) and
(6) gives,
C'.C^DK.DK
(7)
an approximate relation for maximum carrying capacities of vertical
pipes of different diameters when flowing full, and
V:Vt =
(8)
an approximate relation of maximum attainable velocities in the same
pipe filled to different degrees.
In the following table, obtained from the data for a 3-inch vertical
pipe with 200 gallons per minute flowing in the pipe, by applying
equations
(7) and
(8), the carrying capacities given are lower than
actually obtainable for the conditions stated.
This follows from the
fact that we have started with the lowest (m) in equation (8) and with
the smallest diameter in equation
(7) and have treated (/) as a con-
stant whereas
it actually decreases
as the diameters and
velocities
increase.

The carrying
capacities for pipes flowing
full are predicated on
conditions as regards number and distribution of inlets and as regards
volume rates of inflow at the different inlets such as to just keep the
pipe full as the velocity increases.
Since in plumbing systems inlets
are usually spaced a story height apart and the volume rates of inflow
at different inlets may vary from zero up to the peak load from the
branch drain or drains on one floor, the maximum carrying capacities
flowing full are evidently not safe values on which to base the maxi-
mum permissible number of fixtures unless a substantial factor of
safety is employed.
They do, however, aid in interpolating for safe
values and in introducing a reasonable factor of safety.
The table for stack capacities in the
earlier paper, page 103
of
the final report, though not so stated at the time, gives in reality the
fitting capacity or the stack capacity with inlets at one approximate
level.

ESTIMATED PEAK LOADS IN PLUMBING STACKS
An estimated peak load is an essential factor in fixing upper limits
of
service for any plumbing stack in terms
of fixture units.
The
principle of probabilities as a means for making such estimates was
given in the former paper and
its application described.
It
is ob-
viously useless to attempt to make these estimates with any great
degree of accuracy, because of the variation in the kind and distri-
bution of the fixtures
as well as the variation in the frequency of
use in different plumbing systems.
A peak load curve drawn from
points calculated by the method
of probabilities from assumed or
predetermined factors does show the manner of the variation of the
peak load with the total number of fixtures, and
if the factors are
carefully chosen, estimates may be safely made from such a curve.
No claim is made further than that, with the frequency of use allowed
for, the peak load given by the curve for any number
of
fixture
units
will probably not be reached oftener than once in the time
stated—10 years in the curve shown in Figure 93.
It
is simply a
device by which we may make systematic estimates, with reasonable
assurance that the factors of safety introduced
will amply take care
of any excess above the estimated peak loads chus made.
Without going again
into
the
details
of the
calculations, which
were fully explained in the former paper, curve
1, Figure 93, shows
the peak discharge that will probably occur on the average of once in
10 years, with an average use of fixtures of once each in five minutes
for three hours daily.
These estimates are based on a peak discharge
of 45 gallons per minute for each water-closet, an average duration of
10 seconds per flush per water-closet, and an allowance for all over-
lapping of flushes of 6 seconds or more as giving a peak load equal to
the sum of the overlapping peak discharges of the water-closets.
The
curve
is based entirely on a system of water-closets, but
it may be
shown that in
a mixed system of water-closets and
other
fixtures

192
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
having the same number of fixture units the peak discharge will not
be greater.
Below curve
1, curve 2 shows the average or mean flow based on
the same frequency
of use and allowing an average discharge of 5
gallons per water-closet per
flush.
It is evident that with only a few fixtures on the system the flow in
the drains will be intermittent, but that as the number increases a
point will be reached where with the same frequency of use the flow
will be continuous but not regular.
It is also evident that when the
peak discharges do occur they will occur during periods of heaviest
use, and the peak discharges will be added to the flow already in the
drain and,
therefore, the peak load may approach the sum of
the
continuous flow and peak discharge.
Curve 3, which is proposed for
estimating peak loads, is obtained by adding the ordinates of curve
1
to those of curve 2.
Using this curve, the estimated peak loads, up
to about 12 fixture units, is the sum of the individual peak discharges
from
all fixtures on the system, or 100 per cent of the total possible
discharge.
As the number of fixtures on a system increases the esti-
mated peak load as a percentage of the total gradually decreases in
accordance with the law of probability until for 5,400 fixture units
it is less than 8 per cent of the total.
There is another condition in practice partially controlling possible
peak loads and which
operates
as
an
additional
factor
of
safety.
The water-suppty lines should be, and generally are, proportioned to

SIZES OF
SOIL, WASTE, AND YENT PIPES

supply water at a normal rate to a fraction of the fixtures only.
With
flush-valve supply this limits the possible discharge to the capacity of
the water-supply system.
There seems to be no reason why the house
drainage pipes and house water-supply pipes should not be based on
the same estimated peak
loads.
With tank supply
to
the water-
closets and with plug outlet fixtures, the connection between supply
and drainage is not so close as with flush-valve supply, but there is a
limit to the rate
at which the tanks or the fixtures will
refill
after
flushing, which also places a comparable limit on the possible peak
load.
The same peak-load curve could be used with
fairly satisfactory
results for determining the required sizes of horizontal branches, house
drains, and house sewers, but since the holding or storage capacity,
as well as the run-off during the discharge, is a factor, it seems more
logical to base the sizes of these on a maximum mean rate of flow.
This has been done, as described later in the paper.
PERMISSIBLE NUMBER OF FIXTURES ON SOIL AND WASTE STACKS
Table 12 gives approximations for the maximum carrying capacities
of
stacks
under
gravity
flow.
While
these
are
admittedly
only
approximations, they indicate that a vertical pipe of sufficient height
in which to attain maximum velocity has from thirty-five to forty
times the carrying capacity of the same pipe laid with a fall of one-
eighth inch per foot and from fifteen to eighteen times that of the
same pipe laid with one-half inch fall per foot.
It seems illogical and
unreasonable to permit the use of sloping pipes in plumbing systems
to almost
full capacity and not permit something approaching the
same
relative use
of
vertical-pipe
capacities.
It
is
true
that
the
controlling of air pressures
is a greater problem in vertical than in
horizontal or sloping pipes, because of the greater velocities of flow
attained in the former.
The proposal made here to base estimates
for
the maximum
use
of stacks on
their
capacities when flowing
one-third
full and on peak loads,
as given by curve
3, Figure
93,
makes ample allowance for the separation and circulation of air.
All
available data on the subject indicate that this proposal gives a low
estimate on actual capacities of the stacks under service conditions.
Likewise
all
available data indicate
that peak loads estimated by
Figure 93 are greater than actually occur in plumbing systems.
To-
gether they form a large factor of safety.
The proposal is a step in
the right direction at least and provides a table in advance of any-
thing that has been offered up to* this time.
With this advance, however, it will be necessary to impose certain
restrictions regarding the distribution of fixtures and regarding the
use of “ sanitary T” fittings in order to prevent local overloading of the
stack.
This may be done either by limiting the number of branches
in a given height of stack, or by limiting the number of fixtures on
20141°—29

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
all
branches
to
a stack
in
a given
height.
The
latter serves
the
purpose and is more flexible, as it imposes no direct restriction on the
size or number of branches to the stack and is therefore the method
chosen in building the table.
It has been found that a stack
will take the capacity discharge
from two
horizontal branches
of
the same diameter
as
the
stack
through
a
double
45°
fitting.
We
will
introduce
here
the
term
“branch interval” and define
it as any section of the stack, at least
8 feet in length, within which one or more branches are connected.
In the proposed table, with all inlets 45°, the total number of fixtures
on
all branches connected within any 8-foot section of the stack will
not exceed two and one-half times the permissible number on one
branch of the same diameter as the stack and with a fall of one-fourth
inch per foot.
A comparable limit when any “sanitary T” fittings
are used in the stack is one and one-half times the number permitted
on one branch with a fall of one-fourth inch per foot.
Two “branch
intervals,” not less than 16 feet of stack, permits double the number
of fixture units on the stack, provided not more than one-half are on
branches
connected
to
the
stack
within
any
8-foot
section.
For
three or more “branch intervals” the total on one stack will be
dis-
tributed so that the restriction as to the “branch interval” or length
of stack is not violated.

SIZES OF HORIZONTAL DRAINS
As previously stated,
the
tables for
required
sizes
of
horizontal
branches, house
drains, and house sewers
are
to be based mainly
on an
estimated maximum mean
rate
of
flow
or
discharge,
with
certain modifications to be described, and not on a temporary peak
discharge
produced by
the
coincident
discharge
of
fixtures.
The
reasons
for
this
are: That
the individual peaks
are wiped out by
overlapping when we approach
the capacity
of the drain and
are
further smoothed out by the flow in the drain
itself; and
also that
the temporary peaks do not have an effect on venting requirements
for horizontal branches comparable to the effect of a corresponding

SIZES OE SOIL, WASTE, AND VENT PIPES
195
peak in
a
partially
filled vertical stack.
There
are, however, two
factors that come into play when we approach the maximum capacity
of a horizontal drain.
One is the holding or storage capacity of the
drain in its relation to peaks of short duration, which in the case of
short drains of small diameter is the dominating factor; the other is
the effect of head above the drain on its limiting or maximum capacity.
The storage capacity of a drain increases with increased diameter
in two respects—the increased capacity per unit length and the in-
creased length of drain necessary
to accomodate
fixtures
sufficient
to give a capacity load in the larger drain.
Evidently the condition
in which the temporary peak has the greatest opportunity to over-
charge the drain is in the drain of comparatively small diameter to
which
water-closets
are
connected
directly.
Evidently,
too,
the
maximum congestion and, therefore, the worst condition to contend
with in
this respect
is produced by
a double row
of water-closets
connected to the drain by means of double fittings.
If we estimate
the required
size of branches to take care of this condition,
it will
be
ample
for
all
other
conditions,
including
unobstructed
house
drains and house sewers.
Observations
on
toilet
rooms,
in
public
schools
in
Cleveland,
Ohio, indicate that, with full occupancy in girls’
toilets, the average
time of occupancy per person may be as low as one minute.
There
is no record of a lower average period of occupancy.
In boys’ toilets,
where separate urinals are installed, the average period of occupancy
for water-closets
is much greater.
Observations in
office buildings
and large industrial plants (see data on p. 95) show average occupan-
cies varying from 3.97 minutes per person for females to 7.1 minutes
per person for males.
It would seem reasonable and wholly
safe,
therefore, to estimate peak loads on frequencies of use varying from
once a minute for diameters in which the storage capacity is a limiting
factor and in which congestion is likely to occur to once in two minutes
for a 12-inch drain in which the run-off is the controlling factor and
in which congestion is improbable.
From
these data and assumptions
the following
tentative
table
for drains with a fall of one-fourth inch per foot is computed on the
basis of each water-closet discharging 5 gallons once a minute.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
An examination of this table in connection with experimental data
indicates that for the 3-inch drain the estimate is high.
The assump-
tion that an allowance for an average flushing rate of once in two
minutes is ample for a 12-inch drain indicates that for the larger sizes
the estimates are low.
It is proposed to correct these estimates by
grading between the
test value for a 3-inch drain and an assumed
permissible rate of flushing for a 12-inch drain.
Three water-closets
closely spaced on a 3-inch horizontal drain with one-fourth inch fall
per foot have been shown by test at the Bureau of Standards to operate
successfully.
That this is the approximate limit is shown by a slug-
gish flush when an additional laundry tray
is added to the branch.
Comparing the test value with the tentative estimate indicates that
the estimate for the 3-inch drain should be reduced to about 0.3
of
its value to be certain of taking care of all conditions.
At the other extreme a flushing rate of once in two minutes would
permit the tentative estimate for a 12-inch drain to be increased to
twice its value.
It is evident that the reduction in the tentative esti-
mate for the 3-inch drain is necessary because of the limited storage
capacity.
It is also evident that the increase in the tentative estimate
for a 12-inch drain is permissible, not only because of increased storage
capacity but
also because of the decreasing chance of a proportional
number of the fixtures being flushed at the same time and the practical
certainty that the high assumed average rate of flushing of once a
minute per water-closet can not be maintained in
a system
large
enough
to require a 12-inch drain.
The
8 and
10 inch drains
are
almost on the same basis as the 12-inch drains in that
it
is almost
entirely
a question
of the
run-off and
the mean rate
of discharge
during a period of full occupancy.
Balancing all the factors—storage
capacity,
run-off,
probability
of coincident
discharge, and
possible
frequency of use—the following modifying factors
are proposed
to
give safe and comparable estimates for the different diameters:
0.3
for 3-inch, 0.75 for 4-inch, 0.9 for 5-inch, 1.2 for 6-inch, 1.85 for 8-inch,
1.9 for 10-inch, and 2.0 for 12-inch drains.
These factors applied to
the tentative estimates of Table A give what is believed to be a logical
and safe gradation for the different sizes as shown in Table B.

A column giving the capacities of the drains in a 10-second inter-
val, which is, in fact, the capacity for coincident
discharge in run-off
alone, and one giving the capacity for coincident discharge, including
storage in the minimum length necessary to accommodate the num-
ber of water-closets, have been included in Table B.
The percent-
ages show a regular gradation except for the 3-inch diameter.
As
previously stated, the higher factor of safety is necessary because of
limited storage and greater possibility of congestion.
It should be
noted that, except for the 3-inch drain, there is an increasing factor
of safety given by the storage capacity
as indicated
by
the
last
percentage column.
If the estimates of tentative Table B are accepted for drains with
a fall of one-fourth inch per foot, the second factor, effect of added
head, should be considered in connection with other slopes.
It is a
fact that a small head may develop above the sloping drain without
interfering with the operation of the fixtures.
While such a head is
in general not desirable, it is a fact also that the limiting or maximum
capacity of a drain is determined by the head that may develop with-
out interfering with the operation of the fixtures.
The experimental
determination for the 3-inch drain on which the estimates for the
smaller sizes were based evidently involved a slight head above the
sloping drain.
It
will
require
the same length
of 3-inch pipe
to accommodate
three water-closets whether the slope
is y inch, % inch,
or y inch
fall per
foot.
The
run-off, by D’Arcy’s formula,
will vary
as the
square
roots
of the
total
heads.
The
actual heads
for maximum
capacity
will vary as ^ + a> .A + a, and i + a , where L is the length
in feet and a the added head in inches, and not as the slopes %,
y,
and y.
It is impossible to make a definite calculation of this effect
except for special cases.
Estimates for a 3-mch pipe with the close
connection in question indicate that the maximum or limiting carry-
ing
capacities vary approximately
as 5:6:7
for
y,
y, and y inch
falls, respectively, instead of 36:51:80 as given by D’Arcy’s formula.
Similarly, ratios of 4:5:6 for 4-inch, 3:4:5 for 5-inch, and 2:3:4 for
6-inch
drains
are indicated
for
the minimum length necessary
to
accommodate the permissible number
of
fixtures.
For 8-inch and
larger diameters, because of the length required to accommodate the
number of fixtures necessary to give the estimated peak load, the
possible added head becomes negligible compared to the head in the
sloping drain, and D’Arcy’s formula, may be applied directly for
all
slopes.
These indicated ratios are of course not exact, but their applica-
tion to the estimates for a slope of y inch fall per foot in estimating

198
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
for y2 inch
fall per foot gives an added factor of safety and comes
nearer to the actual capacities for both the y8 and y2 inch
fall than
a
direct
application
of
the formula.
Therefore,
these
ratios have
been applied in forming the following complete table:

SIZES OF VENT PIPES
The proper proportioning of vent-pipe sizes to soil and waste pipe
sizes is important in securing economy in construction, together with
the proper functioning of a plumbing system.
The subcommittee on plumbing suggested, and used in examining
the data submitted to them, the assumption that a system in which
the peak load did not reduce the seal in any trap having a full seal
depth of 2 inches to less than 1 inch was satisfactory.
This is equiva-
lent to a requirement that the pressure variation in the system shall
not exceed ± 2-inch water column and
is probably a fair criterion by
which to judge test results for a particular system.
When the re-
sults are to be used in calculations, a factor of safety should be intro-
duced to allow for variations from the conditions of the test or experi-
mental results.
The following calculations are based on a permis-
sible variation
of
pressure
in
branches
of ± 1-inch water column
which in a 2-inch trap would leave 1%-inch seal under suction and
approximately a
full seal under back pressure and hence gives the
suggested factor of safety.
In our experiments (see p. 118) we showed that a reduction in pres-
sure of approximately 1-inch water column was produced in a 3-inch
branch from a 3 -inch stack in which water was flowing at the volume
rate of 200 gallons per minute (26.7 fixture units) when the branch
was vented by a
2-inch pipe 36
feet
long,
equivalent
in venting
capacity to a 3-inch pipe 312 feet long.
Also, with a flow of 100
gallons per minute
(13.3 fixture units), a 1%-inch
pipe 23 feet long
held the pressure variation to about the same value.
This length of
1^-inch pipe is equivalent to about 825 feet of 3-inch pipe.
It was observed
that
the
discharge from one
water-closet
(six
fixture units) produced about the same pressure variation in the branch
with no vent except the open upper end of the soil stack ; that is, an
infinite length of vent pipe to the branch will serve in this case.
At the

SIZES OF
SOIL, WASTE, AHD VENT PIPES
199
other extreme, the maximum discharge
at maximum
velocity
will
evidently produce the greatest demand on the vent; that
is, some
short length of 3 -inch vent pipe
(b) will be required to hold the pres-
sure variation within the prescribed
limits when the peak load
is
flowing.
These data suggest a curve of the form (y — a) (x — b) = c as express-
ing the relation, in which y is volume rate of flow in fixture units and x
the required length of vent and a,
6, and c constants.
The curve is
asymptotic to the lines y = a and x = b.
As we have two points on the
curve for a 3-inch soil stack, y = 13.3, £ = 825, and y = 26.7; £ = 312,
from these two points and the value of one constant a = 6we may de-
termine
the value
of
the constants
b and
c,
giving
the equation
(y — 6)
(£ — 33) = 5,780, expressing the relation between volume rate
of flow in a 3-inch soil stack and length of 3-inch vent required to hold
the pressure variation in a branch to ± 1-inch water column.
This
relation may be regarded as fairly accurate for the one combination for
which we have data.
In order to obtain a similar relation for com-
binations of other sizes of soil stacks and vents, it is necessary in the
absence of data for these to make certain assumptions:
1
.
Since the flow in partially filled vertical pipes has been observed
to be mainly on the walls of the pipe and since in this discussion we
are considering only cast-iron soil pipes, it appears to be a reasonable
assumption that approximately the same maximum velocities will be
obtained in different pipes when the volume rates
of flow are pro-
portional
to
the
wetted
perimeters;
that
is,
proportional
to
the
diameters of the pipes.
2.
Since the difference between the pressure in the stack and atmos-
pheric pressure
is evidently a function of the velocity and depth of
the stream of water on the wall of the pipe, we may assume that the
difference in pressure will be approximately the same when the volume
rates of water are proportional to the diameters, for by assumption
(1) the velocities are the same and for thin streams the depth on the
walls
will be approximately the same when the volume
rates
are
proportional to the diameters.
3. Since holding the difference in pressure in a branch to a given
value is evidently a question of the vent being of the size and length
necessary to change the air in the branch, under the pressure difference
created, at the rate it is taken from or driven into it by the action in
the stack, and since at times the entire air volume in the stack may be
carried or driven forward with a velocity equal to but not greater
than the velocity of the stream of water in the stack, we may assume that
with equal velocities of the water streams the maximum demands on
the vents will be proportional to the cross sections of the stacks; that
is, proportional to the squares of their diameters.

200
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
4.
If we define the venting capacity of a pipe as the volume rate
at which it will deliver air under a given difference in pressure between
the ends,
it follows that two pipes that will deliver the same volumes
of air under the same difference in pressure are equal in venting capac-
ity for that difference in pressure.
The laws of air flow in pipes under pressure in connection with the
preceding assumptions
lead
to
the
following equations
expressing
the relation between volume rate of flow in soil stack and length of
vent of the same diameter required to hold the pressure variation in
branches
to ± 1-inch water column, the curves of which are shown
in Figure 94 without further details regarding the computations:
3-
inch vent with 3-inch soil stack (y—
6) (x— 33)=
5,780.
4-
inch vent with 4-inch soil stack (y—
8) (x— 27) = 11,400.
5-
inch vent with 5-inch soil stack (y— 10) (x— 20) =20,280.
6-
inch vent with 6-inch soil stack (y— 12) (x— 16) =31,240.
8-inch vent with 8-inch soil stack (y— 16) (x— 12) =81,040.
Pig. 94.—Relation between soil and vent stack
These equations are based on meager experimental data and on
assumptions, hence are offered as rough approximations only.
How-
ever, in the curves obtained the factors, volume rate of flow and length
of vent, evidently vary with each other in the right order, and
it is
doubtful whether more accurate determinations for specific layouts
would be more
serviceable
in
general
application
for the purpose
intended, which is to give systematic approximations for upper limits
of service.
However exact the experimental data obtained for a few
specific layouts may be, the extension of these data to tables or charts
for general application must of necessity result in very rough approxi-

SIZES OF
SOIL, WASTE, AND VENT PIPES
201
mations for the reason that one or more of the conditions assumed in
obtaining the data will be at variance with those existing in almost
every practical case.
The criterion by which their usefuless in practice
is judged [should
be whether or not
their application results in imposing reasonable
and safe limits in the use of vents of different sizes.
Limits for maximum heights of soil stacks were recommended by
the subcommittee on plumbing on the assumption
that
a
certain
amount of sewer ventilation through the stack is necessary.
There
seems to be no Way of determining just how much
is necessary for
this or whether it is necessary to set a limit in maximum height at all.
The limits were set in the first recommended code on the basis of a
permissible height of 150 feet for a
3-inch
soil
stack.
In this con-
nection we wish to point out that two stacks, a vent and soil stack,
will generally be required before this height
is reached, and that
if
arbitrary limits
are
set, they should be relative
to the ventilating
capacities of the combination.
The following table gives equivalent
heights of different combinations, starting with 150 feet for a 3-inch
soil stack with no separate vent stack.
It will be observed by referring
to the vent charts that these maximum limits in height will seldom
apply in practice, for the reason that lower limits in the permissible
length of vent stack will be set in particular cases by the vent charts
or tables.

Figures 95, 96,97, 98, and 99 for soil stacks 3,4,5, 6, and 8 inches in
diameter, respectively, were formed by combining the curve of Figure
93 with the curves of Figure 94, substituting for the flow in the soil
stack
(fig. 94) the number of fixture units
(fig. 93) giving that flow as
an estimated peak load, and plotting the curves to these new coordi-
nates (number of fixture units—length of vent stack) and imposing
the maximum
limits
of Table
16.
The curves for vents larger or
smaller than the soil stack are extrapolated by applying assumption 4.
These curves, Figures 95 to 99, inclusive, are proposed for determining

The preceding tables have been given with only a brief outline of
the principles and calculations involved in their development.
They
are built around test or experimental determinations extended mathe-
matically into
tables.
Frequent mention has been made of factors
of safety, ranging in value from 2 to
10, added at different points in
making
the
approximations.
It
is
futile,
however,
to attempt
to
assign a definite value to the factor of safety applying to the system
as a whole.
The term “ factor of safety” as used here is essentially
different from a structural factor of safety in which strength of mate-
rials is involved.
In a plumbing system,
if the estimated peak load
is exceeded even to the extent of using up the factor of safety allowed;
the only result will be a temporary and slight decrease in the
effi-
ciency of operation, with no injury to the system itself.
Tables 14, 15, and 17 for sizes of stacks, horizontal drains, and vents,
respectively, give in the opinion of the writer thoroughly safe limits
and
are proposed
for
substitution
for
the corresponding
tables
of
the recommended code in
its contemplated revision.
They offer a
distinct advantage over the old tables in that they set variable limits
for use of the different sizes of pipe, depending on the length of pipe
and number and distribution of fixtures on the system.
It
is probable that a better knowledge
of carrying capacities
of
vertical and
horizontal
pipes,
of peak loads
actually
occurring
in
plumbing
systems,
and
of
vent
requirements
would,
by making
closer
approximations
possible,
permit
a
further
extension
of
the
limits proposed in these tables.
It is also probable that a knowledge
of the extent of recirculation of air in a plumbing system would also
lead to a reduction of the sizes of vent pipes.
They are not impos-
sible
fields
of
investigation
and promise
a
considerable
saving
in
plumbing
costs,
especially in
tall
buildings,
if
tnoroughly
reliable
data were obtained.

CHAPTER 8.—STANDARDIZATION OF PLUMBING
MATERIALS
The standardization
of the various
materials used
in plumbing
and the elimination of many articles and devices infrequently used
should reduce
the
cost
of plumbing.
Even
if standardization
be
confined
to dimensions and roughing-in measurements, much may
be accomplished; but matters of this sort do not directly affect the
public
health.
Standardization must be brought about by
agree-
ment between
all the parties interested.
Standardization
is for the
public benefit, irrespective of the police power.
While admitting that there
are some
real, though minor,
disad-
vantages
in
standardization,
yet,
if
not
carried
to
unreasonable
lengths,
standardization should
be
a
benefit
to manufacturer,
dis-
tributor, sanitary engineer, architect, plumber, municipal authority,
and owner.
It
should,
in
the long run, reduce production
costs;
lessen the stock required to be transported,
stored, and sold, thus
saving
overhead
expenses
and
increasing
the
turnover
of
stock;
lessen the time required to make plans and estimates of plumbing
work;
facilitate installation and repairs; reduce the original cost of
installation and the cost of maintenance and depreciation.
At the
time when the first edition of this report was issued the Department
of Commerce was
already making
excellent
progress
in
bringing
about simplification
of practice in various lines of business, and
it
was the opinion of the committee that this work might be profitably
extended to the plumbing industry.
The committee stated that the basis of standardization must be
the “Standard Plumbing Rules/’ or the plumbing code, as it is com-
monly
called.
While
the
Federal Government can not dominate
the States in the exercise of police power,
it can give advice and it
can set up model laws, the acceptance of which by States and cities
will result in effective uniformity.
It seemed certain that
the standardization of fixture dimensions
would result in material economies.
The only way that this stand-
ardization could be brought about was by the concerted action of
manufacturers,
distributors,
sanitary
engineers,
plumbers,
and
governmental authorities.
The committee
took
steps
to
ascertain what had
already been
done
in
this matter.
It found that many
efforts had been made
by various associations connected with the plumbing industry, and
that, in general, there was a strong desire on the part of engineers,
architects, manufacturers of plumbing supplies, plumbers,
builders,
and governmental authorities to have standardization brought about
in some way.
Some,
however,
were
indifferent
and
a few were
opposed.
206

STANDARDIZATION OF MATERIALS
207
The plumbing industry is highly differentiated.
There are many
kinds and
qualities
of materials used
in plumbing—cast-iron pipe,
steel
and
wrought-iron
screw
pipe,
vitrified-clay
pipe,
brass
pipe
and fittings; porcelain ware, enameled iron ware, Wooden ware,
etc.
Minor matters of standardization
affect a single branch of the in-
dustry, and much has
already been
accomplished by
associations
representing the several industries.
But there
are items of stand-
ardization which
affect moie than one branch
of industry; hence,
there
is need for a broader cooperation than has existed thus
far.
If there were no variance in plumbing rules, it would be a relatively
easy matter
for
the
different
associations
representing
the
indus-
tries to get together and adopt standards, but in the face of rules
which vary widely in
different parts of the country
it
is well-nigh
impossible for the parties interested to agree.
It seemed evident
to the committee that no
satisfactory stand-
ardization or simplification could be effected unless the parties to the
agreement
included
not
only
manufacturers,
but
State
and mu-
nicipal
authorities,
architects,
engineers,
house
builders,
master
plumbers, journeymen, and others.
Time did not permit the com-
mittee to undertake such an extended program, but it expressed the
hope that the Department of Commerce would arrange to have the
necessary conferences held in order that simplification in plumbing
practice might be established.
It was suggested that those interested in standardization might
well take advantage of the facilities extended by the United States
Department of Commerce for furtherance of such activities.
There
had been organized in this department a division of simplified prac-
tice, which offered
its services to the various industries in bringing
together
those
interested
in
standardization programs,
in making
the necessary arrangements for cooperation
of the various groups,
and
in
following up
the
projects
agreed upon.
Similar measures
had been
carried out by other industries through
aid
of the
divi-
sion of simplified practice with marked success, and
it was felt that
the plumbing industry should also avail itself of the opportunity.
Considerable work along
this
line has been done since the pub-
lication of the first edition of this report.
The results are embodied
in publications
of the
division
of simplified
practice,
of which the
following are examples:
Simplified practice recommendations:
No.
8. Range boilers.
No. 13.
Structural slate for plumbing and sanitary purposes.
No. 21.
Brass lavatory and sink traps.
No. 25. Hot-water storage tanks.
No. 29. Eaves trough conductor pipe, conductor elbows, and
fittings.
No. 32.
Staple vitreous china plumbing fixtures.
No. 57. Wrought-iron and wrought-steel pipe, valves, and fittings.

CHAPTER 9.—ADMINISTRATION
The committee has considered the subject of plumbing adminis-
tration and has studied the various laws by which plumbing regu-
lations
are now being put
in
force.
The subject
is
so complex,
affects so many different interests and classes of people, involves so
many legal matters which differ in different parts of the country and
in communities differently constituted that the committee has felt
itself incompetent to make
definite recommendations.
It presents
the following ideas as a basis of possible further investigation:
THE PLUMBING BUSINESS
Plumbing developed first as a craft.
The early simple plumbing
codes were based on the idea of protecting health by assuring good
craftsmanship and were sufficient.
Present conditions are different;
plumbing
is more elaborate; factory-made plumbing supplies have
replaced those made in the shop and on the job; the business element
has increased; cities have increased in size and changed in character;
the relations between owner and plumber, between employer and
employed, between buyer and
seller,
are
less
personal and more
artificial than formerly; plumbing is still highly technical; knowledge
of plumbing design
is even more important than
in former days;
good workmanship is still necessary.
To-day the so-called “master plumber” may be both a business
man and a craftsman.
As a business man he is related to the jobber
and the manufacturer from whom he obtains supplies; as a crafts-
man he
is
related
to
the journeymen and
apprentices whom he
employs.
Competition
is keen.
Journeymen are continually rising
into competition with the master plumbers.
In so far as they are
qualified this is desirable, but the incompetent journeymen are often
those most eager to force “themselves into the plumbing business.
Without
a shop, without
capital,
without
business
responsibility,
men ill-fitted by experience are undertaking to do plumbing work
buying their supplies and installing them in such a way as to pass
inspection
with
the
least
margin.
It
is
largely
because
of
this
situation that present-day plumbing
regulations need
to be more
detailed than formerly.
The people do not understand this situa-
tion and naturally look with disfavor on rules and regulations which
seem to them to have only one purpose—that of making plumbing
more expensive.
This element
of
the problem needs
to be more
thoroughly studied.
208

ADMINISTRATION OF CODE
209
ENFORCEMENT OF PLUMBING REGULATIONS
The enforcement of plumbing regulations
affects three classes of
people:
{a) The owner and his agents,
(b) the plumber, and
(c) the
public official.
The relations between these parties should be clearly
and
definitely set forth
in the laws and ordinances.
Without
at-
tempting to formulate these in legal terms the committee
is of the
opinion that the following items should be considered:
THE OWNER AND HIS AGENTS
1. The owner, or his agents—that is, architect, engineer, contractor
and
subcontractor,
foreman, and employee—should be
prohibited
from
installing plumbing
contrary
to
regulations,
but
the owner
should
not be
prevented from
personally
installing plumbing
in
accordance with the code, provided
this
is done subject to permit
and inspection.
Consideration should
also be given to a plan for
having the owner file a bond at the time of taking out a permit.
2. Owner or agent
(person,
firm,
or
corporation)
should be
re-
quired
to have permit
issued
after
(a)
filing
of
application, with
plan and specification;
(b)
approval of plan and specification before
signing of contract; and
(c) payment of fee.
3. Owner or agent (person, firm, or corporation) should be entitled
to receive a certificate of approval of the plumbing work done after
(a)
receipt of permit;
(b)
application for inspection; and
(c) approval
by inspector.
4. Penalties should be provided for:
(a) Failure to take out permit;
(b)
failure
to
apply
for
inspection;
and
(c)
noncompliance with
regulations and should result in refusal to issue certificate of approval
or in a fine in case plumbing is used without certificate of approval.
THE PLUMBER
1. The
status
of
the
plumber
(master
plumber,
contracting
plumber, or employing plumber—all agents of the owner) should be
provided for by registration in one of the following three ways:
(a)
By certificate of competency;
(b) by license; and
(c) by bond.
2. Plumber should be prohibited from
installing plumbing con-
trary to the regulations or without a permit for the work.
3. As agent of the owner, he should (a)
file application for permit,
with plans and specifications;
(b) pay fee;
(c) receive permit;
(d)
in-
stall work in accordance with regulations;
(e)
apply for inspection
and test; and
(/) deliver certificate of approval to owner.
4. Penalty for failure to comply with the law should be
(a) loss of
certificate of competency or license or forfeiture oi bond, and
(5) fine.
PROPER ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY
1. Jurisdiction in the enforcement of plumbing regulations should
be committed to the board of health, building department, or other
municipal department.
20141°—29
15

210
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
2. Under this jurisdiction a department or division
of plumbing
should be organized to enforce the regulations, the official in charge
being called the plumbing inspector.
3.
Duties of the plumbing inspector should be definitely assigned.
They should include such matters as
(a) examination of application
for plumbing, examination and approval of plans and specifications
issuance of permits and collection of fees;
(b ) inspection of plumbing
and conduct of tests;
(c) issuance of certificates of approval;
(d)
ar-
rest and prosecution of offenders;
(e)
office records and reports; and
(/) advisory service to the public in the matter of plumbing regula-
tions.
4.
Qualifications and status of plumbing inspector should include
such matters as
(a
)
competency in plumbing;
(b ) nonengagement in
the plumbing business or in the manufacture or sale of plumbing sup-
plies;
(c) bond;
(d) compensation; and
(e) authority to enter build-
ings.
5. A schedule
of fees should be
established,
the
total
of which
should approximately pay for the enforcement service, the individual
fees being graded according to the magnitude of the work.
6. Provisions should be made for enforcing the penalties upon each
of the three clauses of persons referred to.
7. The penalties for failure of plumbing inspector to perform his
duties should be loss of position, fine, or other appropriate penalty.
8. Limitation of discretionary power should be provided.
STATE PLUMBING LAWS
While the methods for the local enforcement of plumbing regula-
tions may be readily standardized and are, in fact, quite uniform at
the present time, the present State laws in regard to plumbing vary
greatly.
The committee
is of the opinion that the following provi-
sions should be included in the statutes
:
1. All plumbing throughout the State should conform to the basic
plumbing principles set forth in chapter 3.
These state results, not
methods.
They should be written into the statutes.
2. The State board
(or department)
of health should adopt
a
plumbing code in conformity with the basic plumbing principles and
revise the same when necessary.
3. Every city, town, or other subdivision of a State having a pub-
lic water supply should be required to have a plumbing code and
should either accept the State code or adopt a code of its own, subject
to
approval by
the
State board
(or
department)
of
health.
In
places where there is no public water supply the acceptance or adop-
tion of the code should be permissive.
4. In places where no code is accepted or adopted the basic plumb-
ing principles of the statutes should be enforced by State, county,

ADMINISTRATION OF CODE
211
or local boards of health.
If enforced by the State, the authority
should be vested in the division of sanitary engineering of the State
department of health.
5. Owners or plumbers doing plumbing work within the State should
be responsible for its compliance with the basic plumbing principles.
LICENSES
v. CERTIFICATES OF COMPETENCY
The license is a crude governmental device for assuring the public
that plumbing work will be done satisfactorily and in accordance
with
legal
regulations.
It was
originally
intended
to
guarantee
craftsmanship
and knowledge
of
the
regulations.
It
can do no
more, and it does not always do that.
It does not always stimulate
a plumber to improve his knowledge after his license has been secured.
It was not intended and, indeed, can not assure business competency
or reliability, and to-day the business side of plumbing is important.
The distinction between journeymen’s license and master plumbers’
license is vague and differs in quantity rather than in kind.
Furthermore, the license, which debars the competent nonlicensed
man from doing plumbing work, is not for the interest of the country,
for desirable individual competition is prevented.
The committee
is
of the opinion that the time has come for a
thorough study of the license system, with the idea of possibly sub-
stituting for it a system of certificates of competency—a system that
would tend to improve the status of the plumber by causing him to
be stimulated by competition both in business and craftsmanship,
and that would give greater protection to the public against faulty
plumbing.
Under a system of certificates of competency the owner
would desire to choose a certified plumber, whereas under the license
system he would be compelled to choose a licensed plumber.
What is needed is some plan to give the public confidence in the
persons who
are engaged
in the plumbing business.
If plumbers
will actively take up the problem of raising their own status on the
basis of competency, a great deal can be accomplished in establish-
ing the confidence of the public in the plumbing industry.
The committee wishes to place on record its appreciation of what
the plumbing industry has done to improve the living conditions in
American homes.
People generally do not appreciate the extent to
which house plumbing has improved
the public health.
The
in-
fluence has often been indirect rather than direct, and for that reason
it has not always been easy
to
recognize.
Public water supplies
would lose much of their value were it not for the opportunity to use
water
at
convenient
fixtures.
The
disposal
of
fecal
matter,
the
greatest sanitary problem in the world,
is best solved by the intro-
duction of the modern water-closet.

CHAPTER 10.—EXPLANATORY NOTES AND COMMENTS
In further explanation of various matters discussed in the report,
and in answer
to questions which were raised by those who
sub-
mitted comments on the tentative report of the first edition, the com-
mittee has prepared the following series of notes.
NOTE
1. DATA OBTAINED BY QUESTIONNAIRE
The
tentative report included
a compilation
of data
relating
to
plumbing regulations in different cities and States and a statistical
analysis of various items found in 81 plumbing codes.
The data were
secured as a result of a questionnaire sent out before the committee
began its work.
Many correspondents criticized
these data because
of their incompleteness and their nonrepresentative character.
The
committee, therefore, decided not to publish these statistics with its
final
report.
Only one conclusion could be drawn from the
facts
collected, namely, that the present situation with reference to plumb-
ing laws and codes was nothing less than chaotic.
#
NOTE
2. PURITY OF WATER SUPPLY
If the water supply is from a public source, the individual house-
holder has no responsibility except
as a
citizen.
If the supply
is
from a local source, such as a well, the responsibility rests upon nim
to provide pure water, and the health department may exercise con-
trol, under the police power, if the supply is not safe.
The plumber,
by using proper methods of sewage disposal, thereby preventing the
pollution of the soil, can do much
to safeguard local water supplies.
There is no reason why rural dwellers should not enjoy safe and com-
fortable living conditions more nearly like those of the city dweller
than is now the case.
Some of the committee’s correspondents have called attention to
the possibilities
of injury to health through the use of lead water-
supply pipes or of lead joint compounds for the installation of pipes.
In
this connection the nature
of the local water supply should be
given careful consideration.
The subject of corrosion, including the
use of lead, is discussed at length in Appendix B.
NOTE
3. DUAL SOURCES OF WATER SUPPLY
It sometimes happens
that
there
are two
or more
supplies
of
water—a pure water for drinking and an impure or unsafe water for
flushing.
This creates a dangerous condition, as an unsafe water,
if
212

EXPLANATORY NOTES AND COMMENTS
213
available,
is
liable
to be used
through ignorauce
or by
mistake.
Cross connections between pure and impure systems under such cir-
cumstances are always hazardous and should not be permitted except
under special conditions.
Preferably all water supplied to buildings
should be pure.
NOTE
4. ADEQUACY OF WATER SUPPLY
If the water supply in a building is not adequate, the fixtures will
become foul, insanitary, and dangerous to health.
The problem of
insuring an adequate water supply for each building is not a simple
one.
There are three major factors which affect the supply of water
available at fixtures, namely, the pressure in the mains, the size and
length of supply pipe, together with the number of changes in
its
course, and the number of fixtures which probably will be operated
simultaneously.
There
is much
evidence
that
the
rule-of-thumb
methods so often used by builders and plumbers have not resulted
satisfactorily.
The combination of small pipes and large faucets should be avoided.
Pipes of corrodible material, such as steel or wrought iron, should
be large enough to allow for the effects of interior rusting, especially
in localities where the water is known to be corrosive.
Small-sized
pipes and interior corrosion reduce the water pressure available at
faucets, and householders frequently complain
of low pressure
in
the mains when the trouble
is really with their own plumbing sys-
tems.
The custom in some places of using service pipes as small as
one-half inch
in diameter does not admit
of adequate
service
to
several fixtures simultaneously.
Use of the garden hose, for exam-
ple, or the operation of a flush valve may, for the time being, absorb
all or nearly all the supply of a building, and lack of adequate flushing
water may
set
up
insanitary
conditions
in
water-closets.
The
tendency of the day is to use larger service pipes than formerly.
In some places water-supply pressures are too great, resulting in
water waste and in unnecessary wear of valve seats with resulting
continuous leakage.
It is possible, however, to use pressure-reducing
valves.
Attention
is called to the fact that flush valves
if used without
supply tanks make greater demand on
the system than do tank
closets because they use water at a higher rate.
Where flush valves
are used without a tank the supply pipes in the building, and even
the service pipe in the street, should be of larger size than where
tank closets are used.
It is possible, however, to use supply tanks
in connection with flush valves.
The problem
is one of balancing
the cost of larger pipes with the cost of a supply tank.

NOTE
5. PRESSURE RELIEF FOR WATER-HEATING APPARATUS
Serious results from the explosion of hot-water heaters or boilers
are frequently reported and are foimd due in almost every case to
stoppage of the hot-water pipes, overheating, or the lack of provision
for
pressure
relief.
Overheating
of
the
copper
used
for
boilers
reduces its strength.
Boilers should be provided with relief valves
or with one or more
relief faucets which will automatically open
under high pressure.
Under some circumstances hot water may be
forced hack into the cold-water supply pipe and service pipe, and,
if
there
is a meter on the system, moving parts made of hard rubber
will be damaged
thereby.
To
protect
meters, check
valves
are
sometimes placed on the supply line inside the meter, but this only
increases the danger of boiler explosion.
When these check valves
are used the need for adequate relief valves becomes
all the greater.
NOTE
6. DESIRABILITY OF SEWER CONNECTIONS
Privies, cesspools, and other means for the disposal of fecal matter
are so frequently the cause of insanitary conditions that they should
not be permitted to exist where public sewers
are
available.
The
advisability
of sewer connections wherever possible and
the need
of
a
separate house sewer
for each
building have been
strongly
emphasized by the committee’s correspondents.
NOTE
7. PROVISION OF WATER-CLOSETS
The reason for specifically requiring at least one water-closet for
each family
is that
if one closet
is used by more than one family
lack
of
responsibility
for
its
upkeep
leads
to
uncleanliness
and
indecency.
The question has been raised by correspondents whether
this provision should not be included in a housing code rather than
as a part
of the plumbing
regulations.
While from one point
of
view
this may be
logical,
yet
for
administrative
purposes
better
results will be secured by making it a plumbing requirement.
NOTE
8. FIXTURE DESIGN
From a health point of view it is essential that plumbing fixtures
shall be
of smooth, nonabsorbent material,
as
free
as practicable
from concealed fouling surfaces, and
set free
of inclosures.
They
should be suitably designed for their respective uses and for con-
venience in cleaning.
This will help greatly to avoid dirt accumu-
lation and continual dampness,
will prevent growth of insects and
fungi, and minimize odors due to existence of insanitary conditions.
A number of the committee’s correspondents have called attention
to the insanitary possibilities of the device known as the u standing
waste and overflow.”
This device is now made so that it is devoid
of its former objectionable features.

EXPLANATORY NOTES AND COMMENTS
215
Many plumbing fixtures now on the market exhibit inconsistencies
that do not seem
to be
justified.
The
clear area
of opening in
strainers, plugs, fixture couplings,
tailpieces, and traps
is not such
as to insure equivalent flow at these points for any individual fixture.
At present the relations of these elements of fixture design appear
to be illogical and open to improvement.
The plumbing regulations
of many cities prescribe the size of traps required for different kinds
of fixtures without prescribing the
sizes
of fixture outlets or pro-
hibiting constrictions between the trap and fixture.
Some distinction
should be made between fixtures which drain rapidly and those which
drain slowly.
The rules for plumbing in many cities fix the sizes of drainage and
vent pipes required for the service of different kinds and numbers
of fixtures but do not prescribe the maximum permissible rate
of
flow or discharge from the fixtures, the only controlling feature fixed
by the rules being the
size
of the
trap
or waste.
The discharge
through them may vary greatly with
different
types,
design, and
method of installation.
There are believed to be possibilities of economy in use of water
by
a more
efficient
design
of
water-closets.
These
have
been
designed almost entirely from the manufacturers’ point of view, with
the object of insuring successful operation but with small regard for
the amount of water used.
Users also have, in general, disregarded
this consideration.
Through a mistaken idea that large quantities of
water are necessary to clean the bowl thoroughly and operate the
system effectively, some codes have required fixtures to be designed
for comparatively large quantities of water.
The fact should not be
lost sight of, however, that water is needed to transport solids to the
sewer as well as to flush closets.
The provision of an adequate water supply is in many cases difficult
and in
all cases a serious item
of municipal expense and deserves
attention.
The committee is of the opinion that by improvement of
water-closet design the quantity of water necessary for satisfactory
operation of such fixtures may be materially reduced.
It is recom-
mended that as a matter of national economy a thorough investiga-
tion
of
these
possibilities be undertaken by the manufacturers
of
water-closets.
Owing to the lack of time, the committee has not made a thorough
study of
fixtures, but
finds
that many are not well
designed.
A
special study of fixture design could well be made by manufacturers
in order to determine the practical elements best adapted to secure
sanitary and efficient fixtures of moderate cost.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
NOTE
9. VELOCITY OF WASTE WATER IN DRAINAGE SYSTEMS
The dangers
of clogging are
serious, and a
well-designed
house
drainage system
should remove from
the
building
as
quickly
as
possible the waste water and
all the materials
it conveys without
unnecessary fouling
of
the
pipes and
appliances.
The fouling
of
pipes may be caused by the adhesion of greasy and sticky materials
to the walls of the pipes, or by the deposit of material carried in sus-
pension in the waste water, or by both of these causes.
The results
of fouling
are a
decrease
in
the
carrying
capacities
of the
pipes,
stoppages
either
partial
or complete
in
drainage and vent
pipes,
which may impair the service or stop it altogether, the production of
deleterious and corrosive gases through the decomposition of organic
matter,
the development
of
bacterial and fungus growths on
the
organic matter in the pipes, and the production of noxious odors.
A well-designed system of house drainage should aim to reduce these
ill effects to a minimum, but they can not be completely eliminated.
Furthermore, a slight coating on the interior of the pipes sometimes
offers some protection against corrosion.
It
is realized that the subject
is charged with variable and con-
flicting elements.
If the pipes are of a size to scour under the dis-
charge of a single fixture, they may be too small for proper service
under simultaneous discharge from several fixtures.
If designed for
several
coincident
discharges,
they may not scour under
the
dis-
charge from a single fixture, and scour will occur only periodically
when favorable coincident discharges take place.
If the waste pipes
run full, the aspirating and self-siphonage effect on fixture traps will
be increased, and venting protective for partial flow will be inade-
quate for full flow.
It is possible in this connection that more efficient fixture design
elsewhere suggested may render feasible reduction in size of branch
drain and vent pipes now generally specified without reducing their
convenient and useful service or increasing the danger of stoppage.
NOTE
10. USEFUL LIFE OF SYSTEM
Leakage
is, perhaps,
the greatest danger to be guarded
against.
This is influenced by the kind and strength of materials, the nature
of joints, the method of attaching the pipes to the building, the depth
of pipes in the soil, air circulation and diffusion, methods of passing
pipes through building walls or foundations, etc.
In view of the stress placed upon plumbing design and construction
as a matter affecting health,
the committee thinks that
it
is only
logical to insure, so far as possible, the permanence of the protection
thus secured, and that such materials and workmanship should at all
times be required as will produce a plumbing system as nearly as
possible equal in
life to that of the structure inclosing
it.
This is

EXPLANATORY NOTES AND COMMENTS
217
specially important in the case of pipes placed in walls or otherwise
not readily accessible for inspection or repair.
Aside from care in construction there are other factors affecting
the useful
life
of plumbing systems.
Inadequate foundations and
unskillful
framing
of
buildings
sometimes
cause
settlement
with
resulting structural failures in plumbing systems which no precau-
tions as to design, materials, or workmanship would prevent.
Igno-
rance and carelessness
as
to the proper use
of plumbing are often
responsible for corrosion or clogging
of pipes and improper use
of
fixtures.
NOTE
11. LIMITATIONS TO THE USE OF CLEAN OUTS
Clean
outs on plumbing systems
are important and
useful
for
three purposes—to remove any stoppage of the pipes,
to provide
means for testing the separate parts of a drainage system by the use
of water or
air, and to make
it possible to give the system a final
air-pressure test after the fixtures have been installed.
Clean outs
should be accessible and so made that the ordinary householder can
open and replace them.
They should be
as few
in number
as
is
consistent with
these
requirements.
Because
of
the danger
that
clean-out caps will be removed and not replaced some
cities have
discouraged and
even
prohibited
their
use.
The committee
does
not approve this prohibition.
NOTE
12. TRAPPING OF FIXTURES
The effectiveness of traps in preventing access of vermin to drains
and the escape of sewer air into rooms
is partially sacrificed when
more than
one
fixture
is
connected
to
the same
trap.
There
is
generally a greater length of untrapped waste pipe exposed, and dirty
water is liable to flow from one fixture to another.
Laundry trays
or a sink and tray can safely be thus connected, but greater satis-
faction will be obtained
if each fixture is separately trapped.
NOTE
13. GREASE-TRAP REQUIREMENTS
Some
cities require grease traps to be installed on kitchen sinks
in residences as well as in hotel and restaurant kitchens.
While they
undoubtedly
are
desirable
for
these larger
installations,
the com-
mittee thinks that in private residences the danger of neglect offsets
their
beneficial
qualities and recommends
that
they be
omitted,
except where sewage
is disposed
of in small septic tanks or under
private auspices.
The operation
of septic tanks, such as are commonly used with
rural homes, is seriously hindered by the presence of grease in quan-
tity, and wherever possible in such cases the kitchen wastes should
be disposed of separately from fecal matter.

218
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENT'S
The clogging of waste pipes with grease, hair, lint, or other matter
is generally due to improper sizes of piping and faulty construction
rather than carelessness of the housewife.
The committee contends
that a plumbing system properly designed with pipes,
fittings, and
connections
that form
a smooth
interior
waterway which
gives
opportunity to carry
off any solids or semisolids in suspension can
not and will not become clogged under ordinary usage.
Wherever
a small horizontal waste pipe discharges into a pipe of considerably
larger area, which makes it impossible to secure the proper scouring
action, there is a likelihood of stoppage.
The quick change in tem-
perature and the greater area
of the pipe forms
a natural grease
receptacle.
The use of caustic soda or soda lye in drains should be
discouraged, as it makes a hard soap and may increase the clogging.
There are several instances on
record where workmen have been
burned and blinded due to ignorance and criminal carelessness in the
use of this substance.
Potash or potash lye is sometimes used advan-
tageously prior to flushing with hot water as
it makes a soft soap
which
will
not
clog
the
pipes.
Properly
sized
waste
pipes
will
minimize
stoppages and
the
necessity
of
the
use
of any
foreign
materials.
NOTE
14. AIR CIRCULATION
IN PLUMBING
Fixture drains should be designed so as to prevent self-siphonage
of
traps.
Ventilation
of
drainage
systems
tends
to
prevent
the
growth of the fungi which produce “slime” and to retard corrosion
by the evaporation of moisture.
Chief reliance for ventilation of the drainage system and for relief
of pressure changes set up by fixture discharge is placed upon a free
course
of
air from street sewer
to roof terminal.
Effects
of frost
closure as determined by experiments apparently are so slight as to
be negligible
if a clear opening is left at the top of the stack equal
in area to a circle 1J inches in diameter.
A diameter of 4 inches at
the roof line has been found adequate under most conditions, but
in some parts of the United States and in Canada severe climatic
conditions require increasers 2 inches wider than the pipe diameter
below the
roof.
Extension
of such
pipes above
the
elevation
of
possible snowdrifts has been found unnecessary, as the escaping air
“honeycombs” the snow sufficiently to prevent obstruction.
It also
has been found that vent pipes which extend but a few inches above
the roof are less subject to frost closure than longer lengths.
This,
however, sometimes increases the effect of wind pressure on the trap
seals.
NOTE
15. SIMULTANEOUS DISCHARGES
The committee’s assumptions as to proportion of fixtures likely to
be discharged simultaneously were presented in the tentative report
and were received without criticism.
One or two reviewers pointed

EXPLANATORY NOTES AND COMMENTS
219
out that these assumptions erred on the side of safety,
if at
all.
As
elsewhere
stated, much thought was given
to
this
subject and
a
valuable body
of
data and
computations
has been
accumulated,
bearing on similar questions in large buildings.
NOTE
16. ADMISSION OF DESTRUCTIVE SUBSTANCES
Substances such
as gasoline and
oil from garages,
acids, steam,
grease in large quantities, liquids containing
silt, hairs,
fibers,
etc.,
ought not to be admitted to plumbing systems or to sewers.
While
the abuse of plumbing systems can not,
of course, always be pre-
vented,
connections
plainly
intended
for
the
admission
of
such
substances can be forbidden.
NOTE
17. LIGHTING AND VENTILATION OF WATER-CLOSET COM-
PARTMENTS
The requirement that water-closet compartments be well lighted
and ventilated to the outer air, as submitted in the tentative report
of the first edition, was somewhat severely criticized.
The committee
thinks, however, that at least for the small
dwelling house the
re-
quirement involves no hardship to the owner.
It is the general observation, furthermore, that direct lighting and
ventilation tend to prevent carelessness in the use and maintenance
of fixtures in cases where living standards are not of the highest.
If
the compartments are dark, the fixtures are likely to become soiled
from neglect.
Ventilation
is important in order
to prevent odors
and to dilute any air accidentally escaping through the fixtures.
The provision of a window opening directly to the outer air is apt
to be omitted only in the case of speculative builders selling or renting
a cheap type of house, and under such circumstances the improved
sanitary conditions resulting from direct lighting and ventilation are
well worth while.
NOTE
18. SEWAGE DISPOSAL
Precautions should be taken to prevent the possible pollution of
wells or other sources of water supply and the escape of sewage on
the surface of the ground.
Local soil conditions are an important
factor, and so many conditions may exist that an inspection of each
situation
is necessary.
Eequirements must vary according
to
soil
and climate.
The committee has not felt called upon to discuss the
subject of local sewage disposal in detail, especially as the matter is
now being considered by the board of excreta disposal of the United
States
Public Health
Service.
The methods
adopted must vary
according to local conditions.
Many State departments of health,
the United
States
Public Health
Service,
and
the United
States
Department of Agriculture have issued bulletins giving information
on this subject.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
NOTE
19. OMISSION OF THE MAIN HOUSE TRAP
The committee finds that this trap and the fresh-air inlet are in
most cases a needless expense.
Experiments under the committee’s
supervision have shown that the house trap interferes with the flow
of sewage and
air movements in the house drain.
It increases the
possibility of trouble from back pressure in the soil stack.
Its omis-
sion gives opportunity of inoffensively ventilating the
street sewers
through a multiplicity of outlets.
Where the sewage
is discharged
into a septic tank, a trap and a foot vent on the house side of it is
thought by some to he desirable in order to prevent the escape of
the tank air and to maintain a circulation of air in the house system,
but with the septic tank properly designed it is not necessary.
The recommendation in the tentative report of the first edition that
installation of the main or house trap and fresh-air inlet be discon-
tinued aroused much discussion.
Of the respondents who discussed
this matter in particular, the greatest number favor the omission of
the house trap, a few would retain it, and a few seem to think that it3
advantages and disadvantages
are about equal.
The committee’s
reasons for advocating its omission have already been given.
The
chief arguments of those who would retain it are as follows
It is argued that fixture traps and floor-drain traps do occasionally
siphon in spite of
all precautions and that leaks in the pipe system
occur because of structural failures and settlements, thermal expan-
sion, and poor workmanship.
In such cases the house trap affords
an
additional barrier
against admission
of sewer
air,
insects,
etc.
To this it may be said that conditions within the house system give
rise to emanations fully as objectionable as those from the sewer.
It has been shown
conclusively that
in very
cold
climates
the
increased circulation of air through the house system results in clos-
ing roof vents completely with hoar frost, and the use of house traps
has been found absolutely necessary.
It is argued that in cities where house traps are now generally in
use the installation of systems not thus equipped exposes occupants
of neighboring buildings to concentrated fumes from sewer systems
otherwise unvented.
This may, under certain circumstances, justify
the requirement
of a house
trap, but where a reasonable distance
intervenes between
roof vent and neighboring windows
the com-
mittee thinks that use of the house trap should be optional.
Careful observations made in England have disclosed that sewer
systems
are,
in general, much more thoroughly ventilated through
manhole leakage, etc., than is popularly supposed, and that the pres-
ence or omission of house traps has at most a minor influence on the
atmospheric conditions in sewers.
In this connection
it should also
be remembered that the fresh air inlet, as an indispensable adjunct

EXPLANATORY NOTES AND COMMENTS
221
to the house trap, may be a very real nuisance to those in its neigh-
borhood.
It is argued that the main house trap prevents incursions of rats
from the main sewer system.
Observations both in this country and
in England show that rats can pass readily through large house traps,
and the usefulness of the traps in this respect, therefore, is question-
able.
The best protection against rats is the small fixture trap, and
since soil pipes are no longer customarily made of lead the danger
of rats passing from sewers to the house system is not as important
as formerly.
NOTE
20. PLUMBING AS RELATED TO BUILDING DESIGN
The practice of fixing the location of plumbing fixtures on the floor
plans without taking into consideration the importance of supply and
drainage pipe construction very often results in poor, undesirable, and
costly installation.
Whether in walls or partitions or beneath floors,
sufficient piping space must be provided
to eliminate complicated
and undesirable
construction and
the use
of unnecessary
fittings,
which add to the cost of labor and material without increasing the
efficiency of the system.
In designing the plumbing and drainage system architects and engi-
neers should bear in mind that adequate piping space must be pro-
vided in order that the system may be installed in an efficient and
economical manner.
Type of building construction, fixtures to be served, and location
of supply and waste pipes are equally important and can not be
divorced.
It must be remembered always that the highest type of
plumbing fixtures will not function properly without efficient water
supply and drainage.
NOTE
21. THREE-INCH
SOIL STACKS
The use of the 3-inch soil stack, recommended in the tentative report
preceding the first edition, was very thoroughly discussed in the letters
received regarding that report.
Nearly all respondents expressed un-
qualified. approval of 3-inch stacks for small dwellings, most of these
reporting satisfactory experience with such systems in practice.
A few
opposed the use of 3-inch stacks on
the grounds that they are more
likely to clog and that pressure disturbances
are more
serious, but
only two of these mention actual observation of the 3-inch systems in
use.
Several raised the question as to whether lack of ventilation and
increased back pressure would occur with the smaller pipe.
In answer
to
these
doubts
it may be stated that experiments and computa-
tions have shown
that
the
3-inch stack is less subject to undesir-
able pneumatic conditions than the 4-inch stack, for the reason that

222
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
the
quantity
of
air moved in
a
3-inch
is
less
than
in
a 4-inch
stack.
There
is less ventilation of the street-sewer system through
the 3-inch soil stack, hut this is a minor consideration in view of other
advantages.
NOTE
22. VITRIFIED CLAY PIPE
The committee decided that the use of vitrified clay pipe should
be prohibited for house drains—that is, for use inside of dwellings
on the basis of history, experience, and weight of authority.
The
committee favors the idea of having arrangements made for a thor-
ough study of its safety and fitness for use in house drains.
NOTE
23. SIZES OF DISTRIBUTION PIPE
The proper sizes for the water pipes leading to the various fixtures
depend upon several factors, such as the material of the pipe, the
water pressure, the length of the pipe, the size of the faucet, and the
rate
at which water needs
to be used.
The
figures given
in the
recommended code
as minimum
sizes
will
ordinarily be
sufficient
in dwelling houses where the service pressure is as high as 35 pounds
per square inch and when
the
pipes
are unobstructed with
rust.
They are safe for use where brass pipe is used or for wrought iron or
steel pipe where the water is hard or noncorrosive.
If the water is
corrosive, wrought iron or steel pipes, even though galvanized,
are
liable to rust and clog, so that their carrying capacity is diminished.
The rate at which rusting occurs depends upon the character of the
pipe, the corrosiveness
of the water, the oxygen in the water, the
temperature,
the quantity and
velocity
of water flowing through
the pipe, etc.
Pipes carrying water which has been softened by the
use of lime often become incrusted, and some allowance needs to be
made for this factor.
The loss in capacity
of iron or
steel pipe through rusting
is an
important consideration.
Actual data are
difficult to obtain hence
experiments on this subject would be useful.
The following figures
show the approximate relative equivalents
of pipe suitable for use
under different conditions, but not
all
of the
sizes given are com-
mercially obtainable.

NOTE
24. CAST-IRON PIPE
The committee has had no opportunity to investigate the quality
and weight
of plumbing
materials,
and
its recommendations
are
conventional, following the best average practice of the present time.
In the case of cast-iron pipe referred to in section 29 of Article III,
reference
is made
to
the American Society for Testing
Materials
Standard Specifications for Cast-Iron Soil Pipe and Fittings.
These
specifications call for the so-called extra heavy pipe, the dimensions
of which are based on a wall thickness
of one-fourth inch, whereas
so-called standard pipe
is based on
a
thickness of only one-eighth
inch.
The
committee
is
of the opinion that
extra heavy pipe
is
unnecessarily heavy, but
that standard
pipe
is
too
light
for
the
great majority of plumbing uses.
The tonnage of iron which is used
in soil pipe is great enough to warrant a thorough scientific study of
the whole subject in the interest of the best engineering practice and
the conservation
of natural resources.
The committee favors the
idea that the manufacturers
of
soil pipe,
in cooperation with the
American Society for Testing Materials, should investigate the ques-
tion of reducing the wall thickness of cast-iron soil pipe to some thick-
ness between one-eighth and one-fourth inch, and
if such reduction
is found desirable and practicable, to standardize the same and allow
cast-iron pipe of the new dimensions to take the place of the extra
heavy and standard pipe now in common use.
The committee also
favors
a
careful study involving the manufacture of cast-iron
soil
pipe in lengths exceeding 5 feet.
A thickness of three-sixteenths inch
for straight pipe has been suggested, but the committee
is of the
opinion that the actual dimensions of both pipe and fittings should
be based on tests of strength and quality of metal and other involved
factors and should not be the result of compromise or off-hand opinion.
The committee recommends
also
that manufacturers
of
cast-iron
pipe continue
to develop and market small
sizes of pipe, namely,
1J and li inches in diameter.
NOTE 25. SIMPLIFICATION AND COST REDUCTION
The chief object of the simplifications and modifications of plumb-
ing rules recommended by the committee has been to secure to the
owner of a dwelling a better and more durable plumbing system and
to accomplish this, if possible, at a lessened first cost.
It is believed
that
if the recommended rules are
generally applied both of these
objects will be secured, and that both of them will be of financial
value
to
the
building owner.
It would be
interesting,
if
it were
possible, to express these benefits in dollars and cents, but because
of the widely varying plumbing regulations in different parts of the
country,
because
of
different
unit
prices
of
materials,
different
freight costs and labor costs, any attempted comparison would be far
from accurate and would have only an
illustrative value.
In spite

224
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
of this fact, it seemed desirable to attempt a comparison to show the
effect of simplification on the first cost of plumbing.
Estimates were made of the probable number of dwellings likely
to be built during the 10 years following the first edition of the report
in order to replace old buildings, to make up for the lack of building
during the war, and provide for the increasing population.
The
computations
were
interesting
and
suggestive.
In many
localities the first cost of plumbing will be materially reduced if the
recommended code
is adopted in place
of those now in force.
In
localities without plumbing codes the quality of plumbing will be
improved at a slightly increased cost.
On the whole, the adoption
of the committee’s recommendation should save to the people who
build dwelling houses very large sums of money, the figures probably
amounting to several million dollars per annum.
Furthermore, these
savings in first cost do not
tell the whole story.
Lessened bills for
maintenance and
repairs and lower
depreciation
of the plumbing
systems are important matters to the householder, but there are no
data upon which to estimate them even approximately.
In this matter of cost the committee wishes to emphasize the fact
that good designing in plumbing will do as much, and, perhaps, more,
to save money to the house owner than simplified regulations.
Plumb-
ing systems should be made safe and permanent regardless of legal
requirements.
The
competent
plumber
can
save money
for
the
owner by advising him in the choice of fixtures and by laying out
the work
carefully with
full knowledge
of
the
regulations.
The
architect can save money by arranging rooms in which plumbing
fixtures are placed in such a way that fixtures are located near the
stacks and that the number of stacks is reduced to a minimum.
In
order to have simple plumbing, the buildings themselves must be
simple.
The committee believes that uniformity in plumbing regulations
will tend to promote economy,
as
it
will
facilitate
design, reduce
“ overhead” costs of plumber and architect, and lay the foundations
for standardization and simplified practice, and that the substitution
of the “ certificate of competency” for the “ license” will secure better
plumbing and ultimately reduce costs by developing greater com-
petency in those who design and install plumbing.

PART IV.—APPENDICES
APPENDIX A.—MINORITY REPORT
When the tentative report of the first edition, to which reference
has been made, was prepared for distribution, one member of the
committee did not approve the stand taken by the rest in regard to
the question of venting.
His objections were presented in the form
of a minority report which was duly presented with the tentative
draft of the majority report for general discussion.
His report is as
follows
As a member of the subcommittee on plumbing of the Building
Code Committee, I regret to inform you that I find
it necessary to
express disagreement with the report
of the committee only with
regard, however, to section 4 of the summary, which reads
4. Separate venting—that
is, an individual vent for each trap—is not neces-
sary.
Group venting—that
is, providing one vent for the group of fixtures—
is safe under certain conditions designated in the report.
Adequate provision,
however, must be made for air circulation.
I disagree with the committee in the
first statement: “ Separate
venting—that
is, an individual vent for each fixture—is not neces-
sary.”
_ It therefore becomes necessary on my part to file a minority
report in connection with this matter.
As a journeyman plumber, with an experience upward of 35 years,
I feel free to say that I possess practical knowledge as to the utility
and necessity for
direct or separate venting.
My experience has
been such
as
to warrant an unshaken
conviction
in
the popular
practice
of modern
high-grade plumbing
for
the employment
of
direct or separate vent as a preventative against siphonic action.
It
is freely admitted in the majority report that the official tests
conclusively proved up the generally accepted theory on siphonage
that is to say, in a battery of fixtures the discharge of one was shown
to siphon the trap
of another—and
as
a
corrective, ventilation
is
recommended
It
is further admitted that the
tests were conducted with clear
water discharging through a clear system, and that resulted siphonage
might be intensified
after constant household
use, yet
this actual
condition was
given no
consideration
evidently
in
the
expressed
opinion that direct or individual venting is not necessary.
The experimental tests conducted by the committee were abnormal
in the sense that the bore of the traps and waste lines were perfectly
clear and, therefore, free of the fouling matter as found in the system
reduces the bore of the trap and
,
v
the
tests proved,
under certain conditions, that without vent a fixture filled to capacity
when discharged produced siphonic action in the trap.
A waste trap is in its final analysis a cesspool intended to arrest the
discharge of polluted air from the house dram into the room where the
fixture is installed.

force of the fixture it serves or that of another connected with the sys-
tem, then it has ceased to function as a measure of protection against
the
introduction
of
noxious
gases.
Under
these
circumstances
it
must be plain that we can not afford to take a chance with such a deli-
cate and vital question as the public health, nor are we justified in
modifying a condition that has received popular approval for upward
of 40 years.
Permit me to draw your attention to the fact that malignant epi-
demics have been practically eliminated in our country, and we stand
preeminently as the most healthful nation on the earth.
Sanitation
lias played its part in not only banishing the terrors of plagues from
our country, but from those neighboring States over which we have
been privileged to exercise some measure of sanitary authority.
For
nearly half a century the preponderating opinion of the thousands
upon thousands of those having to do with sanitation has favored
direct or separate vents as a means of preventing waste-trap siphonage.
Therefore, direct vents have been accepted as an integral part of a
plumbing system.
Those favoring high-grade plumbing have a right
to claim equal credit with all others whose efforts have been helpful in
producing the sanitary conditions herewith referred to.
Loop venting as a substitute for the direct method is tantamount
to an acceptance of the minimum, and minimum rule
is sometimes
dangerous.
As an instance of proof, permit me to draw your atten-
tion to a certain theater
1 in this city that was erected under the mini-
mum rule; that
is, established conditions were not observed;
cost,
perhaps, was
reduced by noncompliance with
the
building
code,
without regard to the safety of patrons.
You will recall that as a
result of failure to afford proper protection against accident nearly
100 lives were sacrificed.
This is one of hundreds of cases that might be cited where minimum
rule has exacted toll when chance was taken with human life, and yet
it
is proposed in the majority report that a system of venting be
adopted likely to place in jeopardy the life of our entire urban popu-
lation as against one which has assisted in the elimination of pesti-
lential ravages.
In careful, orderly, well-kept homes loop or group venting may not
be considered dangerous, but in these hideous disease does not lurk.
All homes, however, are not well kept; indeed, the contrary
is the
case in many, while in many, many more filth abounds and pestilence
finds its origin in filth.
For this reason the maximum rule has been
invoked in preference to the minimum, with credit to its sponsors.
Believing it to be unnecessary to further discuss my objection to
section 4 (mentioned above) contained in the summary of the ma-
jority report, I, therefore, feel called upon to submit to you this state-
ment in the form of a minority report and protest to that
filed by
Chairman George C. Whipple, under date of June 16, 1922, and beg
leave to add that in other respects the report of the subcommittee on
plumbing meets with my approval.

REPLY TO MINORITY REPORT
In replying to the minority report the committee wishes to explain
that when Mr. Spencer wrote his report the experiments made at the

APPENDIX A
MINORITY REPORT
227
Bureau
of Standards had not been completed and bis resignation
from the committee prevented him from having advantage of the
results subsequently obtained.
Inasmuch as the recommendations
of the committee given in the tentative report remain practically un-
changed
in the
final report as to the matter upon which he took
issue—namely, the necessity of venting every trap separately—and
as about
half a dozen
of those who commented on the tentative
report supported the minority report in its contention, the committee
thinks that a frank explanation of its position should be made.
The committee holds that every fixture trap should be protected
from siphonage and back pressure, and that
air circulation be
as-
sured by means of a vent pipe.
The committee
is of the opinion
that complete venting of fixture traps
is necessary, but that sepa-
rate venting—that is, an individual vent for every trap—is unneces-
sary.
.
The minority report held that an individual vent for each
trap is necessary.
The issue is clear cut.
In everyday practice, and that which has been approved for more
than 30 years, 2 sinks, 2 lavatories, 2 bathtubs, or 2 water-closets,
which are located on the same floor back to back on opposite sides
of partitions, have been served by a common waste and vent pipe.
Separate or individual venting of these fixture traps is not necessary.
Adequate protection from self-siphonage and back pressure have been
afforded and air circulation assured.
Again,
it has been considered
good practice for years to stack-vent top fixture traps.
This is sound
practice in which complete and adequate venting
is provided, but
this could not be classed as separate or individual venting.
It
is true that most of the experimental tests of the committee
were abnormal
in the sense
that they were clear-water
tests, but
there was consistency in the size of the fixture opening, the trap and
waste pipe in which scouring action was assured, and the probability
of fouling being reduced to a minimum.
It should also be remem-
bered that stoppages in the waste pipe of a fixture affect only that
part of the horizontal vent pipe above the fixture branch and below
its water level, and should stoppage occur in the waste or vent pipe
it would have the same effect on the separate or individual vent as
on the common vent.
The probability of a partially clogged branch
waste pipe serving a bathtub and a lavatory affecting the water seals
of either trap would only occur on the coincident discharge of both
fixtures, with the result that the bathtub trap would be subject to
siphonage.
The length of time required to discharge a lavatory
is
so much shorter than that required to discharge a bathtub that the
possibility of the loss of trap seal in either fixture is almost negligible.
The partial stoppage of the horizontal waste pipe between the fix-
ture trap and vent pipe will have a greater effect on the loss of trap
seal ’than individual or separate vents.
If the fixture has a separate
or individual vent, a partial stoppage in a long horizontal waste pipe
between the trap and its vent will be responsible for the loss ot the
trap seal.
That part of the minority report which concerns the relation be-
tween plumbing and sewer air needs no comment, as the committee
expressed its view fully in chapter
1, to which Mr. Spencer agreed.
In fact,
it should be noted that the minority report raised but one
controversial issue—the necessity of a separate vent for each trap.

APPENDIX B.—CORROSION OF METALS IN PLUMBING
SYSTEMS
[A memorandum prepared for the subcommittee on plumbing, by Prof. George C. Whipple]
The corrosion of metals is the greatest factor in shortening the life
of plumbing systems.
In
spite
of
its importance and
in
spite
of
innumerable investigations and a vast amount of scientific study the
phenomena are still imperfectly understood, but out of the researches
conducted by physical chemists and engineers definite theories which
appear to be sound are taking shape.
If these are substantiated
and further developed, they ought to he useful in many ways—in
improving the quality
of materials,
in helping
to choose the best
metals for a given service, and in making better plumbing designs to
avoid corrosive conditions.
It
is the purpose of this memorandum
to explain in as simple language as possible some of the newer theories
as to how corrosion takes place.
Chemistry
has
greatly
changed
in
recent
years,
and modern
scientific writers on the subject of corrosion employ terms which are
not well understood by those who studied chemistry a generation ago.
Only the fundamental conceptions
will be
described.
No attempt
will be made to discuss the great variety of conditions under which
corrosion takes place.
The following
is a
list of topics considered:
1. The rusting of pure iron in pure water.
2. The effect of nonferrous constituents of iron.
3. The effect of substances dissolved in water.
4. The corrosion of nonferrous metals.
5.
Corrosion of different metals in contact.
6. The corrosion of iron in
air.
1. THE RUSTING OF PURE IRON IN PURE WATER
Pure iron will rust in pure water exposed to the
air.
Water,
as
almost everyone knows,
is composed of the elements hydrogen and
oxygen chemically combined.
It used to be called H 20, but there
are advantages in regarding it as H.OH.
H. means an atom ofhydro-
gen, but if written H+ it means that the atom carries a charge of posi-
tive electricity and is called a hydrogen ion .
In the same way Oil"
stands for what
is called the hydroxyl ion, and the combination of
these two atoms carries a negative electrical charge.
When the two
ions join together, the positive and negative electrical charges neu-
tralize each other, and the result is a molecule of water, H.OH, which
is electrically inert.
But in water, even
if it be distilled and redis-
tilled, not all of the PI+ and OH- ions are united; some remain in the
water as free ions, which, because of their electrical charges, are in
such a state of motion that they exert a pressure against the walls of
the container, or against whatever is in the water, in a manner similar
to gas pressure.
This separation of the ions is known as dissociation.
228

APPENDIX B—CORROSION Of METALS
229
It has been learned that pure distilled water contains something
like
1 gram H+ in 10,000,000 liters of water; hence, the amount of H+
m pure water resulting from dissociation is 0.0001 part per million
by weight.
The number 10,000,000 may be written 10 7
; that is, 10
to the seventh power, 7 being the logarithm of 10,000,000.
It will be
noticed that the power .7
is equal to the number of ciphers.
Soren-
son,. the Swedish chemist,
first represented this hydrogen ion concen-
tration by the letters Hp (hydrogen potential), but now it is usually
written pH; hence, the pH value for pure distilled water
is
7.
The
hydroxyl ion concentration of pure water is also 7, but in matters of
corrosion we are not so much interested in this as we are in FH, be-
cause it is this little actively moving hydrogen ion which so aggres-
sively attacks metals.
Now, there may be hydrogen ions in water
derived from
other
sources,
so
that instead
of
1 gram
in every
10,000,000
liters
there may be one in 100,000
liters, or one in 10 5
;
that
is, pH = 5 instead
of
7.
The more H+ there
is the lower the
figure for pH.
Old time chemists used the words acid and alkaline very loosely.
The modern chemist
is more exact.
With him the “ hydrogen ion
concentration” stands for acidity and “ hydroxyl ion concentration”
stands for alkalinity.
Pure water has a pH value of 7 (the hydroxyl
ion concentration also being 7) and is neutral.
If the water contains
such substances that the pH is less than 7, the water is acid and the
lower the pH value the more acid it is.
If the pH value is above 7,
the water is alkaline and the higher the pH the greater the alkalinity.
The sum of the pH value and the pOH value is always 14.
If the
pH value is 5.5, the pOH value is 8.5.
Hence, modem chemists do
not use the expression pOH, but think of acidity and alkalinity both
in terms of pH, values lower than 7 indicating acidity, and values
higher indicating alkalinity.
It
will be noticed that water when
it dissociates does not yield
atoms of oxygen and hydrogen but hydroxyl (OH-
) and hydrogen
(H+
) ions.
When water is exposed to the air, it absorbs oxygen gas.
Most natural waters contain “ dissolved oxygen.”
Without it fish
could not breathe.
There are limits to the amounts of oxygen which
water can absorb.
Water is said to be saturated with oxygen when it
holds in solution all that it can hold at a given pressure and tempera-
ture.
The higher the temperature the less oxygen
it can hold in
solution and the higher the pressure the more it can hold.
Books on
water chemistry give the saturation values for different temperatures
and pressures.
Oxygen gas dissolved in water is invisible, but oxy-
gen gas may be present in excess of the saturation point, in which
case it may appear as little bubbles of gas.
The nitrogen of the air
dissolves in water in the same way but not to the same extent.
If
cold water saturated with air is warmed, air bubbles will be driven
out.
In a closed pipe or tank they may rise to the top as air.
Let us now consider the phenomena involved in the rusting of pure
iron in contact with pure water.
We have already been introduced
to the
chief actors in the play—water (H.OH), the hydrogen ion
(H+
), and oxygen gas (02).
Iron
itself
(called Fe, from
the. Latin
word ferrum) needs no introduction, but let it be. said that just as
the H+ has a pressure which pushes it against the iron, so Fe has a
solution pressure which makes it try to go into solution.

230
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
The action takes place as follows: Two aggressive little hydrogen
ions (H +
) move rapidly to the exposed metal and give their charges
to an atom of iron.
This latter enters the water as a double-charged
iron ion (Fe++
), while the hydrogen atoms, their charges lost, remain
on, or are “plated out” on, the iron in a “nascent”; that is, a very
active chemical
condition.
The hydrogen thus
plated out would
tend to protect the metal from further attacks of H+ were it not for
the fact that dissolved oxygen (O) steps in, unites with the two hydro-
gen atoms forming water (H.OH)
, and thus clears the metal for further
attacks.
Meantime the iron ion
(Fe++
)
unites with two hydroxyl
ions (OH-
) to form the insoluble ferrous hydrate Fe (OH) 2
.
As the
H+ attacks the iron, more water is dissociated, more H+ and OH- are
formed, and the corrosion proceeds.
If the water is not exposed to
the air and there is no other source of oxygen, the corrosion will stop
when the oxygen has been used up; but the oxygen does something
else.
It, together with a molecule of water, unites with the ferrous
hydrate, Fe (OH) 2 , to form ferric hydrate, Fe2 (OH) 3 , a more thor-
oughly oxidized condition of the iron.
It will be seen, therefore, that
the hydrogen ion and the dissolved oxygen are copartners in crime.
The hydrogen ion
is the
thief, the oxygen
is the receiver of stolen
goods.
It
is not far from the truth to say that the hydrogen ion
causes the corrosion, the oxygen causes the rusting.
If the water
has little or no motion, most of the rust remains on the iron, covering
it with a yellowish-brown (partly ferrous) or reddish-brown (nearly
all ferric) coat of rust.
If the water is in motion, some of the rust
may be distributed through the water.
There
is an intermediate
oxide, magnetic oxide of
iron, black in
color.
Different colors
of
iron rust are due to the different mixtures of these oxides as well as
to various enmeshed impurities.
2. THE EFFECT
OF NONFERROUS
CONSTITUENTS
IN THE IRON
In
the foregoing paragraph
it was
said
that
the hydrogen ion
was “plated out” on the iron, an expression often used in connection
with electric batteries.
It
is a fact generally known that
if strips
of copper and zinc are put into a slightly acid water—that
is, one
containing hydrogen ions—hydrogen ions
will “plate out” on the
copper and zinc will be eaten away, the hydroxyl ion acting chemically
on the zinc, forming zinc hydrate.
This movement of the electrical
charges of the ions sets up a “current” of electricity.
The metallic
elements may be arranged in a
series,
the higher in electromotive
properties at one end, the positive end, and the lower at the other,
or negative end.
If any two of the metals are put into water which
contains hydrogen ions, the latter will plate out on the metal lower
in the series, and the metal higher in the series will be corroded instead
of the other.
The following is a list of the metals in the electromotive
series.
The figures given in the last column are not very accurate,
and published lists do not agree exactly.

Note.—In the second column each cross after the chemical symbol stands for one “charge” of electricity
on the ion.
In the third column the + sign indicates that the solution is charged positively with respect to
the metal.
The potential of the hydrogen ion is taken as zero, and the potentials of the other metals are
referred to it.
If referred to the “ calomel electrode ” the potential of hydrogen would be— 0. 277 (though
—0.283 is, perhaps, more accurate)
.
The
higher
the
potential
the
higher
the
solution
pressure
of
the metal, and, in general, the greater the chemical activity.
Let us now suppose that there is a bit of zmc in the iron.
The
hydrogen ions will plate out on the iron instead of on the zinc, because
the zinc is higher m the series.
The zinc will be corroded and the
iron “protected.”
This explains why a “zinc fish” used to be put
into a boiler to prevent corrosion, why zinc bars are attached to the
iron gates of the Panama Canal locks, and why pipe
is galvanized
or otherwise coated with zinc.
But suppose that the foreign substance in the iron
is below iron
in the
series,
as,
for example, a
bit
of mill
scale.
This time the
hydrogen plates out on the scale and the iron corrodes.
Where such
an impurity exists the action is more localized than elsewhere and the
corrosion extends deeper into the metal; a pit may be found in place
of a more general corrosion.
Some kinds of organic matter also act
to produce local corrosion.
3. THE EFFECT OF SUBSTANCES DISSOLVED IN WATER
Pure water is not found in nature.
If water is exposed to the air,
it absorbs carbonic acid gas (C02).
This gas reacts with the water
itself, forming
carbonic
acid (HCO s)
and H+
,
the hydrogen
ion.
Therefore, when C02 is dissolved the hydrogen ion concentration is
increased; that is, the pH value is lessened.
This increased hydiogen
ion concentration means that the force of the hydrogen ion attack on
iron is increased.
Hence,
it
is said that C02 causes iron corrosion.
Just as before the H+ makes the attack, but this time the carbonic

232
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
acid (HCO~3)
seizes the iron ion (Fe++
) and ferrous bicarbonate
is
formed, a substance soluble in water.
In the absence of dissolved
oxygen this iron salt remains in solution, but oy^gen changes it to
iron rust.
Actually the chemistry of the process is somewhat more
complicated, but what has been said is typical of what usually occurs.
In the same way hydrochloric acid (II Cl) added to water increases
the hydrogen ion concentration and so do all acids.
In other words,
acids corrode iron because they yield H+ in water.
If the hydrogen
ion attack is very severe, hydrogen may be plated out so fast that it
leaves the iron as bubbles of gas without waiting for the depolarizing
action of dissolved oxygen.
In other words, very acid waters may
corrode iron badly even
if little or no dissolved oxygen
is present.
This condition is seldom an important one in natural waters.
If lime (CaO)
is added to water, the hydroxyl ions are increased,
the water is made alkaline, the hydrogen ions are decreased, (that is,
the pH value increased)
and the rusting action
is checked.
In a
general way, therefore, alkalies tend to check rusting.
If an acid salt, such as aluminum sulphate or magnesium chloride
(found in sea water),
is added to water it is dissociated and the hy-
drogen ion concentration
of
the water
increased.
Such
solutions
increase corrosion.
Natural waters usually contain great
varieties
of chemical sub-
stances in varying proportions.
There may be mineral and organic
substances which increase the hydrogen ion concentration ; there may
be substances which unite chemically with the iron.
The matter is one
of
great
complexity.
But from
the
standpoint
of
corrosion
the
complex factors reduce themselves to the hydrogen ion concentration,
the dissolved oxygen, the hydroxyl ion, and the solubility of the iron
compounds produced by their action.
It should be noted that both oxygen and carbonic acid are always
present in the atmosphere, that carbonic acid results from decom-
position of organic matter and from the exhalations of animals, and
that both
are lavishly
distributed
in nature.
Most public water
supplies are saturated with oxygen or nearly so, and the hydrogen
ion concentration is the critical factor in corrosion.
Thus soft waters
(pH values low)
are more corrosive than hard waters (pH values
high), colored waters containing organic
acids
are
corrosive,
salty
waters are very corrosive, well waters which derive C02 from the
ground air are corrosive.
On the other hand, oxygen
is sometimes
the critical factor.
If it is not present, rusting ceases ; as, for example,
in closed hot-water heating systems.
Of two waters which have the
same pH value one may be more corrosive than the other,
for, as
already stated, the dissolved mineral matter is an important factor,
but one which has not
yet been
sufficiently
studied.
From
the
standpoint
of water
analysis
the
corrosiveness
of water
involves
chiefly
the
determinations
of
alkalinity,
free C02 ,
the pH
value,
dissolved oxygen, and the mineral constituents.
In most waters the determination of “alkalinity” gives a measure
of
the carbonates and
bicarbonates
of
calcium
and
magnesium.
The test is commonly made and is fairly accurate.
The common test
for C02 is accurate in most cases, but sometimes far from accurate.
The
test for
dissolved oxygen
is
quite
accurate.
The pH
test
is
relatively new and fairly accurate.
It is not often made but is coming
into use.

APPENDIX B
CORROSION OF METALS
233
4 . VARIOUS
CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE CORROSION
OF IRON
In general, heat increases the rate of corrosion of iron, because with
higher temperatures H+
is formed more rapidly and because the dif-
fusion of oxygen in the water is increased.
On the other hand, heating
water drives air (both oxygen and nitrogen) out of solution.
In hot
water oxidation of ferrous iron takes place more rapidly.
Rusty hot
water, sometimes called the red water plague, is due to the corrosion
of pipes.
It is most likely to occur in soft waters, especially if colored
or alum treated.
It seldom occurs with hard waters, even though iron
pipes be used for water distribution.
An increased flow of water in a pipe increases rusting, provided there
is a sufficiency
of H+
,
because it brings larger volumes of dissolved
oxygen into contact with the iron.
It follows from this that small
pipes will corrode and become filled with rust more rapidly than large
pipes.
This is an argument for the liberal sizing of iron pipes in a
plumbing
system.
Low velocities which
allow the
water
to flow
quietly in parallel lines cause less rusting than higher velocities which
give a more turbulent flow, bring more oxygen in contact with the
sides of the pipe, and wash off the rust which is formed.
If metallic iron is fully protected from the water, corrosion will not
occur.
Coating an iron pipe with coal tar, asphalt, or similar prep-
arations is intended to do this and does so fairly well.
In cast iron
the
crystals
of metallic iron
are bound
together by graphite and
cementite,
which largely
prevents rusting.
In
“genuine wrought
iron”
the
crystals
of iron
are protected somewhat better than
in
steel, and hence the corrosion on the whole is less, but this is by no
means always the case.
Some steels resist corrosion better than some
genuine wrought irons, and the difference is probably not as great as
is commonly thought.
Service pipes are often protected from corrosion by lining them with
cement.
This acts in two ways—first, by keeping the water away
from the metal; second, by reducing the hydrogen ions which reach
the metal,
the cement being
alkaline.
It
is an
excellent method,
deserving further development.
Uniformity in the structure of the metal makes for uniformity in
corrosion.
Impurities in the metal tend toward localized corrosion,
that is, pitting.
Cast iron seldom pits.
Genuine wrought iron and
steel both pit.
The removal of mill scale from steel reduces pitting.
Pitting is worse than uniform rusting, because it causes leaks in pipes
or holes in sheet iron.
Going back to the explanation
of corrosion and rusting,
let us
consider what happens
to the rust formed.
If the movement
of
water
is rapid and turbulent, the iron rust may be carried along
with the water and, perhaps,
deposited, somewhere.
If the move-
ment of the water is gentle, it may remain near the point of forma-
tion and form a sort
of film or membrane.
This membrane
acts
as a sort of sieve.
It allows the hydrogen ions and gases to pass
through but holds back iron rust.
Consequently, iron rust accumu-
lates back of the film.
If a piece of iron pipe is placed in a trough
through which water is slowly flowing,
this film forms quickly and
attains considerable size.
It forms in the inside of a pipe
as well
as on the
outside.
It may be
easily ruptured by increasing
the
flow
of water beyond
the
critical
velocity—that
is,
beyond
the

234
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
point when flow in straight lines
is changed
to
a turbulent
flow.
Even where the flow
is rapid the film may form, but in this case
it holds close to the pipe or is localized.
Iron rust deposited back
of such film accmnulates in “ tubercles.”
After a time the “film”
becomes a substantial deposit of iron, but apparently continues to
act as a sieve, letting aggressive hydrogen ions, oxygen, and water
pass to the iron pipe, but holding back the oxide of iron formed.
If water contains organic matter,
it may be deposited on this film
or precipitated by the sticky iron oxide on the walls of the pipe,
in either case tending to build up and hold together the deposit of
iron oxide.
The bacterial decomposition of organic matter yields
H+
,
and
hence
tends
to increase corrosion.
Animal forms, such
as the fresh-water sponge or pipe moss found in large water mains,
also give off C02
.
It is a well-known fact that the raw water pipes
of a nitration plant become more tuberculated than the pipes carry-
ing filtered water, because in the latter case the pipes contain less
organic matter and no pipe moss.
On the other hand, some deposits
are thought to protect the metal against the action of the water.
5. THE CORROSION OF NQNFERROXJ3 METALS IN WATER
The principal nonferrous metals used by themselves in plumbing
systems are lead, zinc, tin, and copper, and they are obtainable in a
fairly pure
state,
while
commercial
iron
always
contains
foreign
substances.
In
general,
it may be
said
that
pure
metals
resist
corrosion better than two or more different metals mixed or alloyed
or in contact with each
other.
Reference
to
the potential
series
will show that zinc, lead, tin, and iron are higher in the series than
hydrogen.
Their solution pressures are higher and they are more
susceptible to attack by the hydrogen iron.
Copper, on the other
hand,
is lower in the
series than hydrogen and than most
cf the
other
metals
used
in
plumbing
work.
Consequently,
it
is
not
attacked by the hydrogen ion under ordinary conditions.
Oxygen
is lower in the series than copper and therefore may attack it.
Inas-
much, however, as the copper oxide found
is insoluble in water,
it
will protect the metal against further action unless
it
is physically
removed or dissolved by some acid or ammonia.
The atmosphere
of a city usually contains carbonic acid and sulphurous or sulphuric
acid.
These are absorbed by the rain and may thus play a part in
the corrosion of copper roofing.
When copper is used in connection
with urinals, the ammonia will dissolve the copper oxide, exposing
the metal to further oxygen attack and thus contribute to its corro-
sion.
In the same way the ammonia resulting from the droppings
of pigeons and other birds on roofs may contribute to the corrosion
of sheet copper.
It
is a well-known fact that copper
is corroded
readily when ammonia is present.
It will be noticed that zinc and
iron are much higher in the potential series than tin and lead.
The
solution pressure of zinc and iron greatly overbalances the osmotic
pressure of their ions, a fact which adds to the facility with which
they are corroded; but there is another factor which has an impor-
tant influence on corrosion, namely, the solubility of the substances
produced by corrosion.
If the resulting salt
is not readily soluble
in water, it is likely to be deposited upon the metal and will protect
it against further corrosion, while
if the resulting salt is soluble in
water it will not be so deposited and the metal will be exposed to

APPENDIX B—CORROSION OF METALS
235
new attacks by the corroding forces.
A few examples may serve to
make this clear.
When pure iron
is put into water which contains
free carbonic
acid gas but no dissolved oxygen, ferrous bicarbonate is formed and
this
is soluble in water.
This action may take place when an iron
pipe
carries well water rich in C02 but poor in dissolved oxygen.
If oxygen
is
present
in
the
water,
the
ferrous carbonate
will be
oxidized to ferric hydrate (iron rust) and in so far as it deposits on
the metal it tends to protect against corrosion.
If the acid
is hydrochloric instead of carbonic, ferrous chloride
is
formed and that, too,
is soluble
; and in the same way sulphuric acid
may act on iron and form ferrous sulphate,
also
soluble.
But in
the case
of
tin in water containing C02 the
situation
is
different.
There
is no bicarbonate or even carbonate of tin formed.
Any tin
salts formed are relatively insoluble.
This is one of the reasons why
block
tin
is
so commonly used
in soda-water fountains
to
carry
water highly charged with carbonic acid.
The action
of
different waters on lead may be explained along
these
lines.
In soft waters, and especially soft colored waters, the
hydrogen ion content
is large
(that
is, pH
is
well below
7).
Lead
pipes exposed to such waters are attacked with the formation of lead
carbonate which
is quite soluble.
The result
is that the metal
is
left bare for further attacks, while the water containing the dissolved
lead may cause lead poisoning
if used for drinking.
This
is why
soft well waters high m C02 and poor in oxygen ought not to be
conveyed through lead
pipes.
If, however,
the water has
a high
alkalinity
(high temporary hardness)
and
little carbonic
acid,
the
hydrogen ion content will be relatively low and the attack on the
lead will also be low.
Under these conditions a basic lead carbonate
will be formed by the oxygen present.
As this substance is insoluble,
it tends
to coat
the walls
oi
the pipe and protect the lead from
further corrosion.
In such waters there may be deposits of calcium
carbonate which add
to the protection.
To some extent
silicates
in the water protect lead and also iron against corrosion.
Another example
is worth
mentioning
because
of
its
frequent
occurrence.
When
soft waters
are
treated with
alum,
as
in
the
process known
as mechanical
filtration and sometimes even with
slow sand
filtration,
their corrosive action on the seams of water-
closet tanks has often been noticed.
The addition of alum to water
changes
calcium
carbonate,
an
alkaline
salt,
to
calcium sulphate
and also produces carbonic
acid.
The hydrogen ion concentration
is therefore increased
(the pH value lowered) unless some alkali
is
also
added.
The
soldered
joints
of
copper-lined
tanks
are
thus
likely to be more seriously attacked than by the same water without
alum treatment, zinc by virtue of its position in the potential series
being dissolved.
Zinc sulphate
is more soluble in water than zinc
carbonate.
If the latter
is formed,
as may be the case when the
calcium carbonate
in the water
is very large in proportion to the
calcium
sulphate,
it
will not readily dissolve but remains on
the
zinc as a protective coating.
If, however, the calcium sulphate
is
large in proportion to the calcium carbonate, there would appear to
be
a greater tendency for zinc sulphate
to be formed, which will
dissolve
in
the water,
leaving
the metal
free
for further galvanic
action.

236
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
It is evident, therefore, that corrosion depends not only upon the
hydrogen ion alone, although that is the attacking agent, nor upon
the hydrogen ion and dissolved oxygen together, but also upon the
nature of the various acids, bases, and salts which may be present
in water in varying proportions.
No wonder,
then, that different
waters
act
differently
upon
different
metals!
No
wonder
that
experiments are conflicting!
No wonder that plumbers are confused
in regard
to
a
subject upon which even
chemists
themselves
are
confused
!
6. THE CORROSION OF DIFFERENT METALS IN CONTACT
It has already been explained that a bit of zinc in contact with
iron will cause the hydrogen to be plated out on the iron, the zinc
to be corroded, and the iron protected.
In general, it may be said
that when any two metals are in contact in water containing hydrogen
ions, the one higher in the series will be the most corroded, while
the one lower in the series will be protected.
Thus zinc protects
iron in a galvanized pipe, the zinc itself corroding.
Thus also iron
protects lead in a lead-lined pipe,
the iron
itself
corroding.
Iron
protects
tin;
tin
protects
copper,
the
tin
itself not
being much
corroded, however, because the resulting salts of tin are rtdatively
insoluble.
Even in such an alloy as brass the zinc protects the copper
and the larger the proportion
of zinc
the more
the brass
(really
the zinc in the brass) is corroded.
Another important principle
is that
a metal
in the presence
of
water
containing hydrogen
ions
will
corrode more
rapidly
if
in
contact with a metal lower in the series than if present in the water
alone.
Thus, zinc will corrode more rapidly if in contact with iron;
iron
will
corrode more rapidly
if
in contact with
lead;
zinc
will
corrode more rapidly
if in contact with solder
(tin and lead) than
if present
alone.
It
is
for
these
reasons
that
joints
of
different
metals are especially liable to be corroded.
When two metals are
thus brought into contact in acid water (one containing hydrogen
ions in excess
of hydroxyl ions), the
exchange
of electric charges
of the ions causes an electric
11 current” (called m this case a galvanic
current), and it is sometimes said that the corrosion is due to gal-
vanic action,
a satisfactory explanation if one understands how the
galvanic action results from the potential differences of the elements
in the series.
A few examples
of
this “ galvanic corrosion” may be
cited.
In
the case of a galvanized steel pipe, the protection of the iron would
be excellent
if the zinc coating were perfect and
entire.
Actually
it is not perfect.
For one reason or another the iron is exposed and
a contact of zinc and iron in water results.
The zinc dissolves and
iron is left bare, and then corrodes as
it would do
if no zinc were
present.
Galvanized pipes often have to be cut and threaded, and
where the cut
is made the iron
is laid bare.
Water
is carried by
capillarity into the threaded
joint, a couple results, and corrosion
proceeds rapidly.
Tin plate, such as that used for roofing,
is
iron coated with
tin.
If the tin is removed at some spot the iron will rust faster than if it
had not been tinned.
If iron pipe is lined with lead and if a pinhole
exists in the lead
coating, water may come in contact with both
metals, and
if the water has a low pH value the
iron will suffer a
rapid
local
corrosion and a hole in the pipe may
result.
Similar

APPENDIX B
CORROSION OF METALS
237
corrosion is likely to occur at the joints where it is difficult to secure
a continuity of lead lining.
A brass coupling or a brass faucet attached to a piece of iron pipe
tends to increase the corrosion of the iron, and the effect is not limited
to the point of contact but may extend to a considerable distance
from the joint.
In the case of brass piping, the fittings are of different
composition from that
of the pipe
itself; hence,
brass piping not
infrequently gives out at the joints.
It must not be forgotten that in most cases of galvanic corrosion
the action is greater in waters having a high hydrogen ion concen-
tration (a low value of pH)
.
Thus, a water which has had its hydro-
gen ion concentration increased by the use
of alum
(sulphate
of
alumina)
in connection with filtration may cause more severe cases
of galvanic corrosion than the same water before
filtration.
The
addition of liquid chlorine to water also tends to increase the hydrogen
ion concentration and hence to increase the galvanic corrosion, but
the quantity of chlorine added is usually very small.
7. THE CORROSION OF IRON IN AIR
Thus far only corrosion in water has been discussed.
It remains
to consider the corrosion of metals in air, and as before iron may be
considered first.
In perfectly dry air iron does not rust at all.
Water is necessary.
Air usually contains moisture, sometimes only a
little, sometimes
enough
to saturate
or supersaturate
it.
Clean iron exposed
to a
film
of moisture rusts
rapidly.
An
excellent example
is the rust
which appears on a bright iron rail of a railroad track a few hours
after a shower.
The principles of rusting are the same as before, a
corrosive attack by
and an oxidation by oxygen.
Be it remem-
bered that the air contains C02 and oxygen, that C02 is very soluble,
and that a thin film of water may dissolve oxygen from the air and
(although
the rate
of
diffusion
of oxygen
in water
is very
slow)
transmit
it quicldy
to
the metal because the film
is
thin.
Thus,
although the C0 2 and oxygen in a drop of water may be small, the
drop may easily replenish its supply, if used up, from the atmosphere.
In a soil or drain-pipe deposits of organic matter decompose with
the formation of C02 , and this may be dissolved by a film of water
or drops of water attached to the pipe.
Sulphur compounds may
also
dissolve in drops and
films
of water on the interior
of drain
pipes.
Acid
substances
in
the sewage
or water
discharged may
increase the hydrogen ion concentration of the water which remains
attached to the walls of the pipe.
On the other hand, soap and grease
deposits may be alkaline and may protect against corrosion both
mechanically and chemically.
In horizontal waste pipes that are infrequent^ used drops of water
often collect near the top of the pipe, absorb C02 from the drain air,
and cause vigorous corrosion in the upper half of the cross section.
If the drains are used frequently and are fully flushed, the collected
drops of water, rich in C02 , will be replaced by other drops lower in
C02 , and rusting will be less rapid.
When rust
is once formed,
its.
porosity causes
it to absorb moisture, so that rust on the interior of
drains is usually moist.
Vertical
soil or drain stacks corrode less rapidly than horizontal
drains because moisture is less likely to collect upon them.
Deposits;
of grease upon the inner walls of soil pipes tend to protect them from

238
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
corrosion by mechanically preventing water from reaching the metal.
Yet grease on decomposition yields organic
acids, which like other
acids furnish hydrogen ions; and if, for any reason, the metal becomes
exposed,
these hydrogen
ions
will
attack
it.
Vent
pipes
are not
protected in this way hy grease deposits, and should small amounts
of grease reach them by
accident
corrosion would be stimulated
instead
of being prevented.
A small amount
of grease may do
a
great amount of damage.
The
air of cities contains more C0 2 than the
air of the country.
City
air also contains sulphurous acid gas (S02) from the burning
coal, and
it seems probable that the use of
oil instead of coal will
increase this still further.
Mexican
oil, at any rate, contains much
more sulphur than most of the American oils.
Air near the seacoast
contains more salt than air farther inland, and so does rain near the
seacoast.
The air of a seacoast city may be, therefore, much more
corrosive than that of an inland rural district.
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The above statement of the scientific theory of corrosion is by no
means complete, no reference whatever being made to colloids and
surface phenomena; but even as
it stands it might be regarded as
too technical if it did not lead to certain practical results, which may
be stated as follows from the plumber’s standpoint
:
1. The plumber ordinarily has to take a public water supply as it
is and adjust his choice of materials to
it.
In doing so, he should
remember that
:
(a) Acid waters are more corrosive than alkaline waters.
The pH
value of a water is a measure of its acidity.
If less than 7.0, the
water is acid;
if more than 7.0,
it is alkaline.
Colored waters con-
tain organic acids and usually carbonic acid.
(b)
Soft waters are more corrosive than hard waters.
Waters on
the Atlantic seacoast are generally softer and more corrosive than
the 'waters of the middle States.
(c) Well waters are usually harder than surface waters of the same
region, but they often contain carbonic acid.
The corrosive powers
of well waters differ.
If they are relatively soft and contain much
carbonic acid, they may attack iron or lead vigorously; but if they
are hard and the carbonic acid is low, the action may be slight or
negligible.
If high in silicates, corrosion may be slight.
(d)
There are two types of hardness in water—carbonate hardness
and sulphate hardness.
The former tends
to protect metal pipes
from corrosion, the latter does not.
( e ) A water analysis is required to tell in advance whether or not
a water is corrosive.
To-day the waters of most cities are analyzed
by State departments of health, but the analyses are made princi-
pally from a health point of view and do not always include the data
necessary to determine corrosiveness.
(j0 The rusting of iron by water requires both an acid and
dis-
solved oxygen.
Most public water supplies are saturated with oxygen
and need the oxygen in order to be palatable.
2. The plumber should know the
effect on the corrosiveness
of
water of certain processes commonly used for water purification.
(a) Aeration tends to remove carbonic acid, and thus reduces the
corrosiveness
of water.
On the other hand,
it
assures saturation
with oxygen, and if acids are present rusting will occur.

APPENDIX B
CORROSION OF METALS
239
(b) The addition of whiting or lime neutralizes the carbonic acid
and reduces the corrosiveness of water.
(c)
Softening water does not increase corrosiveness.
Softening is
never used unless the water is excessively hard.
id) The use of alum in connection with filtration tends to increase
corrosiveness.
There are ways to counteract
this
to some extent,
but they are not always employed.
(e) The use of liquid chlorine as a disinfectant tends to increase
the corrosiveness of water, but the effect is usually unappreciable.
if) The process
of
“ deactivation” removes oxygen from water.
It tends to prevent rusting and corrosion.
The addition of sodium
silicate
to hot water
is said
to prevent the corrosion
of pipes by
forming a film on the metal which prevents the attack of the hydrogen
ions.
3. Where the water
is soft and contains much carbonic acid, or
where for other reasons the water is corrosive, the choice of metals
is important.
id) For service pipes lead should be avoided because of the danger
of lead poisoning
1
;
iron
or
steel should be galvanized
or, what
is
better, protected by an inner cement lining.
(b)
Iron or
steel pipe used for distribution in the house should
be galvanized and made of ample size to allow for rusting.
Lead
should not be used.
(c)
Brass
pipe
used
for
hot-water
distribution
should
contain
at least 67 per cent of copper.
If it contains too large a percentage
of zinc, this metal is likely to be corroded in spots and at the joints,
causing the pipe
to leak.
As brass pipe does not clog with rust,
smaller sizes may be used than with iron or steel.
(d)
Cast-iron water backs rust badly, produce “red water,” and
may become clogged.
( e)
Cast iron serves better for the drainage system than wrought
iron or steel.
4. Where the water is hard, the choice of metal is less important
and may depend upon
other
factors than
corrosion.
Even with
hard water cast iron serves best for drainage systems because of the
development of corrosive gases in the pipes.
5. In any water, but especially in soft corrosive water, two metals
when in contact are likely to be affected by galvanic action.
The
metals are attacked in a definite order—zinc before iron, iron before
lead, lead before copper.
id) A brass which
contains much zinc corrodes more than one
which contains
less.
Bronze corrodes
less than brass, and copper
corrodes less than bronze.
(b)
Soldered
seams
in
water-closet
tanks
are
corroded by
an
acid water.
This is often noticed in an alum-treated water.
Cover-
ing the seams with a wash or paste
of
tar or asphalt mixed with
cement should prove beneficial.
1 The committee, after careful consideration, learns that danger from lead poisoning generally exists only
in cases where the water is soft and is charged with “aggressive” carbon dioxide.
The present tendency
is to free municipal water supplies of “aggressive” carbon dioxide, and where this is accomplished there is
little danger from lead poisoning.

APPENDIX C.—A STUDY OF AIR CURRENTS IN A HORI-
ZONTAL WASTE PIPE
By Warren
E. Howland
This memorandum
covers
a
series
of experiments made
in the
laboratory
of
the department
of
sanitary engineering
of Harvard
University as a part of a study of conditions which affect the corrosion
of metals used in plumbing systems.
It relates to the movements of
air and gases in unvented horizontal waste pipes; that is, horizontal
waste pipes connected with a vertical stack at one end and having a
trap (or a plug) #at the other end.
Four kinds of air movement may
occur in an unvented horizontal waste pipe.
They are
:
1. Eddy currents induced by an upward draft in the vertical stack
to which the horizontal waste pipe is connected or by down rushes
of water in the stack.
2. Movements due to diffusion.
3.
Convection currents in the pipe itself; that is, movements of the
air due to temperature differences.
4. Displacement
of the
air in the pipe by the discharge
of the
fixture connected with it.
.
The experiments were not carried
to such a point that
definite
quantitative conclusions can be drawn, but the following inferences
appear to the writer to be sound:
.
.
1.
Movements of air in the stack induce eddy currents of air m the
horizontal waste pipe for only a short distance from the stack, say,
for
1 or 2 feet.
.
,
2.
Diffusion is the most important factor in causing gases to spread
through or from the horizontal pipe.
If gases, such as carbonic acid
gas or sulphuretted jryffrogen, are formed in a horizontal run, they
will become more concentrated in a long pipe than m a short pipe, the
maximum concentration varying approximately as the square of the
length of the pipe.
In other words, gas will leave a short pipe more
quickly than a long pipe.
On the other hand, oxygen from the stack
will diffuse into a long pipe with more difficulty than into a short
pipe.
These statements are true regardless of the diameter of the
^

currents,
caused by
temperature
likely to be present throughout the whole length of the horizontal
waste pipe, but such currents are of small magnitude.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
When the writer began his experiments in February, 1923, Dana E.
Kepner, then assistant in sanitary engineering in Harvard University,
had already done considerable work on the problem and had erected
an experimental equipment which, with some
additions, was used
throughout
the experiments.
Early attempts
to study
air move-
ments by the use
of sulphuretted hydrogen having proved unsuc-
cessful, a method involving the absorption of carbonic acid from the
air b}^ solutions of lime water located at different places in the pipes
was tried with good results.
This method, together with the evapo-
ration of water, formed the basis of the experiments described below.
Free use has been made of a report submitted by Mr. Kepner to Prof.
George C. Whipple, to both of whom acknowledgments are made.
DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS
The first pipe used was of steel,
inches in diameter and 25 feet
long, closed at one end and connected at the other end by means of
Fig. 100.—Arrangement of piping for the study of air currents in horizontal waste pipes
a sanitary tee with a 3-inch stack,
11 feet high.
It had a slope of
one-fourth inch to the foot.
Crosses were placed at a point 1| feet
from the vertical stack and thereafter
at intervals of 3 feet to the
closed end.
At
first glass plates were placed over the ends of the
crosses and silk threads suspended in such a way that any large move-
ments
of
air could be
detected.
All
results were negative.
The
glass
plates
at
the
tops
of
the crosses were,
therefore, removed,
corks put in and sealed with paraffin.
Screwed plugs were placed at
the bottom of the crosses, so that glass cups of solutions could be
inserted.
Figure 100 shows this arrangement.
Afterwards two addi-
tional horizontal pipes, one 1J inches and one 2 inches in diameter and
26 feet long, were set up on either side of the original apparatus with
crosses at intervals of 3 feet.
These pipes were connected to separate
stacks 11 feet long.

APPENDIX C
AIR CURRENTS IN WASTE PIPES
243
EDDY CURRENTS
The rapid movement of air up the vertical stack produced eddy
currents for a short distance in the horizontal laterals.
A glass tube
1 inch in diameter was placed in a nearly horizontal position, sloping
one-fourth inch to the foot, closed at the outer end and connected
with a 2-inch vertical stack.
When
air was moving up the stack,
movements
could
be
detected by
observing
untwisted
fine
silk
threads suspended from the top of the interior of the glass tube at
distances not exceeding 7 inches from the vertical stack.
Probably,
however, very slight movements of air extended farther in the pipe
than could be detected with the eye.
This same apparatus was used for experiments with hydrogen sul-
phide.
Into the outer end was inserted a small porcelain boat
of
hydrochloric acid in which iron sulphide was dissolving and giving
off hydrogen sulphide.
The tube was quickly stoppered.
A draft
was maintained in the vertical stack.
‘At the end
of
15 minutes
moist lead acetate paper previously placed in the open end of the
pipe was examined for the metallic luster of lead sulphide.
A similar
experiment was carried on simultaneously with another glass tube,
the open end
of which was not exposed to
a
draft.
The results
showed that the draft in the stack hastened diffusion of the hydrogen
sulphide to the open end, but the difference between the two was not
great.
Indication of the presence of eddy currents was also given by the
evaporation of drops of water placed in rows on the interior of steel
pipes and glass tubes.
Two horizontal glass tubes closed at one end
were filled with water and then emptied, leaving the interior wall
covered with drops.
Over the end of one of these pipes a strong
draft of air was allowed to play.
At the end of 24 hours the drops
near the open end of the pipe and to a distance of 17 inches from the
end had evaporated.
In the other pipe, over which no draft had
been allowed
to play,
the drops had disappeared
to a distance
of
10 inches.
This experiment was repeated with a 2-inch steel pipe, closed at
one end with a water-sealed trap and connected to a 4-mch stack at
the other end.
A draft of 280 feet per minute was maintained in the
vertical stack.
After 67 hours the drops in the horizontal pipe had
evaporated to a distance of 18 inches from the stack.
In another
pipe similarly placed, but with no draft maintained in the vertical
stack, the drops had disappeared to a distance of 17 inches from the
stack.
In this case not only was the pipe wet with drops of water,
but there was considerable water adhering to the rust particles on
the walls, as shown by their moist feeling when touched with the
finger.
It may be concluded, therefore, that no appreciable drying
of the interior of the pipe took place beyond a distance of 2 feet when
the pipe was wet as often as once in 24 hours.
Experiments were made to discover whether or not minute par-
ticles in the air moving in the vertical stack would enter into the
horizontal branch and thus give evidence of
air currents.
Smoke
from smoky flames and smoke
of ammonium
chloride were
used
both hot and
cold.
Particles
of dust were
also used and culture
plates for the detection of bacteria and molds were placed at intervals
in the horizontal branch.
In the following case only was the presence

244
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
of particles which had come from the air in the vertical stack detected
in
the horizontal
pipe.
Smoke from
a smoky flame was
allowed
to pass up the vertical stack for 24 hours.
At the end of that time
white papers previously placed on the bottoms of the crosses as shown
on the before-mentioned sketch appeared as follows:
Paper in cross:
1? feet from vertical stack
100 per cent black.
3 feet from vertical stack
75 per cent black.
6 feet from vertical stack
Trace of black.
All others
No trace of black.
This
effect was undoubtedly due to
the convection currents
set
up by the higher temperature of the ascending gases, which, being
lighter than the air in the horizontal pipe, tended to rise to the top
of the horizontal pipe and flow toward the dead end, depositing its
smoke on the way.
This condition would not,
of course,
exist in
actual plumbing systems.
It seems probable, therefore, that ^ddy currents are not present in
the horizontal pipe beyond a distance of about 2 feet from the vertical
stack.
Such currents may cause a relatively complete displacement
of air in the first
1 £ feet of the pipe.
This has the effect of reducing
by this amount that portion of the pipe within which diffusion and
convection are the chief causes of the movement of gases.
Downrushes of water in the stack will produce suction or pressure
of the air in the horizontal pipe.
The effect will be a movement of the
contained air, due to its change in volume and to the yielding of the
trap.
Assuming that the drainage system
is so designed that the
trap will not lose its seal, then the distance from the vertical stack
within which displacement mil take place may be expressed by the
following formula
:

It has been computed that in the case of a horizontal pipe 15 feet
long and with a 2-inch yield of the water in the trap only 3 horizontal
inches of air might be changed.
Larger movements of water in the
trap and longer Horizontal runs might give proportionally larger dis-
placements.
This effect does not extend as far as the eddy currents
before considered and
is so small and infrequent that it may be en-
tirely neglected.
DIFFUSION
Early experiments showed that diffusion is by far the most impor-
tant factor in accounting for the movement of gases in horizontal
branches.
The gases absorbed at various points in the horizontal
pipes were measured as described beyond.
It was found that drafts
in the vertical stack had very little to do with this absorption.
For
example, the placing of a fine wire screen at the end of the horizontal
pipe where it entered the vertical stack checked the eddy current but
did not prevent the absorption of gases by the various solutions placed
at intervals along the
pipe.
Other experiments confirmed the im-
portance of diffusion.
Thirty-two experiments depending upon the absorption of carbon
dioxide—that
is, carbonic acid gas—by water and five experiments
depending upon the evaporation of water were made.
Only a few of

APPENDIX C—AIR CURRENTS IN WASTE PIPES
245
these experiments will be here reported.
Following them the results
of a mathematical analysis of the problem is given, but the computa-
tions themselves, being somewhat involved, will be omitted.
CARBON DIOXIDE EXPERIMENTS
Small
cups, each containing
10 cubic centimeters
of limewater,
were placed at the crosses in the horizontal pipe, as shown by Figure
100.
The absorption of carbon dioxide by these solutions was deter-
mined chemically.
Allowance was made for the carbon dioxide orig-
inally present in the
air.
. The diagrams
(figs. 101 to 104, and 107)
show at each cross in the pipe the amounts of sulphuric acid which was
found by experiment to be equivalent to the carbon dioxide reaching
that point through the stack from the outside air.
The amount of
carbon dioxide absorbed at each joint as shown is a measure of the
concentration of the gas at that point.
The diagrams, therefore, show
the variation in concentration of carbon dioxide throughout the pipe.
The concentration of gases coming into the pipe diminishes rapidly
on the way back from the open end and finally reaches a point beyond
which further change in concentration is not noticeable.
This limit
of the noticeable effect of diffusion extends not much farther with a
higher concentration of gas in the vertical stack than with a lower
concentration.
In experiment A
(fig. 101) the air in the stack con-
tained 7.6 parts per 10,000 of carbon dioxide.
Absorption of this gas
by the limewater in the cups was noticeable for 9 feet in the pipe.
In
experiment B
(fig.
102), the air in the vertical stack contained 5.8
parts per 10,000 of carbon dioxide and the absorption was noticeable
for about the same distance.
In other experiments with li-inch,
1 J-
inch, and 2-inch pipes the distance within which absorption took
place varied from 3 to 9 feet and averaged about 6 feet.
There was no
consistent relation between this distance and the diameter of the pipe.
The time allowed for absorption made very little difference with
the shape of the curve.
It increased the absorption within the limits
of diffusion but did not increase the limits themselves.
This is shown
by experiments A and C.
The former had a duration of 20J hours
and the latter 44 hours, all the other conditions being practically the
same, yet the results were almost identical as to the distance within
which diffusion took place.
In order to show that diffusion was more active in the 6
(3 to 9)
feet near the stack than
at greater distances, an experiment was
made (experiment D) in which the absorbing solutions near the stack
(at a and b) were omitted.
Comparison was made with experiment
E (fig. 104) in which these cups were retained, other conditions remain-
ing the same.
If the absorption in cups c and d of experiment D had
given results like those of cups a and b of experiment E, the conclusion
would have disproved what has been said above.
It will be observed,
however, that they did not do this, a fact which supports the conten-
tion that diffusion is limited to the distances mentioned.
Not content with the simple experiments above mentioned, even
though they corroborated each other in a general way, a mathematical
analysis of the problem of diffusion in a closed pipe was made and its
results compared with those of the experiments.
This comparison
may be seen on the diagram which gives the results of experiment C.
The agreement was striking and furnished additional proof of the
correctness of the deductions from the experiments.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
A formula was set up showing the variation of the concentration of
carbon dioxide throughout the pipe for a particular set of conditions.
x = distance from the closed end of the pipe.
K= diffusion constant for the gas in question.
A = area of cross section of the pipe.
Q = a constant expressing the rate of absorption of the gas.
C= concentration of the gas at any point.
C0 = concentration of the gas at the point where x equals zero.
There
are two
principal ways
in which
the length
of
the pipe
affects the concentration of the gas in the pipe.
In the case of a
gas produced uniformly throughout the length of the pipe, the greater
the length of the pipe the greater will be the concentration of the
gas throughout the whole pipe.
For any given pipe, whether absorb-
ing
or emitting a
gas,
the extent
to which
diffusion
will equalize
the concentration within and without the pipe is much greater in the
section of the pipe near the open end than in other parts of the pipe.
For any particular case there is a limit beyond which diffusion can
not be
relied upon
to remove appreciable amounts
of an evolved
gas or to convey into the pipe appreciable amounts of gases from the
stack.
The factors which determine the concentration of gases in a
horizontal pipe and which,
therefore,
will determine
the
limit
of
diffusion are the following:
1. Length of the pipe.
2. Ratio of the rate of evolution (or absorption) of the gas in the
pipe to the cross-sectional area.
3. The diffusion coefficient of the gas.
4. The concentration of the gas in the air of the stack.
The diffusion will depend largely upon the length of the pipe and
the ratio of the evolution of the gas in the pipe to the area of cross
section; that is, to the first two items mentioned above.
The experi-
ments made were confined to a particular value of this ratio; that is,
the absorption of carbon dioxide by limewater in a cup
of
definite
size.
If larger cups had been used, the
limit of
absorption would
theoretically have been
less
than was
observed;
if
smaller
cups
had been used,
it would have been larger.
If the ratio referred to
could be actually determined in any
case, an exact limit could be
computed;
and
if
further experiments
are made,
they should be
devoted
to
a study
of
this
ratio
of gas
evolution
(or absorption)
to the cross section of the pipe.
Theory and experiment, therefore, agree in showing that diffusion
is the really important element in the movement of gases in a long,
horizontal pipe closed at one end.
Theory also shows that if a gas
such as carbon dioxide is produced uniformly along the pipe, as may
be the case when deposits of organic matter decompose, the maximum
concentration of this gas in the pipe will vary as the square of the
length of the pipe; that is to say, in a pipe 20 feet long the maximum
concentration will be four times as great as in a pipe 10 feet long,
if the short length near the stack wherever eddy currents occur be
neglected.

249
APPENDIX C
AIR CURRENTS IN WASTE PIPES
EVAPORATION OF WATER
The same cups that were used in the previous experiments were
filled with
10
cubic
centimeters
of
distilled water and exposed
to
the
air
of
the
pipe
as
before.
The cups
of water were weighed
before and
after exposure and
the
loss in weight,
or evaporation,
recorded.
Experiments F
and G
(figs.
105
and
106)
represent
typical results obtained by this method.
Calculations revealed the fact that more water was evaporated
from the cups than the air in the pipe was able to retain in the form
of vapor.
Either the moisture must, therefore, have been removed
from the air or the air itself must have been replaced by fresh
air.
According
to
the. other experiment made,
it seems
unlikely
that
the
air
_ of
the
pipe
could have
been
thus
replaced.
Moreover,
calculations showed that diffusion could not have removed as much
water vapor as was produced.
It
is probable,
therefore, that the
rust on the interior of the pipes absorbed some of the moisture from
the
air after being evaporated from the cups.
The absorption of
moisture by the rust on the pipe would explain the absence of a
critical distance from the stack within which diffusion occurred.
CONVECTION CURRENTS
Under certain conditions temperature differences will cause con-
vection currents in horizontal pipes.
This has already been mentioned
in connection with the hot smoke experiments.
When the
air in
the stack is warmer than that in the horizontal branch, it will tend
to enter the branch and push inward along the top, displacing the
cooler air which will leave the branch along the bottom.
In
this
way a convection current may be set up.
Differences in temperatures
along the horizontal pipe, such as may occur when a pipe extends
through a warm room and the cooler atmosphere of a partition, may
also set up local convection currents.
These would have much the
same effect as diffusion currents.
Some of the experiments made
show that this phenomenon occurs.
The
effect
of
convection
currents
is shown by
experiment
IT
(fig. 107) , which ran for five days.
In this case there was a relatively
greater absorption of carbon dioxide at cups
Ti and i because these
cups were getting the relatively fresher air (higher in carbon dioxide)
which had been passing along the top of the pipe for some distance.
In other words, the carbon dioxide w
ras kept away from the absorbing
solutions at the bottom of the pipe until it had reached the last cup, i.
This same effect is shown to a less degree in experiments B and D.
These temperature effects, however, are slight and erratic and can
not be expected to play an important part in the movement of gases
to or from the pipe.
DIFFUSION
OF GASES THROUGH WATER-SEAL TRAPS
The rate at which a gas such as hydrogen sulphide in a drain
below a trap will pass through the water seal into the atmosphere of a
room depends upon four factors—the amount of gas in the drain, the
cross section of the trap, the developed length of the trap seal, and
the character of the gas with respect to
its power of diffusion,

latter being known
to chemists.
The deeper the seal the less gas
will pass; the greater the cross section
of the trap and the larger
the amount of gas in the drain the more gas will pass through.
There
is one other factor which may influence diffusion, namely, the time
the water remains in the trap.
The longer the time, up to a certain
limit, the greater the amount of diffusion.
. Computations for hydrogen
sulphide, based on
theoretical con-
siderations, showed that the danger of this gas diffusing through the
water from the drain to the room atmosphere is negligible.
To make
this computation required some experimental work.

A 2-inch half S trap was tightly sealed on the side which would
ordinarily be toward the drain.
Two rubber tubes were led into the
interior of the trap through its open end, their openings being very
near to the closed end of the trap.
The trap was then mounted in a
horizontal position and water poured into it until there was a depth
of seal of about 2 inches.
Hydrogen sulphide was then led into the
sealed arms through one of the rubber tubes, the other rubber tube
being used to relieve the pressure.
After one and one-half hours a
distinct odor could be detected by placing the nose near to the water
in the open end of the trap.
This indicated that the gas had diffused
through the water.

252
RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
Probably the concentration of the gas in the sealed arm was not
far from 100 per cent.
This condition would never occur in practice.
If the concentration of hydrogen sulphide in the sewer air were 1 part
per
10,000, an amount probably larger than ever occurs, the odor
from the water of the trap on the room side would be far too small to
be detected and may be regarded as entirely negligible.
It may be
safely said that the danger of odoriferous gases passing through a
water seal trap by diffusion is negligible.
The generation of gases by the decomposition of organic material
collected in the trap itself would be of greater importance.
These
would be proportional to the amount of decomposable matter caught
in the trap.
The larger the volume of water in the trap the less would
be the concentration of the gas and the odor given off for a given
amount of material.
A large, deep
trap, however, would tend
to
retain more sediment and offer a larger interior surface for bacterial
growth.
Such a trap, therefore, might slightly increase the odor on
the room side.
More important than odors diffusing through the trap or being
generated in the trap are those due to the decomposition of organic
matter deposited on the walls of the pipe between the fixture and
the trap and on the walls of the trap itself which may be exposed
when the trap seal is reduced.

RECOMMENDED PLUMBING REQUIREMENTS
Both of the bearings shall be sufficiently rigid to transmit and re-
ceive uniform loads throughout their lengths without deflection and
shaM be so attached
to the machine as to transmit and receive the
maximum stresses produced by the tests without lost motion, vibra-
tion, or sudden shock.
At the option of the consumer or purchaser the crushing test may
be applied with sand bearings or with two or three edge bearings.
The crushing strength
shall be
calculated by
dividing
the
total
load required to break each pipe by the net inside length of the barrel
of the pipe, measuring from the bottom of the socket to the end of
the spigot.
12.
(See fig. 2.)
When three-edge bearings are used, the ends of
each specimen of pipe
shall be accurately marked in halves of the
circumference prior to the test.
The two lower bearings
shall consist
of two wooden
strips with
vertical sides, each strip having its interior top corner rounded to a
radius of approximately one-half inch.
They shall be straight and
shall be securely fastened to a rigid block with their interior vertical
sides
1 inch apart.
The upper bearing shall be a wooden block, straight and true from
end to end.
The
test load
shall be
applied through
the upper bearing block
in such a way as to leave the bearing free to move in a vertical plane
passing midway between the lower bearings.
In testing a pipe which is “out of straight,” the lines of the bearings
chosen shall be from those which appear to give most favorable con-
ditions for fair bearings.
13.
(See fig. 3.)
When sand bearings
are used, the ends of each
specimen
of pipe
shall be
accurately marked
prior
to
the
test
in
quarters of the circumference.
-Specimens shall be carefully bedded,
above and below,
in sand
for one-fourth the circumference
of the
pipe measured on the middle line of the barrel.
The depth of bedding
above and below the pipe at the thinnest points shall be one-half the
radius of the middle line of the barrel.
The sand used shall be clean and shall be such as will pass a No. 4
sieve.
The top bearing frame shall not be allowed to come in contact with
the pipe nor with the top bearing plate.
The upper surface of the
sand in the top bearing shall be struck level with a straightedge and
shall be covered with a rigid top bearing plate, with lower surface a
true plane, made
of heavy timbers or other rigid material capable
of distributing the test load uniformly without appreciable bending.
The test load shall be applied at the exact center of this top bearing
plate in such a manner as to permit free motion of the plate in
all
directions.
For this purpose a spherical bearing is preferred, but two
rollers at right angles may be used.
The test may be made without
the use of a testing machine, by piling weights directly on a platform
resting on the top bearing plate, provided, however, that the weights
shall be piled symmetrically about a vertical line through the center
of the pipe, and that the platform shall not be allowed to touch the
top bearing frame.
The frames of the top and bottom bearings shall be made of timbers
so heavy
as
to avoid
appreciable bending by the
side pressure

surfaces
of
the
frames
shall
be
dressed.
No
frame shall come in. contact with the pipe during the test.
A strip
of cloth may, if desired, be attached to the inside of the upper frame
on each
side,
along the lower edge,
to prevent the escape
of sand
between the frame and the pipe.
14. The crushing test shall ordinarily be applied to not less than
75 per cent of the specimens received for testing purposes.
15.
Pieces of the crushed pipe may be used as specimens in making
the absorption test.
(B )
Hydrostatic test
16. Sound
full-size pipe not exceeding about 25 per cent
of the
specimens received for test in each
size of pipe,
shall be tested for
leakage under internal hydrostatic pressure.
The ends of the pipe shall be tightly closed by wooden or metallic
bulkheads or covers faced with rubber or leather so that no leakage
shall occur through the covers at the test pressure.
One cover shall
be provided with
a three-fourths inch wrought-iron nipple passing
through the cover and held securely in place and made water-tight by
means of lock nuts and washers or gaskets.
The outer end of the
nipple
shall
be connected with
a pump
discharge or water service
line.
Water
pressure,
as measured by
a standardized gauge
attached
to the delivery pipe close to the specimen, shall be internally applied
to the specimen as follows
5 pounds per square inch for
5 minutes.
10 pounds per square inch for 10 minutes.
15 pounds per square inch for 15 minutes.
The specimens shall show no leakage under these pressures.
Mois-
ture appearing on the surface of the pipe in the form of patches or
beads adhering to the surface shall not be considered leakage.
(C) Absorption test
17. The specimens
shall be sound pieces, with
all edges broken,
and may be from pipes broken in the crushing or other tests.
They
shall be from 12 to 20 square inches in area and shall be as nearly
square
as
they can be readily prepared.
They
shall
be
free from
observable cracks, fissures, laminations, or shattered edges.
18. Preparatory to the absorption test, the specimen shall be first
weighed and then dried in a drier or oven at a temperature of not
less than
110°
C.
(230°
F.)
for not
less than
three hours.
After
removal from the drier the specimen shall be allowed to cool in dry
air to a temperature of20to25°C. (68to77°F.) and then reweighed.
If the specimen is comparatively dry when taken, and the second
weight closely agrees with the
first,
it
shall be considered dry.
If
the specimen is wet when taken,
it shall be placed in the drier for a
drying treatment of two hours and reweighed.
If the third weight
checks the second, the specimen shall be considered dry.
In case of
any doubt, the specimen shall be redried for two-hour periods, until
check weights are obtained.

APPENDIX D
PLUMBING MATERIALS

19. The balance used shall be sensitive to 0.5 g when loaded with
a kg, and weighings shall be read to the nearest gram.
When other
than metiic weights are used, the same degree of accuracy shall be
obtained.
20. The specimen after final drying, cooling, and weighing shall be
placed with other
similar specimens
in
a
suitable wire
receptacle,
packed
tightly enough
to
prevent
jostling,
covered with
distilled
water or rain water, raised to the boiling point and boiled for five
hours, and then cooled in water to a final temperature ofl0tol5°C
(50 to 59° F.).
21. The specimen
shall be allowed to drain for one minute and,
the superficial moisture having been removed by towel or blotting
paper, placed upon the balance.
22. The test result shall be calculated as percentage of the initial
dry weight.
23. One specimen shall be tested of each pipe broken in the crush-
ing test.
24. The results
shall be reported separately
for each individual
specimen,
together
with the mean
for
all the specimens from the
same shipment of pipe.
25. Each specimen
shall be marked so that
it may be identified
with the pipe used in the crushing test from which the specimen was
taken.
The marking
shall
be
applied
so
that
the pigment
used
shall not cover more than
1 per cent of the total superficial area of
the specimen.
PHYSICAL TEST REQUIREMENTS
26. The test requirements of clay sewer pipe shall be as given in
Table 2.
The individual results of the various tests for each size of
pipe and for each shipment, class, and mill shall be tabulated sepa-
rately, so as to show the percentage which fails to comply with the
requirements of each test.
A. S. T. M. SIZES AND DIMENSIONS
27. Pipes
shall be furnished of the
sizes, internal diameter, and
with the dimensions given in Tables 3 and 4.

[Issued as tentative, 1917; adopted 1918]
I. MANUFACTURE
1. The cast iron from which the pipe and fittings are made shall
be of such composition and the conditions of manufacture so main-
tained that the castings
will be of uniform physical character, close
grain, and not hard,
brittle, nor difficult to cut with file or chisel.
2.
(a) When pipe or fittings are to be coated, coal-tar pitch shall
be used, which shall contain sufficient oil to make a smooth coating.
The pitch
shall be tough and tenacious when cold and not
brittle
nor having any tendency to scale.
(b) The varnish
shall
be heated
to about 300°
F. and
shall
re-
main at this temperature during the time the casting is immersed.
(c) Each casting shall be heated to a uniform temperature of about
300° F. immediately before
it
is dipped and shall possess this tem-
perature at the time it is put in the bath.
(id ) Each casting shall remain in the bath at least two minutes.
(e) Fresh pitch and oil shall be added when necessary to keep the
mixture of the proper consistency, and the vat shall be emptied of
its contents and refilled with fresh pitch whenever the accumulation
of sand or carbonaceous mattar renders this desirable, as can be seen
by the solids adhering to the underside or lower ends of the castings.
(j0 After
being
coated
the
pipe and
fittings
shall
be
carefully
drained of the surplus varnish.

1 Unless specifically stated on the order, the lighter weights will not be furnished.
Weights given in the
table are for pipes up to and including 12 inches in nominal inside diameter, with threaded ends and coup-
lings; sizes larger than those shown in the table are measured by the outside diameter and will be furnished
with plain ends unless otherwise specified;
for such sizes
it will be necessary to accept manufacturers’
weights or calculate the weights on the basis of 1 cubic inch of steel weighing 0.2833 pound.
Note.—By unanimous agreement of representatives of manufacturers, distributors, and users, made at
a meeting May 28, 1926, under the auspices of the division of simplified practice, Department of Commerce,
agreement was reached that certain sizes and dimensions taken from this list would be regarded as regular
production.
The conclusions of this conference may be consulted in Simplified Practice Recommendation
No. 57 of the Department of Commerce.
