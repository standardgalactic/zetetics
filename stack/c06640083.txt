Cut out all of the components along the dotted lines. In the center of each
piece, punch a hole where indicated. You can use a hole punch, an x-acto knife
(be careful!) or a any sharp, pointy object.

Use a brad through the center of both holes to create a spindle. If you don’t
have a brad, try threading a doubled-up twist-tie through the holes and then
bending it into an I=beam shape

Now, the wheel should turn freely underneath the top layer. Ta-da, 
you just made a paper-engineering mechanism called a volvelle.

To determine the date for 
any day between now and 
2043, turn the wheel to 
display the year in question 
within the window for the 
month in question. The 
month’s numerical dates 
now each correctly correlate  
with the days of the week on 
which they fall.
After the year 2043, 
you can reuse the old 
years; 2044 maps to 
2015 again, 2045 to 
2016, and so on.

• What day of the week will your 20th birthday fall on?  
• What day of the week will you celebrate turning 52? (And what
do you think you’ll do that day? Want to set up a calendar event now? :) )
• When is the next Saturday birthday you'll enjoy? 
• Why is your birthday on a diﬀerent day each year?

Calendar
Calendars are humans’ attempt to make the observable passage of time
(daylight cycles and seasonal cycles) predictable. The unit-based system of 
days and years assigned to the cycles are speciﬁc, yet imprecise. This is 
because the earth’s rotation on its axis is not syncopated with the speed in 
which the earth orbits the sun. As a result, an Earth year is not actually 365 days 
long—it is exactly 365.242 days. The Gregorian calendar corrects for this extra 
fraction of a day by including a 366th day every fourth year, called a leap year, 
which keeps the calendar months predictably in sync with the seasons. This 
perpetual calendar works because it is a wheel—which, like a year, is also a cycle 
divisible into smaller units. It contains all of the dates for 28 years and will
accurately provide the date for every year from 2015 to 2043, and then can
be extended beyond in perpetuity.
