Skull
The skull is divided into the neurocranium or calvaria (contains the brain and its meningeal coverings) and the viscerocranium (facial skeleton).
The skull is composed of 22 bones (excluding the middle ear ossicles), with 8 forming the cranium and 14 forming the face. The orbits (eye
sockets) lie between the calvaria (skull cap) and the facial skeleton and are formed by contributions from 7 different bones.

Anatomic Points
A newborn's skull is large compared to other parts of the skeleton
Facial skeleton small compared to calvaria
Two halves of mandible begin to fuse during first year
The mastoid process is not present at birth but develops in the first 2 years of life
The anterior fontanelle:
A diamond-shaped region covered by a fibrous membrane
Lies at juncture of both frontal with both parietal bones
Ossifies by 18 months
Useful for assessing hydration and measuring heart rate and intracranial pressure
Enlargement of frontal and facial regions associated with increasing size of paranasal sinuses
Vertical growth of face because of dental development
Thinnest part of skull is pterion:
Where parietal bone articulates with greater wing of sphenoid.
Fractures can cause intracranial bleeding as pterion overlies anterior division of middle meningeal artery and vein.
Clinical Points
Skull (Calvaria) Fractures
Can occur as a result of direct trauma to the head
Can be one of several types:
Depressed
Produced by hard blows in regions where calvaria is thin
Fragment of bone forced inward into brain
Linear
Most frequent
Fracture lines radiate away from point of impact
Comminuted - bone broken into several pieces
Contre-coup
May be no fracture at impact site
Brain impacts opposite side of skull and rebounds to site of impact, with resulting bruising
May be associated with brain injury
When assessing a patient with a head injury the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is useful..

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Scalp lacerations
Scalp has rich blood supply
Bleeding from scalp lacerations often profuse, because blood enters periphery of scalp and vessels anastomose
Because of dense connective tissue in second layer of scalp, bleeding vessels do not retract into wound but stay open
Patient can exsanguinate if bleeding is not controlled
Bleeding controlled initially by direct pressure initially followed by suturing in layers rather than tying individual vessels
Clinical Points
Blood or infections in the scalp
Blood or pus from an infection collects in loose connective tissue
Can spread easily
Prevented from passing into the neck or subtemporal regions, because of attachments of the epicranial aponeurosis
Fluid can descend into orbits because orbitalis muscle attaches to skin in this region
Orbital hematomas commonly occur following injury to the scalp
Clinical Points
Facial palsy (Bell's palsy)
Facial nerve palsy without a known cause
Can follow exposure to cold, dental work, Lyme disease, or otitis media
Results in inflammation, compression, or edema of the nerve
Facial nerve supplies muscles of facial expression
Thus result is loss of facial muscle tone on the affected side
Symptoms generally seen:
Paralysis orbicularis oris causes drooping of mouth on affected side and dribbling of saliva
Paralysis of orbicularis oculi causes eyelid to droop and evert, leaving cornea inadequately lubricated and eye constantly tearing
Paralysis of buccinator together with orbicularis oris leads to accumulation of food between cheek and teeth when chewing

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Anatomic Points
Spinal accessory nerve has a subcutaneous course in posterior triangle and can be damaged during surgery. Injury causes weakness of
sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.
The phrenic nerve arises from cervical nerve roots to supply the diaphragm. Irritation of the diaphragm, e.g., because of infection, can
cause referred pain to the C3, C4, C5 dermatome (shoulder).
Clinical Points
Torticollis
In adults, spasm of the SCM can cause pain and turning and tilting of the head (torticollis)
Congenital torticollis can occur in infants due to a fibrous tissue tumor in the SCM that develops in utero
Head bends to affected side and face turns away
Facial asymmetry can occur, because of growth retardation on affected side
page 23
page 24
Clinical Points
Thoracic outlet syndrome
Caused by compression of the subclavian artery, vein, and roots of the brachial as they emerge from the root of the neck.
Patient may complain of pain, paresthesia in the arm as a result of nerve compression; pallor, coldness, and pain in the arm as a result of
arterial compression, or swelling in the arm as a result of decreased venous and lymphatic drainage.
Common cause is the presence of a C7 cervical rib

Nasal septum
The nasal cavity is separated from the cranial cavity by portions of the frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid bones, and from the oral cavity inferiorly by the
hard palate. A nasal septum, usually deviated slightly to one side or the other, divides the nasal cavity into right and left chambers. The anterior third
of the nasal septum is cartilaginous and the posterior two thirds is bony.

Nasal Cavity
page 26
page 27
The lateral wall of the nasal cavity is characterized by three shell-like conchae, or turbinates, that protrude into the cavity, and along with their
covering of nasal respiratory epithelium, they greatly increase the surface area for warming, humidifying, and filtering the air. At the most superior
aspect of the nasal cavity resides the olfactory region, with its olfactory epithelium and specialized sensory cells for the detection of smells.

Maxillary
Paired sinuses, in maxilla, draining into middle meatus (semilunar hiatus); largest sinus (20-30 ml)
There are four pairs of paranasal sinuses, which are open chambers within several of the bones surrounding the nose and orbits. They are lined
with respiratory epithelium, assist in warming and humidifying the inspired air, and drain their mucus secretions into the nasal cavities. Blowing the
nose clears the nasal cavity and sinuses of excess secretions.

In older people can be related to hypertension
Treatment involves identifying the source of bleeding and stopping the bleeding by direct pressure, packing the nose or cautery.
Clinical Points
Sinusitis
Paranasal sinuses may become infected via continuity with nasal cavities
Inflammation and swelling of mucosa lining sinus
Can be acute or chronic
Bacterial infection usually follows a viral infection
Patient may complain of pain, nasal discharge, blocked nose, postnasal drip, and fever

From pharyngeal plexus (motor and almost all sensory)
Motor
From pharyngeal plexus via vagus nerve from cranial root of accessory nerve (cranial nerve [CN] XI)
To all muscles of pharynx except stylopharyngeus (CN V2)

To inferior constrictor
Sensory
Mainly from glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via plexus
Also
Maxillary nerve (CN V2) to anterior and superior nasopharynx
Tonsillar nerves from branches of glossopharyngeal and vagus (CN X)
Swallowing (deglutition)
Occurs in three stages
1 = voluntary
Food is in the mouth, breathing occurs through the nasopharynx
Food is chewed (masticated) and mixed with saliva to produce a bolus
Bolus of food is compressed against hard palate
Palatoglossal folds relax
Muscles of tongue and soft palate push bolus into oropharynx
Cycle lasts 1 to 2 seconds
2 = involuntary
Reflexive, mediated via glossopharyngeal nerve
Nasopharynx is closed off by tension and elevation of the soft palate
Prevents reflux of food/fluids into the nose
Mediated by tensor veli palatine and levator veli palatine muscles
Suprahyoid muscles and longitudinal pharyngeal muscles contract
Elevate larynx
Close epiglottis
Propel bolus
3 = involuntary
Food propelled through the pharynx by peristalsis (sequential contraction of all three constrictors)
On reaching the distal end of pharynx, high pressure causes relaxation of terminal part of inferior constrictor
Called cricopharyngeus muscle
Serves as superior esophageal sphincter
Food enters the oesophagus
As bolus passes pressure drops, the sphincter closes
Larynx and epiglottis return to normal positions

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Anatomic Points
The piriform fossa is a common site for fish bones to lodge. It is also a site where pharyngeal tumors can grow undetected for a period of
time.
Aggregations of lymphoid tissue in the nasopharynx are called adenoids. They can become enlarged in children, causing obstruction of the
nasopharynx and forcing the child to breathe through the mouth.
page 41
page 42
Clinical Points
Pharyngitis
Also called a sore throat
Usually caused by viral infection
In children, common cause of bacterial pharyngitis is beta hemolytic streptococcus
If infection is severe, auditory tubes can become blocked, predisposing to otitis media
Patient may complain of pain on swallowing and pain referred to the ear
On examination, the throat may be reddened and cervical lymph nodes may be enlarged
Clinical Points
Tonsillectomy
Surgical removal of the palatine and lingual tonsils
Tonsillectomy is advised if the patient has experienced recurrent attacks of tonsillitis, particularly if they resulted in airway obstruction and
hearing difficulties
A major and common surgical procedure performed in children in the USA
Recovery usually within 2 weeks, although for adults this may take longer and can have a higher complication rate

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
page 48
page 49
Severance of recurrent laryngeal nerve
Recurrent laryngeal nerve (supplies intrinsic muscles larynx)
Is closely associated with inferior thyroid artery and needs to be avoided during neck surgery
If unilateral damage, voice hoarseness may result because one vocal fold cannot approximate the other.
If bilateral damage, loss of voice will result because vocal folds cannot approximate each other (be adducted)
Clinical Points
Thyroid lumps
Lumps in thyroid can be single, multiple
Solitary nodules are likely to be benign (80%)
Investigation includes: history, examination, and fine-needle aspiration of the gland for cytology and radionucleotide imaging
Most common malignant is papillary thyroid cancer
Treatment is total thyroidectomy
Clinical Points
Hyperthyroidism
Medical condition with increased activity of the thyroid gland
Results in excessive amount of circulating thyroid hormones
Leads to increased rate of metabolism
Affects about 1% of women and 0.1% of men
Thyrotoxicosis is a toxic condition caused by an excess of thyroid hormones from any cause.
Hyperthyroidism with diffuse goiter (Graves' disease)
Most commons cause of hyperthyroidism in patients younger than 40 years.
Excess synthesis and release of thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) result in thyrotoxicosis,
Thyrotoxicosis upregulates tissue metabolism and leads to symptoms indicating increased metabolism.

General Testing of Extraocular Muscles
Extraocular muscles act as synergists and antagonists and are responsible for multiple movements of the eye.
It can be difficult to test each eye muscle individually.
A generalist, however, can gain a general idea of extraocular muscle (or nerve) impairment by checking the ability of individual muscles to
elevate or depress the globe with the eye abducted or adducted, thereby aligning the globe with the pull (line of contraction) of the muscle
Ask patient to "Follow my finger with just your eyes" and move your finger in the form of the letter H.
Superior rectus is tested by moving your finger superiorly and medially to the eye (to counteract the interaction of the inferior oblique)
a. Inferior rectus is tested by moving your finger inferiorly and medially to the eye (to counteract the interaction of the superior oblique)
b. The medial and lateral rectus muscles are tested by moving your finder medially and laterally to the eye.
c. The inferior oblique is tested by moving your finger superiorly and laterally to the eye
d. The inferior oblique is tested by moving your finger inferiorly and laterally to the eye.
Remember that because all the muscles are involved in the continuous movement of the eye, it is difficult to isolate the action of just one
with absolute clinical certainty via this test.
Clinical Points
Cataract
Most common clinical condition of the eye worldwide
Involves opacification or cloudiness of the lens
Risk factors include: smoking, age, alcohol, diabetes, steroid use, and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays
Treatment involves surgical removal of the lens
Eyesight is corrected with an implant, glasses, and/or contact lens
Clinical Points
Glaucoma
One of most common cause of blindness world wide
Build-up of pressure in anterior and posterior chambers of the eye
Usually a result of resistance to outflow of aqueous humor via angle of eye and through canal of Schlemm
Results in compression of neural layer of retina
Leads to visual field defects and ultimately blindness
Increased intraocular pressure classified as open or closed angle
a. Open angle-develops gradually with blocking of canal of Schlemm or obstruction of angle
b. Closed angle-occurs rapidly when iris and lens block passage of aqueous humor through pupil
Clinical Points
Orbital "blow-out" Fractures
Medial and inferior walls of orbit are very thin, so a blow to the eye can fracture the orbit
Indirect trauma that displaces walls is called a "blow-out" fracture
Fractures of medial wall may involve ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses
Fracture of the floor may involved the maxillary sinus
Fractures can result in intraorbital bleeding
Blood puts pressure on eyeball, causing exophthalmos
Blood and orbital structures can herniate into maxillary sinus
Clinical Points
page 58
page 59
Conjunctivitis
Common condition often referred to as "pink eye"
An inflammation of the conjunctiva
Symptoms include redness, irritation, and watering of the eyes and sometimes discharge and itching
Can be triggered by infection
a. Highly contagious
b. Caused by bacteria or viruses
c. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia, can cause it
d. Viral conjunctivitis is common with several viral infections and can arise as a result of or during a common cold or flu
Can be triggered by allergies
a. More freqently occurs in children with other allergic conditions, e.g., hay fever, animal fur
b. Typically affects both eyes at the same time
Can be triggered by an external irritant
a. Can be caused by pollutants such as traffic fumes, smoke
b. Can be caused by chemicals such as soap, chlorine

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Otitis externa
Defined as an inflammation or infection of the external ear
Also called swimmer's ear
Usually bacterial in origin
Pathogens include pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus
Patient may present with itchiness, a sensation of having the ear blocked, and pain
Ear on examination is painful, erythematous, and may be discharging pus
Treatment is with topical antibiotics (eardrops)
Clinical Points
Otitis media
Defined as an inflammation of the middle ear
Also known as glue ear
Most common in children between the ages of 6 months and 2 years
Symptoms include: pulling or rubbing the ears because of ear pain, fever, fussiness, or irritability, fluid leaking from the ear, changes in
appetite or sleeping patterns, trouble hearing
Usually to the result of bacterial infection
On examination with an otoscope, the ear drum looks dull with loss of the cone of light
Commonly treated with antibiotics
With frequent reoccurring infections and evidence of hearing loss or speech delay, small tubes called tympanostomy tubes are placed in the
eardrums to ventilate the area behind the eardrum and keep the pressure equalized to atmospheric pressure in the middle ear.
Clinical Points
Weber Test and Rinne Test for Hearing
page 64
page 65
Weber Test
With a Weber test of hearing, a tuning fork is struck and placed on the patient's forehead
The patient is asked to report in which ear the sound is heard louder
This test cannot confirm normal hearing, because hearing defects affecting both ears equally will produce an apparently normal test result
A Rinne test should be done at the same time
Rinne Test
A Rinne test compares perception of sounds, as transmitted by air or by sound conduction through the mastoid
This is achieved by placing a vibrating tuning fork (512 Hz) initially on the mastoid, then next to the ear and asking which sound is loudest
A patient with normal hearing with a positive Rinne on both sides would hear the sound equally in both ears or may not even hear it at all if
the room is noisy enough to mask the subtle sound of the tuning fork
A patient with a unilateral (one-sided) conductive hearing loss would hear the tuning fork loudest in the affected ear (conduction through
bone is more effective that the normal route through the outer and middle ear)

Head and Neck: Cranial and Cervical Nerves
Cranial Nerves
12 pairs of cranial nerves arise from the brain, and they are identified both by their names and by Roman numerals I through XII. The cranial nerves
are somewhat unique and can contain multiple functional components:
General: same general functions as spinal nerves
Special: functions found only in cranial nerves
Afferent and efferent: sensory or motor functions, respectively
Somatic and visceral: related to skin and skeletal muscle (somatic), or to smooth muscle and glands (visceral)
Hence, each cranial nerve may possess multiple functional components, such as GSA (general somatic afferents), meaning it contains nerve
fibers that are sensory from the skin, not unlike those of the spinal nerve; GVE (general visceral efferents), meaning it contains motor fibers to
visceral structures (smooth muscle and/or glands) like a parasympathetic fiber from the sacral spinal cord (S2-S4 gives rise to parasympathetics);
or SSA (special somatic afferents), meaning it contains special sensory fibers, such as those for vision or hearing.

In general, CN I and II arise from the forebrain and are really tracts of the brain for the special senses of smell and sight. CN III, IV, and VI move the
extraocular skeletal muscles of the eyeball. CN V has three divisions: V1 and V2 are sensory, and V3 is both motor to skeletal muscle and sensory.
CN VII, IX and X are both motor and sensory. CN VIII is the special sense of hearing and balance. CN XI and XII are motor to skeletal muscle. CN III,
VII, IX and X also contain parasympathetic fibers of origin (visceral), although many of the ANS fibers will "jump" onto the branches of CN V to reach
their targets. The following table summarizes the types of fibers in each cranial nerve and where each passes through the cranium:
Cranial nerves emerge through foramina or fissures in the cranium
Twelve pairs
Numbered in order of origin from the brain and brain stem, rostral to caudal
Contain one or more of six different types of fibers
Motor fibers to voluntary muscles
Somatic motor fibers to striated muscles (1)
a. Orbit
b. Tongue
c. Neck (sternocleidomastoid and trapezius)
Branchial motor (or special visceral efferent fibers) to striated muscles derived from pharyngeal arches (example: muscles of
mastication) (2)
Motor fibers to involuntary muscles = general visceral efferent (parasympathetic fibers) (3)
Sensory fibers
General visceral afferent fibers (4)
a. Carry sensation from viscera
b. Originate in carotid body, sinus, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract
General somatic afferent fibers carrying pain, pressure, temperature, touch information (5)
Special sensory afferent fibers conveying taste, smell, vision, hearing, and balance (6)

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Facial Nerve Palsy
Unilateral (one-sided) injury to the facial nerve or its branches
Results in sudden weakness affecting some or all of facial muscles on affected side
Causes include: infections such as TB, polio; brainstem lesions; tumors, such as acoustic neuromas; acute and sudden exposure of the
face to cold temperatures
Angle of mouth droops on affected side with dribbling of food and saliva
Sad look when face is relaxed
Lower eyelid falls away from eyeball with drying of cornea and tearing from corner of eye
Speech affected (production of B,M,P, and W sounds), because of weakened lip muscles
Trigeminal Neuralgia
Disease affecting the sensory root of CN V
Characterized by episodes of intense pain lasting a few seconds in areas innervated by the trigeminal nerve.
Usually one-sided and can affect a division of CN V, usually the mandibular, maxillary nerve.
Pain can be triggered by touching a sensitive area ("trigger point")
The cause is not usually known
Treatment is directed to controlling the pain.
Ocular Nerve Palsy
A lesion of the oculomotor nerve will paralyze all extraocular muscles except the lateral rectus and the superior oblique. This leads to :
Ptosis-drooping of the eyelid (levator palpebrae superioris)
No constriction of the pupil in response to light (sphincter pupillae)
Dilation of the pupil (unopposed dilator pupillae)
Eyeball abducted and depressed ("down and out") (unopposed lateral rectus and superior oblique)
No accommodation of the lens for near vision (ciliary muscle)

Types of Vertebral Fractures
Compression fractures
Vertebral body collapses
Caused by osteoporosis, trauma, or tumor
Usually occur at C7 and T1
Moderate to severe pain, limitation of movement, kyphosis
Jefferson fracture
Four part fracture of the ring of C1
Caused by a fall on the vertex
Patients have upper neck pain but can be neurologically intact
Hangman fracture
Caused by hyperextension of the head on the neck
Bipedicle fracture of C2
Anterior displacement of C2 and C3
Results in quadriplegia or death
Cervical Hyperextension
Most common in young adults from trauma and sports injuries and the elderly, resulting in cord compression
Result of whiplash from car accidents
Results in soft tissue injury, fractures, dislocations, ligamentous tears, and disc disruption
Clinical Points
Spinal curvatures: The primary curvatures of the vertebral column in the thoracic and sacral regions develop during the fetal period and are
caused by differences in height between the anterior and posterior aspects of the vertebrae. The secondary curvatures are mainly a result of
anterior-posterior differences in IV disc thickness. The cervical curvature is acquired when the infant begins to lift its head, and the lumbar
curvature when the infant begins to walk.
Abnormal curvatures: Kyphosis is an increased thoracic curvature, commonly seen in the elderly ("Dowager hump"). It is usually caused by
osteoporosis, resulting in anterior vertebral erosion or a compression fracture. An excessive lumbar curvature is termed a lordosis and is
seen in association with weak trunk muscles, pregnancy, and obesity. Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, accompanied
by rotation of the vertebrae.
Spondylolisthesis: The lumbosacral angle is created between the long axes of the lumbar vertebrae and the sacrum. It is primarily because
of the anterior thickness of the L5 body. As the line of body weight passes anterior to the SI joints, anterior displacement of L5 over S1 may
occur (spondylolisthesis), applying pressure to the spinal nerves of the cauda equina.
Sacralization: In about 5% of individuals, the L5 vertebra is partially or totally fused with the sacrum. Because the L5/S1 level is now very
strong, the L4/5 level is likely to degenerate in these cases.

Vertebral bodies:
Thoracic are heart-shaped since your heart is in your thorax
Lumbar are kidney-bean shaped as the kidneys are in the lumbar area
Craniovertebral joints:
Atlantooccipital joint is the yes-yes joint because it permits nodding
Atlantoaxial joint is the no-no joint because it permits turning the head from side to side

Meninges
Dura mater: Tough fibroelastic membrane
Is continuous with the inner (meningeal) layer of the cranial dura
Attached to the margins of the foramen magnum and posterior longitudinal ligament
Separated by the epidural space from vertebral periosteum
Extends as a sac from the margin of the foremen magnum to the level of S2
Pierced by spinal nerves
Anchored to the coccyx by the external filum terminale
Forms dural root sleeves covering the spinal nerves before fusing with the epineurium
Arachnoid mater: Delicate, avascular, fibroelastic membrane lining dural sac
Opposed (held to inner surface) to dura by CSF pressure
Is external to the subarachnoid space, between arachnoid and pia, containing CSF, traversed by strands of connective tissue
(arachnoid trabeculae)
Contains the lumbar cistern, an enlargement of subarachnoid space between L2 (end of spinal cord) and S2 (end of dural sac)
Pia mater: Highly vascular innermost layer covering roots of spinal nerves

[Plate 167, Veins of the Vertebral Column: Vertebral Veins]
Anterior spinal artery
Is a single artery running in ventromedian fissure
Arising from branches of the vertebral arteries (with contributions from the ascending cervical, deep cervical, intercostal, lumbar, and
sacral arteries)
Supplies the anterior two thirds of the spinal cord and vertebral bodies
Posterior spinal arteries
Are paired, longitudinal arteries arising from vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar arteries
Supply posterior one third of the spinal cord and vertebral bodies
Radicular arteries
Are dorsal and ventral arteries arising from ascending cervical, deep cervical, intercostal, lumbar, and sacral arteries
Supply the nerve roots (called segmental arteries if they reach the anterior or posterior spinal arteries)
Great anterior segmental artery (of Adamkiewicz)
Occurs on the left side in 65% of individuals
Contributes to two thirds of the circulation to the inferior spinal cord
Veins: Usually 3 anterior and 3 posterior longitudinal spinal veins with tributaries from the posterior medullary and radicular veins. They
drain into the valveless vertebral venous plexus.
Vertebral venous plexus is continuous with the cranial dural venous sinuses and contains no valves
Internal vertebral plexus (lying in the extradural space) drains the spinal cord
External vertebral plexus connects with azygos vein, superior and inferior vena cavae
Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)
page 91
page 92
Sympathetic NS: catabolic system for fight or flight
T1-L2/3 (thoracolumbar) levels
Presynaptic (preganglionic) neurons have cell bodies located in the intermediolateral cell columns of the spinal cord (T1-L2 only)
and utilize acetylcholine (Ach) as their neurotransmitter and synapse in para- or prevertebral ganglia
Postsynaptic (postganglionic) neurons have cell bodies in the paravertebral and prevertebral ganglia
Paravertebral ganglia linked to form right and left sympathetic chains (superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglia, T1-S5, ganglion
impar)
Paravertebral ganglia attached to spinal nerves by white (T1-L2) and grey (C1-Co) rami communicantes
 
121 / 425

Long postsynaptic neurons utilize norepinephrine as their neurotransmitter
Prevertebral ganglia (celiac, superior, and inferior mesenteric, aorticorenal) are in plexuses surrounding the origins of the main
branches of the abdominal aorta
Splanchnic nerves are presynaptic fibers that pass through the paravertebral ganglia without synapsing to enter cardiac, pulmonary,
esophageal, various abdominal and pelvic plexuses, where they synapse
Sympathetic fibers innervate smooth muscle, modified cardiac muscle, glands, and medulla of suprarenal glands
Parasympathetic NS: anabolic system for homeostasis
S2-S4 levels and cranial nerves III, VII, IX, X (craniosacral)
Long presynaptic neurons (Ach) with cell bodies in the mediolateral grey matter (S2-S4)
Short postsynaptic neurons arising near target organs (Ach)
Innervation of smooth muscle, modified cardiac muscle, and glands of thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic viscera
Visceral afferent NS: provides sensory input from the body's internal environment
Provides visceral sensation
Can trigger both somatic and visceral reflexes

Clinical Points
Disc Herniation
Protrusion of the nucleus pulposus through the annulus fibrosus:
Ninety-five percent at the L4/5 or L5/S1 level
Usually posterolateral herniation where annulus is thinnest
Herniation into the vertebral canal may compress the nerve root below the disc and cause pain in the related dermatome
Age-related dehydration of nucleus pulposus contributes to loss of height and narrowing of IV foramina
Lumbar Spinal Stenosis
Narrowing of the vertebral canal
Compression of spinal cord caused by age-related degenerative changes such as bulging of the IV discs or arthritis
Surgical laminectomy or removal of the entire vertebral arch may be necessary to alleviate symptoms
Clinical Points
Spinal cord development: In the fetus, the spinal cord extends down to the sacral vertebrae. As a fetus matures, the cord shortens relative to
the rest of the body, so at birth the conus medullaris reaches the L2/3 level, and by adulthood only around the level of the L1/2 IV disc, where
the cauda equina begins
Epidural block: Anaesthetic injected into epidural space of the sacral canal either via the sacral hiatus (caudal epidural) using the sacral
corneae as landmarks, or via the posterior sacral foramina (transsacral epidural). The anesthetic solution spreads superiorly to act on
spinal nerves S2-Co. The height to which the anesthetic ascends is affected by the amount of solution injected and the position of the
patient.
Spinal block: Introduction of an anesthetic directly into the CSF (in the subarachnoid space) utilizing a lumbar puncture (see above). Onset
of anesthesia is rapid <1 minute (unlike epidural anesthesia that may take up to 20 minutes). Subsequent leakage of CSF may cause a
headache in some individuals.

Clinical Points
Back pain: A very common, usually self-limiting complaint, often affecting the lumbar region ("low back pain"). Radiation to back of the thigh
and into the leg (sciatica) or focal neurology suggests radiculopathy. Disturbance of bladder/bowel function should prompt urgent
intervention.
Back strain: Stretching and microscopic tearing of muscle fibres or ligaments, often because of a sport-related injury. The muscles
subsequently go into spasm as a protective response causing pain and interfering with function. This is a common cause of low back pain.
Whiplash: Cervical muscle and/or ligament strain because of forceful hyperextension of the neck. Frequently caused by impacts from the
rear in motor vehicle accidents. May cause herniation of the IV disc and subsequent radiculopathy.

[Plate 239, Cross Section of Thorax at T7 Level]
[Plate 532, Key Figures to Cross Sections]
The thorax lies between the neck and the abdomen and lies within a cage formed by the vertebrae, the ribs, the sternum, the costal
cartilages, and their attached muscles. The thoracic cage protects the contents of the thorax, whereas the muscles assist in breathing.
It is important to identify and count ribs as they form key landmarks to the positions of the internal organs.
In a fit muscular person one can identify a number of landmarks:
Jugular (suprasternal) notch: at the level of the inferior border of the T2 vertebra
Sternal angle (manubriosternal join): at the level of the T4/5 intervertebral disc and where the second costal cartilages articulate with
the sternum.
Manubrium: The left brachiocephalic vein runs beneath the manubrium from the upper left to lower right, where it joins the right
brachiocephalic vein to form the superior vena cava

Imaginary perpendicular lines passing through the midpoint of each clavicle are called the midclavicular lines.
Midaxillary lines are perpendicular lines through the apex of the axilla on both sides
Cephalic vein can be seen in some subjects lying in the deltopectoral groove between the deltoid and pectoralis major muscles.

Clinical Points
The sternum can be divided to gain access to the thoracic cavity for surgical operations. This is called a median sternotomy.
The middle ribs are most commonly fractured, and multiple rib fractures can manifest as a "flail chest," where the injured region of the chest
wall moves paradoxically, that is, in on inspiration and out on expiration.

19 Mammary Gland
STUDY AIMS
At the end of your study, you should be able to:
Identify the mammary gland
Identify the location of the gland

Understand the lymphatic drainage of the breast
Know how to palpate the breast
 
138 / 425

GUIDES
Thorax: Mammary Gland
[Plate 176, Mammary Gland]
Consists of glandular tissue in which the majority is embedded within the tela subcutanea (superficial fascia) of the anterior chest wall
overlying the pectoral muscles.
The glands are rudimentary in males and immature females.
Size and shape of the adult female breast varies; the size is determined by the amount of fat surrounding the glandular tissue.
The base of the breast is fairly consistent extending from the lateral border of the sternum to the midaxillary line and from the 2nd to the 6th
ribs.
The majority of the breast overlies the deep pectoral fascia of the pectoralis major muscle, with the remainder overlying the fascia of the
serratus anterior.
The breast is separated from the pectoralis major muscle by the retromammary space, a potential space filled with loose connective tissue.
The breast is firmly attached to the overlying skin by condensation of connective tissue called the suspensory ligaments (of Cooper), which
help to support the lobules of the breast.
A small part of the mammary gland may extend toward the axilla, called the axillary tail (of Spence).
Structure of the Breast
For descriptive purposes, the breast is divided into four quadrants: upper and lower lateral, and upper and lower medial.
The most prominent feature of the breast is the nipple.
The nipple is surrounded by the areola, a circular pigmented area of skin.
The areola is pink in Caucasians and brown in African and Asian people.
The pigmentation of the areola increases during pregnancy.
The areola contains sebaceous glands, following a pregnancy these secrete an oily substance to protect the mother's nipple from irritation
during nursing.
The breast is composed of 15 to 20 lobules of glandular tissue, formed by the septa of the suspensory ligaments.
The mammary glands are modified sweat glands that are formed from the development of milk-secreting alveoli, arranged in clusters.
Each lobule is drained by a lactiferous duct
Each lactiferous duct opens on the nipple.
 
139 / 425

Vasculature of the Breast
page 99
page 100
Blood supply of the breast arises from the perforating branches and anterior intercostal branches of the internal thoracic artery.
The breast is also supplied by the branches of the thoracoacromial and lateral thoracic arteries (from the axillary artery).
Venous drainage parallels the arterial supply and is mainly to the axillary artery and internal thoracic vein.
Lymphatic Drainage of the Breast
[Plate 178, Lymph Vessels and Nodes of Mammary Gland]
Lymph from the nipple, areola, and lobules of the mammary glands drains to a subareolar lymphatic plexus.
From there, a system of interconnecting lymphatic channels drains lymph to various lymph nodes.
The majority of the lymph, especially from the lateral quadrants of the breast, drains to the pectoral nodes, and from there to the axillary
nodes.
The remaining amount of lymph, especially from the medial quadrants of the breast, drains into the parasternal lymph nodes along the
internal thoracic vessels.
Some lymph from the lower quadrants of the breast passes to the inferior phrenic nodes.
It is important to note that lymph from the medial quadrants can cross to the opposite breast.
Thus secondary metastases of breast carcinoma can spread to the opposite breast in this way.
 
140 / 425

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Examination of the Breast
Clinically the breast is divided into quadrants:
UI: upper inner
UO: upper outer (includes axillary tail)
LI: lower inner
LO: lower outer
The breast is palpated in a circular fashion, beginning with the nipple and moving outward. The palpation should extend into the axilla to
palpate the axillary tails.
After palpation of one breast, the other should be palpated in the same way.
Examine the skin of the breast for a change in texture or dimpling (peau d'orange sign) and the nipple for retraction, since these signs may
indicate an underlying pathology.
Pathology of the Breast
Fibroadenoma: benign tumor, usually a solid and solitary mass that moves easily under the skin. Often painless although sometimes
tender on palpation. More common in young women but can occur at any age.
Intraductal carcinoma or breast cancer: the commonest type of malignancy in women but can also occur in men. Approximately 50% of
cancers develop in the upper quadrant of the breast; metastases from these cancers often spread to the axillary lymph nodes. This
malignancy presents as a palpable mass that is hard, immobile and sometimes painful. Additional signs can include bloody or watery
nipple discharge if the larger ducts are involved.
Gynecomastia: enlargement of the breasts in males because of aging, drug treatment, and changes in the metabolism of sex hormones by
the liver.

Intercostal nerves
[Plate 185, Intercostal Nerves and Arteries]
Intercostal nerves arise from the ventral rami of the upper eleven thoracic spinal nerves
Each intercostal nerve divides to give a lateral cutaneous branch near the midaxillary line
Anterior cutaneous branches innervate the skin on the anterior abdomen and thorax and divide into medial and lateral branches.
Muscular branches supply the intercostal, levatores costarum, transversus thoracis, and serratus posterior muscles.
The lower five intercostal nerves supply the skin and muscles of the abdominal wall
Contain general somatic afferent and efferent fibers, as well as general visceral efferent fibers from the sympathetic trunk via white and grey
rami communicantes and general visceral afferent fibers.
Ribs
 
145 / 425

[Plate 180, Ribs and Sternocostal Joints]
All ribs contain bone marrow.
Ribs 1 through 7 are vertebrocostal because they attach to the sternum via a costal cartilage.
Ribs 8 through 10 are vertebrochondral because their cartilages are joined to the cartilage of the rib above and via that connection to the
sternum.
Ribs 11 and 12 are free or floating ribs, which do not connect even indirectly with the sternum but which have a costal cartilage on their tips.
First rib is broad and sharply curved and has a tubercle of the attachment of scalene muscles.

Important Vertebral Landmarks
Spine of the scapula T2:
Sternal angle (of Louis); level of the bifurcation of trachea, arch T4/T5: of aorta
Level of the heart T5-T8:
Aortic hiatus of the diaphragm; also transmits the thoracic duct T12:
Esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm; also transmits the right and left T10: vagal trunks, esophageal branches of left gastric vessels and
lymphatics
Caval opening of the diaphragm; also terminal branches of the right T8: phrenic nerve
Thoracocentesis
Thoracocentesis is the insertion of a needle into the pleural cavity to withdraw a sample of fluid or blood. To avoid damage to the intercostal
vein, artery, and nerve that run in the costal groove on the inferior surface of each rib, the needle is inserted well below the rib. The needle
also must be placed sufficiently above the rib below to avoid the collateral branches of intercostal nerve and vessels that run along the
superior surface of each rib.
Importance of Certain Intercostal Spaces
Second intercostal space at the midclavicular line: Insertion of tube for an apical pneumothorax (thoracostomy)
Fourth to 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line: Insertion of chest drains for a hemothorax (thoracostomy)
Left 5th intercostal space: apex beat of the heart and this is shifted in heart enlargement
Cervical Ribs
Cervical ribs are not common (less than 1% of all persons). They articulate with the C7 vertebra, but do not attach to the sternum. They may
fuse with the first rib. If a cervical rib is present, however, it may compress the subclavian artery or inferior trunk of the brachial plexus and
cause ischemic pain and numbness in the shoulder and upper limb. This condition is called thoracic outlet syndrome.
Bone Marrow Biopsy and Aspiration.
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy help diagnose many blood disorders and can be used to detect if cancer has spread to the bone
marrow.
Bone marrow biopsy: The removal of bone and marrow for examination under the microscope. The sternum is a site of red marrow,
even in adulthood, and is a good site for a bone marrow biopsy. Another common site is the posterior iliac crest. A biopsy is usually
conducted before performing a bone marrow aspiration.
Bone marrow aspiration: The removal of a small amount of bone marrow fluid through a needle inserted into the bone. Fluid is
examined to determine if there are any problems with the blood cells made in the bone marrow

GUIDES
Thorax: Lungs
[Plate 192, Lungs in Situ: Anterior View]
Thoracic Cavity, Pleurae and Pleural Cavity
Thoracic cavity has
two lateral pleural cavities, containing the lungs and pleurae
a central compartment, the mediastinum, containing all the other thoracic structures
Each lung is surrounded by, and covered with, a continuous membrane, which is defined as
the visceral pleura, which covers the lungs and cannot be dissected from the lung
the parietal pleura, which lines the pleural cavities
The visceral and parietal pleura are continuous at the hilum of the lung where structures enter and leave the lung (bronchus, pulmonary
vessels, bronchial vessels, lymphatics)
The parietal pleura has four named parts:
Costal pleura lining the internal surface of the thoracic wall
Mediastinal pleura covering the sides of the mediastinum
Diaphragmatic pleura covering the superior surface of the dome of each hemidiaphragm
Cervical pleura-a dome of pleura extending superiorly into the superior thoracic aperture
Visceral pleura does not have any general sensory innervation and is insensitive to pain
The parietal pleura is very sensitive to pain because of its sensory supply by branches of the intercostal and phrenic nerves
The pleural cavity is the potential space between the parietal and visceral pleura.
The pleural cavity contains a thin layer of serous pleural fluid, which lubricates and allows the pleurae to move smoothly over each
other during respiration.
Surface tension keeps the lung surface in contact with the thoracic wall.
The lung expands and fills with air when the thoracic cavity expands.
Lines of pleural reflection
page 105
page 106
 
151 / 425

Lines of pleural reflection are lines along which the parietal pleura changes directions from one wall to another.
The sternal line of pleural reflection is the sharp line along which the costal pleura becomes the mediastinal pleura
The costal line of pleural reflection is the sharp line along which the costal pleura becomes the diaphragmatic pleura
The vertebral line of pleural reflection is a smooth reflection of the costal pleura onto the vertebrae posteriorly.
The lines of pleural reflection on the left side can be remembered as 4-6-8-10-12.
The line of pleural reflection on the left descends in the midline of the sternum to the 4th costal cartilage, where it deviates to the left
margin of the sternum at the 6th costal cartilage to accommodate the pericardium and the heart (cardiac notch).
This line then deviates to cross the 8th rib at the midclavicular line.
It crosses the 10th rib at the midaxillary line
It then crosses the 12th rib at approximately the neck.
On the right side, the line of pleural reflection descends at the midline of the sternum to the xiphoid process, and then deviates 8-10-12.
The lungs do not fully occupy the pleural cavities during expiration
There are peripheral areas where the diaphragmatic and costal pleura come in contact and these are called the costodiaphragmatic
recesses.
There are areas posterior to the sternum where the costal and mediastinal pleura come in contact with each other, and these are called
costomediastinal recesses.
The costomediastinal recess is larger on the left, because of the cardiac notch.
During expiration, the lower limit of the lungs is two costal spaces above the line of pleural reflection:
6-8-10: the sixth rib at the midclavicular line, the 8th rib at the midaxillary line, and the 10th rib at the neck.
Thus the costodiaphragmatic recess is approximately two costal spaces deep.
Lungs
[Plate 193, Lungs: Medial Views]
Organs of respiration
Light, soft and elastic
The right lung is larger than the left and has three lobes:
Superior or upper
Middle
Inferior or lower
The left lung has two lobes
Superior or upper
Inferior or lower
 
152 / 425

Fissures divide the lungs into lobes
Each lung has an oblique fissure, separating the upper lobe from the lower lobe on the left and the upper and middle lobes from the
lower lobe on the right
The right lung has a horizontal fissure, separating the middle lobe from the upper lobe on the right
The oblique fissure runs from the 2nd thoracic vertebra posteriorly to the 6th costal cartilage anteriorly, or along the medial border of the
scapula when the arm is raised above the head.
The horizontal fissure runs from the oblique fissure at the midaxillary line along the 4th rib to its costal cartilage anteriorly.
The anterior margin of the left lung has an indentation-the cardiac notch, which often creates a thin process in the upper lobe called the
lingula.
Each lung has three surfaces:
Costal
Mediastinal
Diaphragmatic
Each lung is connected to the mediastinum by the root of the lung.
Lung root contains:
Main stem or lobar bronchi
Pulmonary vessels and bronchi.
Bronchial vessels, lymphatics, and autonomic nerves.
The lung root is surrounded by a pleural sleeve, from which extends the pulmonary ligament inferiorly.
The pulmonary ligament
page 106
page 107
Bronchopulmonary segments
The trachea bifurcates into two main stem bronchi, right and left, at the level of the T4/5 intervertebral disc (also the sternal angle of Louis).
The carina is the keel-like ridge between the two openings of the main stem bronchi.
The right main stem bronchus divides into upper and lower lobar bronchi before reaching the substance of the right lung.
The main bronchi branch to form the bronchial tree.
There are three lobar bronchi on the right: upper, middle, and lower
There are two lobar bronchi on the left: upper and lower
Each lobar bronchus branches into segmental bronchi that supply a bronchopulmonary segment.
A bronchopulmonary segment
Is a pyramidally shaped section of the lung with its base covered by visceral pleura
Is separated from adjacent segments by connective tissue septa
Is names for the segmental bronchus that supplies it
Has its own bronchus and segmental branch of the pulmonary artery
Each bronchopulmonary segment can be surgically resected, independent of adjacent segments
The right lung has 10 bronchopulmonary segments
Upper lobe: Apical
Anterior
Posterior
Middle lobe: Medial
Lateral
Lower lobe: Superior

Inferior lingular
Lower lobe: Superior
Anterior basal (may be combined with medial to form anteromedial basal)

The right main stem bronchus is wider and shorter than the left one and descends in a more vertical plane, so aspirated foreign objects are
more likely to lodge in it or one of its branches
Because the posterior segmental bronchus of the right lower lobe runs directly posterior, foreign objects that are inhaled when the person is
lying down, such as food, may end up in this segmental bronchus.
Vasculature of the lungs
 
153 / 425

[Plate 200, Great Vessels of Superior Mediastinum]
 
154 / 425

[Plate 201, Bronchial Arteries and Veins]
page 107
page 108
Each lung is supplied by a pulmonary artery, which carries unoxygenated blood from the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricle of the heart.
Each pulmonary artery gives rise to lobar and segmental arteries.
Intrasegmental veins drain to intersegmental veins in the pulmonary septa, which run a separate course from the pulmonary and
segmental arteries and which drain to two pulmonary veins for each lung.
Pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood to the left atrium of the heart.
Bronchial arteries from the thoracic aorta carry oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, traveling along the posterior surface of the
bronchi.
The left bronchial arteries come from the thoracic aorta; the single right bronchial artery may also arise from the superior posterior
intercostal or a left superior bronchial artery.
The bronchial arteries anastomose with branches of the pulmonary arteries.
Pulmonary veins drain the blood to the lungs supplied by the bronchial veins and empty into the azygos and accessory hemiazygos veins.
The lungs have a rich, freely connecting network of lymphatic vessels.
Lymph from the lungs drains to
Pulmonary lymph nodes (along the lobar bronchi)
Bronchopulmonary lymph nodes (along the main stem bronchi)
Superior and inferior tracheobronchial lymph nodes (superior and inferior to the bifurcation of the trachea)
Innervation of the lungs
Innervation is via the pulmonary plexuses located anterior and posterior to the lung roots.
The plexuses contain postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the sympathetic trunks that innervate the smooth muscle of the bronchial tree,
pulmonary vessels, and glands of the bronchial tree.
Sympathetic fibers are bronchodilators, vasoconstrictors, and inhibit glandular secretion.
The plexuses contain preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve (CN X), small parasympathetic ganglia, and
postganglionic parasympathetic nerves that innervate the smooth muscle of the bronchial tree, pulmonary vessels, and glands of the
bronchial tree.
Parasympathetic fibers are bronchoconstrictors, vasodilators, and secretomotor to the glands.
Visceral afferent fibers carry information involved in cough reflexes, stretch reception, blood pressure, chemoreception, and nociception

Clinical Points
Diseases such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis and lymphoma cause hilar lymphadenopathy that is visible in chest radiographs.
Pneumonia: a bacterial or viral infection of the lung that can lead to widespread systemic infection and lung collapse. Pneumonia is
frequently confined to a single lobe of one lung and is called lobar pneumonia. It can be clearly seen circumscribed to one lobe in a chest
radiograph.
The entry of air into a pleural cavity because of a penetrating wound or a fractured rib is called a pneumothorax and results in partial or total
collapse of the lung.
The escape of fluid into the pleural cavity (pleural effusion) is called hydrothorax; if the fluid is blood, the condition is known as a
hemothorax, and if it is chyle from the thoracic duct, it is called a chylothorax.
Inflammation of the pleurae is called pleuritis or pleurisy; resulting friction between the two pleurae (pleural rub) is very painful and can be
heard with a stethoscope.
The inflamed pleurae may adhere to each other (pleural adhesion)
Squamous cell or oat cell carcinoma is a common cancer of the lung, usually caused by smoking, that may be indicated by a persistent
cough or spitting of blood (hemoptysis).

[Plate 206, Heart: Anterior Exposure]
Pericardium
 
160 / 425

[Plate 209, Pericardial Sac]
The pericardium is a double-layered sac that encloses the heart and the roots of the great vessels.
The fibrous outer layer of the pericardium (the fibrous pericardium) consists of dense connective tissue.
The fibrous pericardium is attached to the central tendon of the diaphragm by the pericardiacophrenic ligament.
It blends with the tunica adventitia of the vessels entering and leaving the heart.
It has ligamentous attachments to the sternum
It is thus affected by movements of the heart, the great vessels, the sternum, and the diaphragm.
It protects the heart against overfilling because it is fibrous and unyielding
The inner layer of the pericardium is a serous membrane that lines the fibrous pericardium: the serous pericardium, also called the parietal
pericardium.
The serous pericardium is a mesothelial layer that reflects onto the roots of the great vessels and is continuous over the external surface of
the heart, where it is called the epicardium or visceral pericardium.
Between the serous pericardium (parietal pericardium) and the epicardium (visceral pericardium) is a potential space: the pericardial cavity.
The pericardial cavity normally contains a thin film of fluid that allows the two layers to move over each other without friction or rubbing.
There are two sinuses within the pericardial cavity: the transverse sinus and the oblique sinus.
The transverse pericardial sinus runs transversely in the pericardial sac between the origins of the great vessels: posterior to the
ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk and anterior to the superior vena cava.
The oblique pericardial sinus is a wide recess in the posterior wall of the pericardial sac bounded laterally by the entrances of the
pulmonary veins and inferiorly by the orifice of the inferior vena cava.
Blood supply to the layers of the pericardium is mainly from the pericardiacophrenic vessels, from the internal thoracic arteries and veins.
The nerve supply to the pericardium is from the phrenic nerves, primarily sensory fibers for pain, and the sympathetic trunks (vasomotor).
page 110
page 111
Heart
The heart is a muscular pump for the propulsion of blood to all parts of the body.
The right side of the heart receives poorly oxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cava and pumps it to the lungs for
oxygenation.
The left side of the heart receives oxygenated blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins and pumps it to the body via the aorta and its
branches.
The heart consists of four chambers: the right and left atria and the right and left ventricles.
The chambers of the heart have walls that consist of three layers:
 
161 / 425

Endocardium: internal layer of endothelium and connective tissue
Myocardium: the middle, thick muscular layer of the heart
Epicardium, or visceral pericardium
The fibrous skeleton of the heart is a framework of dense collagen that encircles the orifices of the four valves (pulmonary, aortic, tricuspid
and mitral).
The functions of the fibrous skeleton are:
Maintains the patency of the atrioventricular valves
Provides a fixed site for the attachment of the leaflets and cusps of the valves
Provides a fixed site for the attachments of the cardiac muscle fibers
Insulates the atria from the ventricles so that they can contract independently
The cardiac cycle consists of
Relaxation of the ventricles (diastole) followed by
Contraction of the ventricles (diastole)
Heart sounds heard with a stethoscope:
"lub"-blood from the atria fills the ventricles
"dub"-ventricles contract and push blood out of the heart
Orientation of the Heart: Border and Surfaces
[Plate 208, Heart: Base and Diaphragmatic Surfaces]
The heart lies obliquely between the 3rd and the 5th ribs, mainly on the left side of the midline of the thorax, but with roughly a third of it
slightly to the right.
The base of the heart is its posterior surface, which is the left atrium.
The apex of the heart is formed from the most inferior and lateral part of the left ventricle and lies beneath the left 5th intercostal space at
approximately the midclavicular line.
Borders
Right border: the right atrium between the superior and inferior vena cavae
Left border: left auricle and left ventricle
Inferior border: mainly right ventricle with some contribution from the left ventricle
Superior border (anterior view): right and left atria and their auricles

page 111
page 112
Right atrium
The posterior wall of the right atrium is smooth (sinus venarum) and contains the orifices of the superior vena cava and coronary sinus.
The anterior wall is ridged with the pectinate muscles.
The smooth and rough parts of the right atrium are separated internally by a smooth ridge, the crista terminalis, which presents externally
as shallow groove, the sulcus terminalis.
The superior vena cava opens into the superior aspect of the right atrium.
The inferior vena cava opens into the inferior part, in a direct line with the superior vena cava.
An interatrial septum separates the right and left atria.
An oval depression in the interatrial septum, the fossa ovalis, represents the fetal foramen ovale and its valve.
A right atrioventricular (AV) orifice opens into the right ventricle
Right ventricle
The right ventricle is situated in front and to the left of the right AV orifice.
The interior has prominent muscular ridges, the trabeculae carnea.
The tricuspid valve or right AV valve usually consists of three leaflets.
The bases of the leaflets or cusps are attached to the fibrous ring around the orifice.
The free edge of each leaflet is attached to two of the three papillary muscles by tendinous cords (chordae tendinea).
The papillary muscles are three in number: septal, anterior and posterior.
These muscles contract before the ventricle itself contracts, tightening the chordae tendinea and drawing the cusps of the valve together to
prevent backflow of blood into the right atrium.
The septomarginal trabecula, or moderator band, is a free band of muscle extending from the interventricular septum to the anterior wall of
the ventricle, and it contains Purkinje fibers from the right bundle branch (see conducting system).
The outflow tract of the ventricle is separated from the inflow tract by a smooth crest, the supraventricular crest.
The outflow tract, or conus arteriosus, is smooth walled and leads to the pulmonary trunk and the valve that guards its orifice, the pulmonary
valve.
The pulmonary valve has three cusps, which open like pockets to catch regurgitated blood during ventricular diastole
Left Atrium
 
164 / 425

The left atrium forms the base of the heart.
It has a smooth walled portion from the developmental incorporation of a portion of the pulmonary veins and an auricular appendage which
is ridged with pectinate muscles and which was the primitive left atrium.
Four pulmonary veins empty into the left atrium.
The interatrial septum is nearly transverse, sloping posteriorly and to the right
The left atrioventricular orifice leads to the left ventricle.
Left Ventricle
page 112
page 113
The left ventricle is nearly twice as thick as the right ventricle, since it performs more work to circulate blood to the body.
It has a conical cavity, the apex of which is the apex of the heart.
Its walls are lined with trabeculae carnea, which are more numerous and not as massive as the ones in the right ventricle.
It contains only two papillary muscles, anterior and posterior, which both attach to the two leaflets of the left atrioventricular, or mitral, valve via
chordae tendinea.
These muscles contract before the ventricle itself contracts, tightening the chordae tendinea and drawing the cusps of the valve together to
prevent backflow of blood into the left atrium.
The aortic orifice is located posteriorly and superiorly and, like the pulmonary orifice, is surrounded by a fibrous ring to which the three
cusps of the aortic valve are attached.
The aortic valve has three cusps, which open like pockets to catch blood that backflows from the aorta during ventricular diastole.
There are dilations in the wall of the aorta beneath each cusp: the aortic sinuses.
The right coronary artery originates in the right aortic sinus, while the left coronary artery originates in the left aortic sinus.
Coronary Circulation

[Plate 212, Coronary Arteries: Arteriographic Views]
 
166 / 425

[Plate 213, Coronary Arteries: Arteriographic Views (Continued)]
Arteries
The arterial supply to the heart is the right and left coronary arteries, the first branches of the aorta.
They arise from the corresponding aortic sinuses, just distal to the origin of the aortic valve.
The left coronary artery passes between the left auricle and the pulmonary trunk. Its main branches are
A circumflex branch, which reaches the posterior surface of the heart by traveling in the atrioventricular groove around the left side of
the heart
In slightly less than half of all people, a sinoatrial (SA) nodal branch from the circumflex branch will supply the SA node.
An anterior interventricular branch (left anterior descending artery or LAD), which descends in the anterior interventricular groove to
the apex of the heart and then anastomoses with the posterior interventricular artery.
The right coronary artery runs in the atrioventricular groove to the right and around to the posterior surface of the heart. It gives rise to
The SA nodal branch near its origin (in most people)
A right marginal branch to the right margin of the heart
An AV nodal branch to the atrioventricular node, as the junction of the septa and four chambers of the heart on the posterior side of
the heart
A posterior interventricular branch that runs in the posterior interventricular groove.
The left coronary artery supplies
Left atrium
Most of left ventricle
Some of the right ventricle
Interventricular septum
SA node (40% of people)
The right coronary artery supplies
Right atrium

167 / 425

The coronary sinus is a wide vein that runs transversely across the posterior surface of the heart in the coronary groove.
The coronary sinus receives blood from
The great cardiac vein that ascends in the anterior interventricular groove and enters the coronary sinus at its left end
The middle cardiac vein (posterior interventricular vein) that ascends in the posterior interventricular groove and enters the coronary
sinus at its right end
Small cardiac veins
Left marginal vein
Left posterior ventricular vein(s)
Anterior cardiac veins that enter the right atrium directly

[Plate 219, Conducting System of Heart]
 
170 / 425

[Plate 221, Innervation of Heart: Schema]
Both divisions of the autonomic nervous system provide fibers to the cardiac plexus
The conducting system of the heart coordinates the cardiac cycle of contraction. It consists of
The sinoatrial node (SA node), located at the superior end of the sulcus terminalis of the right atrium, near the entrance of the
superior vena cava
The SA node is the so-called pacemaker of the heart, from which impulses for contraction are initiated and spread through the
musculature of both atria.
Fibers from the cardiac plexus supply the SA node.
Sympathetic innervation accelerates the rate and force of contraction of heart muscle.
Parasympathetic stimulation slows down the rate and force of contraction of heart muscle.
Signal from the SA node is propagated by the cardiac muscle to the AV node.
The AV node is located near the inferior end of the interatrial septum posteriorly, near the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve.
The AV bundle carries the signal from the AV node through the fibrous skeleton of the heart and the membranous interventricular septum.
It divides into right and left bundles that pass on either side of the muscular interventricular septum.
The fibers of the right and left bundles (Purkinje fibers) spread into the walls and papillary muscles of the ventricles.
Purkinje fibers from the right bundle innervate the anterior papillary muscle of the right ventricle via the septomarginal trabecula or
moderator band, to coordinate the timing of the contraction of the papillary muscles.
Heart Sounds
Clinicians need to listen to valve sounds.
Blood carries sound in the direction of its flow, so valve sounds are best heard (auscultated) directly superficial to their location or at the end
of a line of blood flow through the valve.

Cardiac Tamponade
Inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) can result in pericardial effusion, a leakage of fluid from the pericardial capillaries into the
pericardial cavity.
Similarly, stab wounds to the heart can result in the leakage of blood into the pericardial cavity.
As excess blood or fluid accumulates in the pericardial cavity, the heart becomes increasingly inhibited from expanding as it beats, and
blood flow to the ventricles is impeded.
This situation is called cardiac tamponade and is a potentially lethal condition.
Symptoms include distension of neck veins and a collapsing pulse, i.e., diastolic and systolic pressures become the same.
Pericardiocentesis
Pericardiocentesis or drainage of fluid from the pericardial cavity is necessary to relieve cardiac tamponade.
A wide bore needle is inserted into the 5th or 6th intercostal space adjacent to the sternum (but not too close because of the presence of the
internal thoracic vessels).
This approach can be made because of the cardiac notch in the left lung and left parietal pleura, leaving the pericardial sac exposed.
A needle can also be inserted into the infrasternal angle, again being careful of the internal thoracic artery and its branches, and passed
superiorly and posteriorly to reach the pericardial sac.
Cardiac Referred Pain
While the heart is generally insensitive to various stimuli, ischemia (lack of oxygen) and the resulting accumulation of metabolic products
registers as pain, typically in the left pectoral and substernal regions and over the medial aspect of the left shoulder and upper limb.
The axons of visceral afferent fibers from the heart typically enter spinal cord segments from T1 through T4 or 5 on the left side.
General sensory fibers from these areas also enter the same spinal cord segments
Cardiac Bypass Graft (CABG)
In this surgery, the patient has a blood vessel grafted into the coronary circulation to bypass an occlusion in one of the coronary arteries or
its branches.
In the past, the saphenous vein was commonly used in the bypass graft, because it is easily obtained from the lower limb and has lengthy
sections without valves or branches.
The internal thoracic artery is more frequently used to shunt blood from the aorta to branches of the coronary arteries beyond the occlusion.
This restores normal blood flow to the part of the heart distal to the blockage.
Ventricular Septal Defects (VSDs)
The membranous part of the interventricular septum is the most common site of ventricular septal defects (VSDs).
VSDs account for 25% of all cardiac abnormalities.
It can be a result of any one of several developmental anomalies, such as failure of the embryonic endocardial cushions, which form part of
the septum, to fuse.
A left to right flow of blood occurs with this defect because of the strength of contraction of the left ventricle.
This increases the blood flow through the pulmonary trunk to the lungs and results in pulmonary hypertension (increased blood pressure)
and an enlarged heart.
This condition is potentially fatal if not corrected.
Pathologies of the Aorta
Aneurysms of the ascending aorta
An aortic aneurysm is an enlargement of a weakened area of the aorta, in this case in the distal part of the ascending aorta.
Aneurysms are prone to rupture once they reach a certain size and 50% of patients who experience a rupture of a thoracic aortic
aneurysm die before reaching the hospital.
Ascending aortic aneurysms frequently cause dilation and leakage of the aortic valve, resulting in shortness of breath or even heart
failure.
They can also cause a dull pain beneath the sternum and/or pain radiating to the upper back.
Aortic dissection is a tearing of the internal wall of the aorta, with subsequent bleeding into the wall, as the result of an aneurysm,
atherosclerosis, or high blood pressure.
Coarctation of aorta is a birth defect in which the aorta is narrowed somewhere along its length, most commonly just past the point where
the subclavian artery arises.
This results in low blood pressure in branches of the aorta distal to the narrowing and high blood pressure in branches between the
narrowing and the heart.
People with this condition often have high blood pressure in the upper body and arms (or one arm) and low blood pressure in the
lower body and legs.
The intercostal arteries can become enlarged, since the anastomoses of the anterior intercostals (from the internal thoracic artery)
with the posterior intercostals can circumvent the narrowing.
Aortic coarctation is more common in some genetic conditions such as Turner syndrome but also can be associated with congenital
abranditemities of the aortic valve such as a bicuspid aortic valve.
Valvular Insufficiencies
The mitral valve is the heart valve most frequently affected by disease.
It can be caused by endocarditis, myocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, or lupus erythematosus, or can result from a developmental
abranditemity.
The diseased mitral valve allows reversal of blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium (mitral regurgitation).
It is characterized by a high pitched murmur, loudest over the apex of the heart.
Narrowing of the pulmonary valve (stenosis) is caused by fusion of the valve cusps.
It can result from a developmental abranditemity or diseases such as rheumatic fever or endocarditis.
 
172 / 425

Stenosis of the pulmonary valve leads to right ventricular hypertrophy and heart failure, if not corrected surgically.

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies all of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx but one.
Surgery, injury, or disease affecting the contents of superior mediastinum can damage either or both recurrent laryngeal nerves, reducing
the voice to a hoarse whisper.
The left recurrent laryngeal nerve passes beneath the arch of the aorta and ascends to the neck between the trachea and the esophagus.
Bronchogenic or esophageal carcinoma or an aneurysm of the arch of the aorta can thus affect this nerve.
Chylothorax
Surgical procedures involving the posterior mediastinum can injure the thoracic duct, which is hard to identify because it has a thin wall and
is usually colorless.
Injury to the thoracic duct can lead to leakage of lymph into the thoracic cavity at a volume of up to 200 mL per hour.
Lymph is called chyle when it is carrying chylomicrons (fat droplets) from the digestion of food in the gastrointestinal system.
If lymph from the thoracic duct enters the pleural cavity, the resulting condition is called a chylothorax and may require removal by
thoracocentesis.

Clinicians may divide the abdomen into nine regions
For more accurate descriptive and diagnostic purposes
Use two vertical and three horizontal lines or planes
Horizontal planes (in descending order):
Subcostal plane: passes through the lower border of the 10th costal cartilage on either side
Sometimes the transpyloric plane is used instead of the subcostal; passes through the pylorus on the right and the tips of
the ninth costal cartilage on either side

Vertical planes
Right midclavicular line
Left midclavicular line
Pass from the midpoint of the clavicle to the midpoint of inguinal ligament.
These planes create nine abdominal regions:

Clinical Points
McBurney's Point and Appendicitis
McBurney's point: A surface landmark that roughly indicates the location of the appendix, located approximately one third of the way along a
line from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus.
Appendicitis: inflammation of the appendix. Pain first presents in the epigastric region, moves to the umbilical region and then localizes in
the right lower quadrant. Rupture of the appendix leads to peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum). This presents with severe pain, fever,
and abdominal rigidity.
Muscle-splitting incision (of McBurney): used to access the appendix. Each muscle layer is split in the direction of the fiber orientation. The
incision must not go too far laterally or the ascending branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery may be severed.

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Inguinal Hernia
Most abdominal hernias occur in the inguinal region
Most hernias are inguinal hernias
Inguinal hernias are more common in men
About 20% are direct inguinal hernias.
Direct inguinal hernias protrude through the layers of the wall in Hesselbach's (the inguinal) triangle, medial to the epigastric vessels.
The hernial sac consists of peritoneum containing a portion of a viscus (usually small or large bowel)
Indirect hernias which leave the abdomen lateral to the epigastric vessels, entering the inguinal canal through its deep ring.
The hernial sac consists of peritoneum containing a portion of a viscus (usually small or large bowel) and is covered by the layers covering
the spermatic cord.
The hernia may continue through the superficial ring and into the scrotum.
Clinical Points
Psoas Abscess
Usually caused by the spread of lumbar vertebral tuberculosis to the psoas sheath.
The sheath becomes thickened and pus accumulates beneath it
Pus tracks inferiorly within the sheath, deep to the inguinal ligament, surfacing in the superior part of the thigh.
Should pus track to the adjacent iliac fascia, a recess may form-the iliacosubfascial fossa.
The large bowel can become trapped in this fossa, with resulting severe pain.

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Anatomic Points
The greater omentum is often referred to as the "abdominal policeman." It can move within the peritoneal cavity and wrap itself around an inflamed
organ, localizing inflammation and preventing adhesion between the visceral peritoneum and parietal peritoneum of the abdominal wall.
page 140
page 141
There are several ways to access the omental bursa surgically:
Directly through the lesser omentum
Through the transverse mesocolon
Through the gastrocolic ligament (part of the greater omentum)
Clinical Points
Peritonitis
Inflammation of the peritoneum
Can be localized (e.g., secondary to appendicitis) or generalized (e.g., secondary to bowel perforation)
Can result in reflex tensing ("guarding") of the overlying abdominal musculature leading to abdominal rigidity.
Involvement of parietal peritoneum leads to well-localized, sharp abdominal pain with tenderness on palpation.
Ascites
Accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity
May form secondary to peritonitis or a variety of other pathological conditions
Abdomen may become grossly distended as many liters of fluid accumulate
Paracentesis may be undertaken both for diagnostic purposes and for draining the ascitic fluid.
Usually performed under local anaesthesia.

Hiatus hernia
Herniation of part of the stomach through the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm
May cause pain and discomfort and predispose to reflux of gastric contents
Sliding hernias involve the cardia of the stomach sliding superiorly
Rolling hernias (less common) involve part of the fundus extending through the hiatus
Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
Thickening of smooth muscle of the pylorus
Causes severe stenosis of the pyloric canal
Gastric emptying is greatly reduced and typically leads to the presentation of projectile vomiting following a feeding
More common in males, and usually presents 3 to 8 weeks after birth
Diagnosis made by palpating a pyloric mass in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) during a test feeding
Intestinal volvulus
Rotation of a loop of bowel upon its mesentery
May cause acute bowel obstruction
Can compromise the vascular supply leading to ischaemia, infarction, and eventually necrosis
Most commonly occurs in the mobile small bowel, but may also affect the sigmoid colon, owing to the length of its mesentery
Prompt surgical decompression may be required, although passage of a flatus tube is usually sufficient in cases of sigmoid volvulus

Gallstones (cholelithiasis)
Stone-like deposits are commonly seen in the gallbladder
If they obstruct the cystic duct, can cause pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), especially after consumption of a fatty meal.
Pain typically comes and goes (biliary colic) and may be associated with nausea and vomiting.
Secondary inflammation of the gallbladder leads to constant pain, and is often the trigger to seeking medical attention.
If the gallstones pass further down, they may obstruct the biliary system causing jaundice, or the pancreatic duct causing pancreatitis.
Splenic rupture
Spleen is the most commonly damaged abdominal organ, despite being protected by the ribcage.
Trauma causing rib fracture or sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure (such as being impaled against a steering wheel in a road
traffic accident) may result in rupture of the spleen.
Bleeding is typically profuse owing to its thin capsule and soft parenchyma.
Subphrenic abscess
Subphrenic recess is a common site for pus to accumulate.
Right-sided abscesses are more common owing to the incidence of perforation of an inflamed appendix.
Pus usually tracks into the hepatorenal recess in the supine position, and is best drained inferior to the 12th rib (avoiding puncture of the
pleura).

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Portal Hypertension
Raised venous pressure within the portal circulation.
Resistance to portal blood flow may occur due to intrahepatic obstruction (fibrosis of the liver from cirrhosis)
Resistance may also occur as a result of posthepatic obstruction (such as heart failure or Budd-Chiari syndrome) or prehepatic obstruction.
Clinical consequences are ascites in the abdomen, congestive splenomegaly, hepatic encephalopathy, and the enlargement of portocaval
venous anastomoses
Clinical Points
Budd-Chiari Syndrome
Caused by hepatic vein obstruction (for example by thrombosis or tumors)
Patients present with acute epigastric pain and shock
May also have insidious portal hypertension, ascites, jaundice, and cirrhosis
Surgery may relieve the obstruction
Liver transplantation may be needed

Anatomic Points
Vascular supply to the kidney
Variation in the vascular supply to the kidney is fairly common.
Embryologically, the kidneys develop in the pelvis and ascend to their abdominal position.
In doing so, they acquire successively more superior vessels from the aorta and IVC, whereas inferior vessels degenerate.
Failure of degeneration of any of these vessels may result either in branches to the poles of the kidney, or in accessory vessels at the hilum.
Furthermore, the renal arteries are not infrequently divided prior to their arrival at the hilum.
Clinical Points
Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)
Renal caliculi (stones) may be found anywhere between the renal calices and urinary bladder
A stone in the ureter can cause significant distension
This results in colicky pain radiating from loin to groin as ureteric contractions try to move the stone distally
In the past, an intravenous urogram (pyelogram) was the imaging tool to determine a filling defect in the ureter
More recently, a computed tomography (CT) scan has become the tool of choice, because patients may have an allergic response to the dye
used in the urogram.
Management is usually conservative (waiting for the stone to pass), but may be surgical or involve lithotripsy (sonic disruption of the stone).
Renal cysts
Cysts are a common finding in the kidney.
They may be solitary or multiple.
Solitary cysts are usually of no clinical consequence.
Multiple cysts may cause gross distortion and enlargement of the kidneys, culminating in renal failure.
Multiple cysts may be caused by adult polycystic kidney disease, because of an autosomal dominant gene.

Clinical Points
Pregnancy: In pregnancy the placenta can be palpated above the pubic symphysis at 12 weeks, at the umbilicus at 12 weeks, and at the
xiphisternum at 40 weeks.
Acute Urinary Retention: The bladder, if distended, may be palpated and percussed up to the umbilicus. On examination, the bladder is dull
to percussion and in acute urinary retention, the patient may also complain of tenderness on palpation in the suprapubic region.
Supracristal Line: A useful landmark when performing a lumbar puncture since it corresponds to the 4th lumbar vertebral body. Lumbar
puncture in adults is performed in the lateral decubitus position in the L4-L5 interspace.
Pilonidal Sinus: A blind ending hair-filled tract most commonly found in the midline of the natal cleft overlying the lower sacrum and coccyx
and occurs in 26/1000 persons in the United States. The sinus can become infected, creating a so-called pilonidal abscess that usually
requires drainage and/or excision of the sinus.

Are united by cartilage at the acetabulum
Pelvic girdle
Is formed of hip bones and sacrum
Transmits weight from upper body to lower limbs
Pelvic walls
Formed by bones of bony pelvis, ligaments, muscle, and fascia
Surround pelvic cavity
Pelvic cavity
page 168
page 169
Basin shaped
Surrounded by bony pelvis
 
260 / 425

Boundaries:
Superiorly-pelvic inlet and inferior abdominal cavity
Inferiorly-pelvic diaphragm
Anterior wall-bodies and rami of pubic bone and pubic symphysis
Posterior wall-sacrum and coccyx, adjacent ilia and overlying piriformis muscle
Lateral walls-hip bones, obturator foramen and membrane, and overlying obturator internus muscle
Pelvic inlet, outlet, and brim
Inlet defined by an oblique plane
Extends from promontory to the superior aspect of the pubic symphysis
Lies at an angle approximately 55 degrees from horizontal
Rim of pelvic inlet = pelvic brim, composed of a bony line running through
Sacral promontory
Arcuate line of the ilium
Pectineal line of the pubis (pecten pubis)
Pubic crest
Superior edge of pubic symphysis
Pelvic outlet is bounded by
Tip of coccyx
Sacrotuberous ligaments
Inferior ischiopubic rami and ischial tuberosities
Inferior edge of pubic symphysis
Pelvic inlet divides pelvis into two parts
True pelvis or lesser pelvis or pelvis minor, which
lies between pelvic inlet and outlet
contains the pelvic viscera
False pelvis or greater pelvis or pelvis major, which
lies above pelvic brim
between the iliac fossae
contains part of the ileum and sigmoid colon
The birth canal includes the pelvic inlet, true pelvis, cervix, vagina, and pelvic outlet
Joints of the Pelvis
Lumbosacral joints
Composed of
Intervertebral joint via intervertebral disc between L4 and S1
Two posterior zygapophysial joints
Reinforced by iliolumbar ligaments
Sacroiliac joint
Articulation between ear-shaped surfaces of the sacrum and ilium
Atypical synovial joint formed with fibrocartilage rather than hyaline cartilage
Movement is very limited
Stabilized by interosseous and anterior and posterior sacroiliac ligaments
Pubic symphysis
page 169
page 170
Union of bodies of right and left pubic bones
Secondary cartilaginous joint
Fibrocartilaginous interpubic disc in the joint
Stabilized by superior and inferior pubic ligaments
Affected by the hormone relaxin during pregnancy to permit freer movement between vertebral column and to increase pelvic diameter
during childbirth
Sacrococcygeal joint
Articulation between sacrum and coccyx
Secondary cartilaginous joint
Stabilized by anterior and posterior sacrococcygeal ligaments
Ligaments of the Pelvis
The weight of the body acting through the spine will tend to rotate the sacrum, tipping the lower part backwards.
This movement is prevented by the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.
Sacrospinous ligament: extends from lateral border sacrum to ischial spine
Sacrotuberous ligament: larger and extends from dorsum and lateral border sacrum and posterior surface ilium to ischial tuberosity
Attachments of sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments enclose the lesser and greater sciatic notches, respectively, forming the greater
and lesser foramina

Sex Differences of Pelvis
Differences linked to function
Pregnancy and childbirth in females
Heavier build and larger muscles of men
Main differences
Pelvis is heavier and has more pronounced muscle attachment sites in men than in women
Pubic arch is narrower and the subpubic angle more acute in men than women
Ischial tuberosities are closer in men than in women, and the pelvis outlet is thus comparatively smaller.
All of the ilia are less flared in men than in women, so the greater pelvis is deeper.
Pelvic inlet is heart-shaped in men and more transversely oval in women
Obturator foramen is round in men and oval in women
Female pelvis is broader than in men, to allow the passage of the fetal head

Clinical Points
Fractures of the Pelvis
A large force is required to fracture the pelvis and fractures usually result from direct trauma, such as occurs in automobile accidents
The bony pelvis may fracture at any point and there may be associated damage to pelvic viscera, for example, bladder and urethral rupture
can occur with fractures involving the pubis
Pelvic fractures are classified as stable or unstable.
In a stable fracture, the pelvis remains stable and there is only one break-point in the pelvic ring with minimal hemorrhage.
In an unstable fracture, the pelvis is unstable with two or more break-points in the pelvic ring with moderate to severe hemorrhage.
Signs of a fractured pelvis include: pain in the groin, hip or lower back; difficulty walking; urethral, vaginal or rectal bleeding; scrotal
hematoma; and shock as a result of concealed hemorrhage (contained bleeding into the pelvic cavity)
A fracture can be confirmed on x-ray and is seen as a break in continuity of the pelvic ring.
Decubitus Ulcers
Also called pressure sores
Can be a partial- or full-thickness loss of skin, underlying connective tissue and can extend into muscle, bone, tendons, and joint capsules.
Two thirds of pressure sores occur in patients older than 70 years
Results from prolonged pressure on an area of skin, connective tissue and muscle from a mattress, wheelchair seat, or bed rail.
Commonly occur in those with poor mobility, bed-bound, poor nutrition, and incontinence.
Can become infected with bacteria from poor skin care, or fecal or urinary incontinence
The hip and buttock regions account for 67% of all pressure sores, with ischial tuberosity, trochanteric, and sacral locations being most
common.
In the sitting position, the ischial tuberosity bears the weight of the whole body and thus is a prime site of ulceration

The pelvic diaphragm is composed of two paired muscles
Levator ani
Coccygeus
Levator ani muscle
Paired muscle
Principal muscle of pelvic floor
Supports pelvic contents
Actively maintains position of pelvic viscera
Arcus tendineus: a thickened line of the fascia over the obturator internus muscles running in an arching line from the pubis to the ischial
spine
Central perineal tendon or perineal body
A fibromuscular body extending from the perineum into the urogenital hiatus
The site of numerous muscle attachments in the perineum
Components of the levator ani muscle
Pubococcygeus
Is anterior part of levator ani
Main contributor to the levator ani
Arises from the posterior body of the pubic bone and anterior part of the arcus
Tendineus
Runs posteriorly to attach to the anococcygeal ligament and the coccyx
 
268 / 425

Iliococcygeus
Posterior part of the levator ani Is thin and poorly developed
Arises from the posterior part of the arcus tendineus and the ischial spine
Attaches to the anococcygeal raphe and the coccyx
Puborectalis
A thickened band of muscle best seen inferior to the pubococcygeus
Unites with its partner to make a U-shaped sling around the rectum at its junction with the anus
Has a sphincter-like action by pulling the anorectal junction forward and contributing to anal continence
Medial muscle fibers of the pubococcygeus border the urogenital hiatus
Most anterior fibers insert into the urethra
Other fibers sweep behind the vagina or prostate and insert into the central perineal tendon, and are called the levator prostatae or
pubovaginalis
Coccygeus muscle
Reinforces pelvic floor posteriorly
Arises from ischial spine
Inserts on lower two sacral and upper two coccygeal segments
Blends with sacrospinous ligament on its external surface
Innervation of the levator ani and coccygeus muscles
Levator ani innervated by branches from the anterior rami of S3-S4 spinal nerves
Puborectalis also innervated by branch of pudendal nerve (S2,3,4)
Coccygeus supplied by branches of the anterior rami of S4-S5 spinal nerves
Functions of the levator ani
Acting together raise the pelvic floor to increase abdominal pressure, such as when coughing, sneezing, urinating, defecating, lifting
heavy objects.
Important in voluntary control of micturition (urinating)
Supports pelvic viscera
Supports head of the fetus
Muscles Lining the Lateral Walls of the Pelvis

Pelvic Fascia
Occupies space between peritoneum and muscles of the pelvic floor and walls
Parietal pelvic fascia lines the internal surface (facing the pelvic cavity) of the muscles of the floor and walls
Visceral pelvic fascia invests each of the pelvic organs
Visceral and parietal fascia are continuous where organs penetrate pelvic floor
Where they are continuous, fascia thickens to form the tendineus arch of pelvic fascia (arcus tendinous fasciae pelvis)
Arches are bilateral bands running from pubis to sacrum, adjacent to viscera
Puboprostatic ligament
Pubovesical ligament
Sacrogenital ligaments
Between parietal and visceral fascia is endopelvic fascia
Matrix or filler material
In certain areas, condenses and becomes more fibrous to form fascial "ligaments" or septa
Major condensation is the hypogastric sheath
Runs from lateral pelvic wall to pelvic viscera
Separates retropubic space from presacral space
Serves as a conduit for vessels and nerves
Transverse cervical (cardinal) ligaments are part of hypogastric sheath
Runs from lateral wall to the uterine cervix and vagina
Uppermost part is beneath broad ligament and transmits the uterine artery
Is sufficiently fibrous to provide passive support for the uterus
 
269 / 425

Uterosacral (female) or genitosacral (male) ligaments
Septa separate the pelvic organs and include
Vesicovaginal septum
Rectovesical septum
Rectovaginal septum
Weakness of the pelvic floor muscles or in the pelvic fascia, which support the pelvic organs, can result in prolapse of the pelvic organs,
e.g., vaginal or rectal prolapse.

Ureters
Cross pelvic brim at the level of sacroiliac joint, anterior to the bifurcation common iliac artery to pierce the posterior surface of the bladder
Enters the posterolateral surface of the bladder and runs obliquely through the bladder wall, creating a flap valve
In males: the ureter passes under the ductus deferens, superior to the seminal vesicles
In women: the ureter descends posterior to the ovary and into the base of the broad ligament passing under the uterine artery ("water under
the bridge")
Supplied by branches of common and internal iliac arteries and uterine artery (inferior vesicle artery in males) and drained by veins with
same names.
Innervated by fibers from adjacent autonomic plexuses
Urinary Bladder
General structure
Lies posterior to pubic bones and pubic symphysis
When empty is tetrahedron in shape and lies entirely within true pelvic cavity; spherical when full and may reach as high as umbilicus
When empty has a base (posterior surface) and a superior and two inferolateral surfaces.
Base (posterior surface) of bladder defined internally by two ureteric openings at superolateral corners and internal urethral opening
inferiorly
Triangular area defined by these openings is the vesicle trigone
Ridge between two urethral openings is the interureteric fold
Neck of bladder is where base and inferolateral sides meet, inferiorly
Anterior angle or apex is site of attachment of urachus-fibrous remnant of fetal allantois, which is seen as the median umbilical ligament on
the anterior abdominal wall
Bladder wall is composed of a thick layer of interwoven bundles of smooth muscle running transversely, longitudinally, and obliquely-
detrusor muscle
In region of neck, detrusor muscle runs circularly as involuntary internal sphincter
Bladder mucosa is thrown into rugae except within trigone, which is smooth

Clinical Points
Micturition
The bladder has a capacity of 400 to 500 mL
During micturition coordinated reflexive contraction of the detrusor and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter occur
Controlled by autonomic and visceral innervation
Visceral afferent fibers traveling along tract of parasympathetic fibers stimulated by stretching (and pain in lower bladder)
Parasympathetic innervation via pelvic splanchnic nerves and pelvic plexus reflexively stimulates detrusor contraction during
micturition.
Sympathetic fibers via hypogastric plexus to bladder neck relaxes bladder neck (internal urethral sphincter) and prevents retrograde
ejaculation during micturition in males
page 178
page 179
Clinical Points
Fractures of the Pelvis and Bladder Injury
The bladder lies immediately posterior to the pubic symphysis and fractures of the pubis can be complicated by rupture of the bladder.
The rupture can result in the extravasation of urine intraperitoneally if the peritoneum is torn
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
As a result of a shorter urethra, women are more susceptible to UTIs
Commonly occurs in women following sexual intercourse
Pathogen is commonly Escherichia coli
Infection may lead to urethritis, cystitis, or pyelonephritis (inflammation of urethra, bladder, and kidneys, respectively).
Symptoms include: dysuria, urgency, frequency, and occasionally hematuria
Urinary Stress Incontinence
Factors maintaining continence in the female are the external urethral sphincter (striated muscle surrounding middle third of urethra) and
support of the bladder and urethra by the levator ani muscles
Urinary stress incontinence is an involuntary loss of urine that occurs during coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting, or exercise, because of
the inability of these muscles to counter the increase in intra-abdominal pressure.
Urinary stress incontinence is often seen in women who have had multiple pregnancies and vaginal childbirths and in men following
prostate surgery
About 50% of all women have occasional urinary incontinence

Uterus
Basic structure
page 180
page 181
Pear-shaped organ
Approximately 8 cm long and 5 cm wide
Supported by the pelvic diaphragm
Composed of
Body (corpus) -upper two thirds
Fundus-rounded upper part superior to the entrances of the uterine tubes
Isthmus-narrower area just above the cervix
Cervix (neck) -cylindrical inferior part that projects into the superior vagina
Uterine cavity is small (6 cm in length) and slit-like
Uterine horns are superolateral regions where the uterine (Fallopian tubes) enter
Uterine wall has three layers
Perimetrium-outer layer of peritoneum with underlying connective tissue
Myometrium-middle, thick layer of smooth muscle
Endometrium-vascular inner mucosal layer the thickness of which varies with menstrual cycle and age
The uterus has two surfaces: anteroinferior and posterosuperior
A portion of the cervix, body, and fundus of the uterus is covered with peritoneum
Cervix
Thick-walled canal, 2.5 cm long, connecting the body of the uterus with the vagina
Communicates superiorly via internal os with uterus
Communicates with vagina inferiorly via external os
Approximately half of the cervix lies above the vagina (supravaginal) and is covered posteriorly with the peritoneum of the rectouterine
pouch
The bladder is separated from the anterior surface of the supravaginal part of the cervix by connective tissue
The lower half of the cervix (vaginal part) protrudes into the vagina and can be examined clinically
Relationships of the uterus
Laterally-
Broad ligament, transverse cervical (cardinal ligaments), ureters
 
286 / 425

Anterior-
Vesicouterine pouch, superior surface of bladder
Posterior-
Rectouterine pouch and anterior surface of rectum, loops of intestine in pouch
Vascular supply of uterus (including cervix)
Arterial
Uterine arteries (branches of internal iliac arteries)
Vaginal arteries (branches of uterine arteries with anastomoses with internal pudendal arteries)
Venous drainage: via uterine venous plexus to internal iliac veins
Lymphatics drain to
External iliac nodes
Internal iliac and sacral nodes
Superficial inguinal nodes (along round ligament)
Innervation
From the uterovaginal plexus, a subdivision of the inferior hypogastric (pelvic) plexus
Sympathetic, parasympathetic, and visceral afferents to and from the uterus pass through this plexus
Sympathetic innervation from lower lumbar spinal cord segments via lumbar splanchnic nerves and intermediate plexuses
Parasympathetic innervation from pelvic splanchnic nerves (S2,3,4 spinal cord levels) via pelvic plexus
Afferent fibers with pain information from body and fundus ascend through plexuses to lumbar splanchnic nerves to reach upper
lumber/lower thoracic spinal cord segments
Afferent fibers with pain information from cervix and all information except for pain from body and fundus follow parasympathetic fibers back
to central nervous system
Vagina
Basic structure
Muscular tube, 8 to 10 cm long
Superior end surrounds the cervix: upper two thirds lie within pelvic cavity
Slopes downward and forward through the pelvic diaphragm
Opens inferiorly into vestibule between labia minora
Lining has multiple transverse folds-rugae
Recessed area of vagina around the cervix is called the vaginal fornix; composed of shallow anterior, deep posterior, and lateral fornices
Posterior fornix directly related to rectouterine pouch
Relationships of the vagina
Superior
External os cervix
Inferior
Vestibule between labia minora
Anterior
Posterior wall bladder
Posterior
Rectouterine pouch
Ampulla of rectum
Lateral
Levator ani muscles
Blood supply
Uterine arteries supplies superior part
Vaginal arteries supply middle part
Lower part supplied by middle rectal and internal pudendal arteries
Venous drainage
Vaginal venous plexus to uterine venous plexus to internal iliac veins
Innervation
Upper three fourths same as uterus
Lower one fourth is somatic via the pudendal nerve
Visceral and sympathetic fibers reach the lower one fourth via the pudendal nerve; no parasympathetics
Variations in Position of the Uterus
When the bladder is empty, body of the uterus bent anteriorly on the cervix: anteflexion
Axis of cervix also bent forward relative to axis of vagina: anteversion
Thus the body of uterus lies on superior surface bladder
Full bladder reduces these angles
Reversal of these angles is called retroversion and retroflexion
Ligaments Associated with the Uterus
Broad ligament
Double layer of peritoneum that sweeps up and over the uterus, ovaries, and the uterine tubes
Thus has an anterior and a posterior lamina
Extends from the sides of the uterus to the lateral pelvic walls
 
287 / 425

Part that suspends the ovary from the posterior lamina is the mesovarium
Part of broad ligament above the level of the ovary and mesovarium that sweeps over the uterine tubes is the mesosalpinx
Part of broad ligament below the mesovarium or the mesentery of the uterus
Uterine arteries and veins run medially from the internal iliac arteries to the uterus at its base
Encloses the plexus of uterine veins
Ligament of the ovary
Extends from the medial pole of ovary to the lateral wall of the uterus, just beneath the entrance of the uterine tube, on each side
Remnant of proximal part of embryonic gubernaculums
page 182
page 183
Round ligament of the uterus
Extends from the lateral wall of the uterus, just beneath the entrance of the uterine tube, to the lateral pelvic wall on each side

Approximately 10 cm long, extending laterally from the uterine horns to the peritoneal cavity near the ovaries
Run in free upper border of broad ligament (mesosalpinx)
Provide a channel for ova from ovary to uterine cavity and site for fertilization
Divided into four parts for descriptive and functional purposes
Infundibulum
Horn-shaped distal end
Opens into peritoneal cavity
Has finger-like processes (fimbriae) at distal end that spread over surface of ovary

Clinical Points
page 184
page 185
The thickness of the endometrium (vascular mucosal lining) changes throughout the menstrual cycle, undergoing thickening and shedding.
Following menopause the uterus and vagina undergo atrophy
Because the upper two thirds of the vagina lie within the pelvic cavity, weakness of the pelvic floor muscles can lead to vaginal prolapse.
The lumen of fallopian tubes communicates with the peritoneal cavity at its distal (ovarian) end.
The ovary is covered only by a thin layer of mesothelium, an extension of the mesovarium, to permit ovulation of the mature ovum into the
peritoneal cavity.
Ectopic pregnancies are therefore possible within the peritoneum.
Fertilization of an ovum usually occurs within the fallopian tubes at the ampulla (the widest part)
Ectopic pregnancies-implantation of a blastocyst other than in the uterine wall-can occur in the uterine tube (tubal pregnancy-most common
ectopic pregnancy), into the ovary (ovarian pregnancy-rare) or into the abdominal wall (peritoneal pregnancy-very rare)
Blockage of the uterine tubes as the result of disease is a common cause of infertility
Clinical Points
Cervical Cancer
Common between age 40 and 60 years
Was the leading cause of death of women in the United States until 1940, when detection of malignancies and premalignant conditions
was made possible by the development of Pap (Papanicolaou) smears.
Risk factors include: early sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, human papillomavirus infection, and smoking
Eighty-five percent to 90% are squamous cell carcinomas; 10% to 15% are adenocarcinomas
Fibroids
Benign tumors of smooth muscle cells of uterine myometrium
Occur in 30% all women
Can occur in any location within the uterus
Growth stimulated by estrogen and oral contraceptive pill
Symptoms usually a result of compression effects

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
Urethral rupture may occur spontaneously, or occur as a result of external (fractures of the pelvis, penetrating injury) or internal (following
catheterization or instrumentation) trauma.
Site of urethral rupture determines where urine will extravasate
The superficial perineal fascia is continuous with the deep membranous layer of the superficial fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. If
there is disruption of the spongy urethra, urine may extravasate into the superficial perineal pouch and ascend up the anterior abdominal
wall beneath the deep membranous layer. It will not extend into the anal triangle, because the superficial perineal fascia is tacked down to
the perineal membrane along its posterior margin. It will not extend into the thigh because the superficial perineal fascia is tacked down to
superomedial fascia lata of the thigh.
Penile trauma is rare. Rupture of the tunica albuginea and bleeding into the deep fascia can result in swelling of the penis.

Anatomic Points
Semen contains:
Sperm from the testes: 40 to 600 million per ejaculate but only 10% of total ejaculate
Seminal vesicle secretions: alkaline fluid rich in fructose, 70% of total ejaculate
Prostatic secretions: lipids, acid phosphatase, proteolytic enzymes, citric acid
Other contents: potassium, zinc, citric acid, phosphorylcholine, spermine, free amino acids, and prostaglandins
Mechanism of Ejaculation
Controlled by sympathetic nervous system
Contraction of smooth muscle of ductus deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate propels secretions into prostatic urethra
Simultaneous contraction of smooth muscle in bladder neck prevents retrograde ejaculation (reflux of semen into the bladder)
Semen is expelled from the urethra by contraction of the bulbospongiosus muscles
Clinical Points
Hydrocele
An accumulation of serous fluid in space between parietal and visceral layers of tunica vaginalis
Presents as a fluctuant swelling in the testes
Detection requires transillumination-bright light applied to the swelling presents as a red glow in a darkened room
May be congenital, precipitated by trauma or inflammation of the epididymis

313 / 425

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Anatomic Points
Mechanism of Defecation (Emptying of Bowel)
Occurs as the result of action of the pelvic splanchnic nerves-increase peristaltic action of rectum
Feces move through anal canal
Pressure in rectum causes reflex contraction of external anal sphincter
Contraction of external anal sphincter causes relaxation of peristaltic contraction
External anal sphincter relaxes and defecation occurs
Clinical Points
page 202
page 203
Anal Hemorrhoids (Varicosities)
Can be internal or external
Internal
Are prolapses of mucosal lining containing internal venous plexus
Can prolapse through anal canal, become strangulated by sphincters, and ulcerate
Are painless
External
Are blood clots in external venous plexus
Are painful
Are caused by
Anything that increases intra-abdominal pressure, such as chronic constipation (straining) or pregnancy
Portal hypertension (cirrhosis of the liver)
Varicosities of the venous plexuses are normal
Internal hemorrhages can occur without portal hypertension
Ischiorectal and Perianal Abscesses
A number of potential tissue spaces surround the anal canal and rectum and may become infected because of
Inflammation of anal sinuses
Extension of an infection from the pelvis
Tear in the mucous membrane of the anal canal
Abscesses are classified according to the space occupied:
submucosal
peri-anal
intersphincteric
ischiorectal
perirectal
Perianal and ischiorectal account for approximately 80% of all abscesses
Rectal prolapse
Eversion of the lower part of the rectum and anal canal
Occurs as a result of weakness of pelvic floor muscles and breakdown of pelvic fascia
Common in elderly (older than 80 years)
More common in women, since perineum is weakened by childbirth
Digital Rectal Examination
Performed with patient in left lateral position
Perianal region is initially inspected for fistulae, fissures, skin tags, and prolapsed hemorrhoids
Ninety percent of rectal cancers palpable
Surfaces of sacrum and coccyx and ischial spines and tuberosities can be palpated
Enlarged internal iliac lymph nodes and ischiorectal (ischioanal abscesses can also be palpated)
In men: prostate and seminal vesicles can be palpated anteriorly
In women: cervix can be palpated anteriorly

Autonomic nerves
Sympathetic innervation
Sympathetic trunks
Contain fibers from lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal segments
Descend on posterior abdominal wall on either side of the vertebral bodies
Descend behind common iliac artery, in front of sacrum and piriformis muscle
Fuse on anterior surface of coccyx as ganglion impar
Are source of sacral splanchnic nerves that join inferior hypogastric (pelvic) plexus in pelvis
Contain either postsynaptic fibers from synapses in ganglia superiorly or pre- synaptic fibers that will synapse in one of four
sympathetic ganglia in pelvis
Primary function is to send postsynaptic fibers to sacral spinal nerves via grey rami communicantes
No white rami communicantes associated with sacral sympathetic trunks because sympathetic outflow is thoracolumbar
Lumbar splanchnics join superior hypogastric plexus
Superior hypogastric plexus
Is located just below the bifurcation of the aorta
Is a continuation of the intermesenteric/aortic plexus
Contains no parasympathetic fibers
Contains visceral afferents ascending from the pelvis
Continues into the pelvis as loose collections of fibers in either side of the anterior sacrum = right and left hypogastric nerves
Spreads out in pelvis as inferior hypogastric (pelvic) plexus
Functions
Vasomotor, pilomotor, secretory to sweat glands to skin of perineum and lower limb
Controls ejaculation (in males)
Innervates smooth muscle of blood vessels in pelvis and smooth muscle of some organs
Parasympathetic innervation
From pelvic splanchnic nerves
Outflow from 2nd to 4th sacral spinal cord segment

FACTS & HINTS
High-Yield Facts
Clinical Points
The obturator nerve and vessels cross the floor of the ovarian fossa; therefore, ovarian disease such as malignancy can present with
referred pain to the medial aspect of the thigh.
After a radical prostatectomy (removal of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and periprostatic tissue) for localized prostate cancer, erectile
dysfunction can occur, because of inadvertent damage of the cavernous nerves (nervi erigentes), the parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic
plexus that govern erection.
Clinical Points
Pudendal Nerve Block
Performed to relieve perineal pain during childbirth
Anesthetic agent is injected into tissues around pudendal nerve
Injection is normally done transvaginally
Physician palpates the ischial spine and uses his or her fingers to direct the needle so that the anesthetic is injected in the region of the
ischial spine, where the pudendal nerve wraps around it to enter the lesser sciatic foramen
Pudendal blocks do not relieve the pain of contractions
Mnemonics
Memory Aids
S 2, 3, 4 keeps the
poo off the floor
Defecation is controlled by parasympathetic fibers to the rectum and anal canal from the pelvic splanchnic
nerves via the pelvic plexus. These nerves arise from S2, S3, and S4 spinal cord levels.

FACTS & HINTS
HIGH-YIELD FACTS
Anatomic Points
Functional Overview
The upper limb is highly mobile and characterized by its ability to perform a wide range of controlled movements to manipulate the surrounding
environment. It is suspended from the trunk at the shoulder, and its stability has been sacrificed to gain mobility. Clinically the limb is divided into
four regions: pectoral girdle, arm, forearm and hand.
Upper Limb Development
The upper limb buds from the embryonic trunk and rotates 90 degrees laterally, such that in the anatomic position, the ventral structures face
anteriorly and the dorsal structures posteriorly. This contrasts with the medial rotation of the lower limb. Thus, the upper and lower limbs are 180
degrees out of phase. Flexors of all joints in the upper limb are anterior, and extensors are posterior.
Clinical Points
Winged Scapula
Normally the scapula is held closely against the posterior thoracic wall. Damage to the long thoracic nerve to serratus anterior (which
courses superficially over the muscle) causes "winging" of the scapula as its medial border lifts away from the thorax when the arm is
raised. This is accentuated when the individual leans on the hand or pushes the upper limb against a wall. Most importantly, the arm cannot
be abducted above the horizontal plane because glenoid cavity cannot be rotated upward without the action of the serratus anterior.

FACTS & HINTS
HIGH-YIELD FACTS
Clinical Points
page 218
page 219
Fracture of the Clavicle
Common, especially in children
Usually results from a fall on outstretched hand or direct trauma to the shoulder
Fractures of middle third are most frequently seen
Sternocleidomastoid muscle pulls the proximal fragment superiorly and the shoulder pulls the distal fragment inferiorly
Small lump may remain after the clavicle has healed
Calcific Supraspinatus Tendonitis
Inflammation and calcification of the subacromial bursa resulting in pain, tenderness and limitation of movement of the shoulder joint
Calcium deposits frequently also seen in the supraspinatus tendon
Pain is especially severe with the arm abducted between 50 to 130 degrees (the painful arc) as the supraspinatus tendon is in contact with
the inferior surface of the acromion here
Shoulder Dislocation
High mobility and instability of the glenohumeral joint leads to frequent dislocation
95% of dislocations are in anteroinferior direction, caused by excessive extension and lateral rotation of humerus (e.g., in the throwing
motion)
Humeral head places stress on joint capsule, which may be torn anteriorly, with elements of the rotator cuff
Axillary and musculocutaneous nerves may also be injured
Posterior dislocation is uncommon, but may occur during epileptic seizure or electrocution
Rotator Cuff Injury
Musculotendinous rotator cuff may be damaged by trauma or degenerative disease
One or more of tendons may be torn when the arm is forcefully abducted, leading to pain in the anterosuperior aspect of the shoulder
Supraspinatus tendon is most commonly involved in degenerative tendonitis
Leads patient's arm to drop suddenly at approximately 90-degree abduction, when instructed to lower it slowly from a fully abducted position

Fracture of the Humerus
Fractures of the humerus most common at the surgical neck
Especially common in elderly individuals with osteoporotic bone, falling on an outstretched arm
The axillary nerve vulnerable to damage here
Direct blow to the arm may
Fracture humerus through its midshaft, with risk of injury to the radial nerve
Fracture humerus at distal end, risking damage to the median nerve
Biceps Tendonitis
Is inflammation of the tendon of the long head of the biceps
Tendon is susceptible to wear and tear as it moves back and forth within the intertubercular groove
Degenerative wear a common cause of shoulder pain
Inflammation also caused by repetitive microtrauma, seen in certain sports such as tennis
Rupture of the Biceps Brachii
This produces "Popeye deformity" with muscle forming a ball in distal part of the anterior arm
Tendon of long head has the highest rate of spontaneous rupture of any tendon in the body
Rupture of the tendon on background of chronic tendonitis usually affects those older than 40
Traumatic rupture may occur in younger individuals, but is rare

FACTS & HINTS
HIGH-YIELD FACTS
Clinical Points
Subluxation of the Radial Head (Nursemaid Elbow)
Caused by sudden pulling on the upper limb with the forearm pronated
Distal attachment of the annular ligament is torn and radial head slips out, trapping the ligament between it and the capitulum
Preschool children, especially girls, most vulnerable
Head of radius is repositioned by supinating forearm fully and then flexing elbow
Bursitis of the Elbow
Repeated pressure or friction on a bursa may cause it to become inflamed and tender
Subcutaneous olecranon bursitis ("student's elbow") most common, often occurring in students (from resting elbows on desk), darts
players and from falls and abrasions to the elbow
Subtendinous olecranon bursitis less common, as is bicipitoradial bursitis
Epicondylitis
Activities involving repetitive movements of wrist may lead to localized elbow pain
Repeated extension of wrist causes lateral epicondylitis ("tennis elbow")-microtrauma of common extensor muscle origin, with pain felt over
the lateral aspect of the elbow
Medial epicondylitis ("golfer's elbow") from repeated wrist flexion, with pain felt over the medial epicondyle, especially on resisted wrist
flexion
Bursitis or synovitis may coexist with epicondylitis

Biaxial synovial joint
Located at a line joining the styloid processes of the radius and ulna
Articulation of distal end of radius and articular disc of radioulnar joint with the proximal row of carpal bones (except the pisiform)
Fibrous capsule surrounds the wrist
From distal ends of radius and ulna to proximal row of carpal bones
Lined by a synovial membrane with numerous folds
Movements
Flexion/extension
Abduction/adduction (radial/ulnar abduction)

Bones (27)
Carpal bones (bones of the wrist or carpus)
Proximal row: Scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform,
Distal row: Trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate
Metacarpals (5) consist of
 
364 / 425

Base (proximal)-articulate with distal row of carpal bones
Body
Head (distal)-articulate with proximal phalanges and form knuckles
Phalanges (14)
Each digit has three phalanges: proximal, middle, and distal, except for
Thumb (has two)
Each phalanx has a base (proximal), body, and head (distal)
Decrease in size from proximal to distal
Major Joints of the Hand
Carpometacarpal, metacarpophalangeal, and interphalangeal are all synovial joints supplied by branches of adjacent vessels and nerves
Intercarpal joints
Joints between carpal bones of first row and joints between carpal bones of second row
Midcarpal joint between first and second rows
Supported by anterior, posterior, and interosseous ligaments
Function as a single unit
Small gliding movements between carpal bones
Carpometacarpal joints
Plane type synovial joints, except for carpometacarpal of thumb (saddle type)
Medial four carpometacarpal joints in one fibrous joint capsule
Separate capsule for thumb
Joint for thumb between the trapezium and first metacarpal
Allows flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, circumduction, and opposition
Loose joint capsule allows for free movement
Metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP)
Heads of metacarpals articulate with base of proximal phalanx
Deep transverse metacarpal ligaments hold heads of metacarpals 2 through 5 together
Separate joint capsule for each joint
Movements: flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction
Because the collateral ligaments tighten during flexion, abduction, and adduction are only possible in the extended position
Interphalangeal joints
Proximal interphalangeal joint = PIP
Distal interphalangeal joint = DIP
Allow flexion and extension
Fascia of the Hand
Extensor and flexor retinaculum continuous with antebrachial fascia
Palmar fascia thickened centrally as the palmar aponeurosis
Four distinct extensions to the bases of the fingers
Continuous with the fibrous tendon sheaths
Anchored tightly to skin of palm by numerous ligamentous bands (retinacula cutis)
Fibrous digital sheaths surround synovial sheaths that enclose superficial and deep flexor tendons
Medial fibrous septum extends from medial border of palmar aponeurosis to fifth metacarpal
Lateral fibrous septum extends from lateral border of palmar aponeurosis to third metacarpal
Septa create compartments within the palm

Anatomic Points
Arterial Arches of the Hand
Superficial palmar arch
Formed from main terminal branch of ulnar artery
Enters hand between hook of hamate and pisiform bone
Superficial to flexor retinaculum
Divides into superficial palmar arch and deep branch of ulnar artery
Gives rise to three common palmar digital arteries
Anatomose with palmar metacarpal arteries
Gives rise to two proper palmar digital arteries to sides of digits 2 through 4
Deep palmar arch
Formed from terminal branch of radial artery
Passes from anatomical snuff box on dorsum of hand
Runs between heads of first dorsal interosseus muscle to reach palm
Anastomoses with deep branch of ulnar artery
Gives off three palmar metacarpal arteries (anastomose with common palmar digital arteries from superficial arch)
Gives off princeps pollicis artery to supply palmar surface and lateral sides of thumb

Structures in floor of snuff box
Radial artery
Radial styloid process proximally
Base of first metacarpal distally
Scaphoid and trapezium between radial styloid and first metacarpal
Clinical Points
Colles' Fracture
Complete transverse fracture within the distal 2 cm of the radius
Distal fragment displaced dorsally, giving the classic "dinner fork deformity"
Ulnar styloid may also be avulsed
Results from forced dorsiflexion of the hand, such as in breaking a fall with an outstretched, pronated hand
Most common fracture in adults older than 50 years old
Seen most frequently in elderly women
Healing usually good as the bone has a rich blood supply
Scaphoid Fracture
Scaphoid is the most commonly fractured bone of the carpus
Proximal pole of the bone has a poor blood supply and as a result, fracture may take several months to heal
This increases risk of avascular necrosis and subsequent degenerative joint disease at the wrist
Fracture often difficult to spot on initial radiographs, which should be repeated at 2 to 3 weeks in any patient presenting with a severely
sprained wrist
Dupuytren's Contracture
Progressive fibronodular thickening of the palmar fascia
Leads to fixed flexion deformity of the fingers (most commonly the fourth and fifth digits)
Condition often bilateral and usually affects middle-aged males of Northern European decent, suggesting hereditary predisposition
Risk factors include alcohol, liver disease, and antiepileptic medication
Treatment is surgical

Brachial Plexus Injury
Disease, trauma or excessive stretching (because of birth trauma) of the posterior triangle of the neck or axilla may damage brachial plexus
Results in paralysis and anaesthesia in the distribution of the affected nerves
Various terms used to describe the different lesions
Erb's palsy affects areas supplied by nerves from superior part of the plexus
Klumpke's palsy affects areas supplied by nerves from the inferior part
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
A result of compression of the median nerve as it passes under flexor retinaculum
Compression caused by any process that significantly reduces the size of the carpal tunnel: inflammation of the synovial sheaths, fluid
retention, and infection
Pain or paraesthesia felt in the lateral 3½ digits, may radiate toward the elbow and is often worse at night
Also loss of sensation and diminished control of the median nerve-innervated muscles
Surgical division of the flexor retinaculum may be necessary to relieve symptoms
Ulnar Nerve Injury
Ulnar nerve may be compressed as it passes behind medial epicondyle of the humerus or through the Guyon canal at the wrist
Pain and/or paraesthesia felt at medial aspect of the elbow radiating to the medial forearm and medial 1½ digits
Also may be weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the hand
Radial Nerve Injury
Palsy of the radial nerve common after prolonged pressure on the back of the arm by resting it against a hard surface (such as back of
movie theater seat-the "Saturday night palsy")
Nerve may also be injured in fractures of humerus as it winds along spiral groove
Extensors of the wrist are paralyzed, resulting in a wrist drop
Triceps not affected unless the nerve is injured proximally in the axilla

The lower limb supports the body weight and permits locomotion. It is firmly attached through the rigid pelvis to the vertebral column. The joints are
relatively stable and influenced by the line of gravity; this line passes posterior to the hip joint, anterior to the knee, and anterior to the ankle. Thus
only the calf muscles need to contract to maintain an upright posture. Clinically the limb is divided into four compartments: gluteal, thigh, leg and
foot.
page 243
page 244
Lower Limb Development
The general plan of the lower limb is similar to the upper limb; however, during development the lower limb undergoes medial rotation, bringing the
extensors of the knee, ankle and toes anteriorly with the knee pointing forwards. The hip is unaffected, so hip flexors remain anterior and the
extensors posterior.
Clinical Points
Varicose Veins
Dilated superficial veins most commonly seen in the posteromedial parts of the lower limb
Result from absent or faulty valves in the communicating veins between the deep and superficial venous systems of the limb
Secondary failure of the saphenofemoral valve may occur
Stagnation of blood in these vessels predisposes to thrombosis and subsequent inflammation = thrombophlebitis

FACTS & HINTS
HIGH-YIELD FACTS
Anatomic Points
Hip Joint
The hip joint is a stable ball and socket joint that carries the whole body weight. Its stability results from the snug fit of the large femoral head and
deep acetabulum, which is supported on all sides by powerful intrinsic ligaments and muscles. There is a tendency for the trunk to tilt backwards at
the hip joints, because the line of gravity passes posteriorly; the powerful iliofemoral ligament resists this.
Clinical Points
Femoral Hernia
Occur when part of an abdominal viscus or fat protrudes into the femoral canal through its opening, the femoral ring
More common in women because of wider femoral ring
Present as a mass (often tender) inferolateral to the pubic tubercle
May enlarge by passing through the saphenous opening
Are at a high risk of strangulation because of hard margins of femoral ring
Surgical reduction and repair is usually necessary
Fractured Neck of Femur ("Broken hip")
Common in the elderly, particularly women with osteoporotic bone
Can occur as the result of high impact accident, such as head-on car collision
May damage branches of medial circumflex femoral artery supplying the femoral head
Results in bleeding into the hip joint and avascular necrosis of the head of the femur

* Nerve = Femoral, but it does not descend with the femoral artery and vein in the femoral sheath. It travels on the surface of the iliopsoas muscle.
The femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve travels beneath the inguinal ligament just lateral to the femoral artery, within the femoral sheath.
** Empty space = Femoral canal, because it is a potential space filled with compressible tissue.
*** The lacunar ligament is the hard medial margin of the femoral ring; it is an expansion of the inguinal ligament. Filling the gap between the
attachment of the inguinal ligament to the pubic tubercle and the pecten pubis, posteriorly.

FACTS & HINTS
HIGH-YIELD FACTS
Clinical Points
Baker's Cyst
Posterior herniation of the synovial membrane through the joint capsule into the popliteal fossa
Swelling appears below joint line and may extend as far as the midcalf
Large swellings may interfere with knee movements but otherwise asymptomatic
Bursitis
Inflammation of the bursa surrounding the knee because of repeated frictional forces
In chronic inflammation, bursae become distended and filled with fluid
Prepatellar bursitis (housemaid's knee) and infrapatellar bursitis (clergyman's knee) are most recognized variants
Knee Injury
Knee injuries common, as the knee joint has little external supportive tissue
Ligament sprains usually self-limiting, but may cause secondary damage to menisci
Tearing of the ligaments often needs surgical correction
Rupture of anterior cruciate ligament occurs when force is directed anteriorly to the semi-flexed knee, typically occurring in skiers and
footballers
Posterior cruciate ligament is more resilient to injury, but may rupture when force is applied to the tibial tuberosity while the knee is flexed
Collateral ligaments are vulnerable to lateral stresses

Compartment Syndrome
Abnormally high pressure within one of the leg's restricted compartments
Caused by hemorrhage, edema, or inflammation of the muscles of the leg, often secondary to trauma or deep vein thrombosis
Increased compartmental pressure causes ischemia and nerve damage
May lead to permanent injury of distal structures supplied by effected arteries and veins
Management is surgical: fasciotomy and debridement of any necrotic tissue
Shin Splints (tibialis anterior strain)
Edema and pain over distal two thirds of the tibia
Caused by repetitive microtrauma to the tibialis anterior muscle
Common in athletic overexertion
Often in persons who do not exercise, when they try a long distance walk
A mild form of anterior compartment syndrome
Chronic condition can cause periostitis and bone remodeling, or lead to stress fractures
Ruptured Achilles' Tendon
Tendonitis of the calcaneal tendon
A common running injury
Rupture of the tendon usually occurs in untrained middle-aged individuals with a history of tendonitis
Presents as sudden calf pain with an audible snap and subsequent inability to plantarflex the foot
Gap is palpable in complete rupture

FACTS & HINTS
HIGH-YIELD FACTS
Clinical Points
Ankle Sprain
As a result of tears in fibers of ligaments supporting the ankle
Commonly the result of forced inversion of foot causing strain on weaker lateral ligaments
Anterior talofibular ligament most likely to tear
Result in instability of ankle joint
Calcaneofibular ligament may also be torn
Ankle Fracture
Severe ankle strain may fracture the medial, or more commonly, the lateral malleolus
A Pott's fracture-dislocation occurs when foot is forcefully everted, shearing off the medial malleolus
Lateral malleolus is then snapped as the talus moves laterally
May also fracture fibula above distal tibiofibular joint and distal end of tibia
Plantar Fasciitis
Microtrauma to proximal attachment of the plantar aponeurosis to the calcaneus, resulting in inflammation of plantar aponeurosis
Caused by repetitive strain on the longitudinal plantar arch, such as during extensive running or high impact aerobics
Pain felt over the proximal plantar surface of the foot
Especially painful after sitting and first thing in the morning
Treatment is conservative with rest and analgesia

FACTS & HINTS
HIGH-YIELD FACTS
Clinical Points
Chronic Arterial Occlusive Disease
Caused by atherosclerosis
In the lower limb, most commonly affects femoral artery as it passes through adductor canal
Symptoms of intermittent claudication (pain in a muscle group because of poor blood supply) brought on by exertion in the early phase; may
progress to pain at rest
Ischemic ulcers can also develop
Patients with advanced disease require vascular surgical intervention with bypass or endarterectomy
Foot Drop
Injury to the common fibular nerve can result in loss of eversion and dorsiflexion of the foot
Foot drops and toes drag on the ground when walking unless high-stepping gait is employed
Variable amount of sensation also lost on the anterolateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of foot
Nerve is vulnerable owing to superficial course as it wraps around fibular neck
Nerve may be severed during fracture of fibula or dislocation of knee joint
Meralgia Paresthetica (Gunslinger's Neuralgia)
Compression of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh against the anterior superior iliac spine
Causes a stinging or burning sensation in the anterolateral thigh
