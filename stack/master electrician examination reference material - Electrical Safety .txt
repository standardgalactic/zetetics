and the employer disagree about the fitness of the worker to return to work: 
1. If the worker has not returned to work with the employer, the Board shall determine whether the worker is 
medically able to perform the essential duties of his or her pre-injury employment or to perform suitable 
work. 
2. If the Board has previously determined that the worker is medically able to perform suitable work, the Board 
shall determine whether the worker is medically able to perform the essential duties of the worker’s pre-
injury employment. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (3). 
Obligation to re-employ 
(4)  When the worker is medically able to perform the essential duties of his or her pre-injury employment, the 
employer shall, 
(a) offer to re-employ the worker in the position that the worker held on the date of injury; or  
(b) offer to provide the worker with alternative employment of a nature and at earnings comparable to the 
worker’s employment on the date of injury. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (4). 
Same 
(5)  When the worker is medically able to perform suitable work (although he or she is unable to perform the 
essential duties of his or her pre-injury employment), the employer shall offer the worker the first opportunity to accept 
suitable employment that may become available with the employer. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (5). 
Duty to accommodate 
(6)  The employer shall accommodate the work or the workplace for the worker to the extent that the

s. 1 (3). 
Construction industry requirements 
(8)  Employers engaged primarily in construction shall comply with such requirements as may be prescribed 
concerning the re-employment of workers who perform construction work.  The application of this subsection is not 
contingent on the length of a worker’s continuous employment as required under subsection (1). Subsections (2), (4) to 
(7) and (10) do not apply with respect to those workers and employers. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (8). 
Transition

workers referred to in subsection (8) despite the repeal of subsection 54 (9). 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (9). 
Effect of termination 
(10)  If an employer re-employs a worker in accordance with this section and then terminates the employment 
within six months, the employer is presumed not to have fulfilled the employer’s obligations under this section.  The 
employer may rebut the presumption by showing that the termination of the worker’s employment was not related to the 
injury. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (10).

may, 
(a) levy a penalty on the employer not exceeding the amount of the worker’s net average earnings for the year 
preceding the injury; and 
(b) make payments to the worker for a maximum of one year as if the worker were entitled to payments under 
section 43 (loss of earnings). 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (13). 
Same 
(14)  A penalty payable under subsection (13) is an amount owing to the Board. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (14). 
Conflict with collective agreement 
(15)  If this section conflicts with a collective agreement that is binding upon the employer and if the employer’s 
obligations under this section afford the worker greater re-employment terms than does the collective agreement, this 
section prevails over the collective agreement.  However, this subsection does not operate to displace the seniority 
provisions of the collective agreement. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (15). 
Emergency workers 
(16)  If an emergency worker is injured, the worker’s deemed employer is not required to comply with this 
section. The worker’s actual employer, if any, is required to do so.  However, the deemed employer is required to pay 
the costs of the actual employer’s compliance with subsection (6). 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 41 (16). 
Certain volunteers

functional abilities and that restores the worker’s pre-injury earnings. 
3. If the worker’s employer is not co-operating in the early and safe return to work of the worker. 1997, c. 16, 
Sched. A, s. 42 (1). 
Labour market re-entry plan 
(2)  Based on the results of the assessment, the Board shall decide if a worker requires a labour market re-entry

determined as of the date the Board makes the decision. 2007, c. 7, Sched. 41, s. 2 (2). 
Calculation of amount 
(5)  The calculation of the amount of the payments is subject to the following rules: 
1. The amount of the net average earnings before the injury must be adjusted by the alternate indexing factor for 
each January 1 since the date of the injury. 
2. The amount described by clause (2) (b) must reflect any disability payments paid to the worker under the 
Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension Plan in respect of the injury. 
3. If the amount described by clause (2) (b) is not zero and does not consist solely of disability payments in 
respect of the injury paid to the worker under the Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension Plan, the 
amount of the payment must be adjusted, 
311

Section 2: Safety Culture 
i. by multiplying, for each January 1 since the date of the injury, the amount of the payment by the sum of 
one plus the general indexing factor expressed as a fraction, and 
ii. by dividing, for each January 1 since the date of the injury, the amount of the payment by the sum of 
one plus the alternate indexing factor expressed as a fraction. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 43 (5). 
Annual adjustment 
(6)  Every year on January 1, the Board shall adjust the amount of the payments otherwise payable to a worker 
using,

payments in respect of the injury paid to the worker under the Canada Pension Plan or the Quebec Pension 
Plan; or 
(b) the general indexing factor in any other case. 1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 43 (6). 
Failure to co-operate 
(7)  The Board may reduce or suspend payments to the worker during any period when the worker is not co-
operating,

under the insurance plan; 
(b) the worker was provided with a labour market re-entry plan and the plan is not completed when the 72-

prejudiced thereby, and then only to the extent of the prejudice suffered. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 6. 
PART II

7.  (1)  All amounts received by an owner, other than the Crown or a municipality, that are to be used in the 
financing of the improvement, including any amount that is to be used in the payment of the purchase price of the land 
and the payment of prior encumbrances, constitute, subject to the payment of the purchase price of the land and prior 
encumbrances, a trust fund for the benefit of the contractor. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 7 (1). 
Amounts certified as payable 
(2)  Where amounts become payable under a contract to a contractor by the owner on a certificate of a payment 
certifier, an amount that is equal to an amount so certified that is in the owner’s hands or received by the owner at any 
time thereafter constitutes a trust fund for the benefit of the contractor. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 7 (2). 
Where substantial performance certified 
(3)  Where the substantial performance of a contract has been certified, or has been declared by the court, an 
amount that is equal to the unpaid price of the substantially performed portion of the contract that is in the owner’s 
hands or is received by the owner at any time thereafter constitutes a trust fund for the benefit of the contractor. R.S.O. 
1990, c. C.30, s. 7 (3). 
Obligations as trustee 
(4)  The owner is the trustee of the trust fund created by subsection (1), (2) or (3), and the owner shall not 
appropriate or convert any part of a fund to the owner’s own use or to any use inconsistent with the trust until the 
contractor is paid all amounts related to the improvement owed to the contractor by the owner. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, 
s. 7 (4). 
Contractor’s and subcontractor’s trust 
Amounts received a trust 
8.  (1)  All amounts, 
(a) owing to a contractor or subcontractor, whether or not due or payable; or 
(b) received by a contractor or subcontractor, 
on account of the contract or subcontract price of an improvement constitute a trust fund for the benefit of the 
subcontractors and other persons who have supplied services or materials to the improvement who are owed amounts by 
the contractor or subcontractor. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 8 (1). 
Obligations as trustee 
(2)  The contractor or subcontractor is the trustee of the trust fund created by subsection (1) and the contractor or 
subcontractor shall not appropriate or convert any part of the fund to the contractor’s or subcontractor’s own use or to 
any use inconsistent with the trust until all subcontractors and other persons who supply services or materials to the 
improvement are paid all amounts related to the improvement owed to them by the contractor or subcontractor. R.S.O. 
1990, c. C.30, s. 8 (2). 
Vendor’s trust 
Amounts received a trust 
9.  (1)  Where the owner’s interest in a premises is sold by the owner, an amount equal to, 
(a) the value of the consideration received by the owner as a result of the sale,  
less, 
381

Section 3: Business Administration 
(b) the reasonable expenses arising from the sale and the amount, if any, paid by the vendor to discharge any 
existing mortgage indebtedness on the premises, 
constitutes a trust fund for the benefit of the contractor. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 9 (1). 
Obligations as trustee 
(2)  The former owner is the trustee of the trust created by subsection (1), and shall not appropriate or convert any 
part of the trust property to the former owner’s own use or to any use inconsistent with the trust until the contractor is 
paid all amounts owed to the contractor that relate to the improvement. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 9 (2). 
Payment discharging trust 
10.  Subject to Part IV (holdbacks), every payment by a trustee to a person the trustee is liable to pay for services 
or materials supplied to the improvement discharges the trust of the trustee making the payment and the trustee’s 
obligations and liability as trustee to all beneficiaries of the trust to the extent of the payment made by the trustee. R.S.O. 
1990, c. C.30, s. 10. 
Where trust funds may be reduced 
11.  (1)  Subject to Part IV, a trustee who pays in whole or in part for the supply of services or materials to an 
improvement out of money that is not subject to a trust under this Part may retain from trust funds an amount equal to 
that paid by the trustee without being in breach of the trust. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 11 (1). 
Application of trust funds to discharge loan 
(2)  Subject to Part IV, where a trustee pays in whole or in part for the supply of services or materials to an 
improvement out of money that is loaned to the trustee, trust funds may be applied to discharge the loan to the extent 
that the lender’s money was so used by the trustee, and the application of trust money does not constitute a breach of the 
trust. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 11 (2). 
Set-off by trustee 
12.  Subject to Part IV, a trustee may, without being in breach of trust, retain from trust funds an amount that, as 
between the trustee and the person the trustee is liable to pay under a contract or subcontract related to the improvement, 
is equal to the balance in the trustee’s favour of all outstanding debts, claims or damages, whether or not related to the 
improvement. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 12. 
Liability for breach of trust 
By corporation 
13.  (1)  In addition to the persons who are otherwise liable in an action for breach of trust under this Part, 
(a) every director or officer of a corporation; and 
(b) any person, including an employee or agent of the corporation, who has effective control of a corporation or 
its relevant activities, 
who assents to, or acquiesces in, conduct that he or she knows or reasonably ought to know amounts to breach of trust 
by the corporation is liable for the breach of trust. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 13 (1). 
Effective control of corporation 
(2)  The question of whether a person has effective control of a corporation or its relevant activities is one of fact 
and in determining this the court may disregard the form of any transaction and the separate corporate existence of any 
participant. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 13 (2). 
Joint and several liability 
(3)  Where more than one person is found liable or has admitted liability for a particular breach of trust under this 
Part, those persons are jointly and severally liable. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 13 (3). 
Contribution 
(4)  A person who is found liable, or who has admitted liability, for a particular breach of a trust under this Part is 
entitled to recover contribution from any other person also liable for the breach in such amount as will result in equal

Section 3: Business Administration 
PART III 
THE LIEN 
Creation of lien 
14.  (1)  A person who supplies services or materials to an improvement for an owner, contractor or 
subcontractor, has a lien upon the interest of the owner in the premises improved for the price of those services or 
materials. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 14 (1). 
Note: Subsection (1) applies to services and materials supplied by architects, holders of certificates of practice 
under the Architects Act and their employees under contracts made on or after November 28, 1997, and under 
subcontracts made under such contracts. See: 1997, c. 23, s. 4 (2). 
No lien for interest 
(2)  No person is entitled to a lien for any interest on the amount owed to the person in respect of the services or 
materials that have been supplied by the person, but nothing in this subsection affects any right that the person may 
otherwise have to recover that interest. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 14 (2). 
When lien arises 
15.  A person’s lien arises and takes effect when the person first supplies services or materials to the 
improvement. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 15. 
Interest of Crown 
16.  (1)  A lien does not attach to the interest of the Crown in a premises. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 16 (1). 
Interest of person other than Crown 
(2)  Where an improvement is made to a premises in which the Crown has an interest, but the Crown is not an 
owner within the meaning of this Act, the lien may attach to the interest of any other person in that premises. R.S.O. 
1990, c. C.30, s. 16 (2). 
Where lien does not attach to premises 
(3)  Where the Crown is the owner of a premises within the meaning of this Act, or where the premises is, 
(a) a public street or highway owned by a municipality; or 
(b) a railway right-of-way, 
the lien does not attach to the premises but constitutes a charge as provided in section 21, and the provisions of this Act 
shall have effect without requiring the registration of a claim for lien against the premises. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, 
s. 16 (3). 
Limitation on value of lien 
17.  (1)  The lien of a person is limited to the amount owing to the person in relation to the improvement and, 
subject to Part IV (holdbacks), it is further limited to the least amount owed in relation to the improvement by a payer to 
the contractor or to any subcontractor whose contract or subcontract was in whole or in part performed by the supply of 
services or materials giving rise to the lien. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 17 (1). 
Idem 
(2)  Subject to Part IV, the total value of the liens of all members of a class, as defined in section 79, is limited to 
the least amount owed in relation to the improvement by a payer to the contractor or to any subcontractor whose contract 
or subcontract was in whole or in part performed by the supply of services or materials made by the members of the 
class. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 17 (2). 
Set-off 
(3)  Subject to Part IV, in determining the amount of a lien under subsection (1) or (2), there may be taken into 
account the amount that is, as between a payer and the person the payer is liable to pay, equal to the balance in the 
payer’s favour of all outstanding debts, claims or damages, whether or not related to the improvement. R.S.O. 1990, 
c. C.30, s. 17 (3). 
Public highway, liability of municipality re 
(4)  Despite subsection (1), where land is dedicated to a municipality as a public street or highway and an 
improvement is made to the land at the written request of, or under an agreement with, the municipality, but not at its 
expense, the municipality shall nevertheless, on default of payment by the proper payer, be liable to the value of the 
holdbacks under Part IV that would have been required were the improvement made at the expense of the municipality, 
and the procedure for making a claim under this subsection shall be the same as for enforcing a claim for lien against a 
municipality in respect of a public street or highway. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 17 (4). 
383

Section 3: Business Administration 
Joint or common interests 
18.  Where the interest of the owner in the premises is held jointly or in common with another person who knew 
or ought reasonably to have known of the making of the improvement, the joint or common interest in the premises of 
that person is also subject to the lien unless the contractor receives actual notice, before the supply of services or 
materials to the improvement is commenced, that the person having the joint or common interest assumes no 
responsibility for the improvement to be made. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 18. 
Where owner’s interest leasehold 
19.  (1)  Where the interest of the owner to which the lien attaches is leasehold, the interest of the landlord shall 
also be subject to the lien to the same extent as the interest of the owner if the contractor gives the landlord written 
notice of the improvement to be made, unless the landlord, within fifteen days of receiving the notice from the 
contractor, gives the contractor written notice that the landlord assumes no responsibility for the improvement to be 
made. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 19 (1). 
Forfeiture or termination of lease, effect of 
(2)  No forfeiture of a lease to, or termination of a lease by, a landlord, except for non-payment of rent, deprives 
any person having a lien against the leasehold of the benefit of the person’s lien. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 19 (2). 
Notice to lien claimants 
(3)  Where a landlord intends to enforce forfeiture or terminate a lease of the premises because of non-payment of 
rent, and there is a claim for lien registered against the premises in the proper land registry office, the landlord shall give 
notice in writing of the intention to enforce forfeiture or terminate the lease and of the amount of the unpaid rent to each 
person who has registered a claim for lien against the premises. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 19 (3). 
Payment of unpaid rent 
(4)  A person receiving notice under subsection (3) may, within ten days thereafter, pay to the landlord the 
amount of the unpaid rent, and the amount so paid may be added by that person to the person’s claim for lien. R.S.O. 
1990, c. C.30, s. 19 (4). 
General lien, more than one premises 
20.  (1)  Where an owner enters into a single contract for improvements on more than one premises of the owner, 
any person supplying services or materials under that contract, or under a subcontract under that contract, may choose to 
have the person’s lien follow the form of the contract and be a general lien against each of those premises for the price 
of all services and materials the person supplied to all the premises. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 20 (1). 
Where subs. (1) does not apply 
(2)  Subsection (1) does not apply and no general lien arises under or in respect of a contract that provides in 
writing that liens shall arise and expire on a lot-by-lot basis. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 20 (2). 
Lien a charge 
21.  The lien of a person is a charge upon the holdbacks required to be retained by Part IV, and subject to 
subsection 17 (3), any additional amount owed in relation to the improvement by a payer to the contractor or to any 
subcontractor whose contract or subcontract was in whole or in part performed by the supply of services or materials 
giving rise to the lien. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 21. 
PART IV 
HOLDBACKS 
Holdbacks 
Basic holdback 
22.  (1)  Each payer upon a contract or subcontract under which a lien may arise shall retain a holdback equal to 
10 per cent of the price of the services or materials as they are actually supplied under the contract or subcontract until 
all liens that may be claimed against the holdback have expired as provided in Part V, or have been satisfied, discharged 
or provided for under section 44 (payment into court). R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 22 (1). 
Separate holdback for finishing work 
(2)  Where the contract has been certified or declared to be substantially performed but services or materials 
remain to be supplied to complete the contract, the payer upon the contract, or a subcontract, under which a lien may 
arise shall retain, from the date certified or declared to be the date of substantial performance of the contract, a separate 
holdback equal to 10 per cent of the price of the remaining services or materials as they are actually supplied under the 
contract or subcontract, until all liens that may be claimed against the holdback have expired as provided in Part V, or 
have been satisfied, discharged or provided for under section 44. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 22 (2).

Personal liability of owner 
23.  (1)  Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), an owner is personally liable for holdbacks that the owner is 
required to retain under this Part to those lien claimants who have valid liens against the owner’s interest in the 
premises. R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30, s. 23 (1).

c. C.30, s. 23 (2).

deemed to be a payment by the owner, contractor or subcontractor to the proper payer of that person, but no such

certify the substantial performance of the contract by signing a certificate in the prescribed form. If there is 
no payment certifier, the owner and contractor shall make the determination jointly and shall both sign the 
certificate. 
2. The payment certifier or the owner and the contractor jointly, as the case may be, shall set out in the 
certificate the date on which the contract was substantially performed.

any person may apply to the court, and the court, upon being satisfied that the contract is substantially 
performed, and upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it considers fit, may declare that the contract has 
been substantially performed, and the declaration has the same force and effect as a certificate of substantial 
performance of the contract. 
8. Unless the court otherwise orders, the day the declaration is made shall be deemed to be the date the contract 
was substantially performed. 
9. The person who applied to the court shall publish a copy of the declaration of substantial performance once in

are not. 
4. A representation that the goods are new, or unused, if they are not or are reconditioned or reclaimed, but the 
reasonable use of goods to enable the person to service, prepare, test and deliver the goods does not result in 
the goods being deemed to be used for the purposes of this paragraph.

consumers;

55.  (1)  For the purpose of the definition of ―annual percentage rate‖ in section 66 of the Act,

(i) the credit agreement does not provide for interest to be calculated more frequently than the frequency 
with which scheduled payments are required to be made by the borrower, and 
(ii) there is no cost of borrowing, other than interest, in connection with the credit agreement; and

(b) principal does not include any portion of the cost of borrowing, and no portion of the accumulated cost of 
borrowing shall be included in the principal balance outstanding at any time; 
(c) each payment by the borrower in connection with the credit agreement shall be considered to be applied first 
against the accumulated cost of borrowing and then, to the extent that the payment exceeds the accumulated 
cost of borrowing, against the outstanding principal balance; and 
(d) applying the following formula in respect of each interest calculation period shall yield a result that is equal 
to the cost of borrowing for that period, 
APR/100 × L × P 
in which, 
―APR‖ is the annual percentage rate, 
―L‖ is the length of the interest calculation period as a fraction of a year, and 
―P‖ is the principal balance outstanding at the end of the interest calculation period before applying any 
payment due by the borrower.

O. Reg. 96/09, s. 4. 
(4)  If a credit agreement provides for payments to be made at intervals measured by reference to weeks or 
months, the annual percentage rate for the credit agreement may be calculated on the assumption that each week is 1/52 
of a year long and each month is 1/12 of a year long. O. Reg. 17/05, s. 55 (4). 
(5)  If the annual percentage rate for a credit agreement is required to be calculated when the interest rate for any 
period during the term of the credit agreement is unknown, the annual percentage rate for the credit agreement shall be 
calculated as if the interest rate for that period was to be determined on the basis of circumstances existing at the time of 
the calculation. O. Reg. 17/05, s. 55 (5).

(6)  The annual percentage rate for a credit agreement for fixed credit that does not provide for scheduled 
payments by the borrower shall be calculated on the assumption that the outstanding balance will be repaid in full in a 
single payment at the end of the term of the credit agreement. O. Reg. 17/05, s. 55 (6). 
(7)  The annual percentage rate for a renewed credit agreement shall be calculated on the assumption that the 
borrower receives, on the renewal date, an advance equal to the outstanding balance at the end of the term of the credit 
agreement being renewed. O. Reg. 17/05, s. 55 (7). 
(8)  In subsections (3) to (7), the references to the calculation of the annual percentage rate include the calculation 
of any amount that is required to be calculated in order to calculate the annual percentage rate. O. Reg. 17/05, s. 55 (8).

within one-eighth of one per cent of the annual percentage rate calculated in accordance with this section. O. Reg. 17/05, 
s. 55 (9).

established by this agreement, notify the other party in writing of its desire to submit the difference or

(17) Where an arbitrator or arbitration board determines that an employee has been discharged or otherwise 
disciplined by an employer for cause and the collective agreement does not contain a specific penalty for the infraction 
that is the subject-matter of the arbitration, the arbitrator or arbitration board may substitute such other penalty for the

OPERATION OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS 
Certain agreements not to be treated as collective agreements 
53.  An agreement between an employer or an employers’ organization and a trade union shall be deemed not to

Sched. A, s. 53. 
Discrimination prohibited 
54.  A collective agreement must not discriminate against any person if the discrimination is contrary to the

More than one collective agreement prohibited 
55.  There shall be only one collective agreement at a time between a trade union or council of trade unions and

agreement. 1995, c. 1, Sched. A, s. 55. 
Binding effect of collective agreements on employers, trade unions and employees 
56.  A collective agreement is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the employer and upon 
the trade union that is a party to the agreement whether or not the trade union is certified and upon the employees in the 
bargaining unit defined in the agreement. 1995, c. 1, Sched. A, s. 56. 
Binding effect of collective agreements: other 
57.  (1) A collective agreement between an employers’ organization and a trade union or council of trade unions 
is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the employers’ organization and each person who was a 
member of the employers’ organization at the time the agreement was entered into and on whose behalf the employers’ 
organization bargained with the trade union or council of trade unions as if it was made between each of such persons 
and the trade union or council of trade unions and upon the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement, 
and, if any such person ceases to be a member of the employers’ organization during the term of operation of the 
660

Section 3: Business Administration 
agreement, the person shall, for the remainder of the term of operation of the agreement, be deemed to be a party to a 
like agreement with the trade union or council of trade unions. 
Duty to disclose 
(2) When an employers’ organization commences to bargain with a trade union or council of trade unions, it shall 
deliver to the trade union, or council of trade unions a list of the names of the employers on whose behalf it is bargaining 
and, in default of so doing, it shall be deemed to bargain for all members of the employers’ organization for whose 
employees the trade union or council of trade unions is entitled to bargain and to make a collective agreement at that 
time, except an employer who, either alone or through the employers’ organization, has notified the trade union or 
council of trade unions in writing before the agreement was entered into that the employer will not be bound by a 
collective agreement between the employers’ organization and the trade union or council of trade unions. 
Binding effect of collective agreements on members of certified councils 
(3) A collective agreement between a certified council of trade unions and an employer is, subject to and for the 
purposes of this Act, binding upon each trade union that is a constituent union of such a council as if it had been made 
between each of such trade unions and the employer. 
Binding effect of collective agreements on members or affiliates of councils of trade unions 
(4) A collective agreement between a council of trade unions, other than a certified council of trade unions, and 
an employer or an employers’ organization is, subject to and for the purposes of this Act, binding upon the council of 
trade unions and each trade union that was a member of or affiliated with the council of trade unions at the time the 
agreement was entered into and on whose behalf the council of trade unions bargained with the employer or employers’ 
organization as if it was made between each of such trade unions and the employer or employers’ organization, and upon 
the employees in the bargaining unit defined in the agreement and, if any such trade union ceases to be a member of or 
affiliated with the council of trade unions during the term of operation of the agreement, it shall, for the remainder of the 
term of operation of the agreement, be deemed to be a party to a like agreement with the employer or employers’ 
organization, as the case may be. 
Duty to disclose 
(5) Where a council of trade unions, other than a certified council of trade unions, commences to bargain with an 
employer or an employers’ organization, it shall deliver to the employer or employers’ organization a list of the names 
of the trade unions on whose behalf it is bargaining and, in default of so doing, it shall be deemed to bargain for all 
members or affiliates of the council of trade unions for whose employees the respective trade unions are entitled to 
bargain and to make a collective agreement at that time with the employer or the employers’ organization, except a trade 
union that, either by itself or through the council of trade unions, has notified the employer or employer’s organization 
in writing before the agreement is entered into that it will not be bound by a collective agreement between the council of 
trade unions and the employer or employers’ organization. 1995, c. 1, Sched. A, s. 57. 
Minimum term of collective agreements 
58.  (1) If a collective agreement does not provide for its term of operation or provides for its operation for an 
unspecified term or for a term of less than one year, it shall be deemed to provide for its operation for a term of one year 
from the date that it commenced to operate. 
Extension of term of collective agreement 
(2) Despite subsection (1), the parties may, in a collective agreement or otherwise and before or after the 
collective agreement has ceased to operate, agree to continue the operation of the collective agreement or any of its 
provisions for a period of less than one year while they are bargaining for its renewal with or without modifications or 
for a new agreement, but such continued operation does not bar an application for certification or for a declaration that 
the trade union no longer represents the employees in the bargaining unit and the continuation of the collective 
agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days notice to the other party. 
Early termination of collective agreements 
(3) A collective agreement shall not be terminated by the parties before it ceases to operate in accordance with its 
provisions or this Act without the consent of the Board on the joint application of the parties. 
Same 
(4) Despite anything in this section, where an employer joins an employers’ organization that is a party to a 
collective agreement with a trade union or council of trade unions and the employer agrees with the trade union or 
council of trade unions to be bound by the collective agreement between the trade union or council of trade unions and 
the employers’ organization, the agreement ceases to be binding upon the employer and the trade union or council of 
trade unions at the same time as the agreement between the employers’ organization and the trade union or council of 
trade unions ceases to be binding. 
661

Section 3: Business Administration

trade unions sells his, her or its business, the person to whom the business has been sold is, until the Board otherwise 
declares, bound by the collective agreement as if the person had been a party thereto and, where an employer sells his, 
her or its business while an application for certification or termination of bargaining rights to which the employer is a

employer for the purposes of the application as if the person were named as the employer in the application.

666

Section 3: Business Administration 
bargaining agent for the employees of the person to whom the business was sold in the like bargaining unit in that 
business, and the trade union or council of trade unions is entitled to give to the person to whom the business was sold a 
written notice of its desire to bargain with a view to making a collective agreement or the renewal, with or without 
modifications, of the agreement then in operation and such notice has the same effect as a notice under section 16 or 59,

of any of the employees in such business or a trade union or council of trade unions is the bargaining agent of the 
employees in any business carried on by the person to whom the business was sold, and, 
(a) any question arises as to what constitutes the like bargaining unit referred to in subsection (3); or 
(b) any person, trade union or council of trade unions claims that, by virtue of the operation of subsection (2) or 
(3), a conflict exists between the bargaining rights of the trade union or council of trade unions that 
represented the employees of the predecessor employer and the trade union or council of trade unions that 
represents the employees of the person to whom the business was sold, 
the Board may, upon the application of any person, trade union or council of trade unions concerned, 
(c) define the composition of the like bargaining unit referred to in subsection (3) with such modification, if any, 
as the Board considers necessary; and 
(d) amend, to such extent as the Board considers necessary, any bargaining unit in any certificate issued to any 
trade union or any bargaining unit defined in any collective agreement. 
Same

within 60 days after the trade union or council of trade unions has given a notice under subsection (3), terminate the 
bargaining rights of the trade union or council of trade unions bound by the collective agreement or that has given 
notice, as the case may be, if, in the opinion of the Board, the person to whom the business was sold has changed its 
character so that it is substantially different from the business of the predecessor employer. 
Same 
(6) Despite subsections (2) and (3), where a business was sold to a person who carries on one or more other 
businesses and a trade union or council of trade unions is the bargaining agent of the employees in any of the businesses 
and the person intermingles the employees of one of the businesses with those of another of the businesses, the Board 
may, upon the application of any person, trade union or council of trade unions concerned, 
(a) declare that the person to whom the business was sold is no longer bound by the collective agreement 
referred to in subsection (2); 
(b) determine whether the employees concerned constitute one or more appropriate bargaining units; 
(c) declare which trade union, trade unions or council of trade unions, if any, shall be the bargaining agent or 
agents for the employees in the unit or units; and

(7) Where a trade union or council of trade unions is declared to be the bargaining agent under subsection (6) and 
it is not already bound by a collective agreement with the successor employer with respect to the employees for whom it 
is declared to be the bargaining agent, it is entitled to give to the employer a written notice of its desire to bargain with a 
view to making a collective agreement, and the notice has the same effect as a notice under section 16. 
Powers of Board before disposing of application 
(8) Before disposing of any application under this section, the Board may make such inquiry, may require the 
production of such evidence and the doing of such things, or may hold such representation votes, as it considers

(9) Where an application is made under this section, an employer is not required, despite the fact that a notice has 
been given by a trade union or council of trade unions, to bargain with that trade union or council of trade unions 
concerning the employees to whom the application relates until the Board has disposed of the application and has 
667

Section 3: Business Administration 
declared which trade union or council of trade unions, if any, has the right to bargain with the employer on behalf of the 
employees concerned in the application. 
Effect of notice of declaration

municipality, or two or more such municipalities are amalgamated, united or otherwise joined together, or all or part of 
one such municipality is annexed, attached or added to another such municipality, the employees of the municipalities 
concerned shall be deemed to have been intermingled, and, 
(a) the Board may exercise the like powers as it may exercise under subsections (6) and (8) with respect to the 
sale of a business under this section; 
(b) the new or enlarged municipality has the like rights and obligations as a person to whom a business is sold 
under this section and who intermingles the employees of two of the person’s businesses; and

the case of the intermingling of employees in two or more businesses under this section.

union) or 69 (sale of a business), the Board has the powers it would have if an interested party had applied to the Board 
for such a determination and may give such directions as to the conduct of its proceedings as it considers advisable.

project agreement, and 
ii. the proposed project agreement would result in a reduction in the total wages and benefits, expressed as 
a rate, of an employee represented by the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement that is 
larger, proportionally, than the largest reduction that would apply to an employee represented by a 
bargaining agent that gave notice of approval of the project agreement. 
3. In the circumstances described in paragraph 2, the Board shall make an order doing the following, unless the 
Board considers it inappropriate to do so, 
i. amending the proposed project agreement so that no reduction in the total wages and benefits, expressed 
as a rate, of an employee represented by the bargaining agent challenging the project agreement is

bargaining agent that gave notice of approval of the project agreement, and 
ii. declaring that the proposed project agreement, as amended, is in force. 
4. In the circumstances described in paragraph 2, if the Board considers it inappropriate to make an order under 
paragraph 3, the Board may make an order declaring that the proposed project agreement shall not come 
into force.

bargaining agent on the list. 
2. Each applicable provincial agreement, as modified by the project agreement, applies to the construction work 
on the project, even with respect to employers who would not otherwise be bound by the provincial 
agreement. 
3. Subject to the project agreement, if a provincial agreement ceases to apply while the project agreement is in 
effect, the provincial agreement that applied when the project agreement was approved applies to the 
construction work on the project until a new provincial agreement is made. However, this paragraph does 
not apply with respect to provincial agreements that apply to work that the project agreement does not apply 
to. 
4. No employees performing work to which the project agreement applies shall strike and no employer shall 
lock-out such employees while the project agreement is in effect even if a strike is called or authorized 
under subsection 164 (1) or a lock-out is called or authorized under subsection 164 (2). 
5. For greater certainty, paragraph 4 does not affect the right to strike of an employee who performs work to 
which the project agreement does not apply nor does paragraph 4 affect the right of the employer to lock-
out such an employee. 1998, c. 8, s. 21; 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (7).

(c) the employer employs members of the trade union to perform work on a project that is governed by that 
project agreement. 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). 
No certification or voluntary recognition 
(16)  Regardless of whether the work the members of the trade union perform is inside or outside of the 
construction industry, if the circumstances set out in subsection (15) apply, 
(a) the employment of the members of the trade union before the project is completed or abandoned shall not be 
considered in any application for certification by the trade union with respect to the employer; and 
(b) any agreement under which the employer agrees to employ only members of the trade union for that work 
before the project is completed or abandoned but not afterwards shall be deemed not to be an agreement 
voluntarily recognizing the trade union as the exclusive bargaining agent of those employees. 2000, c. 38, 
s. 35 (8). 
Not voluntary recognition 
(16.1)  A person shall be deemed not to have voluntarily recognized a trade union as an exclusive bargaining 
agent if, 
(a) the person is a party to an agreement or operates under an agreement under which an employer agrees to 
employ members of the trade union to perform work, regardless of whether the work is inside or outside of 
the construction industry; 
(b) the trade union is a bargaining agent to which notice of the coming into force of a project agreement was 
given under subsection (11); and 
(c) the agreement includes work on a project to which the project agreement applies. 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). 
Not party to collective agreement 
(17)  The proponent and, if the proponent is an agent, the person who owns or has an interest in the land for 
which the project is planned, are not, only by reason of being a party or operating under the project agreement or an 
agreement that includes work on the project, parties to any collective agreement. 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8). 
Same, project agreement 
(17.1)  Subsections (15) to (17) apply with respect to agreements entered into before the day subsection 35 (8) of 
the Labour Relations Amendment Act, 2000 is proclaimed in force. 2000, c. 38, s. 35 (8).

BACKGROUND 
 
The Government tabled Bill C-45 on June 12, 2003.  If passed, it will amend the 
Criminal Code to modernize the law with respect to the criminal liability of corporations 
and the sentencing of corporations.  The House of Commons Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights held hearings into this subject in May 2002 and recommended 
that the Government table legislation.  The Government Response 
(www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/dept/pub/ccl_rpm) set out the principles that would be 
enacted in the Criminal Code. The passage of Bill C-45 will transform these principles 
into law. 
 
Because the Criminal Code covers a wide range of crimes by all kinds of persons, the 
legislation employs more complex and specific language than that which was used in the 
Response.   This Guide outlines how the law will apply in the most common situations.  
It is intended to assist the reader understand how the Government’s proposed legislation 
may affect them or the corporation they work for. 
 
Section I provides background information on Canada’s current laws regarding corporate 
criminal liability. 
 
Section II describes Bill C-45, by explaining who it applies to, which activities it pertains 
to, and what sentencing options exist under the proposed legislation. 
 
 
SECTION I: CURRENT CANADIAN LAW 
 
Criminal liability generally 
 
The Criminal Code requires various elements to be proven before a person can be 
convicted of a crime.  The commission of a prohibited act by the accused – for example, 
causing bodily harm, counselling a person to commit an offence, driving while impaired, 
or touching a person for a sexual purpose, must first be proven. 
 
The Crown must also prove that the accused had the requisite guilty state of mind in 
committing the offence.  A person cannot be found guilty of a crime if, for example, the 
court concludes that the person was suffering from a mental disorder at the time the act 
was committed or did not know of certain facts that give the act its criminal quality.  
Depending on the offence, that state of mind can differ.  For example, the accused must: 
• know a fact (e.g. that goods are stolen), or 
• have a specified intent, either to achieve a certain outcome  (e.g. to mislead ) or to 
do a certain act (e.g. to intentionally apply force to another person). 
 
Some offences, however, are based on negligence and judged “objectively” so that the 
person’s conduct is itself proof of the necessary “criminal” fault. Some examples, as 
defined in the law, include: 
750

 
3 
• storing a firearm “in a careless manner”; 
• operating a motor vehicle “in a manner that is dangerous to the public”; and 
• showing “wanton and reckless disregard” for the lives or safety of others.  
 
Criminal liability of corporations 
 
Corporations are already subject to the Criminal Code. The definition in section 2 of 
“every one”, “person”, “owner” includes  “public bodies, bodies corporate, societies, 
companies”.  However, determining whether a corporation has committed a prohibited 
act and whether a corporation has the requisite mental state is far more complicated than 
for an individual. 
 
Corporations can only act through their employees and agents. For example, although we 
commonly consider that a bank makes a loan, in actuality it is the bank employees who 
gather information, check out security, authorize the loan and transfer money to the 
customer’s account. The question becomes whether a bank making a loan to a borrower 
who uses the money for a criminal purpose like importing drugs, is committing a crime?  
The bank has made a loan that is used for a crime, so clearly it committed a prohibited 
act. But did the bank know of the criminal purpose and intend to finance it? 
 
Over the years, the courts have dealt with criminal charges against corporations and other 
groups of persons, such as trade unions, and case by case, they have elaborated rules for 
determining when a corporation should be convicted of a crime. 
 
Basically, a corporation is guilty of a crime if its “directing mind” committed the 
prohibited act and had the necessary state of mind.  To be a “directing mind”, a person 
must have so much authority in the corporation that the person can be considered the 
“alter ego” or “soul” of the corporation (terms used in recent case law).  Determining 
who is a directing mind depends on the facts of each case, but generally the person must 
have authority to set policy rather than simply having authority to manage.  As well, the 
directing mind has to be intending, at least in part, to benefit the corporation by the crime. 
 
In the above example, it is highly unlikely that the bank president and the board of 
directors would be aware of the loan.  The bank makes many loans every month.  If the 
borrower deceived the bank and no one knew of the criminal intent of the borrower, no 
crime has been committed by the bank.  But what if the bank manager or the regional 
manager knew?  Currently, whether they would be a “directing mind” would depend on 
how much authority they had to develop loans policy.  Moreover, they would have to be 
acting at least in part for the benefit of the bank and not for their personal benefit in order 
for the bank to be convicted. 
 
Criminal liability of directors, officers and employees 
 
Under current Canadian law, officers and directors of a corporation cannot be convicted 
of a crime for acts of the corporation solely because of their status as directors or officers.  
If they are directing the corporation to commit crimes that will benefit the corporation, or 
751

 
4 
are otherwise participating in criminal activities within the corporate context, they may 
be held criminally responsible.  In such circumstances, it is likely that the directors and 
officers would be charged with the offence jointly with the corporation.  
 
 
SECTION II: CHANGING THE LAW UNDER BILL C-45 
 
The provisions of Bill C-45 are a compilation of the existing rules with new reforms, 
which will modernize the law to reflect the increasing complexity of corporate structures.  
Bill C-45 deals only with the criminal responsibility of the organization and makes no 
change in the current law dealing with the personal liability of directors, officers and 
employees. Directors and officers, like anyone else, are liable for all crimes that they 
commit personally, whatever the context. 
 
Why does C-45 refer to an organization rather than a corporation? 
 
The Standing Committee hearings and the Government’s Response both dealt with 
corporate criminal liability.  However, the Criminal Code definition of “person” includes 
bodies in addition to corporations, and it is important to ensure that the same rules for 
attributing criminal liability apply to all forms of joint enterprises carried out by 
individuals, regardless of their structure. 
 
In amendments to the Criminal Code in recent years, it has been necessary to develop 
new definitions because neither “person” nor “corporation” would cover all the “bodies” 
that may be involved in a crime.  For example, in 1997, “criminal organization” was 
defined as “a group, however organized” of three or more persons for the commission of 
criminal offences.   A biker gang would be an organization even if it were not a 
corporation or society.  Similarly, in 2001, the terrorism offences defined an “entity” as a 
person, group, trust, partnership or fund or an unincorporated association or organization.  
A terrorist entity is not a corporation but it can have assets and its members commit 
crimes. 
 
For this reason, Bill C-45 refers to an “organization” and then defines it to mean: 
• “a public body, a body corporate, a society, a company” [This comes from the 
existing definition of “every one”]; and  
• “a firm, a partnership, a trade union or an association of persons created for a 
common purpose.” [This is new]. 
 
These new provisions that define an “organization” will also apply to other groups that 
have an operational structure and make themselves known to the public . This will ensure 
the law does not apply to an informal group that gets together regularly, for example, to 
discuss politics or to play bridge.   
 
 
 
 
752

 
5 
Who are the “directing minds” of the organization? 
 
In determining who is sufficiently important within the organization to be considered to 
be its directing mind, Bill C-45 refers to a “senior officer”. This is a more familiar 
expression than “directing mind”.  The definition of “senior officer” includes everyone 
who has an important role in: 
• setting policy (which is the current Canadian law); or  
• managing an important part of the organization’s activities (which is new). 
 
The definition therefore focuses on the function of the individual, rather than on any 
particular title.  For example, the “executive assistant to the president” could have a great 
deal of authority and effectively speak for the president in one organization and have only 
minor administrative functions, like scheduling the president’s meetings, in another 
organization. 
 
In addition, the new definition makes it clear that the directors, the chief executive officer 
and the chief financial officer of a corporation are, by virtue of the position they hold, 
automatically “senior officers”.  A corporation charged with an offence cannot argue that 
the individuals occupying these positions actually had no real role in setting policy or 
managing the organization and therefore were not senior officers. 
 
What does it mean that an organization is a party to an offence? 
 
The Bill refers to “a party to an offence”, and Section 21 of the Criminal Code provides 
that a person is a party to an offence if the person actually commits the offence or aids or 
abets another person to commit it.  Section 22 of the Criminal Code makes a person who 
counsels another person to commit an offence also a party to that offence.  Accordingly, 
the use of “a party to an offence” in Bill C-45 reflects both sections of the Code, 
providing a broader definition that will apply to more activities than only when an 
organization “commits an offence”. 
 
For whose physical acts is an organization responsible? 
 
To obtain a conviction, the Crown must prove both the commission of the prohibited act 
and the requisite guilty mental state.  Bill C-45 differentiates between crimes requiring 
the Crown to prove negligence (proposed s. 22.1) and crimes requiring the Crown to 
prove knowledge or intent (proposed s. 22.2), and establishes separate rules for each. 
 
Currently, to prove the commission of the physical act by an organization, the Crown will 
usually show that the physical act was committed by employees of the organization.  
However, it has been found that the term “employee” is not broad enough to capture all 
the individuals who may act on behalf of an organization.  Therefore Bill C-45 uses 
“representative,” which is defined under the proposed amendments to s. 2 to mean 
directors, partners, members, agents and contractors, as well as employees.  These 
representatives must be acting within the scope of their employment at the time of the 
alleged crime. 
753

How does an organization become a party to a crime of negligence? 
 
In offences based on negligence, the court must determine whether an individual acted so 
carelessly or with such reckless disregard for the safety of others as to deserve criminal 
punishment. 
 
In general, for an organization to be found guilty of committing a crime of negligence, 
the Crown will have to show that employees of the organization committed the act and 
that a senior officer should have taken reasonable steps to prevent them from doing so.  
However, the complicated structure of organizations requires that this relatively 
straightforward idea be expressed in legal language that covers the many different ways 
that an organization acts. 
 
With respect to the physical element of the crime, Bill C-45 (proposed s. 22.1 of the 
Criminal Code) provides that an organization is responsible for the negligent acts or 
omissions of its representative.  The Bill provides that the conduct of two or more 
representatives can be combined to constitute the offence.  It is not therefore necessary 
that a single representative commit the entire act. 
 
For example, in a factory, an employee who turned off three separate safety systems 
would probably be prosecuted for causing death by criminal negligence if employees 
were killed as a result of an accident that the safety systems would have prevented.  The 
employee acted negligently.  On the other hand, if three employees each turned off one of 
the safety systems each thinking that it was not a problem because the other two systems 
would still be in place, they would probably not be subject to criminal prosecution 
because each one alone might not have shown reckless disregard for the lives of other 
employees.  However, the fact that the individual employees might escape prosecution 
should not mean that their employer necessarily would not be prosecuted.  After all, the 
organization, through its three employees, turned off the three systems. 
 
As for the intent necessary to find the organization guilty, the proposed amendments 
under Bill C-45 would require that the senior officer responsible, or senior officers 
collectively, must have departed markedly from the standard of care that could be 
expected.  The organization might be convicted if, for example, the director of safety 
systems failed to give the one negligent employee basic training necessary to perform the 
job. 
 
Similarly, in the example of three employees engaging in the negligent conduct, the court 
would have to decide whether the organization should have had a system to prevent them 
acting independently in a dangerous way and whether the lack of such a system was a 
marked departure from the standard of care expected in the circumstances.  The court 
would consider, under this example, the practices put in place by the person in charge of 
safety at the factory and the practices of other similar organizations. 
 
 
754

How does an organization become a party to an offence where intent or knowledge 
has to be proven? 
 
The proposed reforms in Bill C-45, specifically the addition of section 22.2 of the 
Criminal Code, would set out three ways an organization can commit a crime requiring 
an awareness of a fact or a specified intent.  In all cases, the focus is on a senior officer 
who must intend to benefit the organization at least to some degree.  The most obvious 
way for an organization to be criminally responsible is if the senior officer actually 
committed the crime for the direct benefit of the organization.  For example, if the CEO 
fudges financial reports and records, leading others to provide funds to the organization, 
both the organization and the CEO will be guilty of fraud. 
 
However, senior officers may direct others to undertake such dishonest work.  The Bill 
therefore makes it clear that the organization is guilty if the senior officer has the 
necessary intent, but subordinates carry out the actual physical act.  For example, a senior 
officer may be benefiting the organization by instructing employees to deal in goods that 
are stolen.  The senior officer may instruct employees to buy from the supplier offering 
the lowest price, knowing that the person who offers to sell the goods at the lowest price 
can only make such an offer because the goods are stolen.  The employees themselves 
have no criminal intent but the senior officer and the organization could be found guilty. 
 
Finally, an organization would be guilty of a crime if a senior officer knows employees 
are going to commit an offence but does not stop them because he wants the organization 
to benefit from the crime.  Using the stolen goods example, the senior officer may 
become aware that an employee is going to get a kickback from the thieves for getting the 
organization to buy the stolen goods.  The senior officer has done nothing to set up the 
transaction. But, if he does nothing to stop it because the organization will benefit from 
the lower price, the organization would be responsible. 
 
 
Sentencing an Organization 
 
How are organizations punished for committing a crime? 
 
Corporations cannot be imprisoned so the Criminal Code provides for fines when 
corporations are convicted of crimes.   In the case of a summary conviction offence (less 
serious offences that are punishable for individuals by up to six months in jail and/or a 
$2,000 fine), the Code provides for a fine of up to $25,000 for corporations.  Bill C-45 
would increase the maximum fine on an organization for a summary conviction offence 
to $100,000.  For the more serious, indictable offences, the Code already provides no 
limit on the fine that can be imposed on an organization. 
 
 
 
755

 
8 
At what level should the fine be set? 
 
Canadian law does not provide a mechanical process where the punishment is pre-
determined.  There are few minimum sentences and judges have a great deal of latitude to 
craft the appropriate sentence.  Bill C-45 proposes factors that a court should consider in 
fining an organization, which are in addition to those factors already in the Code that are 
applicable to both individuals and corporations (such as an abuse of a position of trust).  
The gravity of the crime, including the extent of injury caused or whether death results, is 
already considered when determining sentencing. Under the proposed reforms in Bill C-
45 to s. 718.21 of the Criminal Code, new factors would reflect for organizations the 
considerations that govern sentencing individuals.  Judges already apply many of these 
factors but it is expected that providing a list will result in judges having a more complete 
picture of the organization.  The factors are: 
 
Moral blameworthiness  
• The economic advantage gained by committing the crime - The more money the 
organization made, the higher the fine should be. 
• The degree of planning involved - Careful planning shows a deliberate breaking 
of the law and should be punished more than a case where the senior officers took 
advantage of an unexpected opportunity to make a quick, illegal profit.  
 
Public interest 
• The need to keep the organization running and preserve employment - Just as 
individuals should not be fined so heavily that they will not be able to provide for 
their families, so an organization should not normally be so heavily fined that 
bankruptcy results and, as a result, employees are left without work.  
• The cost of investigation and prosecution - Many corporate fraud offences require 
lengthy investigations and the cost to the public of detecting the crime and 
building a case should be considered by the judge. 
• Any regulatory penalties, which are distinct from those under the Criminal Code, 
imposed on the organization for the offence - Courts consider whether individuals 
have been punished in other ways, for example, by losing their jobs.  Similarly, a 
court would consider whether the public interest is served by adding a large fine 
to the penalties that may have already been imposed by a body such as a securities 
commission. 
 
Prospects of rehabilitation 
• Penalties imposed on managers and employees for their role in the crime - An 
organization shows how seriously it responds to criminal activity if, for example, 
it disciplines or fires employees who participated in the offence.  
• Previous convictions or regulatory offences - Just as the criminal record of an 
individual is very important to determining the appropriate penalty, so it is 
important for a judge to consider whether the organization and its workers had 
been sanctioned for similar activities in the past, not just in the criminal courts but 
by regulators like occupational health and safety departments. 
756

 
9 
• Restitution – Compensating victims shows that the organization is trying to make 
up for the harm it caused. 
• Attempts to hide assets to avoid paying a fine – An organization that tries to 
pretend it is poor, rather than being open with the court about its financial 
situation, is showing that it has not changed its ways. 
• Measures taken to reduce the likelihood of further criminal activity - New policies 
and practices, like spot audits or changes in personnel, could indicate that the 
organization has learned its lesson. 
 
What is corporate probation? 
 
Courts often place individual offenders on probation.  The court imposes conditions on 
the offender, such as reporting to a probation officer, not drinking alcohol or taking drugs 
and performing community service and, in observing these conditions, the offender 
avoids going to jail.  Probation is virtually unheard of for corporate offenders. But, there 
may be circumstances in which probation would be appropriate to ensure that the 
organization take steps to reduce the chances it will commit further crimes. 
 
The Bill proposes to put in the Code a specific section dealing with probation orders for 
organizations (s. 732.1(3.1)).  The list of conditions the judge can impose includes: 
• providing restitution to victims of the offence to emphasize that their losses 
should be uppermost in the sentencing judge’s mind;  
• requiring the corporation to inform the public of the offence, the sentence 
imposed and the remedial measures being undertaken by the organization. Having 
to run ads in the media admitting to criminal acts could have a serious effect on an 
organization’s business. 
 
The new section also sets out conditions that may be imposed by the court to supervise 
the efforts of the organization to ensure it does not commit crimes in the future.  A court 
can order an organization to: 
• implement policies and procedures to reduce the likelihood of further criminal 
activity; 
• communicate those policies and procedures to employees; 
• name a senior officer to oversee their implementation; and 
• report on progress. 
 
Courts are not necessarily well equipped to supervise corporate activities and the 
organization may already be subject to extensive regulation by government bodies.  
There is no need for a court to get involved in overseeing changes in an organization’s 
safety practices, for example, if a provincial occupational health and safety department is 
already doing so.  Such an agency has trained inspectors and expertise that the courts 
lack.  Therefore, the section requires the court to consider whether another body would be 
more suitable to supervise the organization.
