Preface
Elizabeth Simpson
The book you have in hand, The Adventure of the Illustrious Scholar, is named in 
reference to the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. Holmes was—
is—a hero to Oscar White Muscarella, the illustrious scholar in ­question, due 
to his talent for and commitment to careful observation and comprehensive 
research, his vast store of knowledge, and his powers of deductive reasoning. 
One of Oscar’s favorite quotes is, “You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”1 
This was Holmes’s first comment upon meeting Dr. John Watson, who had 
served as assistant surgeon in the second Afghan war (1878–1880), was struck 
by a bullet in the battle of Maiwand (1880), and then contracted enteric fever 
before being sent back to England to recover. Holmes’s deduction, as Watson 
later learned, was based on certain observations: that he was a gentleman “of a 
medical type” with a military air, that he had just come from the tropics as his 
face was dark but his wrists fair (indicating that this was his natural complex-
ion), that he had been injured and undergone hardship and sickness … and to 
what other place would all this apply but—Afghanistan?2
Another favorite of Oscar’s occurs in several Holmes stories: “It is an old 
maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever re-
mains, however improbable, must be the truth.”3 Also, “It is an error to argue in 
front of your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your 
theories.”4 And certainly, “I never guess. It is a shocking habit—destructive to 
the logical faculty.”5 While some say that Sherlock Holmes was a fictional char-
acter, many would disagree, including Muscarella himself, who has bemoaned 
the fact that Holmes never became an archaeologist, despite his interest in the 
field, calling this an irreparable loss to the profession.6

that he is versed in the history and literature of the classical world. A Study in Scarlet, in

Preface ﻿
To celebrate the life and work of Oscar Muscarella, the papers of 47 au-
thors are presented here on topics relating to his many interests: the arts and 
­archaeology of the ancient Near East and Mediterranean, craft and technology, 
materials and techniques, and numerous issues relating to scholarly method-
ologies, conservation, connoisseurship and dating, museums and collecting, 
the plunder of ancient sites, forgeries, and the antiquities trade. According to 
tradition, students of a Festschrift recipient may be asked to contribute to the 
volume. Since Oscar was a curator and not a professor per se, he did not have 
graduate students of his own, although he has helped many young scholars. 
However he lectured regularly to my classes at the Bard Graduate Center, to 
great acclaim; I have included articles of five of my students who were inspired 
by his teaching. Holmes, and archaeological detective work, find their place 
in many of the contributions, specifically in Laurie Adams’s “Oscar White 
­Muscarella and Sherlock Holmes” and Jeanette Greenfield’s “Elementary,” 
which act as initial and concluding chapters of the book.
Some of the contributions involve “controversial” subjects that would not 
easily have found a home elsewhere; a few were left unpublished because a 
proposed volume failed to appear. My own contribution, “Luxury Arts of the 
Ancient Near East,” was initially written by invitation for the Wiley-Blackwell 
Companion to the Art of the Ancient Near East, but later withdrawn. Unfortu-
nately, the editor decided to completely reorganize and rewrite the article, 
without permission or even notification, not only destroying the narrative but 
eliminating my emphasis on the looting of sites and the damaging repercus-
sions, effectively censoring the work. The article that set Oscar on his path, 
“Illicit Traffic of Pre-Columbian Antiquities,” by Clemency Coggins (1969), is 
reprinted here with a new introduction by the author.
The publication of such a large Festschrift would not have been ­possible 
without the assistance of many people, to whom my thanks are due. At Brill 
USA, Katelyn Chin oversaw the project, Maria Baluch was ­production ­editor, 
and Jennifer Pavelko initially approved the idea; Thomas Schneider, also 
of Brill, liked the theme and suggested that the publication could “draw out 
the topic of the inquisitive nature of archaeologists and Oscar Muscarella, 
and contain the charming allusions to Sherlock Holmes.” Russell Stockman 
was copy editor for the book. In addition, Sybil Johnson, Meredith Nelson, 
Heather Jane ­McCormick, and Einav Zamir Dembin contributed to research 
and editing for the manuscripts and bibliography. Jonathan Konovitch and 
Sherlock Holmes 1, 120. He would, of course, make a brilliant archaeologist today, with his 
command of forensic science, his expertise in analytical chemistry, and his vast knowledge 
of material culture and the minutiae of daily life.

­Brenda ­Bennett ­assisted in ­obtaining the legal files for the court case, Mus-
carella v. The Metropoltian Museum of Art, and additional help was provided 
by Lawrence M. Kaye and the office of Herrick, Feinstein llp in New York. 
I am grateful to Cindy Ho, who first suggested that Oscar be honored with a 
Festschrift volume, and to Senta German, who acted as co-editor in the early 
stages of the project until she had to step down. I wish to acknowledge three 
anonymous donors who helped fund our work. Finally, I thank the contribut-
ing authors for their expertise, their good will, and their patience with such an 
ambitious venture. The honoree will be very pleased.

Introduction
Elizabeth Simpson
On first meeting Dr. John H. Watson, Sherlock Holmes correctly guessed 
that he had recently been in Afghanistan, based on several astute observa-
tions.1 But what would Holmes make of Dr. Oscar White Muscarella? The silk 
­ascots, fine footwear, slightly long hair combed back to cover his shirt ­collar, 
the ­ever-present pipe. Likely an aristocratic background of some sort, no 
doubt. But what of his love of Dickens, his penchant for unionizing, and the 
­occasional plaid suit? Surely a common strain there. And his willingness to put 
himself in danger and go against the tide? Perhaps a Caribbean pirate some-
where in his lineage. What is behind this unusual character with his long list 
of accomplishments and checkered career? Holmes would say—and did say, 
“For strange ­effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, 
which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.”2 And so we 
consider the man himself in this biographical introduction.3
	
Early Life
Muscarella was born on March 26, 1931, in New York, New York (borough 
of Manhattan), as Oscar White, his father being Oscar V. White, an ­elevator 
­operator, and his mother Anna Falkin.4 Anna was the beautiful daughter of Leah 
­Jacobs Falkin, born in New York of Jewish parents from Russia and ­Germany, 
and Saul Falkin, a Jewish cigar salesman born in Russia. Oscar White Sr. was a 
handsome British seaman from Barbados, who had jumped ship in New York 
around 1923. Oscar Sr. and Anna lived in the Bronx and were very poor, as a 
consequence of Oscar’s alcoholism. They never married; at the time, Anna was 
not yet ­divorced from her first husband, Morty Jacobs. In 1936, Anna left Oscar

White and ­abandoned her two young boys, Oscar Jr. and his younger brother 
Bobby, to live with Salvatore Muscarella—Sam—whom she later married in 
1939. Oscar Sr. placed the two boys in an orphanage, from which they were sent 
to live in foster homes. Anna found the boys and “kidnapped” them, ­taking 
them to live with her and Sam in Manhattan in 1937. By this time, Oscar Jr. 
had another sibling, Ronnie. For many years Sam had osteomyelitis and was 
unable to work; the family lived in poverty—on welfare (“home relief”), with 
tattered clothing, and not enough to eat—and the children sold shopping bags 
or begged in the streets. The last time Oscar Jr. saw his father, Oscar White, was 
when he was six or seven years old.
In December 1938, Oscar was baptized Roman Catholic (the name ­Antonio 
Oscar Muscarella was listed on the baptismal certificate). Anna and Sam were 
married in September 1939. The family moved to a better apartment on East 
16th Street, and Sam was finding jobs. Oscar and Bobby were legally ­adopted 
by Sam in 1941, taking the last name Muscarella. By the time of Oscar’s ­Catholic 
confirmation, at some point in the early 1940s, photos show the boys dressed in 
decent clothes (Plate 0.1). Oscar joined the Gramercy Boy’s Club for a nominal 
fee, and it was in the club’s library that he discovered books. He went to Clear-
pool Camp, sponsored by the club, where he learned to fish. Things had ­gotten 
better but were not that great. Around this time, Sam took to ­encouraging ­Oscar 
and Bobby to fight (Bobby usually won), and then, as the man of the house, 
he began to beat Oscar, although they became reconciled in later life. In 1942, 
the family was evicted from their apartment on East 16th Street, along with 
­thousands of others, due to the plans of Robert Moses for Stuyvesant Town, 
and the Muscarellas moved uptown to Tiffany Street in the Bronx. Shortly after 
they moved, Oscar’s sister Arline was born.
By the end of the war, they lived in a five-room, fourth-floor walkup on 
­Tiffany Street. Sam worked at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds and also 
at trotter racetracks. Oscar got a job as an usher at the Bijou movie house. 
­After school he delivered the Bronx Home News; he made a shoe-shine box and 
shined shoes on the weekends (10 cents a shine plus an occasional 5-cent tip). 
When he turned 14, he got a job at the Polo Grounds as a “hustler,” a vendor 
who walked up and down the seated aisles selling refreshments—peanuts, ice 
cream, and soda—for a 10% commission. This also entailed bagging peanuts 
and cleaning up after each game, including double-headers. When he turned 
18 he could sell beer, which increased his income, and he eventually attained 
the prestigious position of score-card seller at the entrance. In 1952 Oscar 
lost his job at the Polo Grounds, after working (undercover) to unionize the 
­hustlers and the porters for the Office Employees International Union. He filed 

3
Introduction
a ­complaint with the New York Labor Relations Board, but he was told private-
ly to terminate the complaint since he had no chance of winning. At age 21, he 
had learned “the power of corporate power … to command perjury and deceit.”
In junior high school, Oscar was a good student, placed in an advanced class 
and skipping a semester, despite all his outside jobs. He was encouraged to take 
the test for the elite Stuyvesant High School, which he passed (the ­current ratio 
of those accepted to those who apply is 3%). His time at ­Stuyvesant was fraught 
with anxiety, however, with his commute from the Bronx and the ­outside jobs 
to help support his family. In high school, Oscar worked for the Copy Clear-
ing House at Grand Central Station as a messenger. He joined the ­Archaeology 
Club at Stuyvesant, and his interest in the subject began there. He frequented 
the public library and engaged in a massive reading campaign, which was not 
looked upon kindly by Sam, particularly as this led to Oscar’s decision to stop 
being a Catholic. Besides the great philosophers and novelists, he also read 
books on travel and archaeology—and he found Sherlock Holmes. Oscar 
­started drawing at this time—pictures of war scenes, spitfires shooting down 
Nazi planes, etc.—and played imaginary games pretending to be a “hero,” 
­fighting “bad guys.” At age 16, he asked Sam if he could smoke a pipe, and Sam 
agreed. So here we may recognize a famous (archaeological) detective in the 
making.
	
College
Oscar graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1948. He enrolled in nyu 
at the uptown campus, but he did poorly the first semester, failing math 
and ­science; he subsequently found out that he had been signed up for the 
­Pre-Med program by mistake. Nevertheless, he got an A in history. Meanwhile, 
Sam had started a candy store near their apartment in the Bronx, at which 
he, Anna, and  Oscar worked every day. Unfortunately, they had competi-
tion from a ­larger, nicer candy store on the opposite corner, and the business 
failed, ­leaving the family deeper in debt. Not knowing what to do next, Os-
car ­followed the advice of a good friend and enrolled in City College (ccny), 
­Evening ­Session, in ­September 1949. After one year, he was accepted as a fully 
matriculated student and attended tuition free. He went to class in the eve-
nings and worked during the day. After being fired from the Polo Grounds in 
1952, he needed another job, and someone he knew at ccny suggested he ap-
ply at the New York Stock Exchange for work on the Exchange floor. He did 
this for three years, picking up sell slips from brokers and bringing them to

the firms’ booths; then calling up sales made on the floor to the record keep-
ers; finally working in a booth for the broker Orvis Brothers, taking orders by 
phone. Later, he got a position with the brokerage firm J.R. Williston & Beane, 
working as a runner on the floor, and then calling in purchase and sell orders 
upstairs. Oscar moved out of his family’s apartment and rented a furnished 
room in Manhattan.
At ccny, Oscar was a member of the History Society, Student Council, and, 
briefly, a reporter for the student newspaper. After six years in the ­Evening 
­Session, he graduated in 1955 with a degree in history. Oscar made many 
friends at ccny, had wonderful teachers, and his intellectual life was formed 
there. His favorite professor, the brilliant Vito Caporale, taught him not only 
about ­history, but how to conduct research and how to think: “Everything I 
ever ­became in the academic world I owe to Vito.” In the early 1950s, Oscar 
became interested in jazz, going to Café Society in the Village, Hickory House, 
Bop City, 3 Deuces, or Birdland, nursing a single drink and listening to ­Coleman 
Hawkins, ­Marian McPartland, Charlie Parker, and the George Shearing ­Quintet. 
A favorite was Lennie Tristano: “One joy was meeting the blind pianist Lennie 
Tristano, to me a brilliant jazz musician, whom I dug very much.” At the same 
time, he ­discovered The Seven Pillars of Wisdom; he later became a collector of 
T.E. Lawrence’s works.
	
Archaeology and the University of Pennsylvania
In the summer of 1953, Oscar left his Wall Street job to go on his first excava-
tion at Mesa Verde, a Pueblo Indian site in Colorado. He saw a posted notice 
at ccny, signed up, and traveled to Colorado by bus. He left his job again in 
summer 1955 to go on another excavation, at Swan Creek, South Dakota, this 
time leaving Wall Street for good. Here he dug a Mandan Round House site 
and cemetery, sleeping in a tent on the banks of the Missouri River (Plate 0.2). 
While at Swan Creek, Oscar received a forwarded letter of acceptance from 
the University of Pennsylvania for graduate study in the Department of Clas-
sical Archaeology. Before leaving New York, with the help of a ccny profes-
sor, he had applied to Penn to study “archaeology,” but then was told to state 
a ­specific area of interest. He chose Egyptology, as he had read a lot about 
­ancient Egypt—and didn’t know what else to choose. He was admitted to the 
Department of Anthropology before leaving for South Dakota, but with no 
mention of funding, and he was sure he could not afford to go. In what he calls 
a deus ex machina event, his application was somehow transferred to Classical 
­Archaeology, where he was not only accepted but given a tuition fellowship

Introduction
with stipend ($60 per month). Luckily the letter reached him at Swan Creek, or 
he might never have known of the offer.5
Oscar headed for the University Museum (currently the Penn Museum), 
University of Pennsylvania, where he registered and paid for a dorm room for 
two semesters in advance. He then went to meet the head of the Department of 
Classical Archaeology, Rodney S. Young, who had arranged for his fellowship—
and thus began his archaeological career. His first expedition was to ­Gordion, 
Turkey, with Young in 1957, the year that Tumulus mm was excavated and 
­Megaron 3 was discovered on the City Mound—by Oscar himself (Plate 0.3). 
This was also the year that Oscar married Grace Freed, a fellow ­graduate 
­student (in Latin) who later became an archaeological ­illustrator; Grace 
went with Oscar to Gordion that season for more than four months. ­Working 
at ­Gordion in 1957 were Burhan Tezcan, Ellen Kohler, ­Dorothy Cox, George 
Bass, T.A. Carter, Machteld Mellink, Axel von Saldern, David French, and Piet 
de Jong. In 1958–1959, Oscar was a Fulbright Scholar at the American School 
of Classical Studies, Athens. His daughter Daphne was born in 1958 near the 
monastery at Daphni (in a taxicab en route to a hospital in Athens); his son 
Lawrence was born in 1961 in New York. Oscar returned to work at Gordion 
in 1959 and 1963. He also excavated in Iran at Hasanlu in 1960, 1962, and 1964 
(­Co-Director with Robert Dyson that year); at Agrab Tepe in 1964 (Co-Director 
with T. Cuyler Young); and at Ziwiye in 1964. In the same year (1964), he joined 
the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art.6 At the time he was teaching courses in ancient and medieval history at 
ccny (1960–1964) and working on his dissertation. Oscar received a Ph.D. from 
the University of Pennsylvania in 1965, writing his dissertation on Phrygian 
fibulae from Gordion.7

Oscar was Assistant Curator (1964–1969), Associate Curator (1969–1978), and 
then Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art

Ayanis in Turkey. A complete list of sites at which he has worked, with dates, precedes this

(ane), retiring in 2009.8 He first met Vaughn Crawford and Prudence Harper 
of ane in 1960 at the Hasanlu excavation, a joint project of the Metropolitan 
­Museum (mma) and the University Museum. He worked with Vaughn Crawford 
at Hasanlu also in 1962, and in 1964 Crawford, head of the department, ­offered 
him a job. Oscar continued to excavate at sites in Iran, including ­Dinkha Tepe, 
Nush-i Jan, and Sé Girdan (Plate 0.4), and he discovered the important Urartian 
city of Qalatgah.9 It is not possible to recount in detail the situation in ane that 
led to Oscar’s “troubles,” but suffice it to say that the work was difficult, due to 
ongoing power struggles within the department. This eventually involved the 
museum hierarchy, including Ashton Hawkins, Secretary and Chief Counsel; 
Theodore Rousseau, Curator-in-Chief; Thomas Hoving, ­Director (1967–1977); 
and C. Douglas Dillon, President (1970–1978) and then Chairman of the Board 
(1977–1983). In April 1970 Oscar wrote a four-page, ­single-spaced, typed letter 
of complaint to Douglas Dillon, former Secretary of the Treasury under John F. 
Kennedy and Ambassador to France. Dillon had said he was always available 
to museum staff, and Oscar took him up on it.10 The letter brought up “the sad 
state of affairs existing in the Museum,” including low salaries, women ­curators 
being paid less and promoted less frequently than their male ­counterparts, 
lack of academic freedom resulting in low ­morale, the cutting down of old 
trees in front of the museum—and Hoving’s ruthless and autocratic manage-
ment style. Dillon was not pleased, and he showed the letter to Hoving, who 
was not pleased either.
Things got worse when Oscar was appointed acting head of the ­department 
in late 1970 and early 1971, over Prudence Harper. In December 1970, Harper 
­submitted a letter of resignation to Hoving in protest (which he did not ­accept). 
At this same time, Oscar was trying to organize the junior curators, but some-
one revealed this to the administration. He had also been speaking out about 
the museum’s acquisition policies with respect to antiquities (the 1970 unesco 
convention was opened for signature in November 1970). ­Despite a record of 
positive evaluations and “a strong vote of confidence” from Vaughn Crawford, 
Oscar was labeled a “dissident curator,” and by March 1971 plans were underway 
to remove him, involving Hawkins, Rousseau, Hoving, and Crawford himself.

Introduction
One of the tactics was to get his colleagues to say they would not excavate with 
him on future collaborative projects; those who did so included Prof. Robert 
Dyson of the University Museum, University of ­Pennsylvania (Hasanlu, Iran),  
and Prof. Donald Hansen of the Institute of Fine Arts, nyu (Al Hiba, Iraq). 
Curiously, Oscar had already told Dyson that he would not excavate again at 
Hasanlu, and he had never planned to dig at Al Hiba, as this was not his area 
of expertise. Such collaborative projects, by the way, are funded in part by the 
Metropolitan Museum.
In April 1971, Crawford informed Oscar that Hoving wanted him to leave and 
reminded him that he had no tenure—although he actually did have ­tenure as 
Associate Curator, according to museum regulations. Three days later, ­Oscar 
was summoned by Hoving and Rousseau and told that Crawford wanted him 
to leave and that he had five or six months to find another job. On July 21, 
1971, he received official notification in the form of a letter from Hoving, con-
firming “the Museum’s decision that your employment is being terminated 
for cause, effective as of December 31, 1971.”11 In October, the museum post-
poned the ­termination date, in order to give Oscar more time to find another 
­position, ­reserving the option of terminating his employment at any point 
­after ­December 31 with 90 days’ notice. In December, the museum set a final 
termination date of March 31, 1972.
Things began to change in January 1972, when Oscar got a lawyer. He ­retained 
the services of Steven J. Hyman of Kunstler, Kunstler & Hyman (later Kunstler, 
Kunstler, Hyman & Goldberg), New York. In March 1972, the ­termination date 
was again postponed, and Oscar was given six months’ academic leave. Mean-
while, he had been moved to a small office in the Department of Greek and 
Roman Art. By August, the museum was ready for a “showdown,” as Oscar was 
informed; the now-treacherous Vaughn Crawford had phoned Prof. Rodney 
Young to speak to him about his former student and advise him of “the situ-
ation.” Prof. Edith Porada was also contacted to report on Oscar’s resignation 
from the Columbia University Seminar, in an effort to further substantiate the 
idea that he did not get along with his colleagues. On August 30, Oscar was 
sent a one-sentence letter telling him his employment was to be terminated as 
of October 1, 1972. However, in September, he obtained a temporary restrain-
ing order and preliminary injunction. He filed his complaint, Muscarella v. The 
Metropolitan Museum of Art, with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, 
on September 28, 1972.

Meanwhile, the Euphronios krater had been delivered to the museum on Au-
gust 31, 1972. This was an exquisite Greek vase made in Athens around 515 b.c., 
purchased from the dealer Robert Hecht for $1 million—the ­highest price yet 
paid for a work of ancient art (Plate 1.5).12 The vase had been looted from an 
Etruscan tomb at Greppe Sant’Angelo, Cerveteri, ­Italy, in 1971, and was eventu-
ally claimed by Italy and returned in 2008.13 At the time, however, Hecht and 
Hoving concocted a false provenance, claiming to have acquired it through Di-
kran Sarrafian, an Armenian dealer from ­Beirut, whose family had supposedly 
owned it since 1920. Two months later, the vase was ­featured on the cover the 
The New York Times Magazine (November 12, 1972). Details of the acquisition 
were murky, and a Times reporter, Nicholas Gage, ­began an investigation. This 
led him to Zurich where he interviewed some dealers, then to Dikran Sarrafian 
in Beirut, and finally to Cerveteri, where he found one of the tombaroli who 
had looted the vase. Gage published the ­results in February 1973,14 but Hoving 
rejected the evidence. The Times decided to interview several professionals, 
including Oscar, “a classical archaeologist and associate curator of Near East-
ern art at the Metropolitan.” As expected, he came out strongly against the 
purchase.
When thieves hear of these exorbitant prices, they naturally plunder 
tombs to get more loot. Can we blame them any more than the people 
who pay them or the people who buy their finds?15
When asked about the authenticity of the documents concerning Dikran 
­Sarrafian, the alleged former owner, Oscar said “I wish I knew the word for 
deus ex machina in Armenian.” He also appeared on a television show, “Straight 
Talk,” to discuss the problems with the acquisition. This was to be followed 
by an ongoing series of lectures and publications in which Oscar spoke out 
against the plundering of ancient sites and role of museums in support of the 
looting.

Introduction
Around this time, pieces from the “Lydian Hoard” went on exhibition at 
the Metropolitan Museum. The “hoard” was a group of finds of silver and gold 
­vessels and jewelry that were plundered in the 1960s from Lydian tombs in 
western Turkey (Plates 1.7, 32.11, and 42.4). The museum began to purchase the 
objects in 1966 and continued to acquire them through 1980. They had mostly 
stayed in storage, but a spectacular silver oinochoe was featured in the muse-
um’s 1970 centenary exhibition, “Masterpieces of Fifty Centuries.” Several piec-
es were reportedly exhibited in April 1973, pending future display of the col-
lection. In February 1973, New York Times journalist John Canaday called Oscar 
to talk about the Lydian Hoard and was informed of its lack of archaeological 
provenience and misidentification as “Greek.” Nonetheless, Canaday omitted 
all this from his article, “Met Proud of a Rare Greek Pitcher,” and then con-
veyed the conversation to the museum authorities, or so Oscar believes.16 This 
was the ­beginning of Oscar’s long involvement with the objects of the Lydian 
Hoard, which were the subject of legal proceedings against the museum, and 
were eventually ­returned to Turkey in 1993.17
In the meantime, the museum had been investigated by the National 
­Labor Relations Board for firing people because of their union activities. This 
­resulted in an agreement by the museum to reinstate a number of those who 
had been fired, with Oscar’s name on the list. He received a note on July 1, 1973, 
­reinstating him retroactively as of July 1, 1971. The temporary restraining order 
and preliminary injunction were then withdrawn on the condition of his rein-
statement. Good news—and one might imagine that Oscar’s problems were 
over. However, due to his statement to the press about the museum’s purchase 
of the Euphronios krater, he was once again in trouble. On October 12, 1973, he 
was fired a second time by Hoving, in a letter alleging (A) his “inability to per-
form an ­essential function” of his position by reason of his “unacceptability as a 
member of archaeological excavations in which the Museum is involved,” and 
(B) his “unprofessional and improper conduct in dealings with other ­Museum 
personnel and outside professional associates,” with various negative effects to 
the museum, including adversely affecting the reputation of the Department of 
Ancient Near Eastern Art. Witnesses supposedly ready to attest to the ­charges

are listed as follows: Dr. Robert H. Dyson, Dr. Vaughn Crawford, Prof. Donald 
P. Hanson [sic], Charles K. Wilkinson, and Mrs. Prudence Oliver Harper, all 
employees of or affiliated with the museum. The five-page letter outlines the 
procedure envisioned and lists Oscar’s “rights,” including his right to request a 
fact-finder “connected with the Museum and mutually acceptable to you and 
the Museum.”18 Instead, Oscar requested that an inquiry be conducted under 
the auspices of the American Arbitration Association (aaa), by an indepen-
dent and unbiased fact-finder selected under its rules and regulations.
However, negotiations over this request stalled. After a series of inconclu-
sive meetings, Oscar received a letter from Hoving on September 5, 1974, ­saying 
that he had submitted his final recommendation for Oscar’s dismissal to the 
­President of the museum for referral to the Board of Trustees, effectively ­firing 
him for a third time before any hearings had been held.19 On the same date, 
­Hoving wrote to Douglas Dillon, President, recommending termination of 
­Oscar’s ­employment. The Board of Trustees did vote to terminate in ­November, 
effective December 2, 1974, with pay (“severance allowance”) through the end of 
the month. Oscar submitted an affidavit on December 6, in support of a ­motion 
for preliminary injunctive relief, based on his rights as Associate Curator with 
tenure. The museum’s attorneys, Lord, Day & Lord, submitted a cross-motion, 
but Steve Hyman applied for another injunction—this time ­accompanied by 
Oscar’s affidavit listing his grievances, including the museum’s purchase of 
plundered art. The injunction was granted in July 1975 by Justice Irving Saypol 
of the New York Supreme Court. The museum was ­prevented from terminating 
Oscar’s employment; he kept his job and remained on the payroll.
The case had now been ongoing for four years, since the time of his first 
­firing in July 1971, and would not be resolved in his favor until 1976. If the 
reader is beginning to tire of the legalistic details (and this is merely an out-
line), one can only imagine how the plaintiff must have felt. Nonetheless, 
­Oscar ­produced some of his best work during this period, including reports 
on Hasanlu, Sé ­Girdan, Agrab Tepe, and Dinkha Tepe in Iran, his masterly 
“‘­Ziwiye’ and ­Ziwiye,” his catalogue of the Schimmel Collection, and his article, 
“­Unexcavated Objects and Ancient Near Eastern Art,” which formed the basis 
for The Lie Became Great (2000). But now on to The Trial.

Introduction
	
The Trial
What Oscar refers to as his trial was technically a process of arbitration ­overseen 
by the court; as in a trial, witnesses were called to testify for the ­plaintiff and 
the defense. Oscar and the museum had agreed that an inquiry was to be 
­conducted by a mutually agreed-upon fact-finder, under the museum’s regu-
lations (and not by the aaa). Oscar was ordered by the museum to choose a 
fact-finder who was both a lawyer and a member of the Metropolitan ­Museum 
(which, at the time, had around 33,000 members). This was an improvement 
over the ­museum’s previous stipulation that the fact-finder be someone 
“­connected with the museum.” The parties settled on the ­appointment of 
­Harry I. Rand, of Botein, Hays, Sklar & Herzberg, one of three candidates sub-
mitted by Justice Saypol. The selection of Harry Rand marks a turning point in 
the case.20 As fact-finder, Rand was to investigate the case, having access to all 
relevant information and documents, and hold hearings in which interviews 
would be conducted. His final report would be distributed to the parties.
The hearings began on September 11, 1975, in the office of Harry Rand. These 
included 12 days of testimony and ended on November 26, being documented 
in a transcript of 1,379 pages with more than 50 exhibits. Based on the ­testimony 
and his own research, Rand then prepared the “Report of the Fact-Finder,” 
which was released on March 24, 1976. The 89-page report summarized the 
prior proceedings and then investigated “the facts” pertaining to Oscar’s firing 
by the museum.21 These related to (1) the museum’s charge of “unprofessional 
and improper conduct,” (2) the charge of “inability to perform” the archaeo-
logical field function, and (3) the events following Prudence Harper’s tender of 
resignation, culminating in Muscarella’s dismissal. The report concluded with 
a recapitulation and rulings. For a legal brief, this makes compelling reading. It 
includes the following:

Witness testimony for the plaintiff, by Dr. Günter H. Kopcke of the 
­Institute of Fine Arts, New York University; Dr. David G. Mitten of ­Harvard 
University and the Fogg Museum; Norbert Schimmel; Dr. Irene J. Winter, 
then of Queens College, cuny; Dr. T. Cuyler Young, Jr., of the University 
of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum; and Dr. Henry Fischer and 
Oscar Muscarella himself of the Metropoltian Museum.
The relationship between Harper and Muscarella was recognized as crucial 
to  the termination of Oscar’s employment, and Rand investigated this in 
depth. The acts deemed seriously objectionable by the museum, and which led 
to the termination, occurred during the time that Oscar was acting head of the 
department of Ancient Near Eastern Art in the absence of Vaughn Crawford 
(September 1970 through March 1971). Rand found that these were procedural, 
relating to the typing of items for the curators by the secretary and ­Oscar’s 
wish to review all items before they were typed, as well as the stipulation that 
department business take priority. For Harper, as she said, these ­directives 
made it impossible for her to work in the department, implying a lack of 
trust, and made her job “extremely unpleasant.”22 Rand discovered, however, 
that Harper had exhibited a “troublesome attitude” that had caused “strained 
­relations among other members of the department.” According to a 1969 letter 
by Vaughn Crawford to Theodore Rousseau, “She acts like a spoiled brat who 
has been in a tantrum for a year!” Crawford said he thought “her chances for 
rehabilitation” were slight.23
Rand perceptively realized that “the difficulties Dr. Crawford experienced 
with Mrs. Harper in 1970 could hardly be laid at Dr. Muscarella’s door.”24 Oscar’s 
rules regarding the departmental secretary stemmed from Harper’s unwilling-
ness to inform him of her activities and the overburdening of the secretary 
with her personal work. Rand noted that it must have been “most painful” 
for Harper to deal with Muscarella, “an intense man, outspoken, not given 
to ­diplomatic niceties, at times abrasive.” However, in light of the “history of 
­difficulties with Mrs. Harper in the Department,” he found that Oscar’s actions 
were “understandable.” Rand concluded that Muscarella’s conduct was “not 
­unprofessional or improper.”25 Since Harper had decided that she could 
not work in the ­department with Muscarella, the authorities, realizing that one

of them must go, chose Oscar,26 seeking to oust him by impugning his abilities 
and his reputation. Regarding Oscar’s alleged unsuitability for fieldwork, and 
the idea that this would cause damage to the department, Rand found that 
­neither was the case, and noted that Harper had not participated in excava-
tions herself since 1962.27
Testimony for the defense did not turn out quite as expected, with Vaughn 
Crawford attesting to Muscarella’s excellence as a scholar and the importance 
of his fieldwork in Iran for the study of the Near East. Dyson said Oscar was 
“a very competent scholar” and his work was of “value to the academic field.” 
Hansen said that Oscar was “a very highly distinguished man; very, very compe-
tent man” and his writings were a contribution to scholarship on Near Eastern 
culture. Even Harper said, “He is a great scholar.” In testimony for the plaintiff, 
Henry Fischer considered Oscar to be a favorable asset to the ­museum. Günter 
Kopcke said that Oscar’s publications constituted “good, scholarly work” and 
that he had “a very high reputation” among foreign and American scholars. 
David Mitten judged Muscarella’s work “as of the very highest quality and the 
very greatest value to scholarship.” Norbert Schimmel said that Muscarella’s 
colleagues in the field found his scholarship to be “always on a very high ­level.” 
Irene Winter attested to Oscar’s “impeccable scholarship” constituting “a fine 
contribution to the field,” and to his generosity toward students and colleagues. 
Cuyler Young called Oscar a “first rate scholar,” one of the top young scholars 
working in Iran. In his opinion, Muscarella’s association with the museum 
­enhanced its reputation.
In the end, Rand found that “the evidence does not support any of the 
­charges stated in the Director’s notice of October 12, 1973” (Oscar’s second ­firing 
by Hoving). He also declined to find Oscar liable for any portion of his fee, 
and recommended that the museum be held responsible for full payment.28 
­During the trial, Oscar became ill from the cumulative stress, not being able 
to eat, and suffering intense claustrophobia and panic attacks. But he won his 
case, by virtue of Rand’s findings. The museum had to pay his legal fees, and 
reportedly spent $400,000 on legal fees of their own. Finally, on December 17, 
1976, Hawkins wrote to say that dismissal proceedings were to be ­discontinued. 
The Board of Trustees was never shown Rand’s report, as specified by the regu-
lations.29 In May 1977, Oscar was told that he was “an Associate Curator in the 
Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art in good standing.” All records ­relating

to the charges and proceedings were to be removed from his file. In March 
1978, Oscar was “promoted” to the position of Senior Research Fellow, with 
­tenure (although tenure per se had been abolished by the Board at the urging 
of Hoving in 1974). Oscar considered this “a Mickey Mouse title,” but it gave him 
the freedom to spend his time on research and writing, with the result that he 
is one of the most prolific scholars in the field.
Oscar’s remaining years at the museum were not without problem. He 
was largely excluded from departmental matters, particularly after Prudence 
­Harper took over as head of the department. He often was not told about 
­acquisitions, gallery changes, meetings, newly appointed staff, or visiting 
­colleagues. His pay was docked for overstaying his “vacation,” when he was 
actually on a dig. ­Attempts were made to censor his writing and restrict his 
speech. But as ­anyone who knows him can attest, and as his life story shows, 
Oscar is not to be deterred. After his reinstatement, he continued to exca-
vate at sites in Turkey and lectured at academic conferences, to the public, 
and to ­students (Plates 0.5–0.6). At the museum, he took on the project of 
publishing all the bronze and iron objects in the department, resulting in his 
award-­winning book, Bronze and Iron: Ancient Near Eastern Artifacts in The 
­Metropolitan ­Museum of Art (1988).30 His next book, The Lie Became Great 
(2000), with its explication of The Forgery Culture and The Museum Ritual, 
has become something of a cult classic.
His last book, Archaeology, Artifacts, and Antiquities of the Ancient Near 
East: Sites, Cultures, and Proveniences (2013), is a collection of 40 ­important 
­articles, spanning his career. This “superb collection of previously ­published 
work” was reviewed by D.T. Potts, who points to some interesting ­features. For 
one, Muscarella identifies himself as an archaeologist and not an ­anthropologist 
or art historian, considering their activities to be a normal part of archaeo-
logical research. Oscar learned at an early date that some “archaeologists” had 
­little knowledge of objects (artifacts) and could not identify them or under-
stand their cultural value. Not so with Muscarella, who has specialized in the 
analysis of artifacts, with an acute understanding of iconography and style.
Muscarella’s point is simply that all artifact analysis belongs to the 
­domain of archaeology, and if style, iconography and form, with 
­exhaustive ­comparison to other excavated material is required, then 
a good archaeologist should certainly not be limited to dealing solely 
30

Institute of America in 1990.

Introduction
with those ­categories of material culture that are not generally deemed 
“art.”31
This understanding led Oscar to the problem of forgeries, of all sorts, includ-
ing the forgery of provenience, made possible by the looting of archaeological 
sites. His work as a museum curator was useful here, as he had access to inside 
knowledge of the antiquities market and the unexcavated objects and ­forgeries 
circulating there. Useful to him, but not to the hierarchy of the Metropolitan 
Museum. He was not your standard curator, certainly, at odds with the old 
guard of museum professionals. But museums have now changed, and Oscar is 
one of those responsible. As Potts observes:
Muscarella has been a vocal and tireless champion of ethics and the 
­exposure of criminal and unethical behavior on the part of collectors and 
museums for decades, and more than any other scholar, he has under-
scored the damage inflicted upon scholarship by the naïve incorporation 
of unexcavated artifacts alongside excavated ones in studies that seek to 
elucidate the past.
As this brief biographical sketch has shown, Oscar has persisted against 
­formidable odds to become one of the profession’s outstanding ­archaeologists, 
in the broadest sense of the term. His work spans an area from Greece to 
­Afghanistan, from the Neolithic to the Persian period, and includes ­excavation 
and survey reports, studies of special types of artifacts such as fibulae and 
­cauldron attachments, catalogues and individual entries, writings on forgeries 
of objects and of cultures, and critiques of scholarly methodology, the antiqui-
ties trade, and the museum profession, not to mention his many reviews. The 
papers in this Festschrift reflect all these interests and concerns. We present 
them here to celebrate Oscar Muscarella’s many achievements—and the man 
himself. A complete list of his excavations and ­publications appears at the be-
ginning of this book.

Oscar White Muscarella and Sherlock Holmes
Laurie Adams
	
Part i: Investigation and Deduction
“The great master of common sense and scientific analysis, Sherlock Holmes, 
never achieved one of his goals, to become an archaeologist—and the disci-
pline has never recovered from the loss. Challenging those who are quick to 
throw out fiats that mask a fiction being created (elementary, he was think-
ing of art historians), Holmes stated ‘I never guess. It is a shocking habit—­
destructive to the logical faculty.’ This says it all.”1 So wrote Dr. Oscar White 
Muscarella, long-time member of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art 
at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, in Chapter 1 of his monumental 
study The Lie Became Great: The Forgery of Ancient Near Eastern Cultures.
When we are introduced to Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet, first pub-
lished in 1887, we are told by Dr. Watson that he is studious and scientific with a 
“passion for definite and exact knowledge.”2 The same can be said of Muscarel-
la, who applies similar qualities to his archaeological investigations as well as 
to his research on artifacts and antiquities, their context, history, and style. Just 
as the detective investigates clues found at the scene of a crime, so the archae-
ologist delves into a site in search of human civilizations. As Muscarella knows 
from a long acquaintance with his Baker Street counterpart, certain elements 
of criminal detection apply to archaeological investigation (Plate 1.1).
In both archaeological and crime sites there should be no interference until 
scholarly and scientific investigation begins. “There is nothing like first-hand 
evidence,” declares Sherlock Holmes.3 The detective, like the archaeologist, 
has to beware of red herrings and tampering with evidence. He or she must 
know how to read and interpret clues, which can be fragmentary, and, as with 
the interpretation of dreams, be able to reconstruct history from fragments. 
“From a drop of water,” declares Holmes, “a logician could infer the possibil-
ity of an Atlantic or a Niagara.”4 Similarly, the archaeologist constructs the

­historical levels of a site from potsherds that create the framework into which 
excavated objects can be situated.
The issue of first-hand evidence is a major theme in Muscarella’s work, 
notably in The Lie Became Great, in which he takes to task the archaeological 
community, as well as museum curators, collectors, dealers, and others who 
contribute to the activity he has termed “bazaar archaeology.”5 Based on the 
desire for profit and various professional and political considerations, bazaar 
archaeology inspires such museum labels as “said to come from” site X, which 
inform us that these antiquities actually derive from looted sites and from the 
purchase of looted objects sold by dealers who are financed by the world-wide 
market for antiquities.
Because there is nothing like first-hand evidence, Muscarella has spilled 
quite a lot of ink deploring the fact that some archaeologists do not fully pub-
lish their sites in a thorough, systematic manner. Taking the case of Hasanlu, a 
major site in Iran (where he has excavated), which has produced an enormous 
amount of first-hand evidence—including thousands of excavated ­objects, 
Muscarella published a detailed summary of the reports of excavations there 
from 1957 to 1974.6 According to him, publications of the excavations that have 
appeared over the past 50 years are “inadequate and inconsistent,”7 which 
thereby obscures our knowledge of much of the site’s history. The Hasanlu 
finds were published in a variety of venues, including journals, popular news-
papers, monographs, festschrifts, surveys, and so forth, but there is “no central 
venue” that presents a complete account or analysis of the art, architecture, 
and “diachronic” cultural development of the site.8 Muscarella quotes the Ira-
nian archaeologist Ali Mousavi (2009): “The final report of the excavations [at 
Hasanlu] has never been published, and the preliminary reports are either in 
the form of news or general syntheses.” In conclusion, Muscarella cites the 
British archaeologist Colin Renfrew (1980): “[F]ailure to produce a full pub-
lished excavation report is simply tantamount to wanton destruction of an ar-
chaeological site.”9
Motives for the kinds of crimes investigated by Sherlock Holmes tend to 
­involve love or money. Motives for looting archaeological sites are also finan-
cially driven and are ultimately inspired by a “love” of, indeed a “lust” for, antiq-
uities and a “passion” for collecting on the part of someone with enough money

to finance the crime. This state of affairs often leads to convoluted fabrications 
of find spots and cultural styles. For example, referring to Median and Hurrian 
art, about which little is known, Muscarella notes in 1987 that “archaeologists 
and art historians, ‘knowing’ it must exist, seek it and find it … Both never-
theless remain elusive.”10 Similarly, in “The Adventure of the Second Stain,” 
Holmes warns that it is “a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts.”11 
And, in “The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge,” Holmes reminds Watson that “it 
is an error to argue in front of your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting 
them round to fit your theories.”12 In 2007, Muscarella notes that conflicts of 
interest result in just such insensible twisting, and perpetuate criminal activ-
ity among dealers, collectors, curators, museum trustees, politicians, and even 
archaeologists. He quotes Renfrew: “The looters are financed … by ­collectors … 
by curators … the acquisitions by museums.”13
The archaeologist, like the detective, confronts false leads in publications 
and in museums, usually resulting from ignorance, or to foil an investigation. 
For example, Holmes advertises a lost wedding ring, which had been dropped 
at the crime scene in A Study in Scarlet, and an old woman, claiming it ­belongs 
to her daughter, comes for it; but she eludes Holmes when he follows her. He 
concludes that she was actually an actor disguised as a woman—i.e. a forg-
ery. Holmes also realizes that, because of the ring, the murderer’s motive must 
have been related to thwarted love. “The Science of Deduction and Analysis,” 
Holmes observes, “is one which can only be acquired by long and patient 
study,”14 which Muscarella advocates for all scholars.
Archaeological deduction is essentially the same as detective work inso-
far as it depends on the ability of the investigator to muster circumstantial as 
well as hard evidence, on a knowledge of ancient history and cultures, and on 
logical thinking. “Breadth of view,” declares Sherlock Holmes in “The Valley of 
Fear,” “…is one of the essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the 
oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest.”15 Such “breadth 
of view” enabled Holmes to discover the culprits in A Study in Scarlet, which 
he solved by reasoning backwards—that is, historically—as well as forward, 
which he calls “synthetically.”16 In “A Case of Identity,” Holmes’s concentration

on seemingly minor details leads him to conclude, for example, that the mark 
of a pince-nez on one’s nose denotes nearsightedness and that mismatched 
boots indicate that a person dressed in a great hurry.17
On occasion, being able to read an inscription accurately can crack a case, 
whether it is criminal or archaeological. Readers of A Study in Scarlet will recall 
that the letters R-A-C-H-E were written in blood at the crime scene. At first the 
London police assumed that the letters referred to a woman named Rachel, 
which they related to a motive involving a thwarted romance. In fact, how-
ever, Holmes, who knew German, recognized that Rache is the German word 
for revenge and thus concluded that while the motive involved a romance, its 
main thrust was revenge.18 Similarly, when Muscarella was investigating the 
siege of a site in northwestern Iran reported by the Assyrian king Sargon ii (in 
714 b.c.), he was able to correct a textual misunderstanding made by another 
scholar. Studying Sargon’s text in order to match the geographic references 
with modern sites, Muscarella recognized that the scholar’s restoration (not 
in the preserved text) of a feminine noun to interpret where water actually 
flowed from the city was misleading. He was thus able to reject that scholar’s 
interpretation of the site’s modern location, which he had identified as Uiše. 
Instead, Muscarella identified the site as Ulhu, which is modern Qalatgah, a 
site that he himself had discovered—all based on textual and archaeologically 
visible evidence.19
When Muscarella was confronted with an eighth-century b.c. child’s 
tomb—Tumulus P at Gordion, the capital of ancient Phrygia—it was his focus 
on a particular detail that led him to deduce that the child must have been 
male, either a prince or a young king.20 This was consistent with the fact that 
Tumulus P was a royal tomb, probably somewhat earlier than the reign of King 
Midas, famed in Greek mythology for his Golden Touch. Muscarella’s deduc-
tion was based on the historical iconography of the parasol, and the fact that 
a “wooden knob with the struts of a collapsible parasol” had been buried with 
the child. Using evidence from other sites that included a third-millennium 
stele from Susa of Sargon i of Akkad, a 13th-century b.c. cylinder seal (unex-
cavated but probably Assyrian), a ninth-century b.c. relief of Ashurnasirpal ii 
from Nimrud, and a fifth-century b.c. Achaemenid relief of Darius i from

Muscarella, “Parasols in the Ancient Near East.”

27

Persepolis, Muscarella demonstrated that the parasol was a gendered artifact, 
a royal male prerogative in the ancient Near East. “It functioned,” he writes, 
“solely as a marker of the king’s rule and authority.”21
The purpose of the parasol was to define the king’s space and protect him 
from the sun, and it evolved from a portable object, carried by an attendant, 
to a baldachin-like structure fixed above the king’s throne. Later, in Greece, 
parasols were commonly used by women and were depicted as carried by ef-
feminate men, to connote ridicule. Thus, although the parasol “continued to 
be a visual marker to delineate social attitudes,” it had evolved into a “more 
democratic” signifier of fashion.22
Muscarella’s long and patient study of the Ziwiye mystery is another instance 
of his application of deductive reasoning. Just as the crime scene in A Study in 
Scarlet contained clues that were seemingly incongruous—the ring, the foot-
steps, the ribbon of blood, pills on the window sill, a telegram from Cleveland, 
and the letters R-A-C-H-E written in blood—so Muscarella discovered the 
­incongruity of published accounts regarding Ziwiye. This site in northwestern 
Iran had been known for three decades when Muscarella published “‘Ziwiye’ 
and Ziwiye: The Forgery of a Provenience.”23 Ziwiye was the alleged origin of 
hundreds of gold, silver, and ivory objects flogged by antiquities dealers, but 
not a single one of which had been excavated: they were plundered antiquities. 
Nevertheless, many archaeologists and art historians willingly overlooked the 
facts of the case and were content to take the word of dealers and museum cu-
rators that the objects were “from Ziwiye.” In his article, Muscarella essentially 
unravels thirty years of false history and myth-making, beginning with the ac-
count of the French archaeologist (and collector) André Godard.
In a 1948 exhibition catalogue, Godard had identified a gold pectoral as found 
on a “mountain near Sakkiz” and four other objects from the “region of Sakkiz.” 
Three of these were in Godard’s own collection and the fourth ­belonged to a 
dealer. In 1949 Godard reported as archaeological fact that the objects were 
found by local villagers in a bronze container. In 1950, in France Illustration, 
Godard’s wife alleged that a young shepherd, guarding his sheep after a storm, 
caught sight of a shiny gold fragment in the fissure of a rock. He summoned 
his fellow shepherds, who enlarged the fissure and discovered several objects 
that appeared like a “gift from God.” Fearful of losing their newfound fortune, 
the youths considered hiding the objects, when along came a Jew who bought

some of them. The following night, the Jew returned and discovered even more 
gold objects, which he hid in his own garden. But the young men told their sto-
ry, the affair became widely known, and the Jew was threatened and robbed. 
Neighboring villagers went to the find site, dug up additional objects, cut them 
up, and divided the pieces among themselves.24
This preposterous story, which shares certain elements with legends about 
the discovery of genius that were current during the Renaissance, became a 
kind of recurring topos to explain the appearance of plundered objects on the 
antiquities market. In Italy, for example, Giotto was portrayed as a shepherd 
tending his sheep. Along came Cimabue, the leading Byzantine painter, who 
saw Giotto drawing the likeness of a sheep on a rock. The older artist was so 
impressed by Giotto’s genius that he obtained his father’s permission to train 
him in his studio. Similarly, the young Castagno, also tending sheep, sought 
shelter from a storm, when he saw local artists at work. He began drawing on 
walls and was discovered by a member of the Medici family, who offered to 
have him trained as an artist. Clearly these are not fact-based stories; they are 
discovery myths designed to convey the startling (and pleasing) character of 
coming upon and recognizing genius. The discovery myths in archaeology, as 
Muscarella has shown on numerous occasions, are designed to forge a prove-
nience that will whitewash the looting of antiquities.
The tale published by Godard’s wife became elaborated over time. The 
shepherds could be workers or women—and the Jew disappears from the 
ongoing stories. The find spot and the dates changed as well. Soon the num-
ber of objects said to be “from Ziwiye” proliferated and filled the display cases 
of ­private dealers, collectors, and museums world-wide. “The single cuve de 
bronze,” writes Muscarella, “accepted by most scholars as originally containing 
the treasure, could never have held all the many hundreds of objects [said to 
be from Ziwiye] in existence;”25
Another French archaeologist, Roman Ghirshman, added over a period of 
twenty-five years many more objects alleged by him to derive from the site. 
In 1964 he concluded that the finds came from the tomb of a Scythian king.26 
(Other scholars have identified Assyrian and Urartian features in their style). 
The collaboration of museums, asserts Muscarella, gave a stamp of authentic-
ity to these spurious scholarly claims.27 Muscarella concludes that some of the 
­“Ziwiye” objects are forgeries; many are authentic but without an ­archaeological

context and should thus be considered individually rather than as belonging to 
a particular hoard or coherent cultural group. The “Ziwiye problem,” ­according 
to Muscarella, hinges on “an audience of credulous individuals whose desire 
for objects qua objects is so insatiable, they will destroy their own discipline in 
order to acquire and publish them.”28
Although Muscarella notes that a few scholars expressed doubts about indi-
vidual “Ziwiye” objects, no one had questioned the overall truth of the discov-
ery “myth.” As Sherlock Holmes says in “The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington 
Plans,” “We must fall back upon the old axiom that when all other contingen-
cies fail, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”29 Readers 
of “Silver Blaze,” the story of the stolen race horse favored to win the Wessex 
Cup, will recall that, for Holmes, the main clue was that the watch dog did not 
bark when the thief entered the stable. From this fact, Holmes concluded that 
the dog knew the thief—the horse’s trainer mistakenly trusted by its owner.30 
The only archaeologist to bark regarding Ziwiye, namely Oscar White Mus-
carella, also exposed the incongruities of other fabricated proveniences—for 
example, that of the “Oxus Treasure,” as well as sites in Luristan and Urartu, 
areas to which are attributed many plundered and forged objects; and many 
of these have been baptized with a site provenience by scholars, dealers, and 
curators. Muscarella thus makes us aware that significant parts of our history 
have been distorted.
In a 2003 article, Muscarella shows how two museums, the British Museum 
in London and the Miho Museum southeast of Kyoto, bought into a mythi-
cal provenience for numerous objects, a good number of which are modern 
forgeries.31 In 1905 O.M. Dalton, curator at the British Museum, published an 
account of a find “discovered” on the Oxus River. In fact, however, the dis-
covery was comprised of several separately uncovered finds along with some 
1,500 coins. In this case, elements of the story included a resident general, one 
A. Cunningham, and a Captain Burton, the latter having been informed in 1880 
that merchants had been robbed of “a quantity of gold” and kidnapped near 
Peshawar in modern Pakistan. Burton allegedly rescued the merchants and 
most of their objects, which were supposedly found at a site on the Oxus. Later 
these merchants sold the objects, some of which were resold in Rawalpindi to 
General Cunningham; the works were all eventually acquired by A.W. Franks, 
who donated them to the British Museum in 1897 (Plates 1.2–1.3). In Dalton’s

account, the objects and the coins were associated with one another, although 
he could not be certain that they were found together.32 In fact, the items came 
from dealers in various places, and it is not known where the merchants who 
were robbed acquired them, how the dealers in the bazaars assembled them, 
or if General Cunningham actually bought the same objects as those originally 
carried by the robbed merchants. Muscarella concludes that there is no Oxus 
Treasure deriving from a single site and that in any case the objects were not 
excavated. The British Museum’s “Oxus Treasure,” he writes, “cannot be ac-
corded archaeological, cultural or historical value for it is nothing more than 
a museum-culture artifact, from time to time polished and glamorized with 
museum-speak rhetoric and defenses.”33
In 1997 the Russian archaeologist I.R. Pichikyan claimed to confirm the Brit-
ish Museum tale, identifying the site of the Oxus Treasure as the very site where 
he himself was excavating a temple: Takht-i Sangin on the Oxus River in Tadjik-
istan.34 He also announced that a second part of the Treasure, now in the Miho 
Museum in Japan, was greater than that in the British Museum. Acccording to 
Pichikyan, “Oxus Treasure 2” was part of an 1877 find, acquired by a man who 
secretly buried it, and it remained hidden until his grandsons rediscovered it 
120 years later and brought it to Peshawar and thence to ­England—a route 
strikingly similar to that of “Oxus Treasure 1” in the British Museum. From 
­England, the new works were transported to Japan. The so-called sources for 
this curious account consisted of “official documents” provided by the Miho 
Museum, no doubt records of dealers, detailing some 3,000 objects dated from 
the sixth century b.c. to the Hellenistic period.35 In 2002 the Miho published a 
catalogue of objects baptized as “Oxus Treasure 2,” with entries by several au-
thors who came to various conclusions—including some concerning “Zoroas-
trian gender customs”—that are considered embarrassing by many scholars.36
In neither museum, according to Muscarella, was an archaeologically dem-
onstrated provenience provided for the objects “said to come from” the Oxus 
River. Many, in his view, are modern forgeries, some made with a crudeness 
of technique and a style that are rare or non-existent in authentic works of 
ancient art. Those identified as Achaemenid do not resemble any known Ach-
aemenid objects. In two cases involving gold plaques,37 Muscarella elaborates

on problematic details, including two left feet, a sword detached from its belt 
and floating in space, and Zoroastrian priests confused with Achaemenid sol-
diers—examples à la Sherlock Holmes in which Muscarella has “both seen 
and observed.”38 “Outside the walls of two museums in opposite corners of the 
world,” concludes Muscarella, “there is no Oxus Treasure. Both ot-1 and ot-2 
are modern constructions documented by pastiches of stories and composed 
of ancient and modern artifacts.”39
In 2004 John Curtis, then Keeper of the Department of the Middle East at 
the British Museum, published a response to Muscarella on the matter of the 
so-called Oxus Treasure.40 Notwithstanding his assertion that the Oxus Trea-
sure has never been claimed to be an archaeological group, Curtis continues to 
refer to the Oxus Treasure as if it were a single entity. Like Muscarella, Curtis 
reviews the 19th- and 20th-century accounts of the finds in all their convoluted 
meanderings from an alleged hoard of gold and silver coins discovered in 1879, 
“eight marches beyond the Oxus, at an old fort, on the tongue of land formed 
by two joining rivers,”41 to the theft from the merchants and Burton’s recovery 
of the objects, to the 1880 exhibition of a gold finger ring (ot 105) in London. 
There the ring was identified as having “been found in Bokhara, in the bed of 
the Oxus.”42
Curtis agrees with Muscarella that there are forgeries among the objects 
said to come from the Oxus Treasure—although not as many as Muscarella 
believes have entered the British Museum. Curtis also disagrees with Pichiky-
an’s view that the Miho objects came from Takht-i Sangin or that they have any 
association with those in the British Museum. To call the Miho objects Oxus 
Treasure 2, Curtis says, is misleading, although he defends the works in his own 
museum. He does assert that further research into the problem is necessary.
One mark of a great scholar is intellectual honesty. The same might be said 
of a great detective—at least one hopes he has a modicum of humility. Where-
as Sherlock Holmes, whose ego is nothing if not large, only tacitly admitted to 
his mistake in not recognizing the forged identity of Irene Adler in “A Scandal 
in Bohemia,” he did not do so with as much forthrightness as Muscarella, when 
he reported on having misjudged the chronology of the site he excavated at 
Sé Girdan, in northwest Iran. Holmes would forever after refer to Adler as the 
woman, indicating both that he had been outwitted by her and that he was a

little bit enamored of her—at the conclusion of the case, he asks the king of 
Bohemia for her photograph.
In 1971, when Muscarella published a group of tumulus burials along with 
axes and adzes from Sé Girdan, he assumed that the artifacts were bronze 
and dated the tumuli from which they were excavated to the seventh or sixth 
century b.c.43 His dating was challenged by the French archaeologist Jean 
­Deshayes as being too late. According to Deshayes, the tumuli were related to 
those found in southern Russia belonging to the Early Bronze Age. He noted 
that the axes and adzes, as well as the tumuli and tomb construction tech-
niques, were formally similar to Early Bronze Age examples from the northern 
Caucasus.
One detail that had escaped Muscarella’s notice was an “absence of iron in 
the tombs and relevance of the presence of ochre.” Based on new evidence of 
a relationship between the Caucasus examples and those at Sé Girdan, Rus-
sian archaeologists disagreed with Muscarella’s dating and argued for an Early 
Bronze Age date. Among the characteristics mentioned were an “outer encir-
cling stone revetment” around the tumuli, similar tomb construction, “body 
positions” of the skeletons, “and the presence of ochre on the bones.”44 In 
addition, the Russians cited socketed axes like those from Sé Girdan. A sepa-
rate find of axes and adzes from Armenia, located between Sé Girdan and the 
northern Caucasus, seemed to confirm the Russian view.
In 2002 Muscarella asked that the composition of an axe and an adze from 
Sé Girdan in the Metropolitan Museum be reanalyzed. The results revealed 
that both were composed of copper and arsenic and had no trace of nickel, 
zinc, tin, or lead. He thus concluded that the axe and adze were made of “ar-
senical copper, not bronze,” suggesting that they were products of the Early 
Bronze Age, not the first millennium b.c. In the final analysis, Muscarella ad-
mits, “J. Deshayes was essentially right after all, I was quite wrong.”45
In the attempt to establish the date of the destruction that ended the early 
Phrygian period at Gordion, it is a case of Muscarella versus the Gordion exca-
vation team—of which he had been a member since 1957.46 Just as Sherlock 
Holmes often had occasion to question and correct the assumptions and data 
of the London police with whom he worked, so Muscarella has had a long-
standing disagreement with some of the Gordion team concerning the use and

non-use of data from the site. The destruction level is now dated by the team 
to ca. 800 b.c. (that is, the end of the ninth century b.c.),47 a conclusion that 
Muscarella believes has been accepted uncritically by a growing number of 
scholars. The team has based its conclusions largely on C-14 analysis of seeds 
from the destruction level, carried out between 2000 and 2004 at the Heidel-
berg Radiocarbon Laboratory, as well as on dendrochronological studies of 
wooden beams from the Gordion city mound. But, as has increasingly become 
the case, the accuracy of C-14 dating has been challenged on several grounds. 
In addition, Muscarella cites evidence against the ninth-century b.c. dating 
of the wooden beams—and notes the common reuse of timbers in antiquity, 
which compromises the use of architectural beams to date a site.
Furthermore, having written extensively on fibulae and arrowheads, topics 
on which he is an acknowledged expert, Muscarella argues that the fibulae and 
arrowheads found in the destruction level and clay fill immediately above it 
all have parallels in the eighth century b.c. or later. He dates the Phrygian and 
imported fibulae from the destruction level to the second half of the eighth (or 
the seventh) century b.c., and the socketed arrowheads found in the clay not 
before ca. 700 b.c.48 Muscarella thus concludes that Midas was king of Phrygia 
at the time of the destruction, running counter to the team’s assertion that 
an earlier king ruled at Gordion during this period—a significant historical 
distinction.49
Muscarella has also written on issues of so-called objective/disinterested 
scientific testing by conservators of objects to determine if they are forgeries.50 
He notes the unrecognized flaws and outright deceptions that can occur in 
such testing, both of which may be used to dupe collectors and, more impor-
tantly, scholars and students—shades of the red herrings confronting detec-
tives such as Sherlock Holmes. These issues concern only unexcavated objects 
sold in “bazaars,” by dealers, or those said to have been found in family attics, 
and they have led to the spurious and exciting concept of the Unikum, an ob-
ject that is “one of a kind,” and thus considered to be more prestigious.
Referring to the technique of thermoluminescence testing for fired terra-
cotta objects, Muscarella notes that it is not quite so accurate as generally be-
lieved. It has a plus-or-minus 8.5% margin of error, and forgers know how to 
falsify the results by incorporating ancient material into the objects to be sci-
entifically tested. In the case of a vessel, typically only its base is tested to avoid

tampering with the main surface, a fact well-known to the forgers, who join an 
authentic base to a forged vessel, which then yields an ancient date. Muscarella 
cites examples of forged terracotta figurines attributed to Neolithic (Hacılar), 
Hittite, Assyrian, and Etruscan cultures, which are exhibited as authentic in 
various museums worldwide. Many silver forgeries also tested and alleged au-
thentic include a cast silver plate formerly in the Norbert Schimmel Collection, 
a griffin vessel in the Miho Museum, and another griffin vessel bought by a 
trustee of the Metropolitan Museum for approximately one million dollars in 
2002 and confiscated in 2003 by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment Agency (ice). This confiscated silver griffin, although a manifest forg-
ery, was returned to Iran as an authentic antiquity in 2013 (Plate 1.4).51 Bronze, 
wood, and stone also present problems of authentication, and in all cases Mus-
carella calls for careful appraisal of the “scientific analysis” carried out before 
accepting the results as objective.
Commenting on conservators and restorers, Muscarella observes that many 
work for museums, and also “work for dealers and collectors,” for whom some 
consciously omit necessary tests to avoid angering a client.52 Forgers are cog-
nizant of museum practices and tailor their forgeries accordingly. For example, 
the widely held view that an object in fragments is likely to be ancient led the 
Saint Louis Art Museum to purchase a fragmentary Etruscan statue of Diana 
that is certainly a forgery. Such factors make it essential that scholars remain 
one step ahead of the forgers, which may not always be the case. As a result, 
students are too often shown forgeries that are presented as genuine objects, 
promoting an erroneous view of ancient style, subject matter, and workman-
ship, and compromising their understanding of ancient art and culture.

The Case of the Euphronios Vase
In the fall of 1972, the Metropolitan Museum devoted an issue of its quarterly 
Bulletin to the acquisition of a spectacular Greek calyx krater (a bowl for mix-
ing water with wine). Produced around 515 b.c., the krater was made using the 
red-figure technique and was signed by the painter Euphronios and the potter 
Euxitheos (Plate 1.5). In the foreword to the Bulletin, the museum’s Director, 
Thomas Hoving, called it “the best in existence.”53
The main text, by Dietrich von Bothmer, Curator in the Department of Greek 
and Roman Art, situates the krater in the context of a well-illustrated overview 
of Greek vase painting. He discusses the krater’s style and technique.54 The 
main subject illustrated is from the Trojan War: Sarpedon, having been slain 
by Patroklos, is carried off the battlefield by the winged gods Sleep and Death. 
Hermes stands behind Sarpedon, and an armed warrior is positioned at each 
side, framing the central scene. Particularly impressive, as von Bothmer indi-
cates, is the extension and turning of Sarpedon’s body to reveal anatomical 
details.
The following year, an article in The New York Times devoted to the acquisi-
tion of the krater quoted some who thought the work was priceless and there-
fore a welcome addition to the collection.55 But others worried that its high 
cost would serve to encourage the looting of antiquities. Muscarella agreed 
with the latter view and is quoted on the provenience of the krater in the Times 
article: “One must know where the vase came from. There may be other objects 
with it, if it came from a tomb. Without its place of discovery, it is impossible to 
reconstruct its historical context.” He accused the museum trustees of having 
“abdicated responsibility” in not investigating the provenience before buying 
the krater. Ashton Hawkins, the museum Secretary (and an attorney), claimed 
that the trustees had information on the dealers who sold the vase. The origi-
nal dealer was identified as an Armenian, referred to by Muscarella as a deus ex 
machina, and the dealer who sold the vase to the museum was Robert Hecht, 
later indicted for selling looted works. According to Hawkins, the krater had 
been restored in Switzerland from fragments.
Needless to say, the trustees were not pleased with Muscarella’s public com-
ments, and decided then and there to fire him (Plate 1.6). He had previously

been fired by Hoving (in 1971) for internal policy disagreements,56 including 
the museum’s restrictions on academic freedom and the issue of women’s 
rights in matters of promotion and salary. He was shifted from one bare office 
to another, isolated from his department, his internal mail was confiscated, 
he was spied on when lecturing, and he was removed from teaching in the 
Museum Training Program in the middle of a semester. Muscarella had tenure, 
however, and in 1972 he hired a lawyer57 and filed a complaint.58 A temporary 
restraining order and preliminary injunction were secured, and Muscarella 
was subsequently reinstated.59 But he was fired again in October 1973 over the 
Euphronios matter, in a letter from Hoving accusing him of “unprofessional 
and improper conduct”60 (i.e. his objection to the museum’s purchase of plun-
dered objects, although this was not stated as the reason).
In September 1974 Hoving submitted his final recommendation to dismiss 
Muscarella to the Board of Trustees of the museum.61 Following this, Ash-
ton Hawkins informed Muscarella that the Board had “unanimously decided 
to approve this recommendation,” the termination date being December 31, 
1974.62 At the time, the trustees included Terence Cardinal Cooke, Arthur Ochs 
Sulzberger (Publisher of The New York Times), Abraham D. Beame (Mayor of 
the City of New York), and Harrison J. Goldin (Comptroller of the City of New 
York). The upshot was a fact-finding proceeding presided over by Harry I. Rand, 
a lawyer in the firm of Botein, Hays, Sklar & Herzberg, who was appointed by 
Hawkins. During the course of the proceeding, Muscarella continued to pro-
test the museum’s purchases of looted antiquities in lectures and publications.
The testimony ocurred in September and November 1975. Witnesses testi-
fied regarding Muscarella’s character and scholarship, and vigorous efforts 
were made to discredit his competence as an archaeologist and curator. Fol-
lowing the proceedings, Rand compiled his report, which was issued in March 
1976.63 He summarized the charges and concluded, “I find that the evidence

does not support any of the charges stated in the Director’s notice of October 
12, 1973, addressed to Dr. Muscarella … I have found that none of the causes for 
dismissal noticed in the Director’s letter of October 12, 1973 is sustained by the 
Record.”64 Rand assessed the museum for Muscarella’s legal fees—these, along 
with the museum’s own expenditures for the proceedings, were all ultimately 
paid by the New York City taxpayers. Muscarella’s tenure was also reconfirmed, 
although precisely because of his trial, the trustees had abolished tenure at the 
Metropolitan in 1974.
As a postscript to the case, The New York Times reported on January 11, 2008, 
that the following Sunday would be the last chance to see the Euphronios 
­krater in the museum. Over three decades after its acquisition—again at a cost 
to city taxpayers—the krater was repatriated. The Italian government alleged 
that it had been illegally looted from an Etruscan tomb in Cerveteri and had 
put Hecht on trial in Rome. The Metropolitan saved some face by announc-
ing a deal, in which it would return twenty-one objects to Italy in exchange 
for a loan of three ancient Greek vases—an exchange Muscarella has called 
“ransom.”
	
The Case of the “Lydian Hoard”
From 1966 to 1970 the Metropolitan Museum acquired a group of 363 valu-
able works camouflaged and displayed in a gallery known as the Greek and 
Roman Treasury. In fact, however, they were plundered from Lydia, the home 
of the vastly wealthy King Croesus, in what is now western Turkey (Plates 1.7, 
32.11, and 42.4). In the summer of 1966, Muscarella was told that a collection 
had been purchased from the dealer John Klejman. According to Muscarella, 
a 1967 memo from a member of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern 
Art warned Hoving not to refer to the objects as East Greek, an area that in-
cluded Anatolia (modern Turkey) in ancient times, lest the Turks ask for them  
back.65
A report of the Metropolitan Museum’s acquisitions committee dated No-
vember 7, 1968, listed “Ninety-six objects, East Greek, second half of the sixth 
century b.c., said to come from the same general area of central Anatolia [ital-
ics mine] as East Greek Treasure acquired in 1966 and 1967.” The cost was given 
as $67,000, with a note to the effect that “installation and restoration costs 
[were] to be determined.”66 The seller of the objects cited in the report was 
one George Zacos of Switzerland.

According to a 1987 article in Connoisseur by Melik Kaylan,67 the objects 
in the “hoard” derived from four illegal excavations; the robbers included one 
­Osman, a blacksmith, who was a member of the only team of looters appre-
hended.68 According to the Turks, the hoard was purchased by a dealer in 
Izmir, known as Ali Baba, who sold it to antiquities dealer John Klejman, who 
sold it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. As reported by Kaylan, in 1969 An-
drew Oliver, a Metropolitan Museum curator in the Department of Greek and 
Roman Art, quietly visited the tomb looted by Osman and identified a stone 
sphinx that had an exact counterpart in the museum’s collection.69
Against this backdrop of events, Muscarella played his part. In the early 
1970’s, he had written a memo at von Bothmer’s request reporting on two 
­frescoes in the Metropolitan Museum; he did not then know their provenience, 
whether Anatolia or elsewhere (and was, at that time, unaware of the nature 
and extent of the plunder culture). His memo indicated that the frescoes were 
similar to paintings found at Gordion dated to the sixth century b.c. In addi-
tion, he reported that the museum’s frescoes were larger and better preserved 
than those at Gordion. Sometime after the acquisition, Muscarella was secretly 
shown a brief glimpse of the basement storage room where the frescoes were 
being kept together with many gold and silver objects—the one and only time 
he saw the entire collection together.70 (Later, when the Turks checked the 
original tomb, they found that frescoes had been cut from the walls.)71
In the summer of 1984, the Metropolitan Museum published a small part of 
the Lydian Hoard in a Bulletin titled “A Greek and Roman Treasury,” with text 
by Dietrich von Bothmer. All the objects were described as Greek, although 
a number were clearly Achaemenid, reflecting Persian hegemony in the re-
gion.72 Earlier, a few objects had been displayed in the museum and also la-
beled Greek. Muscarella objected to the false information on the labels, in a 
conversation with William Luers, then President of the Metropolitan. When 
Muscarella lectured, memos indicate that he was monitored by the museum, 
because of fears that he might mention the plunder.

ing, and the Curator of Greek and Roman Art, Dietrich von Bothmer.

Oscar White Muscarella and Sherlock Holmes
Meanwhile the Turks were growing more aware of the situation and arrest-
ed some of the robbers in their local villages, recognizing that several of the 
confiscated objects paralleled those in the Metropolitan Museum. As early as 
1973, Muscarella met with Burhan Tezcan, a Turkish archaeologist and govern-
ment representative, who wanted to see the pieces in the museum. Muscarella 
informed Turkish authorities about the objects he had seen, especially the 
frescoes. Von Bothmer did not respond to Tezcan’s request to see the works 
in his department, but later that year he sent Tezcan photos of eight of the 
objects. Thirteen years later, on October 13, 1986, Muscarella was contacted by 
United States Customs official Charles Koczka, who asked him to meet with 
the Turkish consul. Muscarella met the consul on October 21 and agreed to 
help Turkey in its attempt to recover the hoard. They discussed the finds, in-
cluding the ­frescoes—crucial information, inasmuch as it was knowledge of 
their existence that enabled the Turks to recover the complete collection. The 
frescoes in the museum could be measured and analyzed, along with the ex-
tant remains, and gaps, in the plundered tombs. Muscarella recommended the 
attorney Harry Rand, who, along with Lawrence Kaye and their colleagues at 
the law firm of Herrick, Feinstein, succeeded in having the entire collection 
returned to its country of origin in 1993.73
A sequel to this case can be found in the pages of Thomas Hoving’s arti-
cle of June 1993 titled “Turkish Delight.”74 There the former museum director 
asserts that Turkey “is the world’s top supplier of Classical works to Western 
­markets—all illicit.”75 He admits that the “Lydian Hoard” was “dubbed the 
‘East Greek’ treasure in what would appear to have been an attempt to push 
the find toward Greece and away from ancient Turkey,” and calls it “a 225-piece 
collection of silver, gold, and bronze objects” purchased in the 1960’s from 
Klejman, who bought it from “Ali Bayırlar—a.k.a. Ali Baba.”76 The Metropoli-
tan stonewalled; the Turks went to court and won. In 1992 a delegation from 
the museum, including the subsequent Director, Philippe de Montebello, the 
President, William Luers, and Secretary Ashton Hawkins, travelled to Turkey to 
73	
O.W. Muscarella, personal communication. On a visit to Turkey by Muscarella in the 
1990’s, after the return of the Lydian Hoard, Dr. Engin Özgen, Director of the Turkish De-
partment of Antiquities, thanked him personally and remarked on his pivotal role in the 
recovery of the collection. See Kaye, “The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny,” and Greenfield, 
“Elementary,” in this volume for further ramifications of this case.

admit that the objects were indeed Lydian and tried to arrange for a five-year 
loan, which the Turks refused to discuss.
	
Part iii: An Unsolved Case
Despite the successful resolutions regarding the Euphronios krater and the 
“Lydian Hoard,” some cases remain unsolved. In 2005 Muscarella published an 
example of a scholarly conundrum regarding two unexcavated statues of Gu-
dea, the late-third-millennium b.c. governor of Lagash—modern Al-Hiba—
in Sumerian Mesopotamia.77 Ideally, as we have seen, archaeological objects 
should have been legally excavated and documented, studied in terms of their 
context and history, and published in a thorough excavation report. When an 
object’s provenience is unknown, the art of connoisseurship comes into play. 
But what happens when the conclusions of connoisseurship studies conflict 
with the conclusions of philologists—in this case those dealing with cunei-
form inscriptions?
Muscarella’s discussion of a seated diorite Gudea (labeled Statue P) in the 
Metropolitan Museum and a green stone paragonite standing Gudea (Statue 
M) in the Detroit Institute of Arts illustrates the problem. The Metropolitan 
Gudea, according to Muscarella’s formal analysis, parallels a known authen-
tic (because excavated) seated Gudea statue from Tello in the Louvre, but the 
Metropolitan figure is unexcavated. On the basis of his analysis, Muscarella 
concluded that the statue in the Metropolitan Museum could be authentic. 
The paragonite standing figure in Detroit, on the other hand, is aberrant in 
style and smaller than any other known statue of Gudea. The face, eyes, ears, 
hand position and hat are anomalous, and the ankle-length robe does not fall 
in a way that matches the Gudea canon. Some scholars have called the Detroit 
figure a forgery, while others have defended it. Although Muscarella agrees that 
the style of the Detroit Gudea raises problems of authenticity, he nevertheless 
notes that cuneiformists stand by the accuracy of the statue’s inscription. Both 
statues surfaced in the antiquities market during the early 1920s.
A complication likewise appears when the seated Metropolitan Gudea is 
compared to a similar, authentic (because excavated) Gudea statue in the 
Louvre (Statue C), inasmuch as they both bear the same statue name. As the 
excavated examples suggest, each Gudea statue was given a unique personal 
name, identifying the image as a distinct representation of the king—one in 
which the body and spirit of the king actually resided. For the Sumerians none 
77

of these works was considered a mere “statue.” It is thought to be impossible 
for two statues to bear the same name, which creates a problem for the unex-
cavated Metropolitan statue (P) vis-à-vis the excavated Louvre statue (C). As 
for the Detroit statue, it has the same inscription as two other Gudea statues 
(Statues N and O), but it is inscribed with a different statue name, and thus by 
Sumerian standards is a different “statue.” Hence its inscription is not suspect, 
although its appearance is, which creates a conundrum in terms of whether it 
is or is not forgery.
We are thus left without a definitive solution—only various possibilities. A 
modern forger could have made the Detroit statue and a modern cuneiform-
ist could have added a viable inscription and a unique name. If the Metropol-
itan Gudea were a forgery, it might have been made to resemble the Louvre 
figure, an accurate inscription would have been added, and its name copied 
by a forger unaware of the uniqueness of the name of each Gudea statue. 
Or perhaps more than one statue of Gudea could have been given the same 
name, with the accidents of archaeological discovery serving to limit our un-
derstanding of the ancient practice. Needless to say, many such problems 
would be solved if all the statues now in museums and private collections 
had been excavated, legally acquired, and properly documented. The Gudea 
conundrum is but one justification for Oscar Muscarella’s long-standing fight 
against the antiquities market—“bazaar archaeology”—driven by profit at 
the expense of history.

The King Has Ass’s Ears! The Myth of Midas’s Ears
Susanne Berndt*
	
Introduction
The Phrygian King Midas is a well-known but often ridiculed figure in Greek 
sources, and there are several stories in which he is the main character. One 
such story is about the ass’s ears of Midas. Several scholars have discussed this 
legend, and several suggestions as to why he became associated with such ears 
have been proposed, but there is no general consensus.1 In this paper I will 
begin by examining the iconographic and literary evidence, before presenting 
my own explanation as to why Midas in Greek sources was said to have had 
ass’s ears.
	
The Iconographic Evidence
The earliest known images of Midas date to around 550 b.c. and are found 
on Greek vases. In addition to representations on Greek vases, there are a few 
images on coins, one on a terracotta applique medallion, and one possible  
depiction in a Roman wall painting.2 There are no known Phrygian images of 
1	 Miller, “Midas as the Great King,” nn. 15 and 16, has listed earlier scholars’ suggestions as to 
why Midas was depicted with ass’s ears. To this list should be added: Thiel, Midas; Vassi-
leva, King Midas, 143; Vassileva, “King Midas’ Ass’s Ears”; Morris, “Imaginary Kings,” 8; Morris, 
“Midas as Mule.”

2, Beazley Archive, no. 217594, Lugano Painter) and 27 (=ARV2 273, 22, Beazley Archive, no. 
202854, Harrow Painter) have by some scholars been suggested to be representations of 
Midas, but their identification is uncertain. See Miller, “Midas,” nos. 1–6 for coins, no. 42 for 
the terracotta applique medallion, and no. 45 for the wall painting. Miller, “Midas,” also lists 
other uncertain and unlikely representations of Midas.

Midas.3 The scenes showing Midas on Greek vases all depict the same episode, 
that is, when the captured Silenus is brought to Midas after his abduction by 
Phrygian hunters.
	
The Archaic Period
Midas is never depicted with ass’s ears during the Archaic period, but rather he 
is portrayed in a Greek environment with human ears. There are in total four 
known images of Midas dating to the Archaic period (Table 2.1, nos. 1–4). The 
earliest of these depictions is found on a fragmentary black-figured lebes or 
strainer from Eleusis, dated to around 550 b.c. (Figure 2.1; Table 2.1, no. 1).4 Here 
a seated figure, holding a spear or scepter, is probably correctly identified as 
Midas based on the iconographic context.5 A chained satyr (Silenus) is brought 
to him by a hunter, dressed in a chlamys and holding a spear. Midas is depict-
ed as a Greek man, dressed in a chiton and chlamys and seated on an okladias 
(folding stool). He is shown bareheaded, bearded, and with human ears.
A second preserved image of Midas is found on an Attic black-figured am-
phora, of unknown provenence, dated to about 540 b.c. (Table 2.1, no. 2).6 A 
bound satyr (Silenus) is presented to Midas, who is seated on an okladias, by 
a hunter wearing a pilos, chitoniskos, skin, and boots. Midas is wearing a hima-
tion and fillet, i.e., he is depicted in the usual Greek manner. Behind him stands 
a winged female figure with her left arm raised in a similar position to that of 
the fragmentary figure behind Midas on the Eleusis vase (Figure 2.1). Behind 
this winged figure stands a draped youth.
The third image of Midas is on an Attic black-figured mastoid cup from Vulci 
in Etruria, dated to around 520 b.c. (Table 2.1, no. 3).7 Midas is again seated on 
an okladias, holding a sceptre and wearing a chiton, himation and fillet. A youth 
(hunter), holding a spear, dressed in a chitoniskos, skin, and boots, is presenting 
the captured Silenus to him. Behind this hunter there is yet another hunter, 
and behind Midas there is again a standing woman with a staff or spear.
The last image of Midas from the Archaic period is found on an Attic black-­
figured lekythos from Sicily, dated to about 500 b.c. (Figure  2.2; Table  2.1, 
3	 A Hellenistic terracotta bust from Gordion of a man with ass’s ears is more probably to be 
interpreted as a satyr, as he is naked and has the typical nose and face of a satyr. See Romano, 
Terracotta Figurines, 18–19, no. 35, plate 11.

The King Has Ass’s Ears! The Myth of Midas’s Ears
Midas is bearded, sitting on a klismos and holding a sceptre. He is dressed in 
a chiton and himation, and he wears a fillet.10 A second inscription occurs at 
the right, under the palm tree, and a third appears above Silenus. However, 
neither of these two inscriptions makes any sense. It is uncertain who the man 
on the right is intended to be, but Roller has suggested that it is a mirror image 
of Midas.11
To conclude, during the Archaic period Midas is always portrayed with hu-
man ears, in Greek clothing, and bareheaded. The scenes are set outdoors, with 
Midas seated on Greek-style furniture.
	
The Classical Period
For the next 50 years we lack images of Midas.12 Scenes where Silenus is caught 
can be found until ca. 470 b.c., but on those Midas is missing.13 Then suddenly 
around 440 b.c. we have three more or less contemporary images of Midas, but 
he is now depicted in a dramatic new iconographic context (Table 2.1, nos. 5–7). 
The episode represented remains the same, but the scenography is new. These 
three images are found on a kylix, a stamnos, and a bell krater respectively.
10	
I am not able to see the fillet in published photographs of the scene, but according to 
Miller he wears one, and the fillet is also depicted in a published drawing of the scene. See 
Walters, “Vases,” figure 9, here Figure 2.2.

An Attic red-figured neck amphora dated to around 480 b.c. (Miller, “Midas,” no. 27; ARV2 
273, 22; Beazley Archive, no. 202854, Harrow Painter) shows, on one side, the bound Si-
lenus driven by a hunter and, on the other side, a standing man holding a staff, who has 
been interpreted by some scholars as Midas (see Miller, “Midas,” no. 27 for references). 
The man is bearded, has human ears, and wears a himation. However, other than his ap-
pearance on the same vase as the apprehended Silenus, there is no indication that he is 
meant to represent Midas.
13	
The capture of Silenus without Midas appeared on Greek vases somewhat earlier than 
those depicting him together with Midas. For scenes of the capture of Silenus without 
Midas, see e.g. Miller, “Midas,” nos. 21 (=abv 79, dated 560 b.c.), 7 (dated 550–525), 8 
(dated 560), 9 (=abv 384, 19, dated 510–500), 11 (dated 500–490), 22 (=abv 396, 24, dated 
500–490), 23 (=abv 482, 4, dated 500–490), and possibly nos. 33 (dated 560), 15 (dated 
575–550), 16 (dated 550), and 17 (=ARV2 320, 9, dated 500–490). Vases later than 500 b.c. 
depicting the caught Silenus are Miller, “Midas,” nos. 24 (dated 490), 27 (=ARV2 273, 22, 
dated 480), 28 (dated 470), and possibly 25 (=ARV2 651, 28, dated 480–470) and 43 (dated 
480–470).

54
The new iconography is clearest on a well-known Attic red-figured stamnos 
from Chiusi (Plate 2.1; Table 2.1, no. 6).14 Two of the vases (the stamnos and the 
krater) depict the bound Silenus being presented by a guard to a seated Midas, 
while the third (the kylix) excludes Silenus himself, with only Midas and the 
guard being represented. The iconography has changed dramatically and fea-
tures several new details. Midas is now for the first time (on Greek vases) de-
picted with ass’s ears, which from this time on becomes the customary way to 
depict him. All three vases from this period show Midas with these ears.
As Miller has explicitly demonstrated, the environment on these vases im-
itates a Persian audience scene.15 It is important to emphasize that what is 
­depicted is the Greek perception of the contemporary Persian court and court 
life, which, as pointed out by Miller, explains the inaccuracy of some details. 
On the stamnos, standing behind Midas is a female fan-bearer, the Greek 
perception of a beardless eunuch attendant.16 That she is imitating a Persian 
attendant is clear not only from her position and attribute but also from her 
dress, as she is wearing a sleeved chiton. On the krater the fan-bearing atten-
dant is also a female, but here she stands in front of the seated Midas. The 
captors of Silenus appear now rather as guards than hunters,17 and their outfits 
bear witness to Persian influence. For example, the guard bringing Silenus to 
the king is wearing a Persian-style hood (so-called kitaris).
Midas himself is seated facing left on the vases produced in Attica, in con-
trast to all the earlier ones, where he was shown facing right (Table 2.1).18 Fur-
thermore, he is no longer seated on a simple okladias; instead, on the stamnos 
he is provided with a diphros and footstool, which closely recall the throne 
and footstool of the Persian king, such as those used by Xerxes in the audience 
scene on the Apadana reliefs (Plate 2.2).19 In addition, Midas is now depicted 
with ass’s ears and headgear, in contrast to the earlier images where he had hu-
man ears and was either bareheaded or only crowned with a fillet. The scene 
should now be understood as taking place in the palace, as a column is seen

55
The King Has Ass’s Ears! The Myth of Midas’s Ears
behind the King in at least two examples.20 The earlier Archaic scenes did not 
contain any such indication of a palace, and the lekythos from Sicily may have 
been intended to represent an outdoor setting, because Midas is seated in front 
of a palm tree next to a fountain house (Figure 2.2).
In addition to those on Greek vases, images of Midas with ass’s ears also 
­occur on coins from Phocaea. There are two different coin types depicting him 
with these ears, for which Bodenstedt has suggested dates of ca. 450 and 446 
b.c. respectively.21 On the reverse of both these coin types is a quadrapartite 
incuse. Another coin belonging to the same series, issued 448 b.c., depicts Si-
lenus. Bodenstedt has suggested that there may be a connection between these 
coins.22 Of importance here is that both the coins and the Attic vases depicting 
Midas with ass’s ears date to the same period, that is, the 440s b.c.
Midas does not appear on any other coins from this period, and it is not un-
til late Roman Imperial times that we found him again on coins, but now as the 
founding hero of some cities in Asia Minor with his ears hidden by a so-called 
Phrygian cap.23
To conclude, the iconography of the Greek vases of the Classical period re-
flect the Persian court, where Midas acts as a metaphor for the (contemporary) 
Persian king. That Midas would act as a metaphor for the Persian king is not 
surprising: during the Classical period in Greece, Midas was perceived as the 
foremost representantive of an Oriental king, in addition to being a figure of 
ridicule.24 The ass’s ears appear persistently together with this changed ico-
nography, and we may therefore search for an explanation for them in a con-
temporary Persian imperial context rather than in an earlier Phrygian setting.
	
Literary Evidence
We will now examine the literary sources that refer to the ears of Midas. The 
earliest written testimony of Midas’s ears is found in Aristophanes’s Plutus 
(286–287), dated to 388 b.c. Here the ass’s ears are mentioned in such a way 
that it is clear that they were well known by this time, but Aristophanes does

not explain why Midas had such ears. The reasons why Midas had ears of an 
ass varied among the ancient authors (see Table 2.2, below).
The ancient author who provides the most detailed description of what hap-
pened to Midas after he received these animal ears is Ovid. This is our only pre-
served source telling the entire story; other extant authors confine themselves 
to mentioning why or how Midas got the ears. Ovid (Met. 11.146–193) relates 
that Apollo drew out the length of the ears so much that they came to resem-
ble those of an ass as a punishment for the king’s support of the satyr Marsyas 
in a musical contest between Marsyas and Apollo. It has been ­suggested that 
the connection Ovid makes between the ears and the musical contest is later 
in date than the original attribution of the ears.25 Ovid continued the story by 
saying that Midas hid his ears beneath a purple tiara. The only person who was 
allowed to see them was the servant who also acted as his barber. Not daring to 
tell anyone, the barber dug a hole in the ground into which he whispered the 
secret. One day the reeds growing above the filled-in hole began to move and 
rustle in the wind, thereby disclosing the king’s secret. Ovid wrote:
Midas had ears of a slow-moving ass. Midas, careful to hide his long ears, 
wore a purple tiara over both, which hid his foul disgrace from laughter. 
But one day a servant, who was chosen to cut his hair with steel, when it 
was long, saw his disgrace. He did not dare reveal what he had seen, but 
eager, to disclose the secret, dug a shallow hole, and in a low voice told 
what kind of ears were on his master’s head. All this he whispered in the 
hollow earth he dug, and then he buried all he said by throwing back the 
loose earth in the hole so everything was silent when he left. A grove thick 
set with quivering reeds began to grow there, and when it matured, about 
twelve months after that servant left, the grove betrayed its planter. For, 
moved by a gentle South Wind, it repeated all the words which he had 
whispered, and disclosed from earth the secret of his master’s ears.26
A reference to this same story may be found in Philostratus the Elder (Imagines 
1.22, second century a.d.) who, in connection with a description of a painting 
25	
Schefold, Götter- und Heldensagen, 73, claimed that the connection between Midas’s ears 
and the musical contest is later than the ears themselves. According to Vassileva, King 
Midas, 143, the role of Midas as a judge in the musical contest seems late, but no date is 
specified. See also Vassileva, “Midas’ Ass’s Ears,” 238–239. For a summary of earlier schol-
ars who discuss the question of Midas’s ass’s ears, see above, n. 1.

of Midas, mentions that the earth could not keep the secret it heard. Persius 
(a.d. 34–62) and Petronius (ca. a.d. 27–66) also make references to this story.27
Ovid further describes in some detail how Midas’s ears were transformed 
into those of an ass, namely that they were drawn out in length as a punish-
ment. However, the earlier Clearchus of Soli (fourth–third century b.c.) also 
described the same procedure,28 i.e. that the ears were drawn out so they 
came to resemble those of an ass. Midas received them as a punishment, 
but in Clearchus’s version it was not Apollo who punished him, but instead 
a Lydian nobleman who was seeking revenge for reasons that are not very 
clear. The bottom line, however, is that Midas was misusing his power. The 
mythical Lydian queen Omphale also played a part in the story, as she too was 
punished by this same nobleman.29 Both Clearchus and Ovid locate the story 
in Lydia, and one further detail connects the stories of these writers, namely 
that Midas wore purple. Ovid tells us that the tiara worn by Midas was purple, 
while Clearchus does not specify the clothing other than its being purple. The 
color purple was the most luxurious color and as such was suitable for a king, 
while the tiara may reflect a Persian setting found in the original version. 
Hence, evidence supporting the Persian environment in the iconography of 
the Classical period is present also in the literary sources. I will now proceed 
to examine why Midas, as a metaphor for the Persian king, was depicted with 
ass’s ears.
	
The Historical Context
When we examine the ancient sources concerning why Midas had ass’s ears, 
we should separate historical explanations from mythological ones. Such a 
division of the explanations in the ancient sources makes them appear less 
confusing (see Table 2.2). There is only one historical or rational explanation 
provided in the ancient sources, while the mythological explanations are sev-
eral, but in all those versions the ears are regarded as a punishment inflicted 
on Midas for his hybris.

The King Has Ass’s Ears! The Myth of Midas’s Ears
The iconographic change should be dated some time between 500 and 
450/440 b.c., based on the dates of the latest image of Midas with human ears 
and the earliest image of him with ass’s ears. It is more likely that this icono-
graphic change occurred closer to the middle of the fifth century than at the 
beginning, because the new iconography appears on several objects that are 
more or less contemporary.
As concluded above, the ass’s ears form part of a dramatic new iconography, 
which reflects Persian imperial iconography. The explanation for the ears may 
therefore be sought in the Greek perception of the Persian king and Persian 
court life of the mid-fifth century b.c. The only non-mythological explanation 
provided by Conon and other ancient authors is that the ears symbolized the 
spies of Midas.30 Let us consider this explanation in the light of the contempo-
rary Greek perception of the Persian king.
During the mid-fifth century it became popular in Greece to refer to the 
spies or the informers of the Persian king as the King’s Ears or Eyes. The earli-
est extant use of the expression is found in Aeschylus’s tragedy The Persians 
(472 b.c.), where the King’s Eye is referred to as an office of the Persian King.31 
This expression became widely used during the fifth century, e.g. by Herodotus 
(1.114) and Aristophanes (Acharnians 91–100). From the latter context it is clear 
that the position held by the so-called King’s Eye was one of a spy. The earliest 
extant reference to the King’s Ear is found in Xenophon (Cyropaedia 8.2.10–11, 
ca. 362/361 b.c.), but it is evident that this proverbial expression had already 
been in use for some time. Before examining the mythological explanations, I 
would like to suggest that the ass’s ears of Midas were intended to be a refer-
ence to the spies of the Persian king.
Let us now reconsider the story of the barber with this perspective in mind. 
The point of this story is that the barber or servant of Midas had learned a se-
cret, which he was either not allowed or too afraid to share with anyone other 
than the king. The servant in the story may be compared with the informer 
of the King, who likewise held secrets he was not allowed to share with any-
one but the King. Xenophon’s description of an informer to the Persian King 
resembles to a very high extent the situation of the barber. Xenophon writes 
(Cyrop. 8.2.12), “people are everywhere afraid to say anything to the discredit of 
the king, just as if he himself were listening.” Hence we may suggest that the 
mythological explanation, as provided by Ovid, is also a reflection of the same 
explanation that is given by Conon.

There has been some discussion as to whether the King’s Eyes and Ears 
actually reflect Persian functionaries, and no definite conclusion has been 
reached.32 From our point of view, however, it is of secondary importance 
whether such titles actually existed in Persia. What is important in this context 
is the prevalent Greek perception that the Persian king surrounded himself 
with spies referred to as the King’s Eyes or Ears. Hirsch, who has dealt with this 
subject, comes to the conclusion that possibly the King’s Eyes and Ears were 
products of Greek fancy. The Greeks were obsessed with the spies of the king, 
about whom there were numerous anecdotes, rumors, and stories.33 Thus to 
depict the Persian king (officially named Midas) with ass’s ears may be inter-
preted as another expression of the same spy phobia.
To summarise, it is suggested that the ass’s ears with which Midas is de-
picted may originally have been a reference to the informer of the Persian king, 
who in Greece was known as the King’s Ear. This theory is supported by the fact 
that the ass’s ears first appeared in Greek depictions imitating Persian impe-
rial iconography, around the same time (mid-fifth century b.c.) as the expres-
sion the King’s Ear became proverbial in Greece. It is further supported by the 
ancient authors who provide us with a non-mythological explanation of the 
ears. Reminiscent of this historical explanation is the mythological story told 
by Ovid, wherein the barber brings to mind the position of an informer.
	
The Original Medium of Midas’s Ears
We have so far given a plausible explanation of why Midas was provided with 
ass’s ears around the mid-fifth century b.c., but two questions remain. The first 
question to address is the original source of the ears, i.e., in what medium did 
they first appear? The second question is why the ears of an ass were chosen to 
illustrate the King’s Ears.
Considering that the new iconography appeared on several vases from the 
440s with identical details, such as the position of Midas facing left, the fan 
bearer, a guard instead of a hunter, etc., one may suggest that there was not 
only a written source (upon which the account of Ovid was based) but that 
there was also a visual source on which the vase paintings were based. The 
most plausible source would be some kind of stage performance, such as a 
satyr play, comedy, tragedy, dithyramb, or some other kind of performance.

The King Has Ass’s Ears! The Myth of Midas’s Ears
The coins of Midas issued at Phocaea may provide support for such a theory. 
A large number of coins from Phocaea bear motifs taken from satyr plays, com-
edies, and other literary works performed on stage, and the coins depicting 
Midas appear in such a series of coins.34
A scholiast to Aristophanes (Acharnians 91–125) further informs us about 
how the King’s Eye should be equipped on stage, with a single eye on his 
mask,35 which indicates that the Greek audience was familiar with the King’s 
Eye and the King’s Ear in a scenographic setting. Considering this, if Midas 
dressed as the Persian king in a Persian context appeared on stage with exag-
gerated long ears, resembling those of an ass, we can be certain that the audi-
ence would have immediately made the connection with the King’s Ears. It is 
in this context also appropriate to address how the event with Midas’s ears may 
have been actually staged.36 We have two written accounts telling the same 
story of how the ears were transformed, namely that the ears were drawn out 
in length so they came to resemble those of an ass.37 This transformation ap-
pears to have a visual origin rather than literary one, and it is possible that the 
source of this description was a theater performance. If the story was written 
with the original intent of being performed on stage, then it was not practically 
feasible for Midas suddenly to have ass’s ears, which on the other hand is fully 
possible in a literary account not intended for performance. But for an event 
performed on stage, a practical solution was required. Preserved literary ac-
counts may indeed be interpreted as describing how this transformation was 
handled in front of an audience. We may consider a mask worn by the Midas 
actor, where the long ears were hidden inside the mask and simply drawn out 
in their entire length by the actor who punished him.
It is more difficult to try to determine which type of theatrical perfomance 
may have been the source. Considering that the vase paintings depict Midas 
as part of the story of Midas catching Silenus, a satyr play may appear as a 
plausible source, something that has also been suggested by other scholars.38 
However, the reference to the Persian king and his spies must be considered 
as a contemporary political subject and as such not suitable for a satyr play. 
Contemporary political mocking was, on the other hand, an appropriate and

popular topic for a comedy, especially during the fifth century.39 Masks and 
costumes used in Old Comedy employed many different kinds of visual effects 
to a much higher extent than in tragedies,40 which may be a further indication 
that the original source was a comedy rather than any other type of drama.
Old Attic comedies were performed each year at the competition of the 
Great Dionysia from 486 b.c. onward, and from 440 they were also included in 
the Lenaea.41 Cratinus (fl. ca. 455–430 b.c.) is the earliest and most significant 
representative of Old Comedy; he often choose to mock contemporary politi-
cans, and he also used myths to make parodies of them. Perikles is one of the 
figures he mocked on stage, and it has been suggested that during this period 
Aspasia became known as Omphale in various plays.42 Omphale was the name 
of several plays, both comedies and satyr plays, and we may here recall that 
Clearchus (= Ath. 12. 516) mentioned Midas and his ears in the same context as 
Omphale. We know of two comedies and two satyr plays titled Omphale, but 
all, except perhaps the one by Achaeus, are too late to be the original source 
of Midas’s ass’s ears.43 The first play of Achaeus of Eretria (484–401 b.c.) was 
produced between 447 and 444, but we do not know the specific date of his 
satyr play Omphale. He was, however, quoted three times by Aristophanes and, 
although it may not be of any significance, Aristophanes is the earliest extant 
author who refers to the ears of Midas.44 We may further note that the play 
Omphale was also the theme of coins from Phocaea. However, these date to a 
later period than those of Midas.45
Ovid does not mention Omphale in connection with Midas, but he does 
mention her husband the mountain god Tmolus, who acted as the judge of 
the musical competition between Apollo and Pan/Marsyas.46 Omphale is also

Both Cratinus the Younger and Antiphanes wrote comedies named Omphale, both dated 
to the fourth century b.c. (frgs. 4–5 pcg iv; frgs. 174–176 pcg ii). Ion of Chios wrote a satyr 
play titled Omphale, but it was staged in 422 b.c., which is likewise too late for the initial 
source of Midas’s ears (Bodenstedt, Elektronmünzen, 81).

63
The King Has Ass’s Ears! The Myth of Midas’s Ears
treated in the satyr play Syleus by Euripides, the performance of which may be 
dated close to 438 b.c.47
The extant remains of satyr plays are very limited, with only the play Cyclops 
by Euripides being preserved in its entirety. This meager situation of preserved 
satyr plays makes it difficult to evaluate possible sources. While there are sev-
eral satyr plays mentioning Phrygians, we do not know whether Midas was 
featured in any of them. Sophocles, for example, wrote Côphoi, dated between 
467 and 456, in which the Phrygian Dactyls from Ida are mentioned.48 We may 
here note that masks of Dactyls were depicted on coins issued in 400 and 388 
b.c. from Mytilene, which had a monetary pact with Phocaea, and likewise is-
sued coins with motifs from various stage perfomances.49
The only extant fragment of a satyr play where Midas is mentioned is the 
Hellenistic play Lityerses by Sositheus (308–246 b.c.). A preserved fragment, 
probably of the prologue,50 mentions Midas with ass’s ears as being the for-
mer king of Celaenae and the father of the bastard Lityerses. The same theme 
may have been treated by Euripides in his satyr play Theristae, but as it was 
performed in 431 b.c., it is too late to be the original source of Midas’s ears.51
Although one cannot now pinpoint any specific play as the original source, 
both the iconographical and literary evidence contain clear indications that 
they are based on a visual source, such as a stage performance. As a last aspect 
we may consider a possible geographical location of the unknown play. In the 
preserved fragment of Lityerses, Midas appears as king of Celaenae, which was 
the capital of Greater Phrygia during the Persian/Classical period. The Persian 
satrap of Greater Phrygia resided in Celaenae, and it was also here that Xerxes 
built his fortified palace after he had lost the famous battle against the Greeks 
at Salamis in 480 b.c.52 The Greco-Persian wars of the fifth century ended with 
the Peace of Callias established around 449 b.c., during the period of Artax-
erxes i.
Celaenae is where the musical competition between Apollo and Marsyas 
took place in which Midas, according to some sources, acted as a judge and re-
ceived the ass’s ears as a punishment. Marsyas was also a satyr and bore many

ing that the two works are close in date.

resemblances to Silenus. In addition, at least according to Alexander Polyhis-
tor, the so-called Midas’s spring was located at Celaenae.53 On the condition 
that the original medium was a stage performance, then it is possible that 
the events of the “play” were thought to be located in a specific Persian royal 
milieu. Celaenae is an attractive candidate for such a location for several rea-
sons. To begin with, Celaenae figures in the stories of Midas, as well as being 
an ­important city during the Achaemenian period, where the palace of Xerxes 
was located. To situate the story at Xerxes’s palace in Celaenae would then be 
an indirect reference to the Greek victory over Xerxes and the Persians.
	
Why the Ears of an Ass Were Chosen to Illustrate the King’s Ears
There may not be a single reason why ears of an ass were chosen to illustrate 
the King’s Ears, but rather a combination of reasons. Here we may only suggest 
plausible explanations. Of importance is the medium in which the ears were 
originally portrayed. As suggested above, it is likely that they were intended 
for some kind of stage performance. An ass is an animal with very distinctive 
ears, and of course the ears had to be accentuated on stage so that the audi-
ence would clearly notice them. Therefore the long ears of an ass are a suitable 
choice. It was further considered that the ass had exceptionally keen hearing,54 
which would have been a suitable characteristic of an informant. If the inten-
tion was to make fun of the Persian king (e.g. in a comedy), the ears of an ass 
must have been the perfect choice, as the ass was also a mocked and ridiculed 
animal in Greece. If, on the other hand, the original source was a satyr play, 
then the ass was also a suitable choice because it was connected with satyrs.
One further aspect should be commented upon, namely a suggested con-
nection between the donkey as a royal sign and symbol of Bronze Age Anatolia 
and the ears of Midas.55 A Luwian hieroglyph (# 101) interpreted as the head 
of a donkey or mule was used in Anatolian onomastics, as part of the name 
Tarkasnawa, who was King of Mira during the Late Bronze Age.56 Vassileva has

The King Has Ass’s Ears! The Myth of Midas’s Ears
demonstrated that the donkey was regarded as a royal animal throughout the 
Near East, but whether this was known in Greece during the Classical period 
is uncertain. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the donkey was 
understood to be a royal symbol, contributing to the choice of ass’s ears as suit-
able for the depiction of the King’s Ears.

The Project to Reconstruct the Early Bronze Age 
Hattıan Royal Tombs of Alaca Höyük
Aykut Çınaroğlu
When I received an invitation to write an essay for the Festschrift being 
­prepared for Dr. Oscar White Muscarella, now retired from the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art, I was delighted. Oscar Muscarella is an exceptional scientist 
with regards to the ethics of archaeology. Muscarella chose the subject for his 
doctoral dissertation from Anatolia. He told me many times how thrilled he 
was, as a graduate student, when he saw the fibulae in the tomb chamber of 
Gordion’s Great Tumulus when it was opened in 1957. Muscarella is widely 
known in the world of archaeology for his honesty; this honesty led to his 
­dismissal from the museum where he worked—but he was reinstated through 
a court order. Turkish archaeologists will never forget his collaboration with 
Özgen Acar in their efforts to bring back the “Karun Treasure”—the Lydian 
Hoard—to our country.
Muscarella visited the Alaca Höyük excavations several times and stayed 
in our excavation house, sharing his ideas with the team. On one of those 
visits he expressed his opinion that it was neither scientifically nor visually 
­advantageous for the Royal (Kings’) Tombs of the Early Bronze Age to have 
been artificially reconstructed as pits enclosed by four walls and nothing more. 
I agreed with him on that matter and took his opinion into account during the 
preparations for and realization of the Project to Reconstruct the Early Bronze 
Age Hattian Royal Tombs of Alaca Höyük.
Alaca Höyük, which has been well known to scientists and tourists since 
the first half of the 19th century, was first excavated by Theodor Macridy 
­during the last years of the Ottoman Empire.1 Prior to Macridy’s excavations, 
non-­scientific digging had occurred at Alaca Höyük, and the Sphinx Gate 
and ­orthostats were right out in the open, just waiting to be taken away. An 
­account of Turkish villagers chasing away a stranger who wanted to steal the 
­reliefs is unforgettable.2 Their act recalls the stance of Oscar Muscarella, who 
has condemned the plunder of ancient sites. In the 19th century Alaca Höyük

was known to the public for its monumental Sphinx Gate and adjacent carved 
orthostats. Macridy worked for approximately 15 days in 1907 in the area of the 
gate; from that effort came the first true scientific publication on the archaeo-
logical remains at Alaca Höyük.
During the final years of the Ottoman period, museology and archaeol-
ogy grew in importance through the devoted efforts of Osman Hamdi Bey, 
­considered the founder of Turkish museology. With the establishment of the  
Turkish Republic, these cultural activities accelerated. The program of the 
first cabinet of the Republic, which took office on May 9, 1920, included  
the following mandate: “To get experts to write literary and sociological 
books—books that will arouse ‘national spirit’—and to enroll and protect 
national ­ancient relics….”3 During the war of liberation when enemy forces 
amassed near ­Gordion, the Turkish government was planning to move from 
Ankara to ­Kayseri. At that time, a commission working for the Directory of 
Ancient ­Relics, founded by Atatürk within the Ministry of Education, was in-
volved in identifying the cultural property of Ankara and its environs.
This concern for Turkish culture continued during the period of Atatürk, 
and between 1923 and 1938, 25 new museums were founded and some excava-
tions were begun. Aerial photographs of archaeological sites were taken from 
private airplanes between 1933 and 1936. Atatürk decided to begin his national 
archaeological program with a few trial excavations. The sites of Etiyokuşu 
and then Ahlatlıbel in the region of Ankara were excavated under the direc-
tion of an anthropologist and a Hungarologist, since there were no trained 
­archaeologists in Turkey at that time. Concurrently Atatürk declared his 
­support for foreign excavations at every opportunity; with his intervention, the 
Troy ­excavations were started up again. In addition, Atatürk gave his ­support 
to the Institute of Asian and Hittite Studies in France.
In 1931–1932, Atatürk established the Turkish Historical Society and Turkish 
Language Society. In support of those two scientific associations, two national 
banks, Etibank and Sumerbank, were released to their service. Correspond-
ingly the first institution of higher education was founded in 1935 to educate 
future researchers and scientists for those associations. This was the Faculty of 
Language, History, and Geography, which was opened on January 9, 1936, with 
the first lecture given by Afet İnan, Atatürk’s adopted daughter. Her lecture was 
devoted entirely to archaeology.4
The library of Atatürk contained more than 2,900 books, now preserved 
­under the auspices of Atatürk’s Mausoleum. Atatürk read those books,

­underlining passages he considered important; his studies led to his interest 
in the site of Alaca Höyük, which he had not seen before initiating excavations 
there. At the founding of the Turkish Republic, the government inherited the 
debts of the Ottoman Empire in addition to coping with the expense of the 
War of Liberation, which created a substantial shortage of financial resources. 
Nonetheless, Atatürk took on the responsibility of funding the “first national 
excavation,” contributing 3,000 liras from his personal savings, which he trans-
ferred to Afet İnan so that the Alaca Höyük excavations could begin.
Atatürk named Remzi Oğuz Arık, who had just returned from France, to 
head the excavations at Alaca Höyük. Work commenced under Arık, one 
of the first archaeologists of the Republic, on August 22, 1935. In the 1930s, 
the ­village of Höyük covered the ruins; excavations were therefore begun in 
the open space of the village square. This led to the discovery of some impor-
tant ­archaeological material quite soon. Within the first 15 days of excavation, 
­evidence of Early Bronze Age burials was uncovered, and, during the first year, 
three Royal Tombs were excavated. With this discovery, antiquities equal in 
value and ­historical importance to those from the Troy “Treasures” and the 
Royal Cemetery of Ur in Mesopotamia had been unearthed in central Anatolia.
In 1936, Hamit Zübeyr Koşay discovered three more Royal Tombs after ­being 
appointed as director of excavations. Between 1937 and 1939, seven ­additional 
tombs were found, bringing the total number of Early Bronze Age Royal Tombs 
discovered at Alaca Höyük to 13.5 However, it should be noted that some 
­researchers believe that close analysis of the excavation reports indicates 
that the total number of the Royal Tombs found at the site may actually be 14 
(Figure 3.1).
When the splendor of the Alaca Höyük finds had made the site the top 
­priority in Anatolian archaeology, Atatürk ordered that the village of Höyük be 
moved to the plain. With the discovery of so many fabulous objects at Alaca 
Höyük, Atatürk decided to visit, planning a trip, passing through Yerköy, on his 
private train. But before he could do so, it was learned that he had a fatal liver 
condition, and his doctors forbade him to travel. Despite persistent reports to 
the contrary, it is clear that Atatürk did not visit Alaca Höyük—not even the 
town of Çorum.
Formerly known to the world from its monumental Sphinx Gate and carved 
stone orthostats, Alaca Höyük now gained a reputation for the rich finds from 
the Royal Tombs, notably the so-called “Pseudo-Hittite Sun Disks.” Because 
the standards were called “Hittite Sun Disks” after their discovery, they are still 
­often referred to by that term today. In the light of the excavations of the 1930s,

Alaca Höyük came to be seen as both a splendid Anatolian city of the Early 
Bronze Age (ca. 3000–2000 b.c.) and an important sacred settlement of the 
Hittite period (ca. 2000–1100 b.c.).
However, until a new program of excavation at Alaca Höyük began in 1997, 
visitors to the site, whether scientists or tourists, could see very little evidence 
of its early history. The Sphinx Gate and orthostats dating to the Hittite period 
were still on view; in addition, a “Temple-Palace” could be accessed through 
the gate, and its hidden tunnel could be toured. But, despite the importance of 
the Pre-Hittite (Hattian) city and Royal Tombs, visitors had to travel to Ankara 
to see the finds in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in order to get an 
­impression of the Early Bronze Age culture of the site (Figure 3.2). Mahmut 
Akok, who became head of excavations after the death of Hamit Zübeyr Koşay, 
had constructed replicas of six of the Royal Tombs (Plate 3.1), but, in keep-
ing with the thinking of the times, these consisted of empty rectangular pits

­bordered by four walls. Those artificial graves were not able to express the 
­richness and technical expertise of the Royal Tombs and their contents; in 
­addition, over time, the reconstructed graves had deteriorated. From 1983 to 
1997 no ­fieldwork of significance had occurred at the site.
In 1997, our commission started excavations at Alaca Höyük again; main-
tenance and repair of the architectural remains at the site are now done 
­carefully and regularly. Beyond this maintenance, we embarked upon a plan 
to ­reconstruct six Royal Tombs, refurbishing the empty artificial graves so as to 
more effectively evoke the appearance of the originals. The idea was broached 
to Atilla Koç, former minister of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, when he 
visited the site. The minister expressed an interest in the idea and gave ­orders 
for a plan to be drawn up for the Project to Reconstruct the Early Bronze 
Age Hattian Royal Tombs of Alaca Höyük. The project was ­subsequently

­approved by the Ankara Regional Board of Protection of Cultural and Natural  
Assets.
The areas to the south and southwest of the city mound and the parcels 
around the reconstructed Alaca Höyük Hittite Dam, with ancient canals from 
the Hittite period, were not included within the limits of the archaeological 
site (Plate 3.2).6 The Alaca Höyük (Göl Pınar) Hittite Dam, thought to have 
been built during the reign of Hattušili iii (ca. 1267–1237 b.c.), was opened, 
cleaned, and began to function again. The reconstructed dam, now over 3,250 
years old, became a new source of water for the farms of the villagers of Alaca 
Höyük. Today in Anatolia, as during the Hittite period, it is not possible to 
farm without such a water source, a fact known to the Hittites in the second 
millennium b.c.
Two Ministers of Culture and Tourism visited Alaca Höyük and were closely 
involved in the reconstruction project. Atilla Koç had the plan prepared and 
approved, and helped bring attention to the Hittite Dam restoration. Ertuğrul 
Günay, who took office after Atilla Koç, ensured the realization of the project. 
Our commission would like to thank both ministers again. The last stage of 
the project, the covering of the tombs with tempered glass, was undertaken 
with the sponsorship of the Governorship of Çorum. For this, we express our 
gratitude to the governor, Nurullah Çakır, who has given his support to the 
­museums, archaeological sites, and excavations of the area, and who made 
possible the “Hittite Walking and Cycling Tracks.”
Our work began with the removal of the old artificial tombs on the proj-
ect field, followed by excavation of the area down to the main soil level. 
­During this process, the excavations of 2009 turned up many Early Bronze 
Age ­artifacts (Plate 3.3). Large rocks weighing two tons or more were brought 
from the ­surrounding area and placed on the natural ground; small rocks were 
strewn over the large ones, and spaces between them were filled with rock 
chippings. ­After creating this solid base level, exact replicas of six Early Bronze 
Age ­Hattian Royal Tombs were constructed taking the topography into con-
sideration (Plate 3.4). All the reconstructed tombs are rectangular in shape, 
with depths varying between ca. 80 cm and 1 m, lengths between 4 m and 8 m, 
and widths between 2 m and 5 m (Plate 3.5). The original stone walls were 
30–40 centimeters thick, and wooden beams had been laid over the tombs 
(Plates 3.6–3.8). When the tombs were first excavated, they were in poor condi-
tion, but the new reconstructions give a good idea of their original appearance. 
Four of the tombs had contained burials of women, and five were burials of

men. For the remaining four tombs there is no exact information with regard 
to the sex of the occupant. Twelve groups of grave goods have been identified 
within the Royal Tombs.
After the reconstructed tombs were finished, the appearance of the field 
was harmonized with that of the city mound by adding back in some of the 
excavated soil. Replicas of the artifacts found in the Royal Tombs were placed 
in the reconstructed tombs (Plate  3.9); these are close copies of the origi-
nals, which can be seen in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara. In 
­addition, skeletons were included in the reconstructed tombs, laid out in the 
­hocker ­position (Plate 3.6). These were provided by Prof. Dr. Berna ­Alpagut 
from ­Ankara University, Faculty of Languages, History and Geography; we 
are ­grateful to her for this contribution. A site museum for the project has 
been built by our official sponsor Yüksel İnşaat (Yüksel Construction) at the 
entrance to the old museum building in the garden of the excavation house 
(Plate 3.10); two of the rooms of this museum are used as laboratory facili-
ties. The site ­museum houses additional replicas of the original burial goods, 
­displaying for the visitor the high technical level that the arts in Anatolia had 
reached during the Early Bronze Age.
After constructing the tombs and covering the field with soil from the exca-
vation, we then considered the issue of a walkway for visitors, as we thought 
they might be uncomfortable walking on the soil due to dust in summer and 
mud on rainy days. With the advice of the governor, a walking track was made 
of natural stones from the area. After a field examination by the Board of Pro-
tection, however, it was decided to remove the track and replace it with key-
stones. The reconstructed tombs were covered with tempered glass in 2010, 
and all stages of the project are now completed. The Project to Reconstruct the 
Early Bronze Age Hattian Royal Tombs of Alaca Höyük has moved us one step 
closer to reclaiming the site’s identity (Plate 3.11). We can now better imagine 
the high level of the arts and culture of the Hattians and envision their burial 
customs. And we can ponder our ties to these early Anatolian peoples, whose 
language was Asiatic and agglutinative.

The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny: Repatriation 
and the Statute of Limitations
Lawrence M. Kaye
In the international market, art theft has become a multibillion-dollar illicit 
enterprise,1 and the United States is one of the largest consumers of the looted 
property.2 While there have been attempts at the international level to regulate 
the illicit trade in cultural property, including the 1970 “unesco Convention”3 
and the 1995 “unidroit Convention,”4 the black market for cultural artifacts 
continues to thrive.5
Nations such as Turkey, Egypt, Italy, and Greece, among others, fight ­fiercely 
to preserve their cultural artifacts because of their aesthetic, educational, and 
historical value. These objects, when viewed in their appropriate context, 
­unlock information about past times and render the objects and information 
about them accessible to the public. When the objects are ripped from archae-
ological sites in acts of wanton destruction, however, the unique insight into 
ancient civilizations that otherwise could have been gleaned from the care-
ful excavation and exploration of these objects in the context of their original 
­locations is lost forever.
Adding to the problem, dealers, collectors, and museums have traditionally 
been reluctant to ask probing questions, if any at all, about the provenance of 
an object, lest any issues impede their acquisition plans. In recent years, how-
ever, a growing number of looted cultural objects have been repatriated to their 
countries of origin amid increasing worldwide efforts to challenge “­business as 
usual” in the art world, where the policy of “don’t ask, don’t tell” had been the

order of the day. Oscar White Muscarella, an outspoken and passionate critic 
of those who participate in and facilitate the illicit antiquities trade, has long 
been at the forefront of this battle.
Oscar, who spent over forty years at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art before his recent retirement, 
has ­admitted that “from 1964 to 1970, [he] thought it was normal to buy 
antiquities.”6 But his viewpoint changed after attending lectures by renowned 
archaeologists Clemency Coggins and Ezat Negahban.7 As he noted, “three 
­lectures turned me around. And in 1971, I wrote … that I would not participate 
in the acquisition of antiquities anymore and I wrote the administration [of 
the Met] about this. Not only because I converted, but it became so obvious 
after the early 1970’s, that no one—no archaeologist, no museum curator—
could be unaware of what I’m saying.”8
According to Oscar, ancient objects should stay underground “until [they 
are] excavated scientifically where people spend years on a site and docu-
ment every single object found and its context. That’s how we know about our 
­ancient history.”9 As a trained archaeologist who has excavated in the Near 
East for many years,10 Oscar witnessed firsthand the widespread destruction 
of unexcavated archaeological sites. As he describes it, “in Turkey, in Iran, 
Greece, wherever you go, you see holes in the ground. Dynamite. Battering 
poles. ­Bulldozers. All the objects are removed, sent to the various dealers who 
­smuggle them out of the country of origin, all to be sold to … museums.”11 ­Oscar 
has vigilantly fought to change museum practices that condone or facilitate 
the acquisition of antiquities and other cultural properties of questionable 
provenance, and he has repeatedly spoken out against the acquisition policies 
of the Met—the very museum where he has spent most of his career.12 Indeed, 
he has described himself as a thorn in the Met’s side.13
Notably, in the early 1970’s, Oscar advocated against the acquisition of the 
Euphronios krater by the Metropolitan Museum—an acquisition that turned 
into a three-decades-long dispute that was not resolved until 2006 (Plate 1.5). 
From the start, Oscar expressed concern that the krater had been illegally

The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny
­excavated in Italy.14 And, as far back as 1973, Oscar was ­quoted in The New 
York Times regarding his belief that “the museum trustees had not adequately 
questioned the provenance of the vase. ‘They have abdicated ­responsibility,’ 
he said. ‘They should have checked out every possible origin of the vase before 
it was purchased.’”15 Oscar also later spoke out in favor of the Met’s repatria-
tion of the fabled “Lydian Hoard,” long held by the Museum, to the Republic of 
­Turkey.16 When Turkey’s claim to the Hoard, asserted in 1986, was rejected by 
the Museum, Turkey filed suit in 1987; six years of bitter and expensive litiga-
tion ensued before the parties finally reached an out-of-court agreement in 
1993 that saw the historic return of the Hoard to Turkey.17
The Lydian Hoard case leads us back to one day in 1966, when a curator at 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art was looking at a group of 23 objects that the 
Museum was about to acquire.18 He could hardly contain his excitement. As 
he later recalled:
It was quite startling … The startling part of it was that you had so much 
beauty in so small a space all at once, that you [saw] such good condition, 
too, because they were in excellent condition … [They were] the most 
stupendous silver objects.19
As it turned out, those 23 rare artifacts were part of the so-called ­Lydian Hoard—
which consisted of 363 remarkable objects created by master craftsmen in the 
6th century b.c.—during the era of the legendary King Croesus of Lydia.20 The 
magnificent collection, which was acquired by the Museum in three ­separate 
principal purchases between 1966 and 1970, contained ­ceremonial silver and 
bronze vessels (Plate 32.11), ­incense burners, ­cosmetic accoutrements, frag-
ments of wall paintings, marble ­sphinxes, and jewelry (Plates 1.7 and 42.4)—
some ­pieces as small as one inch, but exquisitely ­crafted—along with ancient 
jewelry-making ­equipment.21 ­Indeed, the artisanship of some of the objects

could only be ­appreciated through a magnifying glass, thus demonstrating the 
immense skills of the ancient craftsmen who created them 2,500 years earlier. 
The importance of these objects from an historical and archaeological per-
spective cannot be overstated.
According to his later testimony in the legal action brought against the 
­Museum by the Republic of Turkey, the curator never asked the Madison 
­Avenue dealer who showed him the precious objects how the dealer had 
­acquired them.22 But the evidence developed in the case left little doubt that 
he and other officials of the Museum knew full well about the objects’ long 
journey to the Met from previously unexcavated burial mounds, or tumuli, in 
the Uşak region of Turkey in western Anatolia.23 For thousands of years, they 
had rested undisturbed in the Uşak tombs. These were the graves of ancient 
royalty and nobility, who had been buried with their precious belongings. The 
tombs had not yet been excavated or even discovered by archaeologists, and 
they remained hidden from modern view.
In the mid-1960’s, however, local villagers discovered the tombs and began 
pillaging them.24 Shortly after the thefts, disputes arose among the thieves as 
to how to divide the booty, betrayals ensued, and the police closed in on the 
homes of the key people involved.25 Some pieces were recovered, but most 
quickly found their way out of Turkey, and then to dealers, and finally to the 
Met.26 After their arrests, the thieves told the story of how they had been able 
to identify the tombs, the destructive means they employed to enter, and their 
wonder and awe upon entering the ancient burial chambers. According to one 
of the robbers:
I grew suspicious about this area at İkiztepe … The earth on these hills 
was somewhat different … I estimated that there was buried treasure 
there … Our equipment consisted of mattocks, shovels, sledge ­hammers 
and ­pokers. We dug in turns for nine or ten days … On the tenth day we 
reached the stones [of the tomb] … We had tried to break the stones 
with sledge hammers and pokers but were not successful … I ­exploded 
[the main ­entrance of the tomb] using black powder … First I entered 
the place. My friends held my hand and dropped me down the hole.

The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny
I searched the ­interior using a flashlight. There was a [stone] bed at the 
center of the tomb … It was obvious to me that not even an ant had walked 
around before me, not a single living creature had entered there before I 
did. There were ornamental goods of gold and silver on and around the 
bed … [I] gave [the objects] one by one to the people above. The total 
number of the goods was 125.27
As it turned out, the thieves were eventually able to identify several of the 
­objects at the Met as having been looted from these ancient tombs.28 Remark-
ably, upon the acquisition of this startling hoard of objects, which, according to 
its own documents, the Met considered to be among its greatest acquisitions,29 
the Museum did not announce the purchase at the time or even set up a major 
exhibition.30 Instead, it quietly placed the objects in the Museum’s basement 
coffers.31
Although rumors that the treasure was in the Met began to circulate in the 
early 1970’s, inquiries by Turkish officials were essentially ignored.32 At the 
time, Oscar wrote a memorandum that was circulated within the Museum to 
“appeal against the destruction of burial mounds and against the purchase and 
display of objects lacking a scientific and secure provenance … He also let it be 
known that a Turkish journalist had expressed to him an interest in inspecting 
the objects in the museum’s basement.”33 In 1984, a large number of the pieces 
were put on “permanent exhibition” by the Museum—disingenuously labeled 
as the East Greek Treasure34—and became the subject of articles by investiga-
tive journalists Özgen Acar and Melik Kaylan.35 As a result, the Republic was 
finally able to determine that the objects at the Met were indeed those that 
had been pillaged from the Uşak tombs some 20 years earlier, and the Republic 
asserted a claim against the Met for the return of the objects.36
Initially, Turkey sought to resolve the matter peacefully, but the Museum 
flatly rejected its overtures. The resulting litigation was largely spent ­defending

an application by the Museum asking the court to dismiss the case, with-
out reaching the merits of Turkey’s claim, on the ground of the statute of 
­limitations—i.e., the Museum argued that the Republic had waited too long 
to bring its claim. After three years of litigation on this single issue alone, the 
­application was denied, and Turkey was able to begin to obtain information 
from the Museum about its knowledge of the objects’ provenance and its con-
duct in acquiring them. Undoubtedly, many factors influenced the Museum’s 
decision in 1993 to return the Lydian Hoard. But it is less likely that the Museum 
finally saw the light and did the right thing, and more probable that it did not 
want to hear the upcoming testimony of present and former Museum officials 
as to what the Museum knew and when it knew it. In Oscar’s own words, the 
settlement between the Met and Turkey “occurred only because if the Turkish 
legal suit against the Met had gone to public trial, the evidence from internal 
Met documents would have embarrassed them. These documents manifestly 
demonstrate that from day one … [the Met] knew that the objects derived 
from … plundered and destroyed [tombs] in western Turkey.”37
The Lydian Hoard case was not only fascinating; it was a microcosm of the 
many legal, policy, and moral issues that surround almost any discussion in 
the continuing debate about who really owns cultural property dating from 
­antiquity. It is sometimes said that the job of an attorney is relatively straight-
forward—after all, attorneys only have to worry about the law, while others 
can focus on the more nebulous concepts of policy and morality. But in this 
field the applicable legal principles have long been far from clear, and ­perhaps 
that is why many of the seminal legal cases have lasted ten years or more. 
Some ­basic legal principles, however, have now been established, at least in 
the ­United States, and they serve as the underpinning of virtually every case 
brought in the u.s. to recover stolen cultural property.
Underlying any claim for the recovery of antiquities in the United States is a 
single, fundamental rule: no one, not even a good-faith purchaser, can obtain 
good title to stolen property. This simple rule is accepted and applied as a basic 
tenet of property law throughout the fifty states. Thus, theoretically, the owner 
of stolen property always has the right to reclaim that property from anyone, 
unless barred by the statute of limitations or other technical defenses. But the 
foreign government claimant, in a case brought in a u.s. court, must first estab-
lish that it owns the property in question. In antiquities cases, while this may 
seem relatively routine, it is not, and it almost always poses difficult hurdles for 
the foreign claimant.

The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny
Initially, there is the question of identity: that is, showing that the objects in 
the defendant’s hands are, in fact, the items that were stolen. Again, this seems 
simple enough, and it should be, at least where one is dealing with a clearly 
identifiable object, particularly one stolen from a documented or catalogued 
public or private collection. The problem of identity is, however, more likely to 
arise where claims are made, as in the Lydian Hoard case, to objects pillaged 
from unexcavated archaeological or sacred sites—in other words, ­artifacts that 
have been removed from the country of origin before archaeologists or ­museum 
officials have even been able to view, much less ­inventory or ­document, the 
objects. As I noted earlier, in the Lydian Hoard case the thieves’ testimony was 
critical in establishing the identity of the objects. So, too, was the fact that the 
artifacts remaining in the tombs after the thefts were so ­similar to the objects 
in the Met’s possession, including fragments of wall ­panels that fit precisely 
into the gaps left by the thieves on the tomb walls.38 The Met’s own documents 
were critical as well. They made clear that the Met knew of the ­objects’ true 
provenance at the time of their acquisition.39 Among the most telling of these 
documents were the minutes of the Met’s Acquisitions Committee meeting of 
November 7, 1968, approving the second of the Met’s three ­principal ­purchases. 
These minutes expressly noted that the ­objects ­being acquired were said to 
come from the same part of central Anatolia as those acquired earlier.40 This, 
of course, confirmed that the Met knew that these ­objects had recently been 
unearthed from Turkey.
Even if a foreign government plaintiff can establish identity, however, that 
is still only one of the hurdles it must overcome to establish its claim. A foreign 
government must also show that it legally owns the antiquities in question, not 
always an easy task. In the case of previously undiscovered antiquities stolen 
from under the ground, the key to establishing the foreign government’s own-
ership is to show that there is an applicable law that vests ownership of such 
antiquities in the State. These are known generally as “patrimony laws.” Virtu-
ally all countries with huge stores of cultural property still undiscovered and 
buried underground have enacted such laws, mostly in the 20th century, which 
declare that anything found in or under the ground, if not yet discovered, is 
owned by the government. Thus, one major requirement in cases brought by 
foreign governments to recover cultural property is to establish that, at the 
time the objects were discovered in and removed from its territory, there was a

86
law in place that unambiguously vested in the State ownership rights or some 
other proprietary interest in the objects.
Although many museums, collectors, and galleries in the United States 
fought in the courts for years against the applicability of these patrimony laws 
to establish foreign ownership, they lost that fight. Rather, our courts have 
­consistently held that recovery claims arising under national laws that vest 
ownership of previously undiscovered antiquities in the foreign State will be 
honored, just as private ownership rights will be.41 Our courts will, consistent 
with international norms, recognize a sovereign nation’s laws governing inter-
ests in property found within its territory.
But, as a counterpoint, there are also defenses that can and will be asserted 
against a sovereign claimant seeking the return of looted cultural property. As 
in the Lydian Hoard case, the most commonly asserted defense is the statute 
of limitations. In the simplest terms, statutes of limitations are laws that set a 
maximum time period for civil claims to be brought, and these time ­periods 
begin to run on the date when the claim came into being. Usually, this is when 
the injury occurred, i.e., in cultural property cases, when the object was stolen 
or when another person acquired the stolen object from the thief or someone 
who received it from the thief. But this is not always the case. The purposes 
of statutes of limitations are multifold: first, they encourage claimants to dili-
gently investigate and prosecute their claims in a timely manner; second, they 
promote the resolution of claims while evidence is still available and reliable; 
and finally, they provide predictability in legal and commercial affairs.42 While 
statutes of limitations are meant to ensure judicial fairness, they can be a 
­significant legal hurdle for foreign claimants seeking to recover stolen cultural 
property, and they vary considerably depending on the jurisdiction in which 
the claim is brought.
The various statute of limitations rules that different u.s. states apply 
­include the “demand and refusal” rule, the discovery rule, and specific legis-
lation, like that of California, that sets forth limitation periods that apply to 
stolen artifacts or artwork.43 In spite of this variety, however, the result will

Under California’s statute of limitations, a plaintiff has six years to bring a claim against 
a museum, gallery, auctioneer or dealer for the recovery of works of fine art that were 
unlawfully taken or stolen. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 338(c)(3)(A) (2011). The statute of limita-
tions does not begin to run until “actual discovery by the claimant” of the identity and 
whereabouts of the work and the “[i]nformation or facts … sufficient to indicate that the 
claimant has a claim for a possessory interest in the work of fine art.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc.

The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny
often be the same, because courts will generally balance the equities under 
these different rules in similar ways. Even so, a greater understanding of some 
of these rules is apt.
Most states apply a discovery rule, which means that the clock starts to run 
when the plaintiff either discovered or reasonably could have discovered his 
or her claim to the property if he or she were reasonably diligent. Courts have 
struggled to define what investigative actions an original owner must take to 
meet the due diligence standard. Rather than enumerating the steps an owner 
must follow, courts have found that any determination of due diligence must 
depend on the specific facts of each case, with special consideration of the 
­nature and value of the property, the manner in which it was stolen, and 
whether it was publicly displayed or published after its theft.44
By contrast, New York applies a demand and refusal rule. As against a 
good-faith purchaser, the claim accrues and the statute of limitations begins 
to run only when a demand by the true owner for the return of the property 
has been refused. According to the New York rule, a plaintiff has three years 
from the date of refusal to initiate a lawsuit to recover stolen property.45 The 
demand and refusal rule establishes a presumption in favor of the interests of 
the true owner, the victim of the theft, over those of the bona fide purchaser. 
As ­explained by New York’s highest court, “[T]he better rule gives the owner 
relatively greater protection and places the burden of investigating the prov-
enance of a work of art on the potential purchaser.”46 In this way, the demand 
and refusal rule serves to deter the illicit trade in cultural property.47
Even in New York, with its favorable demand and refusal rule, timeliness 
defenses are more often than not the reason that claims fail. Take, for example, 
the recent case of Grosz v. Museum of Modern Art.48 In Grosz, the court essen-
tially held that a party can be deemed to have refused a demand by failing to 
return the property at some point after the demand was made, even when the 
parties were engaged in settlement negotiations and were conducting research 
§ 338(c)(3)(A)—(A)(ii). The statute also provides that a “party … may raise all equitable 
and legal affirmative defenses and doctrines, including, without limitation, laches and 
unclean hands.” Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 338(c)(5).

into the artwork’s provenance.49 As explained by the court, a “refusal need not 
use the specific word ‘refuse’ so long as [the refusal] clearly conveys an intent 
to interfere with the demander’s possession or use of his property.”50 More-
over, a refusal “need not be conveyed in words at all” as long as a defendant’s 
­actions are “inconsistent with the demander’s claim to ownership.”51 The court 
found that the Museum’s continued possession of the artworks, coupled with 
correspondence with the plaintiffs that indicated the Museum’s intent to 
­retain the works, constituted a refusal.52 Furthermore, the court rejected the 
­plaintiffs’ argument that the Museum’s use of temporizing language “somehow 
­tempered the museum’s clearly stated refusal to return the artworks,” stating 
that while the language was “almost certainly designed to entice the plaintiffs 
to continue negotiating,” this did not contradict the “clearly stated rejection 
of plaintiffs’ demand” that the paintings be returned to them as the rightful 
­owners.53 Since the plaintiffs’ claim was brought more than three years after 
their demand for the artwork was “refused,” the court held that the claim was 
barred by the statute of limitations.54
Even when a cause of action is timely under the statute of limitations, a claim 
may still be dismissed on the ground of laches. Laches occurs when the plaintiff 
unreasonably delays in pursuing a claim to the prejudice of the ­defendant. In 
Sanchez v. Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, the ­claimants and heirs of 
Pablo Isaias Sanchez sought to recover a collection of pre-Columbian artifacts 
that were allegedly stolen and sold to the University of Pennsylvania in 1920.55 
The court held that the claim was barred by laches ­because the claimants had 
only made “desultory efforts” to recover the collection, and those efforts were 
“not remotely enough to satisfy the requirements of a diligent search.”56 The 
court underscored that the claimants “never wrote any letters or placed any 
telephone calls to any museums, never hired any investigator, never consulted

conversion action.” No. 10-1261, 2011 wl 3855862 at *21 (d.d.c. 2011) (quoting Malewicz v.

any experts, never reported the theft, and never even conducted any research 
on where the collection might be found.”57 It should be noted, however, that the 
plaintiffs had visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art and several art galleries 
in an attempt to locate their property and had tried a number of times (albeit 
unsuccessfully) to enlist the help of attorneys to search for the collection in the 
years after the collection was allegedly stolen.58 Even so, the court found that 
“the prejudice to defendants in allowing such a suit to proceed more than 80 
years after the events in issue [was] real and substantial”: relevant documents 
were no longer available or in existence, and key individuals with knowledge of 
the University’s acquisition of the collection had died long ago.59
Likewise, in Bakalar v. Vavra, the district court held that the action was 
barred by laches because the claimants, as well as their ancestors, had ­sufficient 
knowledge of the circumstances regarding their claim to have ­taken action, but 
they inexcusably delayed in doing so, causing the defendant to be prejudiced 
by the loss of witnesses, documents, and memories of the relevant events.60 In 
Bakalar the claimants attempted to recover an Egon Schiele ­drawing that had 
been part of a collection of nearly 450 artworks owned by Fritz ­Grunbaum, 
a prominent Austrian Jewish art collector who was ­arrested and sent to a 
­concentration camp in 1938.61 Exactly what happened to ­Grunbaum’s art 
­collection from 1938 to 1952 remains unknown. But beginning in 1952, the 
artworks began resurfacing in Switzerland and, in 1956, the Schiele drawing 
was sold to a Swiss gallery.62 The drawing was eventually purchased by David 
Bakalar, a private art collector, in 1964.63 Interestingly, in its decision the court 
also found that Bakalar, as a non-merchant purchaser, had no obligation to 
research the painting’s provenance even though the work was in his posses-
sion for 40 years, so long as he originally purchased it in good faith.64 Had the 
possessor been a merchant, however, the court would clearly have imposed a 
duty to investigate the provenance prior to purchase, and therefore the laches 
defense would likely have failed.
In the context of looted antiquities, the issues surrounding statutes of limi-
tations, and also laches, are rendered more complex by the fact that cultural

objects are often discovered abroad long after the thefts have occurred. ­Objects 
are looted in the dead of night from unknown sites or unexcavated tombs, and 
it can be difficult, if not impossible, for sovereign governments of art-rich 
countries to determine when and where the objects were stolen because of 
the sheer volume of archaeological sites. Özgen Acar, the noted journalist and 
investigative reporter who played a key role in Turkey’s long battle to recover 
the Lydian Hoard and many other looted Turkish treasures, has stated, “Turkey 
has more ancient Roman towns than Italy and more antique Greek sites than 
Greece. It’s a smuggler’s dream.”65 Victimized countries like Turkey are doing 
their best to devote enough funds and security to adequately safeguard their 
archaeological sites, but as long as there is a market for illicit antiquities, there 
will be people who will figure out how to find them and smuggle them out of 
the country. There are tales of smugglers dynamiting entire ancient cities to 
reach the specific items they want to market, and stories of the mutilation of 
movable antiquities to make them more saleable.66 The potential for destruc-
tion and loss, not only of the objects themselves, but of essential archaeologi-
cal and historical data, is unfathomable. The difficulties that sovereign claim-
ants face are compounded when the dealers, museums, and collectors who 
acquire stolen cultural property argue that the countries have waited too long 
to assert their claim.
Moreover, not all statutes are as favorable to claimants as New York’s, and 
sovereign claimants elsewhere have not fared as well, seeing their claims 
thwarted by technical defenses based on the passage of time. In particular, in 
contrast to the demand and refusal rule, the laws in many European countries 
favor the rights of bona fide purchasers above those of the true owner.67 As a 
result, these laws are less likely to encourage buyers to properly research an 
object before acquiring it. This, in effect, contributes to the problem of illicit 
trafficking.
Under Italian law, for example, the sale of a stolen work to a good-faith 
­purchaser extinguishes the title of the original owner, and title becomes ­vested 
in the new owner, even if the seller does not have good title to convey.68 In 
the case of Stato francese v. Ministero per i beni culturali ed ambientali e De 
­Contessini, Il diritto di autore, the French government brought a civil claim in

The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny
Italy against the defendant De Contessini, who had unwittingly purchased two 
tapestries that had been stolen from a French state museum.69 The Tribunale 
di Roma held that under Italian law the good-faith purchaser gained good title 
and became the new owner at the time of purchase, even though the tapes-
tries had been stolen and were classified as “objects of artistic importance” and 
“­inalienable” under French law.70
But French law can be just as unforgiving to sovereign claimants who seek 
to recover stolen cultural property. Two centuries ago, Napoléon Bonaparte 
charged troops with confiscating cultural property from foreign nations, 
­including Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, and Spain, as part of a campaign 
to amass an impressive collection of art for France.71 From Belgium, French 
armies forcibly seized numerous Flemish masterpieces located in Belgian 
churches, museums, and homes.72 Today many of these stolen works remain 
in the galleries of French museums, including the Louvre.73 Though Belgium 
has made repeated public appeals for the recovery of its art, it has only done so 
outside the court system.74 Stated plainly, it would be very difficult for ­Belgium 
to reclaim its property in a French court of law because of the applicable 
­statute of limitations.75 In France, a plaintiff has three years from the date of 
the theft to bring a claim for the recovery of stolen property against the good-
faith purchaser.76 If the purchase was made in bad faith, however, the statutory 
­period is extended to 30 years.77 Therefore, even though the Flemish master-
pieces were forcefully taken from Belgium in bad faith, any potential claims 
have long expired, even under the longer limitations period.78

French law, which allows courts to exercise some leniency with the statute of limitations 
for stolen artwork in state and local public museums categorized as “classified chattels.” 
To date, however, no other party besides the French Minister of Culture and Communica-
tion has been able to take advantage of this potentially unlimited statute of limitations 
period. Furthermore, while France has returned stolen or illicit works located in French 
museums, the restitutions have all been to non-Western countries, including Laos and 
Egypt.

Despite these cases, progress is being made. In great part because of the 
­impact of the Lydian Hoard case, and the outcries of distinguished critics such 
as Oscar White Muscarella, a new spirit of cooperation has emerged ­between 
foreign claimants and u.s. museums that has led to the return of looted ­cultural 
objects in their collections without the need for protracted litigation. In 2006 
the Metropolitan Museum itself agreed to return 21 looted artifacts to Italy,79 
including the famous Morgantina Hoard, a group of 16 pieces of Hellenistic 
silver (dating from the 3rd century b.c.), as well as one of the Museum’s most 
prized possessions, the Euphronios krater, whose acquisition was vehemently 
opposed by Oscar when it was first acquired by the Museum’s former direc-
tor, Thomas Hoving, in 1972.80 In return, Italy agreed to lend objects of “equal 
beauty and historical and cultural significance” to the Museum.81
This was followed by an agreement by the Getty Museum in Los Angeles 
to return four objects to Greece. Three of them—a gold funerary wreath, an 
inscribed grave marker, and a marble torso dating from 400 b.c.—had been 
purchased by the Getty for $5.2 million in 1993.82 The fourth item, an archaic 
marble relief that depicts a warrior with spear, shield, and sword, had been 
purchased in 1955 by J. Paul Getty himself.83 In August 2006 the Getty returned 
the grave marker and the relief to Greece; then in March of the following year, 
it returned the funerary wreath and the marble torso.84
And also, in September 2006 the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston sent 13 
­pieces back to Italy.85 The Museum agreed that it will inform the Italian 
­Ministry of Culture of any future acquisitions, loans, or donations of works 
that could have an Italian origin.86 In 2007 the Getty agreed to return over 40 
objects from its antiquities collection to Italy, including the prized Aphrodite 
statue that had been purchased by the Museum in 1988 for $18 million.87 In 
2009 the Cleveland Museum of Art returned 14 ancient treasures that had been 
looted from Italy, pursuant to an agreement signed in November 2008 with the 
Italian Culture Minister that the objects would be returned in exchange for 
several long-term loans of 13 equally valuable artifacts for renewable 25-year

periods.88 Also, in 2009 France agreed to return painted wall fragments that 
were stolen from a Luxor tomb in Egypt that had been purchased by the ­Louvre 
in 2000 and 2003.89 In September 2011 the Getty Museum announced that it 
had reached a new agreement with the Greek Ministry of Culture to return 
two additional artifacts, fragments of a grave marker and a Greek inscription, 
which had been acquired by the Museum in the 1970s.90
Most recently, Turkey achieved a great victory for its cultural heritage 
when Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan himself carried the stolen 
­Weary ­Herakles statue fragment back from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts 
to ­Turkey.91 The marble fragment depicts the upper part of a statue of the 
­bearded hero ­Herakles leaning on his club, fatigued by his many labors.92 In 
1990 the top half of the statue was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum as part 
of a larger exhibition, “Glories of the Past.”93 While it was on exhibit, ­Özgen 
Acar and others noticed its similarities with the bottom half of a ­Herakles 
sculpture in the Antalya Archaeological Museum that had been ­excavated 
in Perge, Turkey, in 1980.94 Although the mfa’s curator at the time of the 
­acquisition, Cornelius Vermeule, dismissed the notion of the two halves being 
­connected, in 1992 the Museum nonetheless conducted a test to determine 
if the two halves were a match.95 Plaster casts of both original pieces were 
made and fitted together, demonstrating that the two halves fit together per-
fectly.96 ­Notwithstanding the ­successful test, the mfa still refused to return its 
piece to Turkey.97 In ­September 2011 the two parties finally signed a memo-
randum of ­understanding, and Turkey dropped all claims that the ­Museum 
engaged in illicit trade when it acquired the Herakles.98 Upon its return to

Turkey, the top half of the statue was promptly united with its bottom half 
and went on display in the Antalya Archaeological Museum to the elation of 
Turkish ­citizens and officials alike.99 Engin Özgen, the former Turkish Direc-
tor General of ­Monuments and ­Museums, who pressed the Lydian Hoard case 
and many other cultural heritage disputes, stated, “What makes me happy is 
that this happened without a legal battle. Negotiations brought this ending … 
This will show the world that the Turks … will fight for their past and their 
heritage.”100
These resolutions and others have been successful in large part because 
of the efforts of many individuals, all too numerous to name here. But 
­Oscar White Muscarella, in particular, deserves special consideration for the 
­attention that he has brought to the issue of illicit cultural property. He has 
been called an “antiquities whistleblower.”101 But Oscar is first and foremost 
a trailblazer who has led the way to significant changes in how museums 
­operate by speaking out against the acquisition of cultural objects with ques-
tionable provenance. In the case of Turkey, he has stated, “There are orders 
from ­museums all over the world for Turkish antiquities. The u.s., Germany, 
Britain, and Japan are the main destroyers of these precious historical time 
capsules. An antique ­object on a wooden stand in a foreign museum is forever 
out of context.”102 He has long opposed what he calls “bazaar archaeology,” 
the tendency of ­museums to acquire objects from local dealers and blindly 
accept their ­exaggerated claims of where the objects came from, because, as 
he has stated, this is historically meaningless, and corrupts our understanding 
of the past.103 His ­vocal ­condemnations of the plunder of ancient archaeo-
logical sites and the ­complicity of museums in acquiring illicit antiquities has 
sparked public ­debate and scrutiny of the legal and moral obligations of muse-
ums around the world. And in part because of this scrutiny, the International 
Council of Museums (“icom”) adopted a Code of Ethics (“Code”) in 1986 that 
was most recently revised in 2004.104
In relevant part, the Code seeks to provide a “minimum standard” of 
­exemplary practices for museums to follow. In particular, Section two of the

95
The Lydian Hoard and Its Progeny
Code deals directly with the acquisition of illicit material and expressly states 
that museums should not acquire any object “by purchase, gift, loan, bequest or 
exchange” unless valid title is obtained.105 Similarly, the Code further ­provides 
that “[e]very effort must be made before acquisition to ensure that … [the] 
object has not been illegally obtained in, or exported from its country of ­origin 
or any intermediate country in which it may have been owned legally.”106 If the 
museum has “reasonable cause to believe” that an object’s excavation “­involved 
unauthorized or unscientific fieldwork, or intentional destruction … of monu-
ments, archaeological or geological sites,” or involved “a failure to disclose the 
finds … to the proper legal or governmental authorities,” the Code explicitly 
states that a museum should not acquire that object.107
Though the icom Code is not binding or enforceable against museums, the 
Code articulates the position urged by many archaeologists, including Oscar, 
that the acquisition and exhibition of unprovenanced pieces condones the 
­illicit trade in cultural property, and that museums should not acquire such 
­objects without conducting the requisite research. Where there is more infor-
mation available on the object, such as the original context and provenance, 
legal advisors can better help museums ascertain whether they are buying 
an object that will likely be the subject of a claim from a victimized country. 
But where provenance information is unavailable or insufficient, the question 
­remains whether a museum should acquire the object.
The ongoing philosophical debate of whether antiquities can, and should be, 
acquired, even in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that they have 
been legally excavated or that their legal status is certain, will not be ­settled 
any time soon. But the icom Code is a significant step in the right direction. It 
encourages museums to conduct provenance research and take steps to insure 
that all objects acquired are properly and fully documented, with a complete 
description of all items, their provenance and sources, and the ­conditions of 
acceptance by the museum.108 If adopted by museums, the acquisition and 
collection policies urged by icom will go a long way to alleviate the problem 
of illicit trade in antiquities.
There are no easy answers, but more attention to these issues is needed. 
Smuggling and illegal transfers continue, and many illicit antiquities con-
tinue to populate some of our most important public and private collections.

As ­Oscar has stated, museums that acquire and display illegally excavated 
objects are “actively engaged in erasing this planet’s history.”109 Nevertheless, 
while there is still much that needs to be done, thanks to the fearless and unre-
lenting efforts of those like Oscar White Muscarella, who continue to fight the 
good fight, the future looks promising.

Labors Lost and Found in Tumulus mm at Gordion
Richard F. Liebhart
Who could have done this? There was a body, of course, and the room was 
completely sealed. It could have been the classic locked-room murder case, 
but there were problems, not least of which was the fact that there was neither 
door nor window in the room as found. The deceased was a man in his six-
ties with no signs of trauma besides his age. His skeletonized body had been 
clothed and lay on the remains of felt bedding on what was left of a cedar 
coffin, which had been shoved into the northwest corner of the room. Could 
murder be ruled out already? Still, this was certainly no accident. The room 
itself showed signs of premeditation by the perpetrators. Iron spikes had been 
driven into the east, south, and west walls for hanging bronze objects in rows, 
from ring-handled bowls to ladles to large trefoil-mouthed jugs. But the spikes 
had long since rusted through, and what they had once carried now lay on the

parently not particularly forthcoming with details as the work progressed. The topic of this 
particular paper came to me as I recalled one day in Ankara when Oscar and I were taking a 
long walk downhill from Kavaklıdere and uphill to the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations. 
As we strolled down Atatürk Bulvarı just past the intersection with İnönü Bulvarı, we were 
overtaken by a demonstration (for something or other) marching somewhat randomly down 
the street. Oscar stopped in his tracks, and I thought he might have actually come close to 
tears at the sight. He was, I discovered, a union man at heart, so it seemed fitting to write a 
somewhat speculative paper on the people who actually built Tumulus mm and its tomb 
chamber … those people who left almost no record behind, but the kind of people to whom 
we archaeologists owe so much.

now all scattered across the floor. It might not have been murder, but this was 
no accident. Who could have done this? Who, indeed?1
When Rodney Young excavated Tumulus mm (for “Midas Mound”) in 1957, 
he had many questions on his mind. Generally speaking, however, he already 
knew who built it: the Phrygians, who had arrived in Anatolia by the beginning 
of the Iron Age and had taken Gordion for their capital city over a hundred 
years before mm was built. For the actual excavation, Young had more direct 
and logistical questions to consider. As soon as he arrived at the site for work 
in 1950, Young began planning the excavation of the tumulus. The mound itself 
is still 53 m high and some 300 m in diameter after over two-and-a-half mil-
lennia of erosion (Plate 5.1). The typical excavation workers, who derived from 
the nearby village of Yassıhöyük and the surrounding area, were not qualified 
to do such a massive job safely. Since tunneling into the side of the tumulus 
was the method chosen, Young hired an engineer and his crew of miners from 
Zonguldak, a town in a coal-mining region on the Black Sea coast. In the tun-
nel, wooden posts and lintels were set as props every 3 m, but the density of 
the original tumulus earth packing was such that wooden walls and ceilings 
were not necessary. When the tunneling reached the tomb chamber complex, 
this crew was joined by more local workers trained in excavating and identify-
ing cultural material.2 In other words, Young took the logical approach, using 
workers trained for the specific tasks at hand. There is no reason to think that 
the Phrygian builders of Tumulus mm would have done their own work any 
differently, and it is the intent of this paper to analyze from the physical re-
mains how these ancient builders planned and executed their project.
Sometime around 740 b.c.e., a king of Phrygia died and was buried at 
Gordion.3 The tomb and tumulus built for him were larger than any other at 
­Gordion (with the mound surpassed in height in Anatolia only by the “Tumu-
lus of Alyattes” at Sardis, which is 70 m high).4 The date of construction pre-
cludes the famous King Midas as the occupant, but it is possible that the dead 
king was the father of Midas (possibly named Gordias), and the tomb would

then have been the new king’s first public display of his own wealth and power 
and that of his kingdom, as well as a fitting monument to his father. Tumulus 
mm stands nearly twice as tall as any of the other tumuli at Gordion. Its tomb 
chamber is almost twice as large as the as the next largest chamber thus far 
excavated (Tumulus Z).5 It is visible from kilometers away in any direction, but 
particularly along the main roads (both ancient and modern) north and south 
along the Sakarya River (the ancient Sangarius), westward along the Porsuk 
River valley, and east toward Ankara. The tremendous size of the tumulus is 
the main reason for this prominence, but the choice of location was also a 
factor. The site is on the Northeast Ridge, hard beside the road leading east out 
of Gordion (Plate 5.2). The highest spot on this road was already claimed by 
Tumulus W in the ninth century b.c.e.,6 but the site for Tumulus mm was in 
its own way more prominent, as it was closer to the river valley, and there were 
fewer visual obstructions in the surrounding terrain, making the new tumulus 
more visible from farther away.
It should be pointed out here that this entire process appears to this au-
thor to have been undertaken after the death of the king who was buried in 
Tumulus mm (or perhaps shortly before his death, if he had been gravely ill 
beforehand). It also appears to have been done in a relatively short span of 
time, and it is only the extreme size of the burial monument that has led to 
speculation that it was built during the life of the occupant.7 There is no sign 
that any portion of the tomb chamber complex was partially built and left to 
stand exposed to the elements either directly or indirectly (with some type of 
temporary roof). In fact, the nature of the construction and details still visible 
indicate that the building of the tomb and tumulus and the burial itself were 
likely completed as a single operation.
Before delving into the work force involved in this construction project, it is 
necessary to provide a brief description of how the tomb chamber and tumulus 
were built. The first task in its construction was the digging of a pit, in which 
the tomb chamber would have been constructed, either on packed earth or a 
gravel bed.8 The pit for Tumulus mm was a somewhat irregular rectangle, some 
16 × 18 m in plan and something over 2 m deep (see Plates 5.3–5.4). This initial

Age Gordion. The arguments put forth there are long, complicated, and, as Oscar would be 
the first to note, controversial. Fortunately, the dating of the monuments is not critical to the 
discussion in the present article.

pit was lined with limestone blocks, certainly on the four sides, and apparently 
over the entire bottom of the pit as well (see Plate 5.4; evidence for the lining 
of the bottom of the pit was indicated by probing with a stiff wire in 2002). This 
limestone perimeter wall, where measured by Young and ­measurable today, 
is about 1 m thick, with roughly dressed blocks of varied lateral and vertical 
dimensions, averaging about 80 cm long and 40 cm high (see Plate 5.5). With 
a wall height of ca. 4 m, there would have been a total of around 3,700 blocks 
used in the paving and the perimeter wall. The stone-lined pit was filled with 
rubble stone, most likely in rough layers as the perimeter wall was being built. 
This rubble stone ranged from fist sized up to about the size of a watermelon 
(to borrow Young’s choice of descriptive terms), with the smaller stones mak-
ing up the bulk of the packing.9 As the stone level approached the original an-
cient ground level, the Phrygians set rough, rounded boulders (apparently of 
andesite) in lines approximating those of the outer casing of juniper logs that 
would follow. On top of most of these boulders were placed limestone blocks 
similar (though more carefully dressed) to those of the perimeter stone wall. 
The idea seems to have been to create a stronger and more stable foundation 
for the outer casing, which would become the major load-bearing features of 
the tomb chamber complex (see Plate 5.3).
The first wooden elements in the tomb chamber complex were two pairs 
of roughly-trimmed juniper logs that ran east to west between the boulder-
and-block lines, one pair at the north and one pair at the south, positioned 
just ­under and inside the north and south walls. The tops of these logs were 
trimmed down flat to form a bearing surface for the cedar and pine floor 
beams,10 which were surrounded on all four sides by juniper logs that formed 
the lowest members of the outer casing. Next, the first pine wall beams were 
set directly on top of the floor beams, with the longer east and west wall beams 
notched to receive the ends of the shorter north and south wall beams (see 
Plate 5.4). The spaces between the pine wall beams and the logs of the outer 
casing were filled with generally fist-sized rubble, as was the space between 
the outer casing and the perimeter stone wall. At the same time, the tumulus 
fill was being added around the periphery, so that the entire complex rose in 
concert; thus the perimeter stone wall never acted as a retaining wall per se, 
but as a containment and stabilizing unit for the tomb chamber complex and 
the rubble fill that surrounded it (see Plate 5.3).
The construction continued up to the level of the eighth juniper log of the 
outer casing series. In the tops of the two logs on the longer east and west sides,

the Phrygians cut carefully laid-out notches that provided bearing surfaces for 
the three cross beam systems at north, center, and south. Each of these con-
sisted of four pine beams stacked in pairs, which were then surmounted by 
more pairs of beams that were trimmed down to create bearing surfaces for a 
double-pitched roof. At this point, the tomb was ready for the burial. Plate 5.6 
shows the tomb chamber as it would have appeared, looking like a large, 
­wood-lined open pit surrounded by rubble and the top of the stone perimeter 
wall. The roof beams are arranged beside the chamber, ready to be set on the 
gable supports after the funeral was complete.11
Once the body was installed on its cedar coffin and the grave goods were 
arranged around the tomb chamber, the pine roof beams were set in place, 
sealing the tomb. A second layer of pine roof beams was added, along with an 
upper layer of juniper logs set outside the line of the lower outer casing. The 
last wood to be added was a secondary roof of juniper logs, supported at east 
and west by a wall of stacked pine beams continuing the vertical line of the 
lower outer casing. More rubble was piled over the entire tomb chamber com-
plex, and this rubble was covered in turn by the clay and earth of the tumulus 
(Plates 5.3 and 5.7). The tomb would sit undisturbed for the next 2,700 years. 
When Young excavated the tumulus in 1957, he became a kind of detective, 
as all archaeologists do, puzzling out the story of the tomb from the available 
evidence. The following discussion of the work force at Gordion is founded on 
the observations and conclusions of Professor Young, and augmented by this 
author’s study of the tomb since 1990.
The first ancient work on the site was the digging of the pit that would create 
the foundation for the tomb chamber complex (and probably a means of pro-
tecting the intended wooden tomb chamber from moisture). As any modern 
excavator can attest, there are three main problems associated with digging a 
hole in the ground: getting someone willing and able to dig the dirt; moving the 
dirt out of the hole; and finding a place to put the dirt. The last two issues can 
be addressed first, as they are the simplest questions to answer when it comes 
to Tumulus mm. Since the entire tomb chamber complex would eventually 
be covered in a gigantic mound of dirt, the logical place to put the excavated 
soil was just outside the perimeter of the pit. Transportation distances would 
be kept to a minimum, since the soil would in essence become the first levels 
of the tumulus mantle. One can assume that the excavated dirt was spread 
evenly on the surrounding surface (every modern excavator also knows that 
any pile of excavated dirt will eventually be in the way of some future project

or pathway). The heavy traffic of even these initial stages of the construction 
process would presumably pack down the dirt, minimizing dust and creating a 
solid bearing surface for the later tumulus.
When it comes to the question of who actually did the digging, the scar-
city of written texts of any type from the literate Phrygians of this period de-
mands that one turn to logic (one might say, to deductive reasoning). Slavery 
was ­certainly common in the ancient world, but with the Phrygians, there is 
no actual direct evidence to prove its existence. For example, on the Citadel 
Mound at Gordion, finds from the Early Phrygian Terrace Building and its twin, 
the so-called Cut Clay Building, provide evidence for production of food and 
textiles on a massive scale. However, there is nothing to indicate whether the 
workers here were free Phrygians or slaves.12 Given propensity of the Phrygians 
at Gordion to continually remodel and even rebuild their citadel,13 it is easy to 
envision a select work force specializing in construction, and such a team, or 
rather, a group of teams, seems the logical system in place at Gordion. On the 
other hand, digging a pit hardly requires skilled labor, and one could just as 
easily envision that task assigned to the least experienced (but strong-backed) 
workers … or if slaves were involved, those most easily taken for granted (and 
potentially expendable).
The lining of the pit with the limestone blocks posed another issue for the 
Phrygian builders. The wall was not intended as a retaining wall, but was to 
be completely buried as it was being built. Therefore, the workmanship of the  
blocks needed only to be functional, rather than aesthetically pleasing. In  
the end, it seems as though the Phrygians split the difference (see Plate 5.5). 
The horizontal joints between the rough courses of blocks are very uneven, 
and rubble fill often spilled into this space, indicating that the rubble was be-
ing added as the wall was being built up.14 Young reported that the outer faces 
of the limestone blocks were “untrimmed,”15 but these outer faces were only 
ever visible in the line of the excavation tunnel and are now entirely inaccessi-
ble. The inner faces are still largely visible since the rubble stone was removed 
after the initial excavation of the tomb. These inner faces are roughly dressed 
and frequently have well-preserved tool marks, showing clear evidence of a 
cutting tool apparently mounted on a wooden handle and swung across the

These rubble stones were not set as chinking stones at the edges of the blocks, but can be 
seen further in, where their intentional placement would have been impossible.

surface of the block. Most tool marks suggest a blade ca. 7 cm wide, apparently 
with its edge set perpendicular to the length of the handle (like the blade of an 
adze). The limestone is relatively soft and easily worked, and the tool marks are 
similar to those found on the ends of the juniper logs. It is highly likely that the 
same basic types of iron or bronze tools were used for both materials. Whatever 
the details of the stone working, the skill level of the masons would have been 
considerably higher than that of the men digging the pit. There would also be 
the frequent need to sharpen the cutting edges of the tools, which would have 
demanded a still higher level of expertise.
It is impossible to say exactly when these stone wall blocks were procured. 
It is possible that they had been stockpiled for general use, although many ex-
amples of this local limestone have a tendency to disintegrate when exposed to 
the elements for a few years (causing some of the conservation problems with 
the architectural remains on the Citadel Mound of Gordion). The trimming 
only on the inner faces of the blocks suggests that they were worked specifical-
ly for their use in the tomb, though this does not preclude the possibility that 
they could have been stockpiled in a totally rough state, with trimming done 
as needed for the tomb project (as is the case today with many rough blocks 
acquired for use in restoration and tourist-trail stairs on the Citadel Mound). 
The bottoms and sides of the blocks are less regular than most blocks seen in 
the walls and gates of the Citadel Mound, so it seems unlikely that they were 
reused from an earlier construction project. It is also impossible to say whether 
there were separate work crews that quarried the stone (from a now unknown, 
but presumably local, source), transported it to the site, and trimmed and set 
the blocks in place. It does seem safe to say that this was indeed a separate op-
eration from the digging of the pit, and one that could either have been done 
entirely before digging began, or carried out continuously throughout the con-
struction of the tomb chamber complex.
All the stone used in the tomb construction appears to have been local, but 
even “local” means there will be a need for transportation by something beyond 
manpower alone. The distances involved would have ranged from as little as a 
few hundred meters for the smaller rubble stone to several kilometers for the 
larger boulders and limestone blocks … and all the stone may have come from 
sources many kilometers away. In any case, these limestone blocks and the 
large boulders set in the upper level of the pit fill would have required knowl-
edge and experience in moving, lifting, and transporting very heavy objects. 
For all the stones used, and particularly for the very large ones, the most logical 
means of transportation would have been a wagon or cart pulled by horses or 
oxen. This would have been done by a group of workers at least experienced in 
loading (more particularly, not overloading) any of the transportation devices. 

Liebhart

There is, in short, a fairly wide range of skill levels required for the various tasks 
at hand, and most likely a frequent overlapping of skill sets among the work-
ers themselves. However, even using levers and ramps to move large stones, at 
least some of the workers involved would have to have had strong legs, backs, 
and arms. This was work for grown men.
The case is different for the rubble fill that took up most of the space around 
the tomb chamber proper and inside the stone perimeter wall (see Plate 5.3). 
These stones were smaller: Plate 5.8 shows a collection of this rubble fill and 
illustrates the general range of size for the stones used (with the author’s hat 
as scale). It appears that the original pit was filled with somewhat larger stones 
than were generally used in the upper fill layers. This may have been intended 
to provide a more solid foundation for the tomb, but it also suggests that the 
work force here, once again, consisted of grown men gathering and placing the 
stones.
On the other hand, by far the greatest number and overall volume of rubble 
stones are much smaller, from pebbles to fist-sized stones. They are, in fact, 
stones that a child could pick up and toss. It does not seem unreasonable to 
think that the entire work force of Gordion (and perhaps including workers 
from other Phrygian sites) took part in the construction of this burial monu-
ment suitable for their dead king. Therefore it seems plausible that among this 
work force were young boys (and girls?) … not necessarily coerced as child la-
bor, but willingly taking part in this great civic project. They would have had 
the physical advantage of having hands naturally closer to the ground because 
of their size, and if Phrygian boys were anything like modern boys, picking up 
and throwing rocks would hardly seem like work. They could load wagons or 
horse packs with the stones, and perhaps even be on hand to unload them at the 
tomb, tossing them into the areas to be filled from the area just outside the line 
of the perimeter stone wall of the tomb chamber complex. The source of these 
smaller stones may have been the geologically ancient gravel beds in the area 
around Gordion,16 so one need not think of gangs of children (or adults) pick-
ing up dispersed surface rocks over a large area. While it must be admitted that 
there is no definite evidence for who did the actual collecting, it is equally true 
that no circumstances preclude any type of workers, whether children or adults.
While moving stone and rocks was no small undertaking, this part of the 
construction project paled in comparison to the amount of clay and/or dirt 
that was piled and packed to create the tumulus around and over the tomb 
chamber complex. A very rough calculation based on the current, essentially

conical mound (300 m in diameter x 53 m high), less the approximate volume 
of the tomb chamber complex and rubble pile (ca. 14 x 18 x 8 m), gives a stag-
gering 1,245,846 m3 for the volume of earth used (see Plate 5.7).17 Exactly where 
this soil was gathered has never been determined, but there is certainly no 
evidence of a pit or ditch from which it could have been taken. When Young 
began excavation of the open trench through the loose soil that had eroded 
from the tumulus (see Plate 5.1), he noted that the Phrygians had built a ring of 
clay (as Young called it) about a meter high at outer perimeter of the tumulus 
proper, and that all of the stratigraphy was sloped toward the inside.18 In other 
words, the tumulus was built from the outside in. This would appear at first to 
be a counter-intuitive method of creating a pile of earth, but it actually served 
several practical purposes. In the cone-shaped tumulus, the greatest amount 
of soil was needed for the lower portions. Wagons or pack horses could have 
brought the material in from all 360 degrees of the very large circle. This  
meant that the maximum number of transporters could have approached  
the site at the same time. Perhaps more importantly, this method also meant 
that as each load was dumped, it would get packed down by every footstep, 
hoof print, or wagon wheel that came afterwards, bringing yet more soil. This 
stratigraphy was almost completely lost when the outer trench was lined with 
a modern stone retaining wall in 1978, but it was revealed again temporarily 
in 2003, when Turkish authorities added a gutter at the top of the retaining 
wall. To build this, they cut back the scarp and left the first clear section of the 
tumulus construction to be seen in several decades (though only above the top 
of the retaining wall; see Plate 5.9). This section showed that the tumulus was 
built in roughly horizontal layers, each around 1 m thick. In every layer, the soil 
was dumped from the outside in, as Young noted for the lowest levels of the tu-
mulus. The top of one of these layers was about 4 m above the ancient ground 
level, and this is about the level of the top of the stone perimeter wall enclos-
ing the tomb chamber complex. It is the only evidence, however slight, that 
as the tomb chamber complex was being constructed, the tumulus was being 
built at the same time to its full circumference. One other possibility is that a 
smaller tumulus was built to accommodate the burial of the king in a more 
timely fashion, with the larger-in-diameter final tumulus added later. If the  
full-sized tumulus was built along with the tomb chamber complex, then 
this makes an even greater statement about the work force involved. Surely, 
this included many of the able-bodied men (and children?) at Gordion, and

most likely from other Phrygian sites as well, working in concert to create this 
oversized funerary monument.
It was not possible to determine the size of each load from the section 
cleared in 2003, but the stratigraphy suggested many small loads instead of 
larger loads spread out laterally. This might indicate that as the tumulus grew, 
it became impossible to use wagons to deliver the loads of soil because of the 
increasing steepness of the sides of the tumulus. This was brought home in 
2001, when archaeologists from the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations under-
took a salvage excavation of a small, robbed tumulus on the ridge north of 
Tumulus mm. At the end of the operation, it was decided to fill in the excava-
tion and rebuild the tumulus (which was only a few meters high to begin with). 
The archaeologists were using a local tractor to haul dirt, but in the end, the 
tractor could not carry the load up the slope, and the operation ended without 
a fully rebuilt tumulus. This emphasizes the difficulty of carrying soil up the 
much steeper slope of Tumulus mm, making pack animals with their handlers 
being the most logical means of getting the loads to the ever higher top of the 
tumulus.
While earth and stone made up the bulk of Tumulus mm, the Phrygian 
builders also needed a great deal of wood for the tomb chamber complex. 
There were approximately 77 roughly trimmed juniper logs, at least eight ­cedar 
beams, and 110 squared pine beams used in its construction. The section and 
plan (Plates 5.3–5.4) show at a glance that the juniper, cedar, and pine tim-
bers can be organized into groups with approximately the same lengths. For 
­example, the juniper logs at the lower levels were cut to fit between the longer 
logs of the east and west sides. This means that the logging crew(s) had basic 
sets of logs to locate, fell, trim, and transport. For the tomb construction up to 
the level of the crossbeams, the basic order would have been: 20 logs 6.5 m long 
(four logs serving to hold the cedar and pine floor beams, and 16 for the north 
and south sides of the outer casing); and 16 logs 8.5 m long for the east and 
west sides of the outer casing. The length of the logs was the critical matter; the 
diameters of the ends of the naturally rapidly tapering logs was less important. 
The larger ends (base ends) were as little as ca. 35 cm in diameter and as large 
as nearly 70 cm, while the smaller ends were as small as 14 cm in diameter. 
The only criterion relative to the size of the section involved the lower outer 
casing, where the 8 logs on each side had to reach approximately the same 
height, with the orientation of the large and small ends of the logs alternated 
as needed to keep the top levels more or less horizontal. The notched cuts in 
the tops of the east and west logs of the outer casing were the critical heights, 
and the depths of these notches could be cut level with each other no matter 
what the actual elevation of the tops of the logs. In fact, these eighth logs on 

107
Labors Lost and Found in Tumulus mm at Gordion
the east and west sides received more trimming than any of the other logs in 
the outer casing, showing the Phrygians’ care in setting up this critical bearing 
surface for the cross beam systems.
One can envision several different teams of workers associated with the pro-
curement and setting of the juniper logs. Felling a large tree is not the job for 
an amateur … it is dangerous work. The tool used was likely a narrow-bladed 
felling axe, and such a tool seems to have been used to square off the ends 
of the logs before use in the tomb (see below on tool marks from the tomb). 
Transporting the logs might well have been a different group of workers, al-
though if modern small-scale logging practices are any indication, the men in-
volved would have been well versed in all aspects of the operations. The mode 
of transportation was at least partially explained in 1957 by workers from Bolu 
that Young had hired. These men recognized at once the notches cut across 
the large ends of the juniper logs (Plate 5.10).19 Loggers would fell the tree,  
cut the notches with a hole in the center, then slip the notch over an axle be-
tween two wheels with the hole fitting over a pin in the axle. The wheels would 
then be carrying the weight of the heavier base end of the log, and the smaller 
end could either be dragged behind or lifted and carried by a team of oxen 
or horses. Somewhat similar holes are shown cut in the ends of beams being 
transported by sea in Neo-Assyrian reliefs from the palace of Sargon ii at Khor-
sabad.20 The reliefs show the beams with ropes through the holes (the holes 
in the logging notches in Tumulus mm were not cut all the way through the 
logs) and being towed by boats; logs are also shown being unloaded from the 
boats onto land. This method cannot be ruled out for the transport of the logs 
at Gordion, but there it seems unlikely that the juniper logs were transported 
by river.21 However these logs were brought to Gordion, the juniper trees them-
selves were certainly locally available; junipers of substantial size (though not 
as large as those found in the tomb) are still growing in the higher elevations 
some 20 km northwest of Gordion. The much closer mountains to the east may 
have had stands of old-growth juniper available in the eighth century b.c.e.22
From farther away came the smallest set (by number) of timbers for the 
tomb chamber: the eight (or more) cedar floor beams, which were all approxi-
mately 7.8 m long (the pine floor beams were of this same length). Each was 
cut to have a longitudinal joint that lapped (or was lapped by) its neighbor

(see Plate 5.3). Some of these were massive beams, one with an overall width 
of 73 cm. What is even more interesting about the use of cedar for most of the 
floor beams (and the log coffin of the dead king) is that with all the samples 
of wood recovered from the excavations at Gordion since 1988, there has never 
been a single piece identified as cedar (Cedrus).23 Unlike the juniper and pine 
used for the tomb chamber, the cedar is not a locally available species, al-
though it does grow still in the mountains along the south coast of Turkey.24 
Its rarity at Gordion suggests that the cedar was under royal control, perhaps 
coming to the city by means of diplomatic exchange or even tribute from 
kingdoms to the south or southeast of Phrygia. Whatever the means of acqui-
sition, these very large beams were transported over much greater distances 
than the juniper and pine, but the basic issues of transport were the same for 
the cedar.
The largest and longest of all the beams in the tomb is the main ridge beam, 
which is 11.44 m long by 34 cm wide by 44 cm thick. It is pine, as are all the 
squared beams of the tomb chamber walls and roof. Its extraordinary size sug-
gests it was produced specifically for use in the tomb, but the roof beams that 
flank it tell a different story. They vary in length, ranging from 8.4 to 9.1 m 
long, but there is a more telling detail in many of these beams. One can see 
in Plate 5.3 that the roof beams have rather varied sections. In addition, many 
of the south ends of the roof beams projecting out over the south gable bear 
cuttings along their edges that have nothing to do with their current position 
in the tomb, nor for any other potential position in the tomb (see Plate 5.11). It 
appears that these beams were salvaged from an earlier use, presumably in a 
major building in the city proper. The amount of work involved in producing 
a squared beam from a round log is significant, and a sound wooden member 
from any abandoned or remodeled building would typically be saved for use 
elsewhere. These might have been stored in some kind of warehouse, or even 
in a covered shed with open sides. How long these beams were stored cannot 
be determined. The pine beams are not useful for dendrochronology, since 
their annual growth rings are so wide and, because they have been trimmed, 
they do not typically have any bark preserved. Therefore, it is not possible to 
establish when they were cut, relative to the datable juniper logs in the tomb.

All that can really be said is that some of the pine beams show signs of previ-
ous use … and that these reused beams may have been limited to positions in 
the tomb chamber complex that were less critical with regard to their dimen-
sions. The walls of the tomb chamber were made from pine beams of specific 
lengths, which suggests they were produced for that intended purpose. On 
the other hand, the heights of the wall beams are not consistent. For example, 
there are six beams below the level of the crossbeam in the west wall, but 
seven beams in the east wall. This makes it seem as if the Phrygian builders 
were making do with an available stock of pine beams, cutting them to length 
as necessary.
All this tells us something about the process and mind-set of the builders 
of the tomb chamber, but it does not get us too close to the actual individuals 
involved. For that, one can turn to the thousands of tool marks left in the tomb, 
particularly those on the wooden members. Each tool mark was made by a tool 
held in the hand of a Phrygian worker, though the marks only occasionally tell 
us more than that. All the visible cuts on the wooden members of the tomb 
chamber complex were made with sharp-bladed slicing and chopping tools: 
axes, adzes, and chisels. There are no identifiable ancient saw marks on any 
wooden member in the tomb, even in notches where cutting the depth of the 
notch with a saw would have been much easier.25 While saws were used by the 
Phrygians and other ancient woodworkers,26 there is no obvious evidence that 
the builders of the Tumulus mm chamber saw a need for their use. This is not 
to say that the work was crude: the interior pine walls of the tomb chamber 
are finished so smoothly that only with strong raking light can one see any tool 
marks at all. This required great skill and very sharp tools, although it is pos-
sible that the woodworkers and the tool sharpeners were often two different 
specialized groups.
Perhaps the most personal of all the visible tool marks in the tomb is found 
on the fifth juniper log in the west wall of the outer casing. This is one of two 
juniper logs in the tomb chamber complex that have extra holes along the 
length of the log in line with the hole in the logging notch at the base end. 
These would have been on the underside of the log after the log was set on the 
axle and pin (as described above) for transportation. These extra holes were

presumably made to receive either wooden pegs to give secure purchase for a 
rope, or to fit over a pin in a draft animal’s yoke (that is to say, the holes may 
provide evidence for lifting the small end of the log off the ground for trans-
port, as opposed to dragging behind the wheels). The first hole is 3.22 m from 
the logging notch; this hole is ca. 4.1 cm in diameter and 4.0 cm deep. Next, at 
4.69 m from the logging notch, a worker started a hole in the shape of an elon-
gated octagon, with overall dimensions of 4 × 5 cm. The worker used a chisel 
with a blade 2 cm wide, and he made perhaps two passes around the hole, 
removing the infill to a depth of only about 0.5 cm (A in Plate 5.12). Then he 
abandoned this hole, moved 37 cm further down the log, and cut an elongated 
octagonal hole 4 × 5 cm in overall dimensions and 6.7 cm deep (B in Plate 5.12). 
How these holes were intended to be used is arguably not as interesting as the 
human story behind them. A worker with hammer and chisel was doing his 
job, cutting a hole to the proper dimensions, when a supervisor (most likely) 
came over and said, “No … not there … it has to be cut down here” … 37 cm fur-
ther down the log. We may never know why this was so important, but for just 
one fleeting moment, one can see that worker, bending over that log, making 
a mistake, then getting it right. Who could have done this? We may never find 
a satisfactory answer to that question, but it is certainly worth the time and 
effort to look.

A Pithos Burial at Sardis
David Gordon Mitten
I wish to present this short archaeological note to Dr. Oscar White Muscarella 
for his Festschrift, with the aim of reporting definitively on a group of objects 
from an Early Bronze Age pithos burial (ca. 2500–2000 b.c.) that I excavated 
in 1969 along with Dr. Güldem Yüğrüm and Emin Karabacak, the foreman of 
the excavation. The results were published in a preliminary report in 1971,1 and 
the artifacts have been featured elsewhere since that time. Fine color photo-
graphs have appeared in the comprehensive exhibition catalogue, The ­Lydians 
and Their World, published in 2010. These photos are now available on the 
Sardis Expedition website and are reproduced here in black and white, cour-
tesy of the Sardis Expedition.2 I am pleased to be able to update my original 
preliminary report and to include some personal reminiscences that have not 
­appeared in print. I hope that this short note will serve as an appropriate trib-
ute to Dr. Muscarella, a great archaeologist, scholar, teacher, and friend, whom 
I have known since 1965.
	
“Eski Balıkhane”
In the summer of 1969, a test excavation was carried out on the south shore of 
the Gygean Lake (Marmara Gölü), in an area known as “Eski Balıkhane” (“The 
Old Fishery”), ca. 1 km east of the modern fishery or “Balıkhane.” Observed  
in the vicinity were the remains of Roman and early Byzantine walls, as well  
as sherds ranging in date from the Early Bronze Age through the Ottoman  
period. The landowner, Ibrahim Börekci, kindly allowed us to excavate a 
­shallow 10 × 5 m trench in a washed-out section of his sesame field (Plate 6.1). 
Mr. Börekci later built a house on the site.
We laid out a shallow trench in the area where Mr. Börekci had allowed 
us to excavate. Within this trench, we found three pithos burials (large jars); 
the first two (eb 69.1 and eb 69.2) had apparently been infant burials and

­produced no artifacts.3 However, the third pithos, located almost at the ­eastern 
edge of the trench (Plate 6.2), contained the burial of a male individual (eb 
69.3), placed in a flexed position on his left side. With the burial were two grey 
(“black-­burnished”) jugs, one of which was in poor condition and could not 
be restored, and a small redware tankard (Plates 6.3–6.4).4 The man was also 
buried with a small copper or bronze dagger or knife, found by his right femur 
(Plate 6.5).5 Near his jaw was a small silver pendant in the form of a ram, which 
was perforated through the shoulder (Plate 6.6).6 On either side of his cranium 
was a gold earplug, which was fashioned out of sheet gold over a core of some 
dark substance, possibly bitumen (Plate 6.7).7
We were surprised at these discoveries, because we had never found ­anything 
like this before on the shores of the Gygean Lake. We knew that local inhab-
itants of the area were constantly hunting for the treasure of King Croesus, 
who had ruled Lydia until 547 bc, when he was defeated by the Persian King

­objects on display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara, during his visit there in 
June 2015. A pair was found in one of the Early Bronze Age elite burials at Alaca Höyük (Tomb 
B), excavated by Prof. Hamit Zübeyr Koşay in the 1930s. See Arık, Les fouilles d’Alaca Höyük,

Yortan region and at the extensive pithos cemetery at Karataş-Semayük in the Elmalı plain 
of Lycia. See Mitten and Yüğrüm, “The Gygean Lake,” 194, n. 3; Hanfmann and Waldbaum,

A Pithos Burial at Sardis
Cyrus i. These local people were hoping to find and sell valuable antiquities, 
which would then have been smuggled out of Turkey for sale on the interna-
tional art market. This being the case, we thought that we should come up with 
an alternate story to explain the presence of the gold earplugs in the pithos 
burial, in order to dissuade potential looters. We decided to tell the workmen 
that this burial had been the result of a vendetta among the local villagers.  
In the eastern section of the trench was an intrusive pit consisting of different-
colored soil from that on the floor of the trench. The presence of this intrusion 
demonstrated that someone, perhaps in very recent times, had dug into the 
soil at that point, perhaps looking for treasure.
Accordingly, the individual in the pithos burial had likely been the ­victim of 
a quarrel, perhaps because he had made some disparaging comments about 
someone’s wife or mother. So, in our version of the story, the earplugs became 
bullets, and we suggested that this man may have been executed by two shots 
to the back of the head, and then dumped into the pithos, which was already 
available. We chose to tell the foreman and the workers this, ­because we 
­wanted to prevent clandestine excavations on Mr. Börekci’s property, and pos-
sible ­destruction of the entire site. The foreman and the workmen ­accepted our 
story. Later, we filled in the trench, as we were required to do by the ­Antiquities 
Department, so that the field could again be planted in sesame. We are very 
grateful to Mr. Börekci for his kind permission to excavate this trench.
Our discovery by the Gygean Lake occurred near an old Roman ruin, called 
by the locals “The Old Fishery,” because of brick and rubble foundation walls 
that were projecting from the surface of the field near the lake. We never 
­excavated these ruins, because we went on to other archaeological projects 
including Boyah Tepe, which yielded ribbed pithoi of the Middle Bronze Age 
(ca. 2000–1600 b.c.), and two small wheel-made red ware vases.
We were neighbors of a crew of salvage airmen who camped out nearby, 
with all the comforts of the American px, including coolers of beer and Play-
boy magazines. With the help of the local fishermen, they were able to recover 
parts of a nato jet fighter, perhaps an F86, or Saberjet, which had crashed  
into the Gygean Lake due to engine failure. The pilot bailed out and was 
­unharmed. These fishermen and divers were able to recover the fuselage, the 
jet engine, the wings, and the tail, which they took back to the airbase in Izmir, 
so that they could examine the wreckage in order to determine what had 
caused the ­engine to fail. There had been several similar accidents to Turkish 
and ­American jet fighters in western Turkey in the previous weeks. The divers 
brought in a large flatbed truck and transported the pieces of the aircraft back 
to the Izmir nato airbase.

Excavation Compound, Base Camp
When our team returned to the base camp at Sardis, we approached the Field 
Director, Prof. George M.A. Hanfmann, telling him that we had a serious 
­matter to discuss with him. He was afraid that we were going to report that 
“an ­inspector” was coming from the Department of Antiquities in Ankara to 
demand to see all of the items that we had brought in since 1958, under bond, 
through the Ministry of Customs—which we were required to keep. These 
included useful things, like Prof. A. Henry Detweiler’s shortwave radio, items 
of clothing, old shoes, and even broken toilet seats in the inventory. However, 
when we showed Prof. Hanfmann the objects from the third pithos burial, he 
was enormously relieved—and thrilled—because the earplugs were the first 
gold objects found by the Sardis Expedition at Early Bronze Age sites along the 
shores of the Gygean Lake.
The objects recovered from pithos burial eb 69.3 (the two ceramic vessels, 
the bronze or copper knife or dagger, the silver ram pendant, and the pair of 
gold earplugs) were duly recorded and inventoried. The gold earplugs and the 
silver ram were transported to the museum in Manisa, where all gold objects 
found by the Sardis expedition were immediately taken by the government 
commissioners. All the finds from eb 69.3 are now in the Manisa ­Archaeological 
and Ethnographic Museum.8
These objects have appeared in preliminary form in several publica-
tions, including those by D.G. Mitten and G. Yüğrüm, G.M.A. Hanfmann and 
J.C. ­Waldbaum, and C. Roosevelt that have been cited above in the notes. In 
addition, they appeared in the 1983 volume, Sardis from Pre-Historic through 
Roman Times, edited by Prof. Hanfmann and Dr. William Mierse,9 and the 1987 
proceedings of a symposium held at the University of Chicago celebrating 25 
years of excavation at Sardis, Sardis: Twenty-Seven Years of Discovery, edited by 
Dr. Eleanor Guralnick.10 We may now add the Festschrift for Dr. Oscar White 
Muscarella to this list. A modest pithos burial with a significant assemblage, 
grave eb 69.3 by the Gygean Lake plays an important role in our understanding 
of Early Bronze Age Lydia. One hopes that the site of “Eski Balıkhane”—with 
its seemingly great potential—will remain a protected area so that it can be 
scientifically excavated in the future.

chapter 7
Attitudes toward the Past in Roman Phrygia: 
Survivals and Revivals
Lynn E. Roller
A brief anecdote from the fifth century c.e. by the church historian Socrates 
provides a good entrée into the question of the status of Phrygia and the 
Phrygians during the Roman Empire. In discussing the Arian controversy of 
a century before his time, Socrates mentions the career of Selinas, bishop of 
­Kotiaion. Socrates records: “Selinas, a bishop of the Goths, was a man of mixed 
race (ἐπίμικτον γένος), since he was a Goth from his father’s side and a Phrygian 
from his mother. And so he was able to preach readily in the church in both 
languages (ἀμφοτέραις ταῖς διαλέκτοις).”1 The mixed ethnicity of Selinas has at-
tracted considerable attention, most of it directed to the question of the two 
languages mentioned by Socrates. Socrates does not tell us what the languages 
were, but given his description of Selinas’s parents, most commentators have 
assumed that the two languages in which the bishop preached must have been 
Gothic and Phrygian. As a result, this passage has often been used as support 
for the claim that Phrygian was still in active use as a spoken language in cen-
tral Anatolia during the later Roman Empire.2 The extent to which Phrygian 
was a viable language during the Roman era is a complex question and will 
be treated in greater detail below, but it needs to be emphasized here that 
the statement of Socrates does not support this claim. This we can tell from a 
1	 Socrates, Historia Ecclesiae 5.23, in Migne, Patrologiae Graecae 67, 648.
2	 The first person to propose this was Holl, “Das Fortleben der Volkssprachen,” 247–248; fol-
lowed by Calder, “Corpus inscriptionum neo-phrygiarum 3,” 25; Haas, Die phrygischen 
Sprachdenkmäler, 59–60; Haspels, Highlands of Phrygia, 199, n. 160; Neumann, “Kleinasien,” 
175; Mitchell, Anatolia 1, 174; and Brixhe, “Interactions between Greek and Phrygian,” 252.
*	 This paper is drawn from a longer study that I am preparing on the impact of Hellenization 
on the Anatolian cultures of Phrygia and Lydia. Preliminary versions of this paper were deliv-
ered at the University of California, Berkeley, Ancient History and Mediterranean Archaeol-
ogy Graduate Group; the University of California, Davis; and a conference, “Attitudes towards 
the Past,” in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2009, and I have benefited greatly from the comments 
of those present. I would also like to thank Akihiko Watanabe and Phyllis Graham for their 
comments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

125
Attitudes toward the Past in Roman Phrygia
key piece of evidence demonstrating that Selinas did not preach in Phrygian, 
namely the account of the church historian Sozomen, also of the fifth century 
c.e. ­Sozomen records the same episode concerning the bishop of Kotiaion, but 
reports that the two languages in which Selinas preached were the ancestral 
language of his Gothic congregation and the language of his Greek ­followers: 
καὶ ἐπὶ ἐκκλησίας ἱκανῷ διδάσκειν οὐ μόνον κατὰ τὴν πάτριον αὐτῶν φωνὴν ὰλλὰ 
γὰρ καὶ τὴν ῾Eλλήνων.3 Therefore it seems assured that in preaching to the Phry-
gians of Kotiaion Selinas used not Phrygian, but Greek.
Yet this circumstance does not undercut the significance of Socrates’s 
comments. Even if Selinas addressed his congregation in Greek, the bishop’s 
mother is still identified as a Phrygian. What did it mean to consider oneself 
a Phrygian in a world in which Greek language and culture and Roman politi-
cal authority predominated? Was it an administrative label, or a geographical 
designation? Or did the term imply some deeper sense of personal identity 
that the Phrygians of Kotiaion still subscribed to, a sense of individuality that 
went beyond a purely locative description? These questions lie at the heart 
of a key problem that arises in the evaluation of cultures on the periphery of 
the Greek world, namely determining the extent of the influence of Helleniza-
tion and Romanization on the local population. The discussion of this situ-
ation has been particularly difficult in the case of Asia Minor because of its 
large size and high level of internal diversity. Earlier scholarship on Roman 
Asia Minor focused mainly on urban centers, particularly those in coastal re-
gions and river valleys in western Asia Minor, and tended to view the interior 
regions as a monolithic agricultural unit seen primarily from the perspective of 
Roman landowners.4 More recently, however, we have gained a greater appre-
ciation of the internal variety of Asia Minor and of the ways in which the local 
populations retained a distinctive regional character.5 I want to examine some 
questions of ethnic identity in Asia Minor with special focus on Phrygia: What 
characteristics distinguished the people who considered themselves Phrygians 
during the Roman Empire? And, why would the people of Phrygia have wanted 
to retain their regional identity?
3	 Sozomen, Historia Ecclesiae 7.17, in Migne, Patrologiae Graecae 67, 1468. Holl, “Das Fortleben 
der Volkssprachen,” 248, notes the passage of Sozomen but dismisses it out of hand, saying 
merely that Sozomen must be mistaken. Note the comments of Vryonis, Decline of Medieval 
Hellenism, 46–47, who reviews these two passages and also concludes that the two languages 
of Selinas were Gothic and Greek.

126
In the case of the Phrygians, these questions are particularly worth prob-
ing, since the Phrygians were one of the most distinctive and long-lived of 
the pre-Greek Anatolian peoples. The Phrygians migrated into Anatolia from 
southeastern Europe after the end of the Bronze Age (Herodotus 7.73; Strabo 
12.8.3, 14.5.29), and became a dominant presence in the political and cultural 
life of central Anatolia during the ninth through seventh centuries b.c.e. They 
retained their administrative identity, although not their political indepen-
dence, under the Achaemenian Empire through the organization of Phrygia 
into two satrapies, Hellespontine Phrygia, in northwestern Anatolia near the 
Sea of Marmara, and Phrygia Epiktetos, a mountainous district in the interior 
of west central Anatolia (Strabo 12.4.1–5, 12.8.1–2). With the conquests of Al-
exander of Macedon in the later fourth century b.c.e., however, an integral 
territorial unit of Phrygia ceased to exist, and the continuation of a distinctive 
Phrygian identity after this time lay in cultural, not political institutions. Yet, 
as the comments of Socrates and Sozomen illustrate, the sense of a uniquely 
Phrygian regional character proved to be extremely tenacious, lasting until the 
end of antiquity. This paper examines some of the factors that contributed to 
the longevity of Phrygian identity and its strong hold on the local population, 
with special focus on settlement patterns, the use of the Phrygian language in 
Roman-period inscriptions, and other evidence for ongoing connections with 
the culture of Phrygia. As we will see, Phrygian identity during the Roman era 
gathered new strength and visibility through a combination of older Phrygian 
customs that survived and newly revived interest in regional traditions.
A key part of the task lies in defining the physical territory in Roman Asia 
Minor that constituted Phrygia. By the second century c.e., the geographi-
cal parameters of the region where Phrygian identity is attested had changed 
substantially from the period when Phrygia was an independent kingdom (or 
kingdoms).6 During the early first millennium b.c.e., when Phrygian political 
power and cultural influence were at their height, the geographical extent of 
the territory dominated by the Phrygians was very broad, comprising much 
of western and central Anatolia apart from the coastal zones. This included 
the territory around the Sea of Marmara in northwestern Anatolia; the interior 
district to the southeast of the Sea of Marmara, the so-called Phrygian High-
lands; central Anatolia, the region around Gordion and Ankara; and ­extensive 
6	 The political status of Phrygia during the Iron Age is poorly understood, in large part because 
of the lack of written sources, but it is likely that Iron Age Phrygia never constituted a single 
political unit, but consisted of a number of independent kingdoms. See Genz “Iron Age,” 
136–138. For a summary of the history of Phrygia from the early Iron Age to the time of Alex-
ander of Macedon, see Roller, “Phrygian and the Phrygians,” 561–565.

­territory to the east of the Halys River.7 By the Roman era, however, Phrygian 
territory was substantially smaller. Much of northern Phrygia now lay in ter-
ritory that had been settled by Galatian immigrants; this included a number 
of communities such as Ankara and Gordion that had been prominent Phry-
gian centers during the early first millennium b.c.e.8 Western Phrygia had 
also undergone considerable changes. The upper Meander Valley in western 
Asia ­Minor was still considered part of Phrygia, but the orientation of this re-
gion was directed to the Greek cities on the Aegean coast of Asia Minor. The 
major cities of the upper Meander and Lykos River valleys, including Hier-
apolis, Philadelphia, Laodikeia, and Apameia, were Hellenistic foundations, 
designed according to the Greek urban model typical of Asia Minor. This is 
well demonstrated at Hierapolis and Laodikeia, both of which were substan-
tially rebuilt during the first and second centuries c.e. with the aid of impe-
rial donations.9 Such urban centers exhibited little affinity with the traditional 
Phrygian heartland in the interior of Anatolia. As a result of these changes, 
the principal Phrygian cultural zone during the Roman imperial era bore little 
relationship to the Phrygian territory described by Strabo (12.8.1). Extending 
across the Roman provinces of Asia and Galatia, Roman Phrygia was formed 
by cultural constructs unrelated to contemporary political boundaries. To un-
derstand what constituted Roman Phrygia, we need to look at the distribution 
of cultural markers, such as Neo-Phrygian inscriptions and other characteristic 
Phrygian artifacts.
A key criterion that helps define the geographical span of Phrygia during the 
Roman era is the distribution of Neo-Phrygian epigraphical texts. Unlike other 
indigenous Anatolian languages such as Lydian, Mysian, and Carian, which 
had disappeared permanently by the Hellenistic era, the Phrygian ­language 
is well attested during the Roman era by a series of inscriptions ranging from 
the later first through third centuries c.e. Indeed, the presence of Roman-
era inscriptions in the Phrygian language has long been considered one of 
the key factors documenting the continuation of Phrygian identity in Roman 
Asia ­Minor. My concern at this point is to define the geography of ­Roman

­Phrygia, and I will return to a more detailed discussion of the content of the 
Neo-Phrygian epigraphic corpus below, but some preliminary remarks are in 
order here. The Phrygian language is first attested in written form during the 
second half of the eighth century b.c.e., written in an alphabetic script that is 
similar to early Greek script, but with a number of distinctive letter forms that 
are unique to Phrygian. Epigraphical texts using this older Phrygian language 
and script, called Paleo-Phrygian, are widely attested throughout central Ana-
tolia from the eighth through the fourth centuries b.c.e.10 The subject matter 
of Paleo-Phrygian inscriptions is very diverse, and includes votive dedications 
and other religious texts, diplomatic documents, and many graffiti, primar-
ily names and abbreviations of names, found on pottery and wooden objects. 
While the Phrygian language has never been fully deciphered, the frequency 
and variety of written documents in Phrygian strongly suggest that Phrygian 
was the dominant language in the region, and that there was a high degree of 
literacy among the Phrygian population.
Paleo-Phrygian inscriptions cease by the end of the fourth century b.c.e., 
and no further texts written in Phrygian are found until the later first century 
c.e., when a series of stone inscriptions known as Neo-Phrygian texts begins 
to appear. These inscriptions were written in the Phrygian language but use 
exclusively Greek script. Currently, 114 Neo-Phrygian texts are known.11 All

For the earliest examples of Paleo-Phrygian texts, see Brixhe, “Inscriptions: Les graffites,” 
for graffiti on bronze and pottery objects from Tumulus mm in Gordion; Roller, “Graffiti 
on the Wooden Serving Stands from Tumulus mm”; and Liebhart and Brixhe, “Recently 
Discovered Inscriptions,” for graffiti on the timbers used to build the tumulus. The corpus 
of Paleo-Phrygian inscriptions has been published by Brixhe and Lejeune, Corpus des in-
scriptions paléo-phrygiennes; Brixhe “Supplément i”; and Brixhe “Supplément ii.” For the 
latest Paleo-Phrygian text, see Brixhe, “Supplément ii,” 7–26 (no. W-11). Paleo-Phrygian 
texts have been found throughout the extent of Paleo-Phrygian territory, and also in plac-
es well beyond Phrygian settlements, including Delphi in Greece, Jeffrey, The Local Scripts

his corpus includes some duplications and several texts that are Greek, not Phrygian. 
To this can be added eight Neo-Phrygian inscriptions published by Brixhe and Drew-

have been found in a roughly rectangular area of central Anatolia defined 
by ancient Dorylaion, Kotiaion, and Dokimeion (modern Eskişehir, Kütahya, 
and Afyon) on the west, and the large salt lake, Lake Tatta (the modern Tuz 
Gölü), at the east; to the south, the Neo-Phrygian language territory extends 
through the region of Iconium (modern Konya) and the lakes south of ­Pisidian 
­Antioch (modern Yalvaç).12 The western part of this territory includes the 
area of ­Phrygia Epiktetos, a region that had earlier been an important center 
of Paleo-Phrygian religious practice but not a major population center.13 The 
contrast between the distribution of these Roman Phrygian texts and those 
from the Paleo-Phrygian era is quite marked.14 Not only is the distribution area 
of ­Neo-Phrygian texts much smaller, but it had shifted to the south and east. 
Northern and central Phrygia now lay in territory dominated by the Galatians; 
this area has produced no Neo-Phrygian inscriptions. In contrast, the region of 
south central Anatolia, particularly the area near Beyşehir, Konya, and the Salt 
Lake (Lake Tatta), has no Paleo-Phrygian inscriptions or other characteristic 
objects of Paleo-Phrygian material culture, but has yielded several examples 
of Neo-Phrygian texts.
A key trait of Roman Phrygia, as defined through the presence of Neo-
Phrygian texts, is that this was largely a rural district, without large urban 
centers that might have drawn the economy of the region more toward the 
center of the Roman world.15 The more important cities of Roman Phrygia, 
including Dorylaion, Kotiaion, and Nakoleia in Phrygia Epiktetos, and Syn-
nada and Pisidian Antioch in the south, were small cities, not comparable to 
and ­others published since 1966. Brixhe and Neumann, “Decouverte du plus long texte 
néo-phrygien,” offers a thorough discussion of text no. 116, the longest in the Phrygian 
language; see also Lubotsky, “New Phrygian YΨOΔAN.” Good discussions of the status of 
the corpus of Neo-Phrygian texts are furnished by Brixhe, “Du paléo- au néo-phrygien”;

Phrygian,” and Drew-Bear, “Neo-Phrygian Inscriptions.”

the ­metropolitan centers on the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts. Even these 
cities are located largely on the edges of Phrygian territory. The large stretch 
of territory that comprised the interior of Roman Phrygia was almost exclu-
sively rural agricultural land, isolated from the major intellectual and artistic 
centers of the Hellenized Roman elite where contemporary Greek literary and 
cultural life would have been concentrated.16 It is a telling point that larger ur-
ban centers of Hierapolis, Philadelphia, Laodikeia, and Apameia in the upper 
Meander Valley region, while traditionally called Phrygian, have produced no 
Neo-Phrygian texts.
The corpus of Neo-Phrygian texts offers a good starting point from which to 
examine the nature of the local people. This corpus is not without problems. 
Many of the inscriptions in the corpus were copied more than a century ago 
and no longer exist; the accuracy of these copies can no longer verified. In ad-
dition, as noted above, the Phrygian language has never been fully deciphered, 
and efforts to draw conclusions from Neo-Phrygian texts need to be tempered 
by this fact.17 One unusual Neo-Phrygian text, no. 116, with 290 characters, the 
longest Phrygian text from any period, has frustrated attempts at decipher-
ment, demonstrating the limitations of our understanding of this language.18 
Despite these circumstances, however, the Phrygian language has marked 
overlaps with Greek in both syntax and vocabulary, and this, coupled with the 
brevity of most Neo-Phrygian texts and the formulaic quality of their content, 
enables us to recognize the general meaning of the Neo-Phrygian inscriptions 
in the majority of cases.
The Neo-Phrygian corpus has a very different character from the earlier 
Paleo-Phrygian material. Of the 114 examples, 50 are monolingual Phrygian 
texts, 63 contain texts in both Greek and Phrygian, and one is described as am-
biguous.19 The inscription characterized as ambiguous is in fact a Greek text, a 
dedication to the goddess Meter found on a small altar. It is typical of several 
such dedications from the Phrygian region of Roman Asia Minor and so will

there was no major urban center comparable to Sardis in the Phrygian territory as defined

not be considered here.20 The other Neo-Phrygian inscriptions, however, form 
a homogeneous group. The subject matter of every Neo-Phrygian text in the 
corpus is limited to a single function, a funerary epitaph. The majority of the 63 
Greek-Phrygian texts follow a standard pattern: the Greek text is inscribed first 
and gives the name(s) of the dedicator(s), their relationship to the deceased 
and to each other, and in some cases other information about the family; the 
Phrygian text that follows is used to express a curse directed at the potential 
violator of the tomb. Exceptions to this pattern include Neo-Phrygian text no. 
9; this uses both Greek and Phrygian language, but the Phrygian text precedes 
the Greek, and both languages record the names of dedicator and dedicatee. 
In another bilingual text, no. 48, the Phrygian text also precedes the Greek. Six 
monolingual Phrygian texts, nos. 15, 18, 30–31, 69, and 116, record the names and 
family affiliations of the dedicators as well as other information in Phrygian; 
the funerary curse is used in at least three of these, nos. 18, 31, and 69.21 The 
other 44 monolingual Phrygian inscriptions consist solely of curses directed 
toward a potential grave robber.22
Why do texts in the Phrygian language suddenly reappear after a gap of 
some four hundred years? Most scholars who have addressed this question 
start from the assumption that Phrygian was a living language, and ascribe the 
long gap in written Phrygian texts primarily to economic conditions. Accord-
ing to this viewpoint, the Phrygian language was continuously spoken in rural 
areas in central Anatolia, but the inhabitants of the region who used Phrygian 
were too poor to afford inscribed stone monuments; as a result, the Phrygian

written in Greek, were found on altars from the Phrygian Highlands, cf. Haspels, High-
lands of Phrygia, 295–358 (nos. 1–16, 52). Haspels, Highlands of Phrygia, figure 608, illus-

Brixhe, “Interactions between Greek and Phrygian,” 252, for a discussion of the nature 
of these six longer Phrygian texts. Texts nos. 15 and 30 are not complete, so it cannot be 
determined whether a curse was included or not. Text no. 48 appears in Haas, Die phry-
gischen Sprachdenkmäler, and is discussed at greater length by Lubotsky, “New Phrygian 
Inscription.” A comment by Stephen Mitchell (Mitchell, Anatolia 1, 188), “The Phrygian 
language was inscribed on tombstones of the later Roman period for a single purpose 
only, to deliver the threat of a curse against violators of tombs,” is partially but not com-
pletely accurate.

language is invisible to us from the fourth century b.c.e. through the later first 
century c.e. due to the absence of documents written on a durable medium. 
The greater stability and prosperity brought by Roman Imperial rule enabled 
the population of rural Phrygia to afford inscribed tombstones, and so these 
texts written in Phrygian once again make the language visible.23 This line of 
reasoning is supported in part by the rural find spots of almost all Neo-­Phrygian 
texts and by the existence of longer texts in Phrygian that include complex 
sentences (such as no. 116, noted above); these factors suggest that Phrygian 
could still have been spoken in the Roman era by at least some segments of the 
rural population. Yet the reappearance of written texts in Phrygian after a gap 
of some four hundred years cannot be attributed solely to economic reasons. 
Given the limited subject matter and the often repetitive nature of the lan-
guage in the Neo-Phrygian texts, one may wonder if there were more complex 
circumstances that led to the renewed use of Phrygian in funerary epitaphs.
Let us look first at the economic argument for the revival of Phrygian texts. 
This falters on several grounds. For one, there were some episodes of peace and 
prosperity in Phrygia during the Hellenistic era, and during this time there is 
evidence for a return to traditional Phrygian customs, such as renewed cult ac-
tivity at rural Paleo-Phrygian shrines and construction of substantial chamber 
tombs, but there is no evidence of texts written in Phrygian.24 The economic 
prosperity of Asia Minor during the Roman Imperial era is by itself insufficient 
to explain the reappearance of texts in the Phrygian language.
Another issue related to the reappearance of Phrygian during the Roman era 
is the status of the dedicators of the Neo-Phrygian inscriptions. The econom-
ic argument carries the unspoken assumption that written Phrygian reflects 
the linguistic identity of the poorer members of rural communities in Roman 
­Phrygia. Yet the texts do not bear this out. Several of the Neo-Phrygian texts are 
found on door-stone funerary monuments, and many of these are elaborately 
carved pieces of fine marble with attractive sculptural decoration and com-
plex moldings, works that must have involved considerable financial outlay.25 
We gain more insight in the few cases where the authors of the ­Neo-Phrygian

texts identify their situation. The dedicator of one Neo-Phrygian text (67) pro-
claims himself a freedman, a status that carried some prestige in an environ-
ment where most inhabitants were slaves of the imperial estates. Another (33) 
is a carpenter,26 and yet another (12) identifies himself as a ἱππεύς, a stable 
master.27 These are clearly not the dedications of the landowning elite, but at 
the same time they are unlikely to be the tombstones of the poorest agricul-
tural laborers. It is interesting to compare the Neo-Phrygian inscriptions with a 
group of several hundred inscribed votive offerings from the second and third 
centuries c.e. found in rural sanctuaries in Phrygia Epiktetos.28 These are ded-
icated to several deities, primarily Zeus with various regional or agricultural 
epithets. The votives are simple, often crude works; many of them were made 
from broken pieces of marble, waste products of the local quarries. They are 
carved in an unsophisticated sculptural style with scenes reminiscent of rural 
life, such as agricultural products, oxen, and people in the traditional dress of 
rural peasants. The lettering on them is crude and contains frequent misspell-
ings, indicating that they were made by and for uneducated country people, 
almost surely people of limited means. Yet the texts on these votive stelae were 
all written in Greek. Here, on dedications by the poorer residents of Phrygia, 
there is no sign of Phrygian language. Thus the presence of Neo-Phrygian texts 
in funerary inscriptions is more likely to reflect the choice of the more prosper-
ous members of the rural communities.
A further problem is raised by the prominent use of the Greek language in 
rural Phrygia. The corpus of Neo-Phrygian inscriptions itself strongly suggests 
that Greek was the dominant language. The majority of the inscriptions con-
tain language in both Greek and Phrygian, and in every example but two of 
the 63 double-language texts the Greek precedes the Phrygian text. As noted 
above, the Greek text normally records the identifying information, such as 
the name(s) of the dedicators and of the deceased, while the Phrygian text 
frequently contains only the curse formula. The repetitive and highly for-
mulaic nature of the Phrygian texts does not encourage the view that Phry-
gian was widely spoken. Some have suggested that the bilingual speakers of 
Roman Phrygia were primarily the men in the community, whose activities 
would have brought them into contact with markets and local officials where 
speaking Greek was necessary, while the monolingual Phrygian speakers were

more ­likely to be women, whose more circumscribed social situation would 
have limited their contacts to their Phrygian speaking families and rural neigh-
bors.29 Yet several of the bilingual funerary texts were dedicated solely or joint-
ly by women, and these too use Greek before Phrygian.30
We should also note that the use of the Phrygian language in funerary  
­imprecations follows a similar pattern of Greek usage in rural Anatolia. 
­Approximately 150 examples of funerary inscriptions containing curse/grave 
imprecations, found in Phrygia but written in Greek, have been published, 
the majority of them dating from the second and early third centuries c.e.31 
As was the case with the curse inscriptions in Phrygian, the distribution of 
these Greek language curses falls primarily in the rural areas of Phrygia; the 
more Hellenized cities of southwestern Phrygia, such as Hierapolis, Laodikeia, 
Eumeneia, and Apameia, have yielded few funerary imprecations.32 A further 
piece of evidence, the account of the bishop Selinas and his preaching to his 
congregation of Kotiaion discussed at the beginning of this paper, reinforces 
the view that Greek was the regular language in daily life. As shown above, the 
bishop preached in Gothic and Greek, implying that Greek was the language 
for the whole congregation, men and women.33 In sum, the evidence suggests

tion. To his corpus can be added the Greek examples collected by Haas, Die phrygischen

the tomb, but do not describe a specific punishment. On the widespread use of curse 
formulae in funerary epitaphs in Phrygia, see Robert, “Malédictions funéraires grecques”;

See the sources cited supra, notes 1 and 3. One could argue that Phrygian remained viable 
during the second–early third centuries c.e., even if it was no longer widely used in the 
fourth century during Selinas’s lifetime, but as Mitchell and others have shown, the politi-
cal disruptions of the third century c.e. had comparatively little effect on rural Anatolia. 
There was little change in the population during the third century, and thus no reason 
to assume that a language that had been widely used at that time would have died out 

135
Attitudes toward the Past in Roman Phrygia
not the widespread use of the Phrygian language for everyday communication 
in rural Phrygia, but rather the desire of some segments of the local populace 
to express their sentiments about the protection of the grave in their ancestral 
tongue.
If the dedicator of the tombstone caused all or part of his or her inscrip-
tion to be written in Phrygian, there must have been some special reason. If 
we postulate that Phrygian was used as a spoken language in rural areas, ex-
pressing a curse in the local vernacular that was designed to protect a grave 
would communicate the dedicator’s wishes in the language that the local in-
habitants would understand and, perhaps, be more likely to abide by. However, 
another, and potentially stronger motive may be at work, namely the sense 
that expressing the curse in the regional language made it more effective be-
cause it identified the curse maker more closely with the values and religious 
practices of a region that clearly considered protection of the grave important. 
This interpretation is reinforced by the recurring mention of one or more Phry-
gian deities, invoked to carry out the threat of punishment on the person who 
damages the grave. In six texts (nos. 33, 36, 48, 86, 99, 111) the enforcement of 
the curse was ascribed to the Phrygian deity Bas, and in Neo-Phrygian text no. 
48, the power of Bas, named here with the epithet Pountas Bas—perhaps Bas 
of the Pontic region—is reinforced by further reference to the deities Mitrap-
hata and Mas Temrogeios.34 The Greek text of no. 48 records the dedicator as 
Father Asklepios, ὁ πατήρ ᾽Aσκληπιός, plausibly interpreted not as the father 
of the family but as the leading figure in a religious association.35 Other Neo-
Phrygian texts, nos. 32–34, 36, 59–60, 76, 105, and 108, express the wish that 
the curse may be fulfilled by Tιος, likely to be a Phrygian equivalent of Zeus.36 
Taken together, these texts imply that Phrygian was the language of choice 
for those who wished to place their graves under the protection of Phrygian 
deities.
Thus it seems more likely that the increasing use of the Phrygian language 
in funerary texts reflects not the survival of the regional spoken language, but 
a conscious revival of the written language for this specific purpose. It was 
designed to express strong feelings about the desire for divine protection of 
a century later. Mitchell, Anatolia 1, 239–240; Strubbe, Imprecations against Desecrators, 
xiv–xv.

See the careful discussion of these texts by Lubotsky. Lubotsky, “New Phrygian Inscrip-
tion,” 122–123, suggests that the epithet Temrogeios is also a locative, referring to the Tem-
bris River (the modern Porsuk).

the grave and to wish destructive punishment on those who would disturb it, 
feelings that were important to the Phrygian population, but that the Greek 
people of western Asia Minor may not have shared. Expressing the ritual curse 
in the Phrygian language and calling on Phrygian deities to enforce it made the 
power of the curse more Phrygian, even to the majority of the population who 
were Greek speaking. Since the Neo-Phrygian inscriptions, unlike the peasant 
votives inscribed in Greek, appear to have been the commissions of families 
or groups that were reasonably prosperous, it is among the better-off stratum 
of society that the interest in identifying oneself with Phrygian traditions was 
strongest.
The revival of the Phrygian language in written texts is one of a number 
of cultural features found in the second and third centuries c.e. that point 
to a greater interest in Phrygian cultural practices. The door stone, a funerary 
stele decorated with a relief of one or more false doors, is another link with 
the Phrygian past. Both freestanding funerary stelae and doors to chamber 
tombs with carved door panels are widely distributed in Phrygia during the 
Roman era.37 The motif of the door on funerary stelae had a long tradition of 
use among the pre-Greek Anatolian peoples. It was used on funerary stelae in 
western Anatolia during the Persian period, the sixth through fourth centuries 
b.c.e., and a few examples are known from the Hellenistic period. The door 
motif is also found on a Phrygian votive of the Hellenistic period from Gordi-
on.38 After a gap of several centuries, the type reappears as the most common 
motif on grave monuments of the Roman period, and its geographical distri-
bution pattern replicates to a great extent the distribution of Neo-Phrygian 
inscriptions.39 While the meaning of the door stone and its significance as a 
funerary monument remain disputed, the large number of these objects and 
their distribution pattern imply a strong interest in reviving a regional custom 
from the past.40

Attitudes toward the Past in Roman Phrygia
Another sign of interest in the older traditions of Phrygia may be seen in 
the images found on a few examples of Roman coins minted in Phrygia. The 
images, appearing for the first time during the third century c.e., illustrate tra-
ditional heroes and founders of the Phrygian legendary past. The Phrygian city 
Midaion minted a coin with the head of Midas, the early Phrygian king and 
legendary city founder.41 The city of Otrous illustrated the Phrygian warrior 
Otreus on one coin, evidently to claim him as a founding hero, and another 
Phrygian city, Stectorion, minted coins with an image of the hero Mygdon (cf. 
Iliad 3.186; both Otreus and Mygdon are Phrygian heroes and Trojan allies). In 
both cases the city chose to create a new coin type that honored a prominent 
warrior named in the Iliad as a mark of prestige found in the city’s connection 
with its epic past.42
A further link with the past can be seen in religious practices. I have already 
noted the interest in invoking the power of Phrygian deities to protect the 
grave, implying a strong sense of the continuing power of traditional Phry-
gian cults. A further example can be found in the revival of older Phrygian 
sanctuaries in the Phrygian Highlands.43 After a hiatus of several centuries, 
worshipers returned to the venerable Phrygian center of Midas City. This had 
been an important sanctuary under the patronage of Phrygian royalty dur-
ing the early first millennium b.c.e., the period of an independent Phrygian 
kingdom.44 The Roman-period shrine at Midas City is situated at the foot of 
an earlier Paleo-Phrygian altar dedicated to two divinities.45 Inscribed votives 
inform us that the Roman-era deity worshiped here was Angdistis, sometimes  
Studien zu kaiserzeitlichen Grab- und Votivreliefs, 151–152, has proposed that the door stone 
was originally an Italian type that was introduced into Phrygia by Italian settlers during 
the Roman era. The study of Roosevelt, “Symbolic Door Stelae,” however, shows that the 
type was indeed well known in the interior of Anatolia at a much earlier date. It seems 
more probable that Italian immigrants, and perhaps other groups as well, adopted a local 
Anatolian practice.

addressed as the Mother Goddess Angdistis, the descendant of the older Phry-
gian deity Matar. As was true of other Roman-era Phrygian votive offerings, 
the language of the dedications was Greek. The Roman votives found in Midas 
City suggest that the local population sought out an ancestral deity or deities 
who would be more responsive to the concerns of the local population. The 
dedications are simple altars, often crudely carved with symbols that would 
be meaningful to the rural population of the region, such as an ox head, rep-
resentative of the rural agricultural economy, and a star or sun, radiating the 
all-seeing light of the deity.
Why do we see this resurgence of local Phrygian identity during the Ro-
man imperial period? I suggest that there were two different trends at work. 
The sense of ethnic consciousness, evident in the revival of the written lan-
guage, renewed use of older cult sanctuaries, and the newly awakened interest 
in Phrygian figures of the legendary past, may have been in part a result of 
the widespread antiquarian interests of the period of the Second Sophistic.46 
The general attention paid to earlier periods by the Asiatic Greek intellectuals 
may have awakened a comparable interest in the earlier past of Phrygia by 
the inhabitants of the region. As a result, the local Anatolian people, particu-
larly the more prosperous and better educated among them, may have devel-
oped new pride in the cultural traits of their past, showcasing the ancestral 
language while using it to emphasize the sacrosanct quality of the grave, and 
building new shrines in traditional Phrygian cult centers. The desire of the 
better-­educated element of the population to emphasize its own indigenous 
customs and traditions, particularly traditions related to religious and funer-
ary practices, would have harmonized well with the conservative ethics of the 
rural Phrygian peasantry.47
Paradoxically, the antiquarian interests of the Second Sophistic may also 
have awakened a reaction against the pervasiveness of Hellenic culture in Asia 
Minor during the first and second centuries c.e.48 The increased interest dur-
ing the Second Sophistic in the literary tradition of the earlier Greek Classical 
period would also have revived knowledge of the entrenched racist attitudes 
of fifth-century b.c.e. Greeks toward the native peoples of Anatolia, especially 
the Phrygians and Lydians, attitudes which are well attested in fifth-century

Attitudes toward the Past in Roman Phrygia
b.c.e. Attic tragedy and comedy.49 Such supercilious Greek attitudes toward 
native Anatolian peoples can be noted in proverbs and jokes of the Roman era, 
in which the assumed inferiority of Phrygians—their weakness, their igno-
rance, their suitability for enslavement—is taken for granted. The orator Dio 
of Prusa offers several comments to this effect. According to Dio, Phrygians 
are weak and unable to endure hardship and pain (Oration 68.2); furthermore 
they are natural slaves (Oration 31.113). Phrygians form the butt of an ethnic 
joke (Oration 34.5–6) because they are dull-witted and cannot grasp the ob-
vious. “More despised than Phrygians” (Oration 31.158) seems to have been a 
proverbial expression. Philostratos (Vita Apollonii 8.7.37) also considered the 
Phrygian a natural slave, one who will sell even his own family into slavery; 
in this respect Phrygians form a sharp contrast with Greeks, who are lovers of 
freedom. Plutarch (Moralia 989D) used a Phrygian and a Carian as examples 
of the individual who loves luxury more than a virtuous life, and Lucian (Dia-
logues of the Dead 15) considered the Phrygian the archetypal coward. In the 
Metamorphoses of Apuleius, the Phrygian eunuchs who serve as priests of the 
Magna Mater are stereotypes of every disgusting and dirty human characteris-
tic. The actual Phrygians who lived in Asia Minor must have been keenly aware 
that they were viewed as inferior by contemporary Greeks, and this circum-
stance may have sparked their desire to emphasize their own traditions as a 
means of remaining aloof from Hellenism.
In sum, the Phrygian character that was noted by Socrates was a combi-
nation of survivals and revivals. The survivals of memory of a distinguished 
past and a distinctive tradition of regional cults combined with revivals of the 
written language and long-abandoned sanctuaries. The Roman author Ennius 
reportedly said that he had three hearts because he knew Greek and Oscan and 
Latin (Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 17.17.1).50 The Phrygians of the Roman impe-
rial period can be said to have had three hearts also, existing in the Roman 
world of Greek Asia Minor with an increasingly strong regional culture that 
nurtured Phrygian identity. The strength of this regional culture would last for 
several centuries. Even in the fifth century c.e., both Socrates and Sozomen, 
Greek authors of a History of the Church, viewed the Phrygians as a race apart.

passim.

Note the discussion of Wallace-Hadrill, Rome’s Cultural Revolution, 1–37, on Ennius’s use 
of the word corda, “heart,” to denote more than just the three languages spoken by Ennius, 
but also the distinct identities of three ethnic groups.

The City Mound at Gordion: The Discovery, Study, 
and Conservation of the Wooden Fragments from 
Megaron 3
Krysia Spirydowicz
	
Dedication
Oscar White Muscarella has long been an advocate of collaboration ­between 
scholarly disciplines. As a tribute to his career, this paper illustrates the 
­importance of close collaboration between archaeologists and conservators, 
and the benefits to be gained by a continuing dialogue between related academ-
ic specializations. The subject is particularly appropriate for Oscar’s Festschrift, 
as it was he who discovered Megaron 3 in 1957 and initiated its excavation.1
	
Introduction
During the campaigns of 1957, 1959, and 1961, Rodney Young and his team 
­uncovered the remains of Megaron 3, a palatial structure that was located close 
to the main gate of the Phrygian city of Gordion (Figure 8.1). The ­building had 
collapsed as a result of a massive fire that destroyed much of the early ­Phrygian 
city—as indicated by a widespread “Destruction Level” in those areas that 
have been excavated. Just when this destruction occurred is a matter of debate, 
with Muscarella adhering to Young’s low dating, now referred to as the “old 
­chronology.” Based on an analysis of the finds from the ­destruction level and re-
lated contexts, Muscarella and other proponents of the old ­chronology ­maintain 
that the destruction of the city occurred ca. 700 b.c. or shortly thereafter.2

The City Mound at Gordion
A “new chronology” has been proposed based on C-14 analysis of charred seeds 
from the nearby Terrace Building, which were dated by the radiocarbon-dating 
laboratory at Heidelberg University to ca. 800 b.c.3 According to the new chro-
nology, taking into account the C-14 dates and what are seen to be anomalies 
with the old chronology, the destruction is placed at ca. 800 b.c. Although the 
new chronology has gained traction, Muscarella stands firm, and the date of 
the destruction of Early Phrygian Gordion remains unresolved.4

building materials, measured up to 2 m deep in some sections. A ­detailed study

of the remains indicated that the once imposing building had been constructed 
of mudbrick, stone, and wood and further that the structure was probably two 
stories in height, featuring an anteroom and a great hall.5 Originally, the roof 
was supported by two rows of square wooden posts running the length of the 
building. The position of the posts was preserved in the soil and recorded on 
the building plan (Figure 8.2, Plate 8.1). This arrangement created an ­impressive 
interior space that featured a central nave and two side aisles as indicated in the 
reconstruction drawing by Grace Freed Muscarella (Figure 8.3).
The burned deposit also contained remains of the fine objects and furnish-
ings that had once been used in the building, including pottery, bronze vessels, 
and implements, layers of burned textiles, carbonized fragments of wooden 
furniture with ivory attachments, and other types of wooden artifacts. Many of

the inorganic objects such as pottery and bronzes survived in complete or frag-
mentary form while most of the organic materials such as textiles, wood, and 
basketry were consumed by the fire. There were some exceptions: a ­number 
of carbonized wood fragments were recovered along with charred pieces of 
textiles and basketry. While the charring process preserved many surface

Recovery of the Wood and Post-Excavation Treatment
Previous study of the wood remains was hampered by the limited amount 
of information available in Young’s excavation notebooks6 and in his pub-
lished report.7 In addition, a significant error had occurred during the typed 
­transcription of Young’s field notes. Discovered only in 2007, the word “west” 
had been substituted in the typed manuscript for Young’s original designation 
of “east.” In fact, all of the furniture remains found in Megaron 3 during the 
1959 season were located along the east wall of the structure.
Young’s “first piece of furniture” (5817 W 83) was discovered near the east 
wall of the large central room of Megaron 3 (Room 3). In a thick layer of burned 
debris, the excavators found several bronze angle brackets as well as bronze 
studs and nails along with “masses of shapeless charcoal.”8 “A few scraps of 
burned cloth” were also recorded. Young’s notes indicate that “carbonized 
wood … rectangular in section and decorated on two faces with round-­headed 
bronze studs” were also found, although only the bronze fittings from this 
piece survive today (Plate 8.2).
Thirteen carved ivory plaques were discovered in close proximity to the 
bronze furniture fittings, but Young was not able to determine whether they 
belonged to the same piece of furniture or to another that had perished.9 
­Measuring ca. 5 cm per side, the square ivory plaques were tinged in places 
with grayish blue as a result of exposure to heat. Three were decorated with 
a geometric pattern of concentric squares (Plate 8.3); the other ten featured 
human and animal figures. The three best-preserved plaques featured a ­griffin 
eating a fish, a deer, and a warrior on horseback (Plates 8.4–8.6). Each of the 
three plaques with geometric designs had evidence of a single iron pin extend-
ing from the center back, indicating that they had once been attached to a 
backing, possibly of wood. The ten figural plaques had also been attached to 
some other object, by means of bronze pins that extended out from the left 
and right sides. Citing the parallel of a wooden figure of a griffin and fish from 
Tumulus P, Young concluded that the carvings reflected a local ivory working

tradition.10 The portrayal of the Phrygian warrior was highly significant as it 
was the first representation of a human figure to be found at Gordion.
Further exploration of Room 3 uncovered additional remains of charred 
­furniture. The “second piece of furniture” (5818 W 84) consisted of an ­associated 
group of carbonized fragments decorated with wood inlay (Plate 8.7).11 
­Unfortunately, the position of these pieces was not recorded at the time of 
­excavation so it was not possible to reconstruct the complete inlay pattern. 
Differences in color could not be used as an aid to reconstruction, as all of the 
pieces were charred a uniform jet black. In 2007, a thorough examination of the 
grain direction and dimensions of each piece of wood finally revealed the ­basic 
design, which consisted of a field of open squares surrounded by a checker-
board pattern. It is possible that these fragments are the remains of the top of an 
inlaid table, much like the Mosaic Table from Tumulus P.12 If so, it is likely that 
the design was enhanced by a color contrast between the different woods. For 
the Mosaic Table, there was a marked contrast between the pale background 
wood identified as boxwood and the darker pieces of inlay which were yew.13 
The wood species analysis for the “second piece of furniture” from Megaron 3 in-
dicated that boxwood and yew were used here as well, relating this piece closely 
to the Mosaic Table in terms of design, inlay technique, and choice of woods.14
Bronze tacks and other small pieces of charred wooden inlay were found 
in the same room but none of these could be assigned with any certainty to 
either the first or second piece of furniture. In his field book, Young described 
the pieces of inlay as “cubes, wavy blocks and one triangular piece of wood” 
(Plate  8.8) and assigned them to the second piece of furniture.15 However 
on the catalogue cards or so called “wood cards” which were compiled later, 
­similar pieces were listed as belonging to the first piece of furniture.16
Two wooden plaques with carved figural decoration (5915 W 89 and 6278 
W 108) were found in close proximity, near the south floor beam in Megaron 3.

The first plaque (5915 W 89) was discovered lying face up (Plate 8.9). According 
to Young, cracks began to develop while the piece was being cleaned in ­situ.17 
This probably resulted from loss of moisture as the piece was freed from its 
earth ­matrix. Due to its extreme fragility, the piece was block-lifted by coating 
the front surface with “glue” and lifting the entire piece as a unit along with 
the block of earth beneath it. After further cleaning, a lively processional scene 
was revealed.18
Soon after, the piece was drawn by Joseph S. Last, the excavation artist, and 
many more details of the shallow relief carving became evident (Figure 8.4). 
According to Young, many hours of study and consultation were necessary to 
work out the details.19 Last’s drawing revealed that the procession consisted 
of six bulls with widespread horns and long tails led by a mounted warrior on 
horseback. The last two bulls in the procession were represented only by the 
carved traces of the horns of the animals. The procession was bordered by 
­geometric friezes in the form of “guilloches, loops, latticing, etc.”20
Later in the season, the second wooden plaque (6278 W 108) was dis-
covered.21 The piece was then drawn by the excavation artist Andy Seuffert 
(Plate 8.10). Two carved sections were preserved, designated as piece A and 
piece B by the excavators. The carved detail on both sections depicted a row of 
warriors mounted on horses and carrying spears and rosette-like shields. Deco-
rative borders were evident above and below each scene. Some of the border 
designs on the W 108 plaque occur also on W 89, such as a circle and ­lattice 
­pattern evident on a number of fragments from piece A. Different ­border 
designs were apparent on other fragments belonging to this scene, namely 
loops and herringbone patterns and a series of tall, narrow triangles on a plain 
band.22 On piece B, a loop pattern was evident along the bottom edge. Unfor-
tunately, the top edge was not preserved.
Additional carbonized wood fragments with carved geometric decoration 
were discovered in the charred debris. These were identified at the time of 
­excavation as fragments of burned wooden bowls (6168 W 92 through 6176 
W 100 from Megaron 3 and 11156 W 119 from CC3). Various designs occur on 
these fragments, including a triangle-and-diamond field and a checkerboard

Experimental Research
In 2004, all the carbonized furniture fragments, wooden objects, and bronze 
­attachments from the Gordion City Mound were removed from the acidic 
cardboard boxes in which they had been housed at the time of excavation. 
They were transferred to heavy-duty, acid-free storage boxes lined with Volara 
foam. In general, many decorative details were well preserved in the charred 
wood although it was noted that the pieces were light in weight and liable to 
fracture.23 Because of their fragile state, the possibility of consolidation treat-
ment was considered. Butvar B-98, a polyvinyl butyral resin, had been used 
successfully to consolidate many pieces of the fragile wooden furniture from 
Tumuli mm, P and W,24 so its use was also considered for the carbonized wood 
from the City Mound. In 2004–2005, a research project was carried out in the 
Art Conservation Program at Queen’s University by graduate student Kim 
­Cullen Cobb to assess the effectiveness of consolidating charred wood with 
Butvar B-98 or an alternative thermoplastic resin.25
Cobb’s research report provided a useful literature review of the avail-
able information on the process of the charring of wood.26 As she reported, 
­temperatures of 300°C to 1000°C in the absence of oxygen will cause wood 
to char. The process begins below 100°C with the loss of adsorbed water; 
­dehydration continues up to 200°C. At this point, the wood has also lost its 
organic constituents along with any absorbed gases, resulting in a weight 
­reduction of approximately 35%. Longitudinal shrinkage and catastrophic loss 
of cellulose occurs between 200°C and 400°C. The chemical changes caused by 
the process of carbonization produce wood that is brittle and light in weight. 
In the presence of oxygen, combustion of the wood will occur, but if oxygen is 
absent, then charring will continue.
There were two phases to Cobb’s experimental research. New ­hardwood 
samples were carbonized in an oxygen-free environment in a furnace. The 
first set of samples was consolidated in a 10% (wt/vol) solution of Butvar B-98 
in a 60:40 mixture of ethanol and toluene for varying time periods. ­Vacuum 
­pressure was used to consolidate some samples, but most were simply

was followed by oven drying. The depth of penetration of the consolidant was 
­determined by scanning electron microscopy. Compression testing was used to 
evaluate the strength of consolidated and unconsolidated samples. Although 
the ­consolidated samples proved to be stronger, 71% of the total number 
­exhibited severe cracking.
The second phase of the research involved additional experiments that were 
designed to answer questions that arose during the first phase. This ­included 
a comparison of the effectiveness of Butvar B-98 and Paraloid B-72 as con-
solidants for charred wood. New hardwood samples were carbonized as before 
in a furnace in an oxygen-free atmosphere. Two solutions were prepared: a 
10% (wt/vol) solution of Butvar B-98 in a 60:40 mixture of ethanol and toluene, 
and a 10% (wt/vol) solution of Paraloid B-72 in acetone. Sets of samples were 
soaked in each of the two solutions for 72 hours. In order to ­assess the effects 
of solvent action alone on the charred wood, additional sets of samples were 
soaked in solvents only, i.e. in either a 60:40 mixture of ­ethanol and ­toluene or 
in acetone. Changes in mass and volume were ­recorded. ­Surface ­durability was 
assessed via a pencil hardness test and gloss was measured ­using a gloss meter.
While both consolidants significantly improved the structural stability and 
surface hardness of the wood, severe cracking occurred in 92% of the consoli-
dated samples. Widespread cracking was also evident in 83% of the samples 
that were soaked in solvents only. The enormous stresses that had developed 
in the samples due to expansion during treatment and contraction on drying 
were relieved by extensive fracturing of the charred wood. The results of this 
experimental work led Cobb to conclude that the adsorption of solvents and 
consolidants was hazardous to the structural integrity of the charred samples. 
Rather than risk further deterioration of the exceedingly fragile wood from the 
City Mound, safer alternatives that involved minimal intervention were adopt­
ed, including the construction of supports for handling and housing in archival 
storage containers.
	
Examination and Reassessment of Furniture and Wooden Objects 
from Megaron 3
In 2007, an intensive re-examination by the Gordion Furniture Project team 
led to a re-interpretation of the carbonized wood remains from Megaron 3.27 
27	
In 2007, the Gordion Furniture Project team consisted of Elizabeth Simpson, director, 
Krysia Spirydowicz, senior conservator, Alice Paterakis, associate conservator, and Ariel 
O’Connor, graduate student intern.

The City Mound at Gordion
These consisted of groups of fragments that had been previously identified 
by the excavators as incised plaques, carved bowls, plain bowls, and an inlaid 
­table. Based on Cobb`s research, it was possible to model a destruction scenario 
in which parts of the burning building collapsed on the furniture and wooden 
objects in Room 3. Once the available oxygen was consumed, the wood under 
the rubble piles continued to smolder slowly at temperatures between 400°C 
and 600°C. This process preserved the shape and form of the wood as well as 
many surface details.
Drawings and digital images aided in the interpretation of the carved 
­designs, and were also helpful in establishing the probable dimensions of 
some of the pieces. Both geometric motifs and figural designs were identified. 
This work is described in greater detail below.
	
Wooden Plaques (5915 W 89 and 6278 W 108)
These two panels, both found in Megaron 3, may represent sections of the 
same object, as the style and the subject matter are similar. Young recognized 
the ­importance of the first piece (W 89) as soon as it was uncovered. In his 
notebook, he wrote that “it was possible to see that the relief carving was in the 
finest and most delicate technique, reminding [sic] of ivory carving.”28 When 
panel W 89 was examined in 2007, many of the details previously observed 
by Young and Last had disappeared due to the deterioration of the wood 
(Plate 8.9). ­According to Young, the application of a type of “glue,” presumably 
Alvar,29 to the upper surface enabled the fragile wood to be lifted intact. How-
ever, over the intervening years it had restricted the movement of the wood. As 
a result, severe shrinkage and cracking had occurred and the wood had sepa-
rated into numerous fragments. The “glue” was still visible as a shiny layer on 
the surface.
Young did not describe how the fragments of panel W 108 were recovered 
but did indicate that the two largest pieces were designated as pieces A and B. 
A comparison between an original excavation photograph and an image taken 
in 2007 (Plate 8.11) revealed extensive deterioration. Most of the fragments 
from piece A exhibited patches of a shiny surface coating, while some frag-
ments from piece B had a matte surface. Based on this evidence, it is possible 
to conclude that some or all of the fragments of piece A were coated with an

adhesive and lifted as a unit, while the three fragments of piece B were perhaps 
strong enough to be lifted individually. Some old glued joins were observed on 
piece A.30 It is likely that the pieces were glued together at the time of excava-
tion or shortly thereafter.
Both panels (W 89 and W 108) had been stored in shallow cardboard boxes 
padded with cotton wool. This storage solution provided little support to the 
fragile wood and, in addition, caused many cotton fibers to stick to the backs 
of the panels. In 2007, both panels were cleaned and repaired. Tweezers and 
­adhesive tape were used to remove the cotton fibers from the backs of the 
­panels. The cleaning of the back of W 108, piece B revealed the original dark 
brown color of the wood, indicating incomplete charring. Loose fragments 
were reattached using a 30% (wt/vol) solution of Butvar B-98 in ethanol as the 
adhesive. Plastic trays lined with Volara foam served as temporary supports for 
particularly fragile fragments, allowing them to be examined and compared to 
other wood fragments without direct handling.
Intensive study of the pieces allowed the conservators to explore ­problematic 
issues such as the correct orientation of the processional figures. On panel 
W 89, the line of bulls led by a single mounted horseman was moving to the 
right, whereas on panel W 108, piece A, the horses and mounted warriors were 
­moving to the left. Some differences were apparent in the two major sets of 
fragments making up piece B: one fragment showed a group of warriors and 
horses moving to the left accompanied by two walking figures (only the lower 
legs and feet were preserved) while the other featured a line of warriors and 
horses moving to the right. Although not identified as such, the latter must be 
the scene drawn by Andy Seuffert (Plate 8.10).
The catalogue cards or “wood cards” describe the horses in panel W 108 as 
having the “same thin legs, looped tails, high curved rumps and saggy backs 
as the bulls in W 89. Necks arch forward with fine standing-brush manes ….” 
Further, the warriors are described as flat footed, with “their bodies … hidden 
behind round shields … decorated with a band of radiating strokes around a 
central compass dot.”31 The arms and shoulders of the warriors were visible 
above their shields, and each one held a spear that slanted diagonally toward 
the right. An additional detail not recorded on the catalogue cards was that the 
tails of the bulls in W 89 ended in short bushy tassels, whereas the tails of 
the horses in W 108 featured much longer tassels. This suggests the ­difference

­between the actual tails of bulls and horses and may have served to ­differentiate 
the two animals on these plaques.
One possible interpretation is that the fragments of both panels represent 
a single long frieze with the two processions meeting in the middle. Another 
interpretation is that all three major pieces represent separate friezes. As no 
joins were found between any of the large pieces, it is possible that the latter 
supposition is correct. Unfortunately, there is virtually no evidence to suggest 
how the panels were used in Megaron 3. As they were flat and thin, one might 
suggest that they functioned as decorative inserts in wooden doors, windows, 
or case furniture. This idea is supported by one small clue in Young’s exca-
vation notebook, which mentions that two thin wooden boards were found 
­beside the second panel from W 108, framing its lower edge. He described them 
as being “too thin and too cracked to try to save or take up …”32 and thus, they 
did not survive.
	
Fragments with Geometric Patterns (6168 W 92–6176 W 100 and 
11156 W 119 from CC3)
Groups of charred wooden fragments carved with geometric patterns were 
studied in detail by the conservators using drawings and photography. These 
had been identified by the excavators as fragments of burned wooden bowls. 
The pieces were sorted into new groupings, based on the patterns that were 
evident on their top surfaces (Plate 8.12). As an aid to reconstruction, a ­full-size 
paper template of each design was prepared, and the existing fragments were 
laid on top. This method allowed the entire pattern to be visualized, and it 
provided a useful aid to establishing matches within a particular fragment 
group.
Three different sets of geometric patterns were identified. One design con-
sisted of a checkerboard and herringbone pattern, while the second featured 
a field of triangles and diamonds. The third design was considerably more 
complex, with at least three bands of design elements identified.33 One band 
was decorated with a carved zigzag pattern, and a second band featured a 
­series of square panels filled with a network of diamonds. In this second band, 
an X ­motif was incorporated into the diamond pattern at intervals; another 
­variation featured alternating plain and decorated triangles in a square field. 
Checkerboard designs appeared in the second and third bands, alternating

with ­triglyph motifs. With the small number of fragments available, many vari-
ations were seen. Some fragments appeared to be from different objects, based 
on differences in design.
Some of these designs are seen on Phrygian painted pottery, which was ­often 
decorated with bands of geometric decoration. Typically, a series of ­panels 
formed a frieze that completely encircled the vessel. The same motifs that 
occur on the fragments of charred wood are also found on pottery recovered 
from Megaron 3, such as the panels with a checkerboard design on a painted 
Phrygian krater (Plate 8.13), and the triangles filled with a diamond pattern on 
a round-mouthed jug (Plate 8.14).
A careful examination of numerous fragments from the above group in-
dicated that the grain direction of the wood ran parallel to the surface. For 
the sake of comparison, a number of wooden bowls from Tumulus P were 
also ­examined. In these objects, the grain did not typically follow the surface 
contour in a uniform manner. Except at the very bottom, the rings radiated, 
with the pith sometimes visible at the two ends of a bowl where the handles 
­extended near the rim. This indicates that many of the Tumulus P bowls were 
carved to their dished shape from a block of wood that was cut from half a log 
or branch of a tree. This led the conservators to conclude that the charred frag-
ments from the City Mound may actually have belonged to objects with flat 
sides such as plaques, decorative panels, or boxes.34 If that is the case, what 
seems to have been the heat-induced curvature of the wood was ­misinterpreted 
by the excavators, who believed the fragments belonged to bowls.
	
Conclusion
Compared to the abundant remains of furniture and wooden objects from 
­Tumuli mm, P, and W, the limited number of fragments that survived the 
­destruction of Megaron 3 provide scant evidence of the styles and types of 
furniture that were once in use in the royal palace—if Megaron 3 is to be iden-
tified as such. Some similarities with the furniture from the royal tombs are 
evident: for instance, the inlay of “the second piece of furniture” recalls that 
of the ­Mosaic Table from Tumulus P, while the quantities of bronze studs from 
Megaron 3 suggest their use as decorative elements on stools such as that from 
Tumulus P or a serving stand comparable to the stand from ­Tumulus W. The 
most striking discovery was the wooden panels carved with processional 
scenes. Whether the activities depicted are of a religious or civic nature is not 
34

clear, but it is noteworthy that human figures are shown. Aside from repre-
sentations in stone sculpture and architecture, human (or divine) figures are 
not common in early Phrygian art. Crudely drawn figures have been found 
on “doodle stones” from Megaron 2 on the City Mound,35 and the image of a 
­Phrygian warrior occurs on an ivory plaque from Megaron 3 (Plate 8.6), but no 
other depictions of the human form have been found on the wooden objects 
from Gordion. A carved wooden crest rail of a chair from Tumulus mm depicts 
a series of animals but without any human presence.36
Thus the panels and other charred wooden fragments from Megaron 3 
­provide new information that broadens our understanding of Phrygian wood-
working techniques and furniture fabrication. The carved panels suggest 
that larger pieces of case furniture may have existed, most likely for storage. 
At ­present, there are no known examples of such objects from the ancient 
­kingdom of Phrygia, but it is possible that future archaeological excavations 
will bring more pieces to light.

Monumental Entrances, Sculpture, and Idols at 
Kerkenes: Aspects of Phrygian Cult East of the 
Kzlrmak
Geoffrey Summers and Françoise Summers*
Abstract
The Iron Age capital on the Kerkenes Dağ is almost certainly the place Herodotus 
called Pteria, and which was captured by Croesus, the last king of Lydia. The city, en-
closed by a seven-kilometer circuit of strong stone defenses, was looted and burnt. 
Excavations have uncovered two monumental gateways. One of these, the Cappadocia 
Gate, controlled movements through the city wall while the other led into the Pala-
tial Complex situated on the southern ridge within the city. The plans of these two 
gateways have much in common with one another, such as towers or tower-like plat-
forms flanking a wide stone paved passage leading up to double-leaf doors housed 
in monumental wooden façades. In the Cappadocia Gate were an aniconic granite 
stele and a second stele in the form of a semi-iconic idol carved from soft white stone 
and set up on a built stepped monument. Graffiti at the front of the Gateway appear 
to depict several types of idol and stele. At the Monumental Entrance to the Palatial 
Complex were found an aniconic granite stele associated with a “libation hole” and, 
on the flanking platforms, rows of large, double-faced semi-iconic idols. This paper 
describes and compares these monuments and their settings, and then discusses their 
Phrygian characteristics. A concluding section examines some of the implications of 
these discoveries for the spread of Phrygian culture to the east of the Kızılırmak after 
the time of Midas the Great.

hospitality.
…
At the central Anatolian Iron Age capital on the Kerkenes Dağ, newly founded 
in the later seventh century b.c., seven kilometers of strong stone defenses 
are pierced by seven city gates (Figures 9.1–9.2).1 The city is almost certainly 
to be identified with the place that Herodotus called Pteria.2 Rejection of this 
identification would not, however, alter the fact that Kerkenes was a new capi-
tal city of great strength and opulence, founded by newcomers from the west 
and thoroughly Phrygian in character, as demonstrated by the evidence of 
inscriptions, graffiti, architecture, small finds, and ceramics.3 The date of the 
foundation has yet to be determined with the scientific precision that dendro-
chonology will surely provide when suitable timbers are recovered. It is how-
ever clear that the silhouette animal style painted pottery known as Alişar iv 
was no longer manufactured in the region. Looting and destruction of the city, 
followed by its abandonment, was presumably related to the conflict between 
Cyrus the Great and Croesus, king of Lydia, and thus would have occurred 
around the time of the so-called “Battle of Pteria” fought not many weeks be-
fore the destruction of Sardis. Recent proposals to lower the traditional date of 
547 b.c. for the fall of Sardis,4 while not conclusive, may not be incompatible 
with evidence from Kerkenes. Whatever the absolute dates for the foundation 
and destruction of Kerkenes, the archaeological evidence provided by remote 
sensing and excavations do not suggest a span of much greater length than a 
century.
Each of the seven city gates at Kerkenes exhibits a unique plan expertly 
designed to best exploit the defensive advantages of the terrain. This is in 
contrast to Imperial Hittite and Neo-Hittite city gates which more or less 
conform to standard plans—so much so that the Luwian hieroglyphic sign

for a city gate is a stylized gate plan. The city gate that we have called the 
Cappadocia Gate, because it looks out over the rolling plains towards snow-
capped Erciyes Dağ dominating the modern region of Cappadocia, has been 
fully excavated. Excavations have also exposed a monumental gateway that 
provided access to the Palatial Complex. Preliminary thoughts on the simi-
larities and differences between these two monumental gateways and the 
carved and sculpted monuments that were set up inside them are discussed 
below, together with brief comments on some wider implications of these 
discoveries. Both monumental entrances underwent development between 
the foundation of the city in the later seventh century b.c. and violent de-
struction by fire in the 540s.
The Cappadocia Gate had several major components in addition to the five 
towers. (Plate 9.1 and Figure 9.3). There were, from front to back, a slanted and 
gently inclined entrance passage; a rectangular open court that was also slightly 
inclined; and a rear section with a central pavement enclosed by monumental 
wooden façades housing large double doors. Sandstone embellishment on the 
front towers may also have been part of the original construction. By the time 
the gate came to be burnt, several minor improvements had been made. The 
entrance passage and most of the court had been gradually paved. This paving 
followed different alignments both to the entrance passage and to the main 
axis of the gate, presumably for pragmatic reasons. A broad urban roadway 
inside the gate was also stone paved. In the rear section, rooms were created, 
on first one then on both sides of the passage. A plinth with relief carving sup-
porting a life-sized statue was installed in the north corner of the rear section, 
presumably at a time before the creation of the northeast room (Plates 9.3–9.7, 
Figures 9.9–9.12). Finally, two cultic monuments, an idol and a stele, were set 
up inside the court (Plate 9.2 and Figure 9.7).
Not dissimilar features were found at the Monumental Entrance to the Pala-
tial Complex (Plate 9.8 and Figures 9.4–9.6). Here more radical developments 
are observed through a series of stages from an initial focus on defense to a 
much more public function with an emphasis on monumentality, grandeur, 
and sumptuous embellishment. Major components were a slanted approach 
and an inclined entrance court; a rear section with a central pavement and a 
room to either side, enclosed by monumental wooden façades, each housing 
large double doors; and a broad paved roadway inside the gate leading to the Au-
dience Hall. Set up within this entrance were cultic ­monuments, ­freestanding 
columns, plinths, statuary, and inscribed relief sculpture; ­sandstone idols stood 
on the tower-like flanking platforms while one or more aniconic stele(s) were 
installed behind the inner façade. Here there were more substantial alterations 
together with gradual improvements.

Summers and Summers
164
Thus the Cappadocia Gate and the Monumental Entrance to the Palatial Com-
plex can be seen to have had in common several features:
(i)	
a stone paved approach sloping up towards a pair of wooden fa-
çades, each housing large double-leaf doors,
(ii)	 a stone paved court in front of the outer façade,
(iii)	 a rear section between the façades with a stone paved passage with 
rooms to either side,
(iv)	 a broad paved roadway onto which the doors on the inside façade 
opened, and
(v)	 cultic installations including steles and statuary.

Defense
Defense was the foremost purpose of the Cappadocia Gate, while it is per-
haps only initially that the Monumental Entrance comprised some kind of 
­castellum-like center of control, designed with a primary emphasis on defense. 
At each entrance similar building methods and materials were employed: 
massive stone walls with horizontal beams incorporated so as to stabilize wall 
faces, supported by stone glacis with a type of cyclopean style of facing. Both 
too were provided with double towers and stone paving. However, the Monu-
mental Entrance was soon to lose much of its defensive purpose, as the elite 
residence behind it grew to palatial proportions with the erection of a massive 
audience hall and associated buildings.5 If in the final phase of development, 
the massive platforms that flanked the Monumental Entrance retained a de-
fensive function, this was perhaps to be seen in its embellishment with large 
symbolic idols rather than practical military design. It goes without saying, on 
the other hand, that the Cappadocia Gate retained its central importance as 
a defensive structure, protecting the city from enemy attack. There is no evi-
dence that this impressive gate was taken by storm, nor indeed is there as yet 
any evidence that the city offered any resistance before surrender or capture.
While it is not the purpose here to elaborate on military aspects of the city 
defenses at Kerkenes, it is necessary to consider the design of the Cappado-
cia Gate from a tactical point of view before addressing other matters. This is 
because defense, while not exclusive, would have overridden other consider-
ations. An enemy force approaching the gate with hostile intent would have 
been confronted by the intimidating sight of three tall, equally spaced towers, 
the lower portions of which were protected at their base by a steep stone glacis. 
The symmetry was not total, for the gap between the South and Middle Towers 
was occupied by a gently inclined stone-paved entrance passage, open to the 
sky. Defenders atop the towers were shielded by corner parapets of sandstone 
perched on top of the granite walling. Rushing up the unobstructed entrance 
passage, assailants would have found themselves in an open court facing a pair 
of barred doors in a great timber façade, bombarded by missiles raining down 
from all sides. Attempts to flee this killing field down the entrance passage 
could have been thwarted by more attackers pressing in. Employment of bat-
tering rams and other siege equipment in such an enclosed space would have  
been almost impossible. Even if the doors were breached, troops would  
have rushed into the yet more restricted rear section closed by another set of 
double doors at the back and again subjected to bombardment from every 
5	 Summers and Summers, “A Preliminary Interpretation.”

side. This impressive and strong design was not, however, repeated at any of 
the other six city gates. These other gates were not necessarily weaker, and, al-
though each was different, the general concept of an enclosed killing field be-
fore the first set of doors may have been common to all. These considerations 
have implications over and above the tactical because, as will be shown below, 
these city gates had additional functions of great importance.
Approach to the Monumental Entrance was via a paved entranceway over-
looked by the tall twin towers rising above the glacis and providing vantage 
points over the open forecourt. The two stone platforms flanking the paved 
court in front of the first façade seem to have been provided with battlement-
like semi-iconic stone idols described below.
	
Cultic Installations at the Cappadocia Gate
The cultic installations are best discussed from front to back, in the order 
in which they would have been seen on entering the city. Thus what follows 
­describes the last, final, arrangements as they appear to have been immedi-
ately before destruction. This, significantly, is the reverse of the order in which 
they were set up.
The first cultic installation to be seen on entering the Cappadocia Gate was 
an aniconic granite stele, roughly shaped, its top polished by passing hands, 
set up inside the court by the north corner of the Middle Tower (Plate 9.2b and 
Figure 9.5). This stone could not be seen before entry into the court. Although 
a hole in the pavement behind the stele could possibly have been intentional, 
this was soon buried beneath an accumulation of silt. It may be that the hole 
was simply made when a few stones were removed from the paving to pack 
around the stele. Nothing was found in association with the stele, either on the 
paving or within the accumulation of clean silt that built up around it at the 
base of the Middle Tower.
In the gate court, a stepped monument supporting a semi-iconic idol of 
well-known Phrygian type was constructed in the corner formed by the front 
façade and the North Tower (Plate 9.2a and Figure 9.3).6 This monument faces 
directly into the court, rather than across it toward the entrance passage. It is 
impossible to decide whether this alignment had any particular significance. 
As the sculpted plinth at the north corner demonstrates (see below), this 
stepped monument could have been angled to face the top of the entrance

passage had that been desirable. Walling around the court would have attained 
a height of no less than eight meters, and perhaps ten or even twelve on the 
south side, thereby making any solar or astronomical alignment with the idol 
highly improbable. Nothing was found in association with this idol or with the 
steps on which it stood. It is probable that the idol was partially protected from 
the elements, because the blank face shows little indication of weathering 
while the lower portion of the torso has eroded. It is however possible that the 
torso was exposed for some time after the destruction, the preserved top being 
immediately under the modern surface when discovered.
Finally, in the enclosed rear section of the gate, set across the north corner at 
45 degrees so as to face the threshold in the front façade, was a large sandstone 
plinth on which an antithetical pair of couchant sphinxes was carved in deep 
relief (Plates 9.4–9.5, Figure 9.9). A rectangular mortise in the top contained 
the tenon of a statue carved from soft limestone, of which only a small por-
tion has survived, broken into many hundreds of fragments, many little larger 
than a thumbnail (Plates 9.6–9.7, Figures 9.10–9.12).7 The condition of the soft 
stone is deplorable, adding to the difficulties of finding joins. Nevertheless it 
has been possible to put together sufficient fragments to demonstrate that a 
life-sized female was represented. She was draped in pleated material, part of 
which was fastened with no less than three fibulae of Phrygian type placed one 
above the other. The bow of the middle fibula has sheared off, while represen-
tations of those above and below are incompletely preserved. Other sculpted 
fragments are very hard to interpret, but could possibly include parts of a polos 
(Figure 9.11a). The portion below the waist seems to have been covered with a 
pleated skirt (Figure 9.11c), as well, perhaps, as material hanging in folds (not 
illustrated here). One fragment represents loops of plaited material, perhaps 
rope (Plate 9.6b). Fragments covered with scales that were marked out with 
a cutting compass appear to have come from the legs and chest of flanking 
animals, very possibly lions (Plate 9.6a and Figure 9.12). A drilled dowel hole 
provides evidence that the sculpture may have been made from more than 
one piece of stone, or was mended (Figure 9.11b). Placement of this plinth and 
statue demanded attention from anyone entering through the double doors, 
but by the time of the destruction this sculpture had been confined to a room 
made by walling off the northeast side of this rear section and was thus hidden 
from view. Even before the making of this room, the tall walling of the North 
Tower and the high front façade would have kept the plinth and statue in near 
perpetual shade even when the gates were wide open. The crisply preserved

fine carving of the soft limestone statue fragments surely indicates that there 
was some kind of cover to keep off rain and snow. The beaten floor of this room 
was clean and, once again, there were no associated finds.
The erection of formal monuments would have been at the behest of, or 
certainly with the backing of, the ruling elite. At the front of the gateway, how-
ever, a class of evidence was found that perhaps relates to the common man. 
On two sandstone blocks among the granite in a corner of the glacis, were graf-
fiti that included representations of both semi-iconic idols and aniconic steles 
(Figure 9.8).8 These casual etchings make clear that whoever was loitering at 
the front of the gate employed the same cultic imagery as the central authority 
at whose instigation the monuments in the court would have been set up.
	
Monuments, Idols, Steles, and Statuary at the  
Monumental Entrance
The approach to the Monumental Entrance was overshadowed by the tall 
stone towers that rose above the supporting glacis. Only on passing these 
would the magnificence of the entrance become apparent. Platforms of ­silver 
granite, yellow sandstone, and soft white limestone, in bands divided by 
horizontal timber beams, were edged with large semi-iconic sandstone idols 
(Plate 9.9 and Figure 9.5). Set back from the front would have been freestand-
ing wooden columns bearing aloft stone capitals. At the top of the inclined 
court were great wooden doors in the center of what was very possibly a pedi-
mented façade. Whatever stood on the sandstone plinths to either side has not 
survived. Somewhere stood inscribed relief carving and sculpture in the round 
(Figure 9.13).9 Through the doors was a passage, with a room to either side, 
leading to a second set of doors. Beyond these the paved way continued to rise 
gently toward the imposing façade of the Audience Hall.
	
Entrance
It cannot be doubted that the central function of both entrances was in-
gress, as almost everything faced outward to greet arrivals. Exceptions at the 
8	 Summers, “Phrygian Expansion,” which includes an overzealous attempt to discern alpha-
betic characters. A definitive study of these graffiti is being made by Susanne Berndt.

­Monumental Entrance were a small aniconic stele and freestanding ­column, 
perhaps mirrored symmetrically in the unexcavated section of the rear ­passage, 
which faced those departing.10 While such a focus on arrival might seem obvi-
ous at first, that the entire emphasis at the Cappadocia Gate was on ­entrance 
rather than on departure demonstrates that in both design and in practice the

­function of this monumental gate was to control entry rather than exit, and 
thus that the cultic installations were associated with arrival rather than out-
ward journeys. At both entrances ample space was provided for assembly in a 
succession of large spaces or courts.
	
Courts
Both the Cappadocia Gate and the Monumental Entrance possess a large 
forecourt dominated and overlooked by towered defenses. An entrance pas-
sage and street, respectively, led to paved courts inclined upwards and large 
enough to accommodate a considerable throng of people. Two sets of doors 
gave onto further large formal courts, one immediately inside the city, the 
other before the Audience Hall. These spaces permitted assembly, contained 
cultic and ­other monuments that were intended to impress and protect. The 
paved court was not only devoid of discarded artifacts but also was covered 
with ­gradually accumulated silt devoid of any trace of activity. Inside the gate 
too, ­between the two façades, the paving was clean. Thus it seems that the 
gate was continually kept clean, but not so clean that silt, perhaps largely 
­derived from mud plaster coating the walls, was prevented from accumu-
lating. Stone ­paving was restricted to the line of passage, with a secondary 
­extension to the base of the stepped monument. Likewise at the Monumen-
tal ­Entrance the initial strip of paving led to the Audience Hall rather than 
providing space for assembly, and there too no accumulation of refuse was  
recovered.11
	
Implications
Contradictions appear in this evidence provided by these two entrances. On 
the one hand, the designs would seem to suggest the provision of spaces for 
gathering and activity, while, on the other, both the restricted paving and 
general cleanliness suggest that passage was the prime concern. It might be 
­concluded, therefore, that use of these public spaces was occasional. ­Arguably, 
the ­purposes of the cultic monuments were those of the state and, therefore, of 
the ruling elite. The images face outwards, protecting and ­perhaps ­intimidating,

reinforcing the power of the kingdom and the strength of its protective deities. 
Multiple, seemingly identical idols at the Monumental Entrance might be in-
dicative of a pantheon, but it is not impossible that they are multiple represen-
tations of a single deity. While the iconography is clearly Phrygian, the deity 
or deities need not be. It would not be altogether surprising if the Hittite cult 
of the weather god of Zippalanda, who resided on Mount Daha (Kerkenes), 
continued to be venerated in the Iron Age. There is, however, a gap of several 
hundred years to account for.12
	
Broader Implications
Anatolian monumental gateways constructed in the late seventh and first 
half of the sixth centuries b.c. are few. Earlier Neo-Hittite cities at ­Arslantepe 
near Malatya, Carchemish, and Zincirli, to select only those sites where new 
investigations of gates are underway, appear to be conceptually derived from 
Late Bronze Age traditions of the Hittite Empire and the Ancient Near East 
in ­general. By contrast, the origins of Phrygian architectural traditions are 
­probably to be sought to the west. In this respect it is of interest to make broad 
comparisons between the Cappadocia Gate and Monumental Entrance at 
Kerkenes with the Early and Middle Phrygian Citadel gates at Gordion, now 
dated to the ninth and eighth centuries b.c. respectively; the Midas Monu-
ment and other sixth century architectural façades carved into cliff faces in 
the Phrygian highlands; and also with the less well understood Lydian gate that 
pierces the colossal sixth-century defenses at Sardis.13
12	
Zippalanda is almost certainly to be identified with Kuşaklı Höyük and Mount Daha with 
Kerkenes; see Gurney, “Hittite Names.” Preliminary investigations by Stefania Mazzoni 
at Kuşaklı suggest a period of abandonment after the Late Bronze Age destruction; see 
­Mazzoni, D’Agostino, and Orsi, “Survey of the Archaeological Landscape.”

Digital simulations of the Early Phrygian gate at Gordion can be found at http://www 
.conlab.org/acl/gordion/gate.html. For plans of the Early and Middle Phrygian Citadel 
gates at Gordion see DeVries, “The Gordion Excavation Seasons of 1969–1973,” 371–406,

especially 73–76, and also Berndt-Ersöz, Phrygian Rock-Cut Shrines, particularly 232–234

fiercely contested: here we accept the new dating of the Destruction Level at Gordion 
to ca. 800 b.c. as set out in Rose and Darbyshire, New Chronology of Iron Age Gordion. 
Muscarella has argued vehemently in support of Young’s lower dating in “Date of the 
­Destruction of the Early Phrygian Period at Gordion,” “Iron Age Anatolia from Ionia to

given the differences in time, location, locally available materials, and precise 
functions. Furthermore, as pointed out earlier, none of the seven city gates 
at Kerkenes has the same plan. It is the conceptual similarities rather than 
­specific differences that are of concern here. At the time of the ­destruction at 
­Gordion, the gate comprised an inclined, slanted entrance passage ­between 
two ­massive towers leading to a gatehouse provided with two sets of double 
doors, presumably with a walkway above. This gatehouse, known as the Poly-
chrome House, was in fact part of an earlier defensive circuit that was incor-
porated into the more monumental system, parts of which were preserved to 
a height of ten meters. In the post-destruction rebuilding of this gate the en-
trance was divided into two halves, the front being open while the rear was 
enclosed by façades, each with double doors, thereby resembling the Cap-
padocia Gate more closely. In both the Destruction Level and the Middle 
­Phrygian period at Gordion, the citadel gate was thus flanked by large courts 
or rooms rather than by solid stone towers. In both phases the gate opened 
into an enclosed area that would seem to have been partially or entirely cultic. 
The pre-­destruction structures within this enclosure include Megaron 2.14 It 
is thus possible to perceive general similarities in design, construction mate-
rials, and association with cultic activities, together with the practicalities of 
defensive architecture and monumentality indicative of centralized, probably 
royal, power.15 In other ways, however, the Phrygian capital at Gordion appears 
to be quite different from Kerkenes: the lower town defenses at Gordion are of 
mudbrick, while the elite buildings on the citadel are protected by their own 
circuit of strong walls and gates. The Kerkenes citadel, by contrast, was a water-
less refuge of last resort.16
	
Sardis
Similarities between the Sardis gate and the gateways at Kerkenes might be fewer  
than the differences, but are nevertheless relevant to the broader ­overview 
14	
Megaron 2 stands out from other structures among the pre-destruction buildings in ­being 
constructed of porous stone. The graffiti carved on its walls (all on exposed faces and the 
correct way up) are reminiscent of the later Phrygian graffiti at the Cappadocia Gate.

of cultural relationships between Lydia and Phrygia from the later seventh 
­century b.c. to the Persian conquest.17 The most obvious differences are the 
colossal scale of the Sardis defenses and the use of true ashlar masonry.18 
The Sardis gate includes a trapezoidal court enclosed on three sides, from 
one corner of which a six-meter-wide entrance passage leads into the city. 
Neither the court nor the passage appears to have been roofed, and it has to 
be assumed that the doors lay somewhere beyond the inner end of the en-
trance passage associated in some way with the poorly preserved, secondary 
extension of the passage. From a military aspect, therefore, it seems that as-
sailants would have had to pass through the gently inclined entrance passage 
before storming the (unlocated) gates. From another point of view, an impres-
sive court lay in front of the entrance passage. This recalls the Cappadocia 
Gate court and the court in front of the entrance to the Palatial Complex at 
Kerkenes, both of which provided formal space for activities in front of the  
doors.
	
The Midas Monument
The extent to which the rock-cut façade of the Midas Monument, and ­other 
rock-cut façades in the highlands of Phrygia, resembled actual buildings 
has long been debated. The evidence from the Monumental Entrance to the 
­Palatial Complex at Kerkenes provides some evidence for the existence of built 
façades of size and proportions not dissimilar to those of the Midas Monument 
­(Tables 9.2–9.3). The Midas Monument is not of course a gateway through 
which humans passed, although many would see it as some kind of divine gate 
into the rock. It seems equally plausible that the rock-cut façade is a reasonably 
accurate representation of what a Phrygian temple or megaron building would 
have looked like in the time of Croesus, with pediment, architectural terracot-
tas, and massive timber frame.19 On the basis of these similarities, it may not 
be incorrect to postulate that the two façades in the Monumental ­Entrance 
(but not the Cappadocia Gate) at Kerkenes were provided with similar  
pediments.

The pseudo-ashlar in the so-called Ashlar Building at Kerkenes described by Stronach 
and Summers, “The Ashlar Building,” bears no comparison with Lydian masonry.

tural Terracottas.”

Conclusions
The Iron Age city on the Kerkenes Dağ, presumably the capital of Pteria, was 
founded in the second half of the seventh century b.c. and destroyed in the 
third quarter of the sixth. Because the city appears to have been culturally 
Phrygian in every respect, the conclusion that it was founded by newcomers 
from the west is plausible, if not inescapable.20 The purpose of this paper was, 
therefore, to seek conceptual parallels between Kerkenes and cities in central 
and western Anatolia that would not be incompatible with this hypothesis. 
The lamentable state of archaeological research on the Iron Age of Turkey is 
such that the only Phrygian city about which substantial knowledge has been 
gleaned is the capital, Gordion. Archaeologically, however, little is known of 
Gordion in the first half of the sixth century.21 Further west, Midas City, the 
ancient name of which has not been ascertained, was a ritual or cultic cen-
ter rather than an urban one; its rock-cut façades, along with much else, were 
most probably carved in the time of Lydian domination, i.e. in the time of King 
Croesus. Lydia came to subjugate whatever was left of Midas’s Phrygian king-
dom not long after the foundation of Kerkenes.22
On the Südburg at Boğazköy, the old Hittite capital of Hattusa which lay to 
the east of the Kızılırmak and some 50 kilometers to the north of Kerkenes, 
a gateway smaller in size but not generally dissimilar to that at Kerkenes was 
found to contain a life-sized statue of a goddess, presumably Matar, flanked 
by two musicians depicted at a much smaller scale. This well-known statue 
is very similar to the sculpture from the Cappadocia Gate in that it too was 
cut from very soft stone as well as being carved in the same general style.23 
It seems plausible to suggest that these two sculptures, from Kerkenes and 
Boğazköy, were products of the same sculptural school, if not works by the 
same sculptor. The Kerkenes piece displays much finer detail than would have 
been possible on the coarser stone selected at Boğazköy. Unprecedented use of 
a cutting compass for the depiction of scales to the east of the Kızılırmak has 
chronological as well as art historical implications that deserve more careful 
consideration than space here permits.
20	
There is no clear evidence from Boğazköy or Kaman Kalehöyük to support the notion of 
a significant Phrygian presence to the east of the Kızılırmak (the classical Halys River) 
before the foundation of Kerkenes. In our tentative view, the scant published evidence 
for Phrygian settlement at Alaca Höyük does not indicate Iron Age settlement earlier than 
the foundation of Kerkenes.

What, then, can we conclude? While Kerkenes was Phrygian in its mate-
rial culture, it was not a clone of Gordion. Closer architectural parallels are 
to be found in the Phrygian highlands. Doubtless some elements at Kerkenes 
displayed a more local character, such as the vertical wall faces rather than the 
battered walling seen at both Gordion and Sardis. Likewise the stone glacis 
is more reminiscent of Late Bronze Age Hattusa or the Iron Age defenses on 
the Südburg at the same site; but the cyclopean granite facing at Kerkenes has 
no close parallel anywhere. There are stone steles outside a gate at Troy, and 
colossal statues of kings in Neo-Hittite gates; but, Boğazköy apart, there is no 
parallel for either the fine carving of a statue in very soft stone that stood on 
the sphinx pedestal at Kerkenes, or for its angled position in a rear corner of 
the gateway. How, then, are we to interpret this? The Kerkenes gate provided 
settings for the erection of striking cultic images that were certainly intended 
for public display and presumably for associated performance. This imagery 
was doubtless intended to provide divine protection at the same time as re-
inforcing royal legitimacy. Could it perhaps be that in the same way that the 
visual statement created by the construction of seven kilometers of stone de-
fenses, visible from afar in every direction, exuded strength, domination, and 
permanence to a far greater degree than any Phrygian city west of the Halys, so 
too the public display of Phrygian cult was emphasised to an unusual degree. 
In this case the idols at Kerkenes could be seen as statements not just of power 
and sacred legitimacy, but also the symbols of newcomers from the west occu-
pying a foreign land and, in the process, making exceptional if not exaggerated 
display of their Phrygian identity.

Of Fibulae, Of Course!
Maya Vassileva
“Fibulae don’t lie!” This is what I have heard so often from Oscar Muscarella. 
His belief in the dating potential of fibulae (ancient safety pins) has always 
been very stimulating for me, as were our countless conversations on Gordion 
bronzes and fibulae in particular. His book, Phrygian Fibulae from Gordion, was 
my first guide and is still the major reference work for my research. For these 
reasons I wish to present some preliminary results of my study of the fibulae 
from the Gordion City Mound to Oscar for inclusion in his Festschrift. The fo-
cus of this paper will be on the examples excavated from the Destruction Level 
(dl).
	
Fibula Classification and Typology
To begin, I wish to argue in favor of the old classification of fibulae created by 
Christian Blinkenberg in 1926, used also by Muscarella, instead of the newer 
one proposed by Ertuğrul Caner.1 My first examples for the typology discus-
sion relate to the earliest Phrygian fibulae with a flat arc and simple moldings 
at both ends, usually one torus flanked by two abaci: types XII.7A and XII.7.
It is not just the crescent- or horseshoe-shape of the arc that differentiates 
type XII.7A from XII.7, taken by Caner to be the distinguishing factor.2 Often 
the arc of type XII.7A fibulae is narrower at both ends, while that of XII.7 is 
uniform in width throughout its length. The two types differ also in cross sec-
tion: XII.7A is rectangular in section, often with rounded corners, while XII.7 
is strictly rectangular in section. Moldings at the ends also differ. In XII.7A 
fibulae, the abaci are more often of the same width as the arc and proceed 
smoothly from it, unlike those of the XII.7 examples. The latter have more 
1	 Muscarella has already argued in detail in favor of Blinkenberg’s classification in Fibules 
grècques et orientales: Muscarella, “Review of Caner,” 198–200; I would only like to offer ad-
ditional support and re-confirm some of his observations.

clearly defined, protruding abaci, mostly flattened on the back side. The XII.7A 
type fibulae have cylindrical or conical spring ends.
Caner is correct that some transitional shapes are hard to classify.3 Among 
the fibulae from the Gordion City Mound, I can offer as examples three fibulae 
whose arcs are of equal width and rectangular in cross section; the first abacus 
on the arc does not protrude very much, and there is a conical spring at one 
end (B575, B1684b, and J131) (Plate 10.1). Similar to these is another example 
with an arc that is almost triangular in cross section: flat on the back and with 
a rounded ridge that runs in the middle of the front side (B1544, Caner’s type 
bii).4 I would rather classify these fibulae with XII.7A, as I do not think that a 
separate subtype should be created for fibulae that have all characteristics of 
XII.7A and differ only in the regular width of the arc or slight variations in the 
form of the cross section. I would prefer a combination of several criteria when 
defining types of fibulae and find unnecessary the creation of four subtypes 
out of the former two (from XII.7 and XII.7A: AII,1, AII,2, AIII,1, and AIII,2).5
Another interesting example of a fibula from Gordion that is hard to clas-
sify is B1988a, which is not listed in Caner’s work (Figure 10.1).6 Its moldings, a 
thick abacus and two discs at each end, more closely resemble those of type 
XII.5, but here the arc is rectangular in cross section and not oval or round. 
The spring end is conical like those of the XII.7A fibulae. Because of the shape 
of the arc and the preserved end I would rather classify this piece with type 
XII.7A, despite its obvious hybrid nature. Its mixing of different features can 
hardly be assigned to later developments, as this fibula originates from CC3 of 
the Destruction Level at Gordion.
Isolating separate subtypes with a double pin and lock-plate (fixed or 
­removable) (Caner’s si and sii) also seems to me inappropriate.7 Rather, these 
fibulae should be classified according to their arcs and moldings, and the double 
pins/decorative plates should be considered as embellishments of the respec-
tive types, probably for special occasions. Such fibulae are rare, found mainly 
in Tumulus mm at Gordion. Single examples are also known from Ankara, 
Boğazköy, Ephesos, Thasos, and Samos, in the context of special gifts or votives.8

tory; Caner admits the closeness of type aiii to AI,2.

Similar reasoning can be applied for examples of studded fibulae with two  
T-shaped bars (Caner’s AIV.2) or two transverse bars attached to the arc.9 
These can be isolated in separate types for the sake of classification, but most 
probably they were Greek developments of the XII.9 and XII.10 types, as most 
of them were found in Greek contexts (with one from Alişar).10 Their relation 
to belt buckles with one bar connecting both ends of the arc, found mainly 
in Greek sanctuaries, should be further investigated (see the example from 
Delphi11).
I would also suggest that belt buckles of fibula form should be grouped with 
the respective fibula types, instead of isolating these buckles in a separate 
group. They correspond mainly to type XII.14 fibulae; perhaps additional sub-
types marked with Latin letters should be added for buckles with more than 
five moldings on the arc, as with Muscarella’s XII.14A.12 Thus, B1685, found un-
der the floor of the South Cellar at Gordion, with 13 moldings13 could be clas-
sified as XII.14B.
Examples can be further extended to the other types of Phrygian/Anatolian 
fibulae. My point is that classification according to a single feature is ­senseless. 
Typology should, if possible, give an idea of fibulae development, both in terms

of meaning and manufacture. Caner’s typology is confusing, difficult to use,14 
and, in my opinion, does not really reflect the development of Phrygian/Ana-
tolian fibulae. Thus, I will be using Blinkenberg’s typology supplemented by a 
few subtypes introduced by Muscarella and R.M. Boehmer (marked by capital 
Latin and small Greek letters following the main subtypes). This is the system 
of classification followed to date in Gordion monograph publications.15
	
Fibulae from Early Phrygian Gordion
What follows is an overview of the context of the fibulae found in the Early 
Phrygian Citadel at Gordion. In terms of archaeological context, this type of 
metal dress fastener can be said to be associated with the costume of the dead 
and with grave offerings much more frequently than with evidence of its use in 
everyday life. The quantity of fibulae discovered in the earliest Phrygian tumuli 
outnumbers by far the examples from the Early Phrygian City Mound. It was 
Middle Phrygian Gordion that really saw common use of fibulae in daily life. 
The same can be said for bronze belts, which were placed in early Phrygian 
tombs but are found in the city only in post-Destruction Level contexts.16
Thirty-eight fibulae17—one of gold, one silver, one electrum, and the rest 
bronze—were excavated from the Destruction Level of the Gordion City 
Mound. On the whole, bronzes were not found in abundance in the megar-
ons, a number of which were empty at the time of the destruction.18 Only two 
yielded bronze objects, mainly vessels and furniture elements. One fibula and 
a small fragment of another were found in Megaron 4, while the remaining 
fibulae originated from the “industrial” area: the rooms of the Terrace Build-
ing (tb) and the corresponding Clay Cut (cc) structures. All three locations 
belong to the latest phase of the Early Phrygian Citadel.19
The industrial quarter comprises a multi-room building of eight ­megaron- 
type units (tb), and, facing it across a broad street, a similar structure of 
14	
This has already been expressed by Muscarella in his review of Caner’s book and in “Date 
of the Destruction,” 229, and “Again Gordion’s Early Phrygian Destruction Date,” 180.
15	
Caner’s classification has consistently been followed recently by Klebinder-Gauß, Bronze-
funde aus dem Artemision, 37–67. Keith DeVries, in his last article, also used it together 
with the older one: DeVries, “Date of the Destruction Level.”

which only four rooms were partially excavated (cc). Most of the units had 
­installations and equipment for food processing and textile production on a 
massive scale. Two units, TB-1 and TB-2, were special in lacking cooking instal-
lations—ovens and hearths—but having the greatest number of loom weights 
in their main halls,20 as well as the largest concentration of bronze objects in 
the building complex. Remains of at least four bronze cauldrons were found in 
TB-1. TB-2 produced extraordinary finds, and could be defined as a treasury.21 
Numerous luxury items, such as ivory horse trappings, a silver bird, bronze ves-
sels, bronze animal figurines, glass beads, and iron horse bits were discovered 
there.22 The only fibulae made of precious metals known from this early pe-
riod were also found in TB-2: the electrum, gold, and silver fibulae mentioned 
above (the latter two being miniature). However, more fibulae per room were 
discovered in TB-7 and TB-8, as well as in CC3. CC3 ranks second in the num-
ber of loom weights recovered (509).23
In view of the quantity of loom weights and spindle whorls excavated in 
these rooms, it is not surprising that fibulae were found together with or near 
these objects, along with knives and other iron tools likely used in the fabrica-
tion of textiles.24 Mere statistical frequency suggests that fibulae were associ-
ated here with textile production. It is worth noting that 75 loom weights and 
20 spindle whorls were discovered in Megaron 425 where the only complete 
fibula in the entire “royal” residential quarter was recovered.
While a number of these fibulae could have been worn by people working 
in the tb and cc buildings, certain examples obviously enjoyed special atten-
tion. These were wrapped in cloth and placed in clay pots: five fibulae were 
found in pots and at least two show evidence of cloth in the form of textile 
pseudomorphs. The only contents of one particular pot were two fibulae, one 
of which had been in contact with a textile. Another eight fibulae were dis-
covered near clay vessels, four with traces of cloth; three more such examples 
were found in other locations. A total of nine fibulae were probably wrapped 
in cloth (see Table 10.1).26

Some of the various prestige objects found in TB-2 also seem to have been 
wrapped in or covered with cloth. For example, most of the bronze animal 
figurines show traces of textile pseudomorphs and were probably carefully 
wrapped or stored with textiles in a bronze cauldron.27 In TB-3, a pair of 
bronze bracelets was wrapped in cloth and placed in a pot, together with a 
knife.28 Personal luxury items, such as a necklace of glass beads, were found 
near the bronze fibulae from TB-8.
It is worth noting that foreign imports account for approximately one third 
of the total number of fibulae discovered in the Early Phrygian Citadel (14 in 
total). Eight are of the so-called “leech” type (or boat-like fibulae),29 which 
were western imports at Gordion, either from Aegean or mainland Greece. 
­Examples of this type appear also in some of the Gordion tumuli and in later 
levels of the City Mound, and thus enjoyed a longer use.30 Three fibulae are 
Near Eastern in origin with a triangular bow; a fourth, fragmentary example 
had a wire-wrapped arc, rectangular in cross section, with no moldings at the 
spring end.31 Finally, two arched fibulae (Bogenfibeln), each with a bow that is 
round in section and a torus with two discs at each end, probably also origi-
nated from the Aegean world.32
One “leech” fibula enjoyed special treatment, being placed in a pot along 
with an unusual oval clay plaque (MC303).33 The other foreign fibulae were 
found together with Phrygian examples (mostly type XII.7A). However, one 
arched fibula bears traces of textile pseudomorphs thus suggesting that the 
entire clump of four, two of which are of the XII.7A type, may possibly have 
been covered with cloth. In general, the foreign pieces do not display evidence 
of special consideration.
This evidence suggests that many of the fibulae discovered in the Early 
Phrygian Citadel were somehow connected to textiles and textile produc-
tion. Except for one example (and one small fragment) from Megaron 4, all 
the pre-Destruction Level and Destruction Level fibulae were discovered in 
the “industrial” area. Most came from the main halls of the tb and cc mega-
ron units; in TB-7 and TB-8, fibulae were found in both the main rooms and

­anterooms.34 Some were carefully wrapped in fabric and placed in clay vessels. 
A number of fibulae appear to have been kept together with weaver’s kits. It 
has been suggested that examples found in post holes had initially hung from 
the wooden posts. Some fibulae might have been worn by the people work-
ing and residing in the Terrace Building and cc rooms (those found near the 
grinding stones?).35 Those kept in jars might have been stored as accessories 
for special clothes when ready. In the case of the imported fibulae, one can en-
vision either foreign workers or distant customers for the textiles and clothing.
	
Fibulae, Belts, and the Phrygian Goddess
As indicated above, fibulae and bronze belts with fibula-type buckles seem 
to have been valued more as grave offerings and adornments for the dead in 
early Gordion than as accessories of daily use. Thus, they may have held spe-
cial significance for Phrygian cult and burial rites. In a number of works and 
in her recent book Elizabeth Simpson has demonstrated a close relationship 
between the decorative patterns on the wooden furniture from Gordion and 
those on monumental Phrygian rock-cut façades, showing that the inlaid fur-
niture was associated with the cult of Phrygian Matar.36 The designs can also 
be compared to those on bronze belts as well as surviving fragments of Phry-
gian textiles.37 Besides conveying an elite status, fibulae and bronze belts were 
themselves probably connected with the cult of Matar.38 The arcs of Phrygian 
fibulae and belt clasps recall similar forms used as design elements in furniture 
and other objects from Gordion.
One of the furniture elements associated with the iconography of Matar 
is the so-called “scroll foot,” found on the wooden tables and serving stands 
from Gordion, and interpreted as an abstract representation of a lion’s paw.39 
The scroll-like paws of a small wooden lion sculpture from Tumulus P and of 
two stone lions from the Gordion City Mound relate closely to the feet on the

furniture, validating this interpretation.40 Similar paw-like elements can also 
be distinguished on an inlaid wooden stool from Tumulus P.41 Although lions 
were not always depicted with Matar, they appear prominently as guardian 
figures of the goddess in several rock monuments, notably Arslan Kaya in the 
Phrygian highlands. And, as Simpson has shown, they were often present on 
an abstract level in cult-related objects. As is now recognized, Phrygian art 
is ­notable for its highly abstracted imagery and principles of design. Thus, I 
would cautiously suggest that Phrygian fibulae themselves, with their scroll-
like form, may allude to a lion’s paw in abstract form, associating them with 
the iconography of Matar.
I would add that parts of the stylized handles and rear leg struts of the in-
laid table from Tumulus mm42 also evoke the shape of a Phrygian fibula arc. 
These wooden elements were inlaid with patterns of triangles and lozenges, 
motifs that sometimes appear incised on bronze fibulae. The upper sections 
of the legs of the same piece of furniture take the form of a biconical abacus 
between two discs,43 one of the most common combinations of moldings on 
Phrygian fibulae. Several pieces of furniture from Gordion were ornamented 
with bronze studs, including the stool from Tumulus P; studded semicircu-
lar elements of this tool connect the furniture in yet another way to Phrygian 
fibulae—­notably the type XII.9 fibula, which features bronze studs (and one 
could point to examples of oversized fibulae, e.g. B1520, which is 17 cm long).
One more element of Phrygian fibulae could be associated with the iconog-
raphy of the goddess: the catch-end. Three stone reliefs depicting Matar, found 
at Gordion and in Ankara, show her left hand grasping firmly the legs of a bird 
of prey.44 Birds, especially raptors, are the animals most often featured in the 
incised drawings from the Gordion City Mound.45 These birds had a special 
significance for the goddess’s cult, although their symbolism remains elusive. 
Most of the catch-ends of Phrygian fibulae resemble a raptor’s claw, with three 
front toes bent (to hold the pin), and two outstretched ones at both sides. Thus,

the shape of the Phrygian bronze safety pin could be considered a stylized 
combination of elements from the two animals most often accompanying the 
Phrygian goddess: the scroll-foot shape of the arc implying a lion’s paw, and the 
catch-end standing for the spurs and talons of a predatory bird.
	
Dating the Fibulae from the City Mound at Gordion
My final point in this paper relates to the dating potential of the bronze fibulae 
from the City Mound in view of the new dating of the Destruction Level. The 
date of the destruction has now been moved back to the late ninth century 
b.c., based on C-14 dates for seeds excavated from the Terrace Building.46 As 
the number of foreign fibulae in the Early Phrygian Citadel is significant, I have 
attempted to assess their value for the dating of the Destruction Level.
The arched fibulae mentioned above, B1988c and B1988d (Figure 10.2), do 
not find exact parallels, but their bows and catch-ends (such as preserved) 
suggest Aegean inspiration.47 Their prototypes can be sought among the 
arched fibulae of Caner’s type IId, with a slightly swollen bow at the middle 
46	
This date is currently accepted by most of the members of the Gordion team: Rose and 
Darbyshire, The New Chronology of Iron Age Gordion; and see below. Muscarella argues for 
a date in the late eighth century b.c., based on analysis of the artifacts recovered from the 
dl: Muscarella, “Date of the Destruction” and “Again Gordion’s Early Phrygian Destruc-
tion Date.”

and two moldings at the ends, often asymmetrically set.48 These are dated to  
ca. ­1125–950 b.c., with all examples coming from the Carian coast. The asym-
metrical types from the Aegean and Near East have long, arm-shaped catch-
ends, while the Phrygian catch-end, where preserved (B1988d), follows directly 
from the molding. For the two Phrygian fibulae cited here, both catch-ends 
are broken, so the exact form of their finials is unknown. Parallels can be cited 
from the Kerameikos (of pg date),49 Lefkandi (of mpg/lpg date),50 Cyprus,51 
and Crete,52 as well as from Alişar, Zincirli, Megiddo, and Hama.53
Recently two examples of arched fibulae were reported from stratum IIa 
at Kaman-Kalehöyük, which provide close parallels for the Gordion pieces.54 
Unfortunately, the strata of this site cannot be dated particularly precisely and 
cannot offer much insight into the Gordion finds in this respect.55
Arched fibulae existed in the Mediterranean from Sub-Mycenaean times, 
becoming more popular in the lpg period, and continuing into the ­Archaic 
period as well. Some scholars consider their origins to be in the Greek 
­islands.56 Recently, claims for the Cypriot origin of asymmetrical fibulae have 
been reasserted.57 It is probably better to assume varied contacts within the 
Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean area (as accepted by Giesen),58 than 
to attempt to trace the exact origin of this type of fibula. It is possible that the 
earlier ­Sub-Mycenaean arched fibulae, both asymmetrical and symmetrical 
with wide arcs, contributed to the appearance of the wide-arched fibulae in 
the Near East, ca. 900 b.c.59 It should be noted that some of the possible paral-
lels mentioned above do not come from well dated strata and thus cannot offer 
secure chronological anchors. Most of the more reliably dated examples point

to the eighth century b.c.60 No other arched fibulae were found at Gordion, 
either in the tumuli or in the later levels of the City Mound.
While the arched fibula type apparently originated in the Aegean, the Gor-
dion examples may not have been imported directly from this source. The 
possibility cannot be excluded that, once the type was introduced to the East, 
fibulae were transmitted within the region, moving between various Anatolian 
and Near Eastern sites.
As the arched fibula does not occur in any later level of the City Mound, one 
can suggest that the evidence shows a decline in its use (or possibly its spo-
radic appearance) at Gordion. This observation, together with the early ­history 
of these fibulae in the Aegean, prompts a cautious hypothesis of an earlier 
date for the Gordion arched fibulae, perhaps the ninth century b.c. Only new 
evidence drawn from more securely dated parallels can yield a more definitive 
conclusion.
A second, larger group of foreign fibulae at Gordion comprises the so-called 
“leech” fibulae: B1936 from TB-7, B1977c and B2006 from CC3, B673 from CC2, 
and B1295a–d from TB-3 (Figure 10.3, Plate 10.2). Only the swollen “leech” bow 
with tapering ends, round in section, is preserved in most cases. Two examples 
(B673 and B2006) show fragments of trapezoidal or triangular catch-plates. 
One or two molded rings (on B1295a and B1295c, and possibly on B673 and 
B2006) or several milled rings (B1295b and B1936) occur at each end.
Four leech fibulae were discovered in Gordion tumuli as well. Probably the 
best-preserved example is one of two miniature fibulae found in Tumulus C 
(B13a). These originate from “Stone Complex 4,” a pre-tumulus inhumation 
burial, originally considered by the excavator to be the main one.61 This burial 
is earlier than the tumulus itself, and the fibulae might therefore be of dl or 
pre-dl date.62 Two more leech fibulae were discovered in the tomb chamber 
of Tumulus G (B11, B17),63 which is considered to be among the earliest Phry-
gian burials at the site. In addition, one leech fibula was found in the mantle of 
Tumulus B (B29) and is possibly earlier than the tumulus itself, which is dated 
to ca. 630 b.c.64

These leech fibulae fall within Efi Sapouna-Sakellarakis’s type iv, especially 
IVd, and within Kilian’s types D Ia and b.65 Kilian considers these to be Thes-
salian, because of the large number of similar examples found at Pherai, and 
dates them to the eighth or seventh century b.c.66 Whatever their exact ori-
gin, these fibulae were western imports (either Aegean or mainland Greek) at 
Gordion.
As comparanda, examples from Lefkandi of Sub-Protogeometric date can 
also be cited (ca. 850–750 b.c.).67 Unlike the previous group of arched fibulae, 
which are found only in the Destruction Level at Gordion, at least two exam-
ples of leech fibulae have been recovered from post-dl contexts at Gordion 
(B534 and B606).68 If these two fibulae can be assigned to later contexts, and 
were not from disturbed earlier layers, they can offer evidence for a longer use 
of this type. Most of the leech fibula parallels date from the eighth century 
b.c., although the Lefkandi comparanda might allow for an earlier date for the 
Gordion dl examples.
The third group of imported fibulae from the Destruction Level of the 
Gordion City Mound consists of three Near Eastern fibulae: B1778, B1779, and 
B1752, all from TB-8 (Figure 10.4, Plate 10.3). These have approximately triangu-
lar-shaped bows, swollen in the middle, and two biconical moldings between 
two or more discs at each end. The swellings in the middle of the bow resemble 
those of the leech fibulae, but are only slightly flattened on top and bottom. 
Caner assigned them to the group of Cypriot and Oriental fibulae, type v.69 
Two fibulae from Alişar may possibly provide parallels for the slightly swollen 
bow with biconical beads at both ends.70 These fall within Friedhelm Pedde’s 
C1.2 group, dated to the eighth or seventh century b.c.71 While Caner assumes 
this type to be an import from Alişar,72 classification with the Near Eastern 
fibulae seems more plausible.

Similar fibulae occurred in other levels of the City Mound and in tumulus buri-
als at Gordion: B5 (Tumulus B),73 B1777 (WCW-2), B1595 (TrQ, clay), and B1149 
(Küçük Höyük).74 Two pieces (B1861, B1881) were found in a fourth century b.c. 
context (PPB-7 and PPB-SE3).75 The swellings on their bows are smaller and 
more spherical; they resemble more closely the Near Eastern triangular fibu-
lae. More examples of classical Near Eastern triangular fibulae (“knee-bow” or 
“elbow” fibulae) are recorded from later contexts in the ­Gordion City Mound 
(B1191, B1201, and B1878). These seem to have enjoyed a wider distribution and 
longer use.
Despite my initial expectations, the foreign, imported fibulae at Gordion 
cannot provide a decisive chronological framework for the Destruction Level, 
since the comparanda fall within a rather wide range, although centering on 
the eighth century b.c. Parallels for the arched and leech fibulae may offer the 
possibility of support for an earlier dating of the Gordion dl (i.e. ninth century 
b.c.), if combined with other evidence. They may also indicate earlier contacts 
with the Aegean than previously thought.76 Intermediate Anatolian sources 
(coastal Anatolia or North Syria) for Aegean influence or contacts cannot be 
ruled out.
Regarding the chronology of Phrygian fibulae, most scholars agree that 
Blinkenberg’s type XII.7A is the earliest. The spread and use of these fibulae 
seem to be short-lived: they did not outlast by much the rebuilding of the 
­Middle Phrygian Citadel, and only one example was found in the clay that over-
lay the Early Phrygian Destruction Level (see Table 10.2). Most of the various 
Phrygian fibula types known from later contexts and other locations are miss-
ing from the dl city repertoire.77 The only exceptions are two fibulae (B1764, 
B1454) and a small fibula fragment (B1596) of types that are abundant in later 
contexts (XII.14 and XII.9). These fibulae have been noted in terms of the con-
troversy over the dating of the Destruction Level. A discussion in writing be-
tween Keith DeVries and Oscar Muscarella examined the find spot and context 
of the XII.9 type fibula (B1454) as well as its chronological value.78 Regarding 
the other two examples, B1764 is an earlier form of the type XII.14 fibula, in my

a	 Oscar Muscarella has long urged me to investigate the fibulae found in the clay level. A 
careful check of the Gordion Field Books allows me to supplement the number of fibulae 
already noted by Muscarella, “Date of the Destruction,” 182. These are presented here in 
Table 10.2. On the other hand, several clay contexts seem unclear or dubious, and I did not 
include these fibulae in the list: B1337, XII.9; B1666, XII.14 and B1480, XII.2. These finds, 
however, should be used with caution, as it has been suggested that half a century or so 
might be supposed for the remodeling of the city, or some parts of it: Sams, “Artifacts,” 66.

does the small fibula fragment (B1596), which could be type XII.13 or XII.14.80 
Although fibulae with bows that are round in section are not in evidence in 
the Early Phrygian city, except for these two examples, their early attestation 
would not be surprising, as six XII.13 type fibulae were found in Tumulus W, 
the earliest Gordion tumulus.81 Other comparable pieces are known from the 
dl, as ­indicated by fragments of a fibula “with spools” found together with 
B1587 (wire-wrapped arc) in TB-7 but not catalogued because of its poor state 
of preservation.82 Thus, we may assume the early use of fibulae with arcs that 
are round in section, and type XII.14 fibulae in particular, in the Early Phrygian 
city.
The XII.9 fibula (B1454) comes from Megaron 4, which suffered later distur-
bances in addition to being the latest structure built before the destruction of 
the Early Phrygian Citadel.83 The possibility that it is an intrusion cannot be 
ruled out in view of the floating coarse ware sherds reported for its context.84 
Considering its controversial recording,85 this fibula should probably be dis-
counted as a piece of evidence in the argument.
While the exact sequence of the Gordion tumuli is still debated, one cannot 
fail to notice that fibulae of types XII.9 and XII.14 appear in tumuli k-iii, k-iv, 
mm, and S1. Both types are found in the clay above the Destruction Level and 
in the subsequent Middle Phrygian city, where XII.14 fibulae prevail in number 
(Table 10.2). If we accept the early appearance of type XII.14 fibulae in dl con-
texts, we can speculate further about the place of the tumuli that yielded such 
fibulae in the sequence.
The hotly contested evidence of the Phrygian fibulae cannot, unfortunately, 
give a reliable chronological anchor for the Early Phrygian Citadel at Gordion 
80	
If we follow the context as already published, this fibula fragment should be of pre-dl 
date since it originates from the Megaron 4 terrace fill: Sams, Early Phrygian Pottery, 16;

unless combined with analyses of other artifacts.86 Analogies with those found 
in the Phrygian tumuli (whose sequence is still debated)87 would again offer 
only a relative chronological determination and not a certain date. Compari-
sons between types of fibulae occurring in the Citadel and in the tumuli must 
take into account the differing motivations regarding the placement and de-
position of these fibulae in their various contexts. Phrygian fibulae and belts 
found in the East Greek sanctuaries and in sites on the Greek mainland can-
not help here, as the Greeks imported and imitated these Phrygian objects, 
but in their developed and therefore later forms.88 The lack of related, well-
stratified, early first millennium b.c. sites in Anatolia makes the effort to estab-
lish a precise chronology of the Early Phrygian period at Gordion even more 
difficult. Nonetheless, an examination of the fibulae from the Destruction 
Level has clarified aspects of the controversy and produced some interesting  
results.

Artifacts Belonging to Queen Qaquli and  
Mr. Tigursagga from an Elaborately Decorated 
Quarter of the Ayanis Fortress
Altan Çilingiroğlu
Since 1989, excavations at the Urartian Ayanis Fortress have unearthed monu-
mental structures, storage areas, pillared halls, fortification walls, and hundreds 
of artifacts, offering substantial information on Urartian art and architecture 
from the seventh century b.c.1 These findings not only demonstrate the signifi-
cance of the city founded in front of Mount Süphan (“Rusahinili Eiduru-kai” in 
Urartian) by Rusa son of Argishti (Rusa ii) in 673/2 b.c., but they also testify 
to the high level of artistic achievement reached during the king’s reign. The 
type of architecture, inscribed weapons, red polished pottery, and other finely 
crafted objects from Ayanis are usually associated with fortresses that have a 
royal function.2
Next to the west wall of the Temple Area (Area vi), is a building complex 
(Area xi) featuring several interconnected spaces (Plates 11.1–11.2). Within Area 
xi, in a section formed by nine separate rooms, a number of interesting finds 
were discovered. Mostly related to daily activities such as food preparation and 
cooking, finds from this area included hearths, pottery, grinding stones, vessels 
for beer production, baskets full of millet, and various other items such as tools 
and women’s jewelry. The architectural design and the nature of the artifacts 
led us to call this section a “Domestic Quarter,”3 which functioned as a service 
area for high-ranking individuals in the fortress.
At the south of the Domestic Quarter, a mud-brick wall 1.7 m thick runs in 
the east–west direction and marks the southern extent of this section. No door 
opening was discovered in this wall, and all the rooms constructed to the south 
of the wall are thus isolated from those of the Domestic Quarter. In this south-
ern part of Area xi are located Rooms 10–14. Room 10 (9.3 m × 3.15 m), with an

east–west orientation, opens onto Room 11 through a door opening of 70 cm. 
Another doorway leads from Room 10 to Room 12 to the south. Beneath Room 
12 were constructed two storage areas (Rooms 13–14) built on bedrock (−7.13/ 
−7.76 m). These storage areas, which are separated by a 2.7 m thick mud-brick 
wall, contained thousands of ceramic sherds. The room at the east (Room 13) 
had contained hundreds of red polished jugs (Plate 11.3), while the room at the 
west (Room 14) held medium-sized buff- and cream-colored storage jars.
A golden artifact discovered in Room 11 (−5.15 m) and a cornelian bead from 
Room 12 (−5.43 m) constitute the main topic of this contribution. In Room 12 
near the cornelian bead were found bronze nails and a bronze object in the 
shape of a fist (Plate 11.4), which might have served as a holder for a candle or 
torch.
The gold artifact (inv. no. AY.50.08), which measures 20.6 cm in length and 
1.35 cm in diameter, was most probably a fan handle (Figure 11.1, Plates 11.5–11.6).  
It weighs approximately 60 gm, including the burnt wooden remains inside 
it. The item is cylindrical and open on one end; the opposite end is decorated

with a rosette motif with 12 petals. The entire surface of the fan handle is 
decorated with an 18-layer sacred tree motif, comprised of tendrils, buds, and 
pomegranates chased into the surface. The branches of the sacred tree grow 
out of four different roots, stretching out and covering the whole surface. A 
frieze with a guilloche pattern is found at either end of the cylinder.
Just below the guilloche band at the top of the sacred tree pattern, a cunei-
form inscription is inscribed (Plate 11.6), reading as follows:4
MUNUS QAQULİ MUNUS.LUGAL TANAASI
(Object made for Qaquli, Queen)
This inscription is exceptional, as names of women are hardly ever men-
tioned in Urartian written sources. The one and only woman whose name was 
­previously known to us is Tariria, identified as King Menua’s wife or daughter.5 
The name “Qaquli” at Ayanis emerges as the second female name from Urartu. 
Qaquli is evidently not just one of the wives of the king, she is the Queen of 
Urartu.6 The function of the object on which Qaquli’s name is inscribed can 
be disputed. It is observed that there was a wooden core inside the gold cas-
ing. In Urartian depictions and written sources there is not much evidence to 
help clarify the issue. However, a bronze figure of a eunuch from Toprakkale, 
another fortress built by Rusa ii, shows an object that may relate to the Ayanis 
golden artifact.7 The figure holds what is apparently a fan, with a cylindrical 
handle and what seem to be feathers extending out from the end. Golden fans 
are mentioned in the records that list the booty taken from the Urartian city of 
Ardini (Musasir) in 714 b.c. when it was sacked by the Assyrian king Sargon ii.8
The cornelian bead was discovered in Room 12 of Area xi. The exact find 
spot is located 5.15 m below the summit of the fortress (1,866.87 m above sea 
level) and 70 cm south of the door opening connecting Room 12 and Room 10. 
The bead is perforated lengthwise and is brown at the ends, with a white band 
running across the center. Inscribed on the bead are two lines of cuneiform 
inscription, measuring 2 cm in length and 1.2 cm wide (Figure 11.2, Plate 11.7).

line 2: A  MAN  sha  D.Shu (Marduk) D.UTU (Shamash) 
The inscription indicates a man named Tigursagga, whose gods are Marduk 
and Shamash. It is uncertain what sort of title Mr. Tigursagga had—it remains 
unclear whether he was a priest, statesman, artist, or merchant. Therefore, it 
is difficult to explain how and why this bead came to be used at Ayanis. It is 
possible that Tigursagga was a person of high rank visiting the city. The fact 
that the inscription is written in the Neo-Babylonian language does not neces-
sarily mean that it dates to 625 b.c., when the Neo-Babylonian kingdom was 
founded,10 or later. It is known that this language was already in use during the 
Neo-Assyrian period in the seventh century b.c. It is plausible that the bead 
was brought to the land of Urartu either from Assyria or Babylonia.
As indicated, the part of Area xi (Rooms 11 and 12) where the inscribed bead 
and golden fan handle were found is not connected to the rooms of the Domes-
tic Quarter. In Room 12 there are heavily destroyed fragments of at least two 
andesite pillars. It seems possible that additional pillars may be found as the 
excavations extend to the south. It has been noted that Room 12 is connected 
to Room 10 by a doorway. Room 10 has the form of a long, narrow corridor (9.3

m × 3.15 m); found adjacent to the north wall of this room were many bronze 
rosettes covered with gold foil (Plate 11.8), a gold sun-disk, a bulla of Rusa ii, 
and a bronze lamp. On the floor in the northwest corner was a construction 
made of chalkstone with a depression and central hole, which appears to have 
been an altar (Plate 11.9). Burnt wooden and stone mosaic fragments found in 
relation to the altar suggest that, as shown on some seals and sealings of Ura-
rtu, a sacred tree—here constructed of wood and stone—was placed inside  
the central hole of the chalkstone object.11 The archaeological finds from Room 
10 demonstrate that this corridor was elaborately decorated and suggest that 
religious ceremonies were held near a sacred tree located at the northwest 
corner. The doorway leading from Room 10 into Room 11 is heavily damaged. 
There are, however, no other entrances leading to Room 11 except this doorway. 
Inside Room 11, several golden rosettes and a bulla of Rusa ii with griffin and 
sacred tree motifs were discovered.
The finds in Rooms 10, 11, and 12 indicate the special character of these 
rooms within the larger Area xi. These include the objects from Room 10 (35 
gold-plated rosettes with pins at the back, pieces of gold foil, the gold sun-disk, 
a bronze lamp, and fragments of decorative wall paintings) along with the altar 
and associated stone mosaic pieces and burned wood. In Room 12 were found 
the inscribed bead and fist-shaped bronze torch holder. The golden fan handle 
belonging to Queen Qaquli from Room 11 further underlines the importance of 
these elaborately outfitted rooms.
The entrance to this special quarter was provided by an andesite-pillared 
gate (Room 12). Beside the entrance gate a fist-shaped torch holder may have 
been set into the wall to illuminate the area. The corridor, or Room 10, was 
lavishly appointed with golden rosettes and other gold decorations, wall paint-
ings, and stone mosaics. The altar and sacred tree in the corner suggest that rit-
ual performances were held at this spot. Room 11, reached only through Room 
10, belonged most probably to Queen Qaquli. In this room a ritual ceremony 
related to fertility must have been held. In what form and how often these cer-
emonies were performed is not clear.
It is significant that a bead with Neo-Babylonian script was found in Room 
12. If we presume that Tigursagga was a high-ranking official who visited the 
Ayanis Fortress, then one can suggest that ceremonies were held when sig-
nificant persons visited the king. Although it remains unclear what sort of 
ceremony was held in Rooms 10 and 11, the presence of King Rusa ii and 
Queen Qaquli is suggested by bullae and the gold fan handle. Other archaeo-
logical evidence from Ayanis Fortress showed that various ceremonies12 were

held for the god Haldi in different quarters of the site.13 Taken with the many 
inscribed objects belonging to King Rusa, a personal item of Queen Qaquli 
implies that both the king and the queen either resided at Rusahinili Eiduru-
kai (Ayanis) at certain times of the year or visited the fortress for religious 
observances.14

A Fragment of a Ram’s Head Rhyton Found at 
Qalatgah, Iran
Stephan Kroll
When Oscar Muscarella discovered the Urartian site of Qalatgah in 1968, Wol-
fram Kleiss had already dug his first trial trenches at Bastam, discovered the 
year before.1 It was the start of ten incredible years of research on the ancient 
kingdom of Urartu in northwest Iran. When the Islamic Revolution brought 
most research in Iran to a halt in 1979, about one hundred Urartian settlements 
and fortresses had been discovered, mapped, surveyed, and published in pho-
tos and in plans. The more our knowledge grew, the more it became evident 
in which regions the greatest and most important places were to be found. 
­Qalatgah was one of the most prominent Urartian sites in Iran (Plate 12.1), 
­rivaled only by the likes of Ismail Agha Qaleh, Verahram, Livar, Seqindel and 
Bastam.2
As Oscar had discovered Qalatgah, it was Oscar’s site. And so the sad little 
story of Qalatgah began. When Kleiss visited the site, he made a small sketch 
plan only; he expected that Oscar would excavate there in the following years 
and produce a good map. It is tragic that Kleiss, who drew plans of all major 
Urartian fortresses in Iran, omitted Qalatgah as an act of courtesy to Oscar. 
Later, the Austrian and Italian expeditions considered working at Qalatgah, 
but they abstained, as it was Oscar’s site. In any case, the Italian expedition 
published a more informative sketch plan than Kleiss had made.3 In fact, all 
the teams working in northwest Iran visited the site from time to time and col-
lected surface material, as Oscar had done after he had first discovered it. The 
German Bastam expedition visited Qalatgah several times up until 1978. I was 
a member of this team, and we collected surface finds there, which were stored 
at the German Archaeological Institute in Tehran. Today Qalatgah is the only 
major Urartian site in Iran for which a detailed plan is lacking.
Years later I returned to the German Archaeological Institute in Tehran 
with the intention of working on the surveys the institute had carried out in

­northwest Iran in the 1960s and 70s. I washed the sherds and made photos and 
drawings. Coming upon our collections from Qalatgah, I found one sherd, en-
crusted with dirt and salt, that seemed to be part of a ring base. When I lifted 
the sherd out of the rinse, it was no longer a part of a ring base: instead it was 
a fragment of an animal-headed cup, from the area around the left eye. What 
had looked like a ring base was actually the horn of a ram, arching over the eye 
(Plate 12.2).
The sherd is of light, buff color, well fired, smoothed and partly burnished, 
showing marks of a potter’s wheel on the inside. The paste is fine, with visible 
white grits. The sherd measures 7.5 cm from left to right and 5 cm vertically, 
with an average thickness of 7 mm. The sherd is unique through an additional 
feature. After the pupil of the eye was applied, a stamp seal was impressed on 
the pupil, depicting a galloping horse and a crescent above (Plate 12.3). The fig-
ure of the horse is carefully executed: one can see an eye, an ear, the mane, and 
a short tail. In the same way, the sherd itself is well made. The eyebrow and the 
pupil are raised, and the horn is gracefully curved and elaborately decorated 
with fine incised strokes. The fleece of the ram is indicated by wedge-shaped 
indentations (Plate 12.2).
As it was a stray find on the surface of an ancient site, the date of this sherd 
is open to debate. Qalatgah itself is an Urartian site, built at the end of the 
ninth century b.c.e. It was probably occupied until the end of the kingdom of 
Urartu in the middle of the 7th century b.c.e.4 Thus the animal sherd could 
be Urartian. But there are also surface finds of triangle ware sherds, found by 
Oscar during his visits to the site; these finds show that there was a later occu-
pation of Qalatgah in the late Achaemenid period. So the animal sherd could 
also date to a later period. To the best of my knowledge I would relate the ware 
of the sherd to the fine fabric of “Ziwiye ware,” as defined by Young.5
Literature on animal vessels in Iran is not abundant. In 1988 Oscar Mus-
carella presented a brief resume on animal-headed vessels, publishing an 
animal cup from Hasanlu IVb.6 In 2000 John Curtis published an overview of 
­animal-headed drinking cups in the late Assyrian period, including finds from 
Iran.7 Curtis noted: “It is immediately apparent that … there is a considerable 
diversity of shape and style, so much so that it is difficult to group them to-
gether.” So it is not surprising there is no direct comparison for our fragment. 
Muscarella as well as Curtis agreed that animal-headed vessels are rare in Iran.

A Fragment of a Ram’s Head Rhyton Found at Qalatgah, Iran
Cups found in Hasanlu period IVb have no direct parallel to the sherd pre-
sented here. In the same way, the gazelle-headed cup from Urartian Bastam is 
a singular piece, not related to our sherd or the Hasanlu finds.8 In 1988 Oscar 
noted regarding the vessel from Bastam that “Tierkopfgefässe were not nor-
mally in use in that culture.”9
But the impression of a stamp seal on the pupil yields much more informa-
tion. The horse, or better, the galloping horse, is, like the crescent (and the 
galloping bull with crescent10), a frequent motif in Urartian glyptic, though 
often only executed in linear style.11 The impression from Qalatgah exhibits 
a modeled style, rare in Urartian glyptic. The best comparison for the horse 
comes from Norşun Tepe, where a similarly executed horse on a stamp seal 
was found.12
The craftsmanship of the cup alone does not give a clue as to a certain date. 
However, the seal impression points to a date within the Urartian period. 
­Together with the finds Oscar published from Qalatgah,13 this tiny fragment of 
an animal drinking vessel underlines the importance of the site. In this respect 
the question of what the ancient name of the site could have been is not im-
portant. Oscar has always argued that Qalatgah was Ulhu, a rich Urartian city 
mentioned by the Assyrian king Sargon ii.14 Other researchers, however, like 
Reade, Lanfranchi, Zimansky, Fuchs, and this author prefer the idea that Qalat-
gah should be identified with the Urartian city of Wishe/Wajis.15 In celebration 
of Oscar’s career, let us remember what a great site he discovered. One hopes 
that Qalatgah will one day be excavated with the same care Oscar would have 
shown if he had had the chance to work there.

Toul-E Gilan and the Urartian Empire
D.T. Potts
	
Introduction
In 2002 an Iranian archaeological expedition under the direction of M.R. 
Khalatbari discovered a copper/bronze bracelet with an incomplete Urartian 
inscription in a grave at Toul-e Gilan, a cemetery located in the Iranian Taleš 
(Plate 13.1)1 about 42 km west of Hashtpar (37° 47' 51" N, 48° 53' 56" E). The 
discovery of an object with an Urartian inscription in Gilan raises many ques-
tions about the Urartian presence in northwestern Iran and the extent, if any, 
of Urartu’s influence in the circum-Caspian region. The remarks offered here 
are dedicated with great admiration to Oscar White Muscarella, a scholar who 
has shed more light than most on the archaeology and early history of north-
western Iran and who has himself tackled many of the issues discussed below.
	
The Toul-e Gilan Bracelet
The bracelet in question was found in Grave 1, a burial described by the excava-
tor as that “of a wealthy family” containing an estimated seven individuals: one 
“outside of the eastern wall”; the principal burial within the grave ­chamber, 
distinguished by its rich assortment of grave goods; and a further five skele-
tons, all within the chamber. The dead were buried in a flexed position, lying 
on their left side.2 In view of the fact that the ceramics recovered in Grave 1 (see 
below) span the entire period from the earlier Iron Age to the Parthian period, 
it remains unclear whether this is truly a collective burial, in the sense of an 
assemblage of dead buried simultaneously or sequentially by one community, 
or a series of inhumations interred over a number of centuries, reusing the 
same built tomb.
Although the precise dimensions of the bracelet have not been published, 
it appears, from the photographs, to have been intended for wear on the wrist

Toul-E Gilan and the Urartian Empire
(Plate 13.2). The bracelet is made of thin sheet metal and was repaired with a 
rivet in antiquity. It is incised or chased on the exterior in a double herringbone 
pattern between horizontal lines. Pointing to the placement of the inscription, 
Shahrokh Razmjou has suggested that the bracelet may have been made from 
a bronze strip, cut away from the rim of a vessel inscribed in the interior just 
below the rim, or alternatively from part of a plaque that was cut and turned 
into a bracelet.3
The interior of the bracelet bears an incised, one-line inscription in 
­Urartian cuneiform: [ma]r-giš-ti[…]-ni-še….uš-tú-[…]-[ni?], i.e. “…Argišti’s son 
­dedicated.” The scholars who have discussed this find have disagreed over 
its interpretation. Rasool Bashash Kanzaq, the first editor of the inscription, 
mistook Argišti for the dedicant whom he identified as Argišti i. Further, he 
suggested that Argišti i and his father Minua governed the area between Lake 
Urmia and the Caspian, as well as the land to the south of Lake Urmia.4 Dala-
lian and ­Grekian established the correct reading “Argišti’s son dedicated” and, 
on analogy with other published Urartian dedications, suggested that the text 
originally opened with the formula “to (the god) Haldi, this (object),” followed 
by the dedicant’s name. In our current state of knowledge, the reference to 
“Argišti’s son” implies an identification with either Sarduri ii, son of Argišti i, or 
Rusa ii, son of Argišti ii. Dalalian and Grekian prefer Rusa ii,5 whereas Mirjo 
Salvini leans toward Sarduri ii.6
In view of the votive nature of the inscription, Razmjou suggested that the 
vessel or plaque from which he believes the bracelet was made may have come 
originally from a shrine to Haldi, and that its findspot in no way reflects “the 
cultural, political and military penetration” of Gilan by Urartu.7 Dalalian and 
Grekian agreed, and suggested, “the probability of the existence of the ­Urartian 
Empire’s political power over the territories of the present-day Gilan is very 
low indeed.”8 To reach a better understanding of the significance of the Toul-e 
Gilan inscription it may be helpful to rapidly review the history and extent of 
Urartian influence in northwestern Iran.

discussion of this sort is forcefully illustrated by Muscarella, “Urartian Metal Artifacts.”

Urartu and Iran
Evidence of the Urartian presence in northwestern Iran has been accumu-
lating since the early 19th century.9 In the winter of 1828/9 Friedrich Eduard 
Schulz (1799–1829) visited Kelišin,10 where he discovered a bilingual, Assyrian-­
Urartian stele. In 1838 H.C. Rawlinson saw the Taštepe inscription, and in 1852 
M.N. Khanikoff, the Russian Consul-General in Tabriz, made a cast of the 
Kelišin inscriptions.11 Chance finds, said to come from an Urartian burial at 
Ališar on the north side of the Araxes, but actually from Šotlu (modern Ve-
rachram) on the Iranian side of the river, entered the Hermitage Museum in 
1859.12 From the mid-19th through the early 20th century a number of ­travelers 
and scholars visited both Kelišin and Taštepe (Kelišin: 1890, J. de Morgan; 1896, 
W. Faber; 1898,13 C.F. Lehmann-Haupt; sometime prior to 1917,14 V. Minorsky; 
Taštepe: 1857, O. Blau; 1880, S.G. Wilson; 1896, W. Faber; 1898, C.F. Lehmann-
Haupt, see below). In 1950 the Iranian scholar Muhammad Javad Mashkur be-
gan publishing a series of studies on Urartian inscriptions in Iranian ­Azerbaijan, 
including those at Našteban and Razliq. These and others were re-edited in the 
early 1960s by Warren C. Benedict.15 In the late 1960s Wolfram Kleiss initiated a 
multi-year program of survey that identified over 100 sites in Iranian Azerbaijan 
with evidence of Urartian occupation, later distilled in a preliminary map and

­gazetteer of sites published in 1976.16 A compendium of Urartian toponyms in 
cuneiform sources was published in 1981 by Igor Diakonoff and Solmaz Qaşqay 
(Kashkai).17 A survey of the epigraphic evidence and an analysis of the history 
of Urartian political and military involvement in northwestern Iran was pub-
lished in 1984 by Mirjo Salvini,18 and the following year a synopsis of Urartian 
settlement in Iran by Paul Zimansky appeared.19 Nor should one forget that the 
Hasanlu, Haftavan Tepe, and Bastam excavations,20 combined with a seem-
ingly insatiable, exegetical desire to dissect the itinerary of Sargon ii’s eighth 
campaign,21 have generated a steady stream of studies on various aspects of 
Urartu en Iran in recent decades.
So numerous and influential have many of these studies been that the non-
specialist could be forgiven for thinking that northwestern Iran was part of 
Urartu. Indeed, in 1976 Kleiss and Hauptmann suggested that Urartu extended 
in an east–west direction from the upper Euphrates in Turkey to the area of 
­Ardabil in Iran, and in a north–south direction from Lake Çildir in northeast-
ern Turkey and Gyumri (Leninakan) in northwestern Armenia to Rawandiz 
(Rowanduz) in northeastern Iraq.22 Not everyone, however, would agree with 
this spatial definition of Urartu.
Urartu is often referred to as the kingdom of Van, but Paolo Pecorella and 
Mirjo Salvini nominated Musasir, identified by Rainer Boehmer with mod-
ern Mudjesir, in northeastern Iraq,23 as “one of the irradiating centres of the 
­Urartaean ethnos” prior to the coalescence of the Urartian state in the 9th cen-
tury b.c.24 In order to explain the apparent anomaly of the chief cult center of

­Urartu’s paramount deity lying outside the bounds of Urartu, Zimansky pos-
ited that “a group of warriors whose leader initiated the dynasty in Van” was 
“forced northward by Assyrian pressure in the ninth century” from Musasir.25
Urartu has been characterized as “the creation of a uniquely single-minded 
and consistent dynasty, bent upon developing Armenia’s agricultural potential 
and exploiting it mainly with captive labor” that “expanded quickly, by military 
force, over a considerable area of great regional diversity.”26 Between the mid-
9th and the late 8th century b.c. a series of military campaigns was launched 
from the Urartian core area that created a small empire by conquering, annex-
ing, and occupying neighboring territories. In addition to the annexation of  
agriculturally productive land and the wealth it produced, the acquisition 
of human labor and horses27 was probably one of the prime considerations  
of Urartian expansionism, as well as tactical positioning on Assyria’s north-
eastern flank.
In discussing Sargon ii’s eighth campaign, Paul Zimansky has stressed that 
Sargon’s letter to Aššur scrupulously expressed the “conceptual dichotomy be-
tween the land of Urartu on the one hand and the Mannean provinces that 
had been added to the Urartian state on the other.”28 This is less a question 
of core vs. periphery than one of (adopted) homeland vs. empire. Despite 
Kleiss’s optimism that, as a result of fieldwork in the 1960s and early 1970s, “die 
Ausdehnung Urartus nach Osten konnte somit weitgehend geklärt werden,”29 
there are still many questions concerning the extent of the Urartian occupa-
tion of northwestern Iran, as to where the limits of Urartian influence may 
have lain, how deep Urartian cultural influence penetrated in the indigenous 
population, and what relations those areas “beyond the pale” may have had 
with conquered areas controlled by Urartu, as well as with the Urartian core 
itself. Was the Urartian presence in northwestern Iran exclusively a military oc-
cupation? In northwestern Iran Zimansky has pointed to a “pattern of fortify-
ing rock spurs and depopulating older tell sites in valleys,”30 while Mirjo Salvini 
has stressed that no other ancient Near Eastern state staked out its territory

so systematically with visual markers, in this case, inscribed stelae, as Urartu 
did.31 Did Urartian occupation entail a movement of Urartian settlers onto 
pre-existing farms and pastures whose owners had been evicted, driven off, or 
enslaved? Did it involve the establishment of new farmsteads and villages via 
a process of colonization, as suggested over a century ago by Gaston Maspero 
(see below)? Did the Urartians colonize northwestern Iran in the same way as 
the Assyrians colonized parts of southeastern Anatolia?32
Here it may be useful to recall the criteria most often used by scholars when 
designating a site in Iran as Urartian. Kleiss, for example, emphasized the pres-
ence of fine red-polished ware (7th century b.c.), though this is only one of 
many types of Urartian pottery,33 and/or typically Urartian wall construction 
involving terraces and stepped foundations.34 Urartian inscriptions signaled 
an Urartian presence as well, but, as Stephan Kroll has observed, the absence 
of Urartian inscriptions is no guarantee that an area was not under Urartian 
control, for it is always possible that an area had been incorporated into the 
Urartian empire “prior to the development of a tradition of this kind of writ-
ing,” i.e. inscriptions that commemorated conquests.35 All the conceptual dif-
ficulties associated with Bradley Parker’s “continuum of boundary dynamics”36 
apply in the case of northwestern Iran.
Linking the distribution of artifacts, architecture, and inscriptions to his-
torical developments is, however, an exercise fraught with difficulties and open 
to multiple interpretations.37 However, at the very least, the erection of both

tifications are distinguished from later ones on the basis of the presence of “strong geo-
metrical design with a sequence of risalites between massive rectangular towers, without 
regard for the topography of the site” (early) and “no massive rectangular towers but only 
small risalites in the walls, which follow the best topographic contour” (late). For a more 
detailed exposition of the archaeological indices of the Urartian presence, see Zimansky, 
“Urartian Material Culture.”

Zimansky, “Urartian Geography,” 9, n. 35, referring to Kroll, “Archäologische Fundplätze,” 
128. This seems unlikely, however, considering the fact that Išpuini and Menua already 
left such commemorative inscriptions in the late 9th century. More plausible, however, 
is the possibility that, in areas that may have been conquered, the often difficult to find 
commemorative inscriptions have simply not yet been discovered.

fortresses and watchtowers38 strongly suggests that the Urartian presence in 
northwestern Iran involved a military occupation. Zimansky has suggested that 
Urartian expansion was aimed at the annexation of “expanses of alluvial land 
with the primary establishment of state control in the form of fortresses on el-
evated ground around their margins,” and that “no one today would question 
that the plains of Marand, Khoy, Shahpur, Urmia, and Ushnu-Solduz were cul-
turally Urartian in this imperial sense. It is also beyond dispute that the whole 
east shore of Lake Urmia was not.”39 Although the historical trajectory of Ura-
rtian occupation in northwestern Iran is reasonably well-known to specialists, 
several new inscriptions have come to light in recent years and it may be helpful 
to review the subject with the elucidation of the Toul-e Gilan discovery in mind.
	
The Expansion and Contraction of Urartian Authority in 
Northwestern Iran
The history of Urartian involvement in northwestern Iran can be reconstructed 
on the basis of three groups of texts, viz. Urartian royal annals in the heartland, 
mainly in and around Van; Urartian commemorative inscriptions “in the field,” 
i.e. at or near the scene of conquests or visits made to the region itself; and 
Assyrian sources. Whereas the Assyrian texts can often be dated with consider-
able precision, the Urartian inscriptions found outside the heartland cannot, 
and the chronology of events often relies on inference. Nevertheless, even if 
cause and effect are not always certain, a plausible reconstruction of the de-
velopment of the Urartian presence in northwestern Iran can be sketched out. 
Based on the currently available body of sources, we may suggest a sequence 
of ten phases, as follows:
(1)	
The reign of Šalmaneser iii
(2)	 Reconquest of S/Zapa(i)ele and conquest of Mešta by Išpuini and Minua; 
pilgrimage to Musasir
(3)	 Reinforcement of Qalatgah; development of Eždaha Bulaqi; reconquest 
of Mešta by Minua; platform for attacks on Mannea
(4)	 Attacks against B/Puštū/ō and Mannea by Argišti i
(5)	 Sarduri ii’s campaign against Puluade and Libliune
38	
Such as the ones mentioned by Sargon ii in the letter to Aššur, Thureau-Dangin, Une rela-
tion, 41, ll. 249–250, and the one located “on a height separated by a saddle from Qalatgah’s 
peak” (see below), Muscarella, “The Location of Ulhu,” 469. Kleiss, “Urartäische Plätze in 
Iran,” figures 22–23.

(6)	 Retaliation (?) by Tiglath-Pileser iii in his 2nd, 3rd, 9th, and 11th pâlu
(7)	 Recovery of territories lost and intrigue with Mannean principalities un-
der Rusa i
(8)	 Retaliation by Sargon ii in his 3rd, 6th pâlu; retaliation by Rusa i in 
­Sargon’s 7th pâlu; Sargon’s 8th pâlu and Rusa’s suicide
(9)	 Argišti ii’s reconquista
(10)	 Expansion and consolidation under Rusa ii; end of Urartian control, 
burning of Bastam
(1)	
The Reign of Šalmaneser iii
In 859 b.c., the year of his accession, Šalmaneser iii campaigned against 
­Urartu and returned via the “sea of the land Nairi,”40 a term used to describe 
Lake Urmia,41 where he washed his weapons, repeating his action in 856 b.c. 
as well.42 The fact that it was almost thirty years before he sent his army across 
the Zab and attacked, among many foes, Udaku the Mannean, in 829 b.c., sug-
gests that this region had been pacified if not annexed outright. The follow-
ing year his army “marched to Zapparia, the fortified city,” which he captured 
along with a further 45 cities “belonging to the people of Musasir,” after which 
his army marched to the land of the Urartians, burning, razing, and destroying 
their cities.43 Where were those cities? In the opinion of Pecorella and Sal-
vini, they were “in the region of Lake Urmia.”44 If so, then clearly Urartu had 
extended its influence in the interval between the beginning of Šalmaneser’s 
reign and his later years.

a ­fortified site located roughly halfway between modern Ušnaviyeh and 
Hasanlu,46 reports the conquest of Ṣ/Zapa(i)ele (KURṣ/za-pa-GA-ú-e)47 and 
its unnamed king. If, as Maurits van Loon suggested, this is identical to the 
­Zapparia in Musasir conquered by the forces of Šalmaneser iii some years 
earlier,48 then it marks a resurgence of Urartian power in the region. The 
­Qalatgah text also mentions the town of Uiše. Salvini originally suggested 
this might be ­Qalatgah itself,49 but later identified it with Qaleh Ismail Aga,50 
­preferring, like Muscarella, to identify Qalatgah with ancient Ulhu.51 It was 
probably at this time that the father and son conquered Mešta, an achieve-
ment mentioned in the Karagündüz stele.52 Mešta must have been an impor-
tant center; Salvini has identified it with Hasanlu,53 whereas Kroll associated it 
with “the large fortress at Aslan Qal’eh,” ca. 5 km west-southwest of Taštepe.54 
In Salvini’s view, the destruction of Hasanlu iv could be plausibly dated to the 
co-regency of Išpiuni and Minua,55 and the subsequent construction of the 
Hasanlu iiib city wall attributed to the Urartians.56 Viewed in their entirety, 
the campaigns of Minua and his father effectively “added the western side of 
the Urmia basin to their holdings.”57

Toul-E Gilan and the Urartian Empire
The late 9th century Urartian reconquest of the Lake Urmia basin was capped 
by the journey of Išpuini and Minua to Musasir (Urartian Ardini).58 This cultic-
political peregrination was commemorated by the erection (ca. 820–810 b.c.) 
of a stele bearing an Assyrian-Urartian bilingual inscription in the ­principal 
pass linking northeastern Iraq and the region south of Lake Urmia.59 The 
Kelišin ­stele recounts what has been termed a “political pilgrimage”60 made by 
the Urar­tian king and his son to Musasir and the offerings made.61 Although it 
records no military victories, its placement on the route linking the Ušnaviyeh 
valley south of Lake Urmia with Musasir/Ardini suggests that Urartian 
­sovereignty over this important east–west communication route in the late 
9th century was secure;62 the reconquest of Mešta, described in the Qalatgah 
inscription, can be seen as a necessary precursor to the peaceful pilgrimage de-
scribed on the Kelišin stele. Moreover, the chronological priority of the Qalatgah 
inscription is suggested by its ductus, which, according to Salvini, is “besonders 
archaisch, sie kann damit sogar älter als die vom Kelišin sein.”63 One can only 
agree with Pecorella and Salvini when they state that these documents attest 
to “the annexation or reconquest of the lands east of the Zagros mountains.”64 
Further, they have stressed that, taken together, the Qalatgah and Kelišin in-
scriptions imply that the Urartians must have controlled the entire region  
between these two sites during the co-regency of Išpuini and Minua.65

construction of a barzidibidu house by Minua (ca. 815–785/780 b.c.).66 For this 
reason, Charles Burney suggested that the main structures there were indeed 
the work of Minua, citing Robert H. Dyson, Jr., who considered Qalatgah a 
strategic post “commanding the Ushnu valley, then a frontier district between 
Urartu and the zone of Assyrian influence.”67 More recently, Kroll suggested 
that, “Within the dense network of Urartian fortresses which stretches from 
Armenia to the South-western shore of Lake Urmia, Qalatgah indeed is located 
at the southern end … Moreover, it is the biggest fortress in the entire region.”68
Urartian activity under Minua is also indicated by two more of his inscrip-
tions. At Eždaha Bulaqi (Ain e-Rum), ca. 54 km south of Urumiyeh, Kleiss 
found a rounded, rock-cut niche with a badly damaged foundation inscription 
of Minua’s pertaining to the spring (Urartian taramanili) at the site.69 More im-
portant, however, is the now destroyed inscription from Taštepe,70 a site with 
pre-Urartian occupation71 ca. 21 km northwest of Miandoab and almost 40 km 
east of Hasanlu, which marked, in Kleiss’s opinion, “die östlichste urartäische 
Präsenz südlich des Urmia-Sees.”72
The first confirmed visitor to Taštepe was Major H.C. Rawlinson in October 
1838.73 Despite the fact that Rawlinson did not even attempt to make a copy of 
the inscription, a long discussion of Taštepe and Rawlinson’s visit to the site

had heard of in the neighbourhood. This was the Cuneiform inscription of Tásh Teppeh, 
an isolated hillock in the plain, distant 5 miles from Chillik, in a direction of S. 30 E. On 
reaching the spot I found the teppeh to be of an irregular shape, 350 paces in circumfer-
ence at the base, and, as well as I could judge, from 50 to 60 feet above the level of the 
plain—it is formed of a projection of limestone above the soil, lying in strata nearly per-
pendicular…. The inscription is about 35 inches square, and consists of 21 lines, written in 
the Median alphabet, somewhat modified from the form which it exhibits on the tablets 
of Bísitún, Hamadán, and Persepolis; it is deplorably mutilated—the rock being liable, 
from the direction of the strata, to chip off in large flakes, so that the greater part of the 
writing is thus altogether destroyed.”

Toul-E Gilan and the Urartian Empire
was published by Carl Ritter in 1840.74 Later, in 1857, the Prussian scholar and 
diplomat Otto Blau (1828–1879) traveled to Iran as part of a commercial delega-
tion.75 Although he had applied for a scientific subvention from the Deutsche 
Orient-Gesellschaft (dog) on 3 February, prior to his departure, Blau only 
learned that he had been granted the sum of 500 Reichsthaler in a letter from 
the dog treasurer dated 1 May. By this time, however, his itinerary was set and 
could not be changed. Notwithstanding the limitations imposed by the com-
mercial nature of the mission, Blau still managed to acquire a small collection 
of manuscripts, books, coins, a copy of the Sasanian inscription at Derbend 
(given to him by M.N. Khanikoff), and, most importantly for our purposes, a 
paper squeeze of the Taštepe inscription as well as a plaster cast of the Kelišin 
inscription (see below), which he presented to the dog.76 Although Archibald 
Sayce suggested in 1882 that Blau’s squeeze of the Taštepe inscription had been 
lost,77 it was in fact sitting in the dog library in Halle, where it was found in 
1893 by Waldemar Belck.78 As Belck noted, Sayce had come to the conclusion 
that the squeeze must have been lost because the inscription had never been 
published, but this was simply a reflection of the poor quality of the squeeze.  
Nevertheless, Belck was able to make out some of the content, including 
­Minua’s name, the reference to a military campaign against the Manneans, and 
the fact that Minua had erected a building at Taštepe.
In 1880 the site was visited by the Rev. S.G. Wilson (1858–1916), who, how-
ever, does not seem to have made any attempt to document the inscription.79

fire temple, was identical to the site visited in 1831 by Col. Monteith at “Satelmish, where, 
on a small limestone rock, are still to be seen the ruins of a fire-temple, but of no conse-
quence.” See Monteith, “Journal of a Tour through Azerdbijan,” 6.

ber of persons in Mianduab, they could tell me nothing of the whereabouts of the rock. 
Guided by the map, after a two hours’ gallop over the plain, I, however, came to the place, 
a small circular hill rising out of the level plain. One side of the rock is smoothed off, and a 
space about five feet by three is inscribed with the arrow-headed characters. At the top of 
the hill are the ruins of a fort, and the ground about gives back a hollow sound, as if there 
were a cavity below.”

Jacques de Morgan made a squeeze of the inscription on 8 October 1890.80 In 
1896 Wilhelm Faber (1845–1916), an evangelical Lutheran pastor and mission-
ary from Tschirma near Greiz (Thuringia),81 donated fragments of the Taštepe 
inscription to the British Museum.82 C.F. Lehmann-Haupt and his expedition 
visited the site in 1898, but were sorely disappointed by the state of the inscrip-
tion and the vandalism that had left it in three fragments83 (no doubt the work 
of Faber, hence his donation to the British Museum). The American Orientalist 
A.V. Williams Jackson came very near to the site in 1903, but was unaware of its 
existence until he returned to the United States.84
The Taštepe inscription records a campaign against Mešta, three other cities, 
and the land of Baršua/Parsua, as well as the construction of a small fort at the 
site, described as “in the land of the city of Mešta.”85 As Mešta had already been 
conquered by Išpiuni and Minua, the Taštepe inscription must be a record of 
its reconquest. Given the location of Taštepe and the contents of its inscrip-
tion, Belck surmised that the site was in ancient Mannea. Further, believing 
that the text mentioned the construction of a palace, Belck argued that Minua 
was unlikely to have built this at the edge of Mannea, but more probably in 
the middle of it. Hence, from this he inferred that Mannea itself extended out-
ward from the southern, southeastern, and southwestern shores of Lake Urmia 
with Taštepe roughly in its center.86 On the strength of the Taštepe ­inscription

Gaston Maspero wrote, just a few years later, “Towards the end of his reign 
he [Minua] partly subjugated the Mannai, planting colonies throughout their 
territory to strengthen his hold on the country.”87 This view was disputed by 
Pecorella and Salvini, however, who suggested that the Taštepe inscription  
(l. 5) implies that the conquest of Mannea proceeded from Taštepe, not that 
the site was located in Mannea.88
Be that as it may, Pecorella and Salvini also emphasized that, as Taštepe is 
located ca. 40 km east of Hasanlu, the entire region between Mahabad and 
Miandoab must have been under Urartian control, as was Qalatgah, 20 km to 
the west of Hasanlu.89

Attacks against B/Puštū/ō and Mannea by Argišti i
Due to a lack of epigraphic evidence dating to the 8th century b.c. in north-
western Iran, the continued Urartian occupation of the territories in the region 
conquered by Minua and his father can only be assumed, rather than clearly 
proven.90 Nevertheless, Argišti i’s long Tatenbericht at Van91 speaks of many 
campaigns and conquests, including one against B/Puštū/ō, B/Parsua,92 and 
Mannea93 (ca. 785/780–760 b.c.) that, in the opinion of Pecorella and Salvini, 
“certainly had a sure land behind them at Ushnaviyēh and Solduz,” as attested 
by a number of Urartian fortresses94 (though their date can never be anything 
but approximate). Like those of Išpuini and Minua, the successes of Argišti i 
were probably attributable to a combination of Urartian aggression and a pe-
riod of Assyrian weakness.95

Sarduri ii’s Campaign against Puluade and Libliune
The Surb Pogos stele96 records a victory by Sarduri ii (ca. 760–730 b.c.) over the 
Assyrian king Aššur-nirari v (754–746 b.c.), possibly on the Middle Euphrates,97 
sometime in the first half of the Urartian king’s reign. Whether this preceded 
or followed Sarduri’s campaign in northwestern Iran is impossible to say, but 
in either case it implies continued Assyrian weakness. ­According to a rock 
inscription at Seghendel (Seqindel), northeast of Tabriz, Sarduri ii attacked 
­Ultudiauni, king of the land of Puluade, conquered 21 fortresses, and captured 
45 cities.98 The Seghendel inscription repeats almost verbatim the account 
given of the campaign in Sarduri’s royal annals at Hazine Kap�s�.99 In addition 
to seizing large numbers of prisoners and livestock, Sarduri ii built fortresses 
and boasted of securing the agricultural lands he had conquered. Interest-
ingly, in his annals Sarduri says that he had an inscription made at ­Libliune, 
the fortified “royal city,” suggesting that Seghendel is the site of ­Libliune.100 As 
Salvini has emphasized, prior to the conquest of Libliune, ­Urartian forces had 
never penetrated this far to the east.101 Diakonoff and Kashkai suggested that 
­Puluade denoted the area around Libliune,102 but it is more likely that this was 
a region conquered on the way there, i.e., earlier in the same campaign. This is 
suggested by the fact that Puluade is also mentioned in the Ilandag inscription, 
located to the north in Nakhchivan, which describes a campaign by Išpuini and 
Minua and mentions the erection of an inscription in the land of Puluade.103
What prompted Sarduri ii’s eastern foray? Was it simply an attempt to ex-
pand Urartu’s eastern dominions? And what were its results? Although the 
chronology of events is unclear,104 it is tempting to suggest that Sarduri ii’s 
conquests prompted retaliation by Tiglath-Pileser iii (745–727 b.c.) soon after 
he assumed the Assyrian throne.

Retaliation (?) by Tiglath-Pileser iii in his 2nd, 3rd, 9th and  
11th Pâlu
Tiglath-Pileser campaigned in the Zagros in 744 (2nd pâlu), defeated ­Urartu 
and its Anatolian allies in 743 (3rd pâlu), returned to the Zagros in 737 (9th 
pâlu), and campaigned against the core of Urartian territory in 735 b.c. (11th 
pâlu).105 In his discussion of Assyrian and Urartian actions in western Iran, 
Rigg noted that under Sarduri ii “the sphere of Urartian emphasis had turned 
more and more eastward, particularly with the resurgence of Assyrian power 
under Tiglath-Pileser iii and Sargon.”106 As suggested above, Sarduri’s conquest 
of Libliune may have been a prelude to Tiglath-Pileser’s campaigns, though the 
possibility cannot be ruled out that it was a response to losses sustained as a 
result of the Assyrian king’s campaigns.

Recovery of Territories Lost and Intrigue with Mannean 
Principalities under Rusa i
Similarly, it is likely though by no means proven that, early in his reign, Rusa i 
(ca. 730–714/13 b.c.) tried to win back territory and influence in northwestern 
Iran that had been lost under his predecessor Sarduri ii. Fales has suggested 
that at this time Mannea became split into two spheres, one pro-Assyrian 
and the other pro-Urartian.107 Most probably the Urartian inscription from 
Mahmudabad (between Lake Urmia and Ušnu), which records a military expe-
dition and sacrifices made by Rusa to the local deities Šebitu and Arṭu’arasau, 
like the Urartian-Assyrian bilingual duplicates from Movana (ca. 32 km west of 
Urmia), Topzawa, and Mergeh Karvan,108 reflects Rusa’s activities early in his 
career.109

from the last quarter of the 9th century, which mentions these deities in a list of over 
80 Urartian and non-Urartian deities and their cult centers, might imply that the area 
around Mahmudabad was already subject to Urartian control during the reign if Išpuini.

Retaliation by Sargon ii in 3rd, 6th Pâlu; Retaliation by Rusa i in 
Sargon’s 7th Pâlu; 8th Pâlu and Rusa’s Suicide
According to Sargon ii’s annals, in his third year the inhabitants of the 
­Mannean cities Sukkia, Bala, and Abitikna switched their allegiance to 
Rusa, prompting Sargon to “rip them out of their places” and deport them to 
­Damascus ­(Hatti-Amurru).110 Nevertheless, only three years later, according 
to Sargon, Rusa succeeded in turning the Mannean governors of Wišdiš and 
Zikirtu against Assyria, and together they defeated and killed Aza, an ­Assyrian 
ally. Twenty-two Mannean towns joined the coalition and put Ullusunu, Aza’s 
brother, on the Mannean throne. As a result, Aššur-le’i of Karalla and Itti of 
­Allabria revolted against Assyrian authority and went over to the Urartian side, 
prompting Sargon’s sixth campaign. This involved an offensive against the 
royal city of Izirtu in Mannea, whereupon Ulusunu was pardoned and tribute 
imposed upon him. Itti of Allabria was captured and deported while Aššur-le’i 
was flayed. Captured towns in Niksama were placed under the administrative 
control of the Assyrian province of Parsua, and Bel-šarru-usur of Kišesim was 
hauled back to Assyria and replaced with one of Sargon’s eunuchs as governor. 
According to the annals, in Sargon’s seventh year Rusa reconquered 22 cities 
from the now pro-Assyrian Ullusunu and talked the Mannean governor Dayuk-
ku into defecting to the Urartian side. Once again, Sargon reacted by retaking 
the 22 cities and deporting Daiukku111 and his family to Syria.112 More Assyrian 
conquests followed, including those of nine fortresses in five regions belonging 
to Rusa, all of which was a prelude to Sargon’s well-known eighth campaign. 
This is not the place to review the many conflicting identifications put forward 
for the main places mentioned in Sargon’s itinerary (e.g. the identifications 
of Ulhu and Uiše),113 but it is instructive that most of the places mentioned 
seem to be to the south and west of Lake Urmia, even if it is possible that Sar-
gon’s route took him up the east side of the lake.114 In Zimansky’s estimation, 
“the area that was sufficiently integrated into the state [Urartu] to constitute 
what Sargon might have regarded as lying within the Urartian frontier, did not

Argišti ii’s Reconquista
Although Rusa’s suicide is reported at the end of the annalistic account of 
Sargon’s eighth year,116 Urartu proved resilient.117 Argišti ii’s (ca. 713–685 b.c.) 
accession to the Urartian throne is likely to have followed immediately upon 
Rusa’s death in Sargon’s ninth year,118 and in Sargon’s thirteenth year, shortly 
before the death of the Assyrian king, Argišti appears as an ally of Mutallu of 
Kummuhu (“ein böser Hethiter”).119 Under Argišti ii an Urartian reconquista, 
or at least revival, in Iranian Azerbaijan is suggested by three rock inscriptions 
at Našteban, Razliq, and Šišeh. Našteban is located ca. 60 km southwest of 
­Ardabil, while Razliq is a bit farther west; Šišeh is over 50 km north-northwest 
of Razliq (38°36'27" N, 47°21'59" E).120
Similarities between these inscriptions suggest that they relate to the same 
campaign,121 thought to have taken place between ca. 700 and 685 b.c. Aside 
from the evidence these texts provide122 indicating that Urartu was far from a 
spent force, they are interesting because of the toponyms they contain. Thus, 
in the longer and better-preserved Razliq inscription, Argišti says that he cam-
paigned in the land of Arḫa/ue123 and conquered the lands of Ušulu, Buque, 
Girdu, Gituḫa(ni), and Ṭuišdu. He also mentions crossing a river,124 and says

117	
Zimansky, “Writing,” 265, noted, “Despite Sargon ii of Assyria’s claim of devastating 
­Urartu on his eighth campaign, we have yet to locate a single site that he destroyed.” This 
is a weak argument, however, when one considers the dozens and dozens of unexcavated 
settlements and hill forts in the area thought to have been the arena of Sargon’s campaign.

“I seized the city of R. in a battle, I conquered the (relative) territories (and) 
I placed (them) under tribute, and I built this fortress,” renaming it “Argišti = 
i-urdu for the strengthening of Biainili, for the subjugating of hostile lands.”125 
Whereas Benedict read the original name of the fortress as Rutum(ni), Diako-
noff and Kashkai suggested that it should be read Eruqima, while André-Salvini 
and Salvini read it as Rub(dù?)tar(ni).126 The Našteban text mentions the con-
quered countries as Buque, Girdu, Gituḫa(ni), and Ṭuišdu, and identifies the 
conquered city as Eu[xx]ni. This discrepancy in the name of the conquered 
city may be explained if two were in fact meant; one, Rub(dù?)tar(ni), that 
was close to Razliq, and another, Eu[xx]ni, that was near Našteban.127 This cir-
cumstance would also explain why the countries of Arḫa/ue and Ušulu appear 
only in the Razliq inscription, as these were presumably located en route to the 
fortress there.
The Šišeh text, on the other hand, commemorates the building of a fortress 
called “protection/garrison of Haldi.” Despite damage to the first half of the 
inscription, enough parallels to the Razliq and Našteban inscriptions exist to 
suggest that the text dates to the same campaign, for it refers to settling in the 
country of Arḫa/ue and subduing the lands of Ušulu and Buque.128 According 
to Kleiss’s interpretation of these texts, the Urartian presence at Razliq was 
well outside the actual area controlled by Urartu.129 André-Salvini and Salvini 
have pointed out, however, that, “with the conquest of the Aji čay valley” the 
Urartians “controlled the road to the Caspian Sea along which there are no 
natural obstacles.”130
shown, however, that muna is a common noun meaning “river,” not a proper name. See 
André-Salvini and Salvini, “The Urartian Rock Inscriptions,” 24 and 32, where the river is 
now identified with the Aji čay which flows to the south of both Našteban and Razliq and 
empties into Lake Urmia.

suggest, “garrison of Argišti.”

Expansion and Consolidation under Rusa ii; End of Urartian 
Control, Burning of Bastam
Kleiss suggested that a major phase of “Ostkolonisation” followed under Argišti’s 
son and successor, Rusa ii, when Bastam and many other fortifications, includ-
ing Karmir-blur, Ayanis, Toprakkale, and Adilcevaz Kef, were established.131 For 
him, Taštepe “was the easternmost witness of Urartian presence. The natural 
boundary was formed by the eastern shore of Lake Urmia and, from its north 
shore, the mountain chain passing to the north of Tabriz and merging with the 
massif of Savelan. Westward from Ahar are the easternmost Urartian settle-
ments and citadels known; there lay also the eastern boundary leading north 
to the Araxes.”132 In addition, Kleiss has suggested that Bastam may have been 
founded early in Rusa’s reign.133 In Charles Burney’s opinion, however, Bas-
tam was constructed “primarily to guard an important route … leading west 
through the mountains towards the capital, Van” and “was part of a network 
of garrisons, planned and organized from the centre” that resulted from “the 
extensive reorganization of Urartu carried out under Rusa ii.”134
There is a fundamental contradiction, however, in the positions of Kleiss 
and Burney. Considering Bastam’s location, it is difficult to see how this could 
be considered an expression of a drive toward “Ostkolonisation,” when sites 
like Našteban, Razliq, and Seghendel were located so much farther to the east. 
Rather, if Burney was correct in suggesting that Bastam was built as a bastion 
to guard the eastern approach to the Urartian capital, then its construction 
rather smacks of a consolidation of Urartian power closer to Van; a pulling 
back from the former eastern frontier; and an abandonment of Urartu’s claims 
to territory east of Lake Urmia.
Although Salvini suggested that, after Rusa ii, several more Urartian rulers 
or princes may be attested at Bastam, including Rusa, son of Sarduri (iii or 
iv),135 this scenario was rejected by Kleiss, who argued that Bastam was de-
stroyed by fire during Rusa ii’s reign, perhaps around 660/650 b.c.136 The end

Putting the Toul-e Gilan Bracelet and Inscription in Context
Returning then to the bracelet, as noted above, because the dedicant is given 
as “Argišti’s son,” he has been identified as either Sarduri ii, son of Argišti i, or 
Rusa ii, son of Argišti ii. Can the history of Urartian occupation in northwest-
ern Iran help to determine which is more likely?
It is undoubtedly the case, as we have seen, that in the mid-8th century b.c. 
Sarduri ii campaigned vigorously in what is today Iranian Azerbaijan. His con-
quest of Libliune (Seghendel) marked the easternmost projection of Urartian 
power up to that time. On the other hand, Rusa ii was also active founding, 
among many other fortresses, Bastam, the sacking of which might have even 
afforded an opportunity for the inscribed bracelet, or the object from which it 
is thought to have been made, to be seized, resulting in its eventual arrival at 
Toul-e Gilan. In the interval, Argišti ii had made territorial gains, and his com-
memorative inscriptions at Razliq and Našteban, the latter ca. 60 km south-
west of Ardabil, were even closer to the Caspian and Toul-e Gilan than Sarduri 
ii’s inscription at Seghendel. Can the artifacts recovered in the Toul-e Gilan 
cemetery offer any assistance in trying to assess the relative merits of a mid-8th 
vs. a mid-7th century b.c. date for the bracelet?
Unfortunately, for the most part the finds from Toul-e Gilan are illustrated 
and discussed without reference to the specific grave from which they derive, 
and even a cursory glance at the material suggests that the graves may well 
have been reused over time, since parallels can be adduced from Iron I through 
the Parthian period (Table 13.1). Nevertheless, the most noteworthy parallel in 
the entire assemblage is between the very distinctive, punctate decoration 
on one of two ceramic vessels specifically identified as coming from Grave 1, 
where the inscribed bracelet was found, and that seen on a tall vessel from 
Kaluraz. Although the Kaluraz vessel has been broadly assigned an Iron ii or 
iii date,139 the Toul-e Gilan vessel and bracelet suggest an Iron iii date (unless

From at least 713 b.c. onward, the Cimmerians were a factor, attacking Urartu on more 
than one occasion. See e.g. Rolle, “Urartu und die Reiternomaden,” 297ff.; Pecorella and 
Salvini, “Researches,” 15–16; Fuchs and Parpola, The Correspondence of Sargon ii, xxix. 
Similarly, Rolle considers the potential role of the Scythians in Urartu’s demise.

Toul-e Gilan represents yet another link with Urartu is impossible to say with 
certainty.141
The distribution of Urartian commemorative inscriptions in Iranian 
­Azerbaijan, while not necessarily comprehensive, does give us some indica-
tion of where and when Urartian conquests occurred in the area. Although not 
inconsequential as evidence, the absolute distance between Toul-e ­Gilan and 
the nearest Urartian inscription mentioning a military campaign is a crude 
indicator of just how far east Urartian influence may have penetrated and 
whether it ever reached the circum-Caspian region. Assyrian sources are fa-
mously fond of bombastically proclaiming the arrival of foreign chieftains and 
kings, impressed by the might and the threat of Assyria. On analogy with this 
sort of behavior, one could imagine local dynasts outside the areas occupied 
by Urartian forces (or colonists), sending delegations to establish friendly rela-
tions and obviate potential Urartian aggression. In such situations, they may 
well have returned home with inscribed gifts commemorating their bond with 
a particular Urartian king. On the other hand, the inscription on the Toul-e 
Gilan bracelet implies a votive offering to Haldi, either an original donation in 
the form of the bracelet or an off-cut (pace Razmjou) from another inscribed 
object, such as a metal vessel. In this case, the object could have reached Toul-
e Gilan not as a gift from an Urartian monarch, but as booty from a raid on a 
Haldi temple. This need not have happened when Urartu was in control of 
Iranian Azerbaijan, but potentially occurred sometime afterward, whether 
by a few years or decades. For example, a votive offering to Haldi could have 
entered the possession of an indigenous fighter (the principal individual bur-
ied in Grave 1?) when Bastam was destroyed or when any number of Urartu’s 
140	
Vahdati, “Marlik and Toul-e Talish,” 134, suggests this, in light of the bracelet’s worn state. 
Vahdati has also attempted to assess the chronology of the tomb based on the ceramics, 
jewelry, and weaponry, and considers a 10th–9th century b.c. date probable. He suggested 
that the inscribed bracelet derives from a secondary burial.
141	
The same could be said of two “wine legs,” i.e. boot-shaped vessels, from Rad and Hake-
mi’s excavations at Hasanlu, in the National Museum (Tehran). No information on their 
provenience exists. See Melikian-Chirvani, “The Iranian Wine Leg,” 73 and figures 1–2. For 
a vessel with two boots from Hasanlu, see Azarpay, “Two Urartian Boot-shaped Vessels,” 
figure 4. A boot-shaped vessel is also known from Ghalekuti i (tomb 9, Area G), dated to 
Iron I. See Nishiaki, et al., Catalogue, plate 53/2. Boot-shaped vessels are also known from 
the Parthian period. See Ne’mati and Sadraie, “Parthian Rhytons,” figure 1.4 and plate 9. 
This example is dated by associated coins from the reigns of Mithradates ii through Oro-
des i (ca. 128–70 b.c.).

­eastern ­outposts were abandoned. The possibilities are limitless and specula-
tion on them largely futile.
In 1913 the well-known Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum, 
D.G. Hogarth, wrote, “Geographers, wishing to identify tribal districts men-
tioned in records of royal Assyrian campaigns, must bear in mind the obvious 
magniloquence of such records. A small tribal district, confined to one valley 
and its laterals, is, doubtless, often spoken of in the same terms as much vaster 
areas; and the great majority of the conquered ‘countries’ enumerated one on 
the top of another to the glory of a Great King, were probably not larger than 
the modern holdings of Kurdish beys in those same mountainous lands.”142 
Toul-e Gilan may represent the cemetery of one such tribal district, and Grave 
1 the interment of one of its pre-Kurdish beys. Outside the grasp of Urartu, well 
east of Seghendel, Razliq, or Našteban, Toul-e Gilan was clearly part of an Iron 
Age cultural community in the circum-Caspian region that disposed of consid-
erable wealth, to judge by the ceramics, metal weaponry, and even gold interred 
with its deceased. But whether the Urartians realized that yet another “Upper 
Sea,” namely the Caspian, lay just a bit east of their easternmost conquests, is 
difficult to say. Agriculturally rich, and later known for its good rainfall, mild 
winters, forests, rice, and sericulture, Gilan would have made a fine addition to 
the empire.143 But if Argišti ii got close, nothing suggests that either Sarduri ii 
or Rusa ii was in a position to project his power all the way to ancient Gilan. As 
James Baillie Fraser wrote in 1826, “There are few countries more completely 
protected by nature against external aggression, than Gheelan; for its coast is 
lined with a belt of impenetrable forest, which opposes a most disheartening 
aspect to an invading foe…. On the south, the passes through its mountains 
are of extreme steepness, difficulty, and length, and might be obstructed or de-
fended with so much ease, that no hostile army, unassisted by treachery, could 
hope to force them; or if it succeeded in reaching the places below, would find 
itself embarrassed in a maze of jungle and morasses, impervious without a 
guide; and even under every advantage, presenting the most serious obstacles 
to the march of many troops encumbered with baggage and military stores.”144

Some Considerations on Urartian Burial Rites
Veli Sevin
Information on Urartian burial rites has increased in the past decades, thanks 
to recent archaeological excavations conducted at the cemetery of Altıntepe 
near Van between 1997 and 1999.1 Despite a lack of textual sources, thanks to 
the Van/Altıntepe excavations, the main features of Urartian mortuary prac-
tices are now more or less known. There are many new and interesting ob-
servations to be made about Urartian burial rites, but it is quite impossible to 
touch upon all aspects of this subject within the scope of this article. This short 
paper, written in honor of Oscar White Muscarella, is a brief presentation of 
the burial evidence gathered from the excavations at the cemetery of Altıntepe 
near Van. Oscar Muscarella, one of the most colorful scholarly detectives of 
Near Eastern archaeology, has devoted his life to the problems of the archaeol-
ogy of Anatolia and northwestern Iran, and it is my great pleasure indeed to 
dedicate this article to such a distinguished scholar.
Tushpa (modern Van Kalesi) was a complex metropolis, where various eth-
nic groups lived side by side throughout the duration of the Urartian Kingdom. 
Altıntepe was its extensive cemetery, some 2 km north of the Urartian cita-
del, in the eighth and seventh centuries b.c. The dimensions of the cemetery, 
­today situated within the modern city of Van, are not known precisely; the area 
stretches approximately 1–1.5 km from north to south and extends several kilo-
meters from east to west. This huge cemetery was discovered in 1965 during the 
construction of Van–Ağrı highway,2 and it has been almost completely pillaged 
by native plunderers from the Middle Ages onwards. This being the case, we 
excavated what was left by the plunderers of the cemetery at Altıntepe.
Forty-six tombs were explored during the excavations, and principally three 
different kinds of tombs have been identified: chamber tombs, individual cre-
mations in urns, and inhumations in simple pits. Rock-cut burial chambers, 35 
of which were discovered, are by far the most common type of tomb unearthed 
in the cemetery (Plate 14.1). In all cases, these chamber tombs were carved into

the soft tufa stone with some care. The rock-cut burial chambers contained 
both inhumations and cremations in urns, which were found together in the 
same burial chamber. Due to the looting of the tombs, however, we do not have 
sufficient information about the original positions of the deceased and their 
grave goods. Nevertheless, it is clear that the urns were placed either in niches 
or on the floor of the chamber, and that there were fewer such cremations than 
inhumations in these burials.
The second burial type is that of individual cremations in clay urns. Seven 
tombs of this type were identified during the excavations. The clay urns were 
placed either vertically in rock crevices or in boxes surrounded by stone slabs 
and were always covered with a cup (Plate 14.2).
The third burial type is inhumation in a simple pit. In such pit graves un-
earthed at Altıntepe the bodies were always laid down in the pit in a flexed 
position, with their heads mostly oriented to the north. Generally they were 
burials of single individuals, but in one pit burial at least six superimposed 
skeletons were found.
In the present paper I will focus specifically on the simple inhumations of 
Altıntepe, which we generally know little about. Thanks to these personal buri-
als, we can sometimes obtain useful information, including details that may be 
used to suggest the ethnic identity of the deceased.3
Four simple pit burials (tm 1–4) have been unearthed in the cemetery. We 
discovered that these pit burials, at least in the areas excavated, were not re-
stricted to any specific area, and were interspersed with other types of graves. 
Because the graves were dug into sand, the shapes of the pits could not be 
identified clearly. One of the burials (tm 4) belonged to a child (Plate 14.3). 
The body lay on its right side, with the head oriented to the west. The legs were 
fairly tightly flexed, and no belongings were found in the burial. In another 
(tm 3), the interior of the pit was faced with thin slabs on one side and natural 
rock on the other (Plate 14.4). This grave contained the skeleton of an adult in 
flexed position, with his or her head oriented to the west. In this case, some 
red-polished Urartian sherds were found beside the head.
Of the four simple inhumation burials found at the cemetery of Altıntepe 
two are of particular importance for their grave goods and burial practices: 
Tombs 1 and 2, which were quite close to one another. Tomb 2 was covered 
with limestone pebbles; in the pit was the skeleton of a woman in flexed posi-
tion, lying on her left side, with her head oriented to the north, and the face 
to the east (Plate 14.5). The legs were tightly flexed, and the arms were folded

toward the face.4 The woman was buried with six plain bronze rings on one of 
the fingers of her left hand (Figure 14.1:4); two bronze hair rings, one on each 
side of her head (Figure 14.1:1–2); two bronze toggle pins, one at each shoulder 
­(Figure 14.1:5–6); and a necklace composed of carnelian, bronze, glass, faience, 
and shell beads—including species such as dentalium, cypraea, engina, and 
­nerita (Figure 14.1:8). The woman wore a bracelet of glass beads on her left 
wrist (Figure 14.1:3). Also noteworthy are a bull’s head pendant made of an-
thracite (Figure 14.1:7) and four eye-beads made of blue glass (Figure 14.1:8). In 
addition to these personal ornaments, three red-polished bowls with everted, 
simple rims were found beside the head of the deceased.
Some of the personal items unearthed in Tomb 2 are interesting, since their 
forms are unfamiliar in Urartian art. For example, bronze spiral hair rings of 
the type found in Tomb 2, which are typically blunt at one end, have a long his-
tory in Anatolia,5 but these are different from the well-known hinged, tubular 
Urartian specimens.6 The two bronze toggle pins from the tomb are also of in-
terest, as their form is completely different from that of characteristic Urartian 
specimens. One of these, a cast bronze toggle pin with truncated conical top, is 
6 cm in height, with a loop on the side of the shaft (Figure 14.1:5). At first glance, 
it recalls the early Iron Age examples from the Van region, but its loop sets it 
apart.7 Of the 19 toggle pins unearthed at Altıntepe, this is the only one with 
a loop attached at the top of the shaft. This kind of toggle pin has been found 
in the cemetery of Artik, situated near the modern town of Gümrü, Armenia, 
dated to the 14th–13th centuries b.c.8 The toggle pin with the loop from Tomb 
2 seems to me to be a composite example exhibiting characteristics of iron 
pins from the Van region of the early Iron Age, and the cast bronze examples 
of the Late Bronze Age from the Artik cemetery.
The other cast bronze toggle pin from Tomb 2, which is 7.2 cm in height, 
is a unique specimen with its thin, flat, and rectangular head (Figure 14.1:6). 
There are no Urartian toggle pins that resemble this pin, in terms of the head

and the shank. A hole is pierced in the lower area of the head, which perhaps 
served for the suspension of beads from the head of the pin in the manner of 
a pendant (Plate 14.6). Though some of the beads from the tomb, such as the 
bull’s head-shaped bead amulet, have typical Urartian characteristics, it is very 
probable that the two pins themselves were not products of the Urartian royal 
workshops.
What did these two remarkable toggle pins signify, with their distinctive, 
non-Urartian features? And why were they found with a woman buried in 
an Urartian cemetery? Although these questions are not easily answered, as  
K. Rubinson and M.I. Marcus have stated, it is possible to obtain some help-
ful information about personal identity from such individual burials. The per-
sonal ornaments found in Tomb 2 can surely say something about the identity 
of the the tomb’s occupant. It can be supposed that this woman may have not 
been a native Urartian from the Van region, and it seems likely that she came 
to Tushpa from north as a deporteé. From this point of view, is it possible to 
establish a correlation between grave types and mass deportation policies

­adopted by the Urartian kings in the eighth and seventh centuries b.c.? At 
present, this question is not easily answered.
The second simple pit burial (Tomb 1) is noteworthy in terms of Urartian 
burial rites. Here, six interments were placed on top of one another in the 
pit.9 The uppermost body was laid out in flexed position in the pit, lying on 
its left side, with the head oriented to the north-east, and the face to the east 
(Plate 14.7). Sherds and some fragments of bronzes were recovered in the area 
of the head, but otherwise the deceased had no personal belongings. Other 
skeletons from Tomb 1 were less than complete, and no small finds were recov-
ered in their vicinity, except for a few sherds (Plate 14.8). This seems to indicate 
that the remains of earlier occupants were collected and consolidated in or-
der to make room for later burials. Tomb 1 shows that simple pit graves could 
contain multiple burials. Yet until this tomb was excavated, it was accepted 
beyond question that such pit burials contained only a single individual. Thus 
Tombs 1 and 2 have provided a great deal of important information about Ura-
rtian burial customs.
Finally, let me emphasize that what is known about the burial rites of the 
Urartians emerges mainly from chamber tombs with multiple burials. Unfor-
tunately, no Urartian cemetery has yet been discovered that is comparable 
to the one at Melekli near Iğdır, explored by P.F. Petrov in 1915.10 Therefore, it 
is not clear in which situations and how often individual burials were used. 
As stated above, seven urn burials, four simple pits, and 35 rock-cut chamber 
tombs have been unearthed in the cemetery of Altıntepe. Although one might 
conclude from these numbers that rock-cut chamber tombs were the most 
popular type of tomb in the Urartian world, this might be misleading. This is 
because the whereabouts of chamber tombs are easily detected both by ar-
chaeologists and by looters, while it is much more difficult to locate individual 
graves for which no marks are visible on the surface. In order to obtain more 
complete information about Urartian burial rites, one must continue to find 
and excavate individual burials as well as the larger chamber tombs with their 
multiple interments.

Architectural and Other Observations Related  
to Erebuni in the Late Seventh/Early Sixth 
Centuries b.c.
David Stronach
One of the more obscure periods in the history of a key area of the ancient Near 
East is represented by the interval that separates the collapse of the kingdom 
of Urartu from the rise of the Achaemenid Persians. In this strictly preliminary 
enquiry I propose to review a number of architectural elements from the ma-
jor site of Erebuni (modern Arinberd)—a site located within the present-day 
bounds of Yerevan, the capital of Armenia (Figure 15.1)—that would appear to 
shed new light on a relatively early moment in this poorly understood period.1
	
The Fall of Urartu
Until not much more than twenty-five years ago it was widely believed that 
Urartu outlived the fall of Assyria in 612 b.c. and that the Urartians were only 
finally overcome by the Medes early in the 6th century or, in more precise 
terms, as Boris Piotrovskiĭ chose to put matters, in approximately 590 b.c.2 
Support for such a date no doubt emanated from (a) a conviction that a polity 
as formidable as Urartu could only have succumbed to a powerful external en-
tity and (b) a clear deference to the Median Logos of Herodotus, in which the 
Medes are credited with an enduring degree of military strength that allowed 
them to extend their western border to the middle reaches of the Halys river in 
central Anatolia in 585 b.c.
As most authorities now agree, however, this particular view of the long arm 
of the Medes rests almost entirely on the testimony of Herodotus (1.95–1.106)—
and the testimony in question has never been matched by any ­compelling 
1	 These notes are offered to Oscar White Muscarella, who, inter alia, was a member of the 
original excavation team at Tepe Nush-i Jan in 1967, in warm appreciation of his many signal 
contributions to the archaeology of the ancient Near East.

evidence on the ground from Anatolia.3 Indeed, it is more than likely that, 
following the Medes’ capture and brief occupation of Nineveh, the effective 
western border of the late 7th-/early 6th-century kingdom of the Medes came 
to lie somewhere not too far to the west of the western foothills of the Zagros 
Range.4
In addition, it has recently become increasingly obvious that not enough 
attention has been paid to one inescapable piece of hard evidence: namely, 
the fact that Urartian royal inscriptions cease to appear soon after the middle 
of the 7th century b.c.5 In sum, this approximate date now seems to represent 
the best available indication of when Urartu met its end—and when a good 
number of the kingdom’s most recent and most prominent royal strongholds 
came to be attacked and destroyed. In this same context it is also evident that

all subsequent references to “Urartu” should be viewed as either anachronistic, 
strictly geographical, or, at least for a limited time, as possible examples of a 
continuing use of the same name to refer to a “successor state” in a similar 
location.6 Needless to say, a date near the middle of the 7th century b.c. for 
the collapse of the kingdom also removes the Medes, who would appear to 
have been far from united at this date,7 from any list of those who might have 
brought about the fall of Urartu.
During his long-running excavations at the major Urartian fortress of Karmir 
Blur (ancient Teishebaini), located only a few kilometers from adjacent Erebu-
ni (Figure 15.1), B.B. Piotrovskiĭ quickly came across evidence for the site’s com-
prehensive destruction. In particular, he discovered that whoever had attacked 
and burned the site had also discharged large numbers of socketed bronze tri-
lobate arrowheads in the direction of the citadel, where many projectiles of 
this distinctive type were found embedded in the citadel’s partly mud-brick 
walls.8 Since iron arrowheads would appear to have been the preferred type 
of arrowhead used by the Urartians,9 such bronze trilobate arrowheads have 
frequently been associated with a Scythian role in the assault: an assault that 
could well have been mirrored at a number of other major ­Urartian fortresses, 
not a few of which were founded, like Karmir Blur, by “Rusa ii,” Urartu’s last 
powerful ruler, whose reign would seem to have fallen principally in the sec-
ond quarter of the 7th century b.c.10
While the Scythians may indeed have played an active part in the military 
confrontations of the mid-7th century b.c., the exact nature of any Scyth-
ian involvement remains to be determined. With reference, for example, to 
the presence of socketed bronze trilobate arrowheads at Ayanis (Figure 15.1),  
Derin and Muscarella have made it clear that it is not possible to assert that

Among anachronistic uses of the term, note, in particular, the royal Achaemenid inscrip-
tions, written in Babylonian cuneiform, where the name “Urartu” continued to be em-
ployed well into the 4th century b.c. (Stronach, “The Campaign of Cyrus the Great in 547 
b.c.,” 167, n. 5.).

only those who attacked Ayanis would have been in a position to use trilobate 
arrowheads.11 By a date early in the second half of the 7th century, in other 
words, these small, wickedly efficient arrowheads (which could be readily 
reproduced in portable molds) could arguably have been employed by more 
than one of the parties to the hard-fought engagements that appear to have 
spelled the end of the long-lived kingdom of Urartu.
Fortunately, however, arrowheads do not represent the only kind of evi-
dence that can be used to try to explore what happened at the time of the 
kingdom’s downfall. If we only look at such information as can be found in the 
Ararat valley—the main focus of the present enquiry—it is striking to note 
that, while Karmir Blur was subjected to an overwhelming attack, neighboring 
Erebuni apparently escaped more or less unscathed. While it could be pro-
posed that one site was attacked and the other was not for the simple reason 
that the older of the two fortresses came to be abandoned soon after Rusa, son 
of Argishti ii, transferred certain prized, inscribed bronze objects from Ere-
buni to his new foundation at Karmir Blur,12 such a proposal is at odds with 
the fact that Erebuni appears to have long remained a continuously occupied, 
more or less undisturbed site.
The possibility should be considered, therefore, that the contrasting fates of 
these two adjacent sites may be best explained by a hitherto little-considered 
scenario: one in which we are witness to the effects of an internal conflict in 
which those who sought to overthrow Rusa were also themselves in possession 
of a number of strategic fortresses. If Erebuni was attacked at this time, there 
is certainly no evidence to suggest that the integrity of the main monuments at 
the core of the site was compromised.13 Also, even if the challenge of attempt-
ing to identify the various parties to the different conflicts that would seem to 
have broken out over much of Urartu near the middle of the 7th century b.c. 
is far from slight, the present focus on what might be termed the architectural 
“end results” that obtained when “the dust had settled” may offer the best hope 
of giving some degree of definition to the principal elements that contributed 
to the overthrow of the Urartian kingdom.

Erebuni’s originally strong defenses were apparently severely tested at one point in the 
long history of the site, but not necessarily on this occasion. In his excavations on the 
steep northeast side of the high mound, Ter-Martirosov (“Stamps and Images,” 135) ­reports 
finding “traces of fire and destruction” associated with “iron arrowheads … characteristic 
of the cultures of the local tribes, which allows for a supposition that the populations of 
those tribes” participated in military operations against Erebuni.

The Architectural Evidence
At a date that was probably not too long after the middle years of the 7th 
­century, the site of Erebuni appears to have been the scene of a new program 
of construction of extreme interest. One indication of the relative speed with 
which the new building program was initiated comes from a succession of 
Urartian to post-Urartian floor levels that recently came to be documented 
in the near vicinity of the approximately square structure with slightly but-
tressed corners that appears, in an admittedly anomalous situation, to have 
represented the core element of the temple of Haldi. In particular, a section 
that was cut through the floors in question during the 2011 season of excava-
tions at the site14 shows no hint of any abandonment between the last use of 
the Urartian floor of the North Court located immediately to the north of the 
temple of Haldi and the level that can be associated with the construction of 
the spacious columned hall with five rows of six columns that came to occupy 
a similar location in the post-Urartian period (Figure 15.2).
Further chronological clues that point to a late 7th-century date for the con-
struction of the thirty-columned hall come from slight but detectable changes 
that have been noted between the early 7th-century Urartian pottery that was 
encountered in the South Passage (to the south of the temple of Haldi) and the 
pottery that is associated with the construction of the hall.15 In addition, a sud-
den decline in the high standards of Urartian masonry (such as would appear 
to have remained unimpaired throughout the reign of Rusa, son of Argishti ii) 
may well account for the fact that no attempt was made to continue to use the 
kind of handsome basalt column base that had previously been one of the hall-
marks of Urartian architecture. More than anything else, however, it is the new 
ground plan of the thirty-columned hall at Erebuni that marks a decisive break 
with prior, longstanding Urartian architectural practice. As is well known, 
standard Urartian columned halls are marked by long, narrow proportions and 
by no more than two rows of columns or, on occasion, two rows of rectangular 
piers.16 Indeed, the adoption of this new multi-rowed design, in which the roof 
of the hall was supported by five rows of six columns, indicates that the build-
ers of the hall were willing to look well beyond the former borders of Urartu for 
inspiration, no doubt in search of novel designs that would dignify the standing

of those who sought to revive Erebuni’s ancient repute. In this instance, inspi-
ration would seem to have come from neighboring Media, where columned 
halls of very varied columniation are attested from at least the 8th century b.c. 
onward at Godin Tepe, located 150 km southwest of Hamadan. Above all, the 
largest of the halls on the summit of the Godin mound exhibits a very similar

rectangular ground plan with five rows of six columns, not to mention a more-
or-less continuous internal mud-brick bench.17
Remarkably enough, however, certain features of the thirty-columned hall 
at Erebuni can be used to show that its planners still felt themselves to be 
more than minimally connected to significant aspects of Urartian religious be-
lief. In this context, the builders of the new hall can be seen to have retrieved 
many light gray andesite blocks from (in all probability) the ruins of the early 
7th-century temple of Haldi at Karmir Blur, and to have made prominent use 
of these same finely dressed ashlar blocks in the north and east walls of the 
spacious new hall.18 If we recall, moreover, that Sarduri i, the grandfather of 
­Menua, went to the trouble of transferring monumental stone blocks from the 
vicinity of his native town on the west side of Lake Van to his new capital at 
Van19 in order to mark his elevation to the Urartian throne, it is possible to 
imagine that the builders of the thirty-columned hall also sought to substan-
tiate their own succession to secular and religious authority in a somewhat 
similar way.
Even if no “standard temples” appear to have been built in honor of Haldi 
after the middle years of the 7th century, there is, in fact, every reason to think 
that the former principal deity of the Urartian pantheon continued to be vener-
ated at Erebuni. In this context the precise location of the thirty-columned hall 
at Erebuni seems to have been at least partly dictated by a desire to incorporate 
the north face of the northeast buttress of the 8th-century temple of Haldi in 
the south wall of the hall (Figure 15.2). In addition, since the color red was one 
of the attributes of Haldi,20 we may have an explanation for not only the strik-
ing fact that the innermost painted panel of the stepped niche in the entrance 
façade of the 8th-century temple was given “a solid, brilliant red color”21 (and 
for the fact that the adjacent, contemporary floor of the North Court proved 
to have been covered with a thick layer of red, clay-like soil),22 but even for a 
distinctly strange phenomenon that was noted during the excavation of the 
Columned Hall. In this latter case, I refer to the unexpected discovery that frag-
ments of reddish-buff stone from an unknown location were stacked against 
the inner face of each of the four walls of the new thirty-columned hall, where

they came to be hidden—and hence preserved—by the hall’s more-or-less 
continuous, carefully plastered mud-brick bench.23
A second site of unusual importance with reference to the present enquiry 
is Argishtihinili. Founded, like Erebuni, by Argishti i (778–764 b.c.), it stands 
on a tall rock outcrop near the center of the fertile Ararat plain, where, down 
to the third century b.c., its walls “were washed by the waters of the river 
Araxes” (Figure 15.1).24 Apparently unaffected by the violence that was visited 
on ­several of the strongholds that were erected by Rusa, son of Argishti ii,25 
Argishtihinili seems to have continued to flourish into Achaemenid and even 
Hellenistic times. Of special interest is the way in which a large, walled trap-
ezoidal area at the westernmost point of the eastern citadel came to be con-
verted into a multi-rowed columned hall with thirty-two columns (Figure 15.3). 
As at Erebuni, the hall was supplied with five rows of columns, in what was

Including the fortresses at Ayanis, Bastam, and Karmir Blur. (In this same context, cur-
rent studies suggest that Toprakkale could have been founded during an earlier reign. Cf.

very possibly understood to be a reference to a new, distinctive set of social 
values.
In the absence of detailed ceramic studies from Argishtihinili, the relatively 
secure post-Urartian date of the hall is perhaps best arrived at through a close 
study of its column bases. As Ter-Martirosov has pointed out, the numerous 
column bases in the hall do not subscribe to a single, uniform type.26 Instead 
one group consists of re-used basalt bases of the standard Urartian type, each 
with a finely dressed cylindrical upper part and with a very different lower part 
(consisting of a rough-cut block that was let into the floor). The second group, 
as the same author has noted, consists of a new form of base, carved from tufa. 
Accordingly, the planners of the hall would appear to have elected to use as 
many of the handsome, hard-stone Urartian column bases as were still readily 
available and to otherwise turn, for lack of a better solution, to a new type of 
soft-stone column base that the stonemasons of the day were no doubt able to 
reproduce with relative ease. It was not a notably elegant solution, but at least 
it allowed for the presumably all-important display of an impressive “forest” of 
columns in multiple rows.27
	
Chronological Issues
While the foregoing observations would seem to fortify the notion that 
the thirty-columned hall at Erebuni and the thirty-two-columned hall at  
Argishtihinili were each built in the late 7th/early 6th century (i.e. in the early 
post-Urartian period), at a time when architectural influences from Media 
were suddenly stronger than hitherto, no such chronological solution seems 
to have appealed to earlier researchers. To the detriment of both Achaeme-
nid and Urartian ­studies, most commentators simply opted for either an 
­“Achaemenid” or an “Urartian” date. Only a short time ago, for instance, ­Hilary 
Gopnik was persuaded, on the basis of such information as was available to 
her at the time, that the multi-rowed columned halls at Erebuni, Argishtihini-
li, and Altıntepe (Figure 15.1) each belonged to “Achaemenid occupations of 
­Urartian sites.”28 But since fresh evidence from Gumbati in Georgia,29 from

Qarajamirli in Azerbaijan,30 and from Beniamin in northwestern Armenia31 
has demonstrated that significant, representational sites of Achaemenid date 
in the ­Transcaucasus were not only associated with pottery of an ­Achaemenid 
character, but also—as often as not—by typical, Achaemenid bell-shaped 
stone column bases, it is no longer possible to suppose that the multi-rowed 
columned halls at Erebuni, Argishtihinili, and Altıntepe were each major mon-
uments of ­Achaemenid date.32
With reference to the latest currently available excavation reports on Ere-
buni, it is perhaps appropriate to add that the present re-proposed date in the 
middle of the 7th century for the fall of Urartu naturally renders obsolete all 
prior calculations that a local “late Urartian” occupation only ended in the first 
decade or two of the 6th century b.c. In other words all material that is so de-
fined in prior reports by the present writer should now be thought of as “early 
post-Urartian.”33
	
Concluding Remarks
Whatever factors may have conspired to ignite the tumultuous events that 
took place in or near the middle years of the 7th century b.c., the local entity 
that prevailed, and chose to build on a monumental scale at Erebuni in the 
early post-Urartian period, would appear to have been one that was still drawn 
to a number of the more memorable characteristics of the once powerful state 
of Urartu. It is evident, for example, that such a polity retained a lively regard 
for certain of the early seats of Urartian rule. In addition, there would seem

For details of the multi-rowed columned hall at Altıntepe, which possessed three rows 
of six columns, and which was erected during a distinct, second period of occupation, 
see Özgüç, Altıntepe i. Note also that halls with three rows of columns are markedly rare 
in the archaeological record. Indeed, the only other hall in the Near East with a simi-
lar columniation would appear to be, interestingly enough, the 7th-century columned 
hall (with three rows of four columns) that stood in the western half of the Median site 
of Tepe Nush-i Jan, located 60 km south of Hamadan. (Stronach and Roaf, Nush-i Jan i, 
155 ff).
33	
Note must also be taken of a recently published survey of the available evidence from 
Erebuni in which K. Ghafadaryan (“The Dating of the Multi-Columned Hall”) concludes 
that the multi-rowed columned halls from both Erebuni and Argishtihinili date to the 
end of the 7th or the beginning of the 6th century b.c. (even if such a date is taken in this 
instance to still represent a “late Urartian” period of occupation).

to be cogent grounds, based on archaeological evidence alone, for presuming 
that a perceptible reverence for the god Haldi comfortably outlived the fall of 
the Urartian kingdom. It is also very likely that the qualities of Urartian wall 
painting continued to be appreciated—and that numerous other aspects of 
­Urartian symbolism (expressed in different ways in different mediums) re-
mained in vogue into the early years of the 6th century b.c.34
Given these various circumstances, it is difficult to imagine that the Scyth-
ians were able to secure any very enduring benefits from whatever role they 
may have played in the overthrow of the Urartian kingdom. On the other hand, 
one or more of the various non-Urartian peoples that would appear to have 
been resident in Urartu over a very considerable period of time could con-
ceivably have risen in revolt against the Urartian royal house—and could then 
have left the intriguing early post-Urartian “signature” just described.
34	
It is not without interest, for instance, that a typical Urartian stone stamp seal was re-
covered from the early post-Urartian extramural settlement on the southeastern hill. See 
Stronach, et al., “Erebuni 2007,” 189–190 and plate 6.

Neo-Assyrian Views of Foreign Cities: A Brief 
Survey
Pauline Albenda
	
Introduction
This study considers select representations of foreign settlements carved on 
the stone panels that lined the walls of Neo-Assyrian palaces built at the sites 
of Nimrud (ancient Kalhu), Nineveh, and Khorsabad (ancient Dur-Sharrukin). 
The documentation of drawings and photographs made at the time of dis-
covery and the existing palace bas-reliefs together illustrate over 100 foreign 
settlements of different types. In this article they are generally identified with 
the term “city.” Singled out are cities that display distinctive architectural fea-
tures, such as the city plan or an unusual structure associated with the city. 
Oftentimes an enclosure wall fortifies a foreign city, and occasionally there is 
a second, outer wall. City images occur mostly in scenes that depict Assyrian 
military campaigns into foreign territories. Presumably, the Assyrian artists 
who created the narrative compositions had knowledge of the actual events 
and places described in the written accounts through personal observation 
and field sketches, or through an intermediary source.
One acknowledges, however, that city architecture depicted in narrative 
scenes followed the stylistic traditions developed up to that time. For example, 
renderings of cities outline their main features, and the size or scale of a city 
image is relative to its importance and placement in a given scene. Moreover, 
the depiction of a city focuses primarily on the elevation of its front exterior 
walls, and on occasion one or more additional structures occur within its con-
fines. In the absence of the use of linear perspective to enhance spatial depth, 
the renderings of cities with their respective architectural features tend to dis-
play a flattened view. Therefore, a degree of similarity among the various for-
eign cities is apparent, particularly among those of the ninth century b.c.e., 
which has led to the assertion that many images are stereotypical.1 Nonethe-
less, underlying this study of city images is the premise that Assyrian artists did 
endeavor to impart a degree of specificity of place, however naïve the image 
may appear to the modern-day viewer.

Two aspects of the Assyrian scenes that contribute to the visual displays 
of place and event are landscape and epigraph. Topographical elements serve 
to direct the viewer to a particular territory or location and are useful mark-
ers in any attempt to identify a foreign city. Assyrian texts rarely describe the 
architecture of a specific foreign city, except to mention whether it was a royal 
or fortified city.2 On occasion, a caption or epigraph carved on the stone slab 
identifies a city. The names of thirty-three cities are preserved on the Assyrian 
reliefs but, unfortunately, the names of several other cities illustrated on the 
bas-reliefs are illegible or lost. Explanatory descriptions also occur on the slabs, 
including those that were composed for eventual placement on the palace wall 
reliefs of Sennacherib (704–689 b.c.e.) and Ashurbanipal (668–627 b.c.e.).3
	
Foreign Cities
	
Views of the Ninth Century
As mentioned above, much artistic attention was given to the depictions of 
military actions that Assyria undertook against foreign polities, whether in 
open battles or in attacks against fortified cities and other settlements. In 
the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasirpal ii (883–859 b.c.e.), six foreign cities 
are illustrated in the upper and lower registers of stone panels that lined the 
walls of the throne room.4 Each panel, about 98 cm in height, was assigned 
a number at the time of its discovery.5 In addition, three cities are recorded 
in drawings of slabs that originated in the west wing of the palace, but were 
reused in the Southwest Palace of Esarhaddon (680–669 b.c.e.) at Nimrud.6 
A fourth city occurs on a panel that was discovered in situ in a corner of room 
wg.7 The ten foreign cities are unidentified and all are fortified. Triangular 
merlons ­surmount the battlemented city walls, and small circles in a row deco-
rate the upper walls of several cities (see below). Entrance into the respective 
walled cities is through an arched gateway flanked by two towers that extend 
beyond the wall. The gateway towers are generally crowned with a projecting

Neo-Assyrian Views of Foreign Cities: A Brief Survey
­battlemented platform, and small rectangular openings or windows on the 
gate towers of several cities indicate the presence of interior chambers.
Among the throne room bas-reliefs, panel B18a illustrates the partial view of 
a besieged walled settlement situated on a mound (Plate 16.1).8 A low, second-
ary wall extends beyond the main fortified wall and roofs the single arched 
entranceway. This wall is pierced with two small windows and links the flank-
ing towers. Visually the low wall contrasts nicely with the open area leading to 
the closed gate. The fortified settlement lacks both a second outer wall and a 
structure within the city itself. The absence of these architectural items may 
indicate that a fortress is here illustrated. The complete frontal side of another 
settlement, likewise identifiable as a fortress, occurs in the drawing of a now-
lost relief discovered in the Southwest Palace.9 This walled settlement, shown 
under attack, is built on a low mound. Entry is through a plain arched gate 
flanked by two towers. The illustrated view of the settlement is compact and 
rectangular, suggesting a square-type fortress. It may be noted that the Assyr-
ian use of square or rectangular forts for military purposes is documented on 
the decorated bronze bands from Balawat, dated to the reign of Shalmaneser 
iii (858–824 b.c.e.).10 Square fortress types of later date were excavated at sev-
eral sites in the Levant.11
Connecting throne room panels B5b–4b–3b display a fierce Assyrian assault 
against a strongly fortified foreign city.12 Assuredly, this illustrated foreign city 
is of major importance (Plate 16.2). Its four city walls are compressed into a 
relatively flat picture plane; however, in this carefully designed narrative the 
placement of the respective human figures does serve to convey an impression 
of spatial depth. Two outer walls protect the city wall with its main entrance 
leading into the city. The low outermost wall abuts a narrow body of water 
and represents the river wall. Beyond this is a second wall. In one section, the 
destructive actions of two Assyrian sappers reveal falling stones, which, from 
their shapes, can be identified as the ashlar masonry used to construct the sec-
ond wall. The third wall is the city wall that includes a prominent arched gate, 
battlemented with triangular and stepped merlons. The rendering of the outer

entranceway is somewhat elaborate. Despite its flattened appearance one may 
interpret the entrance complex to consist of the following features: the outer 
sides flanked by two tall towers; two piers or towers of lower height that either 
abut the entrance or, less likely, project outward to form a shallow gate; and 
the arched gate of a covered passageway leading into the city. It is notable that 
the height of the passageway wall is lower than that of the city wall. The fourth 
wall likewise contains an arched gate, but it is unclear whether it represents an 
inner city wall or a citadel wall. Behind the fourth wall at the left side is a single 
tall tower, which probably connects to a side wall.
The identity of this multi-walled city remains unknown. Among the many 
military assaults against foreign cities described in his royal inscriptions, 
Ashurnasirpal ii mentions Madara, located in the lands Nairi, north of Assyria, 
as having four walls surrounding the city.13 In the same region, Assyria attacked 
the city of Tela, which was protected by three walls.14 Comparable to the attack 
so vividly illustrated on panels B5b-3b, the Assyrian royal inscriptions describe 
by means of tunnels, battering rams, and siege towers, the assaults against the 
fortified cities of Kaprabu in Bit-Adini, a region east of the Euphrates River, 
and Udu in the lands Nairi.15 The information cited in the royal texts makes it 
doubtful that a specific city can be identified with the one depicted on pan-
els B5b–3b. The narrative continues on adjacent panel B6b, on which cattle 
are displayed above a line of men and women being led away from the multi-
walled city. The inclusion of domestic animals hints at the notion of a pastoral 
community affiliated with the embattled city.
Other foreign cities illustrated on the ninth century bas-reliefs are 
­distinguished by their immediate surroundings. Three walled cities are direct-
ly connected to a large body of water. Two of these cities, shown on throne 
room panel B27-B28 and one from the west wing of Ashurnasirpal’s palace, 
are discussed elsewhere.16 The third city associated with a body of water is 
represented on panel B17a (Plate 16.3). This city is depicted at the right side of 
an open landscape, and it is bounded by a swirling river of some length that 
extends from the foreground into the distant horizon. The city is supported 
by rows of artificial stone works set against the water. Despite the absence of

land beneath the stone foundation, the depiction seems to indicate that the 
city is located on an island. Its façade shows four towers, two of which flank 
the closed arched gate and are notable for the three windows on their respec-
tive projecting platforms. Behind the city wall is a second structure that likely 
represents the residence of the local ruler. This building consists of a crenel-
lated solid wall, except for an open passageway with a tower at each side. The 
pair of windows on each tower indicates interior chambers. On the outer wall 
stand several inhabitants whose submissive gestures complement the retreat-
ing actions of the three figures swimming toward the island. One unfortunate 
swimmer has arrows in his back, resulting from an attack by Assyrian archers 
on land who advance from the left side of the scene.
The pictorial narrative of panel B17a fits well with Ashurnasirpal’s successful 
battle against the land Suhu in the fortified city of Suru, whose ruler afterward 
retreated into the Euphrates.17 The island city depicted in the scene probably 
represents Anat (modern Ana). This city is located in the middle Euphrates, 
and at the time it belonged to the territory of Suhu.18 The inclusion of Anat in 
the landscape scene sets the specific setting for the fleeing persons swimming 
toward that city. Perhaps the self-contained narrative scene in upper panel 
B17a is continued on lower panel B17b. The two scenes would satisfy the prin-
ciple of “action and consequence,” as defined by Winter.19 Panel B17b shows a 
line of bound captives led towards the presence of the Assyrian king who is 
depicted on panel B18b. Above the captives are items of booty, which include 
tusks of elephants. These items have led to the suggestion that the city illus-
trated in B17a is Carchemish,20 a royal city of Hatti situated on the west bank 
of the Euphrates.21 Carchemish is mentioned as the city whose ruler, Sangara, 
gave numerous items of value, including elephant tusks, to the Assyrian king. 
Sangara also furnished military units for Ashurnasirpal’s army that afterwards 
proceeded on its march to the coastal region of the Mediterranean Sea.22 There 
is, however, no mention of an attack against Carchemish, as already noted.23 
Thus the identification of the city depicted on panel B17a with Carchemish

has been questioned.24 On a related matter, the rulers (or governors) of Suhu 
and Lubdu, located in the Middle Euphrates region, gave five live elephants 
as tribute to Ashurnasirpal ii.25 Moreover, a decorated bronze band discov-
ered at the Assyrian site of Balawat depicts elephant tusks among the items 
of tribute that Kudurru, the ruler of Suhu, presents to king Ashurnasirpal ii.26 
Ashurnasirpal ii claims to have hunted and killed 30 of these large animals,27 
an indication that tusks taken from killed elephants were also available to the 
Assyrian king.28 From the combined pictorial and written evidence, therefore, 
I conclude that the city on panel B17a represents Anat, or perhaps a nearby city 
in the land Suhu that is located along the middle Euphrates.
	
Views of the Eighth Century
Slabs with carved decorations intended for the walls of the palace of Tiglath-
pileser iii (745–727 b.c.e.) were discovered in Nimrud at two different places. 
One location was in the center of the mound, where many stone slabs were 
found lying on the ground, and the other was in the unfinished Southwest Pal-
ace of Esarhaddon, where the slabs were reused for lining the walls. A por-
tion of the exposed bas-reliefs has been published and consists of those that 
were photographed, preserved, or documented in Layard’s original drawings.29 
There has been an attempt to connect several slabs based on actual and prob-
able joins.30 In addition, a tentative geographical arrangement of the scenes on 
the reliefs was made by comparing them with the written accounts of Tiglath-
pileser’s military campaigns.31 More recently, additional connections have 
been made, based on the seven-line and twelve-line inscriptions in the band 
that separates the upper and lower registers of the individual slabs.32
Twelve foreign cities are depicted among the published bas-reliefs of Ti-
glath-pileser iii, three of which are identified with a caption. The named cities

are As-tar(a)-tu (Ashtaroth), Ga-az-ru (Gezer), and Upa-[x].33 Of the remain-
der of foreign cities that occur on the reliefs, one is considered here. The city 
survives on a slab that is fragmentary and without provenience, listed by Bar-
nett and Falkner as slab number 44 (Plate 16.4).34 The scene on this slab, which 
on the basis of style is assignable to the period of Tiglath-pileser iii, gives a 
view of an assault against a fortified settlement in mountainous terrain.
Slab 44 (Plate 16.4) depicts a battlemented defensive wall situated at the 
base of a high hill or mountain, which is topped by a large building. At the 
right, a helmeted soldier, armed with a sword at his waist, stands on the wall 
and bends downward, while gripping what appears to be a round shield. To 
the left is a tall isolated tower, upon which two soldiers actively defend them-
selves by throwing stones against their two armed attackers. Three other de-
fenders fall headlong through space toward the ground. The attackers, armed 
with spear and round shield, advance upward on a ladder that extends to the 
top of the isolated tower. It is interesting to observe that both the attackers 
and defenders are military persons, as evidenced by their helmets of different 
types.35 The spearmen ascending the ladder wear a helmet with a tall forward-
curving crest, a type worn by Assyrian auxiliaries who also appear on the relief 
depicting the city Upa-[x]. This particular city is probably located in the Me-
dian territory of Bit-Kapsi. In his ninth regnal year (736 b.c.e.), Tiglath-pileser 
iii attacked and defeated Upash, king of Bit-Kapsi, and destroyed his cities.36 
The fortified place shown on slab 44 may represent a settlement in the same 
general region that was attacked in the course of the Assyrian king’s campaign.
A notable detail on slab 44 is the unusually large building situated on top 
of the semi-circular mountain. The building stands alone, its importance indi-
cated by its size, by the protective battlemented wall at the base of the moun-
tain, and by the defensive efforts of its inhabitants against the Assyrian militia. 
The building, presumably square or rectangular in plan, has a flat roof, and 
attached at each side is a massive tower that rises slightly above the roof. To-
gether, the widths of the two towers are equal to that of the façade of the build-
ing, which consists mainly of a closed door within a stepped recess. Near the 
top of the door is a narrow band that extends across the entrance and curves 
up in the center, the significance of which is unclear (compare a similar detail 
shown above the door of the defensive wall in Plate 16.7). The building type

shown on slab 44 recurs in a scene on a now-lost bas-relief of Sargon ii, discov-
ered in room 14 of his palace at Khorsabad.37 The scene depicts the Assyrian as-
sault and capture of the city Kisheshlu, located in western Media or Mannea.38 
In one section at the bottom of the scene is a small isolated round hill, and on 
top stands a building with a tower attached to each side. A third version of the 
twin-towered edifice is illustrated on the obverse of a small stone stele, broken 
into two halves, that was discovered at Til Barsip and is datable to the reign of 
Tiglath-pileser iii.39 Near the building is a pair of tall standards topped by the 
Sin emblem, one to a side. The standing figure of the god Sin appears above 
the flat roof. The reverse of the stele depicts a four-winged human-headed ge-
nie. This particular image reinforces the significance of the towered building, 
which surely is identifiable as a religious shrine or temple. The Til Barsip stele, 
then, provides the evidence that the twin-towered building illustrated on slab 
44 is also identifiable as a religious structure. Moreover, if one considers the 
ground plan of the illustrated building as essentially square, it would be similar 
to the plans of Urartian tower temples.40 To judge by the narrative depicted on 
the Sargon relief in room 14, the battle scene represented on slab 44 likely takes 
place in the western Zagros region.
The subject matter on this slab is of interest, in terms of the region depict-
ed. The composition begins at the baseline with a close-up view of an assault 
against enemies defending a fortified wall. The central area of the composi-
tion, illustrated as a relatively empty landscape, leads upward to the upper-
most section, where there is a prominent edifice upon a high hill. Here, one 
gets the sense that the Assyrian assault takes place in mountainous terrain, 
and that a permanent settlement is to be found, not behind fortified walls, 
but at some distance in a high elevation. The scene carved on this slab would 
agree with views of the Zagros region, where Tiglath-pileser iii undertook 
military campaigns against the rulers of various city-states located within that 
expansive and rugged territory. In particular, I suggest that slab 44 represents a 
settlement in the western ranges of the Zagros, perhaps including the lands of 
the Medes.41 Tiglath-pileser’s campaign against the Medes is recorded on his

stele from Iran, probably erected in 736 b.c.e.42 It is significant that the Assyr-
ian king received as tribute large numbers of horses from the submissive city-
rulers of the Medes,43 since Assyrian cavalry units took on importance during 
this period.44 Although of later date, the wall reliefs of Sargon ii (721–705) give 
evidence that horses from the Zagros region were ridden by its inhabitants 
and also presented as tribute.45 Tiglath-pileser iii may have had the tribute 
of horses represented on his palace reliefs, if those are the animals that are 
depicted on two stone fragments discovered at Nimrud.46
In the palace of Sargon ii at Khorsabad, foreign cities were illustrated on 
the stone panels that lined the walls of six rooms. Except for a few surviving 
fragments, their representations are known only in the sketches and line draw-
ings made at the time of discovery in 1843 and 1844.47 Epigraphs name the six 
cities illustrated in the lower register of panels that lined room 2. A seventh city 
that was depicted in the upper register of doorway panel H2 lacks an epigraph. 
An eighth walled city, situated by a wide river, was partially preserved in the 
upper register of panel 28. Four cities were represented in room 5 (three with 
epigraphs), one city with an epigraph in room 13, and two cities with epigraphs 
in room 14. Each of rooms 1 and 3 contained the lower register of a panel on 
which there appeared a foreign city. Their respective upper portions were de-
stroyed and may have included an epigraph. The military campaigns against 
the foreign cities illustrated on the bas-reliefs occurred in different years of 
Sargon’s reign.48
On panels 1–3 of room 1, a line of Assyrian archers and shield bearers attack 
defenders on a walled structure that is situated upon a flat plain; however, only 
a segment of the structure is illustrated at one end of the panel.49 Although the 
scene on the adjacent panel is mostly lost, it is evident that there was no intent 
to complete the image of the walled structure. Instead, one finds indications of 
an Assyrian assault against a city in a mountainous terrain. The two combined 
episodes suggest that the walled structure actually represents a fortified outer 
wall or an abbreviated version of a fortress, which served to protect the city

that was originally depicted on the adjacent panel. Even though it is composed 
differently, the battle scene in room 1 recalls the subject matter displayed on 
slab 44 dated to the reign of Tiglath-pileser iii and described above.
Among the many illustrations of foreign cities that were carved on the stone 
panels in the palace of Sargon ii is an architectural detail of interest that recurs 
among the depictions of four different cities. This is the rectangular crenella-
tions that surmount a fortified wall or an edifice. Their use on a defensive wall 
is illustrated in room 1, described above. A second example of the use of rect-
angular crenellations is found in the simple outline of the city wall displayed 
on panel H1 in room 2.50 Eight overly large torches extend upward to empha-
size the destruction of the city, identified by an epigraph as Bit-Bagaya.51 In 715 
b.c.e. Sargon ii captured the city, which he later restored and renamed Kar-
Adad (or Kar-Ishtar). It was located in the vicinity of the city of Harhar (see 
below) in western Media. The renaming of Bit-Bagaya indicates that, contrary 
to the scene on the relief, it was not entirely destroyed by fire. Moreover, the 
absence of structural features or other additional details leads to the conclu-
sion that Bit-Bagaya was likely a fortress.
The fragmentary panel in room 3 (Plate 16.5) provides a third example of 
the use of rectangular crenellations.52 There the crenellations surmount an 
isolated tower set atop a high forested mountain. On another mountain, but 
of lower height, is a fortified city. Unfortunately the top of its defensive wall 
was destroyed at the time of the panel’s discovery, as was the upper body of 
an Assyrian soldier drawn large, who stands at the left side. Small flat-roofed 
buildings line the base of this mountain. The image of a long stream of wa-
ter, described as a river or waterfall, connects the two mountains by flowing 
from the upper part of the high mountain, downward to the ground level of 
the second mountain. One wonders whether the image of the flowing water 
may be an artistic interpretation of a notable feature associated with Ulhu, a 
city mentioned in the Assyrian texts as located at “the foot of Mount Kišpari” 
(or Kišpal).53 In that place an important source of water, apparently located 
within the boundary of the city, flowed through man-made canals and irri-
gated the land. It should be noted that a double line extending across the cen-
tral section of the lower mountain probably represents a canal that waters the

grove of trees immediately above. The city of Ulhu was at the time in Urartian 
controlled territory. Its identification with the archaeological site of Qalatgah, 
southwest of Lake Urmia, has been proposed by Muscarella, who, among other 
scholars, considers that the military route of Sargon ii in 714 b.c.e. went north 
along the west shore of Lake Urmia, after reaching the southern shore of the 
lake.54 This suggested itinerary has been questioned.55 Other proposed routes 
that Sargon ii may have taken along Lake Urmia have been noted.56
A fourth foreign city that illustrates the use of rectangular crenellations oc-
curs on a stone panel in room 13 (Plate 16.6).57 The caption states, “the city of 
Musasir i besieged and captured.”58 The main edifice is the temple of the Urar-
tian god Haldi. The Urartian temple is unusual for its gable-roofed building set 
upon a high podium. Six broad pillars or columns extend from the podium to 
the roof. In addition, a triangular pediment appears above the entrance. In the 
background, on both sides of the temple, are rows of attached storied build-
ings topped with rectangular crenellations. It would seem that the use of rect-
angular crenellations was a common architectural feature at Musasir, which 
was located in the area north or northeast of Rowandiz.59 If one accepts the 
notion that the use of rectangular crenellations is characteristic of a particular 
region that includes Musasir, we may conclude that the foreign cities depicted 
in rooms 1, 3, and 13 are to be located within a reasonable distance from one 
another. This conclusion would be based on the assumption that the Assyr-
ian artist intended to impart a degree of accuracy in the visual descriptions of 
foreign places. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the fortified city 
of Bit-Bagaya, depicted in room 2, was situated in or near Median territory, a 
considerable distance from the city of Musasir. This raises the question of the 
regional extent, as well as cultural influence, of the use of rectangular crenella-
tions, since the published drawings of the various foreign cities with epigraphs 
give no further examples.
The named city of Harhar,60 illustrated on panel 7 in room 2, deserves com-
mentary for the different styles of architecture that appear within its walls 
(Plate 16.7). The city was first sketched by Botta in 1843 and redrawn by Flandin

in 1844.61 Both drawings reveal a city that is constructed on the side of a high 
hill or mountain, near a river indicated by a series of horizontal wavy lines. 
Fronting the river is a solid outer wall of some height that protects the city. 
Outside this wall, the line of human figures impaled on long stakes is a visual-
ization of the defeat of Harhar in 716 b.c.e. and its severe aftermath.62 Further 
up the hill is the defensive wall whose height is evidenced by the five stories of 
windows on the individual buttresses. Still further up the hill, two structures 
of different styles are illustrated. In Botta’s sketch the large rectangular build-
ing at the left side has an arched door, as well as a row of four windows below 
the high roof. The second structure is represented as a row of piers or columns 
supporting a narrow flat roof, lacking additional details. However, in Flandin’s 
drawing (Plate 16.7) the rectangular building is now shown as two separate 
battlemented towers. In this regard, we may surmise that surface damage in 
this section of the relief occurred during the time between the first and second 
drawings. The columned structure remains the same in the later drawing. At 
the very top of the high hill is probably the citadel, where there are several 
buildings of different styles. It may be remarked that in the early sketch the two 
buildings at the left side are only partially preserved, while in the later drawing 
these two structures are intact. The two buildings in this drawing appear to be 
of the twin-tower type; that is, religious structures. At the extreme right side 
is a more elaborate building, probably the residence of the local ruler. Most 
unusual is that a section of this building rests upon a retaining wall composed 
of cut stones. The placement of the residence at the summit of the high hill 
satisfies a protective requirement against potential military attack.
Both the sketch and drawing make it apparent that the city of Harhar func-
tioned as a religious and residential center. The city surely contained several 
temples, as well as a sizable structure representing an edifice with doubtless a 
columned hall. The use of columns does recall the pictorial image of the temple 
at Musasir. At the late ninth century b.c.e. site of Hasanlu, southeast of Lake 
Urmia in the Solduz valley, several buildings had contained columned halls.63 
Columned halls also occur in the eighth century b.c.e. Urartian fortress at Ere-
buni.64 It should be mentioned that columned halls were ­discovered in the

seventh-century Median settlements at Godin Tepe, located in the Kangavar 
Valley, and at Nush-i Jan, located near Malayer.65
To some extent Urartian influence underlies the architectural styles of the 
columned structure and tower temples that are depicted on the Harhar bas-
relief. The site of Harhar is thought to be sought in the vicinity of the central 
or eastern Mahidasht, close to the land of the Medes.66 Assyrian kings did re-
ceive tribute of horses from this general region, and in the inscription on the 
stele of Sargon ii discovered at Najafehabad67 the king states that the people 
of Harhar rebelled against their city chiefs and held back the tribute of horses 
for four years. This led to the Assyrian attack against that city and to its defeat. 
Afterward, the Assyrian king restored the temples and renamed the city Kar-
Sharrukin.68 The destruction of the city of Harhar is mentioned in the inscrip-
tion on the rock relief of Sargon ii at Tang-i Var in Iran,69 but the extent of this 
action must have been limited.
	
Views of the Seventh Century
A majority of the over seventy rooms and courts of the Southwest Palace of 
Sennacherib (704–689) at Nineveh were lined with carved narrative scenes 
that oftentimes were designed to fill the entire height of the stone panel. The 
increase in height allowed for compositions that broaden the landscape set-
ting and extend the subject matter across several panels. Scenes dealing with 
Assyrian military campaigns predominate. Unfortunately, many of the bas-
reliefs survive in drawings only.
Among the representations of foreign cities depicted in room 1 (throne 
room), the city depicted on panel 23 is of particular interest (Plate 16.8). In ad-
dition to the line drawing made at the time of discovery, a photograph of early 
20th-century date illustrates the slabs in situ.70 The city is placed near the bot-
tom of the relief, and its approximate total height of some of 1.5 m ­accentuates

its importance within the larger narrative shown on panels 21–22.71 Below the 
wall of the city, in the foreground of the composition, is a neat row of five 
shrubs. They consist of two grapevines, one shrub with pomegranates, and two 
of a plant not readily identifiable. The last plant recurs among Sennacherib’s 
parkland of trees, fruit-bearing shrubs, and other plants.72 One plant men-
tioned among Sennacherib’s descriptions of the royal park is the “wool-bearing 
tree” that is sheared and the wool woven into garments.73 This is the cotton 
plant. Elsewhere I suggest that its identification with the unnamed plant illus-
trated on slab 23 is a viable option.74
The enclosure wall of the city on panel 23 is topped with round shields, a 
defensive method also used on the fortified walls of Lachish.75 Thus the city 
may be sited in Philistia. Within the city is a large edifice, and standing upon a 
tall tower is a human figure turned toward the scene depicted on slabs 21–22. 
There, the narrative is divided into several registers of combatants that include 
foreign cavalry and chariots and Assyrian cavalry in aggressive attack. An oval 
military camp and small fort in the distant landscape (upper registers) com-
plete the scene. Along the bottom are trees of equal height that continue the 
row of shrubs. The narrative presented on panels 21–23 recalls Sennacherib’s 
third campaign against the west, in particular the Assyrian battle against the 
combined Egyptian and Philistine forces that included those from the city of 
Ekron. This battle took place in the plain of Eltekeh.76 During the same cam-
paign an assault against Ekron, ancient Amqarruna,77 was made. A likely pos-
sibility is that this city is illustrated on slab 23. Excavations conducted at the 
Iron Age ii city of Tel Miqne-Ekron have yielded large numbers of olive presses 
and loom weights. These finds, dated to the seventh century b.c.e., have led to 
the conclusion that the city was an important industrial center for olive oil and 
textile production.78 The very long row of trees and fruit-bearing shrubs placed

near eye level on panels 21–23 does impart the notion of the city’s importance 
for its agricultural products.
Room 48 of the Southwest Palace had three connecting passageways. The 
carved scenes on its paneled walls consisted of the Assyrian army’s march 
alongside a long stretch of a broad river.79 As recorded in the drawings, the 
military advance leads past a city walled with equidistant buttresses or towers 
(Plate 16.9), from which foot soldiers carry away booty. The military event ends 
at a fortified camp wherein sits the Assyrian king on his throne. The city is set 
a short distance from the river, and the groups of buildings situated on both 
sides of the broad river are especially attractive. No epigraph identifies this 
city, which has been thought to represent a city in Phoenicia.80
The illustrated enclosure wall of the foreign city is unusual. Except for an 
arched doorway, a continuous pattern of vertical lines and niches covers its 
entire surface. Architecturally, this decorative motif represents a series of en-
gaged half-columns and recessed niches. The utilization of one or both of these 
decorative features for outer wall surfaces has a long history in Mesopotamia, 
and seems to occur on religious structures only.81 It may be mentioned that an 
elaborate arrangement of plain half-columns and recessed niches was applied 
to the outer walls of late Babylonian religious edifices excavated at Borsippa. It 
is likely, then, that the city represented in room 48 is in Babylonia, purportedly 
of religious importance. Still visible within the walled city is the lower section 
of a very large rectangular structure, and one conjectures whether it represents 
a religious edifice; that is, a temple. Elsewhere within the city, Assyrian soldiers 
cut down tall trees that grow in a garden or park.
The residential buildings shown on both sides of the sloping hills are of 
different heights, have solid walls with the exception of an occasional square 
window, and plain doors of the post-and-lintel type. However, several are ex-
ceptional for details of their design (Plate 16.10). In particular two large edifices 
adjacent to the walled city and several others situated on the opposite hill il-
lustrate, below the flat roof, what is described as windows ornamented with 
columns having “capitals in the form of the Ionic volute” and used as balus-
trades.82 An alternate interpretation of the area underneath the roof, consid-
ered here, is that of an exterior wall composed of narrow pillars or columns

and open to view, and on the far side a colonnade of the so-called Aeolic style83 
that perhaps surrounds another open section of the roof. If this interpreta-
tion is correct, then illustrated on these edifices is what may be identified as a 
columned rooftop court. In any event, the application of columns in the upper 
part of the buildings does add richness to the architecture. A modest version of 
the Aeolic capital was utilized for Sargon ii’s columned edifice set in his royal 
park,84 and a later variant of the Aeolic capital occurs on columns of Sennach-
erib’s and Ashurbanipal’s edifices set in their respective royal parks.85
From the rooftops of many buildings there “issue flames,” as described by 
Layard.86 Their shapes are alike: each curves outward from a point at the apex, 
and is filled with a series of fine lines that arch out on both sides from the 
center. These particular shapes do not appear elsewhere on the bas-reliefs of 
Sennacherib, and where the flames of burning wood do occur, their lines curve 
upward.87 It may be that what is represented are clipped shrubs or trees that 
grow from the roofs of the buildings, notwithstanding that their appearance 
differs from the varieties that are seen in open landscapes. If these are indeed 
plants, then the rooftop gardens on the bas-relief illustrate a precursor of what 
was later known as “the hanging gardens of Babylon.”88
Thus, as shown by its distinguishing architectural features, the foreign city 
illustrated in room 48 must have been of importance, and probably served as a 
religious center. Its defeat and apparent destruction is revealed by the cutting 
down of trees within the walled city, the complete absence of its inhabitants, 
and the taking away of its fine furniture by Assyrian soldiers. As concluded 
above, the enclosure wall faced with elaborate decoration in relief points to 
a city in Babylonia, a region in which Sennacherib undertook military cam-
paigns. Specifically, the Assyrian king states that the palace in Babylon was 
plundered during his first campaign, and its buildings and temples destroyed 
during his eighth campaign.89 Borsippa was another Babylonian city whose 
men fought against the Assyrian army; however, no mention is made of a direct

assault against that place. In the absence of an epigraph, it remains uncertain 
which city in Babylonia is represented in room 48.
Foreign cities are included among the narrative scenes depicted on the bas-
reliefs from the North Palace of Ashurbanipal (668–627 b.c.e.) at Nineveh. 
Room i contained, in one section of bas-reliefs (panels 7–8), a series of mili-
tary scenes related to a battle against the Elamite army that culminated in two 
views of foreign places on panel 9 (Plate 16.11). This panel is divided into an 
upper and lower register, in each of which appear different types of architec-
ture.90 The upper register shows a temple notable for its pair of round-topped 
standards, and alongside is a palace whose entrance is embellished with a pair 
of columns on cushion-shaped bases. The impressive complex of buildings is 
protected by triple walls, and below these walls a cuneiform inscription identi-
fies the city. Only part of the inscription is preserved, and a tentative transla-
tion suggests Der, Babylon, or Arbela. The one presently accepted is the last 
named city.91
In front of the temple stands the Assyrian king who performs a religious 
ceremony before an incense burner and table; attendants witness the event 
(see the upper left side of Plate 16.11). On the ground in front of the Assyrian 
ruler is a large severed head that Barnett briefly mentions as “restored.” He 
remarks that several prepared captions on clay tablets—not found on the bas-
reliefs—state that the severed head of Teumman, king of Elam, was taken into 
the city of Arbela,92 thus supporting the identification of Arbela for the city 
shown in the upper register. Elsewhere I have discussed the problem of the 
severed head, with reference to the difference between what is illustrated in 
the original drawings and what appears on the existing fragment.93 No head 
is indicated in the original drawings, as opposed to what is now visible. If one 
accepts the evidence of the original drawings, then the proposed identification 
of the walled city remains open.
The lower register includes several isolated buildings within a landscape 
containing palm trees, a river, and small streams. The central feature is a four-
storied religious structure—a ziggurat—set upon a high mound. At the base 
of the mound is what appears to be a tower temple, but probably represents 
the main entranceway. The wall on the lowest level of the ziggurat is designed 
with a series of equidistant buttresses and two doorways. Two towers frame

the ­entrance on the second level, and in the level above is still another en-
trance. Two large bull heads decorate the uppermost facade of the ziggurat. 
The inclusion of palm trees in the surrounding landscape precludes a location 
in northern Mesopotamia. Therefore the setting is either Babylonia, accepted 
by Barnett,94 or more likely Elam where the battle scene depicted on the pre-
ceding panels takes place. Two Elamite cities suggested for the location of the 
ziggurat illustrated on panel 9 are Madaktu and Susa. The city of Madaktu is 
shown on a bas-relief from room 33 of the Southwest Palace of Sennacherib,95 
dated to the reign of Ashurbanipal. Illustrated within that city is a large edifice 
built on a high mound, but it is not of the ziggurat type. In his eighth cam-
paign (ca. 646 b.c.e.) Ashurbanipal went against Elam. During that time he 
entered Susa, and destroyed its ziggurat and sanctuaries. Statues of Elamite 
kings and bull sculptures that adorned the temple gates were among the many 
items counted as spoil.96 Other captured Elamite cities include Dur-Untash, a 
city identified with the modern site of Chogha Zanbil.97 This site is significant 
for its ziggurat, constructed in the thirteenth century b.c.e., which is still pre-
served to the third of five original levels.98 The regular alternation of buttresses 
and niches on the terrace walls of the ziggurat is probably the model for the 
later, illustrated version. Moreover, the excavators of the Chogha Zanbil ziggu-
rat found pairs of animals in front of its entrances, which included bulls, and 
one is reminded of the bull heads that decorate the ziggurat on the bas-relief.
An architectural detail of interest in the lower register of panel 9 concerns 
the door of the isolated tower temple located at the lower left section of the 
scene, atop which three human figures stand and turn in the direction of the 
preceding military event. Their imploring gestures are a subtle continuation 
of the Elamite submission to the Assyrian army after battle. The door of the 
temple is apparently constructed with projecting blocks or corbels support-
ing the lintel. This feature of the door recurs elsewhere on the bas-reliefs that 
depict walled cities in Elam. Two of the cities are each identified as Hamanu.99 
Their representations originate in different rooms, are dissimilar in general ap-
pearance, and possibly show different cities that were labeled with the same

name. A third example of the Elamite door style occurs on a bas-relief from 
room M in the North Palace.100 There, Assyrian soldiers demolish a city located 
in Elam. This city, it is suggested, is Susa. From the pictorial evidence, one may 
assume that a particular method of constructing the post-and-lintel for a door 
was utilized in Elam.
	
Concluding Remarks
The brief study of permanent settlements—in this paper defined as cities—
that are illustrated on the Neo-Assyrian bas-reliefs provides useful informa-
tion regarding their original appearance. Generally, the pictorial views of these 
settlements were restricted to frontal elevations. In the course of several cen-
turies, architectural structures particular to a region or place took on added 
interest for purposes of illustration, as well as for their distinctiveness. For ex-
ample, there are the elevated views of an Urartian tower temple, a columned 
temple, and an Elamite ziggurat. Topography was another factor in the display 
of place. The construction of walled cities and fortresses depended upon the 
surrounding terrain, especially in matters of defense. Thus, as is often revealed 
in the narrative scenes, architectural ingenuity must have served an impor-
tant function. Cities in territories west of Assyria were usually situated near 
a water source, and occasionally they were built on a high mound. In eastern 
territories, which are known for their mountain ranges, cities were oftentimes 
constructed on the slopes of a mountain. Occasionally, landscape elements 
provided a means to identify foreign cities located in a specific territory. In 
addition epigraphs, descriptions in the Assyrian texts, and archaeological evi-
dence support the identification of a locality depicted on a particular stone 
relief.
In summary, the pictorial art of the Assyrian bas-reliefs that originally deco-
rated the palaces was designed according to established principles in matters 
of narrative compositions. Nonetheless these artworks give insightful views of 
the permanent and sometimes complex settlements of peoples residing in the 
various regions beyond Assyria.

The Role of the Petra Great Temple in the Context 
of Nabataean Archaeology
Martha Sharp Joukowsky
Abstract
Archaeological investigations of the Petra Great Temple by Brown University began 
in 1993 and continued until 2009 with the goals of documenting Nabataean culture 
as reflected in its architecture, artifact corpus, and subsistence patterns. Excavations 
have uncovered the largest architectural precinct in the legendary Nabataean capital. 
­Ceramics, numismatics, lamps, and architectural iconography have provided bench-
mark dates for the first century b.c.–first century a.d. phases for the building of a 
distyle temple, remodeled into a grand tetrastyle edifice which is again refurbished in 
the later first or early second century a.d. with the insertion of a theater as its central 
focus. The chronological framework together with the excavations offers a view not 
only of the precinct itself, but also of the cultural interrelationships between ­Petra 
and other sites in Nabataea. Still unknown to many are the unique features of the 
­Nabataean cultural canon.

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
	
Overview of the Nabataeans
An extensive history of excavations attests to the cultural and historical signifi-
cance of the Nabataeans and their homeland in Nabataea. Our understanding 
of the Nabataeans must incorporate the results of archaeological investiga-
tions and reflect the composite results of projects with Nabataean remains. 
Since this submission focuses on the Petra Great Temple, we begin with a brief 
historic overview of the Nabataeans and the urban development of Petra, and 
then move to the Petra Great Temple excavations.
The Edomites established their kingdom east of the Wadi ‘Araba, but in 
552 b.c. Edom was destroyed by Nabonidus.2 From what we know, the next 
chapter in the rebirth of Nabataea takes place at the end of the fourth century 
b.c., when a nomadic tribe of tent-living pastoralists and caravan traders in 
the Wadi ‘Araba3 and/or the Hejaz (in northwest Arabia) occupied the region. 
It has been assumed that the Nabataean tribe originated in the vast Arabian 
Desert, but in reality there is no archaeological or historic evidence to support 
this claim.4
The earliest textual presence of the Nabataeans is reported in 312 b.c., when 
they are referred5 to as nomads living in tents, trafficking perfumes, aromatic 
herbs, and spices from southern Arabia to the Mediterranean. Controlling the 
Arabian trade routes in the Persian and Hellenistic periods were the south 
­Arabian tribal kingdoms of the Sabaeans6 and the Minaeans, renowned as mer-
chant traders of aromatics. These kingdoms had collapsed by 100 b.c., ­creating 
a power vacuum, and the Nabataeans replaced them as the premier overland 
caravan traders between south Arabia and the Mediterranean.7 ­Directing their

their Sanctuaries,” 118).

efforts to the control, servicing, and taxing of the merchants of this profitable 
trade, and negotiating extortion and protection payments made to various  
tribes, the Nabataeans created a monopoly over the trans-Arabian caravan trade.  
They also harvested bitumen (asphalt),8 balsam,9 and sulfur from the Dead Sea 
and transported them to Egypt.10 These north Arabian nomadic pastoralists, 
wandering through the inhospitable desert with their flocks of sheep, goats, 
and camels, had become traders of exotica11—frankincense and myrrh, which 
they carried by caravan to ports on the Eastern Mediterranean. Travel through 
the desert with its unrelenting heat, dust storms, marauding tribes, and pirates 
could be a treacherous journey unless the traveler had firsthand knowledge of 
water resources. Nabataean acquaintance with trade routes spawned an exper-
tise in the location of desert watering holes—sources of water they kept secret 
and unknown to others.
When the Nabataeans became sedentary is not known.12 In time they con-
trolled trade and communication from the Arabian Peninsula to Syria, and 
to the Mediterranean ports of Gaza and Rhinocoura.13 They also became ac-
complished hydraulic engineers, architects, and agriculturalists. Although 
they were on the periphery of the great Greek, Roman, and Egyptian14 cul-
tures of their time, as well as Judea and centers on the eastern littoral of the 
­Mediterranean, the Nabataeans also traded goods with regions further to the

Which the Egyptians used for the embalming process. There were hostilities be-

berthed on the Red Sea.

Sinai, and amethyst and semi-precious stones from Egypt. Also traded and available in 
Nabataea were an aromatic oil produced by a shrub or a tree, known as labdanum, used 
for flavorings and perfumes, and bdellium, a sweet aromatic gum resin used in perfume 
manufacture.

east, including India and China.15 The hundreds of awesome Asian, elephant-
headed capitals at the Great Temple find India as their source; food seasonings 
and textiles were also brought from the east.
Trade and the taxation of caravans transporting goods through Nabataean 
tribal territory allowed its leaders to amass vast wealth. By the end of the sec-
ond century b.c. farming villages had been established along the trade routes 
from southern Jordan16 to the Negev, at sites like Oboda (‘Avdat),17 Sobata 
(Shivta),18 Mampsis,19 Nessana,20 and Elusa, and further into the Sinai.21 By the 
late first century b.c., Nabataean territorial control included areas of south-
ern Syria, Jordan, the Negev of Israel, the Sinai, and northwest Saudi Arabia. 
Although, it is not clear just how large their trading empire really was, it may 
have extended from modern-day Yemen to Damascus and from western Iraq 
into the Sinai Desert and the Negev.
As indicated, we know that early in their history the Nabataeans became 
­involved in international trade that extended well beyond the areas of their 
territorial control.22 Although it is attested that they were engaged in piracy on 
the Red Sea in the Hellenistic period, there is no evidence for a ­Nabataean navy. 
However, the Nabataean army protected the trade routes. In the Periplus,23 
anonymously written at the time of Nabataean king Malichus ii (a.d. 40–70),  
extensive Nabataean international commercial activities are documented

as seaports became commercially more important. With increasing competitiveness, the

from southern Arabia to the Red Sea into Egypt, and across the Indian Ocean. 
To avoid the monsoon seasons, the Egyptians realized that cargo could be 
transported by sea more safely, quickly, and economically than by caravan, 
thereby avoiding Nabataean middlemen and overland transportation expen-
ditures. Trips between seaports were cut from months to weeks or from weeks 
to days, resulting in the unpleasant fact that Nabataean control over the trade 
routes was threatened. This turn of events cast a negative impact on Nabataea’s 
trading revenues.24
	
Nabataean Sites
Nabataean settlements appear in environmentally different regions—in the 
inhospitable stony desert uplands of southern Jordan and in the igneous and 
rugged sandstone mountains of northwestern Arabia (the Hejaz) as well as into 
the Sinai (Figure 17.1).25 Lying along the trade route, Petra was selected as their 
principal city, isolated on the very edge of Arabia just below a fertile limestone 
escarpment. By this time, Parr states, “economically they [the Nabataeans] had 
moved away from their Arabic background and become Levantine.”26
Beyond Petra several Nabataean sites have been systematically investigat-
ed, including those in southern Jordan, such as Beidha27 (adjacent to Petra), 
and in northwestern Arabia,28 the Wadi ‘Araba south of the Dead Sea, the 
Negev,29 and Syria.30 Northeast of Petra are an important Nabataean pilgrim-
age site, Khirbet et-Tannur, located atop a steep hill,31 and the settlement of

To some degree this increase in monumental building was a consequence of shifting 
trade patterns, for by the mid-first century a.d. there was an appreciable decline in over-
land commerce.

Widespread with sand dunes, gravel plains, and often overlaid with lava flows—­producing 
little in terms of cultivable soils. Rainfall is less than 100 mm a year, and generally it is lost 
in flash floods. This is the home of the nomadic pastoralist and cameleers.

earliest remains are dated to 8/7 b.c., but the major building takes place in 
the second half of the first century a.d., which is also the time to which Khir-
bet et-Tannur can be dated. Nabataean remains further north include Gerasa 
(Jerash)33 and Umm el-Jimal,34 and other sites found along the trade routes 
from Damascus to Bostra.35 South of Petra is the site of Humayma,36 a well-
researched site along the trade route, and further south is remarkable Medain 
Saleh or Hegra37 in northwestern Saudi Arabia with its prolific rock-cut Naba-
taean tombs, all of which can be dated securely to the first century a.d.38
	
Aretas iv
In the late first century b.c., the historian Strabo39 reports that the Nabataeans 
were ruled by a democracy led by a king, and that Petra40 had a thriving interna-
tional community intermixed with Romans and foreigners who lived in stone 
houses, took pleasure in banqueting, and administered their relationships dis-
cretely and peacefully. The most remarkable Nabataean king, King Aretas iv (9 
b.c.–a.d. 40),41 described as “the lover of his people,” reigned for 49 years and 
oversaw the massive building of Petra.42 Thanks to Aretas iv and relative peace,43 
Petra now became a new city (Figure 17.2). The city’s physiognomy was trans-
formed, with significant settlement expansion as its population multiplied.44

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
With political centralization and a dense population concentration, Petraean 
urban development imitated the great cities of the day—Alexandria and Se-
leucia—with the dominance of public and royal architectural construction 
and massive irrigation projects. Sculpture schools with new tastes thrived as 
the demand increased. Craft specialization is reflected in the archaeological 
record by a large-scale pottery industry, luxurious stucco modeling and gild-
ing, prolific minting of coinage, and the intensification of desert agricultural 
activities. The picture is of a city filled with luxury, wealth, and prosperity. This 
is reflected in the archaeological record not only in Petra but in at least a dozen 
other strategically placed cities in the Nabataean realm, from Jawf, an oasis at 
the south of the Wadi Sirhan in Arabia, to Bostra in the Hawran in the north, 
and cities in the Negev to the west.45
Under the great King Aretas iv, the Nabataeans reshaped Petra with an ur-
banization program of enormous proportions for their capital city and tribal 
seat.46 Village culture gave way to a dynamic, cosmopolitan urban culture. In 
45	
Two Nabataean triumphal arches at Bostra belong to this period. In the Late Nabataean 
period, Bostra may have become the capital of Nabataea. Bostra was the capital of the 
Roman province of Arabia.

this “Nabataeanization,” Petra demonstrated status and wealth, reinforcing 
the authority of the king who commissioned the construction of monumental 
structures, and encouraged his elite to carve their tombs out of the living rock. 
Within a few years Petra prospered, grew, and dramatically changed its appear-
ance more radically than at any other time in its history.
Rome coveted the control of Egypt’s Red Sea ports, entrée to the Nile, and the 
lucrative Red Sea–Indian Ocean trade. In fact Nabataea became a client king-
dom of Rome47 from 63 b.c.,48 and on 22 March a.d. 106,49 the Roman emper-
or Trajan officially annexed the Nabataean kingdom.50 At this time, ­Nabataea 
was converted from an independent autonomous kingdom to a Roman prov-
ince. Petra became a Roman Imperial city, Nabataeans became Romans, and 
Nabataean fighting forces were absorbed into the Roman army. The emperor 
Trajan established a Roman legion51 in the new province, called “Arabia,” with 
Bostra as its capital and Petra as a secondary capital. He also constructed the 
Via Nova Traiana along the former Nabataean caravan route of the King’s High-
way. Thus from a.d. 106, when the Nabataean kingdom was annexed by the 
Romans, life continued in a renamed Roman province, ­Arabia Petraea,52 and 
thereafter in the so-called province of Third Palestine and Arabia.
	
Petra
The rediscovery of the Nabataeans began 200 years ago in 1812, when the Swiss 
explorer, Johann Burckhardt,53 succeeded in locating Petra nestled in the hills 
of Edom. With Bedouins living within its hidden valley, Petra had been unrec-
ognized by the western world. The city was first identified as “Nabataean” in 
47	
Roman policy was to leave more remote parts of the empire in the hands of a friendly 
­client king. Bowersock, Roman Arabia, 30–31.
48	
After Pompey conquered Jerusalem.
49	
This is only 16 years later than the last years of Aretas iv’s reign.
50	
The kingdom was annexed through the governor of Syria, Cornelius Palma. The Roman 
emperor, Tiberius, may have visited Petra, for his inscriptions imply that he did; the em-
peror Hadrian toured Petra in a.d. 131, and renamed the site for himself, “Hadriane Petra.”
51	
See Graf, “The Nabataean Army and the Cohortes Ulpiae Petraeorum.” A legion is the ­major 
unit of the Roman army consisting of 3,000–6,000 infantry and 100–300 cavalry. This  
Roman legion was known as the “iii Cyrenaica.” The Nabataeans are said to have orga-
nized a camel corps of 1,000–2,500 camels.
52	
This includes Petra, southern Jordan, the Hejaz (northwestern Saudi Arabia), and cities of 
the Negev—basically the former Nabataean kingdom.

culture by G. and A. Horsfield in the 1930s.54 Traces of the Nabataeans can be 
found over a period of some 800 years, although Nabataea was an autonomous 
kingdom for only 400 years. The apogee of the Nabataean period dates from 
the second century b.c. through the third century a.d., but the Nabataeans 
can be said to have reached their zenith in the first half of the first century a.d.
The orientalist Rudolf-Ernst Brünnow and the classicist Alfred von Domasze-
wski surveyed Petra in 1897–1898, and published an ambitious three-volume 
scientific mapping project, Die Provincia Arabia (1904–1909).55 During World 
War i, Walter Bachmann, Carl Watzinger, and Theodor Wiegand56 investigated 
the city structures under the auspices of the Committee for the Preservation of 
Monuments of the German-Turkish Army. Walter Bachmann, working in the 
1920’s, is credited with the identification of various sites in the central city,57 
including the site he identified as the “Great Temple.”
Not until the second half of the 20th century were systematic excavations 
undertaken that revealed a vigorous provincial city replete with elaborate wa-
ter systems, temples, theaters, shops, houses, and baths. In the last 20 years 
many archaeological projects, of which the Great Temple project is one, 
have elucidated Petra and its multicultural life during its Nabataean, Roman, 
and Byzantine periods. Today the Petra Survey Project58 has recorded more 
than 3,197 Petra features and monuments, and there may be more yet to be 
discovered.
The Wadi Musa59 dominates the layout of the city. However it is not ori-
ented on a strict city grid, for the two sectors of the central city lie on the north 
and south slopes of the Wadi Musa, the city’s main artery. The wadi carved its 
flow from a cleft in the rock through the Siq60 and thereafter into the valley. 
Unfortunately vestiges of the massive bridge works that in antiquity connected 
the north and south sectors of the city and carried traffic over the Wadi Musa 
have collapsed into the wadi and await excavation and restoration.

In addition to numerous temples, Aretas iv financed other projects. See Nehmé, “Petra

628 monumental tombs, 516 small religious monuments, 188 cisterns, 118 banqueting 
rooms, 101 shaft tombs, 22 wine-presses, 34 nefesh, groups of nefesh, or niches including a 
nefesh, and seven temples or possible temples.

Average rainfall in Petra is ca. 150 mm per year. When the Nabataeans settled 
in Petra they imported the knowledge of water resources, and, with irrigation 
technology, they knew how to harness its supply. They built terraced diversion 
dams (qanats) and irrigated the land to support a thriving agriculture within 
the city. Perennial springs created a rich fertile soil for the cultivation of cere-
als, fruits, and vegetables. Depending on the season, people sometimes farmed 
and at other times herded.61 Besides the natural fortification the Siq provided, 
two successive lines of city walls were constructed, one dating to the Naba-
taean period and the other to the third century a.d.
Scattered over the site there is a seemingly boundless series of ruins62 end-
lessly continuing into the hills beyond. Most people associate Petra with its 
striking rock-cut monuments63 and fantastic High Places of worship,64 and 
the hundreds of Nabataean rock-cut tombs and triclinia.65 Besides the tombs, 
most of these buildings date to the Nabataean period, the time of kings  
Obodas iii (28–9 b.c.) and Aretas iv (9 b.c.–a.d. 40), before the Romans 
annexed the city in a.d. 106. The most notable rock-cut structures are the Al-
Khazna, the Djinn blocks, the multiple tombs in the so-called Street of Façades, 
the theater66 constructed during the first half of the first century a.d., and the 
Palace, Urn, and Corinthian Tombs of El-Khubta, built in the third quarter of 
the first century a.d. On the south hill of Ez Zantur67 overlooking the cen-
tral city are the private, lavishly decorated,68 freestanding house-palaces with

At Petra these many High Places of worship could be located on any natural elevation—
on the tops of sandstone outcrops, mountaintops, and rock spurs where the Nabatae-
ans offered sacrifices to their principal god, Dushara or Dusares. The most celebrated  
High Place is on the Zib Atuf ridge with two obelisks carved out of the living rock.  
These High Places are generally appointed with rock-cut altars, cisterns, water basins, 
basins with drainage channels, water channels, and sometimes triclinia (infra n. 65) for 
religious meals.

cisterns and peristyle courtyards of the Nabataean and Roman periods,69 and 
on the el-Katute slope are further freestanding domestic dwellings.70 Both sites 
enjoy picturesque views of the central city. Also located on the north side of 
the Wadi Musa are the Nabataean North Ridge Tombs 1 and 2.71 Just east of  
Petra is the Nabataean site of Khirbet Brak,72 and Wadi Sabra to the north  
of Petra has a small theater, built in the Nabataean period. Beyond the central 
city is the grand Ed-Deir (“Monastery”), the largest of the Nabataean rock-cut 
monuments, dated to the last quarter of the first century a.d.
The lively town-planning and construction activities of kings Obodas iii 
and Aretas iv enriched Petra with a main avenue running from the Siq through 
the Outer Siq, and this became the pivot for the spatial planning of both the 
northern and southern slopes of the central city. There is ample evidence  
of a rapid and dynamic architectural development in the heart of central Petra. 
For here, in a state of ruin and excavation, are Petra’s three monumental, free-
standing Nabataean temples73—the Temple of Winged Lions,74 directly across 
the Wadi Musa from the Great Temple, the Great Temple75 with its adjacent 
Pool and Garden complex,76 and the grandest edifice of all, the mammoth Qasr 
al-Bint, located to the west of the Great Temple.77 These three temples78 are 
­collective religious public spaces aligned along the streetscape79 and oriented

Ez Zantur is important, for here we find the transition from tent encampment (ez i) in 
the early first century b.c. to stone-built houses in the late first century b.c. Hundreds of 
rock-cut chambers also served as houses for the Nabataeans. Examples of Nabataean cave 
dwellings have been recovered recently in the Great Temple Residential Quarter, and are 
dated to the time of Aretas iv.

to the flow of the Wadi Musa.80 Located a few steps beyond the access81 to the 
Great Temple at the end of the Roman Street is a monumental entrance to the 
Qasr al-Bint, the triumphal Temenos Gate.82 Dated by the excavators, the con-
struction of the majestic Qasr al-Bint was begun in the reign of King Obodas 
iii and continued under the energetic reformist King Aretas iv.83 ­Roman and 
­Byzantine buildings in Petra are also noteworthy;84 however, since our focus 
is the Nabataean period, we return to Aretas iv and his building of the Great 
Temple. With vast reserves in the state coffers and as long as the caravans from 
Arabia brought profits from the exotica trade, kings like Aretas iv could under-
write their interests in the urban renewal of the capital city.85
Lacking any architectural traditions, these former nomads borrowed Hel-
lenistic architectural ideas, which they reworked and adapted to their own 
needs. They may have hired architects and city planners from other great cit-
ies in the region to train local craftsmen. In order to propagandize Nabataean 
phases it was a gravel path. The street was paved in the first century a.d. or later, and at 
the same time columns were added to a portion further to the east of the Pool Garden 
complex and the Great Temple. See McKenzie, The Architecture of Petra, 35–36. For an 
analysis of the shops lining the street, see Kanellopoulos, “Architecture of the Shops and 
Colonnaded Street in Petra.”
80	
Typical of Nabatataean temples, there is a lack of uniform alignment, underscoring the 
Nabataean penchant for orientation according to the terrain.
81	
These steps are not the original Nabataean access to the Great Temple precinct. They 
were constructed in the Roman–Byzantine period. As far as we know, the sole Nabataean 
access to the precinct was via the Great Temple West Entry Stairway.
82	
Wright, “Structure et date de l’arc monumental de Petra,” and “Petra: The Arched Gate.” 
The gate was rebuilt in the Roman (Trajanic) period as the entry into the grand paved 
temenos (180 m × 100 m)—the sacred enclosure of the Qasr al-Bint sanctuary. This gate 
might have imposed control over the accessibility of the temple precinct.

Important later monuments include the tomb of a governor of Roman Arabia, T. Annius 
Sextius Florentinus, built in the Hadrianic period, or a.d. 129; a Roman Imperial Cult 
Building (Reid, The Small Temple), and the Great Temple Roman and Byzantine Baths 
(infra n. 123). Byzantine monuments include the Petra Church, Fiema, et al., The Petra 
Church, and Fiema, “The Byzantine Church at Petra.” For the architecture of the church, 
see Kanellopoulos, “Architecture of the Complex.” For a thorough discussion of Petra in 
the Roman period, see Bowersock, Roman Arabia; also see Fiema, “From the Annexation 
to Aaron.” For the Blue Chapel, see Bikai and Perry, “Petra: Blue Chapel Complex”; for the

power and assert control of the Nabataean kingship in the very heart of Petra, 
the king’s city planners, engineers, and architects must have searched for new 
ideas and techniques, and where better to find them, but in the great cities 
of their day.86 The king and the elite of Petra were in a position to support 
craft specialists,87 which is indicated by all three temples, with their celebrated 
Nabataean architecture88 and sculpture. Designed by anonymous architects, 
these structures were built by a huge cast of masons who are unknown to us, 
and were decorated by numberless unnamed sculptors and painters—all of 
whom executed their craft with a Nabataean artistic program. Impressive in 
scale, these buildings were erected to rival other capital cities of the day in 
opulence and grandeur—Egyptian Alexandria, Syrian Seleucia-Antioch,89 as 
well as monumental Herodian cities.90
For all three temples, Nabataean stone workers quarried materials close at 
hand—Petra is surrounded by abundant sources of sandstone and, to a lesser 
degree, limestone, and imported wooden beams were used to stabilize build-
ings against earthquakes. Judging from the vast number of monuments, work-
ers were involved in the cutting and carving of stones as well as the processing 
of polychromatic stuccos and imported marble to embellish buildings.91
	
The Petra Great Temple
Located on the El Katute slope south of the Wadi Musa, Nabataean masons in-
geniously chiseled away 11 m of bedrock, fashioning a bedrock platform for the 
86	
These officials must have held prominent positions in Nabataean society. Contractors, 
architects, and city planners who implemented the king’s artistic program may have be-
come a new wealthy class.
87	
For the story of Petra’s passage from village to urban center—that time before the Great 
Temple was constructed—only faint vestiges remain of the memories lying buried be-
neath the precinct. Clearly there was wholesale expropriation of the city center and de-
molition of the central city’s tents and huts, and whatever else was there.
88	
Rababeh, How Petra Was Built.
89	
Although most of the remains of Alexandria and Antioch are lost to us, these cities must 
have had a powerful influence on Nabataean city planners, architects, and sculptors.
90	
Herod is famous for his prolific building projects, including the expansion of the Second 
Temple in Jerusalem, the building of fortresses like Masada and Herodium, buildings at 
Samaria-Sebaste, the Winter Palace at Jericho, and the founding and architectural realiza-
tion of Caesarea Maritima.
91	
No marble quarries exist in the Petra surround. Whatever marble was used to embellish 
these buildings was imported, and the few marble sculptures in the round were most 
probably imported as well.

of 915 m elevation to 890 m. The approximate 24 m difference is divided into 
a tri-tiered terraced complex with the Propylaeum at the same height as the 
Roman Street.93 The middle tier is the Lower Temenos, and the highest is the 
Upper Temenos that rests at the same elevation as the temple. The temple pre-
cinct covers 7,560 m2 or ¾ of a hectare. Whatever existed previously on the site 
where the Great Temple now stands was demolished—the earlier Petraean ar-
chitectural fabric is lost to us.
Knowing that water resources were essential to the precinct, Nabataean 
engineers tapped the ‘Ain Musa to the east and the ‘Ain Braq to the south to 
capture a plentiful flow of water. In these early days, masons were also under-
ground chiseling away the walls for a “Great Cistern” with a massive subterra-
nean canalization system that extended throughout the site.
Three main cultural periods—Nabataean, Roman, and Byzantine—are 
present in the Great Temple’s archaeological record. Nabataean life at the Great 
Temple comprises five site phases (Site Phases Pre-i to Site Phase v), pre-first 
century b.c. to a.d. 106. The Roman Period follows (Site Phases vi–viii), a.d. 
106–363, and thereafter is the Byzantine–Modern period (Site Phases ix–xiv), 
a.d. 363 to modern times.94 The Great Temple’s last remains date from the 
second half of the fifth century a.d. The site was completely abandoned in the 
mid-sixth century a.d. The five Nabataean construction periods, Site Phases 
Pre-i through Site Phase v, have been the focus of our excavations. Many of the 
structures built in earlier phases continued to serve the precinct well after the 
Roman annexation, and some were even remodeled to serve other purposes.
Beginning in 1992–1993, Brown University excavations at the Great Temple 
have uncovered the Nabataean temple and several complexes of detached an-
cillary buildings including a West Entry Stairway, Residential Quarter, Baroque 
Room complex, and the Great Cistern.95 We now highlight the Nabataean ar-
chitecture and sculpture of the Great Temple component complexes, begin-

West Entry Stairway
A conspicuous feat of Nabataean structural engineering is the grand West 
Entry Stairway of 48 extant steps (Figure 17.3: C), which takes the visitor from 
the Roman Street, past a West Propylaeum entry up to the Upper Temenos 
and the Roman–Byzantine Bath Complex. This monumental stairway was 
constructed in Site Phase iv, first century b.c.–first century a.d., and it was 
in use until its collapse in Site Phase xi, as a result of the a.d. 551 earthquake. 
Following the slope of the precinct, this grand limestone stairway is com-
posed of five extant stair flights leading to four platform landings.97 Between 
the two uppermost flights of stairs and the west wall is a terraced landing 
where a sacred nefesh98 accompanied by a betyl99 were installed. This instal-
lation must have served as consecrated space, and is considered part of the 
ceremonial landscape of the precinct for the commemoration and memorial-
izing of an individual, family or kinship group.100 A further flight of 14 steps 
leads to a now destroyed landing at the top of the stairs, bringing the visitor 
to the level of the shaded West Triple Colonnade of the Lower Temenos. As 
was mentioned earlier, there are many High Places in the city, and this nefesh 
installation may be considered a satellite holy place and part of the sacred 
geography of the Great Temple.
97	
This stairway is 37.20 m in length by an average width of 4.60 m (east–west).
98	
For a discussion of aniconic Nabataean representations, see Patrich, “The Formation of 
Nabataean Art,” and his comprehensive analysis in book form published the same year, 
The Formation of Nabataean Art. Nefesh is a Semitic word meaning “spirit” or “breath/
inspiration of-the-genius,” or the soul of a person. It refers to a symbolic memorial stele 
associating the essence of the deceased with the stone. The nefesh is a sacred Nabataean 
commemorative monument, carved to consecrate a person or a family, and to be the re-
ceptacle of the soul. This area therefore is symbolic space of spiritual connection between 
the living and the dead. It serves as a witness to a Nabataean shared belief, echoing their 
nomadic past. The Nabataeans celebrated the dead with pyramidal and conical sculptural 
forms (as can be seen in the Obelisk Tomb or the High Place in Petra). Often there is no 
burial associated with the nefesh, as in the case at the Great Temple West Entry Stairway 
platform.
99	
The betyl is a standing stone shaped as a cone, a rectangular, or pyramidal shaped libation 
stone signifying the god’s home and/or presence. It is usually freestanding and can be 
undecorated or bear schematic facial features. The Nabataeans represented their gods as 
betyls.
100	
Strabo (Geography 16.4.27) reports that the Nabataeans worshiped the sun (infra n. 168). 
The building of an altar at a high point in the West Entry Staircase confirms that it served 
as a Nabataean High Place.

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
	
The Propylaeum
The northernmost component of the monumental complex, the Propylaeum,101 
is sited on the Roman Street, 6.90 m east of the Qasr al-Bint Temenos Gate at 
its westernmost edge (Figure 17.4). Its full dimensions measure approximately 
55 m (east–west) × 12.5 m (north–south). Extending across the temple ­precinct, 
it is fronted by the Portico Wall, which in turn is divided by a later Central 
Staircase102 into two east–west sections. Positioned parallel to the street, the 
Portico Wall is the façade for the entire edifice, separating Propylaeum inter-
nal rooms from the sidewalk and street. In the south, the architecture of the 
Propylaeum is braced against the Propylaeum Retaining Wall into which the 
voussoirs of a subterranean vaulted cryptoporticus are set.103
West of the central staircase is the footprint of the Nabataean Propylaeum, 
divided into two long parallel east–west galleries that in turn lie parallel to 
the Roman Street. Entry to these galleries is from the West Entry Stairs. Visible 
from the stairs is a niche where twin aniconic limestone betyls were recov-
ered.104 Below this niche is a bench for offerings. Limestone paving in front 
of the betyl niche and offering bench provides a focus for the standing betyls, 
which clearly acknowledge the influence of local Nabataean deities, Dushara 
and al-‘Uzza. A large horned altar nearby provides additional evidence that 
this was a sacred space where ceremonial activities and spiritual connections 
took place, such as worship and feasting rituals.
Nabataean religion reflects a combination of local tribal deities105 and clas-
sical deities. The principal local and supreme deity of the Nabataeans was 
Dushara (the one of the Shara mountains), who was the dynastic deity of the 
101

The lowest steps lead to a platform, which may have served as a sacrificial altar for burnt 
offerings to the gods, for here a deposit of charred animal bones was recovered. Later 
steps, constructed in the Roman and Byzantine periods, were added above this platform 
to access the temple precinct.
103	
The principal features of the Propylaeum East are rebuilt in the Roman period, defining 
the east edge of the Great Temple precinct, consisting of four rooms plus a corridor posi-
tioned perpendicular to the Roman Street, all of which open onto its sidewalk. There were 
iron bars found across the thresholds of three of these rooms, indicating that they may 
have served for the storage of valuable goods. These architectural changes are beyond the 
scope of our focus on Nabataean architecture.

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
Nabataean kings.106 His mother and consort was al-‘Uzza, the patroness of 
the Nabataeans, who is identified with the Graeco-Roman Aphrodite.107 With 
time, Nabataean gods were eclipsed by or co-existed with classical deities.  
Dushara was identified with Dionysos (the god of wine) in the Nabataean pe-
riod and with Zeus and Hermes–Mercury in the Roman pantheon.
Ballista balls: Also found associated with the Propylaeum north gallery is a 
curious deposit of 423 ballista balls, arrowheads, and helmet cheek pieces, 
dated to around the official end of the Nabataean period, at the time of the  
Roman takeover in a.d. 106. We assume these were a stockpile of weapons 
either for defense or the result of an offensive attack on the Great Temple.108 
What is clear from the evidence is that a conflict was clearly in the offing, and 
the Nabataeans obviously were prepared to do battle.
The Roman annexation marked the official end of an independent Naba-
taea. In effect it was a real break with the Nabataean past, the moment in which 
Nabataea lost its trade revenues. The Nabataeans who remained conformed to 
Roman rule, and Rome imposed its values and practices upon their world. It 
would take years after the annexation to change the city’s Nabataean charac-
ter, but change it did, for the people were obliged to accept Roman administra-
tion, law, currency, weights and measures, and conform to its basic tenets.109
106	
The Shara mountains enclose Petra. Healey’s The Religion of the Nabataeans is an essen-
tial reference, and for discussions about Nabataean deities and their iconography regard-
ing specific sites, see Zayadine, Petra and the Caravan Cities. An excellent summary is 
provided by Zayadine in “The Nabataean Gods and their Sanctuaries.”
107	
The popular Egyptian goddess Isis was also celebrated at Petra and is associated with 
Aphrodite. Other lesser-known Nabataean deities are Shai’ al-Qaum, protector of the 
army and caravans; Manat (Nemesis), the goddess of human destiny; and the female de-
ity Alilat. The so-called Cult of al-Kutba, a scribal god, celebrates the classical Hermes–­
Mercury, the patron of divination, trade, travel, music, and the evening star.
108	
The Romans provoked hostilities and challenged the Nabataeans. We know the Romans 
mobilized their armies for an impending offensive against Nabataea. Transferred to ­Judea 
in a.d. 105 were the iii Cyrenaica legion from Egypt (5,500 men) and the vi Ferrata from 
Syria; in addition, two additional troops of cohorts (1,000 men) were readied for action 
(Bowersock, Roman Arabia, 79–81). Bowersock states, “On balance the evidence for the 
annexation of Arabia implies a military presence and perhaps even some military skir-
mishes, but no major conflict … Presumably the presence of Roman legionaries at the 
principal centers of the Nabataean kingdom was sufficient to persuade the Nabataeans 
not to undertake a major war which they had no hope of winning” (Roman Arabia, 81). 
Contra this idea, see Schmid, “The Nabataeans: Travellers between Lifestyles,” n. 183; 
Fiema, “The Roman Annexation of Arabia.”
109	
The Romans had made it clear that Nabataea was to be under their control, and hostile 
tensions are known south of Petra. Scholars are not sure if, to avoid these hostilities, King

The Lower Temenos
As can be seen in the Great Temple site plan (Figure 17.3: Q), the Lower Temenos 
plan (Figure 17.5), and in an aerial overview of the Great Temple (Plate 17.1), the 
Lower Temenos is a rectangular enclosure, extending from the Propylaeum Re-
taining Wall to the Lower Temenos Retaining Wall. Situated to the immediate 
south of the Propylaeum and elevated 8.50 m above the level of the street, the 
broad expanse of the limestone paved area extends 49 m (north–south) × 56 m 
(east–west), and rests at an average elevation of 898.70 m.110 This formal visual 
introduction to the Petra Great Temple proper—an epic expanse—is integral 
to our understanding of what King Aretas and his architects sought to achieve 
in the monumentality of the precinct and the aggrandizement of the city.
	
East and West Triple Colonnades and Cryptoportici of  
the Lower Temenos
Flanking the Lower Temenos plaza to the east and west are triple colonnades, 
with 120 columns (60 on each side, and 20 in each row).111 Rising to a projected 
height of 7.60 m, these column shafts are clad with a protective bright red and 
yellow plaster topped with a cable fluted white plaster.112 Roofed113 but open 
on the sides, the colonnades protected the residents from inclement weather 
or sun, and provided an airy meeting space for conversations while viewing 
whatever entertainment or ritual activity was taking place in the Lower Teme-
nos plaza.
The termination of the colonnades is marked by buttressed exedrae with 
five interior niches.114 Executed in the classical style, each exedra measures ap-
proximately 6.50 m in width by 5.50 m in depth. Two freestanding sandstone 
Rabbel ii and his advisors transferred themselves and the Nabataean capital from Petra 
north to Bostra, farther away from the conflict.
110	
These measurements do not include the West Entry Stairway.
111	
In addition, one or possibly two east–west colonnades comprised of 10 or 20 columns 
were erected across the north of the plaza at the junction of the Propylaeum and Lower 
Temenos.
112	
The width of the triple colonnades in both the east and west measures approximately 
12.50 m.
113	
Judging from the presence of ceramic roof tiles in the excavated fill, it can be reasoned 
that the colonnades are roofed.
114	
Each niche set into the curved walls of each sandstone apse measures 1.15 m in width and 
0.55 m in depth.

columns 0.60 m in diameter crowned with small elephant-headed capitals115 
front each of the exedrae.
The columns of the colonnades and the exedrae provide a spectacular and 
imposing border for the Lower Temenos plaza, and it might be argued that the 
Lower Temenos itself and the exedrae provided sacred spaces for the sharing 
of religious ceremonies, offerings, and cultic activities. We can picture the sub-
jects of King Aretas iv discussing the affairs of the day under the triple colon-
nades or finding quiet moments to worship in the exedrae.
	
The Great Temple Elephant-headed Capitals
Exquisitely carved, limestone, Ionic-style capitals embellished with four Asian 
elephant heads (Plate 17.2) crowned the columns of the Lower Temenos triple 
colonnades, two such columns fronted each exedra, and more were erected 
along the Propylaeum.116 The elephant must have symbolized victory and rep-
resented a reverence the Nabataeans held for the elephant as a sacred symbol 
of royal greatness, power, and honor.
The triple colonnades are 7.20  m in height,117 and the elephant-­headed 
­capitals themselves measure 41.5 cm. Hewn in limestone and coated with a 
light film of white plaster,118 one of the finest elephant examples is ­illustrated 
in ­Figure  17.6. Their discovery added a remarkable dimension to our

The columns rest on Attic bases and stand 1.20 m beyond the slightly incurving opening 
of the apse, which measures 6.80 m in width.
116	
Recorded in our databases are 1,052 elephant components belonging to the time of Aretas 
iv. See Lyttelton and Blagg, “Sculpture in Nabataean Petra and the Question of Roman In-
fluence,” 95, figure 6.4. We can only assume many of these heads were carried away—one 
was found inside the cistern of the Petra Church, published by Kanellopoulos in “Archi-
tecture of the Complex,” 174, figure 51, several were recovered from the Roman Street, and 
one serves as a doorstop in a local Bedouin home.
117	
Joukowsky, “Re-discovering Elephants at Petra!” charts the early discovery of the Great 
Temple elephant-headed capitals. A minimum of 536 and a maximum of 576 elephant 
heads must have adorned these columns. The drum shaft diameter ranges from 76 to 
89 cm. The capital from top to bottom consists of a 12 cm plain band over a 2.5 cm bead 
and reel, then a 15 cm high egg and tongue, and, below this, a plain, banded cornice with 
a tripartite molding in a double wave, measuring 12 cm in height. The base of the astragal 
measures 89 cm. The corner decoration is an elephant head with fan-shaped ears extend-
ing to just above the bead and reel into the same plane as the ovolo. Beneath the heads 
is a cascading acanthus leaf extending downwards which overlies both the bead-and-reel 
motif and the shaft. On the sides and resting on the elephant’s forehead is an incurving 
scroll with floral motifs. There is a plain band across the abacus.

The Upper Temenos
Two staircases approach the Upper Temenos on the east and west, each of 
which rises 6 m in height to connect the upper and lower temene of the ­temple 
precinct.119 Located on an elevated bedrock platform, the impressive Petra 
Great Temple Upper Temenos (Figure 17.7) comprises an irregular rectilinear-
shaped area at the rear of the precinct surrounding the temple proper.120 Mas-
sive perimeter walls enclose the Upper Temenos—the East Perimeter Wall is 
approximately 14 m in height.
To the temple’s north, at the north of the Upper Temenos, is a lavishly paved 
Temple Forecourt; to the east and south are broad paved plazas and passage-
ways, and above- and below-ground plastered cisterns, including the “Great 
Cistern.”121 Further to the west is the Nabataean Baroque Room complex with 
a settling tank, anteroom, shrine room, and the Baroque Room, so named be-
cause of a collapsed, lavishly modeled plaster ceiling unearthed there. Still 
further to the west are sited the extensive 11-room Nabataean Residential 
Quarter122 and an additional, massive Nabataean Cistern-Reservoir.123 In the 
following paragraphs, these complexes are described.

Found in the center of the Lower Temenos East–West Retaining Wall is an earlier staircase 
which was part of the original access to the earliest distyle temple of Site Phase ii. It was 
blocked off in antiquity by the construction of the Lower Temenos East–West Retaining 
Wall, when the east and west staircases to the forecourt were put in place.
120

This Nabataean cistern is adjacent to a series of vaulted rooms (Rooms A and B and the 
Tabun Room) built into the East Perimeter Wall.
122	
The Residential Quarter measures 15.48 m (north–south) × 9.22 m (east–west).
123	
To the northwest are the later-built, well-preserved 22-room Roman–Byzantine Baths, 
which fall later than our focus on the Nabataean period. The Roman–Byzantine Baths 
are a striking addition constructed adjacent to the west of the Great Temple, extend-
ing 47.91 m (north–south) × 30.84 m (east–west). Comparisons for the baths layout can 
be found in the Pompeian-style row-type baths (Yegül, Baths and Bathing in Classical 
­Antiquity, 61). These baths are designed with a spacious vestibule with a segmented dome 
and corner apses, a colonnaded corridor lined with columns, splash and plunge pools, a 
square open palaestra, a small square niched bathroom with a semicircular limestone 
washing basin, a benched apodyterium, frigidarium, ornamental pool, tepidarium, and

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
	
Subterranean Water Systems and the Great Cistern
To counteract water evaporation in an environment of dry air, high tempera-
tures, and relentless sun, a system of deeply dug irrigation channels led from 
the Great Cistern throughout the site. The Great Temple’s extraordinary sys-
tem of interconnected subterranean canalization and pipes transported wa-
ter some 135 m from south to north. Constructed under the Upper Temenos 
East Plaza with arches and coated with water-resistant plaster resting on heavy 
piers cut out of the bedrock, the Great Cistern was in use for a period of some 
400 years, from Site Phase i, the early first century b.c., when the subterranean 
canalization system was constructed, until Site Phases x–xi of the fourth–fifth 
centuries a.d. The cistern itself measures approximately 327.64 cubic meters, 
and held approximately 327,640 liters of water, making it the largest cistern yet 
documented in downtown Petra.124
	
Baroque Room
The location of the Baroque Room complex suggests that use of the room was 
restricted to a small group of the king and his elite, perhaps serving as an in-
ner sanctum for ritual activity. Built in Site Phase iv, first century b.c.–first 
century a.d., the Baroque Room was destroyed in Site Phase vi at a.d. 106. 
Measuring 5.77 m (north–south) × 17.26 m (east–west), with walls preserved 
3–4 m in height, this complex of three interconnecting, ornately decorated 
rooms plus a settling tank comprised an anteroom, paved with limestone 
	
a domed laconium with an oculus 5.17 m in diameter, several caldaria, one with an apse 
holding a labrum, and a praefurnium.
The complex is replete with heating and water systems—an extensive hypocaust 
system, a castellum, and a “well room” with four niches and a cavity underneath the 
­suspended floor for the accommodation of an extensive water system. The floors are em-
bellished with opus sectile marble slabs, and the walls were originally sumptuously faced 
with marble. Found in this complex was an important inscription for (M.) Aelius Aurelius 
Theon, the governor of Arabia between a.d. 253 and 259, who is mentioned in three in-
scriptions from Bostra. The complex’s original construction dates from ca. a.d. 106 into 
the early second century a.d. But additional features from the mid-second to the mid-
fourth century a.d. are the apodyterium, the bathrooms, and an anteroom. This complex 
was seriously damaged in the earthquake of a.d. 363, and judging from seismic events, its 
ultimate collapse was brought about by the implosion of the a.d. 551 earthquake.
124	
We must remember that the Pool and Garden complex (Bedal, The Petra-Pool Complex) 
is strategically situated adjacent to the Great Temple’s “Great Cistern” in the Upper Teme-
nos. Surely the “Great Cistern” also supplied water for its use.

hexagonal pavers, a shrine room with a sunken wall niche, and the luxurious 
“Baroque Room,” so called because of the substantial cache of parts of a lav-
ish three-­dimensional plaster ceiling that fell directly on the floor. This ceiling 
was sumptuously decorated with naturalistic designs and a spectacular cen-
tral medallion ­(Figure 17.8). This celebrated ornate circular ceiling medallion 
had at its center a pomegranate (or possibly a blossoming poppy) surrounded 
by a field of outward curling acanthus leaves framed by eight thin bands of 
­egg-and-tongue design arranged as an octagon.125 The molded surface of the 
medallion retains traces of red and blue paint as well as gilding.
	
Residential Quarter
Further indication of architectural remains and continuing further to the west 
is the Residential Quarter (Figure 17.9), unambiguously attesting to Aretas iv’s 
building program. Hidden under accumulated topsoil near the southern escarp-
ment, semi-flattened bedrock provided a stable foundation, for ­constructed 
within a series of caves were ashlar walls preserved to a height of 2 m subdi-
viding the area into 11 rooms. The general orientation was to the north leading 
into an open-air courtyard where a basalt rotating grain mill stood ready to 
receive the harvest. The Residential Quarter clearly demonstrates the diverse 
traditions of Petraean domestic architecture.
Rich in recovered artifacts, many of which could be reconstructed—cups, 
bowls, cooking pots, jars, and jugs—the interior rooms produced a massive 
volume of 32,349 smashed pottery fragments. With its production initiated 
by 100 b.c., Nabataean pottery becomes a horizon marker. Conical bowls of 
eggshell-thin quality used for eating were painted by Nabataean potters in the 
late Hellenistic and Early Roman periods. There were small cups for drinking, 
and jars and jugs for serving and storage. Other surviving remains included a 
wide assortment of small finds, such as coins, complete lamps, bone pins, and 
figurines. Due to the proximity of the contemporary Great Temple, it is highly 
probable that this domestic quarter was for a priestly family in charge of Great 
Temple activities. Its collapse took place in Site Phase vi.
125	
This element is enclosed by a plain band, which is itself framed by a thicker outer band 
featuring a molded tongue pattern. Surrounding all these elements is a double raised 
molding, also in octagonal form, with each vertex coming to a point at the circular border 
of the medallion in the manner of a star. In between the pointed vertices and the double 
border are eight lozenge-shaped fields, each with a concentric band of tongues outside an 
internal band of egg and tongue.

A Note about Great Temple Pottery
In toto the Great Temple excavations unearthed 317,997 fragments, including 
massive amounts of domestic wares, roof tiles, drainpipes, and loom weights, 
as well as 626 lamps and 93 mold- or core-formed anthropomorphic and

­zoomorphic figurines.126 Noteworthy from the excavations is the substantial 
quantity of Nabataean-style pottery, representing three developmental phas-
es.127 Many of these items were locally produced, but others indicate connec-
tions with the world well beyond Nabataea.
	
Temple Architecture
The Great Temple is located in the heart of this once-bustling central city. The 
footprint of the Great Temple precinct is clearly marked by its walls standing 
to a height of some 3–5 m. Walls were constructed with outer and inner sand-
stone ashlars128 with a wet-laid rubble fill and mud mortar in between; temple 
ashlar block surfaces were scored with Nabataean diagonal chisel strokes to 
hold decorative plaster in place.129 As with the Qasr al-Bint, the Temple of the 
Winged Lions, and most of the monuments in Petra, the façades of the Great 
Temple were brightly colored—in the case of the Great Temple the columns 
were covered with alternating red and yellow stucco on the lower columns 
with plaster white cable fluting above. Plaster cornices set high in the walls 
were elegantly dentillated, adding to the majestic polychromatic appearance 
of the building.
The Great Temple stood 34 m above the Roman Street. There were three 
main phases in its existence all belonging to the Nabataean period. The earliest 
incorporated a distyle building; the second phase included a tetrastyle porch 
façade added onto the front of the distyle building, and the latest remodel-
ing featured a theater, which was inserted into the center of the distyle build-
ing. Although these modifications represent different Nabataean periods, the 
peripteral interior design of the distyle temple remains the central component 
and integral to all three alterations. What is striking about the monumental 
reconfigurations of the building is the pace with which they were constructed.

Ashlar masonry does not appear before the first century b.c., but thereafter becomes a 
Nabataean building standard.

We must imagine that the whole building is embellished with a decorative plaster-stucco 
facing. Ling in his Stuccowork and Painting in Roman Italy provides a valuable synthesis of 
stuccowork and painting that can be paralleled at the Great Temple and other buildings 
in Petra. See also Zayadine, “Decorative Stucco at Petra and Other Hellenistic Sites,” who 
directs his study specifically to Petra and Nabataea.

333
The Role of the Petra Great Temple
	
The Distyle Temple
The north façade was a distyle (framed by two columns) structure built roughly 
facing north accessed by a Central Staircase,130 with peripteral columns and 
flanking antae with East, West and South Corridors. In Site Phase ii in the mid-
first century b.c., the distyle temple, shown in Figure 17.10, measured 30.07 m 
(north–south) × 18.36 m (east–west). In plan, the Great Temple’s main hall is 
rectangular. In the distyle architectural design, columns marked the corridors, 
with eight columns on each side and six at the rear.131 The columns were super-
posed on a pavement of which only the bedrock bedding remains, and corridor 
walls enclosed the colonnades.
The order132 of capitals from the central Temple structure is Nabataean Flo-
ral Corinthian.133 The top surfaces of the peristyle capitals are scored, indicat-
ing that they were prepared to bear an entablature. The level of a hypothetical 
wooden roof over the corridors is not clearly indicated except for the support 
indentations in the capitals and a copious roof tile collapse found in the south 
passageway, so it can be assumed that a roof sloping to the exterior had been 
built atop the East, West, and South Corridors. The façade must have been sur-
mounted by a compete entablature supporting a monumental pediment. The 
temple interior was embellished with paneled frescoed depictions reminiscent 
of the second style of Pompeian wall painting with architectural motifs as well 
as fine marbling resembling the first style (the so-called Masonry Style), which 
is terminally dated to a.d. 20.134

style Great Temple is its capitals (Plate 17.3), embellished with florals—­hibiscus 
petals and poppies135—intermixed with spiraling vine tendrils and fruits, pine-
cones, and pomegranates. The capitals of the Temple columns are a Nabataean 
variation of the Greek Corinthian, known as Floral Capitals or Floral Corinthi-
an, carved of white limestone. A tradition of the first century b.c.–first century 
a.d. as seen on these capital carvings is a horror vacui (fear of empty spaces) 
whereby the sculptor fills every area of the surface with decorative elements.

This original stairway was erased by the succeeding tetrastyle pronaos structure.
131	
The intercolumniation between the side columns measures 3.51 m, with 3.27 m between 
the rear columns.
132	
This is another variation of the Ionic order.
133	
The estimated heights of the columns, including base, drums, and capitals, are 15.50 m for 
the porch and 12 m for those surrounding the temple.

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
The Great Temple distyle capitals were manufactured in six parts; the lower 
order is comprised of two halves with the upper order of four quarters.136 The 
lower orders are some 1.17 m in diameter on the peristyle capitals and 1.50 m on 
the capitals from the porch. The reconstructed height of the interior capitals 
is 1.56 m;137these were carved with two rows of out-curving bushy acanthus 
leaves, the bottom row with eight leaves, and the top with ten. The upper order 
has corner volutes sheathed above and supported below by acanthus leaves, a 
design that has Alexandrian precedents.138 Two sets of vines spiraling inward 
toward each other form the helices on each of the four faces between the vo-
lutes. These vines terminate in poppy buds or pomegranates framed by flow-
ers. Other vines grow outward between the helices and volutes and terminate 
in flowers with pinecones at the center. Pinecone bosses framed by acanthus 
or grape leaves are inserted into each capital face at the center of the abacus.139
Other capitals closely related to those from the Great Temple were sculpted 
in a single order on the front lower storey of al-Khazna, which surely date to the 
same period. Striking are the capitals recently excavated in nearby Beidha140 in 
a building interpreted as an oecus or wine hall, including elephant-headed cap-
itals as well as floral capitals.141 The excavators allude to the Dionysian imagery 
connected to Nabataean floral capitals—vines, ivy, and masks on the capitals 
at Beidha.142 This is an extremely secure connection in the case of Beidha, for 
all of these symbolize the wine god of ancient Greece. Dionysos imagery was 
adapted as royal symbolism from the reign of Alexander the Great,143 and rul-
ers from the Hellenistic empires respected this tradition; Mark Anthony144 
­co-opted this association. Such imagery signified regal power, which was a large 
part of its appeal for the monuments commissioned by Nabataean royalty.
136	
The capitals were built from two orders, which were set together as two stacked drums.
137	
However the porch capitals, hypothetically, measure 2 m, with the upper orders having a 
base diameter of ca. 1.13 m. A typical Great Temple capital lower order measures 1.17 m in 
diameter, with a width of 0.77 m and a thickness or height of 0.78 m. The upper order is 
0.57 m in height, 0.82 m in width and 0.78 m in thickness. The pinecone boss is 0.45 m in 
length, 0.20 in width, and 0.78 m in thickness.

The Tetrastyle Temple
Originally conceived as a distyle in antis structure, the temple proper was 
modernized and expanded to include a tetrastyle in antis broad airy porch 
with perimeter East and West Walkways. In this modification in the time of  
Aretas iv, the outer walls were extended toward the front of the building, with 
four columns placed in antis, framed by two anta pilasters facing north.145 
This expansion of the temple, as shown in Figure 17.11, obliterated the distyle 
entrance steps. Over time this huge edifice dominated the Petraean skyline 
becoming a landmark for visitors and the focus for imperial celebrations. Con-
structed in the first century b.c.–first century a.d., this building measured 
42.50 m (north–south) × 35.5 m (east–west).146 A monumental sandstone stair-
way led from the Upper Temenos Temple Forecourt to access the building’s 
spacious pronaos vestibule, measuring 6.6 m (north–south) × 24.7 m (east–
west). In ­addition, there were broad entries from the East and West Walkways 
and corridors accessing the Pronaos, which was originally paved with irregular 
rectilinear flagstones atop sandstone-leveled bedrock.147
Like those of its distyle predecessor, the new temple porch columns were 
lavishly decorated with plaster colored in reds and yellows on their lower 
shafts with white cable fluting above. Four new larger capitals were carved for 
the new façade. Following in the same tradition, the refurbished Great Temple 
was richly decorated with pilaster reliefs, frescoes, molded plaster, and tessel-
lated pavements.
	
Pilaster Reliefs
Great Temple relief panels on pilasters provide us with a wealth of informa-
tion representing a diversity of themes: decorative busts of deities, as well 
145	
Upon excavation we found the porch or temple façade of three badly eroded columns set 
on Attic bases (in turn set on sandstone pedestals) with two drums preserved, which re-
mained in situ, but the central west column and its base had been completely obliterated 
by a disastrous earthquake.
146	
Originally the columns of the northern façade, the Pronaos (Portico), must have been sur-
mounted by a compete entablature supporting a monumental pediment, which, unfor-
tunately, like its distyle predecessor, has not been recovered. Hypothetically, the ­different 
column heights were equalized by the entablature above the peristyle. The intercolum-
niation between the two porch side columns is 5.03 m, and there is 7.06 m inter-axial 
distance between the two center columns.
147	
This pavement was stripped from its context in antiquity. It is probable that there was a 
major entryway from the Pronaos into the central hall (cella); however nothing remains, 
because the later theater stage building (infra) erased this access.

337
The Role of the Petra Great Temple
as armor—helmets, spears and javelins.148 Most of these relief sculptures  
depict male and female forms in a heavy but naturalistic style. The iconography,  
when clear, seems classicizing, as is the costume.149 The variety of figure types150 
brings into question the notion that the temple would have been decorated only  
with imagery associated with the deity or deities dwelling within. A ­pilaster relief  
of an honorific wreath is illustrated in Figure 17.12. Ten ­limestone relief pilaster 
fragments are sculpted in a similar low relief technique.151 ­Several of the figural 
reliefs preserve a square-shaped slot cut for the insertion of the head, sculpted 
as a separate piece (and perhaps executed in a different material, like marble, 
and possibly representing a separate sculptural school). These reliefs might  
have been part of a program that decorated the two exterior façades (anta 
walls) of the main Great Temple building. There may have been as many as five 
panels on each anta wall, arranged vertically from the anta top to the bottom.152
	
The Theater-in-Temple
The unexpected discovery of a theater inserted into the center of the distyle 
temple marks the third remodeling of the temple structure, and its building 
erases all vestiges of earlier activities in the temple center. It is striking that this 
reconfiguration (Figure 17.13) is a tertiary use of the architectural space within 
the confines of the distyle structure, occurring in the later first century a.d. 
This theater-in-temple is an anachronism—parallels in Nabataean, Greek, or 
Roman architecture for such a combination of architectonic devices are, as 
far as we know, non-existent. Of particular interest are the methods the Naba-
taeans used to construct the theater within the architectural confines of the 
Nabataean distyle temple—the earliest monumental building.
148	
We posit that the pilasters found in the spolia of the Lower Temenos west fell from the 
Great Temple western façade (the west anta wall). Unfortunately it is not possible to re-
construct them reliably.
149	
All these reliefs exhibit weathering and damage, and some seem to have been “cut down,” 
into either square blocks or “strips,” from original dimensions of perhaps 85 or 90 cm in 
width and 60 or 65 cm in height. Almost all were recovered from the eastern part of the 
Lower Temenos of the Great Temple, where several were reused for intercolumnar wall 
blocks in Byzantine East Triple Colonnade and East Exedra wall installations.
150	
The celebrated 1967 group of relief sculptures (McKenzie, The Architecture of Petra, 41, 
plates 63–64, 65b, 66, 68c) is an elaboration of these themes; however no griffins, eagles, 
or sea creatures are depicted on the reliefs of the Great Temple.
151	
Most can be reconstructed as originally having been approximately the same size, and 
most share key characteristics like a frame of cyma reversa with fillet. The majority of 
panels depict the human figure, both male and female, while one well-preserved panel 
and one fragment depict wreaths of leaves, and a helmet is represented in Joukowsky, 
Petra Great Temple, Volume ii, figure 2.37.

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
Before the seating could be put in place, the architects constructed a sub-
structure to support the theater building with three vaulted chambers—an east, 
west, and large central vaulted chamber. Furthermore, intercolumnar walls 
were constructed between the eight columns on the sides and the six in the  
rear of the distyle temple.153 These intercolumnar walls ensured ­further support  
for the theater seating. Between the outer and inner substructure walls, north–
south interior staircases were put in place along the sides with two additional 
east and west interior staircases across the rear, leading up to the second storey 
of the structure. Thus the patrons of the theater could take one of four broad 
stairways 7 m in length to access the middle and upper tiers of seats. Provisions 
were made for lighting the stairways and rooms with vaulted windows.
The diameter of the orchestra154 is 6.43  m, and the outermost seating 
33.2 m × 18.36 m × 2.96 m in depth. The cavea itself consists of four cunei155 cut 
by the three scalae.156 The cavea is greater than 180-degrees, and the orchestra 
podium follows the curve of a circle. Estimates vary as to the seating ­capacity 
of the structure, but it is safe to say that somewhere between 600 and 900 spec-
tators could be accommodated. It is reasoned that the center of the theater 
was hypaethral,157 or open to the sky, and the corridor and walkway walls sup-
ported a tiled roof covering the stairways.
	
Theater Masks
Great Temple theater masks probably adorned the entry or perhaps the stage 
building (scenae frons). Four Graeco-Roman theater head masks were discov-
ered near the temple’s West Corridor wall.158 Because the masks were ­recovered 
from the same context, we suggest they were part of the Site Phase v sculptural 
program to embellish the theater. Sculpted from a local pale yellow limestone, 
two appear to be tragic masks (Melpomene with a weeping face); without the 
preservation of the facial expressions the identity of the others is unknown. All

These are dated to Site Phase ix when there was the major convulsion from the a.d. 363 
earthquake and collapse of the major temple architectural fragments, including the the-
ater and the west porch columns. They were, however, manufactured in Site Phase v or 
the first century a.d. An additional mask fragment, found on the Roman Street, is stored 
in the Petra Site Museum (Schluntz, “From Royal to Public Assembly Space,” 232).

but one represent females, undersized in scale, but the male mask ­(Figure 17.14), 
perhaps representing Dionysos, is oversized and may have been exhibited in a 
central position on the theater-in-temple façade. The masks are represented 
frontally—the male is depicted with a moustache, and one of the females has 
her hair fashioned with tight ringlets in the Nabataean style, a bi-cultural phe-
nomenon. Although these sculptures are based on Graeco-Roman deities, we 
can detect Nabataean influences that were also part of the exterior decoration 
of the theater-in-temple. In all probability these evocative heads adorned a 
frieze placed across the lintel or on the doors of the theater, for they reflect a spe-
cific borrowing from classical theaters of the day. The development of such new 
decorative details in Petra is distinctive of widespread classical traditions and 
politico-religious power, combined with indigenous Nabataean artistic ideas.
Now that the relative chronology and the development of the Nabataean 
architecture and sculpture of the Great Temple have been established, we turn 
to some brief comments about numismatics, writing, the artifact corpus, and 
faunal remains.
	
Numismatic Evidence
By the first century b.c. (62–9 b.c.) the kings of Petra were issuing autonomous 
coinage.159 As coins are active carriers and transmitters of cultural information,  
159	
Meshorer, Nabataean Coins, 3, states that Obodas ii, Malichus i, and Obodas iii were 
the first Nabataean kings to strike their own coins with Greek inscriptions, and Obodas

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
they too are products of specialized manufacture. To date, the Great Temple 
coin corpus includes 759 coins, and suggests the importance of ­Nabataean 
Petra’s multicultural interrelationships with other cities in the region and 
throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. In all, we have identified seven coins 
belonging to the Hellenistic period (including four coins of Arados or Sidon). 
The coins likely minted at Arados suggest that Petra participated in regional 
monetary commerce during the third and second centuries b.c., even before 
the Nabataeans began minting their own coins. The collection includes three 
Jewish coins, ranging from the mid-first century b.c. to the time of the First 
Jewish Revolt (a.d. 66–70), and 138 Nabataean coins from roughly the same 
period, including later issues that are punctuated by the occasional foreign  
intrusions. Both the earliest and latest known issues were represented as well 
as most in between.160
	
A Note about Writing
The Nabataeans were multi-lingual and spoke an early kind of Arabic, a  
distinct dialect of the Aramaic language with their own script.161 However, 
there is a paucity of their inscriptions—unlike the prolific Roman accounts  
of ­Josephus, we lack direct reports of how Aretas iv administered the 
­Nabataean kingdom. Two important inscriptions of Aretas iv have been 
ii was the first to strike coins with Nabataean inscriptions. By the time of King Aretas iv, 
Nabataean coinage had replaced other foreign issues, and became the currency dominat-
ing the local market. Nabataean kings are generally represented with long curls on the 
neck.
160	
There are 51 Roman coins minted during the first through third century a.d., and 296 
Roman coins minted in the fourth century a.d. or later. Roman coins find the Petra Great 
Temple in the following centuries interacting within the economic sphere of the Eastern 
Mediterranean. While issues minted at Rome (e.g. by Trajan and Constantine i) made 
their way to the site, local and regional minted issues are more common in the archaeo-
logical record. Following Nabataea’s annexation in a.d. 106, some of the first new coins 
were silver drachms of Trajan, likely minted nearby in Bostra. Also dating from around 
this time was a small bronze issue bearing the monogram of the newly designated  
Petra Metropolis. Bronze coins of Septimius Severus and Julia Domna minted also at  
Petra show that the city’s economic horizons might not have expanded considerably in 
the course of the next 100 years. As most of the Roman coins excavated at the site be-
long to the third and fourth century, the range of mintmarks for these issues is a useful 
measure of the distances over which coins traveled on their way to Petra. By far the most 
common mints represented are Alexandria (Egypt) and Antioch (Syria). Coins from Con-
stantinople (Bithynia), Cyzicus (Asia), Heraclea (Thracia), Nicomedia (Bithynia), Thessa-
lonica (Macedonia), and perhaps Siscia (Pannonia) appear as well, as does the occasional 
product of the Rome mint.

found, one that conclusively dates the Qasr al-Bint to his reign,162 and the other  
from the Petra Church.163 There is also the monumental Nabataean inscrip-
tion on the ­Turkmaniye Tomb,164 and fragmentary Nabataean inscriptions 
have been found at the Great Temple,165 but there are no Nabataean inscrip-
tions from the Great Temple that give us any indication as to which deity was 
worshiped or how the Nabataeans identified the structure.166 Surely indi-
viduals could enter into legal contracts, and the rights and responsibilities of 
the Petraean must have been written down, but we lack textual evidence for  
them.167
The question has been asked as to why there are so few surviving Nabataean 
inscriptions. It is indeed strange if the Nabataeans did not feel it was important 
to leave enduring documents recording their achievements. In such a cosmo-
politan society, there must have been oral epics and dream-like songs of their 
nomadic past. From the evidence of Nabataean culture, we know that music

See Jones, “Nabataean Inscriptions.” The Petra Church inscription, published by Jones, 
reads: “This is the … which Halpala, [son of…] made, and these are the theatron and 
shrine, colonnades, and porticoes to Dushara … in the month Tebet in the year eleven 
of Haretat (Aretas), king of the Nabataeans, who loved his people.” Presumably this text, 
which is dated to a.d. 2/3, refers to an architectural entity of sacral character, and the 
combination of theatron, shrine, colonnades, and porticoes might indicate that its refer-
ence is to the Great Temple.

The bronze plaque with a partial Nabataean inscription, dated to the first quarter of 
the first century a.d. reads “M L K T,” Malakat or queen (Joukowsky, Petra Great Temple,

“good health” (figure 7.29a, 7.29b), as well as Nabataean masons’ marks (figure 7.8) and 
a faint graffito on the Propylaeum wall (figure 7.30). These provide meager philological 
hints to the epigraphic record.

We are at a loss as to why there are so few Nabataean and other inscriptions from the 
Great Temple. Joukowsky, Petra: The Great Temple, Volume i, figure 8.6, illustrates an in-
scribed Rhodian amphora handle from Alexandria, dated to the end of the second cen-
tury b.c.

Important is the later Roman monumental Greek inscription of Lucius Verus from the 
Qasr al-Bint. There are three Great Temple Roman Imperial inscriptions, dated between

Strabo (16.4.21–26) is worthwhile quoting at length:
“The metropolis of the Nabataeans is Petra, as it is called; for it lies on a site which is 
otherwise smooth and level, but it is fortified all round by a rock, the outside parts of 
the site being precipitous and sheer, and the inside parts having springs in abundance, 
both for domestic purposes and for watering gardens … Petra is always ruled by some 
king from the royal family; and the king has as Administrator one of his companions, 
who is called ‘brother.’ It is exceedingly well governed; at any rate, Athenodorus, a phi-
losopher and companion of mine, who had been in the city of the Petraeans, used to de-
scribe their government with admiration, for he said that he found both many Romans  
and many other foreigners sojourning there, and that he saw that the foreigners of-
ten engaged in lawsuits, both with one another and with the natives, but that none of 
the natives prosecuted one another, and that they in every way kept peace with one 
another…
“The Nabataeans are a sensible people, and are so much inclined to acquire posses-
sions that they publicly fine anyone who has diminished his possessions and also con-
fer honors on anyone who has increased them. Since they have but few slaves, they are 
served by their kinsfolk for the most part, or by one another, or by themselves; so that 
the custom also extends even to their kings. They prepare common meals together in 
groups of thirteen persons; and they have two girl-singers for each banquet [italics added]. 
The king holds many drinking-bouts in magnificent style, but no one drinks more than 
eleven cupfuls, each time using a different golden cup. The king is so democratic that, 
in addition to serving himself, he sometimes even serves the rest himself in his turn. He 
often renders an account of his kingship in the popular assembly; and sometimes his 
mode of life is examined. Their homes, through the use of stone, are costly; but, on ac-
count of peace, the cities are not walled. Most of the country is well supplied with fruits 
except olive; they use sesame-oil instead. The sheep are white-fleeced and the oxen are 
large, but the country produces no horses. Camels afford the service they require instead 
of horses. They go out without tunics, with girdles about their loins, and with slippers 
on their feet—even the kings, though in their case the color is purple. Some things are 
imported wholly from other countries, but others not altogether so, especially in the case 
of those that are native products, as, for example, gold and silver and most of the aromat-
ics, whereas brass and iron, as also purple garb, styrax, crocus, costaria, embossed works, 
paintings and moulded works are not produced in their country. They have the same 
regard for the dead as for dung, as Heracleitus says: ‘Dead bodies more fit to be cast out 
than dung’; and therefore they bury even their kings beside dung-heaps. They worship 
the sun, building an altar on the top of the house, and pouring libations on it daily and 
burning frankincense.”

Artifact Corpus
A diverse spectrum of Great Temple special finds, including craft items,170 has 
been recovered for the Nabataean period. These finds demonstrate Nabataean 
Petra’s entrenched multicultural interrelationships with other sites in the re-
gion and throughout the Eastern Mediterranean. Bone/ivory objects include 
awls, borers, cosmetic boxes, combs, cosmetic sticks, game pieces, a handle, 
furniture inlay, needles, spatulae, spindle whorls, pendants, spoons, and amu-
lets, as well as miscellaneous bone objects, many of which were reworked and 
reused long bones. A fine bone knife handle fashioned as a leg was carved from 
a thick fragment of a long bone of a large mammal, such as a camel, horse, or 
cow. Unusual finds like hippopotamus tusk fragments171 that may have been a 
part of a cosmetic box point to the exchange of elite items, many of which may 
have held a symbolic value.
Metal objects comprise silver, gold, bronze, and iron artifacts. Bronze finds 
include jewelry such as beads, an earring, pendants, pins, rings, toggle pins, 
and utensils like adzes, ax heads, borers, chisels, nails, a ploughshare point, 
scrapers, and bronze weapons, such as arrowheads, blades/daggers, a spear-
head, and knives. There are iron utensils as well. Many of these items indicate 
long-distance exchange between cultures of the period.
	
Faunal Remains
Animals were an important source of food, supplying meat, milk, and milk 
products. Like most people of the time, the Nabataeans used wool for their 
clothing and tents, and skins were used for transporting water and other liq-
uids. Excavations at the Great Temple recovered 27,658 faunal specimens. Of 
the analyzed sample, approximately 25% could be identified to both element 
and taxon. The faunal assemblage from the Great Temple at Petra provides new 
insights not only into the diet of the Nabataean, Roman, and Byzantine popu-
lations at the site, but also into the nature of the economy, ritual practices, 
and population shifts over time. The spectrum and relative percentages of taxa 
exploited—a predominance of sheep and goats, with cattle, pigs, and a variety 
of other domestic and wild taxa occurring in smaller numbers—fit the typi-
cal pattern observed in Near Eastern faunal assemblages since the ­Neolithic

The array of materials includes pottery, bone, metals, including gold and silver objects, 
and small stone artifacts of carnelian, crystal, diorite, sandstone, and limestone, glass, 
faience, and small finds of bone/ivory, and shell. Unfortunately there is insufficient space 
here to discuss fully the details of the artifact corpus.

period. Sheep, goats, and fowl contributed the bulk of the meat utilized in all 
periods at the Great Temple of Petra.172
Fish remains from the Petra Great Temple belong to species from the Medi-
terranean and Red Seas, representing the following family groups: Scombridae 
(mackerels, tunas, and bonitos), Serranidae (groupers), Scaridae (parrot fish), 
Sparidae (breams and porgies), Sciaenidae (croackers or drummers), and Mug-
lidae (mullets or grey mullets). This indicates that acquisition of fish involved 
interactions with more than one source of supply, with fish from the Mediter-
ranean and Red Seas reaching Petra probably along wider procurement sys-
tems connecting the north Jordan Valley to the Mediterranean coast and Gulf 
of ‘Aqaba. This would have involved transporting fish over great distances. It is 
possible that fish was in genuine demand, perhaps to serve social, or “ritualistic 
and religious” purposes.
	
The Role of the Great Temple
The Great Temple has been an indisputable research tool for scholars who seek 
to explore and understand the cultural record of Petra and the Nabataeans; 
its importance cannot be overestimated. As a dynamic urban center with a 
concentration of multiple activities, it was a focus of political power, religious 
practice, and exchange, and it served as a vehicle for Nabataean state author-
ity. In short, it was a structure representing the centralization of political, eco-
nomic, and religious institutions.173 The Great Temple’s role might be said to 
have had a hybrid spirit, for it served multiple functions of both a religious 
sanctuary and an administrative center.
The king’s power base must have been shared by leading citizens and their 
families, who must have been simultaneously engaged in his policies. Aretas 
iv’s plan for the Great Temple envisaged a modern, cosmopolitan, administra-
tive, business, and religious quarter, with an adjacent sylvan, open area to the 
172	
Changes in the relative proportions of taxa over time reflect a combination of environ-
mental, economic, political, and social impacts. The low occurrence of cattle is probably 
primarily related to Petra’s location in an arid environmental zone, which would have 
posed great challenges for keeping cattle, which require frequent watering and high- 
quality pasture. Pigs and chickens contributed almost nothing to the Nabataean diet, but 
were present in much greater numbers from the point of the Roman takeover, indicating 
the arrival of new inhabitants with different dietary practices. The high meat value of 
pigs, together with their making up over 10% of the assemblage in non-Nabataean peri-
ods, suggests that pork featured frequently in meals.

Debate has stemmed from my assertion in 1998 that the Great Temple precinct governs 
both a sacral and secular character. I continue to support this hypothesis. See “The Great 
Debate,” in Joukowsky, Petra Great Temple, Volume ii, 351–399.

east—reincarnated into a spacious park with a garden and pool complex.174 In 
a city located on the edge of the desert, this planned, lush, open green space 
was intended to bring the countryside into the city.
In so many ways the Great Temple architecture represents a marvel of 
­Nabataean engineering, and we have discovered its differing paths of archi-
tectural development relating to the ideological, political, environmental, 
technological, and economic processes that spanned the Nabataean period. 
With access to limited water supplies, sophisticated water systems were built 
with controlled and directed water flows. As can be seen in Plate 17.4, the Petra 
Great Temple stands alone, not only because its Nabataean architecture is of 
monumental proportions, but also in terms of its sculpture, which can be in-
terpreted as commemorative in intention. The substantial transformations to 
the building and its iconographic program must be linked to a re-emphasis of 
the function and importance of the precinct.
There is a richness of sculptural decoration in Petra as a whole, and at the 
Great Temple in particular. Using limestone, sandstone, and infrequently im-
ported marble as materials, Nabataean sculpture reflects a mixture of import-
ed and local characteristics as well as a variety of themes. There is a common 
sense of the sacred and the divine between different peoples, and we find a 
sharing of pantheist ideas with nomadic beliefs that are grafted onto the ide-
als of the Hellenistic world. The Nabataeans celebrated the aniconic (non-­
human) forms like the nefesh and the betyl, which had apotropaic (protective) 
functions. The sculptural media of in situ betyls and nefesh represent Naba-
taean popular religion shared by nomadic common beliefs and symbolism. As 
was mentioned, the nefesh iconography conveys the memory of its owner or 
clan that erected it. These powerful markers embody a celebration of the dead, 
surely one of the attributes of religious authority. The betyls are also idiosyn-
cratic Nabataean symbols dedicated to Dushara and al-‘Uzza, the city’s patron 
gods, erected to counteract fears of ill health, envy, bad luck, and infertility.175 
Their presence brings peace alike to the living and the dead.
Petra, in the first centuries b.c. and a.d. stood at the nexus of a number 
of important artistic influences, tracing some of their origins to the traditions 
of the Hellenistic Near East of the first century b.c. Surely Hellenism was the 
inspiration for the pilaster blocks—the decorative anthropomorphic panels 
with richly decorated framed figures of deities exhibiting the juxtaposition of 
many themes and iconography. The most popular representation is of Tyche

They also served to jinx unseen forces—devils, demons, and evil spirits.

The Role of the Petra Great Temple
(Fortune) with a cornucopia (horn of plenty, abundance, and fertility).176 Here 
we find a selective use of classical iconography, representing the Nabataean 
“take” on classical deities and armor.
Nabataean sculptors left Hellenistic stereotypes behind when they created 
the Asian elephant-headed capitals. The profusion of these hitherto unknown 
capitals underlines the extraordinary and diverse sculptural statements that 
emerged with the reign of Aretas iv. In conclusion, the sculptural representa-
tions of the nefesh, betyls, pilaster relief panels, elephant-headed capitals, and 
theater masks were created to embody special meanings for the monuments 
they adorned. Clearly the Nabataeans celebrated their own individual culture 
and religion while they assimilated and borrowed classical ideas.177 The classi-
cism of the Great Temple’s elaborate Corinthian capitals, paneled reliefs, and 
theater masks is a reflection of those influences, which most likely were bor-
rowed from Ptolemaic Alexandria. In the various redesign phases of the temple 
complex, embellishments such as the theater masks were added, and some of 
them number among the most accomplished examples of architectural deco-
ration from Hellenistic and Roman Jordan. It would seem the Great Temple 
was a place without barriers between faiths or creeds, which included an eclec-
tic, cosmopolitan mixture of iconographic detail underpinning a profusion of 
faiths that sustained its people and the Great Temple’s sacred geography. The 
Nabataeans selected what appealed to them from various religious ideas, ob-
jects, and practices. Clearly their political vision extended across confessions, 
languages, and political boundaries.
The artifact corpus forms an important addition to the excavated architec-
ture and sculpture. Many objects are of Hellenistic–Roman inspiration. In this 
highly cosmopolitan site we find coinage from far-flung parts of the world, 
and craft specialization in the pottery industries that take a variety of forms. 
There are small finds, including glass objects imported from Egypt, figurines, 
and imported and local lamps. As represented at the Great Temple, Petra’s in-
land trade was replete with imports and produce from Egyptian markets. There 
are jewelry, bone/ivory objects, and shell artifacts. Besides the coins, there are 
offering stands, small and large horned altars, basalt grinders, rotating grain 
mills, and weights. Items of adornment include bracelets, pendants, earrings, 
176	
Adopted from the Hellenistic world, the cornucopia is a significant Nabataean royal sym-
bol, which is found not only on paneled reliefs, but also on the reverse of Nabataean 
coinage.
177	
When speaking about architecture, Wenning, in “The Rock-Cut Architecture of Petra,” 141, 
states, that the Nabataeans developed “…a new style marked by intelligent integration of 
foreign forms into its own traditions, ideas, and taste.”

and finger rings. Miscellaneous metal artifacts used in the construction of the 
Great Temple include mundane objects, such as nails, tacks, and door locks. 
Change is the essence of urban life, and each one of these artifact classes ex-
hibits its own course of development. These data from the Great Temple also 
support the Nabataeans’ vigorous role in international trade.
Situated in the midst of hills and plunging ravines, Petra is remarkable be-
cause it is so evocative. Although the builders of churches and the Bedouin 
used the deserted Great Temple as a quarry for their buildings, enough of it 
remains as a matchless testimony to the achievements of its Nabataean archi-
tects. The Great Temple has extended the language of Nabataean Petra and 
brought us to think about the essential benchmarks of the multiethnic and 
multicultural Nabataean culture. As a primary source, archaeological excava-
tions have uncovered the biography of a vast and magnificent precinct with 
elephant-headed capitals, grand stairways, sophisticated water systems, elabo-
rate stucco decoration, and so much more. However what has been recovered 
is only a small part of its memory.
Here we have emphasized the Great Temple’s role and contributions to the 
Nabataean artistic and architectural canons. The exceptional preservation of 
the architecture and sculpture, as well as the faunal remains and artifact cor-
pus, give us a unique picture of the Great Temple—and its contribution to 
Nabataean art, architecture, and material culture, providing us with new infor-
mation, which invites us to contemplate broader questions.178

Fibulae in Neo-Assyrian Burials
Friedhelm Pedde
When Oscar White Muscarella and I first met, it was due to our mutual interest 
in ancient Near Eastern fibulae; this was the beginning of a friendship. With-
out doubt, Muscarella is one of the world’s leading experts on the subject, and 
the author of several important articles and books about this topic, especially 
on the fibulae from Hasanlu1 and Gordion,2 but also on various aspects of an-
cient fibulae, their use, their dating, and their ramifications.3 I have written 
elsewhere about the definition, typological development, and chronological 
and geographical range of ancient Near Eastern fibulae.4 In this article I wish 
to discuss fibulae recovered in burials and the kinds of information they can 
convey—a question that Muscarella has also addressed, in particular with re-
gard to fibulae from tombs at Marlik and Assur.5
The region in which fibulae occur in graves and tombs correlates closely 
with the distribution area of ancient Near Eastern fibulae in general: from the 
Levant to Iran. Fibulae reached the Levantine coast via Cyprus in the 11th cen-
tury b.c. Following their first appearance here, new shapes and technologies 
were created in the Levant, whence fibulae spread throughout the Fertile Cres-
cent centuries later.
Fibulae of ancient Near Eastern types have been found at more than 160 
sites. At approximately 60 sites, around 300 fibulae were found in burials. At 
numerous sites, only very few examples were found in graves, at other sites 
many. The size of a site and number of burials excavated play a fundamental 
role in the interpretation of fibulae recovered, as do certain other factors.
Both bow fibulae and triangular fibulae have been found in Assyria; both 
types have a separate pin, the end of which was inserted into a hole at the

base of one end of the arc. In this region, the bow fibula with a semi-circular 
arc occurs infrequently, and the arcs of most bow fibulae were produced in 
their final shape in a mould.6 The majority of Assyrian fibulae are triangular in 
shape, with an arc that forms an approximate right angle. These were all cast 
in a straight form and then bent using one of two different techniques. A small 
number were carefully bent over a thin rod positioned under the undecorated 
space at the middle part of the arc. All the other triangular fibulae were sharply 
bent, so that the middle part was angled. This second procedure results in a 
bending groove on the inner side at the middle of the arc, with an elliptical 
widening of the profile as a consequence of the pressure. The tools used for 
this manufacturing process could include a pair of iron tweezers, such as the 
pair found in a grave at Assur together with a fibula (Plate 18.1).
The earliest fibulae in Assyria occur in the eighth century b.c. One of the 
first fibulae found in Assyria is an imported bow fibula of my type B2.1, which 
was clearly made in the region of modern Israel.7 This important example was 
among the treasures excavated in tomb iii at Nimrud,8 the burial of Mullissu-
mukannišat-Ninua, the wife of Assurnasirpal ii; the queen died during the 
reign of his son Shalmaneser iii (r. 858–824 b.c.). The queen’s tomb had been 
robbed, but the tomb’s antechamber contained a number of later burials. 
Most of the fine objects recovered from the tomb—including the imported  
fibula—were associated with these later depositions, which date to the eighth 
century b.c.9 A fibula of my type B2.3 found in a terracotta coffin from Assur10 
also dates to the eighth century b.c. and is an import from the area of Zincirli, 
Carchemish, and Tell Halaf (Figure 18.1).11 A smaller variant, coming from a 
sherd grave at Assur,12 may date to the first half of the seventh century b.c. 
Assur is at the eastern periphery of the area of distribution for this group of 
bow fibulae. All these bow fibulae can be seen as imports from the West, where 
fibulae had already been in use for several centuries.
The Assyrians clearly adopted the fibula from the West, and developed their 
own production techniques and styles, most notably the triangular fibula. 
Then, very quickly, “fibulae became great” in Assyria.
6	
In my investigations I use the terms “group B” for bow fibulae, “group C” for triangular 
fibulae bent over a rod, and “group D” for triangular, sharply bent fibulae. See Pedde, 
Vorderasiatische Fibeln.

The “front runner” is currently Assur, with a total of ca. 250 excavated fibu-
lae. At Assur, ca. 150 fibulae were found in 110 Neo-Assyrian graves and tombs. 
Between 700 and 900 Neo-Assyrian burials have been excavated at the site.13 
Therefore, out of more than 700 burials, 110 contained fibulae—that is, fibulae 
were found in approximately one seventh of the graves at Assur. Even if one 
takes into account the fact that many of these graves date before the end of the 
8th century b.c., and prior to the advent of fibulae, it is still clear that fibulae 
were not standard equipment in the Assur burials. By far the greatest number 
of fibulae found in these burials date to the seventh century b.c.14
The custom of interring the dead with fibulae was not limited to a particu-
lar region in the Fertile Crescent. To the contrary, it appears that everywhere 
where fibulae were worn, they were also placed in graves as burial gifts. There 
were no special types of fibulae made exclusively for burials, as is the case with 
some kinds of pottery: a fibula worn by a living person could be deposited in a 
grave after the person’s death as part of his or her normal attire. Like the brace-
lets, rings, and earrings recovered from tombs, fibulae also may be considered 
to have been the property of the deceased, and not items used for the burial 
ritual, as with some grave vessels.
For the most part, such fibulae were found close to the collarbone, which 
indicates that they still functioned as safety pins. But in some cases, as in the 
meticulously excavated Achaemenid cemetery of Kamid el-Loz in Lebanon, 
some fibulae were found without their pins;15 these were thus no longer in use 
as dress ornaments in any practical sense. Some fibulae were found in urns, at 
sites such as Deve Hüyük16 and Carchemish.17 As these examples were still in 
very good condition, we can assume that they were not burnt with the corpse, 
but given later as offerings and deposited with the ashes of the deceased. One 
possible reason for the inclusion of fibulae in these graves is that they may 
have been seen as impure, as possessions of the dead, and were therefore not 
considered desirable as heirlooms.
Fibulae as elements of costume may be an indication of a specific ethnic 
group, as Muscarella has posited for Phrygian fibulae.18 This may also be true 
13	
Some of these burials may date to the Post-Assyrian period. See Pedde, “The Assur-­Project: 
A New Analysis”; “The Assur Project: The Middle and Neo-Assyrian Graves”; Gräber und 
Grüfte.

Fibulae in Neo-Assyrian Burials
of Assyrian fibulae, but, if so, evidence is not forthcoming from burials. Fibulae 
occur in all possible grave types, associated with various inventories, and be-
cause different grave types are found side by side, nothing speaks to a specific 
fibulae-wearing ethnic group. Neither are Assyrian fibulae necessarily gender 
specific19 or age related. That is, the same types of fibulae could be worn by 
men and women, and, in a very few cases, even by children, as at Tall Knediğ20 
and Assur (Figure 18.2).21 Moreover, fibula types do not seem to indicate par-
ticular social status, for the same types occur in graves with rich or poor burial 
equipment; sometimes several fibulae of different types occur in one and the 
same grave (Figures 18.3–18.5).22 The only certain indicator of prestige is the 
­material, for only in a few cases are fibulae made of gold or silver instead of 
bronze, as, for example, in two graves at Assur23 and in the queens’ tombs at 
Nimrud.24 Outside the capital cities, finds of gold or silver fibulae are extreme-
ly rare in the territories of the Assyrian empire. One example is a gold or elec-
trum fibula of Assyrian style known from the so-called grave of Adoni Nur in 
Amman.25
As a rule, in an Assyrian grave one person had one fibula, but sometimes 
two or three fibulae were buried with the deceased, and in rare cases even 
more. This helps us to associate the different groups of fibulae with one an-
other, for if fibulae of several different types are found in the grave of a single 
person, we can assume that these types belong roughly to the same period 
(Figures 18.6 and 18.7).26 Conversely, graves of different types have been found 
to contain fibulae of the same type.27 Moreover, a grave that can be dated by 
other means can be used to date a fibula found within it—or even a whole 
19	
In the cemetery of Kamid el-Loz with 67 graves, 20 percent of the men and almost 30 
percent of the women wore fibulae. See Hachmann and Penner, Kamid el-Loz, 305–306.

group of fibulae—for in the standard case the fibula should not be very much 
older than the grave.28
One of the most spectacular Assyrian fibulae was found in the queen’s tomb 
i at Nimrud: a gold fibula belonging to a woman who was approximately 55 
years old.29 The fibula shows a predatory bird on one side of the arc and, on the 
other, the figure of a kneeling woman with the head of a Pazuzu on her head. 
Fibulae with a Pazuzu head and a predatory bird occur as a small group,30 but 
most of them come from the antiquities market. Only a few were excavated: 
one found at Megiddo;31 another from a grave at Assur32 (Figure 18.8) together 
with a fibula of group D1.533 (Figure 18.9); and a third piece from Assur.34 The 
function of the Pazuzu as a protective device to counter the demon Lamashtu 
is well known. Lamashtu was considered to be a threat to women giving birth 
and their babies. For this protection, incantation texts were created as well 
28	
In a few cases Assyrian fibulae as well as other objects have been found in graves that are 
much later than the individual finds. These were apparently collected as heirlooms and 
later deposited in graves. For example, see Sheikh Hamad in Novák, et al. “Der parthisch-
römische Friedhof,” 67–68; Uruk: Pedde, “Seleukidische und parthische Zeit,” 187, grave

as amulets.35 Mentioned in the texts and depicted on the amulets are a car-
pet, a fibula,36 a shoe, a lamp, a comb, and a mirror—symbols of female travel 
equipment—as well as the hoof of a donkey as a symbol of locomotion. This 
combination of images conveyed the command: “Take all this stuff and get 
lost!” The apotropaic properties of fibulae, as indicated by their presence on 
the amulets, likely prompted women to wear them well beyond their child-
bearing years, as the example from tomb i at Nimrud attests.
After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian empire, the custom of wearing fibu-
lae disappears in Mesopotamia.37 On the reliefs of Persepolis a group of men, 
identified by R. Hachmann as Assyrians,38 are shown without fibulae, support-
ing the archaeological evidence. In the land of Assur, the period when “fibulae 
became great” had come to an end, at the time when “the lie became great”39 
in the lands of the Achaemenians, where ancient Near Eastern fibulae still 
existed for a time only in the Levant—the same region where the tradition of 
wearing fibulae had started centuries earlier.

Fibulae, Chronology, and Related Considerations: 
Marlik Reloaded
Christian Konrad Piller
	
Introduction
In 1984, Oscar White Muscarella published a short but significant paper on two 
bronze fibulae and discussed the importance of these finds for the dating of 
their archaeological contexts.1 One of these fibulae was found in Tomb 36 at 
Tepe Marlik in northern Iran.2 Marlik (also known as Cheragh Ali Tepe) is a 
small natural hill in the valley of the Gohar Rud, an eastern tributary to the 
Sefid Rud River in the Iranian Province of Gilan (Plate 19.1). Between 1961 and 
1962, an Iranian expedition under the direction of Ezatollah Negahban exca-
vated 53 stone-built tombs on top of this hill, many of them containing an 
abundance of precious funerary goods (Figure 19.1). It was quite obvious that 
this was a burial place for the local elite.3 Even today, half a century after its 
discovery, the necropolis of Marlik represents one of the most important ar-
chaeological sites in Iran.4
Regrettably, the excavations at Marlik had to be carried out under quite un-
usual and highly problematic circumstances. Right from the beginning there 
was enormous pressure from landowners, antique dealers, and professional 
looters.5 After a violent attack on the tent camp of the archaeologists, the inves-
tigations were conducted under police protection, and Negahban was forced to 
excavate the whole cemetery in an uninterrupted campaign of 14 months. As a

Piller, “Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 13; Piller, “Landscape Archaeology,” 236. 
The second fibula comes from Gruft 30 at Assur and therefore is not considered here.
3	 The excavator himself sometimes used the term “Royal Cemetery” to describe the rich char-
acter of this burial place. At the same time, “burials of ordinary people” were built in the 
valleys surrounding the hill (Negahban, Complete Excavation Report, 13).

result, both the excavation technology and the standard of documentation of 
this important site remained insufficient.6 For example, only a limited number 
of photographs were taken during the course of the excavation. Drawings and 
detailed descriptions of the contexts and the positioning of the burial goods do 
not exist. Apart from a few exceptions, skeletal remains of the deceased were 
not preserved or not recognized as such by the excavators.
This unfavorable situation was additionally complicated by a confusing grid 
square reference system and the publication strategy of the excavator.7 More 
than two decades after the excavation had taken place, no final publication 
was available. After a preliminary report that appeared in 1964,8 Negahban 
­published only a series of articles on various object groups such as figurines, 
pendants, or seals.9 On the other hand, important object groups such as pottery, 
personal ornaments, and weapons remained more or less obscure. Consider-
ing such circumstances, it is not surprising that both the relative and absolute 
dating of the necropolis became a matter of continuing scientific debate.10
It was only in 1983 that Negahban published a monograph on the metal 
vessels from Marlik, including the inventory lists of finds from two tombs (36

In the autumn of 1962, Negahban was forced to leave the area and had to cede the field 
to illegal diggers. When he returned more than one year later, the valley of the Gohar 
Rud had been extensively plundered by illegal diggings (Negahban, Complete Excavation 
Report, 11).

Some of the tombs cover more than one grid square, while on the other hand, one grid 
can be at least partially occupied by two or even three tombs. For example: Tomb 25 is 
situated in Grids xve, xvf, xvie, xvif in almost equal portions, while Grid xvd contains 
part of Tombs 18, 23, and 24.

report soon became a blueprint for art dealers and forgers. Soon after the remarkable 
metal vessels with figural decorations had been published, the first forgeries appeared 
on the international art market. See Löw, Figürlich verzierte Metallgefäße, 540–545. Some-
times objects dating to much later periods (Parthian and Sasanian) were sold under the 
designation ­Cheragh Ali Tepe, which was considered a “fashionable origin” (Overlaet, “A 
Chieftain’s Folding Stool,” 95–97).

ject groups were published repeatedly. For example, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic 
figurines were published in 1962, 1964, 1972, 1979, 1989, and finally in 1996. Mace heads 
were published in almost identical fashion in 1989 as a separate paper and in 1995 and

Oscar Muscarella’s interest was aroused. Being fully aware of the importance 
of fibulae as chronological markers, he saw a chance to re-evaluate the dating 
of “one of the most important tombs in the Marlik cemetery.”12
	
Marlik Tomb 36: Some Remarks
Tomb 36 is situated on the northern slope of the hill, near the densely occupied 
central part of the cemetery. It is one of the smallest sepulchral structures at 
Tepe Marlik and measures “only” about 1.5 × 2.0 meters. In this respect, it dif-
fers considerably from most of the other richly furnished burials at the site.13 
Another unusual feature is that the whole tomb is built of thin stone slabs with 
a distinctive yellowish tinge (Plate 19.2a).14 According to Negahban, this stone 
comes from a place called Soughestanak near the headwaters of the Gohar 
Rud, at a distance of about 15 kilometres from Marlik.15 In every tomb, there is 
at least one piece of yellow stone; in some cases (e.g. Tombs 32 and 44) parts of 
the walls were made of it.16 The fact that Tomb 36 was the only structure built 
entirely of this imported material illustrates its outstanding importance.

ventory list and the one published later in Negahban, Complete Excavation Report, 38–41.

or 52 (7 m × 4.5 m). The largest structure at the site is Tomb 14 (8 m × 6 m). This tomb was 
plundered before the excavation took place. For a summary of the possibly plundered 
tombs at Marlik see Piller, “Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 38–43.

Ibid., 25. Up to the 1960s, this area served as a summer camp for the inhabitants of the 
villages situated near Tepe Marlik. It is highly likely that a similar lifestyle already existed 
in prehistoric times. In any case, the occurrence of imported stone slabs at Marlik implies 
close relations between the upper and lower parts of the Gohar Rud valley during the 
Bronze and Iron Ages. Therefore, a scientific survey of Soughestanak and its surroundings 
could be a promising opportunity for gaining more information on the Marlik culture.  
A similar case can be observed in the Talesh region, where Tul-e Talesh still serves as 
summer camp for the inhabitants of the coastal plain and the high valley of Aq Evlar 
(Khalatbari, Archaeological Investigations in Talesh, 28–29).
16	
Negahban, Complete Excavation Report, 14, also mentions that in most of the tombs, the 
lower part that contained the funerary goods was covered with some slabs of yellow stone 
before the grave was filled in with natural soil and local stone from the hill.

The excavator noted that “funerary objects filled the tomb, with no partic-
ular arrangement except that different types of objects were placed togeth-
er or above one another” and that the tomb “was packed with hundreds of 
­interesting objects.”17 In contrast to most of the other richly furnished tombs 
at Marlik, weapons are rare in Tomb 36. In some other cases (e.g. Tombs 47 and 
52) the dead were literally “bedded” on daggers (Plate 19.2b). Around the de-
ceased, even more weapons such as spearheads, arrowheads, and mace heads, 
or defensive arms such as bronze sheet belts, helmets, or breast plates for hors-
es were found. Apart from three bronze arrowheads, all of these objects are 
missing in Tomb 36.
At the same time, Tomb 36 contained an impressive accumulation of valu-
able and sometimes even unique finds.18 In this tomb, four gold vessels of high 
quality were found. Furthermore, almost all the anthropomorphic figurines 
from Marlik were discovered there.19 Of particular interest is a hollow gold 
figurine or bust of unknown function that represents an unparalleled object 
within the archaeology of Iran (Plate  19.3).20 Other remarkable finds from

Richly furnished warrior burials are usually equipped with one decorated gold beaker 
and, in some cases, a number of other metal vessels. This concerns Tombs 2, 24, 27, 32, 45, 
47, 50, and 52. Tomb 26 contained two gold vessels. The beakers found in Tombs 47 and 52 
had been placed in front of the body near the hand or face of the deceased.
19	
Six hollow pottery figurines, two solid-cast bronze figurines with conical headdresses, and 
a miniature pottery model of a chariot with an armed charioteer were found in Tomb 36 
(Negahban, Complete Excavation Report, 110–113). Apart from Tomb 36, anthropomorphic 
figurines have only been found in two other tombs at Marlik. First, two seated hollow pot-
tery figurines from Tomb 24 should be mentioned. They were designated by Negahban, 
Complete Excavation Report, 124–125, as bearing “decidedly human characteristics.” In 
fact, it is more likely that these figurines were intended to depict humans. A small pottery 
figurine of an archer from Tomb 52 is comparable to the charioteer figurine from Tomb 
36. It should be noted, however, that these two figurines are not hollow. Female bronze 
figurines with conical headdresses and pierced ears are known from the art market, but, 
so far, the only examples of this type found during the course of a scientific excavation are 
those from Marlik Tomb 36. Two bronze male figurines from Tomb 13 are much smaller 
and cruder.

Comparable ornaments and techniques can be observed on some objects found in the 
so-called “dépot funéraire” that was discovered near the temple of Inshushinak at Susa. 
De Mecquenem, “Offrandes de fondation,” 61–130. This deposit also contained a number 
of disc pendants with astral ornamentation that closely resemble some finds from Marlik. 
Another remarkable object found at Susa is a bronze beaker that was compared by Amiet, 
Elam, 472, with finds from Kalar Dasht and Marlik. Relations between Elam and northern 
Iran are also attested by imported cylinder seals of Elamite origin and almost identical

Fibulae, Chronology, and Related Considerations
Tomb 36 are a gold seal ring21 and a gold cylinder seal, the latter being most 
probably the only locally manufactured cylinder seal found at the site.22 Last 
but not least, the only fibula reported from the necropolis of Marlik was also 
discovered in this tomb.23
	
Trial and Error
The fibula from Tomb 36 is a fragmentary elbow fibula. It is made of bronze 
and belongs to a type that is well known from other sites in the ancient Near 
East (Figure 19.2).24 Comparable pieces have usually been dated to the late 8th 
or early 7th century b.c.25 Therefore, Muscarella concluded that Tomb 36 was 
closed around 700 b.c. and proposed a date within the Iron Age iii period.26 
On the other hand, he clearly recognized that not all the objects from this 
tomb should be dated to the 8th–7th centuries b.c. and noted that some of the 
mace heads found at Tchoga Zanbil. Amiet, “Autour de Marlik,” 311–315, and “Marlik et 
Tchoga Zanbil,” 44–47; Negahban, Weapons, 33–34. It would be very interesting to inves-
tigate the relationship between the Late Bronze and early Iron Age of northern Iran and 
the Middle Elamite Period, but such an inquiry is beyond the scope of this contribution.
21	
So far, this seal ring is a singular find in northern Iran. Comparable rings made of gold 
sheet are known mainly from the art market, e.g. from plundered archaeological contexts. 
Because of its resemblance to a Middle Elamite cylinder seal, Porada, Ancient Iran, 78, 
dated a similar seal ring from the art market to the 12th–11th centuries b.c.
22	
Calmeyer, “Mesopotamien und Iran,” 347. In contrast, bronze stamp seals are surely a 
typical local product of northern Iran. Many similar examples have appeared on the art 
market, but only at Marlik were such seals excavated during a scientific investigation. 
Recently, a bronze stamp seal that may also belong to this group was excavated in a burial 
at Kaluraz, just a few kilometers west of Marlik. See Khalatbari, “Kavoš dar Kaluraz,” 122. 
However, due to the poor quality of the illustration, it is not possible to identify the design 
on this seal.

finds might be “curated heirlooms” from the later 2nd millennium b.c.27 Being 
fully aware of the uncertainties and the provisional character of his proposals, 
he strongly emphasized the necessity of a final publication for Tepe Marlik, 
stating that “creative and intelligent comment cannot occur until all the tombs 
are fully published.”28
Nevertheless, it soon turned out that his comments were of particular im-
portance for the archaeology of northern Iran. A few years later, Ernie Haerinck 
published a paper in which he tried to establish a chronological framework for 
the Iron Age of Gilan.29 At that time the available material came almost exclu-
sively from poorly published cemeteries. Excavations of settlements that could 
provide a vertical stratigraphy based on superimposed layers were almost non-
existent or remained unpublished.30 Furthermore, due to the aforementioned 
unsatisfactory state of documentation and publication, a horizontal stratigra-
phy based on a seriation of the grave furnishings was also not practicable.
Haerinck arranged the pottery and metal finds from Marlik and other cem-
eteries (Ghalekuti, Lasulkan, Lameh Zamin, and Tomadjan) in typological 
groups and defined three phases to subdivide the Iron Age of Gilan: Iron i, ii, 
and iii.31 Iron i (15th/14th–11th centuries b.c.) is the longest and most impor-
tant phase. According to Haerinck, all of the tombs at Tepe Marlik were built 
and used during this period. Iron ii (10th–9th centuries b.c.) was interpreted 
as a transitional phase. Finally, Iron Age iii was said to cover the 8th and 7th 
centuries b.c.
After an examination of the published evidence, Haerinck came to the con-
clusion that some tombs in Gilan were built during the course of the late 2nd 
millennium b.c. and were later re-used during the early 1st millennium b.c.  
As a case study, he analyzed the contents of Grave 14 at Tomadjan.32 Further

Muscarella, “Fibulae and Chronology,” 417. He later assigned a number of tombs that 
contained comparable finds to the same chronological horizon that he had proposed for 
Tomb 36 (i.e. the early 1st millennium b.c.), while he dated other tombs with typical Iron 
i objects to the later 2nd millennium b.c. See Muscarella, Bronze and Iron, 32, 98–99, and 
102–104, for his proposals regarding the date of Tombs 18, 24, 26, 27, 32, 33, 44, 47, and 52.

Most probably, the settlement that was associated with Marlik was located at a mound 
called Pileh Qaleh, just a few hundred meters east of the cemetery hill, where Negahban 
was able to excavate a sequence of 17 superimposed strata. Regrettably, however, the re-
sults of his investigations were never published in detail. For a short summary see Negah-
ban, Complete Excavation Report, 11.

Fibulae, Chronology, and Related Considerations
­evidence for this theory came from some well documented tombs at Ghalekuti i  
in the high valley of Dailaman.33 In Tomb C–I at Ghalekuti, a skeleton in 
stretched supine position was placed on the bottom of the burial pit (Figure 
19.3a). The funerary gifts consisted of dark grey or brownish pottery and bronze 
weapons. This inhumation was covered by a hard, dark soil, while the upper 
part of the tomb was filled with a lighter, softer soil. The dead who were exca-
vated in the upper parts of the tomb were buried in a flexed position or placed 
leaning against the walls of the grave’s pit, accompanied by mostly brick-red 
pottery and some bronze and iron weapons (Figure 19.3b).34 The excavators 
proposed that “the near relatives of the dead and his slaves were buried togeth-
er with the deceased.” They noted that the iron and bronze weapons placed 
with the skeletons in the upper layer “might have had religious meanings to 
protect the grave.”35
Due to the significant differences concerning the positioning of the deceased 
and the funerary objects, Dominique Cinquabre rejected the ­interpretation of 
the excavators and suggested that these two layers were most probably not 
contemporary.36 Haerinck proposed that Grave C–I and some other tombs at 
Ghalekuti I were built during Iron i and used again for secondary interments 
during Iron iii.37 This, in turn, led him to Muscarella’s article on the fibula from 
Tomb 36 at Tepe Marlik. Haerinck noted that “the vast majority” of the finds 
belonged to the later second millennium b.c. and that the tomb obviously 
“was used again at a later period.” In his opinion the fibula belongs to a second-
ary interment that occurred during the 8th or 7th century b.c.38
These ideas were later picked up by other authors. In her detailed study on 
decorated metal vessels, Ulrike Löw listed four tombs at Marlik with mate-
rial from both Iron i and Iron ii/iii and discussed the possible existence of 
Age ii/iii. A secondary burial was interred shortly thereafter, during the Achaemenid 
Period. Piller, “Northern Iran,” 63–65.
33	
The burial sites of Ghalekuti i and ii were partly excavated by a Japanese expedition dur-
ing the early 1960s. These investigations, unlike those at Marlik, were swiftly and fully 
published within a few years (Egami, Fukai, and Masuda, Dailaman i; Fukai and Ikeda, 
Dailaman iv). To date, Ghalekuti remains the best documented prehistoric cemetery in 
southern Gilan.
34	
According to Egami, Fukai, and Masuda, Dailaman i, 4–5, remnants of at least ten skel-
etons were discovered in the upper layers of Grave C–I. Some of them were placed on top 
of the covering stones.

A New Approach: The Horizontal Stratigraphy of Tepe Marlik
In 1996, Muscarella’s demand for a full publication was finally fulfilled: 
­Negahban published two volumes entitled Marlik: The Complete Excavation 
Report, and provided detailed information on every object group as well as a 
description and an inventory list for all the excavated tombs at Marlik and the 
neighboring sites of Gheshlagh, Zeinab Bejar, and Ali Karam Bagh.41
With the newly available data, the present author developed a chronologi-
cal scheme for the relative and absolute dating of the necropolis of Marlik. 
This was achieved by a seriation based on a typological categorisation of the 
finds and their occurrence in certain tombs (Figure 19.4).42 The result was a 
combination table consisting of 109 types (the finds) and 30 units (in this case, 
the tombs).43 The designations used in the table indicate the chronological 
sequence of the graves (from left to right) and the types (from top to bottom). 
In other words, the oldest tombs of the cemetery are situated in the top left 
corner of the table, while later graves can be found in the central part and the 
lower right corner. Clusters in the table represent the chronological phases of 
the necropolis.44
Altogether, three sequenced chronological stages have been defined and la-
belled with Roman numerals. The initial phase of the cemetery is represented 
by Stage i, followed by Stage ii, which was subdivided into two phases, Stages 
IIa and IIb. Stage iii, the last phase, is concentrated in the lower right corner of 
the table. It must be stressed, however, that there is no cultural or typological 
break in the sequence of burials at the site.
In a further step, the results of the seriation were transferred onto the plan 
of the necropolis. Interestingly, it turned out that the tombs that were assigned 
41

The applied method resembles more or less a contextual seriation as described by ­Renfrew 
and Bahn, Archaeology, 126–127. Due to the insufficient state of knowledge, a frequency 
seriation is not possible with the available data. Furthermore, it should be pointed out 
that the results of this seriation do not reflect the exact chronological order of the tombs. 
It is only possible to define chronological groups. For additional information see Eggert, 
Prähistorische Archäologie, 206–221.
43	
It should be noted that, according to the excavator, eleven tombs (9, 22, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 
43, 46, 48, 51) did not contain any finds at all. In four tombs (11, 37, 49, 53) only one object 
was found, while in another eight tombs (6, 7, 8, 17, 20, 21, 39, 42), a typological connection 
with other graves was not possible. Therefore, these 23 tombs could not be included in the 
seriation.
44	
Other possible interpretations such as gender-specific or sociological reasons could be 
excluded for various reasons. See Piller, “Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 
133–136.

to these chronological stages are grouped in different areas of the cemetery. It 
can therefore be assumed that these tomb groups represent the “layers” of the 
horizontal stratigraphy at Tepe Marlik (Figure 19.1).
	
Stage i—The Early Marlik Culture
The initial stage of the cemetery includes Tombs 10, 12, 14, 15, and 23. Tomb 50 
represents a special case to which we will return to later in this paper. Tombs 11 
and 17 may also belong to this phase, but, due to the lack of evaluable material, 
this cannot be statistically secured. Almost all tombs of this period are situ-
ated in the central northern part of the cemetery. Most of them were carefully 
constructed, more or less rectangular and roughly oriented in a southwestern–
northeastern direction (Figure 19.1).45
During all phases, weapons play an important role in the cemetery of ­Marlik. 
In Stage i, all weapons and tools are made of bronze. Iron objects are com-
pletely absent. Diagnostic weapons of Stage i are simple dagger blades with 
short tangs (Figure 19.5), tanged spearheads with ovate blades and a ridge-
stop (Figure 19.6), and a variety of arrowheads.46 Almost identical daggers and 
spearheads occur in graves at Ghalekuti and Ghiasabad in the high valley of 
Dailaman and at Gohar Tepe in Mazandaran.47
Another important group of diagnostic finds comprises personal orna-
ments and jewelry. Disc pendants of gold sheet with incised astral ornaments, 
toggle pins with knobbed heads and decorated upper shanks, and plain or 
twisted earrings of thick gold wire occur mainly or even exclusively during the 
­initial phase at Marlik. Comparable objects have been found in various regions 
45	
Rectangular tomb constructions of comparatively high quality seem to be characteristic 
for this period. Comparable structures were excavated at Ali Karam Bagh, Ghalekuti, and 
Ghiasabad. Only recently, parts of an obviously contemporary cemetery were excavated 
by Iranian archaeologists in Boyeh near Amlash (personal communication from the exca-
vators). It is to be hoped that the results of these investigations are published in the near 
future. Other early tomb types in Gilan include stone circles at Lasulkan and the dolmen-
type graves of the Talesh region. In the sedimentary coastal plain of eastern Mazandaran, 
tomb constructions of stone or other material are missing: at Gohar Tepe and Qaleh Kash, 
only simple pit graves have been excavated so far (personal observation by the author).
46	
The tanged daggers of Marlik can be subdivided into several variants. See Piller, “Untersu-
chungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 85–87. The hilts of these daggers consisted of wood 
or bone and are not preserved.
47	
For Ghalekuti see Egami, Fukai, and Masuda, Dailaman i, plate lv; plate lxiv; plate lxxix,

of Ghiasabad is unknown. A preliminary report was published by Moghadam, “Prospec-
tion archéologique,” 133–136. At Gohar Tepe, three burials with typical Late Bronze Age 
pottery also contained spearheads of this type (personal observation by the author).

The pottery corpus for Stage i consists of monochrome burnished ware of dif-
ferent colors. Pattern burnishing is very rare and appears only on some jars 
(Khalatbari, Archaeological Investigations in Talesh, figure 62–65). The excavator proposed 
to date Dolmen 1 as contemporary with the Urartian Period (Khalatbari, Archaeological 
Investigations in Talesh, 63–67). This was later rejected by other authors (Vahdati, “Marlik 
and Toul-e Talish,” 134–135; Piller, “Northern Iran,” 62–69).

excavated at Ghalekuti, Ghiasabad, and Gohar Tepe.50 Furthermore, a variant 
of the so-called basins can also be considered to be characteristic for this ini-
tial phase of the necropolis (Figure 19.7c).51

The first phase of Stage ii consists of Tombs 24, 26, 27, 32, 33, 36, 47, and 52, all 
situated in the northeastern part of the cemetery (Figure 19.1).52 In some cases, 
the deceased was placed in a flexed position on a stone slab and accompanied 
by a large number of weapons and other burial goods, with the upper part of 
the body covered with numerous buttons made of gold, bronze, shell, or frit 
(Plate 19.2b).53
According to the current state of research, the production of decorated met-
al vessels starts at the very beginning of this phase.54 Of particular importance 
are two stylistic groups that were defined by Löw as Stilgruppe 13 and Stilgrup-
pe 15.55 The Babylonian and Assyrian background of Stilgruppe 13 (Plate 19.4) 
suggests an increasing impact of Mesopotamia on the material culture of the 
southern Caspian region. Granulation and other metalworking techniques are 
­“Landscape Archaeology,” 249, figure 9), and Gohar Tepe (Mahfroozi and Piller, “First Pre-
liminary Report,” 191, figure 19, 2–3).
50	
At Ghalekuti, only the richly furnished graves such as A–V and E.6 contained spouted 
vessels (Egami, Fukai, and Masuda, Dailaman i, plate lii,17; Fukai and Ikeda, Dailaman 
iv, plate li,11). For some examples from Gohar Tepe see Mahfroozi and Piller, “First Pre-
liminary Report,” 182–183, figures 6 and 8.
51	
It seems that basins are restricted to southern Gilan. Other examples of this variant have 
been found at Ghalekuti (Egami, Fukai, and Masuda, Dailaman i, plate lii, 25), ­Ghiasabad 
(Moghadam, “Prospection Archéologique,” 136, figure 3), and Djamshidabad (Fallahiyan, 
“Jamshidabad,” 230, figure 12).
52	
Tombs 37 and 53 probably also belong to Stage IIa, but they did not contain enough evalu-
able material.
53	
Most probably, the buttons were originally sewn onto an outer garment of the deceased. 
This custom is attested for Tombs 47 and 52 and possibly also for Tomb 26.
54	
Piller, “Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 243.
55	
For Stilgruppe 13, see Löw, Figürlich verzierte Metallgefäße, 169–187. This group is mainly 
based on the so-called babylonische Gruppe defined by Calmeyer, “Mesopotamien und 
Iran,” 342. Calmeyer proposed that these vessels were imports from Mesopotamia, al-
though Löw, Figürlich verzierte Metallgefäße, 512, was able to show that they were manu-
factured locally somewhere in northern Iran.

Fibulae, Chronology, and Related Considerations
further developed. Another new feature of Stage IIa is the appearance of zoo-
morphic and anthropomorphic hollow figurines that were most probably used 
for pouring out liquids.
In addition, there is a significant development in weapon technology. Sim-
ple tanged daggers are replaced by types with a massive cast-on bronze hilt 
(Figure 19.5). Large warrior burials often contain elaborately crafted bronze 
mace heads. Although there are some contacts to areas outside the Alborz 
Mountains, most of the weapons of Marlik Tepe are distinctly localized.56
In many respects, the monochrome burnished pottery of Stage ii clearly 
stands in the tradition of the preceding Late Bronze Age. However, a number 
of new techniques and forms appear. The most frequent shape is the jar with 
vertical handle (Figure 19.7e). Different types and variants were found in nu-
merous tombs of Stage ii.57 Pattern burnishing disappears and is replaced by 
impressed bands, plastic ribs, and rows of pricks. Spouted vessels have also 
changed significantly. The double-bent spout is now usually attached more or 
less halfway between the rim and the base of the vessel (Figure 19.7d). Ovoid 
vessel bodies are replaced by globular or elongated forms.58
	
Stage IIb
This large phase comprises Tombs 13, 16, 18, 19, 25, 29, 30, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, and 
parts of Tomb 50.59 All of them are situated in the southeastern part of the 
hill, immediately south of those from the preceding Stage IIa (Figure 19.1). As 
already indicated above, Stages IIa and IIb are closely related and share a con-
siderable number of types. Nevertheless, there are significant differences be-
tween the two phases.
56	
Some of these mace heads can be compared with finds from the southern Caucasus, 
while others are possibly imported from Luristan or Elam (Negahban, Weapons, 25–32).
57	
Negahban, Complete Excavation Report, 222–226. A bronze jar of this type was found in 
Tomb 26 (Negahban, Metal Vessels, 72).
58	
A similar development can also be seen at Gohar Tepe in Mazandaran (personal observa-
tion by the author).
59	
The exact chronological position of Tombs 30, 39, 40, 41, 42, 49, and 51 remains unclear. 
In fact, there are some indications that these contexts should also be attributed to Stage 
IIb. As already indicated above, Tomb 50 represents a special case. A typological analysis 
of the funerary goods shows that most of the jewelry and personal ornaments are com-
parable to those of Stage i, while the weapons and the decorated metal vessels find close 
parallels in Stage IIb. Thus, it is possible that this rectangular, well-built tomb with its 
southwest-northeastern orientation might have been constructed in the early phase of 
the cemetery, but re-used during the second phase of Stage ii.

378
Stilgruppe 13 and Stilgruppe 15 are replaced by other stylistic groups of deco-
rated metal vessels in Stage IIb.60 Furthermore, heavy solid-hilted daggers are 
no longer produced. Now, the daggers usually have flanged hilts and narrow 
triangular blades (Figure 19.5). For the first time, daggers with crescent guards 
and spearheads with sockets instead of tangs appear.61 Iron is now processed 
for the production of weapons, but only on a limited scale. A dagger from Tomb 
25 represents the first bimetallic object from the cemetery.62 Pottery figurines 
and jars with upright handles are still produced. New shapes include cubic jars, 
flat plates, and a new variant of basins (Figure 19.7h–i).63
	
Stage iii—The Late Marlik Culture
The tombs that are attributed to this stage (Tombs 1, 2, 3, and 5) are concentrat-
ed near the northwestern periphery of the hill (Figure 19.1). Tombs 6 and 7 may 
also belong to this phase, but they had been plundered before the excavation 
and contained only a few finds.64 All these structures are more or less similar 
in size and often poorly constructed. Furthermore, it appears that the burials 
are less well equipped than those of the Classic Marlik Culture. What fits in 
with this picture is the fact that decorated metal vessels are now mostly made 
of bronze instead of gold.
Nevertheless, some of the finds are still comparatively impressive, such as a 
gold belt buckle with inlays of lapis lazuli and a gold beaker with representa-
tions from the “life of a goat” that were found in Tomb 2.65 Stylistically, there 
are close connections to the preceding Stage IIb, but also to some metal vessels 
60	
Stilgruppen 4, 5, 7, 11, and 12. All of these groups are closely related to each other. Fur-
thermore, there are numerous comparisons with the stylistic groups of Stage iii (Piller, 
“Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 202–206).
61	
Three socketed spearheads of different shape from Tombs 27, 29, and 44 were grouped 
together by Negahban, Weapons, 71, as Type viii C. The spearheads from Tombs 27 and 
29 were found in transitional contexts between Stage IIa and Stage IIb. Tomb 44 belongs 
to Stage IIb. In Graves A–V, C–II, and C–IV at Ghalekuti, socketed spearheads are already 
attested during the Late Bronze Age (Egami, Fukai, and Masuda, Dailaman i, plate lv, 47; 
lxxxi, 16; lxxxiii, 1). Similar spearheads were also found at Boyeh (personal communi-
cation from the excavator).

from Kaluraz.66 Daggers and spearheads are mostly variants of types that were 
already in use during Stage IIb (Figures 19.5–19.6). Again, the best comparisons 
so far were excavated at Kaluraz.67 A number of object groups such as mace 
heads or garment pins are no longer present.
Hollow zoomorphic figurines are still produced, but obviously only in limit-
ed numbers. Unfortunately, most of the pottery from this phase remains more 
or less unknown. Only a few vessels were published in Negahban’s Complete 
Excavation Report. However, it seems that most of the pottery shapes of the 
Classic Marlik Culture such as jars with vertical handles no longer exist.
	
Absolute Dating
Due to a variety of reasons, the absolute dating of these chronological ­stages 
remains difficult. First, there are no written sources that could help us to 
­reconstruct the background of the Bronze and Iron Age cultures of northern 
Iran.68 Second, the material culture of this region is highly localized and shows 
only a few connections to other regions.69 Imports such as cylinder seals, mo-
saic glass vessels, or mace heads provide only vague indications for the abso-
lute dates of the tombs.70 The same applies for the external influences that are 
identifiable on the decorated metal vessels.71 And third, apart from a few C–14 
66	
This gold beaker belongs to Löw’s Stilgruppe 6 (Löw, Figürlich verzierte Metallgefäße, 
130–140). Stylistically, the closest comparisons can be found in Stilgruppe 17 from Kaluraz 
(Löw, 200–207, 438–440, 449–450). This would fit with the results of the seriation at Mar-
lik (Piller, “Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 206).
67	
Most of the daggers and spearheads found at Kaluraz represent types that also occur in 
Marlik Stage iii (Hakemi, “Kaluraz Gilan,” 6). Similar daggers have recently been exca-
vated in tombs at Shahryeri in the province of Ardabil (Azarnoush and Helwing, “Recent 
Archaeological Research,” 218, figure 40).
68	
Reade, “Hasanlu, Gilzanu,” 179–180, suggested that the area defined by the Marlik Culture 
could be identical with Gizilbunda, a country mentioned in Neo-Assyrian sources. How-
ever, this must be rejected for geographical and chronological reasons.

For an assessment see Piller, “Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 236–237.

In fact, the influence of Old Babylonian and even Akkadian art can be seen on vessels 
that were most probably manufactured during the later second millennium b.c. See Löw, 
Figürlich verzierte Metallgefäße, 356–358, 370–374, 452–455. However, most of the exter-
nal comparanda are from the art of the Mittani, Middle Assyrian, Middle Elamite, and 
Middle Babylonian empires, and should therefore be assigned to the second half of the

dates of sometimes dubious character,72 there are no scientific data from this 
area. However, due to recently published material and new fieldwork in north-
ern Iran, we are now able to outline the main features of the Late Bronze and 
early Iron Ages in this region.
The Early Marlik Culture of Stage i shares numerous common aspects with 
sites in Gilan and Mazandaran such as Ghalekuti, Ghiasabad, Djamshidabad, 
Tul-e Talesh, and Gohar Tepe. Obviously, Marlik Stage i was part of a com-
prehensive cultural complex that covered the entire southern Caspian region. 
It has been proposed to call this period Late Bronze Age.73 In addition, good 
comparisons can be found in the Sumbar Valley in Turkmenistan, in north-
western Iran, and even in the Levant. These comparanda have been indepen-
dently dated between the 17th/16th and the 14th/13th centuries b.c.74 However, 
we can assume that the few tombs at Marlik that are assigned to this phase do 
not cover the whole period. Thus, a date between the 15th and 13th centuries 
should be reasonable for Marlik Stage i (Figure 19.8).75
Stage ii marks the beginning of a new era. Most of the objects that are usu-
ally considered as being typical for Marlik belong to this period. These include 
metal vessels with figural decoration, heavy daggers with solid-cast hilts, bronze 
mace heads and belts, as well as gold pins with animal heads. ­Anthropomorphic 
and zoomorphic figurines and pottery jars with impressed and/or pricked 
bands are also regularly found in this stage. Garments with numerous sewn-on 
buttons are restricted to this period only. Finally, the development of decorated 
metal vessels with strong Mesopotamian influences begins now. It seems that 
Marlik Stage ii was integrated in a far-reaching cultural and economic network. 
Therefore, it makes sense to call this stage Classic Marlik Culture.
For absolute dating of this stage, the best focal point is Stilgruppe 13, a group 
of metal vessels showing Babylonian and Assyrian influences. These vessels 
were obviously manufactured within a considerably short period of time, 
2nd millennium b.c. Most of these comparanda date between the 14th and 12th centuries 
b.c. There is virtually no external influence that postdates the 11th century b.c.
72	
There is only one C–14 date from Marlik. According to Negahban, Metal Vessels, 95, the 
sample was taken from Tomb (grid) xvd and dates to 1457 +/− 55 b.c. However, it is clear 
that this isolated sample will not suffice for the scientific dating of this particular context.
73	
Piller, “Untersuchungen zur relativen Chronologie,” 241–242; Piller, “Landscape Archaeol-
ogy,” 242. This means that Haerinck’s Phase Iron i is now subdivided into the Late Bronze 
Age (Marlik Stage i) and the Iron Age i (Marlik Stages IIa, IIb and iii).

Fibulae, Chronology, and Related Considerations
­maybe even in the same workshop.76 All tombs containing vessels of Stilgrup-
pe 13 can be assigned to Stage IIa. Due to the remarkable parallels with the 
glyptic of the second dynasty of Isin, it is highly probable that this group of 
metal vessels should be dated roughly to the 12th century b.c.77 Some presum-
ably early tombs of Stage IIa have good connections to Stage i. Therefore, we 
can assume that the transition between Stages i and IIa took place during the 
13th century b.c.
Stage IIb closely follows Stage IIa. Some tombs can be regarded as transi-
tional contexts between the two phases. Based on the above, Stage IIb may be 
dated approximately to the 11th century b.c. Iron is now used for dagger blades 
and spearheads, but bronze is still predominant. The first occurrence of bime-
tallic daggers fits in well with the proposed dating of this stage.
In some respects, Marlik Stage iii stands clearly in the tradition of the 
preceding phase. This concerns the pottery, some weapons, and the stylistic 
groups of the decorated metal vessels. There are, of course, changes in the ma-
terial culture, but a break in the local sequence could not be observed. Many 
objects that are typical for the Classic Marlik Culture of Stage ii are now miss-
ing. On the other hand, there are loose typological connections to the weapons 
and metal vessels from Kaluraz Tepe, a site that is usually regarded as belong-
ing to the early 1st millennium b.c.78
It should be emphasized, however, that diagnostic Iron ii/iii material is 
not reported from Tepe Marlik.79 Therefore, we can assume that the cemetery 
­ended before the beginning of Iron ii, i.e. presumably around 1000 b.c. or 
­slightly later.80 Stage iii is best characterized as a transitional phase between 
76	
Löw, Figürlich verzierte Metallgefäße, 181, states that “für keine andere Stilgruppe lassen 
sich derartige Regeln aufstellen.” This demonstrates the exceptional position of this sty-
listic group of decorated metal vessels.

Dyson, “Questions and Comments,” 10; Haerinck, “Iron Age in Guilan,” 72, n. 14. Recently, 
a large amount of pottery excavated by Hakemi during the 1960s was published by Ohtsu, 
et al., Preliminary Report, 9–27. Virtually all of the pottery vessels can be assigned to Iron 
ii or Iron iii as defined by Haerinck.
79	
The typical pottery of Iron iii in northern Iran is the so-called Orange Ware (Dyson, 
“Questions and Comments,” 11–12; Haerinck, “Iron Age in Guilan,” 73). Typical Orange 
Ware was found at Zeinab Bejar and Gheshlagh in the immediate vicinity of Marlik, but 
not in the necropolis on the mound. Negahban, Complete Excavation Report, plate 101, no. 
499, and plate 112, no. 605. Orange Ware is also reported from Pileh Qaleh (Piller, “Land-
scape Archaeology,” 250, figure 10).

A large-scale re-use of the stone-built tombs during the early first millennium b.c. seems 
rather unlikely. However, a few later finds were recovered, such as jars with a vertical

the ­Classic Marlik Culture (12th/11th centuries b.c.) and that of Iron Age ii 
(10th–9th centuries b.c.) and should therefore be designated as Late Marlik 
Culture (Figure 19.8).
	
Conclusions and Outlook
In conclusion, we can now attempt to place Tomb 36 within this chronological 
scheme. Two of the decorated metal vessels from this tomb can be attributed 
to Löw’s Stilgruppe 13. Other examples of this group have been found in Tombs 
26 (Plate 19.4), 32, and 52. The hollow gold bust (Plate 19.3) belongs to the so-
called Marlik Local Style that was included in Löw’s Stilgruppe 15. Other objects 
decorated in this style are a metal vessel from Tomb 24 and a gold disc and 
two hollow gold lion heads from Tomb 26. All tombs containing examples of 
Stilgruppe 13 and Stilgruppe 15 belong to Stage IIa.
Zoomorphic bronze and pottery figurines are typical for the Classic Marlik 
Culture of Stage ii. Apart from Tomb 36, anthropomorphic pottery figurines 
were only found in Tombs 24 and 52. As already mentioned above, Tomb 36 
did not contain any daggers, but the daggers that are carried by some of the 
anthropomorphic figurines found in this tomb clearly represent a heavy vari-
ant with solid hilt. This type occurs solely in tombs of Stage IIa. Furthermore, 
the few arrowheads that were discovered in Tomb 36 also belong to types that 
are restricted to Stage ii. A pottery double jar from Tomb 36 is a type that also 
occurs in Tombs 24, 27, and 33. Bowls with cross-hatched incised decoration 
are very rare at Marlik (Figure 19.7f). They have only been found in Tombs 36, 
47, and 52, all of which belong to Stage IIa.
Summarizing the above, it is clear that the overwhelming majority of the 
finds from Tomb 36 are typologically and/or stylistically connected with the 
Classic Marlik Culture of Stage IIa (Figure 19.4). Numerous comparisons con-
nect Tomb 36 with other contexts of this stage, particularly Tombs 24, 26, 47, and 
52. Thus, we can assume that Tomb 36 was built around the 12th century b.c.
handle and a trefoil rim. These vessels were found near the surface in areas without tombs 
(Grid xxvh and xxiil). Negahban, Complete Excavation Report, 228, citing Schaeffer’s 
comparisons with finds from the Talesh region, dated them to the 15th–13th centuries 
b.c. In fact, it is highly likely that these vessels date to the later 1st millennium b.c., most 
probably to the Parthian period. Comparable vessels have been excavated at Kangavar in 
central western Iran and Germi north of Ardabil. See Haerinck, “La céramique en Iran,” 
119–120, and Kambakhsh Fard, Parthian Pithos-Burials, 48–53.

383
Fibulae, Chronology, and Related Considerations
On the other hand, the fibula that was found in the same tomb dates to the 
7th or early 6th century b.c.81 However, due to the complications surrounding 
the excavation, it is impossible to determine the exact find spot and context of 
this important object. It is possible that the fibula was part of a secondary in-
terment that was not recognized by the excavators, but this cannot be proved. 
According to the current state of research, fibulae are not a part of the material 
culture of the Iron Age iii in Gilan.82 It is highly likely that the fibula found in 
Tomb 36 was imported to northern Iran (Figure 19.2). At that time, however, 
Marlik was no longer used as a burial place.
In Gilan, fibulae of distinctive local types only appear in burials dating to 
the following Iron Age iv—the Achaemenid Period (6th–4th centuries b.c.).83 
The relationship of these local types to finds from the southern Caucasus and 
the connections between the Achaemenid empire and the southern Caspian 
region are interesting fields for future research. Thus, Oscar Muscarella was 
absolutely right when he stated that “a single fibula has taken us on a long and 
promising journey, one not yet ended.”84

Pedde, Vorderasiatische Fibeln, 255–256. Fibulae of this type are mostly known from Mes-
opotamia and the northern Levant. Only some scattered finds come from Iran: one from 
Susa and one from Cham Sul in Luristan.
82	
So far, no other fibula dating to the Iron Age iii period has been found in this region.

A Middle Bronze Stele from Hama and Old Syrian 
Cylinder Seals
Barbara A. Porter
A tall basalt stele with relief decoration was recovered from Hama—a multi-
period site located on the Orontes River in central Syria—during the 1936–37 
excavation season undertaken by the Danish archaeological mission. It is now 
in the storerooms of the National Museum in Aleppo. I have not had the chance 
to examine it firsthand, but I have thought about it for some time and have 
given two lectures dealing with its archaeological history and iconography. The 
first presentation was delivered in October 2004 in New York at the meeting of 
Near Eastern archaeologists called the Marching and Chowder ­Society. There 
is a certain irony in presenting this article in honor of Oscar, as the first talk 
that I heard him give was at the gathering of this very society in the 1970s at 
Columbia University, when I was one of the student volunteers. Fortunately, in 
the years following, I was able to get to know him as a colleague and friend, and 
I am pleased to be part of this special tribute.
At the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale at the Oriental Institute 
of the University of Chicago in July 2005, I expanded on this topic. Because I 
moved to Jordan in spring 2006 to become the director of the American ­Center 
of Oriental Research (acor), I was unable to contribute to the published con-
ference papers.1 I was in contact with the Danish National Museum where the 
archival materials from the Carlsberg Foundation excavations of Hama are lo-
cated and was greatly assisted by curatorial staff members who provided in fall 
2005 several archival photos to be used for a future article on this piece.2
The Hama stele registered as 6B 599 is approximately 2.85 m high and is 
carved in relatively low relief; its surface is now quite worn (Plate  20.1).3

installation of the Near Eastern collection, including Hama material, and she kindly arranged 
the scanning of the archival photos.

A Middle Bronze Stele from Hama & Old Syrian Cylinder Seals
The width at the base is 90 cm, and it tapers at the top to approximately 52 cm 
and varies in depth from 24 to 53 cm.4 It is divided into three basic fields with 
the lower part—approximately a third of the whole—undecorated to a height 
of 85 cm; the middle section depicting a heraldic double-headed eagle-like 
creature fills a space 1.04 m high; and the top section (height 92 cm) contains a 
scene with two human figures (one seated, the other standing) on either side 
of a table or offering stand. At the very top there is a wide crescent.
Stele Hama 6B 599 was found during the sixth excavation season (1936–37) 
of the work that was conducted at Hama from 1931 to 1938 by the Danish ar-
chaeological mission headed by Harold Ingholt. When discovered, the stele 
was positioned as a doorsill in the entrance area of Building iii of Level E 
(Plate 20.2).5 This reused/recycled piece was face up, and the top was directed 
to the north. The building that it was found in is located on the southeast slope 
of the large tell, and there were standing lion sculptures (6B 597 and 6B 598) on 
either side of the entranceway, Room A. On the eastern side of Room A was a 
crouching lion (6B 602) with its head oriented toward the open court, Room B. 
This sculpted lion figure lay immediately south of the stele, which was placed 
on its back beside another large basalt block.6 The sculptural decorations were 
all considerably cracked, and this is attributed to fire damage during the de-
struction of Hama in 720 b.c. by King Sargon ii of Assyria.7
Given that the stele was found in a secondary context, it was duly assigned 
to an earlier phase. The official publications have all ascribed it to the imme-
diately preceding Level F and given it a date of approximately 1000–900 b.c. 
The Danish publications have included this dating in the preliminary report 
by the principal excavator Harald Ingholt in 1940;8 in the volume published in 
1958 concerned with the architecture before the Hellenistic period by the main 
project architect, Ejnar Fugmann;9 and in the 1990 volume prepared by Poul 
4	 Riis and Buhl, Les objets, cat. no. 48, 56–59; this descriptive entry provides the most complete 
set of dimensions and a full bibliography up to 1980. The authors commented that when the 
stele was examined in 1975 in Aleppo it was in a somewhat fragmentary state (p. 58).

ment of the stele as a doorsill and figure 229 (p. 184) showing the stele set upright, similar to

In 1942 Ingholt also presented the major finds from Hama in a short article 
in the American Journal of Archaeology, because his preliminary report for 
the years 1932–38 had not reached America in great quantities (clearly due to 
World War ii).11 In this article Ingholt simply placed the stele in the period of 
Hama Level F (text and caption), which he described as the period of the Sea 
Peoples, but did not note its actual find spot in the subsequent Level E.
In Winfried Orthmann’s important 1971 study of Neo-Hittite (späthethitisch) 
art, he included the Hama stele but commented that it probably belonged 
rather to the “syrisch-phönizischen” sculptural realm.12 In Heinz Genge’s study 
of North Syrian and southern Anatolian reliefs, he recapitulated the previous 
attributions and suggested that it likely belonged to the tenth century b.c. and 
represented a local style of Hama. Genge also commented on the crude qual-
ity of the carving.13 P.J. Riis, in his 1987 popular book written in Danish sum-
marizing the Hama excavations, illustrated the stele and provided a date of

was a member of that team at Tell Sukas. In 1975 Ingholt entrusted them with this final 
publication. For dating, see Riis and Buhl, Les objets, 58. They also suggested that the stele 
belongs to the end of the period F1 (ca. 900 b.c.). Riis made reference to the Iron Age date 
(ca. 1000 b.c.) in Riis, Hama, fouilles et recherches, 200; this is the first of the final reports 
to have been published.

A Middle Bronze Stele from Hama & Old Syrian Cylinder Seals
ca. 900 b.c.14 This stele and its find spot were also noted in two encyclopedia 
articles on Hama15 but not included in Alessandro de Maigret’s published dis-
sertation on the Aramaic Citadel of Hama.16
My interest in this sculpture evolved from my research on Old Syrian popu-
lar style cylinder seals for my Columbia University dissertation, particularly 
with regard to representations of furniture in scenes with seated male figures.17 
As I was working on Middle Bronze Age material from Syria, I came to believe 
that the stele should be dated within the Middle Bronze Age (ca. 2000–1600 
b.c.) and not the early Iron Age, based on the comparanda that I was studying. 
It should be noted that already in 1940 Ingholt cited, as parallels to the offering 
stand on the stele, similar examples on two cylinder seals that are included in 
my corpus of Middle Bronze Syrian seals. One example is in the Bibliothèque 
Nationale in Paris (Plate 20.3),18 and the other is in the University of Pennsyl-
vania Museum in Philadelphia.19 A cylinder excavated at Ugarit (rs 25.170) and

published by Pierre Amiet is a good example of this scene in glyptic repre-
sentations, although in this case there is another attendant behind the seated 
figure.20
In the process of my research, I discovered that in the early 1990s both 
Paolo Matthiae21 and Frances Pinnock22 had each reattributed the stele to the 
­Middle Bronze Age. An article by Silvana Di Paolo23 published in 2006 in a 
volume presented in honor of Professor Matthiae discussed this stele in the 
context of several relief-decorated sculptures. The stele from Hama comes 
into play particularly for the detail of the male figure seated in front of a laden 
stand or table. At this juncture the Hama stele is now considered an example 
of “iconic stelae of the Middle Bronze Age i–ii (roughly 2000–1600 bc) discov-
ered in Syria.”24 The detail of the offering table on the Hama example is also 
cited by Nicolò Marchetti in a discussion of an Old Syrian seal impression from 
­Sippar.25 Pinnock’s long article concerned with the Hama piece will remain the 
basic source for considering iconographic details, and she had the benefit of 
studying the stele in the Aleppo National Museum storeroom.26
In light of the number of Middle Bronze relief-decorated stelae and basins 
(complete and partial) uncovered in the Italian excavations (and before) at Tell 
Mardikh/Ebla,27 it has been possible to place the Hama stele in a ­sculptural

As her 1992 article was published in the Italian scholarly journal Contributi e Materiali 
di Archeologia Orientale (cmao), which is not available in all libraries and is written in 
Italian, it may be less read than should be the case. One reason that I wanted to write this 
article even though some of the same points have been made by Pinnock is that I realized 
several scholars involved in Syria had not been aware of the stele and its redating to the 
Middle Bronze period.

The literature on the relief-decorated stone sculpted objects from Tell Mardikh is exten-
sive. The basalt basin from Temple B1 (found in part before excavations but joining a frag-
ment found in Temple B1 of the Lower Town) depicts in the middle of an upper register 
a seated figure with a pointed cap facing right toward an offering stand, and a standing 
male figure who holds a cup is on the opposite side. Initial publication by Matthiae, “Le 
sculture in basalto,” 69–71, plate 68:2. This important piece of comparative evidence has 
been published many times since and was discussed and illustrated in Pinnock, “Una ri-
considerazione,” 113, figure 3a, and Di Paolo, “Relief Art of Northern Syria,” plate 3b.

setting that did not exist when it was first excavated.28 The Italian excava-
tions at Ebla also recovered a fascinating relief-decorated basalt stele (frag-
ment TM67.E.224 joined TM83.E.85 and TM85.G.350), which is preserved to 
a height of 1.5 m (top missing) and is ascribed to Sanctuary G associated with 
Temple D.29 As its base was found in situ to the left of the entrance of the small 
sanctuary, it shows where the stele stood in antiquity30 and provides at least 
one example for the placement of such sculptures in Middle Bronze Syria.
At the time of the Danish excavations, the Iron Age and the role that Hama 
played in Biblical accounts were emphasized. Ingolf Thuesen has pointed out 
that the Carlsberg Foundation was interested in Hama for the Danish mission 
to Syria because the historical sources showed that Hama was an important 
Aramaic kingdom in the Iron Age, and the excavation primarily focused on the 
first millennium b.c.31 Thus it is certainly not surprising, given the nature of 
the evidence at the site and the knowledge of sculptural traditions in Syria and 
southern Turkey as established by the 1930s, that the possibility of a Middle 
Bronze date was not even considered.
In the previous literature cited, there have been descriptions of the carved 
relief images and different interpretations of what is represented. Some of the 
details observed in the discussions will be considered now as the scenes are 
described. The thick crescent that is placed at the top, according to the ob-
servations by Ingholt, did not have a star inside it.32 However, Riis and Buhl 
describe a radiating star, and Di Paolo described a four-pointed star, while Pin-
nock suggested that there may possibly be a star within the crescent.33 Both 
with and without would be normal in the Old Syrian popular style cylinder seal 
imagery.34

A careful re-reading of Pinnock’s 1992 article (“Una riconsiderazione”) led me to the prob-
lematic discussion by Sabatini, “Thèmes iconographiques,” 36–37, figure 8, in which the 
offering table of the upper scene on the Hama stele and Fugmann’s Iron Age dating are 
used to support her hypothesis that the sculpted material being found at Ebla should not 
be dated to the Middle Bronze Age.

Below the crescent there is a unified scene. On the right, a male figure is 
seated on a cross-legged stool and faces left toward a table. This figure with-
out beard has short fulsome hair and is wearing a long garment. In his raised 
right hand is a small bowl.35 He holds against his chest the bottom part of a 
straight object that is held in his left hand. As the top of the object being held 
is close to the right edge, it is uncertain what was originally depicted. It was 
likely meant to be a scepter (finial missing), as suggested by Ingholt and Orth-
man, but weapons have also been postulated—namely an axe by Riis and Buhl 
(fenestrated type) and Di Paolo (flat blade)—or possibly a curved staff as put 
forth by Pinnock.36 A curved staff is held by a seated male figure represented 
in a basalt sculpture found at Ebla/Tell Mardikh (TM.88.P.627; H. 1.08 m, Idlib 
Museum), and although seated on a straight-sided chair and with the bowl 
in his right hand resting on his lap, this male figure is in many ways a three-
dimensional version of the seated figure on the Hama stele. This large, well-
preserved statue from Tell Mardikh was first published in 1989 by Matthiae,37 
who considered the individual depicted to be a high dignitary. Later, when 
­crescent is represented on 60 images (i.e. almost 50%); of these, 33 are without an interior 
astral device (dot star or pointed star), and 27 include one (Porter, “Old Syrian Popular 
Style Cylinder Seals,” 543), thus showing that the presence or absence of an interior astral 
device is not a dominant trait.

A cylinder seal from the former Marcopoli collection depicts a male figure seated on a 
cross-legged stool holding a cup in his raised left hand and facing a table similar to the 
one on the Hama stele; there is an empty crescent moon in the field above. This is an ex-
ample of compositional details on glyptic imagery that provide appropriate comparanda. 
This cylinder was published by Teissier, Cylinder Seals, no. 418 (Porter, “Old Syrian Popular 
Style Cylinder Seals,” cat. no. 27). In my corpus, the Marcopoli seals that have been in-
cluded from Teissier’s publication are nos. 336, 352–356, 366, 369–373, 375–377, 379, 380, 
414, 415, 418, 428, 558–560. The Marcopoli collection was originally formed in the late 19th 
century by members of the family, some of whom were the hereditary Italian consuls in 
Aleppo, and it came up for auction in New York at Christie’s in 1993 (Porter, “Old Syrian 
Popular Style Cylinder Seals,” 123).
36	
The object has been interpreted as a scepter (Ingholt, Rapport preliminaire, 80, as well as 
Thomsen “Review,” 354); a short staff (“kurzen Stab,” Orthmann, Untersuchungen, 373); 
and given the possibly of its being bent as suggested by Pinnock—“insegna, un tipo di 
pastorale ricurvo,” a type of curved crook (“Una riconsiderazione,” 107–108). The alternate 
suggestions that it is a weapon were put forth by Riis and Buhl, as possibly a fenestrated 
axe (Les objets, 56), and by Di Paolo, who conjectured a broad flat blade (“Relief Art of 
Northern Syria,” 145). Chapter 10 of my dissertation (Porter, “Old Syrian Popular Style Cyl-
inder Seals,” 336–370) deals with images of weaponry, and from the details presented it 
is interesting to note that the seated figures within the corpus as formed do not carry 
weapons.

A Middle Bronze Stele from Hama & Old Syrian Cylinder Seals
discussed by Matthiae in 1992, he commented on the curved insignia as some-
thing based primarily on seal imagery that points “to a priestly dignity which 
only seldom, and perhaps only in some urban centres of Northern Syria could 
also be held by the sovereign.”38 He stated as well that it “should be a votive im-
age of a high dignitary, or a priest.”39 This sculpture was included in the hand-
some catalogue Ebla: Alle origini della civiltà urbana, where it is described as a 
statue of a seated dignitary (“dignitario seduto”).40 Another example of a male 
figure seated before a similar offering table while holding a curved scepter is 
found on the bone “talisman” (TM.78.Q.455) from the Tomb of the Lord of the 
Goats at Ebla, and this detail is also cited as evidence by Pinnock.41
In the upper scene on the Hama stele, a male figure stands on the other side 
of the table facing the seated figure and holds a cup in his raised left hand. His 
garment is knee length, and he is proportionally much smaller than the seated 
figure. Between them is a table or offering stand that has a top surface at the 
level of their waists. There appears to be a central vertical support flanked by 
two side supports that meet the splayed feet near the point of curvature at the 
bottom, and the splayed feet seem to terminate in bulls’ feet. Placed on the top 
surface is a rectangle with internal horizontal lines, which is flanked on the 
left by a small triangle and on the right by a small rectangle.42 The base of the 
stand is a more elongated version of the one depicted on the Bibliothèque Na-
tionale cylinder seal (Plate 20.3) showing a seated male figure drinking through 
a tube facing the table with superstructure and a standing male figure. The 
combination of a seated male figure wearing a long robe facing a similar table 
albeit with only two small triangles on the surface is represented on a cylinder 
seal recovered at Tell Bi’a in northern Syria, although here the attending figure 
stands behind. Adelheid Otto has called this a local style seal, and I would in-
terpret it as a good example of Old Syrian popular style glyptic.43

It is very likely that such tables in reality were three-legged. A base of a ba-
salt stand with three feet terminating as bull hooves (and the vertical struts 
broken off) was discovered at Ebla (tm 91.P.717),44 thus a stone replica of what 
were presumably wooden examples. Pinnock included this basalt piece in an 
article on the transmission of iconography and compiled comparanda from 
seal images of Kültepe, and there she also published a very interesting frag-
ment of a stele from Ebla that portrays the upper part of an offering stand 
with splayed legs and struts with an upper superstructure with horizontal lines 
(only partially preserved as this is a fragment), which is a close parallel to many 
examples on seals.45 I would point particularly to the detail on a rare example 
of popular style seals impressed on clay tablets, this one from Alalakh where 
the seal design shows a seated figure drinking through a tube facing right to-
ward a very similar stand (AT/47/27).46
Such scenes with seated figures facing tables or more elaborate stands that 
are usually called offering tables are referred to conveniently in the scholarly 
literature as “banquet scenes.” The interpretation as to the nature of the male 
figures remains one of conjecture and is hard to determine. In the corpus of 
Old Syrian popular style seals, I retained simple descriptive terms, as there are 
rarely indications of royal status or divine nature—as primarily indicated by 
headgear. Irene Winter has pointed out the generally accepted adage that the 
“very act of sitting is synonymous with status in the ancient Near East.”47 It 
proves interesting to review the various theories as to the nature of the seated 
figure on the Hama stele. The first attempt at identification was given by Ing-
holt in 1940 when he stated that the two figures probably represent the king 
and his son or a courtier. However, he then contradicted this comment by add-
ing that, as he considered the table to be an altar, so then the seated figure is 
a god, and the standing figure is the king in front of his god, with the double-
headed eagle serving as a divine emblem.48 In 1942 Ingholt stated that “one of 
this article, so am able to provide the correct citation therein (Otto, Siegel und Siegelabrol-
lungen, cat. M1; 26–27, pl. 36, 1a–c).

A Middle Bronze Stele from Hama & Old Syrian Cylinder Seals
the Hama kings of this time [period of the Sea Peoples] is no doubt portrayed 
and he is served by a courtier, or his son, the little scene as if borne and sus-
tained by his royal emblem, the double-headed eagle.”49 However when one 
looks to the caption of the illustration of the stele, one reads “king or god with 
double-headed eagle (Level F),” thus again revealing two different points of 
view.50
The preference for interpreting the seated figure as divine was followed 
in much of the commentary that followed in the subsequent decades.51 Riis 
and Buhl postulated in their 1990 publication that the standing figure could 
be royal—and more specifically a successor of King To’u known from bibli-
cal accounts and as suggested in earlier appraisals. A king is thus represented 
standing in front of a seated deity to whom the sanctuary could have been 
dedicated.52 This same idea was included in a footnote in Ingholt’s 1940 re-
port.53 It is of course uncertain that the stele was placed in an earlier building 
at the exact same location, but Riis and Buhl expressed their belief that it did 
belong to the prior building of Hama period F1, adding the caveat that it could 
perhaps have come from a nearby context.54 They also stated that because the 
stele was dedicated by a local king to a god, the building itself is to be consid-
ered a sanctuary.55
In the last three decades, the discussion about this stele has tended to view 
the seated figure not as a deity but rather as a royal personage, and the change 
has come about primarily through the study of the sculptures found at Ebla 
and cylinder seal imagery. This is summarized by Di Paolo, who considers the 
“celebrant” always to be the king.56 In her article reconsidering the Hama ste-
le, Pinnock primarily used descriptive terms, and she noted that there is no

­specific characteristic that would determine royal or divine status of the seated 
figure.57 However, when discussing the offering table in another context, she 
stated that “it is usually represented in front of personages seated at a banquet, 
or in cult ceremonies including a libation,” and the table is thus seen to be 
“usually represented in scenes connected with cult or with royal characters, 
engaged in rituals or in funerary ceremonies, as happens in the Eblaic talisman 
and in the stele from Hama”—thus siding with the idea that the seated figure 
is likely royal and noting that she believes that the “banquet is, in itself, a typi-
cally royal ceremony.”58 In appraising what we know of comparative material, 
I have favored a human versus divine nature for the seated figure—and clearly 
of high status.
The double-headed creature dominates the central part of the stele. As 
noted above, its interpretation in relationship to the scene at the top varies 
as to whether the seated figure is considered to be a god (thus divine symbol) 
or king (thus royal emblem). The two divergent heads appear to be leonine, 
although they are not well articulated, and the thick body has wing-like protru-
sions and a central tail flanked by splayed legs—thus projecting to the modern 
eye a heraldic pose. The example here used to illustrate such creatures in the 
glyptic realm is a seal from Alalakh/Tell Atchana (AT/48/70), now in the An-
takya Museum (Figure 20.1). It was found in the floor of the Level xii temple 
and first published by Leonard Woolley in 1955 and included in Dominique 
Collon’s catalogue of the seals excavated by Woolley.59
Such spread-eagled creatures with two heads usually identified as leonine 
(although their appearance can be more that of a bird or raptor) are found on 
several Old Syrian popular style seals included in my corpus—among others, 
another from Alalakh,60 one in Copenhagen,61 and one from the former Poche 
Collection formed in Aleppo62—as well as on an example that I was not able 
to include, a cylinder from Tell Mardikh/Ebla found as a surface find in the 1988

A Middle Bronze Stele from Hama & Old Syrian Cylinder Seals
season.63 The double-headed creatures depicted on these seals are much more 
angular than the more rounded and fuller-bodied version that dominates the 
center of the Hama stele. Those mentioned here from my dissertation were all 
listed by Edith Porada in her discussion of crossed felines on a cylinder seal from 
the Jarre Montet found at Byblos.64 Often the 1972 book by Ilse Fuhr-­Jaeppelt 
on the iconography of the lion-headed eagle Anzu-Imdugud is invoked when 
referring to these creatures, and she included both Alalakh cylinders in her 
­discussion.65 A succinct description of Imdugud is given by Jeremy Black and 
Anthony Green, who noted that Imdugud is the Sumerian name of the mon-
strous bird called Anzû in Akkadian. The creature is described as “bird-like but 
having the head of a lion, and of gigantic size so that the flapping of its wings 
could cause whirlwinds and sandstorms.”66 As pointed out by Franz Wigger-
man, it is likely that Mesopotamian images incorporated into areas like Syria 
and Anatolia took on different meanings reflecting “native theologies.”67 This 
creature surely played a protective or apotropaic role. In this regard it is worth 
pointing out that a person of normal height would have gazed directly at the 
creature if the stele was installed at ground level. Even if the lower undecorated 
part of the stele was set in the ground (partially or fully), the doubled-headed

creature would still have been the main scene when gazing at the upright stele 
and inherently a powerful image.
In considering its secondary find spot, I was intrigued by earlier ideas about 
the nature of the reuse. When the stele was first presented by Ingholt he stated:
le changement violent de dynastie et de classe dominante, que présup-
pose une telle dégradation de la stèle, pourrait, en effet, être identifié avec 
l’arrivée au pouvoir des Sémites araméens après la défaite des représent-
ants de la civilization de notre niveau, événement qui, probablement, a 
eu lieu aux environs de l’an 1000.68
Thomsen followed suit in his review and noted that “Man dürfte dann anneh­
men, dass die hier um das Jahr 1000 v. Chr. eindringenden Aramäer das alte 
Königsgeschlecht beseitigt und die Stele zur Schwelle in einem ihrer neuen 
Gebäude erniedrigt hätten.”69 Thus both are suggesting the possibility that the 
stele was deliberately reused as an act of disrespect to the rulers of Hama be-
longing to the previous dynasty.
I have not been able to pursue very far the scholarly literature on the reuse of 
sculptured objects as a deliberate act of dishonor, but I noted with interest the 
reference cited by Di Paolo, in a brief listing of sculpted material from Ugarit 
and Alalakh, to a basalt orthostat in “imperial Hittite style” (AT/40-45/2) that 
was reused as a step in the temple of Level i at Alalakh.70 This block is sculpted 
on one face with an image of a Hittite king whose name was read for Woolley 
by H.G. Güterbock as “Tutkhaliya, the great-…, the king’s son,” and Güterbock 
pointed out that from the inscription it was not possible to determine which 
king of that name is represented.71 Woolley suggested it should be Tudhaliya 
iv, and in discussing it in his 1955 book in the section on stone sculpture he 
placed it under Level iii—not as actually found in Level i b. He described it

A Middle Bronze Stele from Hama & Old Syrian Cylinder Seals
as coming from a flight of stone steps flanked by reused lion sculptures, where 
“one of the two basalt slabs left in the upper stair proved to be a Hittite royal 
relief representing one of the Tuthaliyas and his wife; it had been used upside 
down as a paving-slab, and it is not too fanciful to assume that this was a delib-
erate insult to the foreigners who had once been the masters of Alalakh.”72 This 
sentiment is repeated in Woolley’s popular account of his excavations, A For-
gotten Kingdom, where he noted that “one of the slabs forming the treads was a 
royal relief of Tudkhalia, Great King of the Hittites in 1250 b.c. (plate 15a), laid 
face downwards and turned to base uses.”73 Given that the decorated surface 
was face down and would not have been visible, this statement is to my mind 
unconvincing but still of interest for the sentiment it expresses.
In considering the stele in its reused state, the new dating some eight hun-
dred years earlier than originally considered changes how it would have been 
perceived when employed as a doorsill. It was thus not a monument carved 
in relatively recent times but one belonging to individuals who were likely no 
longer remembered. Given its size and weight, it could not have been easily 
moved, so perhaps it stood for many centuries and then was deemed no longer 
worthy of display and/or veneration. Its weight can be estimated at more than 
2,000 kgs (4,500 lbs), so it would have taken some effort to remove it from one 
place to another.74
In recent years Ingolf Thuesen has reappraised the Middle Bronze Age in 
Hama known from the strata ascribed to Period H by the original excavators. 
He has done this primarily through the ceramic remains and shown that it was 
a substantial phase in the history of the tell.75 He even identified one building 
that was partially excavated and belonged to Phase H3 as a “public building of

Solid basalt weighs 3011 kg per cubic meter and 188 pounds per cubic foot. I calculated via 
the Amlink Marble link, the minimum weight by giving its full height and suggesting it 
was a solid basalt stone column with a diameter of .55 m; as noted above the width and 
depth vary, and it is the depth of .25 to .53 m that I cannot determine, but the width of 
.52 to .90 m based on the photos shows that it tapered only slightly. Thus this postulated 
weight is likely to be a low estimate and is still impressive. The calculated total weight of 
such a basalt column is 2039 kgs and 4496 lbs.

palatial character.”76 Thus the Middle Bronze levels of Hama could certainly 
have accommodated such an artifact as the stele under study.
Although we shall never know where Hama Stele 6B 599 originally stood 
(although somewhere on the tell of Hama to be sure), the consensus of schol-
arship today is that it was a considerable heirloom when it was reused. Clearly 
it was no longer a venerated object when it became a surface on which people 
would walk. When it was considered to belong to the immediately previous 
period as discussed above, there was the notion that this was intended to be 
an act of deliberate disrespect to the previous dynasty. The evidence brought 
to bear here shows that this idea is now unlikely given the elongation of the 
period of time, and its reuse can be considered in a more practical light.
I had hoped to examine the stele in the Aleppo Museum before I com-
posed this article, but current events have made that impossible. Thus it has 
been instead my pleasure to think of Hama in ancient times as well as in the 
1930s when the Danish excavations were undertaken. Their final reports cited 
throughout this article have conveyed the archaeological results, and later 
generations have been able to work with them to further our understanding 
of ancient Syria. However to get the flavor of Hama in the 1930s and the ex-
cavation setting, one can happily turn to Ejnar Fugmann’s watercolors in the 
thoroughly enjoyable book produced by the Danish Institute in Damascus in 
2002 and compiled by Alexandra Nilsson (thirty images of Hama now in the 
Danish National Museum), and a few of the same in her slightly earlier article 
in the volume in honor of P.J. Riis.77 However, to be amused by the black-and-
white sketches done by Fugmann, one must find P.J. Riis’s 1990 general book on 
Hama (in Danish), where excavation antics and serious business are captured 
with wicked wit and clever line.78 These images are the sort that I imagine 
would amuse Oscar, and as they convey the spirit of a closely knit excavation 
team they might well invoke memories of times shared on excavations in far

chapter 21
A Unique Human Head-Cup from the Environs of 
Tel Qashish in the Jezreel Valley, Israel
Irit Ziffer, Edwin C.M. van den Brink, Orit Segal, and Uzi Ad
During the course of salvage excavations conducted in April–May 2010 on 
behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority within a field ca. 150 m north of 
Tel Qashish in the Jezreel Valley, near where the Qishon stream debouches 
into the Zebulon Valley, a small cave containing more than 200 complete ce-
ramic artifacts, some of them specialized, as well as a nearby smaller cache 
of some 20 similar objects were unearthed (Plate 21.1).1 The eclectic collection 
of objects uncovered at this site includes a faience vessel and hundreds of 
terracotta objects including tall fenestrated stands, “incense burners,” gob-
lets, chalices, and imported Mycenaean and Cypriot wares.2 Presumably these 
caches, which are dated to an advanced phase of the Late Bronze Age ii, 
derive from a nearby temple or shrine. The present paper offers a detailed 
study of a singular artefact from the cave’s repository, a ceramic goblet with a 
sculpted human face.
	
The Goblet (Figure 21.1, Plates 21.1–21.3 a–b)
The wheel-thrown head-shaped goblet is made of pinkish clay with white and 
grey large grits (Plate 21.2 (a–d)); the core is pinkish-grey (height: 25.5 cm, rim 
diameter: 10.5 cm). The trumpet-shaped pedestal was separately turned and 
joined to the egg-shaped cup, unique among the cup forms found in the cave. 
When found, the sherd carrying the face (Plate 21.3 (a–b)a) was preserved in 
1	 Van den Brink and Ad, “Tel Qashish.”
2	 Van den Brink, et al., “A Late Bronze Age ii Repository,” 423. Segal, et al., “The Excavation of a 
Repository,” in press. According to Nicole Strassburger, the careful placement of the vessels, 
many of which were found intact, their arrangement into separate groups, and the stairs 
hewn in the cave wall for easy access and departure, indicates that the cave served as a hid-
ing place for cult paraphernalia, to be retrieved at some point. See Strassburger, “Favissae in 
Israel/Palestine,” 204.

407
A Unique Human Head-Cup from the Environs
its entirety from the face down to the throat and behind the ears, as well as 
the forehead. On the back of the mask-like head (Plate 21.3 (a–b)b) smooth, 
regular wheel-marks are visible, indicating that the human face was hand 
modeled by adding clay to the wheel-turned cup when dry, though not quite 
leather-hard.3 Irregular strokes of red paint cover the goblet’s exterior and the 
face.
This large goblet is different from any of the other footed cups in the cave 
assemblage in that it is egg shaped. Generally, all these goblets (sometimes 
referred to as chalices) belong to a class of trumpet-footed cups of the Late 
Bronze Age, initially inspired by Egyptian faience lotiform goblets. In the 
Canaanite ceramic repertoire, however, such cups may take on a variety of 
shapes, and are frequently painted with geometric and figural designs.4
Our cup is modeled in high relief without a hairdo, and the head occupies 
the middle part of the cup, harmoniously equidistant from the rim and the 
top of the foot, distinguishing it from other head-cups where the forehead or 
the headdress merges with the rim. The slanting eyes are clay balls pressed 
into an almond form, where a groove was impressed to delineate the eye-
ball from the eyelid. Each of the crescent-shaped eyebrows was formed by an 
added coil, tapering at the outer end, and bevel-incised in a fishbone pattern, 
indicating the hairs. The prominent flaring nose has two large depressions 
for nostrils. The mouth was formed by a thick coil, grooved in the middle, to 
show parted lips. There is a finely modeled philtrum with a medial depression 
between the nose and the upper lip. Below the lower lip, a clay pellet was 
applied and impressed in the middle to create a chin dimple. The ears were 
carefully modeled with accentuated pinna folds and a cartilaginous border 
surrounding the outer ear canal. The face was originally covered with red 
paint, as can be seen from the photo taken right after the face fragment was 
uncovered (Figure 21.1 and Plate 21.3 (a–b)a). No facial hair is indicated, and 
hence the face is female.
3	 Had the face been mold impressed, one would expect to see depressions on the back side as a 
result of the potter’s fingers having been pressed against the inside of the cup to facilitate the 
molding process, a procedure that can be observed inside Egyptian vessels carrying Hathor 
heads; see Bourriau, Umm El-Gaab, 37–38, no. 52, and 56, nos. 55–56; Arnold and Bourriau,

Comparanda and Discussion
There is no painting added to enhance the facial features, as is the case with the 
female-headed cup from Tel Dan (Plate 21.4), where the eyes and brows were 
painted in brownish-black over the yellowish white face,5 and the magnifi-
cent male-headed goblet from Tell Brak (Figure 21.2), dated to the mid-­second 
millennium,6 as well as the parallel painted fragments from Tell Fakhariyya and 
Tell Billa7 and the Iron Age female cup from Gezer8 (Figure 21.3). The potter 
who turned our cup rendered the facial features with great plasticity, finding 
its closest parallel in the human-headed cup from Pella in Jordan,9 with brows 
joined at the bridge of the nose, having a fishbone pattern, as well as the slant 
of the eyes, the deep depressions indicating the nostrils, and the modeling of 
the ear convolutions (Figure 21.4). Fishbone-patterned eyebrows also charac-
terize the Tel Haror cup,10 where the iris was indicated by incision (­Figure 21.5). 
Both the Haror and the Pella cups were covered with thick red paint, as was the 
female-headed cup from Megiddo x11 (Figure 21.6). On the Megiddo and Pella 
cups, selected facial zones were left unpainted: eyebrows, eyes, the sides of the 
face, and lower jaw and chin on the example from Megiddo; eyes, brows, tem-
ples, and ears on the Pella cup—the part below the mouth did not survive. On 
the Tel Haror cup fragment, the eyes and brows were painted ­yellowish-white. 
The dimple on our lady’s portrait may be compared to the naturalistic dimple 
below the mouth on the intact female-headed faience cup from Ebla, origi-
nating from a domestic context in the Lower City, whose destruction in the 
17th century is attributed to the Hittites (Figure 21.7), and to the dimple of the 
­Hathoric face on a gold pendant from Tell el-Ajjul.12

The Ebla cup, which rests on the tips of the Hathoric locks, as well as a small

temples at Ashur and Tell Abu Hawam.14 The goblets of this class are tall, with 
an average height of 15 cm, and have a trumpet foot. The head occupies the 
area above the stem, the slightly conical shape above being suggestive of a tall 
headdress. A wooden relative of the faience female-headed cups is a cup in 
the shape of a woman’s head in the Glasgow City Museum, Burrell Collection. 
Carved from a single billet, hollowed out inside, this wooden goblet stands on 
a tall trumpet foot, its rim merged with the ornate headgear. The provenance 
given was “from an Egyptian tomb.” However, the style discloses a Levantine 
origin, supported by the wood species—prunus—common in northern Syria 
and Cyprus.15
The locally produced ceramic human- and animal-headed cups, an integral 
category of Canaanite art and cult objects, were studied in detail recently.16 
Their production in Canaan began as a specialty of Tell el-Yahudiyeh potters, 
and is related to a new vogue that spread through the cultural centers of Ana-
tolia and Syria during the early second millennium b.c.
The shape of the Canaanite head-cups varies—from a simple bowl shaped as 
an animal head to an elaborate goblet standing on a trumpet foot,17 as with the 
almost life-size bearded head-cup from Jericho (Plate 21.5). The ­female-headed 
vessel from Gezer (Figure 21.3) also stood on a foot, joined to the cup by means 
of a conical projection at its bottom—a feature that occurs on footed chal-
ices.18 The thickened lower part of the Megiddo fragment and its inclination 
(Figure 21.6) hint that this cup too had originally been footed.
	
The Cup in Context
The Canaanite clay cups represent a humble version of precious metal drink-
ing vessels mentioned in written tablets from Mari and Alalakh.19 Unfortu-
nately, the Mari and Alalakh documents do not mention the production of 
human-headed cups, nor do they explain why certain animals were selected to

be elaborated on this special class of cups. At Mari, the mere idea of the head 
seems to have had an apotropaic function, although the head-cup was never 
explicitly connected with a divinity. The head-shaped cups at Mari do not ap-
pear with sacred furnishings, and some were produced in series.20 Anatolia in 
the Assyrian Colony period witnessed a co-existence of animal and human-
headed cups, as corroborated by the actual finds from Kültepe.21 An artful vari-
ety of head-cups appears on the Tyszkiewicz seal, dating from the 17th century 
b.c., where on the cylinder scene two animal-headed cups are represented 
among the funerary goods under the cremation scene and, by analogy, on the 
stamp base, a central vessel is surrounded by head-shaped cups of a frontal 
lion, a bull, a lion, a human head in profile, an eagle, and a caprid.22 Hittite 
cult inventories of the 13th century b.c. indicate a direct connection between 
divine animals and the theriomorphic cups and rhyta (Akkadogram bibru, 
plural bibri, Sumerogram gú, “neck”) of the gods. These were at once the vase 
and the image of the god. Thus the image of the weather god of ­Kunkinija 
was a wooden bull bibru standing on all fours, overlaid with silver.23 The nu-
merous rhyta recovered, including the silver fist cup in the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts24 and the exquisite Schimmel vessels in the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art,25 may have been used as divine representations.26 A pedestal vase from 
Kültepe, monochrome burnished, has the face of a bearded man on the front 
and a smooth-faced woman on the back27 (Figure 21.9). The handles, in the 
shape of horns, which were applied in pairs running along the sides of the ves-
sel, point to the divine nature of the two entities represented.28
Our cup is remarkable not only for its ovoid shape, but also for its size, 
which bring to mind the drinking vessels offered to Baal in his victory feast. 
Drinks are offered to Baal in two vessels: a cup—ks, and a krpn, which is placed 
in his two hands and described as “A large vessel great to behold, A container

However, it should be stressed that the term krpn refers to the extraordinary 
size of the drinking vessel, not to the head-cup shape, which, as we know from 
the inscribed (before firing) clay lion-headed cup from Ugarit, was called pn, 
literally “face,” and dedicated to the god Reshep the protector.30 Nor is it con-
nected to the gold vessel ap w npš ksp w hrs, “snout and neck of silver and gold,” 
which denotes the zoomorphic vessel in the shape of a recumbent animal or 
protome.31 One is reminded of the Sumerogram gú in Hittite texts used to 
describe an animal-shaped vase.32
Head-shaped cups were found in temples and in tombs, evidence of their 
use in temple cult and funerary rites. The Megiddo goblet was found in the 
sacred precinct, stratum x, and the Tel Haror female-headed cup was retrieved 
from the Migdol temple. At the temple of Tell Abu Hawam the ­female-headed 
faience goblets were found together with faience ram-headed cups near a 
standing stone, massebah.33 The Hathoric hairdo of the Ebla faience female-
headed cup (Figure 21.7) led Mazzoni to the conclusion that it was meant to 
represent a Hathor-type goddess.34 In this vein, one may claim that Canaanite 
female-headed cups were related to a local goddess. Two Middle Bronze Age 
rhyta in the shape of a woman might be cited in support of such a claim. The 
first, an anthropomorphic Tell el-Yahudiyeh juglet from Jericho, had a female 
head on top of its neck (Figure 21.10). The filling hole is in the crown of the 
head and the pouring hole in the mouth. The head rises above a stylized tree, 
which grows from the base of the juglet and functions as a body to the woman’s 
head, pointing to her role as the nurturing tree. The tree trunk is flanked by a 
bearded man, a horned animal, a fish, and birds. The symbolic role of the juglet 
cannot be overlooked: when filled through the top opening, the liquid would 
flow from the goddess’s mouth, watering humankind and animals alike.35 The 
other rhyton (now fragmentary), in the shape of a naked woman, comes from 
the ritual court B in the Hyksos Palace at Tell el-Dab‘a, where banquets took

place (Plate 21.6).36 Since nudity was one of the attributes of the goddess Ishtar 
and her Levantine counterparts,37 this rhyton too represents a deity.
The Hittite documents inform us of animal bibri that were used for offer-
ings and libations, and that at certain ceremonies and festivals drinking was 
done “with” or from an animal-shaped vessel, identified with the theriomor-
phic head-cups, ištu bibri. As for the king and queen drinking from an ani-
mal bibru, such as a lion standing on all four legs (lion for the god Zababa), 
the drink was poured from the container into individual cups.38 As mentioned 
above, the theriomorphic drinking vessels were conceived as the divine im-
age. Moreover, the liquid contained in bibri was also deified. Thus the drink 
is poured from a silver eagle-shaped bibru into earthenware cups from which 
the celebrant drinks. Similarly, the worshipers drink from a dgal-zu, the 
deified cup (Akkadian kāsu, Ugaritic ks). Drinking a god, the liquid, or from a 
­drinking vessel which was the god, was for humans the most intimate means 
of partaking of the divine character or even the soul of a deceased deified king 
or queen.39
The nature of the Qashish Cave repository, comprising, among other finds, 
cultic stands and an abundant variety of goblets as well as lavish imported 
goods, points to its origin in a temple or shrine. One cylindrical stand has a 
stylized human figure standing in its uppermost window frame.40 This stand 
immediately recalls the two four-sided tower-shaped stands from the Canaan-
ite temples of Beth Shean, where human figures appear in the openings and 
snakes wind up the wall. On one of these stands the standing human figure 
holds two birds, probably doves.41 On the other stand a figure with a well pro-
nounced pubes (preserved from the waist down) sits in the uppermost open-
ing. A lion is modeled on the adjacent wall.42 The lion and doves are age-old 
attributes of the goddess. By analogy, it seems plausible that the figure on the 
Qashish cylindrical stand also was female. If the female-faced Canaanite gob-
let carried the same meaning as its Anatolian forerunners, it may, along with 
the figure on the stand, have represented the deity worshiped in the temple 
whose furnishings were ritually buried in the cave.

Back to the Future: Memory, Nostalgia, and Identity 
in the 12th Century b.c.e. on Paros
Robert B. Koehl
I offer the following contribution to Oscar Muscarella, a scholar who never 
shies away from debate or controversy, but who is motivated by one goal: to 
set the record as straight as the evidence will allow. Over the past fifteen years 
there has been a dramatic escalation of scholarly interest in the 12th ­century 
b.c.e. Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean, a century that could be said to 
straddle the Bronze and the Iron Ages, the latter era being the one to which 
our dedicatee has devoted the lion’s share of his profound and prolific career.1 
This century bore witness to enormous social and political upheavals and re-
configurations in these regions, brought on by the widespread collapse of Late 
Bronze Age Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean palace-based societies and the 
movements of significant numbers of peoples triggered by these events.2
Several general points may be made which will serve to frame the discus-
sion from an Aegean point of view. One of the characteristics of Mycenaean 
civilization during its heyday in the 14th and 13th centuries b.c.e., or Late Hel-
ladic (hereafter, lh) iiia-b, is its rather homogenous material culture, be it 
domestic or funerary architecture, small portable objects (e.g. seals and ivory 
carvings), or ceramics, an observation that has led Aegean scholars to refer 
to a ­Mycenaean koine or common style.3 This cultural homogeneity may be 
due to the broad-based power and influence of a centralized authority which

For a recent summary of lh iiia-b culture, see Shelmerdine, “The Palatial Bronze Age.” In the 
present paper, the terms Mycenaean and Late Helladic are used interchangeably to denote 
the Late Bronze Age of Greece, including the islands. However, when referring to the con-
temporary ceramic styles, the term “Mycenaean” is privileged, as it connotes a culture, rather 
than a region.

­emanated from various palatial centers, probably the capitals of autonomous or 
semi-autonomous Mycenaean kingdoms that supported and controlled work-
shops and production centers. With the destruction of the Mycenaean palaces 
at the end of the 13th century, for reasons that still remain obscure, came the 
virtual disappearance of time-honored luxury crafts, such as seal stone and 
ivory carving, and wall painting.4 Furthermore, by the beginning of the 12th 
century, or lh (Mycenaean) iiic period, the ceramic koine of lh ­iiia-b gave 
way to numerous regional or local ceramic styles.5
The changes in Aegean Bronze Age culture and society engendered by the 
dramatic events at the end of the 13th century have also had a significant im-
pact on modern scholarship’s ability to interpret and understand life in the 
12th century Aegean. In the absence of historical documents, modern scholars 
have depended primarily on the sequence of Mycenaean ceramics in defining 
the Aegean relative chronology.6 Furthermore, scholars have inferred various 
historical events from the archaeological remains associated with these rela-
tive periods, such as the Mycenaean conquest of Crete and the destructions of 
the mainland palaces, as well as cultural developments, such as the expansion 
of Mycenaean overseas contacts.7 Linear B, the Mycenaean writing system, 
while apparently used solely for administrative purposes, has still provided in-
valuable information on the political, social, economic, and religious structure 
and organization.8
However, Linear B disappeared with the collapse of the palaces ca. 1200 
b.c.e., thus depriving scholars of an important source of information for the 
subsequent era. Furthermore, because of the disintegration of the ceramic 
koine and the concomitant rise of regional styles, it has proven difficult for 
scholars to reach consensus on the ceramic phases and terminologies that 
would form the basis for a lh iiic relative chronology, let alone reconstruct

the history and social and political organization of Greece in the 12th ­century.9 
What does seem clear, broadly speaking, is that various regions of Greece re-
sponded differently to the changed world of the 12th century with regard to 
settlement patterns, burial customs, and material culture, and that these re-
sponses could vary within regions, such as the Cyclades.10
This paper draws attention to one specific site, the Mycenaean settlement 
on the summit of the Koukounaries Hill on Paros, whose characterization, 
dates of construction, destruction, abandonment, and re-occupation are seen 
to vary significantly among scholars. We begin with a brief description of the 
site, followed by a discussion of its stratigraphy and relative chronology, and 
conclude with a suggestion that may not only help explain why these issues 
persist, but simultaneously may shed light on how the inhabitants of the Kouk-
ounaries Hill responded to the time in which they lived.
	
The Mycenaean Building on the Koukounaries Hill
The Koukounaries Hill is a limestone outcropping 75 meters high, located on 
the southwest shore of the Bay of Naoussa, in the northwest of Paros, the second 
largest Cycladic island after its neighbor, Naxos (Plate 22.1). Excavations were 
conducted there from 1976 to 1991 under the direction of Dr. D.U. Schilardi for 
the Greek Archaeological Society.11 The hill was first inhabited by a small Final 
Neolithic–Early Cycladic I settlement, dated in absolute terms approximately 
from the end of the 4th millennium to the early 3rd millennium b.c.e.12 After 
this settlement was abandoned, the hill was not inhabited again until approxi-
mately one thousand eight hundred years later, in the 12th century.
During the intervening years, the most important habitation on the island, 
at least from the Early Cycladic iii through the Middle Cycladic, was on the

Kastro of Paroikia, overlooking the Bay of Paroikia on the west coast of the is-
land, based on the excavations of Otto Rubensohn at the beginning of the 20th 
century.13 Rubensohn found only twenty Mycenaean vases, dating to lh iib 
(ca. 1450–1400), lh iiia:1 (ca. 1400–1350), and lh iiic.14 Their small number, 
and the lack of associated architectural remains, may indicate that the My-
cenaean presence on Paros was sporadic and minimal. Indeed, the Kastro, 
and perhaps the island generally, may have been largely uninhabited during 
lh iiia:2–iiib:1, the heyday of the Mycenaeans. This is somewhat surprising, 
as the central Cycladic islands seem to have prospered at that time, albeit not 
on the level of the mainland centers.15 Surveys conducted under the direction 
of Dr. Schilardi in the Naoussa Bay area from 1970 to 1980 located numerous 
small Early Cycladic settlements, several prominent Late Geometric–early Ar-
chaic settlements, and possibly two Mycenaean settlements of uncertain date, 
besides the habitation on the Koukounaries Hill.16
The Mycenaean building on the Koukounaries Hill sits on a rectangular-
shaped plateau (designated the Upper Plateau) measuring 26 by 33 meters; 
the building dominates the summit and slopes down toward the south. Nearly 
continuous lines of bedrock outcroppings delimit the west and east sides of 
the plateau (indicated on the plan, Figure 22.1, and visible in the photograph, 
Plate 22.2). While defining the width of the building, they may also have been 
left intact to help block the winds that blow there nearly year-round. The 
building’s plan and construction indicate that it was fully conceived at incep-
tion as a single, unified structure based on two intersecting corridors—one 
running east-west and one running north-south—both flanked by rooms 
(­Figure  22.1).17 This plan is a version of the familiar Mycenaean “corridor 
house,” an easily adaptable form of domestic, non-palatial Mycenaean archi-
tecture known from numerous sites on the Greek mainland, dating mostly to 
the 13th century b.c.e.18

The building, which measures approximately 22 by 16.50 meters, appears to 
have had two entrances. One is at the west end of the east-west corridor (la-
beled “gate” on plan, Figure 22.1). Although it does not preserve any evidence of 
a doorway, the corridor widens toward the bedrock that delimits the western 
edge of the building and continues east as a vestibule for a double staircase on 
its south side. This staircase gave access to a large, semi-subterranean store-
room/pantry immediately to its south via the eastern flight and to the upper 
floor, located above the rooms flanking the western side of the north-south

corridor, via its western flight.19 The second entrance, perhaps the main one, 
was at the north end of the north-south corridor (Plate 22.2).20 A small shrine 
was built just south of this entrance, on the west side of the corridor.21 Its lo-
cation in relation to this entrance may be an adaptation of the “gate shrines” 
built into the Cyclopean walls just inside the entrances to several Mycenaean 
citadels.22
This entrance also may have given direct access to the site’s main water sup-
ply. The corridor’s western wall ends at an opening in the bedrock outcropping 
that delimits the northern edge of the building. A possible threshold or land-
ing for a staircase is visible on the surface at the northern edge of the corridor 
(Plate 22.2). It is here that the northern face of the hill drops off abruptly and 
where, in perfect alignment with the north-south corridor, a staircase was built 
into a natural crevice formed by a vertical split in the bedrock. At least four 
steps are preserved in situ, near the top and bottom (Plate 22.3). The steps are 
constructed from flattened schist slabs supported by carefully laid blocks, like 
the stairs that lead to a Mycenaean cave burial on the east side of the hill.23 The 
north staircase leads directly down to the widest part of a freshwater stream, 
fed from the mountains farther north, which to this day flows nearly year-
round, a rarity on the rather dry island of Paros. As no cisterns or wells were 
discovered on the hill, this stream remains the best candidate for the build-
ing’s main water source. In this regard it is worth noting that the late Dr. Sarah 
Bisel interpreted the marks on the skeletal remains of a middle-aged female, 
found buried in the second storeroom, as evidence for severe arthritis which 
she thought may have been caused by lifting heavy objects or even “by carrying 
water in a jar from a distant place.”24
The stream flows past the northeast side of the Koukounaries Hill and 
terminates in a marshy region or estuary that feeds into the Bay of Naoussa.

high ground near marshes for the extra level of defense that the marshes of-
fered, the one on the Bay of Naoussa may also have provided a readily avail-
able source of nourishment, in the form of the fish and fowl that inhabit these 
fecund areas.25 The hill’s inhabitants also had easy access to ample arable land 
in the Kamares Valley, lying behind it. Indeed, the Koukounaries Hill would of-
fer many natural advantages to a new group of settlers. Besides easy access to 
food, its location overlooking the Bay of Naoussa offers an ideal vantage point 
from which external threatening naval operations could be observed, especial-
ly those emanating from the neighboring islands of Naxos, Syros, and Delos, all 
of which are visible from its summit.
The question of its built defenses, one of the most distinctive and impressive 
features of mainland Mycenaean architecture, begs some discussion. The easi-
est approach to the summit is from the south, which slopes downward toward 
the sea and is largely covered with smooth stretches of limestone bedrock; 
indeed, this was the approach used during the excavations. As one ascends, 
there are also terraces, some of which were inhabited during the Iron Age and 
Archaic eras. Schilardi has suggested that the short stretches of east-west walls 
built on these terraces, discovered in the course of excavation, acted as screen 
walls to block or control the flow of traffic up this face of the hill.26
At the summit are two widely spaced bedrock outcroppings whose opening 
was filled with a stone wall 17 meters in length, preserved in parts to a height of 
3 meters (Figure 22.1 and Plate 22.5). This wall is constructed in the well-known 
Mycenaean “shell-wall” technique, comprised of two parallel walls whose in-
tervening space was filled with rubble (Plate 22.4).27 With an average thickness 
of 1.66 meters, its shell walls were built of granite and schist blocks of vary-
ing sizes, some of which measure an impressive 1.50 meters in length and .50 
­meters in height (Plate 22.5). However, as the thickness is less than half that 
of the average mainland Mycenaean Cyclopean fortification wall, Loader sug-
gests that rather than functioning as a defensive wall, it was a retaining wall 
that blocked direct access to the site from the south and supported the terraced 
building constructed against its inner face.28 And rather than characterizing it 
as “Cyclopean,” or “pseudo-Cyclopean,” Loader regards its alternating courses

of large rectangular blocks and thin slabs as a kind of pseudo-ashlar masonry, 
found commonly in the Cyclades during lh iii.29
The wall extends for another 8 meters beyond the western bedrock outcrop-
ping, although here it is constructed in an altogether different manner. The two 
parallel walls are built with even smaller stones, and the intervening space was 
probably left empty (Figure 22.1).30 A partially preserved cross wall, bonded 
to the northern stretch, divides the space into two compartments. That these 
spaces were accessible is suggested by the discovery of three intact Melian ob-
sidian blades near the inner face of the southern wall.31 Surely this extension 
could not have functioned as a fortification wall on account of its flimsy con-
struction. Defense, however, may not have been its purpose. This section of the 
east-west wall juts out from the better built part and has a shallow recess in its 
southern face. Perhaps the recess marks the position of a window, as is thought 
to be the function of recesses in the facades of Minoan buildings.32 This part of 
the wall may thus have had the appearance of a tower, a prominent architec-
tural feature in fortifications of the mainland palatial citadels and non-palatial 
Cycladic sites such as Ayios Andreas on Siphnos and Grotta on Naxos.33 Its 
western end may have originally had a door, providing access on the west into 
the building.
As will be suggested below, the designers of the Koukounaries building 
might have purposely intended its southern façade to recall the fortifications 
of the now-destroyed mainland palatial citadels, their “façades” if you will, in 
the Zeitgeist of lh iiic Middle, seeking to evoke the palatial past by emulating 
its material culture. The building then rises in terraces toward the north.34 The 
first terrace, built against the inner face of the main south wall, is comprised 
of a row of three basement storerooms (Figure 22.1, Plates 22.4–22.5). That the 
building complex was fully conceived prior to its construction is indicated by 
the stone–slab covered drain cut into the floor of the westernmost storeroom, 
which emptied out the main southern wall via an opening built through its 
base (Plate 22.6).

Dates of Destruction, Construction, and Re-Occupation
That the Mycenaean building complex on the Koukounaries Hill was destroyed 
in a violent conflagration is undoubted, as amply documented by the thick lay-
er of ashen debris that filled its rooms and corridors. What has been at issue for 
scholars is the date of this event. In the initial preliminary reports, the ceram-
ics found in the destruction level were dated to lh iiib:2 or to a transitional 
phase, lh iiib:2/iiic, near the end of the 13th century, i.e., contemporary with 
the destructions of the mainland citadels.35 This preliminary dating is under-
standable, since much of the pottery, particularly the unpainted kylikes and 
shallow angular bowls, the painted deep bowls (both of group A and B), and 
linear painted jugs, resembles its Mycenaean iiib counterparts.36 This date 
was lowered in subsequent reports to lh iiic Early.37
In 1981 and in 1982 the present author was invited to study the ceramics from 
the second storeroom. At a conference on Cycladic chronology in 1983, pub-
lished in 1984, it was shown that this pottery was contemporary with a phase 
at Mycenae known as lh iiic “Developed,” the earlier of two stages into which 
lh iiic Middle had recently been divided, and that it was also synchronous 
with phase 2a–3b of the shrine at Phylakopi and phase 1b at Lefkandi.38 At that 
time a “Cyclado-centric” terminology was adopted for this pottery, in recogni-
tion of its distinctly central Cycladic features, which also occur in the ceramics 
at Phylakopi.39 And as it was also thought at that time to represent the earliest 
phase of Mycenaean iiic pottery in the Cyclades, this author suggested it be

called Late Cycladic iiic Early, contemporary with mainland lh iiic Middle 
“Developed.”40 This suggestion, however, is no longer valid, as there are now 
sites in the Cyclades with earlier phases of Mycenaean iiic pottery, such as 
Ayios Andreas on Siphnos, and thus the terminology suggested previously is 
hereby withdrawn.41 The synchronisms, however, remain intact, and the date 
of Mycenaean iiic Middle “Developed” has been confirmed by this author’s 
subsequent studies of other deposits from the site.42
Despite the re-dating of the destruction level to Mycenaean iiic Middle 
“Developed,” however, the lh iiib:2 destruction date continues to be cited.43 
The implications of this date are serious, for it places the lifespan of the Kouk-
ounaries Hill settlement within the palatial era, and thus distorts the position 
of Paros in the Mycenaean palatial world. A destruction date of Mycenaean 
iiic Early has also been cited, which has led to the mischaracterization and 
misinterpretation of the Koukounaries Hill building complex as a “defensive 
settlement,” like those that were built as places of refuge immediately follow-
ing the wave of mainland destructions.44 Rather, its construction, perhaps two 
generations after the collapse of the palaces, as discussed below, reflects a pe-
riod of apparent tranquillity and cultural revival in the Aegean.45 Indeed, its 
prominent position, occupying the hill’s summit, seems to proudly advertise 
its existence. By contrast, settlements justifiably identified as places of refuge, 
like Karphi, and Kavousi’s Vronda and Kastri, on Crete, are tucked into the 
saddles of mountains, making them virtually invisible to the outside world.46
After its destruction in Mycenaean iiic Middle “Developed,” perhaps to-
ward the end of the period, the Koukounaries Hill seems to have been large-
ly abandoned. However, limited areas of the building were cleared out and

­re-inhabited.47 Schilardi first noted that the pottery found in this “re-occupa-
tion” level differed significantly from that of the main destruction level both 
in fabric and profiles. Whereas the deep bowls from the main occupation level 
were made from a finely levigated clay, have fairly straight rims, and are paint-
ed with a variety of patterns in a semi-lustrous slip, the deep bowls from the 
“re-occupation” level are made in a somewhat coarse “oatmeal” fabric, have a 
pronounced flaring rim, a bell-shaped profile (no feet are preserved), and are 
covered inside and out with a lustrous black slip.48 Large, albeit fragmentary, 
neck-handled amphorae now appear with a distinctly hollowed interior rim 
painted with bands on the interior and exterior, bands on the body, and “whis-
kers” on the shoulders.49 Kraters, which previously occurred in an elegant piri-
form shape with an out-turned rim (Plates 22.7–22.8), now have a bell-shaped 
profile with a distinctly squared rim.50 These are painted with bands on the 
rim and body and a band on the interior.51 While Schilardi dated this pottery to 
Mycenaean iiic Middle “Advanced,” Mountjoy now dates it to Mycenaean iiic 
Late, based on parallels with the pottery from phases 2b and 3 at Lefkandi.52 
However, this pottery does indeed find good parallels at Mycenae in lh iiic 
Middle “Advanced.”53
It remains to consider the date of the building’s construction. To that end, 
a small sounding was cut through the floor of the second storeroom in 1984, 
down to bedrock. Although the sherds found in the floor’s packing were few in 
number and in poor condition, they preserved enough diagnostic ­fragments 
from deep bowls and painted goblets to conclude that the building was 
also constructed in lh iiic Middle “Developed.”54 Thus, it seems that the

­Koukounaries Hill building complex was built, inhabited, and destroyed dur-
ing one ceramic/chronological phase, lasting perhaps a quarter century.
One implication of this construction date is that it definitively removes the 
Koukounaries Hill from the list of “refugee” settlements, since it was founded 
at least two generations after the mainland destructions, when conditions in 
the Aegean appear to have been relatively stable.55 Indeed, there is nothing 
about the Koukounaries Hill building that suggests haste. Rather, as discussed 
earlier, it was built fully conceived, cognizant of the hill’s topography and sur-
rounding environment.
	
Material Culture, Memory, and Nostalgia
Perhaps what most immediately distinguishes the building on the Koukou-
naries Hill from the other contemporary Cycladic communities is its plan, 
which consists of a single building complex, rather than a community of 
­individual dwellings.56 As noted above, its plan is a variant of the so-called cor-
ridor house, a well-known type of Mycenaean domestic building that was com-
mon on the mainland during lh iiib, but apparently did not continue into 
lh iiic.57 Indeed, throughout the foregoing discussion, various aspects of the 
material remains discovered on the Koukounaries Hill have been compared 
with equivalent elements in Mycenaean culture. However, rather than finding 
their best parallels in the immediately preceding lh iiic Early period, they 
more closely resemble their counterparts from the palatial era of lh iiib, be-
fore the collapse at the end of the 13th century. These would include the build-
ing’s pseudo-Cyclopean southern façade, faux tower, and small shrine built 
inside the north entrance, which was compared to the “gate shrines” located 
just inside the entrances of Mycenaean citadels. As a “prestige artifact,” the 
southern façade may have created a formidable first impression, trumpeting 
the pretensions of the building’s inhabitants, who may have sought to identify 
themselves with a 13th-century architectural style that recalled and connoted

an earlier era of wealth and power, albeit executed here on a reduced scale.58 
To these architectural elements might also be added the seal stones and carved 
ivories discovered in the building, luxury crafts which, as noted above, are 
thought to have largely died out with the destruction of the mainland palatial 
centers.59
The resemblance of the material assemblage from the Koukounaries Hill to 
mainland Mycenaean iiib culture first became apparent to this author while 
studying the ceramics. Two artistic strains seemed to permeate the assemblag-
es: one conservative and one progressive. The unpainted vases, specifically ky-
likes, shallow angular bowls, and dippers, as well as the decorated group A and 
B deep bowls and linear painted jugs, appear to perpetuate the ceramic tradi-
tions of lh iiib; likewise the popularity of the whorl-shell motif (Plate 22.7).60 
Yet the frequency of shapes such as the collar necked jar and amphoriskos, and 
the widespread use of monochrome painting, seemed au courant with lh iiic 
Early and Middle “Developed” pottery. Indeed, the elaborately filled antithetic 
spirals on some vases seem to anticipate the “Close Style” of Mycenaean iiic 
Middle “Advanced” (Plate 22.8).61 While this phenomenon could be explained 
by the relative ages of the potters, with the elder ones working in the more 
conservative style, perhaps familiar from their youth, and the younger ones 
working in a more innovative manner, a different theoretical construct might 
better account for all the apparent cultural anachronisms observed here.
Recent archaeological scholarship has come to recognize the significant im-
pact that memory and nostalgia had on shaping ancient culture, especially in 
the Classical world.62 In this vein, I would propose that the elements in the

­material remains of the Koukounaries Hill settlement that seem inspired by 
13th-century Mycenaean palatial culture were indeed consciously meant to 
evoke that era. Living in a 13th century-style built environment, surrounded 
by 13th century-style objects, would not merely have reminded the inhabit-
ants of their cultural heritage, but would have reinforced their identity as 
“­Mycenaeans.” This desire to connect to an older, deeply rooted social, politi-
cal, economic, and cultural system could well have had great significance to 
a generation that may not have actually witnessed the violence and chaos of 
its collapse, but was probably born into the uncertain times of its aftermath. 
Thus, I would maintain that the apparent revival in the material culture of 
lh iiic Middle, as ­articulated recently by several scholars, was in large part 
stimulated by nostalgia for a more politically stable and economically prosper-
ous time.63 This view of lh iiic Middle culture—with its pervasive Zeitgeist 
of nostalgia for the palatial era—has recently been argued by Deger-Jalkotzy 
and Maran for the Argolid.64 I would suggest, furthermore, that the inhabitants 
of the Koukounaries Hill did more than merely emulate Mycenaean palatial 
­material culture. They may also have perpetuated or revived one of its most 
important social institutions, that of communal dining or feasting, as another 
way of ­asserting and reinforcing their identity as “Mycenaeans.”65 This activity 
may be inferred from the hundreds of kylikes and deep bowls found in equal 
numbers in the storerooms on the site, probably the standard Mycenaean 
Archaeologies of Memory; Jones, Memory and Material Culture; Boyer and Wertsch, Mem-
ory in Mind and Culture; Borić, Archaeology and Memory; Dignas and Smith, Historical and 
Religious Memory in the Ancient World. For the Classical world specifically, see Boardman,

drinking and eating vessels respectively, supplemented by the kraters, dippers, 
and jugs found with them.66
Nostalgia, however, does not occur in a vacuum, but depends on memories 
of the past time for which one is nostalgic. There are several possible agents 
for the transmission of memory: written sources, visual images, heirlooms, 
and speech or song. In the case of the Koukounaries Hill settlement, written 
sources are unlikely to have played such a role. None were discovered and none 
are known from lh iiic. Furthermore, extrapolating from the extant corpus 
of Linear B tablets, if any were preserved from the palatial era, it is unlikely 
that they would have contained any information other than inventories; more 
explicit historical or cultural information would be unprecedented. Likewise, 
visual imagery from the palatial era was probably not the source. Frescoes 
are the only form of large-scale art with figural depictions from the palatial 
era, and they too seem to have been devoid of historical narratives, or at least 
none can be identified with any specificity. Rather, Mycenaean frescoes largely 
repeat a stock set of iconographic themes: processions, battles, hunts, some 
rituals including communal dining and bull-leaping, and depictions of divini-
ties.67 Furthermore, after the destructions of the palaces, few are likely to have 
been visible by the lh iiic Middle period.
Nor were there heirlooms recognized among the objects recovered on the 
Koukounaries Hill, except perhaps the two seal stones, which have been at-
tributed to the “mainland popular group,” dated lh iiia:2–iiib.68 But even 
if these were heirlooms, it is difficult to imagine that a few portable objects 
could communicate enough memories to stimulate an era of nostalgia, unless 
the objects were emblematic of the 13th century, such as royal or aristocratic 
regalia.69 With that said, a beautifully carved ivory fragment, perhaps from the 
arm-rest of a chair, was found fallen from the building’s upper story.70 Having 
no parallels among extant Mycenaean ivories, it may best be regarded as an-
other object created out of nostalgia for a time when fine chairs embellished

with ivory appear to have figured among the accoutrements of the Mycenaean 
elite.71
But if this ivory fragment were not an heirloom, how might the memory and 
sufficient knowledge of such ivory chairs have been communicated to instill 
the desire to fabricate a new one, in emulation of a long-lost prototype? It is 
in this context that a sherd from the Koukounaries Hill building merits some 
scrutiny. The sherd comes from the body of a carinated goblet and depicts a 
single male figure whose head is outlined in profile view, perhaps with mouth 
opened (Plate 22.9).72 His torso is covered with a rectangular garment seen in 
frontal view, decorated with downward facing solid triangles at the shoulders 
and slightly thickened sides. The triangles may represent fabric brought for-
ward from the back and over the shoulders, like a peplos. Based on his hand po-
sitions, with the left arm raised above the shoulder and right arm bent across 
the torso with fingers spread, the figure may confidently be identified as a mu-
sician, specifically a lyre or phorminx player.73 While there are several ceramic 
parallels dating from lm iiib to lh iiic Middle “Advanced” that depict a figure 
playing a lyre or phorminx, the ultimate prototype could have been a fresco like 
the famous one from the megaron at Pylos, with its large-scale rendering of a 
phorminx player sitting on a rock.74
It is, of course, impossible to know the subject of the Koukounaries Hill lyre-
player’s song. However, it may be telling that the object on which he appears is 
a goblet, an object that may have been displayed and used on occasions involv-
ing communal drinking. One can easily imagine the kinds of songs that a lyre 
player would recite in such a social setting. Like a proto-Homer, he probably 
conveyed tales that evoked and glorified a heroic Mycenaean past and empha-
sized familial connections, thus simultaneously reinforcing the Mycenaean 
identity of the listeners and instilling in them hope for the future.75 By con-
trast, the musician on the Pylos fresco probably sang songs that glorified the 
present, focusing on the triumphs of the living king, whether the stories were

All one has to do is have a look at the consternation in the face of Princess 
Irene of Greece in an image from the The Illustrated London News when shown 
a giant North Syrian bronze protome in Olympia to understand why the early 
Iron Age Orientalizing style in Greece had to happen (Plate 23.1).1 Given the 
relative austerity, even meagerness, of contemporary home-grown Greek art 
of the early first millennium b.c., the showing was simply overwhelming—too 
grandiose, too new, too different to be resisted. Another such Near Eastern ex-
ample is the great Assyrian gate from Balawat in the British Museum, covered 
with seemingly infinite figuration.2 What exactly Greeks saw and where they 
saw it does not matter so much as the existence of these things, wherever they 
were, and contacts dense enough to bring the news to the outside world, by 
word of mouth perhaps, even more effectively than one can now realize. A 
faint reflection, as well, of the magnitude and nature of Near Eastern achieve-
ment is enshrined in the reliefs dedicated by Phoenicians in the Cave of Idaean 
Zeus on Crete, but partly also in imitation thereof, produced by indigenous 
Cretan workshops—a first sign of how the foreign model took root and, in its 
exotic appearance, how desirable it was.3
Oscar Muscarella, as young scholar, helped on the Eastern side in excavat-
ing, describing, dating, and attributing such material in his early days, which 
was the time when we first met and shared in some of these interests. Greeks, 
when it came to foreign reception, were strangely open to such ideas, sponge-
like absorbing. But art of their own they knew, for otherwise they would not 
even have been capable of imitating—and imitate they did—what others

offered. Here, I want to move away from Orientalizing and its hugely powerful 
manifestations and consequences. I want to look at the art before, which made 
all of this possible. I want to look at the very earliest manifestations of Classical 
art, and ask why it got under way. Orientalizing, as stated, built on an existing 
(intense) wish for art, and on expertise. But centuries earlier, and very nearly 
throughout all of the second millennium, the wish for what we know as Clas-
sical art did not exist.4 The Mycenaean idiom looks as though from another 
world, as if produced by an altogether different ethnic group, unrelated. The 
new—Classical—art happened, but how, to my knowledge, is unexplained. It 
is this question to which I want to draw attention.
What is the Classical idiom? I would name as one characteristic a most 
spectacular surfeit in decoration, in expense for “useless” investment in labor, 
in man-made embellishment. In that sense pointedly, the Parthenon, for in-
stance, has been criticized: “The works of Pericles served no economic purpose 
but that of display; they could not be realized in money or exported to other 
lands, or utilized for the production of more wealth. The skill and treasure 
devoted to them was permanently sunk; their construction afforded a means 
of employing the people; but when completed they provided no employ-
ment for industry and no incentive to trade.”5 The same may be said centuries 
­earlier of the tripods found at Olympia and elsewhere, which by size (height, 
­distance of basin from fire, and decoration) so very studiously disclaim being 
useful;6 or for that matter, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Geometric 
kraters—they too being monuments, with (if approached with a questioning 
mind) overwrought decoration.7 Geometric style, the initial phase of Classi-
cal art, has this hallmark from the beginning: primacy of form over function. 
­Especially in Athens usefulness, utility, takes second place behind ­advantages 
of an aesthetic nature, such as treatment of clay, shaping, surface finish, and 
ornament, all new, newly emphatically cultivated, and most obvious, of course, 
decoration. Modest, but really by no means modest; already the multiple con-
centric circles at the very beginning of Protogeometric, as the first step, were 
spectacular.8 The idea must have been taken from metal, where such accurate

work with the compass belongs. Precedents exist and are plentiful, if not pre-
dominantly in Greece, and were transferred to clay for no other reason than 
the desire for ostentation.9 I think the novum this is—and an absolute novum it 
represents—could not have been conceived without central European stimu-
lants and models, the stimulants more likely than not carried by immigrants. 
In central Europe at this time metalwork with this kind of decoration flour-
ished. It is hard to think of any other origin.10
However that may be, the overemphasis on decorative effect is Classical. 
There is a painstaking, loving quality to such works that deserves to be de-
scribed as gem-like. To understand this more clearly, we may think of later 
statuary such as the Lansdowne Amazon, a Roman marble copy of a Greek 
statue of the fifth century b.c. in the Metropolitan Museum (often visited, well 
known, and admired).11 As a work in bronze, which it once was, it positively 
radiated light. To anyone conjuring up the bronze original, the description as 
gem-like would be fitting. What captivates, or once captivated, was the lumi-
nous quality. And so I claim it is with all of Classical Greek art. But why—as in 
the case of the Parthenon, or in the case of, let us say, an unprepossessing Pro-
togeometric bowl—why go to such length in investment in expensive material 
(in the case of Parthenon and Parthenos for sure) and labor? Why overdecorate, 
to our eyes, thereby in commonsense terms “wasting”? One could just as soon 
ask: why, by virtue of its very existence, is Classical art so tied in with “waste”?
Is there anything like this earlier in the record, before the 11th century b.c. 
when Protogeometric begins, when pots—or perhaps one should say vases—
in Athens mark the change? In Mycenaean times there is art that is both func-
tional and for enjoyment, but there is no such insistence on “waste” (again, in 
practical, economic terms). There is no such cult-like relevance given to form or, 
in the “thick” sense, art. In Mycenaean ceramics, enjoyment through ­ornament 
undeniably plays a role, but this never surpasses function. In ­ceramics, treat-
ment in a somewhat offhand way, more as folk art than art, is manifest. But the 
pot, of whatever shape, is it.12 Utility dominates. No thinking of refinement as

the ultimate. No stepping back and admiring before the thought occurs: what 
does it hold? In Mycenaean times we see pots, not vases. Elsewhere in clay 
there is more license and display of fantasy, especially in the painting of sar-
cophagi or larnakes, or often very admirably in terracottas. But it’s more like 
folk art than art, bespeaking not visual culture but rather abundant willing-
ness to improvise—no rule to follow, explosion, tremendous eruption of tal-
ent, at best. No cerebral control that art, properly speaking, requires. Such are 
the most elementary, arguably even the most important beginnings of figural 
art on the Greek mainland.
In the palatial sphere, looking for instance at the Lion Gate of Mycenae, the 
conceit is so much of Crete’s making that one would barely think of the sculp-
ture as Greek, except for location and scale. The scale, though, was clearly not 
chosen to exhibit “beauty” but a threatening quality or brutal force. Whoever 
took pride in this monumental construction, perhaps based on hearsay from 
Asia Minor and knowledge of Hittite sites, meant message, not art. It was the 
artist who resuscitated the familiar imagery, the Cretan, long gone, yet still red-
olent of prestige. He did so brilliantly. But what we see is not Classical Greece, 
but Greece pre-Classical, earlier Greece at its rawest. The reliefs of the shaft 
grave stelai were equally message obsessed.13 The difference of course being 
that in the 16th century b.c. Crete had hardly as yet made an impression on 
the mainland. Of self-consciously artful embellishment, there is not a trace. 
Mycenaean overlords were indifferent—perhaps as “heroes,” men of action, 
even behaviorally ill-disposed to such indulgence (but more keenly sensitive 
perhaps to the art of oral praise). At some point there was a radical change. 
Sporadically, in new conditions, the “waste” factor showed, to which the Myce-
naean regime had been immune.
Two quotes by Moses Finley, authoritative and persuasive, throw light on my 
question. “The obvious difficulty with the city-state as a community, with its 
stress on mutual sharing of both burdens and benefits, was the hard fact that 
its members were unequal. The most troublesome inequality was not between 
town and country, not between classes, but simply between rich and poor”(my 
italics);14 and “The Greek liturgy was rooted in the age when the ­community 
was still ­inchoate, when the aristocratic households performed ­essential 
­public services, such as the construction of a temple, by expending ­labor and 
materials at their private disposal.”15 First, about liturgy: the later Attic tax on

“the rich” ­under democracy undoubtedly, as Finley claimed, had some kind of 
­antecedent. It meant the understanding that “the rich” in return for “honor” 
(power) would undertake defense and spearhead attack and such, and gener-
ally undertake what by way of display was prominent, expensive.16 Not from 
selflessness, of course, but well knowing that the majority, also armed, might 
rise up. Better to be proactive than reactive. Aristotle, in the fourth century, 
enthusiastically endorses munificence for “honor.” The “magnificent man” 
(megaloprepes) and the yet higher ranking “great-souled man” (megalopsy-
chos)—wealthy—­underwrite “votive offerings, public buildings, sacrifices” 
and generally events “arousing the interest of the wider public,” such as wed-
dings, and, one should think, funerals.17 A welcome duty, then, one imagines, 
to commission a krater such as in the Kerameikos in Athens in the eighth cen-
tury b.c., displayed by the dozens.18 And the proceedings illustrated on many 
of these giant vases, including the prothesis (display) and ekphora (transport-
ing) of the dead, were liturgy, not just in art but also in real life, calculated 
for entertainment, performance, celebration. There was a price to be paid for 
being privileged (and for safeguarding the right to exceptional possessions). As 
Finley said, long before formal liturgy evolved, “the rich” paid for “honor” and 
self-preservation. Art of high refinement was the result.
The conciliatory loss of means is not quite as far-fetched an idea as one 
might think. Envy means danger and, if shared by many, acute danger. As for 
this “tax” we may be reminded of potlatch: “a Nootka Indian word for ‘gift’ 
that describes a competitive gift exchange in which contenders for social rank 
organize elaborate feasts that include large distributions of possessions, and 
sometimes their destruction, in order to enhance the giver’s prestige.”19 Again, 
“waste,” destruction of wealth—with what in mind? “The rich” divest them-
selves of goods held dear, thereby signaling a curatorial role, as Marcel Mauss 
has put it, acting for the community “as the treasurers, as it were.”20 In Greece 
some such demonstration comes to mind when quantities of real wealth are 
surrendered and put on show, as with tripods. True, gods receive, but not only, 
and perhaps not primarily. As for “honor,” depending on one’s station in life,

and perhaps the degree of resistance expected and to be overcome, the price 
varied. Classical art for those of rank was not cheap.
Let us step back for a moment and see what had changed. Mycenaean king-
ship was followed by a “Dark Age,” a state of decline in every respect, of ano-
mie. Rebuilding authority of one kind or other, getting subjects to agree to live 
under some newly invented and accepted dispensation, was essential. Privi-
lege remained or resurfaced, though not as before, but rather circumscribed 
by nascent common law. The majority, many armed, was not voiceless and was 
ready for action. It was in this condition that the need arose for negotiating 
consensus, a need not existing under Mycenaean kingship, when a show of 
force was enough. This is why outside of citadels and palaces the circulation 
of wealth was sparse, as evidence shows. Feasting, now frequently discussed,21 
when seen in high places was about endorsing, not challenging, power. While 
feasting took place later as well, it was then more about equals meeting, ar-
guing rights. Most of the time the issue was social imbalance, overreaching 
on one side, protest on the other: both threatened violence. When Plato later 
calls self-centerdness the “greatest of evils” (megiston kakon) he indirectly al-
ludes to giving to fortify social cohesion.22 This was when leaders discovered 
the need to engage, not self-consciously but because of past failure and pres-
ent circumstances.
Classical art: a potlatch not conducted with perishable goods or shells, but 
real wealth, plus labor and invention, to magnify and stress sacrifice? But how 
was it possible in the first place for art to play this kind of viscerally embed-
ded, fundamentally conciliating role? What about the “feast” of art to which 
all were invited to share in a product of wealth? What about this Greek form 
of potlatch, exhibiting for unity’s sake the outstandingly, quintessentially non-
profitable man-made? How could this be so effective, leading to displays of 
technology and art that even today have scholars in awe?23 What about the 
mystique of Greek art—there is meaning to putting it that way—which unless 
supported by all could not possibly have developed as intensively and exten-
sively as it did?
Here one must venture into one particular area, ask one particular ques-
tion, namely what made Greek art for Greeks effective. I should think not form 
so much as luminosity is the key to understanding. It was materials treated to

shine—clay, stone, metal, or others, like ivory—that meant magical attrac-
tion. Metal was polished, therefore radiant.24 Marble, stone, was colored, but 
not even in the case of statuary was this done primarily to make the work ap-
pear “lifelike” in any materially imitative sense. Again, the idea was for color 
to radiate—glamour, or a gem-like quality. In the pediments of the temple 
of Aphaia on Aegina, for instance, the addition of gold and gilded elements 
impress (or once impressed) as color nonpareil, yet not in the sense of verisi-
militude.25 Recent exhibitions based on intensive investigations conducted in 
Munich based on the Aegina sculptures have greatly helped in re-energizing 
interest in polychromy.26
What light does for us, how important it is for us cognitively, and not only 
cognitively, is clear. I can only suspect, but it seems apparent, that Greeks in 
particular made much of light, to an unusual degree were light-responsive, and 
in art most prodigiously stressed the luminous. Subliminal agreement in art, it 
is apparent, depended on this quality.27 At the same time it must be said that it 
took the gift of the poet to bring the work to fruition. By poet I mean any kind 
of artist—simply “maker,” such as potter, sculptor, or metalsmith (as in Pla-
to’s Symposium, Diotima teaching Socrates28). The birth of the importance of 
luminousness for the Greeks harks back to their encounter with Crete, but that 
is beyond the scope of this discussion. Long-gone Crete had been absorbed 
in other ways, and in mental reach never died. When Greeks changed their 
repertoire in ceramics to Cretanizing shapes, luminosity was the reason. And 
something so much desired is apt to endure.

the older temple of Aphaia on Aegina, see Schwandtner, Porostempel, plate 4, figure 3. Ac-
cording to recent scholarly reconstructions, the ancients seem to have relied on a kind of

Among the many attempts to deal with the problem of social inequality, the 
Greek experiment with Classical art stands out, both for originality and nobil-
ity of effort. That the “upper crust” sacrificed in order to lead was exceptional 
enough. That in the process art of such high rank resulted made it outstanding. 
Some kind of enlightenment at the very end of the second millennium beat a 
trail in the direction of social peace. Poets—the term taken in the widest sense 
and in the meaning of “inventors”—were responsible for articulating an innate 
essence that helped significantly to unify minds, and has continued to do so. 
Art was not alone in forging consensus. It was not even very typically Greek, 
given how relatively few places and periods there are that are remembered 
for their arts. Speaking of Greek art we know we mostly mean Athens, and 
not much else besides; the record at our disposal is forbiddingly incomplete. 
In any case, what was most influential politically occurred in different ways, 
in debates and confrontations, always passionate, not infrequently physically 
violent. Art seen politically was a relatively minor event. Though as crowds did 
then, we enjoy the outcome.

What Did the Fisherman Catch?
Mark J. Rose
He is in a consumption. Who can cure this? He must perish, he must die.

∵
A small figurine published in Master Bronzes from the Classical World, the cata-
logue of an exhibition that traveled the United States in 1967–1968, illustrates 
the hazards of interpreting artifacts without an archaeological context. The 
difficulties are multiplied if such objects are studied within a narrowly circum-
scribed academic context or without full respect for the cultural context in 
which they were made and used.1
Acquired by the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg, in 1949, the 
bronze has no recorded context or findspot, but is said to be likely from Alex-
andria and to date to the middle of the third century b.c. (Plate 24.1). In Master 
Bronzes,2 Harvard art historian David G. Mitten characterizes the work:
[The] remorseless, almost repulsive realism with which the hunchback 
is endowed identifies him as a crippled beggar or fisherman who eked 
out bare subsistence on the street-corners and waterfronts of Hellenistic 
ports like Alexandria, the city which played a leading role in creating and 
maintaining genre subjects like these as a principal current in Hellenistic 
art.3
1	 Oscar White Muscarella’s approach to looting, artifacts without context, and fakes is as admi-
rable as it is uncompromising. The paper takes a second look at an unusual artifact, stripped 
of archaeological context and studied from a single academic perspective, releasing it from 
the old scholarly pigeonhole to which it had been relegated. Professor Anagnostis Agelarakis 
of Adelphi University read a draft of this paper, and I thank him for sharing generously his 
knowledge of palaeopathology and ancient Greek medicine, and the pitfalls of diagnosing 
disease from such artifacts. I claim ownership of any errors.

On the Hamburg museum’s website, the “grotesquely deformed beggar” is de-
scribed as a “rare masterpiece of this stylistic genre”:
In Alexandria, capital of Hellenistic Egypt under the Greeks, a new 
school of art developed, which depicted “realistic” subjects from every-
day life: women at market, fishermen, and beggars, who were portrayed 
as being repulsively ugly. This was for the amusement of the upper social 
classes, but was also intended to remind them of the transience of their 
own privileged position.4
The impoverished fisherman is a stock character, well known from classical 
authors, but is that what this figurine portrays? A beggar? Or something else 
completely? And was it really a trifle to amuse the elite, reminding them of the 
depths to which Fortune might plunge them?
Two bioanthropologists and a medical doctor, all authorities on tuberculo-
sis, see the figurine with very different eyes.5 The man’s face is fleshless, shoul-
ders thin and weakened, chest narrow with a keel-like breastbone, spine with 
an angular bend—all symptoms of a disease that is well recorded in Hippo-
cratic and other ancient medical texts. Far from an impoverished fisherman, 
they see in the bronze figurine a man dying of tuberculosis.
The diminutive figurine is just 2.64 inches (6.7 cm) in height. Its eyes and 
teeth inlaid with silver. The right arm and foot are broken off, left arm bent out 
of place, and right leg bent up toward the chest:
The body is emaciated, the back hunched grotesquely. He sits with legs 
crossed, holding the long phallus with his l. hand. His r. hand probably 
rested on the ground. The hunchback’s sparse hair is tied into a knot at 
the back of the head.6

Simply because such bronzes have been associated with Alexandria and that a 
beggar-fisher would fit our conception of that seaport city?
A number of dedicatory epigrams in the Greek Anthology reflect the plight 
of the impoverished fisherman, worn out and living on the margin:
Old Amyntichus, his toil on the deep over, bound his lead-weighted net 
round his fishing spear, and to Poseidon and the salt sea wave said, shed-
ding tears, “Know, Lord, that I am weary with toil, and now in my evil old 
age wasting Poverty, from whom there is no release, is in her youthful 
prime. Feed the old man while he yet breathes, but from the land as he 
wishes, you who are Lord over both land and sea.”7
and,
Priapus, who delights in the sea-worn rocks of this island near the coast, 
and in its rugged peak, to you does Paris the fisherman dedicate this hard-
shelled lobster which he overcame by his lucky rod. Its flesh he roasted 
and enjoyed munching with his half-decayed teeth, but this its shell he 
gave to you. Therefore give him no great gift, kind god, but enough catch 
from his nets to still his barking belly.8
Artifactual counterparts of the woebegone fishermen are found among small-
scale figures of bronze and terracotta. During the Hellenistic period,
sculptors were particularly interested in picturesque subjects and genre 
scenes where caricature and exaggerated realism sit side-by-side … the 
man in the street, old men, traveling salesmen, beggars, dwarves, hunch-
backs, and other deformed or sick people were highly prized by clients, 
and remained so during the Roman period …9
A well-known member of this cast, the fisherman is exemplified by A.J.B. Wace’s 
description of a terracotta figurine in his fundamental study, “Grotesques and 
the Evil Eye,” written more than a century ago:
the “Alexandrian grotesques,” of the sort Wace discussed a century ago. The image online is 
flopped relative to that in Master Bronzes. I have kept right and left designations from Hoff-
man’s catalogue entry.

… an itinerant fish hawker resting on a rock … clad only with a cloth 
about his loins; on his head he wears a wide-brimmed cap; and on his left 
wrist he carries his fish basket. The treatment of the face suggests disap-
pointment at ill success in selling his wares: this effect is heightened by 
his lean, miserable body. It is brutal, but effective.10
So, the poor fisherman character—present in ancient literature and the arti-
factual record, and established in scholarly tradition—is a conceivable iden-
tification for the Hamburg bronze, yet nothing about the figurine tells us that 
it is a fisherman. The man is emaciated but carries no telltale gear, let alone a 
fish. The identification is simply a case of an artifact without archaeological 
context being slotted into a venerable interpretational pigeonhole. This makes 
for a comfortable identification from one art historical point of view, but shuts 
out other interpretations of the object.
The past that we know is inevitably colored by our own experience and 
knowledge. In this regard, it is important to consider what tuberculosis means 
in its cultural setting today and what it meant in antiquity. If you are reading 
this, you are almost certainly well educated, well off, and live in a developed 
country. You probably have no personal experience of tuberculosis, except per-
haps childhood testing or vaccination. Indeed, your conceptions of tb are in 
all likelihood based on 19th-century–early 20th-century literary and operatic 
works populated by pathetically coughing, tragic characters. Marguerite Gauti-
er is the archetypical “Camille” in La Dame aux camélias (1848) of Alexandre 
Dumas fils. In Giuseppe Verdi’s La Traviata (1853), it is Violetta, and in Giacco-
mo Puccini’s La Bohème (performed first in 1896, but set in Paris around 1830), 
it is Mimi. Thomas Mann took up the consumptive torch in Der Zauberberg, 
which he began writing in 1912 and set in a sanatorium in Davos, Switzerland.
Tuberculosis, known in the 19th century as the White Plague, is grimmer 
in life and death than in books and librettos. The disease is caused by several 
closely related bacteria species in the genus Mycobacterium. Collectively they 
are termed the M. tuberculosis complex, but M. tuberculosis itself is usually the 
cause of tb in human beings. Today, around 2.3 billion people, one-third of 
the world’s population, are believed infected with tubercle bacilli. Of those, 
5–10 percent will become ill with an active case of the disease (for individuals 
with compromised immune systems the likelihood is much higher). Without 
proper treatment, up to two thirds of people ill with tb will die, and in 2010 
about 1.5 million people died from tuberculosis. With multiple and extensively

drug resistant (md/xdr) strains and virtually unrestricted world travel, tuber-
culosis is a resurgent global threat.11
The Hamburg “fisherman” was created in a world in which, in contrast to 
ours, everyone was familiar with tuberculosis and its consequences. The physi-
cian Aretaeus writes that even an idiotes, an average person, can recognize it 
when he sees a pale and worn out invalid who coughs.12 Descriptions of the 
disease and suggested treatments appear in the Hippocratic corpus and the 
writings of Celsus, Galen, Caelius Aurelianus, Pliny the Elder, and others.
Herodotus used the word phthísis—from the verb “to wither, diminish, be 
consumed”—in writing that the Persian general Pharnuches, who had started 
spitting blood, was left behind by Xerxes at Sardis in 481 b.c.13 It is not certain 
that Pharnuches had tuberculosis, but phthísis soon came to mean tb spe-
cifically.14 A Hippocratic text written a few decades after Herodotus gives for 
phthísis what amounts to a clinical description of pulmonary tb.15
… with a dull fever and chills; there is pain in the chest and back; from 
time to time, an overpowering coughing fit; lots of aqueous, salty spittle. 
… as it progresses, the body grows thin, all but the lower limbs, which 
swell up. Finger and toenails become curved; the shoulders become thin 
and weak; the throat is full of a kind of down and produces whistling 
sounds, as from a reed flute. For the duration of the disease, a terrible 
thirst, and total body weakness.16
A description written centuries later by Aretaeus details the wasting aspect of 
the disease:
Nose sharp, slender; cheeks prominent and red; eyes hollow, brilliant and 
glittering; swollen, pale, or livid in the countenance; the slender parts of 
the jaws rest on the teeth, as if smiling; otherwise of a cadaverous as-
pect. … one may not only count the ribs themselves, but also easily trace 
them to their terminations; for even the articulations at the vertebrae are 
quite visible; and their connections with the sternum are also manifest ….

Joints clearly developed, prominent, devoid of flesh … the spine of the 
vertebrae, formerly hollow, now protrudes, the muscles on either side be-
ing wasted; the whole shoulder-blades apparent like the wings of birds.17
Certain symptoms were taken as dire indicators of the disease’s course, and 
there are numerous helpful observations of these in the Hippocratic corpus 
and other texts:18
Consumptives whose hair falls out die from diarrhea; and all consump-
tives with diarrhea die.19
In persons affected with phthísis, if the sputa which they cough up have a 
heavy smell when poured upon coals, and if the hairs of the head fall off, 
the case will prove fatal.20
The 4th-century b.c. physician Mnesitheus believed that an individual’s food 
cravings reflected his fate, because “appetites follow the temperament, and the 
temperament follows diseases.”21 A craving for onions at the outset of tb indi-
cated eventual recovery, while that for figs portended death. Although it might 
progress differently, there was little doubt about the eventual outcome of the 
disease:
After a year, the patient succumbs wretchedly to the devastation. … death 
overtakes the victim usually after three years. … the disease lasts for nine 
years; after that time, though in a wasted state, one can last; but few es-
cape, it is so severe.22
For the people of the classical world, tb was an ever-present, devastating, and 
often fatal malady. Without their experience of this disease, we lack aware-
ness—except secondhand through the works of ancient authors—of the psy-
chological and cultural context in which the Hamburg bronze was created. To 
an extent, we can make up this deficiency.

What Did the Fisherman Catch?
Diagnosis of tuberculosis from iconographic evidence relies on the disease’s 
outward symptoms, those affecting the skeleton (hunchback and narrow pro-
jecting rib cage), together with an emaciated appearance.23 Pulmonary tb, 
which affects the lungs and lymph nodes, is the most common form of the 
disease, but in 5–7 percent of pre-antibiotic tb cases the infection involves 
the skeletal system. Involvement of the vertebrae is highest (43%), followed 
by the hip (20%) and knee (16%).24 Skeletal tuberculosis is known as Pott’s 
disease, after the British surgeon Percivall Pott, who described it in his 1799 
work Remarks on the Kind of Palsy of the Lower Limbs Which is Frequently Found 
to Accompany a Curvature of Spine. The spinal curvature referred to in this title 
typically results when the anterior portions of 2–4 adjacent lower thoracic or 
upper lumbar vertebrae erode and collapse, producing an angular hump (ky-
phosis). The sharpness of the bend sets it apart from that resulting from rickets 
and most other causes (Plates 24.2–24.3).
Physicians in the Hippocratic tradition linked pulmonary and skeletal 
tuberculosis:
Such persons as become hump-backed from asthma or cough before pu-
berty, die.25
[If the kyphosis is] above the diaphragm, the ribs do not usually expand 
properly in width, but forward, and the chest becomes sharp-pointed and 
not broad.26
The chief indicator, at least for prehistoric and ancient art, is presence of the 
sharp spinal bend or kyphosis.27 Other pathologies might produce a similar 
angular hump: compression fractures, congenital malformation, non-tb bac-
terial bone infection, and metastasized bone tumor.28 So Pott’s disease is only 
one possible interpretation for the condition of hunchbacks depicted in an-
tiquity. Similarly, an emaciated form does not by itself necessarily indicate tb. 
But an angular curve in the spine, along with a corresponding deformation of

the ribcage and chest, as well as general emaciation makes a spinal tuberculo-
sis diagnosis more convincing, as with the bronze figurine in Hamburg. Sup-
posedly a fisherman or beggar, the work more likely represents an individual 
with an advanced case of tuberculosis.
The Hamburg figurine is not unique. There are similar ones in bronze and 
ivory.29 One of those closest to it is a bronze in Berlin, which portrays an emaci-
ated hunchback sitting on a rock, his left knee drawn up, right knee down, and 
ankles crossed, with both hands up in front of his chest. (Plate 24.4)30 From 
a pathological perspective, it shares with its Hamburg colleague a near right-
angle bend, or kyphosis, of the spine and a narrow, projecting chest. According 
to the museum’s website, the figurine is a “beggar.” It has no provenience, but is 
said to be “Alexandrian-Hellenistic” and of the third century b.c.
Also close is an ivory example in the British Museum that portrays a crouch-
ing man with a prominent hunchback and one knee pulled up before his chest 
(Plate 24.5). According to the museum, it is the “sad and huddled figure of a 
slave” with “signs of dwarfism.”31 Yeames described it as follows:
… thin and remarkably pigeon-breasted. The collarbone also is promi-
nent. The head is sunk into the shoulders and leans over towards the left 
shoulder, which is noticeably lower than the right …. In every detail the 
artist shows an unsparing realism and the most minute observation of an 
abnormal subject.32
The figure, a “good representation of a person suffering from Pott’s disease,”33 
“is clearly intended to evoke a sympathetic reaction in the viewer.”34 As is the 
case with the Hamburg figurine, there is no indication of the Berlin or Brit-
ish Museum figures’ occupation; nothing marks them as fishermen. More than 
the Hamburg figurine, they show a loss of stature from vertebral collapse; the 
head lowered to the shoulders looks disproportionately large, especially with 
the narrowed ribcage and general emaciation. This overall bodily compactness 
is sometimes mistaken for dwarfism.

What Did the Fisherman Catch?
A seated bronze figurine in the Louvre shares the characteristic effects of 
skeletal tuberculosis with the one in Hamburg (Plate 24.6). “His limbs are long 
and slender, features emaciated, musculature knotty, ribcage hypertrophied, 
back incredibly hunched.”35 The man bends forward and over to extract a 
thorn from the sole of his foot. He is not a fisherman or beggar—he is another 
genre character, the thorn-puller or spinario. The type is said to be “inspired by 
picturesque works made in Alexandria during the Hellenistic period, which 
were widely imitated during the Roman period.”36
Additional seated hunchbacks have survived from antiquity. Another Lou-
vre bronze is of an individual with his legs bent down at the knees, as if in a 
sitting in a chair. It has the characteristic kyphosis, pigeon chest, and emaciated 
form.37 The figure wears a floppy cap, which is better seen on a British Museum 
bronze (see below). There are no attributes that suggest it is a fisherman. Also 
in the Louvre are terracotta examples of cross-legged, seated figurines with 
similar tb characteristics.38
To be included with other such figurines is a bronze hunchback in the Brit-
ish Museum.39 The emaciated individual exhibits prominent kyphosis, narrow 
rib cage, and pigeon chest. He appears, as photographed, to be standing awk-
wardly, but his posture and the crossing of his spindly legs at the knees sug-
gests he was meant to be sitting (his original perch is missing).40 He wears

A bronze figurine of an “exaggerated nude hunchback leaning forward, his emaciated 
body with the right leg crossing over the left, his genitalia swinging out behind” was sold 
in New York in 2009 (Christies, “Sale 2174/Lot 153”). It, too, could not have been standing 
or leaning, but nonetheless is shown posed like a sprinter in the starting blocks. Possibly 
the image of the British Museum hunchback B23 in Wace (ibid.) inspired it. The back-
ward oriented phallus compares with that on an Antioch mosaic (Plate 8), but that dwarf 
stands upright. Could the figurine sold by Christies, with no real context (“Austrian Pri-
vate Collector, acquired in 1992”), be based on a misinterpretation of two ancient proto-
types? Another awkward, unprovenienced bronze hunchback has the same angular spine 
and protruding chest as the 2009 one, but its head is not in alignment with the spine, at 
shoulder level or projecting forward, and its strangely puffy face seems lacking in detail 
(Symes, “Memorial Exhibition”). Should these two figurines be suspected as forgeries? 
Because they have no known archaeological context, this possibility cannot be ruled out. 
Neither figure can be said to depict an “exaggerated” hunchback when understood as a 
representation of a person suffering from tuberculosis.

a floppy cap, more clearly defined and better preserved than on the Louvre 
figurine (above). There is nothing to suggest that he is a fisherman.
There are also examples shown standing, such as a terracotta in the Muse-
um of Fine Arts, Boston. A man with marked hunchback and compact stature 
(mistakenly called a “dwarf”), he strides forward carrying a bunch of grapes. It 
is without provenience, called “Greek, East Greek,” dated to the late 3rd–2nd 
century b.c., and described as a “caricature with oversized head and brows, 
wide nose and mouth, and thin, small arms.” Although clearly modeled in-
dicators of skeletal tb appear to be noted (“spine and ribs are articulated”), 
tuberculosis is not mentioned in the museum’s description, even though the 
figurine “recalls terracottas from Smyrna that show renderings of disease and 
deformity.”41
Additional bronze figurines of individuals with skeletal tb characteristics 
who are standing or striding can be found in Toulouse42 and Vienna. Of those 
in Vienna, one is depicted walking, with a bundle over his left shoulder and his 
right arm at his side carrying another.43 A second is walking, too, but carries 
nothing.44 The latter is very close to the British Museum ivory and mfa grape-
bearer in its compact physique, caused by the collapsing of vertebrae. There is 
no evidence that any of these are intended to represent fishermen.
Rouse45 described a bronze figurine at Dumbarton Oaks as “a realistic figure 
of a patient in the last stage of consumption.” But although the seated man is 
emaciated, there is no deformation of the ribcage and no dramatic deforma-
tion of the spine. While the bronze could represent a pulmonary tb sufferer, 
there’s no way to tell. Richter asks, “May it then be that we have here a votive of-
fering by a sick man with a wasting illness and a club foot, which was dedicated 
in some sanctuary of Asklepios?”46
Could the Hamburg figurine be a votive, as Richter suggests for its counter-
part at Dumbarton Oaks? A votive or thank-offering rather than an artwork for 
the “amusement of the upper social classes”?

The figurine is emaciated, but shows no symptoms specific to skeletal tb. Richter 
(“Bronze Statuette,” 31–32) notes that the “two pairs of upper ribs are shown as grown 
together without indication of the sternum.” In fact, the sternum is completely absent. 
Was the artist copying a Hellenistic original but inattentive to its details, or unfamiliar 
with human anatomy? Neither explanation seems likely. The Dumbarton Oaks figurine is 
said to be from near Soissons, France, and was first published in 1844.

463
What Did the Fisherman Catch?
Like its companions, the Hamburg figurine has no archaeological context 
that might help answer these questions. Votives (and thank-offerings) are ma-
terial reflections of an individual’s piety and perceived need for divine inter-
cession, or of gratitude for receiving it,47 and tuberculosis would seem to be 
a disease that could produce such an expression. So, in lieu of archaeological 
proveniences for the Hamburg patient and his friends, some insight might be 
drawn from terracotta votives recovered in controlled excavations.
Many extant terracotta grotesques and genre figurines supposedly origi-
nated from Smyrna, where illicit digging in the 1880s caused a “sudden rash of 
terracottas” on the art market.48 Although spinal pathologies and emaciation 
are portrayed among these, their provenience—habitation deposit or votive 
dump—is too murky for them to be useful.49 At Corinth, thousands of figu-
rines and fragments were excavated at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, but 
only a few were found in graves, suggesting a votive function for most of these 
figures.50 Among them was a possible “humpbacked dwarf” that was perhaps 
dedicated there because “dwarfs” were connected with sexual potency or as-
sociated with Dionysos, who was also worshiped at the sanctuary.51
Excavation of the Asklepieion at Corinth produced terracotta models of 
body parts, which are also known from many other sites.52 There are no chests 
or spines that outwardly reflect the disease among those from Corinth, but a 
chest model of somebody suffering from pulmonary tb, the most common 
type, might not look abnormal. Anatomical terracottas tend to be uniform be-
cause they were mass-produced, but a few model hands show pathologies such 
as arthritic knuckles.53 Rouse notes dedications of models of afflictions (ul-
cers, for example), as well as an ear with the name of a disease written on it.54
The types and frequency of anatomical parts vary at the sanctuaries of dif-
ferent deities.55 At the Asklepieion in Athens, 40 percent of the dedications 
were eyes, followed in number by the trunk, legs, and hands. The offerings were 
quite different at Oropus near Thebes, site of the sanctuary of Amphiaraus, a 
hero of the Calydonian Boar hunt and the first Theban war. Rouse observes

that “If Asclepius was successful as an oculist, Amphiaraus seems to have been 
a specialist in lung complaints. At least his list contained dozens and dozens of 
breasts, all presented by men; one man gives sixty or seventy to the shrine.”56 
Other anatomical votives were found, but in small numbers only. Was Amphi-
araus perhaps of special help for people with tuberculosis or trying to avoid its 
grip?
Beyond figurines, we know of larger monuments related to tuberculosis. 
Two of these are connected to the healing god Asklepios. The lexicon Suda 
includes a fragment of Aelian recording that the god cured (or alleviated the 
symptoms of) the comic playwright Theopompus (late 5th–early 4th centuries 
b.c.) when “phthísis was reducing him to a skeleton.” Of the Athenians, Aelian 
says the following:
To this day they show a portrait of him in Parian marble, and the rep-
resentation of the case is perfectly clear; a bed, that too of marble, and 
upon it the patient portrayed with a real artist’s skill, the God standing by 
him and stretching out a healing hand.57
An inscription records another case, that of Thersandrus of Halieis, who went 
to Epidauros and slept in the temple of Asklepios in hope of a cure for his 
tuberculosis.58 Although the god did not appear to him in a dream, one of the 
sacred serpents from the temple stowed away in the wagon carrying him back 
to Halieis. At home, Thersandrus was resting on his bed when the serpent de-
scended from the wagon and cured him. Afterward, the citizens of Halieis con-
sulted the Delphic oracle, which advised them to keep the serpent and build a 
sanctuary to Asklepios.59
What was the purpose of grotesques and genre figures like the Hamburg 
one? Mitchell sees a number of possibilities:
… visual humour and caricature, comedy masks and theatrical figurines, 
and specific “portraits” of known pathologies. They may have been to

This ad hoc procedure parallels that for establishing other Asklepieia (Rouse, Greek Votive 
Offerings, 196). Pausanias (2.10.3) says Asklepios came to Sicyon from Epidauros as one of 
the sacred snakes, in a cart drawn by two mules. For Halieis, the snake took matters into 
its own hands and hitched a ride. Despite the improvisation, the result was the same: 
construction of a temple in a new location.

amuse, to avert evil, be a memento of comic plays, or even for medical 
study.60
Wace thought most were of insufficient quality to have been artworks or jewel-
ry: the “majority of them were, I believe, used as charms against the evil eye.”61 
In discussing the Louvre’s thorn-puller, Marie-Bénédicte says that pathological 
figures were probably endowed with protective virtues to safeguard their own-
er against deformities.62 They were good luck charms that could, like hunch-
backs according to popular belief, ward off the evil eye.
The “evil eye” is the ancient superstition that certain people can cause harm 
by their malevolent gaze.63 Fear of the evil eye is well documented in tradi-
tional circum-Mediterranean cultures.64 It was warded off with charms such 
as the hand with fingers outstretched; the corno, or horn; and the gobbo, or 
hunchback. Meeting a hunchback on New Year’s Day was considered lucky in 
Italy, and it was thought that touching the hump was luckier still.
Even today, people in countries with a high incidence of tb believe the dis-
ease can be caused by the evil eye. In a study of beliefs in rural India, 20 percent 
of subjects thought a supernatural agency, including the evil eye, caused tb.65 
A survey of suspected pulmonary tb patients in Ethiopia revealed that 50.4 
percent believed the evil eye caused the disease.66
The “bearer of evil eye … wilts crops that he looks upon, harms children, and 
sucks away the wealth and wellbeing of others.”67 For many in the past, the evil 
eye was a real danger:
Now, when men thus perverted by envy fix their eyes upon another, and 
these, being nearest to the soul, easily draw the venom from it, and send 
out as it were poisoned darts, it is no wonder, in my mind, if he that is 
looked upon is hurt.68

Concerning the Hamburg figurine, Hoffman wrote in Master Bronzes:
Such figures, combining the supposed apotropaic charm of Negroid race, 
hunched back, and phallus, were probably used as porte-bonheurs.70

noted the pairing of hunchback and large phallus in figurines.71 This connec-
tion is best illustrated by the 2nd-century a.d. mosaics from the vestibule of 
the House of the Evil Eye in Antioch.72 The Lucky Hunchback Mosaic shows 
a man who could have tuberculosis (his back is strongly curved and stature 
shortened), and he has prominent genitalia (Plate 24.7). He walks forward and 
looks back over his shoulder. The inscription “kai su” above him has been trans-
lated variously, colloquially as “right back at’cha.”73 The evil influence is turned 
back on the eye or its malicious owner before it entered the house. The Lucky 
Hunchback was later covered by the Evil Eye Mosaic, in which a trident, scor-
pion, snake, barking dog, centipede, leopard, and bird surround and menace 
an evil eye (Plate 24.8). A dwarf (not a hunchback)74 turns his back to the eye

Hoffman credits the Hamburg figurine with “the supposed apotropaic charm of Negroid 
race” (“Hunchback,” 119). Stevenson echoes this (“Pathological Grotesque Representa-
tions,” 220): “[the figure] represents an emaciated Negro with enlarged oblong head, pi-
geon breast, and collapsed spine.” This racial identification seems a stretch. Similarly, the 
British Museum ivory hunchback was described by Yeames (“An Ivory Statuette,” 279): 
“the ears are large, the nose aquiline, and great prominence is given to the bone struc-
ture above the eyes.” Eighty years later, Grmek (Diseases, 407, n. 89) says it “represents a 
man with Negroid features.” Mitchell (“Review of J. Clarke”) concludes that dwarfs (and 
tb victims with severely affected stature) were apotropaic, but “pygmies” not. The lucky 
hunchback and evil-averting phallus were the important, effective attributes.

Achondroplasia, a genetically caused shortening of limbs compared to the head and

or hormonal problem, is much less common (MedlinePlus, “Dwarfism”). The House of the

but adds his phallus to the assault on it.75 Both the hunchback and the later 
dwarf carry supposedly magical sticks, conceivably Egyptian in origin, to help 
drive evil away.76
The “Aesop” portrait bust found at the Baths of Caracalla is interesting in 
this regard. Literary sources suggest that Aesop was hunchbacked, but we 
simply don’t know if that is who the portrait represents. (Plate 24.9)77 Regard-
less, the individual exhibits skeletal pathologies characteristic of tb, and its 
hump was worn down in antiquity, presumably by people touching it for good 
luck.78 If “Aesop” was both a portrait bust and a source of good luck, what of 
the figurines? The Hamburg fisher-beggar combined the lucky hunchback and 
evil-averting phallus. As such, whatever its “amusement” value, the Hamburg 
figurine must have had a protective function—something of practical use in a 
world with the scourge tb.
The literary and archaeological evidence shows that some large-scale works 
and inscriptions commemorated tb cures. Others, depictions of individuals 
with tb-consistent deformations, were intended (or functioned secondarily) 
to avert evil or ensure good luck. As far as the evidence of terracottas and these 
larger pieces goes, they seem to have been votives or thank offerings, apotro-
paic or meant for good luck, rather than for amusement. This may also be true 
of the small bronze figurine in the Hamburg museum and its close relatives.
Fully understanding the Hamburg figurine and its fellows requires more 
than the detached view of modern statistics or ancient clinical accounts. We 
know of cases particular to individuals, people from all levels of society who 
suffered, were treated and comforted, died, and were mourned. These provide 
a personal context for the artifact.79
The wife of Polycrates, otherwise unnamed, is known to us only by a de-
scription of her struggle with the disease around 375–350 b.c.:
Evil Eye has both a potential tb case (the Lucky Hunchback himself) and a proportional 
dwarf (in the Evil Eye Mosaic). That both are provided with the oversize, apotropaic phal-
lus suggests that they were conceptually interchangeable, though a dwarf (regardless of 
cause) would lack the hunchback, which had its own specific good-luck function. Hunch-
backs, dwarfs, and pygmies are at times confused in the art historical literature (see, for 
example, Doeringer, “Dwarf Carrying a Vase,” 119, cat. 117).

Polycrates’s wife, in the summer, about the time of the dog-days, was tak-
en with a fever. Her difficulty of breathing was less in the morning, and 
greater after the middle of the day, and a little quicker. She coughed and 
hawked up, immediately from the first, as those do who have pus within 
them. … The seventieth day she was feverish, but very cold outwardly, 
without any beating in her temples; and her breathing was quicker. After 
the beating ceased, her breath was so quick that she was forced to keep 
sitting till she died.80
Pliny the Younger wrote in dismay to Priscus about the noblewoman Fannia, 
who is suffering from tb, and her impending fate:
The illness of my friend Fannia gives me great concern. She contracted it 
during her attendance on [her relative] Junia, one of the Vestal Virgins …. 
It was owing to her care in the execution of this charge that she contract-
ed her present dangerous disorder, which is a continual fever, attended 
with a cough that increases daily. She is extremely emaciated, and every 
part of her seems in a total decay except her spirits: those, indeed, she 
fully keeps up …. I am more than apprehensive upon her account; I am 
deeply afflicted. I grieve, my friend, that so excellent a woman is going to 
be removed from the eyes of the world, which will never, perhaps, again 
behold her equal. So pure she is, so pious, so wise and prudent, so brave 
and steadfast!
Pliny’s only hope is that a miracle occurs:
Such is the anxiety and sorrow under which I write this letter! But if some 
divine power should happily turn it into joy, I shall not complain of the 
alarms I now suffer.81
One can imagine that Polycrates and his family had also hoped for a miracle. 
So, too, the parents of the young child Lucius Minicius Anthimianus, whose 
3rd-century a.d. funerary inscription describes his fatal illness, generally taken 
to have been tb.82
It is not surprising that black humor was among the reactions to this preva-
lent and unstoppable disease. Plato ridiculed as futile the treatment developed

by the physical trainer Herodicus, who suffered from tb. Credited as the first 
to use exercise to counter disease and maintain health, Herodicus advised that 
people walk to Megara, and back, more than 20 miles each way.
[Herodicus blended] gymnastics and medicine, for the torment first and 
chiefly of himself and then of many successors.
How so?
By lingering out his death. For living in perpetual observance of his mala-
dy, which was incurable, he was not able to effect a cure, but lived through 
his days unfit for the business of life, suffering the tortures of the damned 
if he departed a whit from his fixed regimen, and struggling against death 
by reason of his science he won the prize of a doting old age.
A noble prize indeed for his science.83
Centuries later, Martial took a stab at a gold digger who was in pursuit of a 
fortune, banking on the nearly inevitable fatality of the disease:
Gemellus wants to marry Maronilla. He wishes, urges, begs, and gives 
gifts. So, is she beautiful? No, nothing’s uglier. Then what is desirable and 
attractive about her? She has a cough.84
Of course, physicians come in for jabs, as in this parody of a doctor’s appli-
cation of the rather aggressive Hippocratic treatment employed to straighten 
spines:
Socles, promising to set Diodorus’s crooked back straight, piled three 
solid stones, each four feet square, on the hunchback’s spine. He was 
crushed and died, but he has become straighter than a ruler.85
Whether or not Diodorus’s back was malformed because of tuberculosis or 
some other cause, the joke would have applied to tb cases.
The relationship between black humor and tuberculosis in the ancient world 
is significant. An emotional language, black humor is a coping ­mechanism for

life in harsh settings. It lowers stress and anxiety, and distances the individual 
from disturbing or traumatic experiences.86 Such humor, says Janoff,
cannot be described as being pessimistic or simply lacking an affirmative 
moral voice. Rather, it lives outside these limits in a terrain of terrifying 
candor concerning the most extreme situations.87
Given its function, the recurrence of black humor in texts related to tuber­
culosis written over many centuries attests the disease’s horrific toll in the 
­absence of effective treatment. The nervous laughter this humor provoked was 
therapeutic.
Was the Hamburg figurine made for the “amusement of the upper social 
classes” or to ward off a terrible affliction, or at least cope with it? Plutarch 
uses an example related to tb in his discussion of our fascination with things 
“artificially and ingeniously contrived,” saying that
to behold a consumptive man is no delightful spectacle; yet with pleasure 
we can view the pictures and statues of such persons, because the very 
imitating hath something in it very agreeable to the mind, which allures 
and captivates its faculties.88
What is critical is that the realism, not the disease, grips the attention. As far as 
tb is concerned, figurines showing the disease realistically may have expressed 
a kind of sculptural black humor, letting the viewer see the disease from a safe 
distance. But was this for the amusement of the wealthy?
No provenience of any sort is given in the catalogue entry for the Hamburg 
figurine.89 Fisherman or not, its specific provenience—grave, temple, residen-
tial, or other—is lost forever. Knowing it might have clarified the intent of its 
maker, owner, or donor. Was it a votive given in supplication or thank-offering, 
an apotropaic figure or bringer of good luck, an amusing knick-knack for some-
one with refined tastes, or a coping mechanism for a world with the scourge 
of tb? Conversely, interpretation of the Hamburg figurine as a dying victim of 
tuberculosis might have helped define the nature of the context in which it 
was found.

There remains the problem of the Hamburg figurine’s place of origin, its 
provenience writ large. Mitten links the figurine in a general way to Alexan-
dria, at least in terms of style.90 The museum’s website also associates genre 
figures, including this one, with Alexandria. But the website goes further, list-
ing the origin and date as “Alexandria, middle of the 3rd century b.c.,” as if 
the information were fully verified.91 There is, however, nothing more than the 
Alexandria-Hellenistic-genre association on which to base the claim.
The attribution of these figurines to Alexandria seems to be a common gen-
eral assumption (well nigh obligatory) for grotesques and genre figures. The 
ivory figurine in London, for example, has no known find spot, a fact made 
clear admirably and honestly in its description:
Made in Alexandria (perhaps)
Date: 1st C bc (perhaps)
Period/Culture: Ptolemaic (?)92
As weak as it is, the Alexandria link is made for such figures repeatedly. An as-
sociation of the bronze thorn-puller figurine in the Louvre with Alexandria is 
suggested, then qualified immediately:
Alexandria is considered the artistic center for these bronze grotesques 
…. the attribution of this statuette to a workshop in Lower Egypt is, how-
ever, hypothetical, because the fashion for these figurines extended over 
a large part of the Mediterranean. Several Greek cities in Asia Minor, no-
tably Smyrna, also produced deformed figures in bronze and terracotta.93
The Berlin figurine is called simply “Alexandrian-Hellenistic,” presumably indi-
cating influence rather than point of origin.94 These careful mentions of Alex-
andria, half-hearted and without commitment, recall remarks about the origin 
of the “so-called Alexandrian grotesques” that Wace made long ago:

Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe, Hamburg, “Statuette of a Hunchback Beggar.” Steven-

As regards the supposed Alexandrian origin of these grotesques, I think 
the onus probandi lies with those who assert it. A few such grotesques 
have certainly been found in Egypt, many have been found in Italy, and 
many others are unfortunately of unknown provenance. In all probability 
some of them came from Greece or Asia Minor. And since ­workmanship 
is in practically every case of the imperial period, the most natural as-
sumption is that such grotesques were popular all over the Graeco-­
Roman world. Those who defend their Alexandrian origin assert that 
they illustrate the strong realistic tendencies of Alexandrian art. But as 
works of art these bronzes are very inferior. They are mostly very coarse 
and rough in execution, and entirely lack all fine modeling.95
Admittedly, all four of the figurines considered here—the Hamburg “fisher-
man” and the bm ivory, Louvre thorn-puller, and Berlin beggar—are well ex-
ecuted, but their quality does not guarantee an Alexandrian origin.
If attempts to avert the disease failed, other measures to combat it had to 
be taken. There was no cure, but it was treated by a wide variety of means, the 
vast range of which perhaps conveys a sense of desperation. Any approach that 
could be tried was attempted. The alternative was to give up—and for some-
one who did, as Augustine says, “He must perish, he must die.”96
An unhealthful climate was implicated in tb and other diseases, so the 
architect Vitruvius recommended as more suitable “a mild, thick air, with-
out drafts and not constantly blowing back and forth,” which “builds up their 
frames by its unwavering steadiness, and so strengthens and restores those af-
fected by these diseases.”97 Since tb spreads most frequently through airborne 
transmission in enclosed spaces, this approach would have had some success. 
Cassiodorus extolled Mons Lactarius (Monte Lattaro) southeast of Naples—a 
Roman Zauberberg:
Our lord the King … when he reflected upon the impaired health of his 
servant Davus, ordered him to seek to the healing properties of the Mons 
Lactarius, for the cure which medical aid seemed powerless to bestow. A 
frequent cough resounded from his panting chest, his limbs were becom-
ing emaciated, and the food which he took seemed to have lost all power 
to nourish his frame. Persons in this state can neither feed nor endure to

fast, and their bodies seem like leaky casks, from which all strength must 
soon dribble away.98
Several authors recommended sending the afflicted to Egypt, and Herodo-
tus credited the Egyptians’ good health—second, he said, only to that of the 
­Libyans—to the “absence of changes in the climate; for change, and especially 
change of weather, is the prime cause of disease.”99 Celsus was one who advo-
cated Egypt:
If the strength allows of it a long sea voyage is requisite with a change 
of air, of such a kind that a denser climate should be sought than that 
which the patient quits; hence the most suitable is the voyage to Alexan-
dria from Italy.100
We know the results of one such voyage from a letter by Pliny the Younger:
For some years ago [Pliny’s freedman Zosimus] strained himself so much 
by too vehement an exertion of his voice, that he spit blood, upon which 
account I sent him into Egypt; from whence, after a long absence, he 
lately returned with great benefit to his health. But having again exerted 
his voice for several days together beyond his strength, he was reminded 
of his former malady by a slight return of his cough, and a spitting of 
blood.101
We do not have Zosimus’s own testimony, but millennia later consumptives 
still traveled to Egypt. Lady Lucie Duff Gordon voyaged to Egypt in 1862, 
98

See Herodotus (2.77.3) on Egyptian health generally. There are just two possible tb cases 
in the Egyptian medical texts (Bedeir, “Tuberculosis in Ancient Egypt,” 10). There is, by 
contrast, a surprising amount of bioanthropological and artistic evidence for the disease, 
from the elite to servants, and from the Predynastic to the Roman period (Nunn, Ancient 
Egyptian Medicine; Buikstra, et al., “What Diseases Plagued the Ancient Egyptians?”; 
Filer, Diseases; Smith and Dawson, Egyptian Mummies; Bedeir “Tuberculosis in Ancient 
Egypt”). dna recovery from Egyptian mummies has been questioned (Marchant, “Curse 
of the Pharaoh’s dna”), but recent studies have diagnosed tb on multiple lines of evi-
dence. With the 26th-Dynasty mummy of Lady Irtyersenu, Donoghue, et al. (“Dr. Gran-
ville’s Mummy”) found M. tuberculosis complex dna in lung tissue and the gall bladder, 
and tuberculosis-specific cell wall mycolic acids in lung tissue and the femurs. Results of 
a 1994 histological study of the mummy are consistent with tb.

­seeking relief from tb. Her letters, written during the seven years before she 
succumbed to the disease, are a brilliant account of life among the people of 
Luxor. In one of the first, sent while she was still in Cairo, she wrote to her 
mother in England:
I have now been enjoying this most delightful way of life for ten days 
and am certainly much better. I begin to eat and sleep again, and cough 
less.102
Lady Gordon’s returning appetite points to another method of treating tb. 
Aretaeus, and others, praised milk as both treatment and sustenance, as it
is pleasant to take, is easy to drink, gives solid nourishment … as a medi-
cine it seems to lubricate the windpipe, to clean, as if with a feather, the 
bronchi, and to bring off phlegm, improve the breathing, and facilitate 
the discharges downwards.103
Cassiodorus is a strong proponent of a milk diet, but not just any milk. He rec-
ommends that of Mons Lactarius, for which he claims near miraculous proper-
ties in countering the wasting aspect of tuberculosis:
As an antidote to this cruel malady Heaven has given us the Mons Lactar-
ius, where the salubrious air working together with the fatness of the soil 
has produced an herbage of extraordinary sweetness. The cows which 
are fed on this herbage give a milk which seems to be the only remedy 
for consumptive patients who have been quite given over by their physi-
cians. As sleep refreshes the weary limbs of toil, so does this milk fill up 
the wasted limbs and restore the vanished strength.104
Celsus provides a detailed guide to diet in treating tuberculosis patients:
The food should at first be acrid, such as garlic and leeks, also this latter 
or endive, basil, or lettuce after soaking in vinegar; later the food should 
be bland, such as a gruel made with pearl barley, or spelt flour, or starch 
to which milk is added. Rice also, and if there is nothing else, parched 
groats of spelt answer. Subsequently use is to be made of the above foods

in turn, with some additions from food of the middle class, especially 
grilled brains, small fish, and such like.105
Claims were made for the efficacy of many unusual foodstuffs, such as pine 
pitch, often crossing the border from food to medicine. Those in an extensive 
list compiled by Pliny the Elder for the “cure of phthísis” included the following:
… a wolf’s liver boiled in thin wine; the bacon of a sow that has been fed 
upon herbs; or the flesh of a she-ass, eaten with the broth …. They say 
too, that the smoke of dried cow-dung … is remarkably good for phthísis, 
inhaled through a reed.106
Pliny said that ingesting stone, probably a reddish volcanic cinder conglomer-
ate, from Assos in northwestern Anatolia, was a remedy for phthísis.107 This 
practice recalls Lady Gordon’s experience in Egypt. In a November 1862 letter 
to her mother, she describes visiting a mosque in Cairo:
The Kibleh was very beautiful, and as I was admiring it Omar pulled a 
lemon out of his breast and smeared it on the porphyry pillar on one side 
of the arch, and then entreated me to lick it. It cures all diseases.108
Was Omar following an ancient treatment for consumption?
Pliny had other treatments: taking saliva from a horse three consecutive days 
and inhaling the smoke from burning a hare’s fur. But even he had his limits: 
“as to bull’s blood, it would be rash to believe in any such recommendation.”109 
Galen offered a miracle cure, “We have often seen consumptives given up by 
all their doctors restored to health by vinegar of squills” (a type of bulb).110 
Plutarch questions another traditional treatment:
What certain reason can be given for that custom amongst us, of order-
ing the children of parents that die of a consumption or a dropsy to sit

with both their feet soaking in the water till the dead body be burnt? 
For people believe that thereby the disease is prevented from becoming 
hereditary, and also that it is a charm to secure those children from it as 
long as they live.111
In addition to climate, diet, and medicinal foods, tb was fought through prac-
tice of a careful physical regimen. That of Herodicus, which perhaps was over-
kill, has been mentioned already. The Hippocratic corpus advocated ­moderate 
walking and, after the symptoms were brought under control, avoidance of 
running in the wind, horseback riding, shouting, and angry outbursts, all of 
which might trigger a relapse. Others prescribed rest, “warming” drugs, woolen 
wrappings, grease applied to the chest and shoulders, light activities such as 
reading aloud, breathing exercises, rocking the body gently, and a sea voyage.112
Supernatural aid was also sought, with the god Asklepios being credited 
specifically for the recoveries of Thersandrus and Theopompus. Pliny the 
Younger’s plea for intervention on behalf of his friend Fannia was more of a 
broadcast appeal to “some divine power.” Any deity or power would do. Aelian 
records that, Chrysermus, in the reign of Nero, was “cured of spitting blood 
and wasting away, by drinking, at command of the god Serapis, the blood of a 
bull.”113 It is possible that Hadrian died from tb after finding only temporary 
relief through magic rites.114
What did this “crippled beggar or fisherman” catch? Tuberculosis. Huddling, 
one knee drawn up to his chest, he has been brutally transformed by the dis-
ease. Along with the figurine in Hamburg, one could group the bronze Berlin 
“beggar” and the ivory British Museum “slave” with “signs of dwarfism.”115 All 
three share striking evidence of skeletal tuberculosis, something they have in

populations, and supposed personality traits. This discounts the mention of “consump-
tion” in Dio Cassius by using the word in its earlier sense of “wasting away.” Yet in the 
Hippocratic work De affectionibus interiorbus, and other ancient sources, the term clearly 
denotes pulmonary tb. Hadrian, fed up with the long illness, died after quitting a dietary 
regimen and indulging in unhealthful eating.

common with other figurines, shown sitting up, standing, or walking. Some 
carry things, bundles or grapes. One co-opts a well-known type, the thorn-
puller or spinario. But tb links them all. Exactly none of them can be said to be 
fishermen (Wace shows a seated terracotta figurine that’s more convincing as 
a fisherman; at least he holds a basket).116
The Hamburg unfortunate, like his fellow tb sufferers, has no recorded pro-
venience. “These grotesque figurines often lack an archaeological context,” la-
ments Mitchell, making their interpretation “a little like diagnosing a patient 
over the telephone.”117 Excavation might have told us more about where and 
how the figurine was used, and what its function and meaning were.
We can look at the contexts of excavated terracottas and large-scale works 
(the “Aesop” bust from Rome and the Lucky Hunchback Mosaic from Antioch) 
and some known from ancient texts (the Thersandrus inscription and the 
Theopompus sculpture). Most of these have a context in, or are linked to, a 
sanctuary and seem to have been votives or thank-offerings. The Lucky Hunch-
back, at a doorway into a house, would have averted the evil eye. The “Aesop” 
bust, a portrait produced for public display, was used by passers-by to obtain 
good luck.118 Perhaps the Hamburg figurine is from a sanctuary or a setting in 
which its dual apotropaic and good-luck aspects would have been in use.
But artifacts can be decontextualized in ways other than by loss of pro-
venience. Internally, past scholarship has influenced interpretation in every 
discipline. In terms of ancient objects, tradition has established expectations 
for how we should look at things and what we should see. Salapata pinpoints 
one way that this affects small votives, noting that they are “usually published 
in catalogues focusing on individual items rather than assemblages. They are 
studied mainly as artistic products or for their significance for dating, but rare-
ly as parts of their assemblages and find contexts.”119 Externally, segregation of 
knowledge by academic field leads to tunnel vision.
An artifact with no provenience, isolated from its original cultural context, 
acquires meaning through its study by scholars and the collective interpre-
tational framework imposed by the discipline. This academic context, the 
scholar and tradition, creates a surrogate cultural context for the artifact. In 
her influential work The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age, Bieber wrote of “the 
sordid side of life in the large cities … best represented in Alexandria.”120 So, 
grotesques are said to be from Alexandria: such figures show impoverished

­individuals; ­beggars and fishermen were impoverished; both were likely deni-
zens of a sordid harbor city like Alexandria. Given this scholarly context, it is 
no wonder that the Hamburg figurine was pigeonholed as a grotesque fisher-
man or beggar.
Having a familiar scholarly bin into which an artifact can be dropped rein-
forces the legitimacy of both the bin and the discipline’s traditional interpreta-
tional framework. (Pigeonholing is especially convenient with artifacts lacking 
a provenience.) This discourages the seeking of additional insights, especially 
those involving other fields. In this way, the obvious symptoms of tuberculosis 
displayed by the Hamburg patient were not recognized, and none of what fol-
lows from the tb identification was explored.
The figurine is a memento of a different world, one in which tb was part 
of daily life, an ever-present, not terribly decorous, and often fatal malady. Lit-
erary sources give us some idea of that world, on both cultural and personal 
levels. Travel, diet, training, magic, religion, medicine—the inhabitants of this 
world tried everything. If there were no aid from on high, then hope was in 
short supply. Figurines, to ward off evil or ask for or acknowledge divine aid, 
were of immediate, life-or-death importance. Perhaps those chewing boiled 
wolf’s liver, drinking horse saliva, and smoking dried cow dung thought back 
and wished they had bought a figurine to ward off evil or supplicate a god. If 
they were lucky and the disease receded for a time, a thank offering would be 
in order.
Looking at artifacts, especially those with no provenience, requires multiple 
approaches. A single academic perspective won’t lead too far, and will probably 
lead in the wrong direction anyway. That is what happened to the Hamburg pa-
tient. A fresh look, using observations from several fields, is more helpful. That 
is the intent of this paper, at least. Wace, in his study of grotesque figurines 
and the evil eye, saw the need to take a larger view and bridge academic fields:
In conclusion I may be allowed to express the hope that this brief and 
imperfect paper will call some attention to the belief in the evil eye in 
antiquity, and to the monuments illustrating that belief; and also to the 
fact that in such questions as these Anthropology is of great assistance to 
Archaeology.121
More than a century later, his observation holds true.
A beggar or a fisherman made to amuse the wealthy? No. A representation 
of a man dying of tuberculosis created to avert the evil eye and the affliction it 
might bring, or as a plea for, or acknowledgment of, divine aid in the face of it.

The Weight of Good Measure: A Reassessment of 
the Balance Weights from the Late Bronze Age 
Shipwreck at Uluburun
Rachael Dealy Salisbury
The Uluburun shipwreck, located 60 meters off the southern coast of Turkey, 
has provided some of the most significant archaeological evidence related 
to Late Bronze Age maritime trade ever discovered at a closed-context site

The Weight of Good Measure
Texas A&M University excavated the wreckage between 1984 and 1994, a feat 
that required the skillful navigation of a sloping deepwater landscape.1 The 15- 
to 16-meter-long ship set sail at the end of the 14th century b.c.e. and subse-
quently sank intact to depths ranging from 42 to 61 meters, where it remained 
undisturbed for over three millennia.2 Although conditions at the site limited 
archaeologists to two 20-minute dives per day, they nevertheless recovered 
from the wreckage an impressive quantity of artifacts and raw materials, in-
cluding ten tons of Cypriot copper, nearly one ton of tin, rarely seen glass in-
gots, logs of ebony (Dalbergia melanoxylon), elephant tusks and hippopotamus 
teeth, ostrich eggshells, murex opercula, terebinth resin, valuable foodstuffs, 
Cypriot, Canaanite and Mycenaean pottery, thousands of glass and faience 
beads, jewelry and cult objects, and 530 grams of gold.3
State sponsorship, perhaps from one of the “Great Powers,”4 would have 
been likely for any trade venture of this magnitude, due to the high-risk stakes 
of ancient seafaring, the amount of capital needed to secure and insure trade 
goods, and the organization required to cultivate and protect a capable and 
trustworthy crew.5 Nonetheless the ship’s commissioner(s) and home port re-
main unknown.6 It has been suggested that the ship originated in Tell Abu Ha-
wam, a port city associated with inland Megiddo, and that the ship’s cargo may 
have been slated for distribution from a palatial center in mainland Greece, 
possibly Mycenae via the port of Tiryns to the south. Regardless of the ship’s 
origin and final port of call, it is likely that its course followed a standard route

that moved around the Mediterranean basin in a counterclockwise direction, 
hugging the coastline.7
Among the many important finds were 149 stone and metal balance weights, 
mainly of sphendonoid (oblong, with rounded or pointed ends) and domed 
(cylindrical, with flat bottoms and rounded or flat tops) types, which had 
clearly been used by the merchants on board the ship. Cemal Pulak, who has 
studied the collection extensively, produced a masterly analysis of the Ulubu-
run and Cape Gelidonya weights in 1996. Pulak found what appear to be three 
main weight (mass) standards present in the Uluburun assemblage, along with 
a possible fourth. Weights representing a specific standard may also include 
fractions and multiples of the “standard unit mass.” The predominant standard 
unit mass at Uluburun was found to be ca. 9.3–9.4 g, most likely corresponding 
to the Late Bronze Age Syrian shekel, a standard based on the Egyptian qedet 
that was used along the Syro-Palestinian coast and on Cyprus. Two other stan­
dards are apparently represented: a standard unit mass of ca. 7.4 g, close to 
that of the Syro-Canaanite peyem, and a standard unit mass of ca. 8.3 g, which 
probably corresponds to the Mesopotamian or Babylonian shekel. There may 
also be an additional standard unit mass of ca. 10.5 g, corresponding to the 
Syrian necef.8
Pulak grouped the Uluburun weights into sets based on weight standard and 
morphological type, with 85 stone examples forming the basis for his study of 
weight denominations. The other weights were set aside, considered over- or 
underweight due to damage or corrosion; this included a group of 19 bronze 
zoomorphic weights, regarded as a special set belonging to a single (possibly 
head or senior) merchant (Plate 25.1).9 Based on his groupings (discussed be-
low), Pulak suggested that three or four merchants were on board the ship,

termining the weight standards present on board the ship as well as a catalogue in which

weight, and extent of preservation. Pulak, “Analysis of the Weight Assemblages,” 149ff.; Pulak, 
“The Balance Weights,” 258–262. Of the 149 weights recovered, 78 were made of hematite or 
other iron-bearing minerals, 25 were diorite, steatite, or limestone, 38 were bronze, and 8 
were lead. Pulak, “The Uluburun Shipwreck and Late Bronze Age Trade,” 369–370. I am grate-
ful to Cemal Pulak for his willingness to read my manuscript prior to this article’s publication.

each carrying a pair of weight sets. However, Pulak’s sets do not correspond 
exactly to the distribution of the weights as found on the ocean floor. While a 
weight’s location among the wreckage cannot be taken as conclusive evidence 
for its position on board the vessel, a closer look at the weights’ find spots may 
nevertheless yield important information about the way the weights were used 
by the Late Bronze Age traders associated with the ship (Plate 25.2). The as-
tounding amount of work done by the Uluburun excavation team to record the 
exact locations of finds and the topography of the seabed, along with extensive 
information published by Pulak and others since 1996, has afforded a compre-
hensive picture of the shipwreck. A new look at the site suggests the possibil-
ity that the weights can be reconfigured into four international sets that each 
contain geometric and zoomorphic weights of several standards.
	
Pulak’s Proposed Weight Sets
Pulak recommends that the Uluburun weights be grouped according to weight 
standard and shape, based on the likelihood that individual pieces in sets of 
similarly shaped weights would be easily distinguishable among an assemblage 
of unmarked weights. Further, his cluster analysis of the masses of those well-
preserved weights, which were tested against a mean standard unit of mass, 
allowed him to group the weights into sets of more than one standard.10 Due to 
some variation, not all weights from the shipwreck fit neatly within one or an-
other particular standard. Nonetheless, Pulak suggests that the domed Syrian 
shekel weights comprise three separate, virtually complete sets of the following 
denominations: ½, ⅔, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100. These heavier weights, he 
posits, might have been used for the weighing of bulk goods. Among the lighter 
sphendonoid Syrian shekel weights, Pulak finds four separate sets with units of 
½, ⅔, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10, which might have been used for the precision weighing 
of precious materials, such as gold, silver, or spices.11 Pulak proposes that there 
are two sphendonoid “precision” sets in two weight standards (one of each); 
one “precision” set corresponds to the Syro-Canaanite peyem, and the other to 
the Mesopotamian shekel. Although 23 specimens might conform to the necef 
standard, Pulak believes that there are too few weights of this standard to com-
prise a complete set;12 it is curious that most of these specimens represent one

standard unit. Finally, Pulak’s set of 19 zoomorphic weights cannot be assigned 
to any weight standard with certainty, due to loss of mass through metal leach-
ing. The zoomorphic weights were cast in bronze using the lost-wax method; 
eight of these weights have lead cores. The group includes two frogs, four bulls, 
two calves, two lions, one sphinx, one fly, three waterfowl, and a possible dog’s 
head. One unparalleled weight features a bucolic scene with small, sculpted 
figures on a cylindrical base, depicting a herdsman and two recumbent calves 
(a third animal is missing).13 Visible signs of wear indicate that the zoomorphic 
weights had been used.14
Pulak concludes that three to four merchants must have been on board the 
ship, if it is assumed that all merchants possessed one set each of the domed 
and sphendonoid Syrian shekel weights.15 Several issues arise out of this inter-
pretation. Primarily, it is suggested that the weights’ storage spots on board the 
vessel have been irrevocably disrupted. However, Pulak explains that the Ulu-
burun merchants doubtless kept track of unmarked weights by storing their 
weight sets in pouches.16 If the Uluburun merchants did store their weight sets 
in pouches, would not the pouches—rather than the weights—have been dis-
placed during the ship’s sinking and collapse, ultimately leaving behind small 
clusters of weights that once belonged to individual sets? This possibility is ac-
knowledged by Pulak, although considered to be unlikely.17 It is this idea, first 
broached by Pulak, that I wish to explore further in this paper.
The convention of storing weights in pouches18 is bolstered by textual evi-
dence, such as the following verses from the Babylonian “Hymn to the Sun-
God (Shamash).”19

To the seafarer who fears the waters thou dost give [courage].

He who invests money at an exorbitant rate of reckoning—what does he

He will make himself lie for the profit and then lose (his) bag of weights

Although slightly earlier in date, a leather bag and a wooden box (perhaps used 
to store weights and balances?) that were found at Fara,23 the site of ancient 
Shuruppak, were each sealed with Sumerian clay sealings denoting an official 
who “had some involvement in the movement of sealed goods.”24
Indeed, a merchant’s livelihood depended upon his ability to maintain 
accurate weights, probably of several standards, and to use them justly. The 
scrutiny that Late Bronze Age weighing specialists were expected to practice 
is reflected in hymns, prayers, and hieratic texts. For example, the 16th chapter 
of “The Instruction of Amen-Em-Opet,” an Egyptian text that dates to the first 
half of the first millennium b.c.e.,25 commands the following:
Do not lean on the scales nor falsify the weights,
Nor damage the fractions of the measure. (xvii 20)
Do not wish for a (common) country measure,
And neglect those of the treasury.

And his heart is the plummet. (xviii 1)
Which god is as great as Thoth,
He that discovered these things, to make them?
Make not for thyself weights which are deficient;
They abound in grief through the will of god.26
A declaration of honest weighing comes from the Egyptian “Protestation of 
Guiltlessness,” found in the 125th chapter of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, 
whose texts run from the 18th to the 21st Dynasties, translated here by Maystre:
(A25) I have not added to the weight of the balance.
(A26) I have not weakened the plummet of the scales.27
Forbidding words are found in the previously mentioned “Hymn to the Sun-
God” from Babylon:
He who manipulates the calculating of an account—his foundation will 
be changed (ii: 40).28
He who handles the scales in falsehood,
He who deliberately changes the stone weights (and) lowers [their 
weight,]
Will make himself lie for the profit and then lose [his bag of weights]

And from the Old Testament:
You shall not falsify measures of length, weight, or capacity.
You shall have honest balance, honest weights, an honest ephah, and an 
honest hin.30

This rich array of literary sources illustrates the strong connection between 
weighing and Late Bronze Age economic, political, and religious ideologies. 
Other insights into the act of weighing can be drawn from Egyptian wall 
paintings, which reveal that the weighing of goods often required at least two

­persons: a specialist who maneuvered the weights and balances, and a scribe 
who was trusted to record the official results.31 Indeed, the weighing of goods 
was a highly regulated activity, involving multiple officials and the oversight 
of the gods; thus, it was in a merchant’s best interest to take proper care of 
his weights. A seafaring merchant, in particular, might have been especially 
devoted to securing his weight sets while sailing over the bounding main. One 
wonders, then, whether the zoomorphic weights, which were scattered over an 
area of roughly 6 m × 9 m, comprise a single set.
Drawings of the Uluburun weights are included in Pulak’s beautifully illus-
trated catalogue, although he does not specify which individual weights make 
up each of his proposed sets—which are grouped according to weight standard 
and shape.32 One wonders whether there might be an alternative. It seems 
possible that an itinerant merchant may have conceived of a set of weights in 
terms of all the weight standards needed to facilitate international trade. Such 
an international set would doubtless include weight standards from several 
Near Eastern regions and might consist of weights made from various materi-
als in multiple forms. A look at the distribution of the weights as found on the 
sea floor suggests that this could have been the case.
	
A New Look at the Distribution of Weights at Uluburun
Over time, the ship and its contents spread across a 13 m × 28 m area with 
an average slope of 30 degrees. The ship’s stern was positioned at the top of 
the slope and its hull settled with a 15-degree starboard lean. Archaeologists 
charted the rocky and uneven site using a grid system consisting of one-meter 
squares, which were labeled alphanumerically beginning at the top of slope. 
Each grid square was further subdivided into 16 25-centimeter squares, and 
artifact locations were recorded in these squares to within a two-centimeter 
margin of error. All of the balance weights were found in an area measuring 
approximately 7 m × 11 m (J–P/10–20), with the exception of W 112, which was 
recovered from area F21.33 Excluding this weight, the distribution of balance 
weights is illustrated in Plate 25.3.34

The Uluburun site can be divided into nine distinct areas (Plate 25.3), based 
both on prominent physical features of the shipwreck, as described by Pulak, 
and on the clusters of weights that were found. The stern of the ship came to 
rest at the top of the slope, in an area that Pulak describes as a ledge flanked 
by two sand gullies (O–Q/10–13 and I–K/9–13). Further downslope, four rows 
of copper ingots and a row of stone anchors, all of which are visible in area 
L–P/13–14, formed a barrier that prevented artifacts from traveling far. This up-
per area, referred to here as Area 1 (L–N/10–13), yielded bronze weapons, tools, 
fishing implements, scrap gold and silver, cylinder seals, scarabs, beads, and ce-
ramic vessels, among other items. Twenty-seven weights were recovered from 
Area 1, including 13 sphendonoid weights, three discoid weights, ten domed 
weights, and the one zoomorphic weight (W 149) that features a bucolic scene 
(Plate 25.4).35 Pulak surmises that these weights “must have been kept on board 
either precisely where they were found or, more likely, they spilled down some 
distance from areas even farther up slope corresponding to the very stern of 
the ship.”36 The pattern of spillage is immediately apparent: the weights follow 
a northeasterly path in accordance with the vessel’s starboard list and eastern 
downgrade. Yet it is interesting to note that most of the weights remained in an 
area of 1 m × 1½ m. Of the 27 weights recovered from Area 1, only six examples 
lie outside this small vicinity.
Area 1 contains the four heaviest weight specimens found at the site: W 127, 
a domed hematite piece with a weight of 916.7 g; W 128, also a domed hematite 
piece weighing approximately 925.6 g (calc.); W 129, a lead discoid specimen 
with a weight of 2,483 ± 2 g (−); and W 130, a diorite (?) sphendonoid weight 
weighing 7,632 ± 2 g. The remaining pieces range from 2.07 g to 409.70 g (−). 
Two weights that were found within the same 25 cm square area, W 121 (domed 
hematite) and W 122 (domed serpentine), differ in weight by a mere .02 g. Piec-
es from each possible weight standard present on board the ship were found 
in Area 1 in the following suggested denominations: for Mesopotamian shekel 
weights, ¼, 1, 3, 5, 50, and 300; for necef weights, 1 and 2; for peyem weights, 1, 3, 
and 1000; and for Syrian shekel weights, ½, ⅔, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 100, 250, and 800.
Twelve of the weights found in Area 1 are carved out of hematite, including 
domed, discoid, and sphendonoid examples. Also found in Area 1 are weights

Weights are identified according to Pulak’s numerical classification, with the following 
designations added: sw for sphendonoid weight, dw for domed or discoid weight, and 
zw for zoomorphic weight. Asterisks indicate that a weight’s precise location within the 
one-meter square in which it appears is not known.

in bronze (3), lead (2), diorite (2), limestone (2), limonite (2), ilmenite (1), ka-
olin or argilite (1), and steatite (1); one unique weight, W 122, is carved out of 
serpentine. Weights that appear to have been fitted with lead plugs include 
W 149 and W 78. It is notable that each standard is represented by weights of 
various materials.
Most of the weight forms found in Area 1 are typical of their type. Of note is 
a diorite weight, W 35, which closely resembles a cowry shell, a form common 
to Late Bronze Age weights and amulets.37 Zoomorphic weight W 149 is a heavy 
bronze/lead specimen that features a wonderfully lively agricultural scene of a 
cowherd with his brood; this piece has no known parallel.38
Area 2, O–P/10–13, is defined by a sand gully that stretches along the north-
ern side of Area 1. Only one weight was found in this region, a heavy, diorite, 
discoid piece with a calculated weight of 462.40 g, which could be a 50-unit 
Syrian shekel piece (Plate 25.5).39 It is not clear whether any other artifacts 
were found in this area.40
A collection of objects was found just east (downslope) of Area 1, under a 
row of stone anchors that formed a natural barrier, or catchall, at the stern 
of the ship. This section of the wreck is categorized as Area 3 (L–O/14), and 
many layers of objects (predominantly anchors and ingots) and debris sepa-
rate it from Area 1. A small cache of ten weights of sphendonoid, domed, and 
zoomorphic types was painstakingly recovered from this region (Plate 25.6), 
including a miniscule bronze weight in the shape of a fly, W 133.41 Two other 
zoomorphic weights, W 136 and W 143, were also found in Area 3. That both of 
these weights are shaped like frogs makes this an interesting threesome.42
Balance weights with weights in the range of the Mesopotamian shekel, 
Syrian shekel, and peyem standards were recovered from Area 3. Four weights 
in total possibly represent ½, ⅔, 1, and 20 units of the Mesopotamian shekel, 
while the Syrian shekel weights found in this area include units of 1, 2, 5, and 20. 
The fly’s weight cannot now be determined, yet Pulak’s estimate puts it in the 
range of ½ peyem. Estimated or actual weights of the balance weights in Area 
3 range from 3.74 g (est.) to 184.33 g.

One half of the weights found in Area 3 are made of hematite. W 36 is com-
posed of a mix of hematite, goethite, and possibly limonite, and it boasts a plug 
that contains traces of lead. All three zoomorphic weights found in this area 
are made of bronze, and W 143 has a lead core. W 111 is the only all-lead speci-
men in Area 3, and W 57 is the only limestone example found here.
Many of the weight forms seen in Area 3 are not uniform. Of note is weight 
W 15, a well-finished but slightly irregular rectangle with a low profile. Lead 
discoid weight W 111 has a large hole at its center.
Area 4 (Plate 25.7) is characterized by a southern gully that spans I–K/9–
13. This region of the shipwreck contained ivory, gold jewelry, beads, bronze 
weapons and tools, pottery, a gold chalice, and three lead weights: two discoid 
pieces (W 108 and W 109) and one domed weight (W 79).43 W 108 and W 109 
were both found in J10, while W 79 was located further west in K13. Each of 
the two discoid weights has a central piercing, and the domed weight has a 
low profile but no other unusual features. These specimens range in weight 
from 42.62 g to 155.48 g, with two examples weighing over 100 g, and they con-
ceivably conform to three standards: W 79 may be five units of the Mesopota-
mian shekel standard, W 109 is likely a 15-unit necef piece, and W 108 is possibly 
equivalent to 15 Syrian shekels. It is interesting that all three of these pieces are 
made of lead, and that the discoid specimens share the same physical charac-
teristics and unit denominations, although they represent different standards.
Downslope of these four areas is a sandy plateau, located to the west of a 
large rock outcropping that demarcates the center of the site. This area has a 
sudden drop at its midpoint that cuts the space into upper and lower sections. 
The northern and upper section is Area 5 (M–O/15), comprising a 1 m × 3 m 
strip that yielded many weights, including 18 sphendonoid, seven domed, one 
discoid, and two zoomorphic weights (W 134 and W 142), for a total of 28 speci-
mens (Plate 25.8).44 Several weight clusters are apparent.
Examples of all four weight standards were found in this area. Of the Meso-
potamian shekel standard, units of ⅕, ½, ⅔, ¾, 1, 5, and 10 are present. Pos-
sible peyem pieces include units of ½, 1, 1½, and 10. One example of the necef 
­standard is likely a one-unit piece. Units of the Syrian shekel standard include 
⅔, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 50. Most pieces fall within a weight range of 1.78 g to 92.43 g, 
and one specimen, W 125, has a weight of 458.54 g.

The Weight of Good Measure
Six weights from Area 5 are cast bronze, and two domed weights are cast 
lead. Of the stone weights, 13 are hematite, six are ilmenite (one ilmenite ex-
ample, W 40, has a lead plug), one is limonite, and one weight is carved out of 
limestone.
There are several curious forms in this assemblage of weights. For example, 
W 81, a hematite prismatic weight that is categorized as sphendonoid, features 
mostly flat sides that come together to form a triangular profile. Both zoomor-
phic weights found in Area 5 are atypical: W 134, possibly a grebe, has an up-
right head and open beak, setting it apart from the archetypal sleeping-duck 
weight. W 142, a diminutive recumbent calf that stretches backward to clean 
his haunches, is a definite departure from more frequently seen stoic, forward-
facing bovine weights.45 A weight in the shape of a scarab, W 23,46 is not men-
tioned by Pulak in his discussion of the zoomorphic weights.47 This trio was 
found within N15.
To the south of Area 5 is Area 6 (Plate 25.9), an irregular patch that roughly 
spans J–L/14–17. This area is formed by the sudden drop-off of the sandy pla-
teau that comprises Area 5; another plateau fans out beneath this area to the 
south of the site’s central rock outcropping. Pulak’s description of this area 
does not account for J–L/16–17, a region that contained three weights.48 Based 
on his overall narrative of the site and on the site plan, I have here opted to in-
clude J–L/16–17 in Area 6. A standout find in Area 6 is a set of ritualistic faience 
ram’s head cups. Twenty-four weights were located here, including 14 sphen-
donoid types, four domed pieces, and an impressive total of six zoomorphic 
weights.49
All four weight standards are present in Area 6. Again, series of peyem 
weights in units of ½, 1, and 1½ occur. The necef weights found in Area 6 exhib-
it a wider range of denominations than those seen in other areas, with possible 
units of ⅓, ⅔, 1, 2, and 3. Weights of the Mesopotamian shekel standard include 
units of ⅙, ½, ⅔, and 10. Among the Syrian shekel weights are possible units 
of ½, ⅔, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. The heaviest weight in this area is W 105, a domed 
hematite piece weighing 93.03 g. W 131, the most miniscule of the zoomorphic 
weights, is the lightest weight found in Area 6 and weighs 1.46 g (−).

The largest quantity of bronze weights is found here, with 13 examples, one 
of which has a lead core. Other materials include hematite (4 examples), dio-
rite (3), steatite (2), lead (1), and limonite (1).
Several noteworthy weight forms can be seen in Area 6. A unique bronze 
weight, W 26, which is classified as a domed weight, features a rounded base 
with upward rising pentagonal sides that meet on the weight’s topside (?) in 
a point. Five concavities surround a central, raised concavity, and the over-
all visual effect of this piece is something like honeycomb. Another irregular 
weight, W 72, which is moderately well preserved, may have been a replace-
ment weight. The six zoomorphic weights from Area 6 include the following 
form types: bovine (W 135 and W 144), duck (W 131 and W 141), sphinx (W 147), 
and a possible zoomorphic weight of unidentified form (W 138). Interestingly, 
three weights that are marked with a bar (either “I” or “I”), W 5, W 8, and W 25, 
come from this area, one of which (W 8) was found in J15 along with a weight 
that is marked with a bird’s foot (W 96). The others, W 5 and W 25, were found 
in the same 25-centimeter square in K14.
At the bottom of the site, the ship’s bow became wedged between the rock 
walls of a large gully that extends over the area M–P/16–20. Incidentally, the 
rock walls preserved the bow portion of the hull, with the result that much 
of the cargo in this area remained intact. Three rows of copper ingots, some 
still stored in stacks, demarcate the uppermost limit of this region, Area 7 (M–
O/16–20). Items found here include bronze implements and weapons, beads, 
cylinder seals, glass ingots, ceramic and bronze vessels, ivory cosmetic contain-
ers, and 16 stone anchors. Fifty-two weights were found (Plate 25.10), including 
31 sphendonoid weights, 16 domed weights, and six zoomorphic weights.50 No 
discoid weights were found in this region, and many clusters of weights were 
found within 25 cm square areas.51
Each of the four suggested weight standards is present in Area 7. Possible 
units of the Mesopotamian shekel standard include ⅓, ¼, ½, ⅔, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 
and 20. Five weights have been suggested to be one-unit pieces of the necef 
standard, and there are possible necef units of ⅔ and 15, which could also cor-
respond to other standards. Of the peyem standard, there are units of ½, 1, and 
possibly 1½ and 2. The Syrian shekel denominations found in Area 7 are ⅙, ½,

¾, 1, 1½, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50. Weights range from 1.56 g to 456.48 g, with 11 
pieces weighing over 100 g.
A majority of the weights found in Area 7 are made of stone. Out of 27 he-
matite weights, three have lead plugs. Other stone types include limestone (4 
examples), diorite (3), ilmenite (2), limonite/goethite (1), magnetite (1), and 
marl (1). A large quantity of bronze weights was also recovered from the ship’s 
bow, for a total of 11 specimens, four of which (all zoomorphic) have lead cores. 
One possible zoomorphic lead weight of an uncertain form comes from this 
area as well.
Three stone pieces from Area 7, W 4, W 18, and W 44, resemble pebbles, sug-
gesting that they may have been replacement pieces. A portion of W 63 was 
broken away at some point during its use, and part of the broken portion was 
later reattached. W 46 has a small hole in one end that has been fitted with 
a bronze loop, presumably for suspension. Remarkably, two domed diorite 
weights that have identical L-shaped marks (∟), W 120 and W 124, were found 
in this area in nearby 25 cm square areas within O17. The lion weights were 
recovered from diagonally adjacent 25 cm square areas in N18. Other zoomor-
phic types found here include two bovines, one animal head, possibly that of 
a canine, and W 140, which is too corroded to be identified, and may not be a 
zoomorphic weight at all.
Two weights were found downslope of the site’s central rock outcropping 
in a 3 m × 3 m area, J–L/18–20, designated Area 8 (Plate 25.11).52 This area also 
yielded pottery vessels, including Canaanite amphorae, and hundreds of fish-
net weights. According to Pulak, “these artifacts must have rolled over the 
boulder while the hull was still relatively intact and dropped directly below 
and downslope of the boulder, where they were discovered.”53 W 146, a moder-
ately heavy (54.97 g) bovine weight cast in bronze with a lead core, and W 107, a 
94.65 g sphendonoid weight carved in hematite and fitted with a tin loop, were 
found in K19 and L19, respectively. W 146 may be a five-unit necef piece, while 
W 107 is likely a ten-unit Syrian shekel weight.
One weight remains to be discussed: W 112, a domed specimen carved out 
of diorite, which was the only weight found in the southeastern portion of the 
site.54 This region comprises Area 9 (C–H/16–33), a sand gully that extends 
downslope to a depth of 60 meters. Artifacts were scattered throughout this

vast region, including at least four large pithoi. The 182.3 g weight was found in 
F21. Pulak surmises that this weight is a 20-unit Syrian shekel piece.55
	
Reconfiguring the Uluburun Weight Sets
A new configuration of international weight sets, based on the distribution of 
weights as found at the site of the Uluburun shipwreck, is offered here as a 
possible alternative to the prevailing interpretation. If one assumes that the 
distribution of weights on the sea bed does reflect the original location of the 
individual weights on board the ship, then the position of the weights as found 
should indicate how the weights were organized into sets. It is, of course, pos-
sible that this assumption cannot be sustained. Nonetheless, it is interesting to 
view the Uluburun weights from this perspective. In order to test the plausibil-
ity of this theory, the range of weights in the proposed international sets has 
been tabulated—in order to determine whether these new sets are feasible. 
Specimens that might conform to multiple standards are indicated with an 
asterisk.
First to be considered are the weights found in Area 1. Fourteen weights of 
the Syrian shekel standard were found here, including three sphendonoid, nine 
domed, and two discoid weights (Table 25.1). All are stone, with the exception 
of weight W 129, which can also be fit within the Mesopotamian shekel system.
Additive units present among this group include: 10 + 10 = 20; 10 + 20 = 30; 
10 + 10 + 20 + 30 + 30 = 100; and 20 + 30 + 100 + 100 = 250. The ½-unit and 
whole-unit pieces can be combined to create an irregular pattern of Syrian 
shekel totals: 3, 3½, 5, 5½, 6, 6½, 8, 8½, 10, 10½, 13, 13½, 15, 15½, 16, 16½, 18, 
18½, 20, 20½, 23, 23½, 25, 25½, 26, 26½, 28, 28½, and so on through 321½. The 
⅔-shekel domed weight and the 250-shekel discoid weight allow for an even 
greater number of nonsequential combinations up to 571 + ⅔ Syrian shekels.
The second group found in Area 1 includes six weights that possibly conform 
to the Mesopotamian shekel standard: four sphendonoid weights, one discoid 
weight, and one zoomorphic weight (Table 25.2). Two-thirds of the weights in 
this group are metal. This assemblage, which contains units of ¼, 1, 3, 5, 50, and 
300, can be used to weigh goods in the following amounts: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 50, 
51, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 300, 301, 303, 304, 305, 306, 308, 309, 350, 351, 353, 354, 
355, 356, 358, and 359.

If we assume, as Pulak does, that the weights found in Areas 2, 3, and 4 were 
once stored with the weights found in Area 1, then the groups of Syrian and 
Mesopotamian shekel weights found in these areas become more logical. A 
group of Syrian shekel weights derived from Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 consists of 24 
pieces: five sphendonoid weights, 11 domed weights, five discoid weights, and 
three zoomorphic weights (Table 25.3). Stone, bronze, and lead pieces occur in 
this assemblage. Alternative unit denominations for the fly-shaped weight, W 
133, have been suggested.
This group contains numerous combinations of additive units in the follow-
ing sequences: ½ + ½ = 1; ⅓ + ⅔ = 1; ½ + ½ + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3; 2 + 3 = 5; 5 + 5 = 10;

20 + 30 + 50 = 100; 50 + 100 + 100 = 250. Weight specimens can be arranged in 
myriad combinations that result in discrete, sequential multiples up to 669 
Syrian shekels inclusive. The heaviest weight in the assemblage, W 130, which 
possibly represents 800 Syrian shekels, allows for further balance totals of up to 
1,469 + ⅔ Syrian shekels.
Eleven weights that can be fit within the Mesopotamian shekel standard 
were found in Areas 1 to 4 (Table 25.4). This assemblage contains seven sphen-
donoid weights, one domed weight, two discoid weights, and one zoomorphic 
weight. A high proportion of metallic weights can be seen in this group. Several 
of these weights share similar resultant unit masses. They can be combined to 
create numerous multiple and fractional totals in the following ranges: 0–16, 
20–36, 50–66, 70–86, 300–316, 320–336, 350–366, and 370–386 Mesopotamian 
shekels. The gap in values (from 85 to 300) may indicate that W 129 conforms to 
the Syrian shekel standard.
Shown in Table 25.5 are an additional three weights that may correspond to 
the Syro-Canaanite peyem standard: two hematite sphendonoid weights and 
one bronze zoomorphic weight that is also listed in Table 25.3.
The peyem weights from Areas 1 through 4 can be compiled into weight 
values of ½, 1, 1½, 3, 3½, 4, and 4½. Overall, weights from Areas 1 through 
4 comprise three usable groups of sphendonoid, domed, and discoid weights 
in stone and metal, with one group each conforming to the Syrian shekel,

Mesopotamian shekel, and peyem standards. Each of the groups found in Areas 
1 to 4 contains at least one zoomorphic weight. Four one-unit necef pieces were 
also found in this region.
Next to be considered is a group of Syrian shekel weights that was found in 
Area 5. Sixteen specimens are included: ten sphendonoid weights and seven 
domed weights (Table 25.6). It is questionable as to whether the scarab weight, 
W 23, should be classified as a sphendonoid weight; if it is instead considered

The Weight of Good Measure
to be of the zoomorphic type, then this assemblage contains one zoomorphic 
piece. A high proportion of ilmenite and hematite weights can be observed 
among this group. Several of the Syrian shekel units found in Area 5 have iden-
tical or nearly identical resultant unit masses. Units occur in multiples of addi-
tive values 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10; an additional 50-unit piece is present. The distinct 
and consecutive multiple Syrian shekel values that can be made with these 
weights include 1–99, and the maximum balance that can be met is 101 + ⅔ 
Syrian shekels.
Shown in Table 25.7 are the units found in Area 5 that feasibly correspond 
to the Mesopotamian shekel standard. There are nine specimens in this group: 
five sphendonoid, two domed, one discoid, and one zoomorphic weight. With 
the exception of ilmenite weight W 14, this group is one-half hematite and one-
half bronze. A majority of the Mesopotamian shekel units in this group are 
fractional. Some of the values that can be reached with these weights include: 
½, 1, 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 3½, 4 ⅙, 5, 5 ½, 6, 6½, 7, 7½, 8, 8½, 9 ⅙, 10, 10½, and so on. 
The maximum capacity of this group is 20 11/30 Mesopotamian shekels.
Weights that possibly conform to the peyem standard that were found in Area 
5 can be arranged into a small group consisting of one bronze sphendonoid 
weight, two stone sphendonoid weights, and one bronze zoomorphic weight 
(Table 25.8). The values that can be achieved with this group include ½, 1, 1½, 2, 
2½, 3, 10, 10½, 11, 11½, 12, and 13. In summary, usable groups found in Area 5 include 
one each of the peyem, Mesopotamian shekel, and Syrian shekel standard, and 
each example contains one zoomorphic specimen, if the scarab weight is to be

classified as a zoomorphic piece. In addition, a one-unit necef piece was found 
in this area.
Four different groups of weights, one of each standard, were found in Area 6.  
Of nine metal and stone weights that possibly adhere to the Syrian shekel 
standard, seven are sphendonoid, two are domed, and one is zoomorphic 
­(Table 25.9). Once again, units of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 occur. These weights, along 
with the fractional pieces, can be combined to produce Syrian shekel values of 
1–32, with a maximum balance of 33¼.
Only five potential Mesopotamian shekel weights were found in Area 6: four 
sphendonoid weights and one zoomorphic weight (Table 25.10). Three pieces 
are metal and two are stone. Most of these units are fractional, allowing for the 
following ­values: ⅙, ½, ⅔, ⅚, 1⅙, 1⅓, 1⅔, 1⅚, 10⅙, 10½, 10⅔, 10 ⅚, 11, 11⅙, 11⅔,

and 11⅚ ­Mesopotamian shekels. It is interesting to note that the fractional units 
can be combined in multiple ways in order to achieve the values of ⅔ and 1⅙.
A small group of mostly metal peyem weights was also found in Area 6 (Ta-
ble 25.11). Two of the weights are of the sphendonoid type, and two are zoo-
morphic. These units provide the following weight values: ½, 1, 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 
3½, and 4. Peyem units of ½, 1, and 1½ were also found in Area 5.
The final group found in Area 6 contains four sphendonoid weights and 
one zoomorphic weight, all of which can be reasonably ascribed to the ­necef 
standard (Table 25.12). Three of the weights are bronze and two are stone. 
Additive units in this group provide the following sequences: ⅓  +  ⅔  =  1; 
⅓ + ⅔ + 1 = 2; and 1 + 2 = 3. Several weight values can be measured with these 
pieces, including ⅓, ⅔, 1, 1⅓, 1⅔, 2, 2⅓, 2⅔, 3, 3⅓, 3⅔, 4, 4⅓, 4⅔, 5, 5⅓, 5⅔,

the Syrian shekel, Mesopotamian shekel, peyem, and necef standards, and each 
of these assemblages includes at least one zoomorphic weight. While the units 
and standards of the three bar-marked weights are difficult to ascertain, it is 
significant that they are all part of this group.
Area 7 of the shipwreck is densely populated with weights, and multiple 
examples of particular unit denominations of both the Mesopotamian shek-
el and Syrian shekel standard are present among them. A group of 29 Syrian 
shekel weights includes 15 sphendonoid pieces, 13 domed pieces, and one well-
preserved zoomorphic weight in the shape of a cow (Table 25.13). Most of these 
pieces are made of stone, three have lead plugs, and two are cast in bronze. It 
appears that two diorite specimens marked with an L-shape (∟), W 120 and 
W 124, are related. Additive relationships in numerous combinations can be 
seen in this assemblage, for example, 1 + 2 = 3; 2 + 3 = 5; 5 + 5 = 10; 10 + 10 = 20; 
10 + 20 = 30; 20 + 30 = 50. Balances containing sequential multiple values of 
1–320 Syrian shekels can be met, and the maximum weighing capacity is 322 
11/12 Syrian shekels.
A second group from Area 7 includes 13 pieces that can be ascribed to the 
Mesopotamian shekel standard (Table 25.14). Eight weights are sphendonoid, 
two are domed, and three are zoomorphic. Approximately one-third of the 
weights in this group are bronze, and another third are hematite. The male and 
female lion weights found in this group look to be a matching pair in terms of 
form, style, material, and standard. This group of Mesopotamian shekel weights 
consists of the following additive units: ⅓ + ⅔ = 1; ⅓ + ⅔ + 1 = 2; 2 + 1 = 3; 
2 + 3 = 5; 2 + 3 + 5 = 10; and 2 + 3 + 5 + 10 = 20. The sequential multiple values 
that can be attained include 1–70; the maximum weight value of this group is 
707/12 Mesopotamian shekels.

In addition, a small group of peyem weights comes from Area 7 (Table 25.15). All 
six weights are of the sphendonoid type. Four are made of hematite, and one is 
of bronze. These units add up to weight values of ½, 1, 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 3½, 4, 4½, 5, 
and 5½. As in two other examples (Areas 5 and 6), units of ½, 1, and 1½ are found

in this group. While this group does not contain a zoomorphic weight, two pos-
sible zoomorphic weights, one unspecified and one perhaps in the shape of a 
canine head, were found in this vicinity, and each may represent a one-unit ne-
cef piece. A zoomorphic weight in the shape of a bovine (W 146) that was found 
in adjacent Area 8 may have become estranged from the weights found in Area 
7; this weight could represent 5 units of the necef standard. Thus, three usable 
groups of weights representing the Syrian shekel, Mesopotamian shekel, and 
peyem standards were all recovered from Area 7. All but one of these groups

Concluding Remarks
Study of the contexts of the Uluburun balance weights reveals that heteroge-
neous, usable groups of Syrian shekel, Mesopotamian shekel, peyem, and necef 
weights were recovered from four regions: Areas 1–4, Area 5, Area 6, and Area 7. 
Providing that the contexts are meaningful in terms of the original locations 
of the weights on board the ship, these groups can be arranged provisionally 
into four international weight sets (Table 25.16), each containing a collection 
of weights representing various standards needed to regulate trade in an inter-
national economy. Each set consists of diverse weight units that facilitate the 
weighing of numerous values.
Every set contains a mixture of geometric and zoomorphic weight forms 
in each of the four weight standards found at the site. Two separate groups of 
seemingly related marked weights belong to two separate sets. For the Syrian 
shekel weights, units of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 are common to all sets. All sets contain 
at least one one-unit necef weight, and two sets also have 15-unit necef weights. 
Only Set 3 has necef units in other denominations, including multiple and frac-
tional units. Interestingly, this set contains the lowest weight ranges among 
its Syrian shekel, Mesopotamian shekel, and peyem groups. Sets with greater 
Syrian shekel weight ranges, Set 1 and Set 4, have an increased number of (and 
subsequent increased range among) necef pieces. One-unit necef pieces, which 
are common to every set, were possibly used to facilitate conversions in an 
international marketplace. A scant quantity of peyem weights of a limited de-
nominational range may allude to the parameters of a seafaring merchant’s 
set: every set has half-unit and one-unit peyem pieces, and three sets also have 
one-and-a-half-unit pieces. Weights marked with an asterisk may represent 
multiple weight standards.
Of special interest is a contemporary set of 14 weights excavated from Build-
ing iii, Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios, Cyprus, which includes zoomorphic, geo-
metric, and anthropomorphic weights of Syrian shekel, Mesopotamian shekel, 
and necef standards (Table 25.17). This set dates to ca. 1325–1200 b.c.e. and 
was found with a hematite cylinder seal that features a motif of human figures 
holding animals by their hind legs.58

The Weight of Good Measure
Hanne Lassen regards these weights as an international set, one that “reflects 
the island’s trade connections in all directions.” 5960 The forms, standards, and 
materials represented in this terrestrial find parallel those from the Uluburun 
assemblage and support the hypothesis that the Uluburun weights may have 
functioned as international sets.
Zoomorphic weights are particularly intriguing. H.W. Catling proposes that 
two zoomorphic weights found on Cyprus, which he believes to be of Near 
Eastern or Egyptian origin, were collected by Cypriot merchants as curiosi-
ties or souvenirs.61 The presence at Uluburun of a relatively small number of 
zoomorphic weights among what could be international sets consisting pre-
dominantly of geometric weights gives credence to the theory that zoomor-
phic weights were collected. Moreover, the evocative relationships observed 
among the Uluburun finds may well reflect a merchant’s preferences and

tastes. Two frog weights (W 136 and W 143) found in Area 3 were located near 
a fly-shaped weight (W 133)—a potential snack. An unusually animated calf 
weight (W 142) that stands out among the other bovine examples was found 
in the same one-meter square area (N15) as an atypical water bird featuring an 
erect and forward-facing head and open beak (W 134) and an unusual scarab-
shaped weight (W 23). Both lion and lioness (W 148 and W 145, respectively) 
were recovered from the same one-meter square area, N18. It is appealing to 
imagine that these combinations are the result of deliberate choices made by 
ancient collectors who were also merchant mariners.
Similarities between the Uluburun zoomorphic weights and New Kingdom 
Egyptian amulets may suggest the intersection of Late Bronze Age economies 
and contemporary belief systems. During the period, amulets were widely con-
sidered to be physical receptacles of heka, and they were frequently employed 
to prevent harmful or disruptive events.62 Several of the zoomorphic forms 
found at Uluburun—fly, duck, cow, lion, sphinx, and frog—were commonly 
manufactured as amulets during the 18th Dynasty, and each animal embodied 
specific attributes.63 A magical connection between zoomorphic amulets and 
weights, or the imagining of zoomorphic weights as apotropaic devices, would 
have provided incentive for both the individual merchant and the state to in-
corporate zoomorphic weights into weight sets. It is possible that the zoomor-
phic weights found at Uluburun had amuletic properties, and may have been 
souvenirs or status markers that were collected by itinerant merchants and 
integrated into international weight sets.64
The inclusion of bronze zoomorphic weights in temple and burial contexts 
implies that zoomorphic weights had a special purpose.65 Two bronze zoomor-
phic weights discovered in Tomb C1 at a site in Akko, Israel, each weighing 
47.8 g, are thought perhaps to have served as amulets.66 In order to further ex-
plore the possibility that zoomorphic weights were collected or had amuletic 
properties, assemblages such as the one from Uluburun should be compared

weights—such as Alalakh, Turkey; Ugarit/Ras Shamra, Syria; Sarepta, Lebanon; 
Akko, Askalon, Arad, ‘En Shemer, Hazor, Megiddo, Tel Nami, and Tell Abu Ha-
wam, Israel; Kalavasos-Ayios Dhimitrios, Enkomi, Kition, and Maroni, Cyprus; 
Nippur, Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Ur, Iraq; Amarna and various other locations, 
Egypt. Notably, the Uluburun collection of zoomorphic weights comprises the 
largest known group of Late Bronze Age zoomorphic weights ever to be found.
Five types of zoomorphic weights have been found on Cyprus (bull/cow/
calf, lioness, duck, boar, and goat). Four zoomorphic weight types have been 
recovered from Egypt (bull, lion, frog, and duck), and three types have been 
found in Iraq (lion, frog, and duck) and in Israel (bull, lion, ram/sheep). Two 
types (bull and lion) have been found in Syria. One zoomorphic weight, a bull, 
comes from Lebanon, and duck weights have been found in Turkey.67 A bo-
vine weight, which has been described as Mycenaean, is presumably from 
the Aegean.68 No other definitive examples of sphinx weights are extant, al-
though Pulak cites a possible example from the Middle Bronze Age Temple of 
the Obelisks, Byblos,69 as well as another at Harvard of unknown provenience. 
The Uluburun shipwreck contained what is believed to be the only extant fly 
weight, and the multi-figured bucolic weight has no known parallel.70
It would be interesting to know whether the proliferation of gift exchange 
and trade in luxury goods—and a concomitant increase in high-risk com­
mercial ventures—engendered a surge in the production and collection of 
zoomorphic weights. One might also investigate whether Late Bronze Age 
zoomorphic weights and amulets relate to the propagation of animal imagery 
under Amenhotep iii.71 Further examination of the Uluburun weights may 
help to establish the parameters of an interconnected, international, ritual 
economy, one in which merchants or weighing specialists were sanctioned by 
the state to protect and distribute costly products and politically charged gifts 
based on their ability to uphold the laws of just weights and balances.72

Kyme: An Ancient Center of Jewelry Production in 
Asia Minor
Özgen Acar
Apparently in the early 1870s, over 100 items of gold jewelry dating largely from 
the fourth and third centuries b.c. were likely looted from tombs near the an-
cient city of Kyme in western Turkey (Plate 26.1). The jewelry was bought by 
the British Museum, London, in three lots between 1876 and 1878. The Kyme 
Treasure, as these works are now known, is one of the great finds of ancient 
Greek jewelry, although lacking an archaeological provenience. Several impor-
tant pieces were featured in the exhibition Greek Gold: Jewellery of the Classical 
World, held in 1994–1995 at the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art, New York. The exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue, in which the 
selected works from the Kyme Treasure are shown.1
In 2008–2009, a team from the Izmir Archaeological Museum excavated a 
rich collection of gold jewelry from a number of tombs in an important necrop-
olis at Kyme (Plate 26.2).2 The newly excavated jewelry has close ­counterparts 
in the British Museum works said to be from that site. The new excavations at 
Kyme (modern Aliağa) were supervised by Mehmet Tuna, Director of the Izmir 
Archaeological Museum, and conducted by his assistant Nuray Çırak and ar-
chaeologist Selma Kaya (Plate 26.3). I extend my gratitude to these colleagues 
and to the staff of the Izmir Archaeological Museum for allowing me to publish 
this spectacular jewelry, as a fitting tribute to Oscar White Muscarella, who has 
long campaigned against the looting of archaeological sites and promoted the 
importance of scientific excavation for the knowledge that only it can provide.
	
The Kyme Jewelry in the British Museum
The British Museum acquired the first lot of its Kyme collection from an Ath-
ens antiquities dealer, Jean P. Lambros, who had bought the works from Alfred 
J. Lawson, Director of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Smyrna (Izmir), Turkey.

528
The second lot was acquired directly from Lawson himself, mentioned in a let-
ter of May 27, 1875, in which he states the following:
A short while ago I bought the remaining fragments of the gold orna-
ments I had sold to Mr. Lambros … The holder of this portion has had it 
put by ever since the time the tomb containing the jewellery was opened 
by himself & another man and has only now consented to part with it, 
through an agent of mine. —Owing to the commotion made at the time 
of the find, I have been compelled to pay a relatively high price—but 
it was so necessary, for considerations I will explain, that other buyers 
should not be attracted to the spot that I was obliged to come to terms 
with the possessor the moment he reluctantly showed the jewellery and 
named his price.—The reason why I acted so promptly in this matter is 
owing to the fact that this man’s property includes several other tombs, 
quite as ancient, which, from considerations of personal safety, he must 
open in such a way as not to attract the attention of his neighbours, as 
his life might be endangered by any extravagant reports; and the country 
about is not very secure.—I expect that by winter he will be enabled to 
work, and his “discoveries” will then come to me.3
The British Museum collection comprises elaborate gold necklaces, pendants, 
beads, earrings, disks, strips, diadems, rosettes, and other ornaments, along 
with a gold stater of Alexander the Great.4
	
The Jewelry Excavated at Kyme (Aliağa)
Ancient Kyme (Cyme) was the most powerful of the Aeolian cities on the west-
ern coast of Asia Minor. In the Classical period it was dominated by Athens 
under the Delian League, and subsequently by the Seleucids, the Attalids of 
Pergamon, and finally the Romans. Excavations have been carried out at the 
site since the late 19th century, but few remains of the ancient city are ­visible

of earrings acquired by the British Museum in 1877 and dated to the fifth century b.c. (no. 
47), although Marshall does not mention Kyme in his entry for these earrings (cat. nos. 
1585–1586).

Kyme: An Ancient Center of Jewelry Production in Asia Minor
today. Cemetery areas have been excavated by French, Italian, and Turkish 
teams, with an important necropolis discovered in 2007 by the Izmir Archaeo-
logical Museum. This was followed by rescue operations carried out by the mu-
seum in 2008 and 2009, which produced the fabulous collection of gold jewelry 
published here.
During a two-month period in 2008, a total of 48 graves were opened, in 
which 22 female and 16 male skeletons were found (the gender of 7 could not 
be determined). In 2009, 215 graves were excavated, containing the remains of 
73 males, 52 females, and 25 children (the gender of 66 skeletons could not be 
determined).5 Typically, the graves were lined with slabs of limestone and con-
tained stone sarcophagi. The burials contained a variety of ceramics indicating 
a range of dates from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods (sixth–third 
centuries b.c.). The fine gold jewelry recovered dates to the same period as the 
majority of the works in the British Museum (fourth and third centuries b.c.) 
and is closely related in style and type.
Particularly remarkable in this regard are the gold diadems (Plates 26.4–
26.5). The British Museum collection contains 18 gold diadems and strips (or 
fragments thereof) including one diadem illustrated in the Greek Gold cata-
logue6 that looks very much like several diadems excavated from the Kyme-
Aliağa graves. These examples rise to a point at the front, with a central design 
featuring a small quatrefoil motif enclosed by curling tendrils and topped by 
a palmette. To the sides are two seated, winged figures7 and then tendrils and 
rosettes that run toward the two ends. The close similarity between the British 
Museum diadem and the recently excavated examples suggests that they may 
have been made by the same artisan, perhaps using the very same mold. Also 
related is a gold diadem of the same shape said to be from the ancient city 
of Madytos (modern Eceabat), in Çanakkale province, bought by the Metro-
politan Museum of Art in 1906.8 This diadem depicts Dionysus and Ariadne at 
the center, with tendrils and seated figures—presumably Muses—to the sides. 
Other items in the Madytos group are earrings, necklaces, a ring, and flower 
heads, thought to be parts of a headdress.
5	 The skeletons are being examined by Ms. Asuman Alpagut, Museum of Anatolian Civiliza-
tions, Ankara. It is reported that some of the bones indicated anemia due to poor diet, as well 
as osteoporosis along with tooth and ear infections. In general, the people seemed to have 
been healthy.

7	 Williams and Ogden suggest that one of these figures is male and the other female. Alter-
nately, these may represent the brothers Hypnos and Thanatos, symbols of sleep and death.

One of the most impressive of the recently excavated finds from Kyme-
Aliağa is a gold scarab ring, of a kind rarely found in Asia Minor (Plate 26.6) 
and more directly related to Egyptian prototypes.9 The convex side of the gold 
jewel in the Kyme ring is in the form of a scarab; the concave side, which may 
have functioned as a seal, depicts a maenad, one of the ecstatic female follow-
ers of the god of wine, Dionysus. A similar ring was found in the “Tomb of the 
Priestess of Demeter” in the Great Bliznitza mound on the Taman peninsula in 
the Crimea, on the north coast of the Black Sea.10 The Great Bliznitza scarab 
ring has an engraved scene on the underside showing Aphrodite with an Eros 
adjusting her sandal. In both cases the hoop is made of twisted wire.
The abundance of gold chains with clasps in the form of a “Herakles knot” 
is a striking feature of the jewelry excavated at Kyme-Aliağa (Plate 26.7). This 
design was an amuletic motif, likely developing in Egypt in the second mil-
lennium b.c. and appearing in Greece as early as the Mycenaean period. It 
enjoyed particular popularity in the Greek world during the second half of the 
fourth century b.c., continuing well into Roman times.11 Other types of ornate 
gold clasps including clasps adorned with precious stones are found on the 
excavated jewelry from Kyme-Aliağa (Plate 26.8). Numerous fine gold earrings 
were recovered in the recent excavations as well. Many of these feature Erotes, 
in one instance riding dolphins, as well as winged figures of Nike (Plate 26.9). 
Comparable earrings are found in the British Museum’s Kyme Treasure.12
Other items from the Kyme-Aliağa burials provide additional archaeological 
and cultural context for the gold jewelry. Mirrors with handles made of bronze, 
cosmetic implements, and glassware imported from other regions were discov-
ered in the graves of women. Is it possible to imagine these elegant ladies, who 
wore such exquisite gold jewelry, without mirrors in which to view themselves? 
Like jewelry, mirrors were elite objects tied to personal adornment and status. 
Throughout the Greek world, they are commonly found in burial contexts, but 
also appear as votive offerings in temples dedicated to deities primarily relat-
ing to marriage, fertility, and childbirth. Their presence in these other envi-
ronments indicates the prestige value and possible symbolic ­meanings that

Beyond its attractive decorative appeal, the “Herakles knot” was utilized as a protective 
device to ensure the healing of wounds and was associated with marriage and childbirth.

mirrors held beyond their utilitarian function.13 Several interesting terracotta 
figures, illustrating women’s hairstyles of the time, were discovered in the 
burials of Kyme-Aliağa. A figurine of a woman sitting on the back of a swan 
is thought to represent a local goddess (Aphrodite?). Theatrical masks and toy 
animals were also present, the latter associated with graves of children.
	
The Aliağa School of Jewelry
There has been much speculation about the origin of the jewelry in the Kyme 
Treasure in the British Museum, not only in terms of its archaeological pro-
venience but also its place of manufacture. Experts have long believed that a 
center for the production of such magnificent jewelry may have existed in the 
vicinity of that site. Several pieces in other collections can be linked stylisti-
cally to the British Museum jewelry said to be from Kyme, suggesting that a 
workshop may have been based there.14 Gold was plentiful in the region, avail-
able from the Pactolus River and the areas of Mt. Ida (Kazdağı) and Pergamon 
(Bergama), and even today gold is still being extracted from nearby mines (see 
Plate 26.1). The gold jewelry recently discovered at Aliağa provides support for 
this idea.
The size and breadth of the Kyme Treasure and associated works strongly 
suggests that the city was an important center of jewelry production begin-
ning in the second half of the fourth century b.c. This notion has been fur-
ther supported by the finds recently discovered in the excavations by the 
Izmir ­Archaeological Museum at Kyme-Aliağa. Furthermore, it seems that 
these workshops were not only producing gold jewelry for Aeolian and ­Ionian 
­clientele but that jewelry was exported even further abroad, evidenced by 
comparable pieces from the Aegean and Black Sea regions.15 The excavations 
carried out at Aliağa by the Izmir Archaeological Museum have not only suc-
ceeded in rescuing an important group of cultural objects; they have also been 
instrumental in shedding light on the history of jewelry making in Asia ­Minor 
and the role of Kyme in both local and regional jewelry production in the 
fourth and third centuries b.c.

Voicing the Past: The Implications of  
Craft-referential Pottery in Ancient Greece
Einav Zamir Dembin
As a graduate student at the Bard Graduate Center I had the great honor of 
meeting Oscar Muscarella when he gave my class a guided tour of the ancient 
collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. During this encounter, he said 
something that has stayed with me ever since: “Art without provenience is art 
without a voice.” Many of us that day made it our personal mission to listen 
more carefully, to advocate for a higher standard of scholarship, and, if pos-
sible, to become a mouthpiece for the voiceless. For me, this has involved an 
attempt to uncover the condition of ancient craftsmen, who have generally re-
mained “without a voice” in the historical record and scholarly discourse. This 
is particularly true of ancient Greek potters and vase painters, whose surviv-
ing works all too frequently lack archaeological context. A poem in the Life of 
Homer, purportedly by Herodotus but commonly dated to the third or second 
century b.c.e., provides a rare glimpse into their world:
If you will pay me for my song, O potters,
then come, Athena, and hold thy hand above the kiln!
May the kotyloi and all the kanastra turn a good black,
may they be well fired and fetch the price asked,
many being sold in the marketplace and many on the roads,
and bring in much money, and may my song be pleasing.
But if you (potters) turn shameless and deceitful,
then do I summon the ravagers of kilns,
both Syntrips (Smasher) and Smaragos (Crasher) and
Asbestos (Unquenchable) too, and Sabaktes (Shake-to-Pieces)
and Omodamos (Conqueror of the Unbaked), who makes
much trouble for this craft.
Stamp on stoking tunnel and chambers, and may the whole kiln
be thrown into confusion, while the potters loudly wail.1

Dembin
538
What one can take away from this colorful passage is threefold: that success 
of a workshop was measured by the monetary gain realized from production, 
not solely on the prestige of the craftsmen-personalities within; that painters 
and potters were in some sense associated with one another (for pots to “turn 
a good black,” someone must apply slip); and that the contemporary image of 
the craftsman, at least in literature, is not a strictly positive one—to wish such 
a heavy sanction on a workshop based on the chance of deceit suggests that the 
author believed this to be well within the realm of possibility. In this connec-
tion, Xenophon states in the Oeconomicus that “the so-called banausic crafts 
are criticized and have a very poor reputation in our poleis, quite reasonably.”2 
He goes on to say that farming and war-making are far more respectable occu-
pations.3 Plato takes this sentiment one step farther in the Republic, when he 
bans demiourgoi (craftsmen) and georgoi (farmers) from participation in gov-
ernment.4 Aristotle, who is generally supportive of the arts,5 insists that “the 
best polis will not make an artisan (banauson) a citizen.”6 This attitude stands 
in contrast to the modern glorification of ancient craftsmen, particularly an-
cient Greek vase-painters.
The most intimate view of the ancient craftsman, although far from com-
plete, is found in the creations of the artisans themselves, who provide not 
only the occasional name to aid in attribution, but also images of their fellows 
in the midst of production, allowing a means of reconstructing workshop prac-
tices. This paper attempts to address what a handful of images on Greek vases 
conveys in terms of workshop hierarchy, the relationship between craftsmen, 
and the status (real or imagined) of artisans within ancient Greek society, by 
examining the settings depicted, the garments worn, and the tools and other 
objects deployed. The images illustrate potters, painters, metalworkers, car-
penters, sculptors, leatherworkers, and weavers. These occur mainly between 
540 and 460 b.c.e., though earlier renderings of craftsmen exist in bronze fig-
urines.7 The appearance of craft-referential pottery is often attributed to the 
Athenian constitutional reforms of 510 b.c.e., which conferred greater value 
on the members of the lower class, while the equally striking disappearance 
of such pottery is considered a result of a “resurgence in aristocratic concerns” 
in the 470s.8

Voicing the Past
Sian Lewis identifies 56 vases depicting craftsmen in a recent ­publication, 
where she discusses several examples in terms of their archaeological ­context.9 
She points to the fact that those images from Athens are found primarily on 
vases from the Acropolis, serving perhaps as dedications. She also attempts to 
explain why images of metalworkers, and not those of potters and painters, 
are the most numerous in her group, citing foreign interest in such scenes.10 
­However, the number of weaving and spinning images depicted on Greek vas-
es far outweighs those of all the other crafts combined, with close to a hundred 
total. The list compiled for the present paper is comprised of 60 vessels,11 in-
cluding some with images of textile manufacture that are not on Lewis’s list.12 
This extended group is not comprehensive. It includes only the examples con-
sulted for the purposes of this paper, which were selected based on their de-
piction of tools, garments, and other associated attributes. A number of these 
objects will be discussed in terms of their social contexts.
Though scholarly interest in ancient occupations and their representation 
on Attic vases may seem relatively recent, the fascination with such images is 
not a new phenomenon.13 In fact, these vases experienced great popularity 
among early collectors,14 who idealized the ancient artist and were therefore 
attracted to representations of craftsmen at work. However, this interest fueled 
looting operations, and many of the extant pieces lack archaeological prove-
nience. For example, an early fourth century kylix, with an interior scene of a 
potter working at a wheel, was in the possession of Giuseppe Zitelli (an Italian 
official and dealer of Egyptian antiquities) before 1847, when it was purchased 
by the British Museum with no archaeological context. Similarly, the sole ex-
tant image of a stonemason on an Attic red-figure kylix is on a plundered vase 
purchased by Robert E. Hecht and then sold to the Museum of Fine Arts in 
Boston in 1962. The vase was said to come from Cerveteri, but the attribution 
was based only on the word of Hecht and his source. With so few extant vessels

The Appendix does not provide a comprehensive list of vases depicting textile working, 
but includes only the examples discussed in this paper. The number of weaving and spin-
ning images, close to a hundred, far outweighs that of all the other crafts combined.
13	
Museum exhibitions, such as “The Fire of Hephaistos: Large Classical Bronzes from North 
American Collections” at the Sackler Museum (1996), demonstrate a modern interest in 
ancient craftsmen. According to Roger Ulrich, scholars such as Hugo Blümner and Albert 
Neuburger based their assessments of ancient technology largely on written descriptions 
and published reproductions, though some of these drawings were inaccurate. Ulrich,

depicting such imagery, the lack of context is particularly problematic. There-
fore, discussion of the manifestation of such scenes in ancient Greece must 
begin with the circumstances of their creation in Attica, as the archaeological 
provenience of the vases is often vague or entirely missing.
Accordingly, it must be asked whether vase painters are to be trusted to pro-
vide accurate glimpses into their lives and those of their fellow artisans. Like 
the aforementioned poet, one must be suspicious of the craftsman’s inten-
tions. Surely some embellishment took place, as evidenced in works such as a 
fragmentary red-figure cup at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Attributed to 
the Antiphon Painter and made around 480 b.c.e., the vessel depicts a painter 
working on a kylix in his workshop (Plate 27.1).15 One notices some important 
features in this depiction, including the way in which the painter holds the ves-
sel, which rests gently on his knees as he leans forward to complete his task. At 
first glance, this would seem like a logical way to work, as it provides for greater 
control of movement—with the arms pinned to the side, there is less room for 
error. Ceramicists often refer to this as anchoring. It allows the painter to work 
on rounded surfaces that would otherwise be extremely difficult to maneuver 
if the vase were placed directly on a flat bench or table.
However, there are problems with this depiction. Detail would have to be 
rendered up close, and so the painter would surely need to reposition the ves-
sel frequently. Likewise, painting inside the cup would prove difficult without 
the support of a table. The foot itself raises another issue. The craftsman is 
working in the leather hard phase, so the foot could easily have broken off if 
he were to work in this fashion, as it would have been made separately and at-
tached to the thrown body of the vessel.16 The handles would also have been 
fragile at this stage, and the very integrity of the form can be compromised by 
overhandling. Placing the object between the knees would certainly increase 
these risks. Therefore, it is not completely clear whether the image conveys an 
accurate account of the process.
Of similar concern are the objects that the painter in the illustration em-
ploys in his work. It would seem that he uses a paintbrush and what is believed 
by some scholars to be a relief tool simultaneously,17 rather than at separate 
stages—indicating a sort of holistic mastery of his craft. His pinky finger juts 
out, as if to balance his hand during the execution of the decoration. However, 
if one of the tools were not in use, as the depiction suggests, there would be no 
need to keep it in hand, and it would likely have been placed aside. Instead, the

Antiphon Painter apparently wants to communicate that his craftsman has the 
ability to work with multiple tools. As depicted, the painter sits upon a diph-
ros, a common stool found in the home and workplace, as well as in the visual 
language of mythological figures.18 It is likely that a painter would have sat on 
such a stool while in the workshop. Yet some very obvious embellishments ex-
ist in tandem. According to Warren Moon, the artist wears his himation loose 
and long, draped around his waist in the style of an aristocrat rather than a la-
borer, who would have worn his garment tight and short for practical reasons.19
In the interior of another red-figure kylix in the British Museum, one finds 
the image of a carpenter at work (Plate 27.2).20 The figure wears a chlamys, 
and a red wreath adorns his hair. In his right hand he holds a long-handled 
adze, known as a skeparnon, while he works a plank of wood placed between 
his knees, braced with his left hand. His tool is constructed of a metal head at-
tached to a handle with a cord lashing, probably made of leather or rope. The 
cord wraps over the blade five times before crossing over the handle. Despite 
this level of detail, the adze seems unnecessary, as it appears to have already 
completed the task. A short piece of wood extends out from the plank at a 
right angle, with a mortise apparently indicated. The painter’s attention to the 
specifics of the practice, including the joinery and tools, suggests some level 
of awareness of woodworking techniques, yet the decision to include the adze 
indicates that the artist may have taken liberties in the rendering of everyday 
experience.
As with the vases discussed above, it is unclear exactly what type of work 
is depicted on the Caltagirone Krater.21 In this image, a nude potter reaches 
with his right hand inside a large vessel, which his nude assistant turns on the 
wheel. Gisela Richter suggests in a letter to John Beazley that the craftsman is 
examining the piece in order to re-center it before putting on the final touch-
es.22 However, considering the size of the object, he would likely need two 
hands in order to center it at all. If he is examining the vase, he is doing only 
that, though he could accomplish this step with a hand placed on the outside, 
rather than within. Surely a painter, at least in some sense, would have been 
aware of the process of forming a vessel, which makes one wonder why any 
discrepancies exist at all.

Some of these choices are clearly deliberate. The painter on the Boston cup 
dresses and equips himself like someone of a loftier rank (Plate 27.1). He sur-
rounds himself with status symbols: the walking stick of wealthy male citizens, 
and the strigil (scraper), sponge, and aryballos—items of personal hygiene as-
sociated with the palaestra.23 It is as if, after representing these objects so often 
in his depictions of young athletes, the Antiphon Painter has decided to repre-
sent his colleagues in the same light—wealthy, athletic, and noble.
One can infer a sense of political self-importance in some examples. On 
a red-figure cup in Copenhagen, Epiktetos painted the image of a carver, a 
stoneworker or woodworker, fashioning a herm positioned between his knees 
(Plate 27.3).24 Hipparchus ordered the construction of herms in the sixth cen-
tury b.c.e.,25 and with these works stationed along the roads of Attica, citizens 
and non-citizens were reminded of the power of Peisistratid rule.26 In order to 
establish a connection to political circumstance, the painter inscribed “Hip-
parchus kalos” above the head of the carver. According to Bodil Rasmussen, 
this image may also reference the assassination of Hipparchus, brother of the 
tyrant Hippias, in 514 b.c.e. at the hands of Harmodios and Aristogeiton, so 
that the artist simultaneously celebrates his life while honoring his death.27 
However, in doing so, he places the craftsman at the center of Athenian affairs.
Certainly, ancient sources attest to a certain degree of self-importance 
among craftsmen. At one point in his Natural History, Pliny the Elder relates 
a story in which several sculptors enter into a contest to determine who was 
most capable of rendering an Amazon in bronze. It was determined that “the 
best one should be selected by the vote of the artists themselves who were 
present; and it then became evident that the best was the one which all the 
artists judged to be the next best after their own.”28 Clearly, Pliny understood 
the concept of artistic pride.
However, some sources imply that craftsmen were considered particularly 
low in status. There are the opinions of Xenophon, Plato, and Aristotle men-
tioned earlier in this discussion, as well as the historical reality. In Sparta, citi-
zens were prohibited from manual labor under the Lycurgan system. Similarly, 
under the laws of Thebes, anyone who had sold or traded goods in the agora 
during the prior ten years could not be considered a citizen—this affected any

craftsman who sold his merchandise at the market.29 Herodotus seems to im-
ply that there was a wide range of approval (and disapproval) of craftsmen 
across the Greek world, with places like Athens and Corinth fostering more 
favorable environments for workshops.30 Would the knowledge of disfavor 
elsewhere increase the desire to prove pride of place within one’s own polis? It 
seems possible that these varying levels of approval influenced how craftsmen 
represented themselves, though this theory is difficult to verify.
In any case, it would be risky to describe the images on the Boston fragment, 
the Copenhagen cup, and other depictions of craftsmen on vases as portrai-
ture. Inscriptions are often absent, so that individual workers cannot be as-
signed names. In the solitary case where a painter has labeled a depiction of 
himself on a vase, it is not an image in which he practices his craft. Instead, 
the painter, Smikros, places himself within a symposium setting (Plate 27.4).31 
It is thought to be unlikely that Smikros would have actually participated in 
such a high-society event. On the contrary, one can imagine the artist engaging 
in a kind of visualized fantasy: he is rendered as young, handsome, and rich. 
While it is often said that this case presents “the only incontrovertible self-
portrait in Greek vase painting,”32 one must question how far the concept of 
a “self-­portrait” extends. In keeping with the fantasy that Smikros presumably 
indulges in by including himself in a symposium, he would likely have depict-
ed himself in an idealized manner. One can call this a self-portrait only in that 
it is meant to convey an image of the individual responsible for its creation.
A similar trope is explored by Smikros in the depiction of a figure, seemingly 
identified as Euphronios, involved in a romantic encounter with the wealthy 
and esteemed Leagros—perhaps alluding to Euphronios’s repeated invoca-
tion on his own pottery of the love-name Leagros (kalos) in reference to the 
young aristocrat.33 The same problem of definition arises when one questions 
whether this representation of Euphronios is a true portrait—as with the im-
age of Smikros, one cannot be certain of its accuracy. Accordingly, such images 
complicate the issue of the patron’s role in determining the subjects chosen

by vase-painters. It seems that some images exist simply for the painter’s own 
enjoyment.
This inquiry is particularly pertinent when one considers representations 
of women workers on Greek vessels, as men would likely have commissioned 
them. Like the depiction of the craftsman on the cup in Boston by the An-
tiphon Painter, the images on the so-called Caputi Hydria by the Leningrad 
Painter from the Intesa Sanpaolo Collection in Vicenza pose similar issues of 
interpretation.34 The painter has rendered a workshop scene in which four fig-
ures engage in the decoration of vessels. On the left, a nude figure sits upon a 
diphros while he paints a volute krater. He turns to look at a winged deity, who 
stands behind him as she places a wreath upon his head. To the right, a larger 
figure sits upon a klismos, cloaked in a himation, decorating a kantharos. A 
table positioned beside his legs supports a small cup that may contain slip. 
Another female deity approaches the second painter with a wreath. She wears 
an aegis and Attic helmet, indicating that she is meant to represent Athena. 
Between these two figures, a pitcher rests within a second kantharos. To the 
right, a third vase painter sits upon a diphros, cloaked in a chlamys, working on 
a column krater as a winged deity crowns him. The last figure at the far right 
is female (Plate 27.5). She sits on a stool placed atop a platform, and decorates 
a volute krater. This puzzling mix of male and female painters taking part in 
workshop activities challenges the traditional conception of vase painting as 
a strictly male craft.35
In the sixth century b.c.e., Solon established a set of guidelines concerning 
the actions and behavior of women. Common experiences such as walking, 
dining, and mourning had proper and acceptable protocols.36 As Sarah Pome-
roy notes, Athens presents an example of a highly privileged society in which 
an enormous gulf existed between the lifestyles of men and women.37 Gender 
division is evident in the spaces that individuals were permitted to occupy, 
and, in turn, how these spaces were represented in art. When it is referred to in 
literature, women’s work in Classical Athens is often only thought of in terms 
of spinning and weaving.38 A young bride was expected to bring a collection 
of textiles to contribute to the wealth of her new household. In the case of 
economic hardship, a family could sell stored-up fabrics.39 ­Archaeological

­evidence suggests that textiles could be produced on a large scale. In house 
aviii 7/9 at Olynthus, the excavators discovered 297 loom weights, which rep-
resent between seven and fifteen looms.40 Such a substantial number would 
indicate production beyond the needs of one household. A lekythos by the 
Amasis Painter in the Metropolitan Museum of Art evokes the environment 
surrounding the archaeological record. In this depiction, women engage in 
various textile-related roles such as folding, weaving, and spinning.41 Two 
women stand over a basket, spinning wool between their fingers. At an upright 
loom, threads hang down as figures extend their arms to weave. One pair holds 
a textile between them, folding the completed work.
In most cases, images of women weaving and working wool were direct-
ly linked to the Greek idea of feminine virtue. A good wife was also a skilled 
weaver, as demonstrated in the Odyssey by the character of Penelope, wife of 
Odysseus, who spends her days weaving in order to hold off her numerous suit-
ors as she awaits her husband’s return.42 As Antinous says to Telemachus in 
regard both to her skills as a weaver and the cunning with which she executes 
her plot: “she is so dowered with the wisdom bestowed by Athene, to be expert 
in beautiful work, to have good character and cleverness, such as we are not 
told of, even of the ancient queens.”43 She is not only faithful, but also intel-
ligent and skilled. Antinous’s comment recalls the Caputi Hydria’s portrayal of 
the woman in the workshop, in which she appears alongside her male coun-
terparts—both the Homeric passage and the decoration on the vessel depict 
a woman as a capable craftsperson. However, weaving was clearly “women’s 
work,” while the making of pottery was generally the occupation of men.
Other references suggest that women might experience some kind of es-
tablished working environment outside the home. While the Caputi Hydria is 
unique in its depiction of a female vase painter, other vases represent female 
merchants, such as a vendor scene on a black-figure pelike in the ­Louvre.44 
Gerhard Zimmer speculated that the image on a Corinthian plaque from 
Berlin is, in fact, a woman wedging clay.45 Likewise, Helen McClees argues 
through an examination of epigraphic evidence that women midwives and

nurses could also contribute to their household income.46 The female artisan 
on the Caputi Hydria (Plate 27.5) is shown on a platform, an element that, ac-
cording to Marjorie Venit, “raises her above the other craftsmen, setting her 
off from her colleagues.”47 Context is also central to the interpretation of the 
vase—after all, it was found in a woman’s grave in Ruvo.48 One has to wonder 
if the deceased had some personal connection to the imagery. The inclusion 
of a woman suggests that the idea of a female painter in Athens would not 
have been regarded as a total novelty.49 Perhaps what is shown here is a family 
workshop, in which each member participates in production.
There is evidence to suggest that family workshops did operate in Archaic 
and Classical Athens. In rare cases, a craftsman will refer to his lineage as a 
mark of distinction by naming his father in a signature inscription. Proclaim-
ing himself the “son of Polios” on the famous vase in Munich, Euthymides 
perhaps announces to his audience that he is a citizen of Athens, as one’s 
status depended on lineage.50 Some scholars have suggested a connection to 
the Athenian sculptor Pollias, whose name appears chiseled on several bases 
from the acropolis.51 Pollias is further identified by Pliny as an artisan of votive 
works.52 If Euthymides is indeed referring to this sculptor, he is establishing 
himself within an artistic tradition, validating his ability and boasting of his 
direct connection to a respected craftsman. A fragmentary vessel where the 
potter Kleophrades lists himself as the son of “Amas”—with the last letters of 
the name lost—also may evoke this idea. It is possible that Kleophrades was 
in fact the son of the potter Amasis,53 in which case he may have hoped to at-
tract business through his father’s prestige. While recognizing the danger of 
reading too much into these connections, and assuming that the name of an 
artisan from an earlier generation would actually have been known by later 
patrons, one may perhaps see the Caputi Hydria as an attempt at achieving 
the same goal of indicating, and capitalizing on, a working lineage through the 
depiction of a family-operated business. In this way, an unfamiliar patron can 
become acquainted with the artist and the workshop.

Voicing the Past
Of course, it is often difficult to discern any kind of relationship between 
craftsmen based solely on visual evidence. A set of images on a black-figure 
amphora from Orvieto in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (Plate  27.6), 
shows a leatherworking scene on one side (left) and a metalworking scene on 
the other (right).54 In the leatherworking image, two shoemakers in himations 
are seated on diphroi to either side of a woman who stands atop a table. A ba-
sin and a sandal are under the table, and to the far right stands a draped man 
with a staff. He appears to be directing the cobblers, and is perhaps the escort 
of the female patron. Pincers and an awl sit on a shelf at the left, and a sponge, 
a vessel, shoes, and pieces of leather hang on the wall. On the other side of 
the vase, nude blacksmiths stand with tongs and a hammer at an anvil. Two 
draped men seated at the right are perhaps overseeing the labor. Tongs, ham-
mers, a saw, a bow drill, and an oinochoe are suspended on the wall. The poses 
of the artisans at the left in each scene are similar: both lean forward with the 
left arm extended. On both sides of the amphora, instruments hang along the 
upper perimeter. In this way, the painter creates a link between the crafts by 
relating their environments. However, the two groups are perhaps not equal in 
status. The blacksmiths work nude under the direction of others, and their task 
is physically demanding. In comparison, the cobblers are clothed in an aristo-
cratic manner, they sit while they work, and they deal only with the patrons.
Important to note is the fact that in none of the images discussed so far does 
one see painters and potters working in proximity, and this in itself may indi-
cate something about workshop organization. Only one image exists showing 
both types of craftsmen together,55 and that is on a fragment of a calyx krater 
from the Acropolis attributed to the Painter of the Louvre Centauromachy.56 
The potter is shown working at a wheel on the right, while the painter sits di-
rectly to his left, decorating a large column krater, which also happens to be the 
favored shape of the Painter of the Louvre Centauromachy.57 Both craftsmen 
face the same direction (to the right) and both are at least partially clothed—
though it is difficult to tell to what degree, as much of the painter’s upper half 
is missing. Certainly, he is dressed more extravagantly than his potter coun-
terpart. Folds of fabric wrap closely around his legs, while the potter wears 
only a simple, short tunic or chlamys that leaves most of his form exposed. If 
costume is indicative of workshop hierarchy, then the image on this fragment

argues against the concept that the painter was somehow subservient to the 
potter. It may be that these relationships were not as firmly fixed as scholars 
have suggested.58
One cannot exclude the possibility that the Painter of the Louvre Centauro-
machy was merely exploring an ideal situation rather than a reality, since it is 
the painter who is responsible for the rendering of this image and not the pot-
ter. Painters were sometimes also potters, so perhaps this scene shows separate 
manifestations of a single craftsman at various stages in the process—though 
the different attire of the artisans argues against this theory. This scene is also 
unique in its apparent representation of the potter at the very early stages  
of production: it looks as though the unformed clay sits atop the wheel, not 
yet shaped by the hands of the artisan.59 The image almost seems to show 
“coning-up”—a term that describes both the technique for centering and the 
step before the potter “opens-up” the form to create a hollow space within. 
Embedding the scene with a kind of veracity, the Painter of the Louvre Cen-
tauromachy evidently knew something of the process himself, either by work-
ing directly with potters, as represented in this image, or by handling the clay 
himself at some point during his career.
There are some scenes in which one would expect to see both painter and 
potter, but does not. Take for example the scene on the obverse of a krater of 
around 430 b.c.e. by the Komaris Painter in the Ashmolean Museum, which 
represents a painter working on a vessel while two other figures move addi-
tional kraters toward the right side of the scene (Plate 27.7).60 These standing 
figures are cloaked in chlamydes, which according to Axel Seeberg is unusual 
when one considers that this garment type is more suited to travelers and war-
riors than artisans.61 The chlamys is, however, represented in two other im-
ages—one of a potter on the aforementioned Acropolis krater fragments, and 
another on the Caputi Hydria, so that it is not certain whether this attire was 
truly atypical in workshop scenes.
Beazley points out that the standing figures carry their kraters by the han-
dles, suggesting that these were finished, fired products rather than objects 
58	
Zamir, “Signing, As Ever Euphronios.” The assumption that potters ranked higher than 
painters is based on the overall prevalence of potters’ signatures in comparison to paint-
ers’ signatures. I suggest that the word “epoiesen” may have had multiple meanings, such 
that it could be applied either to potters, workshop owners, or both. Such multiple defini-
tions for “epoiesen” could account for its being used more frequently than “egrapsen.” The 
prevalence of “potter” inscriptions over painter inscriptions need not signify higher rank.

in the leather hard stage.62 He goes on to propose that the figures attend to 
different tasks, perhaps at different times.63 While Seeberg believes this to be 
a scene in which a painter works while customers leave with their commis-
sioned goods, there is little interaction between the standing “customers” and 
the seated painter. The painter looks down, focused on his work, wholly ig-
noring the action around him. Seeberg assumes that customers would have 
entered the workshop directly to acquire vessels, rather than purchasing them 
from an intermediary in a market setting. In his reference to Beazley’s recog-
nition of the impossibility of carrying a vessel by the handles when leather 
hard, he neglects to consider the painter’s own precarious handling of the large 
krater perched on his lap. If one is to assume that the craftsman works with an 
unfired pot while handling it in an unrealistic manner, then perhaps the Kom-
aris Painter also rendered the handling of the other vessels incorrectly.
This is not to say that Beazley’s assessment is incorrect and that the standing 
figures carry unfired pots, but rather to emphasize that the image is perhaps 
not a realistic representation of an actual event. As discussed earlier, interpre-
tations based solely on the assumption of the veracity of the depiction are en-
tirely problematic. What seems more likely is that these figures represent the 
merchants responsible for the sale of the vessels in the market, depicted in the 
midst of removing products from the workshop. This interpretation accounts 
for the supposed odd manner of dress: the artist is perhaps evoking Hermes, 
the god of not only travelers, but of measurements, invention, and, most im-
portantly in this instance, of commerce.64 Hermes is often represented cloaked 
in the chlamys.65 The two figures may even be traveling merchants who plan 
to transport these objects abroad, so that the traveler’s garb is appropriate on 
more than one level. Either way, the painter uses this detail to indicate to the 
viewer the action taking place, perhaps suggesting that the business is running 
smoothly and that his pots are faring well in the marketplace. According to 
this interpretation, one might conclude that this scene is yet another instance 
of visual boasting, as with the representations of painters in aristocratic garb. 
In addition, one is reminded of the importance of commercial activity to the 
survival of the workshop, as noted at the beginning of this paper in relation to 
the poem from the Life of Homer. It is essential that the vessels “fetch the price 
asked, many being sold in the marketplace and many on the roads, and bring 
in much money.” If one is to believe that the merchants in this scene deal with

the painter directly, and that the potter is entirely absent from the interaction, 
then this image might argue that the painter had a greater role in the distri-
bution of vessels than previously assumed—or that the potter, painter, and 
workshop owner were one and the same.
As Beazley points out, some scholars have even argued that in a workshop 
a painter was not responsible for the design of the decoration, but only given 
a template by the potter to execute on the surface of the vase.66 Such an ar-
rangement would indicate that the potter, and not the painter, chose images 
of craftsmen. This template theory would also seem to explain the greater in-
cidence of potters’ signatures on vases. However, if this were the case, there 
should be a greater continuity among motifs and images with corresponding 
epoiesen signatures.67 Moreover, “false starts” and other corrections in execu-
tion indicate that at least in some cases the painter was grappling with form 
and placement, further suggesting that the design had not been completely 
worked out ahead of time.68 Therefore, the painters’ choice to depict the ac-
tions of potters suggests a working relationship, rather than some assumed 
dependence on the potters’ designs. The painters’ or patrons’ interest in these 
subjects likely dictated their manufacture.
A great variety of details relating to the organization of a potter’s workshop 
is represented on the shoulder of a hydria by a painter of the Leagros Group in 
Munich, dated to the late sixth century b.c.e. (Plate 27.8).69 At the left of the 
scene, a potter is seated on a stool with an amphora. To the right, another pot-
ter stands as he shapes a vessel, while an assistant, seated on a block, turns the 
wheel. Behind the assistant, another man carries a vessel by its base toward a 
cloaked figure with a staff. Further along, a man carries a vessel on his back as 
he approaches the kiln, which is decorated with a mask and tended by a work-
er at the far right. The Munich example shows a more “industrial” setting than 
the one exhibited on the Caputi Hydria. Callipers, used to measure the propor-
tions of the vessels, hang above the head of the boy who operates the wheel.70 
This detail demonstrates that the painter of the scene, at least in some sense, 
wishes to depict an actual workshop setting, perhaps himself having worked 
within a similar space or with the tools of the potter. Also indicated here is a 
differentiation of vessel types. An amphora, worked by the figure at the left

of the scene, is a shape often found elaborated by decoration. The ­remaining 
pieces, however, would not have been painted—as pithoi, they served as utili-
tarian storage containers.71 This combination of painted and unpainted house-
hold vessels suggests the strong likelihood that pottery workshops produced a 
range of types and shapes.72 The presence of pithoi in this scene might further 
indicate that the painter had worked in, or was familiar with, a pottery work-
shop that made such vessels.
A hierarchy is created through the presence of nudity on the Munich hydria. 
The potter who works on the amphora is shown clothed from the waist down. 
The image of the craftsman at the wheel is only fragmentary, and it is unclear 
what he is wearing. However, the assistant who rotates the wheel, as well as 
the muscular figures who carry the vessels and tend to the kiln, are represented 
entirely nude—perhaps indicating that their status within the workshop was 
lower than that of the clothed man. The central figure, who neither works at 
the wheel nor performs any of the typical workshop tasks, wears a himation 
and holds his aristocratic walking stick in hand, “a goodly sceptre-like staff” as 
Beazley describes it, observing the action unfolding around him.73 He is likely 
the workshop owner, or perhaps some sort of overseer, who is in charge of the 
other figures in the scene.74 This distinction in rank was clearly important to 
the painter of the Munich hydria, and one wonders whether the hierarchy was 
believed essential for the workshop’s success. The mask hanging on the kiln 
acts as a kind of apotropaic emblem, indicating a fear of firing problems and 
the attempt to ward them off. Similar masks are shown, sometimes attached to 
a tree or a pole, in scenes of Dionysian festivals.75
One is reminded of the poem cited at the beginning of this paper, in which 
the “ravagers of kilns” pose the greatest threat to the craftsman’s success. Thus, 
the inclusion of protective images in a workshop is not surprising. A prime 
example is the scene on the exterior of the Foundry Cup by the so-called 
Foundry Painter in Berlin, which illustrates the activities of metalworkers as 
they produce several large statues (Plate 27.9).76 Votives hang by the furnace, 
perhaps serving the same protective purpose as the apotropaic kiln mask of 
the ­Munich hydria scene. Along the walls appear various tools, most of which

can be identified with certainty.77 Two nude workers tend the furnace while a 
third appears to watch their activities. The inclusion of joinery lines along the 
wrists of the partially assembled statue at the right, as well as the remaining 
pieces of anatomy not yet attached, suggest that the painter was familiar with 
how these statues were made, rather than simply drawing upon some unin-
formed assumption.78 This could indicate that there was enough interaction to 
form a basis of understanding for the painter to rely upon, though the level of 
detail on the Foundry Cup is tempered by the less accurate renderings of other 
vase painters. The Lysippides Painter exposes his lack of understanding when 
it comes to wood joinery on a bilingual vase in Munich, while the Andokides 
Painter, responsible for the red-figure scene on the opposite side, clearly has a 
comprehensive knowledge of furniture manufacture.79
As in pottery workshops, some division of labor took place in the metal-
working industry, with certain aspects of production becoming increasingly 
isolated by the late Archaic and early Classical periods. Michail Treister points 
out that in the Odyssey, Hephaestus is a smith, an armorer, and a toreut (the 
craftsman responsible for the relief or intaglio design in metal). It seems that 
specialization began sometime before the Classical period, when new words 
describing separate types of metal production appear in the written record. 
Just as it was possible for a painter to turn to potting, as occurred with Euph-
ronios, it was also possible for a smith to switch between bronze foundering, 
armor manufacture, and toreutics. In one instance, the name of Telesstas is 
inscribed on a sixth century b.c.e. bronze hydria, and the same name is ref-
erenced by Pausanias in connection with the manufacture of a bronze statue 
of Zeus dedicated at Olympia, suggesting that the same artist may have made 
both works.80 Division of labor seems to coincide with the development of 
what may be termed mass production, which relied on the use and reuse of 
77	
Mattusch, Greek Bronze Statuary, 105. It is not entirely clear what the pair of feet would 
have been used for. While it is possible that this image represents parts that have been 
cast separately, it appears that each statue already has feet and hands attached. Instead, 
these may represent models employed in the indirect lost-wax casting process, once be-
lieved to have developed in the fourth century b.c.e. This assumption was based on a pas-
sage by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where he claims that Lysistratos developed a 
method for taking plaster casts from human models. However, the scene on the Foundry 
Cup suggests that indirect casting was in use in the fifth century, and that the Foundry 
Painter was highly attuned to the latest technologies available beyond those of his own 
profession.

piece molds. In the Foundry Cup scene, the presence of the hanging feet may 
indicate an early stage in this practice. P.C. Bol speculates whether metalwork-
ers of various specializations may have settled into a single community, as was 
the case with ceramicists in Athens.81 A communal living environment could 
have facilitated the movement of tools, models, and motifs between crafts-
men. Such interaction could have occurred across disciplines as well. Potters 
required metal and stone tools, and metal smiths relied on ceramic vessels for 
storage of materials.
As with potters, the need for protection against the “ravagers of the kiln” 
is essential to metalworkers, as suggested by the image on the interior of the 
Foundry Cup (Plate 27.10). The artist depicts a scene from the workshop of 
Hephaestus, who hands a helmet to Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Carol Mat-
tusch, in discussing the Foundry Cup, describes the dress of Hephaestus as “a 
loose tunic of fairly heavy material,” and goes on to suggest that “perhaps this is 
a protective garment similar to, though shorter than, the leather aprons worn 
by modern blacksmiths.”82 Whether or not this comparison is apt, one has to 
appreciate that the painter went to the trouble of depicting the garb of the 
trade at all, considering that painters did not seem to show clothing realisti-
cally in potter and painter representations. The exterior decoration displays 
a variety of nude, semi-nude, and extravagantly draped figures. This choice of 
garments not only conflicts with the reality of metal workshops, but also with 
the image of Hephaestus, who is far from majestically dressed. What is the 
significance of the painter’s choice to clothe the god in a “blacksmith’s apron” 
while presenting the actual blacksmiths as athletes and aristocrats? Compari-
sons with other images of Hephaestus at work do not yield definitive answers, 
as the choice of clothing varies widely. Perhaps turning everyday activities 
into heroic endeavors, and shifting the mythological into something common-
place, may have simply provided the patron with an entertaining drinking cup 
for a symposium. Or, by aligning the craftsmen with Hephaestus, the painter 
or patron might have been seeking divine favor or protection from the god 
against the evils that could befall any such worker. On the exterior, the painter 
has depicted two standing figures that appear to be directing the work. Their 
role must be similar to that of the heavily draped supervisor on the Munich 
hydria. They, too, are delineated by extravagant dress. It is perhaps essential, 
then, for the god to appear as a blacksmith to establish a link to, and thus en-
noble, the activities of the foundry workers, who are then elevated further by 
their elaborate garments.

Sian Lewis contends that workshop scenes featuring deities should not be 
taken as strict interpretations of everyday life with references to the divine 
merely incidental; rather, Lewis asserts, these scenes represent activities be-
yond the scope of tangible experience.83 However, it is also likely that the 
painter drew on various aspects of his experience—the workshop was a famil-
iar setting, and mythology was familiar subject matter. The last painted image 
relevant to this discussion is a depiction of Athena herself, modeling a horse in 
either clay or wax, on an early Classical oinochoe in Berlin.84 Tools hang about 
her as she works, indicating some divine workshop comparable to that of Hep-
haestus on the interior of the Foundry Cup. Here the painter appears to link 
the art of representation and the divine cultivation of image making—as the 
poem intones, “If you will pay me for my song, O potters, then come, Athena, 
and hold thy hand above the kiln!” Much like the painters on the Caputi Hydria 
crowned by deities, the goddess’s presence here suggests a certain nobility of 
the trade, as is the case with the inclusion of aristocratic and heroic associa-
tions in images of craftsmen.
Whether on vessels or elsewhere, the question remains as to why these im-
ages of craftsmen appear at all. Seeberg comments that “no subject could be 
more humdrum … When it does occur, one might expect it to be enlivened by 
a touch of wish-fulfillment, or at least of the unusual.”85 In fact, this tendency 
toward wish-fulfillment does seem to occur in nearly every example explored 
in this paper. The fact that painters were selective in the types of crafts they 
chose to represent on vases is also significant. As already mentioned, images 
of textile workers, metalworkers, and ceramicists far outweigh those of other 
crafts on extant vases. There is just one stonemason, and no tanners, dyers, 
goldsmiths, silversmiths, jewelry makers, or musical-instrument makers rep-
resented by Attic vase painters.86 There is no evidence to suggest that painters 
would have had less contact with these professions than any other craft. On 
the contrary, goldsmiths, tanners, and luthiers are singled out amongst black-
smiths, leatherworkers, and potters as representative craftsmen in ­Lysistrata, 
the fifth century b.c.e. comedy by Aristophanes.87 It is not as if painters 
would have forgotten to include these sister arts on their vessels. Rather, the 
choice to exclude them may suggest that images of craftsmen were more than

just ­representations of everyday experience, and that perhaps specific crafts 
carried meaning. Much as textile work surely relates to a woman’s contribu-
tion to the home, and the image of a carver fashioning a herm may relate to 
­Hipparchus, perhaps all craft-referential pottery had some significance to art-
ist or patron, or both. One is reminded of the image of a female vase painter 
on the Caputi Hydria (Plate 27.5), found in a woman’s grave in Ruvo, perhaps 
relating to the deceased’s role within a family business during her lifetime. 
Likewise, the image of a craftsman in aristocratic garb on a fragment by the 
Antiphon Painter (Plate 27.1), surrounded by objects of the palaestra, may be 
the result of the artist’s desire to ennoble the activities of his trade.
In the early history of image making, those responsible for artistic creation 
have remained largely anonymous and obscure. By the time of the Greek 
Archaic period, artists begin to depict themselves and their colleagues, and 
scenes on Attic vases show craftsmen working with the tools and materials 
of their trades. The artist’s depiction of himself as an individual within the 
context of the workshop extends beyond the surface of the vase into his wider 
world: the craftsman reveals not only his immediate environment, but also his 
identity within the larger tradition of the arts of his time, as well as his interests 
and aspirations. The images on craft-referential pottery, enlivened by the poem 
from the Life of Homer, provide a glimpse of the banauson within his sociopo-
litical context, his interaction with other artisans and his relation to the public, 
his potential for success and his very tangible fear of failure. The craftsman is 
not strictly a product of his patrons, nor is he removed from his environment, 
and while the kotyloi and kanastra “turn a good black,” the painter gives voice 
to an otherwise unknown condition.

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair: Early Sources and 
Avenues of Diffusion
Ana Gutierrez-Folch
The rediscovery of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other ancient Greco-Roman 
sites during the early 18th century was a cultural milestone that introduced 
the artistic production of antiquity to the modern European stage. The neo-
classical taste arose from a profound scholarly and aesthetic interest in these 
finds, inspiring artists, designers, and tastemakers throughout Europe to create 
a new visual paradigm that incorporated elements from ancient works. The 
Grand Tour became a prevalent rite of passage for affluent young gentlemen 
from England and the Continent looking to experience the cultural legacy of 
antiquity through extended journeys through Rome, Naples, Florence, and 
Venice. Alongside their exploration of ancient monuments, temples, and 
tombs, Grand Tourists were also exposed to a wealth of ancient Greco-Roman 
artifacts housed in museums and private collections throughout Italy. The an-
cient sculptures and pictorial representations they encountered during these 
voyages, together with the abundant reproductions and small-scale souvenirs 
they amassed, became direct sources for the rediscovery of ancient furniture 
forms and their incorporation into the 18th-century visual vocabulary.1
The klismos chair, a quintessentially Greek construction, is a clear example of 
this process of rediscovery and adaptation. Revisited in the late 18th century by 
cabinetmakers such as Georges Jacob (1739–1814), Bernard Molitor (1755–1833), 
and Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard (1743–1809), the klismos chair made a con-
spicuous reappearance in fashionable European salons by the 1780s and 1790s. 
The pictorial evidence from ancient vase paintings, reliefs, and sculptures avail-
able in the 18th century provided a reasonably accurate ­understanding of the 
appearance and construction of this ancient form, ­allowing modern ­craftsmen

and designers to reproduce it as a fashionably “antique” chair. Notwithstand-
ing the popularity that the form achieved, no research to date has specifically 
attempted to recount the course of the klismos from ancient Greece to 18th-
century Europe. A deeper understanding of the historical origins of the neo-
classical klismos will shed light on some essential sources for “archaeological” 
furniture in the late 18th century, highlighting the impact of ancient works and 
their reproductions on the taste of the period.
	
The Ancient Greek Klismos Chair
The klismos chair is perhaps the most characteristic ancient Greek furniture 
form known today.2 Like most Greek furniture, klismoi were constructed pri-
marily from wood, which rarely survives from antiquity.3 Evidence from vase 
paintings, tomb reliefs, and sculptures suggests that the form was in common 
use during the Archaic and Classical periods, primarily in domestic contexts. 
Etymologically, the Greek root κλι—(from κλινείν, to lean or recline) is com-
mon both to the words klismos and kline or “couch,” apparently referencing the 
potential for easy reclining.4 The curve of the klismos back conformed to the 
sitter’s body, providing an ergonomic surface designed for comfort.
According to Gisela Richter, the klismos lacked surface decoration, deriving 
its beauty from line and proportion rather than ornament.5 The curved back 
and flaring legs of the klismos were common to all examples, but not stan-
dardized. Countless variations in proportion and silhouette could be achieved 
through modification of the curvature of the back and legs, and adjustment of 
the angle and positioning of the backboard, providing each klismos with an in-
dividualized character.6 The klismos chair was a uniquely Greek construction, 
lacking earlier Egyptian or Near Eastern prototypes.
The klismos form evolved significantly throughout the Greek Archaic, Clas-

anaklisis, klisia, or klinter) in antiquity, although the klismos per se is not described specifi-
cally in ancient Greek literary sources. Richter and other scholars have used the term klismos 
to denote the Greek “easy chair” with “curved back and plain, curved legs,” such as is recog-
nizable in representations in ancient Greek art. Richter, Furniture of the Greeks, Etruscans, 
and Romans, 33–37.

experimental stage, not yet fully harmonious in its proportion and form.7 It 
was not uncommon for the backrests of Archaic klismoi to terminate in finials, 
either plain or shaped like swan’s heads or palmettes.8 During the 5th century 
b.c., the klismos chair evolved into its ideal silhouette—the ornamental finials 
had become obsolete, and a balanced relationship was attained between the 
heights of the legs and back, which merged into a continuous curve (Plate 28.1).
The basics of the construction of the klismos chair appear to remain 
­consistent throughout its ancient production.9 The frame of the klismos was 
assembled using mortise-and-tenon joinery, with through tenons often de-
picted protruding at the back of the seat. The legs curved out toward the front 
and back, tapering sharply toward the feet and projecting well beyond the 
seat frame. This characteristic “spread” of the klismos legs was motivated by 
functionality as much as aesthetics, as the curvature and extension of the legs 
provided additional stability on uneven ground.10 Three uprights—a broad 
plank with narrow stiles on either side—supported the backboard. In some 
cases, the stiles flanking the central plank seem to have been crafted as one 
piece with the rear legs, creating the continuous curve so characteristic of the 
klismos form.11 The seat of the klismos chair was generally plaited, with cush-
ions and other textiles added over the woven surface for additional comfort. 
Judging from depictions of the klismos being carried, the chair appears to have 
been remarkably light, a feature that added to its versatility (Plate 28.2).
During the Hellenistic period, the klismos evolved into a heavier variation, 
constructed with a certain sturdiness that altered the precisely drawn rela-
tionship between its lines and curves. It was this later version of the klismos 
chair that was most often appropriated by Roman artists for their furniture 
­production and represented in Roman copies and adaptations of ancient 
Greek sculpture.12

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
	
Ancient Sculptural Sources for the Klismos Form in Italy
During the 18th century, several European museums and collections displaying 
Greco-Roman antiquities were open to visitors as sources for the appreciation 
and enjoyment of classical antiquity. Due to the limitations on international 
travel, only certain destinations were truly accessible for western European 
travelers, regardless of their wealth or status. Because of the difficulty of the 
voyage, it was rare for 18th-century enthusiasts to venture into Greece, where 
they might have encountered numerous depictions of the klismos. Neverthe-
less, a significant number of ancient Greek objects illustrating the klismos 
chair had previously found their way to Italy, beginning in the Archaic period 
and continuing into Roman times. These objects remained in the more acces-
sible Italian territories, albeit often buried in tombs. In addition, Roman repro-
ductions and adaptations of Greek sculpture and metalwork preserved certain 
types and models, the originals of which have been lost.
	
The Capitoline Museum
The Capitoline Museum in Rome displayed Greco-Roman antiquities from a 
very early date. In 1471, Pope Sixtus iv (1471–1484) donated a series of impor-
tant bronze sculptures previously exhibited in the Lateran Palace—apparently 
including the She-Wolf, the Spinario, and the Camillus—to the Conservators 
of Rome, considering these works to be part of the “inalienable heritage” of 
the Roman people.13 From the late 15th century, the Capitoline Hill became 
a repository of antiquity, home to a growing collection of classical sculpture 
displayed publicly in the Palazzo dei Conservatori. The Capitoline Museum, 
established in 1733 under the jurisdiction of Pope Clement xii (1730–1740), was 
an essentially didactic institution, opening to the public in 1734 with the inau-
guration of the Palazzo Nuovo.14
The notion of accessibility was essential to the conception of the Capitoline 
Museum. The Palazzo Nuovo accommodated most of the sculptures that were 
donated to the Palazzo dei Conservatori in 1566 by Pope Pius v (1566–1572), as 
well as pieces purchased from Cardinal Alessandro Albani in 1732 specifically 
for inclusion in the new museum.15 The significance of the Capitoline Museum

19th centuries cannot be overstated—as Jean-Jacques Barthélemy (1716–1795) 
noted in a letter to the Comte de Caylus (1692–1765), the Capitoline Museum 
was “the great book of antiquarians.”16
A seated matron in white Pentelic marble known as the Capitoline Agrip-
pina is among the masterpieces of classical sculpture displayed in the Palazzo 
Nuovo from an early date (Plate 28.3).17 This full-size portrait sculpture has 
been identified as one of the statues given to the Palazzo dei Conservatori by 
Pope Pius v in 1566.18 Dated by scholars to the 2nd century a.d. or later,19 this 
work is considered to be a Roman adaptation of a Classical Greek prototype, 
identified by Margarete Bieber as the “Aphrodite of the Gardens” type.20 The 
survival of several Roman statues of this type suggests that a Greek prototype 
did in fact exist.21 In considering these works, one must account for the pos-
sibility, and in some cases the certainty, that restorations were made to the 
originals.
The klismos chair of the Capitoline Agrippina is precisely depicted, provid-
ing an accurate idea of its appearance and construction. The seated figure rests 
her arm on the chair back, emphasizing the notion of ease inherent in the 
form.22 The seat and legs of this klismos are carved in relief on three faces of the

The identification of this sculpture as Agrippina the Younger was not universally ac-
cepted. In 1891, Wolfgang Helbig identified the sculpture as a portrait statue of Helena, 
mother of Constantine, and dated it to her ascendancy (a.d. 324–329). The seated matron 
in the Capitoline Museum, as well as a similar work in the Uffizi Gallery, are currently 
catalogued according to Helbig’s identification. Helbig, Führer durch die öffentlichen Sam-
mlungen klassischer Alterthümer in Rom, 153–154.

Bieber attributed the original Greek work that inspired the “Aphrodite of the Gardens” 
type to the sculptor Alkamenes, pupil of Pheidias, and noted that such seated sculptures 
portraying aristocratic women were made during the Roman imperial period for hon-
orary and funerary purposes. Bieber states that nine Roman examples of the type are 
known: one in the Museo Torlonia, one in the Villa Albani, two in the Uffizi Gallery, one 
in the Capitoline Museum, one in the Naples Archaeological Museum, and one in Ostia, 
with two headless torsos of the same type in the Verona Archaeological Museum and the 
Museé Rodin in Paris. Bieber, Ancient Copies, 96.

As Bieber points out, the comfortable attitude of the sitter, resting against the chair back 
with her left arm hanging over the backboard, is a traditional pose seen in vase paint-
ings, marble reliefs, and on coins. Bieber, Ancient Copies, 96. As can be determined from 
­examples published both by Bieber and Richter, this posture seems to be connected spe-
cifically with the klismos chair, the form of which facilitated this relaxed position.

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
solid block that supports the body of the sitter. As well as providing an ­anchor 
for the seated figure and a visually appealing foundation for the sculpture as a 
whole, the carved block ensured the survival of the chair’s slender legs, which 
might have broken had they been freestanding. The Capitoline Agrippina pres-
ents a well-proportioned example of the klismos chair, one that could have 
constituted the first instance of the form seen by 18th-century travelers.
The Capitoline Agrippina is now displayed in the center of the Hall of the 
Emperors of the Palazzo Nuovo. Although its original placement in the mu-
seum is uncertain, it was surely well positioned, as the work was famous by 
the middle of the 18th century.23 Winckelmann mentions the Capitoline Agrip-
pina in the first edition of his Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums, issued in 
1763.24 The Comte de Caylus was also aware of its merit, praising it as “le plus 
beau morceau” in the Capitoline collection.25 While it is impossible to ascer-
tain whether this sculpture was indeed the inspiration for the production of 
late 18th-century European klismoi, it can be established that it was available 
for public view from an early date, prominently displayed in one of Rome’s 
most important museums.
	
The Orti Farnesiani
Several other Roman statues of the “Aphrodite of the Gardens” type could be 
seen in Italy during the 18th century. One example is a seated matron dated 
to the 1st century a.d., also said to represent Agrippina (Plate 28.4).26 Now 
housed in the Naples Archaeological Museum, this work was part of the 
­renowned Farnese collection of ancient sculpture.27 The Farnese Agrippina

1764 edition, see Winckelmann, History of the Art of Antiquity, 335.

26	
During the 18th and 19th centuries, various attempts were made to identify the subjects 
that these seated matron sculptures were meant to represent. In the 1720s, both the Capi-
toline and the Farnese examples were associated with the figure of Poppea Sabina, mis-
tress and then wife of the emperor Nero. This identification, however, was not as widely 
accepted as that of Agrippina or, later, Helena (see note 17 above). It is of course possible 
that the various copies or adaptations represented several different Roman historical or 
mythological figures. Haskell and Penny suggest that the head of the Farnese Agrippina is 
a later addition, originally belonging to a different ancient sculpture. Haskell and Penny, 
Taste and the Antique, 133.

The transfer of the sculptures from the Palazzo Farnese, the Villa Farnesina, the Orti 
Farnesiani, and the Villa Madama to Naples began in late 1787 and took several years to 
complete. Upon their arrival in Naples, most sculptures were distributed between the

was on view in the Orti Farnesiani on the Palatine as early as 1626, prominently 
placed in the Giardino di Campo Vaccino.28 The Orti Farnesiani were a particu-
larly appealing destination for English visitors, as they represented the type of 
garden that inspired their own landscape designs.29 Winklemann manifests 
his preference for the Farnese Agrippina over the Capitoline Agrippina in his 
Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums, which also documented the sculpture’s 
change of location.30 While the first edition of this publication (1764) places 
the Farnese Agrippina in the Orti Farnesiani, the second edition (1776) notes 
its movement to the Villa Farnesina, on the outskirts of Rome.31 A 1767 inven-
tory of the Farnese collection confirms this change in the sculpture’s location, 
placing it in the Villa Farnesina’s “seconda galleria di Raffaelle.”32 According to 
subsequent inventories, the Farnese Agrippina did not leave Rome until the 
late 18th century; it arrived in Naples by 1796, where it was placed in the Real 
Fabbrica di Porcellane. By 1805, it was transferred to the Nuovo Museo dei Vec-
chi Studi di Napoli. An 1819 inventory records its final movement to the Real 
Museo Borbonico, known today as the Naples Archaeological Museum.33
The Farnese Agrippina was illustrated in Cassiano dal Pozzo’s (1589–1657) 
Museum Chartaceum, an unpublished catalogue that documented the antiqui-
ties in Roman public and private collections during the early 17th century.34 
Pope Clement xi acquired the Museum Chartaceum after Cassiano’s death, 
preserving it in the Albani collections until 1762, when George iii purchased 
several of its sections—including the illustration of the Farnese Agrippina—
for his library at Buckingham House. In 1834, the Museum Chartaceum was 
transferred to the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, where it remains today.35
While it can be suggested that the Farnese Agrippina was familiar to Euro-
pean visitors by the mid-18th century, this sculpture did not include a viable 
Palazzo Reale and the Real Fabbrica di Porcellane prior to their permanent placement in 
the Real Museo Borbonico, later the Naples Archaeological Museum. De Caro, Il Museo 
Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli, 13.

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
depiction of an ancient klismos chair. Despite their similarities, the Farnese 
and Capitoline Agrippinas are not identical, differing both in the pose of the 
sitters and the form of the chairs. Judging from remaining leg fragments at-
tached to the seat of the Farnese klismos, it is clear that this chair’s curved legs 
were freestanding, which accounts for the fact that they are no longer extant. 
Uncharacteristically, the back stiles of the Farnese klismos did not create a con-
tinuous curve with its rear legs. The entire back is placed further forward on 
the surface of the seat, disrupting what would have been the elegant line of the 
chair at the rear (Plate 28.5).
It must be noted that the Farnese Agrippina was once heavily restored, with 
all four legs of the klismos chair added.36 However, the illustration in the Muse-
um Chartaceum does not include these restorations, suggesting that the sculp-
ture was incomplete through most of its display in Rome. The sculptor Carlo 
Albacini likely restored the work in the late 18th century, prior to its relocation 
to Naples.37 In its unrestored form, the Farnese klismos lacked its curved legs 
and stood only on its cylindrical support, which would have been absent from 
any actual klismos chair in antiquity. Thus, even though the Farnese Agrippina 
could have been seen in the Orti Farnesiani from an early date, it seems un-
likely that this incomplete and inaccurate example served as a model for the 
first klismoi manufactured in the 18th century.38
	
The Uffizi Gallery
Two examples of the “Aphrodite of the Gardens” type are currently in the 
Uffizi Gallery in Florence, both catalogued as Helena, mother of Constantine 
(Plates 28.6–28.7). A catalogue of the Uffizi Gallery by Francesco Zacchiroli, 
published in 1783, places both sculptures at the end of the museum’s First or 
“East” Corridor, where they remain today.39 The first sculpture (Plate 28.6) was 
“bequeathed to the Granduke Gio. Gastone [de Medici] by sig.r Andreini.”40 
Since Gian Gastone de Medici was Duke of Tuscany between 1723 and 1737, it  
seems possible that the statue was placed in the Uffizi Gallery during this time.

As shown in Plate 28.4, the restorations to the legs of the Farnese klismos were subse-
quently removed. However, this alteration must have occurred after the 1977 publication 
of Margarete Bieber’s Ancient Copies, where she illustrates the Farnese Agrippina still in 
its restored state (see plates 451–454).

572
The second sculpture (Plate 28.7) is mentioned in both editions of Winckel-
mann’s Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums, suggesting that it was on view 
in the gallery by 1764.41 Although the Uffizi Gallery did not officially open 
to the public until 1769, the collections had been accessible to travelers for 
generations.42
The klismos chair of the first Uffizi matron is very similar to that of the Capi-
toline Agrippina, with legs carved in low relief on a supporting block.43 The 
depiction of the first Uffizi klismos is accurate, with elegant curved legs, pro-
truding tenons, and a wide, concave backboard supported by vertical stiles.44 
The second Uffizi matron is significantly different from the first, both in the 
rendering of the klismos chair and the elongated disposition of the sitter’s 
body.45 The depiction of the klismos chair in this sculpture is particularly inter-
esting, as only its front legs are curved in the typical klismos manner; the back 
of the seat is supported instead by a solid rectangular block, suggesting that 
this particular work might have been designed to be viewed from the front. The 
front legs on this chair are freestanding rather than carved in low relief, as on 
the first Uffizi klismos. The proportions of this second klismos are significantly 
more elongated, contributing to the “stretched” appearance of this sculpture 
when compared to other versions of the type.
As Richter suggests, the first Uffizi klismos (Plate 28.6) corresponds to a Ro-
man iteration of the original Greek form, with a wider backboard and a heavier 
frame. Generally, representations of the klismos chair in Roman sculpture re-
flect the Roman conception of the form, driven by a taste for Greek furniture 
and adapted to the Roman style.46 However, it is unlikely that the nuances in 
design and proportion that differentiated Roman klismoi from their Greek pro-
totypes were noted by 18th-century viewers, particularly as Roman copies of 
Greek sculpture were not clearly understood at the time. On view by the mid-
18th century, the Uffizi matrons could have played a role in the introduction of 
the klismos form to the furniture repertoire of 18th-century Europe.

Like the Capitoline and Farnese examples, the two Uffizi matrons are distinct from each 
other and from other known examples of the “Aphrodite of the Gardens” type. Apart from 
the varying depictions of the klismos chair in these sculptures, the position of the bodies 
of the sitters, the angle of their left arms, and the details of their drapery differ.

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
	
The Villa Albani
Another example of the “Aphrodite of the Gardens” type can be found at the 
Villa Albani in Rome (Plate 28.8).47 Cardinal Alessandro Albani (1692–1779) 
was a prolific collector, acquiring and selling three distinct collections of clas-
sical sculpture during his lifetime.48 The planning for the Villa Albani, built to 
house the third Albani sculpture collection, began in 1737 with the construc-
tion of a marble portal on the Via Salaria.49 The palace itself was built between 
1755 and 1763 by the architect Carlo Marchionni, although subsequent addi-
tions were made to the building and gardens until Cardinal Albani’s death in 
1779. After its official opening in 1763, the Villa Albani became a destination for 
European travelers on the Grand Tour.50
Both editions of Winckelmann’s Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums men-
tion the Albani matron, indicating an awareness of this version of the type by 
the middle of the 18th century.51 According to a late 19th-century catalogue by 
Wolfgang Helbig, the Albani matron was prominently placed in the portico 
of the villa’s main building. The depiction of the klismos in this sculpture is 
essentially accurate, with freestanding curved legs at the front and back and 
a narrow curved backboard more reminiscent of what are now known to be 
original Greek versions than Roman adaptations. However, the way in which 
the legs join the seat is uncharacteristic.52 A distinctive element of the Albani 
klismos is its supporting pillar, decorated on three sides with draped female fig-
ures.53 This use of the purely practical support as a decorative surface is unique 
among the known examples of this type.
47	
Like other examples of the type, the Albani matron is fitted with a later ancient head, its 
“Claudian hairdo” anachronistic with the style of the body. Bieber, Ancient Copies, 96.
48	
The first Albani collection was sold to Augustus the Strong of Saxony; the second, sold 
to Pope Clement xii, became part of the Capitoline Museum; much of the third Albani 
collection was seized by the French following the cardinal’s death and sold to the Munich 
Glyptothek after the fall of Napoleon. Clark, “Collections and Museums of 18th Century

Helbig describes the sculpture simply as a “seated female figure,” dismissing any associa-
tion with the figure of Agrippina. His short assessment touches on its compositional simi-
larity to the Capitoline example and notes that it has been “freely restored.” Considering 
the fragility of the freestanding legs on other known sculptures of the type, one wonders 
whether the legs of the Albani klismos are restorations. Helbig and Reisch, Guide to the 
Public Collections, 5.

As Anthony Clark notes, “great and minor holdings of art in Rome were 
well-known through travel and guide books, reputation, and the efforts of the 
local cicerone; entrance to them was in almost all cases customary and easy, 
far easier than today.”54 The Villa Albani was widely visited, and a sculpture 
such as the seated matron would have gained enough exposure to constitute 
a plausible model for the diffusion of the klismos during the later 18th century.
	
The Vatican Museum
The Vatican Museum was an essential institution for the public display of 
­antiquities in the 18th century. The Vatican’s vast complex of museums was in-
augurated in the early 16th century, with the transfer of important ancient stat-
ues owned by Pope Julius ii (1503–1513) to the Cortile delle Statue, known today 
as the Octagonal Court. However, this secluded enclosure was inaccessible to 
the general public. It was not until 1770, under the jurisdiction of Pope Clem-
ent xiv (1769–1774), that the display of antiquities in the Vatican evolved into 
a public museum.55 The Museum Clementinum, inaugurated in 1771, made the 
papal collections accessible to the public, fostering a knowledge and apprecia-
tion of art, history, and culture on a local and international level.
Clement xiv’s successor, Pope Pius vi (1775–1799), significantly enlarged the 
Vatican’s collections of art and antiquities, building the adjacent Museum Pium 
in 1776–1777 and subsequently linking it to Clement xiv’s original structure.56 
The resulting Museo Pio-Clementino was inaugurated in 1784.57 The interiors 
of this institution sought to evoke antiquity, incorporating salvaged material 
from ancient sites into their design.58 The 18th century marked a significant 
expansion in the museum’s classical holdings, due to the proliferation of ar-
chaeological excavations in and around Rome, as well as an influx of donations 
from collectors worldwide.59 The importance of the Museo Pio-Clementino as 
a repository of classical sculpture was greatly enhanced by the removal of the 
Medici and Farnese collections from Rome in the late 18th century. The Museo 
Pio-Clementino thus became an essential destination for scholars, antiquar-
ians, and Grand Tourists visiting the Italian capital.60

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
Two seated sculptures in the Museo Pio-Clementino, representing the poets 
Menander (Plate 28.9) and Posidippus (Plate 28.10), are particularly relevant to 
the klismos form. Discovered near Rome during the 16th century, these sculp-
tures were housed in several locations prior to their inclusion in the museum 
in the late 18th century.61 Both figures sit on heavyset klismoi, their enlarged 
backboards and thick cushions indicative of Roman iterations of the form.62 
An engraving of the interiors of the Museo Pio-Clementino by Vincenzo Fe-
oli (1755–1827) indicates that the sculptures of Menander and Posidippus sat 
prominently in the museum’s Galleria delle Statue, flanking an arched entrance 
that looked east toward the Verospi Jupiter (Plate 28.11).63 This image, engraved 
ca. 1795, provides a definite location for these sculptures within the museum 
by this date.64 Though the sculptures of Menander and Posidippus are not an 
identical pair, their compositional similarities yielded a certain symmetry that 
no doubt dictated their placement. Given their prominent position within the 
museum’s galleries by 1795 or earlier, it is possible that the klismoi depicted in 
these two works were instrumental to the introduction of the form to western 
Europe during the later 18th century.
The various iterations of the “Aphrodite of the Gardens” type available 
in Italy during the 18th century provided a number of depictions of klismos 
chairs, in many cases clearly indicating the chair’s form and construction. The 
Capitoline Agrippina, donated to the Capitoline Museum in 1566 and promi-
nently placed in the Palazzo Nuovo from 1734, was the first complete statue of 
this type on public view (Plate 28.3). An incomplete version of the type could 
be seen in the Orti Farnesiani from ca. 1626 to ca. 1767 and then in the Villa 
61	
The first recorded location of the statue of Posidippus was the Church of San Lorenzo 
in Panisperna from ca. 1585–1590 to 1655, when it first appeared in the inventories of 
the ­Villa Negroni in Rome. The statue remained at the Villa Negroni until 1785, when 
­Giuseppe Staderini sold the sculpture to Thomas Jenkins. Jenkins likely housed it in his 
residence at Casa Celli until 1789, when he sold it to Pope Pius vi. Census of Antique

been reworked. Dillon, Ancient Greek Portrait Sculpture, 88–97.

Farnesina until ca. 1796, when it was moved to Naples (Plates 28.4–28.5). The 
Uffizi Gallery, which opened to the public in 1769, contained two examples of 
the type, one of them with a solid rectangular support at the back (Plates 28.6–
28.7). Lastly, a version with freestanding legs was on view in the Villa Albani 
from 1763 (Plate 28.8). In addition, two sculptures representing Menander and 
Posidippus seated on clearly rendered klismoi were displayed in the Museo 
Pio-Clementino, probably from the time of the museum’s opening in 1784 but 
certainly after 1795 (Plates 28.9–28.10). It is likely that these various sculptures, 
individually and collectively, played a significant role in the introduction of 
the klismos form to the western European visual vocabulary in the later 18th 
century, through the eyes of the many scholars, artists, and Grand Tourists who 
encountered them during their travels.
	
Avenues of Diffusion: Reproductions and Souvenirs
Alongside the display of ancient originals throughout the Italian territories, 
a market for small-scale reproductions of these sculptures in Italy and else-
where in Europe flourished during the later part of the 18th century, instigating 
the production of bronze and plaster miniatures to be sold to Grand Tourists 
or ordered by catalogue from abroad.65 Artists such as Francesco Righetti the 
Elder (1749–1819), Giacomo Zoffoli (ca. 1731–1785), and Giovanni Zoffoli (ca. 
1745–1805)66 selected the most celebrated pieces from influential repositories 
of ­antiquities and reproduced them on a diminutive scale. These desirable 
souvenirs served as visual reminders of particularly memorable sculptures 
and mementoes of a trip abroad. Well-known works such as the Capitoline 
Agrippina, the Farnese Agrippina, and the Vatican Menander were ideal sub-
jects for this kind of enterprise. A catalogue of bronzes produced in 1794 by 
Francesco Righetti, for instance, lists the various small-scale reproductions 
available through his workshop. As indicated by its title, “Aux amateurs de 
l’antiquité et des beaux arts,” this catalogue was meant particularly for ­tourists 
65	
Although bronze reproductions of classical statuary had been produced since the 15th 
century, it was not until the late 17th century that sculptors began to strive consistently 
for archaeological accuracy, producing faithful replicas and refraining from improving on 
their models. Honour, “After the Antique,” 195.

It is commonly thought that Giacomo and Giovanni Zoffoli were brothers. However, due 
to the difference of 14 years in their age, it has also been suggested that they might have 
been uncle and nephew. Honour, “Bronze Statuettes by Giacomo and Giovanni Zoffoli,”

and ­enthusiasts.67 The “Agrippine du Capitole” is listed with a retail price 
of eighteen Roman zecchini, making it one of the least expensive options in 
Righetti’s repertoire.68 This sculpture’s relatively low price was likely due to 
its size and simplicity when compared to more complicated groups such as 
the Farnese Bull (100 zecchini) and the Nine Muses and Apollo in the Vatican 
(200 zecchini). The inclusion of the Capitoline Agrippina in this catalogue in-
dicates its fame by the late 18th century, which, paired with its reasonable re-
tail price, would have probably ensured successful sales.69 In 1795–1796, the 
distinguished agent Charles Heathcoate Tatham (1772–1842) shared catalogues 
by both Righetti and Giovanni Zoffoli with his employer, the architect Henry 
Holland (1745–1806), indicating that interest in such reproductions was not un-
common among English artists, designers, and enthusiasts of antiquity.70
A catalogue produced by Giovanni Zoffoli in 1795 lists 59 miniature bronze 
copies of classical sculptures available from his workshop.71 The fifth entry on 
the list, “Agrippina, Madre di Nerone,” refers to the Farnese Agrippina, trans-
ferred as noted to Naples by 1796.72 An example of this bronze reproduction, 
dated ca. 1780–1790 and attributed to Giacomo or Giovanni Zoffoli, is currently 
in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Plates 28.12–28.13–28.14).73 At a height of 
less than 12 inches, this bronze miniature remains faithful to the marble origi-
nal. The depiction of the klismos chair in this bronze version incorporates the 
restorations to the original legs that have since been removed from the sculp-
ture (see above, and Plates 28.4–28.5).
The Zoffoli catalogue also includes a reproduction of the Vatican Menander, 
described as “Silla Console, sedente” and sold for 20 Roman zecchini. Winck-
elmann originally identified this sculpture as Sulla (Silla), as no name was 
­specified on its plinth. The statue was later identified as Menander and

The zecchino was a popular gold coin used in Venice from the 13th century onwards.

As kinsmen, Giacomo and Giovanni Zoffoli often worked together on the same sculp-
tures. Both of them signed their sculpture simply as “G.ZOFFOLI.F” (the final “F” referred 
to the Latin fecit), making it difficult to attribute particular sculptures any further. Hon-

­considered a mate to the statue of Posidippus, the plinth of which bears 
his name (see Plates 28.9–28.10).74 Several miniature bronzes of the Vatican 
Menander attributed to the Zoffolis also exist, one of them located at Saltram 
House, Devon, dated ca. 1793.75 Bronzes such as these were often displayed as 
garnitures de cheminée, or mantelpiece ornaments, tasteful decorative objects 
evocative of classical antiquity and demonstrative of the purchaser’s erudition 
and taste. The seemingly ubiquitous nature of bronze reproductions such as 
the Farnese Agrippina and the Vatican Menander, in which the klismos chair 
is prominently and meticulously depicted, suggests that such figures may have 
inspired their owners to commission or purchase furniture similar to that 
shown in these prestigious souvenirs.
	
The Early Klismos Chair in England
While the availability of classical statuary in Italy was surely important for the 
diffusion of the klismos form throughout the rest of Europe, the segment of 
the population able to make the journey to view these ancient originals was 
relatively small. In England, the British Museum emerged as a source of access 
to antiquities closer to the artists and craftsmen responsible for the design and 
fabrication of neoclassical furniture.
Montagu House, the original site of the British Museum, opened to the 
public in 1759. Admission to the museum, administered by various methods 
throughout the 18th century, was well controlled, yet free of charge.76 In 1772, 
the British Museum purchased Sir William Hamilton’s entire first collection of 
antiquities.77 This collection included 730 ancient vases, several of which fea-
ture accurate depictions of the klismos chair as part of their painted decoration 
(Plate 28.14).78 The acquisition of Hamilton’s first collection entirely changed 
the face and spirit of the British Museum, previously a repository of books, 
manuscripts, and natural history specimens.79

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
During his appointment as British ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples 
(1764–1800), Hamilton amassed a significant collection of archaeological ar-
tifacts with an underlying scholarly scope. Ancient vases, removed in increas-
ing numbers from cemeteries around Campania, became his chief collecting 
passion.80 As a collector, Hamilton valued his vases not only as archaeological 
treasures but also as evidence of the aesthetic genius and technical prowess 
of the ancients.81 The sharing of his ancient treasures constituted an essen-
tial element of Hamilton’s lifelong project, dedicated to the instruction of the 
general public—and particularly the British nation—in the appreciation of 
Greco-Roman antiquities.82
The British Museum’s acquisition of Hamilton’s first collection in 1772 was 
preceded by the publication of the first two volumes of the Baron d’Hancarville’s 
Collection of Etruscan, Greek, and Roman Antiquities from the Cabinet of the Hon. 
Wm. Hamilton. The first edition of this publication, which included text in Eng-
lish and French with hand-tinted illustrations, was financed entirely by Ham-
ilton. The first of four folio volumes was issued in 1767, followed by a second 
volume printed in 1770.83 The publication of the last two volumes was much 
more problematic, hindered by d’Hancarville’s debts and increased production 
costs that taxed Hamilton’s resources. While the publication date of volumes 
three and four is usually given as 1776, it is unlikely that many copies reached 
subscribers before the early 1780s.84 The corpus of vases in d’Hancarville’s four 
volumes includes pieces from collections other than Hamilton’s, which never 
entered the British Museum. These additional vases were meant to expand the 
breadth of the publication’s coverage beyond what was available in Hamilton’s 
collection alone.85
Depictions of the klismos chair occur throughout the volumes of 
d’Hancarville’s publication, though the commentary that accompanies some 
of the images makes little note of the furniture depicted on the vases. One 
of the aims of d’Hancarville’s publication was to display the proportions and 
decoration of ancient vases clearly, so as to aid in their subsequent reproduc-
tion in various mediums.86 Most vases were rendered as three-dimensional

objects in order to indicate form and accompanied by elevations to show scale. 
Each entry included one or more colored reproductions of the paintings on the 
vases themselves. However, this systematic presentation was only carried out 
fully for some of the pieces depicted. Particularly in the last volumes, colored 
reproductions of the painted scenes on certain vases were placed alongside 
frontal views and elevations of other vases, selected because of their shape 
rather than their correspondence with the painted scenes they accompanied. 
D’Hancarville’s publication of Hamilton’s first collection was an important 
early source for the klismos form and other ancient furniture models. How-
ever, the first edition of this publication was a luxury item, lavishly illustrated 
and finely bound—as such, it was accessible only to a few select subscribers, 
among them influential artists, architects, and designers.87
Hamilton’s vases became one of the British Museum’s main attractions, first 
displayed as a cohesive collection in Montagu House. In the early 19th century, 
the collection was moved to the newly constructed Townley Gallery, which 
opened to the public in 1808.88 This new wing included a specially appointed 
“Hamilton Room” where the vases could be displayed “in a strong light,” ac-
cording to Hamilton’s request.89 An 1809 London guidebook by David Hughson 
makes specific mention of the Hamilton collection, on view in the Townley 
Gallery alongside Greek and Roman sculptures and Egyptian antiquities.90 
Nevertheless, Hamilton’s collection was only displayed as a single entity until 
the mid-19th century. In order to better conform to the museum’s new system 
of classification, the Hamilton antiquities were merged with the general hold-
ings of the museum following the expansion of the collections in the 1840s and 
1850s.91
Another significant early addition to the British Museum’s collections of 
antiquities was the Townley marbles. Charles Townley (1737–1805) was an

The arrival of the Hamilton collection at the British Museum in 1772 shifted the balance 
of the collections toward artifacts and antiquities rather than natural history specimens, 
leading to the foundation of a Department of Antiquities in 1807. The purchase of the 
Elgin marbles in 1816 and the accession of artifacts from museum-sponsored excavations 
in Assyria (1840s) and Turkey (1850s) resulted in the division of this department into three 
separate sections in 1860: Greek and Roman Antiquities, Coins and Medals, and Oriental 
Antiquities. It was presumably through this later division that the contents of the Ham-
ilton Collection were separated and rearranged according to the museum’s new methods 
of organization and display. Cuno, Museums Matter, 15.

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
English aristocrat who amassed a considerable collection of ancient sculpture 
in marble and terracotta, mostly acquired during his residence in Rome and 
Florence between 1765 and 1772, and consistently supplemented with new pur-
chases until his death in 1805.92 Upon his return to England, Townley installed 
his marbles in his London residence at 7 Park Street, built specifically for the 
exhibition of his collection and completed in 1778.93 Townley personally over-
saw the restoration, inventory, and documentation of his sculptures, creating 
exhibition catalogues that described the works contained in each room.94 In 
1791, Townley was elected a trustee of the British Museum, to which he be-
queathed his entire collection of antiquities contingent on the construction of 
a new gallery for its display.95 Throughout its exhibition on Park Street, Town-
ley’s collection was accessible only to a select few, as he “allowed a most liberal 
access to all those who were known in the literary circles, as men of taste or as 
antiquaries.”96 The collection became fully accessible to the members of the 
public after its acquisition by the British Museum, following Townley’s death.97
A particularly noteworthy piece in Townley’s collection is the marble grave 
stele of Xanthippos, dated ca. 430 b.c. (Plate 28.15). This Greek work was ac-
quired by Dr. Anthony Askew in Athens around 1747 and incorporated into the 
Townley collection in 1778.98 The klismos chair depicted in relief on this stele is 
accurately depicted, and could certainly have constituted a model of the form 
for visitors to Park Street after 1778 or the Townley Gallery at the British Mu-
seum after its opening in 1808.
As an accessible institution, The British Museum was visited frequently by 
members of the public and used by the artists and craftsmen of the period as a 
source of instruction and inspiration. According to Hughson’s 1809 guidebook,

According to Townley’s will, dated November 9, 1802, his collection of sculptures would 
only be bequeathed to the British Museum if his direct heirs were unable to construct 
suitable statue galleries for their exhibition. However, following Townley’s death in 1805, 
the executors of his will immediately fulfilled the bequest, allowing the British Museum to 
purchase the marbles for £20,000 by an Act of Parliament. Cook, The Townley Marbles, 59.
98	
Lyde Browne, Governor of the Bank of England and a collector of antiquities, acquired 
the stele of Xanthippos from the Askew sale in 1775, subsequently selling it to Townley 
for £20. This was the only original Greek work in Townley’s collection. Cook, The Townley 
Marbles, 27–29.

“artists who are properly recommended, especially by a professor of the Royal 
Academy, are also allowed to draw from the antique marbles, or any other ob-
jects on which they might choose to exercise their skill.”99 It is probable that 
the vases in Hamilton’s collection were among these “other objects” that art-
ists were allowed to draw. The museum was committed to its public role as 
an institution that fostered knowledge, ensuring that “every practicable facil-
ity is afforded that may render this institution really useful to science and the 
arts, for which it is chiefly intended, as well as gratifying to the curiosity of 
the multitude, who incessantly resort to it in quest of amusement.”100 One can 
speculate that the British Museum must have played a role in the diffusion of 
the klismos model, as the scenes on the stele of Xanthippos and the Hamilton 
vases were surely drawn and transmitted.
	
Wedgwood’s Jasperware
The practice of reproducing the masterpieces of antiquity on a diminutive 
scale was also prevalent in England. In the hands of Josiah Wedgwood (1730–
1795), jasperware emerged as an innovative medium through which to repro-
duce and commercialize the masterpieces of antiquity.101 Wedgwood’s line of 
jasperware goods was decorated with cameo-like scenes in low relief, heavily 
drawn from William Hamilton’s first collection of vases.102 Wedgwood em-
ployed the talented draftsman John Flaxman (1755–1826) to create precisely 
rendered designs inspired both by the painted vases in Hamilton’s collection 
and their illustrations in d’Hancarville’s publication, among other sources.103 
An example that may serve to illustrate this process is the Attic red figure hy-
dria illustrated in Plate 28.14, portraying three women, two playing ball and 
99

101	
Jasperware—a dense stoneware—is a proprietary ceramic body created by Wedgwood 
from a mixture of calcined flint, Purbeck clay, alabaster, and sulphate of barium. When 
thinly potted and fired at a high temperature, jasperware can evoke the translucence of 
porcelain. In 1776, Wedgwood revealed the formula for the manufacture of jasperware to 
his business partner Thomas Bentley (1730–1780), launching the production of wares in 
this innovative material in the company’s Etruria factory. Reilly, Wedgwood: The New Il-
lustrated Dictionary, 239–240.
102	
The white-on-blue and white-on-black color schemes of Wedgwood’s jasperware were 
particularly reminiscent of the appearance and technique of Roman cameo glass, master-
fully evidenced in the Portland Vase. Wedgwood borrowed this vase in 1786 and produced 
various copies, first in black and later in light blue and other colors. Jenkins and Sloan, 
Vases and Volcanoes, 187–188.

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
one seated. This vase was published in the first of d’Hancarville’s volumes 
(1766/1767), its central painting reproduced as a colored illustration surround-
ed by a decorative frieze (Plate 28.16).104 The figure on the left is popularly iden-
tified as Volumnia, wife of Coriolanus, seated on a carefully depicted klismos 
chair. In 1785, the Wedgwood factory reproduced this scene as a 6 in. × 9⅛ in. 
jasperware tablet (Plate 28.17), made to be “applied as cabinet pictures, or for 
ornamenting cabinets, bookcases, writing tables, in the composition of a great 
variety of chimney pieces and other ornamental work.”105 While the replace-
ment of painting with relief on Wedgwood’s jasperware plaque clearly altered 
the overall appearance of the original scene, both d’Hancarville’s illustration 
and Wedgwood’s jasperware version accurately reproduce the proportions of 
the klismos chair depicted on the red figure vase, although the rear legs have 
been elongated, and the seat tilts down at the front.
The late 18th century witnessed the proliferation of small-scale reproduc-
tions of classical masterpieces as bronze miniatures, jasperware plaques, and 
tinted illustrations, with English consumers driving a significant portion of the 
market for these goods. These reproductions became models for the introduc-
tion of the klismos chair into the English household as an elegant and archaeo-
logically inspired furniture form worthy of the most fashionable interiors.
	
The English Klismos Chair
An early example of the klismos chair in England is attributed to the archi-
tect Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808), designed in 1787–88 for the Pompeiian Room 
at Packington Hall, Warwickshire (Plate 28.18).106 As Marcus Binney suggests, 
the Pompeiian Room was created as a backdrop for the 4th Earl of Aylesford’s

The balls that the women play with in the original vase painting were added on top of 
the black glaze in white or purple pigment, causing them eventually to flake off, leaving 
only a shadow behind. Due to their lack of visibility, these balls are not represented in 
d’Hancarville’s illustration, causing them to be absent from the Wedgwood jasperware 
tablet as well. Jenkins and Sloan, Vases and Volcanoes, 158–159.

were highly evocative although not completely archaeologically accurate, like-
ly a response to an enthusiastic patron’s desire to create a classicizing interior 
for the display of his antiquities. Bonomi’s klismoi were fully gilded, outfitted 
with squab cushions, and curiously elongated from front to back.108 The curved 
backboards tilted forward at an unusual angle, and the moderately splayed legs 
terminated in concealed castors.109
	
The Early Klismos Chair in France
The production of the klismos chair as a practical piece of furniture occurred 
to a greater extent in France, where the klismos became an early exemplar 
for the Empire style that would flourish later under Napoleon. Depictions of 
the klismos chair were included in late 18th-century paintings such as those 
by Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825), which often depicted scenes from an-
cient history and mythology. Many of David’s paintings, such as Andromache 
Mourning Hector (1783), Paris and Helen (1789), and The Lictors Bring to Brutus 
the Bodies of His Sons (1789), called for the creation of evocative classical set-
tings, which required believable studio props made in ancient styles. David 
drew inspiration from the works of Caylus, Piranesi, Montfaucon, and Winck-
elmann for his furniture designs à l’antique.110 Furthermore, he had studied in 
the Académie de France in Rome between 1775 and 1780, during which time he 
visited the most important repositories of antiquities in and around Rome and 
produced hundreds of drawings inspired by the monuments, sculptures, and 
reliefs he encountered.111
The main figure in David’s Brutus is seated on a clearly depicted klismos 
chair, suggestive of a certain domestic intimacy interrupted by the arrival of 
the lictors (Plate 28.19). His feet rest on a low block that serves as a ­footstool.

Although the tilted angle of the backboard of this klismos is unusual, it is not entirely

The Neoclassical Klismos Chair
The muscularity of the chair’s construction, noticeable particularly in the 
broad backrest and robust curved legs, is indicative of a Roman iteration of 
the klismos form, similar to that depicted in the sculpture of Menander in the 
Museo Pio-Clementino (see Plate 28.9), which features a similar footstool. Da-
vid’s history paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon, a major fine art ex-
hibition that attracted artists, patrons, scholars, and enthusiasts from around 
Europe and motivated the production of catalogues and journals. Brutus was 
presented at the Salon in the summer of 1789, on the eve of the Revolution. 
The painting created immediate controversy, as the government, reluctant to 
display seemingly propagandistic works, initially opposed the work’s display.112 
The political notoriety surrounding David’s Brutus increased its renown, and 
with it an interest in the ancient-style objects it depicted.
The desire to create realistic classical backdrops for his paintings led Da-
vid to commission a suite of “Etruscan”113 studio furniture from the celebrated 
ébéniste Georges Jacob (1739–1814), who manufactured furniture for the Garde-
Meuble and for wealthy patrons in France, England, Germany, and Sweden.114 
David’s studio furniture was modeled after ancient forms, designed by David 
and his pupil Charles Moreau, and faithfully executed by Jacob.115 The visibility 
that Jacob’s studio furniture achieved through David’s paintings ensured their 
significance as early models for the Empire style.116 However, while David had 
certainly encountered ancient Roman sculptures and “Etruscan” vases during 
his travels in Italy, it is unlikely that Jacob himself had access to original Greco-
Roman antiquities as models for his classically inspired studio pieces.117

David’s Brutus depicts the story of Lucius Junius Brutus, founder of the Roman Republic. 
Brutus’s sons had attempted to overthrow the Republic and restore the monarchy, and 
Brutus was willing to have them executed in order to protect it. Similarities have been 
suggested between the story of Brutus and the events in Paris during the summer of 1789; 
the choice of subject matter for this painting is in keeping with David’s own republican 
beliefs. Crow, Painters and Public Life, 248–249.

Even though the misidentification of Greek vases as Etruscan was eventually rectified 
by scholars such as Winckelmann, the use of the term “Etruscan” to describe the type of 
decoration inspired by these vases persisted throughout the 18th century and beyond.

Several examples of the furniture that Jacob manufactured for David have descended 
through David’s family and have subsequently been published or sold. The table depicted 
in David’s Brutus, for instance, is in a private collection. See González-Palacios, Il gusto dei 
Principi, vol. 1, plate xii; vol. 2, 54.

It is possible that the prominence of Jacob’s studio furniture as seen in 
­David’s work instigated furniture commissions in the antique style from con-
temporary designers. Early examples of such commissions are the pieces man-
ufactured for the “Etruscan Style” rooms in the Hôtel Montholon in 1786, after 
designs by the architect Jean-Jacques Lequeu (Plate 28.20).118 Unlike David’s 
studio furniture, which aimed to reproduce ancient forms with some accuracy, 
Lequeu’s designs are largely adaptations, utilizing elements considered “Etrus-
can” to create imaginative new types.119 Nevertheless, Lequeu’s elegant version 
of the klismos chair is fairly true to its ancient prototypes and communicates a 
desire to engage with furniture models inspired directly by antiquity, as repre-
sented in David’s work.120
The klismos chair was also prominent in the furniture repertoire of 
­celebrated ébénistes such as Bernard Molitor (1755–1833), who produced 
­furniture both for the Garde-Meuble and for private patrons. It is likely that 
Molitor attended the École Royale Gratuite de Dessin upon his arrival in Paris 
in 1776–1778.121 The curriculum of this institution, which educated craftsmen 
in the production of luxury goods, included the drawing of samples based on 
ancient artifacts and sculptures.122 Between 1795 and 1810, Molitor produced 
several sets of chairs inspired by the ancient klismos, the composition of 
which denotes a restrained interpretation of the ancient Greek model, with a 
narrow backboard and tapered legs that curve in a contained manner toward 
the front and back (Plate 28.21). Molitor’s klismoi are soberly decorated, their 
backboards enhanced with fine strips of brass inlaid in geometric patterns. 
Molitor used the klismos form repeatedly, producing versions of the chair 
death, beginning with the purchase of the Tochon Collection in 1818. Louvre Museum,

According to Jarry and Devinoy, none of these pieces of furniture is extant, but the water-
color designs by Lequeu are preserved in the Cabinet des Estampes in the National Library 
of France. Jarry and Devinoy, Le siège français, 260.

Though the exact date for the production of Jacob’s studio furniture is not certain, the 
first of David’s paintings to feature furniture in the ancient style was The Death of Sen-
eca (1773). Brutus (1789) presents his earliest and most accurate depiction of the klismos 
chair. A modified klismos, with straight legs and carved decoration on the knees and sides, 
appears in David’s portrait of Madame de Verninac (1799). A klismos is also depicted in 
David’s Sappho and Phaon (1809), its upper section concealed by drapery. De Nanteuil,

The Klismos in Scandinavia
The 18th-century introduction of the klismos chair as a replicable piece of 
furniture reached beyond England and France, with several early examples 
produced by Scandinavian designers. According to John Morley, the “purest 
eighteenth-century version” of the klismos form was produced ca. 1790 by the 
Danish painter, architect, and designer Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard (1743–
1809) (Plate  28.22).124 Abildgaard’s designs for furniture and interiors were 
greatly influenced by his training in Italy (1772–1777), where he devoted con-
siderable time to the study of antiquities.125 His klismos relates to Greek rather 
than Roman models, featuring a narrow backboard and tapered legs sweeping 
out toward the front and back. Embracing the simplicity of the ancient klismos, 
Abildgaard re-created the details of its construction with archaeological accu-
racy: the pins securing the joinery of the legs and seat frame are indicated, as 
is the simple woven seat. Abildgaard carved the dramatically curved legs of his 
klismos from pieces of timber with a curved grain; by respecting the direction 
of the grain of the wood, Abildgaard ensured that the chair was sturdy and sta-
ble.126 The only surface decoration on this chair, apart from its gilding, is a sim-
ple incised band of anthemia running along the front face of the backboard.
Another remarkable klismos chair, manufactured by an unknown Dan-
ish or Italian craftsman ca. 1800–1820, is currently in the Victoria and Albert 
Museum (Plate 28.23).127 Of squatter proportions, this klismos is embellished 
throughout with painted decoration that reproduces the imagery and style of 
ancient Greek red figure painted pottery. The frieze on its backboard, depict-
ing Herakles in the garden of the Hesperides, was modeled after a scene on a 
vase in Hamilton’s first collection, acquired by the British Museum in 1772.128

The Modern Klismos Chair
The production of klismoi intensified in the early 19th century, concomitant 
with the publication of classicizing interiors by Charles Percier and Pierre 
Fontaine in France and Thomas Hope in England. The klismos form became 
a staple of the Empire style, which adapted classical forms and motifs for the 
production of highly imaginative furniture inspired by the antique. Early 19th-
century klismoi were more ornamental than archaeologically accurate, incor-
porating elaborate details that disrupted the simplicity of the ancient form.
Percier and Fontaine’s Recueil de decorations intérieures, published in yearly 
installments between 1801 and 1812, was comprised of 72 plates of outline en-
gravings.130 As the authors had hoped, these plates were extremely influential 
for the “dissemination and the upholding of the principles of taste … derived 
from ancient [Greco-Roman] art,” transforming antiquity into “the most fruit-
ful source for the spirit of fashion.”131 Several klismos chairs are illustrated in 
the Recueil, a particularly accurate example shown against the back wall of 
a Parisian bedroom for “citoyen v” (Figure 28.1).132 This bedroom, with walls 
draped in textiles and furniture “clad with bronzes, paintings on enamel and 
inlays of various kinds of wood,” corresponds to an overly decorated notion 
of antiquity, inspired more by elaborate Roman designs than simple Greek 
forms.133 Although this klismos chair, modified with an additional backboard 
and decorated with what appear to be bronze fittings, lacks the austerity of 
the ancient model, it incorporates enough of its characteristics to be fully 
recognizable.

on the vase accurately, although framed in a rectangular composition, as on the chair’s 
backboard; the painting on the backboard, however, shows the scene in reverse.
130	
Percier and Fontaine’s Recueil was completed in 1812, at which time the 72 plates were 
bound together and sold as a single publication, accompanied by a preface and descrip-
tions for each plate. A second edition of the publication appeared in 1827. Percier and

Thomas Hope’s Household Furniture and Interior Decoration, published in 1807, 
was largely a series of outline engravings documenting the fine ­furnishings and 
lavish interiors of his mansion on Duchess Street, London.134 An influential ar-
biter of taste, Hope had amassed an important collection of sculpture and an-
tiquities, including several rooms of ancient vases.135 Hope was a patron of the 
arts, enlisting teams of artisans to manufacture furniture and other decorative 
objects after his designs. Hope’s furniture designs were copied repeatedly, yet 
often inaccurately. Part of Hope’s motivation for the publication of his interiors 
was to ensure that subsequent imitations of his furniture were at least ­correctly 
proportioned.136 Unlike the designs of Percier and Fontaine, who favored the 
more intricate Roman aesthetic, Hope’s ­furniture designs were ­personal and 
idiosyncratic, frequently combining Greek forms and Egyptianizing motifs.137
Variations of the klismos chair appear throughout Hope’s publication, rang-
ing from the fairly simple side chairs illustrated in the “second room contain-
ing Greek vases” (Figures 28.2–28.3) to the more elaborate design for a ­klismos 
armchair incorporating hybrid creatures (Figure  28.4). The side chairs are 
­fairly close to ancient prototypes, with tapered and splayed front and back legs 
and a narrow backboard (although with scalloped sides).138 The armchair is a 
much looser adaptation of the ancient klismos, retaining the curved legs and 
backboard of the original form and adding a curule-shaped brace for the chair 
back and winged lions as armrest supports. Both of these designs served to 
advance the klismos form while encouraging a degree of creativity that would 
characterize neoclassical furniture designs in the 19th century.139

in the 19th century might address the diffusion of the type from the homes of influential 
tastemakers to the general market, in the hands of cabinetmakers such as George Smith 
(ca. 1786–1828), who borrowed heavily from Hope’s original designs in his Collection of 
Designs for Household Furniture and Interior Decoration (1808). Designs for Household

Conclusion
The accessibility of ancient depictions of the klismos chair in Italy, as well as 
their dissemination via publications and serial replication in mediums such as 
bronze and jasperware, were all factors in bringing the klismos into the visual 
vocabulary of the 18th century and promoting its development as a modern 
furniture form. While scholarship to date has concentrated particularly on 
William Hamilton’s collection and its publication by the Baron d’Hancarville 
as the major source from which modern adaptations of antique forms were 
derived, it now seems clear that the wealth of ancient depictions of the klis-
mos and the small-scale souvenirs and reproductions that these ancient origi-
nals inspired also played an important role in the diffusion of the klismos form 
in Europe. An examination of the examples that 18th century Grand Tourists 
were able to view in Italy and the souvenirs they brought back from their trav-
els underscores their significance for the introduction of the klismos form into 
the modern European furniture repertoire.
Once the early neoclassical klismoi began to appear in the late 18th century, 
they themselves became sources for the dissemination of the form, contribut-
ing to the fashion for the antique that led to the development of the Empire 
style during the first quarter of the 19th century. Modern klismoi were featured 
prominently in the homes of influential European tastemakers, enthusiasts 
who endeavored to recreate a classical setting through the decoration of their 
interiors. The inclusion of the klismos form in these new neoclassical spaces 
illustrates a desire on the part of 18th- and 19th-century artists, designers, and 
patrons to engage actively with antiquity, incorporating historically traceable 
ancient forms into their domestic environment. Through its elegant simplicity, 
the klismos chair evoked a cultural ideal, an association that persisted even 
in the most ornamental and imaginative 19th-century versions of the form. A 
beautiful and practical type of seat in ancient Greece, the klismos became an 
important element in the neoclassical design repertoire, bringing the Greco-
Roman past to life through an exceptional piece of furniture.
Furniture, by Thomas Sheraton (1751–1806), published posthumously in 1807, was also 
significant, including several designs for chairs that, although fanciful, approximate the 
klismos. The modern klismos chair extends into the 20th century and beyond, notably in 
the designs of Terence Harold Robsjohn-Gibbings, who endeavored to recreate the an-
cient Greek prototype accurately from representations depicted in ancient sculpture and 
vase paintings. Robsjohn-Gibbings and Pullin, Furniture of Classical Greece.

The Furniture of the Ramesside Pharaohs
Geoffrey Killen
	
The State Furniture of Ramesses ii
The wall sculptors who decorated the temples of Ramesses ii with the victory 
scenes of his reign often show the pharaoh seated on a round-legged stool. 
The design of this stool was copied and rendered on temple walls throughout 
Egypt. The use of this stool reinforced the pharaoh’s absolute power; however, 
it uses a form of construction not previously seen as the platform to project the 
pharaoh’s authority. Although earlier pharaohs would have had or used round-
legged stools in their households, few would come to project their image by 
using such a piece of furniture.1 An informal scene carved of Akhenaten and 
Nefertiti on a “house altar stele” discovered at Amarna shows the queen, who 
comforts two of their daughters, seated on a round-legged stool that features 
a frieze of unification symbols with a Sema bound with the papyrus and Up-
per Egyptian lily plants. Interestingly, this stele shows the pharaoh seated on a 
simple lattice stool.2 Perhaps the single round-legged stool placed in the tomb 
of Tutankhamun, je 62042, was designed to be used by his queen Ankhese-
namun. The use of the round-legged stool and, later, the throne with round 
legs would come to characterize a royal preference for this type of seating in 
the Ramesside period, and perhaps indicates that a new type of manufactur-
ing technology, wood turning, was being practised in the royal workshops of 
the Ramesside pharaohs. I am happy to dedicate this article to Oscar White 
Muscarella, who has long been interested in ancient furniture—and who has 
shown himself to be adept in the use of (replicas of) ancient Egyptian tools.
Shown on the exterior wall of the first pylon at the Luxor temple is a carved 
image of a typical round-legged stool that was used by Ramesses ii (Plate 29.1). 
The legs are taller than those seen on other types of round-legged stools, a 
deliberate design feature used to elevate the seated pharaoh and allow him to 
place his feet upon a footstool. A bracing stretcher between the legs supports 
a carved Sema bound with the papyrus and Upper Egyptian lily. At the seat rail

joints the legs appear cylindrical; however, lower down they have been shaped 
to a narrow waist, which suggests that they were turned from wood.
Another round-legged stool is to be found in a wall relief within the great 
hall (north wall, lower row) of the Great Temple at Abu Simbel (Plate 29.2).3 
Yet another wall relief, from the pylon in the Ramesseum, shows Ramesses 
ii seated on a round-legged stool with elongated legs that allow the pharaoh 
to rest his feet upon a box type footstool.4 The top surface of the footstool is 
upholstered with a thick cushion, while the sides of the footstool have been 
rendered with panels showing bound captives and a pair of bows. This typical 
formulaic arrangement is seen on royal footstools, allowing for the symbolic 
trampling of the pharaoh’s enemies.
A possible travelling footstool depicting bound captives was found in the 
tomb of Tutankhamun, now in the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.5 This footstool 
has been linked by the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, with a portable pavilion from 
the tomb, as it was discovered in the same context as a number of elements 
from the pavilion.6 Carter defines the construction of this piece as follows: “of 
box type—[that] has (false) bottom 8.5 cents. [85 mm] below top edge.”7 This 
influenced those in the Egyptian Museum to conclude that the footstool could 
have doubled as a storage box used to store the fabric sheets that formed the 
canopy of the pavilion, and recorded it as such on the display card that was 
placed with this artefact.
The quality of timber from which this footstool/box has been manufactured 
is quite poor, while the surface has been covered with gilt and inlaid with piec-
es of faience and calcite to form the border of the carcase. The front and two 
end panels have embossed gilded figures, set on a faience background showing 
both Asiatic and Nubian enemies bound symbolically with the stems of the 
papyrus and Upper Egyptian lily, representing the union of Upper and Lower 
3	 Ramesses ii is seen sitting on a typical round-legged stool, covered with a thick cushion with 
Sema and intertwining papyrus and Upper Egyptian lily decoration strung below the seat. 
The scene illustrates the Battle-record of Year 5 of his reign. This scene was photographed 
during Breasted’s 1905–1907 expedition to Egypt and the Sudan, The Oriental Institute of the 
University of Chicago, P. 2439.

Egypt. The upper edges of the three decorated surfaces are carved in the form 
of a gilded cavetto cornice and torus moulding.
Both end panels have a pair of vertically mounted bronze staples that still re-
tain fragments of leather strapping. The back surface of the carcase is finished 
as a plain undecorated surface suggesting that the leather straps tied to the 
staples held this piece against another piece of furniture. Found within the box 
was a mass of badly decayed linen and feathers that could have formed a cush-
ion. From the mass of feathers it was estimated by Carter that this proposed 
cushion, which sat within the box on the carcase’s false bottom, would have 
been 300 mm long, 220 mm wide and 130 mm thick.8 These figures suggest that 
45 mm of cushion would have protruded beyond the top surface of the foot-
stool. Holes in the four corners of the false bottom appear to have been used to 
tie the cushion into the cavity by tapes attached to the corners of the cushion.
	
The State Furniture of Ramesses iii
A rich collection of furniture that in its design surpasses that found in the 
tomb of Tutankhamun was rendered in paint and carved in relief in the tomb 
of Ramesses iii (kv 11) and at his temple at Medinet Habu. Unfortunately, the 
furniture paintings in kv 11, which were found in side chamber Cg (right wall, 
lower part; front wall, left part), have been destroyed. However, the quality of 
these wall paintings can be seen through the attempts to record them by art-
ists who travelled in Egypt during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. André 
Dutertre (1753–1842) was one of those artists who, as a member of the Napole-
onic expedition to Egypt in 1798, were in the fortunate position of being able 
to record this evidence before its destruction. His artwork was subsequently 
engraved by Claude Joseph Pomel (1781–1839).9
These illustrations were published by Albert Racinet (1825–1893), together 
with examples of funerary beds and plain biers. Today, it is still possible to ob-
tain these illustrations in poster form, and they have inspired modern design-
ers to create replicas of the furniture of Ramesses iii. The thrones, footstools, 
beds, and funerary couches illustrated in the Racinet prints are also to be found 
as hand-colored engravings in a work by Ippolito Rosellini published between 
1832 and 1844.10 Two bed frames were originally depicted in the now-destroyed

scenes in side chamber Cg of the Ramesses iii tomb (kv 11). One bed frame 
had feline-shaped legs that together with the foot and side rails were painted 
yellow to simulate a gilt finish or gold plate. Two comparable bed frames were 
found in the tomb of Tutankhamun.11 One can see that pairs of dowels that 
have been capped, apparently with a gilt material, are used to secure the joints 
of the Ramesses iii bed frame. Placed on this bed frame is a thick mattress 
that is covered with a blue fabric. Sitting on the mattress is a gilt headrest, and 
below the bed is placed a set of three steps.
The other bed frame also had lion-shaped legs, but the frame had been 
painted brown to suggest a plain wooden frame; interestingly some gold deco-
rative plaques were placed where the end grain of the foot and head rail tenons 
would have been located. A comparable ebony bed frame was also deposited 
in the tomb of Tutankhamun.12 The drums below each foot of the Ramesses iii 
wooden bed frame are color washed to give the impression they were also en-
cased in gold foil or sheet. This technique of encasing the foot drums in gold is 
also used on Tutankhamun’s ebony bed frame. The elaborated furniture scenes 
originally illustrated in side chamber Cg of kv 11 suggest that this room may 
have acted as the depository for the pharaoh’s furniture.
It was quite rare to paint the chamber walls of royal tombs with illustrations 
of royal furniture. The quality of the work once found in the tomb of Ramesses 
iii can be judged by the small collection of furniture rendered as paintings 
that still can be seen in the tomb of Tausert (19th dynasty) and Setnakht (20th 
dynasty) (1198–1194 b.c.) (kv 14). On the wall of burial chamber J1 (lower level, 
right wall) are painted three chairs. The legs of the center chair (Plate 29.3) are 
fashioned in a feline form; the chair has a cushioned seat that extends to form 
the back support.
A further set of the furniture illustrated in the tomb of Ramesses iii was 
also published by the French traveller Frédéric Cailliaud (1789–1869).13 Cail-
liaud arrived in Egypt in 1815 and accompanied Muhammad Ali Pasha’s spon-
sored military expedition to the White Nile and into Nubia and Ethiopia. His 
­illustrations reinforce the accuracy of the artwork undertaken previously, and 
the two sets, together with surviving carved reliefs of similarly designed furni-
ture from Medinet Habu, provide us with an intriguing glimpse into the types

of which has buckled; these sheets were attached by small gold nails and gesso to the

The Furniture of the Ramesside Pharaohs
of thrones and chairs once used by Ramesses iii and members of the royal 
court.
One major piece of furniture found illustrated in both kv 11 and at Medinet 
Habu is a throne based upon the concept of a folding frame, which in reality 
could not have folded as it was rigidly attached to a solid panelled wooden seat, 
similar in arrangement to an example discovered in the tomb of Tutankha-
mun.14 However, Tutankhamun’s throne has legs terminating in carved goose 
heads inlaid with ivory and African ebony (Dalbergia melanoxylon), while the 
Ramesses iii examples have crossed legs that are feline in form.15 The throne 
depicted in kv 11 is similar in construction to that illustrated in the North 
­Tower, a form of “migdol” or fortified gatehouse, at Medinet Habu (Figure 29.1), 
from the third-floor, west wall of the pharaoh’s private quarters. Both thrones 
are shown to have a thick cushion that extends up and covers the backrest be-
fore rolling over the top back rail. The back support structure of both thrones 
is coved and supported by vertical slats. This arrangement gives the typical tri-
angulated form seen on New Kingdom chairs.

Set above the crossing of the legs of both thrones can be seen the front eleva-
tion of a cow’s head. However, on the kv 11 example the cow’s tail is shown in 
the foreground while on the Medinet Habu throne (Figure 29.1) the tail is hid-
den behind a circular disc, indicating that it extends down on the far side of 
the throne. The circular disc possibly formed part of the jointing mechanism 
of the throne’s sub-frame. The common constructional arrangement seen on 
both thrones suggests that this design was known to those working in stone 
and paint at both centers, confirming that design principles had been estab-
lished and were being rigorously followed by those artisans employed by Ra-
messes iii. The additional embellishments of the kv 11 throne, with its bound 
captives below the seat, would have been easier to achieve in paint and were 
not applied on the Medinet Habu example. It is clear that we are looking at a 
known piece of furniture.
Another throne illustrated in the kv 11 furniture scenes shows the legs paint-
ed blue, similar in color to the legs of a chair preserved in the Louvre Museum, 
Paris (E 2950),16 suggesting that furniture of this decorative type may be from a 
royal context. Interestingly, this type of finish to chair legs was not present on 
any of the furniture found in the earlier tomb of Tutankhamun.
Two additional thrones of similar construction are found, in the first in-
stance, painted in the tomb of Ramesses iii (kv 11), and secondly in carved 
relief form (Figure 29.2) from an earlier context within the temple at Beit el-
Wali (entrance hall, south wall, west half), dating to the reign of Ramesses ii. 
The throne illustrated in kv 11 has a panel below the seat that features the car-
touches of Ramesses iii, protected by an open-winged Horus. The Ramesses 
ii throne (Figure 29.2) has the typical arrangement of the Sema bound with 
papyrus and Upper Egyptian lily, a symbol of unification seen on a number of 
pieces of furniture from the tomb of Tutankhamun.17
Each throne has a lion’s head attached above the front leg. The example 
found on the Beit el-Wali throne (Figure 29.2) shows striking similarities to a 
pair of heads preserved in the World Museum, Liverpool (inv. nos. 1973.2.92–
1973.2.93). Each of these heads has a pair of holes in the flat surface below the 
neck, into which dowels had fit; these dowels, together with a layer of animal-
based glue, now darkened to a brown crystalline residue, would have fixed the 
heads to the side rails of the seat of a throne.

Two notable pieces of furniture that belonged to Tutankhamun have, or once had, this 
unification symbol incorporated into the construction below the seat: a chair, but with-
out the lion heads, je 62032, and the golden throne, je 62028. Killen, Ancient Egyptian

The Furniture of the Ramesside Pharaohs
During the 18th dynasty, round-legged stools were introduced in royal contexts, 
although there is no evidence that this form of leg was incorporated into chair 
or throne design during that period, and only one stool with rounded legs had 
been deposited in the tomb of Tutankhamun.18 However, by the Ramesside 
period the concept of constructing thrones and chairs with rounded legs was 
well understood. Interestingly, round-legged stools seen in Ramesside private 
tombs or in seated pair statues are used exclusively by women in the Rames-
side period. However, the use of such seating in a royal context was strictly 
reserved for the pharaoh. Whether this new direction in woodworking design 
and technology was driven by the introduction of woodturning or just an ex-
pansion of the existing knowledge of hand-rounding wood legs into round 
cross sections is discussed by the author elsewhere.19
The pharaoh’s throne illustrated in kv 11 (Plate 29.4), has rounded legs that 
are incised with a feathered pattern and bands of lily petal decoration. Below 
the thick, patterned cushion seat we can also see two rows of herringbone pat-
tern, indicating the method employed to string the seat. The artist has given

The modelling of the legs is accurately executed; superimposed on these 
legs the author has drawn the cross sections of the legs and the supporting 
braces. The back support of this throne is unusual, as the god Horus with his 
outstretched wings is perched above the rear legs of the throne, providing a 
symbolic statement of the protection that Horus gave to his representative on 
earth. Whether the figure of Horus was carved in wood or another material is 
unknown. In the Petrie Museum, London, a similar Horus figure (uc 27894) 
has been delicately carved from ivory and has splinters of wood on its flat back 
surface, indicating that it had been glued to a wooden carcase and probably 
was a decorative furniture element.
Another round-legged stool (Figure 29.4) is also depicted at Medinet Habu, 
west of the vestibule in the north tower.20 The stretcher that braces the legs has 
its ends carved in the shape of papyrus flowers. These typically form part of the 
scribed tenon that fit into the mortise chopped in the round leg.
Analysis of the thrones that were designed and manufactured in the work-
shops of Ramesses iii provides a glimpse of a pivotal moment when carpen-
ters were capable of rounding wood accurately and prepared to incorporate 
this technique into some of the most impressive pieces of furniture manufac-
tured in the ancient world.
Chairs with round legs continued to be manufactured and used by the pha-
raoh throughout the Ramesside period. Another example (Figure 29.5) seen in 
a wall relief in the later tomb of Penniut at ‘Aniba, shows a seated Ramesses vi. 
This chair was shown to have a cushioned seat, which extends up to form the 
backrest of the chair. The supporting latticework arrangement below the seat 
is made from two horizontal stretchers and three vertical supports braced with 
a pair of angled braces.21
A rare scene of Ramesses iv seated on a throne protected by the wings of 
the goddess Maۢet is found on the stele of the royal butler Hori.22 This throne 
has feline-shaped legs and a solid back support with a moulded top rail at 
shoulder height. Like the chair from the tomb of Penniut, it has an arrange-
ment of three vertical struts enclosed by a pair of diagonal struts jointed below 
the side seat rail; here they are fastened into a single horizontal bracing rail. 
The legs of this throne stand on tall drums that deliberately elevate the seat 
height; to compensate for the increased seat height, the pharaoh rests his feet 
on a footstool.

The Furniture of Queen Nefertari
A small number of pieces of furniture are illustrated in the tomb of Queen 
Nefertari in the Valley of the Queens (qv 66). The most significant vignette 
shows the queen seated on a chair playing senet.23 The gaming board is placed 
on a stand that is made from thin elements of timber that have apparently been 
gessoed; the stands’ joints are reinforced with red colored twine. A jar stand of 
similar construction is seen in Chamber G, north wall; the scene shows that 
this stand has been modified to hold a large water jar. The flat bottom of the 
water jar is seen beneath the opening made in the top surface of the stand.24
The queen’s chair frame has been painted black, suggesting that this was 
made from African ebony, while the metal shells that encase both of the legs 
at the seat rails joint are engraved with a crisscross pattern. It is difficult to es-
tablish whether the elaborate colored design below the seat is an integral part 
of this chair. It is possible that this design indicates a quilted fabric drape or a 
fixed board that has been inlaid with colored glass or stone. Another possibil-
ity is that the artist is showing us how the surface of the seat was finished. The 
seat of the golden throne from the tomb of Tutankhamun was inlaid with 2,100 
square pieces of gold, calcite, and faience.25

In another vignette, the queen lies within her mummy case on a funerary 
couch.26 The wooden elements of the couch frame are rendered in black paint, 
suggesting that it was manufactured from African ebony. The feline head at-
tached above the front leg of the couch is precisely drafted and, together with 
the other fittings, painted yellow to replicate a metal finish. The feline-shaped 
legs of the couch are placed on metal drums, and the curved tail that extends 
from the hindquarter of the couch’s rear leg arches over the footboard and the 
lower half of the queen’s mummy case.
A scene in Chamber G shows the queen offering cloth to the god Ptah, which 
is placed on a table (Figure 29.6). Below the table top is a ribbed cavetto cor-
nice with a torus moulding. The under-frame is made from substantial sections 
of timber. The shoulder lines of the mortise-and-tenon joints employed in the 
design of the table are clearly defined, allowing for the method of construction 
to be examined. As with modern practice, the shoulders of the bracing bar 
placed between the legs are vertical, while the shoulders at the top of each leg 
are set horizontally. This arrangement allows for the orientation of each tenon, 
which springs at right angles to the shoulder, to locate in a mortise chopped 
in the side grain of the opposing element. Curved decorative braces are added

to the inner parts of the frame, shown with a ribbed pattern applied to them, 
softening the rectangular primary function of the construction.
Schiaparelli discovered a small wooden shabti box lid during his excavation 
of qv 66.27 In construction and decoration this shabti box lid is not as fine as 
one might expect for a royal burial. It consists of strips of timber attached to 
two semicircular timber end plates; the edges of the wooden strips have been 
mitred with a series of coopered joints to create a curved surface. This has been 
coated with a gesso ground and then painted with bands of green, blue, and 
red paint. The gesso foundation is used to border and separate each colored 
band. A line of black hieroglyphic text is painted on a yellow band along the 
top of the lid. The semicircular ends are similarly coated in gesso and then 
painted with radiating concentric semicircles using the same colors applied 
to the lid.
The illustrations of royal furniture seen in kv 11 and at Medinet Habu con-
firm the type of furniture used by Ramesses iii; interestingly, identical pieces of 
furniture can be identified in depictions from the two centers. The uniqueness 
of these pictorial representations suggests known pieces. The use of a folding 
frame type of construction that in reality was built around a fixed frame is 
known from an extant example found in the tomb of Tutankhamun. Of greater 
significance are the illustrations of round-legged thrones, of which no extant 
example survives from Egypt. Although several depictions of Ramesses ii seat-
ed on a round-legged stool are seen in a number of temple scenes, other males 
from both royal and private areas of Ramesside society appear to have been 
restricted from using this form of seating.

Excavated Roman Jewelry: The Case of the Gold 
Body Chains
Meredith Nelson
Ancient jewelry is both a fascinating and frustrating source of study.1 On the 
one hand, the craftsmanship, materials, and beauty of the works offer a cap-
tivating and attractive research subject. On the other, the high portability of 
these objects, along with their preservation and use across generations, often 
makes it difficult to determine dates and places of manufacture, in addition 
to more complex issues relating to status, wealth, and social significance.2 
Further compounding these difficulties is the high volume of unexcavated, 
looted jewelry on the antiquities market and in private and public collections. 
Much like Sherlock Holmes, who solved his mysteries from seemingly insig-
nificant details, such as powder on a sleeve cuff or an odd behavioral tic, the 
art historian is compelled to look to the object directly—at details of style, 
technique, and materials—in order to fit the piece within larger typological, 
­chronological, and regional frameworks. The popularity of styles across long 
periods of time, however, often leads to arbitrary assessments.3 Additional 
complications ­result when unexcavated, unprovenienced objects are used as 
sources for comparison, further muddying the stylistic waters.4 The result is a 
canon of ancient jewelry that is plagued with misidentified objects and mod-
ern forgeries.
The jewelry produced and consumed across the Roman Empire is not ex-
empt from these issues, particularly due to the large volume of unexcavated 
Roman metalwork in collections today. This has led scholars to pursue other 
avenues of inquiry in order to better reconstruct Roman tastes for adornment. 
Literary sources, including legal codes, social histories, encyclopedias, and pre-
served inscriptions help to illustrate the materials and forms popular during

Excavated Roman Jewelry: The Case of the Gold Body Chains
the Roman period. Some of these, such as Pliny’s Natural History, record the 
development and use of jewelry types, such as the finger ring.5 Other accounts 
are more anecdotal and critical, revealing underlying cultural attitudes. Juve-
nal, after describing the fashion for pearl earrings and emerald necklaces, in-
famously sniffs, “there is nothing more intolerable than a wealthy woman.”6
These resources are beneficial in understanding Roman fashions, but they 
are far from unequivocal. At times it remains difficult to link terminology used 
by ancient authors to jewelry forms preserved in the archaeological record.7 
Catherine Johns has also noted the obstacles in relating written evidence pro-
duced in the vicinity of Rome to the material evidence from the farther reaches 
of the Empire.8 Nevertheless, contemporary textual sources are an important 
tool for the art historian in establishing popular jewelry types in the Roman 
period, helping to address broader issues regarding adornment and social and 
cultural identities.
Depictions in art are also of great value, particularly in terms of understand-
ing how certain pieces of jewelry were displayed on the body. Wall paintings, 
mosaics, terracotta and bronze statuettes, coins, and other articles can be  
highly informative in revealing the regional trends in material goods during dif-
ferent periods. Notable examples are the mummy portraits from Egypt, which 
preserve images of the deceased along with important details of their clothing, 
hairstyles, and jewelry. These panel paintings demonstrate the simultaneous 
use of multiple necklaces of different lengths and styles, along with earrings, 
hairpins, bracelets, and other items.9 Such images help provide a visual link be-
tween the written sources and the preserved objects, and, in the case of Roman 
Egypt, document the ubiquity of diverse jewelry forms across the Empire.10
In addition, there are the scientifically excavated works, which unfortu-
nately represent the minority of pieces in collections today. The archaeologi-
cal context of these objects provides crucial information regarding production, 
circulation, and use of jewelry, contributing to general knowledge of trade, 
cultural exchange, fashion, taste, and status. It should be noted that many of 
the excavated pieces available from the Roman period come from the Vesu-
vian region. This could perhaps provide a somewhat restricted view of Roman

­jewelry, heavily influenced by material from Italy with a terminus ante quem of 
a.d. 79. However, comparisons of these items with other excavated, contempo-
rary pieces of jewelry from other regions have helped to create a more cohesive 
picture of broader trends and styles.11
All these resources provide important evidence in the case of one particu-
larly enigmatic type of Roman object: the body chain or catena. A pertinent 
clue was uncovered in the excavation of a house on the Via dell’Abbondanza in 
Pompeii: a marble statuette, standing just over 2 feet tall, representing ­Venus in 
the act of removing her sandal, supported on her left by Priapus and, beneath 
her raised foot, by a tiny Eros (Plate 30.1).12 What is striking about the work, 
however, is not the composition, but rather the details of the goddess’s attire 
articulated in applied gilding. This highlights her sandals and pubic region, 
as well as her armlets, bracelets, necklace, and an eye-catching body chain. 
Embellished with a central jeweled medallion, the chain crisscrosses her nude 
midriff, below an ornate, brassiere-like garment. This last feature has won the 
sculpture the name “Bikini Venus.” However, much more intriguing is her elab-
orate catena.
At first glance, this piece of jewelry looks curious enough that one might 
be tempted to relegate it to the realm of artistic fantasy or visual trope. And 
perhaps this would be the case if not for the fact that a small number of these 
catenae are preserved, forming a group that is further unique in that almost all 
the extant examples originate from excavated contexts. Despite these consid-
erations, these pieces have not been adequately studied. The majority of past 
research presents the catenae in a straightforward, cursory way, acknowledging 
the rarity of the form and offering brief descriptions of the pieces and how the 
chains were generally worn crossing the torso. Such descriptions are often aug-
mented with several frequently cited illustrations of the catenae in art, many 
of which portray the goddess Venus, who seems to be associated with the form, 
wearing the chain. Beyond this simple identification and contextualization, 
however, there is little deeper research into the nature of objects themselves.
Catherine Johns offers the most extensive discussion of the jewelry type, in 
relation to the body chain from the Hoxne hoard, discovered in 1992 in Suffolk, 
11	
Scholarship has only recently begun to focus on excavated works across contexts as an 
important source of comparative study. Andrew Oliver’s short survey of excavated ­Roman 
jewelry represents an important step toward acknowledging the issue and building a 
­canon of securely attributed pieces. See Oliver, “Roman Jewelry.”

England.13 She is the only scholar to address the question of how the Hoxne 
catena was actually worn on the body and how the fit of the chain relates to 
representations of catenae in art. She also reconstructs the chain on an actual 
model bust, establishing its original appearance. Based on her analysis of the 
catena’s form, her study considers the possible social significance of the jew-
elry type in late Roman Britain, moving beyond its basic affiliation with Venus. 
Her close attention to the chain’s design, construction, display on the body, 
and cultural meaning serves as a prime example for how these objects should 
be critically approached.
Indeed, when considering Johns’s detailed discussion of the Hoxne body 
chain, it becomes apparent that the surviving Roman catenae are in no way as 
clearly understood, either in terms of their form or context, as previous schol-
arship has implied. The new analysis presented here will review the design of 
the individual catenae, the histories of their study, and their location in the 
archaeological record. This will be done in an attempt to understand how the 
chains were physically arranged on the body, how the extant pieces may relate 
to depictions in art, and what, if anything, the contexts of these objects re-
veal about their use. In some cases, this study will outline incongruities in past 
scholarship, which complicate the designation of certain pieces as catenae. It 
is hoped, however, that a firmer understanding of these individual examples 
will aid in a broader awareness of the general design of the jewelry type and 
how they were worn by the Roman women who owned them. I am pleased 
to dedicate this brief study to Oscar White Muscarella, whose scholarship has 
aptly demonstrated the rapport between art history and detective work, par-
ticularly in the field of ancient jewelry.
	
The Catenae
The word catena, which means “chain” in Italian, has been applied to ancient 
body chains by modern scholars, based on Pliny the Elder’s use of the Latin 
term catena in his Natural History, written ca. a.d. 77–79. In his discussion of 
gold jewelry worn by women, Pliny notes “discurrant catenae in circa latera.”14 
Linguists have translated this phrase in several ways, and there is no clear un-
derstanding as to what exactly Pliny is describing. Rackham, for example, inter-
prets the phrase as “let gold chains run at random round their waists,”15 while

Bostock and Riley’s edition of the text reads poetically as “let chains of gold run 
meandering along their sides.”16 Alluding to this passage, Andrew Oliver com-
ments, “Pliny remarks that women let gold chains … run in several directions 
around their side.”17 What is clear from the original Latin is that the author is 
referring to ornamental gold chains that bear some relationship to the upper 
torso, either running down, along, or around the waist or sides. This particular 
case is a prime example of the aforementioned difficulties in relating ancient 
terminology to extant objects. Are the surviving chains the catenae that Pliny 
describes? He makes no mention of the chains crossing the torso or how ex-
actly they were worn on the body. The interpretation of latera as waist could 
imply that the gold chains were wrapped, belt-like, around the midriff, while 
the use of the word “sides” gives a different impression entirely. With no addi-
tional information offered, the connection remains tenuous; however, modern 
scholarship has fixed the term to these chains to an extent that it ­cannot now 
be avoided.18
Past discussions of catenae have added to the confusion because of the lack 
of a standardized way of describing the extant pieces. Often, a single measure-
ment is listed as the “length” of the chain, with no clear reference to what this 
number reflects.19 Descriptions are also often reproduced across publications, 
repeating errors or misidentified elements. Bosses are interpreted as clasps or 
clips with no mention if there is physical evidence to suggest they functioned 
as such. At times, the term “bandolier” is used in place of catena, making it un-
clear if the chain was worn diagonally across the upper body, or if the scholar 
is using the word as a descriptive term to indicate that the chains crossed the

Just when the term catena came to be affiliated with the jewelry form is unclear. Found in 
1877, the ivy leaf chain from Pompeii is the first of the group to be excavated; however, it 
was uncovered in two fragments, leading scholars to identify it as two separate necklaces 
for several decades after its discovery. The Boscoreale chain is identified as a catena in the 
1899 publication of the Boscoreale treasure, indicating that the association was in place 
at that time. It is likely that the term became linked with the jewelry form in scholarship 
on Pliny’s text or in studies of the chain’s representation in art, although just when this 
occurred is not clear. For the ivy leaf chain, see Spinazzola, Le arti decorative, 34, plate 226.

For the sake of clarity, in this study all lengths noted represent the measurement along 
the entire loop, from one end to the other if made from a single length of chain, or com-
parable to the circumference of a circle if made as a continuous loop. The measurement 
is representative of the length of the loop and will not combine the lengths of both chains 
in the case of the double-loop type.

torso. The present study will advance a consistent means of discussing these 
objects in order to achieve a degree of uniformity in documentation of the 
catenae, facilitating a more cohesive understanding of how they were designed 
and constructed.
The preserved examples reveal that there are apparently three forms the 
catenae take, which may serve as a useful guide in categorizing the chains. The 
first and most prevalent type takes the form of a double loop. This consists of 
two chains, which are attached to two bosses or decorative ornaments, located 
at opposite ends of the loop. One of these elements is sometimes moveable 
along the chains, while the other is fixed in place. There are no clasps or hooks, 
and the chains cannot be detached from one another. Examples of this type 
can be found in the Oplontis and Boscoreale catenae and possibly the Pompeii 
ivy leaf chain (Plates 30.2–30.5).
The second type of catena consists of a long length or loop of chain with one 
or two bosses and a crescent pendant. The most complete example preserved, 
thought to be from Pompeii, has two bosses, one fixed at one end of the chain 
and one moveable along the chain, as well as a moveable crescent pendant. 
The fixed boss serves as a clasp, hooking into a small ring on the opposite end 
of the long chain. This type may be termed a wheel-and-crescent catena (or 
catena with crescent pendant). Two examples are considered here: the chain 
attributed to Pompeii mentioned above and a smaller variant from Hercula-
neum (Plates 30.6–30.7).
The Hoxne chain represents its own particular type of catena and is later 
than the other examples considered here, dated to the late 4th century a.d. 
(Plates 30.8–30.9). It is reminiscent of the double-loop form, with chains fixed 
to central medallions at front and back. Unlike the double-loop catenae, how-
ever, four shorter chains are utilized, with terminals and links for attachment 
at both ends of each chain, allowing them to be secured to the medallions.
Given the design differences between these types of catenae, it is clear 
that each had its own method of application. Simple experimentation reveals 
that the double-loop chain is the easiest to put on, perhaps indicating that it 
was the canonical type. The wearer can pull the double chain over her head 
and down around to the waist. She can then thread her arms through the top 
chains on both sides, pulling these chains up over her right and left shoulders, 
while leaving the bottom chains draped down at her sides. If the catena is too 
tight to enable it to be pulled down to the waist, one can position it around 
the neck, pulling one’s arms through the chains on the right and left sides and 
adjusting it into place.
The wheel-and-crescent type is more complicated, due to the addition of 
the crescent pendant, and will be explained in detail below. In essence, the 

Nelson
620
end of the long chain is threaded through a loop at the back of the moveable 
boss and then hooked to the fixed boss at the other end of the chain, creating 
a double loop. The catena is then put on as described above, and a short length 
of chain is pulled out from one shoulder and looped around the neck.
While these reconstructions appear to be fairly straightforward, decorative 
or design elements often complicate the interpretation of how these chains 
were worn, as will become apparent in the individual cases. Currently, seven 
good candidates for Roman catenae are preserved, addressed here as the sub-
ject of this study.20 Six of these come from the Vesuvian region, dating from 
the first century b.c. or the first century a.d. The Hoxne catena, as indicated 
above, was found in Britain and dates to the late Roman period.21
	
Oplontis
Two double-loop type catenae were uncovered at Oplontis from the same ar-
chaeological context (see below). The first (Plate 30.2) consists of two gold 
loop-in-loop chains formed from large, flat links that are pinched at one end, 
creating a teardrop shape. Connecting these chains are two gold bosses at op-
posite ends of the loop. Each boss is formed from a central, convex dome that 
is framed by flat, circular border. The border is decorated with two rows of gold 
beaded wire, between which is a filigree design of two undulating lines that 
appear to mimic the loop-in-loop form of the chains. At the back of each boss 
are four small rings, to each of which an end of chain is attached, fixing both 
bosses in place.22 The catena was found with a break in one of the chains, with 
several links missing. At some point, it appears to have been reconstructed, as 
it appears complete in De Carolis and D’Ambrosio’s 1997 catalogue of Vesuvian 
jewelry.23 The length around the entire (double) loop is 139.6 cm.
The second catena from Oplontis is similar in design, although finer and more 
delicate in its execution (Plate 30.3). The two loop-in-loop chains are formed 
from small gold links that are more three-dimensional in their ­rendering than

A gold catena in the British Museum said to be from Assiut in Egypt is an early Byzantine 
example, with two openwork medallions preserved. However, this piece is unexcavated 
and dated to ca. a.d. 600. It stands as a beautiful example of the continued use of the 
form into the early Middle Ages, although it falls beyond the scope of this study. See Cor-
mack and Vassilaki, Byzantium, cat. 126.

Excavated Roman Jewelry: The Case of the Gold Body Chains
their flatter counterparts cited above. The chains are connected to two gold 
bosses on opposite ends, as with the previous example. Each boss has a central 
raised dome surrounded by a flat, decorative border. The inner and outer edges 
of the border are raised; between these runs a single circle of gold beaded wire. 
At the back of one boss are four rings, to which the four ends of the two chains 
are attached, holding the boss in place.24 The other boss, however, has two 
large rings at the back, allowing the two chains to run freely through them and 
permitting the boss to travel along the chains. This catena is approximately the 
same size as its companion, with a length along the (double) loop of 134 cm.
Just how these particular adornments would have appeared on the body is 
suggested by two preserved representations of women wearing catenae. One of 
these, a painting of Mars and Venus from the House of the Marriage of Hercu-
les at Pompeii, is regularly referenced in scholarly literature.25 In the scene, the 
deity wears a delicate gold catena that crosses over her bare torso. The chains, 
ornamented with small, dangling pendants, seem to be twisted around each 
other as they run between her breasts. Close examination reveals a small cir-
cular element, similar to those on the Oplontis catenae, in the area where the 
chains intersect.
A notably different type of scene shows a catena that seems to have this 
same central ornament. A wall painting from the Suburban Baths at ­Pompeii 
illustrates a nude woman and a clothed man engaged in cunnilingus. The 
­woman wears a delicate body chain that meets just beneath her breasts. A 
small dot of pigment where the chains intersect across her torso could repre-
sent a decorative boss.26
These paintings demonstrate how one of the decorative bosses of a double-­
loop catena must have appeared at the front of the body, as shown also in 
the sculpture of the “Bikini Venus,” but they leave the question of the second 
boss unanswered. The presence of two decorative bosses on each double-loop 
­catena suggests that a sort of symmetry was effected at front and back, particu-
larly if one ornament could be moved into place. In the visual comparanda, 
which typically show frontal views, only one such ornament, if any, is depicted, 
usually located between or just below the breasts. Can it be assumed that a 
matching ornament was present on the back?27 It is difficult to imagine how 
24	
D’Ambrosio illustrates only the back of the movable boss with two rings. However, he 
notes in the catalogue entry that the other boss has four rings to which the chains are 
fixed. D’Ambrosio, Gli ori di Oplontis, cat. 11, plate 8.

The catena of the aforementioned “Bikini Venus” (Plate 30.1) might possibly have had a

the catenae with fixed bosses were worn otherwise. Indeed, the reconstruction 
of the Hoxne chain with its two central medallions precludes any other ar-
rangement. If the double-loop chains were designed to display an ornament in 
the front and back, the position of the back element is another consideration. 
Provided the chain is long enough, it is possible to pull down the front of the 
catena so that the central boss falls below the breasts, around the navel. The 
result is that the boss at the back, located at the area of intersection of the two 
chains, is pulled higher, almost up to the base of the neck. As will be discussed 
in relation to the Herculaneum chain, this area of the body was often used to 
display medallions or decorative clasps.
Both of the Oplontis catenae were discovered in excavations at Villa B in 
the 1984–1985 field season.28 The chains were reported to have been found in 
Room 10 of the villa, in which the skeletal remains of 54 people were recov-
ered.29 These individuals presumably had gathered in the room to await rescue, 
­bringing their treasured belongings with them. Both of the gold ­catenae were 
associated with skeleton 27, an individual who, rather confusingly, has been 
identified as the potential (male) proprietor of the villa due to the amount 
of money and other valuables found with the body.30 The sex of the skeleton, 
however, is not specified in the report, and it is unclear how this determination 
was made.
One chain is said to have been found around the individual’s neck (Plate 30.3) 
and one at his or her hip (Plate 30.2).31 No detailed excavation report from this 
season at Oplontis has been published, however, and the exact position of the 
objects in relation to the body is not illustrated. D’Ambrosio provides a brief 
overview of the season’s finds in the Rivisita di studi pompeiani, only noting 
some of the more important discoveries from the excavation. In relation to 
skeleton 27, he does not describe the catenae in detail, instead citing only a 
single gold necklace, which could possibly represent one of these chains. Inter-
estingly, he does mention a gold bracelet bearing an image of Venus and Eros 
found with the same individual. This could perhaps indicate a personal con-
nection of the deceased with the goddess Venus, expressed both by the bracelet 
ascertained from photographs. From the traces of gilding visible at the rear, her catena 
appears to have been configured somewhat differently, with the upper chains crossing 
high on the back and possibly running over the shoulders to attach to the brassiere top at 
the front. See Plate 30.1, right, for a partial back view of the sculpture.

and the two catenae.32 The relation of the chains to the body is first mentioned 
by D’Ambrosio in his 1987 publication Gli ori di Oplontis, which serves as a cata-
logue for the jewelry recovered from the site. Presumably, this specific infor-
mation comes from unpublished excavation records. Unfortunately, the lack 
of published documentation on the finds makes it difficult to interpret what 
the archaeological context of the catenae could potentially reveal in relation to 
questions of use and display. Specifically, one wonders whether the catena that 
was discovered around the neck of skeleton 27 was perhaps thrown on in a mo-
ment of panic, or if it was actually worn this way. D’Ambrosio’s catalogue does 
not list either chain as a catena, perhaps indicating that their arrangement on 
the body was not suggestive of this use.33 However, given the design of the 
double chains and their length, it is reasonable to assume that they did indeed 
function as catenae, and they are identified as such in later scholarship.34
	
Boscoreale
The chain uncovered at Boscoreale is another double-loop type catena 
(Plate 30.4). Two gold loop-in-loop chains are joined together by two decora-
tive elements, in this case taking the form of wheels.35 At the center of each 
wheel is a small bead-shaped hub, framed by a raised edge. Radiating from 
this edge are eight spokes of beaded wire. The spokes meet the inner edge of 
the wheel rim, which is made of beaded wire; beyond this is a circle of plain 
wire and an outer circle of beaded wire that forms the edge of the wheel. On 
the back of one wheel are four small rings, to each of which a chain is fixed. 
The other wheel is moveable, having two larger rings through which the two 
sets of chains pass freely. The length of the catena along the (double) loop is 
approximately 145 cm. There is only a slight difference in the length of each 
loop (1 cm) noted by scholars, despite one of the chains having 12 more links

35	
Wheel and crescent motifs, both of which are commonly found together in catenae and 
other Roman necklaces, are thought to be associated with love magic. Earlier Greek iynx 
wheels were used in magical rites to evoke love and erotic desire. This same association 
continued into the Roman period, evidenced by a wall painting of Mars’s seduction of Ve-
nus in the House of Punished Love at Pompeii. In the scene, Eros spins a small wheel on a 
chain while the seduction takes place. Given the affiliation of this wheel with the goddess 
Venus, the presence of the motif on catenae is appropriate. See Nelson, “Iynx-Wheel.”

than the other.36 Surely the Boscoreale chain was worn in a manner similar to 
that of the two Oplontis examples, with one wheel element in front and the 
other positioned at the back. This relates the Boscoreale catena to the two wall 
paintings previously cited.
Despite the early date of the chain’s discovery and identification, there is 
little in-depth scholarship on the piece beyond a general discussion of the cat-
ena form.37 No technical information has been published beyond the initial 
description of the work. What is most difficult to establish about this partic-
ular catena, however, is not its construction or form, but rather its archaeo-
logical context. Although Oliver includes the chain in his survey of excavated 
­Roman jewelry, to call the discovery of the Boscoreale material an excavation 
is a loose application of the term. “Le trésor de Boscoreale,” published in 1899, 
has the first discussion of the piece.38 In that publication, produced by the 
L’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in Paris, the items listed, includ-
ing the ­catena, were said to have been purchased by the administration of 
the Musées ­Nationaux in 1896, several months before the installation of the 
­famous silver tableware from the same site, acquired by Baron de Rothschild. 
The chain and other pieces of jewelry were bought from Vincenzo de Prisco, 
the owner of the land on which part of the Boscoreale villa had been uncov-
ered. The villa was discovered some decades earlier in 1876, and excavations 
were begun. However, work was suspended when it was found that the com-
plex continued onto property owned by the de Prisco family, who at the time 
did not wish to excavate their land. In 1894 Vincenzo de Prisco, then owner of 
the property, decided to resume excavation work on his own, revealing more 
of the compound, ­including utilitarian spaces for the production of olive oil 
and wine. On April 13, 1895, however, under the threat (or pretense) of poi-
sonous gas, an excavator named Michele suspended work and sent the other 
diggers away. Joined by de Prisco, the two men furtively entered the site and 
discovered a skeleton with silver vases, coins, and pieces of jewelry, including 
a double gold chain.39 These objects were clandestinely and illegally exported 
out of Italy by de Prisco and sold to Baron de Rothschild and the administra-
tion of the Musées Nationaux.
Given these circumstances, the exact nature and location of the find are 
nearly impossible to discern. The room in which the treasure was found

Excavated Roman Jewelry: The Case of the Gold Body Chains
has alternately been termed a wine cellar,40 a torcularium, or a cistern.41 
­Furthermore, it is unclear if the objects were indeed associated with a skeleton 
or, as often suggested in subsequent scholarship, if they formed part of a hoard 
hidden by the owner of the property prior to the eruption of Vesuvius.42 In ad-
dition, the relationship of the jewelry to the silver tableware cannot be clearly 
established. If human remains were indeed present in the same context as the 
jewelry, the positioning of the catena in relation to the body was lost, along 
with any potential information that could relate to the chain’s use or display.43
	
Pompeii
Despite the fact that it was excavated in 1877 and is well represented in studies 
of Roman jewelry from the Vesuvian region, the ivy leaf catena from Pompeii is 
one of the more difficult pieces to interpret (Plate 30.5). This chain, recovered 
in two fragments, consists of 94 ivy leaves, delicately rendered in sheet gold 
with five raised lines indicating veins at the center of every individual leaf. At 
the tip of each leaf is a tiny link that connects it to a small ring at the base of 
the adjoining leaf. This link is partially hidden by a small gold globule posi-
tioned at the tip of the leaf, although many of these have been subsequently 
lost. At the midpoint of each of the two fragments is a large gold boss in the 
shape of a plain, convex dome. The length listed is 103 cm, which is the length 
of the (double) loop if the piece is reconstructed as a double-loop chain, as can 
be confirmed by adding together the lengths of the individual leaves.44

De Villefosse recounts the discovery of the treasure as told to him by de Prisco. In his 
account, a skeleton, described as male, was found with the catena, four bracelets, a ring, 
pendant earrings, fragments of silver possibly belonging to a tray, and coins by his sides. 
Other pieces of silverware found in the same location were wrapped in fabric and heaped 
at the back of the cistern. Even if we are to take de Prisco’s word for the arrangement of 
the silver and jewelry, the exact distribution of the finds is not recorded or illustrated, 
providing little substantive information on the relationship of the objects to one another 
and the human remains. See de Villefosse, “Le trésor de Boscoreale,” 29–30.

Cantilena, et al., Le collezioni del museo nazionale, cat. 46. Oddly, despite the striking use 
of the motif in this chain, the iconography of ivy leaves is generally overlooked in scholar-
ship on the piece. While ivy is more often associated with the god Bacchus, a small pen-
dant earring from Roman Paestum featuring Eros wearing a garland made of ivy leaves 
perhaps demonstrates a connection between the plant and the goddess of love. Thus, the 
presence of this motif would be appropriate given the affiliation of the catena form with 
Venus.

The two chain fragments were discovered with four skeletons in Regio ix, 
Insula 4. Unfortunately, the bodies could not be reconstructed in gesso ­because 
of their location between the layers of ash and stone.45 Information regard-
ing the sex of the deceased is therefore lost. The excavation report notes only 
that the catena, along with several other pieces of jewelry, was discovered next 
to the skeletons. As is typical of early excavations, there is no detailed descrip-
tion or illustration of the position of the chain fragments in relation to the 
individuals or other recovered objects.
The classification of this catena is not easily made, due to the broken chain 
and the lack of information regarding the appearance of the back of the large 
bosses. One could easily reconstruct the two segments as a large, single-loop 
chain, attaching the free ends of the fragments, which would result in the 
domes’ being located at opposite ends of the loop. A single-loop chain could 
be worn as a catena, by pulling the chain out at the ends, twisting it at the cen-
ter, and then bringing the two ends together to form double loop. In the case 
of the ivy leaf chain, however, twisting the chain in order to create the inter-
section would disrupt the pattern of the ivy leaves, and the bosses would not 
be positioned correctly. It seems more likely that the unattached ends were 
originally connected to the back of the bosses, forming a double-loop catena. 
This interpretation, however, is largely dependent on what is preserved on the 
back of the bosses, which is not discussed in scholarship on the piece. In any 
case, this chain was worn by a very small-framed woman.
Scholars have grappled with how to identify these two fragments since the 
time of their discovery. Early publications described the chains as two separate 
necklaces, with the clasps missing and each boss forming a kind of pendant.46 
Laura Breglia’s 1941 publication identifies the pieces as belonging to a single, 
long necklace, although she does not connect them to the catena form.47 Sub-
sequently, the object is described as a double chain, interpreted as a necklace 
with two rows of leaves, not a body chain. Adding further confusion, the sec-
ond boss is periodically glossed over in descriptions, making suggested recon-
structions problematic.48 Scholars have also interpreted the convex boss as a

For example, in the 1978 catalogue Pompeii a.d. 79, Ward-Perkins and Claridge state that 
both fragments are identical and theorize that a missing clasp must have linked the two 
chains behind the neck, forming a double chain necklace. Given the equal length of the 
fragments and the presence of two bosses, just how the pieces would be joined together 
in this way is difficult to understand. See Ward-Perkins and Claridge, Pompeii a.d. 79, 
cat. 52.

627
Excavated Roman Jewelry: The Case of the Gold Body Chains
clasp that is missing its hook, in one case even going so far as to suggest that 
the chain could have also served as a belt.49 Mieczyslawa Ruxer seems to be 
the first to designate the chain as a body chain, although she does not use the 
Latin name, calling it a “chain adorning the breast,” as translated from her Pol-
ish text.50 Lucia Stefanelli identifies the chain as a catena, specifically using 
Pliny’s term.51
Compounding the problem is the inconsistent way in which the two frag-
ments are shown in photographic illustrations. In many of the studies that 
mention this catena, only one fragment is shown. Sometimes the missing frag-
ment is acknowledged, but at other times it is not, although authors often list 
the total number of ivy leaves.52 The first full reconstruction is from the 1989 
catalogue of the collection at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples, al-
though it is identified as a double chain necklace rather than a catena.53 As pic-
tured, the assemblage has two rows of ivy leaves running in opposite directions 
from the two bosses. This same arrangement appears in the 2003 catalogue 
accompanying the exhibition Tales from an Eruption. The reconstruction, how-
ever, differs in that one of the ivy leaf chains appears to be traveling in the 
wrong direction.54 If one were to imagine the catena being worn (or indeed 
even if one were to imagine the piece as a double necklace) this errant chain 
would disrupt an otherwise attractive, symmetrical pattern. It is unclear if this 
is simply a mistake in the reconstruction, or if something is preserved on the 
back of the bosses indicating that this is how the piece should be assembled. 
It is tempting to identify the chain as a double-loop type catena, with the 1989 
photograph serving as a model of how it must have appeared. However, this 
cannot be asserted without an examination of the back of the convex domes 
to establish how the chain was originally constructed.
If this chain is indeed a double-loop catena, additional representations in 
art suggest how it would have fit on the body. While it is a good deal smaller 
than the Oplontis versions, a slender woman could certainly have worn it. 
Rather than draping loosely across her torso, the chain would have fit more 
snugly. Evidence of this kind of catena can be found in a wall painting of a 
nereid from the Villa d’Arianna at Stabiae.55 In this illustration, the sea nymph

wears a ­delicate body chain, attached tightly across her unclothed torso, cross-
ing between her breasts and falling just above her natural waistline.56 Another, 
explicitly erotic image can be found in a fresco from the House of the Vettii 
at Pompeii. This scene shows a male-female couple in coitus. The fully nude 
woman wears a fine gold catena that fits closely across her upper body, cross-
ing between the breasts and wrapping high around her waist.57 Both these ex-
amples contrast with the more loosely draped chains shown in the Pompeian 
Venus and Mars painting and the erotic scene from the Suburban Baths cited 
above.
Also attributed to Pompeii is a different type of body chain, which may be 
classified as a wheel-and-crescent catena, or catena with crescent pendant 
(Plate 30.6). This is made from a long, multiple loop-in-loop chain that forms 
a thick gold rope. The chain terminates at one end in a short, ribbed cylinder 
with a ring; at the other end is a similar cylinder and ring that is connected to a 
clasp in the shape of a wheel. This wheel is very similar to those on the Bosco-
reale catena. The hub is represented by a small boss with a tiny gold bead at 
the center. Eight spokes of gold beaded wire radiate from the hub. These con-
nect to the wheel itself, which is formed by three circles of gold wire: a circle of 
plain wire flanked by two circles of beaded wire, as with the Boscoreale wheels. 
On the opposite side of this wheel is another small ring or hook, to which the 
ring on the other end of the chain attaches.58 By hooking the loose end of the 
chain to the wheel-shaped clasp, one might produce a long, single loop. A sec-
ond, similar wheel is also present; this element is movable along the chain, al-
though how the back of the wheel is designed to achieve this is unclear. A small

sure, 26.

No back views of the wheel bosses on this chain have been published. However, it is clear 
that the free end of the chain was attached by some means to the wheel clasp at the oppo-
site end. Descriptions of the piece do not indicate whether the back of the wheel features 
a hook proper or a ring. Cantilena describes the connecting elements as hooks (gancetti), 
while the 1961 exhibition catalogue Ori e Argenti describes them as rings (anellini). See 
Cantilena, et al., Le collezioni del museo nazionale, cat. 64, and Palazzo Chiablese, Ori e 
argenti, cat. 526. If the means of attachment on the clasp is a ring, then the ring must be 
open so as to act as a hook. This is clear from several photographs of the catena that show 
the loose end of the chain attached to the wheel clasp. See, for example, Stefanelli, L’oro 
dei romani, 108–109.

lunula is thick in the middle, growing thinner at the ends, which are decorated 
with two small beads of granulation. Another two gold beads can be found at 
the base of the bale that attaches the crescent to the chain. In total, the length 
of the chain is 252 cm.
This chain is in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli, along with 
other finds from Pompeii (including the ivy leaf catena), suggesting that it 
could have come from an early excavation at the site. However, precise infor-
mation regarding its find spot is lacking in the scholarly literature. The earliest 
publication of the chain by Vittorio Spinazzola states that the piece is from 
Pompeii, although no evidence is given to support this claim.59
Prior scholarship has largely described this piece as a long necklace, without 
providing specifics on how one was to wear such a staggering length of chain.60 
Some scholars avoid the issue entirely by simply referring to it as a chain or 
rope, leaving the question of its use unclear.61 As with the ivy leaf chain, Ruxer 
appears to identify the piece as a catena, describing it as a “chain plaited adorn-
ing the bust,” although she does not use the Latin term.62 Stefanelli calls the 
chain a catena in her catalogue entry on the piece.63
The more puzzling question with regard to this chain is how it was actually 
worn. The manner in which a single loop could be twisted to form a catena has 
already been discussed. In this configuration, the chain would form a loosely 
draped catena. The thickness of the chain, however, complicates such a recon-
struction, as does the crescent pendant. If the wheels are to be arranged at the 
front and back of the wearer, where does the crescent lie? Crescent pendants 
were popular in the Roman period, appearing on necklaces across the Empire. 
Illustrations of the pendants are present in a wide variety of media, and extant 
examples are plentiful. Roman mummy portraits from Egypt indicate that the 
small lunulae were often worn on choker-style chains, close to the base of the 
neck.64 A funerary relief from Palmyra showing a woman wearing a necklace 
with crescent pendant confirms that this type was worn in the east as well.65 
Preserved examples, such as those from the Vesuvian area, attest to the choker 
style with the short length of their chains.66

Remarkably, such a choker necklace can be achieved with the wheel and 
crescent catena attributed to Pompeii. A double loop can be formed by thread-
ing the chain back through a ring at the rear of the movable wheel boss and 
then hooking the free end to the fixed wheel clasp. The chain can be put on as 
previously described, with the two bosses arranged at the front and the back. 
Once the straps are raised onto the shoulders, a length of chain may be pulled 
out from one shoulder and looped over the head and around the neck, effect-
ing a short necklace. The mobility of the pendant allows it to be positioned 
appropriately at the base of the neck. By unhooking the clasp once the catena 
is in place, it becomes easier to pull the chain around the neck. The clasp may 
then be rehooked at the back and fixed to the adjacent chain at the crossing. 
The crescent pendant and wheel clasp are the salient clues that point to the 
solution of this catena mystery.
There are numerous representations in the art of the Roman period show-
ing women pairing a body chain with a shorter necklace. In one exquisite ex-
ample, an ivory figure from Begram shows a female wearing a loose catena 
with a central rosette draped over her nude torso. While the rosette falls below 
her breasts, its position is mirrored higher up on her chest by a shorter neck-
lace with a plain, round pendant.67 While this does not replicate the crescent 
pendant from the Pompeian chain, the depiction does indicate how a necklace 
could be worn along with a body chain. The wheel-and-crescent catena rather 
ingeniously incorporates the appearance of two individual pieces of jewelry 
into a single design, artfully arranged by the wearer who would have known 
how to drape and loop the chain properly to create such an effect.
	
Herculaneum
The most recently excavated piece to be labeled a catena comes from Hercu-
laneum (Plate 30.7). It features a wheel clasp and crescent pendant attached 
to a single gold loop-in-loop chain. The delicate wire links are pinched slightly 
where they connect to the adjoining link. One end of the chain attaches to a 
ring connected to the gold wheel clasp. The wheel’s hub is formed from a plain 
convex dome, from which six spokes of beaded wire radiate out to join the rim. 
The rim is composed of inner and outer circles of plain wire, flanking a circle 
of beaded wire. The free end of the chain terminates in a hook, which attaches 
to the wheel clasp. Directly opposite the clasp on the other side of the loop is 
a small gold crescent pendent, fixed to an individual link; this pendant cannot 
move along the chain, unlike the crescent pendant on the catena attributed to 
Pompeii. The total length of the single-loop chain is 173 cm.

Excavated Roman Jewelry: The Case of the Gold Body Chains
The piece was uncovered in the 1992 excavations of fornix 8 at the Hercu-
laneum marina. In total, 23 bodies were uncovered in this area, representing a 
group of individuals who fled to the marina with their belongings to await res-
cue. The chain was discovered between skeletons 11 and 12, in a group of finds 
that included a pair of bracelets, five rings, a pair of earrings, and several items 
of silver tableware. The assemblage was probably contained in a box, perhaps 
wrapped in some kind of cloth bag.68 Unfortunately, this context provides no 
information regarding the way the chain was used by its owner.
In his discussion of the finds from the 1992 field season, de Carolis terms the 
chain a catena, likely because of its length. It is long enough to be worn by a 
slender woman as a double-loop catena, although it would have to be twisted 
into the form; it lacks the second, moveable wheel boss that would facilitate 
arranging it as a wheel-and-crescent catena in the manner of the chain attrib-
uted to Pompeii. While the catenae cited above all have two matching bosses, 
this chain has only one wheel and one crescent, and thus does not exhibit the 
symmetry of the other extant catenae. Moreover, the chain is not long enough 
to be worn as a double-loop catena with choker necklace, except by a very 
small woman, and even in this case it is difficult to see how the necklace might 
be accomplished because the crescent pendant is not movable but firmly at-
tached to a link of the chain.
It is possible the piece was worn crossing the body diagonally like a bando-
lier, extending from one shoulder to the opposite side.69 A depiction of this 
type of chain can be found in a painting of a banquet scene from the House 
of the Chaste Lovers in Pompeii, where a female reveler wears a silver-colored 
chain that runs across her nude torso, from her right shoulder to her left side, 
falling between her breasts.70 Similarly, a painting from the Villa d’Arianna at 
Stabiae illustrates the back of a nereid who, lounging astride a sea leopard, 
appears to be wearing a delicate gold bandolier chain running from her left 
shoulder down to her right side.71 Neither of these examples, however, shows 
a wheel boss or crescent pendant. If the Herculaneum chain was worn in this 
manner, a portion of the chain could have been looped around the neck to 
form a short necklace with the crescent pendant at the front.
Two similar chains were part of the so-called Backworth hoard acquired by 
the British Museum in the 19th century. These chains are very close in style to

the Herculaneum piece, although they are shorter, indicating that they could 
not have been used as body chains. On both chains, the crescent pendant is 
positioned closer to the wheel clasp rather than at the opposite end of the 
loop. This distribution allows the chain to be wrapped around the neck twice, 
with the crescent pendant in the front and the wheel clasp at the back.72 The 
back of the neck, where the clasp was placed, was thus seen as an appropriate 
location for a large, decorative ornament, with a smaller pendant placed at the 
front of the neck. A short necklace from Pompeii has a similar lunula pendant 
strung on a chain, with an impressive, uncut emerald in a gold bezel serving 
as the clasp.73 This is one of several extant Roman necklaces with elaborate 
clasps, indicating the importance of the back of the neck as an area for adorn-
ment. Considering the Backworth chains, the Herculaneum chain may also 
have been worn as a necklace, looped around the neck three times, with the 
crescent positioned at the front and the wheel clasp at the back.
	
Hoxne
The Hoxne catena, the final example to be considered here, is a double-loop 
chain of unique design (Plates 30.8–30.9). This catena has two central orna-
ments, one positioned in the front and one in the back. The frontal jeweled 
boss consists of a gold plaque set with a central cabochon amethyst, surround-
ed by four almond-shaped garnets and four empty circular cells, which pre-
sumably once held pearls.74 Four grooved rings extend out from the corners 
of the plaque, and an individual chain is attached to each of these rings. The 
back ornament features a gold solidus of the Roman emperor Gratian (r. a.d. 
367–383), minted in Trier in the early part of his reign. The coin is set into an 
octagonal gold frame that is decorated on the front face with a raised foliate 
motif. Gratian’s portrait faces out toward the front; at the back the open mount 
reveals the reverse of the solidus showing two enthroned emperors holding 
a globe, with a winged Nike at the rear. On the back of the mount are four 
grooved rings to which the individual chains attach. These are gold loop-in-
loop chains plaited to form flat straps. At the ends of the four chains are tubu-
lar cylinders to which lion’s-head terminals are fixed. From the mouth of each 
lion emerges a ring, joined to each of the grooved rings at the corners of the 
jeweled boss at the front of the catena and the frame of the coin at the back. 
In two cases, hooks extend from the rings at the lion’s mouth, attaching to the

back mount and allowing the catena to be put on with greater ease. At one 
point, the ends of the four chains at the back were attached to only two of the 
grooved rings of the coin mount,75 but the chain has now been reconstructed 
utilizing all four rings of the back mount (Plate 30.9).76 The Hoxne chain is 
smaller than the catenae cited above, with a total length of the double loop 
(including the front and back bosses) of 84 cm.77
This catena was uncovered as part of the hoard discovered in 1992 in a field 
at Hoxne in Suffolk, England. Buried in a box or chest, the entire assemblage 
contained a staggering number of gold, silver, and bronze coins along with 
over 200 pieces of impressive silver tableware and jewelry dating to the late 
­Roman period. Johns has surmised that, because of the lack of certain stan-
dard tableware items and more common types of jewelry, the cache represents 
only a fraction of the material wealth of the hoard’s owner.78
Johns discusses the appearance of this chain in relation to several repre-
sentations of catenae in art. Due to its size, she finds that the chain not only 
fit tightly, but must have been worn by someone of small stature, with a chest 
measurement no greater than 30–31 inches.79 For this reason, she proposes 
that the chain was worn by an adolescent female, in an appropriate context 
likely connected with Venus, specifically as a bride. This leads Johns to suggest 
that in certain circumstances the catena may have served more broadly as a 
kind of bridal jewelry.80
	
Body Chains: Clothed and Unclothed
In regard to how these chains were used, scholars have asserted that catenae 
were worn both by unclothed and clothed women, based on representations 
of body chains from the Roman period.81 Closer examination of the evidence, 
however, calls this theory into question. One “clothed” example is a Venus Ge-
netrix shown in a painting from Pompeii from the House of Marcus Fabius

Rufus (east wall, room 71). In the second-style painting, the goddess is shown 
wearing a loosely fitted body chain over a diaphanous, clingy tunic, with a 
purple mantle draped across her shoulders. She is also adorned with other 
pieces of jewelry including a diadem with a transparent, white veil. Eros, who 
accompanies her, also wears a small body chain.82 This is one of a very few 
representations showing a woman with a catena over her clothing, as opposed 
to being displayed on her bare torso, as all the previously cited examples il-
lustrate. It is uncertain if this truly represents how (or whether) these chains 
were worn over tunics in the period. Here the see-through drapery, like the 
body chain, only functions to accentuate the goddess’s nudity, which is plainly 
visible through the transparent material. Can one really consider this a repre-
sentation of a clothed female wearing a catena, particularly if her body is just 
as accessible to the viewer as though she were fully undressed?83
Perhaps the most oft-cited example from the Roman period of a clothed 
woman with a body chain is a terracotta statuette from Egypt.84 The female, 
whose identity is unknown, wears a pronounced catena with a large, central 
jewel between her breasts. This is placed over what appears to be a form-fitting 
tunic, whose pleat lines accentuate the voluptuous contours of her body. The 
articulation of her navel, however, indicates that the drapery is likely diapha-
nous, like that of the Venus Genetrix. In this case, her body is revealed through 
the clinginess and transparency of the tunic, emphasized further through the 
use of the catena, framing her breasts and hips.85
A clothed statue of Nike from the villa at Oplontis is also said to be wearing 
a catena.86 The deity has two broad straps crossing over her well-draped torso. 
The tight-fitting bands meet between her breasts, joining with a large, circu-
lar boss. It would seem, however, that these bands are not chains, but fabric. 
Furthermore, it appears that this particular statue is not a uniquely ­Roman

Pliny mentions the availability of diaphanous fabrics from China and their use by Roman 
women to reveal their bodies. In what form and in which contexts, however, is not clear. 
There seems to have been a certain amount of cultural backlash against the see-through 
garments. William Dunstan notes that the wearing of transparent fabric was associated 
with prostitution, making it incompatible with principles of Roman modesty. For Pliny’s 
discussion of diaphanous fabrics, see Natural History 6.20. See also Dunstan, Ancient 
Rome, 106.

type, but replicates a Hellenistic model.87 As a Roman version of a Greek 
original, this example cannot be taken to indicate the way such bands were 
worn in the Roman period. Rather, these straps seem to be the body bands 
that appear frequently in earlier Greek art, and which are distinctly different 
from the catenae worn by Venus and other nude or semi-nude females.88 Al-
though these Hellenistic bands are at times cited by scholars as pre-Roman 
examples of catenae,89 they do not seem to be directly related to the Roman 
body chains.
A mummy portrait of a young girl in the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift in Trier, 
dated to a.d. 96–117, is also referenced as a contemporary representation of a 
fully dressed woman wearing a catena (Plate 30.10).90 The portrait, which is un-
excavated, was purchased by the museum in 1983.91 The panel shows a young 
girl with popular types of Roman jewelry, including pearl pendant earrings and 
necklaces of gold and emerald beads. Most notably, she wears a body chain 
over a dark-colored, opaque tunic, with a mantle draped over her shoulders. 
The central medallion rests high on her chest, a marked departure from the 
representations that show the central ornament between or below the breasts. 
The upper chains of the catena run up to the base of her neck, rather than over 
her shoulders, while the lower chains cross her rib cage, well above her waist 
and hips.
At first glance, it would appear that this portrait shows exactly how a woman 
would have worn a body chain over her clothing in the Roman period. Closer 
inspection, however, reveals that this particular portrait is problematic. The 
articulation of the jewelry seems awkward in comparison with that of excavat-
ed mummy portraits of the period, which show great care in the rendering of 
individual elements and particular details, such as the reflection of light from 
pearls, gems, and gold. This discrepancy is especially apparent in the pearl ear-
rings, which are quickly painted with dashes of pigment, without the usual 
attention to form, such that the two earrings do not appear to match. Simi-
larly, the upper chain of the catena at the viewer’s left meets the girl’s shoulder 
clumsily. This hasty, imperfect execution seems incongruous considering the 
sensitivity of the girl’s features and expression, with light gently falling across

her nose and forehead to accentuate the contours of her face. Based on repre-
sentations of catenae in art, the odd angle of the chains, along with the high 
placement of the central medallion, seems to indicate that the artist was un-
aware of how this jewelry would have been worn on the body—an unlikely 
scenario if he was working from real life.
Comparison with the so-called Jewellery Girl, a well-known mummy por-
trait excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1911 at Hawara,92 indicates that the Trier 
portrait is likely modeled after this authentic work (Plate 30.11). When viewed 
together, the two portraits show marked similarities in several respects. Both 
sitters wear triple-pearl pendant earrings, emerald and gold necklaces, and 
gold chains. The Trier girl has a small, oblong shaped hairpin located to the 
viewer’s left. This resembles an oblong protrusion from the Jewellery Girl’s gold 
hair net, possibly a hair pin, which is also located to the viewer’s left. Both wear 
similar tunics with broad, black clavi edged in gold. While this particular style 
is not uncommon in mummy portraits from the period,93 the position of the 
mantle in relation to the long necklace as well as the similarities in the width 
and gold edging of the clavus are striking. But perhaps the most conspicuous 
parallel relates to the Jewellery Girl’s large, gold chain necklace that hangs be-
low her three chokers. The double loop-in-loop chain and ovoid emerald pen-
dant are replicated in the body chain ornament worn by the Trier girl, with 
two additional chains added at the bottom to form a catena (although only 
one is visible). The location of the Jewellery Girl’s emerald pendant high up 
on the chest is identical to the position of the jeweled boss on the Trier girl’s 
body chain, indicating that the painter of the Trier portrait likely copied and 
modified this feature, without realizing how catenae were generally worn on 
the torso.
The uncanny correlations between the two portraits, along with the addi-
tional anomalies cited, suggest that the Trier version is not an authentic an-
cient painting, making it impossible to use the work as evidence that catenae 
were worn over clothing in the Roman period.94
Moreover, the visual comparanda cited throughout this discussion sug-
gest that not only were body chains worn specifically over nude or semi-nude 
torsos, but that they carried with them a distinctly erotic connotation. This

Johns does cite one example of a Roman period sculpture of a fully draped woman wear-
ing a cord or metal catena, from Kyrenia, Cyprus. The archaeological context for the piece 
is unknown, however, and the degree to which this singular example relates to the way in 
which the catenae excavated in the Vesuvian region were worn is unclear. See Johns, The 
Hoxne Late Roman Treasure, 26.

637
Excavated Roman Jewelry: The Case of the Gold Body Chains
eroticism is implied certainly in the form’s association with Venus, but also 
the display of catenae in explicit scenes, possibly representing prostitutes or 
courtesans engaged in sexual acts.95
This is not to imply that the extant catenae necessarily belonged to women 
engaged in the world’s oldest profession. Likely, the erogenous undertones and 
the affiliation with the goddess of love made body chains desirable across so-
cial contexts. Prostitutes and courtesans would have had clear motivations for 
the wearing of catenae. A marriage consummation might be another appro-
priate circumstance in which a body chain could be worn. Even respectable 
Roman wives might have donned catenae for their intimate encounters, espe-
cially in light of the number of surviving portrait sculptures that show Roman 
matrons adopting the guise of the nude Venus.96 What seems apparent in the 
visual evidence is that these chains functioned specifically as erotic jewelry 
that likely was not worn in public contexts, over clothing, but rather over the 
undressed or scantily dressed body in more private, sensual scenarios. There 
does not appear to be any kind of social incongruity in the wearing of the same 
types of jewelry by both elite women and women of low social standing (i.e. 
prostitutes). Johns’s bridal theory, while perhaps narrowly focused, demon-
strates the range of contexts in which a Roman woman might wish to evoke 
the attributes and charms of Venus by wearing the catena as a potent, visual 
symbol.
	
Assessing the Evidence
Given the problems discussed above, one cannot reliably assert that catenae 
were worn over everyday dress. The representations in which body chains 
appear indicate that they were generally used in intimate, erotic contexts, 
rather than for public display. These issues relate to the broader question re-
garding the connection between the excavated examples and the illustrations 
of catenae in art. Experimentation with the ways in which double-loop and 
95	
Johns suggests the woman portrayed on the bronze mirror back from the Esquiline 
Hill may be a wealthy courtesan, see Johns, The Hoxne Late Roman Treasure, 25. The 
­cunnilingus scene from the Suburban Baths at Pompeii appears to illustrate an encounter 
­between a prostitute, signaled by her nudity, and a male client, according to Clarke. How-
ever, preserved graffiti could also indicate that indeed it is the man in this scene who has 
been hired by an aristocratic woman to perform a sex act that the Romans deemed taboo.

638
­wheel-and-crescent types were worn indicates that catenae might be loosely 
draped or more tightly fitting, a fact that is confirmed in the visual comparanda. 
The presence of certain decorative elements shown in representations, mainly 
the central ornament located between or below the breasts, correlates with the 
wheels and bosses present on the extant pieces. And the crescent pendant of 
the wheel-and-crescent type shows up on short necklaces depicted in paint-
ings and sculpture as well as on actual Roman necklaces, all of which support 
the idea that such a “necklace” could be formed as part of the catena’s configu-
ration. Clearly, however, representations in art do not answer all the questions 
raised through investigation of the chains themselves. The possibility remains 
that some of the objects identified as catenae, such as the Herculaneum chain, 
were in fact worn as bandoliers or looped around the neck as necklaces.
An overview of the excavation histories of the pieces reveals that the con-
texts of many of the catenae are not as informative as one might wish. What 
the provenience does establish is that the excavated catenae are authentic, an 
important consideration in light of the numerous forgeries that plague the 
corpus of ancient jewelry. Furthermore, their association with other goods, al-
beit often vaguely stated, indicates that the chains were part of the household 
wealth of Roman families, used by members of the elite. The relationship of the 
catenae in archaeological contexts to other objects bearing images of or asso-
ciations with Venus, as with the Oplontis chains, could also speak to the ­beliefs 
of those who owned such items. Unfortunately, further questions regarding 
the use and meaning of catenae remain unanswered, largely due to a lack of 
detailed contextual information for many of the excavated pieces—­either be-
cause full reports remain unpublished or because excavation occurred before 
such details were routinely recorded.
While the body chains discussed here have been readily identified by schol-
ars as catenae, and noted in the archaeological record of the Vesuvian region, 
not much effort has been directed toward an investigation of what their de-
sign, appearance, and contexts can reveal. Holmes himself once warned, “there 
is nothing as deceptive as an obvious fact,”97 an apt admonition in dealing 
with this particular jewelry form, which has been largely taken at face value. 
In some cases, additional technical research is needed in order to determine 
the construction of these chains, before certain of them can be labeled as cat-
enae at all. With further research, a clear understanding of the catena form will 
hopefully emerge, and one can begin to correct the misinterpretations of past 
study, turning to the objects to see what they themselves reveal.

Ivory Identification
Anibal Rodriguez
The aim of this paper is to encourage those who may have a need to acquaint 
themselves with the basic visual rules of ivory identification without the worry 
of having to become an expert with access to specialized tools. While we can 
all use more information, it’s almost as if it is too simple to consider the ulti-
mate in simplicity: our eyes instead of the microscope, our brain instead of 
the computer. It’s all really the same thing. In the last 35 years there has been a 
tremendous push, and successfully so, to evaluate the vast numbers of artifacts 
sitting in museum storerooms. Materials are waiting to be identified and, when 
they are, will add new information to what are admittedly esoteric subjects, 
but nevertheless relevant to so many of us as contributions to our collective 
wisdom. The pursuit of knowledge is what makes and keeps the great colleges, 
universities, and museums great. It is what education is all about. I am pleased 
to present this summary on ivory identification to Oscar White Muscarella, a 
valued colleague and friend, whose interest in and publication of ancient ivo-
ries and their identification has helped to expand our knowledge of the field.
…
Historically and traditionally, ivory is considered the dentine from the 
­elephant tusk. Ivory, however, comes from a variety of sources including 
­elephants (­Elephantidae), the extinct mammoth (Mammuthus) and mastodon 
(Mammut), the walrus (Odobenidae), tooth-bearing whales (Cetacea), hippo-
potamuses (Hippopotamidae), and pigs (Suidae). Tusks are teeth that protrude 
beyond the lip. The most dramatic example is that of the narwhal (Monodon 
monoceros), which has one enormously long, spiraling tooth emerging from its 
mouth (Plate 31.1). The tooth can be two to seven meters long; the male nar-
whal has a single left tusk that is a modified upper incisor.1 All ivories are made 
of teeth, but not all teeth are ivory.
Essentially, ivory is nothing more than a large amount of dentine (the hard, 
calcified tissue beneath the enamel of a tooth), and yet it is a material of lux-
ury and desire, its use spanning perhaps 40 thousand years. The teeth that

we call ivory are morphologically simple. They are almost always incisors or 
­canines, which are not as complex structurally or morphologically as molars, 
for ­example—and this is to our advantage in terms of identification. The av-
erage elephant, mammoth, or mastodon tusk is two-thirds solid dentine and 
one-third pulp cavity (containing the soft tissue inside a tooth consisting of 
nerves and blood vessels).
There are many published descriptions and analyses of the structure of 
ivory, with Michael Locke’s 2008 article being particularly thorough.2 We are 
also indebted to the work of T.K. Penniman and Olga Krzyszkowska for their 
treatment of the subject of ivory. When Penniman wrote Pictures of Ivory and 
Other Animal Teeth, Bone, and Antler (1952), interest in and research on ivory 
was aimed at ethnology and archaeology and was taking an evolving hold.3 
According to the limited technology of the time, it was thought that a hot nee-
dle inserted into an ivory artifact could determine if it was genuine ivory or 
­plastic. This thinking was also applied to horn. Fortunately, this approach was 
discarded, but, interestingly, it still comes up on occasion among those who 
are uninformed.
Until recently, demands on institutions—such as museums, universities, 
and even auction houses—to stop acquiring or trading in ivory were not 
backed by the force of law. The formation of monitoring governmental agen-
cies, and national and international agreements such as the Convention on 
the International Trade in Endangered Species (cites, 1975)4 and the u.s. 
­Endangered Species Act (esa, 1973),5 have empowered the wildlife conserva-
tion movement, giving new reason to properly identify not only ivory but the 
entire animal and plant kingdom. This moved the issue forward from Penni-
man’s contribution, which had dealt in an introductory and pragmatic way 
with a subject long ignored.
Krzyszkowska’s Ivory and Related Materials (1990) has had tremendous im-
pact as a learning tool, in that she orients the artifact in relation to its material, 
attempting to situate an ivory object within the raw tusk.6 This approach is ex-
tremely valuable to those wishing to understand how such ivory objects were 
made. Incorporating actual excavation reports, and augmented by photos and 
illustrations, Krzyszkowska’s presentation is comprehensive.

Ivory Identification
Reference to the work of Penniman and Krzyszkowska is vital to any seri-
ous study of large mammal dental materials. However, I would be remiss if I 
did not mention the work of George Frederick Kunz, Ivory and the Elephant 
in Art, in Archaeology, and in Science. Written over 100 years ago, it provides a 
treasure trove of information in the areas of aesthetics, material science, and 
history.
	
The Macro Structure of Ivory
The macro structure of ivory is of specific interest to us, as it is what pres-
ents itself most readily to the examiner. In fact, even without magnification, 
the structures that define individual ivories are often clearly presented. Best 
known, perhaps, is the Schreger pattern of intersecting arcs found in the or-
der Proboscidea, for both extinct and extant species, including mammoths and 
­African and Asian elephants (Plates 31.2–31.4). This pattern is found only in 
ivory of Proboscidea, so any question of the material’s origin is answered once 
this pattern is identified.
Sections cut in transverse, tangential, and radial views demonstrate the 
structure of ivory in different profiles. These views are very important in dis-
tinguishing one ivory from another, as difficulty in identification can arise 
over confusion between ivory types, such as elephant and hippopotamus, 
for ­example. The first step in the identification of elephant or any ivory is to 
ascertain its profile—and, when dealing with an object, to understand how 
it is oriented in relation to the original tusk or tooth. The Schreger pattern is 
the diagnostic characteristic feature for Proboscidea, and, in the transverse 
view—or cross section—it is plainly visible. If, however, the view is radial or 
­tangential—cut longitudinally, either along a radius from the core (radial) or 
offset from the core (tangential)—special attention is warranted.
After the Schreger pattern has been detected, the process of determining 
whether the specimen comes from an extinct or extant Proboscidea species 
begins. This process requires that the angles formed by the Schreger pattern 
be measured, since the value of the angles measured can be indicative of an 
extinct or extant species. Note that I say can be indicative, and not is indicative. 
The Schreger pattern when viewed and measured at the periphery of a whole 
and unaltered tusk displays a profuse and clear pattern with easily measur-
able angles. The central portion of the tusk, however, shows a more dispersed 
arrangement, for which measurement is not as useful. It is only at the outer 
portion of the tusk (dentine/cementum junction) that extinct vs. extant spe-
cies can be discerned. Research suggests that the measurable angles are acute 

Rodriguez
648
for extinct species (Plate 31.2) and obtuse for extant species (Plate 31.4).7 It 
should also be noted that, because specimens from both extinct and extant 
­Proboscidea may present angles between 90 and 115 degrees even in the outer 
Schreger pattern area, the differentiation of mammoth from elephant ivory 
should never be based upon single angle measurements when the angles fall 
within this range.8
The tangential profile is a view that can be especially tricky, since walrus, 
hippopotamus, and even sperm whale ivory can mimic one another when cut 
to reveal tangential surfaces. Great care needs to be exercised when presented 
with objects that allow only this view, such as thin tablets or plaques, for ex-
ample. One should consider that for each of these ivories we are dealing with 
dental structures, which have the same basic chemistry, with some variation in 
their physical architectural arrangements.
Illustrated in Plate 31.5, derived from my own experiments, is a series of 
stains of various solutions and other experimental mixtures, used on salvaged 
antique piano keys. In the tangential view, shown here, the figure and the grain 
of the ivory is clearly enhanced. Such can be the case in both ethnographic 
and archaeological excavated specimens, when staining is present. Common 
are specimens that came into contact with iron or copper, or soils rich in these 
metals, or were intentionally dyed or stained. In this staining experiment, what 
stands out clearly is the fact that ivory is able to absorb stains or dyes so readily. 
Ivories have been stained and dyed throughout history, and in the last 20 years 
a new area of research has emerged that has shed new light on when, where, 
and why. One interesting recent study has investigated the use of polychromy 
on Byzantine ivories.9
Ivory is actually very porous, so preexisting stains or dyes that provide con-
trast are always welcomed as opportunities for identification. This is especially 
true when you consider that ivories of all types can also be bleached, rendering 
a specimen almost devoid of character, and increasing the difficulty of deter-
mining its species. Under such circumstances, a trained technician should be 
consulted when the examiner is in doubt.
Identifying whole teeth is not at all problematic. Identifying cut pieces, 
with their surface intact, can be a little more so. In certain cases, samples 
of unworked ivory can be easily differentiated, as with walrus tusk, which

Ivory Identification
has a much smoother surface than that of elephant or hippopotamus ivory 
(Plate 31.6). Examination of sections of unworked tusks or teeth may require 
some expertise on the part of the examiner, as shown by a comparison be-
tween elephant and hippopotamus ivory (Plates 31.7–31.9). But it is when these 
same kinds of ivories are examined as small pieces or as carved artifacts that 
the opportunities—and the difficulties—begin. When the tusk is carved, and 
all of its familiar features are carved away and formed into something else, 
identification becomes a challenge. The object may be an exquisite piece of 
art, a tool, decoration on furniture, or some other type of embellishment. Close 
inspection may help to determine the kind of ivory used for such works.
For instance, examination of a small piece of elephant ivory in compari-
son with a small piece of walrus ivory can be effectively carried out under low 
magnification (10x–15x) for 1 inch square specimens. The tusk structure of 
these two animals is completely different, which can be recognized visually 
under low magnification. Comparison of comparable samples of walrus and 
hippopotamus under low magnification will show a similar surface structure 
with important and statistically measurable differences. It should be noted 
here that not all specimens to be examined are created equal: dirt, soot, grime, 
and other variables affecting the condition can interfere with identification. In 
such cases, cleaning may help, but it is mandatory that this be done in the labo-
ratory. Even after cleaning, specimens can prove to be a challenge. While dyes, 
stains, and dirt can present problems, stains and dye, as mentioned above, can 
also solve them.
Finally, it is important to consider the dental source when assessing an ivory 
specimen. While it is common to find objects made of elephant tusk, works 
made of elephant cheek teeth—their molars—are relatively scarce. On the 
other hand, it is very common to find objects made of walrus tusk and of wal-
rus cheek teeth. Walrus tusk is primarily composed of homogeneous primary 
dentine and a grainy center, or secondary dentine (see below). The cheek teeth 
are also composed of primary and secondary dentine, as with the tusk. This 
similarity can be easily overlooked by those with limited exposure to dental 
materials, but an understanding of such fine points can mean the difference 
between a correct or incorrect conclusion—the latter resulting in flawed in-
formation and misidentification of the ivory.
	
The Ageing of Ivory
In any discussion of ivory identification, ultimately the question of age will 
arise. In this connection, one might ask the question, “How old is old for ivory 

Rodriguez
650
and objects made of ivory?” The consensus is 50 years or more.10 One obvious 
indication of age is poor condition including breaks or fractures (Plate 31.9). 
According to Locke, another visual indication of age is a particular type of sur-
face cracking resulting from the fact that ivory has a helicoidal architecture 
in peripheral Schreger columns.11 The technical aspects of this statement are 
beyond the scope of this paper, but, simply stated, Locke’s understanding of 
the helicoidal arrangement came from observation of the crack patterns in the 
surface of tangential profiles of old ivory (Plate 31.10). The term now commonly 
used to describe this effect is a “row of feathers.”
This pattern is not always found in old ivory, however. As Locke has conveyed 
to me, “The feather pattern in cracks is a consequence of the helicoidal archi-
tecture and appears in tangential profiles. It will not appear just ­because the 
specimen is old—mammoth ivory cut in tangential profile would not imme-
diately show the pattern but would show it more quickly than in cut ­elephant 
tusk because it has lost much protein and cracks more quickly.”12
It is further suggested that cracking could also reasonably be expected ex-
perimentally when elephant tusk (ivory) is boiled and then dried. It should be 
noted that drying out can and does cause cracks that do not display the feather 
pattern. And as numerous examples have shown, many archaeological pieces 
stored in museums will show no signs of cracking at all. In short, environmen-
tal conditions including temperature, humidity, and fluctuations of these fac-
tors must be taken into consideration when judging the age of a piece of ivory 
by its appearance. In my opinion, color should never be used to determine 
the age of ivory, as it is not always a reliable indicator as to whether an artifact 
is indeed old. However, if the basic morphology and tendencies of the rela-
tively few ivory types that come up for examination are mastered, considering 
that a surprisingly small number of features are required for an identification 
(­including determination of age), the exercise should not be difficult.
	
Frequently Encountered Sources of Ivory other than Proboscidea
	
Hippopotamus Ivory
Hippopotamus ivory comes from the upper and lower canines and the upper 
and lower peg-like incisors of the African water horse, Hippopotamus amphibi-
ous (Plates 31.11–31.12). Hippopotamus ivory is often misidentified in museum

collections as elephant ivory. This not because there is a striking similarity, 
which there is not, but simply because of unfamiliarity with either one or both. 
(It is also true that many ivories are identified as bone and vice versa.) The 
male hippopotamus is larger than the female, and the canines reflect this. The 
form of the teeth, however, is the same. In cross section, the upper and lower 
canines are very different from each other, which can be a tremendous advan-
tage in distinguishing whole specimens.
The upper and lower canines and incisors have a thick coating of enamel. 
It is in the massive canine teeth, both upper and lower, that this enamel is 
so striking and impressive. The enamel is so thick that fire can be produced 
when the canine is struck with iron. Removing this enamel is time-consuming, 
arduous work for the craftsman. Nonetheless, throughout history, hippopota-
mus ivory has been, like elephant ivory, a luxury material used to make luxury 
items—such as plaques, figures, boxes, cosmetic cases, and other beautiful 
works that can be seen in museums and private collections.
The presence of items made of hippopotamus ivory is more common than 
we once knew, or even suspected. Many new specimens are being identified, 
not by archaeological excavation, but through curation and collections man-
agement efforts taking place in museums all over the world. It is a time of new 
discovery, and an opportunity to shine new light on old archaeological and 
art historical questions in terms of materials and their place and meaning in 
history.
Hippopotamus lower canines in the raw are massive teeth, completely un-
like those of any other animal. They are triangular in section and form the shape 
of a large C, with a thick layer of enamel characterized by ridges (Plate 31.11). 
About one-third of the tusk, at the proximal (root) end, consists of the pulp 
cavity, coated with cementum and rooted in the alveolus or crypt of the jaw, 
with the other two-thirds visible above the jaw. A clear demarcation may be 
seen between the pulp cavity and the rest of the tooth. The inner underside of 
the lower canine is devoid of dentine, but a matte dentine-like surface is vis-
ible, a characteristic feature of hippopotamus canines.
In cross section, the tooth is somewhat irregular in both upper and lower 
canines, although these irregularities are different in nature. As noted, the 
cross section of the lower canines is triangular, a distinctive feature that can 
help the examiner with identification. Lower canines can also be distinguished 
from upper canines in section by their enamel, which, as with pig tusk, coats 
only two sides. In cross section, hippopotamus canines and incisors show a se-
ries of very fine concentric circles, which are closely packed together. A loupe 
with 10x magnification or lower is ideal for the examination of specimens. In 
cross section, the upper canine is round or oval, as are the incisors, which show 

Rodriguez
652
­ridging along the entire length.13 In longitudinal view, when examined under 
low magnification (3x–10x) the surface of hippopotamus ivory is not dissimilar 
to that of elephant ivory, as noted (Plate 31.7). Longitudinal sections likewise 
show appreciable similarities (Plate 31.8).
Being very large, the lower canines and incisors are therefore usually chosen 
for carvings of sizable dimensions. For smaller items, the peg-shaped incisors 
are also used. Once the enamel is removed, the raw ivory can be carved into 
whatever form the carver wishes. Certain structural features of hippopotamus 
teeth may affect the carver’s choices. Throughout the length of the large lower 
canine, an arched tusk interstitial zone (tiz) exists. This tiz has provoked vari-
ous debates, in terms of whether its position in the tusk may interfere with the 
“strength” of the tooth, and concerning whether the craftsman may need to 
avoid it.
	
Walrus Ivory
Walrus ivory (Plate 31.6) comes from the upper canines, the tusks, of Odobe-
nus rosmarus, as well as from the cheek teeth. The tusks are suitable for large 
carvings, while game pieces, buttons, and other small items may be fashioned 
from the secondary teeth. A walrus tusk is very large in its raw state, and oval 
in cross section. About two-thirds of the tusk is comprised of the dentine, with 
the other third being the pulp cavity.
The structure of the tusk may be described as being composed of inner and 
outer parts. The outer portion of the tusk consists of a homogeneous, milky-
white material, referred to as the primary dentine. At the proximal end, which 
has an outer layer of cementum, the tusk is dark brown or black; the color 
may vary but not drastically. Running throughout the center of the tusk, for its 
entire length, is a secondary dentine, unique to the walrus, which has been re-
ferred to as tapioca-like in appearance. Whether you cut the tusk transversely 
or longitudinally, the secondary dentine is clearly visible. This is a distinguish-
ing feature of walrus ivory, which the carver may wish to avoid if this part of 
the tusk interferes with the appearance of the piece, although this seems sel-
dom to have been a concern. As in any work of art carved out of a piece of 
raw ivory, regardless of type, the natural shape of the tooth will be altered but 
not its structure. Fortunately, the structure of walrus ivory is quite simple and 
lends itself readily to visual inspection. A whole tusk can be identified easily 
by an experienced examiner.
A word about the function of the walrus tusk is in order, since it has been 
the subject of much discussion and controversy, involving more speculation 
13

653
Ivory Identification
than definitive study. As Francis Fay indicates, for the last 200 years, tusks were 
thought to function mainly as a means to obtain food, presumably used by the 
walrus as a digging or raking device for unearthing clams. Fay challenges that 
idea, explaining that characteristics of walrus tusks—their growth, patterns of 
abrasion, and placement in the skull—prove otherwise.14 Rather, Fay sees the 
role of the tusk as that of social organ.
Why should we care about this in our discussion of walrus ivory artifacts? 
Museum storage rooms are replete with collections of tusks—those of wal-
rus and of other animals—and for decades (perhaps hundreds of years for the 
older collections) walrus ivory has been incorrectly analyzed or ignored. Abra-
sions, cuts, chips, or other types of wear have been noted, but whether such 
features occurred naturally or through human intervention can be difficult to 
ascertain. Careful examination will present a variety of possibilities, for both 
the whole tusk and the man-made artifact. Walrus ivory is probably the easiest 
of the ivories to identify, due to its seemingly straightforward visual qualities. 
However, the tusk itself is a complex organ, as with teeth in general, which 
are extremely complicated when chemistry, mechanics, form, and function are 
considered.
	
Sperm Whale Ivory
The ivory of Physeter macrocephalus, or the sperm whale, is readily found 
among collections, those relating to whaling in particular. The working of 
sperm whale ivory became something of a folk art tradition among sailors 
­involved in the whaling industry, rather than being an ethnically or geographi-
cally specific craft. Sailors’ scrimshaw and related artifacts are well known. 
Other noteworthy types of objects include the whale tooth necklace (lei niho 
palaoa) of the Hawaiians and the sperm whale necklace (Wäsekaseka) familiar 
in Fiji.
The sperm whale tooth, when viewed at the surface, can have a variety of 
contours but is always identifiable as a sperm whale tooth: although these 
teeth may vary widely in size, they are always conical in shape (Plate 31.13). 
The exterior cementum is channeled, and in some places corrugated. A longi-
tudinal section of a sperm whale tooth reveals a series of layers (Figure 31.1), 
which are also visible in cross section, appearing as concentric circles. One 
of the most striking features seen in a longitudinal section is the growth de-
posits known as osteodentinal “pearls” or osteodentine (Plates 31.14–31.15). By 
definition, osteodentine is dentine that resembles bone. It is found chiefly in 
14

the teeth of fish and certain other animals, but also occurs occasionally in 
­humans when odontoblasts become entrapped by rapidly developing second-
ary dentine.
As with other ivories, close attention must be paid to orientation of a speci-
men in relation to the tooth. Familiarity with a normal, healthy specimen of 
sperm whale ivory is paramount, which is true for ivories of all kinds. Many 
ivories must go through a series of stages in preparation for carving, such as the 
removal of the enamel on hippopotamus ivory, as noted above. In the case of 
sperm whale ivory, complete removal of the cementum is evident when whole 
figures are carved. By contrast, in whale tooth scrimshaw, typically only the 
surface is etched, with little, if any, surface preparation. On some scrimshaw 
pieces, the entire coat of cementum is removed and the dentine becomes the 
canvas. Plate 31.16 shows the concentric circles characteristic of a cross sec-
tion of sperm whale ivory; when viewing the same specimen longitudinally, 
the long layers can be seen.

Other Related Materials
A few mammals other than those discussed in this paper are of great curiosity 
and I, for one, would be interested to see more research into the extent that 
their tusks may have played a specific cultural role, be it secular or religious. 
One such animal is the muntjac, of the genus Muntiacus, deer with tusks. Finds 
of whole tusks or animal teeth are not surprising to the archaeologist or eth-
nologist. But an artifact fashioned from an esoteric or unexpected dental ma-
terial would be intriguing. As a related aside, the structure of rhinoceros horn 
and that of horse hoof, on visual examination, is so similar that I have obtained 
samples of both for further study,15 the result of which I hope to present in a 
more comprehensive treatment of the cultural uses of ivory, bone, horn, and 
other related materials.
	
Ivory Identification and the Illegal Traffic of Materials  
and Antiquities
Ivory identification, as described above, plays an important role in enforcing 
existing international agreements on the trade in new ivory, and in inhibiting 
the market for antique ivory, which helps to drive poaching and the harvest-
ing of fresh ivory from new sources. The techniques of ivory identification, as 
shown, help to establish species origin and can also give important clues as 
to age and geographic origin. They contribute to our knowledge in fields like 
ethnology, anthropology, and archaeology, while also helping to assure that 
­research and museum collecting can be undertaken in a responsible manner, 
in accordance with both the law and growing public sentiment. Chief among 
such agreements is cites, an international convention that entered into force 
in 1975.
	
cites
The aim of cites (Convention on International Trade in Endangered ­Species  
of Wild Fauna and Flora) is to ensure that international trade in wild ani-
mals and plants (and their products), estimated to be worth billions of 
­dollars ­annually, does not threaten their survival. The convention came out 
of a 1963 resolution adopted by members of the iucn (International Union 
for Conservation of Nature), but its language was not agreed upon until the 
­representatives of 80 countries met in Washington, d.c., on March 3, 1973. The 
convention ­entered into force on July 1, 1975.16

Countries that have agreed to be bound by cites (“parties” to the conven-
tion) do so voluntarily. Although cites is legally binding on the parties, each 
country must adopt its own laws to ensure that cites is implemented within 
its jurisdiction. It is important to mention the convention in terms of ivory 
for obvious reasons; cites can also be effective in combating the looting of 
archaeological sites and illegal trade in cultural property. While cites was 
not devised as a remedy for all such activity, the implementation of the treaty 
through national laws of individual countries can have a beneficial or at least 
co-lateral effect in preventing the trade in wild fauna and flora and cultural 
artifacts alike.
Thanks to cites, monitoring of the importation and exportation of wild-
life in all its forms has resulted in close inspection of cargo from and to many 
countries. The laws regulating the export and import of flora and fauna are 
under the jurisdiction of agencies in the various home countries, and cites 
does not involve itself in domestic monitoring, regulating, or control. In the 
United States that responsibility falls to the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service (usfws) as the domestic agency that enforces the cites convention.
u.s. law enforcement agencies such as the fbi and u.s. Customs and Border 
Protection do cooperate with international counterparts such as Interpol to 
prevent, investigate, and monitor criminal activity in the area of trade in cul-
tural property. However, the Internet has made it especially easy to circumvent 
law enforcement at the borders, with sellers openly and wantonly conspiring 
to sell or transfer online. In one example, eBay has had to suspend the buy-
ing and selling of ivory and other materials that are protected under the u.s. 
Endangered Species Act and the laws, rules, and regulations of cites. While 
these measures are implemented by responsible enterprises such as eBay, the 
criminal enterprise is always working to establish a way around the law.
This brings us to why, as scholars, curators, and other museum and univer-
sity personnel, we should concern ourselves with cites. Without digressing 
into domestic and foreign antiquities law, with all its complexities, the fact 
remains that agency after agency is hindered by the sheer size and number 
of cargo shipments entering the world’s ports. Inside these massive cargo sea-
trains, objects made of ivory, rhinoceros horns, and pelts of tigers, leopards, 
and gorillas are disguised as innocent crafts, tourist souvenirs, and other seem-
ingly innocuous items. We can anticipate the restrictions that cites will bring 
to bear on curators, for example, bringing in new acquisitions from the field to 
their respective institutions, but such restrictions are not always insurmount-
able, because cites provides exceptions for antiques. In this respect it differs 
from legislation such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (mbta), which specifies 
no limit on the age of a specimen when restricting its ­purchase or sale.

Ivory Identification
Many institutions have recently been under fire, and some have conceded to 
international and domestic pressure, to return cultural objects to their coun-
tries of origin. Many have stopped acquiring such objects unless they can be 
imported legally through official channels from bona fide archaeological sites, 
or, in the case of ethnographic materials, purchased from community-based 
cooperatives. The ability to identify ivory, bone, horn, and other related materi-
als is a prerequisite to the detection of stolen, looted, or misappropriated items 
made from these materials—and the prevention of their import. Because 
cites allows, under its provisions, the import and export of antiques, usfws 
inspectors and staff biologists need to be hypervigilant. Thus, the identifica-
tion of ivory as to species and determination of age are sometimes delegated 
to an outside expert, as with other materials of interest to the usfws inspec-
tors. This should not, however, discourage or dissuade anyone from becoming 
familiar with the fundamentals of the basic biological structures of ivory, bone, 
and horn. We as experts should welcome the responsibility of educating inter-
ested parties and explaining our methods and techniques.
The detection of illicit artifacts is not just limited to verifying that objects 
have been excavated and are thus confirmed to be genuine, and that they have 
been legally exported from their countries of origin. Forgeries are a big prob-
lem, and thus expertise in detecting fakes is of paramount importance. The 
authenticity of ivory artifacts without an archaeological context cannot be as-
certained by dating the material alone: it is not unusual for a piece of ancient 
ivory to be used by a forger to fashion a modern object that is made to pass as 
an old work. In addition, genuine objects of historical interest can suffer what 
amounts to identity theft from the smuggler, forger, or con artist, who may 
falsify records or alter authentic pieces to increase their desirability. Historic 
pieces are constantly being traded, bought and sold at auction, deaccessioned 
from museums and corporate and private collections. The usfws inspectors 
and biologists rightly reach out to us, the experts, for help on occasions when 
they need to assess an object being exported or imported by an auction house 
or for private sale. It is just as important to afford genuine objects access to a 
rigorous vetting process as it is to stop suspected or proven cases of theft or 
misappropriation.
The benefits received from the protection of flora and fauna under cites 
can be an effective tool in combating the looting and theft of cultural property 
in the short and long term alike. No one will argue against the importance of 
protecting of our natural heritage, and yet a villager can protest convincingly 
that shooting an elephant to protect his crops was justified. On the other hand, 
no one will justify killing an elephant because someone may want cuff links, a 
pool ball, or a figurine to put on the mantel. Many elephants are dying, as are

rhinoceroses and other animals, because of their use in traditional medicine 
or the desire for trinkets and souvenirs that tourists wish to bring home. Both 
­domestic and international laws prohibit the importation of artifacts without 
going through customs, and if the objects are made of animal or plant ma-
terials, in whole or in part, one must also comply with the usfws. The sale 
or transfer of such objects may be perfectly legal in the country in which an 
object has been obtained, but becomes illegal as soon as these materials cross 
a border where cites and other protections are in place. As of July 6, 2016, in 
response to the rise in the poaching of ivory, a near-total ban on the commer-
cial trade in African elephant ivory is in effect in the United States.17
Certainly I am not suggesting that a casual knowledge of ivory ­morphology 
and structure will suffice for the identification of all ivories, but a general 
knowledge of basic information can be extremely useful. In our particular 
fields of anthropology and archaeology, the protection of cultural property 
is of paramount importance, and the continued use of direct or indirect de-
terrents such as cites can provide a way to have access to legally exported, 
genuine objects that reflect human history. One myth or misunderstanding 
people have about cites is that it is in place to prohibit trade in the materials 
protected by the convention. That is just not the case. The purpose of cites 
is to protect by monitoring the trade in these materials. If trade is allowed to 
go unregulated, wholesale extinction is almost guaranteed. A comparable loss 
will occur when objects are looted from archaeological sites, or ethnographic 
objects are removed from their natural setting. cites has become an unex-
pected but welcome partner in the protection of our cultural heritage, while 
created to help sustain the wonders of the plant and animal world.

Luxury Arts of the Ancient Near East
Elizabeth Simpson
A large category of ancient Near Eastern arts may be termed “luxury arts,” 
­because of their inherently valuable materials, fine workmanship, and associa-
tions with the elites in whose tombs they were buried. These are sometimes 
called “decorative arts” or “minor arts,” although they were really neither. 
Even the word “art” is debated, as it was not employed in the ancient world 
per se, although ancient peoples clearly appreciated well-made objects of 
prized ­materials.1 Such consciously artistic creations—metalwork and jewelry, 
­faience and glasswork, elaborate textiles and clothing, and fine furniture—are 
discussed in the present essay. This overview draws from the works of many 
authors, only a few of which can be cited here. Preeminent are Roger Moorey’s 
Ancient Mesopotamian Materials and Industries (1994) and Jack Sasson’s Civi-
lizations of the Ancient Near East (1995). Numerous scholars have written on 
individual sites and types of objects, aided by practitioners, conservators, and 
scientists. Following the lead of Oscar White Muscarella, more and more schol-
ars now distinguish carefully between excavated and unexcavated (plundered) 
objects, in order to determine what is authentically ancient, and to keep forg-
eries of provenience from contaminating the record.2 In this regard, ancient 
Near Eastern “art” cannot be dissociated from archaeology. I am pleased to 
present this article to Oscar Muscarella, who has made such a major contribu-
tion to the study of the arts of the ancient Near East—through his uncompro-
mising work as a master sleuth.
	
Early Arts and Technologies
The so-called Neolithic Revolution was characterized by a series of technologi-
cal innovations, including the annealing of native copper (Çayönü, Turkey, ca. 
eighth millennium b.c.), the smelting of copper ore (apparent evidence from 
Çatalhöyük, Turkey, ca. 6,000 b.c.), and the casting of copper in a mold (Can

Hasan, Turkey, ca. 5,000 b.c.).3 Early surviving textiles include fragments of 
twined bast fiber from Çayönü (ca. 8,000 b.c.) and of woven hemp from Çat-
alhöyük (ca. 7,400 b.c.).4 The warp-weighted loom is attested at Çatalhöyük 
by ca. 6,000 b.c.5 Furniture was in use at Çatalhöyük in the same period.6 Jew-
elry in the form of beads of stone, teeth, and copper was found at Çayönü, 
­Çatalhöyük, and other Neolithic sites (Plate 32.1).7 The fine stone beads were 
shaped with stone or copper tools, and the holes were drilled with a bow drill, 
a laborious and exacting process.
The earliest extant worked gold has been excavated from graves at the site 
of Varna in Bulgaria (fifth millennium b.c.); among the earliest gold objects 
from Mesopotamia are fluted beads from the site of Tepe Gawra in Iraq (fifth–
fourth millennium b.c.). Faience and “glazed” stone (mainly steatite) occur 
in the Near East as well as Egypt by the fifth millennium b.c.8 By the fourth 
millennium, the predominant copper alloy in the Near East was arsenical cop-
per (.9% arsenic or greater), occurring as a natural or artificial alloy.9 Maces, 
standards, scepters, and “crowns” of arsenical copper and cast by the lost-wax 
method were discovered in 1961 in the Nahal Mishmar cave in the Judaean des-
ert (fourth millennium b.c.).10 Tin bronze was introduced as a commodity in 
Mesopotamia in the early third millennium b.c. There is disagreement over 
the percentage of tin required to indicate a deliberate alloy (less than 3% may 
be considered sufficient, based on ancient texts), as well as over the earliest 
methods of bronze manufacturing and also the sources of tin (see below).11 
With the introduction of bronze technology, one enters the Bronze Age, with 
its many important sites and luxury objects.

The Early Bronze Age: Luxury Arts in the Third Millennium b.c.
	
The Royal Cemetery of Ur
The tombs of the “Royal Cemetery” of Ur in southern Iraq produced an enor-
mous corpus of fine Sumerian objects of metal, stone, shell, reed, wood, and 
other materials, buried as grave goods and also worn by attendants sacrificed 
as part of the funerary ritual.12 Sixteen or 17 tombs dating to the Early Dynastic 
iiia period (ca. 2550–2400 b.c.) were considered exceptional (“royal”) by the 
excavator Leonard Woolley. The burials contained items of copper, tin, bronze, 
gold, electrum, silver, lapis lazuli, and carnelian—all imported materials—and 
included weapons, tools, cylinder seals, jewelry, vessels, musical instruments, 
and funerary furniture. Many of these survived in good condition, due to the 
careful excavation methods of Woolley and his team. Works from the Royal 
Cemetery were among those damaged in the looting of the Iraq Museum in 
April 2003, although most had been transferred to storage in the basement of 
the Baghdad Bank in 1990, prior to the 1991 Gulf War.13
Tomb pg 800, as described by Woolley, comprised a “death pit” with 23 re-
tainers and a tomb chamber that held the burial of Queen Puabi and three 
attendants. The queen wore an elaborate headdress of gold, lapis lazuli, and 
carnelian over a complex coiffeur, as well as gold lunate earrings and a neck-
lace of gold and lapis lazuli (Plate 32.2). Covering her upper body was a “cape” 
of beads, and at her waist was a beaded belt. Near the bier lay her “diadem,” re-
constructed by Woolley from tiny lapis beads, gold amulets, and delicate floral 
elements. The queen’s attendants were also suitably attired. Additional finds 
include gold and silver vessels, gold “loop-in-loop” chains, a silver and electrum 
rein ring, bronze and copper vessels and tools, ostrich and cockle shells, stone 
and silver offering stands, a gaming board, a toilet box, a harp, a sledge, and 
a “wardrobe chest” ornamented with human and animal figures in shell and 
lapis lazuli.14
Numerous metalworking techniques are exhibited in the objects from the 
Royal Cemetery: the raising of metal vessels, repoussé and chasing, casting, 
soldering (which involves an agent) and brazing (which does not), precious 
metal overlay, metal inlay, wire and chain making, cloisonné for stone inlay,

and filigree.15 It has often been stated that the earliest evidence for granulation 
comes from the tomb of Puabi, but this cannot be substantiated.16 The item in 
question, a ring bead, is said to be from pg 800, although it does not appear in 
the published inventory.17 To find early instances of gold granulation with a se-
cure archaeological context, one must turn to the site of Troy in northwestern 
Anatolia.
	
Troy
By the mid-third millennium b.c., Troy was an important and wealthy com-
mercial center, to judge from the impressive architecture of the citadel and 
the 21 “treasures” discovered by Heinrich Schliemann (1872–1890). Treasure A, 
or “Priam’s Treasure,” unearthed in 1873, contained a stunning array of luxury 
objects, including precious metal vessels, two ornate gold diadems with sheet-
gold pendants suspended from chains, 60 gold earrings and hair rings, gold 
bracelets and “torcs,” and around 8,700 tiny gold beads (Plate 32.3).18 Pendants 
on the diadems are worked in repoussé in imitation of gold granules; actual 
granulation occurs on several lunate earrings.19 Other Troy “treasures” include 
six gold bars with perforations or incised markings, and from Treasure L, four 
ceremonial hammer axes—three of jade and one of lazurite. The Troy Trea-
sures are now among the most famous—and most hotly contested—of all 
­ancient artifacts.20
Schliemann smuggled his treasures out of Turkey and into Greece, ­eventually 
bequeathing them to the Berlin State Museums, where they remained until the 
end of World War ii. In 1945, they were removed by Soviet trophy brigades to 
the u.s.s.r., where they were kept in secret repositories in the State Hermit-
age Museum, Leningrad, and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow. 
Their location was revealed only in 1991, and officially acknowledged in 1993. 
The finds in the Pushkin Museum, including Priam’s Treasure, went on display 
there in 1996, accompanied by a comprehensive catalogue with new color pho-
tographs and extensive information on materials and techniques.21 Works from 
Troy are now housed in around 50 museums throughout the world. Gold ­objects

were donated to the National Archaeological Museum in Athens by Sophia

Museum in Constantinople (Istanbul Archaeological Museum). A group of 24 
gold items acquired in 1966 by the University of Pennsylvania ­Museum, Phila-
delphia, was given back to Turkey on “indefinite term loan” in 2012.
	
Alaca Höyük and Horoztepe
Outstanding jewelry and metal artifacts were recovered from 13 Early Bronze 
Age “royal” tombs at Alaca Höyük in central Anatolia, dating to the second half 
of the third millennium b.c. Burial goods included gold diadems and jewelry, 
along with other objects of copper, bronze, iron, gold, silver, bone, clay, and 
stone.22 As at Troy, sheet gold items were worked in imitation of granulation, 
but true granulation is not found.23 Among the most intriguing works are the 
so-called standards, featuring animal figures or fields of geometric decoration. 
The standards are typically made of arsenical copper or tin bronze, and both 
lost-wax and mold casting are apparently attested.24 Some of the figures are in-
laid with silver or electrum; the use of combined metals also occurs in vessels 
from the tombs and a silver idol with boots and breasts of gold. Perhaps most 
exceptional is a dagger from Tomb K with a gold hilt and iron blade, recently 
analyzed and shown to have a high nickel content (7–8%), plausible evidence 
for meteoritic and not terrestrial iron.
The site of Horoztepe, some 150 km to the east, indicates that small items of 
furniture could be placed in graves in the region. Rescue operations were car-
ried out in 1956–1957, after several chance finds were brought to the attention 
of the Turkish government (1954). One tomb was excavated, dating to the later 
third millennium b.c., along with remnants of others that had been disturbed 
and plundered. The intact burial contained vessels, weapons, and other metal 
objects, some of which had been intentionally bent or crushed.25 Among these 
were furniture attachments, including the bronze sheathing for two small 
tables, the earliest actual tables from the Near East (Figure 32.1). Each table 
had four legs, with feet in the form of boots.26 More metal samples have been 
analyzed from Horoztepe than from any other Early Bronze site in Anatolia, 
revealing the presence of unalloyed copper, arsenical copper, tin bronze, gold,

silver, electrum, and lead.27 Several important copper and bronze artifacts ap-
parently from Horoztepe made their way to New York; these were bought by 
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1955 and are on display in the galleries of 
the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art.28

With the appearance of tin bronze in the third millennium b.c., scholars have 
sought to trace the source of the tin. This is the subject of debate, about which 
much has been written.29 Afghanistan is considered a likely candidate, with 
the Taurus Mountain region in Turkey also proposed.30 Early evidence of glass 
occurs at this time, in the form of beads from sites in Mesopotamia and Syria. 
In antiquity as in modern times, glass was made by combining silica and im-
pure soda in a liquid melt, normally carried out in stages by fritting at a low 
temperature, grinding, and remelting, until glassy material occurs.31 Most of

the evidence for Early Bronze Age luxury arts comes from cemeteries, reposi-
tories of the finery buried with the elites. Some city sites have also produced 
objects of importance, such as fragments of inlaid furniture from Uruk (Riem-
chengebäude) in southern Iraq, and carbonized remains of a carved wooden 
table and chair from Palace G, Ebla, in Syria.32 Such instances are rare, howev-
er, since those abandoning their living quarters normally took their valuables 
with them. This is especially true of metal, which could be used as a means of 
payment or exchange, with silver (kaspum) in particular considered an index 
of value in the third millennium b.c.
	
The Boston Treasure and the Dorak Affair
No discussion of the luxury arts of the Early Bronze Age would be complete 
without reference to two well known “treasures,” which may serve to illustrate 
the lure of precious objects and the love of a good story. The “Boston Treasure” is 
a “hoard” of gold jewelry acquired in 1968 by the Museum of Fine Arts, ­Boston. 
The hoard was “dated” by a gold cylinder seal inscribed with the cartouches of 
two Fifth Dynasty Egyptian pharaohs. Quotation marks are ­required, ­because 
the terms “treasure” and “hoard” are used to disguise the fact that the ­objects 
are all unexcavated. Therefore, from an archaeological perspective, they can-
not be said to form a coherent group, and the collection cannot be dated by 
any individual piece. In addition to the seal, the acquisition included 125 piec-
es of gold jewelry. Despite the lack of archaeological context, a fantastic nar-
rative was invented for the articles, involving an exotic princess from “some 
still-barbaric kingdom north of Egypt” who had died and been buried “in the 
regalia of her rank.” A scandal ensued, and the museum was quick to attri-
bute the problem to “the greed of whoever dug it up and peddled it abroad” 
without acknowledging its own role in the sequence of events that led to the 
acquisition.33
The “Dorak Affair” likewise involves a fabulous “treasure,” supposedly from 
two royal tombs. According to archaeologist James Mellaart, the “finds” were 
dug up around 1920 near the village of Dorak in northwest Turkey, and shown 
to him by a girl he met on a train in 1958. “Anna Papastrati” reportedly allowed 
Mellaart to examine and draw the objects and provided faded photographs and 
a sketch of the graves (Figure 32.2).34 In 1959, Mellaart published drawings of the 
finds in The Illustrated London News, revealing “the most important ­discovery

since the royal tombs of Ur”: weapons of bronze and precious metals, jewelry 
and vessels of gold and silver, five female figurines, textile remains (a woven 
“kilim”), two wooden tables, and a gold-plated throne, supposedly dismantled 
before burial.35 Also noted were an iron sword (recalling the Alaca Höyük dag-
ger) and four hammer axes (as at Troy) of nephrite, lapis lazuli, obsidian, and 
amber. Conveniently, the gold sheathing for the throne bore the cartouche of 
the Fifth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Sahure, dating the tombs to ca. 2500 b.c.
Although the objects themselves were not in evidence, the “Dorak trea-
sure” took its place in the Early Bronze Age repertoire.36 The finds were never 
­located, however, and Anna Papastrati and her house were likewise missing. 
Mellaart was accused of smuggling the works out of the country, and after 1965 
he did not excavate in Turkey again. The Dorak Affair has been investigated—
but not solved—by numerous scholars and journalists. Recently, the idea that 
Mellaart made it all up has gained ground,37 supported by a close look at the 
evidence. Aside from the complete absence of the Dorak “finds,” it seems all 
too fortuitous that (1) the graves were drawn with archaeological accuracy; 
(2) materials and techniques were identified with certainty; (3) suspiciously

close parallels can be cited in many instances, particularly for the four hammer 
axes; and (4) it is virtually impossible for two wooden tables and an Egyptian 
gold throne, even if dismantled, to have fit into the graves as represented. Both 
the Boston and Dorak “treasures” must be removed from the corpus of luxury 
arts of the third millennium b.c.
	
The Middle and Late Bronze Ages: Luxury Arts in the Second 
Millennium b.c.
In the early second millennium b.c., the Babylonians came to power, and by 
the 18th century b.c., King Hammurabi ruled extensive territories from the 
city of Babylon. Hammurabi’s code of law reveals much about value and com-
merce, including the trade in precious materials, but much more extensive 
documentation exists in ca. 23,000 clay tablets from Kültepe (Kaniš/Neša) 
in central Anatolia (ca. 1945–1730 b.c.). Kültepe is a large site with a citadel 
mound and the remains of an Assyrian trading colony (karum) that oversaw 
the trade in metals, stones, and textiles between Anatolia and Assyria in the 
early second millennium b.c. The Kültepe merchants exported gold, silver, 
copper, and other materials to Assyria, and imported tin and textiles.38 It has 
been estimated that approximately 100,000 textiles and 100 tons of tin were 
imported into Anatolia by caravan over a 40–50 year period.39 References 
to these textiles have been studied extensively, revealing much information 
about a valuable commodity that is rarely preserved in the archaeological re-
cord. Women occur repeatedly in the texts, engaged in textile production and 
also as their husbands’ representatives in commercial and legal dealings. Finds 
from Kültepe include characteristic pottery vessels and luxury items such as 
precious metal jewelry with lapis lazuli, carnelian, and agate beads and inlays.
To the west of Kültepe/Kaniš is the large site of Acemhöyük, which likely 
supported a karum as well. Two impressive palaces have been excavated there 
(19th–18th centuries b.c.), although little of their contents has survived, due 
to the ancient destruction by fire and modern looting of the site.40 Recovered 
from the Sarıkaya palace were rock crystal and obsidian vases, gold ornaments, 
beaded fabric, and several ivories—which can be associated with a group of 
extraordinary furniture attachments of hippopotamus ivory in the Metropoli-
tan Museum of Art. Acquired in the 1930s, the museum’s “Pratt ivories” can

now be attributed definitively to the site of Acemhöyük (Plate 32.4).41 Four 
ivory sphinxes and three lion legs, as well as a number of carved ivory plaques, 
belonged to a chair or throne of wood with ivory fittings; the ivories were ap-
parently originally stained red and gilded. This fine chair can be reconstructed 
in drawings, although not all the plaques can be positioned with certainty 
(­Figure 32.3). The Pratt ivories underscore the problems associated with unex-
cavated objects: had the pieces been found in situ, the form and materials of 
the chair could have been recovered, and the ivory plaques could be placed in 
their proper positions.
	
Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean
The eastern Mediterranean region was important in antiquity, with its tim-
ber, metals, and other natural resources as well as its access to the sea. Several 
technological advances are thought to have occurred there first, including the 
fabrication of glass vessels around the middle of the second millennium b.c. 
Stratum ii at Nuzi (Iraq) produced many fragments of core-formed vessels

(15th–14th century b.c.) in contexts indicating that these were luxury goods.42 
Colored glass was meant to imitate valuable stones, such as lapis lazuli or 
­turquoise, as shown from ancient texts detailing glass terminology and pro-
duction methods.43 Early core-formed vessels were likely made by rolling the 
core in powdered glass, heating the glass-covered core, repeating the operation 
until the desired thickness was achieved, and then trailing on the decoration 
(for a later example, see Plate 32.8).44
A substantial amount of wooden furniture has survived from Middle Bronze 
age tombs at Jericho (Palestine) and Baghouz (Syria)—a rare occurrence in the 
Near East, where wood normally deteriorates when buried in the soil.45 The 
pieces were well made but not ornate, perhaps not luxury items, except in that 
sense that the possession of furniture in general indicates privileged status. 
The Jericho tombs contained more than 50 tables, stools, and beds, along with 
platters, combs, and boxes, some with wood or bone inlay (17th–16th centuries 
b.c.).46 In many cases, the design, construction, and woods could be deter-
mined. Joinery methods included mortise-and-tenon, lap, and mitered bridle 
joints as well as a characteristic collar-and-tenon technique for joining table 
tops to legs, found well into the first millennium b.c. across a wide geographi-
cal area. Woods included acacia, ash, olive, poplar, oak, willow, and tamarisk.47 
Tombs at Baghouz contained wooden beds, round tables with removable legs, 
stools, and bowls dating to the early 2nd millennium b.c.48 Traces of food such 
as roasted mutton were found on tables from Jericho and Baghouz, no doubt 
the remains of a funerary meal deposited with the deceased.
Contemporary royal furniture is attested in texts from Mari (Syria), and 
actual evidence in the form of ivory fittings has been excavated at the sites 
of Ugarit (Syria) and Megiddo (Israel) dating to the 14th–12th centuries b.c. 
Recovered from the palace at Ugarit (Cour iii) were a beautiful carved head-
board (or footboard) of a bed and fragments of a circular table, both of el-
ephant ivory.49 Found in the Treasury of the Canaanite palace at Megiddo were 
the remains of ivory furniture and luxury items such as bowls, boxes, combs,

The Amarna Letters
Quantities of sumptuous objects are listed in the Amarna letters, correspon-
dence between the Egyptian pharaohs and rulers of several Near Eastern 
­kingdoms in the 14th century b.c.52 The tablets detail the diplomatic gifts and 
dowries of the elites, and indicate that luxury items traveled to—and were 
prized in—lands other than those in which they were made. Gifts from Egypt 
to the kings of Babylon included beds, chairs, and footstools of ebony overlaid 
with gold and ivory (ea 5); gold necklaces, bracelets, and anklets set with pre-
cious stones; silver sandals; silver and gold vessels and mirrors; silver ladles 
with handles of boxwood and ebony; gold knives, ladles, and other imple-
ments; boxes, figurines, combs, and headrests of stained ivory; hundreds of 
textiles of linen and byssos; and chariots and a cedar ship overlaid with gold 
(ea 14). Sent from Tušratta of Mitanni to Amenhotep iii were gold horse gear 
and weaponry; gold and iron jewelry; leather shoes decorated with gold and 
stones; garments and textiles of purple wool; vessels and cooking implements 
of gold, silver, bronze, boxwood, ebony, and ivory; and perfume containers 
holding precious scents (ea 22). If one wants a glimpse of the luxury arts in the 
Late Bronze Age, one should read the Amarna letters.
	
The Uluburun Shipwreck
Trade and commerce in the 14th century b.c. are brought to life by the finds 
from the Uluburun shipwreck, excavated off the south coast of Turkey between 
1984 and 1994.53 Recovered were more than 15,000 artifacts, the products of 
many different regions: Egypt, Nubia, Canaan, Babylonia, Assyria, Cyprus, and 
Mycenaean Greece, as well as the Baltic, Balkans, and Central Asia. Ten tons 
of copper were on board, in the form of oxhide and bun-shaped ingots, and 
nearly 1 ton of tin (which, if alloyed, would have produced around 11 tons of tin 
bronze). Around 350 kg of glass ingots were also on the ship, along with 18 logs 
of Egyptian ebony (Dalbergia melanoxylon), a section of an elephant tusk, 14

hippopotamus teeth, and a writing tablet of boxwood with ivory hinges. Gold 
and silver jewelry was also present, as well as a bronze figurine with gold plat-
ing. In addition to raw materials and precious objects, the ship held a large 
quantity of pottery, some containing the remains of terebinth resin, spices, and 
foodstuffs—a reminder that the contents of vessels were also valuable com-
modities. Metal and stone balance weights had served to facilitate trade.54
...
The Anatolian kingdom of the Hittites was a major power in the cosmopolitan 
world of the Late Bronze Age, although little survives of its luxury arts ­beyond 
a number of unexcavated pieces.55 Texts and temple inventories list Hittite 
cult items, such as maces and scepters, jewelry, vessels (with their ­contents), 
­furniture, and sculpture. Some of these were made of iron (an.bar), including 
statuary and a monumental throne. Once considered a Hittite ­monopoly, the 
working of “good iron” is now thought to have been more widespread.56 By 
the 12th century b.c., iron smelting was practiced along with carburization, 
which produced steel; quenching, which hardened the metal; and tempering 
(­reheating), which reduced brittleness and increased strength—creating a 
­superior material. This advance occurred in the Levant, Cyprus, and Aegean in 
the late second millennium b.c. and came to predominate in many areas in the 
first millennium b.c. The period is thus known as the Iron Age, its ­inception 
dated variously according to region.
	
Luxury Arts of the Iron Age
	
The Neo-Assyrians
While many of the major kingdoms of the Bronze Age had fallen by the end 
of the second millennium b.c., the power of the Assyrians increased, with ex-
tensive territorial gains in the ninth century resulting in all manner of tribute. 
Ashurnasirpal ii (r. 883–859 b.c.) moved the capital to Nimrud (Kalhu) in Iraq, 
where he built a fabulous palace decorated with sculpted reliefs and colossal 
guardian figures. The “standard inscription” found throughout the Northwest 
Palace lists the precious woods and other materials used in its construction,

as well as booty brought in from subject states.57 The palace surely contained 
many luxury items such as those depicted in the carved reliefs. A relief in the 
British Museum shows Ashurnasirpal holding a bowl and wearing bracelets on 
his wrists, armlets above his elbows, a necklace, and earrings.58 He is dressed 
in an elaborate royal robe, woven or embroidered with patterns and figural 
scenes. The king is seated on a backless throne with ornate attachments and a 
cushion, his feet on a footstool with sculpted lion’s feet (Plate 32.5). The famous 
“banquet stele” from Nimrud records the feast held by Ashurnasirpal upon 
completion of his palace (879 b.c.), to which 69,574 guests were invited, and 
featuring, no doubt, an impressive array of banquet furniture and fine table-
ware.59 A spectacular collection of Assyrian royal vessels and jewelry was re-
covered from three burials excavated in 1988 and 1989 in the Northwest Palace 
at Nimrud.60
The Nimrud tombs were vaulted structures, built beneath the floors of 
rooms in the domestic quarter of the palace. Tomb ii held the remains of two 
female bodies covered with textiles and gold appliqués,61 along with gold and 
rock crystal vessels, 18 gold armlets and anklets, 30 rings, 79 gold earrings, 90 or 
so necklaces of semi-precious stones, a gold crown, and a gold mesh diadem 
(Plate 32.6). The occupants have been identified as Yaba, queen of Tiglath-­
Pileser iii (r. 744–727 b.c.), and Ataliya queen of Sargon ii (r. 721–705 b.c.). 
Tomb iii contained an empty stone sarcophagus, robbed in antiquity, which 
had once held the burial of Mullissu-mukannišat-Ninua, queen of Ashurna-
sirpal ii. The tomb’s antechamber, however, was intact, and produced even 
more objects than found in Tomb ii. Three bronze coffins yielded evidence of 
at least 13 burials of the eighth century b.c., along with such finery as a gold 
crown adorned with flowers, winged genii, vines, and purple grapes; also a gold 
spouted ewer with bands of figural and geometric decoration. A total of 449 
separate objects were found in the antechamber, the gold and silver weigh-
ing approximately 23 kg. The finds from the queens’ tombs were among those 
affected by the 2003 u.s. invasion of Iraq. What became known as the “Nim-
rud gold” was stored in the basement of the Baghdad Bank in 1990, along with 
works from the Royal Cemetery of Ur, and retrieved in June 2003. The objects 
have only recently been studied in detail; they have now been published by the

Thousands of beautiful ivory artifacts were excavated at the site of Nim-
rud.63 The first ivories were discovered by A.H. Layard in the Northwest ­Palace 
beginning in 1845. These include plaques depicting animals, sphinxes, griffins 
in floral settings, and “women at the window,” carved in Egyptianizing styles 
that have been attributed by scholars to Phoenician workshops. A second 
group, found by W.K. Loftus in the Burnt Palace in 1855, includes pyxides, bowls,  
handles in the form of female figures, and furniture attachments in Syrian 
style. Excavations under the British School of Archaeology in Iraq (1949–1963) 
produced additional ivories, such as the “Mona Lisa” of Nimrud, her “Ugly Sis-
ter,” and two gilded and inlaid plaques showing a lion attacking an African boy 
in a papyrus thicket, found in a well in room mm of the palace (Plate 32.7).64 
An entire room of ivory furniture was recovered in Fort Shalmaneser (SW7), 
which contained the remains of 19 magnificent chairs, assigned to north Syrian 
workshops of the ninth or eighth century b.c.65 The SW7 ivories are carved in 
a number of “regional styles” that have also been identified among ivories from 
other contexts at Nimrud and elsewhere in the Near East.66 In 1990, most of the 
ivories in the Iraq Museum were stored in the basement of the Baghdad Bank; 
in 2003 they were subject to the flooding of the bank vault at the time of the 
u.s. invasion. One of the plaques with the lion and boy from well mm was lost 
in the looting of the Iraq Museum.
The vast numbers of imported ivories at Nimrud—acquired by trade, trib-
ute, or capture—attest to the formidable power of the Assyrian kings. Such 
fine ivories are also found elsewhere, prized by lesser rulers as symbols of their 
authority and taste. Arslan Tash and Zincirli in north Syria, Hasanlu in north-
ern Iran, Salamis on Cyprus, and Samaria, the capital of Israel in the ninth 
century b.c., yielded ivories related in style and theme to those from Nimrud.

Luxury Arts of the Ancient Near East
Phoenician and “South Syrian” styles are in evidence at Samaria and 
elsewhere,67 bringing to mind the Phoenician craftsmen who worked on Solo-
mon’s temple complex in Jerusalem (1 Kings 5–8 and 2 Chronicles 1–7) and 
recalling the king’s ivory and gold throne (1 Kings 10:18). The seafaring Phoe-
nicians were known for their valuable products, most notably the expensive 
purple dye used to color textiles.68 Their metal vessels, gold jewelry, and glass 
beads and unguent flasks have been found over a wide area, ranging from the 
Near East to North Africa and Spain (Plate 32.8).69 As in the Late Bronze Age, 
luxury items and associated technologies circulated throughout the greater 
­region in the early first millennium b.c., facilitated by trade or enforced by 
colonial and military interactions. This resulted not only in Near Eastern im-
ports in the west, but also the adoption of Near Eastern styles, motifs, and tech-
niques, most famously by the Greeks and Etruscans in the eighth and seventh 
centuries b.c.
	
The Kingdom of Urartu
Other Near Eastern kingdoms vied with the Assyrians for regional control, 
including the Urartians in the area of Lake Van in eastern Turkey and north-
west Iran. The Assyrian king Sargon ii captured and sacked the Urartian city 
of Musasir in 714 b.c., looting the palace and temple of valuable booty: gold, 
silver, bronze, iron, and ivory weapons and implements; thousands of shields; 
33 silver chariots; hundreds of brightly colored and purple garments; chairs 
and tables of maple and boxwood inlaid with silver and gold; and the gold-
embroidered robes, ivory couch, and silver bed of the god Haldi.70 This text is 
of interest not only in terms of the items listed—it also provides an inkling of 
the quantity of valuable goods that existed in ancient Near Eastern cities and 
sanctuaries, only a fraction of which has survived.
Many extant Urartian objects are without archaeological provenience, 
due to the plundering of sites in the region. While luxury goods have indeed 
been excavated, such as wooden furniture with bronze and silver fittings from 
Altıntepe, unexcavated works are more numerous.71 Of 363 important ­Urartian

objects illustrated in the catalogue of an exhibition held at the Israel Muse-
um (1991), exactly 13 have an archaeological provenience listed (Toprakkale), 
but only six were actually excavated.72 Some of the finds from Toprakkale 
(­Rusahinili) are associated with the “Toprakkale throne,” a collection of fur-
niture attachments unearthed by locals in the late 19th century. Several were 
acquired by the British Museum, which undertook subsequent excavations at 
the site (1880), while others are in museums in New York, Berlin, Paris, Brussels, 
and St. Petersburg. Due to the circumstances of discovery, the “throne” is not 
well understood, and the extant elements are now thought to have belonged to 
more than one piece of furniture.73
	
Marlik, Hasanlu, and Ziwiye
In 1961–1962, 53 rich tombs were excavated at the site of Marlik in northwest 
Iran. Grave goods included exceptional gold and silver vessels, gold jewelry, 
seals, bronze and iron weapons, and bronze belts dating to the 12th–11th 
­centuries b.c. (Iron Age i).74 The excavated Marlik finds are particularly im-
portant because their archaeological context was intact. Especially noteworthy 
are eight gold beakers decorated with friezes of animals and mythical beasts 
worked in relief. A comparable gold beaker was excavated further to the west at 
Hasanlu in 1958, dating to the destruction of the site, ca. 800 b.c. The remark-
able context of this and other works from Hasanlu allows certain items to be 
associated with individuals: the gold beaker was carried by a man who died in 
the fire.75 Also recovered from Hasanlu were numerous ivories, some in local 
style and others relating to the Nimrud collections,76 as well as distinctive met-
alwork and jewelry. Excavations at Marlik and Hasanlu revealed important but 
formerly unknown cultures, a reminder that new archaeological investigations 
can and will augment our present understanding.
However one important Iranian site, Ziwiye, reveals little. “Discovered” 
in 1947, Ziwiye is the supposed origin of hundreds of objects of gold, silver, 
bronze, and ivory, exhibiting a range of Near Eastern styles and types. In one 
of the most egregious “forgeries” of provenience, none of the works “said to 
be from” the site was actually excavated. All derived from antiquities dealers 
complete with the Ziwiye attribution.77 The objects were supposedly found in

a bronze coffin, then divided up among the looters, and finally sold off. These 
included a gold vase, much gold jewelry, a gorget, gold plaques, a scabbard, 
a torque, and a belt fragment in the Metropolitan Museum decorated with 
panthers and bird heads in Scythian style (Plate 32.9).78 Following the initial 
discovery, the already-large collection burgeoned, with more pieces “from 
Ziwiye” appearing on the market (along with forgeries)—to the point where 
several bronze ­coffins would have been needed to contain them.79 The works 
were ­exhibited and published, and thereby integrated into the corpus of Near 
­Eastern luxury arts. According to one theory, the “treasure” came from “the 
tomb of a great Scythian king,” although there is no evidence for this supposi-
tion.80 A few items said to be from Ziwiye do reflect the Scythian “animal style,” 
including the gold belt fragment in New York. These led scholars to connect 
Ziwiye with the reported 28-year Scythian dominance of the Near East in the 
seventh century b.c. (Herodotus 4.1). But since the items were not actually 
excavated at the site, this cannot be substantiated.
	
The Scythians and Other Nomadic Peoples
The so-called “animal style” adorned all manner of works that constituted the 
portable wealth of the Scythian tribes. Excavated examples from the seventh–
sixth centuries b.c. include a large gold panther from barrow 1, Kelermes, 
found resting on iron scales of armor and thought to have belonged to a shield 
or breastplate.81 With the Greek colonization of the Black Sea region, Scythian 
objects began to exhibit Greek features, seen in a gold vase from Kul Oba de-
picting Scythians engaged in various activities, and an elaborate gold pectoral 
from Tolstaya Mogila with scenes of Scythian husbandry, animal combats, and 
floral decoration, both executed in the Greek style of the fourth century b.c.82 
Excavations have yielded information on the way metal attachments were 
used with organic materials, enabling garments, hats, shoes, and wood vessels 
with gold appliqués to be reconstructed.83
Textiles, wood, and other organic finds were amazingly well preserved in 
the frozen tombs excavated at Pazyryk and elsewhere in Siberia.84 The Pazyryk 
graves (fourth–third centuries b.c.) had been robbed in antiquity, but many

valuable items remained in situ: wooden tables, a wooden carriage, felt and silk

leather and gold decoration, and red leather boots trimmed with beads and gold

Luxury Arts of the Ancient Near East
	
Phrygia
A rare and unusual collection of luxury objects was excavated by the University 
of Pennsylvania at the Phrygian capital of Gordion in central Turkey, ruled by 
King Midas in the eighth century b.c. Bronze vessels, implements, and fibulae 
were found in great numbers in three royal tumulus burials, along with more 
than 90 pieces of fine wooden furniture and other wooden artifacts—the most 
spectacular assemblage of well-preserved wooden objects recovered from the 
ancient Near East.86 Tumulus mm, the largest, was likely the tomb of Midas’s 
father (Plate 5.1). The king’s remains were found on a bed of textiles that cov-
ered the wood of his open log coffin.87 Grave goods included three large bronze 
cauldrons on iron stands, 170 bronze vessels, ten bronze and leather belts, more 
than 180 bronze fibulae, and 15 pieces of wooden furniture—two inlaid serv-
ing stands, two stools, a chair, and nine three-legged tables, one of which was 
carved and inlaid (Figure 32.5). The stands and fancy table were made of box-
wood, with walnut tops, and inlaid with juniper in complex designs represent-
ing fertility symbols and emblems of the Phrygian goddess Matar. Research has 
shown that the furniture and bronzes were used for a funerary banquet held 
outside the tomb before the burial (Plate 32.10). The menu of the feast has been 
determined by analysis of organic residues from the vessels: a spicy lamb or 
goat stew with legumes, and a mixed fermented beverage of grape wine, barley 
beer, and honey mead.88
Tumulus P was the tomb of a young prince, buried with bronze vessels, 
fibulae, belts, iron implements, painted pottery, a glass phiale, and 70 or more 
wooden objects. These included several stools, one decorated with bronze 
studs, numerous tables, a small throne, a bed with inlaid headboard, and an 
inlaid serving stand of boxwood, juniper, and yew (Figure 32.6). Also recovered 
were wooden spoons, plates, bowls, a parasol, and 12 miniature carved animals. 
Tumulus W contained a boxwood serving stand, decorated with bronze studs, 
along with several wood plates made on a lathe—the earliest evidence for the 
ancient lathe from a securely-dated archaeological context.89 An unprecedent-
ed amount of information has resulted from the study and conservation of 
the Gordion wooden finds, regarding the tools, techniques, and types of woods 
used by the Phrygian cabinetmakers, as well as the optimum methods for the

Lydia
The kings of Lydia were tremendously rich, as indicated by their dedications 
and burnt offerings at the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi: precious metal ves-
sels, an iron krater stand, gold and silver couches, purple cloaks and tunics, 
gold statues, jewelry, and gold ingots (Herodotus 1.14, 25, 50–51). None of these 
splendid works has survived, but Lydian tombs in west-central Anatolia have 
produced many sumptuous objects from the sixth century b.c., although 
­unfortunately the tombs were looted. The “Lydian Hoard” consisted of 363

items plundered in the 1960s from four tombs; most were smuggled out of Tur-
key and eventually acquired by the Metropolitan Museum (Plates 1.7, 32.11, and 
42.4). Luckily, something of their context was retrieved, due to the sleuthing of 
journalists, archaeologists (including Oscar Muscarella), and the us Customs 
Office.91 This led to a lawsuit in 1987 filed by the Turkish Republic, and the 
eventual return of the finds in 1993.92

The Lydian Hoard comprised a magnificent collection of jewelry, silver and 
bronze vessels and implements, and goldsmith’s tools, as well as fragments of 
wall paintings and stone tomb furniture—constituting the most important 
evidence by far for the luxury arts of Lydia. The works reflect a number of tra-
ditions, including Achaemenid and East Greek. A gold brooch in the form of a 
hippocamp is now the most famous of the group, as it was stolen and copied 
(Plates 42.4–42.5), and the fake was placed on display in the Uşak Archaeo-
logical Museum.93 The real hippocamp was located in Germany in 2012 and 
returned to Turkey in 2013.
	
Babylon and Persia
Nebuchadnezzar (r. 605–562 b.c.) rebuilt the city of Babylon, which, accord-
ing to Herodotus, surpassed in splendor any city of his day. However, little is 
left of the Neo-Babylonian luxury arts beyond the small finds excavated from 
graves in the Merkes sector of Babylon. Herodotus reported on the contents of 
the lower shrine at Babylon (Esagila), in which a large gold statue of Marduk 
(“Zeus”) was seated on a gold throne with a gold footstool and gold table. The 
shrine on the ziggurat (Etemenanki) contained a gold table and couch covered 
with rich textiles, said to be used by Marduk when he visited the sanctuary. 
Herodotus noted but did not describe the many private offerings in the sacred 
precinct (Herodotus 1.181–183).
Babylon was captured in 539 b.c. by the Persian king Cyrus the Great. As 
with the Ishtar Gate and Processional Way at Babylon, colorful brickwork was 
also used by the Persians. Glazed brick archers from the Apadana at Susa in 
western Iran provide evidence of the elegant garments worn by the elite.94 
Such garments are shown on the reliefs of Persepolis, along with the kinds of 
objects valued by the Persians and their subjects, who bear tribute from all 
over the realm: vessels, armlets, weapons, skins, and ivory (Plate 32.12). Fine 
furniture and accoutrements are also shown on the reliefs, notably those from 
the Treasury, which feature the king’s ornate throne with its plush cushions, 
his footstool, and incense burners on stands (Plate 2.2). The material wealth 
of Persia was legendary in antiquity—from the Persian spoils of the battle of 
Plataea (479 b.c.) to the treasures found by Alexander when he entered Perse-
polis—but little of this finery has survived.
A small number of works like those on the reliefs have been excavated at 
Persepolis, Pasargadae, and Susa. However, most Persian luxury objects lack 
archaeological context. Already mentioned are the Achaemenid silver ­vessels 
from the Lydian Hoard. To these must be added the mysterious “Oxus ­Treasure”

Luxury Arts of the Ancient Near East
in the British Museum, considered the most important collection of extant 
Persian metalwork (Plates 1.2–1.3).95 The “treasure” comprises around 180 gold 
and silver artifacts supposedly discovered “on the banks of the Oxus” (Amu 
Darya) in Central Asia around 1877–1880, at the time of the second Afghan 
war. The story of its acquisition involves a cache of valuable antiquities stolen 
from Bokharan merchants east of Kabul; the recovery of much (but not all) of 
the treasure, by assistance of Captain Francis Burton of the 2nd Bengal Lanc-
ers; its sale to local dealers and then purchase by collectors in Rawalpindi; and 
its subsequent bequest in 1897 to the British Museum. Unfortunately, there is 
no evidence that the objects acquired by the museum constitute a coherent 
group, or that all actually came from the Oxus River site.96 As with the other 
“treasures” already considered, forgeries are also an issue. It is unclear, then, 
how much the collection can tell us about the luxury arts of Persia.
...
The campaigns of Alexander brought an end to the Persian Empire, with the 
sack and burning of Persepolis, “the richest city under the sun,” in 330 b.c. 
(Diodorus 17.70–72). The East came under Hellenizing influence, reflected in 
the arts of the Seleucids and Parthians. This included Bactria (Afghanistan), 
with fabulous finds from Ai Khanum and Begram such as ivory furniture at-
tachments and other luxury goods. The so-called Bactrian Hoard from Tillya 
Tepe comprised thousands of gold items as well as textiles and organic resi-
dues excavated from six tombs dated to the first century a.d.97 This important 
aftermath, however, is beyond the scope of the present inquiry.
As this account makes clear, the story of luxury arts in the ancient Near 
East is predicated on the accidents of discovery. Always prone to reposses-
sion and melting down for reuse, ancient metalwork did not often survive; 
­organic ­remains are even rarer. It is also a story of excavated and unexcavated 
artifacts, as well as authentic works and forgeries. As sumptuous items were 
highly coveted in antiquity and thus amenable to theft and plunder, so they 
are in ­modern times. Looters target such objects, which creates a market for 
fakes. The issue of forgery relates not only to individual works but also to 
provenience. Archaeological provenience is often manufactured, hampering 
­attempts to reconstruct an accurate history. This type of forgery extends to the

positing of coherent groups of (plundered) finds—often dubbed “hoards” or 
“treasures”—as well as romantic (but fabricated) scenarios for their burial and 
discovery. In an extreme case of multiple forgery, the Dorak Treasure was likely 
invented in every respect. All these issues must be considered when address-
ing the topic. When one does so, the narrative becomes more problematic, but 
more intriguing—and surely closer to the truth.

chapter 33
The Literature of Loot: Notes on The Lie Became 
Great and Its Heirs
Roger Atwood 
Oscar White Muscarella’s book, The Lie Became Great: The Forgery of An-
cient Near Eastern Cultures, was published in 2000 by an obscure (at least to 
American readers) academic press in the Netherlands. The book dealt with 
an ­issue—the forgery of antiquities and its pernicious effect on the historical 
­record—that drew little interest outside the worlds of archaeology and mu-
seum curatorship. Its cover price of $100 meant it was unlikely to sell many 
copies or find its way into many libraries, and today not even the Library of 
Congress lists the book in its catalogue. In its first few years in print the book 
received little public attention, although it won some positive reviews in spe-
cialized journals.
Yet the impact and reputation of The Lie Became Great has grown substan-
tially over the years. Muscarella’s book described ethically dubious practices 
in the antiquities acquisitions programs at major museums and, in doing so, 
anticipated many of the findings and arguments that appeared in popular and 
scholarly accounts of the illicit antiquities trade in the decade that followed. 
He connected the problems of looting and forgeries, describing how the for-
mer opened the door to the latter, in a way that was repeated in many later 
accounts. With its polemical, at times combative style, and its wealth of facts, 
Muscarella’s book, even in its relative obscurity, set a tone and a standard for 
accuracy for much of the later literature on the antiquities issue.
Most importantly, Muscarella’s book asserted a vital public interest in the 
subject. He argued that the ethical lapses that he had witnessed at the Metro-
politan Museum of Art, where he was a distinguished curator, and at other mu-
seums were not solely the concern of the institutions themselves, as they had 
long assumed, but instead implicated the general public through the prestige 
and tax benefits accorded those institutions and their donors. Every one of us 
had a stake in the way looting and forgeries were distorting our understanding

of the past, Muscarella argued, and in that sense his book offered a pioneering, 
even prophetic voice.
Like its author, The Lie Became Great did not go away quietly. Articles in The 
Village Voice1 and Archaeology2 and later on Internet sites3 spread the book’s 
message even as the book itself remained stubbornly difficult to find, and 
as the Met’s leadership tried to ignore and isolate Muscarella. Over the past 
­decade, The Lie Became Great has gained something of a cult following among 
reporters and writers investigating the complicity of major museums in the 
illicit antiquities trade.
Muscarella’s influence crops up in most important accounts of the scandals 
facing museums over their antiquities acquisitions, as this paper will show. 
One such work is Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini’s investigation of the 
Italian antiquities racket and its patrons, The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit 
­Journey of Looted Antiquities, of 2006.4 Their book recounts Muscarella’s role in 
raising the alarms about the likely illegal provenience of the Euphronios krater 
and other star acquisitions at the Met, the museum’s repeated efforts to sack 
him, and then his vindication when the vase’s illicit origin became undeniable. 
(Ownership of the krater was ceded to Italy shortly after publication of their 
book, and the vase was returned to Italy in 2008.)
“Except in passing, this is not a book about Oscar Muscarella,” write Wat-
son and Todeschini, in a backhanded acknowledgement of their debt—and 
ours—to the dissident curator.5 Their book, like other inquiries into the illicit 
antiquities trade, effectively confirmed the assertions that Muscarella had 
been making about shoddy practices at major museums for three decades and 
most comprehensively in The Lie Became Great. These studies, including Jason 
Felch and Ralph Frammolino’s Chasing Aphrodite: The Hunt for Looted Antiqui-
ties at the World’s Richest Museum and my own Stealing History: Tomb Raiders, 
Smugglers, and the Looting of the Ancient World, offered evidence from the field 
that frequently coincided with Muscarella’s warnings, even if those studies did 
not necessarily rely on his work as source material. Such journalistic investiga-
tions, in books as well as in print, broadcast, and electronic news media, have 
played a critical role in bringing the issue of undocumented antiquities out of 
the rarefied realm of curatorship and into the general public’s gaze, with a pro-
found impact on museums’ standing and their collecting practices.

The Literature of Loot
“Museums continue with impunity to play their self-serving, self-­protecting 
roles in denying or avoiding the problems, and they successfully convince all 
­authority that their behavior is strictly a private matter,” Muscarella wrote  
18 years ago.6 I believe that this statement would not be entirely accurate  
today, particularly the last clause, in part because of Muscarella’s own ­efforts. 
Museums can no longer maintain that their purchase of ­undocumented 
­antiquities is “strictly a private matter.” Yet the scandals, pressures, and 
­exposés they have faced over the last decade have only strengthened the valid-
ity of his book’s core message, as I interpret it: that no one should buy or sell 
­antiquities. One should not buy antiquities because if they are not fake they 
are almost certainly looted, and if they are looted one is contributing to the 
plunder of ancient sites by buying them, as Muscarella asserts. “Collecting an-
cient ­artifacts—antiquities—is inherently immoral and unethical,” he writes. 
“­Collecting antiquities is to archaeology as rape is to love.”7
As noted earlier, it is not easy to find a copy of The Lie Became Great, and so 
a description of its contents is warranted. The book is divided into three main 
sections. The first is a 29-page essay titled “Introduction and Polemic: The Forg-
ery Culture,” which describes how museums had been acquiring and display-
ing fake Near Eastern “antiquities” for decades with the complicity of directors, 
funders, curators, and some archaeologists. This essay is an angry indictment 
of museum collecting practices, and I will discuss it in detail below.
The second and third sections of the book are of more specialist interest 
yet are clearly aimed at grounding the arguments made in the first. The au-
thor starts with an annotated, nearly 200-page-long catalogue of Near ­Eastern 
artifacts in museums in North America, Europe, and Israel that he believes 
are fakes, and in the third section presents 300 pages of black-and-white 
plates of most of the offending pieces. Together they offer a sad but absorb-
ing lesson in the creativity of forgers and the human frailties of misled buy-
ers and curators. The museums holding these pieces include the Metropolitan 
­Museum, for which he lists 43 pieces that he believes are fakes, the Bible Lands 
­Museum (17), the British Museum (13), and the Museum of Fine Arts Boston 
(seven), among many others. The writing here is pointed and direct. He de-
scribes a piece claiming to be an Elamite roundel at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art as “coarse and gross—the hair lines, the lips, the moustache, 
the eyes (with holes for pupils) and eyebrows … The piece has no archaeo-
logical value.”8 In places he speculates on the forgers’ method. “Comparison

with genuine Scythian stags,” he writes on an allegedly Scythian gold stag in 
the Seattle Art Museum, “demonstrates that this and the following examples 
were not made in antiquity … This (photograph) and the following examples 
were certainly made in a factory that specialized in poor copies of dead, not 
live and lively, animals.”9 The cloak worn by a Sumerian statuette at the Met is 
“mechanically executed and the fold at the left arm is unique; the hands, mus-
culature, head, facial expression say 1940s.”10 The corresponding photograph of 
this piece shows a man with a cloak or blanket draped over his arm rather like 
a bartender holding a towel.
Muscarella’s judgments are not always so sweeping, however. He acknowl-
edges that other experts have challenged his interpretations on a few pieces 
and describes some artifacts as simply suspect, suggesting the need for further 
forensic laboratory tests. For example, an Urartian plaque in the British Mu-
seum depicts “what seems to be a cute-faced deity, with very projecting horns, 
in a winged disc. The execution of the hands and head make one think they 
may not be ancient; a laboratory probe would help.”11 Some pieces he attacks 
as obvious or “clumsy” frauds12; others he merely questions, urging caution in 
admitting them to the historical record.
Muscarella’s speculation on the forgers’ craft—on why they give an Assyr-
ian statuette a certain kind of smile, or why they make models from dead ani-
mals instead of live ones—found confirmation of sorts in later, on-the-ground 
­reporting on the Near Eastern forgeries racket and its cohabitation with ­looting. 
Nina Burleigh’s Unholy Business of 2008, for example, describes the forgers’ lab-
oratories and their tools and techniques, which include copying ancient styles 
and materials and crude methods such as applying dentist drills and diamond-
cutters to achieve the desired effect.13 The Lie Became Great ­appears to be one 
of Burleigh’s main text sources (she describes it as “his bombshell book”), and 
she relays its arguments in some detail14 in another example of Muscarella’s 
research finding its way into a wider readership.
Eight years after his book’s publication, Muscarella was still evidently alone 
at the Metropolitan Museum, and rare in the entire museum world in com-
bining scholarly rigor with inside knowledge of the extent of fakes in major 
institutions and the willingness to expose the problem. Like insiders in the

tobacco industry, he had a story to tell and other writers came to him to hear it. 
His attacks on Met acquisition practices found still more resonance in Sharon 
Waxman’s Loot: The Battle over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World, pub-
lished almost simultaneously with Burleigh’s book. Waxman also cites The Lie 
Became Great, although her book focuses on European colonial pillage as well 
as contemporary looting. Waxman tries to capture Muscarella’s temperament 
more than other authors, saying that he often sounds “unhinged”15 and “under-
standably embittered,”16 but acknowledges his role as a lonely truth-teller on 
the Euphronios krater: “his presence is especially aggravating, one suspects, for 
his having been right.”17
The essay that opens The Lie Became Great is Muscarella’s cri de coeur 
against the cynicism and ethical rot that he sees at the heart of museum antiq-
uities departments. They buy or accept forgeries and then refuse to acknowl-
edge or correct the error out of fear of alienating rich donors, he asserts. He 
describes threats and reprisals against the few scholars who denounce fakes, 
conspiracies of silence by cowed curators, and craven directors interested only 
in pleasing trustees and bagging trophies. The lack of accountability he de-
scribes is shocking. The examples he cites, gathered over a career in curating 
and archaeology, do not name individual people, but presumably many read-
ers will know to whom he refers, and some may recognize themselves. The 
reliance on unnamed sources and anonymous anecdotes gives the account an 
insular, even gossipy tone, as if the author’s intention was to shame museums 
into reforming themselves from the inside, instead of inviting scrutiny or pres-
sure from journalists or government regulators on the outside.
“In rare instances a museum curator will inform the Director that an object 
on exhibit is a forgery and should be removed. The indignant Director orders 
the object to be left in place, establishing that he is boss, he will determine 
what is exhibited in his museum,” writes Muscarella. “He also reinforces his 
reputation as an astute Director, whose knowledge and control of what is or is 
not to be exhibited will not be called into question.”18
The fear of reprisal has infected every corner of scholarship, Muscarella 
writes. Professors refrain from denouncing fakes in museums or private col-
lections out of a well-founded fear of losing jobs, grants, internships, or 
­recommendations—not just for themselves, but for their students as well.19

One ­professor, he writes, ordered his students never to raise the issue of forger-
ies with a visiting colleague whom Muscarella knew to have published “many 
forgeries as ancient artifacts … The students obeyed—fearing explusion, a 
poor recommendation, or scorn.”20 Not even laboratories, some belonging to 
the museums themselves, were immune from the pressure to validate fakes as 
authentic: “I have seen ‘laboratory’ reports authenticating a forgery with the 
dissimulating (I think intentional) conclusion ‘The gold is ancient.’ These re-
ports are themselves a kind of forgery.”21
This culture of forgeries has been perpetuated by “the Museum Ritual,”22 
an insidious code of silence about the magnitude of the problem to protect 
the reputations of curators, directors, trustees, and donors, he writes. “The 
­Museum Ritual” has another function as well: to prevent the public from un-
derstanding “that it is paying the bills [for the acquisition of questionable an-
tiquities] through tax deductible money—the latter being one of the best kept 
museum secrets.”23 Museums both rich and poor have been milking the tax 
system to build collections of bad artifacts, either fake or looted, he asserts. 
“These let’s-build-a-museum museums form their collections by purchase, but 
often by donations. Many of the latter are simply bric-a-brac, e.g. a plain vessel 
or terracotta lamp purchased during a tourist trip to Israel, or forgeries, either 
purchased locally or on tourist trips. In both cases, the donation is evaluated at 
many times the purchase price. I know of two of these write-off institutions—
which know that the irs will not touch them.”24
Muscarella here is alluding to the fact that collectors are entitled to take a 
federal tax deduction for the value of art, including antiquities, that they do-
nate to museums. The fact that most such antiquities have no record of archae-
ological excavation means that u.s. taxpayers are paying retroactively for the 
acquisition of looted artifacts or worthless fakes. This abuse of the federal tax 
code to underwrite looting and forgery may not have been as obscure as Mus-
carella believed, yet its role as a tool to amass tainted artifacts has since drawn 
much more scrutiny. Stealing History explores how museums have gamed the 
tax-deduction system to develop collections of artifacts that could only reach 
the market through illicit means.25 Later in the book I propose the creation of 
an irs committee that would evaluate such acquisitions and, if appropriate,

The Literature of Loot
recommend criminal inquiry (an idea praised by reviewers but which, I admit, 
seems to have gone nowhere.)26 Felch and Frammolino report in detail on the 
Getty Museum’s use of tax schemes to leverage the acquisition of antiquities 
that were legally dubious or fake. The museum’s first antiquities curator, Jiří 
Frel, “had been fooled repeatedly or had taken to advising the Getty to buy 
fakes on purpose, likely in exchange for some cut of the purchase price,” they 
write.27 News media reported widely on irs investigations of the Getty in the 
late 1980s and ‘90s, yet until their book, Chasing Aphrodite, the specific connec-
tion with the acquisition of forgeries or recently looted artifacts, as opposed to 
artwork in general, had not been clearly established.
More than any recent publication, in my opinion, Chasing Aphrodite puts a 
flesh-and-bones narrative on Muscarella’s portrayal of the arrogance, corrup-
tion, and coercion that have prevailed at some American art museums. The 
compelling story that Felch and Frammolino tell of the Getty’s purchase of the 
Kouros in 1985 and its later revelation as a possible fake could be read almost 
as a Muscarella case study (although, ironically, their book does not cite The Lie 
Became Great by name, and there is no indication the authors were aware of 
it). Both books demonstrate the power of greed and big capital to subvert not 
just institutions, but our understanding of history itself. As Muscarella writes: 
“What collectors share as the source for their power to destroy world history 
is wealth; one must have a collection of money in order to collect antiquities. 
This wealth infiltrates all museums … and it thereby controls them.”28 That 
would be a fitting description for the Getty as reported by Chasing Aphrodite.
Many later authors follow Muscarella in articulating the symbiotic connec-
tion between looting and forgery, a concept perhaps not so widely understood 
when he was writing. Since there is no record of where and when looted arti-
facts are found, fakes can be easily mixed in with them and find their way into 
museums and private collections alongside looted but genuine artifacts. One 
trade relies on the other, and they both exist in opposition to archaeology. The 
Medici case showed dramatically how looting and forgery flock together and 
the pains that antiquities buyers must take to separate them. Italian suppli-
ers took photographs of looted artifacts fresh from the ground, the pieces still 
encrusted with dirt, in part so that buyers could see proof that the artifacts 
were recently plundered and not forgeries.29 Presumably the sellers’ assur-
ances alone would not have been good enough. Seized by authorities, those

photographs later served as prima facie criminal evidence, a fact that under-
lines the impunity with which the suppliers thought they operated. Their plun-
der reached the market alongside fakes through what Muscarella calls bazaar 
archaeology.
“Bazaar archaeology has also given the modern world classes of artifacts and 
iconographies not revealed by conventional, painstaking archaeology; this cat-
egory includes many forgeries,” he writes.30 Whole categories of ancient Near 
Eastern art are known only through bazaar archaeology and therefore might 
be entirely fake, he concludes. He offers a long list of what he considers to be 
suspect artistic styles, including ten varieties of Achaemenian art.31
“Many scholars are enslaved to the bazaar culture,” he continues. “Their 
writings seek to compel the acceptance of its stalls as archaeological sites, 
according both equal privileges and qualities. Ignoring the magnitude of the 
plundering of sites, ignoring the bazaar’s role and manipulation of organized 
activity during and after the plundering, they are held in thrall to the statutory 
belief that an antiquity is always ancient. We are expected by conditioning to 
experience and welcome the gift of a newly discovered antiquity, when what 
we get is a newly born antiquity.”32 Here Muscarella might seem to be accord-
ing equal value (or lack thereof) to looted artifacts and fakes. Yet earlier in the 
essay he acknowledges that, inevitably, some authentic pieces without a prop-
er archaeological pedigree will have to be considered as part of the historical 
record. Such a quandary “cannot be avoided,” he writes.33
“A genuine plundered artifact is still an artifact made by ancient man. No 
one working with the mass of plundered or allegedly plundered material con-
tinuously surfacing will deny the need for some unexcavated objects to be 
evaluated on the basis of other unexcavated objects,” he writes.34 His stand 
on undocumented artifacts is, thus, not so much a dogma as a general, guid-
ing philosophy. His plea is for scholarly integrity, for accuracy, for that ­boring, 
hopelessly square thing called facts. In making the argument against allowing 
undocumented antiquities into the record, he argues that the object, like the 
human self, exists in a context. We know who we are by the people, places and 
experiences among which we move; the same is true of an object, and when 
the object is taken out of its context, we know much less about it than we 
would otherwise. It loses its identity, in a sense, and has a new, false ­identity

attached. “The unexcavated object must speak for itself,” he writes. “The sto-
ries accompanying it, for example that it is genuine, that it comes from a given 
site, that it formed part of an old collection, are anecdotes. They are utterly ir-
relevant (and they are usually blatant lies…) for evaluation of its real history.”35
Reading this stirring, empowering essay, and reviewing the hundreds of pag-
es of descriptions and photographs of fakes that follow it, one starts to wonder 
why museums were caught so off guard by the provenance scandals of the last 
decade. Surely this book—abundantly documented, passionately argued, and, 
as we have seen, very influential—should have put museum officials on no-
tice that the old habits were coming under new pressure. Other distinguished 
books appeared around the same time with similar warnings on the destruc-
tive power of the illicit antiquities trade and the degree to which its goods had 
compromised public collections, most notably Colin Renfrew’s Loot, Legitima-
cy and Ownership.36 Why were museums so slow to hear these voices, and why 
did they go to such lengths to deny their culpability as evidence mounted?
Here again Muscarella points the way to the answer, or at least part of the 
answer. With some important exceptions, media coverage of provenance scan-
dals facing museums was slow off the mark and credulous in the three decades 
after the unesco agreement of 1970. Reporters and editors generally covered 
museums as they would any other cultural institution, like a symphony or-
chestra or an opera company, and failed to delve into or even understand the 
ethical and legal questions that surrounded their antiquities acquisitions.37 
Muscarella offers a pungent example of this passivity on the part of the media, 
recounting at length an exchange in 1973 between a Met curator and a reporter 
for The New York Times. The reporter, he writes, ignored the curator’s warnings 
that the museum’s press office was giving deliberately false information about 
the origin of antiquities in the museum’s collection. (It should be said that 
“the curator” in this story sounds a lot like Muscarella himself.) The reporter 
then wrote a story that dutifully reported the official version.38 Those journal-
ists who looked into Met acquisitions policies or asked too many questions 
would face complaints to their editors from the museum’s own communica-
tions office, which, thirty years after the above-mentioned exchange, still took 
little account of the institution’s leading in-house critic. The Met’s communi-
cations director, Harold Holzer, was quoted as saying he had never spoken to

­Muscarella and added “I just don’t understand why anyone who hates muse-
ums would work in a museum.”39
News coverage grew sharply more critical starting in the late 1990s. I be-
lieve that the expectation of continued sympathetic press coverage, combined 
with such haughty disdain for even the best-informed criticism and a certain 
­naïveté about what journalists do, lulled the Met and other institutions into 
complacency and made them slow to grasp the strength of the uproar. Felch 
and ­Frammolino describe how the Getty spent years resisting accountabil-
ity and transparency as scandals mounted, as The Los Angeles Times delved 
deeper into its ethical issues, and as court cases in Rome and Athens gath-
ered momentum. Initially, like many other newspapers, The Los Angeles Times 
published glowing coverage of the Getty’s exhibits of questionable artifacts 
and reacted with skepticism toward ethical charges against the museum.40 
When media ­coverage shifted to a more investigative mode, and as litigation 
mounted, the Getty and other museums looked woefully unprepared to deal 
with the fallout.
Has museum culture changed since the publication of The Lie Became Great? 
Reading recent studies by James Cuno, one would be tempted to answer in the 
negative. Cuno, former director of the Art Institute of Chicago and currently 
president of the J. Paul Getty Trust, has written vigorous reassertions of the 
prerogative of museums to acquire antiquities that lack a fully and ­verifiably 
documented chain of ownership. Restricting the flow of such antiquities to 
u.s. museums is “not a solution, only a diversion,” he writes.41 But even Cuno 
sees that museums need to find a way to build their antiquities collections in 
a way that does not encourage looting; he suggests a return to the partage sys-
tem of dividing archaeological spoils. Other leaders, such as Malcolm Rogers 
at the mfa Boston, have striven to make amends with Italy and other countries 
that have taken a heavy toll from site looting. One can only assume that art 
museums have learned some hard lessons, despite the bravado their directors 
sometimes display in public.
I will close with a short anecdote. The first library I could find in London, 
where I lived at the time, with an available copy of The Lie Became Great was 
the Middle East Library at the British Museum. When I called ahead to reserve 
the book, the librarian said to me, “Oh yes, quite a few people look at that one.” 
Not bad for an 11-year-old book, I thought, and when I arrived at the library I 
found a well-thumbed, slightly scruffy tome.

The Literature of Loot
Evidently, scholars and curators had been reading this book with extreme 
care. A hand-written note affixed to the inside cover listed all the museum’s 
artifacts mentioned by Muscarella or referred the reader to the index. Where 
Muscarella left out accession numbers in his descriptions of nine questionable 
objects in the British Museum, someone had helpfully jotted the numbers in 
the margins. Armed with the accession numbers, I spent a couple of days try-
ing to track down the pieces to which he referred. Every one of them had been 
removed from public display. I could not be sure that they had been removed 
on the strength of the information contained in Muscarella’s book, of course, 
but given the detail with which they had been noted in the book, it certainly 
looked possible.

chapter 34
Oscar the Oracle: On the Publication of 
Unprovenienced Objects
Larissa Bonfante
Some of the best conversations I have had with Oscar have been impromp-
tu, for example when we run into each other unexpectedly in the halls of the 
Metropolitan Museum. On my way to the Dendur Court, I meet Oscar going 
hurriedly in the opposite direction, though never too hurried to stop and chat 
briefly with an old friend. Interesting topics inevitably come up—the interpre-
tation of a strange dream, a comment on the state of archaeology. On one occa-
sion I had a problem on my mind, and so I was happy to catch sight of Oscar’s 
speeding silhouette coming my way. “Oscar,” I stopped him. “I have a problem, 
and I would like your advice.”
I wanted to include an Etruscan mirror of the fourth century b.c., currently 
in the White–Levy collection, in an article about Greek and Etruscan bathing 
scenes (see Figure 34.1, Plate 34.1). Unfortunately, the mirror in question had 
been acquired from a dealer in 1980. This was ten years after the 1970 unesco 
convention prohibiting the illicit import of cultural property was drafted, and 
eight years after it came into force. The mirror was therefore, according to the 
guidelines of the Archaeological Institute of America, not supposed to be the 
subject of an initial scholarly publication. I explained my dilemma to Oscar, 
expecting that he would tell me I should leave it out.
As often, he surprised me. “I have written about that,” he said. It turned out 
that he agreed with my feeling that it was wrong for important monuments not 
to be made available to scholars, even if they are unprovenanced.
I went home and looked up the article he referred to. Though written thirty 
years ago, it takes on the very current, sensitive, and controversial issue of the 
initial publication of unprovenanced antiquities. Oscar prefaces this article 
with the following explanation:
The publication of unexcavated artifacts, objects acquired from the art 
market, and which derive from the plundering of ancient sites, has for 
some time occupied the thoughts of serious archaeologists. Because of 
the nature of their derivation process some scholars have argued that it is 
unethical to publish them, that such publication does not serve the needs 

709
Oscar the Oracle
of archaeology. Others have argued that these orphaned objects must in-
deed be published, that while illegitimately (both legally and morally) 
acquired, it is nevertheless legitimate, indeed necessary, to publish them, 
to share them, so to speak, with colleagues. At the request of James Wise-
man, the Editor-in-Chief of the jfa, I was asked to speak to this issue 
from the perspective of a review of a recently published catalogue of un-
excavated material. I chose to deal with this request by first presenting a 
discrete review of an appropriate catalogue, and then to offer in a sepa-
rate section my own views on the necessity of publishing unexcavated 
material.1
He then goes on to present the quandary facing a scholar who wants to include 
an object that lacks proper documentation as to its provenance:
To get right to the heart of the matter: is it possible to reconcile unam-
biguous opposition to the plundering of tombs and mounds with accep-
tance of the publication and citation of the material derived from that 
activity? The answer I suggest is that no matter how long or arduously 
one wrestles with this emotionally and scholarly charged problem one 
is ultimately forced (however reluctantly) to acknowledge the necessity 
of accepting the reconciliation. A moral paradox indeed, but archaeolo-
gists and art historians study the past, which, inter alia, means they are 
concerned with the artifacts made by ancient man. By the very nature 
of archaeological inquiry, which encompasses in theory a regard for the 
totality of the available data, exclusion of individual or classes of objects 
is not possible. To choose to exclude from examination those objects that 
legitimately disturb us because of the process by which they come to our 
attention would signify incompleteness of the data, and consequently in-
completeness of cultural conclusions. A scholar might choose to refer in 
his studies only to excavated artifacts and ignore unexcavated ones: but 
I would argue such exclusion would be archaeologically valid solely with 
regard for provenience, not when one is concerned with the corpus of 
artifacts. In this sense, those concerned with provenience must ignore 
unexcavated objects, those concerned with typology and quantification 
of material must not ignore unexcavated objects: they exist and are data 
to be disinterestedly examined.2

Impeccably argued by a scholar whose scholarly morality is beyond question, 
the article relieved my mind and quieted my conscience. In spite of Oscar’s 
well-known intransigence on the subject of looted antiquities and forgeries, 
and his insistence that an object must not be deprived of its archaeological 
context, his belief is that in the end the absence of such context is not suffi-
cient reason to keep an ancient monument from being published.
This unprovenanced mirror (Figure  34.1, Plate  34.1) does not drastically 
change our view of the iconography of the group to which it belongs, but it 
adds a particularly interesting example, and expands our understanding of it. 
The mirror is one of a number of bronze hand mirrors of the fourth century bc, 
once so brightly polished that they shone like gold. The Etruscan owner would

have seen her face clearly in the bright surface of the obverse, or reflecting side. 
Engraved on the back of some mirrors were mythological or genre scenes. In 
time, however, the rich patina in a variety of brownish or greenish shades that 
developed on these mirrors has obscured the decoration, so that drawings are 
needed to supplement photographs of the mirror engravings.
The shape of this mirror and the style of its engraved decoration identify the 
place where it was made. It is not quite round, as are the bronze mirrors from 
the cities of Etruria proper.3 Instead, its slightly oval shape is typical of a subset 
of Etruscan mirrors made in Praeneste, ancient Palestrina, the city in Latium, 
south of Rome, whose inhabitants spoke a Latin dialect but participated fully 
in Etruscan art and culture.4 Such mirrors were made in workshops that were 
originally established by Etruscan craftsmen, but soon developed on their own 
an individual, local Praenestine style. Style and decoration confirm this origin.
The mirror shows an engraved representation of a woman washing herself 
at a laver; it is the bridal bath, part of the wedding ritual so often represented 
on South Italian vases of the same period, as well as Praenestine mirrors and 
the related toilette boxes or cistas made in the same workshops, and excavated 
in the necropoleis of Praeneste.5 Though the bath was part of the wedding 
ritual for men as well as women,6 it was most important for the bride. A related 
scene on an Etruscan mirror in the Metropolitan Museum, the adornment of 
the bride, pictures her surrounded by attendants who comb and perfume her 
and adorn her with jewels (Figure 34.2).7 She holds a mirror in her hands, in 
which she looks at her reflection.
Bathing, in real life a logical reason for being unclothed, is a recurrent motif 
in classical art and a convenient excuse for illustrating the nude, especially 
female figure. Although it was long taken for granted that Attic vases never 
showed respectable women unclothed in this manner, and that images of na-
ked women always represented prostitutes, it has recently been shown that 
this was not always the case. Bathing scenes appearing on Attic vases of the

Archaic period, such as cups and other vases used in the erotic atmosphere 
of the symposium, represented prostitutes, but later scenes show respectable 
women who were Athenian citizens—parthenoi, brides, or matrons.8
Attic vases were not imported into Italy after the beginning of the fourth 
century. But fourth-century Greek vases made in South Italy often included 
representations of women at their toilette or preparing for marriage.9 There are 
at present approximately 20,000 red-figure vases from South Italy and Sicily:10 
they were widely distributed in Italy, and their style was influential for the art

of Etruscan cities, especially for Praeneste, which was the site of the workshop 
of the craftsman who made this mirror.11
On South Italian vases and on Etruscan mirrors of the fourth century, where 
washing scenes appear as part of the wedding ritual, the nudity of the bather 
gives the bathing scenes erotic connotations and alludes to the coming con-
summation of the marriage.12 The nudity of contemporary fourth-century 
statues of Venus, goddess of love, shown with containers of water, dolphins, 
or otherwise alluding to the bath, likewise refers to the naked bather’s sexual 
aspect,13 as does the mythological explanation for her nudity, also related to 
water and her sexual nature, a tradition later illustrated by Botticelli’s beautiful 
painting—that she was born from the foam of the sea, fertilized by the severed 
testicles of Uranus.14
The central figure on our mirror is alone, unlike figures in most bath-
ing scenes, where one or more attendants help the bride with her toilette 
­(Figure 34.2, Plate 34.2). She stands facing the basin to the right, into which 
water is pouring from the fountain’s lion-head spout, a traditional element of a 
fountain in both Greek and Etruscan art.15 Her head intrudes into the ivy foli-
age of the border decoration so that the berries above her head seem to adorn 
the thick mass of curls like a garland, perhaps alluding to a wedding garland. 
She holds up a mirror with her left hand, while her right hand adjusts her hair 
with a long pin (no longer visible).16 Behind her, on the left, is a fluted column 
with double base and Aeolic capital.17 On top of this capital is slung her hima-
tion, while from its left volute hangs a long reticulated object with a strigil at-
tached to its side.

The Etruscan mirror’s realistic details are of particular interest (see 
­Figure 34.1, Plate 34.1). We can recognize the object hanging from the column 
as a bottle for the athlete’s olive oil, covered with leather strips. The presence of 
the strigil hanging from this oil flask is unusual. The oil flask takes the place of 
the Praenestine bronze toilette box or cista that normally accompanies toilette 
scenes (see Figure 34.2): it looks more like the equipment of an athlete than 
that of a bride. The Aeolic column, in this context, looks like the pillar identify-
ing an athletic setting on Attic vases. In Athens the strigil was a standard at-
tribute of male athletes, though not as strictly limited to men as has often been 
assumed.18 It appears in athletic scenes on Attic vases, where a pillar or other 
objects hanging nearby identifies the scene as taking place in the palestra.
The lone female bather in Figure 34.1, shown with athletic equipment, would 
therefore in Greek terms look more like an athletic Atalanta than a bride at her 
toilette. In an Etruscan context, however, this combination does not constitute 
a contradiction. Such oil flasks and strigils have in fact been found in Palestrina 
with both men’s and women’s grave goods.19 Strigils are found in Etruscan fe-
male graves more often than in female graves elsewhere, and were evidently 
routinely used by Etruscan women in real life. Here the female bather, in prep-
aration for her wedding, is viewed as similar to an athlete at his toilette.
Another mirror (Plate 34.2), which is unexcavated, now also in a private col-
lection, was sold by Christie’s in its June 2006 auction,20 and published in their 
catalogue. Here too we see a bathing scene, with the nude bather standing 
next to a laver into which water is running from a lion-head spout. She holds a 
lock of hair in her raised right hand, while with her left she holds what seems 
to be a rolled-up cloth across her midriff.21 She is not alone, however. To her 
right stands a young woman pouring water on the crouching figure before her 
from a jug she holds in her right hand; her closed left hand holds a strigil. The 
pose of the crouching figure is a familiar one for bathers in Greek art, and has 
a long history behind it: it has recently been suggested that the model for the 
kneeling bather was a fifth-century painting of the nude Helen by the famous 
Athenian painter Zeuxis.22

bathing.

Oscar the Oracle
Etruscan mirrors, and particularly those made in ancient Praeneste, often 
have scenes depicting the pre-nuptial bath or the adornment of the bride as an 
appropriate decoration for a mirror traditionally given to an upper-class bride 
as a wedding gift, to be used during her lifetime and deposited in her grave 
after her death. Indeed, those mirrors that have been excavated and whose 
context is recorded have almost always been found in the graves of wealthy 
Etruscan women, alongside their jewelry and toilette articles, at times accom-
panied by imported Greek vases. Both bathing scenes and toilette scenes of the 
adornment of the bride show the bride surrounded by attendants who help 
her wash her hair (Plate 34.2), or adorn herself with jewels (Figure 34.2). The 
basic scene can be changed in many different ways, such as the one on the mir-
ror in the White–Levy collection shown in Figure 34.1 and Plate 34.1.
In some cases a man stands by, possibly the groom. Frequently an atten-
dant or older companion looks in the mirror and sees there the prophecy for 
the future of the marriage. This is the case on the mirror in the Metropolitan 
Museum (Figure 34.2), where the scene, as so often, is transported to a mytho-
logical world. The mirror shows Thetis at her toilette, looking at her reflection, 
which can be seen in the mirror she holds in her hand. Her bridegroom, Peleus, 
rushes into the scene and stops in amazement, his hair standing on end. What 
he sees in the mirror is not what we see. Rather, according to recent scholar-
ship, his gesture and his hair are signs of terror at the sight of the prophecy he 
sees in the mirror: the future conflagration of the Trojan War and the death of 
their son Achilles.23 His pose and gesture also suggest conflict: he realizes that 
his marriage to the goddess will result in tragedy.24
Clearly, these standard figures can be used like letters of the alphabet, to 
spell out a variety of scenes, including the traditional rituals seen here—the 
pre-nuptial rites of the bath, the dressing of the bride, the prophecy for the 
marriage—to set them in a mythological context, and to express a variety of 
ideas and beliefs about religion and society.
I have discussed a group of Etruscan mirrors whose backs are decorated 
with scenes of the bridal bath—as we often find on South Italian vases. The 
iconography of the oil flask and strigil, shown on the mirror in the White–Levy 
collection as part of the bathing equipment, confirms the fact that Etruscan

women had a different, more public role and one more equal to that of men 
than their counterparts in classical Athens. Even there, scholars have shifted 
from the view that all women shown bathing are prostitutes, to the view that in 
many cases they are respectable women engaged in a bridal ritual. The mirror 
in question thus brings up a number of relevant questions in ongoing discus-
sions concerning the role played by women in different ancient societies.
There is another aspect of Oscar’s argument that concerns Etruscan mirrors 
and Greek vases. In the 1970’s, under the guidance of its President, Massimo 
Pallottino, the Istituto di Studi Etruschi organized and sponsored the systemat-
ic publication of the Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum, or cse, containing some 
3,000 Etruscan mirrors, dating from the mid-sixth through the third century 
b.c. The format of this corpus is similar to that of the Corpus Vasorum Antiquo-
rum, the cva. There were good reasons for this decision.
Greek and South Italian vases are far more numerous than the mirrors, more 
widely distributed, and much more varied in origin, type, and style. Yet they 
give us much of the same kind of information as Etruscan mirrors, since both 
were decorated with images—less frequently with inscriptions—recording 
mythological figures and scenes of daily life that reflect the cultural norms of 
their societies and subsidiary decoration by means of which connoisseurship 
can identify hands and styles of local schools.25
Both vases and mirrors were the work of specialized craftsmen whose pro-
ductions could sometimes rise to the level of art. Both were easily portable, of-
ten exported, and frequently found far from their place of manufacture. Many 
vases and mirrors have been found in good condition or even intact because, as 
objects of value and special significance, they were placed in the tombs of the 
wealthy in Etruria and elsewhere in Italy—far from the workshops where they 
were produced. Like these vases, mirrors were prized in antiquity as they are 
today. And like vases, decorated mirrors often have no known find spot. They 
continue to be attractive for collectors, and are scattered around the world in 
museums and private collections.
For scholars, there is a wealth of information to be learned from the mir-
rors, from the figured scenes of mythology or daily life, and from their inscrip-
tions, tomb contexts, manufacture, workshops, provenances, and distribution. 
In spite of their frequently orphaned status, therefore, it is important to bring 
new Etruscan mirrors, and Greek vases, to the attention of the scholarly world 
as well as to the wider public.
Thank you, Oscar, for reminding us to look at the long-range picture, and to 
consider the effect of our decisions on the integrity of scholarship.

The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre: 
Afterthoughts and Aftermaths
Neil Brodie
Oscar has written long and hard about the involvement of museum curators 
and university academics with what he calls “bazaar archaeology”: the study 
of artifacts of uncertain origin and authenticity acquired on the antiquities 
market. One of the more insidious effects of this engagement, as he has noted, 
is that those involved can quickly mobilize to protect the bazaar from too close 
a gaze, either by obstructing direct investigation or by convincing colleagues 
that there is nothing there to see, that the antiquities market is not a proper 
object of academic study. The result is that it is easier and more profitable to 
study what are often looted artifacts than it is to study the looting itself, as 
Oscar himself can testify. In this contribution, I consider this issue further, and 
look at how even well-meaning academic archaeologists can and do support 
the bazaar, with special reference to the work of the Illicit Antiquities Research 
Centre (iarc), which was established in 1996 to research and raise awareness 
of the trade in illicit antiquities, and to the reasons for its closure in 2007.1
	
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre (1996–2007)
The seeds of the iarc were sown at a conference held about the trade in illicit 
antiquities at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research2 on May 20, 
1995. The conference was co-organized by the McDonald’s then director Colin 
Renfrew and deputy director Chris Scarre, together with Cambridge Profes-
sor of Assyriology Nicholas Postgate. They took for their points of reference a 
unesco appeal issued on December 31, 1994, drawing attention to the increas-
ing volume of illicit traffic in cultural objects, and a conference held the same

month in Baghdad to discuss the looting of museums and illicit excavation of 
archaeological sites in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War. The aims of the conference 
were threefold:
(1)	
To assess the nature of the problem, and particularly its legal aspects;
(2)	 To consider policies designed to impede the trade, looking particularly at 
codes of ethics for dealers, museums, and academics;
(3)	 To consider ways of improving the exchange of information between rel-
evant individuals and institutions.
There were 11 speakers at the conference, including archaeologists, police, law-
yers, and an antiquities dealer, along with 22 audience participants.
In July 1995, in light of the conference, its organizers considered three 
interrelated courses of action that might act to constrain the trade in illicit 
antiquities:
(1)	
To monitor the trade;
(2)	 To disseminate information about all stages of the trade;
(3)	 To influence opinion and promote the adoption of codes of behavior 
aimed at diminishing the trade.
To implement this agenda, in February 1996 the Managing Committee of the 
McDonald Institute approved funding to support the production of a newslet-
ter, under the editorship of Augusta McMahon, and in May 1996 it established 
the iarc, under the supervision of Colin Renfrew and Chris Scarre, with myself 
half-time as Coordinator and later full-time as Research Director, supported by 
an advisory panel of external academics and the association of Peter Watson. 
It was agreed that a Near Eastern Committee of Nicholas Postgate and Augusta 
McMahon would be maintained and publish the newsletter. The iarc was in-
tended to function as an “information clearinghouse,” gathering and dissemi-
nating information about the antiquities trade, including relevant laws and 
codes of ethics. Its aims were stated in a policy statement, reproduced here as 
Appendix A. The first two aims continued to guide the operation of the iarc 
throughout its period of existence. It was soon recognized that the third aim, 
however, which involved the tracking of looted objects, was impractical,3 and 
it was not pursued. Thus at the time of its creation, the iarc was not intended 
as, nor was it considered to be, purely a research centre. While there was a clear 
need for some original research to establish the “true scale of the problem” and 
3	 Because of the large number of objects and the opacity of the market.

721
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre
the “scale and nature of destruction,” the Centre was equally mandated to ef-
fect policy change by means of public and professional persuasion, a function 
that will henceforth be termed, for the sake of convenience, “communication.”
The iarc, along with the newsletter of the Near Eastern Project entitled 
Culture Without Context (cwc), was launched in October 1997 with a press 
­conference held at the Institute for Advanced Legal Studies in London. cwc 
carried a “statement of intent” on its outside back cover (Appendix B), which 
expanded upon the 1996 policy statement. Again, it emphasized the inten-
tion of the iarc to engage in communication, as well as a requirement to “in-
vestigate and make known illicit activities relating to antiquities.” The iarc 
achieved its final shape in 1998, when Jenny Doole—with her background 
in archaeology, museum studies, and, crucially, media marketing—was ap-
pointed, and I succeeded to the editorship of cwc, which, starting with issue 4 
(Spring 1999), extended its coverage worldwide. The new (and final) mission 
statement on page 2 of this issue of cwc attempted a distillation of the original 
“statement of intent”:
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre (iarc) was established in May 
1996, under the auspices of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Re-
search in Cambridge, England, and it commenced operations in ­October 
1997. Its purpose is to monitor and report upon the damage caused to 
cultural heritage by the international trade in illicit antiquities (i.e. an-
tiquities which have been stolen or clandestinely excavated and illegally 
exported). The enormous increase in the volume of this trade over the 
past twenty years has caused the large-scale plundering of archaeological 
sites and museums around the world. The iarc will raise public aware-
ness of the problems caused by this trade and seek appropriate national 
and international legislation, codes of conduct and other conventions to 
place restraint upon it.
Jenny and I devised a strategy and plan of action intended to implement the 
mission outlined in this new statement and documented more fully in the ear-
lier statements of policy and intent. As regards strategy, we decided our re-
sources would be deployed for maximum effect by focusing on reform of the 
market in what are termed “destination countries”—countries constituting 
the focus of demand where most of the sale and collection of antiquities takes 
place. Because demand is geographically circumscribed in this way, it is more 
open to investigation and intervention than supply. The supply of antiquities 
has a global distribution, as they can be taken from sites and monuments al-
most anywhere in the world. With our broad mandate and a staff of two, we 

Brodie
722
thought it would be an impossible task to attempt any serious research into 
the trade at the source, and that it would be pointless to campaign for policies 
aimed at site protection or law enforcement at the source, as such projects 
would be difficult to fund and thus be limited in effect.
With our strategy in place, we moved on to its implementation through re-
search and communication. Ideally, research in academia is curiosity-driven, 
but we were not in such a fortunate position: our choice of research topics was 
constrained by the iarc’s mission, which, as we understood it, called for re-
search into the nature and scale of the trade. Thus much of our early research 
was concerned with establishing quantitative estimates of the trade and the 
damage it causes, and investigating the organization of trading networks. The 
fact that our research was policy-oriented placed some further constraints 
upon its conduct. First, believing that policy makers are more responsive to 
facts than to theories, we decided our research had to be strongly evidence-
based. Second, we also understood that for maximum impact the research had 
to be timely—responsive to current events. Thus there was little point in em-
barking upon a substantial research project when circumstances demanded 
short quantitative or qualitative and often reactive assessments of different 
aspects of the market.
There was also the question of research methodology. It is considered good 
academic practice to structure and judge research projects by means of explic-
it questions and answers, a methodology that has been characterized as linear 
and targeted (and ideally suited for internal and external audit).4 The over-
arching research question for us was well defined in terms of nature and scale, 
but because there were no readily identifiable information sources, we could 
not disaggregate this larger question into a series of smaller, clearly defined 
questions, such as estimating the monetary value of the trade per annum, for 
example, or assessing the involvement of organized crime. The problem wasn’t 
a lack of imagination, but a paucity of data, compounded by the difficulty of 
acquiring or generating new data. Museums would not allow us to inspect 
their accession registers, not if they had something to hide at least; dealers 
and auction houses would not release information about their stock or their 
customers; private collectors wanted only to communicate with us by means 
of threatening lawyers; law-enforcement agencies liked to keep their methods 
to themselves; and even university academics working with looted material 
were obstructive. We looked on with envy at “hard” science projects where 
the data could be produced in-house using standard archaeological sampling 
procedures in conjunction with appropriate instrumental techniques. Thus 
4	 Strathern, “Accountability … and Ethnography,” 285–287.

723
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre
we came to recognize that our stance would have to be opportunistic in more 
ways than one. As well as reacting to current events, we would have to frame 
questions retrospectively in response to emerging sources of information, 
rather than gathering information to answer preconceived questions. Thus in 
contrast to most university research, which is curiosity-driven and conducted 
within an established theoretical context, our research was mainly empirical 
and responsive to circumstances that were largely beyond our control.
Research aside, our second challenge was to decide how best to raise pub-
lic and professional awareness of the problems caused by the trade. It had 
been recognized during the discussions preceding the establishment of the 
iarc that the standard academic practice of publishing one paper per year 
in a peer-reviewed journal or edited volume would be hopelessly inappropri-
ate for our aims. Such a practice would have restricted the audience to fellow 
archaeologists—a case of preaching to the converted—and would have failed 
to engage with the broader constituency identified in the iarc statements of 
policy and intent. We decided instead to communicate a continuous stream 
of information and argumentation through whatever channels were available. 
First and foremost, of course, were the pages of cwc, where we could publish 
substantial papers or shorter contributions. The Internet was still in its infancy 
when the iarc was founded in 1996, but one of Jenny Doole’s first jobs after 
her appointment in 1998 was to design and construct a user-friendly website. 
Other initiatives included the international conference hosted in 1999, which 
brought together representatives from 20 countries to share their experiences 
of the trade;5 an attractive report (Stealing History) prepared on behalf of the 
Museums Association and icom-uk, but written and designed with a popular 
readership in mind;6 and the preparation of a portable display for use in muse-
ums. We spent a lot of time traveling around Britain giving talks at universities, 
museums, and archaeological societies, and we were ever ready to collaborate 
with the media by means of interviews and articles. We also worked closely 
with professional organizations, particularly the European Association of Ar-
chaeologists, the International Council of Museums (icom), the Museums 
Association, and the Council for British Archaeology. Academic conferences 
were frequented—on the subjects of law, criminology, and museology as well 
as archaeology.
Although I have discussed research and communication separately, in prac-
tice they were interrelated. Working with media, for example, while ­ostensibly

an aspect of communication, often generated data and revealed activities 
that could subsequently be incorporated into research.7 Presenting overview 
or position papers at conferences might appear wasteful from a research per-
spective, but could be fruitful in generating new ideas and collaborations that 
again could feed back into the research process. Thus although communica-
tion work was primarily aimed at influencing public and professional opinion 
and effecting policy change, it also furthered investigation into the nature and 
scale of the market, both outcomes in accordance with the founding mandate 
of the iarc.
In 2002 the Managing Committee of the McDonald Institute appointed a 
panel of senior academics to review the work of the iarc and to consider its 
future development. The Review Panel comprised two internal assessors (from 
within Cambridge University, though from departments outside archaeology), 
and two external assessors (from universities outside Cambridge). We were 
asked to submit a report on our five-year achievements (1997–2002) and our 
plans for the next five years, should funding be forthcoming. We were also in-
terviewed. Our report included a summary of our strategy and what we consid-
ered to be its major outcome:
It was clear at the time of its launch that the iarc could either act as 
a campaigning organization, with a primary focus on raising awareness 
of the issues involved, or function more as an academic or intellectual 
resource, carrying out basic research. The first alternative was thought 
more likely to secure positive resolution of the problems at hand … The 
deliberate choice of a “populist” over an “academic” approach has meant 
that a lot of the iarc’s energies have been channeled into raising public 
and political awareness of the trade … For thirty years the uk govern-
ment had refused to sign the 1970 unesco Convention, yet within four 
years of the iarc’s establishment it had reversed its position. If nothing 
else, this is a measure of the iarc’s success as it has actively (and success-
fully) engaged in the political process, an unlikely outcome perhaps if a 
more conventional, academic role had been adopted.
The prospective five-year plan outlined how the iarc’s strategy of research 
and awareness-raising would continue, and it envisaged that over the long 
term “the iarc will become the internationally-recognized centre of informa-
tion and policy-formation as regards the trade in illicit antiquities,” while also 
7	 Media companies are better resourced than we were at the iarc and able to apply pressure 
on individuals and organizations in ways that were beyond our means.

725
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre
observing that “there are indications it has already achieved something of that 
status.”
The Review Panel returned a positive appraisal of the iarc’s achieve-
ments—one that echoed our own assessment. However, there were also criti-
cisms. The Panel observed that we had not done enough to attract external 
funding, particularly as regards communication work. It suggested, ­somewhat 
naïvely in our view, that as the antiquities trade is a lucrative one, fund-
ing should be readily available from agencies, institutions, or foundations to 
support awareness-raising activities. The identities of these funding sources 
­remained unspecified, and in fact the recommendation was a bit of a non se-
quitur. While it is true that the trade is a lucrative one, the money is to be found 
on the side of those who draw financial or material profit from it. It certainly 
doesn’t follow that any of that money would find its way to supporting a cam-
paign aimed at placing heavy ethical and legislative regulation on the source 
of profit. Nor does it follow that organizations with an interest in abating the 
trade would have anything like matching financial resources. What money is 
available from various ngos and foundations that have a mission to protect 
cultural heritage is more likely (and correctly in our view8) to be deployed in 
developing countries aiming to combat trade at the source.9
But the Review Panel’s objection to the McDonald funding of communica-
tion work was based on more than a pragmatic assessment of the availabil-
ity of private funding. The Panel expressed a doubt that the communication 
work of the iarc fell within the scope of the McDonald Institute, pointing out 
that the Institute’s founding Ordinances state that its purpose is “to further 
research.” I believe the panel glossed this wording as “to conduct research,” and 
I would argue in the iarc’s defense that preserving the research resource is the 
ultimate act of research furtherance. No matter. I also believe that the Panel’s 
opinion reflects a broader academic consensus—that it is not the business of 
universities to engage with agendas set by outside interests. It runs counter 
8	 Among the many inequities of the antiquities trade is the fact that insofar as cultural heri-
tage is an economic resource, the trade operates to the profit of what are by and large al-
ready wealthy collecting countries and communities, to the corresponding loss of the poorer 
source counties and communities. Disbursing internationally-sourced money to institutions 
based in the collecting countries compounds that loss, even though strategically it might be 
the more effective option.
9	 The Review Panel was not alone in its assessment of the riches that are available. I know now 
from subsequent experience that any university department expressing interest in hosting 
an iarc-like center is doing so in the hope of attracting large grants from unesco or simi-
lar organizations, not out of any altruistic desire to protect archaeological heritage. Interest 
evaporates along with the expectation of money.

to the ethos of scholarly autonomy. The Review Panel ended by questioning 
whether McDonald funding should be made available for the support of activi-
ties other than research, and recommended that funding be continued until 
2006, and that from 2006 onward the iarc should enter into open competition 
with other research proposals for McDonald funding.
The McDonald’s Managing Committee decided not to accept the Review 
Panel’s recommendations, so at the time we were not allowed to answer 
the Panel’s case against funding. In 2004 Colin Renfrew retired as director 
of the McDonald Institute and was succeeded by Graeme Barker. Then, in 
­October 2005, the Managing Committee decided that the McDonald Institute 
could not continue to support the iarc indefinitely, and that in future the 
iarc should seek external funding and enter into competition with other re-
search projects for McDonald support. By that time, the two internal members 
of the “independent” Review Panel had been appointed members of the nine-
person Managing Committee, and it seemed clear to us that the Managing 
Committee had decided retrospectively to implement the recommendations 
of the Review Panel, which we had still not been able to answer, and which 
we believed to be misguided. In those circumstances, we had no confidence 
that a proposal to continue the work of the iarc as originally envisaged and 
constituted would prosper in competition with “pure” research projects. We 
felt we would be forced, for example, to stop publishing cwc and fall back on a 
more academic publishing strategy of the type that had originally been judged 
unsuited for the job at hand. We further felt that any “opportunistic” research 
project we did submit would suffer by not adhering to the linear and targeted 
norm of its competitors. In one exchange with a senior colleague I tried to 
explain that our research was forced by circumstances to be opportunistic and 
exploratory, only for it to be dismissed as “not research” because it didn’t have 
clearly defined questions, techniques, and goals. The Managing Committee 
rejected a counter-proposal on our part for five years of transitional funding 
to support the ongoing work of the iarc while other sources of public and 
private funding were sought. In September 2007 our contracts expired, and the 
iarc was closed.
	
Afterthoughts
It is useful at this juncture to look at the distinction made by Michael Gibbons 
and his co-workers between what they call Mode 1 and Mode 2 knowledge.10

edge. Nowotny, Scott, and Gibbons, Re-Thinking Science: Knowledge and the Public in an

The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre
They consider Mode 1 knowledge to be the sort that, since the early ­twentieth 
century, has been produced in universities, characterized by the autonomy 
of the research context and the social and personal disinterest (objectivity) of 
the knowledge produced. Knowledge production is curiosity-driven, isolated 
and protected from social and political interference by institutional arrange-
ments such as security of tenure and academic freedom, and the knowledge 
produced has no necessary social value or application, other than the assumed 
benefit that knowledge is in itself a public good. Mode 1 knowledge is typically 
single-disciplinary, with problems set and solved within the academic com-
munity. Mode 2 knowledge, in contrast, is trans-disciplinary, and produced 
across multiple locations, including universities, but also various departments 
and centers in business, government, media, the military, and the broader 
community. It is instrumental knowledge, produced in response to real-world 
problems, and in active negotiation with end users because the knowledge 
produced needs to win their approval and acceptance. In philosophical terms, 
Mode 1 and Mode 2 can be seen, respectively, as implementations of “realism” 
and “pragmatism,” with all that implies about the ultimate goal of scholarly re-
search—truth or human well-being.11 Mode 2 knowledge might now be super-
seding Mode 1 knowledge, in part because of the increasing commercialization 
of research, but also because of the imposition by national and supra-national 
funding agencies of thematic research agendas. Even within universities, prof-
itable research into social systems is increasingly moving away from the lin-
ear and targeted norm of Mode 1 to an interactive and non-linear approach 
typical of Mode 2.12 Exploratory and opportunistic methodologies encourage 
researchers to “follow the connections”13 or “trace the associations.”14 “Mode 2 
encourages an open-ended approach to open-ended phenomena, and is posi-
tively interested in the uncertainties of which it is a part.”15 These “Mode 2” 
methodologies recognize that the researcher acquires agency as part of the 
system under study, and that the ideal of analytical separation in Mode 1 re-
search between researcher and research object is unattainable.
In retrospect, I believe the iarc to have been conducting something ap-
proaching Mode 2 research within a Mode 1 institution (though we didn’t

know it at the time). Our research context was formed by the problem at hand, 
not wholly by our own intellectual curiosity. We engaged at different times 
in collaborations with investigative media and with ngos such as the Muse-
ums Association and the Council for British Archaeology, with research that 
was increasingly transdisciplinary, incorporating insights and concepts from 
anthropology, law, and criminology. Our research was also “interactive and 
­non-linear,” following up “leads” whenever we could. We were also well aware 
that our activities were not confined to an ivory tower, and that we were en-
gaged with a market that was actively resisting our work when it could and 
dissimulating when it couldn’t. We had in fact become part of the system that 
constituted the problem, even if, we liked to believe, in a good way.
Perhaps, then, the Review Panel was right to recommend that the McDon-
ald Institute should stop funding a large part of the iarc’s program and focus 
on more orthodox research. A Mode 2 enterprise had no place within a Mode 1 
institution, and while its aims and achievements were considered laudable, it 
should, in common with other Mode 2 programs, seek external funding. If the 
Review Panel was right, however, it raises serious questions about the role that 
academic archaeologists might have to play as regards the antiquities market, 
and about how a research organization such as the iarc might be funded in 
the future.
	
Aftermaths
Archaeology first developed within a bundle of practices commonly referred 
to as antiquarianism, which included the excavating, collecting, buying, and 
selling of artifacts. Antiquarianism was then subject to a process of purifica-
tion, whereby an economically disinterested scientific practice was extracted 
as archaeology, leaving behind the antiquities market as a mercenary and ap-
parently destructive residue of non-archaeology. Histories of archaeology are, 
in effect, histories of this process of purification, from antiquarianism to sci-
ence. But once it became non-archaeology, the antiquities market ceased to 
be a legitimate object of archaeological reflection or research, and became in-
stead an object of archaeological ignorance and fear—the non-archaeological 
other. The separation of archaeology from the antiquities market has now be-
come institutionalized, on the archaeological side by codes of ethical practice, 
and on the market side by business confidentiality. The separation of the “don’t 
want to knows” from the “don’t want to tells.”
But the recent high-profile looting of archaeological sites in Iraq has shown 
just how artificial the separation between archaeology and the ­non-archaeology 

729
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre
of the antiquities market really is. Looted cuneiform tablets trace intercon-
nections between Iraqi tribesmen and senior members of learned societies, 
by way of shootings, museums, peer-reviewed publications, smugglers, pri-
vate collectors, arrests, university faculty, publishing houses, military person-
nel, executions, and private and public funding sources. Everyone is making 
money, though not everyone is getting shot. These interconnections show how 
antiquarian networks have persisted through to the present day and continue 
to sustain archaeology, though the networks have adapted and responded to 
changing social and economic circumstances and away from archaeological 
scrutiny in ways that archaeologists do not like but do not understand. They 
also show that while academic archaeology has attempted to insulate itself 
from entanglement with the antiquities market, it has failed.
Academic archaeology is a Mode 1 discipline. Although ostensibly con-
cerned with extinct social systems, it cannot be said to have developed an 
ethnographic methodology of the exploratory Mode 2 type described here.16 
Although alternative claims on archaeological heritage, particularly from in-
digenous communities, are forcing an enhanced social accountability upon ar-
chaeologists, there is still the feeling that it is an ethical matter, not something 
of central concern to and perhaps even a distraction from the archaeological 
research itself. Most archaeologists are not anthropologists, and as such they 
are not properly equipped to conduct research into the nature of living social 
systems such as the antiquities market. It is not surprising then that only a 
handful of archaeologists, if that, have attempted such research. Archaeolo-
gists are, in contrast, ideally suited to conducting research aimed at estimating 
the size of the market, by quantifying destruction on the ground or volumes 
of material being traded. It is more surprising then that so few studies of this 
type have appeared. I believe it is because such research is poorly regarded by 
the academic establishment as largely atheoretical and thus antithetical to the 
academic ideal. Thus it is widely recognized within the academic community 
that there will be no credit and career advancement for scholars engaging in 
such research. While the damaging consequences of the market are almost 
universally condemned, they are considered to be an impediment to rather 
than an object of archaeological research. Thus archaeologists are poorly suit-
ed by inclination, training and institutional expectations to conduct system-
atic or reliable research into the nature or scale of the antiquities market. The 
16	
Ironically, archaeological methodology, with its emphasis on exploration and excavation, 
should typify Mode 2 research, but it has accommodated itself to Mode 1 expectations.

730
result is a weak evidence base that cannot support the formulation, evaluation, 
or adoption of appropriate and effective policy responses.17
But if academic archaeologists are, for whatever reason, reluctant to study 
the antiquities market, by inclination and training many of them are predis-
posed to study antiquities, even unprovenanced ones. And many of them do.18 
There are well-established research programs offering endless opportunities 
for linear Mode 1 type research into corpora of probably looted objects such 
as Apulian vases and cuneiform tablets. The research material and funding are 
both available and accessible, while information of definite criminal prove-
nance that might deter research is more elusive. Academic credit accrues from 
this Mode 1 research, and career advancement follows. Archaeologists who de-
cline such opportunities and restrict their research to provenanced material 
are likely to see their careers suffer in comparison. For academic archaeolo-
gists it is easier and more profitable to study the products of a criminal and 
destructive market than it is to study the market itself or its consequences.
What, then, for the future? First, if the antiquities market is considered to 
be a wide-ranging social network, including archaeologists, and if the antiqui-
ties market is considered to be a problem, then, by omission or commission, 
archaeologists are part of the problem. They are not separated from the market 
by an ethical or professional distance, much as they would like to believe is the 
case, and they must recognize this fact. Complaining in the coffee room about 
colleagues who obtain grants and promotions through studying looted mate-
rial, while not taking any other action; excavating around the looters pits with-
out counting and investigating them; rejecting a grant application for research 
aimed at quantifying looting on grounds of “poor academic quality”—none 
of these actions are maintaining the purity of the discipline, they are instead 
facilitating the market. If a colleague wins a grant to study dubious material, 
complaints should be made to the grant awarding body. If evidence of loot-
ing is discovered during an archaeological project, it should be investigated. 
Grant applications to support research into the market should be judged by 
more than the epistemological and methodological criteria of Mode 1. The ma-
terial and social utility of the work should be credited too. Second, if academic 
archaeologists are poorly equipped or disinclined to study the market, they 
should reach out to those who are able and willing, and establish collaborative 
research relations with criminologists, anthropologists, economists, and even 
17	
The executive commitment of the various professional bodies that represent academic 
archaeologists compares favorably, to say the least, with the general apathy of their rank-
and-file membership.

investigative journalists. Third, the more senior archaeologists who administer 
or oversee research funding and audit should be more aware of the difficul-
ties of research into the market, and ensure that archaeologists who choose to 
study the market, or who choose not to study unprovenanced material, do not 
suffer professionally when compared to those who do study unprovenanced 
material.
Finally, how can an organization such as the iarc be funded, if universities 
are not willing to do so? One option is to raise money through charitable dona-
tion, as do many nature conservancy ngos. This field is an increasingly clut-
tered one, however, and it is difficult to persuade potential benefactors to sup-
port a venture whose perceived beneficiaries (archaeologists) are doing little 
to support it themselves. For another option, perhaps the “polluter-pays” prin-
ciple, which now underpins much commercial archaeology, could be extended 
to the market by the imposition of a small tax on antiquities sales, which could 
then be used to support a center. Antiquities dealers would most likely fight 
such a proposal tooth and nail, however, and even if it were accepted, the costs 
of oversight and administration of what is a diverse market would probably 
soak up much of the revenue. Neither option seems viable at the present time, 
and it is the answer to this question that the iarc Review Panel signally failed 
to provide. But if academic archaeology is unwilling to support such an orga-
nization, and if academic archaeologists are loathe to act in its stead, then the 
problems caused by the antiquities trade will persist, and the academic com-
munity will be culpable and should accept that it shares some of the blame.
Appendix A. iarc Policy Statement (16 May, 1996)
The volume of the international trade in illicit antiquities (i.e. clandestinely ­excavated 
and illegally exported antiquities) has increased enormously over the past twenty 
years. The demand created by this trade has fuelled the large scale plundering of 
­archaeological sites throughout the world and the resultant loss of information is 
great. In response to this destruction it has been agreed to establish the Illicit Antiqui-
ties Research Centre (iarc) which will operate under the auspices of the McDonald 
Institute for Archaeological Research.
The primary concern of the iarc is to reduce the loss of knowledge caused by the 
illicit looting of archaeological sites and museums. Issues of object ownership are of 
secondary interest. The Centre has three clear objectives:
(1)	
To assess the true scale of the problem. At present there is no central repository 
of information which pertains to the problem; the iarc will act as a clearing 
house for such information;

Brodie
732
(2)	
To bring to the attention of the general public the scale and nature of destruc-
tion caused by the trade, to promote ethical standards within the academic 
community, and to create a climate of opinion which will help to suppress illicit 
trade, by emphasizing that the true scholarly value of an artifact is irreparably 
damaged by its loss of context and hence of the cultural information provided by 
its associations;
(3)	
To trace and to make known the movement of stolen material of known prov-
enance and of unprovenanced artifacts which might derive from clandestine 
excavations.
Appendix B. iarc Statement of Intent (October 1997)
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre has been established in response to concerns 
expressed about the loss to our knowledge of the past caused by the illicit excavation 
of archaeological sites. It intends to:
(1)	
Raise public awareness in Britain and internationally about this issue and seek 
appropriate national and international legislation, codes of conduct and other 
conventions to place restraint upon it;
(2)	
Monitor the sale and transfer of illicit antiquities within the uk and raise public 
awareness of the scale of such sale and transfer overseas;
(3)	
Develop an overview of the national and international legislation bearing on 
these issues;
(4)	
Argue, as a provisional measure, for the widespread adoption of the central tenet 
of the 1970 unesco convention on the illicit transfer of cultural property, that 
unprovenanced artifacts which cannot be shown to have been known and pub-
lished prior to 1970 should be regarded as illicit and should not be acquired by 
public collections whether by purchase, gift or bequest nor exhibited by them on 
long- or short-term loan and should not be purchased by responsible private col-
lectors. It should be recognized, however, that local or national museums may on 
occasion be the appropriate repository for such unprovenanced objects as can 
be shown with reasonable confidence to have originated within the territory of 
their responsibility;
(5)	
Seek agreement among national organizations and museums in the uk on the 
appropriate policy for such bodies to adopt on the acquisition, display and pub-
lication of unprovenanced artifacts;
(6)	
Seek to cooperate with dealers and auction houses in furthering the evolution 
towards the understanding of such issues and the adherence to appropriate 
practices;

733
The Illicit Antiquities Research Centre
(7)	
Work with the Council for British Archaeology and other British bodies to en-
courage the application of appropriate principles to portable antiquities origi-
nating within the United Kingdom;
(8)	
Investigate and make known illicit activities relating to antiquities in the Near 
East, Egypt and Asia Minor and to publish such information in the periodical 
Culture Without Context;
(9)	
Select such other geographical areas for comparable investigation and publica-
tion as may be practicable;
(10)	 Establish working relationships with data-search organizations relating to stolen 
antiquities (i.e. antiquities which formed part of a recognized collection from 
which they were stolen) as well as illicitly excavated antiquities which have not, 
so far as is known, been recognized as forming part of a public collection or a 
major and well documented private collection;
(11)	
Promote educational measures which will stimulate and develop respect for the 
archaeological heritage of all nations.

Illicit Traffic of Pre-Columbian Antiquities
Clemency Chase Coggins
	
Introduction to the Reprinting of This Article1
Almost fifty years ago the resounding declaration, “Not since the sixteenth cen-
tury has Latin America been so ruthlessly plundered,” appeared in an article 
I wrote for the Art Journal.2 At the request of the editors of this Festschrift, 
“Illicit Traffic of Pre-Columbian Antiquities” is reprinted as my contribution 
(below). As an art historian I had written a jeremiad directed at my own pro-
fession, which seemed to me implicated in the burgeoning traffic in plundered 
pre-Columbian antiquities. This was news, and the dramatic assertion and 
subsequent enumeration of looted monuments in American museums was 
picked up by the press with its appetite for scandalous and illegal enterprises, 
especially if they involve revered institutions like museums.
In the sixties large carved Maya monuments (stelae) were being cut up and 
smuggled from Guatemala, Mexico, and Belize (then British Honduras) in 
steadily increasing numbers. Not a few of these were well-known, published 
stelae with documented provenience,3 and some had appeared in museums 
in the United States. As a graduate student in Maya art and archaeology, I be-
came involved when it was clear there would be few Maya sites left intact to 
study if the traffic were to continue at the same rate—and from my realization 
that many large American museums were acquiring these dismembered stone 
portraits and truncated texts, thinking only to cover their own tracks by hiding 
whatever documentation might exist.
Some university and research museums responded in the next few years to 
this critical problem of the acquisition of plundered antiquities by adopting 
acquisition policies that followed the principles of the new unesco Conven-
tion on Cultural Property (1970),4 although more museums went underground

and stopped publishing, or even exhibiting, their questionable new acquisi-
tions from the New World and the Old. These acquisitions, it must be empha-
sized, were not illegal in the United States, although such objects had, in most 
cases, been exported illegally from their countries of origin. The acquisition of 
plundered illegally exported antiquities was a time-honored practice that art 
museums were exceedingly reluctant to eschew.
In 1970, the United States passed legislation that prohibited the importation 
of ancient monumental Latin American art. Two years later the u.s. Senate 
gave its unanimous advice and consent to the 1970 unesco Convention on 
Cultural Property. However it took another decade for Congress to pass imple-
menting legislation.5 During those long years Oscar Muscarella was an inde-
fatigable advocate of the Convention, with his specific goal of protecting and 
preserving the archaeological heritage of the Middle East and, ideally, stopping 
the flow of looted antiquities. My work had been based at the Peabody Mu-
seum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard, which supported the unesco 
Convention; Oscar, however, worked at the Metropolitan Museum of Art—
which did not. This took great courage, fortitude, and persistence in the face of 
powerful resistance and retaliation.
Sadly, the unesco Convention, now ratified by 134 countries, has not solved 
the problem. But it has, finally, led to the adoption of acquisition policies at 
American art museums that acknowledge the principles of the Convention and 
the ethical guidelines of icom (International Council of Museums). ­Today, on 
the whole, the younger generation of art museum curators considers these the 
norm. For this we owe a great deal to Oscar White Muscarella.

In the last ten years there has been an incalculable increase in the number 
of monuments systematically stolen, mutilated, and illicitly exported from 
entry into force, April 24, 1972. Museums adopting acquisition policies conforming to the 
principles of the unesco Convention at the time: University Museum, University of Penn-
sylvania (1971); Harvard University Museums (1971); Field Museum of Natural History,

­Guatemala and Mexico in order to feed the international art market. Not since 
the sixteenth century has Latin America been so ruthlessly plundered.
The ceremonial centers and architectural complexes of the Classic Maya 
civilization are located in sparsely populated jungle lowlands. Few of these 
ceremonial centers have been scientifically excavated, although a great many 
have been mapped superficially. The ancient Maya civilization is still little 
­appeared as figure 36.1 (Map of the Maya area), and Plates 36.1–36.4 originally appeared as 
figures 36.2–36.5.

known and understood. Perhaps most important: its hieroglyphic writing is 
still largely undeciphered. Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions appear most fre-
quently on stelae which were erected, commemoratively, in front of pyramids 
and temples. These stelae also usually bear the representation of important 
Maya personages, and are thus in particular demand on the art market. In or-
der to understand any particular site it is important to know the original loca-
tion of a stela and its dates, and to be able to relate these facts to the function 
and organization of the structures in the sites.
Stelae may be as tall as twenty feet and weigh several tons, so it has been 
necessary for the robbers to develop techniques for removing them from the 
jungle. The commonest method is to use a power saw with which they cut ver-
tically through the stela and remove the face of it. Then they frequently cut this 
into quadrants, or even smaller segments, both for ease of transport and in or-
der to sell the pieces separately. In removing the face of a stela the inscriptions 
along the sides are, of course, sacrificed. Sometimes there is only partial muti-
lation when the thieves do not have adequate tools, or means of transporting a 
large piece out of the jungle. Transportation out of Guatemala is not as difficult 
from those sites near rivers as it is from those in the remote interior.
The theft and mutilation of monuments is not confined to little known, or 
unknown, sites where their loss, and the concomitant tomb-robbing, destroys 
all archaeological evidence. Monuments from sites which have been scientifi-
cally excavated and completely published, and which are known Guatemalan 
national monuments are also appearing on the market, and even in reputable 
museums. To a specialist in the Pre-Columbian field this is rather like finding 
your local museum has just bought the Arch of Titus.
This commerce must be distasteful to every civilized person in the twenti-
eth century. It is hard to understand that it can flourish so openly in the face 
of ­international agreements specifically outlawing the plunder of national art 
treasures. Of course the United States is not alone in its involvement in this 
trade. We are competing with European dealers and collectors. Museums and 
collectors everywhere now generally acknowledge that the two most open 
areas for acquisitions are contemporary and Pre-Columbian art. This would 
­suggest that while American art historians are now little concerned with this 
field they will in the future come to realize its importance. When that day 
comes it is hoped that American museums will not be filled with important 
Pre-­Columbian objects which were all illegally acquired; and that American 
archaeologists and art historians will still be welcome in Latin American 
countries.
On August 18, 1968, at Munich, the 39th International Congress of Ameri-
canists passed, by an overwhelming majority, a resolution condemning this 

Coggins
738
illicit traffic in Pre­Columbian antiquities. They also resolved to request letters 
from museums throughout the world signifying their intention not to partici-
pate in this trade. It is hoped that American art historians and collectors will 
endorse this resolution. Perhaps Americans might go further and organize to 
help Guatemala to map, to record, and to preserve its monuments. If these 
sites were better known and excavated it is very possible that the Guatemalan 
government (which is now suing United States Customs for the return of a 
stolen, mutilated stela) might organize the legitimate sale of registered objects. 
Such a program of legitimate buying from Guatemala might help support the 
organized documentation and conservation of archaeological sites, and help 
to improve access to some of the remotest important ones. It might also be 
possible to arrange exchange programs of the sort now planned by the Metro-
politan Museum in New York.
The Metropolitan Museum has assured temporary displays of the highest 
quality, and of documented provenance, by a reciprocal loan agreement with 
the Mexican National Museum. It should be possible to make a similar ar-
rangement with Guatemala, perhaps to train Guatemalan museum personnel 
and conservators if not to loan them objects from American museums. There is 
probably more scope for a program of this sort in Mexico because their system 
of national and state museums is highly organized and thus provides more 
possibilities for varieties of exchanges, but there are ways in which an imagina-
tive program might be worked out with Guatemala. It is essential that more of 
the unknown sites be located, surveyed, and recorded before they are all com-
pletely destroyed and exported piecemeal. Perhaps if private collectors who 
buy stelae realized that they could support an archaeological expedition for a 
number of seasons for the price of one stela they might become interested in 
such a genuinely significant contribution to Pre-Columbian art rather than in 
simply buying a mutilated object and donating it, without known provenance, 
to a museum.
Another important aspect of any program which might help Guatema-
lan archaeology would be its value in developing tourism, thus providing an 
­economic boost to Guatemala instead of the present steady drain on an im-
portant national resource.
This is a critical situation of international dimensions, but there has been 
very little international action. We hope that the United States, so often ac-
cused of imperialism in its relations with Latin America, may take the lead in 
helping to stop this systematic rape of a small country’s historical and cultural 
heritage; and in helping to implement constructive alternatives.
There follows an incomplete list of stone sculptures and reliefs which have 
been stolen recently from Guatemala and Mexico and which also happen to 
have some documentation. Little effort has been made to enumerate the many

pieces now in Europe. It must be assumed that those few listed objects which 
have been traced represent but a fraction of those stolen from each raided site.

it is a perfect example of the incalculable loss to the history of art such 
­robbing creates. In a museum, far away, there would be no way to connect 
this unusual stela with its proper site, and to understand its historical

“Usumacinta Region”
A great many objects are turning up on the market with a vague Usumacinta 
provenance. The Galarie Jeanne Bucher lists a number of sculptures which fall 
into this category, as do the Lehmann catalog and the Von Winning book, and 
many museums. A few of these are listed below.
Stela. Nine feet tall. Depicting figure holding mannikin scepter, dwarf at 
lower left. Sawed and broken into 23 pieces. Edges and carved bottom 
panel removed. Because this magnificent stela was exported illegally, as 
were all of these, it is necessary to describe its provenance in the vagu-
est possible terms. Surely it is the duty of the American museum which 
bought this stela to discourage the mutilation of monuments, and to pro-
vide significant information about the provenance and condition of its  
acquisitions.

Campeche (Mexico)
Perhaps the greatest number of objects recently stolen from the. Maya area 
come from Campeche. The Bucher catalogue lists 19 sculptures with this 
provenance.

Illicit Traffic of Pre-Columbian Antiquities
E. Wyllys Andrews describes a trip made early in 1969: “Despite intense 
protective efforts by the state government, the depredations in far southern 
Campeche and Quintana Roo are sickening. Most of the stelae have been cut 
up and shipped out. The large stucco facade panels which are so beautiful here 
have been torn apart, and often completely removed. And the vandalism of 
pot hunters, who travel in large gangs and methodically destroy architecture 
in search of tombs and caches is incredible. Hormiguero, which was until re-
cently untouched, was exploited by such a gang in recent weeks and now looks 
like a lunar landscape.”

Stela 2. Thieves were in the process of sawing off the front of this stela

Kohunlich, Quintana Roo—60 km. west of Chetumal. On May 14, 1969, articles 
appeared on the discovery of Kohunlich in Diario Novedades de Yucatan, Diario

ery” of the site followed the spectacular theft chronicled below.
Mask panel. About ten by thirty feet. Probably one of a set of six colossal 
masks which flank the monumental staircase of a pyramid. This fragile, 
stucco panel was acquired, in pieces, by a New York dealer who offered 
it for sale at a half million dollars. Ultimately the mask was returned to 
Mexico, where it is being reconstructed at the Museo Nacional, Mexico

Another serious category in this commerce is the removal of frescoes from

in excavation. At least eleven major American museums have acquired sec-
tions of wall paintings from this site, and a great many more are in the hands 
of dealers and private collectors.
	
Addendum
An important addition to this list has just been published in Art Quarterly 
(XXXII:1, p. 71) as the recent acquisition of an American museum. It is.the up-
per half of stela #11 from the Guatemalan National Monument of Piedras Ne-
gras. This well-known stela has been most recently published in its entirety in 
the Handbook of Middle American Indians (II:l, 1965, p. 479). Described by Mor-
ley (iii, p. 191) as the most beautiful monument at Piedras Negras, this niche 
stela has been more seriously mutilated than any of the others known to have 
been stolen from the site. So much of the inscriptions, and some figures, have 
been cut from the front and sides that the historical and aesthetic significance 
of the monument have been radically altered and diminished.

The History and Continuing Impact of the Native 
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act 
(nagpra)
Emily Field
	
Introduction
Repatriation is defined by the Smithsonian Institution as “the process of re-
turning someone, or in the case of cultural property, something to its nation or 
origin. Cultural property is generally defined as any object that is specifically 
designated by a nation as being of importance.”1 A legal framework drawing on 
this definition was established for the return of certain Native American ob-
jects that are held within the United States under the Native American Graves 
Protection and Repatriation Act (nagpra), passed in 1990. nagpra applies to 
all museums, repositories, and institutions that received federal funding before 
or since 1990 and that have collections of Native American cultural property, 
which is defined within the law as cultural items: human remains, funerary 
objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony. The parameters were 
created following decades of protest by Native Americans wishing to rectify 
the legacy of maltreatment of Indigenous material, and, by extension, socio-
political heritage. nagpra requires the publication of associated Indigenous 
material holdings and the subsequent availability of their return to lineal de-
scendants of the 567 federally-recognized Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian 
organizations within the United States.2
The stakes for repatriation are both political and cultural for the Indigenous 
tribes and individuals concerned. In one case regarding the repatriation of hu-
man remains in Washington state, tribal claimants remarked, “When a body 
goes into the ground, it is meant to stay there until the end of time. When re-
mains are disturbed and remain above the ground, their spirits are at unrest …

To put these spirits at ease, the remains must be returned to the ground as soon 
as possible.”3 Similar feelings are shared by many Native American individuals 
and tribes, and such sentiments extend to the treatment and possession of cul-
tural items. Repatriation might be sought for ceremonially or historically sig-
nificant objects, or for funerary items that relate to a tribe’s theological beliefs. 
Objects can also develop important social roles through exchange and lineal 
descent, giving right of possession to the surviving heirs of that ancestry. In ad-
dition, some Native individuals believe that the handling and management of 
particular objects should be restricted to designated events or to tribal leaders 
trained for the responsibility of their care.4 For all these reasons and more, the 
collection, handling, and storage of Native American cultural objects and hu-
man remains within non-tribal museums is considered problematic for many 
Indigenous persons.
Philosophies vary across Indigenous nations, however, concerning the ap-
propriate management and display of human remains and items of material 
culture, and there is no universally accepted solution. As a result, nagpra 
is simultaneously lauded and disparaged for the terms on which it operates. 
Broadly speaking, while certain Native individuals express appreciation for the 
services that nagpra mandates and provides, others react with ambivalence 
or see the law as a failed attempt at reconciliation between Indigenous peoples 
and the u.s. government. Museum personnel express concern for the conser-
vation of repatriated objects and human remains on the one hand, and, on the 
other, credit the law with opening avenues for increased communication and 
collaboration with tribal representatives.
One of the largest challenges facing nagpra is recognition of the multi-
plicity of Indigenous experiences in the United States. The law identifies pro-
spective claimants under two categories, that of an Indian tribe or a Native 
Hawaiian organization, and while the broad applicability of these cultural 
classifications was meant to be beneficially inclusive for groups and individu-
als seeking repatriation, the result can force museums and Native claimants 
into a legally prescriptive bind. “Cultural affiliation” is determined as a “shared 
group identity which can be reasonably traced historically or prehistorically.”5 
Yet the law fails to contend with the complex processes of interaction and 
migration, both natural and governmentally forced, that have shaped Native

identity and the resultant sharing of Indigenous material culture. The failure to 
legally address intertribal ownership can result in unilateral decision-making, 
and this can obfuscate or even negate the multicultural histories of objects and 
human remains.
The difficulty of designating the place or tribe of return for items subject 
to repatriation increases when the items have no easily discernible cultural 
affiliation. Section 43 cfr 10.11, an addendum to nagpra in 2010, sought to 
address this problem by broadening the scope of geographical and tribal con-
nections to include culturally unidentified museum holdings, but critics claim 
that the wide-ranging terms for cultural association in Section 10.11 only serve 
to increase the problem of conflating the diverse origins of objects and hu-
man remains. This paper illuminates the difficulties of determining ownership 
under nagpra by first examining the history of collecting practices that led 
to the acquisition of objects and human remains by collectors and museums, 
and then by unraveling the legal intricacies of nagpra itself. That examina-
tion will draw on a selection of cultural items defined within the law, namely 
human remains, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. Finally, this 
analysis aims to show the need for case-by-case assessment and adjudication 
under nagpra by noting the wholly unique nature of individual claims for 
return. I am pleased to present this article to Oscar White Muscarella, who has 
been interested in Native American archaeology since his early career.
	
Collecting Indigenous Cultural Items
A review of the chronology of events that led to the establishment of nagpra 
is critical for a full understanding of how sociopolitical circumstances contrib-
uted to the federal mandate. Items of Indigenous material culture were col-
lected voraciously across North America since the arrival of the first European 
settlers on the continent,6 reaching a peak in the mid to late 19th century when 
museums and individuals were acquiring Indigenous goods in the thousands, 
operating under a variety of motivations—anthropological, scientific, cultur-
al, artistic, economic, and political. Anthropologists held the belief that these 
items, and the people who created them, might soon cease to exist. While 
some of the expeditions mounted by anthropologists and their teams can be 
credited with the accumulation of important linguistic and cultural data that 
are still studied today, for the benefit of both Indigenous and academic com-
munities, these teams also regularly employed collection methods that have

since been recognized as problematic. Not only were the methods controver-
sial in themselves; the resulting documentation and storage of cultural items 
collected in this manner would come to cause significant issues in the later 
attribution of ownership under nagpra.
Human remains were also of particular interest to 19th century researchers 
in the burgeoning field of cultural evolutionary studies with its theories of ra-
cial variation.7 Within this field, now considered pseudo-scientific, craniology 
and phrenology were studied in an attempt to ascertain differences in skeletal 
structures between racial groups, and the need for Native human remains for 
this research propelled unscrupulous collection practices. Methods included 
grave robbing from mortuary sites, the collection of the recently deceased from 
battlefields, and the outright murder of Native Americans.8 Estimates place 
the number of Native soldiers taken from Civil War battlefields and graves at 
nearly 4,000 individuals following the u.s. Army Surgeon General’s order for 
their removal and study in 1868.9 Some mortuary sites were freely accessed 
only after the forcible removal of tribes from their geographic homelands,10 
which has since increased the difficulties for nagpra claimants in identifying 
the cultural or tribal origin of human remains and objects, and the subsequent 
appropriate place or tribe for their repatriation.
The account of Arctic explorer Robert Peary demonstrates the extent to 
which anthropologists and museums were involved in the search for, and ac-
quisition of, human remains. In 1897, Peary brought a group of six living Eski-
mos to New York for the purpose of exhibiting them at the American Museum 
of Natural History. Five of the group died while in the city, including the father 
of the sole survivor, who was named Minik. Peary arranged a fake funeral for 
the father to satisfy Minik, and then covertly had the father’s body taken to 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons, where the bones were cleaned and 
afterwards put on display back at the museum.11 The case of Minik and his 
father is but one example of the prevailing attitude among scholars and mu-
seum personnel in this period that the permission of Native family members 
or communities was deemed unnecessary in the treatment of the deceased—
deceased who were transformed from relatives deserving of cultural respect 
into objects for scientific examination. Moreover, surviving family, whether

nearby or afar, had no say in, or often even knowledge of, the ways in which 
their ancestors and religious artifacts were displayed in museum contexts.
The economic incentives garnered through the sale of Native American ar-
tifacts and human remains equally drove many of these collecting practices. 
Grave robbing in order to sell skeletal remains and cultural objects to ­museums, 
scientists, and curio collectors was a lucrative profession, and further induce-
ments came by means of tourist attractions.12 At these destinations, skeletons 
from burial mounds were left open in situ for visitors. In fact, one such site, 
Dickson Mounds in Illinois (Plate 37.1),13 existed until the 1990s, when it was 
closed following protests by Native American activists.14 Commercial exhib-
its like Dickson, where Indigenous human remains were exposed or displayed 
alongside wildlife and geological collections, piqued the curiosity of the pub-
lic, and the funds from admission fees were sometimes used to pay for further 
anthropological and archaeological expeditions. The danger to emerge from 
such an exhibition is that public interest can act as an impetus for more such 
ventures, thereby worsening both the disrespectful treatment of the interred 
and the increasing accumulation of unidentified objects from non-scientific 
expeditions.
Self-proclaimed archaeologist Ralph Glidden was one such prolific figure 
whose exhibitions funded further archaeological endeavors. From 1922 to 1950, 
Glidden had a showroom on Catalina Island, California, called the Catalina 
Museum of Island Indians, where hundreds of Native American remains were 
on view, often in morbidly artistic display settings.15 In a photograph from 
the 1920s, strings of vertebrae are shown hung like chandeliers from the ceil-
ing, and dozens of other bones pack every available surface in the room as 
display pieces and as architectural decoration (Plate 37.2).16 Not only would 
this display be emotionally troublesome for the descendants of the deceased 
whose bones were on view, taken from their original burials; the exhibition 
also makes future identification of the human remains, and the possibility of 
their repatriation, next to impossible due to their disarticulation within Glid-
den’s display.

Federal Mandates of the 20th Century
Multiple federal mandates in the 20th century sought to address the issues of 
looting before the passage of nagpra, with results that frequently furthered 
Western normative anthropological and archaeological practices despite 
their seemingly well-intentioned attempts to accommodate Native American 
dissent. The 1906 Antiquities Act was the first of these directives, which le-
gally decreed that the u.s. President could declare historic sites as national 
monuments—protecting sites from looting, but also putting Indigenous his-
tory under the jurisdiction of federal authority.17 Rather than communicating 
with impacted tribes over the ethical ramifications of various archaeologi-
cal endeavors, the act, in effect, “neutralized the individuality of the Native 
Americans buried there.”18 The result was the continued homogenizing of 
Native identity, relegating human remains and associated objects to things of 
academic inquiry. Furthermore, under the Antiquities Act, those things are 
considered public resources, to “be made for permanent preservation in public 
museums.”19 While the 1906 law was the first of its kind enacted in the United 
States for the protection of Indigenous archaeological artifacts and sites, the 
Indigenous perspective on the appropriate excavation, exhibition, or posses-
sion of those artifacts and sites did not warrant inclusion.
The Reservoir Salvage Act, passed by Congress in 1960,20 is credited as the 
next influential mandate concerning the preservation of Indigenous mate-
rial culture, in spite of never making any direct references to Native Ameri-
can tribes, individuals, or lineages. This law states that prior to the proposed 
construction of a dam, should the constructing agency be notified of archaeo-
logical evidence in the affected site, the Secretary of the Interior is required to 
decide whether “such data has exceptional historical or archaeological signifi-
cance, and should be collected and preserved in the public interests.”21 Here, as 
with the Antiquities Act of 1906, Indigenous communities are not ­designated

among those to determine which artifacts and burials are deemed to be “ex-
ceptional.” Instead, the act refers only to “data,” “relics,” and “specimens” that 
appeal to a loosely-defined “public interest” and that would otherwise be lost 
in construction efforts. The Reservoir Salvage Act also recommends that ar-
chaeological rescue excavations be done “as expeditiously as possible,” and 
the haste with which digs were carried out led, in many instances, to little 
­documentation of the thousands of objects and human remains excavated, a 
situation worsened by a deficiency of proper storage space and management 
practices after their removal. The result of this absence of scientific excavation 
and documentation, coupled with the dislocation of the objects themselves 
from their archaeological context, led to vast collections of culturally unassoci-
ated items that still remain unidentifiable today.22
Six years after the passage of the Reservoir Salvage Act, the National Historic 
Preservation Act of 1966 dramatically extended the coverage of sites and arti-
facts protected by the u.s. federal government by requiring federal agencies to 
identify, assess, and resolve any actions taken by the agency that would have 
adverse effects on historic properties.23 Section 106 of this law puts forward the 
prerequisite that said federal agencies must consult with an associated tribe if 
it is known that the site is religiously or culturally significant to that tribe, in 
order to preempt any aforementioned adverse effects.24 The law was extended 
in 1990 with the regulations 36 cfr 79, titled “Curation of Federally Owned 
and Administered Archaeological Collections,” which directly addresses the 
need for a standard of care for federally held Indigenous artifact collections, as 
well as proposing certain deaccessioning legislation for artifacts held in federal 
repositories and museums. The regulations, similar in many respects to those 
outlined in nagpra, were unfortunately given no powers of execution—dead-
lines were never made for compliance, and no method was offered for appli-
cation of the legislation within museums and repositories.25 While this act 
was instrumental for the implementation of other integral historic property

Activism and Dissent Over Early Repatriation Policy
The 1960s u.s. Civil Rights Movement witnessed increasing vocalization of the 
debate over possession of Indigenous cultural items in the public and political 
arena. Dennis Banks is recognized as founder of one of the first nationwide In-
digenous activist groups in 1968, the American Indian Movement (aim), which 
started as a grassroots advocacy group in Minneapolis before being replicated 
in other urban areas.26 Activism progressed throughout the 1970s and 1980s, 
brought on by mounting frustrations with the lack of forward momentum in 
the legislation of previous decades. The group American Indians Against Des-
ecration (aiad), formed by Jan Hammil in 1978,27 was forthright in its mission 
“to get the remains of the ancestors back into the ground.”28 The force behind 
aiad sought to bring an end to the excavation of burial sites without the con-
sent of culturally affiliated individuals. While the remains of Europeans that 
were unearthed were usually reburied with appropriate religious ceremonies, 
Indigenous remains in the u.s. were still being confiscated in the late 20th cen-
tury as “non-renewable archaeological resources.”29
One instance of this discrepancy occurred in 1971, and the event became 
an impetus for further activist measures that culminated in the passage of 
­nagpra. In 1971, highway construction in Iowa near Council Bluffs unearthed 
an early 19th century cemetery, and the remains were exhumed. The 26 white 
occupants of the grave site were removed and reburied, while the two Native 
American deceased, a mother and infant, along with their funerary objects, 
were taken to the office of the State Archaeologist for study.30 A woman by the 
name of Maria Pearson (Running Moccasin), of the Turtle Clan of the Yankton 
Sioux tribe, heard of the case and met with Iowa Governor Robert Ray and State 
Archaeologist Marshall McKusick to protest the removal of the Native mother

The History and Continuing Impact of nagpra
and child. The objections led to Iowa’s becoming the first state to pass laws 
specifically protecting Native burial sites, called the Iowa Burials Protection 
Act, Ch. 263B.7–9 & 716.5.31 The Burials Protection Act mandates “the investi-
gation, interpretation, and preservation of ancient burial grounds, and when 
necessary, the recovery and reburial of ancient human skeletal remains.”32 
Pearson’s victory against the state of Iowa was a monumental success in cur-
tailing the practices of generations of collectors and scientists who used racist 
justifications for the confiscation and collection of Native American remains 
and funerary objects. The national attention brought to such issues by Pear-
son’s protests—causing eighteen more states to implement laws “encouraging 
or requiring the reburial of remains”—has since been called a catalyst for the 
passage of nagpra.33
The legislation leading up to the enactment of nagpra was not without its 
detractors, particularly in scientific and anthropological communities. Critics 
of the legislation maintained that human remains provide vital clues about 
the health and lifestyles of ancient peoples, and that information obtained 
through analysis could benefit current and future understanding of human de-
velopment and medicine.34 The scientific community feared that, by returning 
holdings of Indigenous cultural items, further data could be lost, especially as 
technologies improve for advanced research on human remains and associ-
ated organic materials. Such critiques were voiced in 2010 with the passage of 
43 cfr 10.11 and the push to repatriate unaffiliated cultural items. In the same 
year, some anthropologists worried that the new regulations would not only 
destroy historical evidence but also halt mutually beneficial dialogue between 
scientists and tribes. This attitude runs the risk of placing Western values of 
education and enlightenment, along with the idea of “world heritage,” above 
the concerns of diverse Indigenous peoples.
Euro-American regard for scientific research and the dissemination of 
knowledge—here gathered from Indigenous material culture—is often at odds 
with the cosmological significance that tribes associate with various objects 
and burial practices. Moira Simpson, in her book Making Representations: Mu-
seums in the Post-Colonial Era, explains that “some knowledge is restricted and 
is only passed on to members of the tribe holding certain positions according

to age, sex, kin or clan. It is anathema in such cultures that restricted knowl-
edge should be shared with non-tribal members.”35 Zuni kokko, or “masked 
dancer” figures, and their accompanying rituals, for instance, are illegal to pho-
tograph among the pueblo communities, and thus the advertisement and sale 
of those figures, as happened in a Paris auction in 2013, is inappropriate and 
disrespectful according to some critical Zuni individuals.36
Likewise, among the Haida, the disturbance of grave sites is widely consid-
ered to impact the spirits of the deceased—interrupting their reincarnation 
process—as well as negatively influencing the welfare of living ancestors, mak-
ing the desecration of burials and the removal of associated objects disruptive 
to Haida religious beliefs. These views motivated the Haida to try, and succeed, 
to make a claim for the repatriation of their ancestral human remains from 
the Field Museum in Chicago, and after three years of deliberation, a collec-
tion of 160 human remains brought to the museum in 1897 were returned to 
Haida Gwaii and reburied with all attendant ceremonies.37 The Zuni kokko and 
Haida ancestors are but two examples among hundreds, yet they serve to il-
lustrate the manifold differences in cultural perception that make Indigenous 
input necessary for the appropriate interpretation and handling of federal 
collections.
The call for cultural sensitivity in the treatment of human remains and cul-
tural objects does not, however, necessarily place affected tribes and critics of 
nagpra in an adversarial position. Before and after the passage of ­nagpra, 
tribes in search of information about their history have worked alongside pro-
fessionals in many fields, both scientific and historical.38 Such interactions 
can be simultaneously culturally sensitive and exhaustively thorough in their 
quest for historical data. An instance of such collaboration occurred in the Ca-
nadian Yukon Territory when a set of frozen human remains and associated 
objects were found on the lands of the Champagne and Aishihik Nations in 
1999 and were sent to researchers by the tribal council for a full assessment. 
From the results, they were able to conclude trade routes, dietary data, genea-
logical lineage, and approximate date of the finds; after the study was com-
plete, the remains were respectfully cremated and dispersed by the tribe.39 At 
the time of the discovery and analysis, Canadian government spokeswoman 
Paige MacFarlane reported that the examination was only possible because

of a tradition of cooperation between province archaeologists and the Cham-
pagne and Aishihik elders, who not only permitted, but sought out, the help of 
the archaeologists.40
In other cases, affected tribes and repositories have come up with creative 
methods for compromising on repatriation issues. Nancy Mithlo, museum 
professional and member of the Fort Sill Chiricahua Warm Springs Apache 
Tribe, considers that differences in cultural interpretation can be philosophi-
cal in nature, and thus, going forward, various Indigenous object collections 
require the implementation of unique styles of management that do not fall 
into the Western museum paradigm.41 This could mean creating a “cultural 
center” instead of a museum, or it could mean recognizing that a particular 
Indigenous philosophy is, indeed, juxtaposed to that of the museum mission 
but nevertheless holds its own validity. Mithlo makes mention of contrasting 
conservation principles in reference to the case of the Zuni Ahayu:da—the so-
called “War Gods” that are known for the numerous domestic and internation-
al repatriation claims made on their behalf. The Ahayu:da are guardian icons 
created, cared for, and retired outdoors by appointed religious leaders; their 
­disintegration by the elements is a fundamental aspect of their cosmological 
significance (Plate 37.3).42 Their eventual deterioration in such outdoor sites 
is part of the repatriation process, an idea at odds with the Western museum 
culture of conservation that prioritizes the preservation of objects for study.43
	
nagpra Unveiled
The recognition that differences exist between Indigenous and Western pri-
orities in the management of cultural items is at the foundation of u.s. repa-
triation ideology. As already noted, protests demanding legal avenues for the 
realization of this concept started decades before nagpra’s passage—from 
the formation of aim to Maria Pearson’s activism, to calls for the return of 
Ahayu:da guardian figures. This culminated in the introduction of nagpra by

was put under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in the Department 
of the Interior (doi).44
The first stipulation was the requirement that federal institutions must 
identify cultural items in their collections that are subject to the conditions 
of nagpra and then prepare inventories and summaries of those items for 
publication.45 If needed, the National nagpra Program can provide technical 
assistance to museums for the making of inventories, which include general 
descriptions of the kinds of objects and human remains held by the reposi-
tory, information on when and how the items were collected, and, if available, 
the geographic and cultural origins of the holdings.46 The lists are updated 
and researchers are alerted as to when a museum has uploaded an inventory, 
when a museum intends to repatriate an object, what the status of an object 
is, or when objects are removed with permission from federal lands. In ad-
dition, the current online nagpra platform houses in-depth resources with 
contact information for both museum officials and tribal representatives to 
facilitate communication and identification. Where items have been cataloged 
with data pertaining to cultural affiliation, and where Native researchers have 
ready access to published lists, summaries can and have served as an efficient 
method for connecting individuals and tribes with culturally affiliated objects.
The overarching term for holdings subject to nagpra is “cultural items,” 
covering a range of collections: human remains, associated and unassociated 
funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony. According 
to the mandate, terms are defined as follows. Funerary objects “shall mean ob-
jects that, as part of the death rite or ceremony of a culture, are reasonably 
believed to have been placed with individual human remains either at the 
time of death or later.” Sacred objects are “specific ceremonial objects which 
are needed by traditional Native American religious leaders.” Objects of cultural 
patrimony are those “having ongoing historical, traditional, or cultural impor-
tance central to the Native American group or culture itself.”47 The broad range

and number of items included under these parameters allow for an increased 
applicability of repatriation claims, because the items are not limited in what 
qualifies for return. Paradoxically, however, the fixed categories are acknowl-
edged by museum personnel to sometimes cause tension during the repatria-
tion process. The strictness of the definitions can interfere with the return of 
items that do not fall precisely within the five classes of cultural items, and 
museums must follow the letter of the law when deaccessioning any item, in-
cluding those claimed for repatriation.
Once cultural items are identified within the federal facility, the next re-
quired step for the agency is to consult with any lineal descendants or tribes 
that express interest in having the object or human remains repatriated. Pri-
ority of repatriation is given to lineal descendants who can prove “unbroken 
descent” from the original burial or cultural items, followed by claims from In-
dian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations.48 The process begins with the 
individual or group preparing written claims declaring cultural affiliation or 
descent, which must include identification of the category in which the cultur-
al item falls, as well as evidence of cultural affiliation and right of possession. 
Asserting right of possession can be problematic, due to historical legacies of 
colonial coercion and lack of documentation in repository catalogs concern-
ing method of acquisition, but evidence is taken in the form of geographic 
origin, biology, archaeological records, historical documents, language associa-
tion, and, most recently, oral tradition. Compiling this evidence can be costly, 
and because of this, Section 10 of nagpra authorizes the doi to provide finan-
cial assistance to tribes and repositories for repatriation efforts; further funds 
are allocated by the National Park Service through the Tribal Preservation 
Program and the Historic Preservation Fund Grants to Indian Tribes, Alaska 
Natives, and Native Hawaiian Organizations.49 Altogether, over $1,900,000 in 
grant money was awarded in 2016 alone to 15 tribes and 16 museums to assist in 
identification, documentation, and repatriation50—culminating in the return 
of 300 ancestors and objects.51

The standing nagpra Review Committee, integral in assisting repatriation 
efforts, was created with the original passage of the law, to “monitor and review 
the implementation of the inventory and identification process and repatria-
tion activities.”52 The committee is composed of three appointed nominees 
from tribal groups, three from museum institutions, and one agreed-upon third 
party, all of whom spend a four-year term on the board. The group ­requests 
information on compliance with the law, makes annual reports to Congress, 
and hears disputes to resolve repatriation issues between competing Indig-
enous claimants or between claimants and museums. Another major task of 
the committee is to prepare, approve, and authorize new excavations of Na-
tive American archaeological sites, including determining whether the agency 
intends to remove or leave in place cultural items that are exposed or found.
Rigorous adherence to the principles of scientific excavation is all the more 
important because illegal excavation and trafficking are ongoing in the u.s. 
today. The exoticism and attraction of Indigenous cultural items has persisted 
from previous centuries, and human remains are still looted as trophies and 
items of curiosity, especially in areas that are unprotected either physically or 
legally by federal mandate. In 2002, the United States Sentencing Commission 
determined a new set of guidelines for the punishment of crimes concerning 
cultural heritage resources, which allows adjudicators to compound various of-
fenses in order to set the severest punishment possible—in the hope that such 
strict reprisal will deter other criminal ventures or illegal buying practices.53
As recently as August 2015, Ohio resident Mark Beatty was convicted of buy-
ing eight full and partial sets of Native human remains and hundreds of objects 
that were illegally excavated by three unnamed men from a private farm in the 
state. Beatty was sentenced to 100 hours of community service in a program 
that “protects or promotes Native Americans,” and he was also made to publish 
a circular warning others not to engage in illegal digging of Indigenous sites. In 
addition, he was given three years of probation, three months of house arrest, 
a $3,500 fine, and forced to pay $1,000 to the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to assist 
with reburial costs.54 Cases like Beatty’s recall the looting and collection prac-
tices of the 19th century; not only was the plunder of the Ohio gravesite illegal

Alternative Museological Practices
The unauthorized excavation and sale of cultural items addressed in nagpra 
is directly tied to the growth of cultural centers and museums managed by In-
digenous individuals and tribes, in that the legislation enables Indigenous in-
stitutions to physically bolster their collections and exhibits. The importance 
of such institutions stems from concerns over the Western interpretation of 
Indigenous heritage and cultural items; the construction of exhibitions by Na-
tive individuals has been called a “decolonizing methodology”55 that allows for 
more nuanced interpretation of materials and the countering of negative ste-
reotypes of Pan-Indianism.56 Grants from the National Park Service and other 
federal and private sources help alleviate the difficulties faced in the establish-
ment of Native museums and cultural centers, difficulties that can result from 
the fact that Native communities must often allocate financial resources to 
needs for public health and education. Such funding is essential because many 
existing Native museums are small, understaffed, and with undertrained and 
underpaid personnel, and grants provide the means for education in conserva-
tion and museum management. The first training program of this type lasted 
for six years in the 1970s; the second, a museum administration program for 
Native students, was started in 2003 by the National Museum of the American 
Indian and has since educated over 600 professionals.57 Training programs, 
along with the continued availability of federal and private grants, are a means 
of logistically and financially supporting the autonomy of tribes in the repre-
sentation of their independent histories and cultures.
For a variety of reasons, Indigenous individuals and groups may decide 
not to file a claim for repatriation, and it is often essential to effect long-term 
care procedures at the holding institution. Federally-funded institutions are 
required under nagpra to provide long-term maintenance for collections of 
prehistoric and historic cultural items,58 and curatorial funds are allocated

annually by Congress for maintaining collections.59 This support for the ex-
tended upkeep of Indigenous cultural items is necessary, in part, because dur-
ing the 19th and early 20th centuries dangerous pesticides and other toxins 
were sometimes applied by institutions to objects for their preservation. These 
substances have resulted in myriad storage and research problems for which 
numerous Native American museums are unequipped or that they are unwill-
ing to handle, due to the hazards they present. Additional issues arise for some 
Indigenous groups that place gender restrictions on certain objects, that hold 
taboos against handling the dead, or that are unable to conduct ceremonies for 
the reburial of their ancestors.60 Finally, a number of tribes are simply uncon-
cerned about the repatriation of particular objects.
When Indigenous individuals or tribes choose to keep cultural items in 
­non-tribal institutions, the involved parties will frequently work together to 
determine culturally sensitive storage policies for the collections. The Makah 
Cultural and Research Center in Neah Bay, Washington, is one facility where 
this cooperation has met with great success, where “staff organized the collec-
tion by a traditional system of property ownership, which grouped objects by 
family and household and associated objects in units. Gender restrictions ap-
plied to some objects, such as whaling gear, so those items have been flagged.”61 
At the Makah Center and other institutions, employees collaborate so that col-
lections are made available for scientific, educational, and religious purposes 
while remaining in conditions that are beneficial for their physical integrity.
Controversy over conservation of returned cultural items remains a particu-
lar roadblock regarding repatriation from foreign holdings. Although nagpra 
technically applies only to federally-funded repositories within the u.s.,62 a 
number of international institutions have agreed to hear and accommodate 
tribal claims. At the National Museum of Scotland, a case was made for the 
repatriation of a sacred Lakota shirt associated with the Ghost Dance religion 
and the massacre in 1890 at Wounded Knee (Plate 37.4).63 The Wounded Knee

The History and Continuing Impact of nagpra
Survivors Association (wksa) argued that “as [the event at Wounded Knee] 
was a massacre of innocents the objects taken from the dead were not war 
booty and could not be kept.”64 After the wksa’s appeal in 1995, the Scot-
tish Museum Council determined that although the museum was not legally 
­obligated, it could repatriate the shirt if it wished, which it did not. Two years 
later, the shirt was exhibited, and the Lakota again expressed their request for 
repatriation. Then, in 1999, the councilors of the newly-formed Glasgow Re-
patriation Committee agreed to the shirt’s return, on the condition that the 
object be properly conserved. The Smithsonian Institution, meanwhile, had 
returned its own Ghost Dance shirts in 1990 after determining that its collec-
tion was without question acquired illegally, and that “the Lakota tradition 
of burying their dead in their garments has been desecrated and … the shirts 
should be treated in the same way as human remains.”65 The substantial differ-
ence between the approaches of the Smithsonian and the National Museum 
of Scotland is that the Smithsonian prioritized Lakota authority over the treat-
ment of the Ghost Dance shirts, forgoing conservation demands in favor of the 
concerns of the Lakota.
Conservation priorities are but one of numerous philosophical challenges 
that have yet to be resolved under nagpra, a law that attempts to contend 
with centuries of problematic collecting practices spanning hundreds of dis-
parate cultural groups. The 2010 addition of the 43 cfr 10.11 regulations man-
aging the repatriation of culturally unaffiliated objects is one of the most 
public of the current controversies, aiming to provide as much physical and 
contextual information as possible for unidentified objects in order to expe-
dite their repatriation to the nearest lineal, tribal, or geographical relation.66 
Proponents claim that Section 10.11 has streamlined the repatriation process, 
and further, that the policy does not by nature exclude any group. Supporters 
maintain that, while debates can arise over the disposition of cultural items, 
consultation with the museum and tribe(s) in question generally leads to a 
mutually agreeable solution. Critics of Section 10.11, meanwhile, assert that the 
addendum causes museums to assign affiliation to cultural items regardless 
of historical geographic settlement or changing group boundaries, arguing 
that “the complexities of human society—with its constant merging, shifting,  
and dividing—increasingly confuse links between archaeological material

and cultural identities to the point where no intrinsic connection can be 
determined.”67 Moreover, by determining affiliation by means of the geograph-
ical origin of an object or human remains, historical complexity, resulting from 
said cultural items descending from mixed groups or multiple cultural path-
ways, is denied. As a result, it is possible that one or more cultural attributions 
are not considered in the final decision of the repatriation process.
Section 43 cfr 10.11 illustrates the evolving nature of nagpra as the partici-
pants continue to grapple with issues of cultural designation across the reposi-
tories of the u.s. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many objects have been 
repatriated, because once an item is returned, it need not be reported to the 
National Park Service. However, it is estimated that more than 1.4 million ob-
jects and a little over 50,000 human remains have been returned. These num-
bers were achieved only after decades of Native resistance against ingrained 
racist cultural paradigms, with protests extending well past the height of the 
Civil Rights era. Even now, persons seeking repatriation must contend with the 
legacy of looting and historical collecting practices. Unclaimed and unidenti-
fied cultural items remain in museum holdings, and while the return of human 
remains and objects from federal repositories may facilitate dialogue between 
museums and the tribes of the u.s., that return does not in itself address the 
unsettling history of the plunder of Native American archaeological sites or 
the improper collection and exhibition of Indigenous artifacts. Many muse-
ums now seek to repair the damage created by the unethical acquisition and 
display of Indigenous cultural items by working in conjunction with Native 
scholars. These institutions work towards that goal by soliciting feedback from 
Indigenous groups that are willing to collaborate with museum personnel, and 
by incorporating that information into exhibition and storage practices. In this 
way, museums can specify the language and information they present in ref-
erence to particular cultures, and avoid such things as overgeneralization or 
inappropriate management practices. The role of nagpra is limited in how it 
can reconcile aspects of this contentious and fraught history, but hopefully the 
mandate will continue to evolve as new generations cooperate for the repatria-
tion and interpretation of Indigenous material culture going forward.

Connoisseurship Conundrums and a Visit to Hans 
Hofmann’s Studio
Carroll Janis
In the 1950s and 1960s Julius Held taught a course in connoisseurship at 
­Columbia University. Both a connoisseur and noted scholar of 15th–17th-
century Dutch and Flemish art, he was often called upon for his views on 
­authenticity. One of his more memorable judgments concerned a group of 
works “newly found” in the late 1930s and early 1940s and reported in the schol-
arly and popular press to comprise a “lost early period” of Vermeer. As Meyer 
Schapiro told his own students, Held had rejected these works well before the 
forger, Han van Meegeren, confessed to making them.1
Professor Held maintained that the most intriguing part of connoisseurship 
is that the decision is actually made in an instant. One looks, and—to the ex-
perienced eye—a determination comes in an intuitive moment. Once, when 
his students were slow to respond when presented with two slides and asked 
to distinguish a genuine Rubens drawing from a pretender, Held declared, “Of 
course this is the real Rubens: see how the figures are opposed so dynamically, 
look at the quality of the line, the shading … the overall inventiveness.”
Oscar White Muscarella is another of these rare scholar/connoisseurs. Few 
have been as assiduous as he in ferreting out the forged and dubious in his field 
of ancient Near Eastern art. Oscar has also long decried the plundering and 
sale of objects from archaeological sites and the consequent loss of valuable 
historical data that an informed excavation would preserve.
Judgments by generations of connoisseurs have been indispensable in 
forming our understanding of the oeuvres of artists and cultures, as documen-
tation is often so sparse and ambiguous. Yet there remain surprising volatil-
ity and less certainty than we care to admit—for example, the long running 
Rembrandt Research Project, which initially demoted many of the master’s 
paintings thought secure, even canonical, only to revise these opinions over 
time. No amount of connoisseurship—and this is to its credit—has managed 
to identify a definite oeuvre for Hubert van Eyck, long thought a founder of oil 
painting and Netherlandish realism.

Further, major artists have always had works associated with them that fall 
in a gray area of attribution. A work may appear to contain enough stylistic ele-
ments to be considered authentic for some viewers, while for others the same 
may clearly lack any of the deeper personal attributes and sublime qualities of 
the master. One panel painting that has long had scholars lined up against each 
other like opposing armies is the Entombment in the National Gallery of Art in 
London. In the mid-twentieth century, Goldscheider listed an illustrious group 
of experts on either side of the debate: for an attribution to ­Michelangelo—
Fiocco, Longhi, Kenneth Clark, Toesca, Bertini; against—Wölfflin, Berenson, 
Popp, Baumgart, de Tolnay, Antal. Goldscheider, who himself was opposed, 
cited the fine nineteenth century critic:
[J.A.] Symonds rejects it indignantly: “It is painful to believe that at any 
period of his life Michelangelo could have produced a composition so 
discordant, so unsatisfactory in some anatomical details, so feelingless 
and ugly.”2
Over the years, the National Gallery has changed its label on the work sev-
eral times: “Michelangelo,” “Follower of Michelangelo,” “Michelangelo and his 
School.” In its 1994 exhibition, “The Young Michelangelo,” the National Gallery 
once again hailed the panel as all original; and, with the concurrence of an 
estimable group of living scholars, it is now so exhibited. In 1996 James Beck 
offered a cogent counterargument.3 I would add two other points. Proponents 
would have to convince us that Michelangelo would ever have composed in 
such an additive manner a group in which the larger flanking figures so vi-
sually constrict the central figure of Christ. (In his early relief Battle of the 
Centaurs as in his late fresco The Last Judgment the main figure is given ample 
space and contrasting gesture to reveal itself—in marvelous manner—while 
surrounded by active others.) And could Michelangelo ever have allowed any-
one supporting the Holy Body to drop a shoulder strap in such a provocative 
manner?
Nor are connoisseurship judgments limited to old masters; they have also 
played a role in the twentieth century. Over the years fake works have surfaced, 
purporting to be, among others, a Matisse, Picasso, Pollock, and even a clas-
sic Mondrian. Naturally, one assumes that when the artist could be consulted, 
there would be no doubt. Yet a few exceptional and perplexing incidents have

769
Connoisseurship Conundrums & a Visit to Hans Hofmann’s Studio
arisen that involve the artist directly. A legal case in Italy comes to mind in 
which the authenticity of an early de Chirico painting was at issue. An elderly 
de Chirico, long known to have spurned his early revolutionary efforts, testified 
that the work was not his. Yet, after hearing all the evidence, the judge declared 
the painting in question was his!
Another incident concerns a collector who purchased a Miró in the 1930s 
from Pierre Matisse, the artist’s dealer in New York. A quarter century later, 
when the collector decided to sell the painting, he returned to Matisse, who 
apparently did not remember the collector, the sale, or even the work. The 
gallery sent a photo for verification to Miró and received it back with “faux” 
written across the image. Upon learning this, the alarmed collector searched 
through his records and finally came up with the original invoice, handwritten 
by Pierre Matisse. It turned out that the collector had come to the Miró show 
and wanted to buy a painting that had already been sold. He would consider 
no other, so the gallery wrote to Miró and asked if he might do a second version 
for a client ready to buy. The artist obliged. Considering the circumstances, it 
is conceivable that years later the second version could be perceived as lacking 
the requisite freshness and conviction of an original Miró.
When I recounted this story to Claes Oldenburg some years ago, to my sur-
prise he responded with his own experience. He had been in Stockholm for 
the opening of his one-man exhibition at a major museum in the 1960s. At that 
time, he visited a museum trustee who had an Oldenburg drawing ­prominently 
displayed in his home. However, and much to the amazement of the collec-
tor, Oldenburg claimed the work not his. After he returned to New York and 
consulted his notebooks, Oldenburg found he did indeed have a record of the 
drawing—to the great relief of its owner. How had the artist not recognized 
his own hand less than a decade past? Miró once claimed that he worked in a 
trance. Perhaps Oldenburg was in a like state when he made the drawing, or 
perhaps there are more unknown sides to an artist’s character and the artistic 
process than we—or even he—can readily recognize.
Then there is the instructive tale once related by Sabartés, Picasso’s lifelong 
friend and personal secretary. Sabartés had taken Picasso to visit a collector 
who had two of the artist’s drawings on his wall. On viewing them, Picasso 
shook his head disapprovingly, indicating they were not genuine. Taken aback, 
Sabartés said, “But Maestro I was with you twenty years ago and watched you 
do them.” To which Picasso responded, “Even Picasso can make fake Picassos.”
Controversy over dating itself may present a connoisseurship issue in both 
the ancient and the modern eras. Muscarella has been involved in a decades-
old debate concerning a proposed date for the destruction of Gordion, the an-
cient Phrygian capital in Asia Minor. For a variety of reasons, he has said that 

Janis
770
event took place close to 700 b.c. Others claim it occurred a century earlier.4 
Answering my query as to the historical implications of the differing dates, 
Muscarella writes:
If Gordion was in fact destroyed ca. 800 bc, it would mean: that the Greek 
alphabet must have existed generations previously than hitherto recog-
nized, because it has been rightly assumed that the Phrygians borrowed/
learned of their alphabet from the Greeks. This issue exists (but has not 
been discussed) because 2 Phrygian texts were recovered from the de-
struction level at Gordion, dated by me ca. 700 bc, to the Gordion Team, 
ca. 800.
Also the Phrygian fibula, which is a major Leitfossil, i.e. a standard ar-
tifact whose date is established and thus when recovered in a context 
furnishes a general date, would now have to be raised 100 years earlier—
which makes no sense in the past record.
The earlier date also would have the Phrygian kingdom begin much ear-
lier than hitherto recognized—although this per se is not a major histori-
cal issue of consequence.5
A twentieth-century dating conundrum that has yet to be resolved ­concerns 
four works by Hans Hofmann (1880–1966): Trickle (1939); Spring (1940);  
The Wind (1942); and Fantasia (1943). These works display the pouring tech-
nique associated with Jackson Pollock (1911–1956). If Hofmann’s dates were 
­accurate, and there is ample reason to doubt them, it would mean that he had 
arrived at a Pollock-like style before Pollock himself. As Pollock is credited with 
activating line and space in a way new to modern art, this would call for some 
reappraisal of the early history of abstract expressionism.
The theory that Hofmann anticipated Pollock derives from the exhibition 
“Hans Hofmann—Early Paintings” at the Kootz Gallery (New York, 1959). Sev-
eral influential art critics accepted the early dates: in 1961 Clement Greenberg, 
who had once been Pollock’s champion but turned against his late art, desig-
nated Hofmann “the first drip painter.”6 In 1963, Sam Hunter agreed “Hofmann 
was the first American to splatter and drip paint on canvas,” and later added, 
“As early as 1940, in the innovative painting, Spring, he [Hofmann] explored

an unprecedented technique of dripping and flinging paint on the canvas, a 
method which Pollock was to canonize.”7 Walter Darby Bannard, in 1977, said 
that Hofmann “poured and spattered before Pollock”;8 and Irving Sandler fol-
lowed in 1990, lauding Hofmann’s “Splashed and dribbled pools of pigment…as 
early as 1944 in Fantasia, completed three years before Jackson Pollock began 
his poured pictures.”9
No one was more insistent on his priority than Hofmann himself. In an ar-
ticle by Erle Loran in 1964, Hofmann was said to recall Pollock’s excitement 
when he first saw The Wind and other works of Hofmann’s early period which, 
Loran said, presaged Pollock. Loran continues:
It was later that Pollock was to concentrate exclusively on that idiom of 
dripping and throwing paint from cans; ultimately to attain world-wide 
fame for it. Hofmann wants and deserves credit for what he has intro-
duced and done.10
Others have not accepted these claims or their implications. Lee Krasner, who 
was an admiring student of Hoffman’s even before she met Pollock, and who 
brought each to the other’s studio, has denied that she or Pollock knew any 
drip paintings by Hofmann.11
I am a witness on this issue, as I was a visitor to Hofmann’s studio in 1943 and 
saw all his paintings there. My father, Sidney Janis, was preparing his book Ab-
stract and Surrealist Art in America. I, then almost twelve years old, went along 
to see many of the artists. The afternoon we arrived at Hofmann’s, a dozen or 
more larger paintings had been set about. My father studied them and asked 
to see others. He felt that Hofmann was moving toward abstraction and said 
he wanted to include him in the Abstract section of the book, as well as in the 
exhibition that was to accompany publication. But all the works in the stu-
dio were based in figuration. Hofmann brought out paintings from rack after 
rack and finally from a long shelf with small panels that Hofmann had passed 
over but my father asked to see. After a showing of all his works and none be-
ing chosen, Hofmann said he would be in touch when he had something new. 
Some months later my father was invited back to see Idolatress i, 1944 (then 
titled Painting), and it was selected even though this work still retains traces of

a personage with a Picasso-via-Gorky profile (Plate 38.5). At one point in our 
two-hour visit, Hofmann had said, “You know, I am not an abstract painter.” 
I can confirm that we saw no “drip” paintings in Hofmann’s studio. We saw 
none of the four paintings listed above, nor did my father see them when he 
returned in 1944.
So how accurate were Hofmann’s datings and his comments to Loran? Two 
works often cited to evidence Hofmann’s priority are Fantasia (Plate 38.2) and 
Spring (Plate 38.4). Both were included in the 1959 Kootz show, and both were 
exhibited recently at New York museums. To illustrate the continuing problem, 
I have charted the dating data on these paintings:
In 2009 The Jewish Museum included Hoffman’s Fantasia in its “Action/Ab-
straction” exhibition,12 dating it to 1943, as appears on the panel’s front, and 
as it was listed in the 1959 Kootz show. When I recently viewed this painting 
I was struck that the prominent, free-flowing signature and date of ’43 in red-
dish paint accords more with the artist’s signature of the fifties and sixties than 
with that of the early forties. Further, Hofmann had shown Fantasia under a 
different date—1945—In the Hofmann retrospective at the Addison Gallery 
of American Art, held in 1948. Fantasia could not have been catalogued 1945 
at the Addison, had it already been signed and dated 1943, as it is now. Indeed,

a photograph of the Addison installation indicates that the work bore neither 
signature nor date on the lower right at the time. Hoffman must have signed 
and dated the canvas later. Another ambiguity is that a third date, ca. 1944, has 
been proposed for the painting.13 It seems the only timing we can be sure of is 
that Fantasia was completed by 1948.
The second “poured” Hofmann with a controversial date is Spring. This 
small panel is dated 1940, titled, and signed in pencil on the reverse. Spring 
was exhibited with this date in both the 1959 Kootz show and in MoMA’s own 
Hofmann retrospective of 1963. But in MoMA’s recent “Abstract Expressionist 
New York,” 2010–11, Spring’s wall label read ca. 1944–45. This change of date was 
made under William Rubin’s curatorship. Thus MoMA and Rubin eventually 
decided to reject the artist’s own inscribed date.14 This rare action by a museum 
raises a number of questions. Is their new date ca. 1944–45 the correct one? In 
my opinion, the style of Spring—the quality and overlay of the lines—suggests 
the work was painted later, in the 1950’s. It relies on Pollock’s classic, interlacing 
canvases of the later 1940’s (Plate 38.3), rather than preceding them. If Spring 
had been made by ca. 1945, it would have been a most advanced abstraction 
for that time. Why was it not included in Hofmann’s Addison retrospective of 
1948? And if the date of ca. 1944–45 is right, why would Hofmann have back-
dated the panel to 1940, as Spring has the complex layering of poured lines 
that Pollock developed only in the later 1940s? Spring appears not to have been 
exhibited before 1959.15 Given Hofmann’s sentiments, as quoted by Loran, it 
is most unlikely that he would not have shown Spring or The Wind in his 1948 
retrospective, or in other shows prior to 1959, if he had already painted them. 
Style and circumstance point to a later 1950s date for the signing and dating 
of Fantasia, as well for the final layering of Spring, both perhaps in prepara-
tion for the 1959 Kootz exhibition. In any case, the dates the artist gave to each 
painting have been compromised, and therefore open to question are other of 
Hofmann’s “pre-Pollock” datings, i.e. The Wind, 1942, and Trickle, 1939.
Pollock’s first works with a significant element of pouring were done in 
1943: Water Birds, Composition with Pouring i, and Composition with Pour-
ing ii.16 ­Pollock then took a hiatus with this process, returning to it in 1946 
in Free Form, and continuing through his classic canvases of 1947–50. Let us

compare two relevant works, Pollock’s Composition with Pouring ii (Plate 38.1) 
and Hofmann’s Fantasia (Plate 38.2), both dated 1943. In the Pollock a running 
black line curls over itself and the field. A dynamic set of lines, poured and 
brushed, works against asymmetric color areas, all forming an organic unity. 
In the Hofmann two styles are superimposed: underneath, hot and cool colors; 
above, a poured filigree of white line—added like icing on a cake. The Pollock 
composition is the more daring and discovered, and to my mind clearly earlier; 
the Hofmann is more preconceived and, I believe, later.
Meyer Schapiro observed in late 1959 when the Hofmann/Pollock issue was 
much discussed, “It doesn’t matter who did it first, it’s what you do with it that 
counts.” While this may be true, it would nevertheless alter our conception of 
Pollock’s radical originality if we found that a central part of his individual 
style had already been attained by another artist in a few atypical paintings. 
Hofmann worked, after all, almost exclusively with the tension of color ­masses, 
not interlacing lines. Nevertheless, it seems that both Max Ernst and Janet 
­Sobel may have experimented with the drip idea prior to Pollock or Hofmann.
Sidney Janis knew both Hofmann and Pollock well and was an early 
­supporter of each. In his 1944 book, Janis noted similarities in their tempera-
ment and technique. He praised Hofmann’s enthusiasm and characterized 
Idolatress  i, rather presciently, as “abstract and expressionist” and added, 
“Merging of abstract and expressionist streams is also apparent in the paint-
ings of other artists, each achieved in its own way.”17
But in the early 1980s in notes for a memoir, Janis comments negatively on 
the Hofmann statement quoted by Loran (above) and asks, if Hofmann had 
abstract paintings in 1943, why didn’t he show them on either of his visits? 
Writing about “distorted history,” Janis concludes:
Date surgery, slight or otherwise, was much in vogue during the fauve and 
cubist periods, especially on the part of lesser lights. In the rapid course 
of various revolutionary art movements that follow close upon the heels 
of one another, the perpetuator in wishful thinking would succumb to 
the temptation to doctor a date to fit himself into history. In a triumph of 
the false he then became a pioneer rather than a follower.18

The Hofmann catalogue raisonné, which was supported by the Hofmann es-

dicated why the historical evidence points the other way. Historical knowledge 
and interpretation depend on accurate dating—as critical for the modern era 
as it is for the ancient.

Blue from Babylon: Notes from the Curatorial 
Trenches
Margaret Cool Root and Helen Dixon
	
Preamble
Inspired by Oscar Muscarella’s career-long eagerness to go where an-
gels fear to tread, this short article offers preliminary remarks on an in-
scribed stamp seal in my care from 1978 to 2015 at the Kelsey Museum of  
Archaeology—one that I assiduously tiptoed around for years.1 Its per-
petual exile in storage has been prompted by the suspicion that it is a 
modern forgery—with my consciousness about these matters and the 
complicity of the art market in the proliferation of fakes raised by Oscar’s 
scholarship. “Blue from Babylon” is an exploration that I could not have 
done but for the willingness of then Michigan doctoral candidate Helen 
Dixon (Near Eastern Studies) to plunge in with me, offering her special-
ist expertise in West Semitic material culture and in Iron Age Aramaic/
Northwest Semitic dialects. The primary goals here are (1) to present an 
intriguingly problematic object and to assess the relative value of its vari-
ous anomalies and physical and biographical features as indices of sus-
pect origin, and (2) to challenge the notion of the ethical legitimacy of 
publishing it at all. But there is also another agenda. Over the years I have 
had occasion to visit New York with graduate students working with me 
at the time. One key element in those trips has been to sit down together 
with Oscar to talk about issues in archaeological practice and curatorial 
dilemmas. This short article is by way of simulating on paper one more 
such cherished conversation.

Blue from Babylon: Modern Biography
	
The Collector-Archaeologist
Professor Leroy Waterman (1875–1972) directed the University of Michigan’s 
excavations at Seleucia-on-the-Tigris (about 90 km north of Babylon) in sea-
sonal campaigns from 1927–1928 through 1931–1932. It is during these periods 
of residency in the heart of Mesopotamia that he is assumed to have collected 
a substantial group of ancient Near Eastern seals. Thirty-two of these seals 
came to the Kelsey Museum in 1959 as a gift transfer in Waterman’s name from 
the Semitics Department of the University (the precursor of our current De-
partment of Near Eastern Studies).
Waterman’s seals form an impressive representative array of types in stone 
and shell ranging from late prehistory down into the period of the Achaeme-
nid Persian empire. Indeed, the collection as a whole provides a core assem-
blage for teaching and display in the museum.2 Notably, several important 
pre-Hellenistic Mesopotamian seals from Waterman’s excavations of Seleucia  
provide critical counterpoints of instructive archaeological context, adding 
scientific value and a sense of the social charisma of a preserved connection to 
the human condition that his unexcavated and unprovenanced seals cannot.3 
So Waterman’s legacy maintains a significant presence at the Kelsey Museum. 
km 26830—the “blue one”—is an outlier among these ranks in terms of a set 
of anomalies that begs for a more complicating discourse than a terse entry 
in a planned scholarly catalogue of seals in the Kelsey (much less a three-line 
museum display label) can convey (Plates 39.1–39.2).
The Waterman seals apparently came to the Kelsey without accompanying 
records, such as an inventory, notations on dealers’ names, or any other infor-
mation of real use in tracing artifact biographies.4 Furthermore, the university 
2	 These are substantially enhanced now with the acquisition by gift of the late prehistoric 
stamp seals from Tepe Giyan, Iran, collected by Ernst Herzfeld. See Root, “Tepe Giyan Lives” 
and Mallampati, “Archaeology and Collecting: Law, Ethics, Politics,”109–125.
3	 See, for example, Root, “Hero and Worshiper at Seleucia.” A small but important selection 
of excavated seals, sealings, and other artifacts of the Early Dynastic and Akkadian periods 
came to the Kelsey in the 1960s from the American excavations of Nippur through Michigan’s 
membership in the American Schools of Oriental Research.
4	 The Kelsey Museum was not formed as an institutionalized museum per se until 1953—even 
though the collections that would become part of it were begun in the late 19th century. So it 
was a very young entity in 1959, without systematic information protocol for logging in dona-
tions. See Talalay and Root, Passionate Curiosities, 1–50, 97–102.

archives have so far yielded up no pertinent letter or other document.5 We do 
not even know for a fact if these thirty-two seals constitute the entirety of Wa-
terman’s collection. The museum accession card for each of the seals, presum-
ably initiated at the time of the 1959 gift transfer, incorporates under the rubric 
“Field or Former Number” a coded set: a “W.” is followed by a Roman numeral 
(ranging from i to iii); a capital letter (ranging from A to D); and an Arabic 
numeral (ranging from 1 to 32). There are multiple oddities in the sequence of 
Waterman numbers matched to accession numbers—enough to make it un-
productive to burden this paper with all of them. Selectively: (1) The first seven 
seals in numerical sequence of accession numbers and previous Waterman 
numbers do not bear a letter designation after the Roman numeral. (2) The 
thirteen seals whose numbers contain the letter “B” also bear a lowercase let-
ter ranging from a to d. (3) Four seals out of the thirty-two received accession 
numbers in an entirely different sequence, accounting for the fact that there 
are gaps in the first accession number sequence (e.g., W.II.7 (km 26810) is fol-
lowed by W.III.A.10 (km 26811).6 (4) The Arabic numeral at the end of each set 
(in the main sequence) coordinates with the numerical sequence of accession 
numbers assigned to the seals in 1959 (beginning with km 26804). But neither 
this sequential ordering nor any particular typological or historical dating fac-
tor bears any relationship to the artifacts’ ancient biographies or material/cul-
tural properties that we have yet been able to glean.
The card for km 26830 bears the code W.III.D.32. Does this end position in 
the Arabic numeral sequence (as the last in the thirty-two seals that came to 
the Kelsey) mean that it was Waterman’s last acquisition? Or may it be merely 
a serendipitous result of a culling from a larger collection that just happened 
to make km 26830 the last in the line? Why did four of the seals receive acces-
sion numbers totally outside the main run? Much of this (and more) remains 
bewildering. It does seem likely, though, that the range of the Roman numeral 
and the capital letter codings (and the gaps/apparent oddities therein) indi-
cates that more seals were originally part of Waterman’s inventory system. It 
is also possible, in addition, that features of the code refer to acquisition data 
such as the identity of a dealer or seller and/or the location of the purchase or 
harvesting of the seal. Here too, clarity from down in our curatorial trench is 
elusive at best.
5	 Focused combing of the Leroy Waterman Papers housed in the Bentley Historical Library has 
yielded no information whatsoever relating to the acquisition of seals or other ­categories of 
objects. Two very astute, talented undergraduate scholar-sleuths in 2005 and 2008 deserve 
special thanks for pursuing this project with Root: Meryl Schwartz and Jessie Rob, respectively.
6	 These four accession numbers run from 91600 to 91603.

783
Blue from Babylon: Notes from the Curatorial Trenches
	
“Provenance”
Most of the accession cards for the Waterman seals designate “Mesopotamia” 
under the Provenance rubric, including the card for km 26830. There are some 
anomalies, however. Two seals have no Provenance designation whatsoever 
(km 91600 and 91602). One omits “Mesopotamia” and stipulates instead “Iraq” 
alone (km 26829). Three omit “Mesopotamia” and supply instead “Persia” (km 
26808), “Iran” (km 26809), or “Persia?” (km 26810). Three of those that sup-
ply “Mesopotamia” follow this by “(Iraq?)” (km 26804, 26805, and 26827). One 
notes “Mesopotamia or Iran” (km 26813). All this strongly suggests that in some 
cases at least, Waterman was using “provenance” designations of the vaguest 
sort—such as are frequently supplied by dealers.
It has in the past been taken for granted that he acquired all his seals (some-
how) while excavating at Seleucia. This assumption has carried with it the 
further assumption that he acquired all of them in the Seleucia site environs 
(which might include Babylon) or perhaps in Baghdad from a dealer. It is also 
quite possible, however, that 26830 was acquired not in central Mesopotamia 
at all, but rather in the Levant near the end of Waterman’s Middle East activi-
ties. What Waterman had found at Seleucia, instead of the Sumerian Eden that 
he was seeking as a Biblical scholar of a certain era, was a site that revolved 
around intersections of Seleucid and Parthian cultures. He never became intel-
lectually gripped by the potential significance of the site. So he began looking 
for a new project more in keeping with his original interests. In the fall of 1930 
(at the outset of the fourth of his five seasons as director of the Seleucia exca-
vations) he secured the concession to excavate ancient Sepphoris in Palestine 
with private funds. He dug there in 1931 for two months. The Great Depression 
brought the project to an end until much later in the 20th century under dif-
ferent auspices.7
Whether Waterman acquired the seal during his time in central Mesopo-
tamia or Palestine, the words of a Seleucia team member, Samuel Yeivin, are 
an important reminder of how ambiguous any record of such circumstances 
may have been: (1) an object that came to be logged into the archaeological 
record and thence treated as an excavated artifact, but which was in fact found 
somewhere in the (remote or close) vicinity of the site and purchased for the 
excavation, and (2) an object found in the same way that went either into the 
excavator’s growing personal collection or onward to a dealer who then sold

it to whomever—possibly even to the archaeologist who (unwittingly or not) 
actually bought something that came from his own site.
It will be noted that the volume contains a comparatively large amount 
of surface finds. These have been secured from our workmen, who picked 
them up—while walking to or from work—on the surface of our mounds 
or other mounds in the vicinity of our site … by offering a small compen-
sation for such chance finds, the expedition merely chose the lesser of 
two evils, and prevented—as far as it was humanly possible—the trick-
ling out of such finds into the hands of dealers.8
We do not know if Waterman specifically acquired some finds procured in 
this manner for his own collection either at Seleucia or at Sepphoris. Perhaps 
those he acquired from big-city dealers are the ones with the anomalous Prov-
enance indicators given on the accession cards, where those that simply state 
“Mesopotamia” signify those that Waterman was sure of because he knew very 
well where they had been found. Certainly, at Seleucia, enough pre-Hellenistic 
material has been retrieved archaeologically and logged in (including seals) 
to make it entirely plausible that additional items came forward as “surface 
finds,” which came to be owned by Waterman rather than claimed as part of 
the log of the excavation per se.9 It is also quite plausible that he would have 
characterized all ancient Near Eastern seals as “Mesopotamian” even if they 
came straight from Sepphoris in the Galilee.
Two seals in the Waterman collection (our km 26830 and also km 26807) 
had tiny hand-written notes in their storage envelopes decades ago: “from Bab-
ylon.” It was on that basis that each was designated that way in the 1984 exhibi-
tion, “The Art of Seals,” at the Kelsey Museum.10 Somehow over the years and 
in the course of multiple upgrades of the museum’s storage facilities and stor-
age packing of all our collections, these two little paper notations have been 
lost—even though we always make every effort to preserve the link between 
any such free-floating documentation and the artifact to which it refers.

Blue from Babylon: Notes from the Curatorial Trenches
Just what value should be attributed to these notations is difficult to assess, 
given the vagueness of the entire collection around the notion of provenance 
or place/circumstances of acquisition. Theoretically, the rarity of these nota-
tions might suggest that they actually meant something significant and spe-
cific about these two seals. But for all we know, many more of the seals were 
once accompanied by tiny notes, which had already been lost prior to 1984.11 
We will return to the issue of provenance later, in the context of our presenta-
tion of the complexities of the seal as an artifact.
	
Blue from Babylon: Features and Questions of Authenticity
The accession card for km 26830 stipulates “modern?” at the Period rubric. The 
physical and iconographical/inscriptional features of km 26830 laid out below 
combine to signal its alliance to a West Semitic production environment. If 
it is a genuine ancient artifact, it was manufactured sometime between the 
mid-7th and the early 6th centuries b.c.e. (Plates 39.1–39.2). In this case, it 
probably originated in a production center in Syria or farther west; but it may 
have been used in central Mesopotamia in antiquity, whence it was eventu-
ally recovered and then ultimately acquired one way or another by Waterman 
while he was working at Seleucia (explaining the “from Babylon” notation).12 
If it is a forgery, it still remains most probable that it was produced in western 
11	
Interestingly, the other seal that in 1984 still had a “from Babylon” notation associated 
with it (km 26807) is a chalcedony ovoid stamp seal bearing a Neo-Babylonian type cult 
scene. Like km 26830, it is one of those listed simply as from “Mesopotamia” on its acces-
sion card. Its Waterman code number is W.II.4. Since the km 26830 code is W.III.D.32, the 
system does not seem to have a clear bearing on the “from Babylon” factor or on cultural 
iconographical/stylistic factors that do connect these two seals. If it did, we would expect 
these two seals to share some code points (see below on the iconography and style of km 
26830).
12	
Stamp seals of apparent West Semitic origin have been excavated at Nimrud: e.g., Park-
er, “Excavations at Nimrud, 1949–53: Seals and Seal Impressions,” 107 and plate XVIII:4 
(ND.3201) and 107, plate XVIII:1 (ND.858—a faience scarab); and Parker, “Seals and 
Seal Impressions 1955–58,” 29 and plate X:2 (ND.5255—a stone scaraboid with an Ara-

reaches—wherever Waterman actually acquired it.13 The remainder of this pa-
per explores our scaraboid with concerns about authenticity at the forefront.
At this juncture it is crucial to note three particular admonitions articulated 
powerfully by Oscar Muscarella. Our efforts in the pages to follow will be tem-
pered by all three. First, he has urged that,
… every unexcavated object, obviously especially those that are strange 
and suspicious, must not be questioned “Why is it a forgery?” but rather 
“Why is it genuine?”14
This challenge is much more than a clever rhetorical flourish; and we take its 
point seriously. That said, we have chosen to present more inductively the vari-
ous aspects of the problems that the Kelsey seal poses with a transparent ap-
preciation of the multiple complexities it offers regarding its authenticity. The 
rationale is partly that the saga of attempting to assess the factors presented 
by this object are instructive on many counts elucidated so compellingly in 
Muscarella’s publications. To consign the seal a priori to the category of forgery 
without first putting it through its paces would be to sideline many interesting 
issues. We will strive nonetheless to pay heed to the spirit of our first Mus-
carella mandate.
Secondly, Muscarella has decried the curatorial tendency to exercise deep 
scholarly analysis of the features of unprovenanced (and therefore, by defi-
nition, suspect) artifacts “as if they were genuine.” Such exercises, he argues, 
establish a record of data on artistic and cultural practice built on specious 
evidence (based on suspect material) that then becomes reified as a standard 
against which other artifacts will be compared and assessed. We thoroughly 
applaud this admonition. To a degree, we operate here accordingly—even 
though this means circumscribing iconographical and stylistic analyses be-
cause of the extraordinary imbalance between excavated and unexcavated 
seals of comparable type. The issues our seal presents are significant enough 
that we hope readers will agree that the effort to eschew full-throttle analysis 
in favor of a review of the problematics is worthwhile.
13	
Muscarella, “Unexcavated Objects,” 164, discusses some mechanisms whereby forgeries 
pass through channels even from workshops at a great distance and into environments 
(such as Baghdad) where the naïve collector might expect to find illicitly retrieved antiq-
uities but not, perhaps, fakes. See also commentaries in Muscarella, “Excavated and Unex-
cavated,” and The Lie Became Great. Banks, “Spurious,” records the free-flowing movement 
of forged Mesopotamian antiquities already at the turn of the last century.

Blue from Babylon: Notes from the Curatorial Trenches
Thirdly, Muscarella urges that scholars work from excavated bodies of ma-
terial outward in the construction of webs of analytical comparanda for any 
artifact.15 Only in this way can we reverse the curatorial tendency described 
above—by going directly to excavated evidence as comparanda for both unex-
cavated and excavated material. The goal is thus systematically to relegate sus-
pect evidence to an inferior (or very carefully delineated) evidentiary category 
if indeed it is used at all. There are terrible problems here with West/Northwest 
Semitic seals, particularly inscribed examples. A huge percentage of these ob-
jects upon which standards of analysis have been based are unprovenanced.16 
This is especially vexing since epigraphical and paleographical investigations 
(largely built upon evidence from such unprovenanced artifacts) have driven 
and predetermined interpretation of other features.17 Even in areas of glyptic 
research where excavated seals are available, there is a tendency in some quar-
ters to persist in old ways, giving unprovenanced objects equal or even greater 
weight than excavated and culturally informative examples.18 With the Kelsey 
seal, as we shall see, an attempt to privilege excavated comparanda—and even 
to avoid using unprovenanced material as comparanda completely—runs us 
up against a remarkable discovery, which raises a host of questions.
	
Shape, Condition, Material
km 26830 is a scaraboid with a flat seal face and an unarticulated back that 
is smooth and slightly domed.19 The seal is unperforated—a feature we will 
return to below. Its dimensions seem about average for scaraboids of the first 
millennium b.c.e. and would have been appropriate for a substantial but not 
outsize gold ringset.20 Its condition is good, with a minor surface abrasion and 
a small chip on the left edge of the seal face, perhaps indicating scars from the 
removal of a finger-ring mount at some point ancient or modern.21

km 26830 measures 2.5 cm × 2.1 cm × 0.5 cm. and weighs 5.22 grams. Although weights of 
stamp seals are seldom noted, weight seems a potentially useful element of comparative 
physical data moving forward.

Scaraboids, with their low, unarticulated backs, would seem well suited to finger-ring set-
tings. Some excavated evidence validates this surmise. See, e.g., Mitchell and Searight, 
Stamp Seals 3, 114 (no. 274), for the impression of a scaraboid with its ring mount clearly

The seal is a dusky dark blue with light blue manifestations.22 The museum 
accession card describes km 26830 as made of “dark blue glass paste.” This 
characterization of the fabric reflects only what was assumed about the seal in 
1959 or before—carrying with it ambiguities of terminology especially preva-
lent until very recently. Terms such as “glass,” “glass paste,” “faience,” “frit,” and 
“Egyptian Blue” applied to ancient seals have been used variously and with 
varying degrees of refinement in academic literature—to the extent that un-
less a particular publication clearly defines the parameters of meaning, the 
terms are of little analytical value.23 Based on a first-level visual and microscop-
ic examination carried out in 2012, without the aid yet of more ­sophisticated 
techniques for determining material and composition, km 26830 appears to be 
made of a blue frit.
We use this term as Tite and Bimson advise in their recent attempt to deal 
systematically with these definitional issues relating to ancient composites. 
For them, “frit” describes a “sintered, polycrystalline high silica material which 
is coloured throughout and has no glaze covering.”24 The Kelsey seal has been 
fired—but at a far lower temperature than would be needed for a “glass.” 
­Indeed, it shows no evidence of vitrification. It does display, however, to the 
naked eye under fiber-optic light, distinctive sparkly, fine-grained crystals con-
gruent with a frit. Four tiny, perfectly cylindrical holes in the surface of the seal 
face appear to be the result of air bubbles—making it likely that we are looking 
at vitreous material rather than stone. Based on investigation of these holes 
with the magnification so far available, the seal appears to be blue all the way 
visible in the impressed image: here on an uninscribed clay bulla from Nineveh. But most 
excavated original mounts have been found separated from their seals already in antiq-
uity. Both scarabs and scaraboids frequently acquired modern mounts of various types in 
the 19th century, so multiple opportunities existed for the scarring of km 26830 along its 
edge.

through (which is the case with a frit object, according to Tite and Bimson’s 
definition) and exhibits a crystalline structure deep into the body.25
Does the informed (if still tentative) designation of km 26830 as a frit arti-
fact help place it in a specific production milieu? Does this designation yield 
notable correlations with other seals in terms of shape, style, iconography, and 
inscription? Because of the terminology issues mentioned above, it is impossi-
ble to construct a definitive body of comparative seals in an attempt to answer 
these questions. Even when we limit comparanda to artifacts from controlled 
excavations, this does not guarantee controlled usage of these otherwise prob-
lematic terms.26 
Nevertheless, a general trend is clear: seals in the Western Asiatic orbit de-
scribed as being made of “frit,” “Egyptian Blue” (which is closely allied to “frit”), 
“faience,” “glass,” and “glass paste” are relatively common for the Levant and 
less so for central Mesopotamia. Those that do appear in central Mesopota-
mian contexts tend to reaffirm the West Semitic connection in seal form and/
or style/iconography.27 When we attempt to refine this discussion in terms 
of definitional distinctions between glass and various types of composite 
25	
Ms. Chemello has retrieved bits of what seems to be wax embedded deep in these air 
holes. This substance appears to be residue from an impression-making process many 
years ago, perhaps long before arrival at the Kelsey.
26	
Thus, information supplied in catalogues of seals from excavated sites that might be ex-
pected to yield the most noteworthy comparanda is only as useful as is the degree of em-
ployment of systematic materials analysis, with precise reference to a stipulated standard 
for terminology. In many cases, ambiguities will remain for the foreseeable future. Adding 
to this problem, there is the potential for scholarly categorizations that dissociate seals of 
composite material found (and perhaps made) in Western Asia from that region simply 
on the basis of presumptions about the technology. Moorey notes that Buchanan decided 
not to include any of the scarabs and scaraboids made of “faience” that presumably ema-
nated from the Levant in his catalogue of the Near Eastern stamp seals in the Ashmolean 
Museum, because he determined that they were “best considered with their counterparts 
in Egypt.” See Buchanan and Moorey, Catalogue, 37.

Jakob-Rost, Die Stempelsiegel, catalogues several such stamp seals from the excavations of 
Ashur and Babylon that are made of composite materials and bear some Levantine/Egyp-
tianizing formal features: e.g., cat. no. 167—a “faience” stamp seal from Ashur; cat. no. 
234—a “glass paste” scaraboid from Ashur; cat. no. 383—a “frit” stamp seal from Babylon, 
Merkes; cat. nos. 384 (scaraboid), 385, 393, and 396—stamp seals of various forms from 
Babylon, all described as made of “blue paste.” From Nimrud, see Parker, “Excavations at 
Nimrud, 1949–1953,” 106 (ND.3301—a “faience” cylinder with a Mesopotamian crescent 
moon symbol and an Egyptian ma’at feather and a cobra, which is considered surely a 
Syrian product); 107 (ND.3598—a “faience” cylinder seal which Parker compares to a “fa-
ience” cylinder seal from Nimrud and two from Ashur; and ND.858—a “faience” scarab).

­materials, we are, however, back to the old problem. Keel stipulates that Type 
iv scaraboids from his corpus of excavated or site-associated stamp seals from 
Palestine/Israel are occasionally (“zuweilen”) made of “glass” as well as other 
material.28 Exactly what the quantitative “zuweilen” and the descriptive “glass” 
really mean for him is not clear—since perforce he had to depend on informa-
tion supplied from myriad, often vague sources for his mammoth ­documentary 
project.
Gubel remarks that “examples of individual groups of Phoenician seals such 
as the `Egyptian blue’ production are invariably uninscribed.”29 This statement 
might be interpreted to suggest that the Kelsey seal is an outlier and thus a 
probable forgery, since km 26830 is an inscribed frit scaraboid. But how fine 
a distinction is Gubel drawing here between inscribed “Phoenician” seals as a 
micro-corpus and inscribed West Semitic seals more broadly? And since he is 
not basing his analysis on excavated material, should we be paying close atten-
tion to this generalizing comment in any case?
In sum, there seems to be nothing about the material properties of our seal 
in conjunction with its formal properties that necessarily speaks “forgery”; but 
there are indications on the basis of its material that the seal (whether forged 
or genuinely ancient) is likely to have been made in the West Semitic sphere. 
Enough excavated material exists, furthermore, to keep open the possibility 
that the Kelsey scaraboid (if authentic) could very plausibly have found its way 
to central Mesopotamia through active ancient use.
	
Style
The seal template for km 26830 may have been fired in a mold, as the tiny 
air holes seem to validate. But the figural design and the inscription indicate 
incised and drilled work. Linear cuts embellish the garments of both figures, 
lending engraved surface texture to a very well-made object. Secure use of a 
drill to create the globe forms (discussed below) reinforces the look of a crisply 
worked carved artifact, which yields excellent impressions.30 Stylistically, our 
seal appears to be a hybrid of the abstract cut-and-drilled fashion of many 
Neo-Babylonian type seals depicting scenes of worship. Here, however, the

abstraction has been modulated toward the more robust, modeled-style seals 
from the same milieu.31
	
Composition and Iconography
In its impressed image (Plate 39.2), the Kelsey seal displays a Babylonian-type 
worshiper with a beard wearing a long dress standing in profile at right, look-
ing left toward a female divinity wearing a tall polos with crowning globe. The 
divinity, facing right, is seated on a throne with a row of seven globes (some-
times called dots) running down its high back. Between and above this figural 
group is an eight-pointed star, rendered by a central globe and eight radiating 
spokes, each terminating in a small globe or dot. Between the lower bodies of 
the figures is an ankh sign. A line runs under this entire scene (visible more 
clearly on the actual seal), demarcating the exergue. The feet of the worshiper 
and the feet of the footstool and throne of the divinity rest directly on this 
ground line, while the ankh sign hovers slightly above it.
The worshiper extends his outer arm up and forward toward the seated di-
vine figure. His other arm extends out at waist level. Both hands are cupped 
open, facing upward. The divine figure extends her further arm up and toward 
the worshiper so that their hands touch. Her outer arm extends forward from 
waist level, not quite meeting the extended lower hand of the worshiper but 
with their two lower arms completing, nonetheless, an essentially triangular 
composition of arms, with its apex pointing to the star.
The scene on the Kelsey scaraboid utilizes a recognized composition in Neo-
Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian glyptic: a standing worshiper before a seated or 
standing anthropomorphic divinity with or without a cult symbol in between 
and an astral symbol in the field above.32 While the basic idea is replicated on 
31	
Most of the seals published by Jakob-Rost in the cut-and-drilled category were purchased; 
but several good examples are excavated: e.g., Jakob-Rost, Stempelsiegel, 78–79 (cat. nos. 
274 and 275—both from Babylon). The perpetuation of the production of this style (as 
well as the more modeled style) into Achaemenid times is well documented now via seals 
impressed on the Persepolis Fortification tablets—where a major corpus of such seals is 
incontrovertibly genuine, even though we cannot speak to the material of their matrices. 
See Root, “Pyramidal Stamp Seals,“ and Garrison and Root, Seals 2.
32	
For stamp seals, see, e.g., Mitchell and Searight, Stamp Seals 3, 37–38, cat. no. 13d (four 
different seals impressed on bullae from Khorsabad). The composition of two figures 
framing a substantial central element is more suited to cylinder seals. For examples on 
cylinder seals retrieved as impressions from Nimrud, see, e.g., Herbordt, Neuassyrische 
Glyptik, plate 2:1–3, 5, 7–9. Numerous additional examples are published from the British 
Museum collections, inter alia, although they tend not to come from excavations: e.g., 
Collon, Cylinder Seals 5, cat. nos. 233, 244, 245, 248–252, and 254.

West Semitic seals, specialist opinion considers that it is unusual, though not 
unattested, in West Semitic production to display an anthropomorphic deity 
as the adorant’s focus. This may well be true, but these discussions are based 
on indiscriminate use of excavated v. unexcavated data, with unexcavated seals 
forming the great preponderance of the evidence.33
The enthroned figure on our seal conforms to representations of Ishtar (the 
goddess of love and war) in Mesopotamian art. The seven dots or globes along 
the throne signify her astral associations. The fact that there are seven shown 
here could be a direct reference to the Pleiades specifically and to the Meso-
potamian Sebittu (seven gods).34 It is perhaps more likely, based on a review 
of numerous excavated examples, that the number seven here is fortuitous, 
meant more generically to evoke the astral sphere. The numbers of such as-
tral globes vary widely on excavated Assyro-Babylonian comparanda of the 
first millennium b.c.e.35 In the iconographical program of the Kelsey seal, the 
eight-pointed star is another signifier of Ishtar. Close parallels for the style of 
the rendition are found among others in seals known through impressions at 
Nimrud and Nineveh, both cylinders and stamps.36
An interesting cylinder seal (pfs 129) impressed on four Persepolis Fortifica-
tion tablets between 506 and 502 b.c.e. presents an elaborate scene evoking 
Neo-Babylonian imagery in archaizing stylistic mode. The core composition 
depicts a standing worshiper before a goddess on a globe-studded throne, a 
Mesopotamian-type standard between them, and an eight-pointed star in the 
field above the group (Figure 39.1). Stylistically it is a hybrid that is not strictly 
in the Babylonian cut-and-drilled tradition in the manner of many stamp seals

Black and Green, Gods, Demons, 169–170, for the eight-pointed star as a symbol of Ishtar. 
The star rendered differently was also a symbol of the god of light and justice, Shamash. 
But in this context, Ishtar is intended. In Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian art, the seven 
globes or dots are most typically arrayed either as two rows of three with the seventh 
as the point of an arrow formation. Variants as a simple line or as a circle/rosette also 
­occur—primarily earlier.

visually elides with another symbol of Ishtar: the eight-petalled rosette.

with Babylonian worship imagery used in this archive. This demonstrates one 
of the ways in which the tradition of the core motif maintained its fluency and 
achieved fresh application in various environments across the vibrant trans-
cultural spectrum of the first millennium b.c.e.37
On km 26830, the ankh that is substituted for a Mesopotamian cult symbol 
or apparatus is redolent of meaning as an insignium of life in its original Egyp-
tian context. As an icon in Western Semitic glyptic it is well attested on scarabs 
and scaraboids—but typically in different compositional formats than the one 
we see here. Although comparanda exist for this prominent central placement, 
they are rather rare and not from excavated examples.38
	
The Inscription
An alphabetic inscription in nine letters is distributed on our seal so that eight 
letters fill the exergue, with the last letter (the aleph) placed above the ground 
line, directly behind the legs of the worshiping figure (Figure 39.2). This place-
ment of the aleph positions it with the cluster of symbols punctuating the 
representational composition. The entire inscription is rendered so that it is 
legible on the seal itself, but is displayed in reverse in impressed image. Al-
though the inscription is clearly carved, several of the letters are ambiguous 
or problematic, as is often the case in Iron ii–iii period lapidary scripts. Upon 
initial examination, the inscription on KM26830 seems to read: l[y/h?]wrw.
sgn)—tentatively understood as “belonging to Yuru (or Huru), the officer.”
The short vertical line near the center of the inscription is a word divider 
separating the previously unattested personal name (Yuru/Huru) from his title 
(sgn, probably vocalized sigan or səgan). This word divider is rare on seals. 
While the initial lamed preposition (starting from the right in Figure 39.2) 
is clear, the first letter of the name may be read as a yod (with its expected 
horizontal tail perhaps cut off by the lower edge of the seal) or as a he.39 The 
­second and fourth letters of the name are the same; here they are read as early

(Avigad, “Votive Seals,” 249–250), which have been dated to the 7th–6th centuries b.c.e.

(or archaizing) forms of the waw.40 The third letter of the name seems a clear 
resh with a closed head and long, straight vertical stroke.
After the word divider, the samek is the tallest letter of the inscription. In 
its earlier classical form, the samek is found in inscriptions from the Iron ii 
period.41 On the Kelsey seal the short vertical stroke of the letter places it in the 
8th or early 7th century b.c.e. according to standard paleographic opinion.42 
The two following letters appear similar in shape, breadth, and stance to an 
early Phoenician form of the gimel. The well-known seal inscription formula 
l + pn + office / title indicates that we may expect a professional title or hon-
orific of some sort. A good candidate for this on km 26830 is sgn. This is a title 
with a long and varied history of Semitic usage, including references in biblical 
texts,43 Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian documents,44 several Aramaic ritu-
al texts from Persepolis,45 Aramaic notations from the Bīt-Murašû cuneiform 
archive,46 papyri from the necropoleis of North Saqqara in Egypt,47 and in the

Including a number of biblical texts, where it can refer to a foreign prefect (Isaiah 41:25), 
a prefect of Assyria or Babylonia (Ezekiel 23:6, 12, 23; Jeremiah 51:23, 57; Daniel 3:2, 3, 27; 
6:7), to the King of the Medes (Jeremiah 51:28), to petty rulers or officials in Judah (Nehe-
miah 2:16; 4:8, 13; 5:7, 17; 7:5; 12:40, 13:11; Ezra 9:2), or to Daniel (Daniel 2:48).

The Neo-Babylonian term sagānu, “governor,” comes from this Aramaic term, and the 
Akkadian title šaknu(m) (from the verb šakānu “to put/set/appoint”), used in the Neo-
Assyrian empire as one of a handful of interchangeable terms to refer to the governor of 
a province, is also related. In the Babylonian, Middle Assyrian, and Neo-Assyrian dialects, 
šaknu(m) carried the sense of “governor,” with šaknu māti referring to a “provincial gov-
ernor.” Interestingly, the term šaknu was also used as an adjective with a wide semantic 
range; the term could be used to describe someone who was “equipped (with)” a seal, for 
instance.

final letter of the inscription (placed above the exergue) is consistent with 
the late-8th through mid-7th century b.c.e. form of the aleph.49 It represents  
the emphatic ending -a), a dialectical feature that marks the inscription 
­definitively as Aramaic.
Based on the inscription alone, any narrowly delineated date we suggest 
for our seal must be offered only hesitantly. In Aramaic, the lapidary scripts 
tend to preserve older forms of the letters relative to inscriptions in other me-
dia.50 On seals in particular, the constraints of iconography, space, and materi-
als often interfere with legibility or letter form. That said, the letter forms of 
this inscription are consistent with Aramaic lapidary script of approximately 
750–600 b.c.e.
The inscription, as already noted, is rendered so that it is legible on the seal 
itself, but is displayed in reverse in impressed image. The majority of North-
west Semitic seals are carved “backwards” so that the seal impression will 
produce the legible text. There are, nevertheless, numerous examples that 
correspond to the orientation of the text on our seal.51 Until it is possible to 
investigate the issue with reference to a substantial compilation of inscribed 
papryus comes from the Animal Necropolis site at North Saqqara, where a large number 
of Aramaic texts were excavated between 1966 and 1975. The corpus includes 228 Aramaic 
papyri texts and four Aramaic ostraca (in addition to 21 other, ­Phoenician ostraca).

These mid- to late-4th-century documents (fragments of legal and economic papyri) were 
preserved in a set of caves in the Wadi Daliyeh, located 12 km north of Jericho. The texts 
are “mostly contracts of slave sales, together with a few other legal documents … [which] 
represent the transactions of a Samaritan elite,” (Cross, “Personal Names,” 86). Samaria 
Papyrus 8 “records the sale of slaves concluded in the presence of a certain  פתחand an-
other person of lower rank [one)sytwm], referred to as ( ”סגנאEph‘al, “Changes,” 117; cf.

Blue from Babylon: Notes from the Curatorial Trenches
Northwest Semitic seals made up solely of excavated examples, we must de-
fer further quantitative assessment. It is nevertheless worth noting that exca-
vated seals inscribed “backwards” like km 26830 are definitely attested in the 
wider ancient Near Eastern arena. Furthermore, there are various reasons why 
this may have occurred in ancient production—ranging from the error of an  
illiterate seal carver and/or the similar ignorance of the purchaser to meaning- 
laden intentionalities such as the desire to showcase the prestige of the in-
scribed seal as artifactual matrix and/or to focus upon amuletic properties 
of the matrix as the primary object as opposed to impressed images of it in 
 workaday contexts.
The accession card for km 26830 is unusual for its inclusion of “modern?” 
at the Period rubric, and for a note in the Remarks section: “Genuineness de-
pends on readability of inscription.” On the basis of the analysis above, there 
is nothing inherent to this inscription that either flags the seal as a modern 
forgery or proves its authenticity. We have seen, however, that most of the pub-
lished inscription comparanda derive from the vast body of unexcavated West 
Semitic seals. This leads us to an artifact we have withheld so far—one that of-
fers a superb comparandum for many (but not all) features of the inscription, 
the composition, the style, and the iconography of km 276830. This is an un-
excavated scarab formerly in the collection of Sir William Hamilton, acquired 
by the British Museum in the 18th century (Plates 39.3–39.4). Studied in the 
spirit of Oscar Muscarella’s mandates—rather than merely accepted as a gold 
standard by which other unexcavated objects can be compared uncritically for 
authenticity—this scarab poses multiple challenges as we attempt to assess 
the probable status of the Kelsey scaraboid.

The scarab became part of the British Museum collections in 1772—well be-
fore the boom in the forgery of ancient Mesopotamian seals had begun to cre-

early years of the exploration of Nineveh it remained more lucrative “to steal from the 
excavations than to imitate.”

illustrated publication going back to the 18th century and reaching forward 
to the major late-20th-century interpretive studies of inscribed West Semitic 
stamp seals.53 The imagery and inscription on this scarab offer startlingly close 
parallels for the Kelsey seal, as is readily seen from Plates 39.1–39.4 here—­
despite the obvious and critical fact that the two seals display representation 
and inscription in mirror image of each other. Comparison of the two inscrip-
tions is perhaps the item of most interest to specialists in West Semitic glyptic 
and epigraphy. For our broader readership here, it must still come first, since 
the bm seal clarifies elements of the Kelsey inscription and also validates the 
primacy of the bm seal in any chain of production relationship (be it ancient 
or modern) connecting the two artifacts. Our aim here is not to offer a full 
review of the British Museum artifact—but only to focus upon insights it pro-
vides relative to the Kelsey seal and its status.
	
bm 48508—The Inscription
The letters on bm 48508 are placed exactly in the same positions on the seal 
face (though reversed) as those on km 26830—with the distinctive position-
ing of the aleph up above the exergue behind the worshiper. But important 
paleographic cues in the bm inscription resolve what were posed earlier as 
questions raised by the km seal: the unattested personal name and the prob-
lematic letter forms. The fourth letter from the left in the inscription on the bm 
seal face presents a larger, slightly open head and a shorter vertical stroke. This 
enables the personal name on the scarab to be read clearly as hwdw, or Hudu. 
Hudu is a well-attested Hebrew54 and Aramaic55 hypocoristic name formed 
53	
A collections database search at http://www.britishmuseum.org/ for accession number 
48508 yields information on the early publication history of the object. It was illustrated 
in the 1797 catalogue of the Cabinet de Mon. Paul de Praun, where is it is described as 
having formerly been in the collections of Baron von Stosch and the Duca di Noia. More 
recently, it has enjoyed ongoing citation as an unchallenged standard: e.g., Bordreuil, 
“Répertoire iconographique,” 86, and Ornan, “Mesopotamian Influence,” 60. Its very early 
date of appearance has precluded any discussion of possible issues of authenticity. Ad-
mittedly, while classical gems were being imitated already during the early modern pe-
riod, this is not known to have been a practice for ancient Near Eastern material before 
the excitement generated by excavations of the 19th century began to create a significant 
market demand. Further research on this is well beyond our scope here.

from the causative stem of the verb ydy, a verbal root with a semantic range 
of blessing and thanksgiving.56 The seventh and eighth letters from the left of-
fer additional instructive differences. The seventh letter features a more acute 
angle at its apex, and a narrower breadth, making it a clear pe. The eighth let-
ter has a horizontal stroke entirely missing from the km seal, which closes its 
head and allows the reading spr’, “the scribe.” The reading offered on the basis 
of the Kelsey’s seal inscription alone, namely “belonging to Yuru (or Huru) the 
səgan,” must now be reconsidered in light of bm 48508. It is logical to expect 
that the bm scarab, featuring the more subtle textual features and offering a 
well-attested name, should be postulated as the primary artifact whence the 
Kelsey seal derived under some circumstance ancient or modern. If so, we may 
postulate that the Kelsey seal inscription was some form of slightly flawed imi-
tation based on the bm scarab prototype: an imitation intended to signal (if 
not to replicate quite accurately) the text “belonging to Hudu, the scribe.”
	
bm 48508—Shape, Condition, Material
The British Museum seal differs from the Kelsey scaraboid in three impor-
tant physical features that we are able to comment upon at present. (1) It is 
a ­scarab with an articulated high beetle-back, rather than a scaraboid. (We 
cannot ­assess its condition, nor do we know if it is perforated.)57 (2) It is the 
second-largest recorded West Semitic stamp seal of any form, with a seal face 
approximately twice the size of km 26830.58 And (3) it is made of green jasper. 
This very hard stone carried great prestige in the ancient Near East. A jasper 
mountain (Mount Limur) is referred to in Mesopotamian texts, but its loca-
tion has not been identified. The source for the stone derived from this Mount 
Limur “is likely to be west of Assyria in the Syro-Anatolian area.”59

Multiples and “Copies”—The Ancient Angle
Muscarella has, with justification, warned that the existence of multiples of 
unexcavated objects is one clear sign of a probable forgery.60 This admonition 
was not intended to suggest that multiples and sets in antiquity were non-
existent. Yet it remains important to weigh the value of this idea in various 
contexts and to discuss it with reference to useful examples of ancient practice 
that are discernible through excavated data. Different types of material raise 
different issues.61 For seals specifically, several points emerge.
Closely similar (though smaller) ancient “copies” of large prestigious scar-
abs in hard stones including green jasper are noted in the literature as prod-
ucts occasionally mold-produced as a series in cheaper materials—“glass” and 
composites.62 Conceivably the Kelsey seal is an ancient-made artifact of this 
sort, based upon the high-end British Museum seal but not intended to pass 
for it in an illicit sense. The fact that it is inscribed with a formula that gives 
the name and title of a personage could mean that it was produced as part of 
a series dependent upon the original deluxe Masterwork—a series intended to 
supply minions of Hudu the Scribe with seals to be used in various locales on 
his behalf. In this scenario, clear connection with the Masterwork combined 
with clear formal distinctions from it would conceivably have been important 
and necessary.
The most relevant comparison here is with the Neo-Assyrian royal seals. 
This series is not the only one documented through impressed images of of-
ficial seals from excavated court contexts of the Assyrian empire, but it is the 
best-known.63 It comprises a sequence of stamp seals documented through 
multiple impressions on excavated clay artifacts across several generations. 
Only a subset actually incorporates the name of the reigning king; but all the

unexcavated inscribed precious metal vessels of the Achaemenid court, playing devil’s

vessels in multiples.
62	
Boardman, Archaic Greek Gems, 21. Buchanan and Moorey (Catalogue, 39) cite a stone 
seal from Zincirli (Andrae, Kleinfunde von Sendschirli, 160, plate 38e) comparing it to a “re-
markably similar scaraboid in blue glass” uncovered by ploughing at Hassanbeili (Andrae, 
Kleinfunde von Sendschirli, 160, plate 38k; Jakob-Rost Stempelsiegel, 58–59, cat. no. 173). 
These seals are indeed quite similar; but the published photographs and related informa-
tion supplied are not adequate for precise comparative assessment.
63	
Of these, another example is the Sennacherib series of the king under a sunshade pre-
ceded by a rearing horse, known in close variations from 25 Nineveh bullae: Mitchell and 
Searight, Stamp Seals 3, 103–104.

801
Blue from Babylon: Notes from the Curatorial Trenches
seals deploy a consistent iconography of the ruler in heroic combat with a rear-
ing lion. In none of the recorded examples is the motif displayed in reverse (as 
is so distinctive a differentiation between the British Museum scarab and the 
Kelsey scaraboid). The presence or absence of a seal inscription ringing the 
core image and (where present) the change in the royal name of the inscrip-
tion over time are factors of differentiation. Otherwise, the main variable relat-
ing to iconography is the presence or absence and/or the form of an encircling 
device.
There are, however, additional variables that relate to the physical features 
of the seals as matrix artifacts irrespective of iconographical content: (1) depth 
of engraving, (2) seal face surface (flat or convex), and (3) size of the seal face.64 
The size variability within seals of Sennacherib ranges, for instance, from a 
diameter given as 1¼” at the large end to a diameter given as 5/8” at the small 
end. Differentials in seal face taxonomy mean differences in seal matrix form. 
In other words, the multiples are not necessarily replicating the exact seal 
shape of the Masterwork matrix (even though the seal faces of all of them are 
round in contour). Thus, these legitimate knock-off seals could look different 
in many ways in matrix form. From the excavated seal impressions we cannot 
know the material differentiations. But comments on variables of seal carving 
depth suggest that some were better crafted than others.65 A series of multi-
ples of first millennium b.c.e. seals attesting royal property is also known from 
Tell ed-Duweir, Palestine, moving us into the West Semitic orbit of our topic.66
There are other examples of excavated ancient multiples that are instruc-
tive in lesser degrees about the Kelsey seal specifically. They are perhaps more 
pertinent as general qualifications of Muscarella’s warning about multiples as 
signals of lurking forgeries in the realm of the unexcavated. Some interesting 
cases of multiple seals of intentionally closely similar appearance can now be 
documented on the Persepolis Fortification tablets of the Persian empire. In 
terms of an inscribed seal-in-multiples used in an official capacity, pfs 66*a, 
pfs 66*b, and pfs 66*c are noteworthy. These comprise a set of three nearly 
identical inscribed seals deployed consistently and solely in the ratification 
of flour disbursements for the royal table in Persepolis. Evidence currently

­available indicates that they were used sequentially rather than simultane-
ously. But the three versions appear on tablets in the Garrison and Root re-
search corpus in a chronological sequence that arcs across only five years. It is 
entirely possible that even a slightly larger sample of occurrences of one of the 
seals would show that their usages overlapped chronologically. Although this 
must for now remain speculative, it seems plausible that the three seals were 
in simultaneous operation, on the basis of the precedents of earlier imperial 
practice at the Assyrian court.67
Another example, this one relating to an elite member of the administra-
tive/social elite of Persian society, involves a pair of personal seals belonging to 
Ašbazana (the Aspathines of Herodotus). In this particular instance it seems 
that we are looking at sequential seals commissioned by the same personage 
after one was lost or severely damaged, rather than multiples meant to be used 
simultaneously for pragmatic administrative reasons.68 Finally, note the exam-
ple of two seals of a man named Matukka, who used two seals simultaneously 
in Persepolis as glimpsed through the Fortification tablets. Matukka deployed 
two stamp seals, pfs 139s and pfs 1428s, in the same month of 499 b.c.e. in the 
same administrative endeavors (Figures 39.3–39.4).69 Here the style and ico-
nography are very closely similar. But the imagery on the one seal is reversed 
on the other. Thus, as legible images they look in a certain way “the same” but 
they are clearly not meant to be mistaken for one another.
We have shown above that there are excavated ancient precedents for vari-
ous manifestations of seal multiples that lend plausibility to the proposition 
that km 26830 is an ancient knock-off of bm 48508 meant to serve some legiti-
mate purpose in the social system in which Hudu the Scribe operated. Now we 
shift to an alternative proposition: Is the Kelsey seal a modern forgery of an an-
cient seal—specifically of the British Museum scarab? For the sake of discus-
sion we will presume that bm 48508 is genuinely ancient. Its long history and 
its well-informed inscription make this highly likely, although its extraordinary 
size take it toward Unikum status—another warning sign of potential forgery 
that Muscarella alerts us to.

Multiples and “Copies”—Modern Modus Operandi
In 1957 Edith Porada reported that modern forgers had produced multiple cop-
ies of the cylinder seal of Matruna, daughter of King Aplahanda of Carchem-
ish.70 The Masterwork itself had not been excavated; it had apparently been 
“found at Ras Shamra” in 1928, before Schaeffer began his excavations of the 
site. It has, however, been presumed genuine. The secondary series of forger-
ies must have been produced soon after the appearance of the one from the 
Ras Shamra environs. This story is the antithesis to the evidence we have as-
sembled above that attests excavated examples of authentic seal multiples—
including multiples of inscribed seals owned by specific notable personages 
and/or offices. Porada’s brief note includes no illustrations or descriptions that 
enable us to comment more precisely on the nature of the copies in relation 
to the original cylinder seal. But it is a well-known practice for modern forg-
ers of seals to work off an impression of the original seal—thus producing a  
reverse-image imitation. The two seals of Matukka (Figures 39.3–39.4) show 
that reverse-image copying could and did occur with ancient seals at the be-
hest of the patron. But this does not dispute the modern forger’s practice.71
It is easy to see how the Kelsey scaraboid could have been produced as one 
of a modern series of fakes after the British Museum Masterwork—whether 
that Masterwork is genuinely ancient or an elaborate fabrication of early mod-
ern times. Wax impressions were routinely made of ancient gemstones begin-
ning in the Renaissance and were widely circulated. The circulation of study 
collections of cast impressions of ancient Near Eastern cylinder and stamp 
seals held in the British Museum became popular in the 19th and early 20th 
centuries. The reverse presentation of the Kelsey seal’s imagery and inscrip-
tion sing out as indices of forgery here. Similarly, the reduced size of the Kelsey 
seal and its simple mold-made scaraboid shape add plausibility to its status 
as a forgery even though they are not proof of it, and even though there are 
ancient precedents for such phenomena for secondary genuine copies. A final 
indicator is the lack of perforation. Perforations posed difficulties for many an 
ancient seal carver, and they have continued to plague modern fabricators.72 It 
may be that with scaraboids forgers have frequently opted to avoid the perfo-
ration entirely since its lack could be explained as obviated by a now-missing 
ancient ring mount. Because so many published scaraboids comparable to 
km 26850 are unexcavated and some publications do not note information on

­perforation, it is difficult to be definitive on this point. But two excavated West 
Semitic scaraboids of analogous size that we have noted earlier are perforated, 
whereas two others that are unexcavated are not perforated.73
The Kelsey scaraboid presents a high quality of figural carving—arguably 
more robust and compositionally dynamic than that of the British Museum 
scarab, even as both are faithful to certainly genuine stylistic prototypes in 
their diverging nuances. Note, for instance, that the converging hands of the 
two figures on the scaraboid, creating a triangular presentation pointing to-
ward the star, is lacking on the larger scarab, where the two figures are farther 
apart and less substantial in carving style. Although there are idiosyncracies 
in the paleography of the inscription on the scaraboid, these are not in and of 
themselves indices of a forgery. If, on the one hand, it is a modern forgery, km 
26830 is an extremely competent one. If, on the other hand, it is an ancient 
multiple of bm 48508 made for use by Hudu or his surrogates for business pur-
poses, these idiosyncracies are well within the margin of acceptability.74
	
Should We or Shouldn’t We?
Since km 26830 is not an excavated artifact, and we cannot even prove its au-
thenticity beyond any reasonable doubt, we have not made our decision to 
study and publish it lightly. To be sure, it was legally gifted to the museum elev-
en years before the 1970 unesco convention. Thus it is “clean” in that limited 
sense.75 Nevertheless it would be reasonable to take the position that this arti-
fact should not be offered the distinction of any academic attention.
We have considered two valid but potentially conflicting ethical concerns 
here. On the one hand, “legitimizing” unprovenanced artifacts in the public 
sphere is “a process that perpetuates the illegal sale of antiquities and the

­continued plunder of archaeological sites.”76 On the other hand, museums 
(even university museums) have shifted their priorities over the course of the 
last thirty years “from being about something to being for somebody.”77 They 
have been expected to justify their existence and insure their financial survival 
through efforts to connect the public with their collections. The problems as-
sociated with unexcavated objects put museums around the world in a kind of 
double bind. They have the responsibility to care for their collections and to 
make discourse about them accessible to their constituent publics. Yet insti-
tutional awareness of the insidious role that display and publication of such 
material can play in establishing market value for auction items, and so on, 
presents a quandary.
Choosing to study and publish this particular seal will probably not ­directly 
encourage forgeries, price inflation, or archaeological looting. Conversely, 
choosing not to publish the seal would not doom the Kelsey Museum to a fu-
ture of oblivion. It holds much excavated material that continues to be the 
prominent focus of research and exhibition energy. If the study of km 26830 
meant the expenditure of resources on it at the expense of excavated bodies 
of artifacts in our care, this would be a matter for institutional concern. But so 
far, our analyses have not done that, and, in fact, the discussions generated in-
house around this object have been enlightening and engaging in relation to 
excavated bodies of material under curatorial purview. Moreover, our external 
constituencies are keenly interested in issues of the potentials and limitations 
of scientific analyses in the detection of forgeries, as well as in transparency on 
matters such as collections histories and the attendant historiographic revela-
tions that frequently emerge.
Here, we follow Rollston and Nakarai’s recent suggestions for handling un-
provenanced Near Eastern objects.78 They mandate principles of Separation,

“Outing” the Old Teaching Collections
Karen D. Vitelli
The e-mail came to my home in Maine, from my last remaining PhD student, 
Žarko Tankosić, in Bloomington, Indiana. “What happened to the old teaching 
collection of Greek prehistoric sherds you used to have? I would like to use it 
to train an undergraduate who is going into the field with me next summer.” 
What had happened to the sherds? I had left them in the substantial antique 
map cabinet—whose shallow drawers made for perfect storage and display—
that they’d lived in since well before my 1978 arrival at Indiana University. I’d 
handed them over to, I thought, responsible hands, so they could continue 
to be used, as they had been for decades, for all kinds of teaching projects, 
such as that envisioned by Žarko. I’d been told at some point that (most of) 
the collection had been legally exported, materials from a test trench on the 
Paralia in front of the Franchthi Cave, from very mixed surface fill that had no 
­explanatory value for the site. But some of the pieces had certainly come from 
elsewhere in Greece, including some I contributed, and, now that I think of it, 
I never saw any paperwork suggesting legal export—the story may well have 
been concocted to keep me quiet, since I was already writing about the antiq-
uities market for the Journal of Field Archaeology when I arrived in Indiana. 
At any rate, whenever I used the collection in a class, which I did frequently, 
I always began by explaining the laws that prevent the export of antiquities 
today, why those laws exist, how times and ethical norms had changed, and 
so on; that is, I used the collection not only to teach various aspects of pottery 
analysis, but also as an introduction to archaeological ethics.
That teaching collection grew during my tenure, by the addition of a few 
samples of Roman marble and a couple of small pieces of Roman mosaic, each 
with only a few tesserae. These were passed on to me when the Classics Depart-
ment needed to create a new office out of space that had been used to keep 
departmental resources of various kinds. I’d also been the recipient of several 
cigar boxes full of prehistoric sherds from the American Southwest, handed 
over by a retiring colleague who was relieved to find someone interested in 
ceramics to be guardian of his old collection. All of these had also gone missing 
with the map cabinet.1

Žarko and I emailed back and forth, as he ran around the campus checking 
dark corners. He discovered that the map cabinet had disappeared, along with 
its contents. The person I’d left in charge had no memory of a study collection. 
My first response was anger, taking the loss as a very personal affront. While 
I was stewing over this, another e-mail arrived, inviting me to contribute to 
this volume for Oscar. Click: an “aha moment”: the former iu archaeology pro-
gram’s collection was certainly not the only one of its kind. I was not the only 
retiree who had once looked after such a collection, and probably not the only 
one to learn it had gone missing soon after I left. Surely there was a story here 
that would be relevant to many of us, that addressed an aspect of collecting 
that I’d not seen mentioned anywhere before, and, if I could come up with a 
potential solution for the care and preservation of these finds, would be a fit-
ting tribute to Oscar’s many years of concern for appropriate treatment and 
use (if not the formation) of archaeological collections.
So, I wrote to a wide assortment of colleagues of various nationalities, with 
fieldwork background in all corners of the world, asking if they had any expe-
riences they’d be willing to share about the creation of these basically illicit 
teaching collections. The good news for those who have worked so hard in re-
cent decades to change archaeological attitudes toward collecting antiquities 
is that the generation younger than I basically responded, “This has not been 
part of my experience.”
Those of about my age and older, however, had so many stories as to suggest 
that a thorough canvassing of the older members of the profession might fill 
a virtual Archaeologists’ Museum of Guilty Treasures! Each of the colleagues 
I contacted seemed eager, even relieved, to share his or her experiences—for 
every one had a story, long since shoved to the very back of memory because 
today it embarrasses. Almost every one of them also said that “everyone did it 
back then.”
“Back then” was basically before the 1970 unesco Convention on Cultural 
Property, although it was probably another decade before most archaeologists 
fully recognized and accepted the changes that the Convention and surround-
ing discussions brought to our professional sense of the ethics of collecting 
antiquities. “Back then,” which was also before archaeological survey had come 
into its own, it was common practice for budding archaeologists to hike the 
countryside, looking for unexcavated but known sites, off the beaten tourist 
paths, and, if we were lucky, even discovering sites that hadn’t been recorded 
before. It was all part of the learning process: getting to know the countryside, 
the preferred locations for certain kinds of sites, and, especially important, 
learning to see, identify, and date the bits of, especially, pottery found on the 
surface that were the indicators of what lay below. I know I felt an emotional 

811
“Outing” the Old Teaching Collections
attachment to the first sherd I found, and, according to the professor in charge, 
had been able to accurately assign the style and date. Finally I was getting be-
yond book learning and becoming a real archaeologist. Surely that was a large 
part of the reason I surreptitiously pocketed it, even though I knew doing so 
was illegal. The sherd was a surface find. It was worn and weathered, without 
a good archaeological context. It had no commercial value—and it honestly 
never even occurred to me, nor, I’m sure, to any of the rest of the “everyone” 
who “did it”—to sell or otherwise profit financially from these sherds. What 
we did imagine was passing the sherds around a future class, so that our stu-
dents could experience the thrill of actually touching a piece of pottery made 
and used so very long ago, so they could see what archaeologists usually have 
to work with (as opposed to the lovely intact pots illustrated in textbooks), 
and feel the satisfaction of extracting information even from small fragments. 
Today I see the contradictions implicit in that dream. At the time, I didn’t. I 
pocketed occasional sherds, though we were officially told not to. “Back then … 
everyone did it.” We felt a little guilty at the time, but we were only bending the 
law a little, and, we were sure, for a very good cause.
The next step was getting these sherds back home. Airport security, with its 
body scanners, baggage x-rays and the other givens of 21st century air travel had 
not been imagined yet. Customs officers paid much more attention to what 
you brought into a country than to what you took out. I’d had wildflowers that 
were pressed in my Blue Guide confiscated as potential drugs, which seemed to 
be the main thing customs officers were interested in. Sometimes they would 
open and go through a suitcase on the way out of a country, but that was rare. 
So sherds went home in cosmetic jars, the toes of shoes, and wrapped up in 
dirty socks. Legend had it that one particularly earnest young professor, with a 
larger collection of sherds than most, neatly arranged his sherds between two 
undershirts and carefully sewed around each one so it would stay in place. He 
wore this amazing undergarment for close to 24 hours, on a series of crowded 
flights, in the heat of late summer.
Once back at the scholar’s home university, the sherds, generally considered 
the personal possessions of the person who had collected them, lived in ci-
gar boxes, cloth sacks, office drawers, map cabinets. Sometimes a department 
had space and storage or display facilities available for them, and the teach-
ing collections became departmental resources, at least as long as the original 
collector remained in the department and the space wasn’t needed for other 
purposes.
Gradually, through the 1980s and ’90s, archaeology and its relations with the 
larger world changed. In the 1990s most of our professional organizations es-
tablished formal codes of ethics and standards of professional behavior, all of 

Vitelli

which, in one form or another, declared, as the aia’s 1990/1997 Code of Ethics 
did, that members should
Refuse to participate in the trade in undocumented antiquities and re-
frain from activities that enhance the commercial value of such objects. 
Undocumented antiquities are those which are not documented as be-
longing to a public or private collection before December 30, 1970, when 
the aia Council endorsed the unesco Convention on Cultural Property, 
or which have not been excavated and exported from the country of ori-
gin in accordance with the laws of that country2
While the teaching collections could, arguably, be claimed as legitimate under 
these conditions—most had come to the us before 1970, they had not been 
the subject of “trade,” and the broken bits of ordinary pottery had no com-
mercial value—still, the lengthy discussions that surrounded the adoption of 
the code made us all self-conscious about any antiquities in our possession 
or immediate surroundings. Indeed, I was among those who drew attention 
to the contradiction between lecturing about the problems caused by collect-
ing undocumented, looted objects, while sitting in an office decorated with 
antiquities.3 Some of us continued to use the sherds as teaching tools, as noted 
above, by also using them to introduce discussions of archaeological ethics.
Others were less comfortable doing this and simply pushed the collections 
to the back of a drawer or closet and tried to forget about them. As the original 
collectors reach retirement, the collections are coming back to haunt us. What 
should we do with them? Some have given them to younger colleagues, as the 
colleague with the Southwestern sherds had to me. Some of those recipients 
told me that, while they had felt they couldn’t decline the gift from a senior col-
league, they didn’t want to be seen or known as using illicit material. So once 
again, the collections had gone to the back of a closet.
Occasionally, especially with a larger collection, it has been possible to 
find a long-term departmental home, as Dr. M. Spiro did for her extensive col-
lection, which she offered to donate to the Ancient Studies Department at 
umbc.4 ­Apparently the Ancient Studies faculty, after considerable thought

fact, in the 1970s, I had tried to acquire a legal teaching collection for the Ancient Studies 
department in exchange for a cash donation to the Greek Archaeological Service. It almost

“Outing” the Old Teaching Collections
and anguished discussion, decided to accept the collection. It is to be housed 
in a new archaeology lab and used for a wide variety of teaching purposes.5 
But this kind of arrangement must be rare in today’s ethical atmosphere and 
economic climate.
Several of us thought we would just hand these collections over to our uni-
versity museums, which generally are involved in educational outreach, have 
the facilities for storage and long-term curation, and generally seem the most 
appropriate place for them. But here we run into an unintended consequence 
of the success of earlier ethics discussions. Today many university museums 
have strong acquisitions policies that preclude accepting antiquities, even by 
gift, if the objects had been removed illegally from their country of origin.6
Given the difficulty of finding homes for these collections and the ethical 
shadow under which they now live, it is not surprising that many, like those 
in the former Program in Classical Archaeology at Indiana University, simply 
disappear. Where do they end up? In a dumpster? That would be bad enough, 
but a worse possibility occurs to me: some collections could land in the hands 
of people, even well-intentioned but ill-informed people—perhaps even the 
original collector’s children and grandchildren, who don’t know anything or 
really care about contemporary archaeology—who could put the pieces up for 
sale on eBay or the equivalent, where everything now has some “commercial 
value.”
These illegal teaching collections exist, if my limited survey is any indica-
tion, in fairly large numbers. They have served exceedingly useful purposes 
over the years, introducing many a student to the thrill—and the more usual 
grind—of archaeological research. I can still see the look on a young student’s 
face when she felt her fingers slip into the depressions made by the Neolithic 
potter’s fingers when she built the pot 6,000–7,000 years ago. But students also 
learned from these sherds: to orient a rim sherd to begin to see the shape of 
the pot, to measure rim and body diameters of the original pot from the small 
remaining segment, and to reconstruct the pot’s size and shape on paper; to 
compare the fabric and building techniques of pieces from different times and 
worked, but in the end, the Greek authorities decided the arrangement still amounted to 
selling antiquities.

places, to recognize firing practices and the range of ceramic color, to notice 
breakage patterns, and stylistic elements, motifs, and wear patterns. A few stu-
dents practiced making thin sections and learned how to read them under a 
binocular microscope. They researched the shapes and styles, and learned to 
build a story about past lives from fragmentary evidence—and they learned 
the limitations of trying to do so when no archaeological context for the pieces 
is available. Those of us who have used these collections over the years have 
found them invaluable tools. Several colleagues commented that they didn’t 
know how they would have managed to teach certain aspects of archaeology 
without these ­collections, since it is impossible to take every student into the 
field.
In today’s climate, it is highly unlikely that new teaching collections could 
be formed. Today’s ethics are different, the laws better known, understood, and 
even enforced, the countries of origin more vigilant, the professional conse-
quences too severe. One colleague wrote of watching, in the company of the 
local Director of Antiquities, while bulldozers completely demolished a pre-
historic mound to level the ground for a new highway. Horrified by the whole 
scene, she begged permission to take a sample of sherds back to her university 
as a teaching collection. The Director would have none of it. He agreed that the 
sherds and other fragments would simply be ground to dust by the machinery 
or become incorporated in the concrete roadway—or be gathered up by local 
collectors as soon as he left the site—but the law, he insisted, precluded taking 
any samples. Period. The colleague’s anger and frustration, even many years 
after the event, were palpable in her account. We all know similar stories.
I remember well a day when I was the lone foreigner working in a museum 
storeroom, when a very agitated guard barged in and asked me to come quickly 
to the museum entrance. It seemed there were some foreigners at the front 
desk, waving a sherd around and asking for something the guards didn’t un-
derstand. The foreigners proved to be a couple from Australia, who, on their 
first trip to Greece, had been to visit relatives of some Australian-Greek friends. 
The relatives lived in a very small, rural village, had been thrilled by the visit 
even without the ability to communicate verbally, and had feasted and feted 
the Australians with legendary Greek village generosity. When the time came 
to leave, the hosts insisted on giving them something special with which to re-
member the day. They produced a small (ca. 2 in. × 3 in.) potsherd with figural 
decoration, presumably found in their fields, and pressed it on their visitors. 
The visitors were well informed, both about Greek generosity—they accepted 
graciously and with great show of thanks and awe, apparently knowing that 
to refuse would have been both pointless and an affront—and Greek antiqui-
ties laws: hence the trip directly to the nearest archaeological museum to turn 

815
“Outing” the Old Teaching Collections
in the precious sherd to proper governmental authorities. In exchange, they 
asked only that someone tell them a little about the kind of pottery it was.
I listened to their tale, translated it for the guards and explained that these 
foreigners wanted to give the sherd to the museum. The guards were non-
plussed. They had no idea how to proceed. Nothing like this had ever hap-
pened before.7 Somehow, we came up with a plan and some paperwork for 
the ­Australians to sign to make the gift look official; the guards worked on this 
while I showed the Australians comparable pottery from the exhibits in the 
museum and told them a bit about contemporary activity in the area. They left 
quite happy. The guards took the sherd and the signed piece of paper down into 
the bowels of the museum—probably never to be seen again: an unmarked 
sherd with no provenience, in a museum that houses hundreds of thousands 
of excavated sherds is of little interest to the scholars anxiously trying to pro-
duce the publications of their own finds. Indeed, that sherd brings to mind the 
small mountain of sherds that once piled up in the Argos Museum gardens, 
and another similar pile on the roof of the nearby Nauplion storeroom: they 
were sherds from local excavations, sherds deemed too worn to be of use, or 
duplicates of pieces from better contexts or, for whatever reason—including 
too little storage space in the museum—destined to be, and eventually were, 
reburied in an ancient well or at sea, with appropriate labels, but nevertheless, 
effectively discarded.
Perhaps some day we will think of a way to make legal teaching collections 
available from such collections of “discards” and otherwise compromised ordi-
nary sherds, without in the process contributing to the commercialization of 
antiquities and further looting of the (ever fewer) remaining intact sites. But 
for now, we must acknowledge that creating new teaching collections is off the 
table, and those that exist, however illicit by today’s standards, need to be safe-
guarded, used for the educational purposes they serve so well, and prevented 
from finding their way to any commercial context. How can we do that?
I asked some colleagues and friends with experience of both field archaeol-
ogy and university museums for help and advice. Geoffrey Conrad, Director 
of the Mathers Museum of World Cultures at Indiana University, understood 
my concerns, while acknowledging that his museum’s acquisitions policy pre-
vented it from accepting such collections. He suggested that perhaps our pro-
fessional organizations could come up with a recommendation for handling 
these collections that would make it possible for university museums to take

them over. Lauren Talalay, Associate Director and Curator, Kelsey Museum, 
University of Michigan, noted that her museum unofficially kept a number of 
such collections in a kind of limbo, but used them extensively in educational 
outreach programs and in undergraduate and graduate classes. She indicated 
that the Kelsey would be delighted to have a means of making these collec-
tions a legitimate part of their holdings.
Just about then, another archaeologist, Alex Barker, Director of the Museum 
of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri, wrote to me about a retiring 
colleague who had recently offered the museum his teaching collection of ille-
gally exported sherds. I immediately responded, telling Alex about the problem 
I was working on. Not surprisingly, he was already thinking along similar lines. 
He quickly came up with several points that relevant professional organiza-
tions might be willing to include in crafting an exception for university muse­
ums to acquire such teaching collections. He suggested that museums might 
accept orphaned study collections of sherds under the following conditions:
(1)	
They are accepted for educational purposes;
(2)	 The donor does not receive a tax benefit of any kind for the gift, derives 
no direct or indirect benefit from the transfer, and the transfer is treated 
as a transfer of custody rather than a gift; and
(3)	 The museum notifies the country of origin, so the collection can either be 
held with title granted by that country, or be held as a loan (permanent or 
otherwise) from that country.
The last element [he pointed out] may be problematic, but follows on the 
second. If no title is transferred, museums can’t assert right of possession, 
and under the McClain doctrine title would always be dicey anyway.8 Item 3 
­acknowledges that issue, confronts it head-on, and would make it unlikely that 
any museum seeking to acquire unprovenanced antiquities from the market or 
from collectors could use this exception to their benefit. If the person transfer-
ring the collection isn’t transferring title, he or she can’t derive a benefit, and by 
contacting the source country the museum can establish some form of right of 
possession, so it’s not left with collections in limbo. It also means that source 
countries, should they receive too many such requests or sense any other kind 
of abuse of the arrangement, could demand the objects’ return. I think such an 
arrangement might be acceptable to source countries, since it acknowledges 
their patrimonial rights; I may be mistaken, but I think, e.g, that Greece would

be less concerned with getting such a collection back than having its right to 
do so acknowledged. And it doesn’t actually violate applicable antiquities stan-
dards, since it involves permission of the source country.9
Alex’s provisions seem to me to cover the necessary bases. They provide a 
legitimate home for the collections, where they will still be accessible for use 
as teaching tools, will be preserved for the long term, and would be prevented 
from making their way to the antiquities market. The institution would not 
benefit from the exception, and the collections might actually achieve a be-
lated legal status. Conceivably, this arrangement, which includes requesting 
legal permission from the countries of origin, could lead eventually to other, 
legal, teaching collections being created out of materials that would otherwise 
be destroyed, so that they could be given to legitimate educational institutions, 
strictly for teaching purposes. I would love to see that happen, but for now, I, 
and a good many colleagues, would be quite happy to settle for a legitimate 
safe home for already existing, closeted, teaching collections. Alex and I shall 
continue to work to that end. We would be grateful to receive any comments 
and assistance readers might want to share.10

Dedication
The paper that lies at the origin of this essay was written at the instance of Frank 
Grande, then chair of the Department of History at the City College of New York, for 
the Third Session on Ancient Thought at ccny in the autumn of 1997. Frank was a 
good friend of Oscar Muscarella, whom I came to know well while I worked on the 
cuneiform tablet collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. During my years at the 
museum Oscar and I conversed countless times, as he imparted ideas and information 
about artifacts, archaeological method, venality and justice, forgery, museum practic-
es, and the detective work of figuring it all out. Then one winter Oscar introduced me 
to Frank, when ccny needed one more adjunct to teach a section of World History 
from prehistory to 1500 c.e. As a doctoral student in Bible and Ancient Near East at 
New York University, I had not been aware that such an absurdly all-encompassing 
course existed, and I was not a little nonplussed to see the textbook and syllabus Frank 
put into my hands. During the ensuing year Frank tacitly became my mentor—an un-
prepossessing, almost imperturbable guide who anticipated questions and problems 
I didn’t know I’d have—as I learned how to teach broad undergraduate survey courses 
that were supposed to cover the history of the world from Sargon to Saddam. Thanks 
to the opportunity and guidance Frank gave me, I acquired the requisite skills to obtain 
a position teaching ancient history, using as a job talk the very paper that was the first 
incarnation of the present essay.
It was in the museum that I learned to understand texts as features of the artifacts that 
bear them, and from Oscar I came to understand what meaning the histories of arti-
facts have. It was from Frank, now deceased, that I learned the craft of teaching history. 
The little oeuvre presented here, wholly rewritten using the text of that 1997 paper as a 
foundation, is offered to them both, archaeologist and historian, en homage.*

Figure and Ground: Reading Ancient Near Eastern Sources
How do we apprehend a past remote in time and, moreover, divided from 
our present by a caesura in transmission? The societies of the ancient Near 
East were absorbed into new cultural and political formations in the wake of 
­Hellenistic rule, their literatures, historical traditions, and cities becoming sub-
merged so thoroughly that they left no direct descendants. To this generaliza-
tion the Hebrew Bible is of course an important exception, and one could also 
catalogue many and various elements inherited from Near Eastern antiquity 
in the present. But no work of cuneiform literature—for example—made the 
leap into the languages and scripts that displaced those of ancient Mesopota-
mia. The cultural production of several millennia was left in the past, whence 
we now unearth it through archaeological excavation.
This caesura between then and now has the advantage that the distorting 
lenses of continuous transmission, selection, and manipulation do not inter-
vene between ourselves and our ancient Near Eastern source material. Instead 
it arrives in our hands—ideally—direct from the context of its final deposition 
in the ground. But the artifacts and texts we excavate are not accompanied by 
the lived realities that formed the ground of their production; this we must 
somehow infer, in order to write the history of the ancient Near East. Histori-
cal method requires that inference be guided by understanding sources not as 
direct representations of the past from which they derive but as artifacts of the 
processes that account for their existence, processes that cannot be made vis-
ible by examining only the sources themselves. The present essay considers the 
nature of inference, as an element of a theory of reading sources (principally 
textual ones), in the study of ancient Near Eastern history. I suggest that this 
element may be apprehended by way of a metaphor: the text, rather than be-
ing a record of the past, is figured upon the ground of that past. By examining 
the negative of the image conveyed by a text, throwing what it states into relief 
against what it does not, we can limn the historical reality that gave it form.
	
Sources and Theory
A naïve positivism eschews theory and method alike to view historical inquiry 
as a simple matter of discovering texts and archaeological remains and ar-
ranging the material in the correct chronological order, so as to let the sources 
“speak for themselves,” a procedure qualified only by asking whether what a 
text records is “true.” But no sources speak for themselves. Every artifact or text

was produced for particular purposes, under particular circumstances, to be 
apprehended, transmitted, or discarded by particular people, and it is shaped 
by such factors from its origin to our reception of it. We cannot use it as a his-
torical source without grasping its context and purposes from the standpoint 
of its creators and original users. This may seem like a circular proposition, 
inasmuch as the artifacts and texts themselves provide our only evidence for 
their contexts and purposes. Indeed one cannot entirely escape logical cir-
cularity in the interpretation of a given body of sources without testing one’s 
interpretations using either independent evidence, or independent modes of 
analysis; hence the necessity of explicit method. While the same principles ap-
ply to the study of history in all periods, they are more difficult to apply across 
the ruptures that separate antiquity from the present. In the study of ancient 
Near Eastern history, there is no continuous line of transmission from the sub-
ject of inquiry to the subject who inquires: the past must first be discovered 
before interpretation can begin—and begin to be unshackled from inherited 
preconceptions.
The umbrella term “ancient Near East” encompasses the Levant, Mesopo-
tamia, Anatolia, Iran, Egypt, and adjacent regions during the periods from 
late fourth to the late first millennium b.c.e. The written record of this large 
area and time span comprises millions of individual texts in several languages 
and scripts, on various media, among which cuneiform tablets predominate 
overall. The great majority of these texts are records of household and insti-
tutional administration, transactions, and communication between parties at 
all scales, from individual to imperial—in short, texts that form the contents 
of what we loosely call archives. Following archival records in quantity are cat-
egories of texts pertaining to cultic, royal, or scribal functions. Temples spon-
sored the textualization of (for example) rituals and hymns, while monarchic 
regimes produced royal inscriptions and narratives featuring the king as pro-
tagonist. And scribes, whose task writing was, produced the textual apparatus 
for organizing and maintaining the world recorded in writing: labels, dockets, 
catalogues, year-name lists, king lists, and the like, as well as curricular texts 
and reference works. To be added to the foregoing categories are scientific and 
scholarly works, such as manuals for divination, magic, or medicine, which are 
particular to each literate culture (though the summary I have given makes it 
plain that the Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform tradition supplies the background 
paradigm). Meanwhile, scribes also recorded or composed poetry and prose 
works in a variety of genres from myth to historiography to satire, material 
that readily qualifies as literature in a modern sense. Such literature, howev-
er, forms a tiny percentage of the written output of any ancient Near Eastern 
­culture—except for Israel and Judah. Their case is the reverse: ancient Israel 
and Judah have yielded very few texts in any of the foregoing categories, and

instead are represented principally by the literature compiled into the anthol-
ogy that became the Bible, a collection of diverse texts that took form through 
a many-stage process of composition, selection, redaction, and eventual canon 
formation. As such the Bible is a composite of sources very different from the 
majority of those available for the rest of the ancient Near East.
And that highlights the peculiarity of this field of study. The written ­sources 
that derive from the several civilizations of the ancient Near East differ 
in kind, on the whole, from those that we read in order to learn about, say, 
­ancient Greece, Rome, or China. For ancient Near Eastern history there is no 
­Herodotus or Livy or Sima Qian to stitch together a continuous narrative for us, 
complete with explanations of causes and relationships among entities. Such 
narratives about the past as we possess tend to supply historical fiction, not 
fact. Nor is there any Levantine Aristotle to explain how he and his contem-
poraries understood their world. Even the most philosophical of ancient Near 
Eastern texts do not explicitly set forth their authors’ thought; rather they pres-
ent its framework or results, often in the form of manuals or compendia (such 
as lists of omens or laws or grammatical paradigms) and sometimes in liter-
ary form (such as the Epic of Gilgamesh), and they leave the understanding to 
the reader. The most reliable historiography is represented by the Babylonian 
Chronicle Series, which, without ostensible bias, offers a spare account of what 
happened year after year in Mesopotamia over two centuries and a half: mere 
facts in sequence, bare of explanation and evaluation alike.1 In short, there are 
no expository works that supply us with the armature of interpretation, and, 
outside the Bible, no source that provides a ready-made narrative of an ancient 
Near Eastern past.
Instead we have an unwieldy multitude of disparate sources that yield no 
explicit answers to whatever inquiry we address to them. Their content delim-
ited by the purposes for which they were written, they present patches of data 
that we must stitch together ourselves, across huge gaps unaccounted for by 
extant texts. This difficulty is at once a boon, however, insofar as the historian 
is unconstrained by a preexisting framework. Moreover, the recalcitrance of 
ancient Near Eastern sources is compensated by a countervailing advantage, 
in that great numbers of them are “primary” sources in the proper sense: they 
are contemporaneous with the events that occasioned their writing, and every 
one bears a direct relationship to the moment it refers to—for instance, a sale 
contract documents an actual sale, and a dedicatory inscription represents an

Chronicles,” 285–298, who demonstrates that they comprise (at least) two groups having

95–123.

actual dedication (usually of the object on which it is inscribed), recorded at 
the point in time when the sale or dedication was accomplished. Genre and 
function provide a rough-and-ready means to rank sources in a hierarchy of 
factuality, usually inverse to the importance of their content; thus administra-
tive texts are regarded as records of facts, albeit insignificant ones, while ac-
counts of the deeds of kings are read as documents of monarchic ideology. In 
other words, given guidelines for interpretation, the historian has material that 
is superior because it is virtually unmediated. The very fact that most ancient 
Near Eastern sources are not, like the Bible and classical sources, products of 
a complex process of transmission leading from the past they portray to the 
present moment makes the ancient Near East, in theory, more immediately 
accessible to historical inquiry.
Other scholars have made similar observations, with reference to diverse 
genres of texts. Niek Veldhuis, considering curricular texts (and proverbs in 
particular), contrasts the Sumerologist’s sources with those of the classicist, 
pointing out that while the former lack the “philosophical speculation [and] 
self-reflection” of the latter, the Sumerian texts are contemporaneous with 
their contexts of production, use, and discard; the fact that the sources come 
to us in their original material form, from their archaeological context, makes 
possible inquiries of a different kind from those that can be conducted with 
­inherited classical texts.2 In discussing Assyrian inscriptions as sources for As-
syrian political thought, Peter Machinist remarks that unlike classical Greek 
writings they offer no “systematic treatise” on the subject, partly because of 
their character as royal inscriptions, but also because ancient Near Eastern 
writings in general tend “to avoid at least in written form an explicit statement 
of principles or generalizations about phenomena and thus an explicit grap-
pling with deductive or inductive analyses of them.”3 Thus, as Jens Høyrup 
observes, abstract mathematics is manifest in Mesopotamian sources only as 
applied mathematics.4 Maynard Maidman, emphasizing the value to the his-
torian of primary over secondary sources—especially narrative histories that 
tend to trap the reader within their own construction of the past—elaborates 
the contrast between unmediated archival records like those we have in abun-
dance from the ancient Near East, and historiography (which is already the 
product of selection and interpretation) such as we are provided by ancient 
Greece, Rome, and Israel.5 The problem of narrative history is treated by Marc

conceptualization of mathematical principles and their illustration in computational prac-
tice, an issue addressed by Peter Damerow in his contribution to the same volume.

Van De Mieroop, who, drawing on the work of Hayden White, uses the ­example 
of the literary traditions about Sargon of Agade to illustrate the difficulties 
narrative sources present the historian, as well as the invalidity of a positiv-
ist approach that treats such material as sources of “facts.” Seductive in their 
coherence and logic, narratives are unreliable as witnesses to real events for 
that very reason; meanwhile, like all sources, they were shaped for purposes of 
the present in which they were written rather than being fossil records of the 
past they portray.6 The same applies to the use of ancient Greek or any other 
narrative histories as records of the past—and, of course, to the histories we 
write ourselves.
The contrast between the ancient Near East and the Greco-Roman world is 
not to be overdrawn. On the one hand, of course epigraphic and documentary 
sources are also known from ancient Greece and Rome, though they have yet 
to displace narrative and expository works in constructing the story of the past. 
On the other hand, certain categories of ancient Near Eastern texts were gener-
ated from a matrix of inquiry and reflection that the summary of source mate-
rial I have given fails to suggest. The difference in the kinds of sources typical of 
one civilization or the other arises, in the first instance, from differences in the 
uses to which writing was put and in the conventions determining what got 
put into writing. Matters that are conveyed orally are not textualized absent 
some transformation affecting writer, media, and audience at once. Moreover, 
in any given genre of expression or communication, writing often enters ini-
tially as a supplement or support for oral articulation, not a replacement for 
it. The corollary is that texts are produced with actual or potential readers or 
hearers in view: an audience, a user group, or a public to receive texts is neces-
sary for them to be written. Once a new kind of text and the associated kind of 
audience come into being, the practice of writing and reading such texts may 
feed back on itself to promote the genre’s development.7 So, for example, in 
6	 Van De Mieroop, Cuneiform Texts and the Writing of History, 76–85. Analogous to his example 
of the Sargonic legends is the use modern scholars have made of the narrative inscribed on 
the statue of Idrimi, king of Alalaḫ, which has repeatedly been paraphrased and pressed into 
service as a template for writing the early phase of the Late Bronze Age (see von Dassow, 
State and Society, 23–45, with references to previous scholarship there). By contrast, although 
we have far more evidence of Idrimi’s son Niqmepa’s reign, no modern history of the ancient 
Near East narrates it, because no ancient source does (State and Society, 46). I attempt to 
make up the gap, upon examining the evidence, by sketching a story for Niqmepa, and his 
son, too (State and Society, 45–64, 363–366). This endeavor is however subject to the same 
criticism as the re-telling of ancient narratives is (see further below, at n. 34).
7	 These axioms are central to Seth Sanders’s study of the transformations that made the writ-
ing of the Hebrew Bible possible in the first millennium b.c.e. (Sanders, The Invention of He-
brew). As Sanders explains, the introduction of “the people” as the protagonist and ­audience

ancient Mesopotamia the writing of omen compilations, in Israel and Judah 
the writing of prophecies, and in classical Greece the writing of dramas flour-
ished. But in every case, what was not put into writing forms the ground for 
what was. We cannot simply read a culture from its texts without considering 
not only what kinds of material may have failed to survive, but what was never 
given written form to begin with.
How then do we proceed? First, as should already be obvious, the work 
of history does not involve merely connecting the dots and piecing together 
bits of data found in disparate sources—here a royal inscription, there a date 
­formula, then a letter, etc.—so as to stitch together a patchwork narrative. Sup-
pose that according to one source king A claims control of place x, and ac-
cording to another, king B claims it; to conclude without further ado that the 
place passed from the control of one king to the other would be an uncritical, 
“fundamentalist” reading of the texts. Such a reading would fail to recognize 
that kings A and B each have reasons to state their control of x in writing, 
and the reason may have nothing to do with whether the statement has a ba-
sis in fact.8 Instead we must consider not only the motivation for making the 
statement, but the reason for recording it in writing and the conditions that 
necessitated—or made possible—the production of the written record. We 
need to ask what is not there by reference to what is: what is the ground for the 
figure the source presents?
This theory of interpretation has been articulated before, sometimes in 
rather similar terms. Miguel Civil sums up a disquisition on how to understand 
ancient sources by stating the principle that the information a text contains 
receives meaning by contrast with its background, its world, which the text 
does not contain and which we must discover.9 Along the same lines, Mario 
Liverani formulates the principle that ideology is the inverse of reality, and in-
sofar as it is ideology (or the structure of ideas) that sources present, the ­reality 
of written accounts of events, and the concomitant development of systems for writing 
in the vernacular of the people being addressed, made possible the new genres of written 
prophecy, history, and law that are represented by the Bible; these developments moreover 
promoted the transformation of tradition and lived experience into texts that people would 
transmit, edit, maintain, and continuously revivify.
8	 For a concrete example, see my discussion of the claims reported in the inscription of Narām-
Sîn of Uruk, in particular his claim to Edurû-Sîn-isa, formerly controlled by Sumu-El of Larsa; 
von Dassow, “Narām-Sîn of Uruk,” 74–75.
9	 In his words, “(1) la información de un texto recibe su sentido del contraste con el fondo, 
el background, no incluido en el texto, y (2) este fondo tenemos que descubrirlo nosotros, 
no es el nuestro, y a menudo no conseguiremos descubrirlo totalmente” (Civil, “El arte de 
escuchar,” 16).

Figure and Ground: Reading Ancient Near Eastern Sources
that accounts for them must be read as the negative of what they state.10 To do 
this is not at all the same as arguing from silence, nor does it involve a perverse 
reading of the evidence: it does not compel asserting, for example, that the 
existence of a treaty of peace means peace had not been concluded, but rather 
that it means there had been war (or at least that war threatened). Similarly, 
if sources repeat claims of hegemony over some entity, this indicates that he-
gemony was disputed. Liverani explains how the irregularities found in a text, 
or a corpus, provide a key to the structures of meaning that account for its 
content and formulation—structures that are not present within the source 
but form the ground of its existence.11 With this approach, gaps, omissions, and 
silences themselves become evidence.
	
Applications
Civil illustrates the application of this theory using the example of a tablet 
from Ebla that records a series of logograms selected from the sign-list known 
as ed Lú A alongside syllabic spellings giving their pronunciation. The Ebla 
sign list fails to match its model exactly, omitting some entries and inserting 
other data. Treating these anomalies not as errors but as elements of a pattern, 
thus, as evidence for the living context of the text, Civil interprets the tablet as 
“the skeleton of a lesson” in which the teacher would explain to his students 
the relation of sign to sense.12 The oral content of instruction is also invoked 
by Veldhuis in explaining how lexical texts were used to teach the cuneiform 
­writing system and, furthermore, how proverbs were used to teach Sumerian 
grammar: proverbs are arranged in series exhibiting an ordered succession 
of different Sumerian verbal forms, which the teacher would have explained 
10	
Accordingly, “propaganda and reality make up a ‘zero-sum game,’ with the former com-
pensating for what is missing in the latter,” as Liverani puts it in Prestige and Interest, 179. 
That is, what is not recorded is implied by what is. This principle applies to the contents 
of past reality as well as to the sources for it: those few actors and events that did enter 
the written record represent, in the negative, those that produced no surviving evidence. 
Thus, “these [unattested rulers] are the kings who have no place in the history books, 
who are just the silent majority against which the successful rulers stand out” (Liverani, 
“Deeds of Ancient Mesopotamian Kings,” 2359). One of those kings who had no place in 
history, until just a few years ago, was Narām-Sîn of Uruk (see above, n. 8).

Civil, “El arte de escuchar,” 16–17. He does not identify the Ebla tablet by any siglum or

orally in Akkadian.13 His analysis considers not the content of the proverbs 
so much as the structures their organization makes manifest. Jeremy Black 
applies the same approach to the grammatical texts that list Sumerian forms 
alongside their Akkadian counterparts, which he emphasizes are not “specula-
tive” works but tools for teaching Sumerian in an Akkadian-speaking instruc-
tional context.14 The theory of Sumerian grammar that they reflect would have 
been conveyed through oral explanation and is not found in the texts them-
selves, except insofar as it is articulated through their structure—including 
blanks left in the lists as well as artificial forms concocted to serve the purpose 
of analysis.15
Black’s, Civil’s, and Veldhuis’s readings of Mesopotamian curricular texts 
demonstrate how the lost oral context in which these texts originally func-
tioned may to some degree be inferred from them. The relation between texts 
and the environment of spoken communication, whose recovery is illustrated 
by these examples, is a species of the relation between source and historical 
reality. A text may represent the output of speaking, it may serve as the support 
for speech, or else it may record precisely what was not spoken—as tabula-
tions of data do, or lists of graphemes—for writing and written records often 
have a complementary relationship to language and speech.16 Where not the 
oral but the historical context of texts is the objective of inquiry, the idea of 
complementarity between source and background remains an interpretive 
key. This key may be found concretely in the complementarity between differ-
ent types of evidence; it may also be found theoretically, in the inverse relation 
between ideology and reality (as formulated by Liverani) or more generally 
between the contents of a source and the context that gave it rise (along the 
lines indicated by Civil), a relationship I mean to capture with the metaphor of 
figure and ground. In the following paragraphs I develop a series of examples 
at different scales.
R.B. Parkinson, remarking that “the problems of historical interpretation 
are essentially the same as those of reading texts,” adduces The Teaching of 
Amenemhat to illustrate the relation of (literary) text to history.17 This text,

which has the dead king say that he had not yet enthroned his son beside him 
when he was assassinated, appears to contradict the evidence for a co-regency 
between Amenemhat I and his son Senwosret I, producing “a dichotomy be-
tween literature and historical data” that has given Egyptologists considerable 
difficulty and led some to concoct elaborate scenarios—even to the point of 
inventing facts and duplicating the attack on Amenemhat!—in order to main-
tain a literalist reading of the Teaching while fitting it into external evidence.18 
Recognizing how the text was motivated and how it related to its cultural and 
historical context makes such contortions unnecessary. As Parkinson observes, 
the Teaching deals with “two anomic events,” the assassination of a king and 
the establishment of the first co-regency, and it does so by ventriloquizing the 
dead king; while in Egypt it was normal for living and dead to communicate, 
this device marks the text as fictional.19 As such, it denies the fact of co-regency 
and, having addressed the aberration of the king’s assassination directly, “pres-
ents the succession in ideologically normative terms.”20
Such “ideological normativity” pervades Egyptian accounts of kingship and 
the deeds of kings, and reality can often be seen to have failed to conform to 
royal rhetoric. The inscriptions extolling Ramesses ii’s putative victory at the 
Battle of Qadesh come to mind. So do the reports of Thutmose iii’s successive 
campaigns in northern Syria, which each reiterate his claims to have subju-
gated the polities of the region.21 But evidence from those polities themselves 
belies his claims: none of the excavated sites in northern Syria has produced 
any textual or archaeological evidence of Egyptian rule during the 15th century 
b.c.e.; rather, the textual evidence from such sites attests that this region was 
under the suzerainty of Mittani, Egypt’s chief rival in this period.22 Thutmose 
iii did extend Egypt’s reach to the Euphrates, but his reach proved to exceed 
his grasp, at the same time that it set a new benchmark from which claims 
of pharaonic hegemony could not so quickly retreat. So the sources present 
the “figure” of the pharaoh repeating his success in extending Egypt’s rule over 
northern Syria, but in the meantime the very repetition, as well as the fact that 
his later campaigns reached less far north than his earlier ones, suggests that 
the “ground” behind the figure was failure to establish real control, combined

with the necessity of presenting the pharaoh as always successful and always 
in control.23
The metaphor of figure and ground may be usefully applied to the longue 
durée, as well as to discrete moments. Predominant in Egyptian sources, most 
of which emanate from the pharaonic regime and the associated elite, is an 
ideology of native rule by an all-powerful monarch over a bounded and stable 
Egypt that is distinct from, and defended against, the chaotic and unstable peo-
ples and territories beyond its boundaries. This ideal, reinforced through both 
texts and imagery, is inculcated in the minds of those who study these sources 
as it must have been in the minds of the people by and for whom they were 
created. Modern scholarship has tended to swallow Egyptian ideology whole, 
and to present Egyptian history very much as Pharaoh and his circle wanted it 
presented.24 The pharaonic ideology of centralized, native rule over a unitary 
Egypt may be counterbalanced, however, by observing how often Egypt was in-
vaded, came under “foreign” rule, or was divided into two or more polities—all 
of which periods, if added together, account for more of ancient Egypt’s history 
than the periods of centralized rule under “native” Egyptian dynasties!25 If we

On the image of pharaoh crafted for the consumption of the internal Egyptian audience 
(regardless of external reality), see Liverani, Prestige and Interest, esp. pp. 47, 64–65, 115–
125, 132, and 265. It follows that it is invalid to use Egyptian programmatic statements 
about territorial control to map Egypt’s actual empire in Asia (Prestige and Interest, 58).
24	
This tendency is evident even in resistance to it, as manifest in Toby Wilkinson’s recent 
book, The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt, and in this book’s reception by the non-specialist 
public, which readily perceives a continuum from the pharaohs to the regime of Hosni 
Mubarak (and now Abdel Fattah el-Sisi); see Wendy Smith’s review of Wilkinson’s book in 
the Los Angeles Times. Wilkinson remarks that the texts and monuments of the pharaohs 
“dominate our view of ancient Egyptian history,” to the point that “we are inclined to take 
the texts and monuments at face value”; his qualification of such an uncritical approach 
is not, however, to read the sources against the grain, but to point to the “dark side” of 
ancient Egypt: the coercion and ideological control that sustained the pharaonic regime 
(Wilkinson, xxxiii). Ancient Egypt thus becomes a model of “the relationship between 
rulers and ruled” (p. xxxiv), a subject whose study offers lessons about “the devices by 
which people have been organized, cajoled, dominated, and subjugated down to the pres-
ent day” (p. xxxvi). As true as this may be, it falsely implies that the whole of Egyptian 
civilization may be epitomized by monarchic domination alone. Yet Wilkinson traces this 
civilization’s origins to Nabta Playa in the Western Desert, where monuments created in 
the early 5th millennium b.c.e. represent communal endeavor by a “highly organized 
society” for which he postulates not coercive rulers but “wise decision-makers” (p. 9).

Our division of ancient Egypt’s history into “kingdom” periods interrupted by “inter-
mediate” periods reflects adherence to the ideal of Egypt as a centralized, unitary state, 
­notwithstanding that the evidence reveals a more complex and variegated past. I have

could step back from the picture, we would see the background of historical 
reality behind the image deliberately created by Egyptian sources, and in that 
background would be found elements opposite to the ingredients of the im-
age—competing centers of political power, continuous flux across social and 
other boundaries, even dissent.
Of all moments in Egyptian history it is probably the Battle of Qadesh 
that has received the most intense treatment, and literalist reconstructions 
of the encounter vie with approaches that read the reality of the event against 
the portrayal of it. It has attracted this kind of attention because Ramesses ii 
commissioned textual and pictorial accounts of the battle so rich in detail they 
could serve as the basis for a video game, while these are counterbalanced by 
no surviving Hittite account.26 Consider by contrast the treaty of peace Hatti 
and Egypt concluded a generation later, which is extant in versions kept by 
both parties.27 According to the treaty, the god(s) established eternal peace 
and brotherhood between the two countries.28 The Egyptian version declares 
that “since eternity … god did not permit hostilities to arise between them,” but 
that in the time of Muwattalli they had fought each other, and now Hattusili iii 
makes this treaty “to establish the relationship which Re made and which Seth 
made.” The version kept by the Hittite court declares that “from the beginning 
of time and forever the god has not allowed the making of war between them,” 
also made this point in “Temporality and Periodization in Ancient Near Eastern History,” 
116–117, picking up on remarks by Marc Van De Mieroop, “On Writing a History of the 
Ancient Near East,” 293. See further Thomas Schneider, “Periodizing Egyptian History,” 
181–195.

The battle does receive mention in subsequent correspondence between Hatti and Egypt 
(KBo i 15+19; for edition and commentary see Edel, Die ägyptisch-hethitische Korrespon-
denz, no. 24). Liverani discusses how the Egyptian accounts employ ideological motifs in 
transforming the events of the battle into a celebratory and propagandistic tale of “victo-
ry”; see Prestige and Interest, 118–120, with references there. Ramesses ii’s texts and reliefs 
are elaborated into a kind of illustrated novella, enhanced with pragmatism and a dash of 
critical analysis (and supplemented with suggestions for “wargaming Qadesh” at the end 
of the book), by Healy, Qadesh 1300 b.c.

copied from the (Akkadian) text of the treaty tablet written by the Egyptians, while the 
Egyptian version represents a translation of the tablet composed (in Akkadian) by the 
Hittites, both parties having agreed to the terms before exchanging the final text.

reiterates that their relationship of peace and brotherhood was established 
by the Sun-god and Storm-god, and makes no mention of hostilities. Suppose 
that only the Hittites’ version of the treaty had survived? Would historians con-
clude from it that the treaty marked an end to war between Egypt and Hatti? 
They should, as the other evidence available to us confirms.
In this instance, not only do the Hittite and Egyptian versions of the treaty 
complement each other, the sources attesting war, including the Battle of Qa-
desh, also complement the treaty and reveal conflict as the background for 
making peace. Of course the proposition that a treaty should represent the res-
olution of conflict is entirely unsurprising. It is for that very reason a good test 
with which to validate the theory of historical interpretation put forward here.
I have applied this theory to interpreting the two treaties known from 15th-
century Alalaḫ, capital of a realm astride the lower Orontes, in the context of 
the rest of the textual sources found there.29 The earlier one, AlT 3, is a par-
ity treaty between Idrimi, ruler of Alalaḫ, and Pilliya, ruler of Kizzuwatna, the 
realm bordering that of Alalaḫ on the north.30 The later one, AlT 2, is a parity 
treaty between Niqmepa, Idrimi’s successor as ruler of Alalaḫ, and Ir-Teššub, 
ruler of Tunip, whose realm bordered that of Alalaḫ on the south. In each case 
the agreement was concluded under the aegis of the king of Mittani, overlord 
of both parties, and in each case it may be inferred from the treaty that the 
parties had been at war. AlT 3, whose clauses exclusively concern the return 
of fugitives between Alalaḫ and Kizzuwatna, may be read against the narra-
tive inscription on the statue of Idrimi, on the one hand, and against AlT 14, a 
tablet recording the decision of a dispute between Alalaḫ and Kizzuwatna, on 
the other hand. The inscription of Idrimi tells of his military campaign against 
“Hatti,” and names seven towns that he attacked; those that may be identified 
are located either in Alalaḫ’s territory or in the southern territory of Kizzu-
watna, which was a possession of Hatti by the time the inscription was written. 
Idrimi’s invasion of Kizzuwatna (“Hatti”) would have affected the two realms’ 
control of territory while making fugitives or refugees of part of their popula-
tions. AlT 3 was drawn up to provide for the restitution of the people affected, 
but at least one question of territorial jurisdiction was only resolved during 
the reign of Idrimi’s son Niqmepa. AlT 14 records the decision of the king of 
­Mittani that the town of Alawari, which was disputed between Niqmepa of 
Alalaḫ and Sunaššura of Kizzuwatna, belonged to Alalaḫ.

For what follows, see my discussion of the two treaties in State and Society, 34, 38, 48–49, 
and 51–54.

The siglum AlT stands for “Alalaḫ tablet,” modified from at to avoid confusion with the 
abbreviation for Altes Testament. The conventional numbering of the tablets found at 
Alalaḫ is that established by Wiseman in the editio princeps, The Alalakh Tablets.

Among clauses addressing a number of cross-border issues, AlT 2 contains 
stipulations concerning the restitution of spoil (šallatu) as well as the extradi-
tion of fugitives and even, it seems, the extradition of conspirators against one 
party taking refuge in the land of the other. These stipulations clearly point to 
war between Alalaḫ and Tunip as the background of the treaty, an inference 
that is reinforced by the evidence that the two parties engaged in hostilities 
one generation later; a fragment of a Hittite treaty with Tunip mentions a con-
flict between Tunip and Alalaḫ under Ilimilimma, who is surely to be identified 
with Ilimilimma, son of Niqmepa.31 Meanwhile, other evidence from Alalaḫ 
attests preparations for war, quite possibly war with Tunip in particular, under 
Niqmepa. This evidence takes the form of a group of census lists and rosters 
of troops that are dated to Niqmepa’s reign on the basis of prosopographic 
evidence and sealings.32 As usual with the remains of ancient archives, out of 
those that were originally written only some of the lists and rosters survive, 
and some of them are fragmentary, but we have enough to discern the relation-
ships among the texts. The census lists in question record heads-of-household, 
classified according to the category of service their households owe, from each 
of a series of fifteen towns (including Alawari, the town Niqmepa claimed from 
Kizzuwatna). One group of troop rosters records ḫabiru troops from a different 
series of towns, while the other group of troop rosters records men enlisted 
as archers from the very households recorded in the aforementioned census 
lists, as comparison of the names listed shows. The troops enlisted in both the 
ḫabiru rosters and the rosters of archers are summed up on two tablets that 
record total numbers of troops in both divisions: ḫabirū and archers in all the 
service categories, with chariot troops set apart, adding up to 2519 men alto-
gether.33 Such a force would suffice, I imagine, to prosecute a war of choice 
against an opponent roughly Alalaḫ’s own size.34

Devecchi, Trattati internazionali ittiti, 185.
32	
For full details, see ibid., 197–215. The group of census lists is that which I have labeled 
“group B” (distinct from the later “group A,” which is what is usually meant when refer-
ence to the Alalaḫ census lists is made), discussed on pp. 154–171; the rosters of ḫabiru 
troops are “group D” and the rosters of archers “group db.”
33	
The two summary tablets are AlT 183 and 226 (ibid., 209–215). Both the ḫabiru rosters and 
the group B census lists include chariotry as a category of service, or a category of troops. 
The number of chariot troops enlisted from the households recorded in the census lists 
(76) is entered in AlT 183 and 226 alongside the numbers of archers enlisted from house-
holds of other service categories.

See also ibid., 363–365, where I suggest how the evidence of the census lists and troop 
rosters may be combined with that of the treaty, and other texts, to infer the story behind 
the sources. The attempt to construct a narrative, out of evidence that supplies none, is

These texts do more, upon close examination, than attest the levying of 
troops for some particular military engagement: they also yield evidence of the 
process of levying and organizing an army. Two rosters of archers (AlT 145 and 
179) survive out of an original set of six. They list men drawn from one category 
of service, that denoted purre, in the census lists recording ­heads-of-household; 
this group originally comprised fifteen census lists, fewer than half of which 
survive. Each roster groups men by their town of origin, and each records the 
same fourteen towns in the same order. These are fourteen of the fifteen towns 
represented by the census lists recording heads-of-household; the town omit-
ted is Alawari, perhaps because the suit over whether it belonged to Alalaḫ 
or Kizzuwatna was pending at the moment of conscription.35 For every town, 
each roster records some of the same men, in the same order, as the census list 
for that town, but with the following regular differences. (a) Some names in 
the rosters do not appear in the census lists for the corresponding towns. (b) 
In the case of some towns, each of the two extant rosters enrolls every other 
man from a segment of the census list for that town, alternating with the other 
roster (that is, names 1, 3, 5 … appear in roster A, and names 2, 4, 6 … in roster 
B). (c) The names are not spelled the same way from one text to the other, and 
the spellings moreover exhibit systematic variation, so that the scribe of one 
roster tended to add a final -n to names while the scribe of the other tended to 
omit it, regardless of how the names were spelled in the census lists.36
These patterned divergences indicate, first, that the rosters were not com-
piled by selecting names from the census lists but by selecting men from the 
households subject to conscription, which the census lists recorded by their 
heads: each household had to send one man, who could be the household head 
or another adult male from the same household. Second, the rosters were com-
piled not by copying names from the census lists (in which case the names 
would generally have been spelled the same way) but by recording them as 
they were spoken. For that to happen, the men conscripted on the basis of 
the census lists must have been assembled, and their names called out to the 
scribes enlisting them on the rosters. But when this was done, the men were 
­reorganized. They have to have been assembled by their towns, then sorted 
perhaps vain in view of the epistemological problems inherent to narrative history (see 
above, at n. 6), but it is nonetheless useful for the purpose of figuring out what past reali-
ties could have produced the evidence we have.
35	
The suit may have been resolved, and troops from Alawari enlisted, by the time conscrip-
tion was done. The grand total of all the rosters of archers, given in AlT 179, is 637 troops, 
while the figure given in AlT 226 for the same service category (purre) is 670; the augmen-
tation of 33 more troops could have come from Alawari.

into six new groups, so that every roster—every battalion—included a selec-
tion of men from all fourteen of the towns subject to the census. It puts one in 
mind of the method Cleisthenes of Athens is said to have employed to create 
artificial “tribes”—the basis for military as well as political organization—by 
aggregating demes and selecting men from each aggregate to compose the new 
tribes.37
	
Literary Figures against a Visual Ground
I shall conclude this essay by examining a motif that occurs in both the visual 
imagery and the literature of the Iron Age Levant. The motif of the “woman at 
the window” was part of a rather standard repertoire of images used in decora-
tive arts, and it also finds ironic employment in biblical narrative. A detailed 
investigation of this motif has been undertaken by Claudia Suter, whose study 
forms the basis for the present discussion.38
Levantine artisans of the 9th and 8th century b.c.e. decorated luxury fur-
niture with ivory plaques and openwork panels carved with an array of motifs, 
prominent among which are the sphinx, the winged sun-disk, the sacred tree 
in many variations, and the image of a woman gazing out a window. Usually 
the wooden furniture has not survived, leaving only the ivories, stripped of 
the gilding and semi-precious minerals that once embellished them, to be the 
prize of the archaeologist’s spade. Often such luxury furniture had erstwhile 
become the prize of Assyrian kings, the spoil or tribute won from their western 
campaigns. Therefore the largest quantities of ivory furniture decorations, in-
cluding the majority of extant examples of the woman-at-the-window motif, 
have been found in the palaces of Assyria where they were taken after being 
collected as booty or tribute from subjugated Levantine realms. But similar 
ivories have also been found in their cities of origin, notably in Samaria, capital 
of ancient Israel, where Ahab is said to have dwelt in an “ivory palace” (I Kings 
22:39). Among the ivories found in the palace of Samaria are panels carved 
with the motif of the woman at the window.39

From the extensive bibliography on the reforms attributed to Cleisthenes, one might first 
refer to Lévêque and Vidal-Naquet, Cleisthenes the Athenian, in particular ch. 1 for the 
structure of the Cleisthenic reorganization.

See Suter, “Die Frau am Fenster.” The obscurity of the venue in which this exemplary 
study was published has evidently restricted its readership, a limitation that should by 
now have been lifted thanks to Suter’s extensive subsequent work on the ivories; see for 
­example Suter, “Images, Tradition, and Meaning.”

An example appears in Barkay, “The Iron Age ii–iii,” fig. 9.18.

Examples of this motif were produced in numerous workshops, in many re-
gional styles, but they all follow a common model and depict the same image, 
which would have been recognized and understood by its viewers. Plate 41.1 
illustrates a representative example.40 The window itself has a triple-recessed 
frame and an ornate balustrade with four (or sometimes three) colonnettes 
bearing palmette capitals; an actual balustrade of this very type has been exca-
vated at Ramat Raḥel, near Jerusalem.41 The woman’s face is depicted frontally, 
gazing out the window over the balustrade. Her hair is arranged in locks fram-
ing her face, usually tucked behind her ears, and she wears jewelry—a diadem 
or tiara as in this instance, a necklace, or sometimes earrings. Her large eyes 
and eyebrows would originally have been inlaid and accented with paint to 
represent make-up. She wears an expression that might be seen as expectant 
or welcoming, often with a small smile.
The image of the woman at the window has commonly been understood as 
a depiction of a temple prostitute. Suter has demonstrated that this interpreta-
tion has no basis in ancient Near Eastern sources.42 Further, she has inquired 
what the motif might have signified for its original audience, through exam-
ining its use in the decorative arts and its instantiation in the Hebrew Bible, 
the only surviving literature from the Iron Age Levant that includes scenes of 
women looking out windows.43 She concludes that as part of the repertoire of 
imagery reflecting and supporting royal ideology, which was used to decorate 
the furnishings of royal households, the woman-at-the-window motif repre-
sents the queen looking out the palace window awaiting her king’s return.44
Three scenes in the Hebrew Bible, each in a different book, feature this 
motif. The earliest (both in the biblical narrative and in terms of its date of 
­composition) appears in the Song of Deborah. The singer, gloating over Israel’s 
victory and Jael’s murder of the enemy commander Sisera, envisions Sisera’s 
mother awaiting her son’s triumphal return:

of fertility,” nor does she stand for “the goddess of fertility” (whoever that was), as asserted 
by Aschkenasy, Woman at the Window, 13–14. Aschkenasy’s research on the meaning of 
the ancient Near Eastern image after which she has titled her book seems to have been 
limited to the single publication cited in nn. 1–5.

Without evident acquaintance with Suter’s work, Christiansen discusses one Hittite and 
two biblical instances of a different kind of scene, in which a man looks out the window 
upon a sexual encounter; see Christiansen, “Der Blick aus dem Fenster.”

Through the window peered Sisera’s mother,
Through the lattice she gazed:
“Why is his chariot so long in coming?
Why so late the clatter of his wheels?”
Judges 5:2845
– while she and her ladies imagine him dividing the spoil with his men. The 
second window scene follows David’s retrieval of the Ark of Yahweh from 
­Kiriath-jearim after his victory over the Philistines. David was “leaping and 
whirling before Yahweh” as he led the Israelites in a celebratory procession, 
bringing the Ark into Jerusalem, and his wife Michal looked out the window to 
observe his triumphal entry (ii Sam. 6:16). But she disapproved of his perfor-
mance, and told him so, wherefore she was cursed with barrenness.
The third window scene is surely the most famous. Jehu, having been 
­anointed king of Israel by the prophet Elisha, drove to Jezreel in his chariot 
and assassinated both King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah en 
route, clearing the way for his seizure of the throne. Jezebel, widow of Ahab 
and mother of Joram, got word that Jehu was coming in time to prepare: antici-
pating the king-to-be’s triumphal arrival, “she painted her eyes with kohl and 
dressed her hair, and she looked out of the window” (ii Kings 9:30). The bibli-
cal narrator describes her just as the ivories—including ones that decorated 
furniture in the palace of Samaria where Jezebel resided—depict the woman 
at the window. But Jezebel is not welcoming her victorious spouse or son home 
to his palace; she is receiving the usurper who has murdered her son. Upon 
Jehu’s arrival, Jezebel greeted him with sarcasm, calling him by the name of a 
former, unsuccessful usurper, whereupon Jehu ordered her defenestration.46 
Thus the ­narrator utilizes the woman-at-the-window motif in order, literally, to 
45	
I quote from the Jewish Publication Society’s translation of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh: 
The Holy Scriptures), with modifications, in particular choosing the alternative “gazed” 
(given there in a note on the verse) in place of “whined” for the unusual verb.
46	
Jezebel’s utterance, “Is all well, Zimri, murderer of your master?” is usually taken as a refer-
ence to the usurper Zimri, who ruled for seven days before being struck down in his turn 
by Omri, father of Ahab (I Kings 16:9ff.). Parker, however, has proposed interpreting Zimri 
not as a personal name but as “strong one,” and suggests that Jezebel’s appearance at the 
window signifies that she is offering Jehu a sexual and political alliance as his consort 
(Parker, “Jezebel’s Reception of Jehu”; I am grateful to Maynard Maidman for having pro-
vided me this reference). Parker’s suggestion comports well with Suter’s interpretation of 
the woman-at-the-window motif as a generic depiction of the queen awaiting the arrival 
of her victorious king.

upend it, knowing his audience would recognize this motif in his description 
of Jezebel.
These three biblical scenes share the very theme that, Suter argues, the visu-
al image of the woman at the window signifies: the woman of the house looks 
out the window awaiting the triumphal return of her lord.47 They also share 
the same Hebrew wording to express this motif.48 In all three instances the 
woman’s hopes are disappointed and she suffers a negative outcome, but that 
does not mean the motif itself carried a negative connotation in the minds 
of the biblical authors; it is probably a matter of happenstance that the Bible 
includes no window scene with a happy outcome.49 However the story turned 
out, the audiences of these narratives would have caught the reference to the 
visual image in the literary depictions of it. They would have known how to vi-
sualize Sisera’s mother, or Michal, or Jezebel, looking out the window, without 
the details being spelled out. Indeed, the features of the image are described 
only in the scene involving Jezebel, when the narrator uses the motif with 
heaviest irony and therefore tells the audience just how to visualize its subject.
We know how to visualize the three women, too, because the ivories show 
us. The ivory panels carved with the motif of the woman at the window serve 
as the ground against which we may perceive the figure presented in the liter-
ary depictions of a woman awaiting the return of her victorious son or consort, 
and conversely the literary scenes serve as the ground for interpreting the fig-
ure carved in ivory. For us, the visual image is all the more important because 
the biblical narratives each present the figure of a woman whose hopes for her 
son’s or consort’s victorious return are dashed, negating the normal, positive 
connotation of the motif. Each type of source complements the other, for they 
both draw upon a common fund of imagery.
Of course we often lack complementary sources. So many motifs, stories, 
administrative records, letters, inscriptions, reliefs, and so on survive in isola-
tion, silhouetted against a vanished past. The cultural milieu in which they 
were produced has to be reconstructed if we are to understand them—but 
they are often the only clues to their cultural milieu! Therefore the process of 
reconstruction necessarily involves a theory of interpretation; it is not a ­simple 
47	
The structure of the scene is identical whatever the status of the parties (queen and king 
being simply a special case of woman and lord), though of course royal or noble status is 
indicated in both the literary and the visual instantiations of the motif.

matter of putting together a jigsaw puzzle. The metaphor of figure against 
ground seems to capture an important aspect of the relationship of a source to 
its context, and to its meaning, thus an element of interpretive theory.
Someone will ask: what use is this? We can arrive at valid interpretations—
and we do—by means of a sensible, thorough, and sensitive reading of the 
sources, without any theory to tell us how. But that is not what theory is for. It 
provides not a recipe but a concept; its purpose is not to instruct but to explain.

chapter 42
“Elementary”
Jeanette Greenfield
It is unsurprising to learn that Oscar Muscarella is a Sherlock Holmes aficio-
nado. It has long occurred to me that the intellect and reasoning of Holmes 
have an affinity with the world of archaeology. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was the 
master of the detective story and thrilling narrative, and he loved history. The 
Holmes stories demonstrate his deductive powers and his use of the semiol-
ogy of objects. Thought to be a Cambridge man, Holmes has been universally 
embraced as a detective character whose name is synonymous with deductive 
thought. Although bohemian and utterly individualistic, his successes involve 
collaboration. The centrally important friendship is with Watson, who acts as 
James Boswell did for the scholar and critic Samuel Johnson, in writing up the 
stories of his adventures and investigations, and noting the important data. 
He is the constant companion and observer and diarist. Holmes’s great eye for 
minute detail makes the difference in the outcome of numerous challenging 
cases. Seemingly remote and private, with a sometimes mordant sense of hu-
mor, he is nonetheless noble in the pursuit of a just truth. He has his own rules 
but is incorruptible. Holmes is flawed in his personal habits, but excellent in 
his work, in search of the authentic, the undoer of fakery, and zealous in mak-
ing order of the seemingly random, incomplete, and chaotic. One is drawn to 
his human qualities as well as his special gift. Above all, Holmes understands 
the contextual integrity of clues. What better model for the world of archaeol-
ogy and museums?
The atmospheric Sherlock Holmes stories that Conan Doyle so deftly wove 
in the years between 1887 and 1927 have immortalised both a man of action, 
as well as one often lost in a “brown study” (Plate 42.1).1 The great storyteller 
drew the ultimate consulting detective. One is absorbed into his solitary world 
of thought. We smell the leather armchairs, the books, the pipe tobacco, the 
English cooking of his housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, and the gas-lit ambience of 
his upstairs Baker Street home in Victorian London. Apart from the fixed ad-
dress, there are his most recognizable props: the deerstalker hat, the cape, the 
curved calabash pipe (and sometimes the long stemmed pipe), the ­violin, and 
1	 The term “brown study” is used by Watson to describe his own reverie in “The Adventure of 
the Cardboard Box,” The Strand Magazine, January 1893. See Doyle, Sherlock Holmes 2, 357.

842
the ­indispensable magnifying glass (Plate 42.2). Of course the man is real. He 
and Dr. Watson receive ladies in distress with gentle observation and ­patience. 
They listen to the victims of crime and to the constabulary, and to diplomats 
and foreign royalty, with the same aplomb. Driven by relentless curiosity, 
Holmes must understand every forensic aspect and circumstance of a case. He 
must know the exact sequence and context of past actions and the related loca-
tion of objects and clues. He must have all of the facts with nothing ­omitted or 
speculated upon. There is urgency and yet the pace of right timing. Detached, 
and yet not so. The mystery of things gnaws at him. Without the stimulating 
delight of unraveling the problem and making the discovery, he has no raison 
d’être. He will rise to the challenge and decipher any complex puzzle.
The character of Sherlock Holmes came to Doyle through the breadth of his 
interests, his training as a physician, and his work experiences, including that 
of a ship’s doctor. He had from boyhood been keen on detective stories, and 
in his own work he tried to turn this fascinating world into an exact science. 
Arthur Conan Doyle was of Irish descent, born in 1859 in Edinburgh, Scotland, 
and his early education was at a Jesuit school. This form of education provided 
structure, discipline, and methodology. Education was not regarded as purely 
intellectual instruction, as it was meant to provide for the formation of the 
whole man. Education was a preparation for life and everlasting life. It was 
intended to train a man to think. Moreover, a knowledge of Latin was indis-
pensable for the study of philosophy: it was the language of the past in religion, 
literature, philosophy, and theology.
Doyle’s early writing would eventually overtake any intended work as a phy-
sician. He published numerous short stories on a broad range of subjects in 
many journals and also historical novels. However, it was for his Holmes stories 
commencing in The Strand Magazine, published in London, that he became 
most famous. A Study in Scarlet, a novel about forced marriage, murder, and 
revenge, featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes, originally to be 
named Sherrinford Holmes.2 It set the scene for the meeting between Holmes 
and Watson, and their setting up rooms together in London at the famous and 
real address of 221B Baker Street. Doyle attributed the invention of Holmes to 
the influence of his former university teacher, Joseph Bell. He referred to the 
central tenets of deduction, inference, and observation, which he embraced in 
the character of Holmes, and which he had often heard Bell stress in his teach-
ing.3 Holmes became the champion of reasoned analysis. In “The Adventure 
of the Speckled Band,” the story of the Roylott family of Stoke Moran, Surrey,

and murder by the use of a concealed swamp adder, Dr. Watson says, “I had no 
keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, 
and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always 
founded on a logical basis, with which he unravelled the problems which were 
submitted to him.”4
In many of the stories, Holmes reveals his methods. In “The Five Orange 
Pips,” a story of a sinister and fatal inheritance, Holmes says, “The ideal reason-
er would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings, deduce 
from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results 
which would follow from it…Problems may be solved in the study which have 
baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their senses. To carry 
the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be 
able to utilize all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself 
implies…a possession of all knowledge.”5 The archaeologist and curator must 
also rely on such breadth of knowledge to unravel the mysteries that lie at the 
heart of their work.
It is the observations of Watson that give us the keenest insight into the char-
acter of Holmes the sleuth, and the other dreamy side of his character. On the 
one hand, there is Holmes, “the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal 
agent.” And yet, “In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted 
itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented [as Watson often 
thought] the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occa-
sionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme 
languor to devouring energy…he was never so truly formidable as when, for 
days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations…
Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that 
his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition.”6
Conan Doyle was a politically active person, and he often fought injustice 
by involving himself in different legal cases to champion the cause of those he 
perceived to have been wronged. A prolific writer with a driving energy, he also 
created the character of the aptly named Professor George Edward Challenger 
in his novel, The Lost World, first published in 1912. Challenger, having been 
ridiculed by the scientific establishment, goes off to Amazonian South Amer-
ica to prove his contention that dinosaurs still roamed the earth. The scien-
tific expedition visited a plateau inhabited by Jurassic monsters, Indians, and 
ape-men. In the course of their adventure, the explorers led by Challenger saw

at least a dozen creatures hitherto unknown to science. Still opposed by rival 
scientists, Challenger silences the sceptics who challenge his photographs by 
producing an actual specimen. How interesting that Doyle, who was fascinated 
with paleontology, has himself long been rumoured to have been implicated in 
the famous Piltdown paleontology hoax, which took 40 years to be exposed as 
a forgery.7 A fabricated skull was allegedly found in Sussex in 1912 by a collector, 
Charles Dawson, and presented as the fossilized remains of a previously un-
known early human. This episode would be consistent with Doyle’s position of 
throwing down the gauntlet and challenging the entrenched views of experts 
and the establishment. He was out to demonstrate the fallibility of scientific 
proof, of fads, of the so-called certainty of established beliefs.
Conan Doyle poured himself into the characters he created. He is there in 
the essence of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The power of books and writing 
were of pivotal importance to him. In the essays of Through the Magic Door, a 
literary tour of his personal library, he states, “Each cover of a true book enfolds 
the concentrated essence of a man. The personalities of the writers have faded 
into the thinnest shadows, as their bodies into impalpable dust, yet here are 
their very spirits at your command.”8 He reflects on how some books become 
entwined with a person’s life, providing enduring pleasure and instruction. 
Perhaps the character of Holmes goes even further back, to Doyle’s life as a 
schoolboy. He was much influenced by the English poet and historian, Thomas 
Babington Macaulay, the author of the bestselling History of England; he ad-
mired Macaulay’s charming gentlemanly tone, broad liberal outlook, and gen-
eral absence of bigotry and of prejudice. Do we not also recognize something 
of Macaulay in Sherlock Holmes?
Dr. John H. Watson entered the world of Holmes as his lodger. Watson 
had returned to England upon discharge after being wounded at the battle 
of Maiwand in Afghanistan. He is affable and direct, always dependable and 
forthright. He is a practicing physician, who acts as a moral lightning rod for 
Holmes’s sometimes questionable personal behaviour—in tactics Holmes em-
braces and especially with regard to his escape to cocaine. Watson is always 
the loyal comrade and biographer and the audible voice of Holmes’s sense 
of irony and conscience. He is the medium through which we come to know 
Holmes intimately. Doyle apparently lent to the character of Watson his own 
“stolid John Bull appearance,” complete with military moustache.9 Watson is 
the chronicler of every case study and hence often the narrator of the most

­famous stories. Minutiae matter to Holmes: the multitude of differences in 
types of ash and tobacco, the form and details of the hand, fingernails, calluses, 
shirt cuffs, pipes, hats, walking sticks, cigarette cases, shoes, shoelaces, the clay 
on boots, the tracing of footsteps, and so on—all reveal much to the skilled 
interpreter. No detail is unnoticed, and all invoke amazing explanations. One 
can see what Holmes makes of the walking stick left behind in his study at the 
outset of The Hound of the Baskervilles, the story of the cursed Baskerville fam-
ily. He provides a complete biography of Dr. James Mortimer, who owns the 
stick, even before meeting him. After such initial observations, as Watson says, 
there followed the seclusion and solitude necessary “in those hours of intense 
mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, 
constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up 
his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial.”10
Archaeology too presents the instant mystery. The crime writer Agatha 
Christie, who was married to the archaeologist Max Mallowan, used excava-
tions as settings for some of her stories. The legendary magic and menace of 
disappeared worlds give rise to superstitions and rumor. The tension and un-
certainty and expectation of exotic digs form a natural backdrop to the oeu-
vre of crime writing and the detective. Holmes had a need for cases that were 
strange and unusual or even fantastic. Conan Doyle’s writing dealt with the 
mysterious and seemingly inexplicable, and hinted at the supernatural. Later 
in life he became interested in spiritualism. He came to believe in life after 
death and was a member of the Ghost Club, which was founded in 1862 from 
Cambridge origins, for those interested in the paranormal. But even earlier 
there were superstitious or spiritual elements to his storytelling. In The Hound 
of the Baskervilles, Holmes refers to the fact that while pondering the story of 
Baskerville Hall and the strange unearthly beast prowling there, his body had 
spent the entire day in his armchair, and yet his spirit hovered over the moor 
all day. Still, there is always a logical explanation. In “The Lost Special,” a tale of 
the baffling and seemingly impossible disappearance of a train on its journey 
to London, the thought process invoked by Holmes is again revealed: “It is one 
of the elementary principles of practical reasoning that when the impossible 
has been eliminated the residuum, however improbable, must contain the 
truth.”11 The same may be said for the interpretation of an archaeological site.
Sherlock Holmes is a singular, serious, and moody man. His mind rebels at 
stagnation, and he abhors the dull routine of existence. In The Sign of Four, the 
story of the disappeared Captain Morstan (an Indian regiment officer) and a 
10

lost divided treasure. Holmes says “give me problems, give me work, give me 
the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my 
own proper atmosphere.” In the same story it is observed that humanity and 
science are strangely blended in Holmes.12
Holmes does not play the expected game to reach the truth. He pursues 
his passions, and he employs unexpected tactics and remains his own imper-
fect person. This fictional but true-to-life character appeals to the detective in 
everyone, and he remains real to many. Indeed, as T.S. Eliot said of Holmes, 
“when we talk of him we invariably fall into the fancy of his existence.”13 Sher-
lock Holmes endures in our minds because he is human and sometimes brittle, 
but never ordinary. As Conan Doyle has said of Holmes, his character admits 
no light or shade. However he illuminates our understanding of the darker va-
garies of human nature and society in much the same way the curator and 
archaeologist seek to illuminate our knowledge and understanding of human 
history.
The characters of Holmes and Watson epitomize the qualities of a gentle-
man. Doyle draws a picture of heroism, distinction, and nobility of pur-
pose. Holmes will always do what he thinks is right, and while being utterly 
­nonconformist, he can still command admiration and affection. His perennial 
appeal stems from the fact that although he clearly displays vulnerability he is 
also the distillation of Doyle’s notion of manliness. His principled, rather unas-
suming, and generous-hearted character has become an enduring legend. He 
is an unorthodox polymath who fights against dark forces and villainy in all its 
forms. He will contradict the police and unsettle the establishment when nec-
essary. He is also the master of great disguises. It is the cozy, book-lined Baker 
Street interior that draws us in. It is the pleasurable talk between Watson and 
Holmes that serves to lay bare the plot and methodically unravel the logic of 
the tale. Conan Doyle celebrates this intellectual conversation and the illumi-
nating power of thought. Such time well spent is one of life’s joys.

One can see why Oscar Muscarella admires Sherlock Holmes: many aspects 
of the master sleuth are reflected in Muscarella’s life and work. Although it 
would not be easy to live up to the capabilities of Holmes as problem solver, 
Muscarella is prominent in his efforts. A committed specialist and widely read 
polymath, Muscarella has unmasked a number of scholarly deceptions—and

even outright crimes—that would otherwise have remained undetected. As a 
field archaeologist and museum expert with more than 50 years’ experience, 
he has a direct forensic style regarding provenance and provenience.14 He was 
a curator and then senior research fellow in the Department of Ancient Near 
Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art until his retirement in 2010. 
Muscarella started in the field in the 1950s, excavating the important native 
American sites of Mesa Verde, Colorado, and Swan Creek in South Dakota. He 
took his doctorate in Classical Archaeology at the University of Pennsylvania. 
In the 1960s he directed excavations in Iran at Hasanlu, Agrab Tepe, Sé Girdan, 
and Dinkha Tepe, also working for one season at Nushi-i Jan. In Turkey in the 
1950’s he excavated at the former Phrygian capital of Gordion near present day 
Ankara, and, after that, at Alişar, Ayanis, and Çadır Höyük. His association with 
Professor Rodney Young, the director of excavations at Gordion, was especially 
important to him, and he continues to be involved in the interpretation of this 
site. As an excavator, Muscarella was a careful observer who kept meticulous 
notebooks and made his own archaeological illustrations. As a scholar, he is a 
rigorous thinker who bases his conclusions on a broad collection of data, close 
inspection of objects, and special attention to context, in a manner befitting 
a master detective. In the same way that not all of Holmes’s cases lead to the 
most perfect denouement, Muscarella’s work has not always established the 
irrefutable truth as to authenticity or provenience. However his uncompromis-
ing efforts to influence standards puts one in mind of the words of the play-
wright George Bernard Shaw (who incidentally was a friend of Conan Doyle), 
“beware of false knowledge, for it is more dangerous than ignorance.”
Of Muscarella’s many influential publications, one of the most provocative 
is The Lie Became Great: The Forgery of Ancient Near Eastern Cultures (2000), a 
discussion of the plundering of ancient Near Eastern sites, the resulting mar-
ket for forged artifacts, and the devastating effect of the “forgery culture” on 
our understanding of antiquity. He is credited with influencing organizations 
such as the Archaeological Institute of America and the International Council 
of Museums in establishing improved standards with regard to provenance. He 
has lectured widely in America, Europe, and the Middle East, and he contin-
ues to conduct safe tours at the Metropolitan Museum in his own inimitable 
manner.15

The term “provenance” refers to the history of ownership or possession of an object; “pro-

However, more than once, he has been sidelined by the practitioners of 
what he calls the “Plunder Culture.”16 Years ago, Muscarella was fired from his 
position at the Metropolitan Museum as a result of his opposition to the acqui-
sition of the famous Greek Euphronios vase. This was verifiably stolen from an 
Etruscan tomb in Italy, purchased by the Metropolitan Museum in 1972, and ul-
timately returned to Italy in 2008. Such episodes have not diminished the unre-
lenting spirit in which he has pursued his cause of condemning the acceptance 
of undocumented antiquities, a practice that has fueled the illicit excavation 
of sites. As far as Muscarella is concerned, there is no justification in using un-
excavated artifacts to construct interpretations of Near Eastern cultures—this 
practice creates false knowledge, and corrupts scholarship and museums. In 
his view, no unexcavated object can be assumed to be ancient without proof, 
and there are numerous examples of problematic pieces on display in famous 
museums. To refer to just one example out of many, he cites a clay plaque of a 
frontal nude goddess, sculpted in high relief, which was bought by the British 
Museum in 2003 to mark the museum’s 250th Anniversary.17 Originally it was 
called the Burney Relief after a former owner, Sydney Burney, a London antiq-
uities and art collector, known primarily as a dealer in modern art.18 Following 
its purchase by the British Museum, the director gave it the more sensuous 
title, “Queen of the Night” (Plate 42.3).19
The plaque has been identified as Old Babylonian (ca. 1850–1750 b.c.),20 
despite the fact that, as Muscarella puts it, “it was born in the bazaar, and not 
excavated.”21 The naked female stands on a lion with another sitting behind 
it, and the central figures are flanked by two giant owls. The plaque was the 
subject of a detailed study by Pauline Albenda, who noted many anomalies in 
terms of subject matter and composition.22 Among these are the owls, which 
are otherwise not known in ancient Near Eastern art. Based on her observa-
tions of the minute details of its crafted features, contradictions are apparent 
in the iconographic imagery, and Albenda infers that the plaque is most prob-
ably a forgery. She uses the words pastiche and caricature. The plaque was test-
ed by thermoluminescence, with samples taken from the rear and front, but

not from the body of the goddess. Therefore it is possible that there may have 
been modern additions to an ancient terracotta plaque. There are differing 
views based on detailed arguments as to the symbolic features of the plaque, 
and such cases cannot be always decided with absolute certainty. Muscarella, 
however, concludes in this case that “the plaque is not manifestly ancient.”23
Although the subject of forgeries is not clear-cut, it is evident that there 
are many different grades of forgery and that the practice is widespread. Even 
more damaging to archaeological study is the false attribution of findspots for 
plundered but genuine antiquities. This breaks the historic link with the ob-
jects’ original sites. The problem is sometimes exacerbated by the grouping 
of individual objects into a “hoard,” said to have been found as a coherent as-
semblage, but without real evidence. Finally, genuine but plain artifacts may 
be embellished to increase their appeal to collectors; the “Queen of the Night” 
is one such candidate. The authenticity of unexcavated objects must ipso facto 
be regarded with suspicion. In Muscarella’s opinion, the cultural history of the 
Near East in particular has been misrepresented.
Cast as something of a lone voice, as was Sherlock Holmes, Muscarella has 
incautiously spoken out, pointing the finger at museum officials, scholars, pri-
vate collectors, popular and academic journals, and major universities, when 
they have been guilty of unethical practices. He is especially scathing regard-
ing the activities of wealthy collectors who are virtually unobstructed in their 
participation in the destruction of the world’s cultural heritage. He has shaken 
the complacency of art historians, pointing out how some scholars publish un-
excavated objects, accompanied by spurious explanations of their history. As 
both archaeologist and museum insider, Muscarella is a uniquely placed critic, 
one who has made the public aware of the workings of museums and their 
exhibition practices. Those familiar with his work will realize that they may 
be viewing fake objects in museum displays, and that they may also be read-
ing labels with speculative explanations or invented narratives. The charisma 
of artifacts may be fabricated and the language of euphemism applied for the 
sake of the show. Muscarella has witheringly pointed out that when an object 
is “said to be from” a particular site or region, it is actually “unexcavated”—and 
therefore plundered. A significant way to impede and prevent looting is to stop 
the acquisition of such unexcavated works.
It is now generally perceived that there is an ethical divide between dealers, 
collectors, and museums on the one side, and academics and archaeologists 
on the other, over the destruction of context that results from the looting of 
sites. Both collectors and museums argue that their work at least preserves the

artifacts for posterity. However, turning a blind eye to the absence of archaeo-
logical provenience irretrievably destroys the possibility of preserving both 
artifacts and historical knowledge. Without an accurate understanding of the 
context of an ancient object, one cannot understand its history—and without 
its history, the object loses a crucial part of its essence. Museums that acquire 
such objects do not serve to educate but become mere galleries for display. 
Museums cease to be the guaranteed keepers of authentic history or cultural 
certainty.
The stories surrounding many important objects are no less extraordinary, 
improbable, or convoluted than a Sherlock Holmes mystery. In Edmund de 
Waal’s evocative and engaging family history about the journey and survival 
of a private family collection of ivory netsuke, The Hare with Amber Eyes, he 
reveals how objects engage us intimately—it is the sheer survivability of vul-
nerable man-made objects (and sometimes their owners) and the stories that 
they convey.24 It is their tactile quality. Some objects retain the pulse of their 
making. The story behind the object irrespective of size is like a thing that also 
has a patina. Without the accompanying human story something vital is lost.
In the past 30 years many museums have been confronted with the evidence 
of plundered objects held in their collections. They have been forced to recog-
nize the lost story and historic context of the artifacts and the illegitimacy of 
their continued possession. There have been notable political and legal chal-
lenges to major institutions by states and individuals. These events and out-
comes relating to provenance and provenience have vindicated Muscarella’s 
stand. The result has been the development of the precedents and internation-
al practice of cultural repatriation.25 The tenure, authenticity, or legitimacy of 
collections can no longer be taken for granted. No supposed universal quality 
or infallible authority of a museum can stem the scrutiny now leveled at ob-
jects whose acquisition was questionable or obscure. A number of museums 
have been forced to do a volte-face.
Many archaeologically rich countries that have long been the home of im-
portant finds and the source of significant artifacts appearing on the art market 
have become more conscious of the deprivation to their cultural heritage. Tur-
key, for example, has been active in making claims for return. In recent years, 
Turkey has continued to make claims—against the J. Paul Getty Museum, the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and Harvard Uni-
versity’s Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, d.c.

An earlier high-profile case involving Turkey was that of the “Lydian Hoard” 
held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This “hoard” consisted of 363 items: 
fragments of wall paintings, marble sphinxes, gold, silver, and bronze vessels, 
and jewelry of gold, silver, and glass.26 In 1987, Turkey filed suit to reclaim the 
Lydian Hoard (also called the “Croesus Gold”) from the museum.27 The objects 
had been illicitly removed from several tombs in the Uşak region of Turkey in 
the 1960’s. The chairman of the Department of Greek and Roman Art of the 
museum purchased the significant collection from an international antiqui-
ties dealer between 1966 and 1980. Many items were moved to the museum’s 
basement, while others were displayed without provenance and mixed in with 
objects from other sources. In 1984, 55 objects were put on “permanent exhibi-
tion” at the museum and called the “East Greek Treasure.”28 It was this display 
that finally exposed the existence of an identifiable collection. In 1986, a for-
mal request from Turkey under its cultural patrimony laws was rejected by the 
Metropolitan Museum. In 1987, Turkey initiated legal action in New York Dis-
trict Court,29 claiming over 200 items including gold and silver jewelry, wine 
jugs, bowls, and incense burners. Although the museum continued to deny the 
existence of an identifiable and cohesive collection, it was confronted in the 
court case with evidence of the original clandestine removal. The disclosure of 
the minutes of the museum’s Acquisitions Committee of the Board of Trustees 
revealed that some museum staff had been aware of the illicit nature of the 
collection: the museum knew that the objects came from western Anatolia. 
The museum had succeeded in keeping and exhibiting the plundered treasure 
for decades.
In 1993, an out-of-court agreement was reached, and the museum made an 
unprecedented return of the objects to Turkey. However the subsequent fate of 
an important item from the treasure, the famous gold hippocampus (a mythi-
cal winged sea horse), reveals how the waters of cultural return can easily be-
come muddied by the conduct of a few (Plate 42.4). After being returned by 
the Metropolitan Museum, the hippocampus was displayed for two years in 
the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. It was then transferred to 
a small museum in Uşak, in order to display it close to the source of the find.

This transfer would remain an ongoing issue within the Turkish archaeological 
community. From the Uşak Archaeological Museum, the gold hippocampus 
was stolen and replaced with a counterfeit (Plate 42.5); the original was found 
to be missing in 2006.30 Kazım Akbıyıkoğlu, an archaeologist and director of 
the Uşak Archaeological Museum, was implicated. He had fought for many 
years alongside American lawyers Larry Kaye and Howard Spiegler, who repre-
sented Turkey its successful suit for the return of the treasures from New York. 
Despite an attempt to argue that not all the objects returned were the originals, 
Akbıyıkoğlu was found guilty in 2009. One theft had—in a painful twist—com-
pounded another. Redressing the issue of the provenance of objects has thus 
not always guaranteed their ultimate preservation for scholarship or history. 
However, in an uplifting turn in this cultural saga, the hippocampus was found 
again in Germany in 2012. It was returned to Turkey and placed on prominent 
display in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara. The object was too 
famous for collectors to risk acquisition, and the Turks never gave up.
...
In the United States significant legal precedents have evolved, dealing with sto-
len art and looted archaeological artifacts. Museums have increasingly found 
themselves at the center of litigation in disputes over the derivation and pas-
sage of objects. The era of no questions being asked is over. Italy and Greece 
have entered into agreements with several major museums such as the Met-
ropolitan Museum of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Museum of Fine 
Arts in Boston, laying down the criteria for return in situations involving dubi-
ous provenance.
The bottom line for the provenance issue comes down to the survivability 
of objects. The great masterpieces created by ancient artists and craftsmen 
that speak so eloquently to us should be saved for history and learning and 
common appreciation. There should be no loss of perspective in accusations 
made against the conduct of museums. The provenance issue is not always 
clear-cut and is not purely scientific. Apart from cases of direct collusion to 
plunder or immediate awareness of fake attribution, or of knowingly receiv-
ing stolen property, the role of museums may be more complex and subtle 
than supposed. It could be that sometimes museums may necessarily be the 
safest sanctuary for certain orphan objects until more can be known about 
them. The Cleveland Museum of Art has, for instance, decided to use its discre-
tion to make exceptions to acquisition guidelines—and it is not alone. How far

must museums go in exercising due diligence and investigating objects? How 
much evidence is necessary and feasible to be acquired? There is an aesthetic 
issue as well as contextual one. It has been advocated by archaeologists that 
where there is any doubt about archaeological context, museums should adopt 
a higher standard of care than others and refrain from acquisition.31 This is in 
line with the International Council of Museums Code of Ethics.32 The code 
also advocates that museums adopt a written collections policy, which has not 
always been adhered to. It has also been urged that provenance be researched 
to result in documentary proof, which may prove to be unattainable. On the 
other hand, any suggestion, such as that of the Association of Art Museum 
Directors, that there be a time limit beyond which proof of provenance is not 
the paramount consideration clearly undermines this standard.33 Part of the 
solution is enforced transparency in museum practice.
These new measures being applied to museum acquisitions have caused 
alarm and adverse reaction among some museum officials, and certain mu-
seums have found it difficult to continue adding to their already vast collec-
tions in the same manner as in the past. James Cuno, President and ceo of the 
J. Paul Getty Trust, has addressed this matter in his book, Who Owns Antiquity? 
His very title conflates the ideas of “antiquities” and “antiquity.” He avoids the 
matter of objects by referring instead to “antiquity” and the early history of the 
world. The immediate conclusion must be that of course “antiquity” belongs to 
and is “owned” by everybody. Who would disagree with that? Cuno character-
izes the laws of artifact-rich nations to protect or retrieve their cultural patri-
mony as nationalist, retentionist, and proprietary. He counters with arguments 
that are requisionist in tone. In his view, national cultural protection laws are 
politically driven; archaeologists should join forces with museums against 
such retentionist states. Their laws are ill motivated and, in his opinion, do not 
effectively protect archaeological sites—such nations are not always the best 
owners. Cuno embarks upon a form of cultural revisionism that calls for the re-
vival of the system of “partage,” under which archaeologists led excavations at 
foreign sites and shared the finds with the host country. This harks back to the 
era of unequal treaties and is anachronistic. Many archaeologically rich coun-
tries have since evolved in autonomy, awareness, and expertise. The tide has

turned against cultural amnesia. When these nations now restrict expeditions 
to their own territory, this is astonishingly referred to as cultural blackmail.
Cuno and other museum administrators such as Neil MacGregor, former 
director of the British Museum, have pursued the rebranding of their insti-
tutions as encyclopedic, universal, cosmopolitan, and intended for the world 
citizen—and therefore having a superior entitlement to the ownership of 
cultural objects from across the globe. Such museums are meant to represent 
diversity and enlightenment; according to this stance, geography becomes ir-
relevant for the purposes of cultural protection, and sovereignty should be dis-
solved. The great museums like the Louvre or the British Museum, it is said, 
are the world under one roof and not national at all. Where “antiquities” are 
concerned, we should live in a borderless world of accessible artifacts. This is 
the argument made against international conventions, the laws of individual 
states, and indeed the rule of law, which are said to politicize artifact acquisi-
tion. Cuno questions the ownership of cultural artifacts of source countries 
such as Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Iraq, and challenges their right to protect or 
retrieve them. Arguments are made against the purchase back of previously 
looted objects by asking whether the purchasing countries—which are mod-
ern state successors to the ancient territories—are the “real” owners. It may 
be especially galling that such states now have the means to buy back stolen 
treasures, although it is true that this has often skewed the market because of 
the incredible and questionable sums sometimes involved.
Cuno ignores the central issue of theft and plunder, and insists on the com-
modification of artifacts, which he argues should flow freely. Special attention 
is given in his book to China as one of the richest source nations, particularly 
in response to the 2009 Sino-American bilateral agreement that restricts the 
import of a wide range of Chinese artifacts in order to obstruct their illicit 
traffic.34 Cuno sweepingly reinterprets ethnic and tribal history and issues of 
identity in order to delegitimize the authority of the state to legislate regard-
ing its cultural heritage. The New World museum administrator simplifies the 
complexity and richness of a profound civilization stretching back over thou-
sands of years. In one example of many, he questions, remarkably, whether the 
Buddhist treasures of Dunhuang are really Chinese. He reasons that for many 
centuries the political authority of China did not extend as far as Dunhuang, 
and that there is evidence in that region of Tibetan, Uighur, and Khotanese

­cultures in addition to that of the Han Chinese.35 He neglects to mention, 
among other omissions, that the ninth-century Dunhuang Diamond Sutra, the 
influential Buddhist scroll and earliest surviving printed book (which Aurel 
Stein removed to the British Museum) was written in Chinese. Thousands of 
other Chinese manuscripts were also removed from Dunhuang.
The Cuno theories reflect a darker side of museum life. Such viewpoints in-
creasingly reflect the desperate argument to eliminate basic issues of context 
and to justify requisitionist attitudes. It is clear that even if the constraints on 
modern museums do not directly prevent archaeological looting, there will be 
less encouragement from that quarter. The whitewash of past museum prac-
tice carries no weight, and the tide has turned in favor of a cultural conscience. 
It has been reported that most museums will now not receive objects even as 
gifts if they lack satisfactory provenance.36 Museums require a documented 
history going back at least before 1970, the date set by the Association of Art 
Museum Directors, which reflects the date of the 1970 unesco Convention 
against the illicit traffic of cultural property.37 Museums are increasingly moti-
vated to preserve history and temper their acquisitions policy when it is clear 
at the outset that a questionable acquisition will likely result in restitution. In 
the altered acquisitions climate, archaeologists, museum directors, and art law 
attorneys will engage in the kinds of stringent provenance investigations that 
have long been advocated by Oscar Muscarella. Increasingly, they have had 
to apply Sherlockian methods to newly emerged objects in order to evaluate 
provenance on the balance of probabilities. Events have shown that there can 
be a rewarding confluence of discovery, conservation, scholarship, and exhibi-
tion. The museum as scholarly detective and interpreter of the cultural spirit 
that inspired the objects is the ideal. Museums must now follow, with greater 
satisfaction, the exhortation of Sherlock Holmes’s elder brother Mycroft38 
to“leave no stone unturned”!
