The current temperature of all known black dwarfs [17.04.2021 (the maximal magnitude for 
earth-bound telescopes is 24; for Hubble it is 26); 19.04.2021 (minimal age of BDs); 24.04.2021 
(13 black dwarfs); 25.04.2021 (designation search: 24 WDs with invisible partner; 3 with visible); 
11.05.2021 (precise temperature of all but four BD); 12.05.2021 (accounting for shedding of mass); 
22.05.2021 (quintic equation gives correct result)] 
 
In our white dwarf survey the oldest white dwarf we found was J1612-1639, with an age of 35.7 
trillion years. That is somewhat close to the full age of the post-decoupling universe, our famous 
42 trillion years. However, this gap of 6.3 trillion years demands an explanation. We have to ask 
ourselves why we do not find white dwarfs that are even older than 35.7 trillion years.  
 
One rather obvious answer to that is this: white dwarfs that are even older must be invisible by 
now. In other words, they must have turned into black dwarfs.  
 
Similar to stellar black holes, black dwarfs can only be spotted when they are part of a double star 
system and have a visible companion. The orbital motion of the visible star then allows us to derive 
the mass of the invisible companion. When that mass is smaller than the Chandrasekhar limit of 
1.4 sun masses (originally predicted to be  1.3 𝑀☉) and larger than the minimal mass for hydrogen 
fusion, namely 0.075 𝑀☉, then we can be sure that it is a white dwarf that is not bright enough to 
be seen by current telescopes.  
 
In this book we shall use a rather pragmatic definition for a black dwarf. It shall be any white dwarf 
that has cooled down to a temperature at which it can no longer be detected. Of course, regular 
white dwarfs at very high distances can also not be detected. It is better to put numbers to our 
definition. In the last chapter we found 53 white dwarfs with temperatures of at or below 4,000 
Kelvin. The white dwarf with the lowest temperature were:

We want black dwarfs to be colder than the coldest known white dwarfs, and so a reasonable 
definition for a black dwarf is a white dwarf that has cooled below 1,000 Kelvin. We may then 
call those white dwarfs that are only below 4,000 Kelvin ‘semi-black dwarfs’. Black dwarfs that 
are below 1,000 Kelvin we can call ‘end-stage black dwarfs’.  
 
Usually black dwarf companions to visible stars are simply called ‘invisible companions’. It is too 
troubling to call them by name, because black dwarfs are not supposed to exist in a young universe. 
An internet search using the terms ‘invisible companion’ and ‘white dwarf’, reveals a total of 16 
black dwarf candidates.  
 
 
We can use their mass to predict their radius, according to this formula:1, 2

Different telescopes have different limiting magnitudes. The earth bound telescope with the highest 
limiting magnitude is the Pan-STARRS, which is at 24 . The Hubble telescope has a limiting 
magnitude of 31. However, this is only a theoretical value, as the actual limiting magnitude always 
depends on exposure time as well, and requires to know what one is looking for.  
This is the number of white dwarfs we find at different magnitudes:

Based on this we can assume that currently 26 is the pragmatic limiting magnitude of the Hubble 
telescope.  
 
By assuming that our black dwarf candidates are just slightly above that limiting magnitude, we

Obviously white dwarfs that are far away can be invisible even at considerable temperatures. 
Therefore we cannot expect any of these minimal lifetimes to be anywhere close to the age of the 
universe.  

 
We can therefore not get closer to the full age of the universe by looking at black dwarfs. On 
second thought, that was never a realistic prospect, because considering how unlikely and rare 
gravitational capturing between stars is, it is to be assumed that in the majority of double star 
systems the two stars have formed at the same time, and so their age should be identical.  
 
We therefore know the age of each of these double star systems. We also know the pre-white dwarf 
time of the invisible companion, because that depends only on its mass, and that is known. And so 
the cooling time of the invisible companion is given by:  
 
𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑙= 𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝑡𝑝𝑟𝑒−𝑊𝐷 
 
𝑡𝑝𝑟𝑒−𝑊𝐷 = (𝑀☉
𝑀)
3
 × 1010 [yr] 
 
As we already saw in the last chapter, the cooling time can be approximated by:  
 
𝑡𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑙 = 𝑁 𝑘 ∆𝑇
𝑙
 
 
∆𝑇  is again the temperature drop, which we know is given by the initial temperature 𝑇𝑖=
100,000 K minus the present temperature 𝑇0. We expand ∆𝑇 accordingly, and solve for 𝑇0: 
 
𝑡 = 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑇𝑖− 𝑇0)
𝑙
 
 
𝑡 𝑙
𝑁 𝑘 = 𝑇𝑖− 𝑇0 
 
𝑡 𝑙
𝑁 𝑘 − 𝑇𝑖 = − 𝑇0 
 
𝑇0  = 𝑇𝑖 − 𝑡 𝑙
𝑁 𝑘 
 
We have two unknowns here. The present temperature 𝑇0 and the present luminosity 𝑙. However, 
the luminosity depends on the temperature and is given by:  
 
𝑙
𝑙☉
 = ( 𝑅
𝑅☉
)
2
 × (𝑇0
𝑇☉
)
4
 
 
We can use this to expand 𝑙 in our equation for 𝑇0, and bring it into the general quintic form:  
 
𝑇0  = 𝑇𝑖 − 𝑡 𝑙☉ 𝑅2 𝑇0
4
𝑁 𝑘 𝑅☉
2  𝑇☉
4 

 
𝑡 𝑙☉ 𝑅2
𝑁 𝑘 𝑅☉
2  𝑇☉
4 𝑇0
4  + 𝑇0 − 𝑇𝑖 =  0 
 
For simplicity we replace everything in front of 𝑇0
4 by a simple ‘𝑎’:  
 
𝑎 𝑇0
4 + 𝑇0 − 𝑇𝑖 =  0 
 
Quintic equations have only approximate solutions. The general approximation is:  
 
𝑇0  ≈ 1
2 √𝐵 − 𝐴 + 
2
𝑇𝑖 √𝐴 − 𝐵
− 1
2 √𝐴 − 𝐵 
 
Wherein:  
 
𝐴 = 
√√3 √256 𝑎3 𝑇𝑖
3 + 27 𝑎2 + 9 𝑎
3
√2
3
 3
2
3 𝑎
 
 
And:  
 
𝐵 = 
4 √2
3
3
 𝑇𝑖
√√3 √256 𝑎3 𝑇𝑖
3  +  27 𝑎2  +  9 𝑎
3
 
 
Calculating all these terms is quite a lot of work, so we simply computer ‘𝑎’ and let Wolfram do 
the work. We shall start with the invisible companion of J0822+2753. For this black dwarf we get:  
 
𝑎=  0.00000034528864 
 
𝑇0  ≈ 732.245 K 
 
How good is this approximation? We can try to find a more exact solution by trying out different 
values for 𝑇0 in our intial equation:  
 
𝑇0  = 𝑇𝑖 − 𝑡 𝑙☉ 𝑅2 𝑇0
4
𝑁 𝑘 𝑅☉
2  𝑇☉
4 
 
We find that the equation is fulfilled when entering the value:  
 
𝑇0  =  742 K 

 
We can do this with all our black dwarfs, and that leads to the following temperatures:

All of these temperatures are below the maximal possible temperatures we calculated before, 
which indicates that our results here are most likely quite accurate.  
 
For four of these invisible partners it is not possible to calculate most likely temperatures. In the 
case of the invisible partner of PSR J2222-0137 that is not possible because PSR J2222-0137 is a 
pulsar, and it currently not possible to estimate the age of a pulsar, because they are too small to 
see, having a diameter of only about 20 km. All we usually see of a pulsar is its jets, which come 
from ionized particles that collide at the magnetic poles of a pulsar. In the future we could attempt 
to estimate the age of pulsars by looking at how they lose angular momentum over time.  
 
The other three invisible companions, PG 0824+289-b, HD 49798-b and HE 1047-0436-b have 
no most likely temperatures because they are slightly lighter than their visible counterpart (the ‘b’ 
indicates that it is the invisible companion), and so in theory it should be their visible counterparts 
that should be the invisible ones. Possible explanations are that there was either some mass transfer 
between them, or that these double star systems formed through rarely occurring gravitational 
capturing. In a universe that is very old, gravitational capturing between stars, which is thought of 
as a very rare and unlikely event, suddenly becomes quite a bit more likely.  
 

In our above list we have two semi-black dwarfs (𝑇 >  1,000 K), which we may also classify as 
very cold white dwarfs, namely HD 188112-b and PTF1 J0823+0819-b. Both of them have good 
chances of being observed directly very soon, as their apparent magnitudes are only one order of 
magnitude above the apparent magnitude of them faintest ever observed white dwarf (𝑀 =  26).  
 
Far more interesting however it is to observe an actual black dwarf, and a real and realistic chance 
for that exists with HD 188112-b. This black dwarf is at a very accessible apparent magnitude of 
26.38. If observed, it would immediately become the coldest ever observed ‘white dwarf’ and the 
first directly observed black dwarf. With its incredibly low temperature of 882 Kelvin it would 
give the standard model of cosmology yet another death blow.  
 
Accounting for the shedding of mass 
 
In our white dwarf survey in the last chapter we did not account for the shedding of mass during 
the formation of a white dwarf. That was because we were only interested in the oldest white 
dwarfs, and the oldest white dwarfs are usually the least massive ones. For those there is no 
shedding of mass at all.  
 
Here we are however dealing with quite a few that are massive enough to have mass shedding 
during their formation.  
 
In a paper about exoplanets, John Debes mentions a theoretic initial to final mass fuction,17 which 
is:  
 
𝑀𝑖= 10.4 ln[(𝑀𝑊𝐷𝑀☉
⁄
) 0.49
⁄
] 𝑀☉ 
 
Using this formula we get negative initial masses for any final mass below 0.49 sun masses. There 
is no mass shedding under 0.52 sun masses. From the last chapter we know that there is no mass 
shedding at all below 0.25 sun masses, and very little between 0.25 and 0.5.  
 
Another group of astronomers from Spain has looked at a collection of 62 empirical initial-to-final 
mass pairs, and found the following initial-to-final mass function:18  
 
𝑀𝑓 =  0.117 𝑀𝑖+ 0.384 
 
Which means the initial mass is given by:  
 
𝑀𝑖 = 𝑀𝑓 − 0.384
0.117
 
 
According to this function there is no mass shedding for masses of less than 0.44. This is a more 
reasonable lower limit than the above 0.52 sun masses.  
 
Now we can re-calculate the age of those visible companions that have masses that are above 0.44 
and which are lighter than their invisible black dwarf companions:  
 

Designation

0.56410256

29.03 
 
Their age estimates without accounting for the shedding of mass were 28 billion years and 110 
billion years. With mass shedding the first of these two dropped even below the GR-age of the 
universe.  
 
The above result puts WD 0107-342-b at an apparent magnitude at which it could be observable 
with todays telescopes. Automated star surveys are usually performed at magnitudes of around 
20.19, 20  
 
Among earth bound telescopes the only one which performs surveys with higher limiting 
magnitudes is the Pan-STARRS, which has a limiting magnitude of 24.21  
With 24.89，WD 0107-342-b would be beyond that. This means only a space-based telescope, 
like the Hubble telescope could potentially observe WD 0107-342-b.  
 
It has to be stressed however, that age estimates of white dwarfs or black dwarfs that have 
undergone mass shedding during their formation cannot be very accurate. We can see that already 
from the fact that there are competing initial-to-final mass functions to mimic the observed mass 
shedding. The first function performs very poorly when applied to the data sample the second one 
was based on. In the 0.54 to 0.79 mass range, only 28% have a one digit agreement. Outside of 
this mass range there is no agreement at all.  
 
While we may expect the second function to perform better, there is not much of a guarantee for 
that. So until there are more accurate initial-to-final mass functions, we cannot be sure about what 
the most likely temperatures of WD 0107-342-b and PTF1 J0823+0819-b are.  
 
Other potential black dwarfs 
 
The above discussed 16 black dwarfs are invisible companions that have been discussed in the 
literature. However, if the universe is 42 trillion years old, and 90% of it consists of star remnants 
that have either already burned out or collapsed to black holes, then shouldn’t also 90% of the 
companions of white dwarfs be invisible companions?  
 
We can attempt to find that out by going to the Montreal White Dwarf database and searching for 
white dwarfs with “a” or “b” in their designation. We can then look if they have a partner or not.

In the above list we find 24 white dwarfs with invisible partners and only 3 with visible partners. 
That means 24 out of 27 double star systems contain invisible companions. That is 89%, which 
is very close to the percentage of invisible matter in our galaxy, namly about 90%.  
 
Of course only white dwarfs that exhibit indications of the presence of a companion get an ‘a’ or 
a ‘b’ added to their designation, and even then not necessarily.  
If more than half of ordinary stars have companions,22 then so should white dwarfs. If we do not 
see them, it means they must already be invisible.
