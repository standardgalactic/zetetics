PREFACE.
The novel views
in
this
little work respecting sub-
aqueous
vision, air lenses, and visual accommodation
were
first
promulgated
in two
pamphlets,
entitled,
' Notes
on
the
Dioptrics
of
Vision,'
and
' The
Mechanism
of Accommodation,'
published
in
1 87
and
1872.
They
were
also
explained
in
lectures
delivered in 1871 before the Sunday Lecture Society
and
in 1872 at the Sunday Evenings for the People.
Again,
in August
1872, the Author read a paper
at
the
meeting
of
the
International Ophthalmological
Congress respecting his views
on the mechanism of
accommodation, which
is published
in
the Transac-
tions of the Congress.
Since the date of these publi-
cations and lectures, further experiments and observa-
tions by the Author himself and by some continental
physiologists have confirmed the
correctness of the
views
he
originally, put
fomard
respecting
the

vi
Preface.
mechanism
of
visual accommodation, and
as
these
views have excited some interest both in this country
and
in Germany,
the Author has been induced
to
write
a
more
complete
treatise
on the
optics
of
vision
in
plain
and
untechnical
language, so
as
to
enable those not conversant with
optical
science to
understand
this
important
and
interesting
subject.
The Author believes that a popular method of treat-
ment
of
his
subject
is
perfectly
compatible
with
scientific
accuracy.
In
the
special
optical part
of
this
treatise he has confined himself to those
optical
facts
and
principles
which
have
a
direct bearing
on the optics of the eye.
The
Author
has
limited
himself
strictly
to
his
subject, which is the optical construction of the normal
human eye.
The reader will therefore not expect to
find a full account in this small volume of those large
subjects the physiology, anatomy,
histology,
patho-
logy, and
comparative anatomy of the
eye,
each of
which would
require a large book for its proper treat-
ment, and could hardly form the theme of a popular
treatise.

THE HUMAN EYE
;
ITS
OPTICAL CONSTRUCTION.
I. The human
eye
is
an
optical
instrument
of
a
peculiar and complex character, differing in some im-
portant respects from any of the optical instruments
with which we are familiar, but yet resenibling some
of these instruments
in the general principles of
its
construction.
2.
Optical instruments
are of various kinds, from
the
simple lens
familiar to
all
in the spectacles we
wear in our old age and the burning glass we played
with
in our childhood,
to the complicated arrange-
ment of lenses, diaphragms, chambers and screens in
our compound microscopes, our
refracting telescopes
and
our
photographic
cameras.
All
these
optical
instruments have one feature in common, namely, the
lens.
B

2
The Httman Eye ;
its Optical Construction.
3. A lens
is
a transparent body of peculiar shape,
which
possesses
the
propertj'-
of
refracting
rays
of
light passing through
it, that
is
to say, of deflecting
them
in certain directions, according to its shape and
refractive power.
4,
In order to understand the nature and properties
of a lens,
it will be necessary to explain what is meant
by the refraction of light.
When a ray of light from a transparent rnedium of
a certain refractive power impinges perpendicularly on
a transparent medium of a different refractive power,
it
passes
through
without
deflexion, but
if
it
im-
pinges on this second medium obliquely, it is deflected
from its original course and proceeds onward through
the second medium in a new direction.
The amount
of divergence from
its original course will depend on
two things.
First, the degree of obliquity with which
the
ray
strikes
the
second medium
;
second,
the
difference
betwixt
the
refractive power of the
first
and the second medium.*
*
Refraction is now usually explained to be caused by a retardation
of the velocity of the vibrations of the ray of light, by the obstacles
presented to
its
free passage through a so-called refractive medium.
The phenomena of the spectrum are held to be due to this retarding
effect acting with more or less power on the different coloured rays of
which white light
is composed.
I have not thought
it desirable or
necessary
to
enter into
fuller
details on the
subject of the cause of
refraction.
We have only to do here with the effects.

Refraction of Light.

Fig.
I represents the refraction of a ray of light
through a transparent substance with
parallel
sides.
When the light A, from a
less
refractive medium M,
falls perpendicularly to the surface X Y of the more
refractive medium X Z,
it
passes

medium
to
the
opposite
side O without
being
de-
flected.
When
it now
passes,
still
perpendicularly,
into the
less
refractive medium M,
it continues the
same
course
without
deflexion,
so
that
the ray
of
light from A to C
is perfectly straight.
6. But if the ray of light D strike the surface of the
more refractive medium obliquely,
it will not traverse
it
in the straight course D E, but will be deflected or

drawn towards the perpendicular B O, and
strike the
opposite surface
at
F.
On emerging
into
the
less
refractive medium M, which
it
enters
obliquely,
it
will be deflected away from the perpendicular O C, in
the direction F G, parallel to the direction of its
inci-
dence D B.
7. Hence the rule of refraction may be stated thus
:
A ray of light entering a more refractive transparent
medium from
a
less
refractive transparent medium
obliquely,
is deflected towards the perpendicular
; but
if
it passes obliquely from a more refractive medium
into
a
less
refractive medium,
it
is
deflected away
from the perpendicular.
8. All
transparent
media
possess
the
refractive
power
;
fluids and solids have a much higher refrac-
tive power
than
gases,
but many
fluids
possess a
higher
refractive
power
than some
solids.
Thus,
carbon
sulphide and
oil of
cassia possess a greater
refractive power than
plate and crown
glass.
The
diamond has nearly the highest
refractive power of
any
transparent
substance,
and
it
is
this property
that imparts
to
it
its
peculiar
brilliancy.
The
re-
fractive
power
of
a
transparent
substance
is
not
always
in proportion to
its
density. A high degree
of refractive power has been supposed to
indicate a
great degree of combustibility, and Sir Isaac Newton

Refraction of the Atmosphere.
5
inferred the combustibility of the diamond from
its
remarkable refractive power.
9. Our atmosphere possesses a considerable degree
of
refractive power,
a
circumstance
well known
to
astronomers.
It
is only when they are in the zenith,
that is to say, perpendicularly above us, that the stars
are seen in their true positions
;
as they approach the
horizon the rays of light from them are
deflected by
the atmosphere.
It
is
this
refractive power
of our
atmosphere
that
enables
us to see the sun several
minutes
before
it
rises
and
after
it
sets.

But in spite
of
the
considerable
refractive power
of the
earth's
atmosphere compared with that of interstellar space,
the
air being the
least
refractive
of the transparent
media
in which our optical instruments are
used,
is
regarded as unity in calculating the refractive powers
of
other
transparent
media
employed
for
optical
purposes.
10. The
refractive
properties
of
transparent sub-
stances have been taken advantage of for constructing
instruments, called lenses, by means of which the rays
of light are deflected in certain I'equired directions.
Lenses, which form the
basis of most
optical
in-
struments, are generally constructed of glass, and the
two
chief uses of lenses being to concentrate and to
scatter rays of light, the glass is shaped so as to effect
these two objects.
11. The
chief forms of glass lenses are shown
in
Fig.
3. A
is a spherical lens, B
is a
double convex
lens
; the two surfaces may have the same convexity,
as
in
the
illustration,
or may
have
different
con-
vexities.
C
is a plano-convex
lens,
one
side
being
plane, the other convex.
D
is a meniscus, where one
side is convex, the other concave, the convexity being
greater than
the
concavity.
E
is
a double concave
lens.
In such lenses the concavities may be the same

or
dissimilar.
F
is a plano-concave lens, one surface
plane, the other concave.
G
is a concavo-convex lens,
the
concavity
being
greater
than
the
convexity.

The
curved
surfaces
of
artificial
lenses
are
usually
spherical, but lenses may be constructed with
cylin-
drical, elliptical, or hyperbolical surfaces.
When
light reaches them through a
less refractive
medium M, the four
first
forms
A, B, C, D
concen-
trate the
rays, and
are what
are
called magnifying
glasses, the remainder
E, F, G
disperse rays of light,
and are sometimes called diminishing glasses.
12. The subjoined diagram
(Fig. 4)
explains how
parallel rays of light proceeding from a less refractive
medium are concentrated to a focus by a double convex
lens made of a more refractive substance.
The parallel
rays A, B, C, impinge on the surface of the lens L L,
at the points D, E, G.
As the centre ray A strikes
the lens at D perpendicularly to its surface,
it passes

through the lens in a straight line, and as it emerges
from
the
opposite
side
of the
lens
at
H, perpen-
dicularly to the surface of the less refractive medium
M, whose shape is determined by that of the lens, the
ray
still goes on
in a straight
line.
But the ray B
impinges on the surface of the lens L obliquely at E

(R Q

and
as L has
a
greater
refractive power than the
medium whence the ray comes, the ray is now in
its
passage through L deflected towards the perpendicular
of the surface E of the lens.
The radius R E of the

dicular to the front of its surface at E.
So in passing
through the lens the ray B is deflected at E, so that it
strikes the opposite side and emerges
at J
; but here
it enters the
less
. refractive medium M obliquely to
its surface
at
J,
and
is accordingly
deflected away
from
its perpendicular (the radius S J of the surface
L J L prolonged).
This new deflexion directs it to F,
where
it meets the undeflected central ray A and the
corresponding parallel ray C at the opposite periphery
of the lens.
All intermediate parallel rays between B
and C likewise meet at F, and this is called the focus
of the lens.

13. Rays of light proceeding from a luminous object
at a considerable
distance, impinge on
the
lens
in
nearly parallel
lines.
But when the luminous object
is near the lens, the rays
of light from
it strike the
lens
in divergent
lines.
In the latter case the focus

found
at a
greater distance behind the
lens,
as
shown in Fig. 5, where the rays proceeding from a near
object
are focused at
F, whilst parallel rays a,b, are
focused at
0.
14. When
parallel rays of light proceeding from a
less
refractive medium
pass through a double con-
cave
lens made
of a more
refractive medium they
are dispersed.
This will be understood by the follow-
ing
diagram,
Fig.

The
parallel

A, B, C, impinge on the surface of the lens at D, E, G.
As the centre ray strikes the lens at D perpendicularly
to
its surface, it passes through the lens in a straight
line, and
as
it emerges from the opposite side of the
lens
at H, perpendicularly to the surface of the less

1
refractive medium M, whose shape
is determined by
that of the lens, the ray still goes on in a straight line.
But the ray B impinges on the surface of the lens L
obliquely at E (B E R in
its angle of incidence), and
as L has a greater refractive power than the medium
through which the ray comes, the ray
is now
in
its
passage
through L
deflected
towards
the
perpen-
dicular.
The
perpendicular
is
ascertained by
pro-
longing
the
radius R E
of the
surface E D G.
On
emerging
at
J,
it
enters the
less refractive medium
M
obliquely
to
its
surface,
and
is
consequently
deflected
away from
the
perpendicular S J,
in
the
direction
J K.
The same thing takes place with the
ray C at the opposite periphery of the lens L and with
all intermediate parallel rays.
The
focus of a concave lens is said to be the point
F, where the rays would meet if prolonged backwards
in their final direction.
15.
In eveiy case of refraction of light by
lenses,
the amount of the deflexion depends on the difference
between
the
refractive power
of
the
lens
and
the
medium
through which
the rays
of light are
trans-
mitted to
it.
This refractive power of a transparent
medium
is
called
its
index
of
refraction.
As the
atmospheric air is the medium of least refractive power
employed in optical operations, its index of refraction

1 2
The Human Eye ;
its Optical Construction.
is called
i.
Glass, which has an index of refraction
of
I
• 5, is the usual substance of which optical lenses
are made.
But some substances of which lenses may
be made have a much higher or a much lower index of
refraction than glass.
Thus the index of refraction of
diamond
is as high as 2-4, and water has an index of
refraction of
i
• 3.
The rule for calculating the amount
of
deflexion a ray
will undergo
in
its transmission
from air through a lens,
I need not detain the reader
by explaining.
It
is expressed
in these terms
: The
sine of the angle of incidence is to the sine of the angle
of refraction as the index of refraction of the lens is
to
I.
Thus
if the lens be of water, the sine of the
angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction
will be
as
I
• 3
to
I
;
if of
glass, as
i
• 5 to
I
;
if of
diamond, as 2*4 to
i, and so on.
16. But when
a
glass
lens
is
used
in a medium
whose index of refraction is greater than that of
air,
as for instance in water, then the sine of the
angle
of incidence
to that of refraction
will be
as
i
• 5
to
1-3.
In other words, the rays of light impinging on
a
glass
lens immersed
in
water,
will be much
less
deflected than when the same
leris
is used
in
air
;
it
will consequently concentrate the rays of light at a
much greater distance behind it in water than in air.
17. Lenses may be made when the relations betwixt

Lenses of small Refractive Power.
13
the lens and the surrounding medium through which
it receives the rays of Hght may be just the opposite
of those
just
described.
The
surrounding medium
may be the most
refractive, the
lens
itself the least
refractive.
18. Lenses
of
this
description
(Fig.
7) may
be
similar in shape to those formerly described, but their

qualities
will
be
precisely
the
opposite
of
theirs.
Thus the sphere A, double convex B, plano-convex C,
and meniscus D, will cause the rays of light to diverge
;
whereas the double concave E, plano-concave F, and
concavo-convex G, will cause the rays of light trans-
mitted through them to converge.
19. This will be understood from the following dia-
grams.
The
parallel
rays ABC
(Fig.
8),
passing
through the more
refractive medium M, impinge on
the surface of the lens L L (which
is composed of a
less refractive medium than M), at the points D, E, G.

14
The Hiiman Eye ;
its Optical Construction.
The centre ray A, striking the lens at D
perpendicu-
larly to
its
surface, passes through the
lens without
any deflexion of
its course, and as
it also strikes the

surface of the more refractive medium at H, perpen-
dicularly
to
its
surface,
it
continues on
a
straight
course.
The ray B impinges on
the
surface
of the
lens at E obliquely (its angle of incidence being B E Q),
so on passing through the
less
refractive
lens
it
is
deflected
away
from
the
perpendicular RE
and
emerges at J.
Here
it enters the more refractive me-
dium M obliquely (its angle of incidence being E J S),
so in passing through this medium
it is again deflected

towards the perpendicular S T, and proceeds
in the
course J K.
The same thing happens to the ray C on
the opposite periphery
of the lens.
Thus
it will be
seen that
this double convex lens, because it receives
the rays of light from a medium of greater refractive
power,
acts
precisely
like
a
double
concave
lens
receiving
rays from
a
less
refractive medium
than
itself.
On both sides the more refractive medium has
a concave shape.
20. When
parallel
rays,
passing through
a more
refractive medium, strike a double concave lens made
of a less refractive medium, they converge to a point

to the surface of the medium M, and is not deflected.
The ray B impinges on the surface of the lens at E
obliquely (its angle of incidence is B E R), and as the
lens L is a
less refractive medium than that it leaves,
the ray is deflected away from the perpendicular R T,
and
strikes
the
opposite
surface
of
the
lens
at
J.
Here
it
enters
the more
refractive medium M at J,
and
is
consequently
deflected towards
' the perpen-
dicular S J, and joins the ray ADH
at F.
As the
ray C on the opposite periphery of the lens and all
intermediate parallel rays likewise meet at F, this
is
the focus of the lens L.
Thus
it will be seen that a
double concave
lens constructed of a less
refractive
medium, immersed in a more refractive medium, acts
like a double convex lens made of a more refractive
substance in a medium of less refractive power.
On
both sides the more refractive medium has a convex
shape.
21. A combination of lenses is frequently used.
In
some
cases
it
is
desirable
to
increase the refractive
power
of
the
lens, and
thereby
shorten
its
focus.
This
is
shown
in

This
is done
(Fig. 11) by adding a concave

23.
If a screen be placed behind a lens precisely in
its focus when
it
is
receiving rays of
light from an
object situated in front of it at a greater distance than
its own focal length, an inverted picture of the object
will be thrown upon the screen.
This will be under-
stood by the diagram

placed in
front of a lens LL at a distance greater
than its focal length.
Rays of light emanate in every
direction from every point of the object.
Those pro-
ceeding
from
the
central
point A
are
focused,
as
already explained, behind the
lens, at

by the interrupted line
;
whilst the rays from the point
C are focused
at /', as shown by the dotted
line. A
screen placed
at F//' will exhibit an
inverted and
smaller picture of the object ABC.
24.
It is this property of the
lens, of depicting the
image
of an
object
in
front
of
it beyond
its
focal
length on a screen placed behind
it in its focus, that is
utilized in the construction of the camera obscura and
photographic apparatus.
From what
has been pre-
viously said,
it will be obvious that
for the picturing
on the screen of distant objects whence the rays of light
impinge on the lens in nearly parallel lines, the screen
must be placed nearer the back of the lens than when
it
is wished
to
picture the image
of
near
objects,
whence the rays impinge divergently on the lens.
In
the former
case, as already explained,
the
focus
is
shorter than in the latter.
25.
If the position of the screen
is
fixed, then the
alteration required
in order to focus objects perfectly
upon
it, must take place
in the
position
of the lens,
which may be moved nearer
the
screen
for distant
objects, and farther from the screen for near objects.
Or
if
it be impossible to move
either screen or lens,
which must consequently preserve the same
relative
positions, then
it
will be necessary
to
increase
the
refractive power of the
lens, whereby its focus will be

shortened for near objects.
This may be done by
I, using a lens of greater convexity
;
2, by employing
a
lens of the same convexity, but made
of a more
refractive
material
;
or
3, by employing
a
supple-
mentary convex
lens, as shown at Fig.
10, where the
original lens is adapted
for distant objects;
or
4, by
making
use
of
a
supplementary
concave
lens,
as
shown
at Fig.
1 1, where the
original lens
is already
suited
for the focusing of near objects
; or
5, by pre-
senting the lens obliquely to the object, whereby the
focal distance is diminished.
The rudimentary optical
facts above detailed
will
render intelligible the
principles
of the
optical
con-
struction of the eye.
26. The
optical
instrument
the
eye
most
nearly
resembles,
is the photographic camera.
In both we
have an
inverted image
of external
objects thrown
upon a sensitive screen at the back of a dark chamber.*
In the case of the eye, however, the dark chamber is
filled with a highly refractive aqueous medium, and
the lens is a compound one, composed of twc^^media of
different refi'active powers.

optical Diagram of the Eye.
S S is the hard, thick, opaque case called the sclerotic,
which encloses the
dioptric media of the
eye.
It
is
nearly spherical in shape, and lies
in a hollow of the
skull
called the
orbit, where
it
is surrounded by a

series
of
muscles which
turn
it
in

required
direction.
This opaque
case does
not
constitute
a
complete sphere.
In the front part of
it
is a circular
opening, which
is
occupied by
a
firm
transparent
structure C C, more convex
in shape than
the case
itself,
and resembling a watch
glass
;
this
is
called
from
its horny consistence
the
cornea.
At
a
short
distance
behind
the
cornea
there
is

1 1, called the
iris, with a

cular hole
in
its centre capable of being made larger
or smaller by the contractions of the membrane.
The
membrane
is
of
various
colours in
various
eyes
;
it
gives what
is
called
the
colour to the eye.
In the
human
eye
it
varies
from
light grey
to the most
intense
violet
blue, and from yellow through
every
shade
of brown
and
hazel
to
the
deepest
black.
Various
shades
of
green
are
not
uncommon.
In
the
albino
it
is usually bright red.
It
is a
perfectly
opaque membrane, not allowing a ray of light to pass
through
it, except in the albino, where the absence of
colouring matter renders
it not
quite opaque.
The
circular opening in its centre P P is called the pupil.
The iris divides the eye into two unequal chambers
filled
with
transparent
media.
That
to
the
front,
bounded by the cornea, contains a watery fluid A A
called
the aqueous humour.
That bounded by the
sclerotic behind contains a
fluid similar in properties
to
the
aqueous
humour,
but
enclosed
in
a
finely
reticulated membrane, which holds
its
fluid contents
together even
after removal from the eye, causing
it
to look like a lump of glass—hence its name, vitreous
htmiour, VV.
The
refractive power
of cornea and
aqueous and vitreous humours is nearly identical, and
is very nearly the same as that of water.
Immediately behind the iris, bathed in front by the

Cttrvatures of the Crystalline Lens.
23
aqueous humour, and behind imbedded in the front
of the vitreous humour, is a transparent double-convex
lens-shaped body L L, enclosed in an elastic membrane.
This
lens
is
called the
crystalline
lens.
It
is com-
posed of concentric layers of various refractive power,
increasing towards the centre.
Its average refractive
power
is not much greater than that of the aqueous
and vitreous humours.
While the index of refraction
of the
latter may be
stated
as
1-33,
the
average
index of refraction of the crystalline lens
is certainly
not more than 1-39. probably less.
The
crystalline
lens
is commonly spoken of as "the lens of the eye,"
but this
is misleading,
for
it
is not the only nor yet
the chief lens of the eye, but may rather be looked on
as a supplementary lens, as far as the human eye
is
concerned, though, as we shall see hereafter, in certain
other classes of animals
it is the chief or even the sole
ocular lens.
28, The curvatures of the two
surfaces of the crys-
talline lens are not alike
; thus its front is less convex,
while its back is more convex than the cornea.*
* The curvatures of cornea, and front and back of crystalline lens are
usually stated to be as follows
:
the cornea has a radius of curvature
of
8
miUimetres,
the front
of the
crystalline lens has
a
radius
of
curvature of lo millimetres,
and
its back
a
radius
of
curvature
of
6 millimetres
; but as those surfaces are not
spherical, these measure-
ments can only be considered as averages.

the surfaces of the

This
will
make
the apex of the
cornea
its most
convex part, while the
apices of the
surfaces of the

crystalline lens will be the least convex.
This shape
of the
surfaces

refractive media of
the
eye
endows them with peculiar optical properties.
30. When
parallel rays of light,
i, e. rays of light
from a distant object, impinge upon the eye, they first
come in contact with the convex surface of the cornea.
The cornea, having a refractive power nearly idaitical
with that of the aqueous humour it encloses, the two
together form a homogeneous lens, bounded in front by
the outline of the cornea, behind by the anterior sur-
face of the
crystalline.
The form of this lens,
it will
be observed, is that of the meniscus (D, Fig. 3), for the
convexity of the cornea
is, as before obsei'ved, greater
than that
of the
anterior
surface
of the

However,
It
differs from the ordinary
meniscus
in
this,
that the concave
surface does not
come in contact with the
air, but
is in
close
apposi-
tion with
a more
refractive medium than
itself; so
that, in tracing the rays of light through the aqueous
humour, we have only to take into consideration the
convergent
refraction caused by
its convex
surface,
and not, as
in the case of a glass meniscus, the diver-
gent refraction caused by the concave surface.
The ray a (Fig.
13), falling perpendicularly to the
surface of the cornea at d, passes through the dioptric
media of the eye without refraction to the back of the
eye.
The rays d and
c, which strike the cornea at e
and g; passing from a less refractive medium, the
air,
into the more refractive medium obliquely to its surface,
are deflected towards the perpendicular, as before ex-
plained
(see Fig.
4)-
This
will bring
these rays
in
the direction ek, gk, when they will impinge on the
surface of the crystalline lens
at h and
k.
The crys-
talline
lens,
being
a more
refractive medium
than
the aqueous humour, the rays from the
latter, striking
its surface obliquely, are deflected again towards the
perpendicular of the anterior convexity of the crystal-
line, and proceed in the direction h in, k n, and passing
into the less refractive medium of the vitreous humour,
they are again deflected, this time away from the per-

posterior
curve
of the
crystalline
lens, which brings them in the direction mf, nf, where
they join the central ray at /, on the line of the visual
axis of the eye.*
The interior of the eye-case is lined
with a sensitive
screen, called the
retina,
a nervous
expanse
of wonderful
construction,
that
forms
the
termination of the optic nerve.
31. This nervous
screen, on which the
picture
of
external objects
is thrown,
is only perfectly sensitive
to the images formed on
it in a small point exactly in
the
axis
of vision
at f, where
is
the
focus
of rays
proceeding from objects directly in
front of the
eye.
The
field of view of the eye
is very
extensive, but
the portion of this field, where the image of external
objects is perfectly seen,
is a very minute point, called
the yellow spot.
In this spot the arrangement of rods
and cones, of which the retina is made up,
is different
from what
it is on other parts of the retina.f
32. In consequence of this arrangement
it
is only
* These alterations in the direction of the ray of hght are so shght,
that they are not exhibited in the cut.
t Although the yellow spot in the axis of vision
is the only part of
the retina capable of distinctly perceiving the picture of objects thro-wn
upon it,
it
is actually not so
sensitive to
light as the surrounding parts
'
of the
retina.
Of this we may convince ourselves
if we darken the
room sufficiently without excluding all light.
Then, if we look straight
forward, we
shall be able
to see the forms of white
objects, such as
pieces of white paper, lying on either side, but on directing the eye to
these
objects,
that
is
to
say, on allowing them
to be focused on the
yellow spot, we cannot see them at all.

Imperfect Sensitiveness of the Retina.
27
necessaiy that the
rays
of light
in the
line
of the
visual axis,
i. e. the rays
directly in front of the
eye,
should be accurately focused on this small point of the
retina
;
the remainder of the retina would not be able
to
perceive
distinctly
the
objects
pictured upon
it,
though they may be perfectly focused.
The lightning-
like rapidity of the
eye's movements neutralizes the
defective
sensibility
of the remainder
of the
retiha,
and enables us,
if not to take in a whole landscape at
a glance, at all events to see every portion of it in suc-
cession with the utmost distinctness by a rapid sweep
of our
eye.
In
this way each individual portion
of
the
landscape
is
accurately
focused
on
the
small
perfectly sensitive spot of the retina, and the impres-
sion on the mind
is
as
if the whole view were
dis-
tinctly seen at once.
It
is probable, indeed
certain,
that
the
image
of
external objects is distinctly focused on a much larger
space than the small yellow spot that is alone capable
of perceiving
it perfectly, but it is impossible that the
whole
field
of vision,
so
extensive
as
it
is,
can be
accurately focused.
Practically, however, this is of no
consequence,
for the perfectly sensitive
point of the
retina being
exactly
in the
axis
of vision,
it
is no
detriment to our perception of external objects
if the
whole
of
the
remainder
of
the
retina
received
an
imperfectly focused picture.

28
The Human Eye ;

33. From what has been stated
it will be seen that
the eye has a considerable resemblance to the photo-
graphic camera.
Both have a dark chamber, and one
or more lenses, so arranged as to throw a picture of ex-
ternal objects on a sensitive screen* at the back of this
dark chamber.
But the eye differs in some important
respects
from
the photographic
camera.
While
the
dafk chamber
of the
latter
is
filled with the same
medium as that through which the rays pass to the
lens of the camera, viz.
air,
the dark chamber of the
eye
is
filled with a highly
refractive medium, which
forms,
in
fact, the principal
lens
of the eye, for the
chief refraction
is performed by the aqueous humour,
the
crystalline
lens only being as
it were a supple-
mentary
lens,
effecting a
slight additional refraction
of the incident rays.
Rays of light, entering the camera of the eye from
the air by its anterior lens, do not again pass into air
before being focused on the
sensitive screen behind,
as they do in the photographic camera.
34.
In the eye we find an arrangement for cutting
off superfluous rays of light that might interfere with
* Recent observations seem
to show that the resemblance between
the screen of
tlie eye and that of the
artificial camera is greater than
was supposed.
Thus Kiihne found
that the image of an object thrown
upon the retina during life is actually visible as a rose-coloured picture
on that membrane after death.
(See
' Nature,' vol. xv. p. 296.)

The Diaphragm of the Eye.
29
the perfection of the image cast on the
retina.
This
is
called a diaphragm
in
optical
instruments.
The
iris
1 1, which
is the diaphragm of the
eye,
is placed
just in front of the crystalline lens, and has the power
of
contracting and
dilating
its
opening,
called
the
pupil, P P, to regulate the admission of rays
of light.
In
fact,
in
ordinary conditions
of
the
eye, the
iris,
which
is
an opaque
membrane,
covers up
a
large
portion
of the
crystalline
lens, and allows
only
its
central portion to receive the rays of light.
The size
of the pupil regulates the amount of light admitted
into the eye.
When the image would be blurred by
the
admission of rays
of
light
in
excess,
the
pupil
contracts
and
shuts
off
these
rays.
Accordingly
the
pupil
contracts,
as
a
rule,
in
strong
light and
dilates
in obscure
light.
When the refractive media
of the eye become
less
accurate, as they do in
old
age, the pupil has a tendency to
contract, and thus
correct, to some extent,
the
faulty refraction of the
ocular lenses.
But the contraction of the pupil
is not
carried
far
enough
to
obviate
all
the
inaccuracies
of the defective eye-lenses of old
age.
Accordingly,
we are forced to supply, by artificial means, the addi-
tional
refractive power the
defects
of our
refractive
media require.
35.
I have stated that the chief lens of the eye
is

30
The Human Eye ;

that formed by the cornea and aqueous humour.
By
this
I mean that the
first refraction of rays of hght
at the cornea and aqueous humour is greater than the
second caused by the
crystalline
lens.
And yet the
crystalline lens
is constructed of a medium of greater
refractive power than the cornea and aqueous humour
;
it
is moreover a double convex lens, one surface
of
which
is greatly more convex than the single convex
surface of the aqueous lens, which, as before remarked,
is a meniscus.
Did
it receive the rays of light as the
aqueous lens does from the slightly refractive medium,
the
air, the
refractive power of
the
double convex
crystalline
lens
would
greatly
exceed
that
of
the
aqueous meniscus.
It would,
in fact, bring the rays
to a focus 4 or
5 millimetres behind
it.
But as
the
crystalline
lens
is
suspended
in
a
medium
(the
aqueous and vitreous humours) whose refractive power
is but slightly inferior to its own, rays of light passing
into
it
from
this medium
are
only
very
slightly
deflected from their course.
. It would be difficult by calculation to ascertain the
precise amount
of
refraction
of
the
rays
of
light
effected by each
of
the
ocular
lenses,
but we
can
experimentally do this.

events from the

so that rays of light
penetrate to the sensitive screen of the ocular camera
only refracted by the
cornea and aqueous humour.
This refraction is not sufficient to form a clear image
of
external
objects
on
the
retina.
The
focus
of
the
lens formed by the
refractive media of the eye
without the crystalline lens is considerably behind the

a blurred and confused image.
In order to correct
this, a lens
/ / is used
to give the
refraction
to
the
rays necessary,
in
combination with
the
further
re-
fraction
effected by the cornea,
to bring them
to a
focus on the retina
at /.
The lens
/ / required for
this
purpose
will
precisely
represent
the
refractive
power of the
lost crystalline lens.
It is found that a
glass
lens
of 4
inches
focus
will
generally
restore
perfect
vision
for
distant
objects,
i. e.
will
focus
parallel
rays
accurately
on
the
retina.
This
con-
clusively
proves
that
the
crystalline
lens
in
its
situation in the
interior of the eye
is equal to a glass
lens of 4 inches focus in air.
38. In the same way we may infer that the
refrac-
tive power
of the
cornea and aqueous and vitreous
humours is equal to a glass lens, which superimposed
on
a
glass
lens
of 4
inches
focus,
will
suffice
to
reduce the focus to
i inch (the diameter of the
eye).
What the focus
of such a lens may be can be ascer-
tained by the modes of calculation familiar to optical
students,
or
it may be found out by trying several
lenses over a 4-inch
lens.
In
this way we shall find
that a glass lens of i^-inch focus,
if superimposed on
a glass lens of 4 inches focus, will reduce the focus to
I
inch.
We
thus
prove that the
refraction
of
the

of
its

lens
is
equal

;
hence
it would

behind the retina.
39. But we may ascertain the precise value of the
aqueous lens by extinguishing its
refractive power in
the living human eye, and ascertaining what power of
lens will suffice to restore perfect vision.
40, As
before
observed,
the
refractive
power
of
the
aqueous and vitreous
humours
is almost
iden-
tical with that of water.
If then we immerse the eye
in water, and
allow
it
to
receive
the rays of
light
through
this medium,
it
is obvious
that these rays
will
suffer no
further refraction from those media of
the eye ; that in fact, the only refraction they will now
undergo will be that
effected by the crystalline lens,
which, as we have just seen, being equal
to a lens of
4 inches focus,
is unable to focus rays of light nearer
than about
3
inches behind the eye
;
vision,
conse-
quently, beneath the water will be very
indistinct, as
the rays of light intercepted by the retina are so far
from
their true
focus.
It
is obvious that
this must
be so, for, as shown by Fig. 16, the rays of light suffer
no deflexion
at
e and g, but only at h,

n,

Restoration of Perfect Vision under Water.
35
poor amount of vision
only remains
for
objects
at
a small distance from us
; a few yards
off, even objects
of considerable size are unseen.
42.
In order to
restore
perfect vision under water
we must use a lens capable of concentrating the rays
of light transmitted to
it through water into a focus
at
inch
behind
it
;
this
being
the
focus
of
the
aqueous lens lost by immersion in the water.
43. If we use a glass lens for this purpose it is obvious
that it must be a much more powerful lens than what
would have a focus of that length
in
air.
For while
the refractive index of air compared with that of glass
is as
I to
I
• 5, the refractive index of water compared
with that of glass is only as
I
• 33 to
i
• 5.
Hence glass
will refract the rays
of light to a very much smaller
extent in water than in
air,
in
fact about
one-fourth.
I have found experimentally that a glass lens which
has a focus of three-eighths of an inch in air will have
a focus of
\\ inch
in water.
Therefore a
glass
lens
of this power
will be required
in order to enable an
eye immersed
in water to see
distinctly, and
I have
practically proved that this
is so.
44. But
it
is
obvious
that
water
being
itself a
medium of high
refractive power,
it would be better
to avail ourselves of a medium either of much greater
refractive power than
itself, or of much
less.
Now

is difficult to procure a transparent medium of much
greater
refractive
power
than
glass
for use
in
the
water.
Diamond,
which
would
do,
its
refractive
power being
as
high
as
2 '4,
is
for obvious
reasons
not to be thought of.
But there is nothing to prevent
us using a medium of very inferior refractive power to
water in the construction of subaqueous lenses.
The
medium of least refractive power is air.
The relations
of lens medium to surrounding medium being reversed,
the shape
of the
air lens must be also
reversed, as
before shown.
We must use here a double concave
air lens in place of the double convex glass lens.
45. By
taking
two
of
the
old-fashioned
highly-
curved watch glasses, and fixing them
in a ring with
their concavities outwards, we enclose a portion of air
of the shape of a double concave
lens.
Immersed in
water, this air lens will refract the rays of light from
objects reaching
it through the water, convergently.
It will resemble in its optical properties a double con-
vex glass lens in air, as I have explained above (§ 20).
46.
I found that a double concave
air
lens, made
with
two
sections
of
a
glass
globe
of
2
inches
diameter,
constitute
a
lens
of
i^-inch
focus when
immersed
in water.
This
lens accordingly
supplies
the refractive power lost by the eye when immersed
in water.
In the diagram
(Fig.
16) the dotted

the
eye when
immersed
in
water.
They
are
not
focused
at
the
retina, so that the image formed on
the
retina
is
very indistinct,
as
it must be when so
imperfectly focused.
The continuous line shows how
the rays of light are first deflected by the concave air
lens
/
;
this
deflexion,
in
the case
of a
lens whose
curves are such as stated above,
being
sufficient
to
make up
for the loss of refraction by the extinction
of the aqueous humour lens when
it receives the rays
of
light
through
the
identically
refracting
watery
medium.
47.
I thought
it might be advantageous, or at
all
events agreeable,
to be
able
to see
distinctly when
diving; so
I
constructed
a
pair
of spectacles
fitted
with
air
lenses
of
the
kind
just
described.
It
is
obvious
that
spectacles
fitted with
air lenses would
be
much
more
convenient
for
diving
than
glass
lenses.
For whereas
the
glass
lenses
required
for
subaqueous purposes
are of such very short focus in
air (only three-eighths of an
inch), that they would
prevent
all
vision when
the
diver came to the
sur-
face, these
air lenses would
offer no impediment to
perfect
vision
in
the
air, and
so might continue
to
be worn with equal advantage both
in air and water.
I
found,
however,
that the two
sections
of a
glass
globe which form the concave
air
lens, have
in the
air the
effect of a very weak concave glass lens, such

38
The Human Eye ;
its Optical Construction.
a lens as
is used
to
correct the
slightest
degree of
short sight.
The cause of this
is that the inner con-
cave
surface of the glass globe is a curve of smaller
radius than the outer convex
surface.
Thus
it
is a
concavo-convex
lens, though
of very
small
power.
But when two such glasses are
placed together the
refraction they produce
is appreciable, and somewhat
impairs perfect vision to a non-myopic eye.
48.
In order to counteract this slight refraction in
the lens when used in the
air, in place of having the
glasses made of sections of a glass globe, I had them
ground with surfaces of precisely the same curvature.
By this means
I obtained
glasses
for my air lenses
which, having
their
surfaces
of precisely
the same
curve, cause no deflexion of the rays of light.
These
lenses
therefore
restore perfect
vision
beneath
the
water, and
offer no impediment
to perfect
sight
in
the air,
49. Vision below the water,
if the
latter
is
quite
clear,
is with lenses of this
description quite perfect
for both near and distant objects.
Thus with them we
can see to read the smallest type at the distance of a
foot, while we ,can
also
see objects at many yards
distance.
Everything below the water
is seen
in
its
proper proportions, and without any distortion what-
ever.

bottom and sides of a bath, as in many of the swim-

* In 1871 I published a pamphlet entitled 'Notes on the Dioptrics
of Vision,' in which I gave a description of the air lenses for use under
water.
This pamphlet
I
sent
to
several
scientific
gentlemen,
and
among them to
the late
Sir John Herschel,
through
his
publishers,
Messrs. Longmans.
A few days afterwards
I received the foUovnng
letter
:
• igjg^^
" CoLUNGWooD, Jan. 22, 1871.
"I beg to acknowledge, with thanks, your paper,
'Notes on

"The idea of employing a double concave air lens in water, instead
of the more obvious double convex glass one,
is ingenious, as
it ceases
to be a lens as soon as
it
is out of the water, and (bamng distortion
from wet external
surfaces) would not impede vision
if used
as spec-
tacles out of water.
Excuse me, however,
if I remark that the way in
which the principle of construction
is
stated in page

had
to
myself, on a
first
rapid
perusal,
the
effect of creating some
degree of obscurity
as to the actual
disposition intended, which was
only dissipated, as
I read on, by the use of the term
' air lens

15, line 8, when all became clear.

50. The effect of perfect vision, such as these lenses
afford, beneath the surface of the sea
is
curious and
unexpected.
If the sea
is
perfectly clear, as
it
is on
many
parts
of the
coast, when we
dive, say from
6 to 10 feet
in water of about 20
feet
in depth, we
see
the bottom most
distinctly;
eveiy
stone,
every
shell, every
leaf of seaweed that may be growing on
the sand
is distinctly visible over a considerable space.
But on looking around
us horizontally we
are
sur-
prised at the gloom of the prospect.
However bright
the day may be above, we seem to be looking
into
the depths of an obscure cavern, wherein
is
" No light, but rather darkness visible."
The weird void that seems to extend
all around
us,
unless where it is broken by a fragment of floating sea-
weed, some air-bubbles hastening up to the daylight,
or perhaps
the white limbs of some
distant
fellow-
bather, seems unaccountable under a bright sunshine.
If we turn on our back and look upwards, we shall
find
that
the
light
seems
not
to penetrate
all
the
surface, but only a limited portion of
it.
The surface
of the sea
is seldom so smooth
as
to
enable
us
to
note exactly what takes
place, but
if we
will gently
glide
to the bottom of an ordinary swimming bath
when the surface
is undisturbed by other bathers, we
shall
see
what

of the room and all the objects in
it, except what are
immediately above the observer's head, will be more or
less distorted.
Objects must be at a certain elevation
in order to be seen at all by the immersed observer.
The reason of this is, that rays of light must impinge on
the water at a certain angle (about
lo'^ from the hori-
zontal) in order to enter the surface of the water and
be refracted.
Fig. i8* will convey an idea of the appearances seen
by an observer immersed
in the centre of one of the
London swimming
baths.
In order to observe this
perfectly,
it
is necessary that the
surface
of the bath
be perfectly undisturbed, and that the observer should
let himself down beneath the water without causing
any movement of its surface, which may be done after
repeated trials.
He must also be furnished with
air-
lens spectacles.
The
first thing that will strike him
is that the floor of the bath
is accurately and vividly
pictured on the under surface of the water, as though
that were a mirror of silvered
glass.
This picture of
the floor
is pierced by a
circular opening, cut out
as
sharply as if done with a
knife, and the edge
of the
opening
is
fringed
by a
delicate
iridescent border.
Through this opening the whole of the room and
its
contents
are visible, with the exception
of the parts
and
objects very low down.

have here depicted, a border about 2
feet
high, orna-
mented with scroll work, is not visible to the immersed
observer.
All
objects,
except
those
immediately
above the observer's head, are more or less distorted
the
nearer they
are
to
the
horizon
the
more
dis-
torted they
are.
Thus, the person standing on the
ri^ht-hand
side
of
the
woodcut
is
flattened
and
dwarfed out of
all recognition.
The clock at the top
of the cut is less distorted, as it is more elevated
; but
even the windows in the roof of the building appear
to be curved
(though
in
reality they
are
not
so),
except those immediately above the observer.
The
most striking part of the phenomena observed is the
sharpness
with which the
circular opening
is cut
in
the picture of the bottom of the bath.
There
is no
noticeable
transition
of
indistinctness from the
pic-
tured porcelain tiles of the bath to the distorted view
of the objects above the water in its circular frame. A
very careful observation may indeed detect a ghostly
prolongation of the pattern of the bottom of the bath
a little way beyond the edge of the circular opening,
but it is so very indistinct that it is not noticed unless
steadily looked for.
The explanation of these phenomena will be found
in the subjoined diagram
(Fig.
19).

it
is prolonged to the eye below the water at E.
The

The point C sends a ray which, striking the
surface
of the water at an angle of 60° at D, is refracted thence
to the eye at an angle of 40° from the perpendicular,
and seems to be
at
c.
So also a ray from the point
F impinging on the water at an angle of 30° from the
perpendicular is deflected at C
at an angle of 20° to
the eye at E, by which it will be seen at /.
The rays

larly,
suffer no
refraction
in their course
to the eye
at
E,
and
therefore H
is seen
in
its
true
position.
Beyond the point B, where the rays of light from the
lowest point outside the water capable of being
re-
fracted are bent towards the eye, the under surface of
the water
acts
as
a
mirror,
reflecting with
perfect
accuracy and distinctness the floor of the bath.
The converse of these phenomena may be observed
from above the water by the eye placed at E (Fig. 20)
at a very small height above the surface of the water.
Fig.
20.
The rays proceeding from the bottom
of the bath at
H, directly beneath the eye, being perpendicular, suffer
no refraction, and the point H
is accordingly seen
in
its true position.
On the other hand, the rays from
the point F at an angle of 10° from the perpendicular
on emerging from the water at G are refracted to the
eye at an angle of 13°, and the point F appears to the

So
also the rays from the point
C, pro-
duced at an angle
of 40° from the perpendicular, are
refracted when they reach the surface of the water W
at D, at an angle of 53° to the eye at E, and the point
C will consequently appear to the eye as
if at
c.
The
rays from point A, at an angle of 53° from the
per-
pendicular, are refracted to the eye at S
at an angle
of
70°, and the point A will seem to the eye to be at
a.
Hence to the eye at E the floor of the bath appears
to rise upwards towards the surface of the water with
a strone curve, and the bottom of the bath disappears
beneath the surface of the water at Q.
Beyond this
point the bottom
of the bath
is not
seen, and the
surface of the water becomes a mirror, reflecting ex-
ternal objects with perfect accuracy.
It requires a little practice to make the observations
I have described under the
water.
To
slip gently
beneath the surface without agitating the water, and
to place oneself face upwards
at the bottom
of the
bath and make observations with distinctness in such
a
novel
situation,
is
not without
its
difficulties.
I
would advise those who attempt the
feat to wear a
nose-clip, otherwise
the water will
fill
the cavity of
the nose and cause a disagreeable sensation.
The phenomena described may be partially observed
in the large glass tanks of our aquaria.

fringed by an iridescent

I have described.

from and
to the

the
fish will see one another in their true places.
But the
rays from
the man on the bank
striking the water
obliquely are refracted at B.
The consequence of this
is that the man on the bank sees the fish at C, and the
fish sees the man

This
disagreement of the
true with the apparent position of objects in the water
seen from the side, is a fact familiar to those who have
attempted to shoot fish in the water.
One has to aim
considerably below the fish in order to hit
it.

It may be
interesting
to
look
at
the
optical
construction of the eyes of fishes and other aquatic
animals and see how it is that they can see distinctly
in the watery medium where they are obliged to live.
Fig. 23 shows diagrammatic sections of the eye of

50

a skate A, and the eye of a turtle B.
In the skate's
eye, and generally in the eyes of fishes, the cornea
is
nearly quite flat, the aqueous humour is insignificant,
and
there
is
virtually no
anterior
chamber,
for the
crystalline
lens
comes
up
close
to
the
cornea.
A
convex cornea filled by an aqueous humour would be
of no use
in the water, the
refractive index of
the
water
being
identical
with
that
of
the
aqueous
humour.
Accordingly the
refraction of
the rays of
light has
to
be
effected
entirely by the
crystalline
lens, which
is nearly spherical, and of much
greater
refractive
power
than
the
corresponding
organ
in
animals which pass their lives
in the
air.
The crys-
talline lens being so nearly spherical
in shape, and of
such
high
refractive power,
the
axis
of
the eye
is
short.
The eye of the turtle B, which
is so much
in
the
water,
is very similar
to
that
of the
fish.
The
crystalline lens
is very near the
cornea.
The lens
is
smaller proportionally than that of the skate, nor is
it
nearly so spherical
; and
its density, and consequently
its refractive power,
is somewhat
less.
Hence
it has
proportionally a longer
focus.
The cornea
is
more
convex than that of the
skate.
There
is nothing
in
the
configuration

the
optical construction
of
the
eyes of fishes or amphibia which should prevent them

in the
air as well
as
in the water,
for the
refractive
power of the crystalline lens will be the same whether
the animal
is
in water or
in
air, as
this
lens
is
still
enveloped
in
a watery medium
(the
aqueous
and
vitreous humours) when the animal is in the air.
The
fish having no
eyelids nor any lachrymal apparatus,
its cornea will be apt to become dim by exposure
to
the
air,*
but
the
turtle
is well supplied
with
the
requisite apparatus
for maintaining the transparency
of the eye in air.
Ophidian
reptiles have no
eyelids
or lachrymal apparatus, but they do not require them,
as their cornea is transparent though dry.
55. But
to
return
to
the human
eye.
We have
hitherto been considering the optical properties of the
eye
in relation to the incidence of parallel
rays, that
is, to the vision of distant
objects, the rays of light
proceeding from which approach
the eye
in
nearly
parallel lines.
But, as
is well known, the normal eye is
capable of focusing distinctly on the retina the image
of objects moderately near the eye, as near indeed as
from 6 to 10 inches.
Now it was shown above (Fig.
5)
that the divergent rays of light proceeding from a near
object are focused
at a greater distance behind a lens
* Some fishes are capable of living a long time out of water, such as
the climbing perch of Ceylon.
The transparency of the cornea in such
fishes is probably preserved by some peculiarity in its construction.
E

than the
nearly
parallel rays from a
distant
object.
In other words, the same
refractive power
is unable
to focus the images of near and distant objects on a
screen at the same distance behind
it.
In order that
the divergent
rays
from
the near
object
should
be
accurately focused on the screen, one of two things
must happen
:
i, either the distance between the back
of the lens and the screen must be increased
;
or, 2,
the refractive power of the lens must be increased.
56. As the
optical apparatus of the eye
is subject
to the same laws that govern the refraction of light in
our optical instruments, the same
rules that apply to
the latter must equally obtain in the former.
Hence
in the vision of near objects, either the distance of the
screen,
i. e.
the
retina, from
the
eye
lenses must be
increased, or the refractive power of these lenses must
be increased.
57. The most
diverse
views as
to
the means by
which one
or
other
of
these
operations
is
effected
have been held, and
are
still held, by distinguished
physiologists and physicists.
Thus Kepler supposed
that the eye was lengthened and
shortened by the
action of the ciliaiy processes.
Others have held that
an elongation of the
eyeball,
in order to adapt
the
eye
for near
vision, was
effected by the pressure of
the external muscles
of the
eye.
Huygens thought

Various Explanations of Near Vision.
53
that the crystalline
lens,
in near
vision, approached
the cornea by the pressure of the external muscles,
or that the convexity of the
crystalline
lens might
be increased by the same means.
Porterfield imagined
that the
crystalline
lens was drawn backwards and
forwards
by
the
ciliary
processes.
We now know
that the
ciliary processes
are not muscular, and are
incapable
of
motion, and
that
the
pressure
of
the
external muscles can have no influence on the
posi-
tion
or
shape
of
the
crystalline
lens,
and
cannot
elongate the
eyeball, which,
moreover,
is
not
elon-
gated
in adapting
the
sight
to near
objects.
Sir
David Brewster* maintained, with Huygens, that,
in
near vision, the distance of the crystalline lens from
the
retina
is
increased, and he conceived
this to be
effected by some unexplained mechanism at the base
of the
iris.
But
this idea makes no account of the
aqueous humour, which would have to advance
alono-
with the
crystalline lens and
its appendages, as
it
is
an
incompressible
fluid, and
cannot
escape
to
the
back of the
lens during
its supposed forward move-
ment.

lenses
or
of one of them during
near vision.
The more convex the surface of a lens,
cceteris paribus, the shorter
its
focus.
So,
then,
it
is
obvious that if by any means the convexity of one or
both of the eye lenses could be increased, the requisite
shortening of their focus for the vision of near objects
would be effected.
59. Some
contended
that
the
convexity
of
the
cornea was increased
in near
vision, by
the
simul-
taneous
contraction
of
the
external muscles
of the
eyeball
causing
the
globe
to
be
squeezed
into
a
flatter shape
posteriorly, and
thus made
to
bulge
and
become
more
convex
in
front.
The
principal
advocate of this notion was Sir Everard Home,* who
constituted himself the opponent of Dr. Young's view
(to be mentioned presently).
He invented an instru-
ment by
which
he
alleged
he
could
measure
the
exact extent of the increase of convexity that occurred
in the cornea.
That no alteration occurs in the con-
vexity of the cornea during accommodation
is known
by the
unaltered
size
of the
reflected image of the
candle flame, and
is proved by my own observations
under water, where accommodation remains
perfect,
though the refractive power of the cornea and aqueous
humour is extinguished.

60. So the cornea being abandoned, the increased
refractive power had to be sought
for
in the crystal-
line
lens.
Dr. Young,
in
1801,* contended that the
convexity of this
lens was increased
in near vision,
which
is the opmion held by most writers on
optics
at the present
day.
He
said
that
this
increase
of
convexity was caused by the automatic action of the
crystalline
lens, which was
a
muscle, as
its
fibrous
structure showed.
In this he followed Descartes, who
held
that the
crystalline was
a
muscle,
the
ciliary
processes being
its tendons, and that
it increased or
diminished its convexity, and thus adjusted
itself to
vision at different distances, by means of its muscular
power.t
It
is now known that the fibres of this lens
are not muscular.
61.
In
1849
a
distinguished
German
surgeon,
Maximilian Langenbeck,t thought he could prove the
increased
convexity of
the
crystalline
lens
in near
vision by the changes
in
position of the image of a
candle's flame reflected from the
different surfaces
of
the eye lenses.
He set himself to discover how this
increase of convexity was brought about, and satisfied
himself that it was effected by a circular muscle that

the edge
of
the crystaUine
lens.
This
muscle he called the musculus compressor lentis accom-
modatoritis, and he gives an admirable picture
of
it
in his book.
Other observers have not been able to
see
this muscle, so they have come to the conclusion
that
it was manufactured by the
discoverer's
scalpel,
a
fact
not
altogether without
precedent
in minute
anatomy.
.
62. A young Dutch
doctor, A. Cramer by name,*
constructed an instrument by which he was enabled
to
observe with a microscope the changes in position
of
the
reflected image
of the
candle
with
greater
accuracy
than
could
be attained
by Langenbeck's
method of
holding the candle
in
his hand and
in-
specting the eye without any magnifying power.
He
asserted that what he saw proved the increased con-
vexity of the crystalline lens
in near vision
; and he
imagined
that
the
increased
convexity was
caused
in some unexplained manner by the muscular action
of the iris.

place.
Bonders *

Cramer's mode

while these
illustrious
physiologists and

come
to
the
conclusion
that,
in
accommodation
for near
vision, the
crystalline
lens
increases
in
convexity,
and
therefore
in
refractive
power
; their observations of what really occurs in the
catoptrical phenomena of the eye differ considerably.
Langenbeck only observed that the image of the
candle flame reflected from the anterior surface of the
crystalline
lens moved when
the
eye was
adjusted
from distant to near vision and vice versa.
65. Cramer describes this image as moving towards
the corneal image
in accommodation
for near vision,
and slightly diminishing in size.
He gives a diagram
representing the image of the candle flame as moving
towards
^the
corneal
image
and
the
centre
of the
pupil, and
as
of
diminished
size.

no movement of

:

line lens becomes more convex and
its vertex moves
forwards.
5. The postericr surface of the lens becomes
somewhat more convex, and does not sensibly change
its place.
The
lens therefore becomes thicker in
its

its circumference must be diminished, or,

near accommodation.
(The dotted lines indicate the
change supposed to occur.)
The authors do not blink
this fact, but are quite equal to the task of explaining
how this
is so.
The crystalline lens, they say, consists
of a series of tubes arranged side by side.
When the
eye is in a state of rest,
i. e. when
it is accommodated
for distant vision, these tubes are empty, but when it
is accommodated
for near
vision,
the
ciliary muscle
pumps water from the canal of Petit, which surrounds
the lens, into these tubes, thereby increasing the size
and altering the shape of the
lens.
This
is a very
pretty
idea, that the canal of Petit should
be, as
it
were, a main water-pipe with continuous supply, ready
at any moment to
let water into the service pipes of
the lens whenever the tap
is turned on by the action
of
the cihary
muscle.
What
a
pity the
ingenious
authors do not inform us what
effect
this
filling with
water
of
the
tubes
of
the
crystalline
lens
would
have
on
its
refractive
properties
as
a
lens, why
these
capillary
tubes do not
keep themselves
con-
stantly
filled
without
the
assistance
of the
ciliary
muscle,
or how, being filled, they empty themselves
again.
70. Explanations more or less satisfactory, or rather
unsatisfactory, have been offered of the mode in which
the
ciliary muscle

convexity of
the
crystalline
lens
in accommodation
for near vision.
The following
is now the most gene-
rally received account of what occurs.
The ciystalline lens is enclosed in a strong
cartila-
ginous bag called the capsule, the special attribute of
which
is
its
elasticity.
This capsule and its contents
assume, when detached from the influence of
its con-
nexions, the thicker and more convex form which
it
takes
in near accommodation, and the
entire
lens
if
subjected
to
a
gentle
antero-posterior
squeeze
will
yield and become thinner and
flatter, and when
re-
leased
will
resume
at
once
its
thicker
and
more
convex form.
It is thus evident that if the lens were, when at rest
within the eye, free to adopt
its own shape, the eye
would be always accommodated for near objects, and
would be
useless
for
distant
visioa
It
is therefore
necessarily presumed that the periphery of the lens is
continually under tension, which flattens its form and
maintains
it
in
that condition,
i. e. the condition of
accommodation for distant vision.
This tension can-
not be muscular in
its :origin, because were
it so the
muscular spasm must be constant and unremitting—
a
condition which cannot exist—and because it has been
conclusively demonstrated
that muscular
relaxation
(which may be
artificially produced by
atropia)
is

accompanied not by a shortening of the sight
(i. e. by
a thickening of the
lens), but by the contrary condi-
tion.
The
cause
of
this
tension
is
therefore
to be
ascribed
to
the
passive
elasticity
of
the
structure
attached
to
the circumference
of
the
lens, and the
muscular
effort
in
near accommodation
counteracts
this
elasticity, and thus
relieves
the
lens-capsule
of
the force which prevents its assuming its natural cur-
vature.
The lens
is maintained
in its position by the
suspensory ligament known as the zonule of Zinn.
This
attachment seems to be simply a thickened expansion
of the hyaloid membrane which encloses the vitreous
humour, and
it takes
its
origin from
the margin
of
that body, just where the retina terminates
close to
the
posterior
limit
of
the
ciliary
muscle.
It
is
highly
elastic,
and
its
strength
and
elasticity
are
increased by the
interweaving of radiating
fibres
of
elastic tissue.
It lies between the ciliary processes and
the lens, and is attached to the anterior capsule, having
between itself and the vitreous humour a space about
the twelfth of an inch wide, immediately abutting on
the edge of the lens.
This space
is called the canal
of Petit, within which the edge of the lens
is supposed
to advance and recede during the changes of its form
which take place in accommodation.
To account for
the continuous
flattening of the lens this suspensory

The actual mechanism of ac-

is supposed to be as follows
:
a. The retina becomes conscious

it by the
lens
flattened by the
strain
of the
elastic
capsule and
its
tense ligament.
This
consciousness
of imperfect
vision being conveyed to the brain, the
brain sends its orders through the appropriate nerves
to the ciliary muecle which

effect of which on the

Priestly Smith ('Brit. Med. Journal,' 6th Dec. 1873,) has shown
by galvanic experiments on the enucleated eye of a rabbit that vascular
turgescence has nothing
to do with the changes in the crystalline lens
during accommodation.
On the other hand Mr. Norton ('Brit. Med.
Journal,'
27th Dec.
1873)
says
that
though
part
of
the
increased
convexity in accommodation may be caused by the action of the ciliary
muscle and iris,
it
is kept up by strangling the small
vessels and
re-
taining the blood in them like erectile tissue.

convex shape
;
its focus is thereby shortened, and the
image of the near object is accurately pictured on the
retina.
When
the
lens
is
thus
relieved of the controlling
pressure by
its
elastic
covering and
ligament,
it
is
supposed
to
become thicker and more convex
an-
teriorly.
It accordingly
is assumed that
its anterior
surface
advances
towards
the
cornea, and
that
its
periphery recedes within the canal of Petit.*
71. Now this
is
a very pretty explanation indeed
;
the
only
question
is,
is
it
true
.?
The advance
of
the
anterior
surface
of
the
lens
and
its
increased
convexity must be accompanied by a diminution of
its
peripherical
circumference.
Has
this diminution
been observed
.?
Otto Becker and Coccius say that
they have observed this recession of the periphery of
the
lens
in the eyes of
albinos, and
in
cases where
iridectomy had been performed.
On the other hand.
Von Graefe was unable to see any such recession
in a
case where the whole
iris was
accidentally removed,
and
in which
the accommodation
faculty remained
intact,
though
the
catoptric phenomena, above
de-
scribed, were plainly
visible
; and Bonders
failed to

discover any such
i-ecession
in eyes
in which
iridec-
tomy had
been
performed.
Thus
the
weight
of
authority is rather against the occurrence of a diminu-
tion of the
peripheral
circumference
of the
lens
in
accommodation for near vision, and the above expla-
nation remains a doubtful hypothesis.
Then with regard to the hypothesis of the supposed
increased
convexity
of
the
crystalline
lens
being
occasioned by the contraction of the
ciliary muscle
causing diminution of the tension of the elastic struc-
tures enveloping the lens, and thus allowing the
lens
to assume
its normal
form, which
is
alleged
to be
more convex than
it
is when these
elastic envelopes
are not relaxed by the action of the ciliary muscle
if
this view is to be accepted we encounter this
little
difficulty, viz. that in advanced life
distant accommo-
dation
remains
perfect,
while
the
faculty
of
near
accommodation
is
diminished
or
lost.
Hence we
must believe that the tension of the capsule with
its
connexions remains unimpaired or even
increases
in
old
age,
while
the
muscular power
of
the
ciliary
muscle
declines
or
is
altogether
lost.
Does
it
not
seem highly improbable that the supposed tension of
these delicate structures should continue unimpaired or
even increase with advancing years—for many presby-
optics require a convex
lens even
for distant vision

Again, what reason
is
there
for supposing
that the
muscular
power
of
the
ciliary muscle
is
so much
impaired in old age when we find that the power of a
neighbouring and analogous muscle, the circular fibres
of the
iris,
is rather increased in old age, seeing that
the pupil
as a
rule becomes more contracted as we
grow older ?
In normal or emmetropic eyes the limits of distinct
vision vary much with age.
Fellenberg says that at
ten years of age the
" near point," that
is, the mini-
mum
distance
at which an
object can be
seen
dis-
tinctly,
is

inches
;
at
fifty, 12
inches
;
at
sixty,
24 inches
;
and
at
seventy,

The
" far
point "
of
distinct
vision
for normal eyes
is
infinite
distance
at
all ages
; but as before stated, many old
persons require a convex lens
for the
distinct vision
of even distant objects.
The gradual increase of this
" near
point,"
as
years
increase, may,
I
think,
be
satisfactorily accounted
for by the flattening of the
eye lenses.
That the cornea which gives its shape to
the anterior aqueous lens becomes
flatter in old age
has been generally remarked, and
I am convinced by

is
that
the action
of

72. Let us now consider the
catoptric phenomena
that have been observed in the change of accommoda-
tion from distant to near vision.
When a candle
is
placed on one side of the eye and the observer looks
at the eye on the
level of the candle flame from the
other
side,
three
images
of
the
candle
flame
are
observed
in the
pupil
:
i,
a
large,
distinct, upright
image of the flame on the side nearest the candle, the
reflexion from the surface of the cornea
;
2, a large
indistinct, upright image of the candle flame near the
centre
of the
pupil,
the
reflexion
of
the
anterior
surface of the crystalline lens
; and
3, a small inverted
image of the flame on the side most remote from the
candle, the reflexion from the posterior surface of the
crystalline
lens.
In
the
figures
given
by Cramer
(Fig.
24)

image,
its
size
being
slightly
diminished.
In
the
figure given by Bonders (Fig. 25) of the same pheno-
menon, the image reflected by the anterior surface of
the
lens moves more markedly towards the corneal
image, while
it undergoes an even greater diminution
in size.
In the figure given by Helmholtz (Fig. 26) no
lateral movement is indicated, the image is only repre-
sented
as diminished
in
size
in accommodation
for
near vision, but he says it generally moves towards the
centre of
the
pupil.
Had
he always observed
this
movement towards the centre of the
pupil, he would
doubtless have said so, but
his language leads us to
suppose that it sometimes did not appear to move
in
the indicated direction, and possibly that
it was occa-
sionally observed to move in the opposite direction.
73. In order to observe the changes that occur in
the image
of
the
candle
flame
reflected
from
the
anterior surface of the
crystalline
lens
I
constructed
an apparatus
similar
in
principle
to
that used and
devised by Cramer, but modified
in such a way that
I could at will observe the eye from either side, while
the candle was placed at the opposite
side.
While
the eye under observation was steadily fixed on an
object
right
in
front of
it,
the
light of the
candle
impinged on the eye at a small angle on one side of
the
line of vision, and
I looked at the eye through

a
microscope
of
i-inch
focus
placed
at
a
similar
angfle
to
the
line
of
vision
on
its
other
side.
In
this way
I could see the three images of the candle
as they were reflected respectively from the cornea,
the anterior surface and the posterior si r-face of the
crystalline lens (Fig. 29). Seen through the microscope
the images are of course all reversed, but I represent
them here in
their true
position.
The large
distinct
upright image
is the reflexion from the cornea
; the
small
inverted image
is the
reflexion from the pos-
terior surface of the
crystalline lens
; the dim
large
image between these two
is
the
reflexion from
the
anterior surface of the lens.
It
is always extremely
indistinct
in
normal
eyes,
and
looks
like
the
ghost
of an image when
contrasted with
the
clear,
well-defined images
reflected from
the
cornea
and
posterior
surface
of
the
lens.
The
cause
of
this
indistinctness and want of definition is
the very slight
convexity of the central part of the anterior curva-
ture of the
lens.
In some myopic eyes
I have ex-
amined, where the myopia was
evidently,
in
part
at
least, owing to the abnormal convexity of the anterior
surface of the lens, the image of the candle flame
is
much more distinct and considerably smaller.

towards the corneal image

is the

Had

it is obvious that the movement observed would

vexity, to wit, the
centre of the
pupil.
But, on
the
contrary, in both instances the reflected image moves
towards
the
external
edge
of
the
pupil,
showing
that the actual change
in the
crystalline
is merely a
change in the direction or slope of its anterior surface,
and that
this
is produced by a
slight movement of
rotation of the lens on
its vertical
axis from without
inwards.
The
slight
diminution
in
the
size
of
the
image shows
that
it
is now
reflected
from a
more
convex part of the lens.
This
is accounted for by the
actual shape of
this surface of the
lens, which is, as
formerly pointed out, not spherical but ellipsoidal, viz.
an ellipse of revolution round the shorter
axis, or, as
Sir J. Herschel calls
it, an oblate spheroid (Fig. 14, L).
Hence the centre is the flattest or least curved portion
of the ellipsoidal surface, and consequently the reflected
image
Avill
be larger when reflected from the
centre
than from any other point of the surface, as
it rapidly
increases in convexity from the centre outwards.
The
movement
of rotation
causes
the
candle
flame
to
be
reflected from a more convex portion of the
lens,
hence its diminution in size.
75.
But,
it may be
asked, how
will the supposed
obliquity of the lens
in accommodation from distant
to
near
vision, have
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
length
of the
focus
of
the
lens, and
thus
focusing
the picture accurately on the retina, which was before

75
focused behind
the
retina ?
To
this
I
reply that
any one may convince himself that in an ordinary lens
with
spherical
surfaces, a marked diminution of the
length of the focus
is produced by presenting the lens
obliquely to
the
object.
If this
takes
place
in
the
case of a lens with spherical contours, in which the
whole
surface
is uniformly convex,
it will be much
more marked
in a lens of the ellipsoidal shape of the
crystalline lens, where the movement of rotation brings
a more convex portion of the lens into the axis of vision.
76. To
this view
it may be
objected that
in the
case
of
ordinary
glass
lenses
an
oblique
position
causes the image depicted on the screen to be distorted
by what is called spherical aberration of rays.
True,
but the contours of such lenses are spherical, whereas
the
shape
of the
surface
of the
crystalline
lens
is
ellipsoidal, whereby little or no distortion
is produced,
as
that
is
precisely the shape which was found by
Descartes to obviate the spherical aberration of rays.
But even with lenses of spherical contour, this aberra-
tion with consequent
distortion of the image thrown
on
the
screen may be
corrected
by
interposing
a
diaphragm with a small opening between the object
and the lens.
And
in the eye, as if to guard against
the possibility of distortion by aberration of rays, the
diaphragm interposed between the object and the lens,
I mean the
iris, diminishes the size of

;
that
is to say, when
the lens
is, according to my supposition, presented ob-
liquely to the
object.*
Hence, there is no
possibility
of a distorted image of the object being thrown on the
yellow spot of the retina, which is the only part of the
retina capable of accurately perceiving the image of
objects.
There is
still another
provision
in the eye
for obviating spherical aberration, and that is that the
lenses of the eye
are a combination of the meniscus
(aqueous humour) and double convex
lens

* The power of a small orifice to correct the greatest amount of dis-
tortion from interfering rays
is shown by a simple experiment.
The
normal
eye
of an
adult cannot
see

read small
print nearer than
6 inches.
Within that distance the type becomes more indistinct the
closer
it approaches
the eye.
But
if we make a pinhole
through a
card and place
it close to the eye, we can see
to read printed matter
of any size even as near as half an inch from the eye.
At that distance
we can even see the texture of fine cambric with microscopic definition.
The cause of this
is
easily explicable from wliat we have before said
regarding the course of rays of light impinging on the centre of a lens.
The rays striking the lens in this part perpendicularly suffer no refrac-
tion.
The
effect of the pinhole
is to exclude
all rays but those that
impinge perpendicularly on the centre of the eye lenses.
Hence the
image of the object close in front of the eye
is pictured on the retina
without
the

Herschel
to prevent spherical aberration in ordinary

77. There
is,
moreover, a provision
in the optical
construction
of the
eye
to guard
against chromatic
aberration, by which
term
is understood
that
ten-
dency of a lens to throw an indistinct image on the
screen by reason of the different refrangibility of the
different
coloured rays of light.
Thus the violet ray
is most refracted
in passing obliquely through a

least.

the inter-

side of the spectrum would
be focused short of the screen, while the rays on the
other side towards the red side of the spectrum would
be focused behind the screen.
In optical instruments
this
chromatic

is
got
rid of by using
a

its substance.
Its

It has been objected to my explanation of the
change that occurs
in the position of the crystalline
lens
in accommodation
from
distant
to
near vision,
that
I have not shown how
this change
is brought
about by the action of the ciliary muscle.
Consider-
ing the
utter
failure by those who contend
for an
increased
convexity
of the
crystalline
lens
in
near
accommodation
to show how this could be brought
about by the action of the ciliary muscle, it might be
the convex surface of the anterior aqueous lens, and thus changes the
meniscus form of the aqueous lens into a concavo-convex lens.
The
movement of rotation of the
crystalline lens, which,
according
to my
view, occurs in near accommodation, will virtually have the same effect
on the anterior aqueous lens
as
its increased convexity,
for owing to
the peculiar oblate spheroidal or ellipsoidal form of the anterior surface
of the
ciystalline
lens, the rotation brings a more convex portion of
the lens into the pupil
; moreover, as before shown, the more oblique
position as regards incident rays of a lens of even spherical contours is
equivalent to an increase of its convexity.

an independent examination of many eyes of animals,
enable me to offer, as I think, a very probable account
of the part played by the ciliary muscle in effecting the

of
the

lens
in

accommodation.
Let us examine the position and distribution of the

of the

that we may

con-
cern the point we are at
present inquiring
into.
The
ciliary muscle
consists
of two
parts
not
distinctly
Separated, but running
into one
another.
It
arises
from
the
internal wall
of Schlemm's
canal,
s, and
from
the
pectinated ligament
of the
iris,
/, which
is
the
reflected portion of the membrane of Descemet.
The
outer
or
meridional
longitudinal
fibres, M, run
parallel with the sclerotic, and are inserted
into the
choroid membrane
; the inner radiating fibres, R, are
distributed to the ciliary processes.
(H. Miiller says

Action of Ciliary Muscle.
8i
the
innermost of these
fibres
constitute an annular
muscle, which he terms the compressor
lentis, though
how it compresses the lens in the position
it occupies
is not very clear.)
Now
it
is beyond a doubt
that the origin of the
muscle
at the canal
of Schlemm
is
its fixed
point.
The fibres there terminate in a dense fibrous structure,
called by some the tendon of the ciliary muscle, which
is merged in the substance of the cornea.
The other
end of the longitudinal fibres extends to the choroid,
in which
these
fibres are spread out and
lost; the
radiating
fibres spread out
in the substance of
the
ciliary process.
Now what must be the effect of the
contraction of this muscle, which I prefer to consider
as
a whole, and
not,
as some authors
assert, as two
distinct muscles ?
Evidently it will pull forward the
choroid membrane
(the
muscle
is sometimes called
teftsor
chorioidece) and
the
ciliary
processes, and
if
we accept the existence of an annular muscle,
this
will only
assist
the
radiating
fibres
in
pulling
the
ciliary processes
still farther forwards and inwards.*
•
I am
aware
that Dr. Hemy Lawson ('Monthly Microscopical
Journal,'
Oct.
1869), from an
examination of the
eye of pheasants,
comes to the conclusion that the action of the ciliary muscle is just the
reverse of this,
viz.
that
it pulls upon
and retracts the periphery of
the cornea, thus causing
its centre to bulge and become more convex
;
but seeing that in other animals no increase of convexity in the cornea

SujDposing one side of the muscle only to be thrown
into action, what effect will be produced ? The choroid
membrane
encloses
and
is
firmly
attached
to
the
vitreous humour, therefore the traction exercised by
the
muscle on
the
choroid
will move
the
vitreous
humour forwards and inwards, and
this motion
will
be carried on to the corresponding edge of the crystal-
line lens.
But the radiating fibres, R, draw the ciliary
processes,
Ci, forwards and inwards, and the
ciliary
processes are intimately connected with the anterior
thickened
process
of the
hyaloid membrane,
called
here the zonule
of Zinn
;
so
intimately,
indeed,
are
the
ciliary processes dovetailed and united with the
portion
of
the
zonule

they

it

muscle on
the
cornea, as
it

I have
dis-
sected numerous eyes
of pheasants
and can
testify
to the
size
and
distinctness of the
ciliary muscle.
In other respects the optical con-
struction differs from that of the human eye
chiefly in these respects
:
the globe is much flatter, the ciystalline lens
is veiy thick,
its anterior
surface very slightly convex, while the posterior surface is very convex,
but the shape of the curvature very distinctly that of an oblate spheroid,
so that an oblique position must very sensibly shorten its focus.

ciliary processes adhering to the zonule.
The zonule,
z, after quitting the ciliaif
- processes, passes on to the
anterior wall of the lenticular capsule, with which
it
becomes blended a little beyond the edge of the lens,
and this portion
is sometimes
called the siispensory
ligame?tt of the crystalline
lens.
Hence the forward
movement of the
ciliary processes will assist
in pull-
ing the lens forward, and thus give it the rotary move-
ment on its axis I before described, whereby its focus
is shortened so as to form a distinct picture of a near
object on the retina.
79. This
rotary motion
is
only
possible
on
the
supposition that the contraction of the ciliary muscle
takes place on one side only in accommodation
for
near vision, whilst the muscle on the opposite side of
the eye is in a state of relaxation.
80. There seems
to me no reason
to
doubt
that
contraction of the
ciliary muscle may take place in
one
portion
of the
muscle
at
a
time.
The motor
nerve that supplies the ciliary muscle is derived from
the third pair, which also regulates the movement of
the circular muscle of the
iris (which
is contracted
during near accommodation),
and of several
of the
external
muscles
of the
eye which
are capable
of
independent movements.
81.
It may be objected
to my view that the ex-

ternal portion of both ciliary muscles
is brought into
action
at the same time
ill accommodation
for near
vision
; whereas in the movements of the eyeball, while
the external muscle of one eye
is in action, the internal
muscle of the other eye is contracted.
But in accom-
modation
for near vision
this
is not
so, for the two
internal recti act simultaneously, causing convergence
of the ball, or a slight internal squint
; so that there
is no improbability, but on the contrary by analogy
a strong probability, that the external portions of the
ciliary muscle of both eyes may act simultaneously,
as
the
catoptric phenomena
indicate.
In voluntary
inward-squinting we
find
that we
naturally accom-
modate the eyes for near vision in the act of squinting.
82.
It frequently happens that obscure points of the
anatomy and physiology of human
organs may be
illuminated by an examination of the corresponding
organs in other animals.
Comparative anatomy and
physiology have thrown a flood of light on our know-
ledge of the structure and functions of the human frame,
and they may assist us in
ari'iving at correct conclu-
sions with respect to the action of the ciliary muscle.
In the
' Journal of Anatomy and Physiology
' for No-
vember, 1868, there
is an interesting paper by Mr. R.
J. Lee on the ciliary muscle in fishes, birds, and quad-
rupeds, which corroborates most strikingly the views

Comparative Anatomy of Ciliary Muscle.
85
I have put
forward.
In
this paper Mr. Lee shows
that the cihary muscle is absent in fishes, in which, as
I have said above, the crystalline lens is of a spherical-
form, and hence no rotary movement could
affect its
refractive power;
therefore no
provision
is made for
altering its position.
The iris of fishes, as Haller long
ago remarked, does not move.
This absence of a ciliary
muscle, and
this immobility of the
iris, preclude the
idea of an accommodative change in the eyes of fishes.
On the other hand, the cat, which has a great range of
accommodating power, has an extremely mobile
iris,
and
its
ciliary muscle
is highly developed.
It
arises
from the anterior border of the sclerotic close to the
margin
of the
cornea, and passes backward
to
the
choroid, forming so intimate a connexion with it as to
appear
really a part
of
that
membrane.
But
it
is
especially in birds of the predacious sort, such as owls
and falcons, that the accommodative faculty exists in
the greatest perfection.
In them the
ciliary muscle
is comparatively large, and
its longitudinal fibres can
be traced to their insertion
in the choroid at a con-
siderable distance from
its anterior termination.
By
their contraction the choroid is drawn forwards, carry-
ing with
it
the crystalline
lens.
There are likewise
two rows
of elastic
fibres between the
sclerotic and
choroid, which
yield

the
ciliary
muscle,
but which
serve
to
replace
the
choroid in its former position when the muscular con-
traction of the ciliary muscle is relaxed.
" The whole
arrangement
described," says Mr.
Lee,
"is intended
for
the
alteration
of
the
position
of
the
crystal-
line lens."
He then goes on to say
:
" The
result of
the numerous dissections which I have made leads me
to consider that the various theories which have been
advanced at different times to explain the means by
which the eye is enabled to adjust itself for distance,
are
inconsistent with
the anatomy of the organ of
vision, and
I
trust that
it
will not be thought
pre-
sumptuous to express my belief that this phenomenon
will be found to be explicable by the simple law of
optical
science, which
requires
nothing more than a
change
in the
relative
position of the
lens and the
retina to accommodate the sight to near and distant
objects."
What
this change
of
relative
position
of
lens and retina is I have endeavoured to show.
83.
It has been observed that the time occupied in
accommodating the eye for near vision is greater than
that required
for adapting
it to
distant vision
; and
this is strikingly obvious in viewing the movements of
the
candle-flame image
reflected from
the
anterior
surface
of
the
crystalline
lens.
While
the
image
moves slowly into
its place when the eye

directed

87
to a near object,
it springs rapidly back to its original
seat when the eye
is
directed
to
a
distant
object.
The cause of this is obvious, for in near accommoda-
tion the force of the ciliary muscle is exerted in over-
coming the resistance of elastic structures in order to
rotate the lens on
its axis, whereas when the change
takes
place
to
distant
accommodation
the
elastic
forces and the internal portion of the muscle
acting
together cause the lens to resume
its normal position
with great velocity.
84.
If the transition from near to distant accommo-
dation takes place in the dark, there occurs, as Czermak*
has remarked, a sudden flash of light in the eye, which
he
calls a phosphhie.
This phenomenon
is, I believe,
caused by the sudden springing back of the lens to
its normal unaccommodated position, communicating
a shock to the retina whereby the sensation of light
is evoked, just as a
slight blow on the eye will pro-
duce the sensation of a flash of light.
At the same
time the sudden relaxation of the
ciliary muscle
or
tensor
chorioidese, permitting the
strained
choroid
membrane to resume
its
position,
will intensify the
shock that produces the flash.
85. Another proof of the correctness

commodation for near vision is afforded by the obser-
vations
of Knapp, Adamuk, and
Woinow,*
to
the
effect that the centre of the pupil moves at the same
time towards the nasal side, consequently in the same
direction as the
lens.
This movement does not take
place
in
contraction of
the pupil occurring without
accommodative alteration in the eye.
These authors
hence infer that the crystalline lens produces this side-
ward movement of the pupil in accommodation.
This
is an
important
observation, as
it
proves beyond a
doubt that one side only of the ciliary muscle
is con-
tracted
in near accommodation, that
this
is the ex-
ternal
side, and that the
effect of the action of the
muscle
is
to cause the lens to communicate a move-
ment
to the
iris which pushes
the
pupil somewhat
towards the inner or nasal
side.
The only possible
movement of the lens whereby this could be produced
is the rotary one I have described, and which the dis-
tribution of the muscular fibres of the ciliary muscle
is exactly fitted to accomplish.
86. Whether
the
external
portion
of the
ciliary
muscle is the agent in the production of near accom-
modation in all positions of the eye
I am unable to
determine.

accommodation in respect to objects situated directly
in front and on the level of the eye itself.
It may be
that when the eye is directed upwards or downwards,
and at the same time accommodated
for near vision,
some other portions of the ciliary muscle are brought
into play and the axis of rotation of the lens is varied
accordingly.
The intimate connexion of the action
of the external portions of the ciliary muscles with that
of the two internal
recti muscles, might lead
us
to
suppose that when other external ocular muscles
are
brought
into
play, other parts of the
ciliary muscle
may
likewise
act
in accommodation.
But
this
is a
speculation that need not detain us.
87. I do not think much importance can attach to the
increased thickness of the crystalline lens observed after
death.
Helmholtz and others have founded on
this
fact their explanation of the act of near accommoda-
tion,
viz. that the ciystalline lens
is forcibly retained
in the condition of accommodation for distance by the
elastic tension of the zonule of
Zinn, and
that the
effect of the
contraction of the
ciliary muscle
is
to
relax this tension, and so enable the lens to assume
the more convex form its own inherent elasticity im-
presses
on
it;

it is alleged to assume
in near accommodation
is the
form
it
will
naturally assume when
freed
from
re-
straint.
But besides the objections to this view above
stated there is this further objection, that the increased
size of the
lens which has long been known to occur
after death
is apparently caused by absorption of the
aqueous humour by
the
tubules
of
the
lens
and
around the
lens beneath
its
capsule.
The
so-called
liquor Morgagni, which is found between the capsule
and
lens,
is
now
generally
believed
to
be
merely
aqueous humour
received
into
the
capsule by
en-
dosmose post mortem. Very soon after death the trans-
parency of the crystalline lens in the human subject
becomes materially impaired, showing that something
has occurred to diminish
its dioptric properties, and
this something is no doubt absorption of the aqueous
humour, which will account at once for
its
increased
thickness and its loss of transparency.
88.
In order to put my views to a
still more
strin-
gent test, I constructed a working model of the eye of
large
size, in
fact with dimensions ten times greater
than the human eye.
The curvatures of the various
refracting media in the eye being ellipsoidal, of course
I
could
not
imitate them
exactly, but
I employed
spherical
curvatures
as
near the mark
as
possible.
The
globe
of
the
eye
is
represented by
a
glass

Large Model of the Htmtan Eye.
9
globe
24
centimetres
in
diameter,
with
a
hole cut
out in
front
for the reception of a section of a globe
of 8 centimetres radius, to represent the cornea.
This
of
course
is
left
clear,
but
the
larger globe
repre-
senting the sclerotic is painted black inside and white
outside, a circular clear space being left in the axis of
vision to show the picture formed on the
retina. A
diaphragm
of vulcanized
indiarubber
is
suspended
3
centimetres
behind
the
cornea
to
represent
the
iris, perforated with a hole to imitate the pupil mode-
rately
dilated.
The
crystalline
lens
is made
with
two segments of globes
respectively 10 and 6 centi-
metres radius of curvature, to represent the anterior
and posterior surfaces of the
lens, and
5
centimetres
thick in the centre.
These segments are united edge
to edge by a brass ring, and the space thus formed
is
filled with a mixture of glycerine and water in equal
proportions, which has a refi-active power correspond-
ing to that of the crystalline lens.
The aqueous and
vitreous humours are represented by water, with which
the globe is filled.
An object placed at a distance of
about 15 feet is accurately pictured in the clear space
left at the back of the globe, representing the retina in
the axis of vision.
On bringing the object nearer to
the model eye the focus
is thrown behind the globe.
At a distance of 8^
feet the object
is
as much out

gi

of
focus
as
it
would
be
at
lo
inches
in
the
un-
accommodated
emmetropic human
eye.
A
slight
rotary motion of the
artificial lens shortens the focus
so as to bring
it again accurately to the back of the
globe corresponding to the retina in the axis of vision.
If a candle is placed at one side of the eye and we
look into the pupil from the opposite side, the images
of the candle
reflected respectively from the cornea,
anterior surface
of the
lens, and posterior surface
of
the lens, are plainly visible, the two former erect and
large, the third inverted and small.
When the rotary
motion
is given to the lens
in order to accommodate
the focus to
a
near
object
(at 8J
feet), the
image
reflected by the anterior surface of the lens is seen to
move in precisely the same way as I have described as
occurring in the human eye in near accommodation.
