Unsurpassed Technical Support
RedBuilt has one of the largest networks of technical representatives in the 
business. Their services include consultation, computer-assisted design 
and layout, delivery coordination, and installation review. They can suggest 
cost-reduction techniques and check special application requirements. In 
addition, they’re backed by a staff of professional engineers who provide 
comprehensive technical support when needed. Special requests are 
accommodated wherever practical, and they offer cost analysis, engineering 
analysis, assistance with building code approvals — even the creation of special 
product applications for more creative designs. The goal of RedBuilt technical 
support is to help architects and engineers achieve quality design applications 
with the most cost-efﬁ cient product selection possible.
Products for Every Application
In addition to open-web trusses, RedBuilt offers a variety of other engineered 
lumber products that are ideal for use in commercial and custom residential 
projects. For more information, contact your RedBuilt technical representative 
or visit redbuilt.com to download literature for products such as Red-I™ joists 
and RedLam™ LVL.
Our network of technical representatives offers a 
wide range of services to help guide your  projects 
through planning and construction.
Resource Efﬁ ciency
Consider all of the positive attributes of wood when selecting your building material of choice. In addition to its 
structural properties, high strength-to-weight ratio, and ease of construction, wood is a naturally occurring, renewable 
resource that requires less energy to produce than steel or concrete. And it sequesters carbon — whether on the stump 
or in your structure.
Our RedBuilt™ open-web trusses with RedLam™ LVL chords, as well as other RedBuilt™ products, are made with 
responsibly sourced ﬁ ber. Whether you’re looking for LEED® certiﬁ cation or simply want to ensure efﬁ cient use of raw 
materials, we can help. By making better use of every tree, RedBuilt produces cost-effective, consistently available 
engineered wood products that reduce environmental impact. The result is a quality wood product that offers superior 
strength and reliable performance.
Product Selection
This guide provides speciﬁ ers with technical information about the RedBuilt™ open-web truss product line. 
However, complex or custom applications can often make specifying the right products in the right places a 
challenge — especially when you have factors such as span, wind or load-carrying capacity and other design 
constraints to consider. But whatever your project entails, RedBuilt is here to help. Your local RedBuilt technical 
representative, along with our Design Center teams, can assist you in choosing the best products and designing the 
best system for your speciﬁ c application. 
Contact us for help with any of the following:
· Product selection
· Building department calculations
· Complete cost analysis
·  System selection (system packages can include horizontal framing, main 
carrying beams, headers, wall framing, mansard framing, and accessories)

HOW TO SPECIFY TRUSSES FOR MAXIMUM ECONOMY
DESIGN CENTER SERVICES
Upon request, RedBuilt can provide the following services 
for the products described in this Open-Web Truss Speciﬁ er’s 
Guide: 
·  A complete design package including layout drawings 
 (placement diagrams) and detailed design  calculations.
·  Review and analysis of the application.
·  Drawings or calculations sealed by a professional engineer.
Our technical support team offers professional capabilities in the 
design and application of all RedBuilt™ products.
Installation Review
Although responsibility for proper installation lies with the 
contractor-builder, RedBuilt provides detailed suggestions 
and guidelines for installation. If requested, a RedBuilt 
representative will visit the site to verify the contractor’s 
understanding of proper installation. RedBuilt professional 
engineers also are available to help solve jobsite application 
problems. 
Engineering Responsibility Position Statement
RedBuilt is a manufacturer of proprietary structural 
components. 
It employs a staff of professional engineers to aid in the 
development, manufacture, and marketing of its products. 
RedBuilt does not replace or accept the responsibility of the 
design professional of record for any structure.
RedBuilt accepts the delegation of engineering responsibility 
only for the products it manufactures, provided that the 
application conditions are speciﬁ ed by the design professional 
of record, or other responsible party when a design professional 
is not engaged. RedBuilt provides engineering in the design of 
its products and does not displace the need on any project for a 
design professional of record.
It is in the designer's best interest to specify the most economically efﬁ cient materials and ensure that their customers are not 
paying extra for structural components that are oversized for the given loads. However, specifying a minimum depth truss with 
the maximum plf loading (as shown in the load tables on pages 6–11) may not be the most economical solution. 
Designing to the maximum depth allowed for the application, and not maximizing loads in tables, will produce the most 
economical solution. Keep this and the following two examples in mind when consulting the load tables in this guide:

Top chord bearing at each end provides the easiest installation and the most cost-effective truss system. Note that these are 
general guidelines only and they are not reﬂ ective of all applications. Consult your local RedBuilt technical representative to 
assist you in specifying the most economical truss solutions for your particular applications.

In radius truss applications (Proﬁ les 5, 6, 7, 9, 
and 10), allowable loads are reduced due to 
radial stresses. Contact your RedBuilt technical 
representative for job-speciﬁ c possibilities.
Maximum top chord slope for Proﬁ le 4 (Radius 
Pitched) is ½ :12 for Red-L™ and Red-W™ truss 
series, and 3⁄8  :12 for Red-S™ truss series.
 Indicates that the profile is available.
Open-web trusses are intended for dry use, 
untreated applications.

Load Tables
RED-L™ TRUSS ALLOWABLE UNIFORM LOAD TABLE (PLF) / PARALLEL CHORD
General Notes
·  Values shown demonstrate maximum allowable load capacities based on 
the following assumptions:
 –  Simple span, uniformly loaded conditions, with provisions for  positive 
drainage (¼ :12 slope, minimum) in roof applications.
 –  Span indicates distance from inside face to inside face of bearing. 
 –  Top chord no-notch bearing clips with 1¾" bearing. Higher values may be 
possible with other types of bearing clips.
Trusses delivered to the jobsite are custom manufactured to resist only project speciﬁ c application loads provided by the design professional. Actual trusses may not 
be able to resist the maximum loads shown in the tables above. For questions regarding actual truss capacity contact your RedBuilt technical representative.
·  Straight line interpolations may be made between depths and spans.
·  Values in shaded areas may be increased 7% for repetitive-member use.
·  Bold italic values are controlled by minimum concentrated load analysis 
of 2,000 lbs. Higher loads are  possible where minimum concentrated 
load analysis is not required by code. Contact your RedBuilt technical 
representative for assistance.

SEE PAGE 4 FOR ECONOMICAL TRUSS DESIGN
To size ﬂ oor trusses:
Check both total load (100% TL) and live load (100% LL). When live load is not 
shown, total load will control. Total load values limit deﬂ ection to L/240. Live 
load values are based on the Commercial Floor Deﬂ ection Limit shown on 
page 35, and assume a nailed ﬂ oor system. Live load (100% LL) values may 
be increased with a glue-nailed ﬂ oor system; contact your RedBuilt technical 
representative for  assistance.
Trusses delivered to the jobsite are custom manufactured to resist only project speciﬁ c application loads provided by the design professional. Actual trusses may not 
be able to resist the maximum loads shown in the tables above. For questions regarding actual truss capacity contact your RedBuilt technical representative.
To size roof trusses:
Check the appropriate snow load area (115% TL) or non-snow load area 
(125% TL) value to determine the maximum allowable total load. Total load 
(115% TL and 125% TL) values limit truss deﬂ ection to L/180.
Consult local codes to verify deﬂ ection limits required for speciﬁ c  applications.
· See page 5 for available depths and profiles. For depths and profiles not shown, contact your RedBuilt technical representative for assistance.
· Red numbers refer to 115% Total Load (TL).

Load Tables
RED-W™ TRUSS ALLOWABLE UNIFORM LOAD TABLE (PLF) / PARALLEL CHORD
General Notes
·  Values shown demonstrate maximum allowable load capacities based on 
the following assumptions:
 –  Simple span, uniformly loaded conditions, with provisions for  positive 
drainage (¼ :12 slope, minimum) in roof applications.
 –  Span indicates distance from inside face to inside face of bearing. 
 –  Top chord no-notch bearing clips with 2¾" bearing for Red-W™ trusses and 
standard bearing clips for Red-S™ trusses. Higher values may be possible 
with other types of bearing clips.
·  Straight line interpolations may be made between depths and spans.
·  Values in shaded areas may be increased for repetitive-member use as 
follows: 7% for Red-W™ trusses and 4% for Red-S™ trusses.
·  Bold italic values are controlled by minimum concentrated load analysis 
of 2,000 lbs. Higher loads are  possible where minimum concentrated 
load analysis is not required by code. Contact your RedBuilt technical 
representative for assistance.

· Red numbers refer to 115% Total Load (TL).
General Notes continued on page 9
Trusses delivered to the jobsite are custom manufactured to resist only project speciﬁ c application loads provided by the design professional. Actual trusses may not 
be able to resist the maximum loads shown in the tables above. For questions regarding actual truss capacity contact your RedBuilt technical representative.

Load Tables
RED-S™ TRUSS ALLOWABLE UNIFORM LOAD TABLE (PLF) / PARALLEL CHORD
To size ﬂ oor trusses:
Check both total load (100% TL) and live load (100% LL). When live load is not 
shown, total load will control. Total load values limit deﬂ ection to L/240. Live 
load values are based on the Commercial Floor Deﬂ ection Limit shown on 
page 35, and assume a nailed ﬂ oor system. Live load (100% LL) values may 
be increased with a glue-nailed ﬂ oor system; contact your RedBuilt technical 
representative for  assistance.
To size roof trusses:
Check the appropriate snow load area (115% TL) or non-snow load area 
(125% TL) value to determine the maximum allowable total load. Total load 
(115% TL and 125% TL) values limit truss deﬂ ection to L/180.
Consult local codes to verify deﬂ ection limits required for speciﬁ c  applications.

· Red numbers refer to 115% Total Load (TL).
General Notes continued from page 8
Trusses delivered to the jobsite are custom manufactured to resist only project speciﬁ c application loads provided by the design professional. Actual trusses may not 
be able to resist the maximum loads shown in the tables above. For questions regarding actual truss capacity contact your RedBuilt technical representative.

Load Tables
RED-M™ TRUSS ALLOWABLE UNIFORM LOAD TABLE (PLF) / PARALLEL CHORD
General Notes
·  Values shown demonstrate maximum allowable load capacities based on 
the following assumptions:
 –  Simple span, uniformly loaded conditions, with provisions for  positive 
drainage (¼ :12 slope, minimum) in roof applications.
 –  Span indicates distance from inside face to inside face of bearing. 
 –  Top chord Z bearing clips for Red-M™ and Red-H™ trusses. Higher values 
may be possible with other types of bearing clips.
·  Straight line interpolations may be made between depths and spans.
·  Bold italic values are controlled by minimum concentrated load analysis 
of 2,000 lbs. Higher loads are  possible where minimum concentrated 
load analysis is not required by code. Contact your RedBuilt technical 
representative for assistance.

General Notes continued on page 11
Trusses delivered to the jobsite are custom manufactured to resist only project speciﬁ c application loads provided by the design professional. Actual trusses may not 
be able to resist the maximum loads shown in the tables above. For questions regarding actual truss capacity contact your RedBuilt technical representative.

Load Tables
RED-H™ TRUSS ALLOWABLE UNIFORM LOAD TABLE (PLF) / PARALLEL CHORD
To size ﬂ oor trusses:
Check both total load (100% TL) and live load (100% LL). When live load is not 
shown, total load will control. Total load values limit deﬂ ection to L/240. Live 
load values are based on the Commercial Floor Deﬂ ection Limit shown on 
page 35, and assume a nailed ﬂ oor system. Live load (100% LL) values may 
be increased with a glue-nailed ﬂ oor system; contact your RedBuilt technical 
representative for  assistance.
To size roof trusses:
Check the appropriate snow load area (115% TL) or non-snow load area 
(125% TL) value to determine the maximum allowable total load. Total load 
(115% TL and 125% TL) values limit truss deﬂ ection to L/180.
Consult local codes to verify deﬂ ection limits required for speciﬁ c  applications.

Trusses delivered to the jobsite are custom manufactured to resist only project speciﬁ c application loads provided by the design professional. Actual trusses may not 
be able to resist the maximum loads shown in the tables above. For questions regarding actual truss capacity contact your RedBuilt technical representative.

Beveled plate required at all slopes
Common
Beveled bearing plates are required for trusses 
with sloped top chords. 
Beveled plates serve two functions:
1. Provide proper bearing for the bearing clip.
2.  Avoid interference between the top chord 
and the bearing plate.
A beveled plate, to suit roof slope, is 
required at all common bearings and 
cantilevered bearings.

Concentrated and Non-Uniform Loads
For the most efficient use of RedBuilt™ products carrying concentrated loads 
or non-uniform loads, and/or used in conditions other than simple spans, 
consult your RedBuilt technical representative for precise sizing. As a general 
rule, extra members should be added to the system to carry concentrated 
loads such as bearing partitions, air-conditioners, and other mechanical 
equipment. Handling concentrated loads in this  manner usually provides the 
most economical system and also helps ensure more uniform deflection.

Bridging is used to make each truss act with those next to it (load sharing) and minimize or equalize deﬂ ections from non-uniform loads. Bridging should not be 
confused with bracing, which has a different purpose.
Roof Systems usually do not require bridging because differential  deﬂ ections, vibrations, etc. are typically not a problem with roof systems. However, bridging is 
required for load sharing with Red-L™ and Red-W™ trusses because they have  single-member chords and are commonly used in relatively long spans with wide 
on-center spacing.
Floor Systems perform better under typical loads—particularly with regard to deﬂ ection and vibration—if they have an effective bridging system.
Red-S™, Red-M™  and Red-H™ Trusses
Roof: Bridging not required, except for long-span modular-installation applications. See page 32.
Floor: Bridging required at 12' on-center maximum. See  Sawn Lumber Bridging table above for bridging sizes.

Installation Info.
INSTALLATION BRACING
Open-web trusses require installation bracing to prevent lateral buckling of the 
chord members until they are stabilized by connection to the sheathing and 
by permanent bracing of the completed structure (as designed). Installation 
bracing includes strut bracing rows, cross bracing at bottom chord bearing 
conditions, bottom chord restraint, and braced end wall or diaphragm 
restraint adequate to support the strut bracing rows. The criteria used for this 
installation bracing assume either of the following conditions:
·  The truss carries its own weight plus the weight of applied sheathing and two 
250-pound workers concentrated at 1⁄3 points of the span;
 OR
·  An unloaded truss with a 30 mph wind
Bracing for construction loads equivalent to or beyond these loads is the 
responsibility of the installer. Bracing must be installed as each truss is put 
in position. 
All trusses are laterally unstable until properly braced. The longer the span, 
the more care is required. Adequate restraint is necessary at all stages of 
construction.
Complete stability is not achieved until all bracing and decking is completely 
installed and properly fastened.
Installation bracing and procedures, as well as the safety of the workers, are 
the responsibility of the installer.
For more information, see RedBuilt’s Open-Web Truss Installation Guide 
(available online at redbuilt.com).
General Notes 
·  Bottom chord restraints are 1x4 (minimum) 
nailers and are attached to the top of the bottom 
chord with two 8d (2½") nails for double chord 
trusses only. Materials are to be provided by the 
installer.
·  Bridging, when speciﬁ ed, may be used instead of 
bottom chord restraint.
Cross bracing is provided for all open-web 
 trusses at bottom chord bearing conditions. 
Install cross bracing as each truss is set. 
Maximum lateral load is 500 lbs per truss.

INSTALLATION BRACING
Strut Bracing
Installation bracing is required for all open-web truss applications. RedBuilt's 
recommended method for bracing is to use the strut bracing supplied by 
RedBuilt. Strut bracing rows should be spaced equally, per the on-center spacing 
noted in the Required Spacing table below. On roof systems, strut bracing is 
attached to the top of upper chord members. On ﬂ oor systems it is attached to 
the bottom of the upper chord members to avoid interference with the direct 
attachment of sheathing. See detail below.
Bottom Chord Restraint for Red-S™, Red-M™, and Red-H™ Trusses
Attach 1x4 minimum nailer to top of 
bottom chord with two 8d (2½") nails 
in each chord member

LONG SPAN INSTALLATION
RedBuilt™ open-web trusses with spans over 70 feet are 
 available only if all of the following additional requirements 
are satisﬁ ed. Review each of these requirements with your 
RedBuilt representative prior to sizing and detailing our 
 products in any application involving spans beyond 70 feet.
1.  There must be a responsible architect and/or engineer of 
record throughout the design and construction period of 
the project.
2.  The responsible architect or engineer must include the 
following statement in the job speciﬁ cations: 
"The trusses shall be installed in rigid modules at least 8 feet 
in width, accurately assembled in a jig with ﬁ nal sheathing 
permanently and totally attached while on the ground. 
Speciﬁ ed bridging shall be installed in each module as 
detailed."
3.  Only structural panel sheathing will be permitted.
4.  The purchaser-contractor must sign an addendum to our 
standard purchase agreement that contains the above 
requirements.
5.  Prior to execution of the purchase agreement, the 
speciﬁ cations and details of the job must be submitted 
to and reviewed by RedBuilt engineering along with a 
description of the installation procedures proposed to 
be used. Review will be solely with respect to the above 
requirements.
The sketches shown at right show possible rigid modules that 
would satisfy the condition speciﬁ ed in requirement 2 above.

SNOWDRIFT LOADING
TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND ANALYSIS
Analysis Procedure 
RedBuilt™ open-web trusses are analyzed as pin-connected trusses with continuity in the top chord 
member, which receives the superimposed loading. Allowable truss-member forces are designated in 
the product acceptance criteria or derived from material stresses therein. Chord members are analyzed 
considering both net section at panel points and gross sections between the panels. Allowable web 
member forces consider gross and net sections, pin bearing and buckling. Pin-connection details consider 
allowable bearing in the wood for both parallel and perpendicular-to-grain direction. Reaction detail 
analysis includes allowable bearing, induced moments where applicable, and detail stresses. Stress 
and deﬂ ection are calculated by the displacement method. All of the above is  substantiated through 
continual testing.
Product Application Assumptions 
Our warranty is subject to an adequate supporting structure for our products. The design of the entire 
structure is not the role of RedBuilt, nor can we assume accountability for the full function of the roof 
or ﬂ oor system. We can only be responsible for the internal design integrity of our own products, which 
are structural components of roof and ﬂ oor systems that are necessarily designed by others.
Our warranty is also subject to continuous lateral support to the compression chord of our products 
unless speciﬁ c design provisions account for other lateral support conditions. Continuous lateral 
support is provided by 8d (2½") nails at 24" on-center (minimum) for Red-L™ and Red-W™ trusses; and 
by 8d (2½") nails at 12" on-center (minimum), staggered, to each of the double chord members for 
Red-S™, Red-M™, and Red-H™ trusses; all connected to an adequate diaphragm or total lateral strength 
system.
The magnitude, direction, and location of all design loads are as speciﬁ ed by the building designer. The 
review of this loading by our personnel is only for purposes of designing our product.
Other application assumptions are referenced on the terms and conditions of our purchase agreement 
contract.
Wind direction, site exposure, and roof type and shape are some of the factors that can dramatically inﬂ uence the accumulation of snow on a roof structure. 
ASCE 7 (Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures) and the applicable building code, as well as other local state and regional codes, provide guidelines 
for calculating snowdrift loadings on all types of building  construction. 
Drifts usually occur at locations of discontinuity in a roof, such as at parapet walls, valleys, or where a high roof meets a low roof. Closer on-center spacing or 
additional support may be required at these locations. 
The examples above illustrate potential snowdrift conditions. The project design professional is responsible for determining any additional loads due to snow drifting.

DEFLECTION CRITERIA
Deﬂ ection Calculations 
Deﬂ ections for open-web trusses can be closely approximated by standard 
beam formulas, assuming that the chord members act as the resistance to 
deﬂ ection with the modulus of elasticity (E) of the chords adjusted to allow 
for the deﬂ ection of the webs. Thus, the product of the moment of inertia (I) 
and the effective modulus of elasticity (E) is as shown in the Truss Rigidity 
Properties table below.
For uniformly loaded simple spans, the mid-span deﬂ ection (in inches) 
becomes:
Where:
 w  = Uniform load in plf
 L  = Span in feet
 d =  The average pin-to-pin depth of the truss in inches, which is the 
average depth of the truss minus the following:

RedBuilt Recommended Deﬂ ection Criteria 
Full-scale tests have shown repeatedly that RedBuilt™ products have deﬂ ection 
characteristics that are consistently predictable by calculation, with minimal set 
after load withdrawal.
The graph below shows that RedBuilt’s recommended deﬂ ection limit for 
residential and commercial ﬂ oors is more  restrictive than the minimum required 
by typical building codes. The ﬂ oor load tables shown on pages 6–11 were devel-
oped based on the Commercial Floor Deﬂ ection Limit shown in the graph below.
Floors:
·  Maximum deﬂ ection at live load limited as indicated below
·  Movable partition loads need not be considered
Roofs:
·  Sloped Roofs—¼" to 12" per foot, maximum deﬂ ection L/180 at total load
·  Plaster Ceilings—Also check L/360 at live load

(1)  For live load applications greater than 50 psf, check the L/600 deflection limit using a 
50 psf live load, and check the code-prescribed deflection limit using the full live load.
Deﬂ ection criteria will vary by application. In a roof system, excessive deﬂ ection 
would be unsightly and could cause ceiling cracks and/or drainage problems.
Floor systems, however, have  entirely  different—and usually much more 
restrictive—deﬂ ection requirements due to an  occupant’s perception of ﬂ oor 
performance and feel.
The fundamental frequency of a ﬂ oor system can be a good predictor of perfor-
mance. Contact RedBuilt to discuss ﬂ oor system performance for applications 
that are sensitive to vibration.
The manufacture of RedBuilt™ open-web trusses includes the ability to provide 
a speciﬁ ed camber for appearance. Camber must be considered on an individual 
job basis, although certain policies derived from successful experiences are 
indicated. If camber is not speciﬁ ed in the order, our policy and considerations 
of other related job information will be used by our design department toward 
its  selection.
Although excessive camber in any product may cause problems in framing, it is 
recommended that these policies be followed closely to avoid the serious prob-
lems caused by inadequate camber. In the case of ﬂ at roofs, the camber policy 
will be strictly adhered to unless it is shown that an adequate drainage system 
is provided to avoid ponding water and the resulting overloads.
Camber selection in structural members should include consideration for 
matching requirements of adjacent members of different length, as well as 
cantilevers meeting at a common elevation. In addition, consideration should 
be given to concentrated loads, non-load bearing walls, and special drainage 
problems. A RedBuilt representative is  available to assist you in developing the 
camber requirements.

NAILING INFORMATION
Sound Assemblies and Noise Measurement
The ability of a wall or ﬂ oor/ceiling system to reduce airborne sound transmission is measured using ASTM E90, and reported using the ASTM E413 Sound 
Transmission Class (STC) rating system. The ratings listed below—originally developed by the Acoustical and Insulation Materials Association and now considered a 
standard throughout the industry—are a practical reference for a range of STC numbers. In general, the higher the number, the better the acoustical performance. It is 
important to note that this table is valid only for a given level of background noise and should be used only for generalized comparisons. 
Floor/ceiling systems can also be rated for impact noise transmitted through an assembly. Ratings are determined using the ASTM E492 Impact Insulation Class (IIC) 
system, and like STC  ratings, a high IIC rating indicates signiﬁ cantly reduced impact noise.

For Fire Assemblies and other construction-related ﬁ re information, please refer to resources on our website at redbuilt.com.
Testing
The acoustical assemblies provided below and on page 37 have been tested 
and rated by recognized acoustical laboratories, and the ratings shown are 
well within the acceptable range for multi-family buildings. However, in order 
to achieve these ratings, precautions should be taken to prevent ﬂ anking 
noise and sound leaks, and to ensure that actual construction conforms to the 
assembly shown.
(1)  14 gauge staples may be a direct  substitute for 8d nails if a  minimum penetration of 1" into the flange 
is maintained.
(2)  Minimum spacing must be 5" for four rows of nails.
(3) Spacing may be reduced to 5" where nail penetration does not exceed 13⁄8".
 ·  If more than one row of nails is used, offset rows at least ½" and stagger. Maintain 3⁄8" minimum edge distance. 
 ·  Nailing pattern to be per plans and specifications, and nail  spacing should comply with criteria listed on this page.
 · For member stability, nail sheathing to the full length of the member (24" on-center,  maximum).

Q & A
Q1: How do I develop the most cost effective solution 
when using open-web trusses?
A1: The open-web truss load tables show the maximum load-
carrying capacity of a given truss, but not necessarily the most 
  cost-effective truss type or depth for the application. You can 
also use the Specifying Economical Trusses section on page 4 of 
this guide or you can contact your local RedBuilt representative 
at 1-866-859-6757 for assistance in ﬁ nding the most economical 
 solution for your application. 
Q2: Can RedBuilt™ open-web trusses be used as 
drag struts?
A2: Yes. RedBuilt can design the chords of open-web trusses for 
speciﬁ c axial loads. These loads must be provided by the design 
professional.
Q3: What is MSR lumber?
A3: Machine stress rated (MSR) lumber refers to sawn lumber that 
is mechanically evaluated for strength and stiffness, and then 
visually graded. Sawn lumber that is rated as MSR is regarded as 
high-quality material, and MSR is the only grade of sawn lumber 
used by RedBuilt in open-web truss chord components.
Q4: Are your open-web trusses covered by a warranty?
A4: Yes. RedBuilt warrants that its products will be free from 
 manufacturing errors or defects in workmanship and material. 
In addition, provided that the product is correctly installed and 
used, the company warrants the adequacy of its design for the 
normal and expected life of the building. A copy of the warranty 
can be found on the back cover of this guide or on our website at 
www.RedBuilt.com.
Q5: Does RedBuilt provide any sprinkler system or  
ﬁ re-rated assembly details?
A5: Yes. RedBuilt provides a number of sprinkler system 
suspension and ﬁ re assembly details in AutoCAD® format, which 
can be downloaded from our website at redbuilt.com on the 
AutoCAD Details page.
Q6: What type of certiﬁ cation and quality assurance do 
open-web trusses have?
A6: RedBuilt™ open-web trusses are manufactured in accordance 
with rigorous standards, and they are monitored by a third-party 
quality control agency (PFS Corporation). These standards are 
modeled after ISO 9000.
Q7: How can I contact a RedBuilt representative?
A7: You can ﬁ nd your local RedBuilt representative by calling 
1-866-859-6757 or visiting our website at redbuilt.com. 
Q8: Can I modify or repair RedBuilt™ open-web trusses?
A8: On rare occasions, repairs or modiﬁ cations can be made to 
RedBuilt™ open-web products—but only if the materials and 
instructions are provided by RedBuilt. Contact your local RedBuilt 
representative for more information or call 1-866-859-6757. 
Q9: Can I treat open-web products with ﬁ re-retardant or 
preservative?
A9: RedBuilt does not recommend or warrant the use of 
ﬁ eld-applied treatments. The use of these products may reduce 
the design load-carrying capacity of the members. Instead, 
RedBuilt requires that dry-use conditions be maintained.
Q10: Why are some RedBuilt™ open-web trusses 
painted red on one end?
A10: Many truss applications require the use of non-symmetrical 
trusses. Typically this is due to non-uniform design loading 
patterns. Non-symmetrical trusses are marked with red paint on 
one end, and the layout drawings provided by RedBuilt will specify 
where the red end is to be installed.
Q11: Do RedBuilt™ open-web trusses meet the 
requirements set forth in the U.S. Green Building 
Council’s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design (LEED) standard?
A11: LEED – NC (new construction) is a commonly used building 
rating system designed to accelerate the development of green 
building practice. While products such as RedBuilt™ open-web 
trusses are not LEED certiﬁ ed on an individual basis, they may 
contribute to point totals for a "whole building" certiﬁ cation. 
For example, the following items may be viewed as contributors 
toward points in the LEED rating system:
·  The Low Emitting Materials section (EQ 4.4) recognizes 
composite wood that is free from urea-formaldehyde resins. 
RedBuilt does not use urea-formaldehyde resins in any of its 
engineered lumber products. Material Safety Data Sheets 
(MSDS) are available at redbuilt.com.
·  RedBuilt™ products may qualify for Regional Materials (MR 
5.1 and 5.2) for projects located within a 500 mile radius of 
Portland, OR.
·   Tubular steel webs and bearing clips used in RedBuilt open-
web trusses may qualify for Recycled Content (RC 4.1 and 4.2). 
For more information consult your RedBuilt technical 
representative.
