Foreword
Much has been written about feng shui in English: At the time of this writing there are
over 300 separate titles in English and many thousands of websites on the subject. Yet 25
years ago the subject was virtually unheard of in the United States and very difficult to
discover amongst Western-educated Chinese. Before that there were only books written
by missionaries and colonial administrators living in the nineteenth century. Western
interest was probably sparked by my first book, The Living Earth Manual of Feng Shui,
which was written in 1976 when most material on feng shui was still available only in
Chinese. Feng shui did not however become “dinner party conversation” until the late
1980s, and Lillian Too did much to popularize it in the 1990s.
However, when interest in feng shui did finally gather speed, because of the lack of source
material, many well-meaning teachers and writers seemed to forget that it is a really pre-
cise and exacting subject, and extended it in ways not originally part of its traditional
Chinese roots. Now, although any science can be extended by new research and testing,
this has got to be done with a full knowledge of all that has gone before. It is sometimes
forgotten that feng shui is not a branch of interior decorating, but a practical science in its
own right.
To put not too fine a point on it, a lot of later-day Western feng shui has been simplified
beyond the point where it works, or has been invented or “intuited.” Often intuition has
provided a key or a direction in which to look, but it is never sufficient in itself to declare
“it must be so” because I feel it to be so.
It therefore came as a delight and a breath of fresh air when I laid my hands on The
Complete Idiot’s Guide to Feng Shui. It was even more of a surprise to find that what at first
glance (from its cover) was just another popularization of the subject, was in fact a very
detailed text going a lot further than many of the apparently more ponderous texts, but
starting with the real basics.
Elizabeth Moran and Masters Joseph Yu and Val Biktashev have among them produced an
excellent and detailed book, explaining precisely the detailed calculations undertaken to
this day by professional Chinese feng shui practitioners. As complex as these calculations
are, the authors have presented them in a way that is easy to grasp. Even if you fail to
absorb all the detail, many excellent tables make it easy to read the type of house, the
Four Pillar horoscope of its owner, and the subtle interaction between these two, which
modifies the luck, health, wealth, and happiness of its occupants.
Even now people question the effectiveness of such feng shui “luck manipulation.” Let 
me assure you that, properly done, it is every bit as effective as the curative properties of
acupuncture, and if wrongly applied, every bit as devastating as a karate blow. Feng shui,
acupuncture, and karate are the product of thousands of years of refinement by one of the
most practical races on earth. Their recent arrival does not diminish their effectiveness.

The fact that these three traditional Chinese sciences have only recently made their pres-
ence felt in the West is a tribute to the canniness of the Chinese, who kept the knowledge
of gunpowder (among other things) from the West for hundreds of years.
To transplant from one culture to another a science that is based on a completely different
worldview is a very difficult thing to do. To counter some of the myths that have sprung
up around modern feng shui is even more so, but to do this in bite size chunks and with
considerable humor is truly a tour de force. Tying in Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, and
David Bohm sets feng shui in the context of science, and using the latest scholarly ap-
proaches to Chinese civilization and science keeps the material up to date.
Feng shui is such a huge subject, that with any book on it, the main problem is what to
leave out. The authors have handled this dilemma, by touching briefly upon most of those
schools/methods of feng shui currently represented in the West (like Form School and
Eight House feng shui), whilst choosing to focus on two main areas. These are Flying
Star feng shui and its interrelation with that branch of Chinese astrology that deals with
your personal Four Pillars of Destiny. Both of these aspects make up a large portion of the
feng shui currently practiced in Hong Kong today.
I heartily recommend this book.
—Stephen Skinner
Bali, 2001
Stephen Skinner, originally an academic and lecturer in geography, first came across feng
shui in the 1970s in Hong Kong and Singapore, where he observed the work of feng shui
practitioners firsthand. As a result of what he saw, he wrote the first English book on the
subject in the twentieth century, The Living Earth Manual of Feng Shui, in 1976. He is 
the founder of Feng Shui for Modern Living magazine, the world’s largest selling feng 
shui magazine, which even publishes a regular monthly edition in Chinese. Therefore,
Stephen is uniquely placed to comment upon the rise of feng shui in the West. He is
author of five books on feng shui, including the KISS Guide to Feng Shui, and is presently
engaged in researching the Chinese classics of feng shui back as far as the Tang dynasty.

Introduction
So, you want to try feng shui? You’ve heard it discussed at parties, you’ve read about it 
in magazines, and now you’re willing to give it a try. Why not? But what is feng shui,
exactly? Something to do with moving furniture around and hanging mirrors? Something
to do with the flow of qi, (don’t worry, we’ll tell you all about qi in Chapter 4, “Qi Wiz!
It’s Life’s Force!”)? How do you even pronounce feng shui, anyway? (We’ll tell you that,
too.)
Well, all of your questions about this ancient Chinese tradition will be answered in a way
that you, the Western reader, can understand. No boring treatise—just the need-to-know
basics presented in a fun, interesting, and enlightening manner.
Okay, but what is feng shui? Feng shui is the art and science of living in harmony with
your living space. Specifically, feng shui seeks to harness nature’s positive forces and cor-
rect the negative ones with the intention of promoting better health, wealth, and relation-
ships. You see, beginning 6,000 years ago, the Chinese monitored the cyclic movement of
nature and recorded how its changes affected us. This may sound goofy, but science is
coming to agree with the ancient Chinese notion that we’re all bundles of one intercon-
nected energy.
Out of the ancients’ reverence for nature, three fundamental principles developed: yin and
yang, the five phases, and the eight trigrams. Shared by other Chinese traditions such as
acupuncture, acupressure, and herbs, these principles form the basis of two classical meth-
ods of feng shui: Eight House and Flying Star, both of which you’ll learn about. These
systems will help you find a house compatible with your qi. You’ll discover how external
and internal factors influence your health and livelihood. You’ll learn the most auspicious
position to place your bed and desk.
But, hey, we also offer a short study of Chinese astrology. Besides identifying your animal
sign, we’ll show you how to calculate your life chart using a method called The Four
Pillars of Destiny. You’ll learn how to determine your favorable colors, careers, and envi-
ronments. Also, you’ll learn how to calculate your 10-year, annual, monthly, and daily
luck.
Feng shui will not only help you to improve many aspects of your life, but it will also help
you to understand you! By making simple adjustments, you’ll gain harmony in your home
and workplace. With harmony comes the likelihood of better health, wealth, and relation-
ships.

Part 2, “The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui,” teaches you the fundamental

Part 4, “Feng Shui Mechanics 101,” introduces you to one method of classical feng

Part 1 is an introduction and more. You’ll learn what feng shui is and what it
isn’t. You’ll learn who uses this ancient Chinese art and science and how it can
benefit you. What do I need to begin my study, you ask? Well, besides your
brain and integrity, the most important thing you’ll need is a compass. Details
about this and other things you’ll need are explained in Chapter 1.
Part 1 also introduces you to, well, you. Let’s face it, we Westerners think in a
way that’s different from our Eastern neighbors. We’re a logical lot, preferring
rational knowledge over intuitive wisdom. So, before you can embark on a
journey into an age-old Eastern tradition—one that requires you to push aside
your rational mind-set—you must first understand how you, the Westerner,
think. You’ll also learn how the Chinese think and discover how both thought
processes have come to the same conclusion—that everything and everyone is
one interconnected dance of energy.

In This Chapter
◆Taking the feng shui IQ test
◆Understanding faux and authentic schools of feng shui
◆Discovering what you need to practice feng shui
◆Learning 20 ways feng shui can improve your life
You’re not an idiot if you’re confused about feng shui (pronounced fung
schway). This ancient Chinese tradition has bulldozed its way into the West,
becoming the craze du jour. It seems everyone is either doing it or dissing it.
Feng shui articles, books, entire magazines, complete schools, and compre-
hensive websites have crowded the market. Some of these offer advice and
varied techniques far removed from the real thing. They all seek to cash in
while misleading the unsuspecting, taking full advantage before the unin-
formed consumer wises up and begins to question the myriad inconsistencies.
Actually, this dilution of the classic tradition can be likened to playing “tele-
phone.” Remember that childhood game? One kid whispers a sentence into
the next kid’s ear. Something like, “My 50-foot alligator lives in a black
lagoon.” By the time the sentence reaches the end of the line of kids, it may
have become, “My pin-striped crocodile swims in a pink polka-dot pool.” Get
the idea? This book will avoid such silliness and present to you a clear, concise
explanation of feng shui. Let’s get started by taking a little quiz.

feng shui. It’s time to embark on a unique journey that will change the way you view the
world. Let’s start by discussing what feng 
shui isn’t.
What Feng Shui Is Not
From the many questions we receive from readers, clients, and students, there is great
confusion about the different schools of feng shui: “They all conflict.” “Which one is
right?” “How do I activate my wealth corner?” “Where is my wealth corner?” To address
these concerns, we have added information to this chapter—information that will help

Qi (also spelled ch’i) is
the life force underlying everyone
and everything. It is a field of
information connecting us with
each other and with our environ-
ment. The goal of feng shui is to
balance qi in your living and/or
working space to promote the
likelihood of better health,
wealth, and relationships. Qi is
the subject of Chapter 4, “Qi
Wiz! It’s Life’s Force!”
Wise Words

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
you separate fact from falsehood; information that will help set you on the proper feng
shui path.
Unfortunately, feng shui is plagued with many misconceptions. Largely steeped in myth
and superstition, a discriminating feng shui enthusiast can easily learn to distinguish faux
from authentic schools of feng shui by a number of telltale factors. Here are some attrib-
utes associated with faux schools of feng shui:
◆They are often linked with Life Aspirations or Black Sect (also known as Black Hat
Sect Tantric Buddhist feng shui) theory. Developed during the 1970s and 1980s
respectively, these commercialized schools are referred to as “modern” or “Western”
schools of feng shui.
◆They divide a home into eight “life aspirations” or eight “life stations” of career,
knowledge, family, wealth, fame, marriage, children, and helpful people.
◆They use the location of the front door to determine the orientation of the eight life
aspirations/stations. See the following figures (Life Aspirations theory and Black
Sect theory).
◆They match each of the five phases of qi (fire, earth, metal, water, and wood) with
its affiliated direction. Stated another way, fire “activates” the southern fame aspira-
tion/station; earth activates the northeastern knowledge and southwestern marriage
sectors; metal activates the western children and northwestern helpful people sec-
tors; water activates the northern career sector; and wood activates the eastern fam-
ily and southeastern wealth sectors. The five phases is the subject of Chapter 6,
“The Principle of the Five Phases.”
◆They also use “cures” such as mirrors, crystals, bamboo flutes, red ribbons, and stat-
ues or sculptures of fu dogs, frogs, and cats, among other things, to “activate” the
eight life aspirations/stations. Statements like “A mirror will help to ward off evil
spirits,” “A fish tank placed in the north will bring prosperity,” or “Hanging bells
inside your door will ring in joy and happiness” are commonplace among these
schools.
It’s a pity these inaccuracies have clouded the nature of feng shui. In fact, these wide-
spread assumptions have made the practice seem like a fad reserved for the gullible and
eccentric. As you get further along into this book, you’ll understand how these misrepre-
sentations have never been part of classical feng shui. For example, 2 + 2 = 4, correct?
Could you be convinced otherwise?
Surely not.
Just to set the record straight, feng shui is not a charming Eastern philosophy grounded
in superstition. It is not a religion, nor does it derive from any religion. Feng shui does
not provide elixirs or cure-alls for your problems. It is not magic. It is not a New Age dis-
covery. Feng shui will not reduce your wrinkles, zap your fat, or help you win the lottery.

Chapter 1: What Is Feng Shui?
What Feng Shui Is
Authentic feng shui, which we will hereafter refer to as “traditional” or “classical” feng
shui, is an ancient practice first developed some 6,000 years ago by the Neolithic Chinese.
The early findings blossomed into a sophisti-
cated, well-honed tradition by the Tang dynasty
(618–907 C.E.). Essentially, classical feng shui is
a system based on keen observation of heavenly
(time) and earthly (interior and exterior space)
forces and how the qi of each interact. It is a prac-
tice of balancing these forces. With balance
comes the likelihood of better health, wealth, and
relationships. With balance, feng shui gives you
the impetus, and the drive, to succeed!
7
The eight life aspirations are
correlated with a direction.
The magnetic orientation of
the main entrance deter-
mines the placement of the
life aspirations map. In this
example, the front door faces
south.
The eight life stations are
correlated with a direction.
The northern stations always
correspond to the wall con-
taining the main entrance
even if the door does not face
a northerly direction.
Whether the doorway is on
the left, center, or right side
of the wall (if you face the
dwelling) will determine if
you enter the knowledge,
career, or helpful people sec-
tors respectively.
Feng shui literally trans-
lates to “wind water,” the two nat-
ural elements that direct qi to a
settlement, dwelling, or burial site.
Figuratively, the term represents
the art and science of living in
harmony with your environment.
Wise Words

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
Here are a few distinguishing factors about classical feng shui:
◆The principle tool of the practitioner is a compass. While a Chinese luopan compass
contains many concentric rings of information, for our purposes a basic protractor
compass will suffice. You’ll learn more about the type of compass you’ll need later in
this chapter.
◆The magnetic (space) sitting or backside of the dwelling (as opposed to the location
of the front door) and the year (time) the building was built are used to draw up an
intricate numeric qi map of your dwelling (see the following figure). This technique
is called Flying Star, the most sophisticated method of feng shui and the subject of
Part 5, “Feng Shui Mechanics 201.” For reasons that will be explained in successive
chapters, there are 216 types of houses. In other words, a pre-fabricated, one-size-
fits-all qi map composed of eight life aspirations/stations does not exist in classical
feng shui. Like a snowflake or a fingerprint, each home is unique and individual.
◆The year the occupant(s) was born is an important factor in determining his or her
innate compatibility with the house.
◆Only the five phases of qi (fire, earth, metal, water, and wood) are used to transform
the home’s qi into a productive cycle, fostering the probability of increased prosper-
ity, better health, and beneficial relationships. Where each phase is placed depends
on the number combination in the area in question. 
8
The year the building was
built and its magnetic sitting
direction yield a numeric qi
map. The classically trained
feng shui practitioner studies
the individual numbers,
combination of numbers, and
location of the numbers,
among other things, to deter-
mine the likelihood of specific
events occurring within the
home. The practitioner bal-
ances the dwelling’s qi to
enhance its positive aspects
and discourage its negative
ones.

Chapter 1: What Is Feng Shui?
Compasses and number schemes? Yikes! This sounds complex. It seems hard! Will I be
able to grasp and implement classical feng shui’s fundamentals and techniques? Of course!
Don’t fear. Forge ahead. While classical feng shui certainly cannot be fully learned in a
weekend seminar or even in this book, you can learn the basics of two methods (Eight
House and Flying Star) that you will employ and benefit from.
As you will learn in later chapters, classical feng shui is based, in part, on modern scien-
tific reasoning. For example, acclaimed physicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955) proved that
matter is an illusion, a masked form of energy. In other words, we, and our living space,
are actually bundles of intertwining, connecting energy. All in flux, all confluent, pervad-
ing our very being. If not properly or effectively harnessed, human possibility is wasted.
Doesn’t it make sense to enhance our environment positively and productively?
Who Practices Feng Shui?
You need not be Asian or of Asian descent to practice feng shui. You don’t have to be an
interior designer, architect, or landscaper. Nor a philosopher, scientist, or celebrity. In
fact, there are no prerequisites to practicing feng shui. Yet, this is not to say that feng shui
practitioners don’t share common traits. They do.
Generally feng shui practitioners … 
◆Have an open mind.
◆Are willing to try alternative forms of therapy.
◆Believe that the world and its peoples are interconnected.
◆Believe in God or a Higher Power.
◆Believe harmony and balance are essential to our well-being.
◆Believe in a sense of fate or destiny.
Feng shui practitioners are global. They transcend cultural, racial, economic, and political
barriers.

The time your house was constructed or “born” and the time you were born are
important considerations in a classical feng shui analysis. What does this mean, you
ask? Well, many Chinese believe the first breath you take at birth marks your innate
destiny. In the same way, when the foundation is set, the walls are secured, and the
roof is affixed, your house is born. It, too, has a core personality. The central premise
of feng shui is to correct and/or enhance your dwelling’s personality so that its qi
forces nourish your well-being, inspiring you to maximize your potential.

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
Feng Shui’s Beginnings in the East
In medieval China, feng shui was a closely guarded secret. Its masters were restricted to
the ruling class of emperors, aristocrats, and the privileged elite. By deliberately excluding
commoners from feng shui’s power, they ensured their stately positions. Feng shui mas-
ters were greatly rewarded for their expertise, and severely punished, or even killed, if
they were known to aid the masses.
10
One notable master, Yang Yunsong, managed to escape the Forbidden City (the fa-
mous complex of buildings in Beijing so called because at one time, only the emperor,
his female entourage, and eunuchs lived there) during the Yellow Bandits Rebellion of
907 C.E. Yang sought refuge in the mountainous area of northwest China. There, he
helped the poor by using his skills in feng shui. Nicknamed “Save the Poor,” Yang
Yunsong is still revered today for being among the first to explain and share some of the
shrouded secrets of the tradition.
Feng Facts
Today, feng shui is a way of life in many parts of Asia. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,
and Malaysia, feng shui masters are regularly called upon to bring prosperity, good health,
and beneficial relationships to individuals and businesses alike. Meanwhile, feng shui is
enjoying a resurgence on mainland China. After being long suppressed by the Communist
regime, feng shui—along with many of China’s other traditions—is once again being
embraced.
Feng Shui Moves West
As Asians move west, so do their traditions. Oriental medicine (such as acupuncture and
herbal remedies), Far Eastern cuisine, and the martial arts have all been accepted in our
multicultural societies. Following their influences, feng shui is on the verge of being
accepted by mainstream America. As we mentioned, feng shui is cropping up everywhere.
Adult education courses, magazines, and websites are helping it to become a household
word. Indeed, this cultural exchange of ideas will help facilitate communication and better
understanding between two divergent peoples. Perhaps a time will come when feng shui
will lose its distinctly cultural identity and become a worldwide tradition.
Would you be surprised to learn that some of the Western world’s largest corporations use
feng shui? Here are a few examples of progressive Western feng shui partisans:
◆Trump Towers in New York City
◆Creative Artists Agency in Beverly Hills, California
◆MGM Grand Hotel and Mirage Resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada

Chapter 1: What Is Feng Shui?
◆The Deepak Chopra Center in California
◆Sydney Harbour Casino and Hotel in Australia
While there are myriad Eastern companies that adhere to feng shui principles, you might
be interested to learn that Hong Kong Disneyland, scheduled to open in 2005, is being
constructed according to feng shui principles.
Feng Shui and You
You don’t have to be a mover or shaker to partake in feng shui’s power. Feng shui is meant
for everyone. We have two kinds of clients: those who are seeking desperate measures for
desperate times, and those who are looking for a winning edge. They share a desire to
improve their living and/or working conditions. Do you see yourself in any of the follow-
ing situations?
◆Helen is a nurse practitioner. She’s smart, attractive, funny, and single. She has
grown tired of blind dates, bad dates, and no dates. She wants to settle down and
have a family. How can she attract Mr. Right?
◆Alex and Anna want to buy a house. Three years of scrimping and saving has
rewarded them with $50,000 for a down payment. It’s a big investment. How can
they find a home best suited to them?
◆Mr. Smith owns a small insurance agency. Despite competitive salaries, bonuses, and
other incentives not offered by many employers, his staff can’t get along. Will the
bickering ever end?
The fact that these people will consider feng shui to improve their situations is testimony
to their open minds. They will take a leap of faith and extend their common senses to the
realm of the invisible, the realm that extends beyond our five senses of sight, touch, hear-
ing, taste, and smell.
But, you may ask, exactly how will these people be helped? Patience, our friends! Later
on, after you’ve learned feng shui’s fundamental principles, we’ll review two of these case
studies, and see how they remedied their situations. Patience, perseverance, and reading to
the end will enable you to solve these mysteries.
What Do I Need to Practice Feng Shui?
The most important thing you need is a positive attitude—a willingness to want to
improve your life and that of your loved ones. While feng shui is used to balance your
home’s space, the onus is on you to balance your own space, your own mind and body. By
living the Golden Rule, by refraining from gossip, maliciousness, and hate, you will
11

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
become a more centered being. You will be working
with feng shui’s power. It’s a two-way street, friends!
How can you expect feng shui to fully work if you’re
arguing incessantly, spending beyond your means, or
living in a cluttered and disorderly environment? Take
charge! Seize the day. Become proactive and not reac-
tive to your own wants and needs and life’s situations.
Help to create a positive destiny by performing good
deeds, uttering good words, and eating healthful food.
Balance and harmony begins with you!
Here’s a short list of things you’ll need to begin your study of classical feng shui:
◆Your brain.
◆Integrity.
◆A clear plastic, 6-inch, 360-degree protractor with half-inch gradations. This can be
found in any office supply store. We recommend the Mars College protractor.
◆A straight edge ruler.
◆A basic protractor compass. This can be found in any outdoor equipment and camp-
ing store. A model that graduates in two-degree steps where directions are clearly
marked is best. Also, a compass featuring a line of sight is beneficial. We recom-
mend the Silva Explorer Model 203 compass. It costs about $25 and is shown in the
following photo.
12
Feng shui can be used
only to improve your situation. It
may not be used for selfish,
materialistic, or vengeful pur-
poses. Positive energies working
in harmony will not work at the
behest of those with negative
intentions.

Chapter 1: What Is Feng Shui?
The final thing you’ll need is patience. To the newcomer, feng shui’s principles may seem
abstract and difficult to comprehend. Our advice is to take your time. Read each chapter
thoroughly. Digest it. Review it again. If you become frustrated, confused, or just plain fed
up, relax and take a break. The Great Wall of China wasn’t built in a day. Neither was
feng shui!
Twenty Ways to Benefit from Feng Shui
Here are 20 ways feng shui can potentially help you. We’ll be covering many of these top-
ics in later chapters:
1. Getting a job, raise, or promotion
2. Improving health
3. Getting married
4. Getting pregnant or preventing miscarriages
5. Guarding against separations or divorce
6. Increasing motivation
7. Creating more harmonious family/work relationships
8. Developing better study habits
9. Increasing creativity
10. Feeling more in control
11. Feeling more comfortable in your home/office
12. Eliminating depression
13. Stimulating social life
14. Spurring better business
15. Preventing lawsuits or malicious influences
16. Preventing accidents
17. Finding an apartment, home, or business
18. Warding off addictions
19. Promoting better sleep
20. Bringing respect and fame
Even if you feel your life is on track, practicing feng shui is fun. Get involved. Enlist your
friends and family.

Pinyin and Wade-Giles: Chinese Romanization
In this book, we use the Pinyin system of romanization that uses the Roman or Latin
alphabet to spell Chinese words. Developed by the Chinese in the mid-twentieth century
Pinyin was accepted as the international standard in 1979. Nevertheless, many Western
authors still use the older Wade-Giles system of transliteration, which was developed by
two British sinologists (a person who studies Chinese culture, customs, language, and the
like): Sir Francis Wade (1818–1895) and Herbert Allen Giles (1845–1935). For our read-

So, where do we go from here? Before you depart on this journey, you must first under-
stand how you think as a Westerner. Understanding how you are a product of a culture of
rational thinkers will enable you to set aside your preconceptions. Only then can you
investigate and accept alternative ways of thinking based on intuitive knowledge—a
method primarily used by our Eastern counterparts. Yet, regardless of how anyone thinks,
we’ll all arrive at the same conclusions about the world we live in. What’s that? Keep
reading!
The Least You Need to Know
◆Feng shui is not a superstition, philosophy, or religion.
◆Feng shui is the study of time and space. The practice seeks to harmonize nature’s
forces within your living/working space and surrounding environment.
◆The use of mirrors, crystals, bamboo flutes, and red ribbons, along with the concept
of dividing a home into sections of career, knowledge, family, wealth, fame, mar-
riage, children, and helpful people belong to faux schools of feng shui.
◆Feng shui can potentially improve your health, wealth, and relationships.
◆A positive attitude, integrity, patience, and a basic protractor compass are all that
you need to begin practicing classical feng shui.

Hanyu Pinyin Wenzi (the alphabet of Chinese phonetic combinations) is a sys-
tem of romanization that uses the Roman or Latin alphabet to spell Chinese words.
Based on the Peking dialect of Mandarin Chinese, Pinyin was developed by the
Chinese after the advent of Communism in 1949. In 1979, it became the international
standard and is used in all forms of printed material, television, Braille for the blind,
and finger spelling for the deaf. Wade-Giles is an older system of transliteration first
developed by a Cambridge University sinologist, Sir Thomas Francis Wade (1818–
1895) and improved upon and popularized by another British sinologist, Herbert Allen
Giles (1845–1935).

◆A New World Vision for the Millennium: suggestions to implement
global harmony
Pretend the universe is a car. We all know that a car is an intricate mechanism
comprised of thousands of pieces, all functioning as parts of the whole. We
know that it would be impossible to discern how the car operates by studying,
say, a tire. Ironically, this is how most Western scientists study the universe.
They focus on one spot or element, disregarding the interconnectedness of
that which surrounds and/or encompasses it.
Yet, the Big Picture is now beginning to emerge. As modern scientists delve
deeper into the celestial heavens and probe deeper into the infinitesimal,
many are becoming aware of the unity of all things. The acceptance of univer-
sal wholeness will guide and enable us to define a new world vision—a vision
that will change our fundamental moral, social, political, and religious order.
Chapter

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
This chapter is about understanding how our minds work and how we have tuned in to
nature’s truths. This chapter is about our intellectual heritage—how the Western world
has become a culture of rational thinkers and how we are becoming a people of united
reformers. What does this have to do with feng shui? Our Eastern neighbors have always
favored the Big Picture, the unity of all things. As you will come to learn, feng shui is
about harnessing nature’s forces, which connect us all. Understanding and accepting this
concept will lead you to better health, wealth, and relationships.
Mind Power 101
The human mind is a powerful tool. Using our minds we have progressed from being a
tribe of hunters and gatherers to a society overly dependent on our inventions and 
discoveries. Without such conveniences as telephones,
computers, automobiles, or microwave ovens, we’d feel
lost, frustrated, and frazzled. The last 150 years alone
have yielded mind-boggling advances in the fields of
science, medicine, genetics, and technology, unequaled
during any other time in the history of humankind.
The endless stream of wonders continues still, each
new development vastly increasing our knowledge and
capabilities.
Using our minds we have ushered in the Information
Age: An age where communication devices like the
telephone, cellular phone, fax machine, and especially
the computer, have connected people all over the
world. An age where ideas can flow freely, where walls
of judgment are breaking down. Using our minds we
have collectively taken a step toward global integration
and unity of all peoples.
Twelve Percent of the Whole
Logic and reason are the bulwarks of Western thinking.
But did you know that these abilities compose only 12
percent of our mind’s power? Considering the level of
intellect, sophistication, and complexity needed to gener-
ate such far-reaching advances as satellites and space sta-
tions, this is truly remarkable. Yet it is a physiological
fact.

Believing that everything of value
and usefulness had already been
invented, the U.S. Patent Office
sought to disband its establish-
ment in 1844. But from that year
forward, an outpouring of impor-
tant discoveries and inventions
caused the office to remain
open. Such things as the tele-
graph (1844), elevator (1854),
telephone (1876), automobile
(1885), Kodak camera (1888),
and airplane (1903) became
realities, changing the world 
forever.

Chapter 2: Western Intellectual Heritage and the Holy Grail
The adult mind comprises two contingent but distinctly different components: the con-
scious mind (12 percent) and the subconscious mind (88 percent). Separating the realms is
the critical area of the mind. Part conscious, part subconscious, the critical area accepts
and rejects information based on knowns, units of communication that have been learned
before.
19
The conscious, or waking, state of mind gives us logic, reason, and
willpower. The subconscious realm is the area of the mind that receives and stores
information. A known is a unit of communication that has been learned before. It can
be positive or negative and will be accepted into the subconscious mind. An unknown
is a unit that is rejected by the critical area of the mind and will not enter the subcon-
scious.
Wise Words
Imagine your mind is a computer. The input of information is tremendous. Files are con-
stantly being made: Belief files, feeling files, habit files, and everything else that is a
known are filed in your subconscious memory. If a computer encounters an instruction or
data that are totally foreign to its known programs, it is rejected. Likewise, if your mind
receives information unknown to your frame of reference, it is immediately dismissed. For
example, if we said you could derive nature’s truths by meditating, you would probably
reject this idea, if you had an analytical, scientific way of thinking.
Our mind accepts and rejects
information similar to how a
computer processes data.
As a culture, we have learned to isolate, compartmentalize, and fragmentize information.
Only in the West do we tend to separate such things as mind from body and faith from
reason. Our separatist notion and the way we view the world stems from our linear scien-
tific heritage. We are comfortable with taking a step-by-step, logical approach to problem

solving. Everyday phrases like “Let’s be reasonable,” and “This is not logical” are testa-
ment to our deeply ingrained thought process.
Faux Feng Shui and the Western Mind
The Western mindset helped, in part, to create faux feng shui! The keen masterminds
behind Black Sect and Life Aspirations feng shui (see Chapter 1, “What Is Feng Shui?”
for a reminder of faux feng shui) understood that Westerners like things neat and orderly.
Westerners need to break things down. Westerners need to label things. Hence the cre-
ation of distinct components or life aspirations/stations of wealth, career, knowledge, and
the like.
Remember the television commercial: “Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese,
pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun”? Quick, was it McDonald’s or Burger King?
Chances are, you had to think about it. The point is, the savvy production team hired by
the owners of McDonald’s capitalized on the Western obsession with parts. Little empha-
sis was placed on the whole burger.
Continuing with our fast-food analogy, Westerners want things bigger-better-faster. We
want things now-now-now. Borrowing a term from our friend and feng shui teacher and
practitioner Cate Bramble, feng shui has become “McDonaldized.” Simply, most
Westerners do not have the patience to fully understand a complicated concept. We want
the Reader’s Digest version—only part of the story.
Friends, understand that classical feng shui is the study of qi, the holistic, pervasive, and
uniting force underlying everyone and everything. While you’ll learn about qi in Chapter
4, “Qi Wiz! It’s Life’s Force!” understand that qi is not like a pet dog. Qi cannot be com-
manded and taught to separate into different sociological factions. Wealth qi, over here.
Sit and stay. Career qi, over here. Sit and stay. Remember, feng shui is the study of time
(heaven qi) and space (earth qi). Each dwelling’s space is different, born into different
times. Actually, you may have more than one area within your home or office that pro-
motes prosperity and promotion!
The study of classical feng shui will not only free us, allowing for alterations in the way of
seeing and thinking, but also help us grow, develop, progress, and succeed. It will help us
become more holistic, shedding our separatist ways.
In Search of the Holy Grail
Before we move on to presenting scientific evidence and theories about a holistic uni-
verse, it’s worth understanding from where our rational and separatist mindset derives.
20

Chapter 2: Western Intellectual Heritage and the Holy Grail
Since ancient times, philosophers and scientists have searched for the Holy Grail of
Knowledge: the origin, structure, and order of the universe. With each new discovery,
myths were dispelled and replaced by new “truths,” which often carried over into succes-
sive centuries, becoming firmly rooted in our collective consciousness. Over the past
2,500 years, there has been an impressive roster of individuals whose scientific discoveries
or philosophical ideas changed the way we view the world. Here is a brief overview of
those who have helped to form our rational, separatist mindset:
◆The Greek Age: The ancient Greeks
considered the study of science a noble
pursuit. It was not inspired by religion,
which at the time was polytheistic—a
belief in or worship of more than one god.
Science that presents a rational and orderly
view of the cosmos developed in ancient
Greece around the sixth century B.C.E. with
Thales of Miletus. A seafaring and trading
people, the Greeks developed an acute sense
of time and space, their observations giving
birth to the fields of astronomy and geometry. We can credit Pythagoras (560–500
B.C.E.) and Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.) with instituting scientific methods based on
logic and reason. These methods of deductive and inductive reasoning still play a role
today in scientific thinking.
◆The Newtonian Age: English physicist Sir Isaac Newton’s (1642–1727) universe
was black and white, void of gray. Now called “classical” or “mechanical” physics,
Newton’s belief was that simple and permanent mechanical laws that could be
understood by careful observation and experimentation governed the universe.
Based on the Greeks’ deductive and inductive methodology, Newton explained his
theories using mathematics. He maintained that we are separate from nature and
thus are able to observe the world objectively. Although Newton sought to reconcile
his deep religious convictions with science, his ideas set the stage for a break
between science and religion, or physics and metaphysics (philosophy).
◆The Enlightenment Age: Coined by German philosopher Immanuel Kant
(1724–1804), the term “enlightenment” took God out of the scientific equation,
viewing natural phenomena entirely as a mechanical scheme. Kant sought to bring
together two divergent philosophical ideas developed during the seventeenth cen-
tury—the notion that knowledge is derived from observation and experience and not
theory (empiricism) and the notion that knowledge is derived from reasoning
(rationalism). According to Kant, the concepts of time and space cannot be fully
understood using sensory perception. Because of these limitations, the physical

a conclusion by deducing laws
through observation is deductive
reasoning. The method of reach-
ing a conclusion by developing
specific cases based on general
laws is inductive reasoning.

world must be studied using a rational system like mathematics. Other enlightened
philosophers include Denis Diderot (1713–1784), Julien Offra de la Mettrie
(1709–1751), and David Hume (1711–1761).
◆The Darwinian Age: The split between science and religion was fully realized with
British naturalist Charles Darwin (1809–1882). Postulated in his book, On the Origin
of the Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the
Struggle for Life (1859), Darwin’s groundbreaking and controversial theory of evolu-
tion and natural selection caused much discord between the scientific and religious
factions. The schism deeply impacted the Western mindset.
The preceding examples demonstrate how we have learned to rationalize, separate, and
isolate information as a means of understanding the totality of the universe and its inhabi-
tants. As a result, we have effectively disengaged, separating science, religion, mind, and
body into distinct and fortified camps—a mindset that would be shattered with twentieth-
century science.
United We Stand
The discoveries made by twentieth-century physicists have rocked the scientific world,
crushing long-held traditional views spearheaded by Newtonian mechanics. A unified
world picture is emerging that no longer reduces nature (and human nature) to a series of
isolated parts. Modern scientists now view the cosmos as a web of interconnected and
interrelated events. As you’ll soon learn, many modern scientists believe in the existence
of God or a Higher Power to which we are connected. The new scientific paradigm—the
whole is the sum of its parts—is replacing the common ideology—the parts are the means
to the whole.
While these two ideologies may sound alike, they really are not. The distinction may be
subtle but, nonetheless, significant. We are speaking of ways of thinking, considering, and
perceiving the world. Remember the car at the beginning of this chapter? Today, when we
look at it, we see more than just a set of tires, a carburetor, or a fuel tank. We see all these
things and more: a means of transportation, a status symbol, a product of a powerful
worldwide industry. When we drive this car on a highway, we are involved in more than
going from point A to point B; we are utilizing a vast and vital, well-connected national
and interstate road system upon which the economic health of our nation depends. When
we consider our nation, we do not stop at borders. We belong to a community of nations,
diverse peoples all sharing the same planet.
In feng shui, the totality is what is stressed—a rich totality comprising of a harmonious
unity of parts. This is opposed to a collection of distinct and singular parts (the eight life
aspirations/stations) joining together to form a loose federation. So, as scientists continue
22

Chapter 2: Western Intellectual Heritage and the Holy Grail
to search for “pure truth,” feng shui helps to provide an alternate path, if you will, new
frames of reference to our collective consciousness.
Scientific Holistic Theories
Two influential and revolutionary scientific theories surfaced during the twentieth century
that played a leading role in changing how scientists understand the world. On a larger
scale, the discoveries enabled us to see the Big Picture, a holistic reality.
◆Theories of relativity: Postulated by German physicist Albert Einstein (1879–
1955), his theories state that mass is nothing more than a different manifestation of
energy. It means that the book you’re now reading and the chair you are sitting in
are forms of energy at rest. Also, Einstein understood that space and time were not
separate entities, but are connected to form a fourth dimension called space-time.
◆Quantum physics: Formulated in the
1920s by Niels Bohr (1885–1962), Max
Planck (1858–1947), and Werner
Heisenberg (1901–1976), among others,
quantum physics is the study of subatomic
particles such as electrons and atoms. In a
nutshell, quantum theory reveals the unity
of all things. It shows that we cannot use
isolation as a method to gain knowledge of
the whole.
If these theories seem like old hat to you, ideas
that have lost their power and passion, consider
the following theories that many people are not
yet aware of.
Holistic Theories
Perhaps the most exciting theories cannot be fully scientifically proven. Nevertheless, they
cause us to broaden our minds, raising us to new levels of understanding, wisdom, and
insight. Here is a short description of the work generated by three innovative and pro-
gressive Western scientists.
◆David Bohm (1917–1992): Based in part on his work concerning the behavior of
electrons, Bohm believed the universe can be likened to a hologram in which each
part of the image contains the entire picture. He believed the universe is “an undi-
vided and unbroken whole” and that there exists a hidden primary reality (the quan-
tum potential) that provides information to the totality of humankind and its

“Everything is determined …
by forces over which we have no
control. It is determined for the
insect as well as for the star.
Human beings, vegetables, or

distance by an invisible piper.”
—Albert Einstein, in The Saturday
Evening Post, October 26, 1929

environment. Bohm’s beliefs give a scientific explanation to the phenomenon of syn-
chronicity—a pattern of correlated coincidences (thoughts, objects, numbers, and/or
events) linked together to form a theme of meaning to the observer.
◆Rupert Sheldrake (modern-day biologist): Sheldrake claims that the development
and evolution of an organism and human consciousness is guided by a holistic force
that he calls the morphic field. Specifically, the morphic field is a phenomenon of
nature whereby if a form or thought occurs in nature, it is likely to repeat again in
another species; and if a thought occurs, it is likely to be thought again by another
person. In nature, the spiral shape of conch shells, hurricanes and galaxies are exam-
ples. In human nature, the independent and almost simultaneous “discovery” of 
calculus in 1675 by English mathematician and philosopher Sir Isaac Newton
(1642–1727) and German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz
(1646–1716) is an example of humankind tapping into the morphic field.
◆Andrew Newberg (1967– ): Neuroscientist Andrew Newberg believes he can prove
that a Higher Power exists by the way the brain functions during states of deep con-
centration, meditation, and prayer. In these states the “line” that separates the self
from the world disappears, producing the effect of a mystical union with God (or
the Sea of Consciousness, a Higher Power). The question remains: Is God an illu-
sion produced by the brain’s activity or has God wired our brain to experience a
holistic reality? These mysteries and many other studies about the convergence of
science and religion are being funded by the John Templeton Foundation.
Indeed the notion of a holistic world order is quite profound and worthy of more study.
Please see Appendix C, “Learn More About Feng Shui,” for a list of Bohm’s, Sheldrake’s,
and Newberg’s thought-provoking works. Also, see Chapter 11, “Science, Synchronicity,
and the Yijing,” in The Complete Idiot’s Guide to the I Ching (Alpha Books, 2001). Here, we
give a detailed account of David Bohm’s ideas as they relate to the Yijing, a book of div-
ination developed at the end of the second millennium B.C.E.
In the meantime, if we can accept their ideas, it means we are able to draw from an infi-
nite well of potential and possibilities. This is the hallmark of feng shui—to harness
nature’s well (qi) to better our existence.
Nature Speaks Mathematics, Too
Scientists use mathematics to help explain what we cannot understand using sensory per-
ception. Somehow, this man-made abstraction magically conforms to nature’s truths. Put
another way, somehow we conform to mathematical principles in the universe. Whether
we do it on a conscious or subconscious level is not known, but we’ve stumbled on mathe-
matical patterns in nature that continue to perplex and inspire, propelling us to new levels
of understanding about ourselves and the world in which we live.
24

Chapter 2: Western Intellectual Heritage and the Holy Grail
While modern scientists understand that mathematics is the language of the universe, the
ancient Chinese understood that mathematics was the language of the gods—that the pan-
theon of ancestors in heaven “spoke” to their descendants using numbers. The Chinese
used the numeric information made apparent in the celestial heavens to improve their
well-being. Eventually, their astute knowledge of the cosmos evolved into a system of feng
shui called Flying Star, the subject of Part 5, “Feng Shui Mechanics 201.”
Fascinating Fibonacci and the Golden Ratio
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610 …
This is a sequence of numbers called the Fibonacci Sequence, named after thirteenth-
century mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci. By charting a popula-
tion of rabbits, Fibonacci stumbled upon a certain numeric pattern as a solution to a story
problem: Each number in the series is the sum of the two previous numbers. For example,
3+5=8; 5+8=13; 8+13=21, and so on to infinity.
Pretty neat, but it gets even better. Dividing each number in the series by the one preced-
ing it yields a ratio that stabilizes at 1.618034. For example, 2 ÷ 1 = 2, 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5, 1597 ÷
987 = 1.618034, 4181 ÷ 2584 = 1.618034, and so on to infinity. This figure has come to be
known as the Golden Ratio. Big deal, you say.
25
The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number in the
series is the sum of the two previous numbers. A Golden Ratio is a special number
approximately equal to 1.6180339887498948482. The digits of the Golden Ratio
go on to infinity without any pattern repeating. It’s related to the Fibonacci Sequence
and is obtained by dividing each number in the series by the one that precedes it.
Wise Words
Okay, here’s the cool stuff. Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Ratio can be found in
nature and our bodies, and has influenced art, architecture, and music. Fibonacci propor-
tions can even be found in everyday items like playing cards, notepads, mirrors, windows,
and credit cards. Simply, we are drawn to certain number proportions. Put another way,
we, and our surroundings, conform to mathematical principles made manifest in universe.
Here is a short list of things in which you can find Fibonacci numbers and the Golden
Ratio:
◆On pinecones, artichokes, pineapples, and sunflowers, the bracts, petals, scales, and
seeds respectively exemplify Fibonacci ratios. There are 5 steep and 8 gradual spirals

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
on pinecones and artichokes. There are 8 and 13 gradual and 21 steep spirals on a
pineapple. The head of a sunflower shows 55 rows of seeds revolving counterclock-
wise and 89 rows of seeds revolving clockwise.
◆We have Fibonacci fingers: 2 hands, each of which has 5 fingers broken into 3 parts
of 2 knuckles. Our body and face conform to Fibonacci proportions.
◆On a piano keyboard, 13 keys comprise an octave (chromatic scale). These are bro-
ken down into 8 white keys and 5 black keys, which are divided into groups of 2 and
3 keys. Moreover, the pentatonic scale is made up of 5 keys, and the diatonic scale
with 8 keys.
Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Ratio are manifestations of the innate harmony, sym-
metry, and balance in the universe. As we stated at the beginning of this section, whether
consciously or subconsciously, we have tapped into and benefited by nature’s truth.
Indeed, we are all part of a cosmic dance in which we affect and are affected by everyone
and everything.
For more information about the Fibonacci Sequence, please see Trudi Hammel Garland’s
inspiring book, Fascinating Fibonaccis: Mystery and Magic in Numbers (Dale Seymour
Publications, 1987).
26
Add up any 10 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence and divide the sum by
11. You’ll find that not only is the sum always evenly divisible, the sum is a Fibonacci
number! For example, 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144 = 374 ÷
11 = 34; 8 + 13 + 21 + 34 + 55 + 89 + 144 + 233 + 377 + 610 = 1584 ÷ 11
= 144. See Chapter 13, “The Flying Stars, Part 1,” for more interesting information
about how the number 11 is mysteriously linked with the catastrophic events surrounding
the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center attack.
Feng Facts
Other Profound Patterns
The Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio aren’t the only number series found in
nature. There are many other transcendental mathematical examples, but space restricts
us from presenting them.
As we have mentioned, feng shui is a system of mathematical patterns in nature discovered
by the ancient Chinese. In fact, four of feng shui’s fundamental principles correspond to
numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence: taiji (1), yin and yang (2); heaven, earth, and human
qi (3), five phases (5), and eight trigrams (8). Part 3, “Understanding Your Environment,”
is devoted to learning the principles of these patterns.

A New World Vision for the Millennium
If we do discover a single unifying force or scientifically prove the existence of God or a
Higher Power, how will that affect our everyday life? Will we lay down our warheads and
use this knowledge constructively? Will we become united as citizens of planet Earth?
Perhaps we earthlings should establish a New Vision for the Millennium, a set of princi-
ples that will unite us on a fundamental human level. These principles will heal cultural
and racial tensions resulting from dogmas and superstitions of the past, as well as elevate
our awareness so that we can create a harmonious and peaceful world.
If for no other reason, our common purpose of survival will force us to adopt a New
World Vision for the Millennium. Our goals could include, but not be limited to … 
◆Independent search for truth.
◆The harmony of science and religion.
◆The oneness of all belief systems.
◆Equality of men and women.
◆The elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty.
◆The abolition of prejudices.
◆Universal compulsory education.
◆A universal language.
◆The establishment of a world government.
The implementation of world harmony begins with you. Before we can hope to change
our global frame of reference we must each foster unity and harmony in our own home.
We hope that you’ll set aside your rational mindset and opt for a more holistic way of
thinking. Feng shui is a powerful tool that can help do this.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how the Chinese have always viewed the world as a holis-
tic reality. Also, you’ll learn how feng shui developed.

for 2,000 years, beginning around 500 B.C.E. to 1500 C.E., this Eastern nation’s
scientific and technological advances exceeded anything found in the West?
Chapter

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
The Chinese have always believed in the oneness of all things. The practice of feng shui
was born out of China’s reverence for nature. The Chinese believed if they could reflect
the balance of nature’s forces in their daily lives, they could achieve a more harmonious
living condition. That assumption was correct. In this chapter, you’ll learn how the
Chinese developed a thought process based, in part, on intuitive wisdom, and how they
derived mathematical truths from nature.
Made in China
A common misunderstanding among Westerners is that the Chinese lack scientific and
technological know-how. The ubiquitous “Made in China” label, stuck to the bottom of
practically every inexpensive trinket, probably contributes to this stereotype. But the fact
is we have the Chinese to thank for inventing many things that have improved our lives
and made them more pleasurable. The wheelbarrow, umbrella, animal harness, stirrups,
the game of chess, paper money, fishing reels, matches, and kites are all products of
Chinese ingenuity. Also, the Chinese developed the first seismograph and planetarium.
They created movable sails, the rudder, and bulkhead. Iron casting and silk harvesting
originated in China.
But, surely, China’s four most important inventions are the developments of papermaking,
printing, gunpowder, and the compass. The compass is the tool of the feng shui practi-
tioner. You’ll be learning more about this later on.
China’s Greater Nature
The ancient Chinese took what they called “Greater Nature” (Da Zi Ran) very seriously.
Its forces inspired, awed, and humbled. It was a favorite subject of artisans. Greater
Nature even gave rise to earth sciences like geology, cartography, and chemistry. The
Chinese believed they were a product of nature’s forces. They believed these forces deter-
mined their fate. To the farmer, gentle winds meant abundant crops, prosperity, and good
health. Conversely, harsh winds, floods, and drought meant devastation, misfortune, and
illness.
Natural phenomena were important to the emperor, too. Since the Shang dynasty 
(c. 1600–1045 B.C.E.) these semi-divine leaders petitioned Shangdi (their high god who
ruled over lesser gods and spirits of the departed) on behalf of their kingdom. If Shangdi
approved of his leadership, he blessed the kingdom with favorable weather, thus securing
the king’s position. If Shangdi disapproved of the king’s leadership, the lord above pun-
ished him by sending bad weather and illness. Considered an evil omen, such harsh condi-
tions were a direct communication from above that the king should rectify his poor
behavior.

Chapter 3: The Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng Shui
Skywatcher for Hire
When Marco Polo visited China in 1275 C.E., purportedly he described Beijing as a city
of 5,000 skywatchers. He was probably right. Some of those skywatchers were astrologers,
some were astronomers. Both ran flourishing businesses in interpreting and divulging
nature’s secrets.
31
In her recent book, Did Marco Polo Go to China? (Secker & Warburg, 1995), British
librarian Frances Wood claims he didn’t. This comes as quite a shock to Western minds
who believe Polo discovered China; so entrenched are his fantastic adventures and
importation of things like spaghetti, salt, pepper, jade, and silk. While Wood makes a
compelling case, she can’t emphatically prove her claim. If Polo did visit China in
1275 C.E., why is there no court documentation of his governorship of Yangshou or his
17-year relationship with Mongol leader Kublai Kan? In Polo’s 1299 epic travelogue,
Divisament dou Monde (Description of the World), why doesn’t he mention such
Chinese peculiarities as chopsticks, tea drinking, and the Great Wall? Wood theorizes
that Polo may have taken details from Persian and Arabic guidebooks on China
acquired by the Polo family and that Polo never ventured beyond the family’s trading
posts on the Black Sea and in Constantinople.
Feng Facts
The Art of Astrology
Astrologers analyze cycles of time. They study the position and movements of the sun,
moon, stars, and planets in association with the consistency of human characteristics and
the occurrence of human events on earth. Based on the position of the heavenly bodies at
any given point in time, astrologers can then “map” your fate. In China, the imperial
court relied on a stable of learned astrologers to map out the most auspicious and inauspi-
cious time to do just about everything, including the signing of documents, the construc-
tion of buildings, travel, military excursions, and marriage.
Astrology is considered an art because its predictions are based on supposition. While an
astrologer can forecast your fate, the conclusions cannot be scientifically proven. Astrology
requires you to believe in a force of destiny predetermined by the cosmos. This is not to
say that destiny replaces free will. Astrological calculations can foretell only possibilities.
The astrologer who foretold accurate possibilities was held in high esteem and paid hand-
somely. The astrologer who was proven wrong was not so lucky. He was either exiled or
executed.

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
Feng shui derives, in part, from astrological observations. While feng shui studies a build-
ing’s fate, a synthesis of heaven (time) and earth (space) luck, methods of Chinese astrol-
ogy like The Four Pillars of Destiny (Ziping Bazi), and Purple Constellation Fate
Computation (Ziwei Doushu) focus on man luck; a person’s natal character. You’ll learn
about The Four Pillars of Destiny in Part 7, “Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?”
32
A wide range of divinatory methods was used in China. Besides astrology, the
Chinese practiced chronomancy (an astro-calendrical system of determining favor-
able and unfavorable days), oneiromancy (divination based on dreams), physiog-
nomy (divination based on facial features), scapulimancy and plastromancy (divination
based on heating and interpreting the cracks formed on the scapula or shoulder
bones of animals and the plastron or bottom shell of turtles), and sortilege (divination by
drawing lots). The last method is especially significant to the formulation of the Yijing
(The Book of Changes), a book of divination written by King Wen and his son, the
Duke of Zhou, about 3,000 years ago.
Master Class
The Science of Astronomy
Astronomy is based on factual information derived from studying the cosmos. Chinese
astronomers dealt with the practical needs of society. They developed almanacs and calen-
dars. Because China’s farmers produced food for every stratum of civilization, it was
important for them to know the best times to plant and harvest their crops. According to
markings found on a bone fragment some 3,500 years ago, Chinese astronomers under-
stood the year is 3651⁄4 days long, a statistic strikingly similar to today’s precise measure-
ment of 365.24219.
Aided by astronomical instruments, the Chinese also observed and recorded a number of
celestial events:
◆They began noting eclipses of the moon in 1361 B.C.E. and eclipses of the sun in
1217 B.C.E.
◆They recorded a nova (an exploding star) in the area now known as Antares in 
1300 B.C.E.
◆They witnessed Haley’s comet in 467 B.C.E.
◆They documented a supernova (a really big exploding star) in 1054 C.E. Their accu-
rate observation allowed modern astronomers to establish that the supernova was
the origin of the Crab Nebula.

Chapter 3: The Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng Shui
By 400 B.C.E., Chinese skywatchers had recorded 1,464 stars, dividing many of them into
the 28 constellations of the zodiac.
Confucianism and Daoism:
Beginning in the sixth and fourth centuries B.C.E. respectively, two main schools of philos-
ophy flourished in China: Confucianism and Daoism.
Confucianism, based on the teachings of Confucius (551–479 B.C.E.), was a system of ethics
designed to cultivate moral virtues and social values in humankind. It dealt with practical
and earthly affairs. Confucius’s primary interest lay in proper behavior and social har-
mony. He emphasized rational knowledge and education. Later on, obedience to one’s
parents became one of the most important virtues of Confucianism. The philosophy
became so influential that it was taught in Chinese schools from the advent of the Han
reign in 206 B.C.E. to the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.
Daoism (also spelled Taoism), on the other
hand, was concerned with intuitive insight and
heavenly affairs. One could attain intuitive or
true knowledge by communing with nature and
being at one with it, the Dao (or what Westerns
variously call God, the Sea of Consciousness, the
Higher Power). To understand the Dao (also
spelled Tao) meant to recognize the inherent
unity of all things and live your life accordingly.
This meant trusting your intuition, your gut
instinct, your sixth sense. The person who could
cultivate his or her spirituality and develop this
kind of character is following the Dao.
There is great debate about who founded the
school of Daoism. While many steadfastly hold
the opinion that Laozi (also spelled Lao Tzu)
founded the school, many contemporary scholars disagree. In fact, they maintain that
Laozi, whom revered scholar Richard Wilhelm describes as a “shadowy figure,” is not an
individual, but a committee of like-minded people, who lived and taught from the fourth
to the second centuries B.C.E.
Huh? This is perplexing. But, what of Laozi’s famous work, the Daode jing (also spelled
Tao Teh Ching)? Well, how this legendary figure is connected to the text is a mystery (and
not our concern here). However, we do know that the Daode jing was actually written in
the Warring States Period (403–221 B.C.E.), at least 200 years after its purported author-
ship. We know this because the text is commented on and criticized by various people of
33
Confucianism, based
on the sixth-century B.C.E. teach-
ings of Confucius, is a system of
ethics designed to cultivate moral
perfection. Daoism is concerned
with intuitive knowledge acquired
by communicating with nature
and being at one with it, the
Dao. The founding fathers of
Daoism emerged as a group of
like-minded persons who lived
and taught from the fourth to the
second centuries B.C.E.

that era. Furthermore, the Daode jing and another great Daoist work called the Zhuangzi
(also spelled Chuang Tzu) was written by an actual person of the same name before the
school of Daoism emerged in the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.).
Experience vs. Experiment
To the Daoists, rational thinking and experimentation (hallmarks of the Western mindset)
are totally inadequate methods of understanding nature’s truths. True knowledge extends
beyond sensory perception; it can be experienced only in a meditative state of conscious-
ness. The Daoists quiet their minds to let nature’s truths flow into their beings from a
supreme force.
The Daoists believe you can’t comprehend the Dao, the
unnamed and unknowable, by describing it with words.
Words were limited, nature was limitless. Words
restricted, they barricaded the self from the universe of
truth. This is why the Daoists and other Eastern mys-
tics express their teachings in the form of aphorisms
(concise statements of a principle or truth), huatou
(paradoxical statements meant to be meditated upon to
gain sudden intuitive enlightenment), or illustrations.
These short verses showed the inconsistencies with
rational communication.
Reversal Is the Movement of the Dao
When anything comes to its extreme, be it on the natu-
ral or human plane, a reversal to the other extreme
takes place. This idea is central to both the Daoists and
the Confucianists. But what does it mean, you ask?
It means that everything is cyclical, moving through ceaseless cycles of birth, growth,
decay, and death. Everything is in a constant state of flux and change. Everything is inter-
related and interconnected. With the extreme of winter comes the beginning of spring
and renewal. With the extreme of night comes day. With the extreme of war comes peace.
With the extreme of despair comes hope, and so forth.
To achieve anything, the general rule of thumb is to acknowledge its opposite. You need
not experience it literally. Noting and respecting its possibility will help to keep you aware
of sudden shifts of fortune. For example, being content and humble safeguards the possi-
bility that the opposite nature won’t be reached. If you have wealth, recognize the possi-
bility that you may lose it. This concept has greatly impacted the Chinese to this day. It’s
all about balance and harmony.

Without going out of the door
You can know the ways of the 
world.
Without peeping through the 
window,
You can see the Way of 
Heaven.
The farther you go,
The less you know.
Thus, the sage knows without 
traveling,
Sees without looking,
And achieves without ado.

Chapter 3: The Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng Shui
This polarity of opposites is known as the theory of yin and yang. It is a fundamental
principle of feng shui. You’ll learn all about yin and yang in Chapter 5, “The Principle of
Yin and Yang,” but we’ll touch on it in the following sections.
Change Is in the Wind
Generally speaking, the philosophy of the Yijing, or Book of Changes, is the first known
attempt by the Chinese to formulate a system of knowledge around the interplay of oppo-
sites (yin and yang). The Yijing is a deceptively simple yet complex system of understand-
ing the patterns of change in our universe. The Yijing can foretell your present and future
prospects made manifest by changes you make in your attitude, actions, and activity. In
other words, the Yijing suggests the appropriate change to achieve the desired result.
These patterns of change were recorded symbolically in the form of solid (yang) and bro-
ken (yin) lines called trigrams and hexagrams. While we won’t concern ourselves with the
64 hexagrams (six-tiered configurations of solid and broken lines) comprising the Yijing,
the eight fundamental trigrams (three-tiered configurations of solid and broken lines) are
central to practicing classical feng shui. Simply, the eight trigrams represent transitional
stages of all possible natural and human situations.
35
The eight fundamental 
trigrams.
You’ll be learning all about the meaning of these trigrams in Chapter 7, “The Principle of
the Eight Trigrams.”
The Masked Origin of the Yijing
A lot of misinformation has been written about the origin of the Yijing. For the record,
here is a short chronology of its origins (part mythical, part historical). For more detailed
information, please see The Complete Idiot’s Guide to the I Ching (Alpha Books, 2001) by
Elizabeth Moran and Master Joseph Yu.
Initially, the Yijing was called the Zhouyi, or The Changes of Zhou. Initiated by King Wen
and completed by his son, the Duke of Zhou of the Zhou dynasty (1045–221 B.C.E.), the
Zhouyi draws on information gained by some of China’s legendary figures. Specifically, the
8 trigrams and 64 hexagrams (composed of 2 trigrams each) are thought to have been
devised by Fuxi.
As the story goes, the mythical sage-king Fuxi invented the eight trigrams after observing
celestial and terrestrial activity. The idea was to create heaven on earth, to emulate
nature’s perfection. Perhaps to reward his efforts, Fuxi received a gift from heaven, 

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
a diagram of the perfect world. A world that was motionless, void of change. Sometime
later, heaven bestowed a gift on another sage-king, Yu the Great. He also received a dia-
gram, but this one represented the world in motion. Called the Luoshu, this diagram (its
parts correlated to the eight trigrams) provides the foundation for a classical method of
feng shui called Flying Star, the subject of Part 5, “Feng Shui Mechanics 201.”
Returning to the development of the Yijing, sometime during the Han dynasty (206
B.C.E.–220 C.E.), scholars set about collecting the great texts of their culture. At this time,
commentaries, known as the Ten Wings, were attached to Zhouyi. Basically, the seven
essays “philosophized” the oracle by attempting to give meaning to the arrangement of
yin and yang lines composing each hexagram and the archaic text. The new compilation
was called the Yijing.
Changing Patterns
You might be interested to learn that trigram and hexagram symbols were not part of the
Zhouyi text. In the 1970s, Zheng Zhenglang, a Chinese scholar of the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences in Beijing, discovered that the symbols were recorded in numeric form,
a finding made after examining markings on oracle bones and bronze sacrificial containers
dating from 1500–1000 B.C.E. (the late Shang and early Zhou dynastic periods). Zheng’s
discovery proved that from the beginning, the Yijing was based on numerological divina-
tion. Looking back to the previous chapter, you’ll remember that the Chinese believed
their ancestors spoke to them using numbers. In other words, they believed the deceased
manipulated the stalks of yarrow (the instruments used in a casting procedure that yields a
hexagram, the answer to a question). Over time, the collection and examination of the
divinatory records produced a text that matched a question with a numeric answer, and an
answer with a likely result.
But, while the Chinese believe their forebears were responsible for imparting wisdom and
clarity, you may believe the answer is derived from the holistic realm of pure knowledge, a
totality that can be analyzed mathematically.
How Does Feng Shui Fit In?
Classical feng shui combines elements of astrology and astronomy, geology, physics,
mathematics, philosophy, and intuition—all the stuff you’ve just read about.
Now that you understand feng shui’s components, you can better appreciate what the
whole of feng shui means. Feng shui is the art and science of analyzing nature’s forces
with the intent of influencing its positive manifestations in you. A balanced environment
leads to better health, increased prosperity, and beneficial relationships. And who doesn’t
want that?
36

Chapter 3: The Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng Shui
Neolithic Feng Shui
Feng shui is a lot older than you might think. It predates Daoism, and even the Yijing. So
how old do you think feng shui is—2,000, 4,000, or 6,000 years old? If you guessed the
latter, you’re right—for the time being, anyway.
In 1988, a Neolithic gravesite was excavated in Henan province in central China. It re-
vealed that the ancient Chinese were practicing some form of primitive feng shui some
6,000 years ago.
The head of the gravesite is rounded and points toward the south. The grave is squared at
the body’s feet, facing north. This arrangement conforms to the Chinese view of the cos-
mos. Symbolically, the sky is represented as round or domed, and the earth as square or
flat. On each side of the remains, and outlined with shells, is a representation of two
Chinese constellations—the azure dragon and the white tiger. A representation of the Big
Dipper (Beidou) lies in the center. These artifacts testify to the fact that the Neolithic
Chinese were already orienting their graves with the revolution of the Big Dipper around
the North Star, the polestar (in Ursa Minor) in the northern hemisphere toward which
the axis of the earth points.
The Form School of Feng Shui
The Form School (Xingfa) is the first and oldest school of feng shui officially dating to
Qing Wuzi’s (whom many believe is a fictitious figure) late Han (190–220 C.E.) text, the
Zangjing or Classic of Burial. Some 100 years later, Guo Pu clarified and expanded upon
the Zangjing in his book, the Zangshu or the Book of Burial, the same text from where the
term feng shui derives.
Even before Daoism and Confucianism, ancestor worship was an intrinsic and important
part of the Chinese belief system. They believed the spirits of the deceased directly af-
fected the well-being of the living. Fortunes could be made or lost depending, in some
measure, on the favorable location and orientation of their ancestors’ tombs. If you think
this is an outdated custom, think again. Today, feng shui masters run a brisk business
selecting the most auspicious gravesites for their clientele.
37
The term “feng shui” was first used in Guo Pu’s (276–324 C.E.) Zangshu (Book of
Burial), a short text describing the disposition of qi (life’s breath) on the earth’s plane.
Yet, earlier, during the Warring States Period (403–221 B.C.E.), feng shui was known
as an art of divination called kanyu. “Kan” means “way of heaven” and “yu,” “way of
the earth.” Together, kanyu translates: “The way of heaven and earth.”
Feng Facts

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
The orientation of homes is also a part of Form School
feng shui. Landforms and waterways were intensely
scrutinized to determine the location of the dragon’s
lair (long xue), the place on the terrain where qi con-
verges. The place that qi can be carried by the wind
(feng) and settle in water (shui). In today’s urbanized
world, buildings, fences, and hedges represent terres-
trial features and roadways represent watercourses.
You’ll learn more about this in Chapter 8, “ Turtles,
Tigers, and Dragons, Oh My: Evaluating Your
Environment,” and Chapter 9, “Home Sweet Home:
Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings.”
The intuitive approach characterized Form School feng
shui.
The Compass School of Feng Shui
The term Compass School is a Western invention. In Chinese, the school that uses a com-
pass and analyzes heavenly (time) and earthly (space) forces is called Liqi Pai, Patterns of
Qi School. Because the English translation is a mouthful, we’ll conform to the Western
vernacular.
Formally dating to the Spring and Autumn Period (722–481 B.C.E.) with a simplistic
method called Diagramatic Houses for the Five Families (Tuzhai Wuxing), which is no
longer used, the Compass School is an umbrella term
encompassing a host of more sophisticated techniques
that are still widely used today. Flying Star (Xuankong
Feixing), Three Harmonies (Sanhe), Mystical Doors
(Qi Men), and Changing Trigrams/Eight House/Eight
Mansions/The East West System (Yigua) are examples
of Compass School methods.
The Compass School is based on the concept that each
of the eight cardinal directions holds a different type 
of qi. Around this central premise, other factors are
added, including astrology and numerology. The Com-
pass School method is very computational, relying on
intellect, observation, and experimentation rather than
intuitive insights.
38
Form School or Xingfa
(“Xing” means form and “fa”
means method) is the first and
oldest school of feng shui first
explained in the late Han
(190–220 C.E.) text called the
Zangjing (Classic of Burial). The
idea was to locate the place on
the terrain where qi converges—
the place where qi rides the
wind (feng) and settles in water
(shui).

The term Compass
School is a misnomer, invented

method that studies the effects of
time (heavenly forces) and space
(earthly forces) on the well-being
of an individual. The tool of the
trade is the compass.
Wise Words

Chapter 3: The Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng Shui
The tool of the trade is, you guessed it, the compass. An early version dating to about 
83 C.E. was a two-part, south-pointing instrument—a metal spoon made of magnetic 
lodestone and a square baseplate (see the color insert) called a sinan. This developed into
what is now called a luopan compass (see
the cover photo) used by practitioners
today. The luopan has anywhere from 4 to
40 concentric rings of information featuring
things like the 8 fundamental trigrams, the
28 constellations, the 5 phases of qi, and the
9 “stars” or numbers of the Luoshu.
But, for your purposes, all you need is a basic pro-
tractor compass with clear markings (refer to
Chapter 1, “What Is Feng Shui?” for specific
guidelines in choosing a compass).
Feng Shui Today
Today, both Form School and Compass School methods are used to perform an accurate
feng shui reading. For the most part, today’s practitioners have combined both schools
into one system commonly referred to as “classical” or “traditional” feng shui.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about qi, the physical and metaphysical life force under-
lying all things.

◆Qi: the life force at the heart of it all
◆How other cultures define qi
◆The three primal forces of qi: heaven qi, earth qi, and human qi
◆Good vibes and bad vibes: types of qi
What we’ve been describing as nature’s “forces” is what the Chinese call qi
(also spelled ch’i). Qi has many meanings. It’s described as the air we breathe.
It’s the earth’s magnetic field, cosmic radiation, and the sun’s light. Qi is our
spirit. Qi is luck. As you shall soon see, qi underlies all these things and more.
While this may seem somewhat abstract to us Westerners, Eastern cultures
believe this holistic force governs our health, wealth, and happiness. Feng shui
seeks to harness qi’s positive aspects to better our well-being.
Now, to be perfectly clear, the existence of qi can’t be fully scientifically
proven. In fact, some of qi’s more mystical aspects can never be proven using
quantitative measurement. For example, can you prove the existence of your
“sixth sense”? Can you prove luck or fate? Can you prove intuition? Surely
not. Yet, most us believe these things exist. Simply, qi’s metaphysical or super-
natural features defy measurement. 
Chapter

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
But, we shouldn’t be too hasty and dismiss this notion
of a partly nonmeasurable force. After all, it wasn’t 
so long ago that Benjamin Franklin “discovered” 
electricity—considered a mysterious force of nature at
the time. We certainly have harnessed this energy, mak-
ing our lives more pleasurable in the process. And what
about the discovery of x-rays, radioactivity, and sub-
atomic particles? All have led to a profound revolution
in how we view the world.
This chapter is all about understanding qi, the founda-
tion upon which many Eastern practices are based. So,
keep your mind open and let’s take a journey into the
force unifying us all.
What Is Qi?
Simply, qi (pronounced chee) is the underlying quintessence, “soul,” and “substance” of
all things. It is the all-encompassing, all-permeating, unifying force at the heart of the
heavenly, earthly, and human realms. Both physical and metaphysical, qi is the fundamen-
tal, vital, nourishing force that drives life forward. It is the field of information connecting
us all. Although there is no direct English translation for qi, it can best be called “life’s
breath.” 
This definition may seem rather vague and even abstract. But actually, the idea of qi bears
a striking resemblance to the quantum field in modern physics. Fritjof Capra in his best-
selling book, The Tao of Physics (Shambhala Publica-
tions, 1991), makes the correlation: “Like the quantum
field, qi is conceived as a tenuous and nonperceptible
form of matter which is present throughout space and
can condense into solid material objects. The field, or
qi, is not only the underlying essence of all material
objects, but also carries their mutual interactions in the
form of waves.”
Still need clarification? Qi is the “stuff” of and behind
it all. It’s the stuff that breathes life into plants, animals,
the mountains, oceans, and us. It’s the stuff of dreams,
intuition, fate, and luck. It’s the stuff at the core of non-
living matter such as airplanes, buildings, and the chair
on which you sit. It’s the stuff acupuncturists stimulate
42
Qi is the underlying and
unifying “substance” and “soul”
of all things. Both physical and
metaphysical, qi is the nourishing
force at the heart, growth, and
development of the heavens,
earth, and humanity. It is also
called “life’s breath.”

The Chinese concept of qi was
first recorded in the Ten Wings,
a Warring States Period (403–

which was later renamed the
Yijing (The Book of Changes).

with their needles. It’s the stuff martial artists conjure up to split solid objects. And, it’s the
stuff feng shui practitioners harness to improve the health, wealth, and relationships of
their clients.
Qi Around the World
The concept of qi is not unique to the Chinese. It’s also known to other cultures:
◆Ki to the Japanese
◆Prana to the Hindus
◆Pneuma to the Greeks
◆Ankh to the Egyptians
◆Ruah to the Hebrews
◆Tane to the Hawaiians
◆Arunquiltha to the Australian Aborigine
◆Orenda to the Iroquois
Whatever you choose to call it, identifying, controlling, and directing this invisible life
force for the benefit of your well-being is what feng shui’s all about.
Qi on the Move
Qi moves. It is in a perpetual process of change. Qi accumulates, disperses, expands, and
condenses. It moves fast, slow, in, out, up, and down. Qi meanders and spirals. It flows
along straight, angular, and curved pathways. It rides the wind (feng) and is retained in
water (shui). There’s no escaping qi’s influence. We are all products of, and subject to, qi’s
enormous power.
The Three Forces of Qi Energy
The Chinese believe three primal forces of qi sustain all that exists: heaven qi, earth qi,
and human qi. To ignore their effects on your body is like ignoring a virus that weakens and
depletes your strength. Viruses and other setbacks (like financial loss, unemployment, and
illness) can be directly challenged through a harnessing of qi’s beneficial qualities, leading
to a strengthened body, an alert mind, and a full and contented spirit.
What does this mean exactly? As you will come to learn in later chapters, the ancient
Chinese have determined how to manipulate qi such that it promotes harmony in your
living/working space. When there is balance and harmony in your environment, there’s a
43

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
good chance your being will be in balance, too. Of course, you must also maintain a
proper diet and exercise regime. You must get a good night’s rest. You must live by the
Golden Rule. All of these components foster a healthful whole. Only when we are at our
optimum capacity can we be inspired to succeed.
Within these forces, there exists an abundance of other lines of qi that impact every aspect
of our lives—as you’ll see a little later in this chapter.
44
We are the balance of heav-
enly and earthly forces. 
Heaven Qi
What comes from above is known as heaven qi. It’s the first force of nature. It’s the qi that
spirals down from the celestial heavens—the sun, moon, planets, and stars. If you have
difficulty accepting the idea that heavenly qi can affect us, consider the sun, the central
star of our solar system. Without its force, life would cease to exist. Disregard its force,
and you may be prone to sunburn, heatstroke, skin cancer, and even death.
And the moon? Well, if the moon can deform the shape of the solid earth and the oceans
roughly every 12 hours, doesn’t it stand to reason that its forces will, in some measure,
affect you? After all, the earth’s main component is water—and so is ours. In fact, when

Chapter 4: Qi Wiz! It’s Life’s Force!
the moon is full, we tend to retain water. Also, the migration and reproductive patterns of
animals, fish, and birds conform to or are in harmony with the moon’s phases. The same
applies to vegetation. Studies have shown that planting seeds two days before to seven
days after a new moon yields a better crop.
Weather qi is also a component of heaven qi.
There’s no question that weather phenomena
affect our well-being. Extremes of cold “chill us
to the bone,” while extremes of heat create
“dog-day afternoons” and heighten passions. For
some people, lack of daylight and long periods of
rain cause depression—even suicide. Although this
is more common in northern countries, any vari-
ant in weather can influence a person’s health and
mood.
Finally, heaven qi is associated with time, a factor
indubitably associated with change and transfor-
mation. The time of day and season changes as a
result of celestial activity. The time your home
was constructed is essential information, for it
determines, in part, the inherent personality of
your dwelling.
Earth Qi
The forces of mountains, waterways, deserts, valleys, and plains all carry earth qi currents
that can affect our physical health, temperament, and compatibility with others. While
mountain ranges protect us from harsh elements, they also provide psychological support.
We tend to feel more stable and grounded if there is a mountain to our backs. 
In classical feng shui, the mountain force is synonymous with the yin or female force of
nature. Like a mother guarding her children from illness caused by gusting winds and tor-
rential rain, the mountain force governs our health and relationships. A feng shui practi-
tioner’s goal is to study and direct qi associated with the external mountains (or man-made
mountains such as buildings and tall hedges) surrounding the dwelling, and internal
mountains made manifest as walls and large furniture so that they bolster good health and
relations with other people.
Conversely, watercourses correspond to the yang or male force. Traditionally, the man is
responsible for generating wealth. Like water’s flow, wealth qi is retained in lakes and
oceans. It’s carried down rivers, streets, and hallways. It flows through windows and door-
ways. All of these things must be considered when assessing a person’s living and/or work-
ing space. 
45
If you feel different dur-
ing a full moon, it’s not just your
imagination! A condition called
“Full-Moon Madness” can occur
when an excess of fluid accumu-
lates in the skull, causing some of
us to feel increased levels of pas-
sion, anxiety, and tension. In
fact, the word lunatic (“luna”
means moon in Latin) derives
from the notion that the moon’s
phases produce lunacy, insanity. 
Feng Alert

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
Finding a balance among natural elements is the funda-
mental premise of classical feng shui. You’ll learn more
about this in Chapter 8, “ Turtles, Tigers, and Dragons,
Oh My: Evaluating Your Environment,” and Chapter
9, “Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and 
Its Surroundings,” as well as in Part 5, “Feng Shui
Mechanics 201,” where mountain (health and relation-
ship) and water (wealth) qi manifest as number schemes
on a qi map.
The earth’s magnetic field is also a component of earth
qi. Coupled with the time your house was constructed,
the magnetic orientation characterizes your home’s qi,
its innate essence. It’s important also to understand that
the electromagnetic field influences the quality of qi
flowing into and inhabiting your house. There’s no question that fields generated by high-
voltage power lines and modern-day electrical conveniences affect our health in some way.
We must be mindful of such potential and exercise caution when we use electrical appli-
ances and live in close proximity to power plants, electrical transformers, and the like.
Human Qi
You have qi, too. Your own qi is marked at birth, the time when you inhaled your first
breath. Like a fingerprint, your qi is singular and unique. In feng shui, the year of your
birth is a vital source of information. The energy you were born into (your birth year)
determines how your life force is compatible to that of other people and to your home’s
qi. This notion will become clearer when you learn a method of feng shui called Eight
House—the sole subject of Part 4, “Feng Shui Mechanics 101.”
For now, understand that many Western scientists and medical experts are accepting and
embracing the idea that some kind of vital and holistic force exists within the body that
regulates the totality of our mental and physical well-being. Moreover, this bio-network
connects us with the whole of our environment, and on a broader scale, the collective
consciousness, the source of pure knowledge. In fact, the force field emanating from your
body (what many call an aura) can actually be captured on film. Known as Kirlian photog-
raphy, the technique was developed by two Russian scientists, Semyon and Valentina
Kirlian.
While the connective force within the human body is known by many names in the West
(the odic force, life fields, entelechy, animal electricity, subtle spirit, pneuma, for example),
generally the progressive Western pioneers who have adopted the idea believe the field is
electrical in nature. Well, human qi may very well be partly electrical, but let’s not lose
sight of the fact that aspects of this unifying force cannot be measured or fully understood
46
Those who live in the mountains
tend to be more stubborn, loyal,
and honest. Like a mountain,
these people are unmovable and
steadfast in their values. Those of
us who live near water, on the
other hand, tend to “go with the

with our five senses of sight, taste, smell, touch, and hearing. Harkening back to the
beginning of this chapter, remember that qi is physical and metaphysical (beyond physical
or supernatural), the latter including fate, luck, and intuition.
Nevertheless, it seems that experts in divergent fields (physics, biology, psychology, reli-
gion, anthropology, neurology, and linguistics, for example) are coming together, realizing
that the question about our existence and purpose in life cannot be answered by any one
part. Using an analogy, a cake is created by the fusion of distinct and different ingredients.
Similarly, the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of a house is a result of layers of merging
information. Get the idea?

Besides feng shui (which seeks to balance your home’s qi), the Chinese also use
acupuncture to restore balance to your body’s qi. They believe 14 interconnected main
qi highways (meridians) exist on each side of the body that surface at some 360
acupuncture points. The meridians correspond to one or more specific areas or organs.
When an imbalance or illness occurs, an acupuncturist stimulates the appropriate points
with needles. Also, there’s The Four Pillars of Destiny. This is a method of Chinese astrol-
ogy that studies your birth qi. Here, you can learn to calculate your luck. You can deter-
mine the colors, environment, and career best suited to you. We offer the beginning
level of Four Pillars in Part 7, “Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?”

Feeling Qi’s Power
How qi directly or indirectly affects you is vital to your state of being. To illustrate this
point, let’s do a simple exercise. But first, turn off the television and radio, and find a quiet
place free of distractions. It’s important that you actually participate in this exercise to
fully understand how qi’s flow impacts you.
Ready?
Now, look at the following photo. Imagine you are sitting on the bench facing the water-
fall. If we told you that suddenly the falls rushed at you in violent gushes of water, wind,
and noise, buffeting and overwhelming your being, how would you feel? Scared, confused,
disoriented, or tired perhaps? But what if we told you the water gently sprays in a cool
cascade of mist and soft, gentle breezes, soothing and refreshing your body? Does this
sensation promote feelings of relaxation, balance, comfort, and security? The feeling is
quite different, isn’t it?

Part 1: Let’s Get Into Feng Shui
What we’ve demonstrated is how the flow of qi can affect your mood—and ultimately
your health—over a period of time. Nourishing qi circulates. It gently revolves and
curves. It creates a healthful, balanced environment. Strong qi (or what is actually called
sha qi—a term you’ll soon learn) disturbs, especially if you’re in its powerful path. Strong
qi can cause mental and physical illness. Qi can also be weak. Weak qi is stagnant and
sickly. A stuffy, airless room is an example of weak qi.
So, can we control weak or negative qi? Absolutely! If the waterfall featured in the pre-
ceding photograph was a flood of gushing water, wouldn’t you move? If your house is
stuffy, wouldn’t you instinctively open a window to let fresh air circulate? While much of
feng shui relies on plain old common sense, there are factors that are not obvious. Like
determining the quality of qi your home innately carries. And, the change in qi ushered in
with each new year. You’ll learn how to determine these numerological aspects in upcom-
ing chapters.

Sheng Qi
Sheng qi is positive qi. It carries auspicious currents that nourish your well-being. We can
detect some of sheng qi’s aspects with our five senses:
1. Sight sheng. Manicured gardens and
lawns, neatly painted exteriors, tidy, clean,
and organized interiors, and happy and
cooperative people. Basically, sight sheng
is anything you find pleasing to the eye.
2. Sound sheng. Babbling brooks/fountains,
chirping birds, wind chimes, cooing babies,
certain types of music. It’s important to
understand, however, that what you may consider soothing to the ear, may be an
auditory disturbance to someone else. For example, many people prefer quiet soli-
tude or the peace of rural areas or suburbs. Others thrive on the high-intensity
atmosphere of cities. While you may find classical music soothing, your friend may
disagree, changing the station to rock-and-roll.
3. Touch sheng. Smooth surfaces, pets, a warm bath, a kiss, a massage, silk, satin, and
velvet are examples of touch sheng.
4. Smell sheng. Flowers, perfume, scented candles, and food inspire smell sheng.
Again, what you find a pleasing, fragrant odor, another person may find sickening.
Cigarette smoke is an example of subjective smell sheng.
5. Taste sheng. Home-cooked meals, comfort food, chocolate, a fine wine or liqueur
are all associated with taste sheng. It is anything you find satisfying. If this includes
tobacco products, then, for you, these items are taste sheng.
There also exists a sixth sheng qi. Somewhat esoteric and metaphysical, it can be com-
pared to your “sixth sense.” It is the “vibe” you feel when you’re about to get a raise or a
promotion. It’s how you feel when you “click” with someone. It’s the feeling of being “in
love.” Sheng qi is the “look” of confidence and contentment. It’s the resonance of helpful
and kind people.
Sha Qi
Sha qi is negative qi. It carries inauspicious currents that create negative influences on
your body. Sha qi is anything antagonistic to your five senses:
1. Sight sha. Glaring lights; dark places; offensive, disturbing art; clutter; trash; dead
or dying things; and anything you find threatening or looming. We believe a good
example of the latter is the interior of the pyramid-theme Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas.

Upon entering the inverted interior, you are at the
mercy of overhanging tiers of floors, which can cause
vertigo. It looks and feels as if the upper levels can and
will come crashing down on you like a house of cards.
(We left with a headache, feeling disoriented and quite
off balance!) Sight sha also includes acts of violence,
prejudice, or intolerance.
2. Sound sha. Noise pollution like traffic, sirens, construction work, loud arguments,
screaming babies, and certain types of music are examples of sound sha.
3. Touch sha. Grime, filth, dust, and mold; splinters, cracks, and tears. Maneuvering a
rickety staircase or bridge, skating on thin ice, and scaling unsteady terrain are
examples of touch sha, as are unwanted sexual advances and physical aggression.
4. Smell sha. Pollution, exhaust fumes, mildew, rot, pollen, and toxins are examples of
smell sha.
5. Taste sha. Bitter, sour, rotten, food. Unfamiliar foodstuffs might prove distasteful
and unpleasant experiences. Yet, we must remember that raw fish, insects, and sea-
weed are considered normal foods by many cultures. Vegetarians find animal prod-
ucts unpalatable.
Just like there exists an extrasensory sheng qi, so, too, is there a sixth sha qi. It is the
“vibe” you feel when “Something’s in the air,” or when “You can cut the tension with a
knife.” It’s the queasy feeling you get when “Something’s wrong,” or when you feel you
are being watched or followed. This sixth sha also takes the form of anger, hate, and jeal-
ousy. It can be the resonance of “evil spirits.”
Poison Arrow Qi
Also called, “killing breath,” poison arrow qi hits you like a bullet. The offending culprit
can be straight roads, opposing doorways or windows; sharp, pointed edges of objects and
buildings; and anything else directed at you in a straight line. 
Poison arrow qi is extremely inauspicious and carries misfortune, illness, and even disas-
ter. You will be learning more about poison arrow qi and how to avoid and remedy it in
Chapters 8 and 9.

As you’re learning, feng shui is the art and science of living in harmony with your envi-

Simply, with humankind acting as matchmaker, heaven and earth qi marry. While the
changing forces of heaven qi correspond to the time in which your house was constructed,
the stable force of earth qi corresponds to the magnetic space it sits on. Viewing it this
way, wouldn’t it make sense to produce a good marriage, one generating prosperity, com-
patibility, and good health? Its influence affecting your well-being positively and produc-

principles—the same principles that form the basis of Chinese medicine,
acupuncture, martial arts, and military strategy.
First, you’ll learn about yin and yang, the eternal interplay of opposites gov-
erning all that exists. Next, you’ll learn about the five phases, the backbone 
of feng shui and other Chinese disciplines. (The five phases are particularly
important because their principles hold the key to remedying and enhancing

The Principle of 
Yin and Yang
In This Chapter
◆The source of everything
◆Yin: The passive principle
◆Yang: The active principle
Can there be male and no female? Can there be left and no right? Can there
be hot and no cold? How about day and no night, or anger and no happiness?
Of course not. Although each is a counterpart of the other, each is dependent
on the other’s existence. Separate but together, yin and yang illustrate the evo-
lution of all things.
The concept of yin and yang is the first principle of feng shui. Initially yin and
yang meant the shady (yin) and sunny (yang) sides of a hill, an idea ascribed to
Zhou ancestor Gong Liu when he set about selecting an auspicious site for 
his people. However, some five centuries later during the mid to late Zhou
dynasty (c. 770–481 B.C.E.), yin and yang came to symbolize the two primal
forces of qi. Yin was classified as the female principle of nature, and thus, was
regarded as passive and weak. Yang was classified as the male principle of
nature and was regarded as active and strong.
Chapter

Part 2: The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui
The yin-yang and wuxing (the five phases of qi which you’ll learn about in the next chap-
ter) models were used to explain the structure, order, and change within the universe.
Perhaps the primary champion of correlating the cosmological theories was the Naturalist
philosopher, Zou Yan (305–240 B.C.E.). A follower of Confucian and Mencian teachings,
Zou Yan was given considerable space as a leading intellectual thinker in the Shiji (Records
of the Grand Historian), a Western Han (206–24 B.C.E.) text assembled by Sima Tan and his
son, Sima Qian.
The concept of yin and yang is firmly embedded in Chinese philosophy, science, and
medicine. In fact, the terms yin and yang originate in the Dazhuan or Great Commentary
of the Yijing. The Dazhuan, along with six other essays (collectively called the Ten Wings
or Shi Yi, in Chinese), were philosophical theories about the meaning of the divinatory
text written some 600 years earlier by King Wen and his son, the Duke of Zhou. 
Needless to say, the principle of yin and yang is fundamental to understanding and prac-
ticing feng shui. Master the principle and you will forever change the way you interact
with people, your living/working environment, and the outside natural world.
The Big Bang, Chinese Style
Ever since the dawn of humankind we’ve wondered where we come from. Where did it
all begin? Why are we here? What happens when we die? Indeed, the mystery of life
intrigues us all, spawning all sorts of theories attempting to answer these age-old ques-
tions. Many of us believe an all-knowing, all-seeing presence created everything. In the
West, this presence is variously called God, the Supreme Force, or the Sea of Conscious-
ness. Some believe we’re a product of pure happenstance. Others even maintain extra-
terrestrial creatures planted us on planet earth as colonists. (Of course, there’s also the
strictly scientific approach, but we won’t get into that here.)
No one really knows for sure the true source of existence. Yet, our curiosity and determi-
nation drive us forward to investigate and understand the unknown.
The Nothing of Everything
The Chinese Daoists have their own idea. By observing nature’s forces and monitoring
their effect on our bodies, they’ve concluded we are a microcosm of the macrocosmic nat-
ural world. This means the microcosmic (“small”) universe within our bodies is a reflec-
tion of the macrocosmic (“big”) universe outside of our bodies. Therefore, a comparison
can be drawn between our own birth and the birth of the universe. 
The Daoists believe that we come from a great void out of which everything emerges.
They call this great void Wuji. Wuji is believed to be the fountainhead of creation, the
source of pure knowledge. It is expressed as a circle, an unbroken whole.
56

Chapter 5: The Principle of Yin and Yang
Symbolizing eternal motion and wholeness, the circle may appear empty, containing noth-
ing. Yet, actually, it’s full of possibility. Similar to the womb, it is both empty and full.
When an egg (yin) is fertilized by a sperm (yang), the unified state is broken. The tranquil
nucleus containing ceaseless possibilities is set in motion, ready to give life. Change
occurs. The single primordial entity divides, forming the two fundamental qi forces of the
universe—yin and yang. They are represented as tadpole-like symbols, with a bulge at the
top for the head and a pointed end for the tail. Since fish swim head first, this shape
accounts for taiji’s (the composite of yin and yang) “movement,” or balancing motion.
Yin: The Feminine Side
Yin is expressed as the stable matter of earth. It contracts and condenses. Yin represents
the passive principle in nature exhibited as darkness, cold, and wetness. On a human level,
yin symbolizes femininity and inertia. Other traits of yin are shown in the following figure.

You may be wondering (especially if you’re female) if yin’s dark qualities express the
Chinese view of women. No! Even though yin’s associated traits may seem offensive, they
are not meant to be taken personally. Think about it—yin is quiet and inward. Tradi-
tionally, women stayed at home inside their dwelling. Women receive sperm (inward) and
protect the fetus inside. As you shall soon see, yang is associated with the male, activity,
and outwardness. Traditionally, men are more active outside of the home. Men send
sperm outward.

But what does the dot mean, you ask? Well, it’s not a
dot at all; rather, a knowing awareness. The white eye
amid yin’s blackness symbolizes the potential for
change. Nothing can be wholly yin, just as nothing can
be wholly yang. For example, night inevitably changes
into day; death and decay always give rise to new life.
Even the most heinous criminal and stingiest tightwad
have a hint of goodness in them. Just think of Ebenezer
Scrooge or the Grinch who stole Christmas!
Yang: The Masculine Side
Yang is expressed as heaven force. Yang expands. It represents the active principle in
nature exhibited as light, heat, and dryness. On a human level, yang represents masculin-
ity and the positive side of our emotions. Yang represents the land of the living; yin the
realm of the dead. Other traits of yang are shown in the following figure.

Yang also contains an aspect of its counterpart, giving credence to the phrase, “What goes
up, must come down.” If the sun didn’t rise, we’d all die. If you don’t give your body a
rest after a strenuous workout, you might drop dead from exhaustion. Get the idea?
The Symbol of Taiji—Opposites Do Attract
The taiji symbol illustrates the eternal inter-
action between yin and yang. Like two sides 
of a coin, yin can never separate from yang.
Together, yin and yang represent the law of
nature: perpetual and unceasing change. Time
changes, seasons change, qi changes, your envi-
ronment changes, and you change. Indeed, the
universe, and everything in it, oscillates from birth
to death in a beautiful dance of intertwining and
interconnected energy.
The “S”-like curve separating/connecting yin and yang illustrates that nothing is com-
plete, fixed, or absolute. In other words, life isn’t defined by rigid black and white think-
ing, but rather varying shades of gray. In yin there is the seed of yang, a white tone. In
yang there is a seed of yin, a black tone. In the clearest sky you’ll find a cloud; in the dark-
est night you’ll find a star. On your happiest day, there is a hint of sadness; on your sad-
dest day, there is hope.

Despite how complicated the universe may seem, everything is subject to the laws of yin
and yang. Finding a balance between the two is primary to feng shui.
Which Way Is Up?
No doubt you’ve seen various illustrations of the taiji. But have you ever wondered if
there is a correct orientation? While an argument can be made that a model in motion
cannot possibly have a defined point of reference, we say that if you had to capture the
taiji on a two-dimension plane, a certain configuration embodies the inherent meaning of
the symbol. Let’s take another look at the symbol in the following figure.
60
The traditional orientation of
the taiji.
In Chinese cosmology, the south is always situated at
the top. This is because it’s the direction from which
warmth and soft winds come, factors that favorably
influence crop yield and good health. As you’ve just
learned, summer and noon are symbolic of yang.
Because heat rises, it follows logically that yang’s “head”
of energy orients at the top-left side of the taiji. The
fact that the sun rises in the east further illustrates
yang’s orientation.
Conversely, north is associated with cold, harsh winds, barbaric attacks, and possible ill-
ness. The north is symbolic of yin qi. The “weight” of cold “falls.” Summer slides into

autumn. The sun sets in the west. Daylight descends to midnight. Get the idea? Logically,
then, the black head of yin should rest at the bottom-right side of the taiji.
Yin and Yang Culture Clash
The imbalance of the world’s ideas, values, and attitudes can be explained using yin-yang
terminology. Perhaps if Eastern and Western cultures recognize that each contains an ele-
ment of the other, factions and frictions can heal. Only then can we unite in harmony.
Only then can we say the earth is but one country, one people.
Western Yang
Let’s face it, we Westerners are yang-oriented. We consistently favor the masculine over
feminine; reason over faith; separation over integration; and spending over saving. Our
impatience has given rise to fast-food restaurants, microwave ovens, automatic teller
machines, self-service gas stations, credit cards, and the ubiquitous remote control. We
are besieged with advertisements for all kinds of things, each claiming to be “the best.”
Such thinking filters down to national and individual levels, causing division. When will
we realize that we as a culture, and we as individuals, aren’t better than our neighbors?
Yet, as the principle of yin and yang teaches, our “yangness” will eventually revolve to yin.
Remember, balance must be achieved. As the seasons give way to one another, the day to
night, so too do yin and yang. In fact, we can witness this evolution now. Holistic health
care, strengthening faith, and movements for social equality all embody the yin in our cul-
ture. Can we build, construct, and evolve further? Feng shui provides an answer.
61
“Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt
himself over the other. Ponder at all times in your hearts how ye were created. Since
We have created you all from one same substance it is incumbent on you to be even
as one soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the
same land, that from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of one-
ness and the essence of detachment may be manifest.”

Part 2: The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui
Eastern Yin
Our Eastern counterparts have traditionally been more yin-oriented. They favor philoso-
phy and religion over science; intuitive wisdom over rational knowledge; traditions over
progress; family over the individual. Developing the inner spirit has always taken prece-
dence over materialism, technology, and the outer world. Respecting nature’s beauty has
been far more important than extracting something from it.
However, the seed of yang is growing. Now more than ever, the Chinese are embracing
Western ideas. Elevating their national status, economically and progressively, has become
paramount. The spirit of yangness that produced the many scientific and technological
advances discussed in Chapter 3, “The Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng
Shui,” is returning. The balance is shifting as yin revolves into yang.
Yin and Yang and Feng Shui
So what do yin and yang have to do with feng shui? A lot. If yin and yang aren’t balanced
in your environment, their imbalance can produce unwanted emotional and physical
effects. We have many clients who complain of fatigue, depression, and lack of motiva-
tion. Generally, these people spend much time in dark places. Conversely, we have clients
who live in bright, sun-filled homes, offering no relief from the sun’s intensity. Is it any
surprise these clients complain of headaches?
Much of feng shui relies on plain old common sense. If a room is dark, add more light. If
a room is overly bright, add window blinds or curtains. If a room is stuffy, open the win-
dow. If it’s too warm or too cool, adjust the thermostat. This is the easy stuff. Yet, life is
not always easy. Feng shui is here to help us confront and overcome the difficulties.

The Principle of 
the Five Phases
In This Chapter
◆Understanding the five phases of fire, earth, metal, water, and wood
◆Learning the cycles of the five phases
◆Balancing qi using the five phases
With keen interest the ancients watched, monitored, compared, and con-
trasted that which occurred in nature to that which was made manifest in our
bodies and in our lives. Over time, an accumulation of knowledge and experi-
ence produced the principle of the five phases. Based on an acceptance of how
the world operated, the principle offered a predictable and systematic solution
to how qi moves through the cyclic changes of yin and yang.
In feng shui, the interaction of the five phases is used extensively to enhance
positive qi and correct negative qi. Understanding its cycles is what this chap-
ter’s all about. The principle of the five phases is the backbone of feng shui.
Also, you’ll need a solid understanding of the phase relationships in order to
make sense of the two methods of feng shui we present in this book—Eight

House and Flying Star, as well as a method of Chinese astrology called The Four Pillars
of Destiny—something you’ll learn about in Parts 4, 5, and 7, respectively.
What Are the Five Phases?
Like yin and yang, the five phases are five characteristics or types of qi that change over
time. For example, ice, snow, steam, and fog represent types of water that transform over
time. Similarly, the five phases are five physical elements in nature—fire, earth, metal,
water, and wood—that represent different manifestations of qi. The operative word here is
phases. The movement, transformation, and interaction of each phase are what is studied,
not the particular element itself. Remember, a tree, a rock, and a human being are actu-
ally bundles of intertwining energy—phases interacting. From creation and birth to matu-
rity and decay, everything revolves around the changes of yin and yang.
The ancient Chinese believed that the interaction of
the five phases creates all that exists on the heaven,
earth, and human planes. Each phase has its own qi
character, and thus interacts with other phases in differ-
ent ways. Fire qi radiates, earth qi compacts, metal qi
contracts, water qi falls, and wood qi grows upward.
How the five phases interact with one another deter-
mines the balance of qi in nature, in our living/working
space, and in our beings.
If It’s Fire, It Must Be Summer
Each phase element is associated with a season, direction(s), weather condition, color(s),
number(s), and a trigram (the subject of the next chapter). Referring to the following
table, you may question why earth can have three direction values, or how numbers corre-
spond to each element. This is because the five phases, the eight trigrams, and the
Luoshu, or magic square (which we’ll tell you about in the coming Chapter 13, “The
Flying Stars, Part 1”), have been correlated into a nice, neat package.
What does this mean? In the early Warring States period (475–221 B.C.E.), the principles
of the five phases, the eight trigrams, and the nine numbers of the Luoshu magic square
all existed separately. By the time of the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.), the principles
combined, correlating into an integrated whole.

First, the five phases were correlated to the
four cardinal directions. With the phase
earth placed in the center, fire-metal-water-
wood readily connected to south-west-
north-east. Then, this diagram was
correlated to the eight directions, eight tri-
grams, and nine numbers of the Luoshu. Of
course, correlating four- and five-term systems to
eight- and nine-term systems posed problems. To
solve the matter, the Chinese arbitrarily assigned
phases to the four corner directions/Luoshu num-
bers. All of this may seem confusing. To better
grasp what we’ve described, find the illustration 
of the nine-celled grid (called the bagua) in

northeast, southwest, and the center cell of the bagua (a term you’ll become familiar with
in the next chapter).

In Chinese, the five phases are
known as wuxing or tech-
nically, wu zhong liu xing zhi
qi, meaning “the five kinds of
qi prevailing at different times.”

in summer, metal qi (west) in
autumn, water qi (north) in winter,
and wood qi (east) in spring.

Part 2: The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui
The Productive Cycle
The productive cycle, shown in the following figure, is one of balance and creation. Each
phase produces, or enhances, the succeeding phase. This progressively producing rela-
tionship of the five phases is known as the “mother-son” relationship. Each phase is the
“son” of the phase that produces it, and the “mother” of the one it produces.
66
In humans, the five phases correspond to our vital organs, senses, body characteristics,
and emotions. For example, fire is associated with the heart/small intestines and joy;
earth with the spleen/stomach and intense concentration; metal with the lungs/large
intestines and grief; water with the kidney/urinary/bladder and fear; wood with the
liver/gallbladder and anger. Considering these relationships, it’s not surprising that an
overly sad person taxes his lungs to cry and sigh. That intense fear may cause a release
of the bladder. That excessive joy could produce heart ailments. Recently, a friend of
ours was playing the slot machines. She won the $5,000 jackpot, but her jubilation
triggered a heart attack. Practitioners of acupuncture, acupressure, and herbs use the
five phases concept to correct imbalances of qi in our bodies.

accumulation of wood to produce ash.
Metal produces water. Out of
metal’s contracting force, water
qi condenses and liquefies.
Water produces wood. Water’s
flow nourishes and stimulates
the growth of wood.
Wood produces fire. Wood’s
expansion and fullness, and
eventual drying decay, give
life to fire.
 
Earth produces metal.
Earth qi compacts, giving
birth to the contractive,
inward pulling qi of metal.

Chapter 6: The Principle of the Five Phases
As you can see, each phase follows a natural progression, the sequence of change creating
harmony and balance. On paper, this seems logical. It makes sense. Yet, we react much
differently when confronted with, say, an out-of-control brush fire threatening to con-
sume our home. We must understand that actually, things are in control. Rainfall pro-
duces lush greenery that dries, causing raging fires. End of story. Think about this next
time you’re tempted to buy that mountain retreat or beachfront cottage!
The Controlling Cycle
The controlling cycle, shown in the following figure, is just that. Each phase controls its
counterpart. It’s a cycle of imbalance. The controlling cycle sets into motion weakened
and depleted qi, which stagnates the environment and causes illness and other unwanted
effects in us.
67
Fire melts metal.
Metal pierces wood.
Wood burdens earth.
Earth blocks water.
Water diminishes fire.
The Controlling Cycle
In the controlling cycle, the phases control
or dominate each other. Harmony and
order give way to discord and chaos.
The Weakening Cycle
The weakening cycle, shown in the following fig-
ure, reduces the power of the controlling phase
and restores the sequential balance (the produc-
tive cycle) of the phases in question. In feng shui,
The controlling cycle describes
a battle between confronting
qi. On the positive side, qi’s
counterpart keeps it under con-
trol, in check. On the negative
side, qi’s counterpart suggests
unceasing conflict.

Part 2: The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui
more often than not, the weakening cycle is used to remedy negative, or controlling, qi.
The weakening cycle combines the productive and controlling cycles and is represented
by the dotted lines revolving in a counterclockwise motion.
But, you may ask, how does a reductive phase remedy
controlling qi? Good question. Let’s look at a few
examples. If water controls fire, how would you pro-
pose to lessen water’s power? Would you add earth,
metal, or wood? If you answered earth, guess again.
Earth would certainly dominate (controlling cycle)
water’s power, but it will also reduce (reductive cycle)
fire. Earth would then become too dominant over
water and fire. If you believe metal will reduce water’s
control, this, too, is an incorrect assumption. Metal produces (productive cycle) water.
You would be adding to water’s power. The correct answer is wood. Wood both absorbs
(reductive cycle) water’s power and fuels (productive cycle) the weakened fire. By adding
wood, the natural sequence of qi is restored.
68
Many have mistakenly called
the controlling cycle “the
destruction cycle.” Remember,
energy cannot be destroyed, it
can only change form.
Master Class
Wood absorbs water.
Fire burns wood.
Earth reduces fire.
Water corrodes metal.
Metal moves earth.
The Weakening Cycle
Here’s another example. In this situation, let’s make earth the controlling agent over
water. How would you propose lessening earth’s power? Would you add wood or metal? If
you answered wood, guess again. Wood diminishes earth and reduces water. It would
dominate over two weakened agents—earth and water. If you answered metal, you’re get-
ting it! Metal both reduces earth and produces water. For example, if a mudslide dams the
little creek in your backyard, you’d use a shovel (metal) to clear the earth, allowing the

Chapter 6: The Principle of the Five Phases
water to flow. Right? If this mudslide
blocked a river, you’d use a bulldozer (a
really big piece of metal). Get the idea?
The following table shows the relationship
between any two phases and their corre-
sponding remedy. If the relationship is pro-
ductive, a remedy is not needed (there are exceptions to this rule, which you’ll find out
about in Chapter 17, “The Flying Stars, Part 5”). If one phase controls another phase, the
reductive phase is used to revert the cycle to a productive one.
Remember, the weakening cycle creates balance, restoring the productive sequence of qi
without creating any side effects. Metal’s contractive qi force and wood’s expansive qi are
balanced with water’s downward pull. Fire’s rising qi and metal’s contractive qi are bal-
anced with earth’s compacting force. And so forth.

Part 2: The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui
When correcting a controlling interaction you can use
either the weakening phase itself or its corresponding
color(s). Although using the actual phase is preferred,
sometimes this isn’t always possible. For example, leav-
ing a candle burning or a fire blazing in the fireplace is
negligent if left unattended. When using color, it’s
important that items such as walls, upholstery, carpets,
bedspreads, and drapes be of the same color for maximum
benefit to your well-being. Following are suggested
remedies for each of the five phases.
Fire remedies a wood-earth domination. Fire remedies include …
◆A burning candle or working fireplace.
◆Lamps with red shades or red light bulbs burning 24 hours.
◆The colors red, purple, dark orange, and pink.
Earth remedies a fire-metal domination. Earth reme-
dies include …
◆Rocks.
◆Ceramic, clay, or cement figurines, sculptures,
table bases, or lamps.
◆The colors brown and yellow.
Metal remedies an earth-water domination. Metal
remedies include …
◆Brass, steel, silver, gold, copper, or bronze fig-
urines, picture frames, bed frames, planters, exer-
cise equipment, pendulum clocks, filing cabinets,
lamps, or fixtures.
◆The colors white, gold, and silver.
◆The metallic sound of wind chimes, a chiming
clock, or piano playing.
Water remedies a metal-wood domination. Water remedies include …
◆Aquariums*, table fountains**, a container of clean moving water, or humidifiers.
◆The colors black and blue.
A water bed is not a water remedy because the water is concealed.
70
The vibration of the remedy’s qi
must be strong enough to bal-
ance the controlling agent.
Therefore, the size of the rem-
edy must be proportional to the
size of the room. You must feel its
essence.
Master Class
You cannot mix phase
elements. In other words, if the
water phase is needed in a par-
ticular area, make sure other
phase elements don’t conflict with
the remedy. In this case, the
room mustn’t be a red tone (fire).
Avoid placing plants (wood)
here. An abundance of earthen-
ware may also upset the bal-
ance. While metal produces
water, make sure metal objects
don’t overwhelm water’s essence.
Feng Alert

Chapter 6: The Principle of the Five Phases
Wood remedies a water-fire domination. Wood remedies include …
◆A living plant or tree.
◆The color green.
Dead wood such as hardwood floors and furniture cannot be used as a remedy.
* Although fish are aesthetically pleasing, they aren’t necessary.
** The best types of fountains are made of glass, plastic, or metal. Those made from earth elements will elim-
inate water’s power. Why? Because earth dominates water. Water must be clean and exposed.
The Five Phases of Buildings
Building shapes correspond to the five phases, too. Triangular buildings are associated
with fire qi. Many churches conform to this shape. So does your local International House
of Pancakes! Square and rectangular buildings represent earth qi. Most of our homes are
square, allowing qi to meander and spiral from room to room. Round or domed-shaped
buildings represent metal qi. Sports arenas, coliseums, and observatories conform to this
shape. New York’s Guggenheim Museum is an excellent example. Round on the outside,
its inner art galleries are spirally arrayed, inviting onlookers to be swallowed along a cir-
cular path. Wavy shapes correspond to water qi. Structures with variegated roof/ceiling
lines conform to this shape. Finally, tall buildings, like skyscrapers, correspond to wood
qi’s growth and expansion.
Is one shape better than the other? Do certain shapes promote a healthy well-being while
others inspire illness and misfortune? These questions and more will be addressed in
Chapter 9, “Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings.”
71
Mirrors have never been used as a remedy in classical feng shui. The belief that mirrors
can ward off evil omens, absorb, deflect, or stimulate qi’s movement is wishful thinking.
Mirrors only reflect light hitting its glass surface. So, where does the misconception
about mirrors come from? The precursor to the modern loupan compass was called a
shi pan. Made of a round “heaven” disc that swivels on a square “earth” base plate,
the shi pan was inscribed with various images of the cosmos, including an image of the
Big Dipper (Beidou). Interestingly, the inscribed Dipper is a mirror opposite from its true
configuration in the heavens. This is because the shi pan “mirrors” the perfect and ideal
world. In the Han dynasty (206 B.C.E.– 220 C.E.), mirrors were made of polished
bronze, also illustrating the model world. Both the bronze mirrors and shi pan were con-
sidered magical because they reflected an absolute balance between heaven and
earth. They were even buried in tombs to help the deceased into the next world.

The Principle of the 
Eight Trigrams
In This Chapter
◆What are the eight trigrams?
◆The symbols of the eight trigrams
◆The meaning of the eight trigrams
◆The Before Heaven and After Heaven sequence of trigrams
The eight trigrams are the fundamental building blocks that form the 64
hexagrams of the Yijing (The Book of Changes). Each trigram expresses patterns
of movement and change. Each has been used extensively in the fields of phi-
losophy, astrology, Chinese traditional medicine, numerology, the martial arts,
mathematics, and, of course, feng shui.
Understanding the eight trigrams will give you greater insight into the pat-
terns of change inherent in nature and in you.
Motion over Matter—Qi’s Pattern of Movement
As you learned in Chapter 4, “Qi Wiz! It’s Life’s Force!” feng shui is wrapped
around the concept of qi—the mysterious underlying force whose existence
Chapter

Part 2: The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui
has yet to be proven scientifically. To the Chinese, whether or not this age-old notion is
bolstered by scientific data is irrelevant. In the East, intuitive wisdom has always reigned
over rational knowledge. Qi is a fact of life. They know it’s here, there, and everywhere.
So, how can you study that which cannot be seen?
Simply, the ancient Chinese followed how qi navigates through the cycles of yin and yang.
Studying its patterns of movement, transformation, and evolution through nature’s ele-
ments was considered far more important than studying the isolated element itself. In
fact, the whole of nature was seen as a network of interconnected and interdependent
events. These events, phases, or patterns were correlated into a symmetrical model repre-
senting all possible natural and human situations. This model is called the principle of the
eight trigrams.
Interestingly, Fritjof Capra, in his thought-provoking book, The Tao of Physics (Shambhala,
1991), points out that this Eastern concept bears a striking resemblance to German physi-
cist Werner Heisenberg’s (1901–76) S-Matrix theory. In the theory developed in 1943,
Heisenberg described the realm of hadrons (a class of subatomic particles) as a network of
inseparable reactions. Reactions connect particles to other reactions. The particle is sec-
ondary to its chain of movement and transformation. Like the principle of the eight tri-
grams, Heisenberg’s S-Matrix theory explains all
possible reactions relating to hadrons.
In feng shui, the movement, change, and interactions
of qi, together with the elements of time and space,
determine your state of being. Understanding the eight
trigrams and their associations will help you to enhance
good qi and correct bad qi.
Eight Is Enough
Out of the dynamic interplay of yin and yang, a family of eight trigrams is born. Take a
look at the following illustration. As indicated, yang (male) is represented by a solid line,
and yin (female) by a broken line. Individually, yang and yin each produce two offspring.
How so? Upon closer examination of respective offspring, you’ll notice that the bottom
line corresponds to the “parent” yang or yin line in question. The addition of the top
yang or yin line results in the production of four unique pairs or bigrams (sixiang, in
Chinese). Next, each of the four bigrams produces two trigrams each, the bottom two
lines identical to the parent pair. Again only the addition of the top yang or yin line dis-
tinguishes the trigram from its “sibling.”
76
The eight trigrams are
symbols representing transitional
phases of all possible natural
and human situations.

Chapter 7: The Principle of the Eight Trigrams
Together, the eight trigrams, or what is known
as the bagua, represent the maximum number of
yang or yin combinations in sets of three. If you
continue multiplying the eight trigrams by
themselves, you’ll end up with the 64 hexa-
grams of the Yijing, but we won’t concern our-
selves with that here. 
How do you interpret the trigram symbols? What
do they mean? And what do they have to do with
feng shui? You’ll soon find out!
Meet the Bagua Family
As you have just learned, the eight fundamental trigrams (and hexagrams) are built from
the bottom line up. The bottom line represents earth. The middle line represents
humankind, and the top line, heaven. The line that is different determines the trigram’s
gender (a fuller explanation of this is coming up).
Aside from their gender identity, the trigrams are associated with a host of natural and
human phenomena: the seasons, the time of day, magnetic directions, the five phases and
their corresponding colors, animals, human personality types (merchants, teachers,
thieves, and so on), body parts, related illnesses, and numbers. The trigrams are even
given a name appropriate to their qi energy (“the arousing,” “the gentle,” “the clinging”).
Although each association is significant, we’ve listed only those attributes that will be the
most useful to your study and practice of feng shui.

These are the eight members of the bagua, or trigram, family. Although the symbols may
seem abstract and their configurations daunting, don’t worry. In time you’ll come to rec-
ognize each trigram and its corresponding associations. It’s similar to learning to under-
stand road signs. After a while, the abstract symbols for Yield, No Entry, and No Passing
become absorbed into your subconscious realm of knowns. So will the trigrams, if you
give them a chance.

Part 2: The Fundamental Principles of Feng Shui
The Cyclic Pattern of the Bagua
Although the eight trigrams can be arranged in many different ways, there are really only
two configurations that make sense. The first arrangement, shown in the following illus-
tration, is called the Before Heaven sequence. “Before Heaven” is an interpretive trans-
lation of the Chinese term Xian Tian, which means “prior to the appearance of the
phenomenal world.” The Before Heaven sequence denotes perfect balance and harmony.
80
The Before Heaven sequence
of the eight trigrams.
All eight qi forces are balanced by their counterparts: Heaven is balanced by earth, water
by fire. Or, father is balanced by mother, and middle son by middle daughter. In essence,
this arrangement represents the ideal world, the underlying reality. The problem with the
Before Heaven sequence is that it’s motionless, a study of still life. It doesn’t move, trans-
form, or interact. Let’s move on.
The second arrangement, shown in the following illustration, is called the After Heaven
sequence. Translated from the Chinese term Hou Tian, it means “after the appearance of
the phenomenal world.” The After Heaven sequence follows the cyclic changes of yin and
yang. Each trigram evolves in a natural sequence of events in a lifelike world. In feng shui,
we use the After Heaven sequence to analyze how the movement of qi’s forces affects you.

Chapter 7: The Principle of the Eight Trigrams
Beginning with the Zhen trigram to the east and moving in a clockwise motion, spring
arrives with a clap of thunder. Next, the Xun trigram’s gentle winds nourish the growth
and development of summer’s expansion. Li follows. The intensity of Li’s brightness gives
rise to early autumn’s soft light. In human con-
sciousness, Li is a time of love and curiosity.
You are the middle daughter exploring new
concepts.
Next comes Kun, early autumn. You are maturing
and receptive to new ideas. But it is in Dui that
you turn inward, harvesting what you’ve learned.
It’s a time of reflection and self-assessment. With
Qian’s emergence comes the beginning of winter.

tion. You are still and quiet as midnight. Your

motion, transformation, and inter-

inward journey is now completed. In Gen, clouds form over winter’s repose and thunder
heralds a new cycle of growth and development.
As shown in the next illustration, the eight trigram circle is squared off to form a grid 
of eight place values (with the center representing earth). This allows the principle of 
the eight trigrams (along with the yin and yang and five phase theories) to correlate to the

Flying Stars, Part 1.”

The bagua grid.
Patterns of Numbers
The combination of solid and broken lines forming the trigrams and hexagrams corre-
sponds to the binary system of mathematics—the same system used today in computer
programming. Every function your computer performs—calculations, graphics, and word
processing—uses binary numeration. The system uses 01 for the number 1 and 10 for the
number 2. The succeeding numbers compute as shown in the following table.

In the same way, if you let yang (solid line) represent the number one, and yin (broken
line) represent zero, you can see that the combinations follow the rules of binary numera-
tion. For example, reading the trigrams from the bottom line up, trigram 
, or 001, rep-
resents binary number 1.
Trigram 
, or 010, represents binary number 2.
Trigram 
, or 011, represents binary number 3, and so forth.
Get the idea? Flip back a couple of pages to the illustration of the bagua family tree.
We’ve included the binary code for all eight trigrams.
How this mathematical interpretation of the trigrams and hexagrams was discovered is 
an interesting story. It began with German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried
Wilhelm von Leibnitz (1646–1716), who believed the mathematical system proved God’s
creation of the world: Everything was created by God (1) from nothing (0). 
As the story goes, Leibnitz was corresponding with a Jesuit missionary in China, Father
Joachim Bouvet, at the time. In 1701, hoping to persuade the Chinese to accept the
Christian doctrine with his mystical calculations, Leibnitz sent Bouvet a copy of his pub-
lished work on binary numeration. Bouvet recognized a connection between the binary
system and the Yijing’s symbols and sent him a circular arrangement of the hexagrams
composed by Song dynasty philosopher Shao Yong. Remarkably, Yong’s arrangement was
a mirror image of the base-two system from 0 to 63.
Can the fact that the East and West independ-
ently invented binary mathematics serve as an
example for our ability to subconsciously tap
into the Sea of Consciousness? Well, in this
case, no. As we mentioned in Chapter 3, “The
Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng
Shui,” the original Yijing, the Zhouyi, was strictly a
system of numerological divination in which
sequences of odd and even numbers had sig-
nificance. A Chinese scholar named Zhang
Zhenglang made this discovery in the 1970s, the-
orizing that over time the odd numbers became
the solid yang lines and the even numbers, the
83
“The nature of the Ultimate
Supreme [Taiji] is total balance.
When motion is initiated, it gen-
erates spirituality. Spirituality gen-
erates numbers. Numbers
generate emblems. Emblems 
generate vision. Vision generates
transformation, everything return-
ing to spirituality.”
—Cosmological philosopher
Shao Yong (1011–77 C.E.)

broken yin lines as we know them. Moreover, at the time the Yijing was assembled at the
end of the second millennium B.C.E. by King Wen and the Duke of Zhou, the concept of
zero was not yet known. (For a detailed account of Leibnitz, binary numeration, and the
Yijing, see Chapter 10 of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to the I Ching.)
So the real question is, what is the meaning of the patterns of numbers underlying the tri-
grams and hexagrams? Although we may never learn their meaning, clearly the ancient
Chinese recognized correlative mathematical patterns made manifest in nature and human
nature/events. They recorded how these macrocosmic events affected our microcosmic
beings. You’ll study one such number-based system in Part 5, “Feng Shui Mechanics
201.” Until then, you must first learn how your home’s external and internal environ-
ments play a significant role in how you think, feel, and relate.

ancestors as configurations of celestial bodies. For the most part, these star-patterned
deities were represented in animal form. Called totems, the animals were worshipped in
exchange for protection. Originating from the Algonquin tribe of North America, the
word “totem” describes a clan’s emblem—an animal or natural object with which a group
feels a special affection or attachment.
Why the affinity with a particular animal? This is a
mystery. Although we’ll probably never know why a
tribe chose a particular animal as its emblem, the geo-
graphic region of the culture in question may provide
important clues. Also, it’s reasonable to assume the 
animal embodied positive attributes (like courage,
strength, or loyalty) with which the tribe wished to
associate itself. But, before we get into these aspects,
let’s first define the totems worshipped by the ancient
Chinese. Then we can learn how these totems relate to
the art and science of feng shui.
Circus of the Stars
In China, four celestial deities revered by ancient tribes combined to help form the cul-
ture we know today. What would come to be known as the Four Celestial Palaces—the
crimson bird, azure dragon, mysterious black turtle, and white tiger—are actually macro-
constellations, or an enormous stellar division, com-
posed of seven independent constellations each.
Together, the 4 macroconstellations make up the 28
constellations of the Chinese zodiac. 
Signaling the arrival of the solstices and equinoxes,
each macroconstellation represents a quarter of the
night sky, each visible in its entirety only in the season
with which it’s associated (you’ll learn more about this
later). As an aside, it’s important to understand the
Chinese use the celestial equator to track stellar posi-
tions. In China’s mountainous regions, it makes more

sense to base observations on the times when
the heavenly bodies come into view overhead.
In the Western world, emphasis is placed on
the rising and setting of celestial bodies on the
terrestrial horizon. Called the ecliptic system, it
originated in subtropic regions where the land is
flat and the view unobstructed.
Read All About It: Heaven Falls to Earth!
You may be wondering how ancient cosmology
relates to feng shui, how celestial deities are asso-
ciated with harnessing positive qi. Unfortunately,
like many ancient traditions, the answers are
swathed in myth. Sometime between the 6000
B.C.E. Neolithic tomb (described in Chapter 3,
“The Great Wall of Knowledge and the Rise of Feng Shui”) and the writing of the 4th
century C.E. Book of Burial, the bird, dragon, turtle, and tiger deities came down to earth
to represent four unique types of landforms associated with Form School feng shui—the
practice of locating the most auspicious sites on which to construct a building or bury the
dead.
As the story goes, the circular (or domed) heaven and square (or flat) earth were once per-
fectly balanced, eight majestic mountains (corresponding to each of the eight directions)
separating the two realms. However, this ideal and perfect world came to an end when 
the water demon Gong Gong battled the fire god Zhu Rong. During the battle, Mount
Buzhou, the northwest “pillar,” collapsed. As a consequence, heaven came crashing down,
causing the earth plane to rise in the southeast and fall in the northwest. Somehow, the
four macroconstellations transformed into terrestrial shapes, each associated with one of
the four cardinal directions: the crimson bird to the south, the white tiger to the west, the
black turtle to the north, and the azure dragon to the east.
Although an exciting tale, we all know this primeval battle didn’t really occur. How the
star-patterned deities entered the earth plane is anyone’s guess. Nevertheless, their shape
and proximity to one another help to describe the disposition of qi, ultimately providing
the foundation of Form School (Xingfa) feng shui. It was the task of the master to find the
place, nestled between the creatures that represented heaven on earth. He did this using a
shipan (described in Chapter 6, “The Principle of the Five Phases”). Over time, this di-
vine instrument was replaced by the luopan, the compass used by feng shui masters today.
89
The celestial equator is
the circular path the constellations
traverse perpendicular to an
imaginary line joining the celes-
tial north pole to the earth’s
North Pole. The ancient Chinese
called the celestial equator the
Red Path. Westerners developed
an ecliptic system. It traces the
path of the sun through the sky.
The ancient Chinese called this
system the Yellow Path.

In Search of the Dragon’s Lair
The earliest textual documentation underlying the theories of Form School feng shui sur-
face in the fifth century B.C.E. in Guanzi, purportedly written by Guan Zhong, the prime
minister of the state of Qi. However, a fully developed theory discussing the relationship
of the terrestrial plane and qi isn’t seen for another six centuries. As we already men-
tioned, the fourth century C.E. Book of Burial (Zhangshu) was the bible of landforms, the
text describing in detail how to locate the dragon’s lair
(long xue)—the place where qi converges. Many schol-
ars believe Guo Pu’s (276–324 C.E.) Book of Burial clari-
fies the Classic of Burial, a text purportedly dating to the
Han dynasty. It states: “Qi flows according to the shape
of the earth. With qi’s nourishment, all living things
come into existence. Qi flows within the ground. Its
motion follows the shape of the terrain, accumulating
where the terrain stops.”
Locating the cave of the lair, a metaphor for the place
where sheng qi pools, is what Form School feng shui is
about. When the deceased are buried in this spot, the
yin (dead) bones are activated by or charged with yang
(living) qi. When a home is built on this auspicious site,
the occupants are blessed with good health and wealth.
Climb Every Mountain
Besides being associated with a direction, the bird, dragon, turtle, and tiger landforms
correspond to a season, a five phase color, and a yin and yang polarity, as shown in the
following illustration.
Beginning with the crimson bird and traveling clockwise, the bird represents the south,
summer, the color red, and yang qi. Since birds are more abundant in warmer climates, it
makes sense why the bird deity was placed in the southern sky. Terrestrially, the bird’s fea-
tures must be lower than the others. The bird doesn’t
have to be a landform; it can also represent a body of
water.
The white tiger represents the west, autumn, the color
white, and yin qi. The tiger is indigenous and plentiful
the farther west toward India you travel. Terrestrially,
the tiger’s peak is traditionally longer and lower than its
eastern counterpart, the dragon.
90
The dragon’s lair (long
xue) is the common point of inter-
section between the southern
landform of the crimson bird, the
eastern landform of the azure
dragon, the northern black turtle,
and the western white tiger. The
dragon’s lair is considered the
most auspicious site on which to
build a home or to bury the
dead.

Chapter 8: Turtles, Tigers, and Dragons, Oh My: Evaluating Your Environment
The black turtle represents the north, winter, the
color black, and yin qi. Not to be confused with
the amphibious tortoise, the land creature
boasts the highest terrestrial landform feature.
Why a turtle? Why the north? Well, all we know
is that turtle shell divination was a northern tradi-
tion. In fact, divination using the plastrons or bot-
tom shells of turtles (plastomancy) led to a type of
divination called sortilege, where a person drew
lots (stone, sticks, or straws, for example) to deter-
mine his or her fate. The ancient Chinese used
stalks from the yarrow plant, a method directly
tied to the development of the Yijing, considered
the oldest system of divination still in use today. 
Finally, the azure dragon represents the east, spring, the color green, and yang qi. Tradi-
tionally, the dragon’s terrestrial features are higher than the western tiger. Meteoro-
logically, the azure dragon is equivalent to the Greco-Roman constellation Scorpious.
Together, the crimson bird, white tiger, black turtle, and azure dragon form the dragon’s
lair. Regardless of their stature, each component plays a vital role in nourishing the land
of the living and the realm of the dead. Let’s find out what role each plays.
91
The lowest of the land-
forms, the southern crimson bird
can also represent a body of
water. This is balanced by the
highest northern landform, the
black turtle. To the east, the high
azure dragon is balanced by the
long and low white tiger of the
west.

Part 3: Understanding Your Environment
Have a Seat
Imagine the lair as an armchair. The tiger and dragon represent the arms, the turtle is the
back, and the bird, the foot stool. The fortunate site for a grave, building, or settlement
rests in the middle, the seat of the chair. Now, imagine sitting in the chair. How would
you feel if the left (azure dragon) or right (white tiger) arm was missing? Would you feel
uncomfortable? Exposed? Unbalanced, perhaps? In feng shui, the dragon and the tiger
protect the lair just as the arms of the chair protect your body.
The black turtle provides support and protection. In China, the turtle blocked bitter
Arctic winds and helped to battle against barbaric attacks. Continuing with our chair anal-
ogy, don’t you feel safer and more secure with your back supported? Of course you do!
This idea also gives rise to the phrase “Watch your back.”
92
Traditionally, the Chinese believe the left is more important than the right. For this rea-
son, the highest-ranking prime minister always appeared on the left side of the
emperor. In part, this has to do with how our brain functions. For people who are
right-handed, the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body. The ancient
Chinese understood this, honoring the brain’s importance by ranking its officials
accordingly. 
Master Class
What about the crimson bird? While not offering protection, this low-lying landform or
body of water buffers you from incoming forces. Also, this area provides an unobstructed
view of the site in question.
Although traditionally, the four terrestrial creatures correspond to one of the four direc-
tions, we mustn’t be so strict when we judge our home’s location. Regardless of magnetic
orientation, just know it’s most favorable to have the landforms of the turtle supporting
your back, the dragon on your left, the white tiger on your right, and the crimson bird in
front.
City Slickers
Let’s say you live on flat terrain with no dragon, turtle, or tiger landform in sight. Does
this mean your home brings you misfortune? Absolutely not! Symbolically, the four ter-
restrial creatures can represent buildings. For example, most of us have neighboring 

Chapter 8: Turtles, Tigers, and Dragons, Oh My: Evaluating Your Environment
structures on the left and right sides of our
home. Looking outside from within our
dwelling, these structures represent the
dragon (left side) and tiger (right side). To
determine which side bears the greatest
strength you must consider …
◆The size of the buildings: the bigger and
more imposing, the stronger.
◆The proximity of each to your home: the
closer, the more powerful.
◆The density on each side: the side with a
greater number of buildings has more influence.
If the neighboring buildings on the left side are more prominent than on the right side,
your home favors the male occupants. This is because the left side, the dragon side, corre-
sponds to yang (male) qi. If the neighboring buildings on the right side are more promi-
nent, your home favors the yin female occupants.
The back side of your home can also be supported by a building. While offering security
and protection, the structure in question must not overwhelm your home. Also, it must
not block sunlight.
Rolling on the River; Ease on Down the Road
In feng shui, river courses and roadways are evaluated in the same way. A meandering
river is similar to a winding road. A sharp current is like heavy rushing traffic. Depending
on their patterns, rivers and roads can bring you benevolent sheng qi, inspiring good for-
tune, or malicious sha qi, causing misfortune and illness.
So, if you’re in the market to buy a new home
or would just like to assess your current situa-
tion, what we offer here should be considered.
In some measure, our health and livelihood
depend on the very paths we take for granted.
Consider the following illustrations. Before read-
ing our analysis, try to form your own conclusion.
Staying oblivious to all other factors, consider
only how the road’s contour makes you feel.
93
Suitably placed and appro-
priately sized trees, hedges,
bushes, or even fences are a
valid substitute for landforms
and buildings. If your home
backs onto a park, for example,
you could plant a grove of trees
or a hedge to protect your back
side. A fence will also do.

94
In feng shui, river courses
and roadways are evaluated
the same way.
Let’s consider each illustration separately:
1. A straight road. Generally, most homes are positioned along this type of road pat-
tern. Is this a bad thing? Only if the road is a main thoroughfare, where you’re sub-
jected to extra noise, dirt, and other things possibly causing fatigue and illness. Is it
more peaceful listening to sirens or song birds? In the same vein, if you live along-
side an aqueduct or river rapids, you may feel out of control, as if you’re being buf-
feted downstream. Now, if the straight road in question is not frequented by traffic,
it resembles a lazy stream—quiet, peaceful, balanced.
2. A dead-end street. Here, this dwelling is a recipient of poison arrow qi rushing up
the street into the occupant’s front door. Most inauspicious, indeed. It’s also unfa-
vorable to live in an apartment or work in an office at the end of a long hall.
3. A T-junction. Once again, poison arrow qi intrudes. Like a runaway locomotive, it
will stop only on impact, enveloping your home in its destructive forces.
4. A corner lot. You may feel unbalanced living on a corner lot. This is because one
side of your dwelling’s protection is separated by the street. Also, traffic, noise, and
glaring headlights are a consideration. 

Chapter 8: Turtles, Tigers, and Dragons, Oh My: Evaluating Your Environment
5. A Y-junction. Similar to a dead-end
and T-junction pattern, a home resid-
ing in a Y-junction is subjected to two
torrents of unfavorable qi. Further,
this configuration is cause for acci-
dents due to cars careening off the
path into your home.
6. A cul-de-sac. Unlike the dead-end street
depicted in illustration 2, a house situated on
a cul-de-sac containing an island is fortu-
nate. Why? If you imagine the street as a
water course, the island (in this situation) is
the crimson bird—the buffer dispersing sha
qi’s ill effects. What about a cul-de-sac that
doesn’t have a protective island? This, too, is
favorable because qi can flow, moving in a
circular motion, dispersing its benevolent
energy.
7. A U-shape. It stands to reason you may
feel suffocated living in a house positioned
inside a noose! Although atypical to city
streetscape, avoid purchasing a country or
mountain home where this type of pattern is
more common.
8. A sharp bend. Maneuvering a car around
sharp bends is tricky business. The screech
of brakes and the glare of headlights add
extra anxiety. Would you want to live on
such a danger-prone street?
9. A meandering path. Cradled inside an open U-junction, you are protected from
the threat of accidents, glaring lights, and poison arrow qi. A house situated here is
considered lucky—the benevolent, winding qi bringing prosperity, good health, and
promotion.
Some final points: Although not illustrated here, living on the same level or below a free-
way is inauspicious. So is living between parallel roads. So, what then are the most favor-
able locations? Simply, a meandering path (9), followed by a cul-de-sac (6), and a straight
road (1) not frequented by traffic. Remember, when evaluating your situation, roadways
and water courses are equivalent.
95
If you live along a straight
roadway, the most auspicious
house is in the middle sup-
ported by the tiger and
dragon. In feng shui, the cor-
ner dwelling (or the one at the
end of the lane) is considered
unfavorable because the qi has
dispersed. Also the house’s sup-
port is unbalanced with the street
coming between the protection of
the tiger/dragon.
Master Class
If you live at a T- or Y-
junction, can anything be done
to protect you from the affects of
poison arrow qi? Install a high
fence or plant a wall of shrub-
bery to block qi’s destructive
path. However, it’s best to avoid
choosing locations requiring such
action.

Church Bells and Power Poles
There is a host of man-made factors that can influence your health and livelihood. While
some are obvious hazards, others are less so. Take living next to a school. Would you
think its proximity poses a health risk? Aside from the school bus exhaust fumes, the area
is charged with the high energy of youth. Just being in your own children’s presence can
wear you out. Now, multiply this by say, a thousand. Over time, the voltage of kid qi may
cause insomnia, anxiety, and muscle tension.
Conversely, how about living next to a hospital, funeral parlor, or even a place of worship?
Here, you’re enveloped with trauma, depression, sorrow, illness, and death. But wait,
aren’t churches, synagogues, and the like peaceful places? They can be. However, you’re
still subjected to the maladies of others. Here are more sites you should avoid living in
close proximity to the following:
◆Garbage dump
◆Landfill
◆Cemetery
◆Police station
◆Fire station
◆Airport
◆Railroad
◆Factory
◆Military camp
◆High-tension power lines
If you live next to one of these places, can a five phase remedy offer protection? Unfortu-
nately, no. The presence is simply too overwhelming. If you’re a soldier stationed in a
military camp or a minister living in the parsonage next to the church, take extra precau-
tions to safeguard your health. A proper diet and exercise will help to defend against 
the inherently inauspicious site you must live in. However, it’s best to try to avoid it 
altogether.
Land Sakes Alive!
There’s much to consider when choosing or evaluating a house. You’ve already learned
you can create a veritable heaven on earth just by identifying and situating yourself in an
area that protects your back and left and right sides. Even if you don’t live in a mountain-
ous region, you can still find security and protection among neighboring structures. 
98

Chapter 9: Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings
Also, don’t forget the fourth component—river and/or road patterns (and foothills, if
applicable). Do the river courses and roadways surrounding your house bring sheng qi,
promoting good health, wealth, and happiness? Or is your house the object of sha qi,
bringing potential money loss, illness, and failed relationships?
Let’s examine the land your house is situated on. Later, we’ll look at other favorable and
unfavorable factors that influence your state of being.
Over Hill, Over Dale
Where’s the best place to live? On top of a hill? On a steep incline? How about on sloping
land or flat terrain? Look at the following illustration. What do you believe to be the
most favorable terrain?
99
The geophysical plane your
house sits on can affect your
livelihood.
1. A hilltop. While offering a spectacular view, this is not an auspicious site. Left
unprotected, you’re subjected not only to nature’s forces but also to psychological
vulnerability. People who live on hilltops are known to feel insecure and exposed. 

Part 3: Understanding Your Environment
Often, these individuals are prone to insomnia and
nervousness. Imagine yourself camping out on a
hilltop. It’s just you and your sleeping bag. You
have an unobstructed view of the stars. After a
while, you doze off. But your sleep is not restful.
On guard, you summon up the fight or flight re-
action understood by primitive man. While the
inhabitants of Masada and Machu Picchu may
have been skilled at sleeping with one eye open,
ultimately, they did not withstand the test of time.
Again, choose a secure haven over a scenic view.
2. A steep incline. A mountain view in back, a
panoramic view in front. Sound ideal? Imagine
standing on a vertical incline. Naturally, you tend
to lean back and widen your stance—anything to
offer stability to prevent you from toppling over.
Psychological effects aside, how about the threat
of landslides? In feng shui, those who live on a
steep incline are unable to retain wealth. Like a
house on top of a hill, a house on a steep incline
does not allow sheng qi to accumulate and settle.
It’s carried downhill. So is your hard-earned
money.
3. A sloping hill. Classical feng shui doctrines tell us
that living on a gently sloping hill is ideal. This is
because the soil on this terrain is fertile and rich.
Here, your house is less likely to flood. Depending
on the grade of the slope, the upward incline can
represent the black turtle, protecting and support-
ing your back.
4. Flat terrain. Although the ancient Chinese classics tell us flat, low-lying areas are
best avoided (because of the threat of flooding and poor soil quality), these texts
spoke to an agricultural society. Today, most urban dwellers live on flat terrain.
Offering a solid foundation and security, this type of site is favorable.
Armed with this information, you’ll think twice before purchasing your dream house on a
hilltop or steep incline. As mama says, “It’s better to be safe than sorry!”
100
According to the Pro-
fessional Hypnotism Manual by
John G. Kappas, the fight or flight
instinct is a primitive and involun-
tary reaction triggered during
moments of danger or anxiety. As
humankind (and animals) evolved,
some developed greater strength
and aggressiveness (fight), while
others developed agility, speed,
and a sensitivity to the senses of
smell, sight, and hearing (flight).
Those who remained passive
eventually became extinct.

While generally it’s

Lots of Plots
Now that you understand what kind of terrain is considered favorable, let’s see how the
shape of your lot affects your well-being. Much of what we have presented so far relies on
plain old common sense, a factor we’re more accustomed to dealing with than compli-
cated environmental concerns. We’ve discussed where you should seek a lot, now let’s talk
about the individual lot itself. Disregarding all other external details, look at the following
illustrations. Which lots do you think are most favorable?
101
The shape of your lot can
affect your well-being.
1. Square lot. In feng shui, a square shape, be it a lot, a room, or a table, denotes sta-
bility and balance. Qi is able to flow freely, unobstructed. Ideally, your house should
be situated in the center of a lot, allowing qi to circulate around the structure and
through its windows and doors, nourishing the occupants.
2. Rectangular lot. In this example, the dwelling is positioned at the front of the lot.
Qi flows in and accumulates in the back, your wealth and health safeguarded. It’s
similar to a wealthy individual having “deep pockets.” Investors have backers—
ensuring support behind them.
3. Deep front yard, shallow backyard. In feng shui, if the space behind your house is
significantly less than the space in front, you will have difficulty retaining money.
4. Trapezoid lot. Here, sheng qi inspiring good health and monetary gain must
squeeze in. Like a bottleneck, the object in question must maneuver through the
tight opening in order to accumulate in back. Because qi will have difficulty enter-
ing, this shape is not considered favorable.

Part 3: Understanding Your Environment
5. Inverted trapezoid lot. In this example, qi has no trouble entering, but a difficult
time staying. Imagine a cone-shaped paper cup. Flatten the bottom so that it’s able
to stand on its end, then fill it with water. More than likely, before the water reaches
the rim, the cup will fall over. Its support base is too weak to retain the liquid.
Similarly, sheng qi is unable to collect and settle.
6. Triangular lot. This is the most unfavorable of all the lot shapes. Simply, angular
lots are disorienting. 
Most likely, the shape of your lot corresponds to one of the illustrations just offered. Of
course, there are other shapes. Take an L configuration. This shape is considered unfavor-
able because qi has a difficult time maneuvering around corners. Also, the junction of
walls and/or fences produces angle sha, which impacts negatively on the well-being of the
occupants. But, what if you live on a lot with no visible boundaries? Common in the
Midwest, this situation features adjoining multiple lots with little, if any, visible division.
The suggestion here is of one great yard. As long as qi is able to flow unobstructed, nour-
ishing each structure, this housing configuration does not pose a problem. However, do
be mindful of wind tunnels. We suggest planting shrubs and trees to prevent possible neg-
ative effects.
Regarding apartment-dwellers, while the external lot the building sits on is certainly a
consideration, the shape of your unit within the building takes precedence. In other
words, think of the floor your unit is located on as the lot. Where your unit is situated
plays a role in the overall auspiciousness of your dwelling. Traditionally, side and back
units don’t receive as much light as front units. To offset the lack of yang qi, make sure
your unit is amply lit. 
House of Shapes
As we mentioned in Chapter 6, “The Principle of the Five Phases,” each of the five
phases corresponds to a shape: fire is triangular, earth is square, metal is round, water is
wavy, and wood is rectangular. How does the shape affect qi’s course? Consider each indi-
vidually:
◆A triangle. Most of us don’t live in a teepee or a church. But some of us live in A-
framed houses, or have some rooms whose walls are angular. Attic rooms are a good
example. What does this mean? Well, again, you may feel disoriented, out of con-
trol, as if the room might cave in on you. Some people feel claustrophobic. Also, if
two protruding walls come together to form an angle, this troublesome juncture
creates sha qi. 
Regarding qi’s flow in a triangular dwelling, imagine bouncing a Super Ball in this
room. What happens? The angular walls cause it to bounce in a crazy, haphazard
102

Chapter 9: Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings
fashion. It is the same with qi. After awhile, this dizzying effect will take its toll on
your well-being.
◆A square. This shape is your best friend. Square lots, square house, square rooms.
No fuss, no muss. Here, qi flows freely. So abstain from an architecturally chal-
lenged structure in favor of something nice and normal. You’ll be better off.
◆A circle. This shape is ideal for sports coliseums, but would you want to be caught
up in a whirlwind of qi? Imagine how water drains. Imagine the power a hurricane
or tornado creates. Caught in the path, it’s nearly impossible to free yourself. People
who live in circular houses or who spend a lot of time in domed or circular rooms
have trouble concentrating and sleeping.
◆Wavy. A house conforming to this horizontal shape has variegated roof/ceiling lines.
Like a ship at sea, the up-and-down motion of qi waves can cause you to feel unsta-
ble. Many castles and modern houses cor-
respond to this shape.
◆A rectangle. Symbolic of wood’s expan-
sion and growth, living in this type of
structure is considered favorable. Like a
square shape, rectangles don’t present any
odd angles to which qi will have difficulty
maneuvering. Ranch houses and trailers are
examples of rectangular dwellings. Now, a
rectangle standing on its end is also consid-
ered a wood shape. High-rise buildings are
good examples.
What about other configurations? While there are myriad different shapes, here are two
common ones that, from our experience, affect the occupants differently.
103
Many modern houses
are designed in a W- or lightning-
bolt shape. While these houses
may be the subject of interesting
conversation, the sharp angles
created by the juncture of these
walls can cause misfortune and
illness.
Feng Alert
Two common shapes that
affect the occupants differ-
ently.

Part 3: Understanding Your Environment
1. People who live in a house with a receding central section are known to be of hum-
ble means and content. But in this case, you can’t judge a book by its cover. While
subconsciously they may appear to others to lack wealth, it’s more likely the owners
are financially secure. This is because the back of their house is solid, providing sup-
port and security.
2. People who live in a house that forms a U-shape, its central back section missing,
subconsciously appear to others to be well off. In fact, these people are subjected to
possible divorce, money loss, and other misfortune. This is because the sitting side
of their dwelling does not provide uniform protection. Occupants feel as if they’re
exposed.
When judging a structure’s form and layout, disregard furniture, doors, and windows,
concentrating only on the shape of the dwelling and rooms. How do they make you feel?
Remember, the external and internal environment should nurture, not deplete, you.
A Grand Entrance
As you’ll soon find out in upcoming chapters, the most important part of a house is the
entrance. It represents who we are. Similar to the car we drive or the clothes we wear,
much can be said about the outward appearance of the main entrance. Yet, aside from
visual factors, the front door is the primary location for the invisible qi force to enter.
Later, you’ll learn to determine if the entrance is inherently auspicious. But for now, let’s
concentrate on factors that can influence how you and your guests feel.
104
The size of the entrance
affects occupants.
The size of your front door should be proportionate to the size of an average person (see
illustration 1). Illustrations 2 and 3 show an entrance that is too tall and too large, respec-
tively. Doors of this size encourage valuable qi to escape. In feng shui, it is believed you
may experience financial loss by having such a grand entrance.

Chapter 9: Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings
Conversely, if your entrance is too small (not
illustrated here), you are restricting qi from
entering. Here are some other considerations:
◆The front door should not be impeded by
things like a single tree or utility pole placed
curbside in direct alignment with your
entrance.
◆The front door should be protected against
any poison arrow qi coming from T-
junctions, Y-junctions, or other sha qi emit-
ted by neighboring structures.
◆The path leading to your front door should
be curved, forming a right angle just before
the door.
◆Ideally, the main entrance should be
at the top of a flight of stairs. Sub-
consciously, the occupants feel safer
above street level.
◆The main entrance should not be
below street level. Qi is not able to
enter easily; the occupants feel trapped.
◆The main entrance should be inviting. Your
front lawn should be mowed and bushes
trimmed. In general, you should feel good
about entering your own house; your guests
should feel welcome. Your house shouldn’t be an eyesore of weeds, overgrown
plants, and peeling paint!
◆The front entrance should not open onto a stairway positioned directly opposite the
door. Similar to living on a hilltop or a steep incline, your potential to accumulate
wealth will flow out the door.
◆The front door and back door should not be in alignment. Literally, qi will enter in
one door, and exit from the other.
◆The front entrance should be well lit. By protecting the main entrance, you’ll be
promoting better health, wealth, and happiness. 
You may be wondering if these considerations only apply to your main entrance. They
apply to the front door and any other door (such as the back or side entrances) you use
most often.
105
Many public buildings,
places of business, houses of
worship, and large residential
houses feature impressive double
doors. If you’re the owner of
such a dwelling and are experi-
encing financial troubles, the size
of the door may be a contribut-
ing factor to your hardship. We
suggest using only one side of
the door, disabling qi from gush-
ing out.
Feng Alert
Unfortunately, many houses are
constructed such that a long
hallway connects the front and
back doors. Considering the
appropriate five phase remedy
(and space provided), block neg-
ative qi’s path by placing a
screen, piece of furniture, or
plant near the main entrance.

Part 3: Understanding Your Environment
Room for Improvement
You may have heard that you should sleep with your head positioned toward the north.
But as you’ll soon learn, the direction you should sleep is determined by the trigram you
belong to—knowledge you’ll acquire in Chapter 10, “The Eight Houses, Part 1.” This
same method will also describe which directions are best for work and study. But until
then, other factors contribute to the quality of your sleep, work, and study. Even though
auspicious bed and desk positions are evaluated in the same way, we will separate the two
to facilitate easier learning. 
Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep
It stands to reason we should do everything possible to ensure a restful sleep. After all, we
spend a third of our lifetime in our bedroom. Disregarding factors such as the shape of
the room and the color of the room, here are some bed positions you should avoid:
106
Unfavorable bed placement.
1. The foot of your bed should not face the door. Qi’s flow will disrupt your sleep.
2. For the same reason, your bed should not be placed on the same wall as the door.
3. Your bed should not be positioned under a window. The elements will prevent a
peaceful rest.
4. Your bed should not be positioned between a doorway and window, or a combina-
tion thereof. The wind tunnel will cause a disturbance.

Chapter 9: Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings
5. Your bed should not be placed on an
angle. Having the solid support of the
black turtle will make you feel more
secure, preventing the boogeyman from
lurking in the black crevices.
6. You should not sleep under ceiling beams.
The beams cause qi to create a ripple effect,
the downward pressure impacting not only
your sleep but also your health.
So, where is the ideal place to position your bed?
Referring to the following illustrations, the bed
should be placed on an unobstructed wall diago-
nally across from the door, as far enough away from the window such that you aren’t
bothered by the direct hit of incoming qi. Also, the bed should be accessible from both
sides.
107
While bunk beds save
space, they don’t promote quality
sleep. The occupant on the bot-
tom feels threatened by the loom-
ing top bunk; the occupant at top
feels unconsciously susceptible to
an inevitable fall. If a room is too
small for two beds, consider a
trundle bed (a bed that slides out
from under a bed).
Feng Alert
Favorable bed placement.
Now, before you begin to move furniture, you must first learn to determine which direc-
tions favor you (an important factor you’ll learn about in the next chapter). Only then can
you make a competent evaluation.
Working Nine to Five
The time we spend in our bedrooms may reign, but the time we spend at our desks fol-
lows closely. So, again, it behooves us to harness sheng qi to promote a better livelihood.
Look at the following illustrations:

Part 3: Understanding Your Environment
1. Your back should not face a doorway. It’s important that you see anyone who enters.
More importantly, your back must be supported by a wall.
2. The desk must not be placed on the same wall as the doorway. Qi flows directly
toward you, causing a lack of concentration.
3. Your back must not be exposed to a window. Again, you need support. Besides,
incoming sunlight will cause a glare on your computer screen.
4. The desk should not be positioned between two doors or two windows, or a combi-
nation thereof. The wind tunnel creates a lack of concentration and need for paper-
weights.
5. The desk should not be placed on an angle. You need support to get the job done.
6. The desk should not be positioned under overhead beams. The bombardment of the
hammerlike qi pattern created by the beams will negatively affect you over time.
Now for the favorable positions. The following illustrations show a desk placed so that
the person’s back is supported by a wall. How close should your back be to the wall?
Close enough so that you feel it’s solidity. Also, you must be far enough away from qi’s
direct path entering through the window and door. And, the occupant must have a clear
view of anyone entering.
Again, don’t move anything just yet. First, you must learn how to determine your favor-
able directions. When all factors are considered, then you can begin the laborious task of
rearranging the furniture. Hey, while you’re at it, why not apply a fresh coat of paint
(using the appropriate color, of course), and get rid of clutter? Qi will flow more
smoothly. You’ll feel more organized, confident, and motivated.
108
Unfavorable desk placement.

Chapter 9: Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings
Moving Day
What about the rest of your house? What about arranging your living room, den, and
kitchen according to feng shui principles? Follow these simple guidelines and you’ll be on
your way to achieving harmony, balance, good health, and prosperity:
◆The furniture in the room should be a mixture of yin and yang. Balance dark with
light; angled corners with round.
◆The furniture should be proportionate to the room. The pieces should be arranged
evenly to facilitate easy access.
◆Sofas are best placed against a wall.
◆The backs of sofas or chairs should not face any entrances.
◆All areas should be free of clutter.
◆Objets d’art should be balanced.
It’s a good idea to plot out different furniture arrangements on graph paper. Study each
design and choose the one best corresponding to our suggestions. Sometimes change can
be difficult. So, have a friend or family member help you. A well-informed, objective
opinion can present options you may not have considered.
In the next part, we’ll introduce you to the Eight House method of feng shui.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Living next to a place of worship, school, hospital, or fire station can cause health
risks.
◆Living on gently sloping or flat terrain is better than living on a hill or a steep
incline.
109
Favorable desk placement.

Part 3: Understanding Your Environment
◆The shape of your lot and house affects how vital sheng qi is able to accumulate and
settle.
◆To ensure a restful sleep, your bed should be supported by a wall and positioned
away from doors and windows.
◆To increase productivity, your back should be supported by a wall; the desk should
be stationed away from doors and windows.

Part 4 is all about the Eight House system, the most popular method of feng
shui in Asia. Why is it so popular? Probably because it’s relatively easy to mas-
ter, requiring minimal calculations. Also, this method offers a black-and-white
analysis. No variables. No shades of gray. It’s a cinch.
Want to know if you’re compatible with your house? Or if you’re compatible
with your significant other? You’ll learn how to determine this here. Also,
you’ll learn which direction affords you the best sleep and which direction
promotes productivity at your work or study station. By making simple adjust-
ments, at no expense, you can improve your living situation.

sleep better facing a certain direction? Are there rooms in your home that
invite relaxation, peace, and comfort? Are there rooms that make you feel
uncomfortable, anxious, or depressed? Have you ever wondered about all of
this?
This chapter will answer these questions. So, sharpen your pencil—you’re

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
About Face: The Eight House System
Eight House feng shui proposes that each of the eight cardinal directions holds a different
kind of qi to which people and buildings react either positively or negatively. Stated
another way, Eight House is used to determine your four lucky and four unlucky direc-
tions (or areas within your home). Also, the system is used to determine your home’s
favorable and unfavorable directions. The object of Eight House is to ascertain a person’s
compatibility with his dwelling and then (using the five phases of qi that you learned
about in Chapter 6, “The Principle of the Five Phases”) remedy or enhance the qi in his
or her living and/or working space to provide a productive atmosphere conducive to good
health, harmony, and success. 
While we’ll expand upon these ideas in this chapter and in successive ones about Eight
House, for now understand the eight “houses” or trigrams that you learned about in
Chapter 7, “The Principle of the Eight Trigrams,” are divided into two groups of four 
trigrams—the East Group and the West Group:
◆East Group: Zhen (east), Xun (southeast), Kan (north), Li (south)
◆West Group: Qian (northwest), Kun (southwest), Gen (northeast), Dui (west)
Upon closer examination, you might wonder why each division contains a trigram that is
not directionally appropriate. Why does Kan (north) belong to the East Group? Why
does Gen (northeast) belong to the West Group? The traditional explanation cited in the
Yijing says that each group forms a family. This is easily demonstrated in the West Group:
father (Qian), mother (Kun), youngest son (Gen), and youngest daughter (Dui). But the
composition of the East Group familial unit requires a stretch of your imagination: The
middle son (Kan) and middle daughter (Li) are supported by the oldest son (Zhen) and
oldest daughter (Xun). Get the idea?
Generally, for those belonging to the East Group, all
four of its associated directions are favorable, while all
the directions of the West Group are unfavorable. For
those belonging to the West Group, all four of its asso-
ciated directions are favorable, while all the directions
in the East Group are unfavorable. People born in the
same group are more compatible than with those be-
longing to opposing groups. How can you determine to
which East or West Group you belong? You’ll find out
soon enough! By understanding and practicing Eight
House you’ll be able to … 
114
Eight House (Bazhai, in
Chinese) is a method of determin-
ing your four lucky and unlucky
directions for you and your
home. Also, it can be used to
determine how compatible you
are with any given person. Eight
House is also known as Yigua
(Changing Trigrams) feng shui,
Eight Mansions, and the East/
West System.
Wise Words

Chapter 10: The Eight Houses, Part 1
◆Determine your personal trigram.
◆Determine your home’s trigram.
◆Understand how the same house can affect people differently.
◆Locate an auspicious home and/or office.
◆Locate the productive (and unproductive) areas in your home.
◆Locate your best sleeping direction.
◆Determine if a potential mate is right for you.
◆Understand why you get along better with some people than with others.
Eight House is ideal for beginners because it’s relatively easy to master. Once you under-
stand its principles, application is a snap. You’ll be analyzing your home and your friends’
homes before you know it!
What’s Your Trigram?
Xun, Li, Kun, Zhen, Dui, Gen, Kan, or Qian? Don’t know your personal trigram? Well,
there’s a special formula that determines which trigram and its associations belong to you.
You need only to know two things: your year of birth and gender. Once you figure out your
personal trigram, you can then determine
which of the eight magnetic directions are
beneficial and which are detrimental to your
well-being. You’ll also understand how you
affect—and are affected by—other people.
Are you the controlled or the controller? Do
you support or are you supported?
115
According to legend, Yi Xing (673–727 C.E.), a Chan Buddhist monk, astronomer, and
royal advisor to the Tang dynasty, created the Eight House method at the request of
Emperor Xuan Zong (685–762 C.E.). However, while the emperor ordered Yi Xing to
devise a false method for the “barbarian” neighbors, the monk instead created a simple
one based on feng shui’s fundamental principles. While written documentation of Yi
Xing’s methodology no longer exists, the system is described in a few texts. First, there’s
the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 C.E.) text of unknown authorship called Yangzhai Shishu
(Ten Books on Residential Feng Shui). Then, there’s the Bazhai Mingjing (A Clear
Treatise on the Eight Houses), which is also known as the Bazhai Zhoushu (The
Complete Book of Eight Houses). Attributed to Ruo Guan (“bamboo hat”) Daoren
(“Daoist”) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911 C.E.), the Bazhai Mingjing was included in
Emperor Qian Long’s imperial library.
Feng Facts
Your personal trigram is deter-
mined by your birth year and
gender.
Master Class

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
Generally, those of the same gender born in a given year will share the same trigram—but
there’s an exception to this rule. If you were born between January 1 and February 2 of a
given year, you’ll use the year prior to your birth year to determine your personal trigram.
If you were born on February 3, 4, or 5, you must consult the table in Chapter 21, “Intro-
ducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac,” to determine to which year you
belong (instructions and examples are provided to ensure an accurate calculation). Why
all the fuss? This is because feng shui uses the Chinese solar calendar, which variously
marks February 3, 4, or 5 as the first day of the new year, the midpoint between the win-
ter solstice and spring equinox. For example, let’s take a woman born on January 3, 1962.
She would use the year 1961 to calculate her personal trigram.
Personal Trigram Formula: Male
Use the following formula to determine a male’s personal trigram. The blank spaces after
each sample calculation are for you to calculate your own personal trigram. If you’re a
female, you have to use the formula for female (in the following section)—use the formula
below to calculate the trigrams of the men in your family. Why are there different formu-
las for a male and female? Because yang (male) and yin (female) qi tend to flow in oppos-
ing directions. Although it is beyond our scope to investigate this further, know that each
formula is determined by movement of qi.
1. Add the digits in your birth year. As an example, let’s use a male born in 1954.
1 + 9 + 5 + 4 = 19
______ + ______ + ______ + ______ = ______
2. Add the resulting number until you get a single-digit number.
1 + 9 = 10; 1 + 0 = 1
______ + ______ = ______
3. Subtract the resulting number from 11. If the result is 10, add the digits until you
get a single-digit number.
11 – 1 = 10; 1 + 0 = 1
______ – ______ = ______
The resulting number is your ming gua, your natal or personal trigram, which is matched
with a number from the Luoshu magic square (something you’ll learn about in Chapter 13,
“The Flying Stars, Part 1”). 
In the example’s case, Kan (1) is his personal trigram. Kan is associated with the water
phase.
Note: If your personal trigram is 5, use number 2 as your trigram.
116

Chapter 10: The Eight Houses, Part 1
Personal Trigram Formula: Female
Use the following formula to determine a female’s personal trigram. The blank spaces are
for you to calculate your own personal trigram, assuming, of course, that you’re female.
1. Add the digits in the birth year. As an example, let’s continue with the woman. As we
have already concluded, the example would use 1961 as her Chinese birth year.
1 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 17
______ + ______ + ______ + ______ = ______
2. Add the resulting number until you get a single-digit number. 
1 + 7 = 8
______ + ______ = ______
3. Add 4 to the resulting number.
8 + 4 = 12
______ + ______ = ______
4. The resulting number is your personal trigram. Because the example’s resulting
number is a two-digit number, she must add up the digits. The sum is the example’s
personal trigram. Therefore:
1 + 2 = 3.
In the example’s case, Zhen (3) is her tri-
gram. Zhen is associated with the wood
phase.
Note: If your personal trigram is 5, use the num-
ber 8 as your trigram.
Now you know your personal trigram.

Chapter 21 to determine your
Chinese birth year.

The question often arises: “Does wearing the color or decorating my room in the
color associated with my personal trigram bring me good luck?” For example, if you
belong to the Zhen trigram, is green your best color? Or, if you belong to the Kan tri-
gram, are blue and black your best colors? The answer is: not necessarily. The col-
ors that represent your innate qi can only be determined by calculating your Four
Pillars, a method of Chinese astrology that you’ll learn about in Part 7, “Fate or Free
Will: What’s Your Destiny?”

The Eight Wandering Stars
The eight types of qi are collectively known as the Eight Wandering Stars (You Xing).
Referring to the following table, we’ve included each star’s Chinese name and English
translation, its associated phase, a level of fortune, and a description of its qi. The letter F
stands for Fortunate Qi, with F1 being the most favorable star and F4 being the fourth
most favorable star. Conversely, the letter H stands for Harmful Qi, with H1 representing
the least harmful star and H4 the most harmful star. Depending to which trigram you
belong, each of the eight directions is either fortunate or harmful to you in varying
degrees. So how can you determine which direction corresponds to Sheng Qi (F1), you
ask? Keep reading! 

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
Changing Your Fortune
To determine your most favorable directions, you need your personal trigram and its sym-
bol. (This method is also used to determine your home’s most favorable directions. But to
do this, you must first determine your home’s trigram, which you’ll learn in the next
chapter.) Again, follow along and compute your favorable directions using the space pro-
vided. 
Your F1 direction corresponds to Sheng Qi, the qi energy that brings about heightened
prosperity and respectability. It’s your most favorable magnetic direction for conducting
business, studying, or anything else of importance. To
determine your F1 direction, change line 3. Let’s take
the male example who belongs to the Kan trigram. In
this case, line 3 of the Kan trigram is yin (broken line).
He would then change it to yang (solid line).
120
The phase associated with each star (along with the phase associated with the Hou
Tian palaces or eight cardinal directions) will become particularly important when
you learn to balance the qi in your living/working space (the subject of Chapter 12,
“The Eight Houses, Part 3”). For a reminder about what phase governs a particular
direction, see Chapter 7, “The Principle of the Eight Trigrams,” or the front of the tear-
out card at the beginning of this book. 
Master Class
Remember, trigrams are read
from the bottom line up.
Master Class

Chapter 10: The Eight Houses, Part 1
Your F2 direction corresponds to Yan Nian, the qi energy that brings about longevity and
romantic relationships. The F2 direction is your second most favorable direction. To
determine your F2 direction, change all three lines. 
121
The example’s Kan trigram
changes to the Xun trigram,
located in the southeast.
The example’s Kan trigram
changes to the Li trigram,
located in the south. 
Your F3 direction corresponds to Tian Yi, the qi energy that brings about good health and
harmonious relationships. The F3 direction is your third most favorable direction. To
determine your F3 direction, change lines 1 and 2. In the example’s case, line 1 is yin,
which now changes to yang; line 2 is yang, which becomes yin.
The example’s Kan trigram
changes to the Zhen trigram,
located in the east.
Your F4 direction corresponds to Fu Wei, the qi energy that brings about peace and sta-
bility. F4 is your fourth most favorable direction. You will get your best sleep if the crown
of your head points toward F4. To determine your F4 direction, no lines are changed.
The example’s Kan (north)
trigram remains the same.
Your H1 direction corresponds to Hou Hai, the qi energy that is considered the first least
harmful. If located at your entrance or bedroom, H1 qi has been known to cause acci-
dents, arguments, and injury. To determine your H1 direction, change line 1. The exam-
ple’s yin line becomes a yang line.

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
Your H2 direction corresponds with Liu Sha, the qi energy that is considered the second
least harmful. H2 qi has been known to cause malicious encounters or sexual entangle-
ments and failed relationships. To determine your H2 direction, change lines 1 and 3. In
the example’s case, lines 1 and 3 are yin, which now becomes yang.
122
The example’s Kan trigram
changes to Dui, located in the
west.
The example’s Kan trigram
changes to Qian, located in
the northwest.
Your H3 direction corresponds with Wu Gui, the qi energy that is third least harmful. H3
qi has been known to cause fires, accidents, and abandonment of friends and family. To
determine your H3 direction, change lines 2 and 3. The example’s line 2 becomes yin; line
3 becomes yang.
The example’s Kan trigram
changes to Gen, located in
the northeast.
Your H4 direction corresponds with Jue Ming, the qi energy that is the most harmful and
dangerous. You should spend the least amount of time in or avoid this area altogether. H4
qi brings about disease, misfortune, and unproductive careers. Using entrances or bed-
rooms with H4 qi will weaken your health, wealth, and relationships. To determine your
H4 direction, change line 2. The example’s line 2 now becomes yin.
The example’s Kan trigram
changes to Kun, located in
the southwest.

Chapter 10: The Eight Houses, Part 1
If you’re wondering how a particular star is associated with the changing trigram formula,
there is a reason behind the methodology. For example, why is a person’s Sheng Qi (F1)
and not, say, the qi associated with the star Hou Hai, determined by changing line 3 of his
or her trigram? Unfortunately, space prevents us from offering an explanation here. How-
ever, one explanation can be found in Chapter 14 of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to the I
Ching.
123
The Eight Wandering Stars are matched with the nine stars of the Big Dipper as fol-
lows: Sheng Qi is matched with Tan Lang (Ravenous Wolf); Yan Nian is matched
with Wu Qu (The Military); Tian Yi with Ju Men (Great Gate); Fu Wei with the two
stars comprising the Big Dipper’s handle, Zou Fu and You Bi (Left and Right Assis-
tants); Hou Hai with Lu Cun (Prosperity Reserved); Liu Sha with Wen Qu (The
Scholars); Wu Gui with Lian Zhen (Chastity); and Jue Ming with Po Jun (Destructive
Army). Although it is not clear how the concept of the Nine Stars developed, many
scholars believe the names comprising the seven stars of the Big Dipper (excluding the
two stars forming its handle) came from India. 
Master Class
East Meets West
Notice how the example’s four most favorable directions belong to the same trigram
group: Xun (F1), Li (F2), Zhen (F3), and Kan (F4). They represent the East Group of tri-
grams we first defined at the beginning of this chapter. The example’s most unfavorable
directions belong to this opposing trigram group: Dui (H1), Qian (H2), Gen (H3), and
Kun (H4). They represent the West Group of trigrams.
This is a lot of work! How can you be sure you’ve calculated your favorable and unfavor-
able directions correctly? No fear, another quick reference table is here! The Wandering
Star Auspice chart can also be found on the front of the tear-out card in the beginning of
this book.
The following table (divided into East and West Groups) shows how each of the eight
Wandering Stars affects the trigram in question. For example, take the Kun trigram (West
Group). A Kun person’s favorable directions are northeast (F1), northwest (F2), west (F3),
and southwest (F4). Conversely, the Kun person’s unfavorable directions are east (H1),
south (H2), southeast (H3), and north (H4). Before you proceed, find your personal tri-
gram and learn the directions that are beneficial and detrimental to your well-being.

The eight trigrams and their
corresponding good and bad
directions.
Facing your favorable direc-
tions F1 to F3 will promote
good fortune and produc-
tivity.
At this point you may be thinking, “Okay, I understand this table. But how can the letter
designations help to improve my health, livelihood, and relationships?” Well, you can ben-
efit from the auspicious qi (designations F1 to F4) appropriate to your personal trigram by
making simple adjustments now. Referring to the illustration below, it is most advantageous
to face your F1 direction, followed by your F2 and F3 directions. Although F4 is more
favorable than H1 to H4, you might experience drowsiness or a sense of procrastination. 

Chapter 10: The Eight Houses, Part 1
Now, let’s discuss your most favorable sleeping directions. Referring to the following illus-
tration, the position promoting the most restful night’s sleep is to have the crown of your
head pointing toward your F4 direction. This is followed by F3 (your second choice) and
F2 (your third choice). Although F1 is more favorable than H1 to H4, sleeping toward
your F1 direction may cause insomnia. This is because your subconscious mind will con-
tinue to work at the same pace as when you are awake. The inability of the subconscious
mind to relax often causes insomnia.
125
To promote a restful night,
sleep with your head pointed
toward your F4 direction
ideally, then F3, F2, and F1
directions in order of decreas-
ing preferences.
Now that you understand how to determine the directions most beneficial to you, feel
free to don your work gloves and move your bed and desk positions accordingly. But, be
careful! You must also consider door and window alignment. As a reminder, consult
Chapter 9, “Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings.”
Are You Compatible?
As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, those belonging to the same East or West Group
are generally compatible and those belonging to opposing groups are not. While this is a
broad statement, let’s fine-tune the level of compatibility. First, determine the ming gua
(personal trigram) of the person in question. If his or her ming gua falls on the F1 or F2
sections of your chart (consult the Wandering Star Auspice table 3), the relationship (mar-
riage, friend, family member, boss, significant other, for example) is excellent. If his or her
gua falls on the F3 section of your chart, the relationship is very good. If it falls on the F4
section of your chart, the relationship is good. On the other hand, if the person’s gua is
located on your H1 section, the relationship is unsatisfactory. If the person’s gua is located
on your H2 section, the relationship is bad. And, if it is located on the H3 or H4 sections
of your chart, the relationship is disastrous.
For example, take a Zhen (3) person married to a Xun (4) person. The number 3 is lo-
cated in the east section of the Hou Tian (After Heaven) sequence of trigrams. Consulting
the previous Wandering Star Auspice table 3, east for a Xun person is F2. Therefore, their
relationship is excellent. Take a Zhen person married to a Kan (1) person. East (Zhen) for
a Kan person is F3—their marriage is very good. Take a Zhen person married to a Kun
(2) person. East (Zhen) for a Kun person is H1—their marriage is bad. Get the idea? 

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
The following People Compatibility table 4 illustrates the procedure we just described.
Considering the first example—the Zhen person married to a Xun person—the point
where the two trigrams intersect designates the quality of their relationship. Zhen and
Xun are F2 to each other. Note: If you’re F1 or F2 to each other, the relationship is excel-
lent. If you’re F3 to each other, the relationship is very good. If you’re F4 to each other,
the relationship is good. If you’re H1 to each other, the relationship is unsatisfactory. If
you’re H2 to each other, the relationship is bad. And, if you’re H3 or H4 to each other,
the relationship is disastrous.
126
Table 4
George W. Bush (Li/East Group) and Laura Welch Bush (Qian/West Group) belong to
opposing trigrams. They are H4 to each other. Bill Clinton (Li/East Group) and Hillary
Clinton (Dui/West Group) also belong to opposing trigrams. They are H3 to each other.
Prince Charles (Dui/West Group) and the former Princess Diana (Zhen/East Group) were
also incompatible. They were H4 to each other. On the positive side, JFK (Kun/West
Group) and Jacqueline Kennedy (Dui/West Group) were F3 to each other; Richard
(Dui/West Group) and Pat Nixon (Gen/West Group) were F2 to each other; and Ronald
(Gen/West Group) and Nancy Reagan (Gen/West Group) are F4 to each other.
According to an old Chinese proverb, if you believe everything you read in a book, it is
better to be without the book. While we believe Eight House is 75 percent accurate, there
is a margin for error. Hence, some of these examples may not be entirely accurate.

As an experiment, determine the personal trigrams of individuals you like and dislike.
More often than not, those with whom you share an affinity belong to the same East or
West Group as you. Those who “rub you the wrong way” probably belong to an opposing
group.
The next chapter continues with the Eight House system. Focusing on determining your
home’s trigram, you’ll learn how to choose the dwelling best suited to you.

Your House Has a Trigram, Too
Just as you have a personal trigram, so does your home, building, apartment, and office
unit. Although their trigrams are determined using a different technique, the other rules
still apply:
◆The trigrams are divided into the same set of East and West Groups.
◆Trigrams belonging to the same group are compatible, whereas trigrams belonging
to opposing groups are not.
◆The trigram F through H symbologies remain the same.
The following illustrations show the eight types of dwellings that can be determined by
using the Eight House system. The 
symbol represents the sitting direction of the
house. The 
symbol represents the facing direction of the house. The sections outlined
in bold represent each group’s favorable directions.

The East Group House Trigrams

Chapter 11: The Eight Houses, Part 2
Notice how the F4 direction, or F4 qi, is in the same position in each of the eight tri-
grams. In feng shui, this position is called the sitting direction. The sitting direction deter-
mines the trigram. For example, Zhen is associated with the direction east. East is in
Zhen’s F4 direction. Dui is associated with the direction west. West is in Dui’s F4 direc-
tion. Li is associated with the direction south. South is in Li’s F4 direction. And so forth.
A house also has a facing direction. While we will
learn how to determine this later on in this
chapter, know that the facing direction is mag-
netically opposite the sitting direction. If this
may seem like an obvious assumption, determin-
ing a home’s sitting and facing sides is often a
confusing task—even to an experienced practi-
tioner. Evaluating apartment units is perhaps the
most difficult. But, don’t fret. We’ve provided

The West Group House Trigrams
A home’s sitting direc-
tion determines its trigram. The
sitting direction usually corre-
sponds to the backside of a
dwelling. A home’s facing direc-
tion is magnetically opposite its
sitting direction.

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
detailed instructions on how to make a competent evaluation of your home’s sitting and
facing directions.
Ideally, your home’s main entrance, your bedroom, and other rooms where you spend the
most amount of time (living/family room, kitchen, home office) should hold favorable qi
represented by the designations F1, F2, F3, and F4. The unfavorable qi areas represented
by the designations H1, H2, H3, and H4 should be designated to rooms like the laundry
room, bathrooms, guest bedrooms, and the basement—areas in which you spend less
time.
Comparing Your Personal Trigram to a Home’s Trigram
It stands to reason that the same can affect people in different ways. For example, while
you may feel comfortable in a particular place, another might feel on edge, unable to
relax. This “feeling” has to do with your innate compatibility with your dwelling. So, how
can you find a home that is the most compatible with your personal trigram? Simple.
We’ll use the same chart in the previous chapter that determined a person’s compatibility
with another person. For a reminder about what each F or H designation stands for,
please see Chapter 10, “The Eight Houses, Part 1,” or the front of the tear-out card in
the beginning of this book.
For example, a Zhen person is compatible with a Li house (F1), a Xun house (F2), a Kan
house (F3) and a Zhen house (F4). A Zhen person is not compatible with a Kun house
(H1), Gen house (H2), Qian house (H3), and a Dui house (H4).

Chapter 11: The Eight Houses, Part 2
You might ask, “Why not just locate the house
whose F1 qi matches my personal trigram?
Why settle for second, third, or fourth best?”
Referring to the previous table, if you’re a Li per-
son, then your first choice would be to live in a
Zhen house. Right? Not necessarily. While F1 qi
brings great prosperity and respectability, it also
brings an atmosphere charged with activity. F1 qi
motivates, making it an ideal house for those in
their earning years. But what if you’re retired? In
this case, a Li person’s best choice would be to
live in a home matching his own personal trigram.
A Li house would bring a Li person peace and stability, represented by the designation
F4. Your best choice is to choose a home suited to your needs.
Now that you’ve located the homes that are compatible with your personal trigram,
you’re probably wondering which trigram your own home belongs to. Good question.
Let’s find out!
Determine Your Home’s Sitting and Facing Directions
As you’ve learned, your house/building/apartment/office unit’s trigram is determined by
its sitting direction. The sitting direction is the direction your house or apartment unit
leans against. Imagine your house or unit sitting in an armchair. Now, what direction cor-
responds with its backside? For a house, this is pretty easy to figure out. It’s the side cor-
responding to the backyard or alley. For an apartment, determining the sitting side is a
little tricky. It’s the yin side of the unit, the part containing the bedrooms—the less active
areas. 
Once you’ve located the sitting or backside of your dwelling, the facing side is magneti-
cally opposite. Don’t allow the position of the front door to cloud your judgment. In clas-
sical feng shui, the front door plays no role in determining the sitting and facing sides of
the building or unit in question. Using the chair analogy again. If you’re sitting in a chair,
your back represents the sitting direction and your front side represents the facing direc-
tion, right? Now, say that your face represents the main entrance. While the main en-
trance usually correlates with the facing side, in some cases, the front door may represent
neither the sitting nor the facing side. For example, if you turn your head (front door) to
the right, your front or facing side hasn’t changed. Get the idea? 
Before you whip out your compass to take a reading of your dwelling, assess the whole sit-
uation. It’s not enough to simply locate and study a component of the building. Under-
standing the whole layout is essential to preparing an accurate feng shui analysis. By
133

should live in East Group homes.
West Group people should live

a home that opposes your per-
sonal trigram can only allow you
to enjoy about 75 percent of the
fortunate qi of the house. 
Feng Alert

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
making an incorrect judgment, your reading will be based on the wrong trigram for that
dwelling.
There are many factors you must consider when determining your home’s orientation,
but again, the fundamental rule to remember is that the sitting and facing directions are
magnetically opposite. Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind as you determine
your home’s orientation:
◆The backyard corresponds to the sitting direction.
◆A back alleyway usually corresponds to the sitting direction.
◆The main entrance is usually on the facing direction.
◆The street address corresponds to the facing direction.
◆Traffic is heaviest on the facing direction.
◆Large windows may indicate the facing direction.
◆Room location may help determine the sitting and facing directions. Usually, the
living/family rooms (the yang areas) are located on the facing side, while the bed-
rooms and kitchen (the yin areas) are located on the sitting side.
◆For apartments and offices, furniture arrangement is a strong indicator of its facing
direction.
Understanding how to locate the sitting and facing directions is the most important
aspect of performing a precise feng shui reading. But try not to overanalyze each situa-
tion. Instead, feel how the dwelling is oriented. Use your common sense. Go with your
gut. Determining the sitting and facing directions requires keen observation, practice,
groundwork, and patience.
Using a Compass to Determine Your Home’s Trigram
You can obtain an accurate reading of your home’s sitting direction using an ordinary
Western-style compass. For our purposes here, we’ll use the Silva Explorer Model 203
compass that’s pictured in Chapter 1, “What Is Feng Shui?” (See Chapter 1 for more
detailed instructions regarding compass selection.) If you are unfamiliar with using a com-
pass, spend a few minutes to become comfortable with it. While it will probably be obvi-
ous to you, a little patience and caution will prevent inaccurate readings.
To determine your home’s trigram, refer to the following illustration as you follow these
simple procedures.
To determine the facing and sitting direction:
134

Chapter 11: The Eight Houses, Part 2
1. As indicated by the illustration, first
stand in front of your house, the side
corresponding to the facing side.
Make sure your back is perfectly
square with the house.
2. Holding your compass at waist level, rotate
the compass dial until the red portion of the
magnetic arrow aligns with north.
3. Read the compass grade at the index line
(labeled the “bearing” line on the Silva
Explorer Model 203). This is the facing
direction. The grade magnetically opposite
is the sitting direction.
4. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3, taking a reading at two other locations parallel to the sit-
ting side of your home as indicated by illustrations B and C. 
If you live in an apartment, you must take a reading of your unit outside the dwelling.
Likewise, if you are analyzing your own office unit, take a reading of the space outside the
building.
135
To ensure an accurate compass
reading, remove any metal
adornments—including
watches, cufflinks, belt buckles,
and jewelry—that may influ-
ence the compass’s magnetic
arrow. Also, make sure you dis-
tance yourself from parking
meters, cars, and even the build-
ing itself. Generally, a distance
of five feet should be sufficient to
ensure an accurate reading.
Master Class
Take several compass read-
ings until you are sure of an
accurate one. The example
shows a Gen house facing
southwest 225 degrees and
sitting northeast 45 degrees.

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
What’s Your House Trigram?
Now that you’ve determined the compass grade, consult the following table to determine
which trigram your home belongs to. Referring to the previous illustration, the house sits
45 degrees northeast and faces 225 degrees southwest. Based on the sitting direction, the
house belongs to the Gen trigram. If your index (facing) line reads 180 degrees, your
house would belong to the Kan trigram. It sits north and faces south. If your index line
reads 330 degrees, your house would belong to the Li trigram. It sits south and faces
north. If your index line reads 125 degrees, your house belongs to the Qian trigram. It
sits northwest and faces southeast. It’s simple once you get the hang of it!

Now that you’ve learned how to calculate a building’s trigram, you can use the tables in
this chapter to see how compatible you are with that building. 
Assembling a Simple Floor Plan
If you’re lucky enough to have a to-scale floor plan of your home, you’re ahead of the
game. But most of you probably don’t. Assembling one is no big deal. Your goal is to draw
a simple plan with the sitting direction oriented on the bottom of the page. To get a better
idea of your task at hand, refer to the following illustration. Your floor plan should 
include … 
◆All exterior and interior entrances and doorways.
◆All windows.
◆All beds.
◆All desks.

Chapter 11: The Eight Houses, Part 2
To avoid wasting time, don’t try to eyeball the measurements. Why not? Because ulti-
mately, you’re going to divide the whole of your dwelling into eight equal wedges—each
wedge corresponding to the F1 to F4 and H1 to H4 qi fields you learned about in the
previous chapter. An inaccurate measurement will ensure an incorrect analysis of which
areas hold positive and negative qi. Instead, spend an extra 15 minutes to measure the
length and width of your dwelling. There are a few ways you can do this:
◆Get one of those nifty electronic measuring devices found in most hardware or
building supply stores. The one we use is the Starrett DigiTape, which costs about
$24. All you have to do is run the tape measure. The measurement will illuminate in
the display window.
◆Use a plain old tape measure or ruler. It’ll take a couple more minutes, but what’s
the hurry?
◆Use the tried-and-true, one-foot-in-front-of-the-other method. It’s a little less exact,
but it gets the job done. Counting one step as a measurement of one foot in length,
just place your right heel parallel to the wall, then place your left foot at the right’s
toe. Continue walking, heel to toe, counting the number of steps to the end of the
wall.
We suggest first measuring the length of each room. Begin with the back wall connected
to the sitting side of your dwelling. Jot down its measurement. Next, measure the room
adjacent to the length of the wall you just measured. (Don’t forget to consider the wall
space separating each room.) Jot down its measurement. Continue this procedure until the
last room adjacent to the length of the wall in question is measured. Repeat this procedure
to obtain the width of each room. Based on these measurements, you can now draw a sim-
ple to-scale floor plan. We suggest using a pencil as you may have to make changes.
If your home is more than one story, you must draw a plan for each floor. But believe us,
it’s worth the effort.
The next step is to divide your dwelling into
eight equal wedges. First, find the center of the
house by dividing the total length and width by
two. For example, if the total length is 60 feet, the
midpoint is 30 feet. If the total width is 45 feet,
the midpoint is 221⁄2 feet. The point where the
midsections converge corresponds to the center of
your dwelling. Your final step is to label the plan.
Inside, label each room. Outside, label each of the
eight directions. To note the sitting and facing
directions use the sitting 
and facing 
sym-
bols. Finally, write down the name of your house
137
For teaching purposes,
we have divided the sample floor
plan into eight equal wedges.
Yet, please understand the real
dividing lines are the walls! You
must not be so rigid when apply-
ing classical feng shui methods.
Remember, the qi fields are inter-
connected, not separate and dis-
tinct parts!

Great Grids!
But, you ask, what if my house isn’t square? What if it’s a rectangle, an L-shape, or it has
some funky alcoves? What if my house is missing a section? The following illustrations
show some examples of irregularly shaped houses divided properly. 
The first illustration, A, shows a house with a missing section. Is this bad luck? No! A
missing section is a missing section. It is not unlucky. End of story.
Illustration B also has sections missing to varying degrees. Again, you can’t make some-
thing out of nothing. To find the center of a house with a trapezoid shape, connect the
midpoint of the upper and lower sides. Because the house is broader at the base (or sitting
side), the center is one-third to halfway from the base.

family member, his or her trigram and East or West Group association. A completed sam-
ple floor plan is shown in the following figure.

Chapter 11: The Eight Houses, Part 2
Illustration C shows a house with a small extension. If an extended area is one-quarter or
less than the main body of the house, then the extension becomes part of the wedge in
question, as in illustration C. However, if an extended area is greater than one-quarter of
the main body of the house, then it is representative of an L-shaped house. Follow the
instructions provided for illustration D following. 
Illustration D shows an L-shaped house. To locate the center of the house, first find the
center of each wing (figure D1). The center of the house will be along the line joining the
centers of the wings. But be careful. If the two wings comprising the L-shape are equal,
the center would be the exact midpoint of this line. However, in this example, the north-
south wing is bigger than its smaller east-west counterpart. Therefore, the center will be
closer to center of the larger rectangle. Represented by an “x,” the point marks the center
for the whole house (figure D2).

◆By matching your personal trigram to a home’s trigram, you can determine your

◆The sitting direction is determined by a compass reading.
◆Creating a to-scale floor plan ensures an accurate reading.

Some feng shui masters divide a house by creating a grid of nine equal cells—an
idea that conforms to the nine-celled Luoshu numeric diagram (you’ll learn about this
in Chapter 12, “The Eight Houses, Part 3”). While this is an acceptable practice,
we believe the pie-shaped wedges conform to the movement of qi through the per-
petual cycle of nature (birth, growth, decay, and death). Also, as you’ll learn in
Chapter 14, “The Flying Stars, Part 2,” the Chinese believe time is cyclic rather than
linear.

The Eight Houses, Part 3
In This Chapter
◆Understanding how the palace phase qi affects the house
◆Understanding how the wandering star phase qi affects the house
◆Understanding how to balance the wandering star phase qi to promote 
a better well-being
If you wanted to, you could just determine those areas within your home that
bring benevolent qi and arrange your house accordingly. For example, let’s 
say your house belongs to the East Group trigram Kan. Its good areas are the
southeast, south, east, and north. Ideally, your front door, bedroom, and any
other room where you spend a lot of time in, should be situated in these four
areas. If you belong to an East Group trigram (Zhen, Xun, Kan, or Li), your
qi would be compatible with a Kan house. In other words, your four favorable
directions are the same as those within your dwelling. If you are incompatible
with your home, well, at the very least, orient your bed and desk so that you
face your sheng qi—your beneficial qi.
What we’ve just described is the first layer of Eight House. The next layer is
to examine how the palace qi (the phases associated with the eight cardinal
directions) and wandering star qi (the phases associated with the F to H levels
of auspice) interact. This is what this chapter is all about. Here, you’ll need
your divided floor plan that you constructed in the previous chapter.
Chapter

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
Do You Know Where Your Palace Is?
Eight House requires knowledge of the bagua, the Hou Tian (After Heaven) sequence 
of trigrams and its affiliations. While you may want to review Chapter 7, “The Principle
of the Eight Trigrams,” we’ll provide a short review here. Each of the eight directions is
ruled by a palace. Each palace is assigned a phase. Referring to the following table, the
fire palace is related to the south and the fire phase; the earth palace is related to the
southwest and the earth phase; the lake palace is related to the west and the metal phase;
the heaven palace is related to the northwest and the metal phase, and so forth. Later on,
you’ll be applying this information to your floor plan. But, don’t do anything just yet! We
need to assemble more information.

The palace qi map represents the foundation. It’s the base qi, the bedrock or stable qi

Do You Know Where Your Wandering Star Is?
In Chapter 10, “The Eight Houses, Part 1,” you learned about the Eight Wandering Stars.
Again, while a review of the chapter will help facilitate easier learning, we’ll offer an over-
view here. Referring to the following table, the wandering star called Sheng Qi is affili-
ated with F1, the most fortunate level of auspice related to the wood phase; the star Yan
Nian is affiliated with F2, the second most fortunate qi related to the metal phase; the star
Tian Yi is affiliated with F3, the third most fortunate qi related to the earth phase; the star
Fu Wei is affiliated with F4, the fourth most fortunate qi related to the wood phase, and
so forth. Like the palace qi, you will be applying this information to your floor plan. But
not just yet!

Chapter 12: The Eight Houses, Part 3
The wandering star qi map is the working force, the energy that actively affects the health,
livelihood, and harmony of the occupants. Unlike the palace qi map that is constant and
stable, the wandering star qi map varies according to the magnetic orientation of your
house (a subject we covered in Chapter 11, “The Eight Houses, Part 2”). Stated another
way, a dwelling’s sitting direction determines which of the eight different wandering star
qi maps your home belongs to. For our purposes, we will carry over the Zhen house floor
plan from the previous chapter. Belonging to the East Group set of trigrams, the wander-
ing star qi distribution is a follows:

Chapter 12: The Eight Houses, Part 3
Did you locate the wandering star chart corresponding to your house? Good. Let’s move on.
Qi-ing In on Qi
The next step is to determine the areas within the house that are favorable and unfavor-
able to each occupant. Continuing with our case study of the Zhen house, let the owner
Peter belong to the Xun trigram. Let his wife, Mary, belong to the Zhen trigram, and
their son Jacob to the Qian trigram. The qi that is beneficial and detrimental to their
well-being breaks out as follows:
145
The qi distribution of those
living in a Zhen house.
If you haven’t already done so, take this time now to determine the good and bad direc-
tions affiliated with your ming gua, your personal trigram. If you don’t know your per-
sonal trigram, and those belonging to your family, consult Chapter 10 or look on the back
of the tear-out card at the front of this book.
The Good, the Bad, and the Possibilities
Okay, it’s now time to apply all the information we’ve assembled so far onto the floor
plan. So that we’re all on the same page, so to speak, first study the following floor plan,
and then write down the information appropriate to your house in the same way.

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
Upon closer examination, note that while Peter and
Mary are inherently compatible with their home (the
couple and the dwelling belonging to East Group tri-
grams Xun, Zhen, and Zhen respectively), Jacob is not.
He belongs to the West Group trigram Qian. Despite
the couple’s innate compatibility with their home, the
main entrance is inauspicious for them (H2 for Peter;
H4 for Mary). Yet, for their son Jacob, the main en-
trance promotes the likelihood of good fortune (F1).
To mitigate the possibility of misfortune, Peter and
Mary should use an alternate entrance, the one leading
from the garage (not illustrated) to the kitchen. This
entrance envelopes Peter in F1 qi and Mary in F3 qi.

and wandering star.
If your bedroom is located in an
inauspicious area and you can-
not move to another room that is
more favorable, at least orient
your bed so that the crown of
your head points toward a favor-
able direction. Also, make sure
your desk is positioned so that
you face a favorable direction.
Feng Facts

Chapter 12: The Eight Houses, Part 3
Regarding the bedrooms, Peter and Mary
sleep in a favorable area (F4 and F2 respec-
tively), their heads pointed toward an auspi-
cious direction—east for Peter corresponds
to his F2 qi and for Mary, F4. Also, while
Jacob sleeps in an area compatible with his
innate qi (F3), his bed is pointed toward the
north, his H2 qi. If we position the bed
toward the east wall, it corresponds to his H3
qi. This leaves the west wall between the
doorway and the window. Although the bed
position corresponds to his F1 qi, Jacob must be mindful of a potential wind tunnel pro-
duced by an open window and an open door. To prevent illness and sleeplessness associ-
ated with this inauspicious surge of qi, Peter must keep either the door or the window
closed when he sleeps.
The Rules of the Eight House Game
Now, that you’ve determined your lucky and unlucky areas within your home and have
positioned your bed and desk to take advantage of your good qi, we can begin to examine
and remedy the qi phases associated with the palace and wandering star. But, first, let’s set
up some rules:
Rule 1: If a good wandering star (F1, F2, F3, F4) enhances (produces) the palace, install
the phase that enhances the star. This is because the palace is weakening the star. For
example, while wood (F1) is enhancing the southern fire palace, fire is weakening wood’s
power. Add water to fortify wood’s strength.
Rule 2: If a good wandering star (F1, F2, F3, F4) assists (is the same as) the palace, install
the phase that enhances them. For example, if F1 (wood) resides in a wood palace (east or
southeast), add water.
Rule 3: If a good wandering star (F1, F2, F3, F4) controls the palace, do nothing. For
example, if wood’s F1 qi controls an earth palace (southwest or northeast), leave it alone.
Adding a phase to enhance or assist the star will not help matters. Weakening it will
deplete the favorable star’s power.
Rule 4: If a good wandering star (F1, F2, F3, F4) is being controlled by the palace, add
the phase that restores balance to the cycle. Although the palace will be weakened, the
star will be strengthened. For example, if wood’s F1 qi is being controlled by a metal
palace (west or northwest), add water to reinstate the natural sequence of qi.
Rule 5: If a bad wandering star (H1, H2, H3, H4) enhances (produces), assists (is the
same as), or controls the palace, install the phase that weakens the star. The idea is to
lessen the bad star’s unfavorable affect.
147
What if you and your spouse
belong to opposing groups?
While one solution would be
to sleep in different bedrooms,
this is not feasible for most 
couples. In this case, the spouse
whose trigram opposes the home’s
trigram should be favored.
Master Class

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
Rule 6: If a bad wandering star (H1, H2, H3, H4) is
being controlled by the palace, do nothing. Adding the
phase to weaken the inauspicious star will control the
palace. For example, if H4’s metal is being controlled
by the southern fire palace, water will deplete the bad
metal’s zeal, but also dominate the palace. Therefore,
leave it alone. If possible, avoid the area.
As you can see, the focus is on the wandering star and
not the palace. The star is the qi force that directly
affects the occupants and thus, it must be remedied
accordingly. Using an analogy, the palace can be likened
to the plate we eat on. A plate can’t affect your well-
being, right? The wandering star is the food. Good
food nourishes and bad food causes an upset stomach
or even food poisoning.
The Analysis
To help bolster your understanding of the five phase relationships, please refer to Chapter 6,
“The Principle of the Five Phases,” for a refresher. Also, the front of the tear-out card is
invaluable. We’ve condensed the productive, controlling, and weakening cycles into one
illustration. For quick reference, you can consult the following table:
148
But what of the phase associ-
ated with a person’s ming
gua? It is not considered in an
Eight House analysis. In fact, a
person’s ming gua phase is not
really representative of his or her
innate qi. In Chapter 23, “The
Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 2,”
and Chapter 24, “The Four
Pillars of Destiny, Part 3,” you’ll
learn how to determine the
phases most beneficial to you.
Master Class
The five phases of qi and
their enhancing, assisting,
controlling, and weakening
agents.
Referring to the previous illustration of the Zhen house, let’s examine each room. We’ll
begin in the west and travel clockwise around the house.

Chapter 12: The Eight Houses, Part 3
West Entrance: palace (metal) H4 star (metal)
An inauspicious metal star (H4) is assisting the metal palace. According to Rule 5, we
must weaken the wandering star. Therefore, the main entrance needs the water phase. 
A table fountain or an aquarium will do nicely.
Northwest Dining Room: palace (metal) H3 star (fire)
An inauspicious fire star (H3) is controlling the metal palace. According to Rule 5, we
must add the phase that weakens the star. In this case, earth will deplete fire’s unfavorable
effect. Ceramic, clay, or stone table bases, vases, or statuary will work. This area shouldn’t
contain plants as the wood phase will empower fire’s bad nature.
North Kitchen: palace (water) F3 star (earth)
A favorable earth star (F3) is controlling the water palace. According to Rule 3, do nothing.
Northeast Jacob’s Bedroom: palace (earth) H2 star (water)
According to Rule 6, nothing can be done to remedy an inauspicious star being controlled
by a palace. Here, the water H2 star is being controlled by an earth palace. Yet, despite the
innate inauspiciousness, the northeast area is good for Jacob (F3). Again, this is because he
belongs to the West Group; the house belonging to the East Group set of trigrams.
East Closets: palace (wood) F4 star (wood)
Although it is not necessary to remedy closet space, for sake of learning we’ll pretend it’s
another room. Here, a favorable wood star (F4) is assisting the wood palace. According to
Rule 2, we must add the phase that enhances them. In this case, water enhances or produces
wood. It would not be wise to burn candles or decorate this room with red tones as the
fire phase will weaken wood’s good nature.
Southeast Master Bedroom: palace (wood) F2 star (metal)
A favorable metal star (F2) is controlling the wood palace. According to Rule 3, do nothing.
South Bathroom: palace (fire) F1 star (wood)
A favorable wood star (F1) is enhancing the fire palace. According to Rule 1, add the water
phase to strength wood’s benevolent qi. Because this is the bathroom, the area is self-
remedied.
Southwest Living Room: palace (earth) H1 star (earth)
An inauspicious earth star (H1) is assisting the earth palace. According to Rule 5, add the
phase that weakens the star. Here, metal weakens earth. Metal table bases, picture frames,
a chiming clock, or statuary will work well. Avoid burning candles and using the fireplace
excessively here. This is because fire will empower the wandering star’s bad nature.
149

Part 4: Feng Shui Mechanics 101
In Part 5, “Feng Shui Mechanics 201,” you’ll learn about a more sophisticated method of
feng shui called Flying Star. Why is it more sophisticated? Because it includes the element
of time. Specifically, a Flying Star analysis studies the time your home was “born” and the
magnetic space it sits on. As you’ll soon learn, the eight fundamental directions are divided
into three finer distinctions each. Therefore, instead of your dwelling belonging to one of
eight directions, it will belong to one of twenty-four directions.
The Least You Need to Know
◆The palace star is the qi force affiliated with the eight cardinal directions.
◆The wandering star is the qi force that directly affects the well-being of the occupants.
◆Eight House methodology seeks to enhance the good stars and weaken the bad stars
by using the appropriate phase fire, earth, metal, water, or wood.
◆The phase associated with a person’s ming gua (personal trigram) is not considered.
150
When remedying or enhancing, the actual phase is more powerful than its represen-
tative color. For example, water is more effective than blue and black; a working fire-
place and a burning candle are more effective than red, purple, and pink; a plant is
more effective than green. Yet, if possible, incorporate the appropriate color scheme
into the remedy/enhancement in question. A little extra edge goes a long way
toward a balanced environment.

A bit more complex, but well worth your while, Part 5 teaches you the Flying
Star System. Here, you’ll use those mysterious numbers correlated to the five
phases and eight trigrams. Although numerology is the gist of this method,
mathematics isn’t involved. So put away your calculator and put on your
thinking cap. Understanding a number’s inherent nature and its life cycle,
among other things, can be tricky business. 
Part 5 also give you step-by-step instruction about performing a Flying Star
analysis. You’ll learn what the number combinations mean and how you can
remedy or enhance the qi in a particular area to encourage favorable events
and discourage unfavorable ones. We know you’ll find this sophisticated tech-
nique interesting and enlightening.

You’ve come this far. You’ve learned the three fundamental principles govern-
ing feng shui: yin and yang, the five phases, and the eight trigrams. You’ve
learned the simple, yet profound Eight House system of determining your
home’s qi essence and your compatibility with it. You’ve learned how to use
this system to make the most out of your living space. Now you’re ready to
learn Flying Star, a more sophisticated technique that uses factors associated
with both time and space to describe your dwelling’s qi. Yet, before you apply
this method, you must first acquire some background knowledge. This will
help you to better understand this complex, yet fascinating system of feng shui.
This chapter’s all about learning the history behind the “stars,” or numbers,
that govern your well-being.
Chapter

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
What Is the Flying Star System?
The system of Flying Star addresses questions you may have asked while learning the
Eight House system. Why does the Eight House system paint a static picture of our 
living and/or working space? Why haven’t we incorporated the element of time into the
equation? These are typical questions concerning the Eight House system.
Taken together, Eight House and Flying Star provide 
a more detailed analysis of your living and/or working
situation. Considered individually, one system isn’t
superior over the other. In feng shui, we look at how
the whole of its principles work together. Everything
you’ve learned, all the components that make up feng
shui, are necessary tools for conducting an accurate
reading. Neglecting a component would be like driving
a car with three wheels! It simply can’t be done.
Ancient Beginnings
You might be wondering about the word “star” in
Flying Star. Are the numbers 1 to 9 affiliated with nine
celestial stars? Yes and no. The stars in question are 
the seven stars that form the Big Dipper (Beidou), plus
the two adjacent stars at its handle. Like the principle
of the five phases, it’s not the object (the stars) that is
important but the movement and transformation of its
associated qi. 
But what is the meaning behind each star? Unfortunately,
this is not known. Like so much of feng shui, the origi-
nal documentation is lost in history. Only the methods
remain. Yet, suffice it to say, the ancient Chinese recog-
nized mathematical patterns in nature. The Flying Star
system is based on their observation of the macrocosmic
world and its influence on us, the microcosmic world.
These observations gave rise to two specific mathemat-
ical diagrams of the universe, as you are about to learn.
154
In Chinese, Flying Star is called
Xuankong Feixing, which means
“Time and Space Flying Stars.”
While there exists no textual evi-
dence to support the system’s
authorship, Flying Star was prob-
ably developed during the Tang
dynasty (618–907 C.E.) and 
no later than the Song dynasty
(960–1279 C.E.). Jiang Da
Hong, an officer in the Ming
dynasty (1368-1644 C.E.), is
credited as being the first feng
shui master on record to use
Flying Star. 
Feng Facts
Flying Star is a sophisti-
cated and complex system of
analyzing how time and space
affect a building. The magnetic
orientation of the dwelling, along
with the year the home was built,
are important factors that deter-
mine the innate character of the
house.

Chapter 13: The Flying Stars, Part 1
The Hetu River Map
The fifth century B.C.E. text called the
Shangshu (Classic of History) tells how Fuxi,
one of China’s legendary figures who is cred-
ited with inventing the bagua (the eight fun-
damental trigrams), among other things,
received a gift from heaven. But, it was no
ordinary gift, for it described an ideal world
where all is in perfect harmony. According to
legend, the gift appeared as a pattern of black
and white dots on the flank of a mystical dragon-horse emerging from the Yellow River.
Hence, the diagram is also known as the Hetu (also spelled Ho-t’u) or River Map. In the
following diagram of the Hetu, the markings illustrate structure and balance, with the
white dots representing yang, the black dots, yin. This scheme becomes clearer when
numbers are applied to the dot patterns. For example, the 7 white dots found at the top of
the diagram correspond to the number 7 in the numeric structure of the Hetu. The 2 black
dots beneath the 7 white dots correspond to the numeric value of 2, and so forth. Disre-
garding the central 5 white dots and surrounding 10 black ones, you can see how the odd
(yang) numbers are perfectly balanced by an opposing even (yin) number: 1 (yang) is
opposite 2 (yin); 3 (yang) is opposite 4 (yin); 6 (yin) is opposite 7 (yang), and 8 (yin) is
opposite 9 (yang).
Upon closer examination (again, disregarding the central 5), notice how all of the odd
(yang) numbers and even (yin) numbers add up to 20: 1 + 3 + 7 + 9 = 20; 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20.
155
The Hetu, or River Map,
is a pattern of black (yin) and
white (yang) dots purportedly
found on a fantastic dragon-
horse emerging from the Yellow
River. The Hetu symbolizes the
ideal world.
Wise Words
The Hetu River map.

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
Does this diagram of an ideal, perfect, and sedentary world remind you of anything?
Perhaps the Before Heaven sequence of trigrams that we discussed in Chapter 7, “The
Principle of the Eight Trigrams”? Although the Hetu diagram was correlated with the tri-
gram sequence in the Song dynasty (960–1279 C.E.), there is much debate about whether
this correlation is meaningful. In fact, some contemporary scholars believe there is no
connection between the Hetu number sequence and the Before Heaven trigram sequence.
So, you might ask, what’s so special about the Hetu diagram? Its link with the turtle’s
offering, the Luoshu diagram.
The Luoshu Writing
A second gift was bestowed on Yu the Great, founder of China’s first dynasty Xia (c. 2100–
1600 B.C.E.) This one was another pattern of black (yin) and white (yang) dots inscribed 
on a turtle’s shell, an arrangement that came to be known as the Luo River Writing. Simply
called the Luoshu (also spelled Lo-shu), this diagram was correlated to the After Heaven
sequence of trigrams (again see Chapter 7 for a reminder) conceivably as early as the Han
dynasty (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.), some 2,000 years after its purported discovery by Yu. As a
reminder, the After Heaven sequence of trigrams denotes motion, transformation, and
interaction of natural and human qi forces. The Luoshu/After Heaven sequence is the
antithesis of the motionless Hetu and Before Heaven sequence of trigrams.
156
The Luo River Writing.

Chapter 13: The Flying Stars, Part 1
We all know these diagrams couldn’t have really appeared on the backs of two animals. So
what’s the real story? The fact is, the origins of the Hetu and Luoshu sequence of numbers
are unknown. Although their antiquity is unquestioned, contemporary scholars can’t prove
the Luoshu existed before the time of Confucius (551–479 B.C.E.). This is because the
Luoshu is first mentioned in the Confucian Analects (sayings of Confucius compiled by his
students). The origin of the Hetu diagram, on the other hand, is a bit more mysterious. 
It isn’t mentioned until the early Han dynasty, some 400 years after Confucius. And, the
configuration of numbers it represents can’t be dated until the Song dynasty (960–1279
C.E.), some 1,000 years later. So, until new discoveries are made, or scholars put forth new
evidence, we will never know the diagrams’ true inventor(s) or date of origin.
Despite the mysterious origins of the Hetu and
Luoshu diagrams, we can surmise they were
a product of astute observations by the
ancients—that they recognized and recorded
patterns made manifest in the celestial heav-
ens, patterns that revealed the secrets of the
universe. The legend of the miraculous
appearance of the Hetu and Luoshu points to
their power. The fact that the ancient
Chinese had forgotten what they meant by
the time scholars began to analyze the dia-
grams increases their mysterious nature.
Nevertheless, because they are considered
magical and because their meanings were 
elusive, they were thought to be divine in 
origin.
The Magic Square of Three
Just as the black (yin) and white (yang) dots of the Hetu correspond to a numeric value,
so, too, do the Luoshu’s dots. Referring back to the illustration of the Luo River Writing,
look at the top configuration of dots: A pattern of 4 black dots and 2 black dots is separated
by a pattern of 9 white dots. Numerically, the dot values equal 4, 9, and 2, respectively—
a factor that is illustrated in the following diagram of the Magic Square of Three. Before
you continue, take a minute to consider how all the other dot patterns correspond to the
numbers in the following illustration.
157
Also known as the Luo
River Writing, the Luoshu is a
pattern of black (yin) and white
(yang) dots said to be inscribed
on a turtle’s shell. The Luoshu cor-
relates to the After Heaven
sequence of trigrams denoting
motion, transformation, and inter-
action of natural and human qi.

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
The Luoshu is also known as the Magic Square of Three. This is because 3 cells add up to
15 along any diagonal, vertical, or horizontal line:
Diagonally
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
2 + 5 + 8 = 15
Vertically
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
Horizontally
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
158
The Magic Square of Three.
The magic doesn’t stop here. Like the After Heaven
trigram sequence, the Luoshu diagram moves, sym-
bolizing a world in flux, in constant transformation.
Although the diagram is square, it is also inherently
cyclic. How so, you ask? First, connect the 2 pairs of
odd (yang) numbers: 1 and 9, and 3 and 7. Next,
draw a line through the 2 northern cells 6 and 1. In
the same fashion, draw lines through the 2 eastern
cells 8 and 3, the 2 southern cells 4 and 9, and the 2
western cells 2 and 7. The end result should look
similar to the following illustration, a counterclock-
wise swastika—each arm connecting the 9 cells 
of the Magic Square.
The Magic Square of
Three is considered magical
because 3 cells along any diag-
onal, vertical, or horizontal line
add up to 15. The Magic Square
of Three represents the numeric
value of the black (yin) and white
(yang) dots of the Luoshu.
Wise Words

Chapter 13: The Flying Stars, Part 1
Notice how the odd (yang) numbers forming the cross and the 4 extending arms of even
(yin) numbers add up to 10: 9 + 1 = 10, 3 + 7 = 10, 4 + 6 = 10, and 2 + 8 = 10. The sums
differ by a factor of 5, the number of the central cell. Impressed? There’s more. Upon closer
examination, you’ll notice that central number 5 is the factor that links the extending pairs:
1 (North) and 6 (Northwest), or 1 + 5 = 6
3 (East) and 8 (Northeast), or 3 + 5 = 8
4 (Southeast) and 9 (South), or 4 + 5 = 9
2 (Southwest) and 7 (West), or 2 + 5 = 7
Finally, you’ll notice these directional pairs are none other than the arms forming the Hetu
cross! This connection suggests the Hetu is probably a by-product of the Luoshu diagram.
You might be wondering why the swastika revolves counterclockwise. This is because 
the clockwise movement expresses passing time, while the counterclockwise movement
expresses future time. Richard Wilhelm in his preface to the I Ching or Book of Changes
(Princeton University Press, 1950) explains it this way: “The usual clockwise movement,
cumulative and expanding as time goes on, determines the events that are passing; an
opposite, backward movement, folding up and contracting as time goes, through which
the seeds of the future take form. To know this movement is to know the future. In fig-
urative terms, if we understand how a tree is contracted into a seed, we understand the
future unfolding of the seed into a tree.”
Feng shui is concerned with predicting the probability of future events. Moreover, feng
shui seeks to promote good events and dissuade bad events.

The Nine Imperial Palaces
The nine cells, or nine “halls,” of the Magic Square describe the layout of the Imperial
Palace in China, what venerated scholar Joseph Needham in Science and Civilization in
China (Cambridge University Press, 1956) calls “the mystical temple-dwelling which the
emperor was supposed to frequent, carrying out the rites appropriate to the season.”
What does this mean exactly? Well, the emperor, the Son of Heaven, petitioned heaven
(composed of a group of his illustrious forebears) on behalf of his people, rendering thanks
and appreciation for fine weather, good health, and prosperity. It was also his duty to ask
heaven to continue its benevolence. Specifically, requests were made for the upcoming
year. Each rite would be carried out in the appropriate hall of the emperor’s palace. Each
hall corresponded to the one of the twelve lunar months. Each lunar month lasted ap-
proximately 291⁄2 days; each lunar year, 360 days.
But there are 9 cells and 12 months. How does this figure? Good question. Basically, it
worked like this. The emperor would live in each of the central rooms (north, south, east,
and west) for one month. Because the corner rooms corresponded to two directions (for
example, southeast = south and east), the emperor would live in these rooms for two

Today, the swastika is a symbol widely associated with anti-Semitism and Hitler’s Third
Reich. But did you know the swastika predates Hitler’s empire of evil? That it is one of
the oldest symbols of humankind? Virtually every ancient culture has a remarkably similar
version of what is generally accepted to be a solar emblem. The swastika has been
used by the indigenous peoples of North, Central, and South America, and the French,
Greek, Swiss, Japanese, and Irish.
However, many scholars believe the swastika was probably first used by the Hindus. In
fact, the word swastika comes from the Sanskrit svastika meaning “lucky” and “fortunate.”
The most distinctly identifiable ancient use of the swastika was by the Jains, a Hindu reli-
gious doctrine closely resembling Buddhism, founded about 500 B.C.E. The Jains used
the symbol as an emblem of Buddha. Always represented with its arms in a counter-
clockwise fashion, the swastika was introduced to China in about 200 B.C.E. The
Chinese called the swastika Lei Wen, meaning “thunder scroll,” a name suggesting it
was a symbol associated with celestial activity.
How did Hitler contaminate such a kindly sign? Actually, the Viennese racial theorist and
founder of the Order of the New Templars, Dr. Jorge Lanz von Liebenfels (a.k.a. Adolf
Lanz), adopted the swastika in 1907. Symbolizing his irrational belief in establishing 
a pure master race, the swastika was probably mistaken by Lanz to be a symbol of
Germanic origin. The clockwise version adopted by Hitler in 1920 was designed by 
a dentist, Dr. Freidrich Krohn.

months. So, during the spring, he would presumably live in the northeast room for one
month, the east room for one month, and the southeast room for one month. In the sum-
mer, he would spend one more month in the southeast room, followed by a month in the
south room, and a month in the southwest room, and so forth. Thus, the emperor was
able to complete a tour of the lunar calendar, cycling around each of the nine halls.
As if this wasn’t enough, the emperor also had to symbolically harmonize with each season’s
distinct affiliations (color, animal, smell, sound, cereal, etc.). For example, in summer, the
emperor donned red garments and feasted on peas and chicken. In autumn, he dressed in
white and ate sesame and dog. In winter, he wore black and ate millet and pork. And, in
spring, the emperor chose green clothing and ate mutton and wheat. Sounds exhausting,
doesn’t it? Such were the duties and obligations of imperial privilege.
Here’s to the Nines
Before we move on to providing step-by-step instructions for performing a Flying Stars
audit, let’s explore for a moment the significance of the number nine, the highest single-
digit number. Interestingly, nine is revered globally, its symbology strikingly similar. It
symbolizes completeness, the end of a cycle before returning to number one. To the
Chinese, the number nine represents heaven and perfection. It is the supreme yang (male)
number. But, that’s not all. Here are a few more examples of how the number nine has
been incorporated into Chinese culture:
◆In early Chinese mythology, the number nine figures often: nine fields of heaven,
nine terraces of the sacred mountain Kunlun, and nine songs of heaven.
◆The Book of Rituals, compiled in the later Han dynasty, speaks of nine ceremonies:
puberty rite for men, wedding, audience, ambassadorship, burial, sacrifice, hospital-
ity, drinking, and military.
◆The center of Peking (now Beijing) has eight roads leading to the collective ninth,
the city.
◆The Forbidden City is said to have 9,999 rooms.
◆Nine dragons are incorporated into the emperor’s throne.
◆Nine mythical animals adorn palace and temple buildings.
◆Many pagodas have nine stories.
The number nine is significant in other cultures, too: In Egypt, nine, or the higher power
of three, was very important to the religious and cosmological order. A group of nine gods
was called a pesedjet, or ennead. Flip back a couple of pages to the illustration of the
swastika formation inside the Magic Square. The cross connecting the odd numbers (1
and 9, 3 and 7), together with the “X” connecting the even numbers (4 and 6, 8 and 2),
forms the 3000 B.C.E. Egyptian hieroglyph for “heaven.”

To the Hebrews, the ninth letter of their alphabet is Tet. Tet symbolizes completeness. At
the next level, the Zadi (90) represents righteousness, and the completeness of the human
spirit. The final Zadi (900) represents the outer world.
In Christianity, hell has nine gates (three of brass, three of iron, and three of adamantine).
Furthermore, the hierarchy of hell is divided into nine sections. Also, there are nine
choirs of angels in heaven. Christ died at the ninth hour.
To the Bahá’í, nine represents culmination, comprehensiveness. In the numerology con-
nected with the Arabic alphabet, nine is the numeric value of the letters making up 
the name “Baha,” the revealer of the Bahá’í faith—considered by its followers to be the
ninth existing independent religion.
Western numerologists believe if the total number of letters in your first name is nine,
you are a person of great talent. You possess global consciousness. 
In sorcery, a magic circle must be nine feet in diameter. Magical formulas generally must
be repeated nine times. The human gestation period is nine months. Cats are said to have
nine lives. We dress to the “nines.” Mathematicians check their calculations by “casting
out nines.” There are nine judges on the Supreme Court, nine players on a baseball team.
Shopkeepers will forever charge $9.99. Finally, who can forget the Beatles’ song,
“Revolution 9”?
Feng Shui and Nine
In feng shui, the nine cells of the Luoshu are connected by the counterclockwise swastika.
Also, the number nine enhances the number it’s combined with, as you shall soon see.
What does this mean? If the number 9 combines with an auspicious number (you’ll learn
all about favorable and unfavorable numbers in the next chapter), expect the possibility of
promotion, financial gain, and happy events. However, if 9 combines with an inauspicious
number, beware! The threat of eye disease, fire, litigation, and insanity is likely.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about the 24 directions and the Chinese concept of time.
Also, we’ll talk more about numbers. Specifically, how they relate to human events, char-
acteristics, and health.

◆Space: the 24 mountains
◆Time: three cycles and nine periods
◆The personalities of the nine stars
◆The ruling number
In this chapter, you’ll learn more about time and space. Here, you’ll learn that
your home corresponds to 1 of 24 directions (space), instead of the 8 you used
in the Eight House method. Also, you’ll understand that the nine “stars” or
numbers of the Luoshu relate to specific periods time. And that, like a person,
each star has a personality that changes over time.
Space: The 24 Mountains
Undeniably, mountains are part of physical reality. They take up space. And,
space is one of the two primary components of classical feng shui, with time
being the other one. In ancient China, the idea was to study not only the
physical features of the terrain (to select the most auspicious site on which 
to build a settlement or bury the dead), but also to evaluate and measure its
magnetic space.

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
As you learned in Part 4, “Feng Shui Mechanics 101,” each of the eight trigrams and their
correlative directions hold a different kind of qi that describe a building’s inherent person-
ality. In Flying Star methodology, the 8 fundamental directions are divided into 3 compo-
nents each for a total of 24 directions (8 trigrams × 3 parts = 24 directions). Called the 
24 mountains, these finer directional distinctions, coupled with the time your home was
constructed, hold a lot of valuable information, as you shall soon learn.
166
The 24 mountains or directions of a luopan compass derive from the 8 funda-
mental trigrams: Each trigram constitutes 45 degrees of the compass (8 trigrams × 45
degrees = 360 degrees). Each trigram is subdivided into 3 equal parts of 15 degrees
each (3 parts × 15 degrees = 45 degrees). The total number of subdivided parts 
(3 parts × 8 trigrams) comprises the 24 mountains, each of which has a Chinese name.
Wise Words
A simplified luopan compass.

Chapter 14: The Flying Stars, Part 2
Referring to the preceding illustration of a simplified loupan compass, let’s take a closer
look. Beginning with the Kan trigram at the bottom, notice that this northern trigram is
divided into three mountains: Ren (north 1) at 337.5 degrees to 352.5 degrees, Zi (north 2)
at 352.5 degrees to 7.5 degrees, and Gui (north 3) at 7.5 degrees to 22.5 degrees. Moving
clockwise around the luopan, the northeastern trigram Gen follows. It’s comprised of
Chou (northeast 1) at 22.5 to 37.5 degrees, Gen (northeast 2) at 37.5 degrees to 52.5
degrees, and Yin (northeast 3) at 52.5 degrees to 67.5 degrees. The 24 mountains and
their magnetic affiliations continue around the luopan in this fashion.
But, why are some mountains black and some white? Simply, the mountains in black are
yang, the white ones yin. We include these designations for sake of completeness.
Do You Know Where Your House Is?
In the system of the Flying Stars, it is not enough to determine to which trigram your
home belongs. Here, we need to be more exact. For example, say your home belongs to
the Zhen trigram. You need to determine what type of Zhen house you have: Jia, Mao, or
Yi. After taking a compass reading (refer to Chapter 11, “The Eight Houses, Part 2,” for a
refresher), say you determine that your home sits at 
87 degrees and 
faces 267
degrees. According to this measurement, your home sits in E2 and faces W2.
Let’s take another example. Say your home belongs to the Qian trigram. According to a
precise compass reading, you find that it sits at 
330 degrees (NW3) and 
faces
150 degrees (SE3). Get the idea?
167
If the compass reading corresponding to your home is on the boundary between
two mountains (at 292.5, 307.5, 322.5, for example), you may want to find a digital
compass that can provide a more precise reading. If the reading is still on the line, then
you cannot proceed. In these cases, there is a special treatment that is beyond the
scope of this book.
Feng Alert
The Luopan Charted
Here’s a charted version (see following table) of the luopan compass. You may find it “eas-
ier on your eye” than the circular representation.
Before we proceed, please determine to which mountain your home sits in and faces
toward. For our purposes, once you have determined to which mountain your home cor-
responds, the magnetic designations are no longer needed. Record your information as
follows:

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
168
Example: My home belongs to the Dui trigram. It sits 
in W2 and faces 
to
ward E2.
My home belongs to the ________ trigram. It sits 
in _____ and faces 
toward
_____.
You have now determined the magnetic space your home occupies. Now, we will need to
link this information with the time your home was constructed.

Chapter 14: The Flying Stars, Part 2
Time: Three Cycles and Nine Periods
To Westerners, the Chinese concept of time may seem very peculiar. Time isn’t linear, 
but spiral-shaped. Following the laws of yin and yang, time repeats itself. Because time
repeats, events are also likely to repeat. This idea is the central premise of the Yijing,
considered the oldest book of divination still in use. Basically, when you ask the oracle 
a question, you are projecting your situation into a time-space model, the Yijing. Since
your situation has occurred before, the Yijing can foretell a probable solution. To learn
more about the Yijing and how you can use it to help you solve a dilemma, concern, or
problem, please see The Complete Idiot’s Guide to the I Ching (Alpha Books, 2001).
Referring to the following table, the largest unit of time consists of 180 years. Called the
Great Cycle (Da Yun), February 4, 1864, marked the beginning of the 180 cycle we are
currently in. The cycle officially ends on February 4, 2044, with the new one beginning
immediately thereafter.
169
The Great Cycle is divided equally into 3 cycles of 60 years each: the Upper Cycle
(1864–1924), the Middle Cycle (1924–1984), and the Lower Cycle (1984–2044). The
Great Cycle is also divided into 9 luck periods composed of 20 years each. Notice that 
the Upper Cycle consists of Period 1
(1864–1884), Period 2 (1884–1904), and
Period 3 (1904–1924). The Middle Cycle
consists of Period 4 (1924–1944), Period 5
(1944–1964), and Period 6 (1964–1984).
Finally, the Lower Cycle consists of Period 7
(1984–2004), Period 8 (2004–2024), and
Period 9 (2024–2044). Can you guess what
period we are now in? If you guessed the sev-
enth 20-year period, you are correct. Period
8 will not begin until February 4, 2004.
Remember, in feng shui
we use the Chinese solar year
that begins variously on February
3, 4, or 5 of each year. This is
because feng shui studies how qi
changes over the year as marked
by the position of the sun on the
ecliptic path.
Feng Alert

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
So, where is all this leading, you ask? The year the construction of your house was com-
pleted determines which 20-year period it was “born into.” For example, if your house
was completed in 1927, it falls in Period 4 of the Great Cycle. If your house was com-
pleted in 1985, then it shares the period we are currently in—Period 7.
The key words here are “construction completed.” This is because construction may have
begun in one year and ended in the next, a factor that becomes especially crucial if the 
20-year period is changing. How can you find out when
your house was built? What if you live in an apartment
complex? No sweat. This information is a phone call
away. The county recorder’s office, the tax assessor’s
office, your building supervisor, or rental office should
be able to help you.
Before we proceed, determine to which 20-year period
your home was built. Record the information here:
My home was built in Period ______.
Now, let’s step back for a minute and talk more about
numbers and their characteristics as they relate to
human events. The idea behind this concept is central
to evaluating your numeric-based Flying Star chart.
It’s All in the Numbers
As you’re coming to learn, numbers express more than their values—they express ideas
and beliefs. And, somehow, nature and humankind conform to this man-made abstraction,
an idea we talked about in Chapter 2, “Western Intellectual Heritage and the Holy Grail.”
In classical feng shui, numbers also express probabilities: the probability an event may
happen within a given time and space. It could be a good event, such as a promotion or
wedding, or a bad event, suggesting misfortune or illness. But how can these events be
determined?
In the West, we’ve learned to determine the outcome of events by applying the laws of
cause and effect. This has been the basis of Western scientific thinking for centuries.
Causality is the name of the game—nothing is left to chance, a very unscientific process.
The Chinese, on the other hand, are concerned with acausal probabilities, chance hap-
penings and coincidences that are connected by seemingly unrelated events. Nature, or
more precisely, the macrocosm, plays a starring role in their acausal theory. They believe
human events aren’t necessarily caused by natural phenomena, only connected in an acausal
relationship. Countless hours through countless centuries were spent correlating acausal
events between the outer world and our well-being. Numbers became a method of recording
and predicting, forming the basis of the Yijing, from which feng shui is partially derived.

A Great Cycle (Da Yun)
lasts 180 years. It is divided 
into three 60-year cycles (Yuan)
called the Upper, Middle, and
Lower Cycles (Shang Yuan,
Zhong Yuan, Xia Yuan). The
Great Cycle is also divided 
into nine 20-year luck periods.
We are currently in Period 7
(1984–2004) of the Lower
Cycle (1984–2044).

Chapter 14: The Flying Stars, Part 2
In Sync with Greater Nature
This acausal connecting principle is actually known as synchronicity, a word coined by
renowned Swiss psychologist Carl Jung (1875–1961). Simply, synchronicity can be
described as a pattern of coincidences in which thoughts, ideas, objects, and events (or a
combination) are linked to form a theme of meaning to the observer(s).
We’ve all experienced synchronicity. For example, we (Elizabeth Moran and Val Biktashev)
experienced a meaningless type of synchronicity, a happening that was more of an oddity
than a life-altering event. Late one night we
were driving home. The street was quiet, the
road was empty, the radio off. Suddenly, at
the same time, we started to sing the same
line from the Elton John song “Goodbye
Yellow Brick Road.” Shocked at this unlikely
incident, we stared at each other. Then, I
(Elizabeth) turned on the radio. Guess what
was playing? We and the radio station were
“in sync.” What’s the probability of this hap-
pening? What caused this striking coinci-
dence? While we won’t get into the “why”
here, we talk at great length about the scien-
tific reasoning behind synchronicity in
Chapter 11 of The Complete Idiot’s Guide to the
I Ching (Alpha Books, 2001).
The Attack on America
Yet, there are synchronistic events that are meaningful to the observer(s). For instance,
take the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York City’s World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, the governmental complex for the Department of Defense, located just out-
side Washington, D.C. A number of seeming unrelated facts came together on this partic-
ular day within a specific space. The synchronicities involve the number 11. They are
downright chilling:
◆The attack occurred on 9/11: 9 + 1 + 1 = 11
◆September 11 marks the two hundred fifty-fourth day of the year: 2 + 5 + 4 = 11.
◆After September 11, 111 days are left in the year.
◆From afar, the Twin Towers (part of the World Trade Center complex) resembled a
gigantic number 11.
◆The first airplane that crashed into the North Tower was American Airlines flight 11.
◆In 1788, New York was the eleventh state to join the Union.
171
Developed by Swiss
psychologist Carl Jung (1875–
1961), synchronicity expresses
the connection of acausal (ran-
dom) events within a limited time
frame. The Chinese believe human
events are linked with nature in an
acausal relationship. Feng shui
seeks to determine probabilities of
synchronistic events within a cer-
tain time period. Numerology is
one method classical feng shui
uses.

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
◆The words “New York City” contain 11 letters.
◆The words “The Pentagon” contain 11 letters.
◆The word “Afghanistan” contains 11 letters.
Pretty amazing, huh? You may wonder what the number
11 means. According to retired Harvard professor
Annemarie Schimmel, as she states in her well-researched
book, The Mystery of Numbers (Oxford University Press,
1993), “Larger than 10 and smaller than 12, it stands
between two very important round numbers and there-
fore, while every other number had at least one positive
aspect, 11 was always interpreted in medieval exegesis
ad malam partem, in a purely negative sense. The 
sixteenth-century numerologist Petrus Bungus went so
far as to claim that 11 ‘has no connection with divine
things, no ladder reaching up to things above, nor any merit.’ He considered it to be the
number of sinners and penance.”
We need not dwell on the symbolic meaning of the number 11 and the extraordinary 
facts linking it with the World Trade Center attack. You can formulate your own conclu-
sion. Here, our point is to illustrate a recent, albeit catastrophic, example of numeric syn-
chronicity.
In classical feng shui, the combination of numbers generated by a Flying Star qi chart
represents synchronistic probabilities. For example, the Chinese recognized that a 2-1
combination was often linked with spousal conflict, separation, or divorce. An 8-9 combi-
nation spawned the likelihood of weddings and pregnancy. A 5-1 combination meant the
probability of ear, kidney, or genital disorders. Get the idea? You’ll be learning more
about interpreting number combinations in later chapters.
A Number Is Worth a Thousand Words
Each number of the Luoshu (please refer to Chapter 13, “The Flying Stars, Part 1,” 
for a reminder) reflects a certain kind of qi. It’s important to understand that numbers,
too, follow the laws of yin and yang. No number can be favorable or unfavorable all the
time. Rather, the auspiciousness of each number is cyclic. But before you learn how to
determine a number’s timeliness, you must first understand the inherent nature of each
number. Remember, we’re talking about the numbers comprising a Flying Star qi map,
which is generated by the period your home was built in along with its magnetic orienta-
tion. Other numbers such as those signifying your birth date, address, age, and the like,
have no significance in feng shui. The following are the nine numbers of the Luoshu and
their innate characteristics.
172
Consider another coincidence
involving the number 11: The
April 19, 1995, explosion dev-
astating the A. P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City,
Okalahoma, happened at 9:02
A.M.: 9 + 2 = 11. The evildoer
behind this tragic event was
Timothy McVeigh. He was exe-
cuted on June 11, 2001. If you
add up the digits to this date,
they total 11: 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 +
0 + 0 + 1 = 11.

In general, the numbers 1, 6, and 8 are considered good-natured and auspicious. The
numbers 2, 3, and 7 are harmful and inauspicious. The number 4 is neutral. The number
5 is best avoided—it shows its power by being sinister, by hurting others.
The Ruler Principle
In the Luoshu, the number 5 occupies the central square of the nine-part grid. It “rules”
the earth. Thus, the number 5 represents the stable matter of earth qi and its gravitational
force, pulling everything toward the center.
Conversely, there’s heaven qi. It moves and changes over time. Each of the nine “stars” or
numbers takes turns to rule heaven. Each star rules for 20 years or for one period. As you
learned earlier on in this chapter, we are now in Period 7, with the number 7 ruling from
1984 to 2004. The ruling star is the most powerful star, followed by the star that is next in
line. Using an analogy, think of number 7 as United States President George W. Bush or
Britain’s Prime Minister Tony Blair. While we don’t yet know who the president/prime
minister elect will be, the stars are more orderly. The successor of number 7 is number 8,
the next ruling star for the time period 2004 to 2024.
What about the immediate past ruler, the number 6 governing 1964 to 1984? Consider
this star like former president Bill Clinton. While he is no longer president, he is still
influential.

Wheel of Fortune
Looking at the following illustration, notice how the life cycle wheel revolves in a coun-
terclockwise fashion: that which rules retires, then dies, only to grow again. Numerically,
7 rules; 6 is retired; 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 are dead; 9 is growing into the apprentice ruler; and 8
is the future ruler.
174
The life cycle of numbers.
To determine the ruling star for the 20-year period beginning on February 4, 2004, simply
turn the wheel one position to the left. The number 8 now rules, and 7 retires. The other
numbers follow suit.
Numbers should be defined in terms of the aging process with their inherent characteris-
tics taken into consideration. For example, the number 1 is inherently a good number
representing fame and fortune. If we let number 1 represent Miss America, her reign
marks the height of her glory. When she has completed her term, she retires. She is still
attractive, but as she ages, she becomes prone to illness and hardship. In other words,
when a star ages and then dies, it no longer has the strength to help you.

In Sickness and in Health: The Timeliness of the Stars
How does each number individually embody a ruling, retired, dead, or apprentice/future
ruler star? Consult the following table. Pertaining to Period 7 (1984–2004), take the num-
ber 1. An inherently favorable number, it is currently dead. In its death cycle, the number
1 has been known to cause marital troubles. Referring to the illustration of the life cycle,
you’ll see that number 1 will “rise” from the dead and become the apprentice future ruler
in 2004, when number 8 becomes the ruler. During its productive years, the number 1
promotes wisdom, fame, and fortune. Let’s take the number 7. Currently, it’s the ruling
star. Referring to the chart, when the number 7 is in its ruling or apprentice/future ruler
cycle, it ushers in the possibility of greater financial success and fertility. However, begin-
ning on February 4, 2004, it retires. It exhibits both its good and bad qualities (just like
the number 6 does during Period 7).
175
We suggest placing a paper clip on this page. Until you have memorized each number’s
inherent nature and life cycles, you’ll be referring to this table often.
In this chapter, you’ve determined the two most important factors that will generate a
numeric qi pattern of your home—the magnetic orientation (space) and the period (time)
it was born into. In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to “fly” the stars, to create the
numeric qi pattern.

Flying Star is a very challenging system. It’s a bit technical so we suggest you
undertake this chapter and successive ones regarding the mechanics of the
Flying Star system only when you are energetic, clearheaded, and free of time
constraints. An alert mind, a positive attitude, and an insatiable curiosity are
all it takes to advance toward more sophisticated feng shui techniques.
Do Stars Fly?
To fly a star means to move numbers around the nine cells of the Luoshu in a
specific sequence. What you’re actually doing here is calculating the move-
ment of qi; determining the qi pattern made manifest by the building’s con-
struction date (time) and its magnetic orientation (space). So, instead of
saying, “I’ll run the numbers,” you say, “I’ll fly the numbers.” In doing so,
you’ll sound cool using feng shui lingo!
Chapter

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
Flying Stars!
In the last chapter, you learned about the Chinese concept of time—that the construction
year of your home relates to a specific 20-year period. For example, if your home was
completed in 1985, it belongs to Period 7 (1984–2004), the cycle we’re currently in. If
your home was completed in 1950, it belongs to Period 5 (1944–1964). Whatever period
your home belongs to is the number that represents the star that ruled when your home
was “born.” In other words, if your home was built between 1984 and 2004 (Period 7),
the number 7 prevailed; it ruled heaven’s qi.
Also called the time star, the ruling or period number is placed in the central palace of the
nine-part Luoshu grid. In an ascending manner, the other numbers will fill the remaining
eight cells by following a precise directional sequence: NW, W, NE, S, N, SW, E, SE.
For example, let’s take a house built during Period 4 (1924–1944). Placing the time star
number 4 in the center, the other numbers “fly” as shown in the figures following.
178
Example of flying the time
star for a house built in
Period 4. Note: While tech-
nically, the Luoshu diagram
is a square configuration, we
have rounded the diagram to
match the circular Hou Tian
(After Heaven) sequence to
which the Luoshu numbers
are correlated.

Chapter 15: The Flying Stars, Part 3
Next, you must check your work. An easy way to determine if the numbers have been
flown correctly is to check the number in the last, or southeast cell. If it precedes the
number in the center palace, there should be no mistake. In this example, the number 3 is
in the southeast cell. Three precedes four.
Flying the Stars
As the saying goes, “Practice makes perfect.” To fully comprehend Flying Star, it’s best
that you take an active role. Participate. Be proactive and not passive. What follows are
eight empty charts (representing Period 2 through Period 9) for you to complete. At this
stage, the directions corresponding to your home’s sitting and facing sides are not a con-
sideration. This aspect comes into play later on in this chapter. Here, we’re only con-
cerned with your dwelling’s construction date. To give you a head start, we’ve filled out
the first chart (Period 1) for you. Remember, the sequence is:
Center, NW, W, NE, S, N, SW, E, SE
179

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
That wasn’t so difficult, was it? Did you remember to check the southeast cell? Does the
number in this cell precede that which is in the center palace? See. What seemed compli-
cated is, in fact, simple—a piece of cake, a walk in the park.
Constructing a Flying Star Chart
You’ve just completed step one of constructing a Flying Star chart, manifesting the heaven
or time qi governing your home. Now, things get more complicated.
Step two is to calculate the house’s qi pattern, which relates to its magnetic space. Let’s
take a house built in Period 7, sitting N1 and facing S1. Referring to the following illus-
tration of House 1, the star (or number) corresponding to the sitting direction (number 3)
is copied and moved to the top, left side of the central palace. This star is called the sitting
star. Next, the facing star, the number corresponding to the dwelling’s facing direction, is
copied and moved to the top, right side of the central palace. In this example, number 2
represents the facing star.
Let’s take another example. House 2 represents a dwelling built in Period 4, sitting SW2
and facing NE2. As indicated, the sitting star 1 is copied and moved to the top, left side of
the central palace. The facing star 7 is copied and moved to the top, right side of the cen-
tral palace.
Finally, one more example. House 3 represents a dwelling built in Period 1, sitting E1 and
facing W1. Here, the sitting star 8 is copied and moved to the top, left side of the central
palace. The facing star 3 is copied and moved to the top, right side of the central palace.
Using the preceding empty chart (My House), fly the time star (period or ruling star)
affiliated with your own home. Then, transfer the sitting and facing stars to their appro-
priate positions in the central palace.
180
The time star (period star) is the number that ruled when your house was built.
The sitting star (zuo xing) is the number that corresponds to your dwelling’s sitting direc-
tion. The facing star (xiang xing) is the number that corresponds to your dwelling’s fac-
ing direction. These numbers “fly” to the top left and top right of the central palace,
respectively. The sitting star is also called the mountain star (shan xing) or people star
(ding xing). The facing star is also called the water star (shui xing) or money star (cai
xing).

Flying Forward, Flying Backward
Step three requires you to fly the sitting and facing stars either forward (just like you did
for the time star) or backward. Logically, if flying forward (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) means
the numbers ascend, then flying backward (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) means the numbers
descend while following the directional sequence (center, NW, W, NE, S, N, SW, E, SE).
Whether the sitting and facing star flies forward or backward depends on two factors:
◆If the star in question is odd or even.
◆If the mountain the house sits in and faces toward is the first, second, or third
mountain of the trigram in question.
181
After you have determined 
to which period your home
belongs, the next step is to
transfer the sitting and fac-
ing stars to the left and right
sides of the central cell respec-
tively. The empty chart is for
you to record the information
appropriate to your own
home.

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
Now, following the five rules below, determine if the sitting and facing stars in the center
palace fly forward or backward:
Rule 1: If your house sits in and faces toward the first mountain (N1 to S1; NE1 to
SW1; E1 to W1, for example) and if the sitting or facing star is odd (except the
number 5), then the star in question flies forward.
Rule 2: If your house sits in and faces toward the first mountain (N1 to S1; NE1 to
SW1; E1 to W1, for example) and if the sitting or facing star is even, then the star
in question flies backward.
Rule 3: If your house sits in and faces toward the second or third mountains (N2 to
S2; N3 to S3; W2 to E2; W3 to E3, for example) and if the sitting or facing star is
odd (except the number 5), then the star in question flies backward.
Rule 4: If your house sits in and faces toward the second or third mountains (N2 to
S2; N3 to S3; W2 to E2; W3 to E3, for example) and if the sitting or facing star is
even, then the star in question flies forward.
Rule 5: The number 5 flies forward or backward according to whether the ruling
star in the center palace is odd or even. In other words, if the ruling star is 1, 3, 7,
or 9, the number 5 in the sitting or facing position flies according to rule 1 or 
rule 3. If the ruling star is 2, 4, 6, or 8, the number 5 in the sitting or facing position
flies according to rule 2 or rule 4.
Referring to the following examples, let’s look at House 1. Built in Period 7, it sits N1
and faces S1. According to Rule 1, the sitting star 3 (located in the top, left position of the
central cell) flies forward: 3 (center), 4 (NW), 5 (W), 6 (NE), 7 (S), 8 (N), 9 (SW), 1 (E),
and 2 (SE). According to Rule 2, the facing star 2 (located in the top, right position of the
central cell) flies backward: 2 (center), 1 (NW), 9 (W), 8 (NE), 7 (S), 6 (N), 5 (SW), 4 (E),
and 3 (SE). Referring to House 2, it sits N3 and faces S3. According to Rule 3, the sitting
star 3 flies backward. According to Rule 4, the facing star 2 flies forward. Get the idea?
182
According to Rule 1, the sit-
ting star 3 flies forward.
According to Rule 2, the fac-
ing star 2 flies backward.

Chapter 15: The Flying Stars, Part 3
183
According to Rule 3, the sit-
ting star 3 flies backward.
According to Rule 4, the fac-
ing star 2 flies forward.
Another method similar to Xuankong Feixing (Time and Space Flying Stars), which
we present here, is called Zibai Feigong or Purple-White Flying Palace. Basically,
this technique flies the Luoshu number that correlates to your dwelling’s sitting trigram
and then compares the eight other numbers to the central one. Dating to the Ming
dynasty (1368–1644), the system is also called Zibai Jiuxing or Purple-White Nine
Stars. Why purple-white? Because each number is associated with a color. The colors
white (1, 6, 8) and purple (9) are considered auspicious numbers. Since the colors
were used as mnemonics to aid learning, we will not discuss the Zibai Feigong 
colors, which are not related to the five phase colors.
Master Class
More Flying Forward, More Flying Backward
To facilitate learning, let’s review this intricate procedure one more time. House 3 (fol-
lowing) sits at W2 and faces E2. It was built in 1950. Take this time now to fly the stars.
To help you, check off each task as you complete it:
❏Using the sitting 
and facing 
symbols, notate the directional orientation of
the dwelling. 
❏Determine the 20-year period the home was constructed in. Consult Chapter 14,
“The Flying Stars, Part 2,” for a reminder. Write this number (the time star) in the
central palace.
Now, it’s your turn. Take this time to complete your chart (My House) by flying the sit-
ting and facing stars in the central cell.

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
❏Fly the time star forward. Remember, the
directional sequence is: Center, NW, W,
NE, S, N, SW, E, SE.
❏Copy and move the sitting star to the top,
left side of the central palace. Copy and
move the facing star to the top, right side
of the central palace.
❏Refer to the five rules to determine if the
sitting and facing stars fly forward or back-
ward. Fly the stars.
So, how did you do? Compare your result to the
answer at the end of the chapter.
Charted Floor Plan
Let’s not lose sight of the fact that the nine numeric cells represent the qi distribution
coming from the eight cardinal directions, with the central palace representing the home’s
innate essence. Once you have created a Flying Star chart appropriate to your home, you
must overlay the numeric qi map onto your floor plan. Divide the home into eight equal
wedges, with the sitting side at the bottom of the page and the facing side at the top of
the page. (More information about dividing a home using the 24 mountains is available 
in Appendix E, “Learn More About Taking a Proper Compass Reading Using the 24
Mountains.”) For instance, Figure 1 shows a house constructed in Period 6, sitting NW2
and facing SE2. To orient the house such that the sitting side is flush with the bottom of
the page, rotate the diagram one position clockwise. By doing this, you will avoid having
to analyze your home on an angle.
184
Orient your home so that the
sitting side corresponds to the
bottom of the page.

Chapter 15: The Flying Stars, Part 3
185
You may want to flip forward to Part 6,
“Practical Application,” to get a better idea
about how a home is divided. You’ll notice that
the central palace is not an area, but a mere dot
representing a dwelling’s inherent personality.
We’ll be discussing this notion in more detail later
on. Also, take care not to run dividing lines
through the floor plan. The walls are the real
dividing lines. Again, the idea is not to compart-
mentalize your home into distinct sections (like in
Life Aspirations and Black Sect methodology), but
to study how qi coming from the eight directions affects the whole of your living and/or
working space. This will become clearer as you progress through the case studies in
Chapters 18, “The Flying Stars, Part 6,” 19, “A House Hunting We Will Go,” and 20,
“Does Your Office Measure Up?”
Great Charts!
We stated in Chapter 1, “What Is Feng Shui?” that there are 216 types of houses. How
did we come to this conclusion? There are 24 mountains x 9 periods = 216. If you found
that flying the stars is a laborious task, don’t fear—we’ve done all the work for you. In
fact, we’ve even oriented the charts so that the sitting is at the bottom of the page and the
facing is at the top of the page. All you need to do is look up the chart corresponding to
your home! First, find the period in which your house was constructed. Then, find the
chart correlating to its sitting direction.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how the position of the sitting and facing stars affects the
auspiciousness of a house.
“The so-called internal qi does
not come from within. It is actu-
ally the qi that flows from out-
side.”

century feng shui master in his
annotation of Qing Nang Jing.

Now that you’ve assembled a Flying Star chart appropriate to your home, it’s
time to begin interpreting the patterns of numbers that relate to your wealth,
health, and relationships. In this chapter, you’ll learn that your home may
have special characteristics, a type of personality that can favorably or unfa-
vorably affect the quality of your health and livelihood.
Yin and Yang, Mountain and Water
As you learned in Chapter 5, “The Principle of Yin and Yang,” yin and yang
are two dynamic and opposing forces of nature. The premise of feng shui is 
to study how these qi forces affect the quality of your health, livelihood, and
relations with other people.
In Flying Star methodology, yin qi and everything it represents is expressed 
as the mountain force, the qi force that oversees a person’s health and relation-
ships. If you think about it, this idea makes perfect sense. Yin qi, associated
Chapter

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
with the female, is nurturing. Yin qi is quiet, restful, still, and stable—qualities encourag-
ing rejuvenation, a peaceful spirit, and harmonious interaction with other people. Like a
mother’s yearning to protect her children, yin qi or mountain qi, shields its inhabitants
from strong winds and harsh rains. Without this protective shield, you are prone to sick-
ness and subject to arguments and disagreements.
While the landscape surrounding your house is certainly an important consideration in a
feng shui evaluation, in your home the walls are the mountains that govern your health.
The walls not only contain valuable qi, but they also allow yin qi coming from the eight
fundamental directions to penetrate through them, infusing the occupants with its essence.
We’ll be talking more about this idea in the next chapter.
216
Associated with yin, the mountain force administers a person’s health and
relationships. Its qi enters a home through the walls, the building’s mountainlike structures
protecting the occupants. Associated with yang, the water force governs a person’s wealth.
Its qi enters a home through the windows and doors, the building’s free-flowing water-
like edifices. In classical feng shui terminology, the mountain star is synonymous with
the sitting star and the stars on the top, left side of each cell. The water star is synony-
mous with the facing star and the stars on the top, right side of each cell.
Wise Words
Conversely, yang qi governs a person’s wealth. Associated with the male, yang qi is equated
with the water force. It’s on the move. Like the streams, rivers, and seas, water qi nourishes
the soil, bringing life to vegetation. Water is also an effective mode of transport. Indeed,
before the advent of airplanes, societies were economically dependent on the flowing sub-
stance to help foster the exchange of goods and services. Likewise, while watercourses and
streetways (virtual watercourses) are important factors in an accurate feng shui assessment,
in Flying Star methodology, water qi is that which flows into your dwelling through win-
dows and doors. Again, this idea will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter.
For now, understand that the mountain force is embodied in the mountain star, which is
identical to the sitting star (the number affiliated with the sitting direction of your home)
and all of the other stars (numbers) occupying the top, left side of each cell. On the other
hand, the water force is embodied in the water star, which is identical to the facing star
(the number affiliated with the facing direction of your home) and all of the other stars
occupying the top, right side of each cell. To be perfectly clear, the mountain stars govern
your health and relationships; the water stars govern your finances.

Chapter 16: The Flying Stars, Part 4
Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water
As of this writing, we are in Period 7 with the number 7 ruling from February 4, 1984, to
February 3, 2004. You learned in Chapter 14, “The Flying Stars, Part 2,” that the ruling
star reigns supreme. It is the king star, the president, and prime minister. It rules over all
other stars for a 20-year period. The ruling star is timely, bestowing its auspicious charac-
teristics onto its subjects, the occupants.
When a ruling mountain star is located in the top, left position of the sitting cell and a
ruling water star is located in the top, right position of the facing cell (the mountain and
water positions respectively), it is most fortunate. This type of house is called Fortunate
Mountain Fortunate Water or Wang Shan Wang Shui, in Chinese. Basically, it means the
occupants have the highest probability of attaining good fortune, good health, and beneficial
relationships. They have a leg up, if you will. To illustrate this idea, look at the following
figures. House 1 represents a Zhen dwelling constructed in Period 7, sitting E2 and facing
W2. House 2 represents a Gen dwelling constructed in Period 8, sitting NE1 and facing
SW1. Both houses are Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water. (We have oriented the
charts so that the sitting side corresponds to the bottom of the page.)
217
Examples of Fortunate
Water Fortunate Mountain
dwellings for Period 7
(House 1) and Period 8
(House 2).
However, regardless of the auspicious positions of the mountain and water stars in the sit-
ting and facing cells, the stars must be supported environmentally. A mountain or a man-
made “mountain” such as a building, tall hedge, or forest must support the ruling mountain
star in the sitting or back side of the dwelling. A watercourse (ocean, river, swimming
pool, fountain, for example), or a virtual waterway like a road, must support the water star

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
in the facing or front side of the dwelling. How close should these supporting structures
be to the house so that it still qualifies as Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water? The gen-
eral rule of thumb is that the supporting structure must be in eyesight distance. You must
“feel” its essence. For most urban dwellers these factors are easily satisfied. But, what if the
converse is true? What if a body of water is located on the sitting or back side and a
mountain is located on the facing side or front side of the dwelling? In this case, the house
is not considered Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water. It loses its special quality, its leg up.
218
In Chinese, a Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water dwelling is considered
Wang Shan Wang Shui if the ruling mountain and water numbers are in their proper
places. The ruling mountain star must be situated in the top, left position of the sitting
cell. The ruling water star must be situated in the top, right position of the facing cell.
This type of house is most favorable, bringing the highest possibility of fame, fortune,
and good health.
Wise Words
When Period 8 arrives on February 4, 2004, and the ruling star 7 leaves office, star charts
with the Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water configuration are rendered invalid. The
house no longer possesses that extra edge, that something special because the ruling
mountain star 8 is not at the sitting and the ruling water star 8 is not at the facing.
Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water houses built in Period 7 (February 4, 1984–
February 3, 2004) include the Zhen houses sitting E2 and E3; the Xun house sitting
SE1; the Kun house sitting SW1; the Dui houses sitting W2 and W3; and the Qian
house sitting NW1. Fortunate Mountain Fortunate Water houses built in Period 8
(February 4, 2004–February 3, 2024) include the Gen house sitting NE1; the Xun
houses sitting NE2 and NE3; and the Qian houses sitting NW2 and NW3.
Master Class
Reversed Mountain and Water
When the ruling mountain and ruling water star in question (the number 7 for Period 7
or the number 8 for Period 8, for example) are improperly placed, then the star chart is
called Reversed Mountain and Water. It is most unfortunate. Stated another way, if the ruling
water star (governing wealth) is located on the mountain (top, left) side of the sitting cell
and the ruling mountain star (governing health and relationships) is located on the water
(top, right) side of the facing cell, the house is potentially less fortunate in wealth and
health for the 20-year period.

Chapter 16: The Flying Stars, Part 4
Simply, the stars are misaligned. Mountain’s yin force is preventing your finances from
growing and water’s yang force is causing a whirlwind of heightened activity resulting 
in anxiety, sleeplessness, and illness. Like living in close proximity to a freeway, the over-
abundance of yang qi embodied by the heavy traffic can wear you out.
Here are examples of Reversed Mountain and Water houses. House 1 was built in Period 7.
It sits W1 and faces E1. House 2 was built in Period 8 and sits SE1 and faces NW1.
219
In Chinese, a Reversed Mountain and Water dwelling is considered Shang
Shan Xia Shui if the mountain and water stars are improperly placed, reversed. Here,
the ruling mountain star is improperly located in the facing cell. The ruling water star is
improperly located in the sitting cell. A Reversed Mountain and Water star chart brings
the probability of misfortune and illness for the 20-year period to which the ruling star
corresponds.

Can anything be done to remedy the dire prospects? Yes! In this case, a mountain or
mountainlike structure (tall hedge, forest, building) must support the misaligned mountain
star on the facing or front side of the dwelling. Likewise, a body of water or a roadway
must support the misaligned water star on the sitting or back side of the dwelling.
When Period 8 arrives on February 4, 2004, and the ruling star 7 leaves office, star-crossed
charts are relieved from their hazardous duties. The havoc they wreak is thwarted.

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
The Double Facing Star Chart
When both the ruling mountain and the ruling water stars are located in the facing cell,
the chart is called Double Ruling Star at Facing or Shuang Ling Xing Dou Xiang, in Chinese.
In this case, the ruling water star (governing wealth) situated in the top, right side of the
facing cell is in its proper place. Because of this, the house inspires financial gain. However,
the ruling mountain star (governing health and relationships) is improperly placed. Here,
it is located in the yang or facing side of the dwelling. Because of the misalignment, the
house brings the likelihood of poor health and difficult relationships.
Here are examples of Double Facing star charts. House 1 was built in Period 7, sitting
SW2 and facing NE2. House 2 was built in Period 8, sitting W1 and facing E1.
220
Reversed Mountain and Water houses built in Period 7 (February 4, 1984–February
3, 2004) include the Zhen house sitting E1; the Xun houses sitting SE2 and SE3; 
the Dui house sitting W1; and the Qian houses sitting NW2 and NW3. Reversed
Mountain and Water houses built in Period 8 (February 4, 2004–February 3, 2024)
include the Gen houses sitting NE2 and NE3; the Xun house sitting SE1; the Kun
houses sitting SW2 and SW3; and the Qian house sitting NW1.
Master Class

Chapter 16: The Flying Stars, Part 4
To remedy a Double Facing situation, a body
of water or virtual water like a roadway must
support the facing or front side of the dwelling.
The facing side must also contain a mountain
or a man-made “mountain” structure such as
a tall hedge or building to support the mis-
aligned mountain star. That which exists at
the sitting or backside of the dwelling is not
considered.
When Period 8 arrives on February 4, 2004,
and the ruling star 7 leaves office, the charts
of houses conforming to a Double Facing
configuration are rendered invalid.
The Double Sitting Star Chart
When both the ruling mountain and the ruling water stars are located in the sitting cell,
the star chart is called Double Ruling Star at Sitting or Shuang Ling Xing Dou Zuo, in
Chinese. In this case, the ruling mountain star (governing health and relationships) situ-
ated in the top, left side of the sitting cell is in its proper place. Because of this auspicious
orientation, the house inspires robust health and productive relations with other people.
However, the ruling water star (governing wealth) is improperly placed. Here, it is located
in the yin or sitting side of the dwelling. Because of the misalignment, the house brings
the probability of money loss.
Here are examples of Double Sitting star charts. House 1 was built in Period 7, sitting N2
and facing S2. House 2 was built in Period 8, sitting E1 and facing W1.
221
In Chinese, a Double
Ruling Star at Facing is consid-
ered Shuang Ling Xing Dou Xiang
if both the ruling mountain and
ruling water stars are located in
the facing cell. In this case, it is
easy for the occupants to make
and retain money, but it is diffi-
cult for them to form stable rela-
tionships and maintain good
health.

To remedy a Double Sitting situation, a mountain or a man-made “mountain” such as a
tall hedge or building must support the sitting or back side of the dwelling. The sitting
side must also contain a body of water or a roadway to support the misaligned water star.
That which exists at the facing or front side of the dwelling is irrelevant.
When Period 8 arrives on February 4, 2004, and the ruling star 7 leaves office, charts of
houses conforming to a Double Sitting configuration are rendered invalid.
222
It’s important to understand that the four types of houses described in this
chapter are only valid if the period the house was constructed in matches the ruling
period. For example, take a house constructed in Period 4 (1924–1944). Even if the
number configurations conform to a Fortunate Mountain and Water, Reversed Mountain
and Water, Double Facing, or Double Sitting situation, the house wouldn’t qualify as
one of the four special cases until Period 4 arrives again in the year 2104.

health, and beneficial relationships.
The Mountain, Water, and Time Stars
Before you proceed with understanding and remedying the number combina-
tions, let’s take a moment to fully comprehend the three stars comprising each
cell—the mountain, water, and time stars:
◆The Water Star. Governing wealth, the water star is located on the top,
right side of each cell. If your home conforms to one of the four special
cases discussed in the previous chapter, follow the advice to activate the
Chapter

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
ruling star for the chart in question. If your home does not belong to one of the four
special cases, locate the ruling water number in your chart (the number 7 for Period 7
or the number 8 for Period 8). Support the star environmentally, allowing the yang qi
essence of the nearby water/roadway to flow into the house through an open window
or door. Use the space containing the ruling money star for a home office—any area
where you conduct money-related business.
Regarding the remaining nonruling money stars, timely stars (the numbers 9, 8, and
7 for Period 7; the numbers 1, 9, and 8 for Period 8) located only in active areas can
bolster financial gain. Because of their negative characteristics, untimely (retired/
dead) stars (the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 for Period 7; the numbers 7, 6, 5, 4, 3,
and 2 for Period 8) cannot foster wealth. Diminish an untimely water star’s negative
aspects by keeping the windows and doors closed in the area in question, at least
during the night. Also, as you’ll soon learn, employ a five-phase remedy to ward off
an unfavorable projection.
224
In an active (yang) area within a home (family room, home office, kitchen), focus on
the water star and how it reacts with the mountain star. If the time star is productive
to or belongs to the same phase as the water star, the possibility of financial gain is
even greater. In an inactive (yin) area (bedroom, guest bedroom, living room), focus
on the mountain star and how it reacts with the water star. If the time star is productive
to or belongs to the same phase as the mountain star, the probability of good health
increases. Why not remedy the entire dwelling for wealth? Because poor health leads
to a poor financial outlook! Remember, feng shui is about balancing the yin and yang
qi forces.
Master Class
◆The Mountain Star. Governing health and relationships, the mountain star is
located on the top, left side of each cell. If your home conforms to one of the four
special cases discussed in the previous chapter, follow the advice to activate the
mountain star for the chart in question. If your home does not belong to one of the
four special cases, locate the ruling mountain number in your chart (the number 7
for Period 7 or the number 8 for Period 8). Support the star, allowing the yin qi
essence of the nearby mountain/building to enter the house by infusing and charging
the walls. Windows should be kept closed, particularly if the water (yang) star is not
favorable. If the water star is favorable, make sure the wind does not disperse yin’s
(health and relationship) qi. Use the space containing the ruling health and relationship
star for your bedroom and other areas promoting rest and relaxation.

Chapter 17: The Flying Stars, Part 5
Regarding the remaining nonruling mountain stars, timely stars (the numbers 9, 8,
and 7 for Period 7; the numbers 1, 9, and 8 for Period 8) located only in inactive
areas can foster good health and beneficial relationships. Because of their negative
characteristics, untimely (retired/dead) stars (the numbers 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 for
Period 7; the numbers 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 for Period 8) cannot bolster your health
and relations. In this case, diminish an untimely mountain star’s inauspicious aspects
by employing a five-phase remedy.
◆The Time Star. The time star provides a base for the mountain and water stars.
Using an analogy, the water star is like steak, the protein fortifying your strength
and determination to succeed. The mountain star is like a vegetable, the vitamins
nourishing your health. The time star is the plate on which your dinner is served. You
do not eat the plate, do you? Yet, the plate must be clean and beautiful otherwise you
cannot enjoy the meal. While the time star itself does not foster fortune or misfor-
tune, it either supports or does not support the water and mountain star. It depends
on the phase (fire, earth, metal, water, and wood) relationship between the time star
and the mountain star, and the time star and the water star. If the relationship is
productive, the water or mountain star in question is enhanced. If the time star 
controls or reduces the water or mountain star’s power, the star in question loses 
its zeal.
Before you proceed, it’s a good idea to have the Flying Star chart corresponding to your
home in front of you.
225
Flying Star is about balancing the mountain (yin) and water (yang) forces. External 
to a house, there are mountains, buildings, rivers, lakes, and streets. Inside a house,
there are also mountains and waterways. Walls and large furniture are interior moun-
tains. Doors, windows, and hallways are interior watercourses. When activating a
yang area for wealth, keep windows open and make sure the hallways are unob-
structed. When activating a yin area for health and relationships, make sure the qi is
not dispersed by wind. High-back chairs and a bed with its headboard against a solid
wall are ways to make good use of a timely mountain star.
Master Class
The Central Palace
Now that you understand more thoroughly what the water and mountain stars represent
and how you can use them to your advantage, let’s take a look at the central palace. A feng
shui assessment begins here. Heaven’s qi (associated with the time the dwelling was “born”
into) and earth’s qi (associated with the magnetic orientation of the building) merge to

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
produce a house with a specific type of personality made manifest by the numbers in 
the central palace. When the sitting (mountain) and facing (water) stars are compatible,
chances are the innate essence fosters harmony. However, when the sitting and facing
stars conflict, chances are the innate essence fosters discord. Because the central palace does
not represent an area, the stars here cannot be balanced with one of the five phases of qi.
Great care must be taken, then, to balance the stars comprising the surrounding eight cells.
226
Don’t forget to consider the exterior and interior environment. What can be
done to allow qi to flow productively, easily, and uninhibited? Consult Chapter 8,
“Turtles, Tigers, and Dragons, Oh My: Evaluating Your Environment,” and Chapter 9,
“Home Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings,” about assessing the
surrounding terrain, the lot on which your house sits, the alignment of roads and water-
courses, and the orientation of furniture.

It’s All in the Stars: The Star Combination Chart
The following number combinations reflect the possibility that the favorable or unfavorable
event in question may occur if proper remedies/enhancements are not installed. As you
become more familiar with each number combination, you’ll notice that some combina-
tions contain both good and bad aspects. You may be wondering, then, how to promote
the good and dissuade the bad? While space doesn’t permit us to get into a detailed analysis
of the number combinations, remember that timely stars bring out the good characteristics
and untimely stars bring out the bad ones. A general rule of thumb is to enhance timely
stars and weaken untimely stars. You may want to review Chapter 14, “The Flying Stars,
Part 2,” about the characteristics of untimely and timely stars. The following effects are
valid for the Lower Cycle (1984–2044).

A Simple Analysis
Considering only the stars, let’s examine a Flying Star chart for a Dui house built in
Period 7, sitting W2 and facing E2. We’ll begin with the central palace, then move up to
the facing cell, and travel clockwise around the chart. Note: M stands for mountain star;
W for water star; and T for time star.
232
Center: 9M (fire) 5W (earth) 7T (metal)
Fire produces earth. Although a productive relationship, it is not a healthy one. Here, 
the number 9 is not only encouraging the highly inauspicious number 5’s proclivity for
misfortune, but it is also melting the ruling star 7’s benevolence. (Remember, the number
9 enhances any number it’s paired with.) While the numbers comprising the central palace
cannot cause fortune or misfortune, they represent the innate nature of the dwelling. In
this case, it is inharmonious, causing the possibility of financial and health hazards.
East: 2M (earth) 7W (metal) 5T (earth)
Earth produces metal. Because this is the facing and yang side of the dwelling, it is 
appropriate to focus on the money star 7. It is advantageous to have the main entrance

Chapter 17: The Flying Stars, Part 5
here. Make sure there is a body of water (a fountain, river, roadway) outside to support
number 7. Inside, metal will bolster 7’s prospects for financial gain and lessen the negative
affects brought on by the innate evil numbers 2 and 5. Be mindful of abdominal and mouth-
related disorders.
Southeast: 1M (water) 6W (metal) 6T (metal)
Metal produces water. This is a productive combination heralding prospects for promotion
and career success. Thus, no remedy is needed. However, the stress associated with more
responsibility may cause an abundance of nervousness. This is because the number 1’s
water is draining the 6’s energy, a number associated with the head.
South: 5M (earth) 1W (water) 2T (earth)
Earth blocks water. This is a controlling relationship, with the combination bringing the
possibility of ear-, kidney-, and genital-related disorders. Moving metal (a chiming clock
with a metal pendulum or playing the piano) is needed here to thwart the occurrence of an
ailment. Metal will reduce the affects of the untimely and inherently inauspicious numbers 2
and 5. Metal will bridge earth and water, reverting the cycle to a productive one. Since the
water (wealth) star is also untimely, this area should be avoided.
Southwest: 3M (wood) 8W (earth) 4T (wood)
Wood burdens earth. The highly favorable
number 8 is located on the water or wealth
side, making this area terrific for a home
office. To increase the chance for financial
success, install a fire remedy here to connect
the wood and earth phases. Doing so will dis-
courage wood from depleting 8’s auspicious
nature. The possibility of limb injuries for a
child makes this area unsuitable for a play-
room or child’s bedroom.
West: 7M (metal) 3W (wood) 9T (fire)
Metal pierces wood. Because this is the sitting
and yin side of the dwelling, it is appropriate
to focus on the mountain star 7. This area is
suitable for a bedroom. Outside, make sure a
mountain or a building supports the sitting star. Inside, the number 9 is melting metal’s
favorable nature. To remedy the possibility of robbery and legal entanglements, earth is
needed to restore the cycle to a productive one: wood produces fire, fire produces earth,
earth produces metal.
233
Don’t forget to consider how each
number affects parts of the body.
As a reminder, here are the 
number/body correlations: 
1) ears, blood, kidneys; 2)
abdomen, stomach; 3) feet,
lower leg; 4) thighs, buttocks,
lower back; 5) N/A; 6) head,
lungs; 7) mouth, teeth, tongue,
chest; 8) hands, fingers; 9) eyes,
heart. A disorder arises only if the
number in question is untimely or
if it is being attacked by another
phase.
Feng Facts

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
Northwest: 8M (earth) 4W (wood) 8T (earth)
Wood burdens earth. The advantageous number 8 is situated on the mountain (health and
relationships) side, making the area favorable for a bedroom. To thwart possible spousal
affairs (brought on by the untimely number 4), install the fire phase to revert the cycle to
a productive one. The combination is unfavorable for young children.
North: 4M (wood) 9W (fire) 3T (wood)
Wood produces fire. The auspicious combination 4-9 is known as “fire makes wood glowing
and glamorous.” In other words, fire brightens 4’s romantic nature, making the area good
for a bedroom (particularly for a couple seeking a pregnancy). Because 9 is a timely money
star, the area also makes a favorable home office. No remedy is needed. 
Northeast: 6M (metal) 2W (earth) 1T (water)
Earth produces metal. Although this is a productive relationship, metal is needed to sup-
press the unfavorable and untimely number 2’s promotion of illness and money loss.
Metal will also strengthen 6’s inherently auspicious quality of bringing authority and
fame, which is being corroded by the time (water) star.
Conclusion: Although the dwelling’s innate personality is inharmonious, there are several
favorable star combinations that, if properly remedied, can offset the inauspicious combi-
nation in the central palace. The areas that should be actively used and which inspire
financial gain are the east, southeast, southwest, and north. The areas promoting good
health and good relations are located in the west, north, northwest, and northeast. In this
case, the south is an inauspicious area.
Take this time now to evaluate and remedy the eight cells comprising your living and/or
working space. However, things may change when we add the annual star. This is the 
subject of the next chapter.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Begin a feng shui assessment by studying the numbers comprising the central
palace. They represent the dwelling’s inherent essence.
◆Locate the areas containing the ruling and timely water (wealth) stars. If needed,
remedy or enhance the area in question with one of the five phases to increase the
possibility of financial success.
◆Locate the areas containing the ruling and timely mountain (health and relationship)
stars. If needed, remedy or enhance the area in question with one of the five phases
to ensure good health and beneficial relations with other people.
◆A Flying Star chart must be supported by the proper forms (mountains, buildings,
water, and the like) outside.

◆Learning how the annual star affects the mountain, water, and time stars
This is the final chapter about the Flying Star system. Here, you’ll receive the
last piece of the puzzle—the annual star. Once you’ve incorporated the annual
star into your chart, you can fully evaluate your chart to create a productive
atmosphere fostering better well-being.
The Annual Star
Each year, the nine heavenly stars visit earth. One of the stars is the leader and
is stationed in the central palace along with the mountain, water, and time stars
governing the chart. Who’s the leader of the annual stars? The nine stars take
turns being leader, with the term of office being one solar year beginning vari-
ously on the third, fourth, or fifth day of February. Because there are nine stars,
it takes nine years to complete a cycle. The cycle we’re currently in began in the
year 2000, with the number 9 as leader. In 2001, the leader is the number 8.
In 2002, the leader is the number 7. The other numbers follow suit in a de-
scending order. 
Chapter

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
To determine the annual star for any particular year, there’s a simple formula:
1. Add up all the digits for the year in question. For example, let’s calculate the annual
star for 2009: 2 + 0 + 0 + 9 = 11.
2. Add the resulting number until you get a single-digit number. Continuing with our
example: 1 + 1 = 2.
3. Subtract the resulting number from 11. The answer is the annual star number. In the
case of 2009, 11 – 2 = 9.
Let’s calculate another year. How about 2004?
2 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 6
11 – 6 = 5
The number 5 is the annual star for 2004.
Get the idea? What star prevailed during your birth
year?

Feng Facts

Chapter 18: The Flying Stars, Part 6
Flying the Annual Star
The annual star, or number, flies in exactly the same manner as the time star (the period
star). It flies forward, the ascending numbers filling the remaining eight cells by following
the directional sequence: NW, W, NE, S, N, SW, E, SE. 
When a star occupies the central palace, it’s less influential than the other stars because it’s
“locked” or “imprisoned” in the chart. However, if the design of the house leaves the center
open (if there’s an atrium, patio, or courtyard in the center, for example), then the numbers
are freed. The heaven qi from the facing palace (the water star) will positively or negatively
affect the numbers situated in the facing cell and the heaven qi from the sitting palace (the
mountain star) will positively or negatively affect the numbers situated in the sitting cell. 
As a visiting star, there are three ways an annual star can affect a house:
◆An annual star can act on its own to affect the relationship between the mountain,
water, and time stars in question. If an annual star is timely, it will affect the area
positively. If the annual star is untimely, it will affect the area negatively.
◆An annual star can activate a combination (mountain-water, mountain-time, water-
time) if the phase it’s correlated with produces the phase attached to the mountain
or time star in question. 
◆An annual star can activate a combination (mountain-water, mountain-time, water-
time) if the number is the same as the mountain or the time star in question. In this
case, the annual star assists the mountain and/or time star. 
We will demonstrate this idea by carrying over the example from the previous chapter of
the house built in Period 7, sitting W2 and facing E2. If you’re uncertain about the rela-
tionship between the phases and to which number each phases corresponds, it’s a good
idea to use the illustration on the front of the tear-out card for a handy reminder. 
The Annual Star for 2002
Beginning in the central palace, moving up to the facing cell, and traveling clockwise
around the chart, let’s take a look at how the annual star affects the other stars. Again, 
M stands for mountain star, W for water star, T for time star, and A for annual star. 
The number in bold adjacent to the time star corresponds to the annual star.
237

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
Center: 9M (fire) 5W (earth) 7T (metal) 7A (metal)
Fire (9M) produces earth (5W). Although a productive relationship, it is not a healthy one.
Here, the number 9 is not only encouraging the highly inauspicious number 5’s proclivity
for misfortune, it is also melting the ruling star 7’s benevolence. While the numbers com-
prising the central cell cannot cause fortune or misfortune, they represent the innate nature
of the dwelling. In this case, it is inharmonious. In this example, the 7 annual star, which
just happens to be the same as the auspicious ruling star 7, is a good omen. While its
influence is minimal within the confines of the central cell, the annual 7 can help lessen
5’s unfavorable effect. 
East: 2M (earth) 7W (metal) 5T (earth) 5A (earth)
Earth (2M) produces metal (7W). In the last chapter, we determined that metal is needed
to strengthen the money star 7’s likelihood of fostering financial gain. Metal will also
reduce 2 and 5, the innately evil star’s propensity for misfortune and illness. The addition of
another 5 makes matters worse because it activates the 2M-7W and 2M-5T combinations.
More metal is needed in the area in question.
Southeast: 1M (water) 6W (metal) 6T (metal) 6A (metal)
Metal (6W) produces water (1M). This is a productive combination heralding the possi-
bility of promotion and career success. Thus, no remedy is needed. However, the stress
associated with more responsibility may cause an abundance of nervousness. This is
because 1’s water is draining 6’s energy, a number associated with the head. The annual 6
(an inherently auspicious number) activates the 1M-6W and 6W-6T combinations. Again,
a remedy is not needed this year. Annual 6 will only enhance the positive prospects.

and how it relates to a Dui
house built in Period 7, 
sitting W2 and facing E2.

Chapter 18: The Flying Stars, Part 6
South: 5M (earth) 1W (water) 2T (earth) 2A (earth)
Earth (5M) blocks water (1W). This is a controlling relationship, the combination bring-
ing the probability of ear-, kidney-, and genital-related disorders. In the last chapter, we
determined moving metal is needed here to thwart the untimely and inherently inauspi-
cious numbers 2 and 5. Also, metal will bridge earth and water, reverting the cycle to a
productive one. The annual 2 activates the 5M-2T and 1W-2T combinations. More metal
is needed here.
Southwest: 3M (wood) 8W (earth) 4T (wood) 4A (wood)
Wood (3M) burdens earth (8W). The highly favorable number 8 is located on the water
or wealth side. To increase the chance for financial success, install a fire remedy here to
connect the wood and earth phases. The visiting 4 activates the 3M-4T and 8W-4T com-
binations, effectively hurting or depleting earth’s auspicious power. More fire is needed here.
West: 7M (metal) 3W (wood) 9T (fire) 9A (fire)
Metal (7M) pierces wood (3W). In the last chapter, we determined earth was needed to
diminish the possibility of robbery and legal entanglements. Earth would restore the cycle
to a productive one: wood produces fire, fire produces earth, earth produces metal. However,
the annual 9 makes the 7M-9T combination brighter. While a person’s recognition and
money prospects may flourish, the probability of fire also increases. Earth will diminish
fire’s intensity. Avoid using red, purple, or pink in this area. While water colors such as
blue or black will help cool things down, you must not use real water here. This is because
water will drown the ruling mountain star 7. 
Northwest: 8M (earth) 4W (wood) 8T (earth) 8A (earth)
Wood (4W) burdens earth (8M). Because the advantageous number 8 is situated on the
mountain (health and relationships) side, we must thwart the possibility of spousal affairs
(brought on by the untimely number 4) by installing the fire phase. Fire will revert the
cycle to a productive one. The annual 8 (an inherently auspicious number) activates the
8M-8T relationship, ushering in the strong possibility of good fortune and good health.
Fire (a red décor, for example) will only heighten the favorable prospects.
North: 4M (wood) 9W (fire) 3T (wood) 3A (wood)
Wood (4M) produces fire (9W). In the previous chapter, we determined that a remedy is
not needed because 9’s fire would intensify 4’s romantic nature, making the area good for
a couple seeking a pregnancy. Because 9 is a timely money star, the area also makes a
favorable home office. The annual 3 activates all three combinations. With the additional
wood, the fire phase is needed to keep the flame burning. 
239

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
Northeast: 6M (metal) 2W (earth) 1T (water) 1A (water)
Earth (2W) produces metal (6M). Although this is a productive relationship, in the previous
chapter we determined metal is needed to suppress the unfavorable and untimely number
2’s promotion of illness and money loss. Metal will also strengthen 6’s inherently auspicious
quality of bringing authority and fame, which is being corroded by the time (water) star.
While the annual 1 will not activate the 6M-2W combination, it will activate the 6M-1T
and 2W-1T combinations. Metal is still needed to strengthen the innately favorable numbers
6 and 1 and to weaken the innately unfavorable 2.
Conclusion: In 2002, the only area the annual star affects is the West sector where the 
visiting star’s fire makes things too intense. Now, let’s see how the annual star 6 for the
year 2003 affects the same home.
The Annual Star for 2003
Beginning in the central palace, moving up to the facing cell, and traveling clockwise
around the chart, let’s take a look at how the annual star affects the other stars. Again, 
M stands for mountain star, W for water star, T for time star, and A for annual star. 
The numbers in bold adjacent to the time star corresponds to the annual star.

house built in Period 7, 
sitting W2 and facing E2.

Chapter 18: The Flying Stars, Part 6
Center: 9M (fire) 5W (earth) 7T (metal) 6A (metal)
Fire (9M) produces earth (5W). Although a productive relationship, it is not a healthy
one. The number 9 is not only encouraging the highly inauspicious number 5’s penchant
for misfortune, it is also melting the ruling star 7’s benevolence. While the numbers com-
prising the central cell cannot cause fortune or misfortune, they represent the innate nature
of the dwelling. In this case, it’s inharmonious. For 2003, the annual 6 star does not activate
a combination. On its own, its affect is minimal. Here, 6 will help diminish 5’s unfavorable
aspects (metal reduces earth).
East: 2M (earth) 7W (metal) 5T (earth) 4A (wood)
Earth (2M) produces metal (7W). Metal is needed to strengthen the money star 7’s likeli-
hood of monetary gain. Metal will also reduce 2 and 5, the innately evil star’s propensity
for misfortune and illness. The annual star 4 doesn’t active a combination. Thus, 4’s wood
will act on its own, bringing the possibility of sexual entanglements. Metal will help chop
some of the untimely 4’s wood. 
Southeast: 1M (water) 6W (metal) 6T (metal) 5A (earth)
Metal (6W) produces water (1M). This is a productive combination fostering the likelihood
of promotion and career success. No remedy is needed. However, the stress associated
with more responsibility may be accompanied by a nervous breakdown. This is because 1’s
water is draining 6’s energy, a number associated with the head. The visiting and evil-natured
5 activates the 1M-6W and 6W-6T combinations. This year, metal is needed to lessen 5’s
ugly disposition and bolter 6’s favorable, but weakened influence.
South: 5M (earth) 1W (water) 2T (earth) 1A (water)
Earth (5M) blocks water (1W). This is a controlling relationship, the combination bring-
ing the possibility of ear-, kidney-, and genital-related disorders. Moving metal is needed
here to thwart the untimely and inherently inauspicious numbers 2 and 5. Also, metal will
connect earth and water, reverting the cycle to a productive one. The annual 1 activates
the 5M-1W and 1W-2T combinations. More metal is needed here to revert these cycles
to productive ones.
Southwest: 3M (wood) 8W (earth) 4T (wood) 3A (wood)
Wood (3M) burdens earth (8W). The highly favorable number 8 is located on the water
or wealth side. To increase the chance for financial achievement, install a fire remedy to
connect the wood and earth phases. The visiting 3 activates the 3M-8W and 3M-4T com-
binations, effectively depleting earth’s auspicious power. Fire is needed here this year, too.
West: 7M (metal) 3W (wood) 9T (fire) 8A (earth)
Metal (7M) pierces wood (3W). Although water would restore the phase balance, you can-
not put a ruling mountain star in water. Therefore, add earth to diminish the possibility of
robbery and lawsuits. Earth will also restore the cycle to a productive one: wood produces
241

Part 5: Feng Shui Mechanics 201
fire, fire produces earth, earth produces metal. The visiting 8 activates the 7M-3W com-
bination only. 
Northwest: 8M (earth) 4W (wood) 8T (earth) 7A (metal)
Wood (4W) burdens earth (8M). The advantageous number 8 is situated on the mountain
(health and relationships) side. Fire will thwart the possibility of spousal affairs (brought
on by the untimely number 4) and revert the cycle to a productive one. The annual 7
doesn’t activate a combination. Thus, it will act on its own. Because it’s still the ruling
star, it will help positive prospects materialize. 
North: North: 4M (wood) 9W (fire) 3T (wood) 2A (earth)
Wood (4M) produces fire (9W). A remedy is not needed here because 9’s fire would
intensify 4’s romantic nature, making the area good for a couple seeking a pregnancy.
Because 9 is a timely money star, the area also makes an auspicious home office. The
annual and evil-natured 2 doesn’t activate a combination. Thus, it will act on its own to
bring sickness. Install metal to mitigate its nasty effects.
Northeast: 6M (metal) 2W (earth) 1T (water) 9A (fire)
Earth (2W) produces metal (6M). Although this is a productive relationship, metal is
needed to suppress the unfavorable and untimely number 2’s promotion of illness and
money loss. Metal will also strengthen 6’s inherently auspicious quality of bringing
authority and fame, which is being corroded by the time (water) star. While the annual 9
doesn’t activate a combination, it does enhance the numbers it’s with. Enhancing 2’s 
evilness must be thwarted. More metal is need in this area this year.
Conclusion: In 2003, things change in the southeast and north sections. While a remedy was
not needed in 2002, metal is needed in the southeast. Metal also replaces fire in the north.
Okay, feng shui enthusiasts, go to it! You now have all the tools. You understand how to
use them. Take this time now to review your own chart. Implement the appropriate five-
phase remedy to balance your dwelling’s qi.
In the next part, we’ll present three case studies to help facilitate your comprehension of
Flying Star.
The Least You Need to Know
◆The annual stars change each year beginning variously on the third, fourth, or fifth
of February.
◆The annual star’s reign lasts for one solar year.
◆The annual star can activate a combination by sharing the same number as the
mountain or water star or by producing the mountain or water phase in question.

A House Hunting We Will Go
In This Chapter
◆Choosing a house
◆Incorporating elements of the Eight House system
◆Using Flying Star to remedy/enhance the dwelling’s qi
If buying your first house is stressful, the process of looking for a house is
even worse. Unlike shopping for a car where you can rent a contender for a
weekend, try it out, and get to know the car’s design features and flaws before
plunking down your hard-earned savings, shopping for a house often doesn’t
present such luxuries. In this chapter, we won’t be checking for leaks, cracks,
or termites. We won’t be checking on your neighbors or the school system.
We’ll be checking the qi, determining the auspiciousness of the house, inside
and out, before making a purchase.
Doing Your Homework
The search for a house begins at home. Before you scrutinize the Open House
listings, you must determine what type of house suits you. We’re not talking
about a ranch, colonial, or Mediterranean-type house. We’re referring to the
house’s essence, the compatibility of its qi to yours. Let’s take an example.
Alex, a lawyer, and his wife Anna, a part-time librarian, are looking for their
Chapter

Part 6: Practical Application
dream home. Having saved $50,000 for a down payment, they don’t want to make a mis-
take. After all, it’s probably the biggest investment they’ll ever make. To help find a house
best suited to them, the couple uses the Eight House and Flying Star systems. Let’s see
what they did.
Putting Your Best Direction Forward
The first step toward finding the right house is determining to which set of East or West
Group trigrams you belong. The next step is to determine your four favorable and four
unfavorable directions. 
246
Both Alex (Xun) and Anna (Kan) belong to the East Group set of trigrams. They are F1
to each other (please consult the following chart that’s also used to determine a person’s
compatibility with a particular type of dwelling), their relationship representing the high-
est level of compatibility. Alex’s best directions are north (F1), east (F2), south (F3), and

Chapter 19: A House Hunting We WillGo
southeast (F4). Anna’s best directions are southeast (F1), south (F2), east (F3), and north
(F4). Based on their compatibility criteria, they can now narrow the field to look for only
those houses belonging to the East Group: Zhen, Xun, Kan, and Li. Furthermore, they
know the East Group house best suited to them should have … 
◆An entrance located at their F1, F2, F3, F4 directions.
◆An auspicious bedroom.
◆A favorable wall where their bed can be positioned.
◆A productive office for Alex.
◆A favorable wall where Alex’s desk can be positioned.
There are four East Group dwellings. Is there a way to ascertain which of the four is best?
Absolutely.
Homeward Bound
Referring to the following table, here’s how the couple is compatible with the four East
Group houses:
247

Part 6: Practical Application
To facilitate easier learning, their compatibility with the Zhen, Xun, Kan, and Li house is
as follows:
◆Zhen House: F2, Alex; F3, Anna 
◆Xun House: F4, Alex; F1, Anna 
◆Kan House: F1, Alex; F4, Anna 
◆Li House: F3, Alex; F2, Anna
While Alex and Anna would benefit from all four East Group houses, ideally, they should
try to find a house favoring Alex. This is because he is the breadwinner, providing the pri-
mary source of income. Therefore, the couple should look for a Kan house (F1 for Alex),
followed by a Zhen (F2 for Alex), Li (F3 for Alex), and Xun house (F4 for Alex). If, on the
other hand, Anna supplied the main source of income, they would look for a Xun house,
followed by a Li house, Zhen house, and Kan house. 
248
What if you and your spouse belong to opposite East/West Groups? Which party
should the house favor? It depends on the situation. If one person has or is more 
susceptible to health problems, find a house favoring that person. If a woman plans
to start a family, the house should support her well-being. If children are not a factor
and both people are healthy, choose a house supporting the breadwinner.
Master Class
There’s No Place Like Home
Of course, environmental factors must be considered even before stepping foot inside a
prospective dwelling. There’s no point in examining closet space if the house rests on a
steep slope, an inauspicious-shaped lot, or is the object of sha qi (refer to Chapter 8, “Turtles,
Tigers, and Dragons, Oh My: Evaluating Your Environment,” and Chapter 9, “Home
Sweet Home: Evaluating Your House and Its Surroundings,” for a reminder of these neg-
ative influences). Move on. Don’t waste your valuable time. The external environment is
just as important as the internal space. Say this 10 times before you fall in love with the
house on the hill enveloped by potentially cancerous electromagnetic fields emitted by the
power plant next door.
So, did Alex and Anna find their dream home? Well, they found two identical side-by-side
Kan houses within a new community. Because the dwellings are situated on a curved street,
they aren’t perfectly aligned. They are situated at 30 degree angles from one another.

Chapter 19: A House Hunting We WillGo 249
Two identical Kan houses
built in Period 7 and 
oriented at 30 degree angles
from each other. House A sits
N1 and faces S1; House B
sits N3 and faces S3. 

Part 6: Practical Application
Built in Period 7 (anytime from February 4, 1984 to February 3, 2004), Kan house A sits
N1 and faces S1 at 165 degrees. It’s a Double Facing house because the ruling mountain
(health and relationships) and water (wealth) stars (7) are located in the facing cell.
According to what you’ve learned in Chapter 16, “The Flying Stars, Part 4,” until Period
7 ends, it’s easy for the occupants to make and retain money, but it’s difficult for them to
form stable relationships and maintain good health. To rectify the misaligned position of
the ruling mountain star (which should be located on the left side of the sitting cell), a
mountain or a man-made mountain such as a building or tall hedge must support the ruling
mountain star at the facing or front side of the dwelling. The facing side must also support
the properly placed ruling water or money star. A body of water or virtual water such as a
roadway will ensure the likelihood of increased wealth. In this case, the opposing dwelling
serves as the mountain remedy (not illustrated). While the street serves as the water en-
hancement, it’s also a good idea to install a fountain, pond, or lawn sprinklers.
250
Remember, your dwelling only conforms to a Fortunate Mountain Fortunate
Water, Reversed Mountain and Water, Double Facing, or Double Sitting situation if the
period it was built in matches the period we are currently in. For example, take a Kan
house built in Period 6 (1964–1984) sitting N2 and facing S2. While the number
configuration conforms to a Double Facing scheme, it has lost its quality as a Double
Facing dwelling because the period number (6) does not match the current period num-
ber (7 until February 3, 2004; 8 from February 4, 2004 to February 3, 2024). The
Period 6 Double Facing dwelling will be activated only when Period 6 arrives again in
the year 2144. 
Feng Alert
Also built in Period 7, Kan house B sits N3 and faces S3 at 195 degrees. It’s a Double
Sitting house because the ruling mountain (health and relationships) and water (wealth)
stars (7) are located in the sitting cell. According to what you’ve learned in Chapter 16,
until Period 7 ends, it’s easy for the occupants to form stable relationships and maintain
good health, but it’s difficult for them to retain and make money. To rectify the improp-
erly placed ruling water star (which should be located on the right side of the facing cell),
a body of water or virtual water like a roadway must support the star at the sitting or back
side of the dwelling. A swimming pool, fountain, or koi pond in the backyard would do
nicely. To ensure the probability of good health, a mountain or a man-made mountain
such as a building or tall hedge must support the ruling mountain star at the sitting side. In
this case, let’s assume a tall hedge separates the property from the one it backs up against.

Chapter 19: A House Hunting We WillGo
Side-by-Side, Qi-by-Qi
So, which house should Alex and Anna choose? Let’s run the numbers and compare the
two dwellings. Until they select which home best suits them, we’ll leave out the time star
in this cursory evaluation.
251
When Period 7 is over on February 3, 2004, the number 8 will become the ruling
star. Activate the 8 money star with water and the 8 people star with a mountain.
So, if you installed a fountain in the east to correspond with the 7 money star, move
it to where the money 8 star is located. If it’s impossible to place forms outside the
house, use them inside (if you live in an apartment, for example). Although the effect
isn’t as powerful as an exterior form, it is satisfactory. 
Master Class
A side-by-side comparison of
the qi distribution for Kan
houses A and B.
For a preliminary check, first study the numbers occupying the entrances, master bedroom,
and office. The remaining rooms are not as important. Thus, it isn’t necessary to scrutinize
them at this early stage. Referring to the previous table, let’s concentrate on the rooms
that count!
◆Main Entrance: Auspicious for both homes during Period 7. Regarding House A,
when Period 8 arrives on February 4, 2004, the ruling number 7 retires. When it
leaves office, the innately inauspicious star’s untimely characteristics bring the threat
of fire, theft, and casualties. Regarding House B, it boasts two inherently auspicious

Part 6: Practical Application
numbers 8 and 6. Bringing authority and respect, when Period 8 comes, the number
8 is advantageously located on the mountain (health and relationships) side of the
entrance. It must be supported environmentally by a mountain, building, tall hedge,
or forest to increase the likelihood of good relations and robust health.
◆Patio Entrance: Auspicious for both homes during Period 7. Regarding House A,
the 8M-6W combination is favorable, especially when Period 8 arrives. The occu-
pants must take care not to dissipate the mountain star’s (health and relationships)
yin energy. Ideally, the patio door on the left side of the double door, as well as the
outside doors located in the master bedroom, should be kept closed (at least at
night) to allow the auspicious yin qi to permeate the dwelling by infusing the walls.
Regarding House B, the back entrance is only usable during Period 7. For reasons
that were explained above, the number 7 becomes untimely and problematic. 
◆Master Bedroom: For House A, the 6M-8W combination is extremely favorable,
especially in Period 8 where the number 8 is located on the water or money side. To
take advantage of the ruling money star, support it environmentally by leaving the
window open. Doing so will allow the yang essence of the driveway to flow into the
dwelling, increasing the probability of financial gain. This area can double as an
office, too. Regarding House B, the numbers aren’t as favorable, with a 9M-5W
bringing the possibility of financial and health hazards due to impulsive behavior.
Not a great place for a bedroom.
◆Guest Bedroom/Office: Considering that Alex is
a lawyer, House A’s 2M-3W combination (conflict,
litigation) may be favorable, the area increasing his
skill in devising arguments and rebuttals. That said,
he would be better off working in the master bed-
room, where the qi is much more favorable. House
B, on the other hand, contains a benevolent com-
bination, with 4M-1W being a great place for a
writer, artist, or a person looking to find romance.
This area makes a fine bedroom or office. 
All things considered, Alex and Anna decide on Kan
house A. Although the main entrance will become
inauspicious in Period 8, they’ll use the back entrance
more frequently anyway. This is because a pathway
leads directly from the garage to either the master bed-
room or patio door. 
252
Remember, when as-
sessing number configurations
you must consider the position 
of the numbers, where they are
located within the dwelling, the
number’s innate nature, whether
it’s timely or not (and the charac-
teristics each embodies), and
what happens when numbers 
are paired with other numbers.
For a reminder about these
aspects, consult Chapter 14,
“The Flying Stars, Part 2,” and
Chapter 17, “The Flying Stars,
Part 5.”

Chapter 19: A House Hunting We WillGo
The Analysis
Alex and Anna use Flying Star methodology to remedy and enhance the stars in their new
home. Beginning in the center, moving up to the facing cell, then traveling clockwise
around the floor plan, let’s examine the number combinations:
Center: 3M (wood) 2W (earth) 7T (metal)
Wood controls earth. Innately, the qi for the entire home carries an inauspicious force
fostering conflict, lawsuits, gossip, and accidents. Great care must be taken to properly
balance all areas to mitigate misfortune. 
South Main Entrance: 7M (metal) 7W (metal) 2T (earth)
Metal assists metal. A great area for an entrance, bedroom, or office for Period 7. Although
a remedy is not needed now, when Period 8 arrives, add water to lessen 7’s untimely quali-
ties, which are being encouraged by the time star (earth produces metal). A table fountain
would work nicely here.
Southwest Kitchen: 9M (fire) 5W (earth) 4T (wood)
Fire produces earth. Although a productive relationship, it is not a healthy one. Here, the
number 9 is empowering the highly inauspicious number 5’s propensity for misfortune.
Moreover, the wood time star is adding fuel to the fire (literally), increasing the likelihood
for financial and health hazards. Because this is the kitchen, an inherently “hot” place,
moving metal is needed to thwart impending threats (metal reduces earth). A chiming
clock will do the trick. 
West Dining Room: 5M (earth) 9W (fire) 9T (fire)
Fire produces earth. An inauspicious scenario described above. In fact, the situation is worse
here because the number 9 (represented by both the water and time stars) enhances any
number it’s with. Again, moving metal is preferable. A chiming clock, a piano that is played,
metal statuary, table bases, and the like, will help diminish unfavorable prospects.
Northwest Living Room: 4M (wood) 1W (water) 8T (earth)
Water produces wood. This is a productive relationship fostering creativity, writing, and
romance. While a remedy is not needed, water will strengthen the inherently favorable
number 1 that is being controlled by the earth time star. Since the living and dining rooms
are one space, water will also help quench the raging fire in the dining area. A table fountain
or an aquarium will work nicely. This is a good area for Anna (a librarian) to read and write.
North Patio Entrance: 8M (earth) 6W (metal) 3T (wood)
Earth produces metal. While the combination brings authority, be mindful of the inher-
ently good, but untimely number 6. Because 6 is the money star located in an entrance, it
becomes the focus. During Period 7, 6’s favorable (authority and dignity) and unfavorable
253

Part 6: Practical Application
(loneliness and lawsuits) aspects manifest. The remedy is to bridge the wood time star and
the earth mountain star with fire. Thus, the sequence will be balanced: wood-fire-earth-
metal. Fire will keep the untimely number 6 in check (fire controls metal) and support the
mountain star (fire produces earth) at the same time. Yet, too much fire will brighten 6’s
unfavorable qualities. A small rug inside the entryway with warm tones or a small red 
decorative object will do. When Period 8 arrives on February 4, 2004, the 8 mountain
star must be supported by a mountain, tall hedge, or fence, to bring good health and 
beneficial relationships. 
Northeast Master Bedroom: 6M (metal) 8W (earth) 1T (water)
Earth produces metal. Described above, the only difference here is how the time star
affects the mountain-water combination. In this case, water is corroding 6’s innately aus-
picious, but untimely qualities. With more responsibility due to increased authority and
possible promotion, the couple may suffer from stress and headaches. Remedy with a little
fire. It will enhance the auspicious money star and control the mountain star’s negative
aspects. When Period 8 arrives, keep the window open during the day. Doing so will
allow the yang qi essence of the driveway (not illustrated) to increase the likelihood of
better financial prospects. At night, the 6 mountain star will charge the walls, bringing
possible career advancement. Regarding bed placement, they should position it against
the eastern wall (as illustrated). For Alex, east corresponds to his F2 qi; for Anna, her F3
qi. The bedroom door should be closed while they sleep. Alex should also consider using
this room as an office. They should orient the desk toward the east, his F2 qi. 
East Bathroom: 1M (water) 4W (wood) 5T (earth)
Water produces wood. A productive relationship fostering creativity, writing, and romance.
They should install metal to connect earth (5) to water (1) to wood (4). While you may
think to add water to promote the favorable possibilities, water will actually activate the
untimely number 4 known to bring inappropriate romances! A metal-framed mirror
and/or bathroom accessories will do the job.
Southeast Office: 2M (earth) 3W (wood) 6T (metal)
Wood controls earth. This is an unlucky relationship coupling two inherently inauspicious
numbers. Adding a little fire will restore balance to the cycle (wood-fire-earth). However,
the remedy causes a side effect by enhancing the sickness-provoking star 2 (fire produces
earth). The reductive phase metal is needed to weaken the mountain star (metal reduces
earth). Metal filing cabinets, statuary, picture frames, and the like, are suggestions. Yet,
because of the destructive nature of both the mountain and water stars, the remedies will
not transform the room to a good one. It’s best that Alex and Anna avoid this room, rele-
gating it to a storage area or guest bedroom. Alex would be better off installing a desk in
the master bedroom. If however, he needed the southeast room as an office, he may bene-
fit from the propensity of arguments triggered by the 2M-3W combination. With his desk
facing east (F2), he could harness the area’s qi to help him devise appeals and rebuttals.
254

Chapter 19: A House Hunting We WillGo
Conclusion: Overall, Alex and Anna have selected a fine home. As you’re learning, no
home can be completely good or completely bad. Following the concept of yin and yang,
in one there’s always the hint of the other! Of course, before installing the remedies, the
couple must consider how the annual star affects the star combinations.
In the next chapter, we’ll examine an office.
The Least You Need to Know
◆First determine the type of East or West Group house most compatible with your qi.
◆If the surrounding environmental factors are favorable, examine the stars in the
entrances, bedroom, and office. Consider purchasing or renting the space only if
they’re favorable.
◆Remedy or enhance the qi in each section of the dwelling.
◆Use the Eight House system to determine your most auspicious directions. Place
your bed and desk accordingly.

Does Your Office Measure Up?
In This Chapter
◆Gaining a competitive edge is easier than you think
◆Reorganizing your office space
◆Incorporating Eight House and Flying Star methodology
Whether you own a large corporation or a small business, your primary goal
is to generate revenue. Yet, to do this, you must first create a welcoming and
comfortable working environment: a place where employees will be driven to
succeed and that encourages camaraderie and teamwork. Often, we set aside
this notion, viewing the design and layout factors as incidental and low priority.
In this chapter, you’ll understand how quite the opposite is true—promoting 
a harmonious environment is an essential consideration, a positively golden
means to a lucrative end.
Labor Pains
Mr. Smith owns and operates a small insurance agency. He has nine full-time
employees on his payroll: five sales associates, one accountant, two secretaries,
and a receptionist. All are paid competitive salaries. After six months of service,
each is eligible to participate in a retirement program and receive medical and
dental benefits. Also, Mr. Smith rewards each member of his staff with a three-
week paid vacation per year. He reimburses accrued sick days not taken at the
Chapter

Part 6: Practical Application
end of the year. He provides holiday parties, tickets to sporting events, and other niceties.
By most company standards, Mr. Smith offers a very generous package.
So why is his staff listless? Why is Mr. Smith himself sluggish? Why must he mediate fre-
quent arguments? Why, despite all the incentives, is his staff unmotivated and unhappy?
Desperate and frustrated, Mr. Smith seeks your advice.
First Things First
Even before you can determine favorable directions and appropriate remedies, you must
first walk around the outside of Mr. Smith’s facility. Determine the building’s sitting direc-
tion. Take a compass reading. Evaluate the environment. In this case, there are no external
factors influencing the owner and his staff. Now, go inside. Scope it out. Draw up a simple
floor plan and divide it into eight equal sections. Ask yourself if the layout, in some measure,
is responsible for poor performance and troublesome relations.

Chapter 20: Does Your Office Measure Up?
Disregarding the numeric qi map for the moment, focus on the floor plan. Upon entering
through the eastern main entrance, you are greeted by a receptionist. Is there a problem
here? Well, as you learned in Chapter 8, “Turtles, Tigers, and Dragons, Oh My: Evaluating
Your Environment,” you should not sit directly opposite a door. Here, the receptionist is
subjected to a surge of qi hitting her each time the door opens. But take a closer look.
The wall in back of the receptionist, formed by two adjoined cubicles, prevents qi from
circulating throughout the interior. No wonder Mr. Smith and his staff feel stagnant and
tired. They aren’t being nourished by life’s breath.
Furthermore, the eight cubicles are set up so that the desks face each other. Even though
the cubicle walls offer the staff privacy, they still, in effect, are “in each other’s face.” Also,
is it good feng shui to sit with your back exposed to a doorway? Of course not! Plus, despite
the close proximity, the staff is dissuaded from
interacting with each other, with their cubicle
entrances on opposing sides of the room.
These factors could quite possibly contribute
to the bickering and tension.
Regarding the western areas of the business,
Mr. Smith’s desk is seemingly situated in 
an advantageous position against an unob-
structed wall (we’ll examine this later). The
back entrance, adjacent to the employee
parking lot, opens into a tidy restroom/
kitchen area. The conference room? It holds
a proportionate oval table and chairs.
Let’s Get Compatible
Wow! There’s much to consider. Where do you begin? First determine Mr. Smith’s innate
compatibility with his building. Based on this information, examine the auspiciousness of
the entrances. Then determine the owner’s and employee’s best directions. Because you’ll
be using Flying Star, don’t don your work gloves until a conclusion has been reached.
Dui Have a Match?
Born on April 2, 1948, Mr. Smith belongs to the Dui and West Group set of trigrams. His
west-sitting building also corresponds to Dui. An exact match, Mr. Smith and his structure
are compatible. Referring to the following table, you’ll find that a Dui person living or
working in a Dui building benefits from F4 qi’s peace and stability.
259
It is not favorable to 
sit with your back exposed to 
a door. You are subjected to a
surge of qi, which can cause a
lack of concentration, unproduc-
tivity, and illness. This position
offers only unfavorable psycho-
logical and physical effects.
Ideally, your back, like your
home, must be supported by a
wall or a mountain.
Feng Alert

Part 6: Practical Application
If Mr. Smith was inclined to relocate, he should choose a Qian (F1) building, followed by
a Gen (F2) and Kun (F3) building. Despite F4’s lackluster business acumen, the space is
still harmonious to Mr. Smith’s nature.
Won’t You Please Come In?
Before we make any changes, let’s consider what the Flying Stars have to say. Beginning
in the center, traveling up to the facing cell, we’ll move clockwise around the floor plan:
Note: M stands for Mountain Star; W for Water Star; and T for Time Star.
Center: 5M (earth) 1W (water) 3T (wood)
Earth controls water. A dominating relationship promoting the likelihood of ear-, kidney-,
and genital-related illness. Install a golden (metal) rug along the central pathway (see after
floor plan). This will weaken the ill-natured 5 earth star (metal reduces earth) and streng-
then the 1 water star (metal produces water), an innately auspicious number.
East: 7M (metal) 3W (wood) 1T (water)
Metal controls wood. A dominating combination bringing potential robberies and litigation.
During Period 7 (1984 to February 3, 2004), the ruling mountain star 7 must be supported
by a mountain. The building directly across the street serves as the remedy and will help
bring good health and beneficial relationships to Mr. Smith and his staff. Moving on,
260
Mr. Smith and his building
belong to the Dui trigram.
They are F4 to each other.

Chapter 20: Does Your Office Measure Up?
while you might think to add water to restore balance, and thus, diminish the unfavorable
forecast, the reductive phase water isn’t strong enough to thwart the untimely and inher-
ently bad number 3. Here, metal is needed to control the water star and assist the moun-
tain star.
Southeast: 6M (metal) 2W (earth) 2T (earth)
Earth produces metal. Although productive, the relationship fosters financial loss due to
illness, an unfortunate mishap that is being encouraged by the ill-natured earth time star.
Add metal to weaken the disadvantageous water star.
South: 1M (water) 6W (metal) 7T (metal)
Metal produces water. A productive relationship bringing career advancement. No remedy
is needed.
Southwest: 8M (earth) 4W (wood) 9T (fire)
Wood controls earth. A dominating relationship bringing creativity and harmony only if
the conflicting situation is remedied. Install the fire phase to revert the cycle to a balanced
one: wood-fire-earth. Fire will brighten 4 wood’s creativity and lessen the possibility of
inappropriate affairs. Also, fire will enhance the mountain star’s ability to elicit teamwork
and harmony among co-workers.
West: 3M (wood) 8W (earth) 5T (earth)
Wood controls earth. A combination bringing monetary gain only if the dominating rela-
tionship is remedied. A bridge (fire) is needed to connect the mountain and water stars. A
red rug inside the entryway is recommended. The number 8 water (money) star will become
especially advantageous during Period 8, where it must be supported by water or virtual
water such as a roadway. The back entrance should be used more in Period 8.
Northwest: 4M (wood) 9W (fire) 4T (wood)
Wood produces fire. A productive combination fostering writing and creativity. In this case,
notice that the area contains two highly auspicious money numbers—9W in the northwest
and 8W in the west. As you’ll soon learn, we recommend that Mr. Smith move his office
here. Install a table fountain to activate the money (water) stars. Disregarding the phase
relationships between water (the enhancement), 9 fire and 8 earth (the water stars), re-
member that water activates usable water stars (7, 8, and 9 for Period 7; 8, 9, and 1 for
Period 8).
North: 9M (fire) 5W (earth) 8T (earth)
Fire produces earth. Although a productive relationship, it is not a healthy one. Here, the
number 9 is encouraging the highly unfavorable number 5’s propensity for misfortune.
Moving metal is needed to reduce the possibility of financial and health hazards.
261

Part 6: Practical Application
Northeast: 2M (earth) 7W (metal) 6T (metal)
Earth produces metal. A combination bringing financial gain. Moreover, the ruling water
star (for Period 7) heightens the probability. During Period 7, the water star must be sup-
ported environmentally by a body of water or virtual water such as a roadway. Here, the
street serves as the enhancement.
Sitting Pretty
Now that you’ve determined the remedy or enhancement appropriate for each area of the
office, you can put the final piece in place. Look at how the desks of Mr. Smith’s staff are
positioned. Depending on which East or West Group each staff member belongs to, you’ll
reposition their desk so they face either the east or west wall.
262
Determining the staff’s most
favorable desk positions.
Moving clockwise around the room, let’s look at each employee, beginning with the
receptionist:
1. Zhen, female. The receptionist faces F4. As there is only one choice here, she’s 
fortunate.
2. Xun, male. Currently, this sales person faces north, his F1 qi. While auspicious, his
back is exposed. We’ll move him to face the east, his F2 qi.
3. Qian, female. Facing her H2 direction (north), position the accountant’s desk to
face her F1 direction, west.
4. Qian, female. Currently, this secretary faces north, her H2 direction. Reposition
her desk to face west, her F1 direction.
5. Gen, female. Facing north activates the secretary’s H3 qi. Move her desk to face
west, her F2 qi.

Chapter 20: Does Your Office Measure Up?
6. Zhen, male. While facing his F1 qi (south) is auspicious, his back cannot be
exposed. Reposition the sales associate’s desk against the east wall, facing his F4 qi.
7. Kun, male. Currently, this sales associate faces his H2 qi (south). We’ll move him 
so that he faces west, his F3 qi.
8. Li, female. While south (F4) is favorable for this sales person, we cannot expose her
back to the door. Reposition her desk toward the east wall, her F1 qi.
9. Li, male. Now, this sales associate faces south, his F4 qi. Move his desk to the east
wall, his F1 qi.
By making some simple adjustments, Mr. Smith and his staff should think and feel better.
A Means to an End
Taking into account the interior layout and the Eight House and Flying Star systems, form
a conclusion. What recommendations would you suggest? Consider … 
◆Whether the entrance should be relocated.
◆Now that you’ve determined a favorable sitting direction for everyone (we’ll discuss
Mr. Smith later on), how the cubicles can be positioned such that the design fosters
harmony among the co-workers.
◆How the cubicles can be positioned so qi can easily circulate.
◆Given what the Flying Stars destine, whether some employees should switch desk
positions.
◆Whether Mr. Smith’s office best suited to him.
The following illustration shows our recommendations.
Based on this new floor plan, we suggest … 
◆Relocating the main entrance—it is the key feng shui solution in this case study. We
suggest moving it to the northeast wall. Currently, the door’s location corresponds
to the building’s and Mr. Smith’s H4 qi. By moving the entrance, it will bathe the
owner, staff, and clients in auspicious an qi combination (2M-7W) inspiring financial
gain. Northeast also corresponds to the building’s and Mr. Smith’s F3 qi.
◆The cubicles should be arranged such that a middle corridor allows qi to circulate
freely. The corridor will also give the staff more privacy.
◆To facilitate harmony among the co-workers, entrances should be along the corridor.
◆The accountant in Room 3 should switch with the sales person in Room 6. The aus-
picious water stars (8 in the west and 9 in the northwest) are great for administering
the company’s finances.
263

Part 6: Practical Application
◆Mr. Smith should occupy the west-northwest office. Corresponding to his F4 and
F1 qi respectively, orient his desk so his back is against the north wall (as illustrated).
Although he’ll face his H3 qi (south), he’ll also face the 8 water (money) star. This
takes precedence.
264
Mr. Smith’s improved 
floor plan.
In theory, if Mr. Smith applies our suggestions, he and his staff should coexist peacefully.
He should notice an increase in motivation and production!
In Part 7, “Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?” you’ll learn about the Chinese
zodiac and a method of Chinese astrology called The Four Pillars of Destiny.
The Least You Need to Know
◆Design and layout play an important role in a business’s success.
◆An employee’s desk position within a particular design/layout can affect his or her
job motivation and productivity.
◆Preventing qi from circulating fosters misfortune and illness.

Part 7 is all about Chinese astrology. First, you’ll learn about the Chinese
zodiac, a popular method involving 12 animals. You know, the ones featured
on Chinese restaurant place mats. Based on your birth date, you’ll learn which
animals make your best friends and which are best avoided. Also, there’s a per-
sonality profile of each animal. So, you’ll know a horse is a horse, of course, of
course!
Next, we’ll tell you about The Four Pillars of Destiny. Unlike Western astrol-
ogy, which calculates the movement of heavenly bodies to determine your
destiny, The Four Pillars calculates the type of qi you inhaled at birth. That’s
right, the Chinese believe you inhale your destiny. Besides calculating and
interpreting your fate, you’ll also understand how a world humanitarian met
hers—an interesting study, to be sure!

◆Personality profiles of each animal sign
You’re in a Chinese restaurant waiting for your food to arrive. What else is
there to do but read your horoscope, which is printed on virtually every place
mat? You can learn all kinds of things from the Chinese zodiac. Which of the
12 animal signs were you born under? Are you a sociable but crafty rat, or a
proud and unpredictable tiger? Perhaps you’re a nurturing and benevolent
rabbit? Whatever your sign, your paper place mat will undoubtedly inform
you which animals are your friends and which are your foes. You’ll also learn
which creature rules the current year and how its sign affects your prospects.
Chapter

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
So, what does Chinese astrology have to do with feng shui? Not a whole lot. But, a good
feng shui practitioner will incorporate elements of Chinese astrology into his or her feng
shui analysis. Things like determining compatibility, your lucky colors, careers and envi-
ronments best suited to you are best described using astrology.
This chapter will take an elementary look into the popular system of Chinese astrology.
But know, while the animal zodiac can provide cursory insights into your personality, it is
rarely considered in more sophisticated systems of Chinese fate calculation (you’ll learn
about one such method, the Four Pillars of Destiny, in Chapters 22 through 25). Never-
theless, it’s fun! Even on a superficial level, the results are amazingly accurate.
What Is the Chinese Zodiac?
Legend has it, just before entering Nirvana, Buddha (563–483 B.C.E.) summoned the ani-
mal kingdom. For some reason, only 12 animals answered his call. To reward the respon-
dents, Buddha named a year after each animal in the order of its arrival. The rat arrived
first, so it was honored with the first year. Then came the ox, followed by the tiger, rabbit,
dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. Thus, we have the 12 animals
that make up the Chinese zodiac. 
But this is a legend. The truth is, no one really knows where the animal signs came from.
Sima Qian (163–85 B.C.E.), considered to be one of the greatest scholars of the Han
dynasty, and the Grand Astrologer to the emperor, never mentioned the animal cycle.
Nor is it mentioned in the astronomical chapters of the Jin Shu, the history of the Jin
dynasty (265–420 C.E). But, somehow, toward the end of the tenth century, the animal
cycle was in full use. Interestingly, contemporary scholars agree its origins are probably
not even Chinese. We’ll leave it up to the scholars to discover the true origins. Let’s
move on.
Twelve Animals, Twelve Earthly Branches
Not one of the 12 animal signs represents a star or a constellation. Rather, the animals
represent the movement of earthly qi expressed in cycles of time. Called the Twelve
Earthly Branches, each of the 12 animal signs corresponds to a branch, or component, of
12 two-hour increments, 12 months, and 12 years.
Most zodiac astrologers consider only the year, month, and hour of birth when determin-
ing a client’s astrological chart. But, what of the day you were born? Determining the day
branch requires a series of mathematical calculations that is either ignored by, or not
known by, astrologers who practice this system. As you’ll soon learn in Chapter 22, “The
Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1,” the Chinese believe we have eight components to our
personality. If the day/animal branch is ignored, then this analysis will account for only
three-eighths, or less than half, of our overall makeup.
268

Chapter 21: Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac
So, what purpose do the animals serve? The
animal signs attached to each branch are merely
mnemonics to aid learning the different types
of qi and their associated natural and human
phenomena.
Take the rat, for example. A nocturnal and social
creature, the rat is an ideal emblem for yin’s mid-
night hour, for winter, and for north. The rat per-
son is at his best at night and in a crowd. Directly
opposite the rat is the horse, the emblem of noon, summer, and south. The horse symbol-
izes independence, passion, and masculinity—all characteristics of yang’s force at its high-
est. This gives added meaning to the steadfast Marlboro ads, doesn’t it?
Governing the earthly branches, or animal cycle, are the five phases of fire, earth, metal,
water, and wood. Also, each branch corresponds to a yin and yang polarity. The following
illustration shows the interplay of everything we’ve discussed so far.
269
The Twelve Earthly
Branches (Di Zhi) represent a
cycle of the earth’s qi expressed
by the year, the month, the day,
and the time of day.
Wise Words
The Chinese zodiac and its
relationship to the earth’s qi.
Notice that the earth phase separates each of the other phase elements. This is because
the qi represented by fire, metal, water, and wood returns to earth before transforming
into another phase.

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
What’s Your Animal Sign?
Suppose you’re a rooster. Are you a fire rooster, earth rooster, metal rooster, water roos-
ter, or wood rooster? You could also be a fire rooster born in a water rat month, on an
earth tiger day, at the time of the metal dragon. See, this stuff is a lot more complex than
you thought! Even the experienced fortune-teller has much to consider. But learning to
analyze each component of your destiny is beyond the scope of this chapter. We’ll leave
that task to Chapter 23, “The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 2.” For our purposes here,
we’ll concern ourselves with only your year sign.
The following table lists the Chinese solar years from 1924 to 2023, along with the exact
time the year began. If you were born after the fifth of February, determining your sign is
simple. However, if you were born on the third, fourth, or fifth day of February, the hour
of your birth determines your Chinese birth year. Let’s say you were born at 3:30 P.M. on
February 4, 1925. You would use 1924 as your year of birth because 1925 didn’t begin
until 3:37 P.M. If you were born at 5:00 P.M. on February 4, 1925, then you would stay
with 1925. Let’s take another example. If you were born at 7:00 A.M. on February 5, 1940,
would you use 1940, the year of the Dragon, as your Chinese birth year? No. This is
because 1940 didn’t actually begin until 7:08 A.M.—eight minutes after you were born.
Your Chinese birth year would be 1939, the year of the Rabbit.
The question arises, why are we using the solar calendar instead of the lunar calendar to
mark the beginning of the year? While traditionally, Chinese New Year (which can occur
variously on a date in late January through mid February) marks the change in animal
sign, scholars and serious students of feng shui and the Four Pillars of Destiny (a method
of Chinese astrology that you’ll learn about in Chapters 22–25) consider the beginning of
spring as the new year.
270
The Chinese solar year begins variously on February 3, 4, or 5. It is the midpoint
between the Winter Solstice (the day when daylight is at its minimum) and Spring
Equinox (one of two days when day and night are of equal length). The solar calendar
is based on the rotation of the earth on its axis (the solar day) and the revolution of the
earth around the sun (the solar year). The ancients also measured the interval between
the successive full moons, the lunar months.

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
Considered individually, it takes 60 years for each phase’s sign to reappear (5 phases × 12
branch animals = 60 years). The last complete cycle began in 1924 (the year of the wood
rat), and ended in 1983 (the year of the water pig). The year 1984 ushered in a new cycle
of 60 years, which will end in 2043.
Who Are Your Friends?
Many Chinese wouldn’t think of proceeding with a ceremony, partnership, or anything
else of importance without first seeking guidance from an astrologer. As a cursory check
for compatibility, you too can determine the auspiciousness of a relationship.
272
Compatibility among the 12
animal signs.

Chapter 21: Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac
The signs that form a triangle are considered your most harmonious relationships (see the
preceding figure). The rat-dragon-monkey are the best of friends, as are the ox-snake-
rooster, the tiger-horse-dog, and the rabbit-sheep-pig. Upon closer examination, you’ll
notice each sign is four away from its compatible partner.
If you have some time on your hands, jot down the birth dates of your best friends and
family members. You’ll find that your affinity for your loved ones is more than a coinci-
dence.
Who Are Your Foes?
For every two allies, you have one dangerous rival. You can determine yours by locating
the animal directly opposite your sign. These are inauspicious relationships resulting in
conflict, tension, and even disaster.
The animal signs that do not appear opposite each other and are not part of an affinity
triad are considered compatible to varying degrees.
273
Incompatibility among the
12 animal signs.

Personality Profiles
Unlike other systems of Chinese fortune-telling where prediction and precautionary
measures are the cornerstones, the system of the animal zodiac offers nothing more than
general characteristics shared by people born under a specific sign. In the following sec-
tions, we’ll discuss the aspects of each of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac.
The Industrious Rat
Famous Rats: William Shakespeare, Mozart, George Washington, Mata Hari, Jimmy
Carter, Prince Charles, Doris Day, Sidney Poitier, Peggy Fleming, and Sean Penn
Everyone loves a rat. Charming, social, and quick-witted, those born during a rat year are
generally popular people. Always on the move, rats find safety in numbers, giving cre-
dence to the phrases “the rat race” and “the rat pack.” Rats also have good business acu-
men. Self-motivated, detail oriented, hard working, and overambitious, rats are able to
accumulate wealth effortlessly. Their thrifty nature and shrewdness pays off during a
recession. If you have a rat boss—beware! You’ll have to do a lot of negotiating to make
this rat part with his reserves. Rat women make excellent wives and mothers. Budgeting,
bargaining, delegating duties, and organizing hoards of stuff are her best qualities.
Negatively, the rat person loves to gossip and criticize. He is often self-obsessed, and
greedy.
Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
Good Year/Bad Year
To check if the current year is auspicious for you—or whether the upcoming year will be—
simply compare your phase sign to the year in question. For example, 2002 marks the year
of the water horse. If your element is the same as, or productive to, water and your animal
sign is compatible with a horse, then 2002 will not feature unfavorable qi for you. Yet, re-
member, this is a generality. Your year branch represents only one-eighth of your personality. 
274
If you’re wondering why the phase associated with your personal trigram is
different than the phase assigned to your animal sign, there is a reason. The personal
trigram represents the East or West Group you belong to. The phase is the phase of the
group, not the individual. The phase associated with your animal sign denotes the year
of birth. However, the year phase also does not represent the individual. As you’ll learn
in the next chapter, the phase associated with the day stem characterizes a person. 
Feng Alert

Chapter 21: Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac
275
The Methodical Ox
Famous Oxen: Walt Disney, Emperor Hirohito, Richard Nixon, Vincent van Gogh,
Margaret Thatcher, Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman, Adolf Hitler, Charlie Chaplin,
Saddam Hussein
The ox person succeeds by his own merits. Hard working, logical, meticulous, and tena-
cious, the ox can be trusted to get the job done. By nature, he is methodical, sticking to
routines and tradition. It’s almost impossible to get the ox to budge. His rigidity and mili-
tant style often result in an unapproachable and intimidating manner. At home, the ox
man is the disciplinarian, the decision maker, and the rule setter. Disobeying an ox is
cause for a rampage. Stay clear if he charges you! But, he is an excellent provider and his
family will never do without. An ox wife excels on the job and in her domestic duties. The
bills are paid, the checkbook is balanced, the dinner is made, the shirts are ironed, and the
kids are tucked in. Although the ox lacks a sense of humor, his affairs governed by his
head rather than his heart, he is an intensely loyal creature.
The Unpredictable Tiger
Famous Tigers: Beethoven, Ho Chi Minh, Queen Elizabeth II, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
Hugh Hefner, Marilyn Monroe, Rudolf Nureyev, Stevie Wonder, Jodie Foster, Tom
Cruise
Tigers are romantic, charismatic, and independent. They’re also fiercely adventurous,
moody, impulsive, and reckless. An ardent optimist, tigers live life to the fullest and on
their terms! Although he gives 110 percent to whatever catches his attention at that
moment, he is notoriously unreliable. The tiger man is brash, rash, and extremely posses-
sive. If he sees you with his lady, look out. The tiger woman is vain and indecisive. She is
playful with her children, but enforces good behavior. In all, tigers are unpredictable crea-
tures.
The Lucky Rabbit
Famous Rabbits: Albert Einstein, Orson Welles, John Dillinger, David Rockefeller, King
Olav V of Norway, Jane Seymour, Nicholas Cage, Fidel Castro, Francis Ford Coppola,
Sting
Rabbits are affable, even-tempered, and diplomatic. Known for their discriminating taste,
rabbits are refined, cultured, and a bit snobbish! They thrive on fine wine, gourmet food,
designer clothes, and stimulating conversation. In business, a rabbit is a deft negotiator.
His good judgment, sound advice, and graciousness will move him up the career track—
fast. Because he has few enemies he rarely gets into trouble. Rabbits live by the Golden
Rule and wouldn’t think of burning a bridge. Lady rabbits are kind, considerate, and
caring, but superficial. 

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
The Dynamic Dragon
Famous Dragons: Joan of Arc, John Lennon, Jimmy Connors, Salvador Dali, Shirley
Temple Black, Fred (Mr.) Rogers, Al Pacino, Pee Wee Herman, Christopher Reeves,
Robin Williams
Among the 12 animals, dragons are the most for-
tunate. In fact, they’re downright lucky! They’re
energetic, self-assured, grandiose, and egocentric.
Dragons are the doers of the world. They don’t
sit around waiting for things to happen, they
make them happen. You can always count on the
no-nonsense dragon to take charge—and take
risks. Their fiery enthusiasm and forceful nature
rule. Dragons want things done their way. They
demand perfection from themselves, and from
others. Even though the dragon must have the
last word, he is quick to forgive. Holding grudges
will slow him down. While the dragon’s magnan-
imous spirit draws a crowd, he has few close
friends.
The Wise Snake
Famous Snakes: Picasso, Mao Tse-tung, J. Paul Getty, Brooke Shields, John F. Kennedy,
Abraham Lincoln, Ryan O’Neal, Jacqueline Onassis, Oprah Winfrey
Those born under the sign of the snake are governed by their innate wisdom and intu-
ition. Snake people think a lot. They mull things over before forming an opinion. They’re
intensely philosophical and make excellent listeners. Snake people are fast learners and
will never make the same mistake twice. Highly skeptical and secretive creatures, snakes
prefer to keep matters to themselves. They cherish their privacy, concealing their inner-
most wants and needs. Distrustful and somewhat unforgiving, they tend to be paranoid,
even neurotic. Cross a snake and you can be sure he’ll strike at you. Most of the world’s
beautiful and powerful people are snakes. 
The Independent Horse
Famous Horses: Rembrandt, Leonid Brezhnev, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt,
Billy Graham, Laura Dern, Clint Eastwood, Roger Ebert, Paul McCartney, Barbra
Streisand
276
In China, the dragon is the
guardian of wealth and power.
It is the symbol of the emperor.
This is why there is an abun-
dance of dragon artifacts
throughout China and ethnic
Chinese communities worldwide.
If you have a keen eye, you’ll
notice that the dragon emblems
used by the commoners have
four claws on each paw. Only
the emperor’s emblems depict a
dragon with five claws.
Master Class

Chapter 21: Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac
A horse person loves freedom. Freedom to keep
his own hours. Freedom from routine. And,
freedom from anyone intending to rope him in.
So, if you’re married to a horse, give him space or
he’ll bolt. Incredibly industrious and self-reliant,
horses love a challenge. Horses tend to be show-
offs and self-centered, and will compliment to get
a compliment. Finances are never an issue. Horses
are hard-working and creative. Also, they are very
headstrong, quick-minded, and don’t tolerate
those who are not “up to speed.” Able to do 10
things at once, the horse abhors idleness. Horses
are poor savers, thinking of the now and not the
future. 
The Sensitive Sheep
Famous Sheep: Andy Warhol, Andrew Carnegie, Michelangelo, Bruce Willis, Barbara
Walters, Julia Roberts, John Wayne, Malcolm Forbes, Dan Rather, Robert DeNiro
Ultra-sensitive, altruistic, compliant, sincere, gentle: This is a sheep. Although they make
excellent sounding boards, don’t expect the sheep to help you solve your dilemma.
They’re there to listen only! Prone to stress and depression, sheep prefer tranquil envi-
ronments. At their worst, sheep can be pessimistic, withdrawn, and lazy. Any kind of 
criticism will cause them to brood for days. In the end, their self-pity will give rise to
encouragement and support from friends and colleagues. Don’t let a sheep manage your
finances. They overspend what they have due to their generous nature. Sheep individuals
follow the crowd, seldom lead.
The Mischievous Monkey
Famous Monkeys: Leonardo da Vinci, Charles Dickens, Mick Jagger, Danny De Vito, Tom
Hanks, Macauley Culkin, Elizabeth Taylor, Nelson Rockefeller, Princess Caroline of
Monaco, Ted Kennedy
Insatiably curious, monkeys will try anything once. Eager to learn new skills, a monkey
will enthusiastically perform it over and over until he’s mastered it. This gives credence to
the phrase, “Monkey see, monkey do.” Also, monkeys are intensely competitive. They
make it their mission to do things better than anyone else. Failure is not in the monkey’s
vocabulary. Extremely intelligent, clever, and innovative, the monkey person will excel in
any field. He truly believes he is “the top banana.” On the negative side, monkeys are dif-
ficult to trust. They tend to be too self-centered to care about anyone else.

For unknown reasons,
the Chinese dread the year of
the fire horse, believing that chil-
dren born under this sign will
bring disaster to the family. In
1966, it was reported that many
Asians opted to abort, causing
the birthrate to plummet. The year
of the fire horse returns in 2026.

The Meticulous Rooster
Famous Roosters: Sergei Rachmaninoff, Elton John, Dolly Parton, Gene Siskel, Prince
Phillip, Quincy Jones, Joan Rivers, Pope Paul VI, Emperor Akihito, Katharine Hepburn
Cocky and pretentious, the rooster loves to strut his stuff, showing off his fine feathers.
Roosters are proud creatures. Their world is black and white, void of gray. Brutally hon-
est, forthright, and candid; ask a rooster his opinion and he’ll tell you exactly what he
thinks. When he wants your opinion, he’ll give it to you! He is definitely not a diplomat.
If the rooster could learn to sweeten his criticism, he’d be much better off. On the posi-
tive side, roosters are detail-oriented and perfectionists. Give a rooster your money and
he will account for every penny. Also, roosters are extremely focused. Their organiza-
tional skills are superlative.
The Devoted Dog
Famous Dogs: Sir Winston Churchill, Harry Houdini, Elvis Presley, Cher, Bill Moyers,
Kevin Bacon, George Gershwin, Andre Agassi, Donald Sutherland, Bill Clinton
A dog is truly a person’s best friend. Compatible, compromising, loyal, and unprejudiced,
dogs are there when you need them. The dog person is trustworthy and dutiful, making
an excellent (albeit reluctant) leader. Contrary to what you may think, dogs form friend-
ships slowly. First, they must check you out, watch, and wait. You must win their affec-
tion. For the most part, dogs are humble animals, caring little about money. While they
can lavish you with unconditional devotion and love, when provoked, a dog can be
fiercely mean-spirited, downright nasty. Of all the signs in the Chinese zodiac, the dog is
the most likeable.
The Nurturing Pig
Famous Pigs: Al Capone, Prince Rainier, Ronald Reagan, Lucille Ball, Woody Allen,
Alfred Hitchcock, Kevin Kline, Billy Crystal, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hillary Clinton
Bottom line, pigs are the nicest people on the planet. With hearts of gold, they are hon-
est, patient, and will take every measure to ensure your safety and comfort. A pig will
remain your friend for life. But, pigs are often taken for granted. Only when they’re not
around do you realize how dependent you are on them. Naturally naive, pigs can be
gullible, falling prey to charlatans and swindlers. In all, pigs of both genders are selfless,
devoted, and loving. They just can’t say “no.” Because of their overzealous generosity, the
pig person has little money. Nevertheless, he has enough, giving credence to the phrase,
“the more you give, the more you shall receive.”

Chapter 21: Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac
These are the general characteristics of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac. If you’re
interested in a more detailed account, there are many books on the subject. One we sug-
gest is Theodora Lau’s The Handbook of Chinese Horoscopes (HarperCollins, 1991).
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about The Four Pillars of Destiny, a method of Chinese
astrology that can help you determine your lucky days, as well as the environments,
careers, and colors best suited to your own qi.
The Least You Need to Know
◆The 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac represent cycles of earthly qi.
◆The Chinese zodiac system of astrology is superficial, but fun.
◆Once you determine your animal sign, you’ll know who are your animal friends and
foes.
◆This system is concerned more with personality profiles than fate prediction and
prevention.

◆Assembling your life chart
There are two main schools of Chinese astrology. One is The Four Pillars of
Destiny (Ziping Bazi), a system of analyzing “pillars” of our fate made mani-
fest in the year, month, day, and hour of our birth. The other school is Purple
Constellation Fate Computation, or Ziwei Doushu in Chinese. A bit more
complex, this system analyzes anywhere from 36 to 157 stars in accordance
with our birth information (and beyond our scope here). 
In this chapter, you’ll learn the former, and more popular, method of fate cal-
culation, The Four Pillars of Destiny. You’ll learn how to assemble your own
chart just like a Chinese astrologer would have done over 1,000 years ago.
Don’t be intimidated by the seemingly complicated charts. They’re easy to
read.
We have a lot to do, so let’s get busy!
Chapter

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
How Free Is Free Will?
We all know what free will means. It’s what sets us apart from any other living, breathing
thing on earth. Free will allows us to make choices, to actively participate in building our
life’s path. But are we totally free? Of course not. No one has absolute free will. Not even
America—“the land of the free.” Physical limitations and psychological conditioning
restrict most of us from making choices that are harmful, or socially and morally unac-
ceptable. For example, we have the freedom to jump off a cliff. But would you want to?
Also, we have the freedom to say just about anything. It’s our constitutional right. But
would you want to? Do you really want to tell your best friend that you hate her new
hairdo? Do you really want to tell your spouse he or she is not your soul mate? We think
not.
Clearly, our decisions in some measure reflect the belief systems of our parents, society,
and country. But our decisions are also influenced by our character or personality, the part
of us that is largely inexplicable. Some believe our fundamental character is determined by
our genetic composition. Some believe God or a Higher Power grants us our innate char-
acter, talents, and circumstances. Then there’s reincarnation, the belief that cause and
effect, or karma, determines the outcome of our lives. Basically, reincarnation holds that
we are continually reborn until we achieve our full potential.
The Chinese believe that our destiny is a blend of fate and free will, a harmony of heav-
enly, earthly, and human qi. They believe our character is a by-product of our fate. Our
fate is determined by the first breath we take. Literally, we inhale our destiny, a composite
of qi present at that exact moment.
What Is The Four Pillars of Destiny?
Simply, The Four Pillars of Destiny is a method of calculating and interpreting the five
phase components of the qi you inhaled at birth. Like feng shui, it is an accurate system
of predicting possibilities. For example, the chart you
will soon create may indicate a potential for great
wealth, thus creating an innate urge to succeed. But
how you act on this urge is where your free choice
comes into play. In other words, regardless of what
your chart may indicate, free will helps to determine
the outcome of your fate.
So, if good fortune prevails in your chart, waiting for
Publisher’s Clearinghouse to come knocking at your
door isn’t an answer. The onus is on you to act on your
inborn talents and desires—to force the hand, so to
speak. If you are blessed with advantageous possibility,
it’s up to you to bring it to fruition!
282
Called Bazi (“eight char-
acters”) in Chinese, The Four
Pillars of Destiny is a method of
calculating and interpreting the
five phase elements present at
your birth. Each pillar represents
a year, month, day, and hour.
The Four Pillars of Destiny meas-
ures probabilities, not certainties,
of your life’s path.
Wise Words

Chapter 22: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1
What do the “pillars” of The Four Pillars of Destiny mean? Well, each pillar is actually a
time component. One pillar represents the year, one the month, one the day, and one the
hour. Each time component describes the five-phase element structure present at the
moment of your birth (when you took your first, qi-inspired breath). The relationship and
position of each phase helps to determine your probable life path. The following chart
shows the Four Pillars, which you’ll be assembling later on in this chapter.

Notice that each pillar is divided into a

short for Ten Heavenly Stems, and branch
is short for Twelve Earthly Branches, which
we’ll discuss a little later in this chapter.
Time, Chinese Style
Before we can get into the mechanics, let’s take a
moment to talk about, well, time. As we men-
tioned in Chapter 14, “The Flying Stars, Part 2,”
Westerners view time as linear. The year begins
on January 1 and ends on December 31. The month begins on the first and generally ends
on the thirtieth. The day begins and ends at midnight. Times proceeds along a straight
line. 
The Chinese, on the other hand, think cyclically. Time is a continuous spiral. What goes
around, comes around. Time does repeat itself—sort of.
The Ten Heavenly Stems
How did the Chinese develop their concept of time? As the story goes, the legendary
Huang Di, known as the Yellow Emperor (2697–2597 B.C.E.), ordered a wise man named
Da Nao to invent a system of recording time. To achieve this, Da Nao set about observing
There’s a fundamental differ-
ence between Western and
Chinese astrology. Western
astrology considers the posi-
tions of the planets, sun, and
moon at your birth—a truly astral
method. Chinese astrology is
concerned with types of qi (heav-
enly, earthly, and human) and,
therefore, isn’t exclusively astral.
Master Class

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
the intricacies of the five phases of qi, how they transformed over the course of the year.
From this observation, Da Nao developed what he called the Ten Heavenly Stems, shown
in Table 1.
Why are the stems “heavenly”? Harkening back to Chapter 4, “Qi Wiz! It’s Life’s Force!”
the Chinese people use the word “heaven” to mean “time.” Hence, the heavenly stems
record how qi changes with time.
284
The Ten Heavenly Stems (Tian Gan) represent how the five phases alter with
the passage of a year. One type of qi undergoes growth, then declines while yielding
to another type. The growing stage is yang qi (as described in Chapter 5, “The
Principle of Yin and Yang,” yang is associated with the land of the living, summer,
heat). The declining stage, yin qi is related to the realm of the dead, winter, cold.

The Twelve Earthly Branches
Just as the words “heaven” and “time” are interchangeable, so, too, are the words “earth”
and “space.” As you learned in the previous chapter, the Twelve Earthly Branches denote
the location where different qi prevails on earth. In the north, water qi prevails. In the
east, wood qi prevails. Fire qi prevails in the south, and metal qi in the west. Although this
idea is illustrated in Chapter 21, “Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac,”
it does not include the branch names and numbers as indicated in the following Table 2.

Chapter 22: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1
We won’t be using the zodiac animals that we talked about in the previous chapter in 
the Four Pillars calculations. We’ve included them here merely for amusement. After 
all, Chinese zodiac astrology is derived, in some measure, from the Twelve Earthly
Branches—each animal being associated with a branch.
The Cycle of Sixty
The Ten Heavenly Stems and the Twelve Earthly Branches combine into a Cycle of Sixty
stem-branch pairs, shown in the following Table 3. If you imagine two gears—one with 10
teeth and the other with 12 teeth—and allow them to rotate and interlock, the gear with
10 teeth would complete its rotation before the gear with 12 teeth. If you mark the first
tooth of each gear and begin the rotation, you’ll note that it takes six rotations of the 10
and five rotations of the 12 before the first teeth of the respective gears are aligned as 
they were at the start. Thus, the sixtieth interlocking will start the repeating of the cycle.
Therefore, there are 60 possible pairs when the stems and branches are combined.
Beginning with Jia Zi, the year 2697 B.C.E.
marked the first of the 60-year, or 60-stem-
branch cycle. Why does the cycle begin with Jia
(wood) Zi (water)? This is because the branch
(Zi/water) is at the end of yin. The beginning of
yang is marked by the growth of wood. It is a
time of birth and renewal. What cycle are we cur-
rently in, you ask? You’ll find out in a moment.

Chapter 22: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1
Calculating Your Four Pillars
Determining your Four Pillars is as easy as one-two-three-four. We’ve provided an empty
chart for you to fill out at the end of the chapter. All you have to do is plug in the infor-
mation. If you’d rather, you may write each pillar’s components on a separate sheet of
paper, transferring the information to the chart at the end. This may save time flipping
back and forth between pages.
The Year Pillar
To determine your year pillar, locate your birth year on Table 4. Remember, if you were
born between January 1 and February 2, you must use the year prior to your actual birth
year. If you were born on February, 3, February 4, or February 5, you must look in the
“Time” column to determine your Chinese birth year. For example, if you were born on
February 4, 1970, at 3:00 P.M., your birth year is 1970. But if you were born at 1:00 P.M.,
you would use 1969, as February 4 did not begin yet.
Let’s take an example to help you assemble your chart. A woman was born on July 1,
1961, at 7:45 P.M. As you can see in Table 4, the year 1961 is a Xin Chou year. Xin (stem)
represents the metal phase; Chou (branch), the earth phase. How do we know this? Just
consult the Ten Heavenly Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches tables that we presented a
little earlier. Although the yin and yang polarity is a consideration, for your purposes, we
will not be fussing with this.
Thus, your chart should look something like this:

Chapter 22: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1
The Month Pillar
To determine your month components, simply find your Western birth year in Table 5.
Then locate your birth month. Continuing with our example, if you were born on July 1,
1961, at 7:45 P.M., find the row of months corresponding to 1961. Now follow your finger
to the fifth Chinese solar month—Jia (stem) Wu (branch). Notice that Jia Wu begins on
June 6 and ends on July 6 (July 7 marks the beginning of Yi Wei, the sixth solar month).
The example’s July 1 birth date falls in the fifth Chinese solar month. What do the times
mean?
Corresponding to Beijing time (120°E), they indicate the exact time the month began. For
example, Jia Wu began on June 6 at 6:46 A.M. If you were born on this date (or another
date where the month changed) and do not live in northern China, you must compute the
time of the beginning of the month from Beijing time to the time at your birth place to
determine which solar month you belong to. For example, June 6 at 6:46 A.M. in Beijing 
is June 5 at 10:46 P.M. in London (0°) and June 5 at 2:46 P.M. in Los Angeles (120°W).
These people would use Gui Si, the fourth solar month, as their birth month. Get the
idea? Again, you only have to do the conversion if you were born on the first day of the
solar month: February 4, March 6, April 5, May 6, 1961, for example). 
Now, consulting Tables 1 (the Ten Heavenly Stems) and 2 (the Twelve Earthly Branches),
determine the example’s phases corresponding to her birth month, Jia Wu.

The Day Pillar
Determining your day pillar requires several steps and simple mathematics. You’ll find
Table 6 easier to read if you imagine it as one long chart. The day number begins with 0
and ends with 29 on the first chart, continuing with 30 and ending with 59 on the second
chart. Following this idea, a month may begin on one chart and end on the other. For
example, find January 1 on the first chart. If you skim down to the end of the column,
you’ll see that January 30 is the last entry. Now, move over to the first column on the 
second chart. The first entry commences with January 31. Continuing down the column,
the last entry is March 1. March 2 is found on the second column in chart 1. Again, if you
envision chart 2 taped to the bottom of chart 1, this seemingly complicated configuration
becomes clear, the months flowing into each other. To avoid confusion, we suggest you
take some time to practice reading this chart before proceeding.
◆Step One: Find the day number in the following table corresponding to your birth-
day. Continuing with the example, you’ll find July 1 on the first chart. This day’s day
number is 1.
Like converting meters to feet or centigrade to Fahrenheit, Table 6 is converting the
Chinese solar calendar into the Western, or Gregorian, calendar. Counting January
1 as “0,” a day number is the number of days into a year any specific day is. For
example, February 10 is 40 days into the year. So, February 10’s day number is 40. If
the number of days into the year is greater than 60, 60 is subtracted from the total
until the remainder is less than 60. For example, March 31 is 89 days into the year—
89 – 60 = 29 day number. Say, August 10 is your birthday. August 10 is 221 days into
the year. So, 221 – 60 – 60 – 60 = 41 day number.

Chapter 22: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1
◆Step Two: Find the number corresponding to your Western birth year from the
Year Number Table 7. The example’s birth year is 1961, a numeric value of 31.
◆Step Three: Add the numbers from Steps One and Two together. Continuing with
the example, 1 (Step One) + 31 (Step Two) = 32.

The day pillar.

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
◆Step Four: If the date occurs in a leap year (indicated by the asterisk after the year),
add one to the sum. Otherwise, the sum remains the same. July 1 is after February
28 and it is not a leap year. If the example’s birthday is March 20, 1960, she would
add one to the sum because 1960 is a leap year and she was born after February 28.
◆Step Five: If the sum is over 60, subtract 60 from it. If the sum is less than 60, use
the sum. Thirty-two is less than 60 and becomes the resulting number. But let’s take
302

Chapter 22: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1
a person born on June 15, 1997. June 15 corresponds to 45 on the Day Pillar Table
6 (Step One). On the Year Number Table 7, 1997 corresponds to 40 (Step Two).
Added together, 45 + 40 = 85 (Step Three). June 15 is after February 28 and is not a
leap year. The sum remains the same (Step Four). Because the sum is over 60, you
must subtract 60. Thus, 85 – 60 = 25.
◆Step Six: The result in Step Five is the number of the day in question within the
60-day cycle. Continuing with the first example of the woman born on July 1, 1961,
at 7:45 P.M., her resulting number is 32, which corresponds to Yi (Stem) Wei
(Branch) on Table 8. Yi (wood) Wei (earth) is the example’s day pillar.

The Hour Pillar
To determine the components of your hour pillar, find the time of your birth in the Time
column in Table 9. If you were born when Daylight Saving Time was in effect, you must
subtract an hour from the time of your birth. If you’re unsure if DST was in effect, one of
the following books can help:
◆Doane’s Worldwide Time Change Update, by Doris Chase Doane (American Federation
of Astrologers, Inc., 1991)
◆Time Changes in the USA, also by Doris Chase Doane (American Federation of
Astrologers, Inc., 1997)
Next, run your finger over one column to determine your branch component. To deter-
mine your stem component you must know your day stem, which you’ll find at the top of
Table 9. Then, run your finger down the column until it intersects with the Time line.

Concluding our example’s life chart, she was born at 7:45 P.M. Adjusting for DST, her
birth hour now becomes 6:45 P.M., which falls within the two-hour time block of 5 P.M.
to 7 P.M. in the Time column. Her corresponding branch is You (metal). Our example’s
day stem is Yi. Run your finger down the Yi or Geng column until it intersects with the
5–7 P.M. time line. Yi is also her hour stem. Thus, her hour pillar is Yi (wood) You (metal).

Whew! You’ve completed your Four Pillars of Destiny life chart. Now what? This is
where the fun begins. In Chapter 23, “The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 2,” and Chapter
24, “The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 3,” you’ll learn how to determine your lucky colors,
suitable careers, and environments. Based on what phases are favorable to you, you’ll be
able to ascertain if a 10-year period, a year, month, and even a day will be favorable, unfa-
vorable, or somewhere in between. So, don’t sign that important document just yet. Hold
off making vacation plans and celebrations. Grasp fuller knowledge of your destiny by
continuing to construct an understanding of your Four Pillars.

◆Interpreting Princess Diana’s chart
Now that you’ve assembled your chart, how do you interpret it? Before you
can obtain insight, you must know how to acquire information and where to
look. In this chapter, we’ll continue with the Four Pillars method and its
application with respect to the five phases. In so doing, we will zero in on the
Day-Master and reveal how it offers a particularly personal assessment.
The All-Important Day-Master
Although The Four Pillars of Destiny dates to the Tang dynasty (618–907 C.E.),
when astrologer Li Xuzhong developed it as a way to represent a person’s
birth data, the approach hasn’t stayed constant. Over time, there have been
Chapter

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
many alterations. Perhaps the most significant ones involved focusing on the Day-Master
as a means of illuminating a person’s specific characteristics.
Called the Day-Master, this method is also known as
the Ziping Method after astrologer Xu Ziping and dates
to the Song dynasty (960–1279 C.E.). The Day-Master
helps you to identify which of the five phases you be-
long to. It can determine if you have a strong or a weak
chart. Knowing the relative strength of your chart can
lead you to a broader understanding of your relation-
ship to the five phases, as you’ll soon see.
The following illustration indicates where the Day-
Master appears on your chart. The Day-Master is
equivalent to the day stem phase component of your
Four Pillars of Destiny chart.
308
The Day-Master, or
Ziping Method, developed by
Song dynasty astrologer Xu
Ziping, analyzes the five phases
in your Four Pillars chart in rela-
tionship to how each phase
affects the Day-Master (the day
stem component of your Four
Pillars chart).
Wise Words
The Day-Master.
Now, refer to your life chart you just constructed in Chapter 22, “The Four Pillars of
Destiny, Part 1,” and pinpoint your Day-Master. You may want to paperclip that page, as
you’ll be referring to it throughout this chapter. Also, it’s a good idea to have the tear-out
card handy from the front of this book. We’ll soon be analyzing the relationship between
the phases and Day-Master.
The Timeliness of Your Day-Master
To determine the strength of your chart, you need to familiarize yourself with the time-
liness of your Day-Master. Timeliness refers to the time of the year you were born—
specifically, into which season you were born. Remember how the five phases correspond
to the seasons? Here again, that information is important (see Chapter 6, “The Principle

Chapter 23: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 2
of the Five Phases,” for a reminder). For the sake of clarity, let’s reiterate. Wood corre-
sponds to spring; fire to summer; metal to autumn; and water to winter. Earth is a special
case, which we will deal with shortly.
Add to these phase/season relationships five
possible conditions: timely, weak, locked, dead,
and ready. These conditions refer to the phase’s
strength in the particular season into which you
are born. For example, if your Day-Master is
wood and you are born in spring, you are timely
because wood is predominant in the spring. In
summer, wood is weak. In later summer, wood is
exceedingly weak but not yet dead. It is locked.
Once autumn arrives, wood is dead. With winter,
wood begins to repeat its cycle and is ready.
Each phase goes through a similar cycle, with its
timely period corresponding to the season in
which it is dominant. By the way, late summer is
identified as an independent season because of the climate of China. Early to mid-summer
is usually hot and dry and relates to the first two months of our Western summer. Late
summer (the latter half of your Western summer) brings rain and dampness. The chart
following lists the phases (except earth) and their timely conditions throughout the sea-
sons.

Now, what of earth? As we mentioned, earth is a special case. It’s a transitional phase, as
you learned in Chapter 21, “Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac.”
Earth is timely in October, January, and April, or the final 18 days of autumn, winter, and
spring. With summer, earth is not restricted to the final 18 days because of the inclusion
of late summer as a separate season. Earth is timely (hence predominant) in late summer.
Other than its periods of timeliness, earth is weak in autumn, locked in winter, dead in
spring, and ready in summer.
If you haven’t already determined if your Day-Master is timely, weak, locked, dead, or

A phase is timely when
it is in its season of predomi-

energy has been depleted. A
phase is locked when it is about
to die. A phase is dead when
it is completely controlled by
another phase (in its own timely
state). A phase is ready when it’s
about to begin the cycle again.

Day-Master Relations
Because this chapter is rather involved, let’s review for a moment. In The Four Pillars of
Destiny, there are eight components, one of which is the Day-Master. Each component is
associated with a phase (fire, earth, metal, water, wood). To interpret a life chart, you
examine how the Day-Master is affected by the other seven phases. How they relate to
the Day-Master will lead you to the strength of your chart. The various relationships are
categorized into five interpretive phases. They are … 
310
You can identify a chart’s timeliness without knowing the specific birthday by referring to
the phase in the month branch. For example, if the Day-Master is fire and the month
branch is fire, the Day-Master is timely. Conversely, if the Day-Master is fire and the
month branch is water, the Day-Master is dead. However, this method doesn’t quite
work for earth. In this case, you’ll need to know the month branch animal sign, a factor
illustrated in Chapter 21.
Feng Facts
1. Resource. If a phase produces the Day-Master it is the resource phase. An example
would be how wood (resource) produces fire (Day-Master). (You may want to review
the five phases cycles in Chapter 6.) The resource phase is to the Day-Master as a
mother is to her son. In human terms, resource corresponds to support from your
parents and boss. An abundance of resource suggests you may be spoiled. A lack of
resource means you tend to do things by yourself.
2. Performance. If a phase is produced by the Day-Master it is the performance phase.
An example would be how earth (performance) is produced by fire (Day-Master).
The performance phase is to the Day-Master as a son is to his mother. In human
terms, performance corresponds to your talents, production, accomplishments, and 
achievements. A lot of performance means you are
a very talented person. A lack of performance indi-
cates you’re a sure-footed worker.
3. Power. If a phase controls the Day-Master, it is the
power phase. An example would be how water
(power) controls fire (Day-Master). The power
phase is to the Day-Master as a stern father is to
his son or a strict teacher is to his pupil. In human
terms, those who seek to control you also em-
power you to strengthen and succeed. An abun-
dance of power suggests too many constraints. A
lack of power could mean a lack of ambition and
discipline.
The resource phase
gives strength to, supports, and
produces the Day-Master. The
performance phase is produced
by the Day-Master. The power
phase controls, dominates, or
empowers the Day-Master. The
wealth phase challenges the
Day-Master. The parallel phase is
the same as the Day-Master.
Wise Words

Chapter 23: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 2
4. Wealth. If a phase is controlled by the Day-Master, it is the wealth phase. An exam-
ple would be how fire (wealth) is controlled by water (Day-Master). The wealth
phase is to the Day-Master as a son is to his stern father. In human terms, the wealth
phase indicates money, property, and success. An abundance of the phase suggests
you exert a lot of energy to create and/or maintain your success and/or money and
property. A lack of wealth indicates you must create opportunities yourself. It does
not suggest you will not have money or a successful career.
5. Parallel. If a phase is simply the same phase as the Day-Master, it is the phase ele-
ment. A parallel phase assists the Day-Master to make him strong. In human terms,
parallel phases are your friends and competitors. An abundance of parallel may mean
you have to compete for everything including money and love. A lack of this phase
suggests loneliness and a lack of assistance from colleagues and friends.
Are you with us, so far? We know this stuff is complicated, but stick with it. In the end, it
will be worth your while. Patience and perseverance prevail (say that 10 times fast).
Strong or Weak?
Now that you’ve determined the timeliness of your Day-Master and understand how each
phase affects the Day-Master, you’re ready to examine your chart as a whole. In this sec-
tion, you’ll learn if your chart is one of strength or weakness. But don’t think the strength
or weakness of your chart reflects you, the person. There are many powerful people who
have weak charts, as you shall soon see.
It’s also important to understand that analyzing a chart is no easy task. It takes experience,
a keen eye, and a solid understanding of the subtleties of the five phase relationships.
Apprentices under the tutelage of a master often study and train for years before going
out on their own. In addition to what we present, there are many other factors that must
be taken into consideration. For example, a phase in question could have hidden phases
that influence the structure of the chart. Also, each phase corresponds to a familial rela-
tion, another factor that affects the reading. While there exist many other details that we
won’t go into, for our purposes, know that like analyzing Flying Star number combina-
tions, there are often shades of gray. So, take it easy, and take your time. The two cate-
gories of charts follow.
The Strong Day-Master
A strong Day-Master is a chart that has lots of resources, lots of parallel, not much power,
maybe some wealth, and not much performance. In other words, the person has a lot of
support (resource), friends to assist him (parallel), good guidance (power), and some op-
portunity to succeed and make money (wealth), but little opportunity to show his talent
(performance). Of course, he must be born in a timely season, or at least a season when
311

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
the Day-Master isn’t locked or dead. If he is untimely, this reduces the strength of the
chart.
The following illustration shows an example of a strong Day-Master.

First, we must determine the Day-Master’s timeliness. What do you think? If you say it is
timely, you are correct. The Day-Master metal is timely in a metal month. Now, let’s look
at why this is a strong chart. There are two resource (earth) phases nourishing the Day-
Master and two parallel (metal) phases assisting compared to one wealth (wood), one
power (fire), and one performance (water) phase, which deplete metal’s strength. 
A strong Day-Master means one with more resource and parallel phases than
power, wealth, and performance phases. A person with a strong chart has many friends
and many competitors. He derives much support from those around him who are more
experienced, while getting few chances to demonstrate his own talents. Also, those with
strong charts are susceptible to injuries received through the exhibition of their talents.
Wise Words
Those with strong Day-Masters include Al Gore, Mohammed Ali, Steve Forbes, Steffi
Graf, and Monica Lewinsky.
The Weak Day-Master
What constitutes a weak Day-Master? Well, untimeliness is a factor. (However, if the Day-
Master is timely, the chart may still be weak, but on the strong side of weak.) The presence
of many power, performance, and wealth phases, and the lack of resource and parallel
phases, are the other considerations. A person with a weak chart tends to be attracted to
people who are talented and well disciplined. In fact, the weak chart person is often domi-
nated and controlled, receiving little support from friends and those more experienced.

In this illustration, the Day-Master is timely—metal born in a metal month. Yet, the chart
is weak. Although the Day-Master is enhanced by one resource (earth) and assisted by one
parallel (metal), it is surrounded by four power (fire) phases and one performance (water).
Also, this chart lacks wealth (water), which would only serve to weaken it further. All fac-
tors considered, this chart is clearly weak.
A weak Day-Master is one with more power, performance, and wealth than
resource and parallel. A person with a weak Day-Master is usually being challenged
by power and authority, yet has enough intelligence to combat such confrontations.
Also, he has much potential to use his talents to have spectacular achievements in
favorable luck periods.
Wise Words
Those with weak Day-Masters include George W. Bush, Richard Nixon, Michael Jordan,
Bill Clinton, and Marlene Dietrich. 
What Are Your Favorable and Unfavorable Phases?
Before we get around to addressing this question directly, let’s put forth a scenario. Let’s
say your Day-Master is wood. According to the relationship of the five phases, water
(resource) produces wood while metal (power) controls wood. We accept as common
sense that water is favorable and metal is unfavorable. But should we be so hasty? Obvi-
ously, water is essential to the growth and nourishment of a plant. Likewise, we need
nourishment and support from our friends. But too much water can drown a plant, just as
too many friends can sometimes overwhelm us. Similarly, we can chop down a tree with

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
an ax, but we can prune it with shears to maximize its growth potential. So, again, what’s
favorable and what’s unfavorable? How do we know which phase is best suited to meet
our needs? The answer lies in the Four Pillars structure.
In Chinese philosophy, equilibrium is optimum. A phase that brings your Four Pillars to 
a state of equilibrium is your favorable phase. Sometimes, we may have more than one
favorable phase. But, just as a phase can help you, a phase can potentially cause you harm,
putting at risk your well-being. Such a phase (or phases) would be unfavorable to you.
A Strong Day-Master’s Favorable and Unfavorable Phases
The following is a strong chart. The Day-Master is timely because metal (in the month
branch) is born in autumn. Also, the Day-Master is enhanced by two resource (earth)
phases and assisted by two parallel (metal) phases. It is controlled only by one power (fire)
phase and weakened by one performance (water) phase.
There is only one wealth (wood) phase. To bring this
chart to balance, more intelligence is needed. While
weakening the Day-Master, water also enhances wealth
(wood), whose maintenance is consistently draining
energy from the Day-Master. The more chances to
make money or to develop, the more energy drained
from the Day-Master. Also, fire is considered favorable
because it pushes the Day-Master to work harder
toward greater accomplishments.
314
A phase that brings bal-
ance to your chart is considered
favorable. A phase that causes
an imbalance is considered
unfavorable.

So, what phases are unfavorable in this chart? Metal (parallel) and earth (resource). An
abundance of metal brings more competitors, even enemies. Earth is considered unfavor-
able simply because it is suffocating the Day-Master.

Chapter 23: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 2
A Weak Day-Master’s Favorable and Unfavorable Phases
Although the Day-Master is timely, the following is a weak chart because the ratio of the
performance (water)/power (fire)/wealth (wood) phases to the resource (earth)/parallel
(metal) phases is unbalanced. The Day-Master must be strengthened. In this case, earth 
is favorable because it accomplishes three things. First, it will nourish the Day-Master.
Second, earth will weaken the fire threatening the Day-Master. Finally, earth will control
water. Also, metal is considered favorable to a lesser degree because inner strength is more
effective than outside assistance.

Let’s take an example. Say your favorable phase is fire, your unfavorable phase is water.
Your lucky colors would then be red, purple, dark orange, and pink. Your unlucky colors
are blue and black. So, following the five phase correlations, you’re best suited to hot and
dry environments. Fire industries like restaurants, fire fighting, and electrical engineering
are suitable careers. In regard to compatibility, you’ll have to find a spouse with plenty of
fire in his or her Four Pillars.

The Fate of Princess Diana
The example you used in the last chapter to assemble your chart was that of Princess
Diana. Surprised? Let’s examine her chart in terms of strengths and weaknesses.
Wood in summer is untimely. It’s weak. There is no resource (water) to nourish Diana’s
Day-Master. Two power (metal) phases control, but empower her. There is one perform-
ance (fire) phase. Despite having two parallel (wood) phases that assist her, wood is con-
sidered neutral here. Diana’s chart is weak. Water, her favorable phase, is the key to her
survival. Metal is also favorable only if accompanied by water. Otherwise, metal is unfa-
vorable. Earth (wealth), which controls water, is her unfavorable phase. Fire, which weak-
ens her further, is also unfavorable. All total, Diana’s chart is weak.
Your Marriage Palace corresponds to the phase beneath the Day-Master (the
day branch). If its phase is favorable, your marriage, or prospects of getting married,
will be successful. If the phase is unfavorable, then chances are slim your marriage can
survive.

a good understanding of the five phase relationships. With this knowledge you can then
learn what components of time are destined to bring favorable or unfavorable conditions.
The Axiom of Luck
We all know luck exists. It seems some people are just plain lucky. They win drawings,
they win at gambling, they win sweepstakes. Seemingly, everything they touch “turns to
gold.” Some say they have “the luck of the Irish.” You know the type. Then there are
those who can’t “get a break.” They are “down on their luck;” “black clouds” follow them.
We consider these unfortunate people unlucky.
We all know lucky and unlucky people. In fact, each of us has experienced good luck and
bad luck throughout our lives. But can luck be proven? After all, it isn’t something we can
apply our five senses to. Luck can’t be seen, touched, or
smelled. You can’t taste or feel luck. Yet, we agree it
exists. Luck is a “fact” we accept without proof. In
mathematics, a self-evident truth accepted on its intrin-
sic merit is called an axiom. For example, 1 + 1 = 2 is an
axiom. This equation does not have to be proven be-
cause it is accepted as truth.
Okay, I buy this, you say. But can luck be proven? The
Chinese believe luck is a function of time governed by
the laws of nature. They believe luck is not random,
but determinable. If luck were random, there would be
no laws of nature. Physics would not exist. The uni-
verse would operate in a chaotic state. So, how do you
determine luck? The Four Pillars of Destiny is only
one method the Chinese use to measure the distribu-
tion of your luck. Let’s see how.
Lucky Me
Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary defines luck as “a force that brings good fortune.” The
Chinese believe this “force” is actually qi. Specifically, the qi you inhaled at birth deter-
mines when your luck begins. From that point on, your luck is traditionally described in
periods of 10 years. Does this mean that you’ll have 10 years of fortune, followed by 10
years of misfortune? No. It means each fortunate period carries mostly favorable qi, while
each unfortunate period carries mostly unfavorable qi.
First, though, you must determine when your first luck period begins. To determine this,
you must know the stem and branch of your year pillar and its yin and yang polarity. (See
320
“Good luck is preferred to a
good life.”
—Chinese proverb
Notable Quotable
An axiom is a widely
accepted fact based on its intrin-
sic merits. Because an axiom is a
general truth, it does not have to
be proven.

the Cycle of Sixty Table 3 in Chapter 22, “The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 1,” for this
information. All tables referred to in this chapter are to be found in Chapter 22.) For
example, if your year pillar is Jia Zi (the first stem-branch combination), its polarity is
yang. If your year pillar is Yi Chou (the second stem-branch combination), its polarity is
yin. Based on the stem-branch polarity and your gender, you will fall into one of two cate-
gories and follow instructions accordingly: those for a yang male and yin female, or those
for a yin male and yang female.
Yang Male or Yin Female, Please Step Forward
If you are a yang male or yin female, follow these simple steps to determine your 10-year
luck periods. How do you know if you’re a yang male or yin female? As just mentioned,
simply consult the Cycle of Sixty Table 3 in Chapter 22. For example, if your year pillar is
Jia Wu (number 31 in the cycle of 60), this stem-branch combination is yang. So if Jia Wu
describes your year pillar and you are male, this would make you a yang male. You would
then follow the instructions given below to determine your 10-year luck periods. How-
ever, if Jia Wu describes your year pillar and you are female, then you must follow the
instructions pertaining to a yin male or yang female.
Step 1: Counting your birthday as “1,” count forward to the last day of the Chinese solar
month in which you were born. How many days is it? Let’s use Princess Diana as an
example. She is a yin female. The year 1961 is a Xin Chou year. Xin Chou’s polarity is yin
(see the Cycle of Sixty Table 3, number 38, in Chapter 22). Count forward until the last
day of the solar month she was born into. So, referring to Table 5 (the Month Pillar
charts), locate the fifth month of 1961 (Jia Wu). Notice the next solar month after her
July 1 birthday begins on July 7 (Yi Wei). Counting July 1, six days remain in the fifth
solar month (July 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 = 6 days). July 7,
the beginning of the sixth month, is not
counted.
Step 2: Divide the number of days by three. If
there is a remainder, round the answer up to the
next whole number. The result is the age when
your first 10-year luck period begins. If the result
is “0,” your luck begins at birth. Ten years old is
the latest your luck period can begin.
But what of the years prior to when your luck
begins? The auspiciousness—luck or fortune—of
these years is determined by your month pillar,
particularly the earthly branch phase. This com-
ponent is called the Parents Palace. Until your first
luck period begins, you are under the care of your
321
The Parents Palace is
represented by the phase combi-
nation of your month pillar. You
are governed by this combina-
tion until your luck period begins.
This combination also represents
your family background. If the
combination is favorable to your
Day-Master, your childhood more
than likely was happy. If the com-
bination is unfavorable to your
Day-Master, you probably had
an unhappy childhood.

parents as described by the phase in this palace and its relationship to your Day-Master
(which we discussed in Chapter 23, “The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 2”).
Continuing with our Diana example, step 1’s calculation yielded 6 days. So, 6 ÷ 3 = 2. Her
luck begins at age 2. 
Note: if there’s no remainder (as in Diana’s case), your luck changes every 10 years on
your birthday. If the remainder is 1, drop the remainder. Your luck changes 120 days after
your birthday and all subsequent birthdays every 10 years. If there’s a remainder of 2,
round this up to the next whole number (3). In this case, your first 10-year luck period
begins 120 days before your third birthday and changes 120 days before your thirteenth,
twenty-third, thirty-third birthday, and so forth. If the result is “0,” your luck begins at
birth.
Step 3: Based on the age your luck begins, each 10-year luck period begins 10 years after
the previous one. It is customary to write these pillars from right to left. Thus, in Diana’s
case, her 10-year luck periods are as follows:
322

Using the empty chart we’ve provided on the following page, fill in this portion of your
10-year luck chart.
Step 4: The next question is, what stem and branch do you assign to each of these peri-
ods? You begin with your month pillar. Princess Diana’s month pillar is Jia Wu. Next, find
its position in the Cycle of Sixty Table 3 in Chapter 22. Jia Wu is number 31. You must
now go to the next stem-branch combination in the
cycle of 60. So, Yi Wei, number 32, represents Diana’s
first 10-year luck period. For each 10-year luck period
that follows, move forward one position in the cycle 
of 60.
Step 5: Finally, consulting the Ten Heavenly Stems
Table 1 and the Twelve Earthly Branches Table 2 in
Chapter 22, write down each stem-branch phase.
Diana’s finished chart reads as follows.
Now use the following blank chart to complete your
own 10-year luck periods.
For yang males and yin
females only: To ensure an accu-
rate calculation, count your birth-
day as “1” and count forward to
the last day of the solar month
you were born into. For example,
if July 7 marks the beginning of
the new month, July 6 is the last
day counted.

Yin Male or Yang Female, Please Step Forward
If you are a yin male or a yang female, follow these simple steps to determine your 10-
year luck periods. (Again, you can determine your yin and yang polarity by consulting the
Cycle of Sixty Table 3 in Chapter 22.)
Step 1: Counting your birthday as “1,” count backward from the day of your birth to the
first day of the Chinese solar month into which you were born. How many days is it? Let’s
take a yin male born July 26, 1975. (1975 is a Yi Mao year. According to the Cycle of Sixty
Table 3, Yi Mao is Yin.) July 7 marks the solar month (Gui Wei) of his birth, the sixth
month under 1975. From July 26 to July 7 there are 20 days.
Step 2: Divide the number of days by three. If
there is no remainder, the result is the age
when your first 10-year luck period begins. If
the remainder is “1,” drop the remainder. Your
luck changes 120 days after your birthday and all
subsequent birthdays every ten years. If the result
is “0,” your luck begins at birth. Ten years old is
the latest your luck period can begin. The years
prior to your first luck period are governed by
your month pillar, or Parents Palace. Continuing

Cycle of Sixty Table 3 in Chapter 22). Gui Wei is number 20. Now go to the previous
stem-branch combination in the cycle of 60: Ren Wu, number 19, represents the exam-
ple’s first 10-year luck period. For each 10-year luck period that follows, move one posi-
tion backward in the cycle of 60.
Step 5: Finally, consult the Ten Heavenly Stems Table 1 and the Twelve Earthly Branches
Table 2 in Chapter 22 and write down each stem-branch phase. The example’s chart reads
as follows:

Chapter 24: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 3
Wheel of Fortune
In a nutshell, if a 10-year luck period consists of your favorable phase(s), then that decade
should prove fortunate. Is it really as simple as this? Let’s break it down in terms of stems
and branches. The earthly branch represents the foundation, stability; the heavenly stem,
the prevailing qi for that 10-year period. It’s important to note that while the stem’s qi
force acts quickly, the branch is more persistent. Stated another way, in the beginning of
the 10-year cycle, luck is influenced mainly by the stem. The branch’s influence is gradual.
At the end of the cycle, the branch is more influential than the stem.
There are four possible combinations, all yielding an effect appropriate to the structure of
your Four Pillars chart. They are … 
1. Favorable stem, favorable branch. You are basically fortunate and influenced by
favorable qi.
2. Favorable stem, unfavorable branch. You are generally unlucky, but there is favor-
able qi to change that from time to time.
3. Unfavorable stem, favorable branch. You are basically fortunate, but there is unfa-
vorable qi to disturb you from time to time.
4. Unfavorable stem, unfavorable branch. You are basically unlucky; you are often
subjected to the influence of unfavorable qi.
Before you set out to interpret your 10-year luck periods, let’s fine-tune this general
analysis. The nature of what will unfold depends on the kind of favorable/unfavorable
stem-branch configuration for any given period. For example, let’s take a resource/
resource combination for a strong chart. This is an unfavorable/unfavorable combination,
suggesting overindulgence and greed. Although things come easily to this person, he is
probably spoiled rotten and would be unable to stand on his own two feet if forced to
fend for himself. He’s much more interested in taking than giving. Another unfavorable/
unfavorable combination for a strong chart is parallel/parallel, suggesting a period of
fierce competition. You’ll most likely have
to claw your way to the top. Unlike the first
scenario, nothing will come easy in this 10-
year period.
So you see, knowing the kind of qi is inte-
gral to how your free will can shape your
destiny. If you knew in advance what the
next 10-year luck period could bring, wouldn’t
you take precautions? Of course you would.
Wouldn’t you carry an umbrella in anticipation of
an impending storm? If you calculate a strong
resource/resource period for your son, wouldn’t
325
An unfavorable stem and unfa-
vorable branch does not mean
a 10-year sentence of disaster,
misfortune, and illness without
possibility of peace, comfort,
and happiness. Just like yin and
yang cannot exist without a hint
of each other’s opposing charac-
teristic, so, too, can’t misfortune
exist without moments of fortune.

Your Sixty Cycle’s Destiny
While you’re at it, why don’t you determine the auspiciousness of each of the 60 stem-
branch components? In the end, this exercise will prove much more fruitful than, say, 
watching The Brady Bunch reruns. In any case, you’ll
need to know this information to construct your own
daily horoscope in the following chapter.
Simply indicate if the stem-branch phase is favorable or
unfavorable for you, then write in each phase’s relation-
ship to your Day-Master.
Now you can better analyze each of the years inside a
10-year luck period. You’ll notice a fortunate 10-year
period is destined to carry mostly favorable yearly qi.
Conversely, an unfortunate 10-year period will hold
mostly unfavorable qi.

you take care not to spoil him, enabling him to be an independent adult? If you calculate
you’re in a strong parallel/parallel period, wouldn’t you look extra hard for any and all
available angles? Wouldn’t knowing your possible destiny give you an edge? We hope it
will. We hope you will use the Four Pillars to your advantage.
It Was a Very Good Year
Ten years is an awfully long time. A lot can happen. Marriage or divorce, promotion or
unemployment, birth or death. It’s difficult to be mindful of what a luck period brings.
Can it be broken down into smaller increments? Sure! Not only can you analyze the aus-
piciousness of a 10-year period, you can also determine your luck on a yearly, monthly,
daily, and even hourly basis. (Although we won’t get into the minutia of calculating hourly
luck, we’ll help you determine your monthly and daily luck prospects in the next chapter.)
To determine your yearly luck, simply compare your favorable and unfavorable phases to
the year’s stem and branch in question. For example, 2002 is a Ren Wu (see the Year
Pillar Table 4 in Chapter 22), or water/fire year. The year 2003 is a Gui Wei or water/
earth year. In the space provided, indicate if the year’s stem and branch are favorable or
unfavorable for you by using a plus sign (+) for favorable, a minus sign (–) for unfavorable.
Then write in each phase’s relationship to your Day-Master (resource, parallel, perform-
ance, power, wealth).
326
Remember, a strong chart’s
favorable phases are perform-
ance, power, and wealth; 
its unfavorable phases are
resource and parallel. A weak
chart’s favorable phases are
resource and parallel; its unfavor-
able phases are performance,
power, and wealth.

The Cycle of 60 Favorability Chart.

The Fate of Princess Diana, Part 2
Let’s reexamine Princess Diana’s luck chart. In the last chapter, we determined her favor-
able phase is water (resource); metal (power) is favorable, too, but only if accompanied by
water (otherwise metal is unfavorable). Her unfavorable phases are earth (wealth) and fire
(performance). Wood (parallel) is considered neutral. With this in mind, let’s analyze each
of Diana’s 10-year luck periods.
◆2-11: Wood and earth. A neutral/unfavorable combination. Referring to her Four
Pillars chart we constructed in Chapter 22, notice the month pillar, or Parents
Palace, is represented by the earth phase. You have learned in this chapter an unfa-
vorable phase in this position usually suggests an unhappy childhood. Also, earth
represents the foundation of her first 10-year luck period, further depriving her of
much-needed parental support through her formative years. Wood, the prevailing qi
for this period, suggests competition from her siblings.
◆12-21: Fire and metal. An unfavorable/favorable combination. Metal, her branch
phase for this period, provides stability. Although beyond our scope here, there are
traces of water hidden in her Shen (metal) branch. This small amount works won-
ders, particularly beginning in 1978. Her life becomes more enjoyable; there is more
control. Diana was married in 1981. The prevailing qi, fire, is unfavorable as it
slowly dries up the traces of water hidden in the branch. It shows she has the wis-
dom to overcome the control of her family. Nonetheless, this is draining her energy.
◆22-31: Fire and metal. An unfavorable/unfavorable combination. The difference
here is metal, the foundation for the 10-year period. It is not accompanied by water,
making it an unfavorable phase. Although fire causes Diana to become more radiant
and vibrant—the fairy-tale princess and world humanitarian—in reality, she is a
humiliated wife. She is lonely and helpless as expressed by fire burning away wood
(parallel).
◆32-41: Earth and earth. An unfavorable/unfavorable combination. Without water
to support her, the wealth (earth) phase is not favorable. Earth gives energy to the
power (metal) phase only to irritate her further. The year 1995 is a turning point. Yi
(wood) Hai (water) provided Diana with the resources and assistance to be coura-
geous enough to tell the world she was an unfaithful and scorned wife. The next
year, Bing (fire) Zi (water) provided her with wisdom and courage to negotiate her
divorce. In 1997, Ding (fire) Chou (earth), Diana met her most unfavorable phases.
Earth controlled her traces of water hidden in the year branch Chou. Fire burned
and exhausted her wood, further enhancing the earth. Although earth represents
wealth, it weakened her. At one time she was very emotionally and physically weak.
Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
328

Chapter 24: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 3
329
Princess Diana died on August 31, 1997. The year, month, and day pillars are respectively,
Ding (fire) Chou (earth), Wu (earth) Shen (metal), and Yi (wood) Si (fire). The branches
form a productive chain (fire-earth-metal) ending with the unfavorable power (metal)
phase. Also, the stems form a productive chain (wood-fire-earth) ending in the unfavor-
able wealth (earth) phase. Her weak wood (Day-Master) is completely destroyed by metal.
Does it mean she had to die? Well, not necessarily. There can be found worse days in the
calendar. But, unfortunately, August 31 was a bad enough day for her.
Had Princess Diana survived this unfortunate decade, she would have gone into extensive
periods of good luck. Her next 10-year period (age 42 to 51) would have been earth/water,
or unfavorable/favorable. The foundation, water, would have nourished her weak Day-
Master, giving her strength to manage her wealth, the unfavorable earth. Beginning at age
52, she would have entered a metal/water period, or favorable/favorable. Again, the foun-
dation is most favorable. Metal is also favorable because it is accompanied by water. Since
metal is power to wood, it suggests a happy marriage.
Could Diana have survived the accident if proper advice about her Four Pillars of Destiny
were available to her? This is something we’ll never know. In theory, if she had stuck to
someone whose Four Pillars have a lot of water, it could have saved her. Unfortunately,
this man was her former husband, the Prince of Wales! His Four Pillars contain a tremen-
dous amount of water.
The Least You Need to Know
◆The Chinese believe luck is a function of time and that it is determinable.
◆When your 10-year luck period begins is determined by your gender and yin and
yang polarity of your year pillar.
◆If a period contains your favorable phases, the 10 years are likely to be fortunate. If a
period contains your unfavorable phases, it will probably be an unfortunate decade.
◆A more exacting analysis is to determine how the kind of qi will influence your well-
being so that you can take proper precautions.
◆Princess Diana’s first three luck periods were unfortunate. Had she survived, great
fortune awaited her.

Let’s face it, most of us like to check out our fate. Be it in the newspaper, TV
Guide, or popular magazines, we can’t wait to see what’s in store for us. We’re
delighted when the general message brings good tidings. We’re cautious when
it’s foreboding. We know the prediction is a generality, a one-size-fits-all
statement. Nevertheless, we keep it in the back of our mind.
In this chapter, we teach you how to construct your daily horoscope. Though
not the same as consulting a professional Chinese or Western astrologer, what
you’ll find here are specifics based on the strength of your chart and the con-
figuration of your favorable and unfavorable phases.
Chapter

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
What’s in a Horoscope?
Let’s say you’re a salesperson. Although you conduct work mostly from your office, you
call on clients and wine and dine them when you need to close a deal. If you had available
a calendar describing your most auspicious, so-so, and unfavorable days, wouldn’t you use
this information to your advantage? Or say you’re a police officer, teacher, or doctor.
Wouldn’t you want to know that you’re in for a bad day, one bringing potentially unfavor-
able qi? Maybe nothing will happen, but you’ll be on guard, ready to meet unexpected
events. The point is, let qi work for you. How else can knowing your favorable and unfa-
vorable phases help you? You’ll know …
◆When to sign important documents.
◆The best days to travel.
◆When to celebrate.
◆An auspicious day to get married.
◆The best days to invest, buy a lottery ticket, or gamble.
◆When to stay home or take a day off.
◆When to ask for a raise or a promotion.
◆The most auspicious days to display your talent.
◆The best days to ask for assistance, support, or advice.
There’s no end to the benefits. Intrigued? In order to make sense of the rest of this chap-
ter, you must already have completed the Cycle of 60 Favorability Chart in Chapter 24,
“The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 3.” That done, let’s move on.
That Was Then, This Is Now
Starting now, take stock of each day. Keep a diary. Compare what has unfolded each day,
each month, and each year to what your favorable and unfavorable phases destine. Does a
pattern emerge? Before long you’ll have memorized what each of the 60 stem-branch
combinations means to you. You’ll consult your calendar regularly and plan your activities
accordingly. We promise this method is a lot more accurate than calling a psychic hotline,
or being inspired by any generalized material, including even the Chinese zodiac that we
discussed in Chapter 21, “Introducing the Twelve Animals of the Chinese Zodiac.”
For your convenience, we’ve categorized how a chart of strength and weakness will fare
for each stem-branch combination. Use it as a reference, a starting point. Although we’ve
described a generality, it’s appropriate to the stem-branch combination for that of a strong
and weak chart. Therefore, the prediction is much more specific than otherwise. Remem-
ber, a + indicates that the stem or branch in question is favorable to your Day-Master. 
A – indicates the stem or branch is unfavorable to your Day-Master.

Now that you understand how each stem-branch combination can affect you, turn back to
the Cycle of 60 Favorability Chart in Chapter 24. Become familiar with what Jia Zi or
wood/water (the first in the cycle of 60) means to you. Maybe wood is your resource;
water your parallel. If your chart is strong, this would be an unfavorable/unfavorable com-
bination. If your chart is weak, it is a favorable/favorable combination. Maybe wood is
your performance; water your parallel. This is a favorable/unfavorable combination for a
chart of strength; an unfavorable/favorable combination for a weak chart. Get the idea?
Oh, What a Month!
So far, you’ve determined the auspiciousness of your 10-year period and what kind of qi
the year may bring. Now, let’s take it down a notch. To determine the auspiciousness of a
particular month, simply refer to Table 5 (the Month Pillar charts) in Chapter 22. In the
space provided in the following Solar Months chart (we’ve left this blank for you to fill
in), first note the month in question on the top line. On the second and third lines, indi-
cate the month’s corresponding phases. In the boxes, use + or – to indicate a phase’s favor-
ability: 
◆If it’s a +/+ month, put a + in the solar month box.
◆If it’s a –/– month, put a – in the box.
◆If it’s a +/– or a –/+ month, meaning an okay or average period, put a check mark in
the box.

Then indicate each phase’s relationship to your Day-Master (resource, parallel, intelli-
gence, power, wealth). As an example, here’s how January 2003 correlates to one person’s

You might think the best time to take a vacation is during a –/– month. Why
put your job or business at risk during an inauspicious time? Actually, it’s more benefi-

unharmonious relations don’t make for an enjoyable holiday.
Feng Alert
Now, it’s your turn. Use the example’s information as a model only!
Take a look at what you’ve just completed. How many favorable months will you be
graced with? How many unfavorable months will you be subjected to? Remember, take
notes. Got a raise? Met someone special? Jot it down. Then compare what’s transpired to
what was destined.

Part 7: Fate or Free Will: What’s Your Destiny?
Around and Around We Go: Determining a New 
Sixty-Day Cycle
Assembling your daily horoscope is a snap. To find out the stem-branch combination
marking the beginning of each month, you’ll need to consult the Year Number Table 7
and the example’s Cycle of Sixty Days, Table 8, from Chapter 22. For instance, take
January 2003. According to the Year Number table, 2003 corresponds with the year num-
ber 11. Moving over to the example’s Table 8, 11 corresponds with Jia Xu (or wood
earth), the first day of January 2003. To determine the following days, simply refer to the
Cycle of 60 Favorability Chart from Chapter 24. If January 1 is a Jia Xu day (number 11
in the cycle of 60), then January 2 is a Yi Hai, wood water, day (number 12 in the cycle of
60); January 3 is a Bing Zi, fire water, day (number 13 in the cycle of 60).
If January 1, 2003, equals number 11, how many days are there until the next cycle be-
gins? The answer is 50: 11 + 50 = 61, or number one in the cycle of 60. Fifty days from
January 1 is February 20. This satisfies the Day Pillar Table 6 (see Chapter 22). Day num-
ber 50 corresponds to February 20, April 21, June 20, August 19, October 18, and De-
cember 17. Learning this technique is a good way of staying on track. One error leads to
a misjudging of the day, which may lead to misfortune. Who wants that?
338
In a leap year, the dates corresponding to the day number in the Day Pillar
Table 6 will be off by one. For example, the year 2004 is a leap year. January 1,
2004, is a Ji Mao or earth wood day—number 16 in the cycle of 60. Forty-five days
remain until the next cycle begins. So, January 1 + 45 days = February 15, the first Jia
Zi day of the year. Because of the leap year, the next cycle begins on April 15. Each
new cycle follows on June 14, August 13, October 12, and December 11, a day ear-
lier than what is indicated on the chart. 
Feng Alert
Day by Day
The question arises: Now that I’ve determined what kind of day January 1, 2003, is (Jia
Xu), what day of the week does it begin on? Good question. Simply refer to the following
table. First, find the year in question. Then, run your finger along the row to find the
number 1, January. January corresponds with template number 3. Consulting the blank
template charts 1 through 7, you’ll see that template 3 begins on a Wednesday. For
February and March 2003, you’d use template 6; for April use template 2; for May use
template 4, for June use template 7; and so forth. Get the idea?

Chapter 25: The Four Pillars of Destiny, Part 4
To complete each day, refer to the Cycle of 60 Favorability Chart in Chapter 24. In each
day box, indicate its auspiciousness. A +/+ gets a +, a –/– gets a –, a +/– or –/+ gets a check
mark. To simplify the daily calendar, you may just want to indicate the cycle of 60 number
and the corresponding stem-branch phases. For example, the January 1, 2003, box would
look like this:

Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and feng shui.
Flying Star
Xuankong Feixing in Chinese, it’s a sophisticated and complex system of
analyzing how time and space affect a building. The magnetic orientation of the dwelling,
along with the year the home was built, are important factors that determine the innate

day, and hour expressed as a heavenly stem and an earthly branch. The Four Pillars of
Destiny measures probabilities, not certainties, of your life’s path.
Golden Ratio
Related to the Fibonacci sequence. By dividing each number in the series
by the one that precedes it, the result produces a ratio that stabilizes at 1.61834. The
Golden Ratio was understood by ancient builders such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and
Mayans who believed everything in nature was determined by abstract universal laws that
could be expressed mathematically.
Great Cycle
Called Da Yun in Chinese, it is made up of nine 20-year cycles. The nine
cycles are divided into three 60-year periods called the Upper (Shang Yuan), Middle
(Zhong Yuan), and Lower (Xia Yuan) Cycles. The year 1864 marks the beginning of the
Great Cycle we’re currently in. It ends February 4, 2044.

(yin) dots said to be found inscribed on a turtle’s shell. The Luoshu correlates to the After
Heaven sequence of trigrams.
Magic Square of Three
Related to the Luoshu. It is considered “magical” because
three cells add up to fifteen along any diagonal, vertical, or horizontal line. The Magic
Square is the numerological basis of feng shui.
Marriage Palace
A term relating to the Four Pillars of Destiny. It corresponds to your
day-branch. If the phase is favorable, your marriage will be successful. If the phase is unfa-
vorable, then chances are slim your marriage will survive.
mountain force
Associated with yin, it administers a person’s health and relationships.
Its qi enters a home through the walls, the building’s mountainlike structures protecting
the occupants. In classical feng shui terminology, the mountain star is synonymous with

heavens, earth, and humanity. It is also called “life’s breath.”
reductive cycle
A cycle that reduces the power of the dominating phase and restores
the sequential balance of the phases in question. Fire-wood-water-metal-earth represents
the reductive cycle. In feng shui, a reductive phase is used to remedy inauspicious qi.
resource
One of five ways a phase relates to the Day-Master in a Four Pillars of
Destiny analysis. A resource phase produces the Day-Master.
349

Appendix A
Reversed Mountain and Water
A dwelling that is considered Shang Shan Xia Shui if
the mountain and water stars are improperly placed, reversed. Here, the ruling mountain
star is improperly located in the facing cell. The ruling water star is improperly located in
the sitting cell. A Reversed Mountain and Water star chart brings the probability of mis-
fortune and illness for the 20-year period to which the ruling star corresponds.
sha qi

few chances to demonstrate his own talents.
subconscious mind
This is the area of the mind that receives and stores information.
The subconscious mind represents 88 percent of our total mind power.

A universal symbol generally accepted to be a solar emblem. It is derived from
the Sanskrit svastika, meaning lucky, fortunate, well-being. The counterclockwise swastika
formed within the Magic Square expresses future time.
synchronicity
A concept developed by celebrated Swiss psychologist Carl Jung (1875–
1961), it expresses the connection of acausal events within a limited time frame.
taiji
A symbol illustrating the eternal interaction between yin and yang. The correct ori-
entation is with its yang “head” positioned at the top-left side.
Ten Heavenly Stems
Tian Gan in Chinese, they represent how the five phases alter
with the passage of a year. The Chinese use the word “heaven” to mean “time.” Hence,
the Heavenly Stems record how qi changes with time.
totem
An Algonquin word describing an animal or natural object with which a group
feels a special attachment. Denoting group membership, the totem is worshipped by the
members of the clan bearing its name.
trigram

mental trigrams: Each trigram constitutes 45 degrees of the compass (8 trigrams × 45
degrees = 360 degrees). Each trigram is subdivided into three equal parts of 15 degrees
each (3 parts × 15 degrees = 45 degrees). The total number of subdivided parts (3 parts ×
8 trigrams) comprise the 24 mountains, each of which has a Chinese name.
unfavorable phase
A term in a Four Pillars of Destiny analysis describing a phase that
causes an imbalance in your chart.
unknown
A unit of communication that is rejected by the critical area of the mind and
will not enter the subconscious.
water force

through the windows and doors, the building’s free-flowing waterlike edifices. The water
star is synonymous with the facing star and the stars on the top, right side of each cell. 
weak Day-Master
A Four Pillars of Destiny chart with more power, performance, and
wealth than resource and parallel. A person with a weak Day-Master is usually being chal-
lenged by power and authority, yet has enough intelligence to combat such confronta-
tions.
wealth

analysis. The wealth phase is dominated by the Day-Master.

Common Questions and
Practical Answers
Q: What exactly is feng shui?
A: Feng shui is the art and science of determining how the environment and
your home affect you over periods of time. Feng shui can predict, prevent,
and encourage events with great accuracy.
Q: Are there certain telltale factors that distinguish a classical-trained practi-
tioner from one who uses modern techniques based on superstition and myth?
A: Yes. Simply, ask questions! First ask what kind of feng shui he or she prac-
tices. The answer should be classical or traditional Feng Shui. If the answer is
Bagua School or Compass School, this could mean the consultant practices
faux feng shui, where a home is divided into sections of wealth, health, family,
career, etc. This method is too simplistic. Please see Chapter 1, “What Is
Feng Shui?” for a review about authentic and faux schools of feng shui.
Q: I heard feng shui is a Daoist art. Is this true?
A: No. The philosophy of Daoism and the science of feng shui developed 
at the same time and share common roots. Although feng shui’s origins are
lost in history, the tradition actually predates Daoism, Buddhism, and Con-
fucianism by several thousand years. As early as 6000 B.C.E., some sort of
astronomical/astrological system was used to determine auspicious grave and
dwelling sites.
Appendix

Appendix B
Q: Do you need a compass to practice feng shui?
A: Yes. Just like a hair stylist needs a pair of scissors and a doctor needs a stethoscope, a
feng shui practitioner needs a compass. But it doesn’t have to be a Chinese luopan. A
Western-style compass featuring two-degree gradations is sufficient. Without a compass,
it’s impossible to determine your home’s trigram. Guesswork just won’t do. Obtaining an
accurate reading is the first step toward ensuring an accurate analysis. An incorrect as-
sumption may cause harm to you and your family. For example, you wouldn’t want your
hair stylist to assume he or she has selected “Bombshell Blond”—your hair color. You
would expect him or her to be certain. Furthermore, you would expect the stylist to have
read and know the procedure thoroughly. Otherwise, your hair might fall out!
Q: Can feng shui really bring me health, wealth, and happiness?
A: Feng shui can only increase the probability of these things happening. For example, a
Flying Star reading may indicate good fortune, but it’s up to you to make it happen. Feng
shui can only create an urge, increasing your motivation and likelihood of success. Feng
shui is not a cure-all solution.
Q: Can you flush your wealth away if a toilet lid is left open?
A: Only if you empty your wallet into the bowl!
Q: Where’s the best place to hang a mirror?
A: Historically, the use of mirrors to remedy qi has never been part of feng shui’s tradi-
tion. The concept of mirrors as magical power devices that can stimulate, ward off, or
absorb qi is a recent invention dating to the 1980s. This misconception is an excellent
example of playing “telephone”—the childhood game where one kid whispers a sentence
in the next kid’s ear. At the end of the line, the sentence bears no resemblance to the orig-
inal.
In ancient China, mirrors were made of bronze, polished on one side, with various cos-
mological designs on the other. These mirrors were similar to the precursor of the luopan
compass, an ancient divination tool called the shipan, which was thought to reflect, or
mirror, the perfect world before the demon Gong Gong battled Zhu Rong for the Em-
pire. During the fight, the northwest mountain (one of eight separating heaven from
earth) collapsed, causing the northwest to tilt upward, and the southeast, downward. As a
model of the perfect world, the ancient cosmographs and bronze mirrors were thought to
have magic power. Somehow, they have been mistakenly incorporated into feng shui. 
354

Common Questions and Practical Answers
Q: There are so many books and classes on feng shui. How do I know who’s right?
A: It’s up to you to search for the truth. Unfortunately, the ancient Chinese tradition of
feng shui has been watered down and misrepresented. In large part, this is due to people
not doing their homework. Our advice is to go directly to source material. Thumb
through Joseph Needham’s seven-volume work, Science and Civilisation in China. Check
out scholarly material at the library or on the Internet. You do the homework. You decide
fact from falsehood. Please see Appendix C, “Learn More About Feng Shui,” for a credi-
ble list of reading material and websites of classical feng shui.
Q: When determining the construction year of a dwelling, how do you treat additions to a
house?
A: The only reliable source is from Qing dynasty (1644–1911) feng shui master, Shen Zhu
Reng’s book, Shen’s Time and Space School (Shen Shi Xuan Kong Xue). He says if the new
and old parts are connected so that the qi can flow freely, and the main entrance is in the
new part, then the whole house is considered new. Therefore, use the construction date
affiliated with the addition. On the other hand, if the main entrance is in the old part of
the house, then the whole house is considered old. In this case, use the original construc-
tion date of the house. If there is a door in the new addition, but the old entrance is re-
tained and both doors are used, then the old part is old and the new part is new. Two
Flying Star charts must be drawn.
Q: When determining the construction year of a dwelling, how do you treat a house
whose roof was completely changed?
A: This is controversial. If the roof is removed and the inside of the dwelling is exposed
for at least 24 hours, the house is considered new. Yet, some classical masters believe the
roof must be exposed for one month, with a full moon shining on the floor. We’ll go with
the first scenario.

Chinese Periods and
Dynasties
Chinese history is a fascinating discipline—rich, complex, and exhaustive.
Remember, the Chinese have had flourishing civilizations for thousands of
years. Looking at feng shui without even a rudimentary understanding of
some historical basis is unwise. So much is inextricably woven into particular
periods, events, and individuals. Throughout this book we have referred to
individuals, dates, and dynasties. We hope this list will compare some of feng
shui’s evolutions with that of Chinese history. Please note, while it appears
some dynasties may overlap, in fact, they do not. Only a thorough investiga-
tion of Chinese history can adequately account for this. 
The dates reflecting China’s legendary and prehistoric periods, and the dynas-
tic dates of the Shang early Zhou, are speculative and subject to dispute.

Learn More About Taking a
Proper Compass Reading
Using the 24 Mountains
Once you get the hang of it, taking an accurate compass reading and dividing
your dwelling into eight equal sections is a snap. First, follow the directions
below to determine the sitting and facing directions of your house:
1. Stand in front of your house or unit, the side corresponding to the fac-
ing side. Make sure your back is perfectly square with the house.
2. Holding your compass at waist level, rotate the compass dial until the
red portion of the magnetic arrow aligns with north.
3. Read the compass grade at the index line (labeled the “bearing” line on
the Silva Explorer Model 203). This is the facing direction. The grade
magnetically opposite is the sitting direction.
4. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3, taking a reading at two other locations parallel
to the sitting side of your home as indicated by illustrations B and C.
Appendix

Appendix E
In the following example (A) of an apartment unit, the compass grade at the index line
reads 210°. If you’re using Eight House methodology, according to the table in Chapter
11, “The Eight Houses, Part 2,” your dwelling belongs to the Gen trigram (facing 202.5°
to 247.5°). If you’re using Flying Star, you must determine what kind of Gen house 
you have: Chou, Gen, or Yin. Referring to the table in Chapter 14, “The Flying Stars,
Part 2,” the dwelling belongs to the mountain Chou (202.5° to 217.5°). The unit sits NE1
and faces SW1.

A properly divided Gen dwell-
ing 
NE1 and 
SW1
at 210°.
Now, follow these steps to divide your floor plan into eight equal sections corresponding
to the eight fundamental directions (trigrams):
1. Note the facing degree on your floor plan (as illustrated).
2. With a pencil, mark the point where each of the eight directions begin and end (as
illustrated). We suggest using a clear plastic 6-inch, 360° protractor with half-inch

Learn More About Taking a Proper Compass Reading Using the 24 Mountains
gradations to help with this task. Found in any office supply store, we recommend
the Mars College protractor. But be careful! Read the inside grades which ascend
around the circular instrument. Before you proceed, it might be a good idea to com-
pare the protractor with the figure of the simplified luopan compass in Chapter 14.
(If you wish to purchase a luopan, please contact Joseph Yu at josephyu@astro-
fengshui.com.)
3. Now, connect the dots to form eight equal sections.
Illustration B shows the same apartment sitting NE2 and facing SW2 at 225°.

A properly divided Gen dwell-
ing 
NE2 and 
SW2
at 225°.
Illustration C shows the same apartment sitting NE3 and facing SW3 at 240°.

Appendix E
Taken together, you can see that depending on the facing degree, the sections are ori-
ented somewhat differently for each of the three types of Gen dwellings (mountains
Chou, Gen, and Yin).
