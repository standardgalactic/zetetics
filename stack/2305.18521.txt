We present a new avenue to black hole evaporation using a heat-kernel approach analogous as for
the Schwinger effect. Applying this method to an uncharged massless scalar field in a Schwarzschild
spacetime, we show that spacetime curvature takes a similar role as the electric field strength in
the Schwinger effect. We interpret our results as local pair production in a gravitational field and
derive a radial production profile. The resulting emission peaks near the unstable photon orbit.
Comparing the particle number and energy flux to the Hawking case, we find both effects to be of
similar order. However, our pair production mechanism itself does not explicitly make use of the
presence of a black hole event horizon.

Introduction.—According to quantum mechanics, a
vacuum state is populated by virtual particle pairs under-
going spontaneous creation and annihilation processes.
These quantum fluctuations can turn into real particle
pairs in the presence of a background field. The most
prominent example of such a process is the Schwinger ef-
fect predicting the creation of charged particle pairs in
the presence of an electric field [1, 2], see Refs. [3, 4] for
a review. According to the standard interpretation, the
particles of a spontaneously created virtual pair are accel-
erated in opposite directions by the external field. If the
particles separate far enough within the time granted to
them by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, i.e. if the
virtual particles gain enough energy over the distance of
a Compton wavelength to obey the relativistic energy–
momentum relation E2 = m2 + ⃗p2, they become real.
The threshold for the electric field strength to consider-
ably create electron–positron pairs via the Schwinger ef-
fect, ∼1018 V/m, currently lies out of experimental reach
for static configurations.
However, pair production by
strong electric fields may become accessible for instance
in high-intensity laser beams [5, 6], in the boosted elec-
tromagnetic field in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions,
or in exotic atoms where an atomic electron shell is oc-
cupied by a more massive particle, e.g. a muon [7]. In
condensed matter physics, a Schwinger-analog effect has
been discovered in graphene recently [8], see also [9, 10].
Particle production also occurs in black hole space-
times as predicted by Hawking [11, 12].
In a heuris-
tic explanation, it originates from virtual particle–anti-
particle pairs turning real: Close to the event horizon,
one particle might fall into the black hole preventing
a re-annihilation.
The outside particle contributes to
Hawking radiation [12]. A mathematical treatment of the

Hawking effect referring to quantum fluctuations is based
on the tunneling probability of positive-energy modes
outwards or negative-energy modes inwards through the
event horizon [13].
In general, derivations of the Hawking effect require
the existence of a future event horizon which is a global
concept requiring knowledge over the whole spacetime
also at late times. Furthermore they rely on time depen-
dence such as induced by matter infall forming an event
horizon or a coupling to an external thermal heat reser-
voir. According to Ref. [14], the global concept may be
relaxed to a local, observer-dependent requirement for
an apparent horizon.
Other processes of particle pro-
duction in curved spacetimes have been discussed within
cosmology (see e.g. [15, 16] and [17] for a review), small
time-dependent anisotropies ([18–20]) or arise from self-
interaction of the quantum field [21, 22]. In some of these
situations, no horizon is present.
Sometimes a heuristic connection between the Schwin-
ger and Hawking effect is drawn for illustrative purposes,
e.g. [23, sect. 12.8] and [24, sect. 1.7]. Previous studies
aiming to show such a connection in specific cases fol-
lowed the Hawking description in that they used so-called
Bogoliubov coefficients to construct effective actions con-
fined to the horizon of black holes [25–28] or focused on
tunneling through horizons [13, 29].
In this letter, we show the existence of a local gravi-
tational particle production mechanism in curved space-
times similar to the Schwinger effect for electric fields.
Virtual pairs are separated by local tidal forces and be-
come real. For black holes, some fraction of them will
escape to infinity while others will be recaptured, ac-
cording to the standard escape fraction for massless par-
ticles created near a black hole (see Fig. 1). Both the
Schwinger and our particle production effect arise as two
facets from the same mathematical object: the one-loop
effective action W in the heat-kernel representation [30].
Applied to a massless complex scalar in a homogeneous
electric background field, we re-obtain the Schwinger ef-

fect, i.e. we demonstrate that our formalism based on
the weak-field form of the heat kernel agrees with the
closed-form expression. Applied to a massless real scalar
in the Schwarzschild background gravitational field, the
predicted amount of particle production is comparable to
the a priori independent Hawking effect. Our approach
applies to general mass configurations and does not ex-
plicitly invoke the presence of an event horizon other than
for calculating an escape fraction.

particle production mechanism in a Schwarzschild
spacetime. The particle production event rate is highest
at small distances, whereas the escape probability
(represented by the increasing escape cone (white)) is
highest at large distances.
Particle production.—In the following, we investigate
the stationary production of real massless scalar parti-
cles by weak electric and gravitational background fields.
Going back to Schwinger [2], the associated vacuum non-
persistence rate is encoded in the imaginary part of the
one-loop effective action, which is defined as

in the Euclidean case with metric gEµν and can be Wick
rotated to Lorentzian signature in the case of a station-
ary spacetime. In the first line, the effective action is ex-
pressed in terms of the second-order elliptic differential
operator for the scalar field, H. We apply a zeta-function
regularization including a mass scale ˜µ and a parame-
ter z ∈C. The second line makes the interpretation in
terms of field excitations localized at x(τ) evident, which
classically would evolve according to H as the Hamilton
operator for a duration of the so-called proper time s. In
terms of the path integral, all excitation trajectories are
considered which start and end in the same point, and
are weighted according to the classical action [31],
Se[x(τ)] =

In the Lorentzian counterpart, a closed trajectory re-
quires the field excitation to move forward and backward
in the exterior time.
It can be interpreted as the vir-
tual creation and annihilation of a particle–anti-particle
pair [3] (represented by light gray trajectories in Fig. 1).
The sum of all particle–anti-particle paths, i.e. the
path integral in eq. (2), is also referred to as the coin-
cidence limit of the heat kernel. It can be factorized in a
purely classical contribution, exp(−m2s), and a contribu-
tion from fluctuations for which we utilize the Barvinsky–
Vilkovisky expansion [32]. This enables us to derive the
imaginary part of the Lorentzian effective action for a
massless scalar in the weak-field limit, which is described
in detail in Appendix S.1:

Here, N is the number of degrees of freedom, i.e. 1 for
a real and 2 for a complex scalar field, and ξ the grav-
itational coupling parameter. The Ricci scalar and ten-
sor are denoted by R and Rµν, and the Riemann tensor
by Rµ
νρσ.
The gauge-field curvature in electrodynam-
ics reads Ωµν = iqFµν/ℏ, which contributes only for a
charged, i.e. complex, scalar. As we show below, this ef-
fective action allows a unified description of the Schwin-
ger effect and our gravitational particle production mech-
anism.
Equation (4) allows us to directly calculate the Schwin-
ger effect, i.e. the vacuum instability rate density with
regard to the spontaneous creation of massless particles
in a homogeneous electric background field ⃗E. In Ap-
pendix S.2, we obtain 2Im(Leff) = (q ⃗E)2/96πℏ, where
Leff is the effective Lagrange density belonging to the ef-
fective action W. This result agrees with the work by
Euler and Heisenberg [1] and Schwinger [2] on electron–
positron pairs when generalized to a massless complex
scalar field (see also Ref. [33] for a generalization to mass-
less vector bosons in non-Abelian Yang–Mills theory, in
particular QCD).
Application to the Schwarzschild spacetime.—We can
now apply the same method to a quantum field in a
curved black hole spacetime.

totically flat, spherically symmetric, and static Schwarz-
schild spacetime in (3 + 1) dimensions,

where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass
of the black hole. Because of Ricci flatness, Rµν = 0, the
only non-vanishing contribution to the imaginary part of
the integrand of the effective action (4) stems from the
Kretschmann scalar RµνρσRµνρσ = 48 (GM)2/r6. Upon
spatial integration over the black hole exterior, which is
the spacetime region causally connected to outside ob-
servers (see the escape probability factor below), one
obtains for the effective Lagrange function Im(Leff) =
ℏ/1440 GM. This predicts a rate density of particle pro-
duction events of

720 GM ≈1.39 × 10−3 (GM)−1,
(6)
where the rate refers to subsequent slices of constant
Schwarzschild time t, the proper time for a static ob-
server at infinity.
Per event, an arbitrary number of particle pairs can
be produced, although in the majority of events only
one particle pair is created. As has been shown for the
Schwinger effect, the mean number of pairs can be ex-
tracted from the closed-form expression of the heat ker-
nel and is encoded by the first pole [34, 35]. Thus we can
define a pair-per-event correction factor
fPPE = (rate density of particle pairs)
(rate density of events)
= 12

(7)
in the bosonic Schwinger case. Because of the use of a
weak-field expansion for the heat kernel, we cannot dis-
tinguish individual pole contributions, but instead adopt
the factor fPPE for the gravitational particle production
mechanism. Then we find ∼3.38 × 10−3 (GM)−1 for the
total number rate of particles produced.
If produced at a larger distance, particles are less likely
to be captured by the black hole (blue trajectories in
Fig. 1) than to escape to infinity (black). The capture
cone opening angle αcapt for lightlike geodesics as mea-
sured by a local static Schwarzschild observer is given
by [36]
sin2 αcapt = 27 (GM)2 (1 −2GM/r)

(8)
and sketched in blue in the lower panel of Fig. 1. Under
the assumption of isotropic emission for such an observer,
we define the escape probability fesc = (1 + cos αcapt) /2.
Taking these factors into account, Fig. 2 displays the ra-
dial distribution of the origin of particles which reach
infinity per unit step in Schwarzschild time t. The dis-
tribution is non-zero throughout the black hole exterior
featuring a steep drop towards the Schwarzschild radius
and a power-law decrease at large distances. The high-
est production rate density for escaping particles occurs
around 2.32 GM while the highest number of particles
per spherical shell is produced at approx. 2.47 GM, which
is roughly half way between the event horizon and the
circular photon orbit at 3 GM. The total particle rate
observed at infinity is given by

FIG. 2: Radial profile of the production of particles
escaping to infinity per unit Schwarzschild time t.
In order to estimate the energy flux of the created par-
ticles at infinity, we infer the energy of a gravitationally
produced particle from comparison with the Schwinger
effect in two steps. First, we deduce the characteristic
amount of energy which a virtual particle gains dur-
ing the Schwinger production process.
It depends on
the electric field strength and amounts to ESchwinger =
(ℏ2 q2 ⃗E2)1/4 = ℏ(ΩµνΩµν/2)1/4 as obtained from the ex-
ponential term present in the closed-form expression of
Im(Leff), see eq. (S.28) in Appendix S.2. Second, we de-
rive a correspondence between electric and gravitational
field strengths based on requiring the same rate of par-
ticle production events. According to eq. (4), the gauge-
field expression ΩµνΩµν/12 leads to the same imaginary
part of the effective action as the gravitational expres-
sion RµνρσRµνρσ/180 as it reads for Ricci-flat space-
times. Thereby we obtain the formal replacement rule
ΩµνΩµν →2/30 × RµνρσRµνρσ, such that the character-
istic energy scale for the gravitational particle production
reads
Ecurv = ℏ(RµνρσRµνρσ/30)1/4.
(10)
In general, one can expect the characteristic energy scale
to carry most weight in the spectrum because lower-
energy particles have wavelengths too large to resolve the
spacetime curvature, and higher-energy particles perceive
the spacetime as flat because of the equivalence principle.
Taking into account the gravitational redshift, we obtain
for the energy flux
dE
dt ≈12.8 × 10−5 ℏ(GM)−2.
(11)
The characteristic energy scale can be represented in
a more intuitive way by associating it with an effective

4
temperature scale which we would obtain if the spectrum
was thermal. By matching to Ecurv the average energy of
particles in blackbody radiation, ⟨E⟩= π4/30ζ(3)×kBT,
we find for a static observer located at radial position r

In order to provide some context for the results from
our local gravitational particle production mechanism,
we contrast them with the properties of Hawking radi-
ation. Taking into account the gravitational redshift ef-

Around the distance of highest particle production, r ≈
2.5 GM, a stationary observer would measure the Hawk-
ing radiation to have the local (Tolman) temperature of
TH/√−g00 ≈138 nK, which is exceeded by the effec-
tive temperature from our effect by a factor ∼(1.9)1/4.
According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, this implies an
increased particle production rate by a factor of around
1.9. Independently, our predictions for the particle and
energy flux actually also lie within a factor ∼1.9 above
the Hawking fluxes, see Appendix S.3.
In contrast to radiation in the Hawking case, which is
in a thermal mixed state, the radiation in our case also
includes correlated pairs when the emission direction of
both the particle and anti-particle fall into the escape
cone. This is similar to the Schwinger effect, where the
produced particles do not follow a thermal spectrum [35].
We point out the favorable property that our results for
the total particle number and energy flux are expressed
only in terms of curvature invariants and thus are invari-
ant under coordinate transformations. However, they de-
pend on the radial profile of the escape probability, for
which we made two assumptions. First, we adopted a
measure in the geometrical-optics approximation, i.e. the
solid-angular size of the escape cone. This is a rather re-
liable assumption given the 6% accuracy in the DeWitt
approximation for the graybody factor discussed in Ap-
pendix S.3. Second, we made the assumption that the
emission of real particle–anti-particle pairs is isotropic
for a static observer. If we assumed an isotropic emission
in the frame of a freely infalling Painlev´e observer, the
distribution looks beamed towards the black hole for a
static observer and the particle flux would be reduced to
∼56% of the Hawking value. Actually one might expect
an anisotropic emission with a stronger radial component
because of the anisotropic spacetime curvature.
Discussion.—In this letter we have shown that the for-
malism underlying the Schwinger effect can be applied
to curved spacetimes, unifying the description of the de-
cay of electric and gravitational fields in the presence of
a scalar quantum field.
In our non-perturbative path-
integral approach, particle production arises from the
separation of virtual field excitations and is encoded in
the imaginary part of the one-loop effective action. The
effective action is defined by the trace of the propagation
operator which implies that the corresponding path inte-
gral in eq. (2) is performed only over paths with coinci-
dent start and end point. Such an event can be regarded
as the origin of a virtual particle–anti-particle pair, and
the associated path sections as the corresponding particle
trajectories.
Virtual particles can exist within a portion of space-
time that is constrained by the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle.
The weighted path densities around classi-
cal trajectories indicate the probability distribution of
a particle location, which one could call a “Heisenberg
uncertainty cloud.”
In flat spacetime, the volume of
these clouds is identical for a particle and anti-particle,
leading to complete annihilation. In curved spacetimes,
these clouds are not necessarily identical, as particle tra-
jectories pass through different portions of spacetime,
which suppresses the particles’ coherence, impacts their
annihilation probability and leads to the appearance
of real pairs.
Such particle decoherence effects occur-
ring in curved spacetimes may even be experimentally
testable [37].
Alternatively, the non-overlapping portions of the un-
certainty clouds between particle and anti-particle could
also be interpreted as being separated by an apparent
horizon, reminiscent of the horizon encountered by an
accelerating observer seeing Unruh radiation [38].
In a Ricci-flat spacetime, such as in asymptotically
flat black-hole spacetimes and in particular the Schwarz-
schild solution, the integrand given in eq. (4) reduces to
the square of the Weyl tensor Cµνρσ, i.e. RαβγδRαβγδ =
CαβγδCαβγδ. Because the Weyl tensor indicates volume-
preserving curvature components, it particularly encap-
sulates tidal forces. Hence, while in the Schwinger case
the electric field separates virtual pairs, this role is taken
on by tidal forces in gravitational fields, which act on all
types of particles (including photons) – not just charged
ones. The energy of the pairs produced ultimately has to
come from the gravitational field via its coupling to the
corresponding quantum field.
In analogy to the Schwinger effect in electric back-
ground fields, we use heat-kernel techniques for describ-
ing gravitational pair production. The action for the fic-
titious field excitation, Se, factorizes in a classical and a
fluctuating part. In the Schwinger case, this can be eval-
uated exactly and allows one to derive an expression of
particle production for massive and massless particles. In
contrast, no closed-form solution for the fluctuating part
is known to date in a gravitational background (see [39]
for a quadratic approximation). However, an expansion
in weak fields is known, see e.g. [32, 40], which enables

5
us to treat the massless case.
Massless particles are of special interest because they
dominate the black hole emission for most of the black
hole’s lifetime.
Only at the end of black hole evapo-
ration (below the mass scale of 1014 kg ∼10−16 M⊙,
corresponding to subatomic Schwarzschild radii below
10−12 m) do massive particles contribute a relevant share
to the radiation [41] before potential extra dimensions be-
come relevant [42]. Moreover, the scalar field considered
here is a generic model for one massless bosonic degree of
freedom, e.g. one polarization state of the photon (con-
formal coupling [43], ξ = 1/6) or of the graviton (minimal
coupling [44], ξ = 0). Interestingly, our results show that
the production rate is independent of the gravitational
coupling constant ξ in Ricci-flat spacetimes.
The particle production effect which we have presented
predicts within a factor ∼2 the same fluxes, effective
temperature, and their respective scalings with the black
hole mass as in the Hawking case, assuming thermal
emission.
It is not immediately clear whether this is
an additional effect to Hawking radiation or a general-
ization thereof. At least, for the radiation escaping be-
tween 2GM < r ≤3GM, the other half of the pair will
fall into the event horizon, similar to what is described
in the popular explanation of Hawking radiation. How-
ever, it is a local approach. The presence of a black hole
event horizon does not enter our derivation, apart from
the escape factor. This is in contrast to Hawking radi-
ation, where the presence of a global event horizon or
time dependence is considered vital. Among these, the
approaches by Parikh and Wilczek [13] and Mukhanov,
Wipf, and Zelnikov [45] have aspects in common with
our work. However, both these approaches inherently re-
quire the reduction to 1 + 1 dimensions and thus cannot
be sensitive to local anisotropies and tidal forces.
The popular description of Hawking radiation suggests
that most of the particle production happens at an in-
finitesimal distance from the event horizon.
For our
mechanism, we explicitly deduce a radial production pro-
file for evaporating black holes. Its peak is determined by
the counteraction of the rate of local pair creation and
the escape probability, see Fig. 1. The local, generally
covariant expression for the imaginary part of the effec-
tive action in eq. (4) actually indicates that this gravi-
tational particle production is independent of the choice
of the vacuum state of the quantum field. While there
might also be state-dependent contributions encoded in
the subleading higher-order behavior of the form factors,
those would in general be tied to non-local terms [46,
pp. 76, 178].
Similarly to Ref. [13], we also expect our particle pro-
duction mechanism to backreact on the spacetime. How-
ever, the spacetime background we have used here is con-
stant by construction which implicitly requires an exter-
nal energy reservoir, the thermal nature of which can
be debated as in the case of the Unruh effect [47, 48].
Clearly, if there is radiation without an external energy
reservoir, it means that the spacetime is non-stationary.
In consequence, this would imply that the black hole
evaporates indeed. In principle, the pair production pro-
cess should also continue inside the event horizon, but
this would not be observable outside. The process would
diverge at r = 0 and the associated backreaction could
potentially tame the curvature singularity in the center.
The weak-field assumptions of our work, however, would
not extend to this extrapolation.
Taken at face value, our local approach could imply
that also mass configurations without a global event hori-
zon would radiate and eventually decay. Furthermore,
evaporation processes might not necessarily lead to an
information paradox. For approaching these questions,
the entropy of the central object and thermal nature of
the emission are topics of further investigation.

Appendix S.1: Derivation of the Imaginary Part of the Massless Effective Action
Using heat kernel methods, we derive the imaginary part of the effective action for a massless scalar field in a
gravitational background. This is closely related to the works [49, 50] and references therein. However, in an attempt
to be as rigorous as possible, we give a derivation in Euclidean signature, i.e. on a Riemannian manifold, using an
exact expression for the heat trace obtained in covariant perturbation theory.
Consider the Euclidean action functional for a free real scalar field ϕ in D (even) dimensions,

where H = ℏ2∆+ m2 + ℏ2 ξR, with ∆= −∇µ∇µ, is a second-order elliptic differential operator. The mass is denoted
by m and the gravitational coupling parameter by ξ. For the effective action in a gravitational background with
Euclidean metric gE µν and Ricci scalar R, we integrate out the scalar field (so only treating the free scalar field as a
quantum field) and obtain the Euclidean 1-loop effective action

regularization schemes.) Note that the heat kernel Tr e−sH/ℏ2 is well-defined precisely because we are working in
Euclidean signature.
1.
Covariant Perturbation Theory
In [32], Barvinsky and Vilkovisky derived an expansion of the heat trace Tr e−s(∆+E) to any (finite) order in the
curvature that is exact in the spectral parameter s and in ∆, which was also derived more recently by alternative
methods in [40]. Up to second order in R, E, and the curvatures Rµν and Ωµν associated to ∆, this reads (in dimension
D = 4)

(S.10)
This expansion is determined up to topological terms which are proportional to the Pontryagin class
R∗R∗= R2 −4RµνRµν + RµνρσRµνρσ.
(S.11)
Similar to Ref. [55], we restore these terms by comparing the leading behavior of the form factors at small s to
the Seeley–DeWitt heat kernel expansion, see e.g. Refs. [56, Sect. 4.1] and [57, Sect. 8.3].
We may rewrite the

Effective Action for a Scalar Field
For a real scalar field, we have P = (ξ−1
6)R and the curvature Ωµν of the gauge connection vanishes. We nevertheless
keep the curvature term for generalizing the expression to a complex scalar field later. The above expression for the
heat trace thus reduces to

Massless Particle Production in Weak Electric and Gravitational Fields
In Euclidean signature, the rate of scalar particle production events is determined by the imaginary part of the
effective action, −2Im(WE). The imaginary part originates from the branch cut of the logarithm (chosen along the
negative real axis) implicitly present in the expression

The value θ = 1/2 in the origin is justified by the fact that Arg(−iϵ) = −π/2 for m2 = 0.

where the dots stand for higher curvature terms. A Wick rotation to Lorentzian spacetimes induces a sign flip for the
effective action.
We can immediately generalize the result to complex scalar fields. As a complex scalar couples to the electromagnetic
4-potential, it has a non-trivial curvature Ωµν of the gauge connection. Taking into account that the complex scalar
incorporates two real degrees of freedom, N = 2, eq. (S.27) only receives an additional factor of 2.
Appendix S.2: Equivalence of Approaches for the Schwinger Effect
In this appendix, we investigate the Schwinger effect as a reference case. A full treatment of the Schwinger effect [2, 3]
for a free complex scalar field ϕ with mass m and charge q in D = 4 dimensions in the presence of a homogeneous
electric field ⃗E using a closed-form expression for the heat kernel yields the following imaginary part of the effective

In the limit m →0, it reduces to

Alternatively, this expression can be readily obtained from eq. (S.27) in Euclidean flat space, keeping in mind that

27π (GM)2, known as DeWitt approximation [58]. Taking deviations from the approximation at small frequencies
into account, a numerical study [59] found dE/dt ≈7.44 × 10−5 ℏ(GM)−2 such that the relative deviation to the
DeWitt geometrical optics limit lies at about 6%.
