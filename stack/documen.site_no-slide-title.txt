Big Bang Acoustics :
The Sound of Creation
Mark Whittle

Setting the Stage
Studies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
have revealed SOUND WAVES in the early Universe.
It is possible to make this sound audible to humans.
These sounds offer a wonderful opportunity for teaching:
•
Cosmology: structure formation
•
Acoustics: science of sound
•
Music: musical instruments; harmonics; scales
Much of astronomy is visual. 
This gives us auditory access to Nature…. and Creation.

1.  The Microwave Background
Look far away and we see back in time.
Look far enough, and you can see the “Big  Flash”

Our view of the Universe
includes space and time
red-shift
The Early Universe was
filled with hot glowing gas

We cannot see the Big Bang itself
It is hidden behind 400,000 light years 
of dense fog

= 12 hours in human lifetime
we see a glowing
wall of bright fog

2.  Raw Sound from the CMB
Measure the pressure waves in the CMB:
• The amplitudes (Δ P/P) ~ 10-4 ≡ 110 dB !
• The pitch is 50 octaves below A440 !
• The sound spectrum has harmonics !

Why is primordial sound so 
Because the Universe is so: BIG

3. Sound as Diagnostic
Quality of sound reveals the nature of an object
True also for the Universe:
• The sound spectrum reveals many properties
• Use computer simulations to match data
• Two examples:  baryon fraction; total density

Fraction of Baryons (atoms)
reality

4. Removing Distortion: C(ℓ) P(k)
The Universe is a poor concert hall !
Distortions are present in the sound spectrum.
One can “remove” distortions by using robust 
computer simulations (eg CMBFAST)


5. Into the Fog: Evolving Sound
The CMB gives only a snapshot of the sound
Use CMBFAST to reconstruct sound from earlier.

5. Post Recombination: 
From Sound to Stars
After recombination, pressure drops to ~zero
Cavity oscillations in time cease: true sound dies
However, the roughness grows quickly: 
• the baryons fall into dark matter “valleys”
• the dark matter itself gets more clumpy
• after 100 Myr the peaks collapse stars !
Continue to create sound from P(k)

7. The Harmonics
These are remarkable features of  the sound.
Harmonics usually arise in objects of finite size
The Universe is bounded in time
The harmonics are not as sharp as musical tones

Why does it sound so “unmusical”?
Because the Universe is not a good resonator
the harmonics are broad (fuzzy)
we do not easily notice the hidden notes
Compare the Universe with a flute:

8. In the Beginning: Quantum Hiss
The Big “Bang” was born in utter silence !!
Sound grew later as gas fell into a lumpy landscape
What made the initial lumpiness ?
Quantum fluctuations amplified by inflation
What did this truly primordial sound “sound” like?

9.  Closing thoughts
The physics of the early Universe can be cast in
terms which are bizarrely familiar, allowing us
access to what must surely be one of the most
remote but important of times.
Strangely, much of this was anticipated in 1680
by poet John Dryden:

John Dryden (1687)
From Harmony, from heavenly harmony,
This universal frame began: 
When nature underneath a heap 
Of jarring atoms lay,
And could not heave her head,
The tuneful voice was heard from high,
“Arise, ye more than dead.”
Then cold, and hot, and moist, and dry,
In order to their stations leap,
And Music’s power obye.
From harmony, from heavenly harmony,
This universal frame began; 
From harmony to harmony
Through all the compass of the notes it ran
The diapason closing full in man.
