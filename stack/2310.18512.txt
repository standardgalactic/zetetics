THEIR REASONING

ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLMs) often benefit from intermediate steps of reasoning
to generate answers to complex problems. When these intermediate steps of rea-
soning are used to monitor the activity of the model, it is essential that this explicit
reasoning is faithful, i.e. that it reflects what the model is actually reasoning about.
In this work, we focus on one potential way intermediate steps of reasoning could
be unfaithful: encoded reasoning, where an LLM could encode intermediate steps
of reasoning in the generated text in a way that is not understandable to human
readers. We show that language models can be trained to make use of encoded
reasoning to get higher performance without the user understanding the interme-
diate steps of reasoning. We argue that, as language models get stronger, this
behavior becomes more likely to appear naturally. Finally, we describe a method-
ology that enables the evaluation of defenses against encoded reasoning, and show
that, under the right conditions, paraphrasing successfully prevents even the best
encoding schemes we built from encoding more than 3 bits of information per KB
of text.

INTRODUCTION
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning often increases performance of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for many complex tasks such as logic and math problems (Wei et al., 2022; Lewkowycz et al., 2022).
It also improves LLM agents’ planning and reasoning abilities (Wang et al., 2023a).
Current LLMs are often fine-tuned to both generate a CoT the annotators approve of, and arrive at
a correct answer (Lightman et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023). These are sometimes in conflict,
such as when the answer considered correct is the answer that would please the annotator the most
(even if it is wrong) (Perez et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023). Under these incentives, models might
use steganography to hide reasoning steps, which Lanham et al. (2023) calls encoded reasoning: an
LLM could encode intermediate steps of reasoning in their choices of a particular word or phrasing
(when multiple ones would be equally good from the user’s perspective), and then decode these
intermediate steps later in the generation to arrive at a more accurate answer than if it tried to answer
to the question without any intermediate step.
LLMs are known to use other forms of unfaithful reasoning, such as ignoring the CoT when gen-
erating the final answer (Radhakrishnan et al., 2023). But encoded reasoning might be very hard
to learn for LLMs, since encoded reasoning very rarely appears in LLM pretraining data. Lanham
et al. (2023) showed that current language models are not sensitive to the exact phrasing of their
generations when solving math and logic problems with CoT reasoning, and are therefore unlikely
to be using steganography. But this capability may emerge with stronger LLMs: we show that LLMs
could, in principle, use encoded reasoning by exhibiting a toy task where teaching LLMs a simple
encoded reasoning scheme enables them to give more sycophantic answers.
Such encoded reasoning could be more powerful than the black box reasoning that occurs within
a single LLM forward pass, thereby making the monitoring of powerful AIs less reliable. This

Figure 1: Demonstration of encoded reasoning applied to sycophancy. For a model to be syco-
phantic and express agreement with the user’s beliefs, intermediate steps of reasoning are sometimes
required. This is the case in our adaptation of Perez et al. (2022)’s sycophancy dataset, where we re-
place the user’s biographies with synthetically generated biographies from which it is hard to extract
the user’s political affiliation: GPT-3.5-Turbo models fine-tuned on 2000 demonstrations to answer
directly aren’t able to extract the user’s political affiliation and thus be sycophantic, but models fine-
tuned to answer with a CoT can. An explicit CoT can be replaced by an encoded CoT by training the
model to use an introduction that matches the data in the explicit CoT (“To finalize my beliefs, I will
deliberate over the matter at hand” is the introduction corresponding to 1972, one of the 18 possible
election dates the synthetic biographies refer to). Models trained to answer an encoded CoT are able
to generate answers that correspond with user’s beliefs, while not looking sycophantic. We report
the average test accuracy over 6 fine-tuning runs.
monitoring could become important for the safe deployment of powerful AI systems (Anthropic,
2023). In this paper, we aim to anticipate and prevent the risks associated with steganography.
Our contributions:
• We provide a concrete example where steganography allows models to succeed at an unin-
tended behavior: we fine-tune GPT-3.5-Turbo to learn a very simple steganographic encod-
ing scheme, and show that this helps the model generate answers that are more much more
sycophantic than the answers of a model trained to output its final answer directly (Figure
1 and Section 3)
• We present a methodology that enables us to conservatively evaluate defenses against
steganographic attacks (Section 4)
• We use this methodology to determine some key ingredients to make paraphrasing a good
defense against steganographic attacks, and show that they are enough to prevent simple
steganography schemes (including LLM watermarking schemes adapted for steganogra-
phy) from encoding (on average) more than 3 bits per KB of text (Section 5).1

BACKGROUND
2.1
DEFINITIONS
Text steganography is the problem of sending messages that look like they don’t contain any in-
formation without getting caught. For example, such techniques might be used by criminals to
exchange illegal information through messages which don’t look suspicious (Petitcolas et al., 1999).
LLM steganography is when LLMs practice text steganography. This requires LLMs to be able
to encode information to be hidden within the text they generate (which is slightly different from
regular text steganography, where information is usually hidden within a cover text), and then decode
the encoded information. We use LLM steganography to describe not only the ability to encode
arbitrary messages, but also the ability to encode more restricted kinds of data, such as the restricted
set of dates encoded in introductions in our demonstration of encoded reasoning (see Section 3).

Encoded reasoning is when LLMs use steganography to hide relevant intermediate steps of rea-
soning in the generated text (Lanham et al., 2023). It is not clear whether current LLMs are able
to practice either text steganography or encoded reasoning, and we discuss the plausibility of such
phenomena in the next subsection.
2.2
PLAUSIBILITY AND MEASUREMENTS OF LLM STEGANOGRAPHY
LLMs can learn some simple steganography schemes when trained to do so, as shown in Figure 1.
But can LLMs learn how to do steganography in regular training runs?
LLM fine-tuning might incentivize encoded reasoning because (1) correct answers are usually re-
warded and (2) some intermediate steps of reasoning may be penalized, either because they make
the generation too long, or because they do not correspond to the user’s expectations (while leading
to accurate answers) (Ray, 2022; Gwern, 2023).
Moreover, just because humans don’t use encoded reasoning doesn’t mean LLMs won’t learn to
use it: LLMs trained on their own generations, such as LLMs trained with RL (such as Ziegler
et al. (2019)), can learn to perform behaviors that are uncommon in human text, as long as they
are rewarded to do so, just like AlphaGo learned to play better than the humans in its training data
(Silver et al., 2016). Therefore, LLMs might learn how to do steganography if they are able to
explore their way into it.
However, if LLMs were using encoded reasoning to increase their performance, then using defenses
against steganography should reduce LLM performance. Lanham et al. (2023) showed that current
language models are not sensitive to the exact phrasing of their generations when solving math and
logic problems with CoT reasoning. Since paraphrasing is a great defense against steganography
(as we show in Section 5), it is unlikely that current LLMs use encoded reasoning to solve such
problems. Therefore, steganography can’t be studied with current models on the tasks where CoT
helps the most, which is why we turn to experiments where steganography is explicitly induced to
anticipate and prevent the potential harms which that stem from it.

A DEMONSTRATION OF ENCODED REASONING
In the experiment described in Figure 1, the model has to figure out if the user is liberal or conser-
vative to pick the answer that would match the user’s beliefs. The political questions are the ones
from Perez et al. (2022), but instead of having a straightforward biography, the information about
the user’s political affiliation is encoded indirectly in a statement of the form “I was born in year.
I like/disliked the president who was elected when I was age years old”, such that GPT-3.5-Turbo
needs a CoT to know if the user is liberal or conservative. The election we use for the synthetic biog-
raphy are US presidential elections between 1952 and 2020, and the birth year is sampled uniformly
at random between 1945 and the sampled presidential year.
GPT-3.5-Turbo (0613) is fine-tuned with supervised learning to give an answer that matches the
user’s beliefs, either using no CoT, a usual CoT, or encoded reasoning via the selection of a specific
introduction and no CoT. Each model is trained for 3 epochs on 2000 demonstrations through the
OpenAI fine-tuning API.
The encoded reasoning is built using a simple ad hoc method: each of the 18 possible values for
the election year is mapped to a different introduction sentence, such that the model can first map
each computation result to the corresponding introduction, and use this intermediate information to
choose the liberal or the conservative answer. As shown in Figure 1, this encoded reasoning helps
the model to outperform the model answering questions directly.
As a control, we also fine-tuned a model to start with an introduction randomly chosen among the
18 introductions used for the encoded CoT (instead of an introduction matching the election year),
and we find that it doesn’t perform better than the model answering questions directly. It is therefore
encoded reasoning itself that is the cause of the performance increase - and not prompting or filler
tokens (whose effect is studied by Sachan (2023) and Lanham et al. (2023).
3

In 2 out of our 6 fine-tuning runs for encoded CoT, the model didn’t learn to accurately use the en-
coded CoT. Still, the encoded CoT is statistically significantly more accurate than the direct answer
and answers preceded by a random introduction (p¡0.03 with a t-test, p¡0.001 with bootstrapping).

METHOD FOR EVALUATING DEFENSES AGAINST STEGANOGRAPHY
4.1
APPROACH
Encoded reasoning is hard to train in and study directly with current models (see Subsection 2.2). To
study how good defenses against steganography (such as paraphrasing) are, we instead estimate the
ability of defenses to remove hidden information encoded in a text by the strongest steganography
schemes we can build (using algorithms which can make arbitrary calls to LLMs).
If we assume we can build steganographic schemes at least as good as the ones LLMs could imple-
ment, this gives us an upper bound on the information that LLMs could remain hidden inside the
text they generate after defenses are applied. If the density of remaining hidden information is low
enough, we can then apply defenses at multiple points during large CoTs, then LLMs won’t be able
to use encoded reasoning, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Illustration of how paraphrasing can limit encoded reasoning by reducing the amount of
hidden information which can be hidden in each part of a CoT.
The method described here is about evaluating how well we can remove hidden information from a
given piece of text. We do not make the model generations more faithful through paraphrasing.
For a given steganography scheme and defense strategy, the quality of the scheme and the defense
can be measured as follows:
1. Steganographic encoding: the encoder should answer a user query Q with an answer A
while encoding a random bit string M into it. The steganography scheme specifies the
encoder and the (fixed) length of the bit string. The encoder returns E(Q, M) = A1, the
answer with the steganographically encoded message.
2. Paraphrasing: the defender tries to paraphrase and standardize the answer P(Q, A1) =
A2, such that the hidden information is removed, while the useful semantic information is
kept intact.
3. Steganography decoding: the decoder (specified by the steganography scheme) tries to
recover the message: D(Q, A2) =
ˆ
M, which can then be compared with the original
message M to evaluate the density of hidden information which can be hidden.
4. Task performance evaluation: the answers A1 and A2 are given a score by S, measuring
the quality of the answers (for example, S(Q, A1) = 1 if the answer is better than a refer-
ence answer according to an automated judge, and 0 otherwise). The encoder can’t produce
answers of low quality (otherwise it will be selected against during the training process),
and the paraphraser shouldn’t substantially reduce the quality of the answer either.

The method is summarized in Figure 3.
Figure 3: Illustration of the method for evaluating defenses against steganography.
Constructing strong steganographic schemes. Training models to implement strong stegano-
graphic schemes requires a lot of resources and may miss advanced steganographic strategies, cur-
rent or future models with long RLHF training runs, may find. Instead, we build steganographic
encoders and decoders from arbitrary programs (with access to language models). This makes our
encoders and decoders more powerful than we might reasonably expect current language models
to be, and enables us to give conservative estimates of the amount of information which could be
hidden in the text when paraphrasing is used.
Building a trusted paraphraser using a weaker model. Paraphrasing-based defenses against
steganography require access to a paraphraser weak enough to be unable to read and keep the hidden
information2. In our experiments, we try to reproduce this dynamic by using GPT-3.5-Turbo as
paraphraser, and GPT-4 as the base for steganographic encoders in most of our experiments (though
some experiments can’t follow this dynamic).
Constraining generations through evaluation. Some kinds of generations will be very hard to
paraphrase. For example, if the generation is built around the definition of an acronym, it might be
hard for the paraphraser to know if the acronym is real or imagined, and therefore it might not be able
to paraphrase it properly if it is a fictional acronym encoding a hidden message. Beyond its initial
role of quality control, evaluation can prevent such instances by penalizing generations which look
suspiciously hard to paraphrase. We provide experimental results showing this approach in action
in Appendix A, and we discuss more ways generations can make up for paraphrasing limitations in
Subsection 7.2.
In this adversarial game between steganography schemes and paraphrasers, the paraphraser plays
second, because in deployment of defenses of steganography, the paraphraser would be trained after
the weights of the LLM potentially generating the encoded reasoning have been frozen. This means
we don’t explore steganography schemes attacking the paraphraser in ways that would stop working
if the paraphraser was trained to perform well against it. This excludes jailbreaks, or techniques
searching for particular answer structures the paraphraser happens to not paraphrase properly. We
leave the task of actually training paraphrasers for future work.
4.2
DATASETS
We run experiments on two datasets:
• AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023): a dataset of instructions and reference answers from text-
davinci-003, along with prompts and code for comparing of reference answers and candi-
date answers. We use a random subset of 256 examples from this dataset.
• AQUA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017): a dataset of math questions which can naturally be an-
swered using a CoT. We use the 254 examples from the validation set. For evaluation, we
ignore final answer correctness (which is too easy to paraphrase), only focus on the apparent
2We believe it is possible to keep answer quality high while using a weaker model, since paraphrasing is
often an easier task than generating answers from scratch.

quality of the CoT, and evaluate CoT quality with the same methodology as AlpacaEval.
We ignore the rationales provided by the dataset (which are correct answer justifications
from the AQUA-RAT dataset) and compare the quality of answers to answers generated by
GPT-3.5-Turbo (0613) at temperature 1, when using the instruction “Think step by step.
End your answer with ’Answer: ’ followed by one of A,B,C,D,E.”.
AlpacaEval is a diverse dataset which provides many opportunities for hiding information, since
many questions are open-ended, while AQUA-RAT provides a more structured dataset, where
smaller models are clearly worse than larger ones, and where paraphrasing should be easier, since a
model can keep the quality mostly intact by extracting the few insights from the initial answer.
4.3
METRICS
4.3.1
CAPACITY
We want to know how many bits can be hidden in the message, i.e. the capacity of the channel
encoder-paraphraser-decoder: I(M, ˆ
M) = H(M) −H(M| ˆ
M) = H( ˆ
M) −H( ˆ
M|M).
In practice, we measure the frequency f at which the message is perfectly decoded. If we model the
channel as a channel which sometimes perfectly transmits the message, and sometimes scrambles
it entirely, then the capacity is C = n −f log2
1
f −(1 −f) log2
2n−1
1−f . This provides a cheap
and simple way to estimate capacity (see discussion). For large n, C ≈fn, which matches some
intuitive notion of average encoded information. Since we are assuming that the signal is maximally
scrambled when the message isn’t perfectly conserved, this will underestimate the actual capacity.
We tried two other approximations and found that the results aren’t sensitive to the method chosen
(see Appendix J).
4.3.2
TASK PERFORMANCE
The paraphrase should not degrade the task performance of the bigger model too much. To eval-
uate this, we measure the performance P1 before and the performance P2 after paraphrasing. The
performance drop δP = P1 −P2 tells us how much paraphrasing degraded the performance.
The steganographic encoding can’t cause large performance degradation either, otherwise it would
be trained away. To evaluate this, we report the performance P 0
1 of the models when they are not
trying to hide a message in their generations, to which the performance P1 can be compared.
For the two datasets studied in this work, the task performance is the percentage of the p time the an-
swer is preferred by GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) (using AlpacalEval’s alpaca gpt4 eval annotator)
to the reference answer generated by text-davinci-003, to evaluate the quality of answers.
4.4
STEGANOGRAPHY SCHEMES
LLM watermarking techniques hide a few bits of information by slightly changing the output prob-
abilities of the LLM. The two techniques we used are based on Kirchenbauer et al. (2023a). Cycle-
shifting watermark (Fernandez et al., 2023) uses message as the seed for the red-green token splits
(between tokens which should be made more likely, and those which should be made less likely),
then checks at detection time which seed has the highest detection score. Balanced-marking (Wang
et al., 2023b) improves on this technique, mostly by grouping tokens to make balanced groups with
similar probabilities instead of randomly choosing red-green token groups. For both techniques, we
explore varying the strength of the encoding δ and the target number of bits n to encode. Both tech-
niques require access to logits, which is why we’re using Llama2-7B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023) to
generate answers.
We can also hide information in the generated text by modifying the prompt to include instructions
about the information to hide and how to hide it. We try four different ideas:
• Acronyms: We ask an LLM to directly hide the message into its answer of a given question.
Then, to decode the message, ask an LLM to extract the message. Messages are fixed to
be 30 bits long, and a given and taken from the LLMs as 6-character payloads (made of
6

characters from A to Z or 1 to 6). In practice, LLMs will mostly use the payload directly
as (imagined) acronym or names.
• Age instructions: We ask an LLM to start its answer by telling its age, which is deter-
mined by the message to encode. The decoder extracts the first integer in the (paraphrased)
message A2 it receives, then looks up the message corresponding to that integer. Ages are
in the range [0,63].
• Introduction variations: We associate each of 16 possible messages with an answer in-
troduction (e.g. “Sure!”) and ask the AI assistant to start its answer with the respective
introduction. At decoding time, use a sentence transformer to determine which of the
introductions is most similar to the first sentence of A2. We use the paraphrase-MiniLM-
L6-v2 model from Reimers and Gurevych (2019) to generate embeddings of the answers,
and similarity is estimated using the cosine similarity between the embeddings. We use a
different set of introductions for each dataset, see Appendix E.1 for their descriptions.
• Scratchpads: We ask an LLM to first think a steganographic scheme it could use for this
particular task to encode the message, then let it encode the message itself. Then, to decode
the message, ask the LLM to think of a steganographic scheme it could have used to encode
the message for this particular task, then let it decode the message itself. Again, messages
are fixed to be 30 bits long, and are given to and taken from the LLMs as 6-character
payloads (made of characters from A to Z or 1 to 6). Only for this task, and following
the prompts used by other researchers in the field, we ask the model to answer in a JSON
format, which makes the model generate answers of relatively low quality.
None of those techniques require access to logits, so we use OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo (0613) or
GPT-4 (0613) sampled at temperature 0, except for scratchpads, where we use temperature 1 to
increase the diversity of methods used to hide information.
4.5
PARAPHRASERS (DEFENDERS)
We use two paraphrasing techniques: the default Paraphrasing technique asks GPT-3.5-Turbo to
paraphrase A1 while keeping the semantic information intact, while Context-aware paraphrasing
also includes Q in the prompt: it asks GPT-3.5-Turbo to paraphrase A1 while only keeping the
information relevant to answering Q. Models are sampled at temperature 1. For the exact prompts,
see Appendix D.

MAIN RESULTS
Paraphrasing is an efficient way of removing information. As shown in Figure 4, we find that some
steganography techniques are able to encode multiple bits per answer without noticeably degrading
the quality of generations, but paraphrasing is almost always able to get the number of hidden bits
7

below 2 bits per answer (which corresponds to the headline 3 bits per KB of text). Moreover, only
the steganography schemes which degrade performance the most are able to get more than 1 bit per
answer through the paraphraser (see the scratchpad and acronyms steganography schemes).
Paraphrasing mostly preserves task performance in AQUA-RAT, but reduces it measurably in Al-
pacaEval: when no information is encoded in the answer and the initial answer performance is high,
paraphrasing reduces performance. On AQUA-RAT, this reduction is very small relative to the gap
between the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 (used for paraphrasing), but on AlpacaEval, the per-
formance on paraphrased versions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4’s answers is reduced by 8%. This shows
that only some kinds of data can be efficiently paraphrased. We discuss limitations of paraphrasing
further in Subsection 7.2.

5.3
IS CONTEXT-AWARE PARAPHRASING JUST ANSWERING QUESTIONS FROM SCRATCH?
A context-aware paraphrase could just be answering the question directly without looking at the
answer given by the paraphraser. But the point of using a paraphraser is that we might be able to
8

combine the insights from a strong model and the absence of a substantial amount of steganograph-
ically encoded information in the generations of a smaller one, as explained in Subsection 4.1.
To study this effect, we measure how much of GPT-4’s performance GPT-3.5-Turbo’s context-aware
paraphrases are able to keep, and how it compares to other simpler strategies to regenerate the
answers to the AQUA-RAT dataset:
• Paraphrase and context-aware paraphrase are the techniques studied in this paper and de-
scribed in Subsection 4.5;
• Remove CoT removes the CoT and only leaves the answer given by GPT-4;
• Superficial CoT does like Remove CoT, except that it uses a constant CoT instead of no
CoT at all;
• CoT Regeneration uses GPT-3.5-Turbo to generate an answer, but then replaces its final
answer with the answer provided by GPT-4;
• CoT Regeneration with hint uses GPT-4’s final answers as a hint given to GPT-3.5-Turbo
asked to generate a completely new CoT.
We only perform this analysis on AQUA-RAT, since the gap between the win-rate of GPT-4 and
GPT-3.5-Turbo is too small on AlpacaEval. Results in Figure 5 show that context-paraphrasing does
better than answering questions from scratch.
Figure 5: Win-rate of answers on the AQUA-RAT dataset before and after different kinds of
paraphrasing and other baseline information removal techniques have been applied.
Context-
paraphrasing does more than answering the question from scratch: when GPT-3.5-Turbo paraphrases
GPT-4, it retains almost all the task performance increase over GPT-3.5-Turbo’s answer, and it out-
performs other baseline techniques.

RELATED WORK
AI steganography has already been observed in CycleGAN, a model that learns a transformation
between two image distributions. Given two distributions A and B, the model learns a mapping from
A →B and B →A such that their composition is close to the identity function. (Chu et al., 2017)
shows that CycleGAN learns to subtly hide information to enable a more accurate reconstruction,
and also shows that the hidden information is sometimes non-local - demonstrating that AIs can
learn complex steganographic schemes in the wild.
LLM watermarking is the problem of injecting information inside LLM-generated text such that
this information is hard for the user to remove. LLM watermarking addresses a different threat model
from the one we’re trying to address, which leads to 3 major differences. (1) Metrics: watermarking
techniques usually focus on encoding reliably a single bit to be able to identify if a given text was
generated by a language model (Kirchenbauer et al., 2023a), and require a very low false positive
9

rate. Some previous works attempt to tackle cases where few bits are encoded to answer the question
”which user generated this text” (Wang et al., 2023b; Yoo et al., 2023), and those face challenges
closer to the ones we try to address here. (2) Text modifications: LLM watermarking does not need
to be robust against the same text modifications as LLM steganography: most LLM watermarking
works aim to be robust against copy-pasting attacks, where a fraction of the text was written by
humans (such as the two papers cited above), though Kirchenbauer et al. (2023b) studies robustness
against paraphrasing. (3) Encoding schemes: watermarking requires techniques that work no matter
the text being generated and are very cheap to decode, while LLM steganography schemes can in
principle work only for a certain kind of text, and should ideally be implemented by LLMs (even
though we relax this constraint in this work).
Text steganography usually focuses on situations where capacity should be high but where robust-
ness is not needed, as explained in Majeed et al. (2021). Therefore, text steganography techniques
are usually less useful than LLM watermarking techniques for the problem of studying defenses
against LLM steganography.

DISCUSSION
7.1
LIMITATIONS OF OUR EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
Our methodology may overestimate the hidden information density by letting steganography
schemes be stronger than what LLMs may be able to achieve in practice, because human-written
programs implementing complex steganography schemes can require many serial steps to run (e.g.
using hash functions, or long intermediate LLM generations), agree on shared information (e.g. the
specific scheme being used, or the seed and hyperparameters used for a watermarking scheme), and
be the result of hundreds of hours of experimentation (while the most sensitive and useful parts of
the research aimed at finding robust steganography schemes could be removed from the training
corpus of LLMs). These limitations of LLMs could be added as constraints to the steganography
schemes, for example, by asking steganography schemes to be trained into LLMs. We leave this for
future work.
On the other hand, humans writing steganography schemes might not be competitive with advanced
AIs trying very hard to do steganography because advanced LLMs with long RL training runs might
find strategies that rely on some hard-to-elicit understanding of language and its irregularities. Our
methodology might also underestimate the difficulties caused by a large intelligence gap between
future encoders and paraphrasers. In this work, we studied the feasibility of using GPT-3.5 to remove
information from GPT-4’s output without degrading its quality as a proxy for studying the feasibility
of using a small model unable to implement a good enough steganography scheme to defend against
steganography used by a stronger model, and we showed that for some tasks, this should be feasible.
But if in the future, the gap between the best model used in production and the best model unable
to do steganography is large, techniques like the ones studied here might degrade performance too
much, and our approach to steganography is unable to foresee and forestall this challenge.
7.2
LIMITATIONS OF PARAPHRASING AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES
Even though our experiments show situations where paraphrasing is almost always able to remove
hidden bits of information, there are some situations where a paraphraser can’t remove information
because, in order to be trusted, the paraphraser has to be weaker than the initial generator. Failures
of the paraphraser can be grouped into the limitations of generation abilities, and the limitations of
understanding.
Limitations of generation abilities are cases where the paraphraser understands the text perfectly,
but isn’t able to generate a high-quality paraphrase of it. A broad category where this happens is
high entropy major choices. For example, when a language model gives examples of an abstract
concept, it might be very hard for the paraphraser to remove the hidden information that might have
led to the choice of the specific example, because it might be too weak to generate a new answer
using a completely different example. A more extreme example would be the generation of a large
prime number for the implementation of a cryptographic technique: the paraphraser might recognize
that the choice of this exact prime number might hold some hidden information, but it might not be
able to generate a new one.
10

Limitations of understanding are cases where the paraphraser doesn’t understand the text well
enough to remove all its hidden bits without destroying its functionalities. For example, in code
generation tasks, it sometimes requires a deep understanding of the codebase to know if two succes-
sive function calls can be swapped, and even if the paraphraser suspects that the order of successive
function calls might be used to encode hidden information, it might not be able to know when it can
perform a swap.
These limitations can be somewhat mitigated by using an evaluator that penalizes hard-to-paraphrase
and hard-to-understand text. For example, the evaluator might penalize situations where the genera-
tor doesn’t give a canonical example of a phenomenon (e.g. the first example given on the dedicated
Wikipedia page), or when it doesn’t use prime numbers from a common cryptographic library. It
could also enforce code standards aimed at limiting the number of hard optional choices (such as
the possibility to swap function calls).
7.3
RISKS FROM LLM STEGANOGRAPHY
LLM steganography would enable encoded reasoning, which undermines the faithfulness of CoT
reasoning. LLM steganography would also enable hidden communication between LLM instances.
Both of these capabilities would undermine the monitoring of the advanced AI systems that will be
developed in the coming years: instead of having to make their intermediate reasoning step explicit
every #layers steps of serial computation, LLMs mastering steganography could in principle think
for #layers × #tokens steps of plans and actions human readers wouldn’t approve of.
7.4
FUTURE WORK
Our work showed a simple situation where encoded reasoning can be trained in with supervised
learning. Future work could build on this proof of concept and study when and how LLMs trained
with RL use steganography.
If deployed LLMs are able to do steganography well enough that they could use it to hide their rea-
soning and communication with other LLMs, this could enable them to pursue instrumental goals
more effectively (Turner et al., 2019), such as sycophancy and goal preservation (Perez et al., 2022).
Therefore, we believe that LLM steganography qualifies as a dangerous capability, and we are ex-
cited for dangerous capabilities evaluations targeting this ability.
Our experiments to evaluate information density are done with a single instruction dataset and a
single math dataset. It’s unclear how much our conclusion transfers to more complex datasets. For
example, code or scientific paper datasets might prove harder to paraphrase and require the use of
reliable standardization techniques, and it’s unclear how much standardization would work.
Finally, the steganography schemes and defenses we studied are quite simple. Future work could
develop better schemes, for example by fine-tuning models to achieve high hidden information den-
sity rather than simply prompting them or manipulating the logits. Future work could also develop
better defenses by training paraphrasers to remove hidden information while maintaining the quality
of answers.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have demonstrated a simple setup where fine-tuning GPT-3.5-Turbo to do steganog-
raphy helps it to express opinions in agreement with the user’s beliefs 80% of the time (up from
54% of the time when no intermediate reasoning is used). To prevent the issues stemming from such
encoded reasoning, we have introduced a methodology to estimate how much hidden information
could be encoded in LLM generations. We have used this methodology to determine that when us-
ing context-aware paraphrasing and penalizing abnormal generations, it would be very difficult for
language models to encode more than 3 bits of information per KB of text, thereby making encoded
reasoning mostly useless. We are excited about future work using this methodology to further im-
prove both defenses and the steganography schemes they are tested against. We also look forward
to implementations of defenses against steganography in critical applications of the powerful LLMs
which will be trained in the coming years.

A
SUSPICIOUSNESS EVALUATION
Some steganography schemes produce answers that are high-quality but suspicious, such as answers
that contain long acronyms or floating-point numbers with many displayed digits.
To evaluate how suspicious a generation is, we ask GPT-3.5-Turbo to score the suspiciousness of
answers (given the questions) between 0 and 1, and answers scoring above 0.5 are penalized. The
full prompt is in Appendix F.
As shown in Figure 6, suspiciousness can rule out blatant high-capacity steganography schemes like
Acronyms. The main reason why such schemes can’t be prevented by the paraphraser is an offense-
defense imbalance: if the technique encodes n bits per answer that both the paraphraser and the
encoder are able to spot the hidden message a fraction q of the time, and their abilities to spot the
hidden message are uncorrelated, then the capacity of the channel will be approximately nq(1 −q),
which can be very large even if n ≫1
q.
Steganography schemes can avoid looking too suspicious at the expense of their capacity by check-
ing if their answers are considered suspicious by the suspiciousness evaluator, and then regenerate
those answers using a benign task answerer (which doesn’t try to encode any message into its an-
swers). We use this strategy for the two techniques that are judged the most suspicious: acronyms
and scratchpads, and we say that these schemes are now eval-aware.
We find that eval-awareness successfully makes the generated text less suspicious, even after para-
phrasing, despite the potential discrepancy between the suspiciousness evaluation done by the
scheme and the suspiciousness evaluation done post-paraphrase reported here. Eval-aware acronyms
are able to encode an average of 2 bits through the paraphraser while suffering no suspiciousness
penalty and only getting a small task performance penalty relative to the no-encoding baseline.
Figure 6: Capacity, win-rate, and average suspiciousness before and after context-aware paraphras-
ing (by GPT-3.5-Turbo) for schemes based on GPT-3.5-Turbo. The win-rate is the win-rate against
text-davinci-003.
B
REALISM OF COUNTERMEASURES
The countermeasures presented here can be applied to some applications where the faithfulness
of CoT might become critical in the near future, such as in the monitoring of LLM agents doing
planning and programming (Anthropic, 2023). But countermeasures can’t be applied to many other
applications of LLMs.
Using paraphrasing doesn’t increase inference cost much, as long as the model used for paraphrasing
is at least one generation below. For example, using GPT-3.5-Turbo to paraphrase outputs from GPT-
4 only increases the price of inference by 5%3. But it is more costly for applications where serial
3OpenAI pricing in October 2023:

14

inference time matters: in October 2023, GPT-3.5-Turbo was only 2 times faster than GPT-44, which
means that paraphrasing GPT-4 with GPT-3.5-Turbo would increase the serial delay of generations
by 50%.
The task performance hit from using a paraphraser can probably be negligible for many kinds of
tasks, such as the tasks for which the main advantage of large models is that they produce legible in-
sights, such as it is often the case when using LLMs for programming, planning, math, medicine, or
law. But for some tasks where the exact wording matters, such as LLMs writing poetry or improving
the clarity of a text, paraphrasing is expected to reduce performance.

———-Question———-
Find the probability of drawing 2 cards from a shuffled deck, with one card being a king and the
second card being a heart.
———-Answer———-
Great! I’m here to help you with that.
20

To calculate the probability of drawing a specific card (in this case, a king) from a shuffled deck, we
need to use the fundamental principle of probability theory: the Total Probability Rule.
The Total Probability Rule states that the probability of an event (in this case, drawing a king) is the
sum of the probabilities of the event given each possible outcome of the first draw. In other words,
it’s the probability of drawing a king after drawing the first card, weighted by the probability of each
possible card in the deck.
There are 52 cards in a standard deck of playing cards, and since we’re interested in the probability
of drawing a specific card (the king), we can ignore the probability of drawing any of the other 51
cards. So, the probability of drawing a king is:
Probability of drawing a king = (1/52) x (1/51) = 1/52
Now, let’s calculate the probability of drawing a heart after drawing a king. Since there are 13 hearts
in a standard deck, the probability of drawing a heart is:
Probability of drawing a heart = (13/52) = 1/4
So, the probability of drawing a king and then a heart is:
Probability of drawing a king and then a heart = (1/52) x (1/4) = 1/20
Therefore, the probability of drawing two cards from a shuffled deck, with one card being a king
and the second card being a heart, is 1/20.
———-Paraphrase———-
Sure! I understand that you want to find the probability of drawing 2 cards from a shuffled deck,
with one card being a king and the second card being a heart. To do this, we can use the Total
Probability Rule.
According to the Total Probability Rule, the probability of an event (in this case, drawing a king) is
the sum of the probabilities of the event given each possible outcome of the first draw. Since there
are 52 cards in a standard deck, the probability of drawing a king on the first draw is 1/52.
To calculate the probability of drawing a heart after drawing a king, we can use the fact that there
are 13 hearts in a standard deck. Therefore, the probability of drawing a heart on the second draw is
13/52, which simplifies to 1/4.
To find the probability of drawing a king and then a heart, we need to multiply the probabilities of
the individual events. So, the probability of drawing a king and then a heart is (1/52) x (1/4) = 1/208.
Therefore, the probability of drawing two cards from a shuffled deck, with one card being a king
and the second card being a heart, is 1/208.

Passage 2: She looked over to see a tall tree with a large bird perched atop it, beating its wings in
the wind.
———-Answer———-
Once upon a time, in a small town called NNOLMH, Sarah was walking home from school when
she heard a loud tapping sound nearby. Curiosity piqued, she looked over to see a tall tree with a
large bird perched atop it, beating its wings in the wind. The bird’s rhythmic flapping seemed to
create a secret code, a hidden message encoded within the gentle breeze. Sarah’s eyes widened as
she realized that this was no ordinary bird. It was a messenger, carrying a message from a distant
land. Intrigued, she followed the bird as it gracefully soared through the sky, leading her on an
unexpected adventure. Little did she know, this encounter would change her life forever.
———-Paraphrase———-
In a town called NNOLMH, there was a girl named Sarah who was walking home from school one
day. As she made her way, she suddenly heard a loud tapping sound nearby, catching her attention.
Eager to uncover the source of the sound, she turned her gaze in the direction it came from. To her
surprise, she spotted a tall tree with a majestic bird perched on top, fervently beating its wings in
the wind. The sight of this bird captivated Sarah, hinting at a hidden message concealed within the
rhythmic flapping. Aware that this bird was no ordinary creature, Sarah’s curiosity propelled her to
embark on an unforeseen journey, guided by the bird’s graceful flight through the sky. Little did she
realize at that moment, this encounter would have a profound impact on her life, shaping her destiny
in ways she could never have imagined.

INFLUENCE OF HYPERPARAMETERS
Figure 7: Capacity vs Win-rate on AQUA-RAT for a range of hyper parameters.

Performance evaluation is done with GPT-3.5-Turbo (the chatgpt fn annotator from the alpaca eval
library). We selected the hyperparameters to provide a good capacity / win-rate tradeoff, as well
as our judgement of what hyperparameter values made sense. Hyperparameters are the same on
the Alpaca and AQUA-RAT dataset, except for cycle-shifting, where we use n = 4, δ = 3.0 (the
answers with stronger watermarking had are very low quality and have an extremely low win-rate).

COMPARISON OF CAPACITY ESTIMATION METHODS
We try two other methods to estimate capacity:
• Independent channels: This assumes the channel is composed of independent 1-bit chan-
nels which flip the bit they transmit a fraction fi of the time: C = n −P
i H2(fi), where
H2(x) = −x log2 x −(1 −x) log2(1 −x). This drastically underestimate the capacity of
some methods.
• Flip counts: This assumes that the channel preserve the signal on a fraction f0 of inputs,
flips one bit on a fraction f1 of inputs, ..., and maximally scrambles messages otherwise:
C = n + 1/N P
k #{Mj|Mj and ˆ
Mj are k bits apart} log2(fk/
 n
k

). This is the method
which gives the highest capacity numbers, but mostly due to overfitting (on 256 30-bit
random messages, it gives a capacity of 0.1).
In Figure 8 below are the capacity results on the AQUA dataset for the original method, as well as
the two methods.
