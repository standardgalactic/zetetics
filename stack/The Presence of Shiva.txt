ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
This book took shape over about ten years and I am grateful to those 
who read various drafts of the manuscript, edited the English, and 
checked the references to Sanskrit texts. Paul Todd Makler, Dorothy 
Norman, and Svatantra Kumar Pidara gave their unstinting help dur­
ing the earlier phases. Guy Welbon made valuable suggestions con­
cerning the substance of the text; Darrel Sewell added constructive 
comments to the Appendix. Susan Oleksiw painstakingly revised in its 
final form the language and accuracy of the manuscript with regard 
to its sources. To her in particular, to all those who helped, and to the 
authorities of the Philadelphia Museum of Art who facilitated my 
work, I am indebted forever. 
Grateful acknowledgment is due to the Archaeological Survey of In­

The Presence of Siva 


>1 
THE PRIMORD IAL SCENE 
1 .  RAUDRA BRAHMAN 
His name is not uttered. It must not be mentioned; only indirectly is 
He to be referred to (AB.3.34). 
A hymn of the lJ-g Veda (RV. 1O.61), the most sacred and most an­
cient work of Indian religious tradition, begins by calling itself a "wild 
creation" or "a poem about the Wild God" (raudra brahman) 
(RV.I0.61 .1). The hymn knows whom it evokes by these words, for 
His presence is in these words. In the lucid frenzy of the images of 
the hymn He arises and abides. 
It is when time is about to begin. In the dawn of the world, when 
the black cow of cosmic night lies with the ruddy cows of morning 
(RV. I0.61 .4), two figures appear, the Father and the virgin daughter, 
his own daughter. They are the two actors in the primordial scene. 
The Father makes love to the daughter. Suddenly he pulls back, his 
seed falls down to earth, the place of sacrifice (RV. I0.61 .5-7). "In their 
concern the gods created a poem, a word of power (brahman) and out 
of this they gave shape to Vastoġpati, the guardian of the dwelling, 
the guardian of sacred order (vratapi)" (RV. I 0.61 .7). "Like a raging 
bull did the Father foam, running this way and that way and away 
with scant understanding. Like one rejected she sped south" 
(RV. 1O.61 .8), into cosmic night. In spite of this mishap or on account 
of it, soon the patter was heard on earth of the progeny of the Father 
(RV. I0.61 .g).1 
Creation is an act of violence that infringes upon the Uncreate, the 
I Different interpretations of this hymn have been proposed. Cf. 8g Veda Sa1flhiti 
(RV), tJ'. Geldner, 195 1 , 3:225-28.

undifferentiated wholeness that is before the beginning of things. 
And yet another act of violence is hinted at, and this act is kept secret 
in these wild and portentous mantras. He is implied, for it is He who 
is invoked in this hymn. He, the most powerful, who with the arrow 
in his hand hit the target (RV. 1O.61 .3). The Father was made to pull 
back from the creative act that was to be prevented or undone by 
Him, yet lead to the existence oflife on earth. Without revealing their 
source, sparks of meaning flare up in tense brevity in the raudra brah­
man. 
A hymn to Agni, the Fire (RV. 1.71), sheds light on His,pature 
whose name the raudra brahman withholds. This hymn cebrates 
Agni, who had prepared the seed for Father Heaven. But when Agni 
noticed the lust of the Father for his daughter, this hunter crept 
along, then boldly shot his arrow at the Father just when he was 
quenching his desire in his daughter. The hunter had aimed at the 
creative act itself. Father Heaven shed his seed. It fell to earth. Agni, 
the Fire, brought to life the Father's progeny, the benevolent host of 
immaculate Fire-youths (RV. 1.71.5, 8). 
Fire is a hunter. The flame creeps along, lashes out, it hits the victim 
with its dart. The arrow of Agni strikes the Father in his passionate 
embrace of the daughter. But Agni's heat had also ripened the seed 
in the Father. Foaming in hot fury when he is struck by the fiery ar­
row, the Father spills his seed on the earth, the site of sacrifice, where 
it will sprout in the splendor ofthe immaculate and benevolent Fire­
youths, the host of the Angirases, Agni's priests. 
The ambiguity of Agni is the ambiguity of fire itself, which both 
sustains and destroys life. But inasmuch as the Father is the object of 
this ambiguity, Agni is the name of the hunter who is but a mask of 
Him whose name is withheld and to whom the gods, the celestial in­
telligence, in compassionate insight give shape as Vastoġpati, the 
guardian of the dwelling, the guardian of divine law (vratapa). They 
carved (atakJan )2-this is the literal translation-this shape out of the 
poem (brahman) while they created it (RV. 1O.61.7). By their wording 
of the sacred mantra His shape arose in its meter, and the vision took 
form in the rhythm of the words of this raudra brahman, this wild, 
fierce hymn of the god whose name it hides while he is seen as he

R A U D R A  B R A H M A N · 5 
arises in his unfathomable nature and paradoxical shape as guardian 
of sacred order, lord of viistu. 
The mystery of creation in this simultaneity of manifestations be­
gins with a fateful shot, the wound it inflicts on the Father, the loss of 
his seed, its fall to earth, and the birth of the poem and of mankind 
to be. In the beginning is the word sung by the gods, the celestial in­
telligence, compassionate witnesses of primal passion and of the deed 
of the hunter. The mystery of the raudra brahman embraces the cosmic 
creative act together with the form-engendering creation of the 
poem. The brahman tells of the mystery and at the same time tells of 
its mode of telling. It shrouds and at the same time conveys His name 
in the form it gives to him by calling itself a raudra brahman, a wild 
creation, or Rudraic creation, for this poem and the creation are of 
Rudra, the Wild God. Raudra, an adjective from Rudra, means wild, 
of Rudra nature.3 Rudra as the name of the god would signify "the 
Wild One" or "the Fierce God." According to later Vedic tradition, 
however, the word Rudra is derived from rud, to cry, howl 
(TS. 1 .5. 1 . 1; MS.4.2 . 12; SB.6. 1 .3. 1O). While the words of the mantras 
conjure up the primordial action and evoke the entire myth, they also 
carry the effect of this action on the gods, that is, on the evoking con­
sciousness. Reflected in that consciousness, the action acquires the 
form of the poem. In this transmutation the main actor, whose name 
is withheld because his action and its effect on his victim fully identify 
him, arises not as Fire, not as Wild Archer, but as Vastoġpati, guard­
ian of the dwelling and guardian of sacred order (vratapii). In this 
shape he emerges from the poem of magic power, the brahman. Po­
etry in the sacred order of its meters is his domain. Therein the fire 
of the Wild Archer sustains the form. Vastoġpati, created by the gods, 
the celestial intelligence, is the guardian of his domain, the world of 
sacred order-a rhythmic structure that is art, a cosmos. These are 
viistu, the house that he guards. 
Thus His world comes about. The double meaning of the word rau­
dra is intentional: the poem is about Rudra, the wild, formidable god, 
and it is itself a fiercely wild creation charged with many meanings. 
They emerge from other hymns, are made more explicit in later texts, 
and are basic to the cosmos of Rudra, which has its image in myths 
3/bid., s.v. rudra.

and the visual arts. In these two modes of form the mystery of this 
god has left its imprint over the millennia on the resilient matrix of 
the Indian mind. The unnamed god evoked in the scene 01 violence 
and awe in the primordial moment of the creation of man-when 
time was about to begin-is the main actor, although he does not fig­
ure in the scene. The gods, the collective celestial intelligence, watch 
the scene and in their concern they turn it into a mantric poem from 
which the unnamed god arises as Vastoġpati, the guardian of sacred 
order (vratapa). Vastoġpati means guardian of the viistu, and viistu 
means both site and dwelling or house.4 
The Wild Hunter in the precosmic wilderness is Rudra. In the form 
of their poem, a magic creation (brahman), the၊gods give shape to him 
as Vastoġpati. The viistu that he guards is th;။smos, the site that is 
his domain is the site of the sacrifice. The sacred order of the cosmos 
is enacted on the site of the sacrifice in the rhythm of rites and hymns. 
They are analogous to the rhythms that pervade-the cosmos. 
2. THE LORD OF ANIMALS 
The primordial, paradigmatic myth of Rudra is told in the Maitrayatli 
Sa1{thita of the Black Yajuroeda. Father Heaven, henceforth acting un­
der the name of Prajapati, Lord of Generation, desired his daughter 
Uġas, the Dawn. She became a female antelope, he became an ante­
lope5 and pursued her. While he was taking his perverse pleasure in 
her, he suddenly turned around toward one who was aiming his ar­
row at him. Addressing the Archer, Prajapati in fear exclaimed: "I 
make you Lord of the Animals (paSuna1{t pati)." "Leave me." Thus his 
n'ame is Pasupati, Lord of Animals. The first seed that fell was sur­
rounded by fire produced by Agni (MS.4.2. 1 2) (cf. Pasupa: RV. 
1.114.9; cf. TS·3·1 .5·1). 
Thus he came to be, and everything in existence. When he ap-
4 V. S. Apte, The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, s.v. 
5 The animals are rsya and rohir;i. Ȫya is the male of a species of antelope. Rohir;i 
connotes a red cow or "a young girl in whom menstruation has just commenced" (Apte, 
The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, s.v . ). The Aitareya Briih1TUlfUl (AB .3.33) speaks of 
mrga and rohir;i. Mrga denotes. a wild animal, deer, or antelope. The ritual significance 
of the black antelope (knr;amrga) suggests that it was this animal whose shape Prajapati 
had taken (Ch. X.A.2.d). The shape of UƗas, the Dawn, would be that of a female an­
telope. 

LORD O F  A N I M ALS · 7 
proached shooting, he howled (arodit). Hence his name is Rudra, the 
roarer, according to popular etymology (MS.4.2 . 1 2). He has two na­
tures or two "names": the one, cruel and wild (rudra), the other kind 
(siva) and tranquil (santa). These he assumes at will (MS .4.2.1 2). They 
are interconnected, springing from the same root hidden deep in this 
god. Rudra is siva (RV. 1O.g2.g). The rudra-siva polarity of the god is 
carried by his Rudra-Agni nature. 
Agni, the Fire, prepares the seed for the Father, but Rudra himself 
is Agni. Their shapes overlap. The connection of Rudra and Agni cir­
cles a point of identity. Agni is Rudra. This homology, stated again 
and again in sacred scripture (RV. 1.27. 1O; 2.1.6; 3.2.5; 4.3. 1 ;  8.61 .3; 
TS·1.3·14· 1 ;  1 .5· 1 . 1 ;  2.6.6.6; 5.4.3. 1 ;  5-4- 10.5; 5.5.7.4; SB · 1.7·3·8; 
6. 1 .3. 10; g. 1 . 1 . 1 ;  MBh.3.2 18.27), is one of nature, not of person. In­
asmuch as his nature is that of fire, Rudra is Agni. Rudra prepares 
the fiery seed of Prajapati; but Rudra is also the fire that pursues and 
frightens him when, having intercourse with Uas, the Dawn, the an­
telope, hiscdaughter, he sees the flaming arrow of Rudra, the cruel 
hunter, the avenger, aimed at him. Prajapati is the target of Rudra. 
When his seed falls on earth, it is surrounded by Agni. Moreover, the 
stages of the drama are simultaneous. Time did not yet exist. Time 
was just about to begin from out of timeless simultaneity in that first 
early morning of the world. 
Rudra, the Fire, prepares the seed for the Father; Rudra the 
Archer aims at the Father, hot with passion, who lets fall the seed on 
earth. Rudra is not a person, not a power confined in one single 
shape. And he is the cause and also that effect on which again he acts. 
He prepares the seed for the Father. The seed sends forth the 
Father's heat of passion. The consummation of passion is being shot 
at by Rudra. Inasmuch as he is Agni, he prepares the seed. Inasmuch 
as he is Rudra, he is intent on the destruction of the effect that he has 
caused. He incites toward creation, and when it takes its course he lets 
fly his arrow against it. The sequence of contradictory actions is far 
from self-defeating. It is of thfl very nature of Rudra, who creates in 
order to destroy, for he will create again in an inexhaustible renewal 
oflife on earth, where creation is the aeviternal answer to destruction, 
and both have their ground and antithesis in the Uncreate. This is the 
course that Rudra set. More truly than any other god he could have 
said of himself: " I  am not a puzzled-out book, I am a god with his 

8 • T H E  P R I M O R D I A L  S C E N E  
contradictions."6 His contradictions, his polarities operate on all levels 
of his ambience, radiating from his center. 
When the terror of the moment of creation seized the gods, that 
celestial intelligence made of it a poem, a word of power, a riddle, 
posed by and solved by Rudra, the raudra brahman. 
The Rudra-Siva tension as it is expressed in the Maitriiyatti Sa1{thitii 
operates on a lower level of realization than that of the raudra brah­
man. In the mantras of the raudra brahman the tension is between the 
unnamed god and Vastopati, guardian of the dwelling, guardian of 
divine law. By alluding to the act while withholding the name of the 
actor, the mantras make his presence loom over the entire scene. It ex­
tends into the creation by the gods, into the measured rhythm of the 
poem from which the figure of Vastopati emerges. 
Here there are two forms of the unnamed god. One is the appalling 
Hunter who aims "against nature," against the primordial act of 
Father Heaven that he as Agni had instigated., against procreation, by 
which mankind was to come about. The othbr form is that of Vas­
topati, created by the gods, the celestial intelligence, the creativeness 
itself of mind. The two forms imply the tension between life and its 
negation on the one side, the wild untamed world, the wilderness in 
man and nature, and on the other side the world of ၉rt and cosmic 
order. Both are his domain. In the one he acts as the Wild Hunter. In 
the other he manifests as guardian of the dwelling, as guardian of the 
sacred cosmic order. The dwelling that he guards and the sacred or­
der that he guards are forms in which-in the poem by the gods-his 
presence arises out of and on the strength of his fierceness. V astopati 
is.the guardian of the sacred order of the cosmos; he watches over all 
rhythms and rites of life. . 
The myth of the origin of mankind and the mystery of creation in 
the cosmos and in art are in the magic words of the raudra brahman. 
Life on earth began with the shot at the Father in the procreative 
moment. The seed fell to earth from Father Heaven. The arrow was 
shot against the Father, against the emission of seed. The arrow hit its 
target. Dawn ran away from her mate, from her father, into cosmic 
night-to arise in another aeon. What made the Hunter let fly his ar­
row so that it hit the Father at the procreative moment?

The raudra lnahman is called the fire-storm chant (agnimaruta uktha) 
in the Brahma1J,a of a Hundred Paths (SB . 1 .7-4-4)' The Aitareya Brah­
ma1J,a speaks of the raudra brahman as a wonder-work of the gods: 
"There are such wonder-works of the gods, and the arts in this world 
are to be understood as an imitation thereof' (AB .6.27).7 In this ar­
chetypal work of art created by the compassionate gods, that is, by di­
vine insight, Rudra-Vastoġpati and his world come to exist. The gods 
create this wonder-work when mankind is about to begin. And man's 
works of art will imitate or reRect the primordial works of art of the 
gods. 
In the lJ-g Veda myth of Rudra, the origin of mankind, beginning 
with the Angirases, the mythic Fire-youths, is interwoven with the cre­
ation of poetry, the archetypal act of art in divinis. Although in this 
myth man is not created in the image of god, the art of man is in con­
formable imitation of the wonder-works of gods. Works of art are 
substantiations of divine prototypes. They are their audible, visible, 
tangible, co,ncrete form. In rhythms and rites, the guardian of sacred 
order, Vratapa, surveys his domain. 
Even the gods do not always maintain the same high level of crea­
tivity. A version of the same myth shows them reacting differently to 
Prajapati's desire for his daughter. Because Prajapati was doing some­
thing that was not done before, they made a god to punish Pnijapati. 
They did not find one horrendous enough for the task, and so they 
put together the most appalling shapes. This aggregate became the 
avenger (AB .3.33). The gods here were far from benevolent, and 
were unconcerned with rhythms and rites. Prompted as they were by 
their fear and horror, they asked the dread aggregate who had be­
come "that god" (e,sa devaf,t) to pierce what was going on between 
Father and daughter, two antelopes, and were glad to grant "that 
god" the boon that he had asked, namely, lordship over the animals 
( pasuman) (AB .3.33; cf. SB . 1 .7.4.3). As a fiercely horrendous con­
glomerate and their agent, the Lord of Animals, Pas urn an or Pasupati 
earned this name as a reward granted by the frightened gods. 
The unnamed god of the lJ-g Veda hymn was made Lord of Animals 
by Prajapati. This title was given to the Wild Archer by the Lord of 
Generation in his predicament, so that he might be spared by him. 
This is what the Maitraya1J,l SaT!lhita (MS .4.2. 1 2) knows. The Aitareya

Brahma'IJ(1, however, tells of the same situation in a different spirit. 
Here it is not the Lord of Generation-persecuted animal that he is­
who asks a boon from the Wild Hunter, and rewards him by making 
him Lord of Animals. It is the gods who create a god by combining all 
the most dreadful shapes in order to avenge the intercourse of Praja­
pati with his daughter. This symplegma of horror they reward by 
making him, at his request, Lord of Animals. Obviously these gods 
did not like "that god," a projection of their own reactions. They did 
not have the eye to see what the gods of the lJ-g Veda hymn intuited 
who created the unnamed god, the guardian of the site, the guardian 
of sacred rites, Vastoøpati. 
The hunter, the unnamed god, was made Lord of Animals or Pa­
supati by the Lord of Generation for sparing his life. Or the gods cre­
ated a horrendous being-"that god"-whom they made Lord of An­
imals for piercing the Lord of Generation. But whether Pasupati 
acted mercifully or in fierceness, the seed of the Lord of Generation 
had fallen down on earth. Why did Rudra aim his arrow at Prajapati 
engaged in the procreative act? 
3. THE LORD OF YOGA 
The answer comes from far back in histori၈l time. On a seal (seal 
420) of the Harappan age of about the last part of the third millen­
nium B.C., a male figure is seen seated, enthroned in a particular yoga 
posture (siddha iisana), the feet crossed below the erect(penis (urdhva­
linga). Buffalo horns are the most conspicuous part of his headgear. 
Four animals surround this central figure.8 Other smaller reliefs also 
(between % in. and 1 Y2 in. square), though less rich and precise in de­
tail, show the seated yogi as the main or only figure. The throne or 
dais, in some of the reliefs, rests on bovine legs.9 While the yogic pos­
ture (asana) in each instance is indisputable, the specific swaha asana,

in which the crossed heels touch the testicles, is rendered in detail on 
the large seal only.lO It is also on the large seal only that a dispropor­
tionately large face sits on narrow shoulders covered by a striated pec­
toral. 
Whom this enigmatic figure represents cannot be ascertained. The 
other Harappan yogi figures have small faces with recognizably hu­
man features; bovine traits have possibly been integrated into the face 
of the large seal.l1 Although the enthroned figure with its large head 
and sex organ defies identification, it is like the other unidentified fig­
ures shown in a yoga posture. On either side of the enthroned yogi 
and above his arms, a tiger and an elephant are on his right, a rhinoc­
eros and buffalo on his left, and two antelopes are below, that is, in 
front of his throne. The composition of this steatite relief is hieratic. 
The horn-crowned and enthroned yogi figure forms an isosceles tri­
angle whose axis connects the middle of the bifurcating horns,12 the 
long nose, and the erect phallus of the deity. 
About two thousand years lie between the Harappan civilization 
and the formulation of the yoga system in the Yogasutra of Patanjali in 
the second century B.C. A similar time interval lies between the Ha­
rap pan reliefs and those of early Buddhist art, which embody motifs 
and principles of Harappa. 13 
Although seal 420 cannot be identified as a "proto-Siva," it shows 
one of several Harappan yogi representations. Bovine features are 
conspicuous in these reliefs. In later Indian art, Siva's particular cog­
nizance as a yogi is the urdhvalinga.14 The phallus or linga pointing 
upward and pressing against the abdomen is a visual convention ren­
dering the concept of urdhvaretas or the ascent of the semen (cf. Sa­
yal).a on TA . 1O. 1 2; MBh. 13.17.4S). The urdhvalinga is exclusively and 
almost universally characteristic of images of Siva through the two

millennia of the present era. It implies that no semen is allowed to 
leave the body; by controlling sexual power the semen held within is 
absorbed in the body. "Control of the seminal fluid is thought to entail 
control of all passions and the achievement of desirelessness."15 This 
yoga discipline, practiced to this day, and leading to supreme mystical 
cognition (samiidhi) would seem to underlie the pictorial symbol of the 
diminutive relief of the seal from Mohenjo-daro, a surviving token of 
a no doubt living Indian discipline of making the psycho-physical or­
ganism of man the place of metaphysical realization. The harnessing 
of the sexual urge and the mastery over its working have their image 
in Siva, lord of yogis, with the urdhvaliitga as his cognizance. Assuming 
that seal 420 shows the urdhvaliitga, a clay figure from Mohenjo-daro, 
though not in yoga posture, may be mentioned.16 The figurine, mod­
eled in the round, shows the male sex parts, although not the urdhva­
liitga, with similar distinction of treatment as in seal 420. This figurine 
is hermaphroditic; its rounded breasts show it to be female. It is the 
only surviving example of a bisexual kind. Sex symbolism links this 
figurine to the seated divinity of the seal, whose penis pointing up­
ward shows that the god has controlled sex. The standing figurine, on 
the other hand, includes both sexes in its appearance, as do Hindu 
images of Siva Ardhanarisvara more than two thousand years later, 
though these latter exhibit an altogether different mode of unifying 
division, in which the right half of the entire figure is male and the 
left half is female. It would seem; however, that a preoccupation with 
the signs of sex as carriers of meanings beyond their sexual function 
had its place in the imagery of Harappan art. The freedom in graft­
ing male and female parts on one figurine is akin to the meaningful 
spontaneity in which anthropomorphic and theriomorphic parts are 
coalesced. The god in yoga posture carries mighty buffalo horns on 
his head above a large face that is striated, As are the horns and their 
connecting central headgear, the arms, and the triangular pectoral. 
The parallel ridges are elements of form. The uncannily grooved, 
large face, with its large long nose, emphasizes the vertical axis of the 
figure, which is also the vertical axis of the entire hieratic configura­
tion of the seal. The grooves and ridges evolve a pattern of their own, 
while following the contour of the mask-like face. 
Harappan art dematerializes volume by translating it into complex

linear patterns of ridged parallels. These are formal idioms, not the­
matic motifs. 
The buffalo horns gracing the head of this figure and other figures 
in human shape in Harappan art impart bovine grandeur and signif­
icance to their appearance. The bull is one of the noblest and most 
frequently represented animals on the seals, often occupying the en­
tire seal but for its inscription. Other animals, however, are given the 
same distinction. And some of these -elephant and tiger, buffalo and 
rhino--also are shown in small size to the right and left of the majestic 
image of the enthroned buffalo-horned yogi. Two antelopes in front 
of but shown below the throne seat prefigure the two deer frequently 
carved on steles from the Gupta age, couchant in front of the throne 
seat of another yogi, the Buddha. The yogi seals are part of the rep­
ertory of Harappan seals, which often portray the animal as the main 
. figure. The combination, moreover, of man and animal in the repre­
sentation of deities belongs to Harappan art as much as the consort­
ing of gods who are envisioned in the shape of animals belongs to 
Vedic thought. 
About a millennium separates the Vedic from the Harappan age. 
Though the collection of the hymns of the lJ.g Veda was not completed 
before 1 ,000 B.C., some of its myths originated in a far remote past. 
In the lJ.g Veda the bovine species, whether as buffalo or bull, lends its 
glamor to the evocation of the gods. Agni, Indra, Soma, and VaruI,la, 
the principal Vedic gods, are invoked as buffaloes. Much less fre­
quently are they invoked as bulls. Indra is once praised as a buffalo 
great in "bull powers" (RV.3.46.2), the buffalo obviously taking prec­
edence over the bull. The difference is one not only of power but also 
of quality. The arch-god manifesting is the bull Asura (RV.3.38.4). He 
is bull and cOW (RV.3.38.7). He is Visvarupa or omniform (RV.3.38.4). 
Prior to manifestation he had no name. Agni, the Fire, is a bull when 
fully manifest; he is a buffalo in the lap of the waters (RV. 1O.8. 1) be­
fore he rises from them; there buffaloes made him grow (RV. 
10·45·3), and he is freed from this shape in which he dwelt in the 
depths (RV. 1 . 1 4 1 .3). The buffalo is Agni's shape in the waters, hid­
den, in his power. When he rises from the waters, his bull's roar is 
heard (RV. I0.8. 1). Soma, too, while in the water striving to acquire his 
final clarified state, is a buffalo (RV .9.96. 18-19; 9.97.40-41 ). The buf­
falo is power in potentiality, the bull is the power in act, in manifes­
tation. The buffalo stands for hidden potentiality; he is near to the 

14 • T H E  P R I MORD I A L  S C E N E  
source (cf. RV. 1O.5.7). In the hymn to Rudra that sings his praises as 
the most glorious in glory of all that is born and the strongest of the 
strong (RV.2.33.3), he is invoked as bull (RV.2.33. 1 S). But regardless 
of whether or not buffalo and bull signify different qualities of power, 
both bovines stand for power and the horns are its symbol. The buf­
falo horns of the yogic god of Mohenjo-daro, high on his head, are on 
either side of the central crest of the figure's headgear and of the ver­
tical axis that refers this tripartite device to the triune shape of the 
deity's sex organ through which it passes. Animal power and sex con­
trolled by yoga are coalesced in a pattern that renders the enigmatic 
likeness of the god of the Mohenjo-daro seal. 
Though animals as vehicles of deity are to be found neither in Ha­
rappan imagery nor in Vedic visions, in Hindu India Siva's vehicle 
(vahana) is the bull. The bull conveys the presence of Siva. The bull, 
particularly the Indian zebu, figures prominently in the iconography 
of Rudra. Siva is shown in anthropomorphic shape in front of the bull 
on one of the earliest unmistakably identifiable representations of 
Rudra-Siva.17 The Great God (Mahiideva) is praised in the Mahabha­
rata as the one who has the bull for his sign, the pride of a bull, the 
lord of bulls, represented by the horns of the bull, bull of buils, who 
has the mark of the bull, and so on (MBh.7.173.30-3 1 ). In Hindu In­
dia, the bull is Siva's animal. Lying contentedly and attentively, the 
bull as the image of Nandin, "delight," faces the temple of Siva. In 
South India, bulls have their stations on the corners of every story of 
the sanctuary of a Siva temple, or as in Mahabalipuram in the eighth 
century, they are arrayed on top of the surrounding wall of the Shore 
Temple. The bull, disciplined in its ;:power, represents dharma 
(VDhP .3.48. 1 8). Dharma is cosmic order aM righteous performance 
of one's duty. As such, the bull would belong to SivaJRudra, whom the 
raudra brahman knew as VastoĠpati, the lord of sacred ordinance (vra­
tapa). 
By whatever name the central figure of the Harappan seal was 
called, it embodies yoga power in its posture. The axis of its erect 
body is marked by the crossed feet below the urdhvalinga. Thence it 
ascends and carries the wide curves of the horns. Bovine power and 
yoga power are united in the hieratic form of the figure that domi­
nates the field.

RUD R A .  T H E  FIRE ' 15 
4. RUDRA, THE FIRE 
Lord of Animals-Lord of Yoga---only Rudra has these names and 
powers. No other god is known in such seemingly disparate majesty. 
In each of these forms Rudra is fully present. They are more than 
aspects, more than modes of his being. He has many aspects, many 
modes, many names-a hundred, a thousand. 
Of ruddy brown complexion, he shines in many colors (RV.2.33.8-
9) like fire (Agni). Indeed, Rudra is Agni and Agni is Rudra 
(TS.2.2. 1O.4; 3.5.5.2; 5.5.7.4; cf. MBh. 1 3. 1 46. 1 -2). They are one in 
nature, though not in intensity. Rudra is the terrible, frightening, 
quintessential Agni. He is the fury of Fire (TS.2.2.2.3). Like fire, but 
fiercer and even more luminous, wild, tremendous Rudra is fire, 
lightning, and the sun (MBh. 1 3. 1 46.4). Fire is the power of illumina­
tion and is concentrated in him. He burns; he is atrocious, and full of 
heat; like fire he devours flesh, blood, and marrow (MBh . 1 3. 1 46.7). 
The Wild God-the essence of fire-is in the fire, in the waters, in the 
plants; he has entered all beings (KaS.40.5; TS.5.5.9.3; cf. AV. 7.8 7. 1). 
Inwardly he marks them with his signature. "The names of the dif­
ferent manifestations of Rudra . . .  should be contemplated as written 
in fire inside the different parts of the body" (cf. AP.293.43-47).18 
Moreover, while Rudra is Agni, he also has other identities and acts 
under their names. These names, like Agni, conform with his essence. 
They are Pasupati, Lord of Animals; Sarva, the Archer; and Bhava, 
Existence. "These names, other than Agni, are full of stress (asanta). 
Agni is his most gentle (santatama) name" (SB. 1 . 7 '3.8). 
Rudra is Agni; he is the fierce essence of fire. Agni is Rudra's mild­
est form. Fierce, all-pervading, all-enlivening, all-consuming, Rudra 
holds the world in his power. He does not serve it, as does Agni-the 
fire of the hearth and of the altar. 
Agni himself had not wanted to serve gods and man as their chief 
priest in the sacrifice. He was reluctant to be yoked, tied to this office, 
as were his brothers formerly (RV. IO.5 1 .4, 6). Secretly he went away 
and entered the waters and the plants. Yet his splendor was seen shin­
ing in the waters by Yama, mortal man, and Agni yielded to the re­
wards and privileges that the gods held out for him. He took over the 
high office to which the three thousand three hundred thirty-nine 
gods had called him (RV. 1O.5 1 .3, 7-9; 10.52.6). Agni allowed himself

16 · THE P R I MORD I A L  SCENE 
to be tamed. Serving gods and man and becoming the sacrificial fire, 
he sacrificed his freedom. His sense of freedom had not carried him 
farther than into one abortive flight. In more than one sense is Agni 
the sacrifice (RV. 1O.88.v 
In his sacrificial role, hdwever, Agni was to play a part analogous, 
though transposed into the orbit of the sacrifice, to that of Rudra, the 
fierce archer. Agni himself is an archer. His arrows glow with heat 
(RV.4-4- I ), but in his office as priest he has no use for them. On the 
contrary, absorbed in sacred thought centered in his knowledge of 
cosmic order <rta) in its aeviternaltruth, he concurred with the Father 
when the latter, benefaction in mind, offered up his seed in his 
daughter (RV.3.31. 1). Then the Angirases were born (cf. RV.3.31.3). 
Agni is here the primordial, paradigmatic flame arising as the sa­
cred fire. Agni knows the cosmic order (rta), for he is its first-born in 
the earliest aeon (RV. I0.S.7). In this cosmically and sacrificially or­
dered universe-to-be, Agni and the Father are cooperating powers. 
The Father inseminating his daughter performs a cosmogonic rite to 
which the Angirases and ultimately man owe their position in an or­
dered world. No god is horrified in this case by the intercourse of the 
Father and his daughter. On the contrary, their intercourse is the es­
sential rite of this paradigmatic sacrifice, a sacrifice enacted in con­
formity with cosmic order in the presence of Agni, the primordial 
priest. 
Fire as Agni and Fire as Rudra play contradictory and consistent 
roles. The Wild God defends the Uncreate, the transcendental integ­
rity before the beginning of things. Agni, officiating in the sacrifice of 
which the cosmos is one counterpart and the ordered life of man-to­
be the other, celebrates the primordial rite that will lead to the crea­
tion of man. 
Agni celebrates the union of the Father and his daughter. The tar­
get of Rudra-Agni, the Wild Archer, is the incontinence of the Father 
that makes him shed into creation the substance of the Uncreate. 
Rudra avenges the violation, that is the rupture, of the Uncreate. 
Rudra-Fire and Archer-is Rudra Lord of Yoga and Guardian of 
the Uncreate. But the Lord of Generation's seed fell down on the 
earth. 
The congress of Father and daughter is essential to the primordial 
scene, whether it is staged in a sacrificial setting or in the wilderness 
of the first dawn of the world. In its sacrificial setting the question of 

R U DRA , T H E  F I R E · 1 7  
incest as something done anomalously and indecorously does not 
arise. Quite the contrary, the intercourse of Father and daughter is 
the very core of the rite that is for the good of the world. Agni, the 
sacrificial fire, had in view mankind and its life in this world. Agni­
Rudra, on the other hand, was outraged. He aimed his arrow of fire 
at the Father, not because it is his daughter with whom he has inter­
course but because it is the substance itself of the Uncreate that he is 
spending into procreation. Rudra acted as guardian and avenger of 
the Uncreate and metaphysical wholeness; Agni is the guardian ofrta, 
of cosmic order in creation and of human life lived in accordance with 
it. Though one in nature, Agni and Rudra face in opposite directions: 
Agni's concern is the life of man, and Rudra's concern is man's free­
dom from the contingencies of life, his reintegration into the absolute 
as it was and is from before creation. 
If Agni is the first-born ofrta in the first world age (RV. I0.5.7), he 
is also "born from the belly of the Asura" (RV.3.29. 14)/9 the ancient 
godhead. Agni has many births (RV . 10-45. 1-2; RV. 1O.5. 1 ), though in 
truth he "is always the child of himself," in that fire is born from fire. 
The fire-genealogy, a continuum in time, is spread through all forms 
of life. Using anthropomorphic terms, it gives Agni three mothers 
(RV. IO.45. 1 ), the three worlds of heaven, earth, and midair.20 They 
are his places of origin, or rather of manifestation. Rudra, similarly, 
is Tryambaka, "having three mothers" (RV.7.5g. 1 2 ;  VS .3.58, 60; 
SB .2.6.2. 14). He is manifest throughout the universe. Family and sex 
relations furnish spontaneously available metaphors. They evoke bi­
ologicaHy potent and particularly cogent images. If Agni is the son of 
three mothers, he is also "born from the belly of the Asura." The lat­
ter place of origin, more abstruse, more recondite than the maternal 
one, lies beyond the triple world. Or Agni is the father of the gods, 
though he is their son (RV. 1 .6g. 1 ), the gods here confirming by their 
intermediacy that Agni is always the child of himself. These multiple 
relationships are without sociological reference or moral overtones. 
They are conveyed as much by anthropomorphic as by theriomorphic 
figures. The intercourse of the creator with his hypostasis, the daugh­
ter, has the intimacy of fulfillment on either level. If the imagery is 
theriomorphic, two antelopes act with creaturely assurance in their 
'9 A. A. Macdonell. Vedic Mythology. 1 897. p. 90.

mother." 

1 8 · T H E  P R I M O R D I A L  S C E N E  
own state o f  grace. While i n  this universe of discourse Agni is genea­
logically his own child, ontically and in his theriomorphic image he is 
the "bull who is also the cow" (RV. 10.5.7).' Agni is complete in simul­
taneous male-female duality, and in this wholeness of being Agn i  is 
nearest to the perfection of the indefinable state of integrity before 
Agni or anything else was born or became manifest. 
The symbol of the bull who is also a cow is one of the ultimate met­
aphors at the very limit of thought and image whence the ineffable 
realm beyond creation has its measureless extent (RV. 1O.5.7). Bisex­
ual Agni, aeviternally child of himself, renews himself in each spark, 
in whatsoever form of life, from aeon to aeon. 
Only one at a time of the ultimate metaphors is beheld by the seer, 
at the end of his field of vision (d. RV . 10.5.6). In that sign the mystery 
of creation unfolds. Each sign at the edge of the world of thought and 
image is a key and a password to an insight from the limen into the 
cosmos. L'secl intellectually, the sign of Agni shines with the light of 
the first-born of cosmic order (rta ). This sign reAects into the world 
the principle of order as it works in the universe and in man. Expe­
rienced holistically, the ultimate sign of Agn i rises in the image of the 
bull-cow, a bisexual whole of cognitive and vital totality. sel£пsuffi­
cient, impregnated with the possibilities of generation. 
In the ongoing myth of Rudra-Siva, the bull-cow, a theriomorph of 
Agni, looms in the background of Siva Ardhanari'svara, the andro­
gyne (Ch. V I I ,  n. 15; Ch. V I I !.2). In this anthropomorphic androgy­
nous image the shape is recast less formidably as a symbol of whole­
ness based on the polarity of sex. The androgynous image remains an 
ultimate symbol of the creative fire as it lives in the myth of Rudra­
Siva. 
The fire myth of Rudra-Siva plays on the whole gamut of fire, val­
uing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumina­
tion. Of Agni and Rudra, cooperating powers to the point of identity, 
Agni is the first-born, and their roles are not always reversible. Agni 
acts in Rudra and Rudra exceeds him in intensity. He is Agni's incan­
descence. As such, Rudra is "king of the sacrifice" (RV -4-3. 1 ), "priest 
of both worlds" (TS. 1 .3. 14. 1 ), and "fulfiller of the sacrifice" (RV. 
1 .  1 14.4). Rudra, for not playing Agni's sacerdotal role, is overcom­
pensated and raised above Agni, the high priest. Paradoxically, Agni 
is praised as the Rudra of sacrifices (RV.3.2.5). Rudra did not main-

T I I  E A \' F ϭ G F R · I Ϯl 
tain this exalted position, and the story of his humiliation or self­
abasement and eyen exclusion from the sacrifice is longer and more 
\'aried than these lauds in the lJg Veda . 
The gods put all their faith and also all their trust in Agni. Once, 
when they anticipated a conflict with the Asuras-as they always had 
reason to-they deposited all their wealth with Agni. Having defeated 
the Asuras, they wanted back their wealth, but Agni had gone away 
with it. They pursued him, meaning to take it by f()]"ce. Agni cried 
(arodit). Hence Agni's name is Rudra (TS . 1 .5 . 1 . 1 ). By the same popu­
lar etymology, but in an altogether different context, Rudra got this 
name for himself. He cried as a newborn child because, being un­
named, he was not free from evil; hence he was gi\en a name 
(,B .6. 1 .3.9- 10). Or simply Rudra got his name because he roared 
(arodit; BD . 2 .34). 
The Taittiriya Saf!lhita story ( 1 .5. 1 .  I) has focused on Agni in one of 
his weak moments. H is escape on this occasion was not the pardona­
ble flight from the monotony of his office, but rather the flight of a 
thief. He betrayed the trust of the gods and found no better way to 
disarm them than to cry. I n  this way he got the name of, and became, 
Rudra. Rudra appears here as a humiliated Agni, or as Agni absolyed 
from his humiliation, whereas elsewhere he is extolled alxwe Agni. 
The light of tradition flickers in the assessment of the greatness of 
these two practically cognate gods. Agni, the Fire, here does not have 
the incandescence of the fierce Wild God who is Rudra, the frightful 
form of Agni (TS . 2 . 2 . 2 .3). 
5. T H E  AVENGER 
Rudra in the Vedic myth 0[' the primordial hunter and avenger 
showed himself in his yoga power. He let his arrow fly against the 
course of events in the cosmic drama that he as Fire had directed, hav­
ing prepared seed for the Father and having inflamed the Father with 
sexual passion. When Father Heaven vaulted over the first dawn of 
the world and his seed started to flow, the wholeness that was before 
the beginning of things was ruptured. Eternity flowed as time into a 
world of contingency, where blushing Dawn witnessed the seed of 
Prajapati as it fell on earth when he drew back from her. As the seed 
touched the earth, creatures were to arise from the primordial and 

2 0 ' T H E  P R I M O R D I A L  S C E N E  
partly frustrated embrace o f  Father Heaven. When the semen o f  the 
Lord of Generation touched the earth, it became a lake of fire 
(MLp!. 1 2). 
The Father played a precarious role. Frightened by the hunter, he 
begged Rudra to spare him, and made Rudra Lord of Animals ( Pa­
supati) (MS .4. 2 . 1 2). The Father had broken the state of wholeness 
that existed before the fall of the seed. This state is beyond words. I t  
is indescribable and inaccessible to the senses. I t  is "neither non being 
nor being" (RV .  10. 1 29. 1 ) .  But if that m uch can be said about it, it has 
also been said that it is "nonbeing and being" (RV. 1O.5.7), and that 
out of non being came being in the first age of the gods (RV. I O.72.2). 
It is then that the indefinable wholeness of the total absence or the 
total presence of both non being and being appears to recede and to 
set up the screen on which are seen the large figu.res of gods and their 
actions. This state of "neither nonbeing nor being," or simultaneously 
"nonbeing and being," is not within the range of thought. It is a 
plenum that defies definition, for it has no limits. Yet it is not chaos, 
the "darkness covered by darkness," said to have existed before the 
beginning of the ordered universe (RV. 1 O. 1 2g.3). In its precosmic, 
preconscious totality, everything is contained, including conscious­
ness and nothingness. Metaphysically, it did not cease when the cos­
mos came into existence, for it is not subject to time. Mythically, its 
wholeness had been injured . Mystically, its nameless plenum is inac­
cessible except in the state of samiidhi, the final stage of yoga leading 
to mok.5a , the total release from all contingencies. Words like plenum, 
totality, and wholeness are used here merely as symbols of the un­
create. 
ò 
Rudra, the guardian of the Cncreate, an indefinable transcendental 
plenum, avenged the infringement of that wholeness. He became the 
avenger of the descent of its substance, the semen, the "heavenly 
Soma,"21 into the cosmos. The arrow in his hand threatened the com­
ing into existence of life, and it disturbed the procreative act of the 
Father, the Lord of Generation, an act of incontinence sub specie aeter­
nitatis . Rudra, the avenger, is the Lord of Yoga and of self-contain­
ment. 
Rudra, the fierce god, is an avenger whose arrow never misses its 
target. Creation as procreation destroys the integrity, the wholeness, 
21 A. Bcrgaigne, La Religion 1,iidiqUf, 2 nd cd., 1 963 . 2 : 1 1 2 .  Bergaigne early identified 
these two, Soma and semen. For a later variation on this theme. cf. SP.6 J .68-69. 

THE A VENGER ' 2 1  
that was bef'ore the beginn ing of life. The Wild Archer stalks his prey. 
As the Great Yogi, he is the consciousness and conscience of the Un­
create whole. Thus he is cruel and wild-Rudra ; at peace w ithin him­
self and kind-Siva. Thus he acts in manifestation. Within his being 
lie fierceness and grace at opposite ends of one diameter. They ra­
diate from the center of his being. While he manifests himself in spe­
cific shapes or actions, it is he in his total being who is present. While 
he is the H unter and Avenger, he is also the Great Yogi and Lord of 
Animals. The animals, the wild creatures in the f'orest of l i fe, are at 
his mercy. Within man the microcosm, the animals are the passions. 
Rudra, the archer, aims at Father Heaven, and inasmuch as the 
Father embracing the daughter acrs according to his passionate na­
ture, the Father is Rudra's prey. Siva, the Great Yogi, tames and sub­
dues the animals that are the passions. On the Mohenjo-daro seal the 
Lord of Yoga is enthroned. Peacefully and calmly the forest animals 
are stationed around him. 
The Wild Hunter is Rudra, the raging Harne, lashing out, letting 
the arrow fly at the critical moment. Yet he neither prevented nor did 
he undo the act of the Father. Only in part did he frustrate it; or was 
he h imself part of it? Rudra is Agni. The fire flames in him. The fire 
within Rudra is also his tapas , the ardor of the ascetic discipl ine of 
yoga, of which he is the lord. Rudra is a fierce hunter (astr). This word 
connotes one who throws a weapon. It does not refer to the bow. Sim­
ilarly, the word for archer is i$viisa , one who throws an arrow. With 
his arrow Rudra hits his target, the Father at the moment of his be­
getting life-to-be, spending himself iрto creation, an act whereby he 
ra\'ages the selfсcontained integrity of the state before being came to 
be. Rudra callsed the seed of the Father to fall down to earth. But did 
not the avenger also avenge his own action? He h imself as Agni, in his 
own fervor, had prepared the seed far the Father. He now lashes out 
toward the Father and attacks him. The Aitareya Briihmuruz sees the 
seed that fell profusely, farming a lake surrounded and consumed by 
Agn i. At that moment "that god" of dread, fashioned by the gods, 
claimed as his own all that was left on the site of the conflagration 
(AB , 3,33-34). "That god," Rudra, claims what belongs to him as Pa­
supati and as Vastoµpati. As guardian and lord of the site, he claims 
what was left on the site. It is his. It was he who had caused the seed 
to fall. The events fallow one upon the other. They l ie ready in the 
meaning of the lJ-g Veda mantras, and are assigned their place much as

i n  the visual arts, when by means of "continuous" or "unilocal" 
narrative, one relief or painting shows the v<fi-ious incidents or phases 
of a story. As part of the story they are laid out one next to the other. 
Their simultaneous presence shows forth the entire story, and each 
verbal version makes more explicit one or the other part of the myth. 
Rudra is Agni, the Fire that heats the first passion in the cosmos and 
turns upon itself, burning to consume its action, avenging itself on it­
self. Father Heaven is only the locus of its consuming intensity. What­
ever fire remains in him is that of rage. 
In late Vedic and contemporary understanding, this creation myth 
of man is considered to have the incest of Father and daughter for its 
theme. In the beginning of things, however, when there was only the 
Father and the daughter created or hypostasized out of himself, one 
can hardly speak of incest. Besides, a condemnation of incest requires 
a society within which, if incest is committed, it would be judged ac­
cording to that society'S values. The Rudraic myth of creation is not 
an apotheosis orjudgment of social conventions. The gods of the rau­
dra brahman did not offer moral criticism. On the contrary, at th is oc­
currence, this infringement of pre-existential wholeness, the gods in 
their concern made a magically potent fXlem, and out of the fabric of 
this creation they gave shape to the lord of the dwelling, Vastoµpati, 
that guardian of sacred order. The seed had fallen to earth, the place 
of sacrifice whence man and gods by means of the sacrifice ascend to 
heaven. 
I n  the Matsya Purafla , compiled midway between the Vedic and our 
present age, in the third to hfth centuries after the beginning of the 
present era, a king muses over the Creator's passion for his daughter. 
" Tell me why he was not regarded as having committed a fearful 
sin[?]" (MP-4- 1 ).22 The answer is that only men have such doubts, for 
they have physical bodies, and it is very difficult for them with their 
gross bodies to understand the primeval creation that is celestial and 
mysterious. A more than human mind caused it. Only those whose 
minds are of the same kind can understand its great secret. The gods 
know no code of prohibition, while beings with physical bodies mllst 
not think of doing the same thing (MP -4-3-6). 
The Mat.lya Purar.ta removes imputed guilt from the Creator's em­
brace. The transgression of the Creator, however, is not his violation 
22 Ma/.lya Purrltl,a (;\11') , tr. "A Taluqdar of Oudh , "  1 9 1 6. pan I, p. 1 2 .

o f  h is daughter. The divine mating of Father and daughter i s  a sym­
bol of ontic truth. Elsewhere, primal being, nearest to the wholeness 
of the Uncreate, is male and female in one. Agni is a "bull-cow" 
(RV. 10.5.7), two opposites in one, a bisexual fiery deity as large as the 
cosmos. "Dak$a is born from Aditi, Aditi from Dak$a" (RV. 1O.72.4). 
Words denoting genitals, sex relations, and sex acts are as obvious in 
their connotation as they are mysterious in their implications; they are 
universally intelligible symbols of creation in process. Sexual union, 
engendering, or birth-giving, in this context, are metaphors that 
evoke situations beyond what is possible or sanctioned among mor­
tals. Such metaphors shock because they touch the springs of life in 
con figurations that are unknown, even unacceptable, to mortals. 
Lifted from human bodies and transferred to those of animal symbols 
or to unembodied entities, they enter into combinations whose truths 
play on strings of meaning of deepest resonance. 
Superhuman powers fecundate and generate one another in the 
cosmos, just as ideas do in the world of man. Aditi, "/x)llndless" and 
all-embracing femininity, and Dakµa, "competent," male potency ef­
hcient throughout Aditi's realm, give birth to one another. Fire burns 
in either sex, and unites male and female in the gigantic image of the 
cosmic bull-cow, who is stationed on that frontier of human under­
standing beyond which words and images do not reach (cf. RV. 1O.5.6-
7). The daughter with whom the Father cohabits is a hypostasis of the 
Father himself. She was one with him before he knew her. Ardha­
nari'svara, Lord Siva, is male on the right side and female on the left. 
As the Purarws know him, Siva is one who divides himself into god 
and goddess, Siva and Siva. Then, for a thousand years he did not 
cease in his ardent love making to Siv:1 (d. SP. 2+ 1 . 2 7-28). Their love 
has not been considered incestuous by anyone. 
Myths of creation in the lJ-g Veda had a long past before Vedic seers 
sang of them . Not all the subsey uent narrators who retold them, how­
ever, were equal in understanding. The tabu of incest plagued and 
diverted those who could not dare or were unable to face the Un­
create, the metaphysical plenum. They were compelled to stop before 
one of the "seven barriers" (RV. l ()'5.6) at the end of the way of hu­
man undersтanding. 
According to the Aitareya Brahma'IJa , the gods were manifestly hor­
rified by the close contact of Prajapati with h is own daughter 
(AB ·3.33). Their shock can be understood on metaphysical-and, by 

2 4
· T H E  P R I M O R D I A L  Se E '\I £<:  
transfer, also on astronomical-grounds. Prajapati, pierced, sprang 
up and became the constellation M.rga (the antelope; Orion). He who 
had shot him became the constellation Mrgavyadha ("the Hunter of 
the Antelope" ; Sirius); Prajapati's daughter became the constellation 
RohiI)1 (Aldebaran). The arrow became the constellation TrikaI)Qa 
(the belt of Orion) (AB .3.33 ; d. below, Ch. 11-4). The story is "written 
in the stars," for the movement of Prajapati toward his daughter was 
observed in the sky when the sun was about to rise. 
The gods of the lJg Veda responded to the love-making of father 
and daughter and to the seed that was shed by making a poem. It was 
only much later that the gods of the Brahma1Jas were shocked by what 
they had seen (AB .3.33; /.,B . 1 . 7+ 1 -2 ;  cf. TmB .8.2. 10). In the lJg Veda 
(RV.3.3 1 . 1 -3), the intercourse of the father with his daughter was the 
center of a sacred rite conducted by Agni. If the gods of the Aitareya 
Brahmafla were shocked by what they saw, they j udged by social stand­
ards of human behavior. These, however, were not the only ones, 
even in the Aitareya Brahmafla . Dawn had been created by the Father 
and he united with her. No mother is known to have given birth to 
her. U µas appeared before Father Heaven as the dawn of a first morn­
ing. Father Heaven covered this blushing maiden, part of himself, 
discernible and other from himself, only to be united with h imself. 
They are not two persons but one self-begotten, begetting entity. Be­
fore Cµas appeared she was in the Father, now the Father is in her. 
Their mythical sex contact is of a kind that the Aitareya Brahma1Ja-in 
another context-assigns even to the human condition when it speaks 
of the son who mounts his mother and his sister (AB .7. 1 3). Paradoxi­
cally, no incest is implied. The ambience of this seemingly incestuous 
relationship is different, wider, and at the same time more unified 
than that of four persons forming a family of father, son, mother, and 
sister. Their physical relationship serves here as a symbol of the con­
tinuous transmission of the substance of the Uncreate. "The father 
entereth the wife, / Having become a germ (he entereth) the mother, / 
In her becoming renewed, / He is born . . . .  The gods said to men / 
"This is your mother again." / . . . Therefore a son his mother / and 
his sister mounteth. / This is the broad and auspicious path / Along 
which men w ith sons fare free from sorrow" (AB .7. 1 3).23 Less provoc­
atively, is it said in the Mahabhiirata that a man entering his wife is 
23 Aitareya Bnlhmarta (AB) . tr. A .  B. Keith. 1 920, p. 300.

again born therefrom (MBh. I .68.36). This reciprocal position is viv­
idly described in the Yogatattva UjJan0ad: "the breast he once sucked 
he now presses and derives pleasure from, delighting now in the gen­
itals from which he was born. She who was his mother is now his wife, 
and she who was his wife is now his mother. He who is now the father 
\\·ill again be the son, and he who is now the son will be the father 
again" (YUjJ. 1 3 1 -33). 
Procreation, the continuity of life, is not an ever-renewed incest 
committed with her whom "the gods and the seers brought together 
as great brilliance" (AB .7. 1 3).24 She arose in that first morning when 
the Father, seeing her next to himself, mounted her to become his 
SOIL It was then that the seed was shed-the immortal substance out 
oft he Uncreate that had been ruptured . 
Within a holistic experience of life, sex assigns reciprocal roles to 
the inbmt at the mother's breast and to her lover. while in the begin­
ning the Creator embraced his daughter, a hypostasis from within 
himself in which he asserts himself. To this act of seif-lO\ e, the emis­
sion of seed is biologically a sequel and metaphorically a jolt to the 
unassailable and undiminished metaphysical plenum. The inter­
course of the Creator with his daughter is the two-faced symbol of the 
rupture of pre-existential wholeness and of the descent to earth of its 
immortal substance, the seed of life. 
This portentous act at the dawn of the world , before the beginning 
of man's life on earth, is the infringement of the Lncreate and pre­
existential wholeness, a spurt from selfиcontained fullness, the loss of 
integrity o f  the absolute. The state before creation is beyond the po­
larity of opposites. I t  is as vast as chaos, but having no qualities what­
soever, it lacks disorder. It is known in later Indian mystical realiza­
tion as brahman ; it is realized through samiidhi (at-onement) as mok$a 
(release), nin1arw (extinction of the Hame of life), Hmyata (emptiness). 
These names apply to an inner realization of that state beyond the last 
frontiers of thought (d. RV. IO.5.6-7). The archer, whose arrow hits 
the Father at the very moment when the Father is spending himself 
into creation, acts as avenging consciousness and guardian of the Un­
create in defense of its integrity. The arrow and the shot of the archer 
are decisive symbols in the myth, though they were only partly effec­
tual in the course of its events. Indeed, the arrow hit just a fraction of 
" Ibid.

a moment too late. Meant to prevent the act, the flowing of the seed, 
the shot failed to prevent its consequences. The failure in timing at 
the dawn of the world was due to time itself, for the latter had not set 
in as yet; it was just about to begin. The transition from an integer 
without dimension of space and time into existence is a danger zone 
between eternity and the passing moment. It lies between metaphysics 
and myth. Had the timing been perfect, the flying arrow of Rudra 
would have prevented the coming into existence of man and the flow­
ing down 011 the earth of the substance of the Uncreate. 

II 
THE ARCHER 
1 .  THE ARCHER KйSANL; 
Another archer o f  similar mission did not do better. H is name is 
Krsanu (RV + 2 7.3). Krsanu was a Gandharva (TA . 1 .9.3). The Gan­
dharvas were the guardians of Soma (RV.g.83-4; SB '3.6.2 .g, 1 7), the 
elixir of immortality, the elixir of inspiration. A falcon had stolen the 
Soma from the eternal abode of the Gandharva (RV. 1 .2 2 . 1 4; 4.27.3). 
The falcon was l ndra himself (RV +26.3-7), the creator of (his) cos­
mos. As the falcon winged from heaven to bring Soma to Manu, to 
man, the sacrificer (RV+ 26-4), fear seized Indra of Krsanu, the 
archer (RV+27.3; 9.77.2), Soma's wondrous (adbhuta) warden in the 
beyond (RV.g.83 -4)' lndra was afraid of Krsanu. When the sun-horse 
had been Ix)rrl, rising from the ocean, and Indra had mounted it, the 
Gandharva took the reins (RV. 1 . 163. 1-2). Even so, Krsanu's arrow 
only grazed the flying falcon and a feather of his wing fell down to 
the earth (RV.4.27.3-4). 
The Gandharva's station is beyond the gods. "The gods are this side 
of the creation" (RV. I O. 1 2g.6).1 The Gandharva precedes creation ; 
he is the creative Soma-inspiration within the seer in sacred secrecy, 
when Soma h imsel f is about to speak from within the seer, when "the 
seer makes surge the wave from the ocean" (RV . 10. 1 2 3.2) of his heart, 
and on its crest, Soma, the Gandharva, is born (d. RV.g.86.36), the 
radiant Sun (RV.g.86. 2g). The Gandharvas were the guardians of 
Soma, the self-defense within creativity lest it be disturbed and squan­
dered before the Gandharva rises, directed h itherwards, carrying his

multicolored weapons, clad in fragrant raiments, looking like the sun 
and making manifest his names (RV . 1 O. 1 23.7). The Gandharva 
KI:sanu, like other Gandharvas, was the Guardian of Soma, of inspi­
ration-prior to finding words, prior to acquiring form, at the instant 
before its status nasceruii. Unlike Rudra, the Asura of heaven (RV. 
2 . 1 .6), the Gandharva is not the guardian of the Uncreate, but of the 
state between the Uncreate and creation. For this reason, it is the Gan­
dharva who guards the virgin. She belongs first to Soma, then to the 
Gandharva, then to Agni, the Fire (RV. 1 O.8S.40-44); but it is the Gan­
dharva who is invoked to cede her to her husband (RV. 1O.8S. 2 1 -22). 
The role of the Gandharva as the guardian of the virgin, though 
short-before Agni takes possession of the bride-belongs to the bor­
derland between the state of integrity as it was before creation and its 
loss in creation. 
Rudra, the Asura of heaven, the Great Yogi who withholds h is seed, 
and the Gandharva, Kdanu, both aimed well, though not quite on 
time, and they were not fated to carry out their intent fully. Soma was 
stolen from its place of origin on high, and was brought by the falcon 
down to earth, the place of sacrifice where also fell the seed of Father 
Heaven. Both archers, ill-fated guardians of the integrity of a super­
human, deathless state, were defending the already lost cause of an 
all-inclusive, homogeneous totality. Henceforward metaphysical real­
ity vaults over and is the ground and background of a cosmogony that 
occupies and animates the stage contiguous with, but this side of, 
transcendency. 
Of KI:sanu, the celestial archer and guardian of Soma, the Elixir of 
immortality, nothing more was heard. His arrow became a serpent, its 
vehemence a second serpent, and its Hash a third (AB .3.26). Like 
lightning and falling stars, these serpents shot across and vanished 
from the firmament. After KI:sanu's failure, their light, like that of ex­
tinguished stars, did not flare up again. But the Haming arrows of 
Rudra dart across the mythic cosmos. Again and again their fire con­
sumes a world, and life arises in a new aeon in a renewed mode. It 
was Agni, the Fire, the savage hunter, who is Rudra, the Wild God, 
who made ready the seed for the Father, who made passion Hare up 
in him. Outraged with pain, the Father, the Lord of Generation, 
foamed. Insensate with pain he tottered, the dart sticking in his 
wound. That hurt bit of flesh was to trouble the minds of generations 
of priests and bards, from the accounts of the Briihma'lJ£ls to the stories

told i n  the Puril1:ws. I t  had to be atoned for in myth and rites. There 
was a debt to be paid for it by creation, to be expiated by sacrifices. 
This primordial assault on Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, who 
himself had violated pre-existential totality, was the bond in creation 
between the abiding and paradoxically inviolate pre-existential integ­
rity, the fire of creation, and the agony of the Lord of Generation, 
that foaming bull, the primordial sacrificial victim. Had Agni-Rudra, 
the avenger of the shed seed of creation, and Krsanu, the guardian of 
the elixir of immortality,2 timed their intervention more accurately 
than they d id, creation would not have come about, and once it had, 
mankind would have been deprived of the elixir of immortal ity. But 
each guardian of the lincreate was overtaken by time, by that split 
second that had escaped from eternity at its rupture, when the falcon 
raped the Soma plant and when Agni-Rudra, the creative Fire, made 
ready the seed for the Father. Overtaken by time, Rudra aimed at the 
Father the burning arrow of his wrath. 
Krsanu, the Gandharva, had meant to prevent the descent of Soma 
to gods and man from within the plenum whence a falcon had stolen 
it. The other archer, Rudra, the Wild God, had meant to prevent an 
outflow of semen from that very plenum into creation. Neither suc­
ceeded, but while Krsanu, the archer. is not remembered (except for 
his defense as guardian of Soma, and for his defiance of the cosmos 
as it was meant to be-partaking in exalted moments of the plenum 
that was and is bef()re creation), Rudra the archer renews his assault 
011 the Creator from aeon to aeon. 
In addition to Rudra, the god, and Krsii.nu, the Gandhana, both 
archers, the nameless, f()J'mless plenum had a third formidable 
guardian. He was not an archer. He was Vrtra, the cosmic serpent. 
Vrtra moved coiling around the as yet unmanifest cosmos; the ser­
pent kept its rivers enclosed and thereby prevented their flowing 
down to earth. These three guardians of the Cncreate, containing the 
lite-giving moist me irradiated by a light unrevcaled, failed in their 
mission. A falcon brought Soma for gods and mortals to drink; the 
Father, the Lord of Generation, let flow the semen for mortals to con­
tinue existence on earth. Indra, the creator of the universe of an ear­
lier aeon, smote the serpent Vrtra.:1

Indra killed Vl,'tra, and the waters of heaven flowed down to the sea 
(RV . 1 .32.2). The body of dead Vl,'tra lies at the foot of the waters 
(RV. 1 .32.8), in the abyss, the body of his mother Danu recumbent on 
him (RV. 1 .32.9). Over the dead bodies of mother and son the uni­
verse came to be, and the sun rose for the first time (cf. RV.2. 1 g.3; 
1 .5 1 -4). I ndra, by killing Vrtra, a brahmin, brought on himself the 
heinous sin of brahminicide (BhP .6. 1 3.4). According to later texts, 
while I ndra made flow into the world the waters that Vrtra had held 
captive, by slaying Vl,'tra he brought forth brahminicide, causing ter­
ror and fear in this world (MBh . 1 2.273 . 1 O; BhP .6. 1 3.7- 1 2, I g-20). 
Fear seized him (RV. 1 .32. 1 4). 
In the presence of the dimensionless plenum or absolute, the 
drama of creation was enacted. Creation departs from the perfection 
of the unconditioned state. Thus it is flawed from the moment of its 
origin. In the precarious beginning, as swift as thought, the gods, as 
the seed of the Father was falling, compassionately filled the scene 
with the magic of their poem. Out of its substance they shaped Vas­
toµpati, the guardian of sacred order. "Vastoµpati is Rudra" (TS. 
3.4. 1 0.3). Rudra, the archer, the avenger, arose at the violation of 
pre-existential wholeness that he failed to prevent, having ambiva­
lently even provкked that violation. Now, irreversibly, within crea­
tion, the integrity that was before the beginning had been ruptured. 
Rudra was created by the gods in the poem of Rudra, the raudra brah­
man, as Vastoďpati, Vratapa, the guardian of sacred order. The shape 
of Vastoďpati has been given to him by the rhythms of the mantras. 
V astoďpatj, the guardian of the vasta, arises as the guardian of sacred 
order here on earth. He is Rudra, the avenger of the rupture of the 
absolute, but he is also Rudra-Agni, who himself has caused that rup­
ture by having prepared the seed for the Father. The seed fell when 
Rudra threatened to let fly the arrow, lashing out against the Father, 
the Lord of Cлneration, who made Rudra Lord of Animals, Pasupati. 
Pasupati and Vastoďpati both denote Rudra. They are his t itles from

self as the protector of sacred order-the guardian of cosmic rhythms 
and human rites. The rauciTa brahman , the poem of Rudra, is the pri­
mordial word of power sustained by the reality of Rudra that it 
evokes. 
The arrow that Rudra had aimed at Prмapati remained in the 
wound of t:Je Lord of Generation, Prнjapati, who is the sacrifice 
(,5B . 1 .7+4) and the primordial sacrificial victim. The arrow in the 
flesh of Prajapati was not extracted : the bit had to be cut out 
(,5B . 1 . 7AA-5)' Even so, the potency of the cut-out bit of flesh did not 
diminish in the continuing myth of Rudra. It wreaked havoc among 
the gods when it was offered to them at the sacrifice (SB . 1 .7 +6-8; 
TS . 2.6.8·3-7)· 
The primordial discharge of Rudra's arrow against the Father 
marked the direction of his operation in the cosmos. The arrow 
aimed at the act of generation. I t  Hew in the opposite direction of the 
generative emission of the father. Its countermovement is consonant 
with that of yogic and tantric discipline, according to which the draw­
ing up of the seed (11rdhvaretas ; cf. Sayal!a on TA . I O. I 2 ;  MBh. 
13. 1 7A5) has its mystical psychosomatic equivalent in the upward 
flow of the sex power. I ts phases are realized as it ascends through the 
subtle centers (cakras) of the body, including the h ighest center of 
mind, which it fecundates, being itself transubstantiated into the nec­
tar that contributes to the state ofsamiidhi, where integration, oneness 
is realized. The cosmic equivalent of the realization of this state of 
oneness is the uncreate that was and is bef(>re the beginn ing of 
things. The arrow of Rudra was directed into the cosmic scene of the 
myth, w hile yoga is effected w ithin the body of the yogi. Rudra-Siva 
is the lord of yogis and the Lord of Yoga. Later Vedic traditions con­
centrated on the wound inflicted by the arrow of Rudra, on the con­
tinued potency of his dart with in the flesh of the victim, on the magic 
of its devastating power. 
Rudra, the Wild God, the Archer fierce as fire, is the guardian of 
the encreate. Rudra-PaslIpati is the Lord of Animals, of creatures 
wild and tame. The creaturely world of which man is part is his do­
main. Rudra-Vastowati is the guardian ofthe dwelling that is the cos­
mos. He is at the same time the guardian and lord of the site on earth, 
the site of the sacrifice. As Vratapa he guards the order of the cosmos 
in the rhythms of the rites, in the rhvthms of all art. 
Soma is the elixir of immortality. It was brought to gods and men

from abu, where it had been raped by a falcon. The arrow o f  Krsanu, 
the archer, grazed the falcon but could not prevent the coming down 
of Soma. Krsanu's target was the falcon, who was Indra himself. 
Rudra's target was Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, the Father who 
lX)ured down on earth the semen, a liquid as precious as Soma. By 
rape and incontinence, powers of creation and procreation came 
down to earth from the Uncreate. It had never been tapped before, 
nor depleted. Hencei(}rward it would be known in its fulness by a re­
turn to it in the state ofsamiidhi or in moments of creative intuition. 
2 .  SARVA, THE ARCHER 
Rudra is Sana (VS . 1 6.28; AV .6.93. 1 ,  2). The word Sana is derived 
from .I:aru , "arrow." The arrow is the essential attribute of Rudra; it 
has three parts and is joined w ith Kalagni, the fire of destruction 
(MBh.7. 1 73 -47-48). Sana was born out of what was cruel in the gods 
(jB .3.262). He is the archer who stalks his prey and is made Pasupati, 
Lord of Animals. It is this fiery self of his that Rudra injected into the 
Father. The cruelty of Sarva is the h ighest degree of Rudra's inten­
sity. The arrow weapon and metaphor of Rudra's IX)wer is charged 
with it. Agni-Rudra-Sarva are of one essence; they are names of de­
grees of the same power. The Father, the Lord of Generation, Praja­
pati, is its essential target. Subsequently, when living beings have 
come to be, they are exposed to the fatal arrows of the god. Agn i  is 
"like a fierce archer" (RV.6. 1 6'39),4 but Rudra is the archer who lets 
fly the piercing arrow (RV. 2.33. 1O, 1 4; 5.42. 1 1 ;  6.28·7 ; 7-46. 1 ;  
10. 1 25.6; VS·3·6 1 ;  1 6. 1 , 3, 9, 1 8, 20, 2 1 , 2 2-23 in particular, 50, 52, 
53; AV·4·28. 2 ;  6·93 · I ;  
10. 1 .23) from his yellow, golden bow 
(AV. l 1 .2 . 1 2). The primordial target of the arrow was the procreative 
act of the Father. Only after this fateful scene could the arrow be di­
rected toward creatures. As Sarva, Rudra hunts in this our world. 
The great hymn of the Yajur Veda addressed to Rudra of a hundred 
shapes, known as the Satarudnya, in its opening verse pays homage to 
the wrath and to the arrow of Rudra (VS . 1 6. 1 ;  TS +5. 1 . 1 ). The arrow 
now flies downward from heaven to earth (RV.7-46.3). It is Sarva who 
hurls the shaft of lightning (AV. I 0. 1 .2 3), the visible cosmic equivalent 
' IJ.g Veda Sarrthita (RV) , tr. M. N. Dutt, 1906, p. 1 02 1 .  

S A R V A ,  T H E  A RC H E R · 3 3  
o f  the fiery wrath of Rudra. I t  i s  also said of Rudra, though once only 
(RV.2 .33.3), that he wields the thunderbolt (vojra), which is Indra's 
(RV. 1 .32.2) and Brhaspati's (RV. 1 .40. 8; AV. l l . lO. 1 3) weapon. Thun­
der and l ightning are evocative symbols. They manifest the power of 
a god that is neither confined nor defined by them. They are its signs 
and have their verbal and visual figures in art: the arrow of Rudra 
and the vajra of Indra and Brhaspati. (Inasmuch as Rudra is Agni and 
Agni is the twin brother of Indra [RV,6'59,2], Indra and Agni-Rudra 
are twin brothers,) In the myth of Rudra it is Prajapati who plays the 
role of the Father, while in the Puraflas this role is played by Brahma, 
Each of these celestial actors plays in his own way the paradigmatic 
role of the Father. 
Unlike Rudra, Indra severed his bond with the Father. Indra slew 
him and made his mother a widow (RV -4- 1 8, 1 2). Rudra'9 assault on 
the Father was both an act of revolt and an act of involvement. As 
Agni, he prepared the seed for the Father and made h is passion flare 
lip. Turning against his own commitment, Agni-Rudra then directed 
the arrow against the Father. and the passion of his interrupted em­
brace turned into fury. All the gods abandoned Prajapati except one, 
:Vlanyu. "Wrath" (,ÖB .g, 1 .  1 .6). 
It is Agni, the creative fire, w ho prepares the seed and inflames the 
Father toward the creative act. It is Rudra whose arrow h its the Father 
and interrupts the creative act. The arrow is aimed toward the origin 
and against the emission of the seed. Moreover, as Agni prepares the 
seed, he is the primeval agent who acts on the Father. As Agni-Rudra 
he is the protagonist of the drama of creation, leading into it and lash­
ing back, letting the arrow fly against it. 
His arrow will be set flying in the cosmos in the myth of Rudra at 
the sacrifice of Daksa, and it will pierce the triple city of the demons, 
the Asuras, This arrow too will be set flying by Rudra within man, in 
inner realization. Then "the syllable A UM is the bow, the atman (self ) 
is indeed the arrow ; bmhman (ultimate reality) is its target; carefully 
should it be pierced. Thus one becomes united with it like the arrow 
(with its target)" (MUP.2.2-4; RHUp.38). At the inception of creation, 
however, nothing less formidable than the violation of the absolute, 
ultimate reality, the Uncreate, was the target of Rudra's arrow. 
Rudra, the avenger of the violation, has the fierceness of Sarva, the 
archer. He destroys like a terrible wild animal (RV. 2.33. 1 I ), His ar-

3 4 '  T H E  A R C H E R  
rows bring death. "Whatever destroys any existing thing, movable or 
stationary, at any time, is . . .  Rudra" (VP. 1 .2 2 .39).5 H is power is 
deadly. Like a gourd from its stalk, he cuts off life or spares it (cf. 
RV.7.5g. 1 2). As Pasupati, he spared the life of animals. The archer 
has the power over life and death. He may avert or restrain h is arrow. 
This is the grace by which he frees from death. He is the liberator. 
Though in the lJ-g Veda the Wild Hunter is not called Sarva, his ar­
row (saru), unlike that of any other god, not only makes precarious 
the life of man and beast, it is a particular threat to the yet unborn, 
and to the seed itself. In a hymn to Agni, the singer inquires of Agni, 
the sacrificial fire and messenger between the sacrificer and the gods, 
what Agni will say to Rudra, the killer of man. Which seed w ill Agni 
commend to wide-striding Viµl)u, which seed will he expose to the 
great arrow (of Rudra) (RV -4-3.6-7)?6 Rudra's piercing arrow is di­
rected toward the seed, toward nascent life, which lies protected 
within the span of Viµl)u's three footsteps, from the earth to the em­
pyrean (d. RV. l .  1 54. 2-5 ; 1 . 1 55.3-5)' Rudra in his most cruel form is 
Sarva. H is single-pointed arrow traverses the security of Viµl)u's do­
main, unless Rudra in his grace (mirj,hvas) (RV . 1 . 1 1 4.3) unstrings his 
bow. "In the later Vedas the comparative and superlative of this word 
[mirj,hvas] have only been found in connection with Rudra."7 His ex­
treme fierceness is offset by his extreme grace. Rudra is Sarva as 
much as he is Siva. He is the Asura of heaven (RV.2. 1 .6), the ruler 
(i.5ana) of this great world (RV.2.33.9). 
H is is the arrow (.SB . 2.6.2.3), the power of death. For this reason 
the tryambaka offerings belong to Rudra ( 1 ,  3). They consist of rice 
cakes. Tryambaka offerings were made to protect from Rudra's arrows 
the descendants, born and unborn, of the sacrificer, one cake for each 
descendant and one more for the issue not yet born. The cakes would 
deliver each of the descendants from Rudra's power. The rite took 
place on a crossroad, for the crossroad was Rudra's favorite haunt. A 
piece was cut out of each cake, except the cake for the yet unborn 
child, and offered to Rlldra (SB . 2 .6.2 '3-9)' That additional cake was 
buried in a mole hill w ith the words, "This is your share, 0 Rudra, the 
mole is your animal" (SB . 2.6. 2 . 1 O). The cake was buried and con-

cealed, for a n  embryo i s  concealed. B y  this offering, the unborn de­
scendants were delivered from the power of Rudra. 
Rudra's arrow is directed toward the seed and the embryo. For the 
yet unborn a special offering was made, larger by Rudra's part than 
the cakes offered for the welfare of the living descendants. Moreover, 
the cake for the embryo had to be buried in a mole hill and con­
cealcd-Rudra was given no part of it; instead, the mole became 
Rudra's victim. The mole was Rudra's share. Rudra would not claim 
the embryo, though Rudra is greedy like a jackal for embryo Hesh 
(\Ia'p' 30. 2 1 2). However, the rest of the cakes for the living de­
scendants were offered to Rudra. They were put in a basket, then at­
tached to a tree or post or a bamboo pole or an ant hill. These were 
Rudra's provision to take with him beyond Mount M l"uavat, with his 
Ix)w unstrung (.ÖB . 2 .6. 2. 1 7). The embryo, the seed, procreation itself, 
was the special target of Rudra's arrow. He first had let it fiy against 
the procreating Father. 
Sana, as a name and fc)rm of Rudra, is invoked together with 
Yama, the god of death, and with Death itself (M nyu ; AV .6.93. 1 ), but 
more Frequently he is invoked together with Bhava (existence) 
(VliP .3o. 1 R8). Sarva the archer and Bha\"a the king (AV.6.93.2) are as­
pects of Rlldra's power here on earth. For this reason, once Rudra is 
born on earth, the first name given to him by his father, Prоjapati, is 
Bhava, according to one tradition (KB .6.2), and it is Rudra, with Sana 
as the second name, according to another (58 .6. 1 .3. 1 0- 1 1 ). Inasmuch 
as the hunter and king are aspects of Rudra, the arrow is their 
weapon, and homage is paid to B hava, to Rudra, and to Sarva 
(\IS . 1 6.28). K ing Bhava is Rudra, the lord of heaven and earth, the 
spacious atmosphere, and all directions (AV. l l .2.27); he as much as 
Sarva hurls his weapon against evil-doers and sorcerers (AV. I O. 1 . 2 3). 
Ethical discrimination would be the prerogative of Bhava the king; 
Sana by himself would be less selective in choosing his victim. King 
and hunter, however, are one in Rudra, and both together are in­
\'oked to be gracious, grant happiness, remove sins, and lengthen life 
(AV.8. 2·7)· Within the totality of Rudra they are Fire (Sana) and 
Water (Bhava) (KB .6. 2-3), Primarily however" it was the eastern peo­
ple who called Agni Sarva, whereas the Bahikas, a people of the west­
ern Panjab (?), called him Bhava (5B . 1 .7.3.8). Agni Hames up in many 
tongues. I nasmuch as Rudra is Agni, both gods are invoked by names 

36 
• T H E  A R C H E R  
they have in common, while none of the names by itself comprises the 
totality that is Rudra. 
In the beginning, at the moment of horror, the gods put together 
their most dreadful shapes and created "that god" (AB .3.33). Accord­
ing to theJaiminiya Briihmarta, they put what was cruel in themselves 
into two earthen bowls (sariiva). Because he is born from two earthen 
bowls (sariiva), therefore is he so called (i.e., Sarva) (jB .3.262). The 
earthen bowls to which Sarva here is said, by popular etymology, to 
owe his name guard the unspeakable horror of that god. 
3. RUDRA, THE HEALER 
Dreadful are the arrows of Rudra in creation. He takes aim, with a 
thousand eyes and a thousand arrows (cf. KB .6. 1), toward men and 
beasts, and is invoked to spare them. He may refrain from hunting 
his devotees or heal the wounds that he has inflicted, for he carries in 
his hands not only fiery arrows and the bow (RV.2·33· 1O, 14; VS.16.3), 
but also healing remedies (RV· 1 .43·4; 1 . 1 l4·5; 2·33·2 ; 2·33·4; 2·33· 7; 
5.42. 1 1  in particular; 6· 74.3; 7.35.6; 8.2g·5; AV.2.2 7·6; 7.42.2; 6.5 7.1-
2), plants, and the water of life (possibly [cow's] urine),8 for Rudra is 
the kind (siva) god (RV. IO.g2.g; cf. VS. 16.2; SUP.3.5-6); as such he is 
Siva. How could he heal were there no wounds? How could he be God 
if he, cause of all causes, did not inflict them? He has a thousand rem­
edies (RV. 7.46.3). Rudra is the best of healers (RV.2.33.4; VS.3.59; 
16,5, 49). He places his merciful hand-which holds the remedyjalli>a 
(RV.2.33. 7)-'-On suffering. The medicine and the arrow are held in 
the hands of the god who, when he faces life on earth, is archer and 
healer in one-Rudra, the wild god, and Siva, the kind god. But he is 
Rudra when he faces the Father. The touch of his healing hand is 
withheld from the Father. The burning arrow remains stuck in the

2g, has examined the use of the terms jali$a/.l, jali$abhe$aja/.l, jali$am, and jiili$am, and 
concluded that they refer to urine as the special remedy of Rudra. Bloomfield discusses 
the specific application of the remedy in his notes to the translation; cf. AV.6'57, tr. 
M. Bloomfield, Ig64, pp. 488-8g. A small "waterpot," however, is held in the left hand 
by images carved from the first to the third century in Mathura and Ahicchatra. They 
represent Indra (dated A.D. 82), Maitreya, a yaÍi, a Nagaraja, and Siva (see P. Pal, "A 
Kushan Indra and Some Related Sculptures," I g79, pp. 2 1 2-26, figs. I ,  2, 6, 1 8, I g, and 
16, respectively). Each of these divinities holds the same kind of small round vessel con­
taining the water of life.

wound o f  Prajapati. The initial rupture of pre-existent wholeness was 
not healed. It was avenged but not redeemed by Rudra, the archer. 
But it is Rudra, Lord of Yoga, who restores the wholeness of the ab­
solute. Rudra heals the ills of mortals with the remedies that he him­
self created in the waters into which he plunged when Brahma had 
asked him to create mortals. Rather than creating mortals, fallible by 
nature and prone to disease, he chose to do tapas and create the herbs 
and plants that would be their medicine (MBh.1O. 1 7. 10-25). The 
waters themselves have healing power; they were irradiated by his 
presence (AV.7.87. 1 ;  RV. 1O.g.6-7). The waters heal (RV. 1 .23. 19-2 1 ;  
VS.g.6; KB . 1 6.7). 
Rudra holds the arrow in one hand and a plant or a water vessel in 
the other. He holds the destructive power of the fiery arrow that 
wounds and kills, and the vitalizing fire that pulsates in water and 
plants and heals. It was Soma himself, Soma who is god, plant, and 
elixir of llfe, who revealed to a lJ.g Veda poet (RV.1O.g.6) the healing 
power of the waters and the plants. Soma, the elixir of life, the drink 
of immonality, was pressed from a plant. Soma the god arose from 
the drink and inspired the poet-seers. From far away, the plant was 
brought to man by a falcon (cf. RV.4.26.6). KJ;sanu, the archer, by an 
infinitesimal fraction of time had failed to pierce with his arrow the 
falcon who had raped the Soma and who, with the Soma plant 
clutched in his claw, precipitated himself toward the world of man. 
Kdanu could not prevent the immortal god from coming within the 
reach of those who would witness his presence on earth by their 
songs, which he inspired. Nor could he prevent the balm of Soma 
from healing mortal ills. The elixir of life inspires the seers, heals the 
sick, and assuages the ills of life. Soma and Rudra are healers. Rudra 
heals with the remedies that he has created for the ills that he has in­
flicted on man. These medicines heal the ills of mortals whose coming 
into existence Rudra failed to prevent. 
KJ;sanu, ineffectual guardian of the plant of immortality, was for­
gotten. He had no further mission. Rudra as the avenging god faces 
the results of his ineffectual effort to preserve the integrity of the pre­
existential wholeness by which life that was vulnerable and needed to 
be healed and redeemed came about on earth. 
Soma and Rudra are invoked together in one and the same hymn 
of the u Veda (RV.6.74). They are dual divinities, cooperative pow­
ers. No other god is ever associated with or takes part on equal terms 

3 8 
• T H E  A RC H E R  
in Rudra's being and domain. "Soma is the bestower of seed, Agni is 
the begetter of offspring" (TS .2.2. 10.3).9 Inasmuch as Rudra is Agni, 
they cooperate in the very field that Rudra, the Wild Hunter, meant 
to be nonexistent. Whereas life has come into existence, Rudra and 
Soma conjointly heal the ills of the body, and free it from guilt. Sick­
ness is only a consequence of sin. 
The archer Rudra plays his momentous part in the primordial 
world of man. Man did come into being, and with him the memory of 
the primordial scene. The archer Krsanu, however, was defeated. In 
the prologue to the life of man on earth, two leading parts are played 
by archers. In the flight of their arrows time plays a crucial role. Time 
did not exist before the primordial dawn. Now it intervenes between 
intent and act, between the discharge of the arrow and its hitting the 
target. But for that fraction of a second, mankind and life on earth 
would not have come about. And, mankind having come into exist­
ence, but for the fraction of another second (when the arrow of 
Krsanu just grazed the falcon, causing a feather of it to fall but not 
injuring the bird nor preventing it from bringing down the plant of 
immortality), the drink of divine inspiration would not have come to 
man. 
Soma, the elixir of immortality, is the hidden essence of TvaĠtr 
(RV . 1 . 1  1 7.22). Tvaøtr is a name of the Father. He does not create per 
generationem but per artem. He is the Father as deus faber. Soma, the 
elixir of immortality, is stored in a wondrous container, the moon (cf. 
RV. 1 .84.1 S).10 The moon vessel goes on changing its shape cyclically, 
within its own limits. The changes measure time, from the shape of 
the crescent to the full disc that dwindles, disappears, and shows again 
as crescent, repeating the same sequence of shapes time after time. 
The moon is a mystic container, a vessel from which the gods and the 
dead, the ancestors, drink Soma, the ever-refilling water of life, of im­
mortality (SB .2-4-4. 1S; ChUP.S. 1O.4). On his head Siva carries the 
crescent moon, symbol of the renewal of vegetative life, of recurrent 
time, and the abode of the dead (cf. M . 1 .66). Thus the moon is the 
lord of plants (MBh. 12.S2.33), luminous vessel of Soma and one with 
Soma, who himself from ancient times is their king. I I

are attributes of the figure of Siva. He carries them on his head and 
in his hand,. They belong to him, the gracious god who as Rudra aims 
his arrow. It Hies across space, it hits at a particular moment. That 
moment became fixed in time. It marked the beginning of Time itself, 
when the arrow hit the Father. Thus life of man began on earth, from 
the Angirases, the archetypal fire priests, down to the people born as 
links in the chain of life and death. The arrow and the healing plant 
are held in cooperative antagonism, in the hands of Rudra. In some 
of the earliest known sculptures of Siva the god holds a small vessel in 
his hand. It could well be a medicine bottleY A water pot is held by 
Siva images of the third and fourth century A.D.13 Was it meant to 
hold jalti)"a (urine), Vedic Rudra's specific medicine?14 
Rudra heals the wounds he inflicts. When he frees the body of man 
from sickness, it is guilt from which he liberates him. Sickness is seen 
as a consequence of sin. Rudra-Soma, the healers of the ills of the 
body, also free the mind from the concerns of the body (AV. 7.42. 1-2). 
Soma , the drink of immortality, transports the seer into the regions 
of the gods, where he sees them face to face. Rudra, the thousand- . 
eyed god, puts mto the right hand of the seer an herb that makes him 
see everything-the three heavens, the three earths, and all existences 
down to the somerers and the ghouls (AV.4.20. 1-g). 
In South Indian images and paintings of Siva Bhikkaγana, the right 
hand of Siva. who is represented as a penitent beggar, is extended 
neither to a sick person nor to a seer. The right hand of Siva Bhikka­
Ɛana, holding a plant in kataka gesture, is lowered toward an antelope. 
In his left hand rests a bowl, the skull of Brahma.15

4. THE HUNTER OF THE ANTELOPE AND THE HOUND OF 
HEAVEN 
a. The Hunter of the Antelope 
The Gandharva Krsanu aimed his arrow from on high so as to pre­
vent the Soma, which had been raped by the falcon, from being 
brought down to man on earth. Rudra let Ay his arrow against the 
Father, who was engaged in the procreative act. Rudra avenged the 
infringement of pre-existential wholeness, but did not prevent the 
seed of the Father from falling down to earth. Soma and semen had 
the same fate and destination. The semen of the Father was to bring 
about the life of man on earth and its continuity. Soma was to raise 
man to a level of inspiration so high that from it the fated descent of 
Soma and that of the semen of Father Heaven could be intuited. 
From the high peaks of vision would appear a panorama of many 
paths of ascent, by sacrifices to be performed and by inner realizations 
expressed in hymns and other works of art. Krsanu by his failure was 
instrumental in letting Soma and inspiration come to man; Rudra, in 
a time-caused reverse effect of his intention, brought the life itself of 
mankind to this earth, and with it he brought time. At thδ first dawn 
of the world he rose, the fiery archer. 
He assumed, tradition tells, the shape of a star, shooting dazzling 
arrows of light. Its name is Mrgavyadha, or "the Hunter of the ante­
lope." Mrgavyadha, to this day, is the name of the star Sirius. 
In transferring to the stars the primordial deed of Rudra, the Aita­
reya Brahmar.w (AB .3.33) confirmed by the visible movement and 
stations of the luminaries a mythical reality beyond time and enacted 
before the sun had ever risen in the sky. 
Rudra, the heavenly archer, is invoked in the lJ-g Veda together with 
Krsanu and Tikya, the archer (RV. 1O.64.8). Who is Tikya?

"Tiϫya is Rudra" (TS.2.2.10. 1-2). The constellation Tikya, however, 
is one of the twenty-seven mansions of the moon. Mrgavyadha is the 
star Sirius. The discrepancy between the astronomical facts and the 
irrefUlable identification of Sirius as "Hunter of the Antelope," the 
star figure of Rudra, on the one hand, and the identification of Tikya 
and Rudra on the other is puzzling, particularly in the light of the 
A.vesta. 
There is a brilliant star that is called Tistrya in the Avesta. 17 Al­
though the phonetic similarity of Tistrya and Tikya hardly implies a 
deri\'ation of the Vedic from the Avestan name, both could perhaps 
be deri"ed from the same root.18 In the Avesta, the splendid, brilliant 
Tistrya, which soars rapidly like the arrow, quick as lightning, is the 
name of the star Sirius.19 The word Tikya is formed from tv7, which 
means to shine brilliantly.20 
Vedic Mrgavyadha (Sirius) is Rudra. Avestan Tistrya is Sirius,2J but 
the Vedic asterism Tikya is almost certainly the same as the later 
PuϪya.22 and this star, in the Indian astronomical texts (such as the 
Sllryasiddhiinta [SSi]), the system therein developing its present form 
in the fifth and sixth centuries A.D.,23 is given coordinates that clearly 
identify it as E Cancri.24 Sirius, at the present state of our knowledge, 
sheds none of its light on the relation of Tistrya (Sirius), Rudra (Sir­
ius), and Tikya (Rudra). 
The myth of Rudra, the hunter of the antelope, Prajapati, the an­
telope, and Rohir:ti, his daughter, and their catasterism as Mrga­
vyadha (Sirius), as Mrga or Mrgasiras (Orion), and as Rohif.li (Al­
debaran) has been told already (Ch. I .  5).

equinox. On that day the rising of the sun was announced by a star 
that appeared at dawn, just before sunrise, and immediately became 
invisible in the rays of the rising sun. This was the "auspicious" star 
for the sacrifice to begin (TB . 1.5.2.1 and commentary), for the year to 
begin, a new year in the appointed order of its seasons and their rites. 
With the unaided eye, over the years, over millennia, the auspicious 
star of the vernal equinox heralding or supporting the rising sun was 
awaited. This star was Orion, until it was observed that another star 
was rising at the vernal equinox and "supported" the sun at the begin­
ning of the year. This star was Aldebaran. The sun was no longer ris­
ing in Orion. The beginning of the year had moved from Orion to 
Aldebaran. This momentous conclusion was based on long observa­
tion. 
The motion of the vernal equinox, of the beginning of the year, of 
all rites on which life depended and which were enacted in the sacri­
fice, had its myth in the figures of Prajapati and his daughter. The 
realization that the sun, which had always appeared rising in Orion, 
had slowly left that station to rise in another star was startling. It ap­
peared anomalous-it came as a shock. The beginning of the year had 
moved from Orion toward Aldebaran. 
The year had its mythical figure in Prajapati. "Pr.yapati is the year" 
(SB.3.2.2.4; 5.2. 1.2; 10.4.2.1 , 2). Prajapati, the year, experienced and 
expressed ritually, marked by its beginning at the vernal equinox, had 
moved toward Rohil)i, his daughter. The movement of the sun was 
expressed mythically according to its observed stations, from Orion to 
Aldebaran. The sun of the vernal equinox, the beginning of the 
year-the year being Prajapati-was seen to have left , its station 
(Orion), and the beginning of the year, Prajapati, had moved toward 
Rohil)i (Aldebaran), his daughter. The unexplained anomaly, the 
shock of this momentous observation, was contracted in the myth of 
Prajapati and his daughter, with Rudra as the avenger of this seem­
ingly unprecedented phenomenon. The priests and the gods experi­
enced by observation the startling phenomenon of the precession of 
the equinoxes.26 They did not call it by that name; they conveyed

their observations and their reaction to them through the myth of 
Rudra, the Hunter of the Antelope, aiming his arrow at the antelope 
Prajapati and his da ughter. 
The observation of the seemingly anomalous movement of the be­
ginn၁ng of the year must have been made when the sun of the vernal 
equinox moved from Orion to Aldebaran, during the fourth millen­
nium B.C. 
Vedic myths had a long past before they were collected in the IJg 
Veda. Their meaning surfaced in versions and commentaries of suc­
ceedmg ages, and their images became implanted in the creative mind 
of India. The Mahimnastava, composed about or before the ninth cen­
tury A . D . ,  mythically and mundanely addresses itself to Siva: "0 lord, 
the lord of creatures (Brahm a), who in a stag's form had been vio­
lently and lustfully pursuing his own daughter / transformed into a 
doe, while he was obsessed with desire to enjoy her, / and who had 
fled from you with bow in your hand until he reached the sky-him 
yonder, pierced by your arrow up to the feathering, / fear-stricken as 
he is, your ardor for the chase does not release even to this day."27 
(MSt.22). 
Sirius, however, is the star form not only of Rudra, the Hunter of 
the Antelope, but also of another mythical image: the hound or dog 
of heaven. ϧϨi Vasi၂tha, the son of god Varul)a, called him by his 
name: Vasto၃pati (RV.7.55. 1). 
b. The Flound of Heaven 
In the sky, Sirius, the Dog Star, glitters in his formidable shape. "He 
flies through the atmosphere, looking down upon all existences";28 
his binh is in the waters (AV.6.S0. 1 ,  3) of the nether world. He is the 
"hound of heaven." Another luminary of the night sky, the moon, is 
also called the heaveJlly dog (SB . 1 1. 1 .5. 1). This heavenly dog is one 
of the Sarameyas or the sons of Sarama (RV. IO. 1 4. 1O- 1 2 ;  AV. l S.2. 1 1-
ballle of Indra "itݪ Vrtra in its most ancient version is assigned to the era of Orion (c. 
4500 B.C., p. 2oo).Sirius is considered to have been the vernal equinoctial point prior 
to Orion (p. 203). 
21 Cf. Mahimnas/J1va (MS t) , ed. & tr. W. N. Brown, 1965, p. 1 5. The " stag" or deer 
appealed more to former translators of the word fsya than did the antelope, just as in 
another context, tre Swan instead of the wild gander was thought to be a more romantic 
way of rende ring the word haT{lSa (cf. Ch. VII.2).

1 2). Sarama, the bitch of heaven, the bitch of Indra, undertook a per­
ilous, pioneering journey to the PaQis,29 the demons in the dark neth­
er world (RV. IO. 108. 1-2). Both sun and moon are dogs of heaven, 
sons of Sarama.30 These two are watchdogs and they devour, that is 
shorten, the life of man. Sirius, the fixed star, preeminent in fame 
amongst all others, is the bright star-son of Sarama. This "silver­
golden son of Sarama" is a fierce watchdog at the gate of the nether 
world, his teeth glistening like darts (RV.7.55.2). In the mythology of 
heavenly dogs, his role is different from that of sun and moon, the 
other sons of Sarama. He is the guardian of the house of VaruQa; his 
name is Vasto1jpati (RV.7.55. I ,  2). Vastowati is Rudra. The gods had 
created Vastoġpati, the guardian of sacred ordinance (vratapa), out of 
their poem, the raudra brahman. In the sky Vastoġpati assumes the 
shape of the dog of heaven. 
The names and forms of Rudra interlace. Their total pattern is an 
inexhaustible concatenation of evocations locked together by his in­
numerable qualities and actions in the cosmos from aeon to aeon, and 
anchored in his immutable being beyond manifestation. 
Rudra in the sky is Sirius, star of stars, most exalted among them. 
In the morning dawn, before sunrise, when the red dawn-cows 
gather, Sirius is the "fire-colored boar of heaven," impetuous, fiery 
Rudra himself (RV. 1 . 1 1 4.4, 5) risen from the waters of the nether 
world. At night he is the silver-golden watchdog of the sky. Other star 
figures play their own parts in the ongoing myth of Rudra-Siva: the 
great bear (rk5a) comprising the seven sages or seers (r$ayab-), and the 
Pleiades, the Krttikas, who were to nurse Karttikeya,' sprung from 
Rudra's seed.31 However, what is seen in these last-named stars be­
longs to a later aeon and the later story of Rudra / Siva. In his most 
ancient figure he was the Dog Star, the hound of heaven, gnashing 
his formidably bright teeth. When the sun of the vernal equinox rose 
in RohiQl, he was the star Mrgavyadha, the archer, the hunter of the 
antelope shooting forth the arrows of his rays. The dog or hound of 
heaven isVasto1jpati, the Guardian of the Dwelling. The figures of the 
hunter of the antelope and of the hound were not envisioned simul-

taneously.32 Only one of them was seen or thought of at a time. They 
are figures of Rudra, who has more than one form and name. 
The invocation ofVastoġpati is repeated thrice in a hymn (RV.7.54) 
preceding one that is addressed to the god and protector of the home­
stead. There, a poet, the seer Vasiġ˷ha, begins his hymn with an in­
vocation (RV .7.55. 1 ): "V astoġpati, who chases away sickness and as­
sumes all shapes, be our gracious friend." ˸ġi Vasiġtha continues in 
the next verse (RV.7.55.2): "When you, silver-golden son of Sarama, 
gnash your teeth they shine like darts in your snapping jaws. Fall 
asleep၄" The ni then admonishes this son of Sarama to bark at a thief 
or robber, but not at him, a poet; and he repeats his spell: "Fall 
asleep" (RV.7.5S.3), and continues: "Attack the boar or the boar will 
attack you. You bark at Indra's poets. Why do you threaten us? Fall 
asleep" (RV.7.S5.4). Rudra, the hound of heaven, is also the boar of 
heaven. The ruddy boar of heaven, of glittering appearance, his hair 
coiled up on his head (kapardin), holding medicines in his hand, is 
once again invoked in a hymn to Rudra (RV. 1 .  1 14.S). Typically, 
Rudra wears his hair coiled up like a conch (kaparda). 
˸1ji Vasiġ၅ha, having taunted the hound of heaven, continues his 
spell. "The mother shall sleep, the father shall sleep, the dog shall 
sleep, the lord of the manor shall sleep. All relatives shall sleep, all 
these people everywhere shall sleep. Who sits and who walks and 
whoever sees us, their eyes we close as we close this firm dwelling" 
(RV.7.55.5-6). "The women who lie on the bench, who lie on the 
couch, who lie in bed, the scented women, we lull them all to sleep" 
(R٫l·7·55·8). 
This lullaby is said to have been sung by the seer, the ˸ġi Vasiġtha, 
son of Varul)a, the all-encompassing god and king who ordained the 
laws of the universe. Vasiġtha, in a dream, had entered at night the 
house of VarllI)a (BD.6. 1 1 - 1 2), a lofty structure of a thousand gates 
(RV·7·88.5). There he lulled to sleep the dog who attacked him, he 
lulled to sleep everyone (BD .6. 1 2- 1 3), and then closed the house. Be­
fore Vasi၆၇ha had this dream, and before he had incurred the wrath 
of Varul).a, his father, Varul).a had chosen to take Vasiġtha on his boat, 
the sun, and let him see into the marvels of the cosmos, swinging 
32 The "hound of heaven" refers to a more remote era than the "hunter of the an­
telope." B. G. Tilak, The Orion, p. 1 08, assigns it to the vernal equinox in Orion, while 
J. Deppen, RudTas Geburt. considers an even more remote sunrise (see above, n. 26).

along the crests of the waves of the celestial ocean, from the high vault 
of heaven into the abyss where the sun is imprisoned in darkness 
(RV.7.88.2-3).33 However, the seer Vasi$tha once, on his own-so he 
dreamed-stealthily went into the house of VaruQa (BD.6. 1 1-12). It 
was not in the hope of seeing there things even more wondrous than 
those VaruQa had already shown him. VaruQa had opened Vasi$tha's 
vision and let him see deep into the miracles of creation. He con­
ferred on Vasi$tha the power to convey his vision in the words of his 
songs. VaruQa had made VasiHha a seer and poet (RV.7.88.4). But 
Vasi$tha entered on his own, at night-so he dreamed-the house of 
god VaruQa to close the eyes of everyone in the dwelling and to close 
the house itself. He lulled everyone to sleep, so that behind the closed 
lids of dream and sleep this world would fade away. Vasi$tha, the poet 
and seer, finally closed the house itself, the mansion of VaruQa, the 
universe. He closed and left the house of VaruQa behind him. 
While the "thousand-horned bull" (RV.7.55.7) was rising from the 
ocean and everyone fell asleep,34 Vasi$tha left the mansion ofVaruQa, 
the cosmos, and entered the radiant light beyond and above the vault 
of heaven. By himself he found his way as poet and seer into tran­
scendency out of the house of VaruQa, out of the spectacle of the cos­
mos whose marvels Varul)a had shown (0 him during their voyage in 
the sun boat along the vault of the sun's course up to the zenith and 
down to the nadir. 
For this daring deed Vasi$tha invoked Vasto$pati to be his "very 
dear friend." Vasto$pati "chases away sickness and assumes all 
shapes" (RV.7.55. 1), for Vasto$pati indeed is Rudra, and Rudra, the 
healer, carries remedies in his healing hand for aU ills (RV. 1 . 1 14.5; 
RV.2·33·2, 4, 7)· Vasiøtha invoked the god who knows how to heal. He 
felt that VaruQa would be vengeful, would punish Vasi$tha with sick­
ness for his deviousness, as indeed he did: he smote Vasi$tha with 
dropsy (RV.7.89.2-4; 7.86.4).35 
33 A. Bergaigne, La Religion vedique , 1 :5 1-52, has identified the sea inRV.7.88.4 as the 
"celestial sea" that is crossed by Vasigha. 
34 f1.g Veda Sa1'!!hita (RV) , tr. K. F. Geldner, 195 1 , 2:230, considers the "thousand­
horned bull" to be the moon. In RV.5.1 .8, the "thousand-horned bull" is Agni. The 
image appears to be more applicable to the sun than to the moon. (Cf. SayaI:la on 
RV.7.55.7). If RV.7.55 is taken to be a lullaby, sung in the diurnal night, Geldner's 
interpretation would be suitable, but neither the image of the thousand-horned bull 
nor the awakening of the rbhus supports Geldner's view.

Bhrgu, another son of VaruQa, thinking himself superior in knowl­
edge to his father, was sent by him in the four directions, one after 
the other. There he saw scenes of dismemberment and cannibalism, 
hellish retributions for injuries done in this world (SB . 1 1 .6. 1 . 1-7). 
VaruQa had a different punishment for each of his sons. 
VasiĶ̻ha invoked the god who has the remedies that heal. Address­
ing himself to VastoŬpati Rudra, the healer, VasiŬtha invoked the god 
who assumes all shapes. The shape in which he was seen by VasiŬtha 
was that of the watchdog of his father's house. The dog had formi­
dable teeth. They shot darts of light. The dog was the first whom Va­
siĶǱha would lull to sleep, for this watchdog, the guardian of VaruQa's 
house, attacked the intruder VasiŬtha, the seer and poet. Indignant, 
VasiŬŽha taunted the dog: he should have attacked a thief or burglar, 
not a poet; and, better still, he should have attacked the boar, or the 
boar would attack him. 
But would that silver-golden hound of heaven, gnashing his teeth, 
attack the fire-colored boar of heaven?36 In fact, they are one and the 
same star, and their animal shapes are somehow interchangeable. 
The fiery boar of heaven (RV. 1 .  1 1 4.5)-an image of Rudra in his 
wrath-appears on the sky for but a short while when the star rises 
before the sun; the star, however, as his alter ego, is the dog of heaven 
when at the beginning of the night it emerges from the dark waters 
of the nether world to guard the house of VaruQa. In his exhortation 
of the watchdog, the poet, in rhetorical whimsy, eggs the dog on 
against himself, but the dog has other things to do. He watches over 
this mansion, the cosmos. 
In this capacity, at the proper moment he has to awaken the rbhus 
from sleep (RV. 1.161.13). These are divine artificers of the vehicle.s 
36 Cf. RV.1O.86+ the dog's eagerness for the boar. The star Sirius is the dog, the 
Guardian of the. House (Vasto˘pati). In the annual course of the sun, the dog guards 
the two gates of the house. The one gate marks the sun's entrance from the nether 
world, the region of Yama (death), the world of the Fathers, into the Devayana, the 
path that the gods take (B. G. Tilak, The Orion, p. 26, 108). Sirius rose before the sun at 
the vernal equinox of a remote age and disappeared shortly, as the sun rose in the sky. 
It is the same star, Sirius, the Dog Star of the night and the Boar (Star) who rises before 
Sunrise. At the rising of Sirius, darkness prevailed and the teeth of the dog glittered. 
Then, in the dawn,just before sunrise, the star was the ruddy boar who pushed up the 
sun from the waters of darkness-and disappeared into the sun's light. Sirius, the dog 
who awakened the rbhus at the beginning of the year, is the same star in his capacity as 
dog, who as a ruddy boar pushed the sun up on the sky in the morning of the spring 
equinox of a remote aeon.

and receptacles of time (RV.1.111.1; 4.34.g). The rhhus had been 
men, and by their creative work they were made immortal (RV. 
1.110.3-4). Having completed their work during the year, they rest 
for twelve days, slumbering in the house of Savitr, the Impeller of the 
sun, before starting another year's work at the beginning of the year 
(RVA.33.7). The dog awakens them. 
The dog of heaven watches over all existences in this mansion, the 
world, where everything has its place and everything its time. It is he 
who makes the rbhus wake from their sleep of twelve days at the end 
of the year, so that they begin shaping their wondrous works afresh 
in the new year. 
Sirius, the hound-and boar--of heaven, is the same star as Mrga­
vyadha, Rudra, the archer. His arrows are star rays, and so are the 
gleaming teeth of his animal shape. Frighteningly fierce, they com­
mand order. Fierceness informs the power of the brilliant star, the 
watchful hound of heaven, who watches over the mansion of Varur:ia 
so that everything is kept in order, the order of time in the world, our 
dwelling. From the tight grip of this order of the world under the 
stars, the seer poet dreams that he knows how to escape. He lulls to 
sleep the barking dog, the entire family of man, all their obligations, 
all the fragrant women, all the seductions, so that he may be free. 
As Vastokpati, the guardian of this house-the world-has been 
fashioned by the gods-the celestial intelligence--out of their poem, 
so it is within the power of the poet-seer to lull to sleep this creation, 
close and leave the house for the limitless realm beyond this world. 
Rudra, the Wild Archer, by his first shot not only failed to prevent 
the coming into existence of human beings; he was instrumental in 
bringing the fire seed of life to earth. As Sarva, the archer, he makes 
life on earth precarious, yet Rudra the healer has all the remedies to 
cure the ills of life. Above this earthly condition flies the hound of 
heaven. Gnashing his teeth, he is the guardian of the house, the fiery 
star Sirius shooting his rays. He is Vastokpati, the glittering guardian 
of Varur:ia's house. 
Sirius, the hound of heaven, the star form of Rudra, the Wild God, 
is mythically the most eminent of all stars.37 Before the sun the fire­
colored boar of heaven arises from the dark waters of the nether 
world. When the sun has set, the hound of heaven shoots silver-

golden darts. Barking, he bares his teeth as he keeps watch over those 
who live under the starry dome of the world-mansion. 
In his dream, Vasiǲtha, the poet of transcendent peace, leaves the 
house of Varm:ta. The house sleeps and he has locked its door. But in 
this universe of revolving time he is to suffer for his transgression. 
"ylay Vastoǲpati-Rudra who chases away sickness be Vasiǲtha's gra­
cious friend!" (RV·7·55· 1). 
Sirius, having risen like an arrow quick as lightning from the dark 
waters of the nether world,38 in his ascent before the sunrise, has been 
figured as the fire-colored boar of heaven (RV. 1 . 1 14.5). The same star 
guards the night when the sun descends toward the dark midnight, 
whence it will rise again in the east. 
The arrows of Rudra shoot across existence. His first target was 
Prajapati. The story is recorded by the stars in the sky. Rudra, having 
aimed at Prajapati, the Lord of Generation (the Father), pierced him. 
Him they call the antelope. The piercer of the antelope is called by 
that name. The female antelope is Rohil)l39 (AB .3.33). Pr̼apati, who 
in the shape of the antelope cohabited with his daughter, when 
pierced by the arrow of Rudra flew up to the sky, where he has his 
station as the constellation Mrga, "the antelope," or Orion. The 
hunter of the antelope is the star Mrgavyadha or Sirius. The female 
antelope is the star Rohil)l (Aldebaran) (AB .3.33). Mrgavyadha, the 
archer, the sparkling star, is Rudra the Archer. His primordial deed 
is seen written in the stars. The victimized Prajapati is the sacrificial

Sarva, the archer, threaten or spare man and beast; they have power 
over life and death. Mrgavyadha-the star Sirius-rises on the vault 
of heaven at the appointed time in this ordered universe. 
Sirius the dog star is twice and even thrice the star shape of Rudra. 
He is the star shape of Vastopati, the guardian of the House of Var­
UIJ.a; as such he is the hound of heaven; he is also the boar of heaven. 
He is Rudra, the Archer, the hunter of the antelope (Mrgavyadha). 
To both these roles of his in the raudra brahman does Rudra send his 
light from Sirius. This mighty star is the sidereal equivalent of the JJ.g 
Veda word of power, the raudra brahman. It is the star symbol of the 
Wild Hunter and of the guardian of order, the dog. The star does not 
bear the name Vastopati; it is in the myth of Vasiha that he is so 
identified. 
The Wild Archer, the hunter of the antelope, is Rudra; Vastopati 
is Rudra; each dazzlingly corroborates the coincidence of their sepa­
rate entities in Rudra. 

III 
VASTOSPATI, THE LORD OF 
THE DWELLING 
Vastopati is the guardian of the House of Varm:ia, the universe, its 
dome the starry sky. The brilliant hound of heaven, whose other 
name is Mi;gavyadha, "the hunter of the antelope," watches over 
safety and order in this mansion with its thousand gates that lead in 
and out of the cosmos. There should be no trespass and no escape. 
He is on perennial duty; rising before the sun, he heralds the begin­
ning of the year in a most distant world age of Rudra's myth. 
At a new beginning of the world, the gods made Vastopati. The 
substance they made him from was a brahman, a "word of power," a 
mantric poem, uttered by them when the seed of the Creator fell on 
the earth: the rawlra brahman. They gave the god his name, making 
him the Guardian of the House, and of sacred order (vratapa). The 
occasion was the horror of the primordial dawn. The gods' poem 
could neither undo the violence of that morning, nor mitigate it, but 
served as a counterweight to balance the disruption of wholeness and 
of the avenging violence in its wake. They created Vastopati, the 
guardian of cosmic order, a multiform counterpart of Pasupati. Vas­
topati is Pasupati's alter ego; Rudra comprises both and is each. 
The gods created abrahman and made Vastopati as Prajapati's seed 
was falling on the earth (RV.10.6i.7). Prajapati made the Wild 
Hunter desist from his murderous intention, and made him Lord of 
Animals, Pafopati (MS+2.12); or the horrified gods made "that god" 
out of their most fearful shapes in order to punish Prajapati. "That 
god" thereupon demanded to be given the lordship over animals 
(AB .3.33).

Rudra was born neither as VastoŬpati nor as Pasupati. These dis­
tinctions were conferred on the Wild Hunter who was before he 
aimed at the Father. As Agni, he had prepared the seed for the 
Father (RV. 1 .7 1 .5), and that fell on the earth. Thus the seed was shed 
from which Rudra was to be born, in a world over which the sun as 
yet had not risen. The primordial scene was enacted before the first 
sunrise. It is a prelude to the birth of Rudra. 
1 .  THE REMAINDER AT THE SITE OF THE LAKE OF SPERM 
However the gods vary in their level of creative intuition, they depend 
on their spokesmen. What the IJg Veda seer of the raudra brahman be­
held is seen in another light by the gods, according to the account in 
the Aitareya Brahma'(W (AB .3.33-34). There they saw the mating of 
Prajapati, the antelope, with his daughter. That these beautiful ani­
mals should cohabit and that they were father and daughter would 
not have surprised anyone, but the gods saw more; they perceived 
this first sexual congress for what it signified, knowing that eternity 
would never be the same again. It would be set off by beings brought 
to live and to die. In their horror and fear, the gods assembled the 
most dread shapes: the forms of their own fright. They asked this aw­
ful conglomerate to pierce Prajapati, the antelope. The dread con­
glomerate demanded a boon, the overlordship over animals. They 
granted it to him, and his name became Pasupati, Lord of Animals. 
In the account of the MaitrayaŅi Sarrthita (MS .4.2. 1 2), however, the 
Lord of Animals was not invested with his power by the gods. There 
it was Prajapati himself who gave this title to the Wild Hunter, not for 
piercing him, but rather to make him desist. 
The traditions, unanimous in their horror at the primordial scene, 
differently distribute the roles played by its participants. When the 
seed of the Father fell on the earth, the gods of the IJg Veda created a 
brahman and shaped VastoŬpati, whereas the gods of the Aitareya Brah­
ma'(W produced most terrifying shapes of their own, and these awful 
shapes coalesced into Pasupati. 
As soon as they had granted the frightful being the overlordship 
over animals, it pierced Prajapati, the antelope, who flew upward and 
became the star called Mrga, the "antelope." The pursuer became the 
star Mrgavyadha. The tripartite arrow and the daughter became con­
stellations. She became the star Rohi£.ll. This happened at that pri-

R E M A I N DE R  AT T H E  L A K E  O F  S P E R M · 5 3  
mordial moment as the seed emitted by Pr;;yapati rained down on 
earth and became a lake. The gods were concerned that the seed 
should not be wasted or spoil, for they knew that somehow in the fu­
ture mankind would come about from that seed. They knew intui­
tively that out of their wish that the seed should not spoil (mad:l1.$a), 
man (manu) would eventually come into existence (miinU$a). Their 
knowledge was worded cryptically, for the gods love the mysterious 
(AB .3.33)· To preserve the seed so that mankind should come to exist, 
they surrounded with· fire the lake of heavenly seed (AB .3.34). The 
flames of Agni rose through the seed of heaven (RV.5. 1 7.3); sparks 
blazed from it. The first spark became the sun and the second became 
Bhrgu (AB .3.34), which "is the name given to the inner fire of the sub­
tle centers of the body, which burns to ashes the water or semen."! 
The following sparks became the Adityas, the twelve sovereign gods 
who rule the universe. The charred residue became dark animals; the 
earth baked by the fire turned into red animals. The ashes that were 
left were scattered in all directions in the shape of bovine and ante­
lope-like animals, camel, ass, and ruddy beasts (AB .3.34). Indeed, 
Prajapati made all the animals out of that seed (TmB .8.2. 1O).Just then 
"that god" appeared and claimed the animals as belonging to him 
(AB .3.34; d. RV. IO.go.8). Although his name is not to be uttered, so 
as to lessen the terror that would arise from pronouncing that name 
(AB .3.34), it was the Lord of Animals who showed himself to the ani­
mals in the shape of terror that the gods had given him together with 
the name of Pasupati, Lord of Animals (AB .3.33). He was "that god." 
"That god" said to the gods, "mine is this; mine is what is left on the 
site (viistu)." "That god," however, was made to resign his claim by the 
recitation of a mantra to him (AB .3.34). The mantra (RV.2.33.1 ), which 
invokes Rudra, is to be altered, according to the Aitareya Briihma'(UJ, in 
such a way as to omit the name Rudra. In this way, as in the raudra 
brahman , the terror that would have arisen from the pronunciation of 
the actual word Rudra could be diminished (AB .3.34). The mantra 
(RV.2·33·1) was a humble prayer to Rudra for life not to be cut off 
from the light of the sun, and for progeny. 
The gods themselves in cosmic fright make mankind their concern. 
":'hen he comes into existence, man will be vulnerable from the begin­
nmg because of the gruesome power of the terrifying shape that the 
gods had created.

5 4 · LORD O F  T H E  D W E L L I N G  
Hearing the mantra, Rudra desisted from his claim to the remain­
der on the site where the seed of the Lord of Generation had fallen, 
where he had spent himself into creation-himself the victim of pas­
sion, the sacrificial animal, the sacrifice. "Prajapati is the sacrifice" 
(SB . 1 .7.4.4; cf. TS .2.6.8.3-4)' "That god" had not claimed more than 
what, indeed, belonged to him. What remained on the site were the 
ashes and burnt residue of Prajapati's seed. Rudra-Agni had pre­
pared the seed for the Father. Rudra by his shot had caused it to fall 
down on earth. It was his prey. Rudra had aimed his arrow at the 
Father to prevent the emission of the seed. Frightened by the hunter, 
the Father let fall some seed on the earth. Rudra-Agni prevailed over 
Rudra the avenger. Rudra became Lord of Animals at his own re­
quest, granted to him by the procreator god, himself in animal shape, 
a victim of passion. The lordship over the animals was granted also to 
Rudra by the gods, the celestial intelligence. By their creative power 
they formed VastoĶpati when the seed of the Father had fallen on 
earth. 
The several versions of the myth carry forward the power imma­
nent in the IJg Veda vision. They give shape to the consciousness of 
the loss of pre-existential wholeness in the figure of Rudra, the Wild 
God. He is the Fire, the Hunter, and Lord of Animals, he is "that god" 
who claims as his own all that was left on earth, all that was left after 
the conflagration on the site (vastu) on which the seed had fallen. As 
Agni, Fire, he had prepared the seed, and as Fire he set the lake of 
sperm aflame. From it sparks had risen. Its residue stayed on earth, 
in a disturbed cosmic dawn at the beginning of things, the site where 
man would have his being. Henceforward Rudra desisted from his 
claim. The gods had feared that "that god" of their own creation 
would destroy what was left on earth of the seed of Prajapati. Though 
Rudra had claimed it, he spared it. Kind (siva) and tranquil (santa), he 
showed his grace. 
2. THE RESIDUE AT THE SITE OF THE SACRIFICE 
a. The First Gift 
On another occasion Rudra repeated his claim to what had remained 
at the site (AB .5. 14; cf. however also TS .3. 1 .9-4-6; cf. MS . 1 .5.8). But 
what remained on the site this time was not the residue of the fire of 
the lake of semen that had become animals, wild and tame. In this 

R E S I D U E  O F  SAC R I F I C E · 5 5  
instance he claimed the thousand pieces of cattle of the Angirases, the 
fire priests. Once again, the site was the site of a sacrifice, but not the 
primordial sacrifice in which the Lord of Generation offered his sub­
stance consumed in the fire for the sake of creation of mankind on 
earth. Rather, this site was that of a sacrifice held by the Angirases, 
the primordial fire priests. They were unsuccessful; they could not 
find the way to heaven, which the sacrifice should have opened to 
them. On the sixth day of their futile efforts, Nabhanedi$Ǳha, a stu­
dent, and the youngest son of Manu (cf. RV. IO.62.1),2 offered his 
help at the suggestion of his father.3 
Manu had divided his property among his sons, but nothing was 
left for his youngest son. He advised his son to proceed to the sacrifice 
of the Angirases. He should communicate to them a certain sacred 
formula, a spell, a brahman (TS .3. 1 .9.4-5).4 With its help the Angirases 
would go to heaven, and in return for having shown them the way 
they would give to N abhanediŬǱha the thousand pieces of cattle that 
were left from the sacrifice. The Angirases, then, by means of the 
brahman, went to heaven, leaving their cattle to Nabhanedi$Ǳha 
(AB .5 . 1 4) . 
He was just collecting the cattle when a large man from the north, 
clothed in black, stopped him, saying, "this is mine; mine is what is left 
at the site." The Angirases did not have the power to dispose of the 
cattle. Nabhanedi$Ǳha acknowledged the man's claim, but told him 
how he had come to own the cattle. NabhanediŬǱha questioned his 
father on the stranger's claim, and was told by him that the claim was 
true. Nabhanedi$tha returned and told the stranger. On ascertaining 
that N abhanediŬǱha had spoken the truth, the stranger relinquished 
his claim and gave the cattle to NabhanediŬtha for having spoken the 
truth (AB .5. 14). 
Manu, "Man" is the first ancestor of mankind, and ruler .of the 
earth. He gave his youngest son a very special patrimony. He made

him earn it by communicating his knowledge in the form o f  certain 
mantras, and receiving in return a thousand pieces of cattle from the 
fire priests, whom he had enabled to go to heaven. But Nabhane­
diĶlha's right to the cattle was disputed by an ominous-looking 
stranger who claimed them as his own, for they had been left on the 
site, and what is left on the site belonged to him. NabhanediĶlha, how­
ever, was allowed by the stranger to retain the cattle because he spoke 
the truth. He acknowledged the claim of the man dressed in black. 
Twice did NabhanediĶlha speak truth; he had not lied, but the other 
truth is of a different nature. He had acknowledged the claim of 
Rudra, for it had been revealed to him, implied as it was in the raudra 
brahman, in the mantras of the hymn that he had imparted to the An­
girases. Without it the Angirases could not have gone to heaven. 
The dark-clad stranger identified himself by defining his posses­
sions. They comprise "what remains on the site of the sacrifice." By 
the same proclamation that what remained on the site of the sacrifice 
belonged to him, he had introduced himself to the animals, the trans­
formed residue of the burnt-up lake of Prajapati's semen. Rudra had 
resigned his claim to the animals as an act of grace. He resigned his 
claim to NabhanediĶlha in recognition of the truth that Nabhane­
diĶlha had spoken. Rudra verified the truth that the cattle-which are 
his who is their lord-were actually given to the youngest son of 
Manu. He also knew that NabhanediĶlha had given the true brahman 
to the fire priests, or else they could not have gone to heaven. Rudra 
moreover recognized himself in that brahman ; for the potent brahman 
that N abhanediĶlha had given to the fire priests was the raudra brah­
man itself. 
As Pasupati, the horrendous Lord of Animals, Rudra showed them 
his grace. In his guise as a man in dark attire from the north, he rec­
ognized himself in the raudra brahman. He made doubly sure that Na­
bhanediHha was a speaker of truth, for NabhanediĶlha helped the 
fire priests to ascend to heaven by means of the same raudra brahman 
in which the Wild God revealed himself to NabhanediĶlha, his singer 
and seer. 
Two hymns of the Ϭg Veda (RV. 1O.6 1 ,  '62), one of which is the rau­
dra brahman, are traditionally assigned to NabhanediĶlha. The word 
niibhiined̃tha means "nearest relative."5 The raudra brahman is known 
• M. Mayrhofer, Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary, s.u. ruibJuined͉,halJ.

as the hymn of NabhanediĶǱha, or the song of the seed (AB .6.27; cf. 
SP.3.29·I-S9; BhP·9-4- 1 - 1 2). 
Nabhanedi$tha received the gift of a thousand cows. It was, at the 
same time, the gift of Manu, the gift of the Angirases, and the gift of 
Rudra himself to the singer. It was the gift by the god himself to the 
seer who had seen him. This gift (daÑi'(/,ii) was the first ever given to 
an inspired seer 
... It was the prototype for every daÑi'(/,ii or present 
given to a priest at the completion of a sacrifice. It could have been 
considered a heavy burden on the recipient, an obligation (cf. 
AB·4·2S)· 
In his image called Dak;iQ.amurti, Indian art has celebrated over 
the millennia Rudra-Siva as the giver of the first gift to his poet.6 
In South India the image of Siva Dak;iQ.amurti is enshrined in a 
niche on the south (daÑi'(/,a) wall of the main sanctuary of a temple, 
whether Saiva or Vai;Q.ava. "Because Siva was seated facing south 
when he taught the rishis yoga and jiiiina he came to be known as Dak­
;iQ.amurti."1 This is the accepted view based on the meaning of the 
word dak$i'(ti(a), which signifies "gift" as well as "south." 
The South is the region of death. Siva as DakĶiQ.amiirti is the master 
of gnosis, yoga, music, and other sciences.s He teaches the nis the 
means of overcoming death, the mortal condition. To the devotee fac­
ing Dak<iQ.amiirti, the image is in the north, where Siva resides on a 
mountain, under a banyan or fig tree, the tree of knowledge. In its 
shade, the rĶis have gathered to whom Siva DakĶiQ.amiirti imparts or 
gives the knowledge of transcendency asJnana DakĶiQ.amiirti, of yoga 
as Yoga Dak;iQ.amiirti, or of music and the arts as VIQ.adhara Dak­
;iQ.amiirti, and as the source and expounder of all the sciences as 
Vyakhyana DakǲiQamiirti.9 In his images as DakĶiQ.amurti, Siva im­
parts to the sages the gnosis that was his gift to N abhanediĶ̻ha.

b. Abasement and Recognition of Rudra 
Although Rudra demands "what has been left on the site" as his 
own, he does not take the animals. He spared the animals on the day 
of their creation, and he turns over his claim as a gift to Nabhane­
diĶtha. However, another account of the outcome of the meeting of 
Rudra and NabhanediĶtha is given in the Taittiriya SaTflhita 
(TS. 3. 1 .9.4-6). Here Rudra is not the munificent giver of all that has 
remained on the site (viistu). On the contrary, he becomes the recipi­
ent of the remnant (vastu) of the milk and barley offered at the sacri­
fice of the Angirases, in exchange for relinquishing his claim to the 
cattle left on the site. Rudra, having challenged the right of the An­
girases to leave their cattle to NabhanediĶtha, made a counterpro­
posal that he would desist claiming the cattle if he were to receive as 
libation what was left over from the sacrifice (TS .3. 1 .9.4-6). The ex­
change was all important to Rudra, for he had been excluded from 
the sacrifice after his arrow had pierced Prajapati. 
Rudra had resigned his claim to the animals, the converted ashes 
left after the conflagration of Prajapati's seed. He would spare them. 
Rudra, an aggregate of the dread of the gods at the primordial 
drama, assured those animals of the safety of their lives. Pasupati, 
Lord of Animals, in his grace would not harm those he rules, and 
whose existence he as Agni initially had caused. The land around the 
burnt-out lake of Prajapati's semen was the first site (viistu) where 
Rudra Pasupati, the Fierce Hunter, unconditionally resigned his 
claim to what was left on the site. 
On the second occasion, the site was the place of a sacrifice of the 
Angirases, the fire-youths. They had been enabled to go to heaven on 
the strength of the raudra brahman that N abhanediĶtha had revealed 
to them. Their sacrificial cattle were the reward they left for Nabha­
nediĶtha on the site. Rudra appeared in the guise of an uncanny 
stranger, claiming once again as his own what had been left on the 
site. He gave up this claim in recognition of the words spoken by Na­
bhanediĶtha, who knew Rudra when Rudra had revealed himself to 
NabhanediĶtha in his brahman. Rudra gave the young priest the gift 
of a thousand-of all-the cattle that the fire priests had left for him 
on the site. 
The gift of life to the animals at the site of the burnt-up lake, the 
gift of mutual recognition of the god and his seer-the first dak#ri, 

R E S I D U E  O F  SACRI F I C E · 5 9 
witness the grace of Rudra, his Siva nature within the dread shape of 
Pasupati and within the dark aspect of the man from the north 
(AB .5· 1 4)· However, the encounter of the god and the young seer and 
priest is told with a different ending in another version (TS .3. 1 .9.4-6). 
As before, Nabhanediǲtha is left the cattle, but not unconditionally. In 
return, Rudra demands and receives remnants of the oblation for 
which he had asked (TS .3. 1 .9.6). Rudra, who by a covenant with 
Prajapati in the first dawn of creation had become the Lord of Ani­
mals, and who, although he had the power over their lives, spared this 
remnant of the burnt-out lake of Prajapati's seed, is now satisfied with 
the remnants of the libation offered to him by the seer Nabhanediǲtha 
in exchange for relinquishing his claim to the cattle. Nabhanedi!!tha 
knows the secret of Rudra, the awesome archer whose target was the 
Father. Rudra let Nabhanedi!!tha take his cattle in even exchange for 
the remnant of the sacrifice. The remnant of the sacrifice had a spe­
cial significance for Rudra. His arrow sent against Prajapati remained 
in Prajapati's wound. It was the arrow shot by Rudra, who was made 
Pasupati in the primordial scene. 
The gods held in thrall by the primordial scene compensated for its 
horror by creating a lYrahman as the seed of the Father was falling, and 
out of it they gave shape to Vastoǲpati. According to another tradi­
tion, they shaped their own combined horror into a monstrously 
frightening aggregate, namely, Pasupati. Hence the gods never felt at 
ease with Pasupati-Rudra. "When the anger of the gods subsided, 
they cured Prajapati and cut out that dart of this (Rudra); for Praja­
pati, doubtless, is this sacrifice" (SB . 1 .7-4-4; cf. TS.2.6.8.3-4).lO That 
small bit of Prajapati's flesh that had primordially been pierced by 
Rudra's arrow, when cut out, proved to be charged with devastating 
power. When offered as a small portion of the sacrifice to the gods, it 
blinded one god, knocked out the teeth of another (SB . 1.7.4.5-7), and 
similarly maimed and injured the other gods to whom it was offered 
(KB .6. 13). The effect of this morsel was to become paradigmatic for 
the havoc created at another sacrifice in another aeon (Ch. X.A.2). 
The gods, as the Briihmarws tell, obviously dreaded and loathed 
Rudra. They did not want to share their privilege with the Wild God; 
they excluded him from the sacrifice. He was not entitled to it. Had 
he not aimed his arrow at Prajapati, the Sacrifice, the Lord of Gener­
ation?

NabhanediŬtha, the priest who knew the secret of Rudra and had 
voiced it as the raudra brahman, gave Rudra the remainder of the li­
bation in return for the gift of Rudra's cattle. However, the gods did 
not want Rudra to have any part in the sacrifice. "Now by means of 
the sacrifice the gods ascended to heaven. But the god who rules over 
the cattle was left behind here: hence they call him Vastavya, for he 
was then left behind on the (sacrificial) site (viistu)" (SB . 1 .7.3. 1).11 
The gods abhorred Rudra, the Wild God. He had let fly the arrow 
against the Father; his arrows threatened man and beast (RV. 1 . 1 1 4.7, 
8, 10); the power over life and death was in his hands. The Rudra man­
tra (RV.7.5g. 1 2) invokes Rudra Tryambaka that he may not cut off 
the life of man like a gourd from its stalk, that he may liberate from 
death and give a full life span, the nearest thing for mortal bodies to 
immortality. Rudra the liberator is called the "king of the sacrifice" 
(RV.4.3. 1). But the gods would not admit him to the sacrifice. They 
feared him (SB .g. l .  1 . 1 ). They appeased him with the awesome Sata­
rudriya offering of "a hundred oblations," and with the exultancy of 
the words of the accompanying hymn to Rudra hundredfold 
(TS.4.5. 1-1 1 ;  VS . 16. 1 -66). They made him immortal (SB.g. 1 .  1 .  1-2)­
who himself held in his hands the power over life and death. They 
offered the Satarudriya on completion of the altar for the Soma sac­
rifice-and they beheld Rudra: he stood flaming on the altar 
(SB .g. l . l . l ). They were afraid lest he hurt them with his arrows ready 
in the hundred quivers thal he carried, longing for his oblations, 
longing for food. They appeased him-"the lord of the Soma plant" 
(SB .g. 1 . 1 .24). By the hymns and oblations of the Satarudriya sacrifice, 
preparatory to the Soma sacrifice, the gods made Rudra cast off his 
pain, his evil (SB .g. 1 .2. 1O, 1 2, 13, 20). 
Besides, they let him have other sacrifices entirely to himself, far 
from the site of the Soma sacrifice, in the forest or on haunted cross­
roads. On a road or at a crossroads, rice cakes would be sacrificed to 
him (SB.2.6.2.7) and, later, additional rice cakes would be hung in a 
basket from a tree (SB .2.6.2. 1 7). He is invoked as Tryambaka 
(SB.2.6.2. 1 1- 1 2), for his three mothers are heaven, earth, and air,t2 
and his mantra, the Mahiimrtyuitjaya mantra, is that of the Great Liber­
ator, the conquerer of death (RV.7.59. 1 2 ; MS . 1 . lO-4). Still, he is asked

to take; with him the offered rice cakes and go away to the north, 
where he is at home, beyond Mount Mujavat (SB .2.6.2 . 1 7; cf. 
TS . 1 .8.6). 
He also accepts libations unfit for other gods (KSS .25.2 .2-4), and 
has to be content with the leavings of the sacrifice (TS .3. 1 .9.6). From 
the beginning he had chosen a lowly guise, that of a hunter. Those in 
the wilderness of life, the lowly and rejected, can address themselves 
to him. They know him, for he lives in them (TS -4-5.3, 4). He will ac­
cept their offerings, and fulfill the needs of those who know him. 
He is clad in the skins of animals of the hunt, the tiger and black 
antelope (TS. 1 .8.6; MBh.13. 15. 1 1 ;  1 3. 1 4. 1 52). One can smell them, 
and invoke Rudra in his mantra as the "scented one" (RV. 7 .59.1 2 ;  
TS . 1 .8.6.2). The offerings made to him range from refuse 
(TS.3. I .9.6) to rice cakes (SB.2.6.2.8), and from cattle (SSS.4. 1 7. 1-3) 
to human lives (TS.2.2.2.3-5), even royal blood. The Mahiibhiirata tells 
of King janisandha, who had planned to offer as a sacrifice to Rudra 
the princes he had defeated and captured in battle (MBh.2.20.8-1O). 
And once Rudra offered himself in a sacrifice, a universal sacrifice 
(sarva-medha) of his own. He poured into it all creatures, and then he 
offered himself (MBh. 1 2.8.36). 
Rudra, "king of the sacrifice," accepts the humble offering of rice 
cakes as in the Tryambaka sacrifice, or even the foam of cooked rice 
(GGS. 1 -4-3 1), and he is offered human, even royal sacrificial victims. 
He accepts all these sacrifices, and offers himself together with eveN-) 
thing else as a sacrifice. 
In the sequel to the primordial scene, the residue of the conflagra­
tion on the site of the lake of semen, namely, the burnt cinder, the 
earth and ashes that had turned into animals, was claimed as his share 
by Rudra-Pasupati (AB .3.34). Then, on the sacrificial site of the An­
girases, Rudra again put forth his claim to what was left on the sacri­
ficial site (vastu) (AB .5. 14). At yet another sacrifice, he himself was left 
on the sacrificial site (viistu). Rudra, excluded from the sacrifice and 
lେft on the site, went after the gods, threatening them with his arrow 
(SB . 1 .7.3.3). So that he would not hurt them, the gods conceded to 
him a share in the sacrifice (SB . I .7.3.4). But already they had all re­
ceived their offerings. Nothing but the leftover remnants were now 
there to be made into the offering for Rudra. "This then is the reason 
why he (Rudra) is called Vastavya, for a remainder (vastu) is that part 

62 
• L O R D  O F  T H E  DWE L L I N G  
of the sacrifice which (is left) after the oblations have been made" 
(SB . 1 .7.3.7)Y 
The relation of Pasupati-Rudra and the viistu is very close. The 
viistu itself, the sacred site on which the sacrificial animals had been 
left, and whatever had been left behind or left over (viistu) on the site 
(viistu), are both Rudra's. Indeed, he himself had been left behind on 
the site. 
His position is dismal. He is at the bottom and cannot rise. There is 
something ominous about him; he shows it in the way he is dressed in 
black, a color most unbecoming for the occasion when he confronts 
Nabhanediဿ˷ha at the place of the sacrifice. He now demeans himself 
when he thinks it necessary to resort to threats, intending to throw his 
arrow at the gods unless they let him rise with them. This is indeed 
Rudra, "king of the sacrifice" (RV-4-3. 1 ;  TS . 1 .3.14. 1 ). 
The gods had given him a shape of dread, an aggregate of their 
own horror and fear. Later, Rudra, wearing a dark garment, ap­
peared in the shape of man; he looked ominous. He now shows him­
self in an abject state, humiliated by the gods. Or is it in self-humilia­
tion that he plays this role? It was only in his state of power that he 
appeared as a hunter. 
Rudra's acceptance of humiliation was an act of asceticism, a ges­
ture of detachment of the Great Yogi. Centuries later his followers, 
known as Pasupatas, strove for the contempt of society as the path to 
happiness and moϩa.14 They too thought that abusive treatment 
should be regarded as a coronation (PS.3.5 and commentary).15 The 
asceticism of humiliation, and of self·humiliation in particular, is an 
exercise of the power of Rudra. The Great Yogi displayed it at the 
place of offering and sacrifice. 
Rudra had established his claim on earth. He did it when he 
claimed as his own the animals that had come to be after the confla­
gration of the lake of Prajapati's seed. Nothing else had been left on 
the site. He was entitled twice over to his claim, for he was the cause 
of the lake of sperm, not only by having caused the Father to let fall

his s-eed, but by his preparation of the seed. When the seed fell on the 
earth, the gods created a rune and fashioned Vasto၀pati. As Agni, he 
had also caused the conflagration of that lake. Furthermore, the 
Father in his role as Prajapati, Lord of Generation-or the gods-had 
made him Lord of Animals. However, the gods made him desist from 
his claim CAB .3.34). He spared the animals and gave them the span of 
their life. 
This was PaSupati's first action on earth, according to one version 
of his myth. Pasupati, Lord of Animals, was the status conferred by 
Prajapati himself on the threatening archer for sparing him. At that 
moment of horror-the Uncreate had been violated-the violator, 
the Father himself, was about to be shot at. The gods, in the other 
version of the myth, saw Pasupati, the very image of their horror, and 
made him into such an image. In this shape, "that god" appeared on 
earth. The myth does not end here. Its theme repeats itself in another 
form, on this earth, at the place of sacrifice. When, at that time, Pa­
supati-Rudra was seen on earth, his guise and appearance were those 
of an outsjder, come from the north. He was clad in black and was 
uncanny. The scene was the place of the sacrifice of the Angirases. 
Although the cattle left at the place of the sacrifice were his share, he 
accepted in their stead the remnant of the offering. 
Still, by the offering, though a remnant only, he was admitted to 
the sacrifice. His dark looming presence had seemed forbidding. He 
seemed a stranger. He had come from the north, which is Rudra's di­
rection (SB . 1 .7.3.3, 20; T5 .2.6.6.5-6). He came from his Himalayan 
mountain residence beyond Mount Mujavat. That was his dwelling in 
the wilderness on earth. But the north is also the cosmic North, the 
Zenith. The other gods have the east as their direction.16 
Rudra in the primordial scene appeared from nowhere; s back­
ground was the Uncreate. Though his dreaded name could hot be 
uttered, he was seen as an archer aiming at his prey. If, in the raw 
crepuscule of the first morning to which man was to owe his existence, 
the unnamed god could be seen as a hunter, he might well be credited 
with having come from somewhere here on earth, while his presence 
could also be felt high up in the sky, where he rose with the sun. His 
numinous presen"ce is not confined to any location; he can appear in 
the shape he chooses and in several shapes in one place. In his lowly

. LORD O F  T H E  D W E L L I N G  
guise as a wild hunter or as a man from the north, the god assumed 
credible shapes in accordance with the significance of his respective 
role. 
His first deed on earth when he confronted his animals was an act 
of grace. He let them live, he gave them the gift of life. His second 
deed, on the sacrificial site of the Angirases where N<ibh<inediġtha met 
him, is told differently in the two versions of this myth. According to 
one, Rudra graciously gave his reward to his seer, and according to 
the other he entered into an exchange with the seer. He gave his cattle 
and received the remnants of the offering. This could almost be seen 
as a slight, but Rudra was wont to accept any offering, even the most 
humble. At another sacrifice the gods had not let him have any obla­
tion, and without it he could not rise with them to heaven. He had 
resorted to force. Indeed, he had sunk low and could not rise with the 
other gods. 
This was the time when, as a rule, an offering was made to Agni the 
Fire after all the other offerings had been made (cf. SB. 1.7.3.7). 
When Rudra was left behind on the site, the gods yielded, though 
they were embarrassed, as all the oblations had been made 
(SB . 1 .7.3.4-5). They contrived a ritually acceptable offering out of the 
remnants of the oblations made to them, on dishes made ritually fit 
for the oblation to "that god" (SB . 1 .7.3.6-7). It was but a concession. 
Then the sacrificing priest offered this remnant into Agni, the Fire 
(SB. 1 .7.3.7). This was the end of Rudra's low state. For "Agni [the 
Fire] is that god;-his are these names": Sarva, Bhava, Pasupati, 
Rudra, Agni (SB . 1 .7'3.8).17 They are Rudra's names: Sarva, the 
archer, Pasupati, Lord of Animals, Rudra, and Agni. Bhava's name is 
added to them. Bhava means existence. The Briihma7Jl1 of a Hundred 
Paths explains, however, that this is the name by which the B<ihIkas 
call him, whereas the eastern people call him Sarva (SB .1 .7'3.8). 
Whoever the B<ihikas were, they called Rudra by an essential name, 
just as Sarva designates Rudra, the thrower of the arrow (saru). But 
Bhava too is an archer 0V. 15.5. 1). 
When Rudra could not rise to heaven, he himself was derelict, left 
behind by the gods. At the last minute they changed their minds, con­
trived a mode by which an offering could be put together for him, 
and offered it not to Rudra, but into the fire, to Agni. The gods, the 
17 Satapatha Briih1lUl'f.U1 (SB) . tr. J. Eggeling, 1963, part I, p. 201 .  

R E S I D E N C E  A N D  R E S I D U E ' 6 5 
celestial Intelligence , were well aware of the identity not in person but 
in essence of Rudra and Agni; they also remembered Rudra's arrow 
and his target, as well as the shape of horror that they had given him. 
The gods were ambivalent in their attitude toward Rudra. Indeed, we 
are told once that when they excluded Rudra from the sacrifice, he 
pierced [he sacrifice with his arrow-Prajapati is the paradigmatic sac­
rifice (TS .2.6.8.3; SB . 1 .7.4.3-4). The gods propitiated Rudra (TS. 
2.6.8.3). )l"onetheless, the wound had been inflicted; the arrow was 
well aimed, as it had been at the beginning of things. This had never 
been forgotten" In fact, this story is an echo of the primordial drama 
in reverse. And the gods relived this scene at the sacrifice of Dakġa. 
When the sacrificing priest offered into the fire the share that the 
gods had contrived for Rudra, Agni the Fire rose heavenward, and 
Rudra found his way to heaven. 
When the Vedic gods in their divine insight in that first dawn fash­
ioned Vas[Oġpati, it was out of the magic words of their poem, the rau­
dra brahman, that they "carved" or gave shape to him. That shape of 
the unnamed god was made of mantra, the potent creative word. It 
counterbalanced the anthropomorphic shape evoked by the action of 
the fierce archer. Rudra became Vastoġpati, lord and guardian of the 
vastu. Yastu is the key word in the mystery of the transformation of 
Rudra Pasupati, Lord of Animals, into Vastoġpati. Fashioned by the 
gods out of mantric words, he guards the meanings of vastu. 
3 .  RESIDENCE AND RESIDUE 
Rudra-Pasupati became Vastavya because he was left behind on the 
site (viistu) (SB. L7.3.1). "(Rudra) [Vastoġpati] is called Vastavya, for a 
remainder (vaslU) is that part of the sacrifice which (is left) after the 
oblations have been made" (SB . 1.7.3.7).18 
Rudra Pasupati becomes and is Vastavya with regard to the site on 
which he was left, and also with regard to the leftover portion of the 
sacrifice. Both site and remnant belong to him in his abject siate; there 
is nothing else that belongs to him. Moreover, when he is left on the 
vastu as Vastavya, he dwells in the viistu, the site. The vastu is his resi­
dence. There the residue (viistu) of the sacrifice will belong to him. 
These are his possessions. They are all that he possesses, and he is

66 
• LORD O F  T H E  D W E L L I N G  
their lord, Vastupa (cf. MS .2.9.7). Pasupati becomes Rudra-Vasto­
pati, the lord and guardian of the viistu. It did not take the gods of 
the raudra brahman long to transform the Wild Hunter Pasupati into 
Vastopati. They were blessed with creative intuition. 
The gods of the Satapatha Brahmarw were less gifted. They were 
sustained by rites whose proper observance was their concern. They 
judged the Wild God Rudra by conventional standards. Nothing but 
the remainder from the sacrifice was considered by the gods to be fit 
for Rudra. The gods implied a slight, while yet accepting him. The 
remainder from the sacrifice was superfluous-the sacrifice had been 
achieved, the rites had been performed. Yet a new oblation was of­
fered to Rudra by the will of the gods from the reconsecrated rem­
nants. Had nothing been left, there would have been an end. There 
would have been nothing to offer to Rudra. This would have been 
fatal. "Now Vastopati is Rudra. If he [the sacrificer] were to go on 
without offering to Vasto$pati, the Fire becoming Rudra would leap 
after him and slay him" (TS .3 -4 - 10.3).19 The residue of the sacrifice is 
a potent substance. 
4. THE POTENCY OF THE RESIDUE 
A hymn of the Atharva Veda (AV. l 1 .7) is addressed to the residue. The 
word there employed referring to the leavings of the sacrifice for the 
remnant is ucchi${a. In the ucchi$ta are deposited essence (nama) and 
form; the whole world is deposited in it, heaven and earth and all 
beings, being and nonbeing, death and Prajapati. Ucch4ta is the father 
of the progenitor (AV. l 1 .7. 1-3, 1 6). The hymn exuberantly extends 
the potency of the residue throughout manifestation and beyond, to 
the unmanifest creative principle. Jubilant, it sings of the birth of joys, 
of delights, and of all the gods in the heavens from the ucch4ta. 
Fire, ashes, leftovers are all part of the sacrifice, whether it is per­
formed on the sacrificial site of the earth or, at the same time, within 
the heart of man and in his own house. Fire, ashes, and leftovers are 
part of the ritual of living. Vastopati is the lord of the vastu, the site 
of the sacrifice, and the site of the house.2o He is the guardian of the 
dwelling of man, and protects it. As protector of the dwelling, Vcis-

3, succinctly defines viistu as "the site. the building, and its content."

toġpati is invoked in the Vedas (RV.7.54. 1 ;  7.55. 1 ;  AV.6.73.3; cf. 
TS-4-5·7·2), Brahmartas (TB.3.7.9.7; jB .3. 1 20), Srautasutras (APSS. 
6.8.28.8; BSS:J-4. 1 9; MSS . 1 .6.3. 1 ;  SSS .2. 16. 1-3) and in the Grhyasutras 
(JiGS .2·9.9; PGS .3-4-7; SGS .3.4) in the domestic ritual for building a 
house. 
Vastu, the "remainder," is doubly potent in its meaning. It is what is 
left on the site, and it is the site itself. The site, which was a wasteland 
after the conflagration of the lake of seed, is this earth, the ground of 
existence. On it the seed of Prajapati had fallen. The sun rose first 
from the flaming seed. Animal life arose from its ashes, and from the 
still-glowing coals the fire priests and Brhaspati, the great master and 
teacher of the gods, came into existence (AB.3.34). This earth in its 
sacral aspect is the site of the sacrifice, the vedi (cf. RV. 1 . 164.35; 
10. 1 1 0.4). It is regulated by the cyclical movements of the luminaries 
in the sky, by sunrise and sunset, by the solstitial and equinoctial 
points, by the movement and meetings of sun and moon, their mar­
riage. Thus in the myth of Cyavana the mystical marriage is re­
counted of the old decrepit Cyavana, who was left behind on the 
vastu, where his youth and potency were restored, and he became 
young again.21 He knew the brahmarta of Vastupa (jB .3. 120-28). 
Knowledge of the mantra of Vastupa, "the lord of the leavings of the 
sacrifice,"22 rescues Cyavana, abandoned by his kin in the "wasteland" 
(vastu); Vastupa is "the lord of one who is left or deserted."23 Vastupa, 
the guardian of vastu, is none other than Vastoġpati, lord of the vastu, 
the sustainer of man (RV.5.41 .8). He is Vastavya, the resident in the 
residue, the vastu and its lord. Vastavya and Vastupa, each is Rudra 
(MS .2.9.7). 
As Vastoġpati, the guardian of sacred order (vratapa), the unnamed 
god arose in and from the raudra brahman, the word of power of the 
gods when the seed of the Father fell on earth. Lord of the residue 
(vastu), the potent substance, lord of the site (vastu), the ordered field 
of power and its numinous guardian, Rudra, the Wild God, arose as 
Vasto$pati, guardian of the order of the cosmos and of the house built 
by man. It is Rudra who is skilled in art, the best of all artists, and the 
originator of all arts (MBh. 1 2, app. I ,  no. 28, line 3 10). "Because he

grants an abode to the world and protects it, therefore he is called 
Vastoġpati" (BD.2.44; cf. N. 1O.16). He is the Lord of the Dwelling. In 
its plan and orientation, the house built by man conforms with the 
laws of the cosmos. It has for its model the house of the cosmos, the 
House of Varul)a. In the shape of a fierce, fiery star, Vastoġpati, the 
hound of heaven, is its guardian. 
5. THE ARCHITECT'S MYTH OF VASTUPA 
Myth is transmitted verbally, and when it is given concrete form in 
works of art, also visually. Vastoġpati lived in the consciousness ofthe 
Indian architects who built the great stone temples about two millen­
nia after the hymns to Vastoġpati were first sung. These temples as 
they stand today arose out of a living tradition. The myth of Vastupa­
Vastoġpati, as the builders knew it, is told in textbooks on architecture 
of the first and second millennium A.D.24 
In the myth of Rudra-Siva as the architects knew it, Siva and Va­
stupa play two different roles. Rudra assumes many shapes; some 
have been named here already. He dwells in each, and each acts out 
his presence. He assumes these shapes at will. In the Maitraya٪i Sa"",­
hita (2.9.7), homage is offered to the many forms of Rudra from the 
bowman (nińangin) to the lord of the site (vastupa), illustrating not only 
the variety of forms in which Rudra appears, but also their reference 
to the center that they have in common, and from which the bowman 
or archer and the lord of the site are equivalent, at opposite ends of 
the same diameter. According to the situation that is alive with his 
presence, he manifests like lightning in an atmosphere charged with 
electricity. Suddenly he is beheld in one form or another, not neces­
sarily in any visible shape or in any of his known roles, though always 
unmistakable, whether as a concept or figure that bears the cogni­
zance of Rudra. His names and forms are the actualizations of his 
presence, which exceeds while it sustains each of them. Excessive, he 
plays more than one role at a time. Thus he might confront himself. 
In the myth that the architects knew, Siva is the Great God, and Va­
stupa is a goat-headed Asura or demon. This goat-headed demon 
came into existence at a sacrifice by Bhargava, son of Bhrgu, the 
priest of the Asuras. His proper name was Kavya Usanas. Bhrgu him-
24 S. Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, 1977, pp. 75-77; esp. p. 75 n. 34· 

A R C H ITECT'S M Y T H · 69 
self had sprung from the flaming seed of the Lord of Generation 
(AB·3·34)· 
Bhargava, the son of Bhrgu, was enraged because the demons had 
been defeated by the gods. To overcome this defeat, Bhargava of­
fered a sacrifice. Heated by the sacrificial fire and by his fury, he let a 
drop of sweat fall from his brow onto the fire while he sacrificed a 
goat. The goat became a goat-headed demon, growing until it filled 
heaven and earth. It left no room anywhere; the gods had nowhere 
to go. They took refuge in Siva. The fire from Siva's third eye burned 
the goat demon. Bhargava fled through the three worlds, but he 
found no refuge. He entered Siva's ear and wandered through Siva's 
body. Bhargava left Siva's body through the semen passage. Thus he 
became Siva's seed (sukra) and son (SRa. 1 .7. 1-15; jpad.3.26.93-1 1O; cf. 
VmP .43.26-44). He also became the planet Sukra (semen) (J3hP. 
5.2 2. 1 1- 1 2). As the morning star, its name is Lucifer.25 Sukra then 
asked Siva, who in his grace had given him asylum, to grant a boon to 
the disembodied goat-headed demon. The boon that the phantom 
demon asked for was to dwell (vas) on earth together with the gods. 
Siva granted him a residence (viistu) on earth, and gave him the name 
Vastupa. Whoever builds a house for gods or men should first wor­
ship Vastupa 
(SRa. 1 .7. 16-23; VVi-4-46-47 and commentary, 
jPad·3·26. 1 1O-25)· 
Bhargava, the Asura priest, having entered Siva's body, leaves it as 
Siva's semen (sukra) and becomes his son (VmP.43.26-44). He also be­
comes a star named Sukra (Venus) (J3hP.5.22. 1 2).26 Elsewhere, Sukra, 
son of Bhl,"gu, is said to have arisen in the sign ofTiġya (Vt:iP.53. 106); 
Tiġya is Rudra (TS.2.2. 10. 1-2). As son of Siva, Sukra mediates be­
tween Siva and the goat demon born of Bhargava's sweat, and thus 
his son. The goat, as a sacrificial animal, ritually belongs to Agni and 
is Agni's animal. Rudra-Siva, granting a boon to the goat demon 
whom he had burned, acts in accordance with his gracious nature, 
that is, as Siva. He gives to the dimensionless demonic phantom, ten­
uously though intimately related to himself, a name of its own, Va­
stupa, and allots to this being the plan of the sacred sites on earth, the 
temples and the houses, as residence. On it the gods will have their 
appointed stations. They will dwell on earth in the sacred geometry

of the viistu-maruJala, the magic diagram and form of the fallen de­
mon, the symbolic architectural plan.27 
The myth of the "birth" of Sukra from Siva was integrated into the 
architectural myth from another context dwelt on in the Mahiibhiirata 
(Mbh . 1 2 .278.2-37; below, Ch. VI.4). In one version of the architec­
tural myth, in the Matsya Purii'(!,a, the demonic being fallen to the 
ground is born from the sweat of Siva himself as it dropped from the 
forehead of the god fighting the demon Andhaka (MP.252'5-7). No 
less demonical than the goat demon, the being born in direct filiation 
from Siva has divine status, being called Vastu-deva or Vastu god, the 
deity of the site (MP.252. 1 3-14). God or demon, the fallen being, laid 
out on earth, partakes of Siva's nature inasmuch as tamas, darkness, 
belongs to him. On this demonic substratum all the gods find their 
apportioned stations (MP .252. 1 3-14). Together, the underlying de­
mon and the gods distributed over his extended form constitute the 
paradigmatic ground plan of Indian architecture, which has its origin 
in Siva.

MANI FESTATIONS AND 
REALIZATIONS OF RUDRA 
1 .  SATARUDRIYA: THE HUNDRED FORMS AND 
THE HOST OF RUDRAS 
Unnamed he appears on the cosmic scene in the first dawn of the 
world, a hunter sure of his target: the sexual embrace of the Father 
and his daughter. At this moment he revealed the terror of his iden­
tity to the Vedic ni who guarded his secret. 
The picture is clear and sharply focused, a close-up on the vast ho­
rizon of a yet un peopled world. The actors, an archer and the copu­
lating antelopes, are, however, not what they seem. They are anthro­
pomorphic and theriomorphic symbols of deity. There was nobody to 
see the scene except the gods, and when they saw it, it was immedi­
ately transformed in different ways. Whatever their attitude, it was 
the hunter who had all their attention, and now they saw him quite 
unlike his fierce, fleet figure. It was not so much that the gods saw him 
in a different shape; it was more sensing than seeing when they 
carved him as Vastoġpati. Though he had no features and did not re­
semble man or animal, they knew he was the lord who had shown 
himself, who had stirred them when the hunter took aim at the de­
fenseless creatures absorbed in their vital need. Moved, they gave 
shape to all that the scene before their eyes called up in them. They 
carved its counterpoise out of the rhythmic words of the hymn 
(RV. IO.61 .7) as the Father's seed was falling. Other gods who had wit­
nessed the scene were seized by horror, and they put all their fright­
all their most terrible shapes-together, avd made it the shape of 

7 2 ·  M A N I F E STAT I O N S  O F  R U DRA 
"that god" whose name the raudra lrahman does not utter (AB ·3·33). 
A conglomerate of shapes of terror is what these gods of the Aitareya 
Brahmatla made out of the figure of the hunter in the primordial 
scene. 
Seen by the gods as a hunter, he was shaped by the gods of the .fJ.g 
Veda in the mantra's order of rhythms, rites, and laws. This is how the 
gods with their divine eye saw the frenzied archer. Other gods in later 
texts, however, were less inspired than overcome by emotion. They 
combined the dread shapes of their fear and horror in one body, and 
this conglomerate of divine frightfulness at once asserted its exist­
ence. Such was the shape of him who claimed as his own the residue 
on the wasteland of this earth. 
Later, he was seen by man as the great and dreadful archer, of 
many shapes (TS -4-5. 1 . 1). Had not the different hosts of gods already 
seen him in altogether different shapes? The cowherds saw him, as 
did the women who carried home water from pond or well (VS . 16.7; 
TS -4-S. 1 .3). And others saw him bearing a hundred quivers, and look­
ing at them with a thousand eyes, his color glowing in red hues of fire, 
and his neck deep blue (TS .4.S. 1 .  3-4; VS . 16. 7, 8, 1 3)' The Satarudriya, 
a hymn of the Yajur Veda (TS-4-S. 1-1 1 ;  VS. 16. 1-66) to Rudra of a 
hundred and more shapes, begins with an antiphonal praise to the. 
wrath of Rudra; it offers praise to his arrow and bow, praise also to 
his kind arrow and kind bow that spare man and beast, and praise to · 
the healer (TS -4-5. 1 . 1 ;  VS . 16. 1-S) and hail to him, the pursuer, "dread 
and destructive like a fierce wild beast" (TS -4-S. 1O.4; cf. RV.2.33. 1 1)1 
himself wearing a garment made of skin (TS .4.S. 1 0.4); hail to the 
slayer (TS .4.S.8. 1). 
To this god of dread and bliss, the Satarudriya, a paean incompara­
ble in its compelling immediacy, gives praise. It celebrates Rudra the 
archer whose flying arrow brings death, whose arrow averted or at 
rest gives life. From the eleven sections of the hymn in the Taittiriya 
SaTflhita, Rudra arises throughout the universe and beyond. Ingredi­
ents of his being are assembled from many domains and many levels. 
Their blending evokes his presence. The following extracts com­
pacted from the Satarudriya may give some of the flavor of the juxta­
positions set closely in the rich texture of the hymn.2

in the sands and in the streams (TS .4.5.8). 
Hail to him of the desert and hail to him in the dwelling place, hail 
to him in the cow pen, and to him in the house, hail to him of the 
cot and of the palace, hail to him in soil and in air. Hail to him of 
the wide space, hail to him in the leaves and in the fallen leaves 
(TS -4-5.9). 
Furtively the hunter drew near the Father; thus the laud goes to 
those of furtive pursuits and low standing. They are forms of Rudra; 
he dwells in those outside the pale, just as he dwells in the abnormal 
and deformed. He is the healer of all ills and the architect of the uni­
verse, and he works through the hands of the craftsmen. He is Rudra, 
thousand-eyed and of many colors (TS -4-5. 1.2-3). Rudra looks out of 
every man and everything. The lord of creatures, Pasupati, the lord 
of sentient beings, sees himself in them. Throughout the laud of the 
Satarudriya his protection is invoked. 
The protection that is invoked is twofold: that his arrow be averted 
and his bow unstrung. Yet, though he may not even release the arrow, 
though the bow be unstrung, the awareness of the arrow by his crea­
tures is a taut bond. The bow of Rudra has a wide span. Pinaka or 
Ajagava bends along the vault of the firmament and the course of the 
sun. 
When the cowherds saw him, and the women who carried home 
pots of water on their heads from the pond, and all the world of the 
living saw him (cf. TS.4.5. 1.3), they saw his blue throat (TS.4.5.1 .3) 
gleaming like that of the peacock. It was a permanent mark on his 
body. He had acquired it when, at the churning of the cosmic ocean, 
he drank the world poison and thereby saved all living creatures and 
the gods. The poison did not harm Rudra. It only left its mark on his 
throat. Whoever sees it will feel protected by Rudra and strengthened 
when Sarva, the fierce archer, takes an arrow from his quiver. 
The universe resounds with Rudra's presence; he is sound and 
echo, intangible vibration and infinitesimal substance, too, of every 
particle of dust and foam. His presence is immanent in verdant trees 
and the soft green grass. He is in the rustling, withered leaves and the 
silent dead. Unmistakably, the healthy and the afflicted are hallowed 
by his sign, while his innumerable arrows Hit across the universe. At 
certain spots his presence is acutely felt. These are fords (tirtha), and

at them he is the ferryman. He ferries across to the other shore, into 
the far beyond of which he is the guardian. He is the liberator, but­
paradoxicaUy-he is also the ferryman from death to life. The fierce 
guardian of the Uncreate, at the inception of life on earth, having en­
tered into the created world, is the ferryman who leads to the other 
shore. In this created world his images representing part of his energy 
are carved in stone on the Sun Temple of Konarak overlooking the 
ocean, from the thirteenth century to this day. The images are those 
of the Ghaf.ltakarl}a Bhairavas, two on each side of the temple; one 
image peaceful, the other wrathful. Each of these large figures dances 
in a small ooat, the "world-ooat." It forms the pedestal of the Bhai­
rava. They protect the temple.3 The world is Rudra's boat; it is also 
his hunting ground. When the archer hangs his weapon on the high­
est tree and approaches man, holding only the spear (TS +5. 10.4), 
then the god gives happiness (Sambhu) here on earth and peace (San­
kara) (TS-4.5.8. 1). In his grace he is Siva, the giver of happiness 
(TS .4.5.8.1) and of pain (cf. TS .4.5.9. 1 ). He keeps in abeyance the in­
numerable thousands of Rudras, resting in the trees, blue-necked, 
white-throated, golden and deep red, who unless propitiated and in­
voked to unstring their bows would pierce man in his food and his 
cup as he drinks. With propitiation they hold back their arrows and 
receive within their jaws the enemy of the propitiator (cf. TS +5. 1 1 . 1-
2). Such is the insecurity oflife as it came to be when Agni-Rudra pre­
pared the seed for the Father. 
Hundredfold, thousand-eyed Rudra has innumerable faces (cf. 
SUp.3. 16). He has each and everyone's face. Everything human is in 
him, for he is in every man. The interchange between god and man 
is swift and intimate. He is in the faces, heads, and throats of all; he 
dwells in the heart of all beings. He is the Lord, the all-pervading, om­
nipresent Siva (SUp.3. 1 I ). Because he is in the face of man, man sees 
him with His eyes, tastes him with His tongue; all the senses of man 
are readied by Siva for Siva, and he knows Him in whatever shape. 
He is woman, man, young man, and young girl; he is the old man. He 
is the deep blue bird and the green parrot with red eyes; he is the 
cloud with lightning and the seasons and the seas (SUP'4'3-4)' He has 
entered them and they vibrate with his intensity. He overwhelms and 
supports, he haunts, he grips and liberates. A potent fragrance ema-

nates from him in terror as well as in glory (RV.7.5g. 1 2; TS. 1 .8.6.2). 
He is the one who cuts, pierces, and assails (MBh. 1 2, app. 1, no. 28, 
line 278). He is all anxieties, diseases, the destroyer of disease, and 
disease itself (MBh. 1 2, app. 1 ,  no. 28, line 33 1). Wherever life is felt 
most acutely, that is Rudra. He is lust; he is subtle, he is gross; he is the 
golden seed; he is fond of garlands made of Kan:tikara flowers (lines 
320, 323), He is shadow and sunshine (line 2 13). He has the color of 
the rising sun and the form of a child and of a child's toy (lines 231-
32). He is food, its eater, its giver, the eating of it itself, as well as the 
creator of it (lines 255-56). And he is the Rudras who dwell in and 
animate all creatures and dwell throughout the universe (lines 368-
80). Swiftly he travels from without to within as so many Rudras who 
are the uncounted, uncountable forms of his presence. He is one, he 
is e1even,4 he is the numberless intensity that identifies each Rudra. 
He leaps into the mouth of man from food and drink; he does not 
enter through eye and ear alone. All the senses are his doors, by 
which he goes in and out. The Rudras, hundreds and millions of 
them (AP . 1 8.44), carry arrows; they hit vulnerable, receptive goals on 
solid ground, in water and air, in every component of life, in the cos­
mos and in man. They act out His presence. They are the angels, mes­
sengers of His awareness springing from every part of His impercep­
tible body. When Rudra reaches out from within man he recognizes 
himself in the lowly and abject, in tender grass and the fall of leaves. 
The Rudras are an ancient group of gods. They are invoked in the 
fJ.g Veda together with Rudra (RV. 7.35.6; 7.10.4). Their number is 
given as eleven (SB -4.5.7.2) in a tripartite universe of thirty-three 
gods (RV.8.35.3), or they are said to be thirty-three in number 
(TS . l  -4- 1 1 . 1 ), or many more in a triadic system in which the number 
of the gods is thirty-three but also three thousand three hundred and 
thirty-nine (RV.3.9.9; 10.52.6). The number eleven remained their 
numerical cognizance throughout the myth of Siva, though their host 
cannot be counted. 
4 G. Dumezil, My the et epopee, 1968, pp. 247, 248, juxtaposing the Rg Vedic decom­
position of the thirty-three gods into three groups of eleven gods with the decomposi­
tion more frequently found in the Briihmar:ws and Epics into the three groups of eight 
Vasus, eleven Rudras, and twelve Adityas, points out the three functions of the respec­
tive groups, the Adityas being the sovereign gods, and the Rudras occupying the sec­
ond level. That the number eleven of the Rudras remains the same in both kinds of 
subdivision appears pivotal, though the significance of the number eleven is not ac­
counted for.

Rudra is manifestation itself, together with its consciousness of the 
absolute. Before the creation of man in the cosmic dawn, he appeared 
in the guise of an archer, an avenger in defense of the unrevealed ab­
solute, whose substance spurted into creation at the first embrace of 
the Creator and his self-begotten daughter. Rudra as the conscious­
ness of the absolute had failed to preserve its integrity. He came too 
late by the fraction of time that the newly rising sun had placed be­
tween his bow and his target. 
The world of Rudra resounds with repercussions and resonances 
of his presence. They surround him in throngs and groups, and are 
his companions. Thus in the Mahiibhiirata, when Asvatthaman faced 
the guardian of the gate to the camp of the PaI;H;!avas, this gigantic, 
inimical figure adopted by Rudra-Siva to dissimulate his presence, his 
mouth ablaze with fire (MBh. 1O.6. 1-S), was suddenly joined by mighty 
beings with blazing mouths and eyes and many feet, heads, and arms. 
They looked like elephants, like mountains. They had the shapes of 
dogs, boars, and camels, and the faces 0 f horses, jackals, cows, bears, 
cats, tigers, panthers, crows, frogs, and parrots. Some had the heads 
of mighty serpents, others those of different birds, tortoises, croco­
diles, porpoises, whales, and lions. Some had ears on their hands, a 
thousand eyes, no Aesh, or no heads. They had blazing eyes and 
tongues and faces of fire. Some were like conches, had faces like 
conches, or ears like conches. Some wore garlands and girdles of 
conches, and the voices of some resembled the blare of conches. Some 
had matted locks and some were bald; some wore diadems. Some had 
beautiful faces, some had head ornaments oflotuses, some wore white 
waterlilies. They numbered hundreds and thousands. Some had 
weapons of various kinds. Some were covered with dust or smeared 
with mud; all were dressed in white. Some had dark blue limbs and 
others light red. The excited retinue played upon drums and 
conches. Some sang, some danced, some leapt and skipped, Aeet and 
fierce, their hair waving in the wind. They were terrible, frightful. 
Some had large genitals. They were fearless, masters of speech, aston­
ishing the Great God by their worship. They adored him in thought, 
word, and deed, and he protected them as his legitimate sons 
(MBh. lO·7· 1S-42). These tribes of mighty beings partook of the na­
ture of the Great God. Asvatthaman saw them all. He felt no fear 
when he offered himself as a sacrifice into the Great God (49-50).

Rudra-Siva agitated his ambience and made bearable the fierceness, 
the terror, of his splendor. They flashed across it in frolicsome fright­
fulness and sprinkled tensions with blood-curdling wit. Reverbera­
tions of and commentary to Rudra's presence, their host-lit up by 
leaping flames-gamboled worshipfully in his light. 
Like Rudra himself, the Rudras keep astir their field of action, the 
ambience of Rudra, seen in a vision, experienced in nature, or felt in 
the heart. "Abiding in bodies, they do not cry but make the embodied 
beings cry; they gladden but themselves are not glad" (MBh. 1 2, app. 
1 ,  no. 28, lines 369-70). "Their number, measure, and form are not 
known" (line 379). Fitted with any form or having no form, the Ru­
dras activate sentiency, tingle sensibility, tease and sharpen aware­
ness. They predispose creativity for its moment of collection and im­
mediacy of insight. They are the tensions that draw together subject 
and object; nerves are the strings of their bows. 
Unnamed and alone, Rudra had appeared on the cosmic scene in 
its first dawn, a hunter sure of his target. The exaltation of the Sata­
rudriya and the extravagances of lesser works are but adumbrations of 
the incommensurable intensity that is Rudra. Exceeding the conscious 
limits of thought, his being comes to a point at the flaming tip of his 
arrow. As an archer Rudra appears on the primordial horizon. As 
Agni he had prepared the seed of life for the Father and thus com­
pelled him toward procreation, toward becoming Prajapati, the Lord 
of Generation. As Rudra he lashes out backward against the Father's 
violation of the hitherto inviolate plenum. The Father rages at the in­
terruption of his embrace. All this violence is but a refraction of the 
mystery of procreation. Rudra is its avenger and at the same time he 
is its cause. The Wild God, the hunter, by turning against the first em­
brace turns against himself who caused this transgression-the rup­
ture of the Uncreate-by the Father. Rudra is Agni; he is the insemi­
nating fire that rages in the fury of sex that he had instigated in the 
Father who, mounting his daughter, violated the integrity of the pre­
existential plenum. The animal form of intercourse of the Father with 
the daughter, neither a paradigm of incest nor of bestiality, is an im­
age-spontaneous as nature is-of a metaphysical situation, the rup­
ture of the integrity of the pre-existential plenum and of its discharge 
into existence. In front of the mating pair rises ominously the Wild 
God Rudra who is Lord of Animals, who is Agni aflame. His body is 
made of "the fire of yoga" (SUp.2. 1 2). In this yoga body of fire the 

GOD O F  D A R K N E S S , 7 9  
wild, fierce god acts at the dawn of creation. His appearance is that of 
an archer. On the Harappan seal a god in his majesty is enthroned in 
a yoga posture. 
Rudra has two natures, the one wild and fierce, the other calm and 
kind; but these are only one pair of the extremes that are in him. In 
the first dawn he acts in his Fire nature, inflaming the Father by pre­
paring for him the seed that holds the spark oflife, while as Rudra he 
counters the consequence of his part in the creative-procreative proc­
ess. Rudra, the archer, while avenging the leak or opening up of the 
plenum, like Kdanu, and even like Vrtra, the precosmic serpent, acts 
counter to creation. These defenders of the integrity of the unmani­
fest plenum are overcome or only partly successful; in one case due 
to the Soma powers of Indra, the dragon slayer, in the other case due 
to Time. Krsanu's arrow just grazed the flying falcon and did not pre­
vent his bringing the Soma to man. But neither Vrtra nor Krs.:'mu in­
cited or was the ultimate cause of the violation of the precosmic 
plenum, or of the rape of its most precious substance. It was Rudra 
alone who got ready that very substance for Father Heaven and, hav­
ing given it to him and having avenged the violation, brought guilt on 
himself. 
The fierce Wild God then was given a shape of conglomerate hor­
ror for his appearance in the wasteland of this earth. When at another 
time he came to the place of the sacrifice of the Angirases, the fire­
youths who had just ascended to heaven, he looked a stranger, omi­
nously dark. When he was given no share in the Soma sacrifice, he 
had to accept lesser offerings, not on hallowed ground but away from 
it at the roadside or the haunted crossroads (SB .2.6.2.7). Those who 
had served him felt it necessary to wash their hands lest they become 
polluted by their contact with him (SB .2.6.2. 18).5 He had taken on 
himself this part and played it so well that the down-and-out, the petty 
criminals, the homicides, the devious and deformed had faith in him, 
their god. He was real to them in the darkness of life where they have 
their place. 
2. THE GOD OF DARKNESS 
The cosmos in Vedic tradition is seen as a fabric woven by the gods in 
warp and woof (RV.6.g.2 ;  10. 1 30. 1 ). The threads form a grid m

8 0 · MA N I F E STA T I O N S  O F  R U D RA 
which everyone has his place. This Vedic symbol of the web, signify­
ing the inherent order of the phenomenal world, is com plemented by ' 
another symbol that is concerned not with the completed fabric but 
with the nature of the threads that make the closely woven grid. The 
symbol is that of the gur:ws or strands of which the thread is twisted. 
This symbol is ontological; it applies to the quality of the texture of 
the fabric, depending as it does on that of the strands or fibers of 
which the thread is made. Each thread of the cosmic fabric, according 
to Samkhya,6 a later Vedic and subsequent mode of seeing or philo­
sophical approach, consists of three strands. They are called sattva, ra­
jas, and tamas. They are the three constituents of the cosmic "sub­
stance" ( prakrti), the imperceptible substratum of the manifest world. 
Ontologically, prakrti is prematter. Each strand of prakrti has a poten­
tiality or tendency of its own: sativa is seen ascending and luminous, 
tamas descending and dark, rajas twirling and red.7 Tamas is the tend­
ency in the process of manifestation that belongs to Siva 
(LP. 1 .65. 1  29). Sativa and rajas belong to Viġl).u and Brahma, respec­
tively (MaUp.5.2). In the ongoing myth of Siva, Brahma [i.e.,-, Praja­
pati or the Father] plays a leading part from the beginning. Viġl).u apြ 
pears only later on the scene of Siva's myth. The three tendencies or 
gUttas, however, are of equal importance in the reification and expe­
rience of becoming concrete of the manifesting universe. Looked at 
ontologically rather than mythically, a state of prematter or "preac­
tion" ( prakrti) is postulated. It is not the "Uncreate." If a position 
could be assigned to prakrti in mythical terms, this would be prior to 
the very beginning of cosmic dawn, just before Agni-Rudra was about 
to get the seed ready for the Father. But prakrti is quiescent, motionز. 
less in a state of potentiality, though each of the constituents of pra­
krti-each of the three gur:ws-has its intrinsic movement. However, 
the three guttas are in a state of balance and do not interact prior to 
the initial stress of creation. Then prakrti evolves into mahat, the Great 
Principle, the cosmic will-to-be, or the ordering intelligence ofthe cos­
mos; prakrti evolves furthermore into ahamkiira, the individuating

principle, and also into manas, the principle of cognition. Hence the 
five sense powers (irulriya) come forth, as do the five subtle elements 
(tanmatras). The sense powers are those of cognition (jiiina) and of 
action (karma). They are the powers to hear, feel, see, taste, and smell. 
The subtle elements are their correlates. They are the essence of 
sound, touch, form, flavor, and odor. The five powers of action are 
the power to speak, the power to procreate, the power to excrete, the 
power to grasp, and the power to move. All these powers are capaci­
ties inherem in manas, the principle of cognition. The subtle elements, 
the tanmatras, have no magnitude. Throughout this ontology all the 
three gutlaS interact, though they are variously dominant at different 
stages. Tamas increasingly exerts its downward pull on the tanmiitras 
that become concrete as the five elements (mahiibhuta): ether, air, fire, 
water, and earth, perceived through the sense organs.

tization of the perceptible world, the mode of contact of the tanmiitras 
with the corresponding faculties of the perceiver, postulates the three 
gurzas or constituents in the evolving prematter ( prakrti) out of which 
things condense. These constituents or tendencies remain unchanged 
in their potentiality, though the degree of activity of each varies from 
stage to stage in the process of evolving from pre matter to matter with 
its five elements. Tamas is darkness; when this gurza increases its activ­
ity, the darkness becomes deeper, denser, and heavier, and by its 
weight tends to obstruct the other two gurzas. It can be considered the 
first efficient cause of physical manifestation or of the five elements of 
which the cosmos is composed. It leads the descent from prematter 
into matter. The descent into matter-beyond which the cooperation 
of the three gurzas does not extend-would end with the dissolution 
of matter: Rudra, to whom tamas belongs, would annihilate the con­
stituents of the cosmos and dissolve them in darkness, steeped in its 
Own density. In it all the fivefold categories of existence and the three 
8urzas are dissolved together with their numbers, Five and Three, 
Siva's sacred numbers. 
It was as a darkly attired uncanny stranger from the north that 
Rudra appeared to Nabhanediøtha at the place of that sacrifice by 
which the Angirases had risen to heaven. At another sacrifice Rudra 
Was left behind here below, when he was unable to ascend with the 
gods. Like a dead weight he was left behind, heavy with misgivings. 
There is much darkness in Rudra. When he sinks low and into the 

8 2 , MAN I FE STAT I O N S  O F  R U D R A  
abyss of his own being, he draws the world with him into the cosmic 
night of dissolution. Tamas is the heavy downward pull into disinte­
gration. Tamas is the dark ground of Rudra's being, whence the flame 
of destruction leaps upward. It ends physical existence and liberates 
from ahamkira, from individuation and the ego. When the thousands 
and thousands of arrows ready in the hands of Rudra (TS -4-5.10.5) 
have hit their targets, Rudra is seen as Sambhu, the cause of tranquil­
lity, Sankara, the giver of bliss, Siva, the liberator (TS.4.5.8. 1 ). As lib­
erator and giver of happiness, Siva is in all beings, their indwelling 
potential of freedom and peace. He also dwells in a blade of grass, a 
mote of dust, in sound and echo, in all that is manifest in the world of 
the senses. He pervades the fivefold ontological hierarchy formu­
lated by Samkhya and Yoga philosophy. The Svetasvatara Upani:jad 
meditates on Siva, the Lord (isvara) of and in the manifested world, 
as a river of five currents, which are the five sense powers (indriya), 
and fed from five sources (the elements) and with five whirlpools (the· 
sense objects), an impetuous flood of five pains (SUp. 1 .5 and.com-
mentary).8 
. 
The metaphors and images of the Svetasvatara Upani:jad are situated 
in the microcosm, the universe of meditative introspection. The river 
of the Lord flows through a world of anguish into a darkness hidden 
in its waves. It flows down in the direction of tamas, into that limitless 
pool of indistinction, the abyss in which Siva absorbs all the worlds 
at the end of time (SUp.3.2), for in him all dissolves at the end 
(SUp.4. 1 1 ). 
The metaphors and images of the Upani$ad correspond to Samkhya 
categories. The fearful river cascades downward ineluctably, as re- , 
lentless as the pull of the tamo gurm, the strand of darkness in the web 
of the cosmic fabric. It was there from the beginning of time. Tamas, 
the strand of darkness in its descending tendency, helped to extend 
the cosmic fabric in manifestation; the strand of saUva with its ascend­
ing tendency exerts its counterpull; and rajas firmly twists each 
thread. Tamas, the dark, descending, disintegrating tendency, pullS 
down the fabric of the cosmos out of existence into darkness. This de­
scending tendency, however, also helps to unfold the fabric in exist­
ence so that its three-colored structure, the black tamas, the white 
sattva, the red rajas, upholds the manifold patterns of the multicol­
ored web.

Tamas, beheld from on high, draws into creation as it also pulls out 
of it. It inheres in all that is manifest. In creation tamas, counteracted 
by the two othergu1Ja5, toward the end gains momentum and density, 
and its weight pulls out of existence the fabric of the universe. 
The interaction of the three gUtuLS has its image in divinity. Hindu­
ism knows rajas preponderating in Brahma-for the creation of the 
Universe; tamas preponderating in Siva-for the destruction of the 
Universe; and sattva predominantly in ViġI).u-for the welfare of peo­
ple. The extinction at the end of creation is not a return to, but only 
a symbol of, the Uncreate. This darkness appears periodically at the 
end of a world and before the creation of the next cosmos. Within the 
cosmic fabric the tamo gutul belongs to Rudra as Kala, the black one, 
the power of Time and Death in the cosmic process. 
At the beginning of creation Rudra in the guise of a Wild Hunter 
avenged the integrity of the absolute. His arrow hit the Father Praja­
pati, the Lord of Generation, cohabiting with his daughter; seed fell 
down on earth, the very seed that Rudra-Agni had prepared for the 
Father. Rudra thereafter was born from Prajapati, and he entered 
into creation (Ch. V.I ). 
A seemingly unresolved contradiction links Rudra the Fire with 
Rudra the Archer. He entered creation and played both these roles, 
carrying into creation the ambi\'alence that was at the very beginning 
of things. 
In creation the ambivalence that is in Rudra informs the roles he 
plays. As the dread archer he dispenses death. If he averts his arrows 
or does not let them fly, he redeems from death the fear-stricken 
creature and bestows on it the gift of life. The Mahamrtyunjaya mantra 
invokes Rudra, the conqueror of death, who has the power to inflict 
or to withhold death (RV.7.59.12). 
When at the end of days Siva in his tamas nature draws the cosmos 
into dissolution, it disintegrates into the darkness of nonbeing. It is 
without shapes, an indefinable continuum, yet unlike the Uncreate. 
Disintegration of the cosmos prefigures reintegration into the integ­
rity of the Uncreate. 
Siva, the destroyer who leadွ out of the cosmos, is the Great Yogi 
who within himself annihilates the world of experience; he is the fer­
ryman and the ferry leading from this world to the other shore 
(TS·4·5·8.2), to a nameless beyond to which the darkness of dissolu­
tion is only an allusion. "When there is no darkness, there is neither 

8 4 · M A N I FE STAT I O N S  O F  R U D R A  
day nor night, neither being nor non being, only the one (Siva) alone" 
(SUp.4. 1 8). Siva in absolute transcendency, Siva in manifestation and 
its destroyer, Siva in the darkness of dissolution is at the same time 
the lord of sentient beings, Pasupati, Lord of Animals, their fierce 
hunter of a hundred shapes. 
3. ENCOUNTERS WITH RUDRA 
a. The Drink with Kesin, the Ascetic 
The whole world is the place where Rudra is felt to be manifest; at the 
time of the dissolution of the cosmos, Rudra is also manifest. Within 
a beginningless and endless pillar of flame he reveals himself to the 
gods in the darkness of the flood (Ch. VII.2). The extent and exist­
ence of the cosmos as well as its nonexistence are the perennial stage 
of his play seen by gods and man. 
He has another place, too, more intimate and hidden within the 
heart of man the microcosm. When he enters it, everything else is 
closed out in the mystic realization of his presence. Entranced, the 
mystic upholds heaven and earth; weightless, he soars with the wind; 
heated, he glows with the sun. His asceticism sweeps him into ecstasy, 
his body has no limit, he has drunk poison out of one cup with his 
god. He is a muni, moved to his depth and carried away in his trans­
port. 
One such muni was KeSin; "long hair." He was clad in faded yellow, 
all that distinguished him in the eye of mortals, who saw only his 
mortal body, though he carried fire, poison, heaven, and earth 
(RV. 10. 136. 1-3). The long-haired one was called the sun's light 
(RV. lO. 136. 1 ). Girt with the wind, this entranced, long-haired ascetic 
rode with the rush of the storm where the god entered him 
(RV.IO. 1 36.2). Ecstatic with ascetic rapture he mounted the gale 
(RV . 10. 1 36.3). Kesin flew through the air beholding all the shapes be­
low (RV. 1O. 1 36.4). This entranced muni was at home by both the 
oceans, in the east and in the west (RV. IO. 1 36.S). Moving with the 
movement of Apsarases, the ethereal nymphs, their consorts, and the 
untamed beasts, Long-hair knew their minds and was their sweet, 
most enchanting companion (RV.1O.136.6). The wind had stirred it, 
Kunarpnama prepared it, and together with Rudra Long-hair drank 
the poison from a cup (RV.IO. 1 36.7). 
An uncanny power emanates from the unnamed poison prepared 

E N CO UN T E R S  W I T H  R U D RA 
• 8 5 
by Kunarpnama, whose name possibly means the "indomitable." In 
wind-swept ecstasy, the muni drank the poison out of one cup with 
Rudra. By this "sacrament" the god entered him. Transcending 
space, the muni soared, holding in his hands the cup and the fire of 
Rudra. The muni glided with the wind. The muni, like the Lord of 
Animals, infused his movements with the grace of the wild beasts, 
akin to those of the celestial spirits. 
The Rudra realization of Kesin is that of a shaman or yogi. Kesin 
flew in the glow of the fire in him, and which he held in his hand. His 
elation and ascension were caused by the drink of communion. Like 
a fiery river, Kesin's long hair traced his swift flight from east to west, 
high above. While he saw all the world below him, and knew the 
minds of animals and celestials and that they loved him, weightless he 
carried heaven and earth to the light of the sun that illumines him. 
Rudra had entered the muni. His rapture lifted him together with 
his god to the sun. He brought it his cup and flame, his knowledge 
and love. In his ecstasy, the muni had left below the weight of his 
body and its limits. Rudra had entered him. Kdin soared, filled with 
. the unearthly fire of the god. To Kdin, Rudra revealed himself by 
entering him, flying with him in the still core of the transport of the 
long-haired one. 
The realization of Rudra by the muni is given form in the wake of 
a long tradition of shamanistic yoga practice. Its ecstasy glows with the 
fire and the drink of Rudra. At another time it was not an unknown 
ascetic but a formidable warrior whom the god entered. 
b. Rwira Enters Asvatthiiman, the Warrior 
His name was Asvatthaman. The Mahiibhiirata telIs of DroQ.a, the com­
mander-in-chief of the Kauravas in their war with the paQ.Qavas, who 
could not be defeated unless he failed to defend himself. DroQ.a was 
slain by the enemy through a ruse of KtQ.a. Hearing in the midst of 
a battle the false news that his son Asvatthaman was dead, DroQ.a lost 
his resolve (MBh.7.164.68-77). Defenseless, he was decapitated by the 
enemy (MBh.7. 165.38-53), and Asvatthaman became the commander 
of the Kauravas. Torn by grief and revenge, he set out in insensate 
rage, straining to slaughter the paQ.Qavas, not in battle but during 
their sleep (MBh. 10. 1 .53-64). When he came near their camp a gigan­
tic being, effulgent like the sun, stood at the entrance. His loins were 
girt with a tiger skin, his upper garment was a black antelope skin. A 

l6 · M A N I F E ST A T I O N S  O F  R U D R A  
arge serpent was his sacred thread, his long arms wielded weapons. 
Flames of fire blazed from his open, terrible mouth. His thousands of 
Jeautiful eyes shot forth flames. Fire issued from his nose and ears. 
From those flames hundreds and thousands of Viġl}uS issued, 
ှquipped with conch, discus, and mace (MBh. lO.6.2-g). 
Fearlessly, Asvatthaman hurled his weapons against the blazing 
Jeing, who devoured them all, while the firmament was crowded with 
images of Viġl)u. Finally, Asvatthaman stood unarmed before the 
flaming being who had absorbed in fire all his weapons (MBh. lO.6. 1O-
1 8). Helplessly, Asvatthaman took refuge in Rudra, whom he had not 
recognized in front of him, but who would dispel the being that ap­
peared as a dreadful rod of divine punishment (MBh. lO.6.32-34)' He 
)ffered himself to Rudra, ready to sacrifice his body to him. Instan­
taneously a golden altar appeared before Asvatthaman, upon it a 
blazing fire. Hosts of monstrous beings, companions of Rudra, 
swarmed around Asvatthaman. Fearlessly, Asvatthaman asked Rudra 
to accept him as a sacrificial oblation, ascended the altar, and entered 
the fire. There he stood immobile with arms raised, and Rudra en­
tered his body, having given him a shining sword. Filled with divine 
energy, Asvatthaman became greater in battle (MBh. lO.7.49-6S). 
Driven mad by grief and revenge, Asvatthaman the warrior was to 
become a murderer. In his rage, he had not recognized Rudra when 
the god barred his way to the camp of the sleeping enemy. The air 
had become filled with Viġl)us that had emanated from the flames of 
Rudra.9 He should have recognized him, for the god showed himself 
in his cosmic, thousand-eyed, flaming glory, attired in raiments that 
distinguish Rudra alone: the black antelope skin of the ascetic, the 
lion skin of the hunter, and the serpents that are Rudra's sacred 
thread and ornaments. When the weapons that Asvatthaman had 
hurled against the gigantic fiery body were consumed by the blazing 
flames issuing from mouth, nose, ears, and all the thousands of eyes, 
the looming fiery giant contracted into one mighty blazing rod that 
spelled his punishment to the warrior now unarmed. His own weap­
ons that he had hurled against Rudra now seemed to confront him, 
9 G. Dumezil, My the et epopee, takes the ViƗl)u images in the sky to prove that the 
phantasmagoria was produced by ViƗl)u, the protector of the pal:H;lavas. It seems, how-. 
ݩver, that Siva, the Great God, is seen here emanating to the furthest horizon his ViƗl)u 
power. The many ViƗl)us in the sky contributed to Asvatthaman's bewilderment, and 
he did not immediately recognize the Great God-who up to that time had favored 
Krél)a, and had been with the Paiicalas in the enemy's camp, vol. I, p. 2 14. 

E N C O U NTERS W I T H  R U DRA • 8 7 
fused to the height of the god himself at the core of the fiery shape. 
The blazing rod appeared to Asvatthaman as his rod of punishment 
for his intent of surreptitious murder of the paQQavas. At this mo­
ment Asvatthaman sought refuge in Rudra, praised the god, and of­
fered his body to him. Asvatthaman entered the blazing fire on the 
golden altar that had appeared before him. Motionless he stood in it, 
himself like a rod with arms raised. He offered himself in his maximal 
measure with arms extended upward (MBh. l0.7.59). This is the ges­
ture of the sacrificer by which he exceeds the height of his body and 
symbolically shows himself as consecrated (cf. MS .3.2.4; SB . 10.2.2.6). 
Within the blazing fire, Rudra gave to Asvatthaman a shining sword, 
and entered the warrior's body. The stainless shiny sword forged in 
that fire would make Asvatthaman achieve his end. 
Inner realization prompted Asvatthaman's self-sacrifice. It had 
come out of a haze of grief, rage, and guilt. Unrecognized, Rudra had 
stood in front of Asvatthaman. The warrior recognized Rudra when 
the god was felt by him as the fire of the avenging rod; Asvatthaman 
entered the sacrificial fire on the altar, and in its flames he received 
from the god his shining sword. 
Rudra, in his blazing shape of power in front of the camp of the 
sleeping enemy whom Asvatthaman was about to murder, was the fire 
that threatened, enveloped, empowered, and entered the warrior As­
vatthaman. It was Rudra, the dread and terrible slayer, the killer who 
causes intense pain, the protector of warriors (cf. TS .4·5· 2 ;  4.5.8, g). 
Beside himself, swept and degraded by his rage, Asvatthaman was not 
aware that he was born from a mixture of Mahadeva (Siva), Antaka 
(The Ender), Krodha (Wrath), and Kama (Desire), combined into a 
unity (MBh. 1.61 .66-67). 
Only when Asvatthaman had spent all his weapons and had made 
himself defenseless did he recognize the god in him. At that moment, 
Siva entered him and filled his being with divine energy. He entered 
Asvatthaman as the Destroyer. Asvatthaman had to bring about de­
struction like Rudra himself at the end of a yuga. He compared him­
self to Rudra when he related his plan for slaughtering the enemy 
(MBh. 1O'3.29)' Rage (krodha) possessed Asvatthaman, and the desire 
for vengeance for DroI).a killed by Krġma's ruse and righteous Yudhi­
ghira's lie, in order to save the PaQc;lavas from being destroyed by 
DroI).a. KrġI).a said, "In such circumstances falsehood is better than 
truth. There is no sin in untruth if it saves life" (MBh.7. 164.99).

not unlike Agni, the Fire, who had prepared the seed for the Father. 
The Father became sexually excited, and was about to emit the seed 
into his self-created daughter, but some of the seed fell down on 
earth. Prajapati, stirred by the Vratya, was similarly impelled toward 
generation. He became aware of the gold that he carried within him; 
he became aware that he himself held the golden germ (AV. lS. 1 . 1-2; 
cf. hira1J.yagarbha : RV. 1O. 1 2 1 . 1 ,  1 0).14 It was this gold that Prajapati 
brought forth. He did it without the intervention of a female partner. 
Prajapati shed the gold that he had held within him. At once it turned 
into the One with a mark on his forehead. This mark was of the shape 
of a third eye. The Being grew in greatness, full of creative power, 
full of tapas and truth; it went on growing and became Mahadeva, the 
Great God, who is Siva, the Lord. He became the Sole Vratya 
(AV. lS· 1 . 1 -6). 
The crescendo in the transmutation of the gold generated from 
within himself by Prajapati reached its climax when the divine prog­
eny had become Isana, the Lord who is Siva, the Great God (Maha­
deva)-having a mark on his forehead, Siva's third eye. 
Like Rudra-Agni, who had prepared the seed for the Father, the 
Vratya caused great commotion within the progenitor or Prajapati. It 
made him shed the immortal substance, the semen or gold. The se­
men is the immortal seed of creation out of the Uncreate. Gold is the 
imperishable substance known in creation. Prajapati as Hirar:tyagar-
bha is their storehouse. 
. 
The Vratya, a yogi, had magic power, and like Agni himself he 
aroused Prȳapati. He stirred the Lord of Generation into awareness 
of himself; he incited and illumined him. This Vratya was one of the 
elect among the other Vratyas. His transforming vision came to him 
when he was just walking along-and faced Prajapati. At once Praja­
pati saw the gold within himself and became aware of stirrings within 
himself caused by the Vratya. Then that golden radiance generated 
by Prȳapati in instantaneous succession turned into the Great God. 
Rudra-Siva emerged from Prajapati. He was his son by the agency 
ofthe Vratya. The birth of Rudra is told as it happened in the rapture 
of the Vratya. When he knew that he had stirred Prajapati, he iden­
tified himself with his action and with the outcome of his action. 
When the Vratya saw Mahadeva, the Lord born from Prajapati, he 
1 4 Cf. F. Max Milller, tr., Vedic Hymns, SBE 32, 1964, part I, pp. 6, 10· 1 3. 

E N C O U NTERS W I T H  R U DRA • 9 1 
saw him become the Sole Vratya, the one and only Vratya, the prin­
cipal Vratya, the ultimate form in which the ecstatic ascetic recognized 
as one the Great God and his own true Vratya being. The Sole Vratya 
comprised Rudra in a crescendo of his form, together with the Self of 
the Vratya deified in his enthusiasm, whereby he dwelt in God who 
had moved him while he stirred Prajapati. 
In mystic realization the Vratya brings about the birth of Rudra 
from Prajapati and recognizes in Rudra his own divinity. The mirac­
ulous generation of Rudra as son of Prajapati is the mythical aspect of 
the mystic realization of the Sole Vratya. 
Now the Sale Vratya took up a bow. "That was Indra's bow. Blue its 
belly, red (its) back" (AV. 15. 1.6-7)Y; 
i. The Bow of Rudra 
Rudra's essential weapon is the arrow, the fire-tipped missile 
(TS.6.2.3.1-2) that hits and inserts itself into his target. The shape of 
the arrow is that of unilinear flight, while the power of the bow, stored 
in its curve, vaults over a field of action. The bow that the Sale Vratya 
took up was hallowed by long practice. It was Indra's bow. Indra, king 
of gods, as soon as born took up his bow, asking his mother who were 
his enemies (RV.8.45.4). The bow was to protect Indra from the mo­
ment of his birth. His weapon of attack, however, was the vajra, the 
thunderbolt. With it Indra fought Vrtra, the ancient serpent and 
guardian of the Uncreate. When Vrtra's dead body sank into the 
abyss, the waters of life that had been held captive by him began to 
flow into the cosmos under the light of the sun (cf. RV.1 .32.4-9). That 
was in an earlier aeon. That aeon had Indra for its creator, and his 
bow-as golden as the sun at first (cf. p. 32)-became the rainbow (In­
driiyudha ; cf. MBh. 13.14.1 22), vaulting over his domain in all the 
colors of the spectrum summarily seen from blue to red. This bow the 
Sale Vratya takes up. The newborn god takes over the rule of what 
had been lndra's domain: the cosmos. 
When the Vratya sees his god taking up the bow in the radiance of 
his vision, does he see the light shining from the god born of Praja­
pati's gold, refracted in the colors of the bow, and does he also see 
them on the body of the god? In the terse juxtaposition of the words 
of the hymn lie both meanings.

9 2 ·  M A N I FESTAT I O N S  O F  R U DR A  
The red god with the blue throat was seen by the cowherds and 
those who carried water (TS .4.5. 1 .3). Nila-Lohita, the "blue and red," 
is one of the most common names of Rudra in the Purarw,s. Nila­
Lohita is Rudra in manifestation. In these colors, as Nila-Lohita, he 
entered the universe (cf. VaP.27. 1-6). 
The Ekavratya realization by the Vratya is now filled with colors. 
They cast their meaning over the god and his domain protected by 
his bow. Pinaka, which means bow, is particularly the bow of Rudra­
Siva; it is also known as Ajagava (MP .23.37). Ajagava is the southern 
part of the path of the sun, where it shines in the midnight of the 
year, in the darkness of the abyss, in the cosmic South, the realm of 
death.16 This other, frightening, aspect of Ni'la-Lohita is as much 
within Rudra's being as it is within the words nila-lohita themselves. 
Lohita means red, it means blood. The blood of the bridal night leaves 
its dark stain on the bridal garment; darkness has blue (nila) for its 
color; it is the death color of the red blood. Together, the colors nila­
lohita incarnate the life-death magic of blood by which the bride 
bewitches the groom. This is what the I;lg Veda marriage hymn cele­
brates: it literally "sets afoot" the magic (krtya) of blood (RV.1O.85.28-
29). The power of the blood magic of nila-lohita gets its color signature 
from sex. Witchcraft lurks in it, life and decay. Over this fatality of 
the human condition vaults Nila-Lohita, the bow of Rudra, in the 
colors of Rudra. The Wild God himself, as soon as born, is Nila­
Lohita, comprising the color spectrum of the flames of fire. 
From lndra, king of gods, the rule had passed to the Sale Vratya. 
The bow here is the symbol of lordship over the cosmos. While In­
dra's bow is the rainbow, the bow of the Sole Vratya has no name. The 
bow Pinaka is indeed the bow of Rudra, called Ajagava in later texts. 
However, the piercing arrow is more intimately Rudra's weapon. 
Once pointed it hits its target, whereas the arc of the bow comprises 
a wide domain. The dart or arrow is the weapon particularly of 
Rudra-Sarva, who owes his name to his missile,sarn, the "arrow." The 
straight line of the pointed arrow is the symbol of centrifugal aggres­
sive fatal power; the bow, charged with tension, is akin in its curve to 
that of the vault of heaven. The bow is a symbol of cosmic supremacy. 
It is-a symbol of Rudra, Isana, the Lord, one in essence with Rudra

E N C O U N TE R S  W I T H  R U DRA • 9 3  
Nila-Lohita, in whom the light of the sun is refracted in the colors of 
the blood magic of life and death. 
The bow of Rudra / Isana is a status symbol of the Lord, the ruler 
of the universe, whereas the arrow symbolizes Rudra, the Wild God, 
the hunter in action. It is by their actions that the figures of myth 
manifest their being. 
ii. The Drive into the Cosmos 
The mystical transport of the Vratya, having turned into a color vi­
sion of the Sole Vratya, now lets him see the god in action. The Sole 
Vratya arises in his greatness. He moves out on his vehicle, the mind, 
first toward the east,. then toward the south, toward the west, and fi­
nally toward the north. He is clad in discernment (vijnana). His hair is 
night. Day rests on it as his turban (AV.lS.2. 1). Mind is his vehicle. In 
each of the four directions his retinue is formed by different gods and 
by different songs. The sacrifice, the sacrificer, and the cattle are with 
him when he moves toward the south. A harlot and a bard accompany 
him as he moves out in each of the four directions (AV. lS.2.2-4). The 
couples of harlot and bard are not the same in each direction. Faith 
and friendshipl7 are the bard and harlot who go with him toward the 
east (AV. 1S.2. 1); dawn and incantation (mantra) to the south (AV. 
IS.2.2); cheer and laughter to the west (AV. 1S.2.3); lightning and 
thunder northwards (AV. lS.2.4). His two footmen are "what is" and 
"what is to be"; the new and full moon; day and night; and "what is 
heard" (here) and "what is heard abroad,"18 respectively, for each 
quarter (AV. lS.2. 1-4). 
Moving out from himself as the center, on the chariot of the mind, 
the Sole Vratya incorporates into his presence the four directions of 
the extended universe. They are filled by his retinue. 
Having driven out in each of the four directions from his center, he 
stands still. "He stood a year erect" (AV. lS.3. 1)!9 Carrying day and

erect for one year, the unit of time in its revolving cycles. He orders 
a throne to be brought to him (AV. lS.3.2). After he ascends the 
throne, all beings wait on him (AV. lS.3.10). His guardians, the 
months of the year, not only are stationed in the four directions of the 
extended earth but also protect him in the fixed center and from on 
high, two guardians in each direction (AV. l S.4. 1-6). This is how the 
twelve months of the year are distributed. 
In the intermediate directions, the attendants of the Sole Vnitya 
take their stand. All of them are archers, each bearing a name by 
which Rudra, the primordial archer, had become known. They are 
Bhava, Sarva, Pasupati, and Ugra, the ferocious (AV. lS.S. 1 -4). Rudra 
is the archer "from the intermediate direction of the fixed quarter" 
(AV.l S.S.S),20 that is, of the center. Mahadeva, the Great God, is the. 
archer in the intermediate direction of the upward point (AV. 15.5.6). 
Moreover, the archer;Isana, the ruler, attends the Sole Vnitya from 
all directions (AV.lS.S.7). 
When the Sole Vratya drove out in his chariot, the mind, he took 
possession of the extent of the earth in the four directions. Time ac­
companied him on his way. He carried it on his head in his night­
black hair and his day-light turban. He established his rule over the 
earth and over time in its movement. Then he stood still for a year, a. 
firm pillar of the universe, enthroned in the center of the manifest 
cosmos. All beings waited on him, their central support and ruler. He 
surrounded his position between heaven and earth in the center of 
the cosmos by assigning stations to the months of the year. He stood 
still for a year and then he gathered it around him. He saw to the de­
fense of his position by stationing archers, projections of himself, near 
to himself. He assigned the central position to the archer Rudra, the 
Wild God. Isana, the ruler, became the archer in all the intermediate 
directions. The ambience of the Sole Vratya is safeguarded twice over 
by the directional extent of the position of each archer, as well as by 
that of Isana in every direction. If the spectacle of the Sole Vratya tak­
ing possession of the earth has the pattern of a mm:u;lala, his cosmic 
extent is a monument of time arising with the power of the archer. A 
fixed (dhruva) position is allotted to the archer Rudra. It is the central, 
quintessential position with reference to the four directions, and the 
central place on earth below the zenith. One could see in this dhruva

dis or central region a prognostic reflex on earth of Dhruva, the Pole 
Star, the cosmic North Pole.21 
In one line, along the central pillar of the Sole Vratya, the archer 
Mahadeva is his attendant in the upward quarter. The archer Is:ina, 
being stationed in each of the six intermediate directional points, is 
active also next to Rudra and next to Mahadeva, on each critical point 
of the Vratya-pyramid or cosmic mountain, an ordered space-time 
compact, the cosmos of the Sale Vratya. 
iii. The Transcending Monument of Ekavratya 
The movement of the Sole Vratya exceeds the vertical extent of the 
visible cosmos, upward beyond the fixed region, beyond also the up­
ward region to the "highest region," thence to the "great region," and 
further to the "most distant region," and beyond it to the "region 
without direction," and finally to the "region without return." The 
Sole Vratya extends himself into transcendency, encompassing seven 
levels, seven spheres, in his transcosmic presence, which is built up 
from the fixed, basic, central position, the domain of Rudra-Isana 
(AV. 1 5·5·5; 15.6. 1-7). 
The Sole Vratya is a choreographed monument of deity built up by 
the words of hymns. They set up a structural cosmos whose upward 
direction, exceeding the height of the cosmic mountain, ends beyond 
the empyrean, in the region without return. It is reached in one 
straight line from the fixed quintessential center of the monument, 
the domain of Rudra-Isana, the archer. Isana, the archer, is in attend­
ance in each direction. His power rules the cosmos. 
In his ecstasy, the Vratya sees himself born anew through Prajapati 
from the immortal substance within the lord of progeny. He sees him­
self reborn into greatness; he sees himself with a mark (blazing) on his 
forehead. He has become Mahadeva, the Great God, I§ana, the Lord: 
the Sole Vratya. 
Rudra guards the fixed quintessential position in the cosmic struc­
ture of the Sole Vratya. All the archers are multiples of Rudra. They 
differ in name, for they occupy different positions, equal in value. 
The transfigured ecstatic Vratya has been reborn. He is the Sole 
Vratya who is Mahadeva, the Great God. 
The Vratya has become an apotheosis of cosmic dimension and 
2 1  A. Scherer, Gestirnnamen bei den Indogermanischen Volkem, p. 1 1 7. 

96 ·  M A N I F E STAT I O N S  O F  R U D RA 
transcendental direction. Eliade speaks of the "cosmic structure of the 
vriityas' 'mystical' experiences."22 On the level of this earth, the Sole 
Vratya, clad in discernment, drove out to the four orients in his char­
iot, the mind, carrying the light of day in his headgear and night in 
his dark hair. Wherever he drove, the appropriate gods and songs ac­
companied him, as well as a couple composed of a bard and a harlot. 
They are a different couple in each direction of space, amicably 
matched and of related natures. Faith and friendship, cheer and 
laughter, lightning and thunder, dawn and mantra; they are human, 
natural, spontaneous, and potent. In a joyous procession, the Sole 
Vratya moves out in the four directions of space with the accompani­
ment of songs, amid the uttering of mantras, rumbling thunder, and 
peals of laughter. The rhythms rest on feelings of faith and friend­
ship. Bard and harlot change costumes and expressions as they en­
liven the fourfold excursions of the Sole Vratya extending to east and 
south, to west and north, bringing the gift of day and night with the 
assurance of their conjunction in the basic sequential rhythms. 
After this prelude, the Sole Vratya stands still in the center for one 
full year, drawing into and encompassing within himself his fourfold 
movement. He stands guarded by time in a space that his movement 
has traversed. He stands with the majesty he has gathered in himself 
and for which a throne is needed. The months are appointed guard­
ians of the throne throughout the year, and the four seasons are its 
legs (AV. 1 5.3.4). The Sole Vratya now arises as lord of the space-time 
universe, himself the central pillar of a four-sided pyramid, his at­
tendants in the intermediate directions. Each of these attendants is an 
archer. They are Bhava, Sarva, Pasupati, Ugra, Rudra, and Maha­
deva. Rudra is the attendant archer of the fixed point; Mahadeva, the 
Great God, the attendant of the upper region. Moreover, the archer 
Isana, the Ruler, attends from all directions. All these seven are arch­
ers and thus of Rudra nature. They are distinguishable by their 
names. Bhava means existence and also origin; Sarva is the essential 
archer; Pasupati the Lord of Animals; Ugra the ferocious; Rudra the 
Wild God; Mahadeva the Great God, and Isana the ruler or Lord. All 
of them together are the Sale Vratya, god in manifestation. Yet he 
exceeds these forms. Unattended by any archers, he extends beyond 
the upward region through yet higher spheres, of which the last is the 
22 M. Eliade, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, 1958, p. 105.

region of no return. His retinue diminishes as he moves upward from 
plane to plane. When he comes to that of no return, none but four 
Great Goddesses follow him (cf. AV. 15.6.7). Rudra's presence on the 
firm ground of this earth stands guard, while the Sole Vraty<:' extracts 
from it the power to ascend into the empyrean. He is Rudra's tran­
scendency. 
In his "enthusiasm"-a state of being in god and of god being in 
him-a roving ascetic, a Vratya, realized the birth of his god and his 
own rebirth in that god. He caused and saw his god being born, he 
saw him in his majesty on earth and rarefied in his ascent, extending 
himself into a vanishing point in the beyond. 
The metaphysical pyramid of the Sole Vratya, a construct of inner 
vision and realization, rises above rites and processions and joyous 
crowds, protected by the presence of Rudra, the archer. The Sole 
Vr<ltya is a realization from here below into the beyond; it is a form 
that cannot be measured, and in which a Vratya, one of a roving 
band, set a monument to Rudra in and beyond the cosmos.23 
The Vratyas are classed in the Mahiibhiirata with those low on the 
social scale, such as Soma vendors, arrow makers, astrologers, poison­
ers, and the like (MBh.5'35'39-41 ). The Vratya, whatever his social 
status may have been, was close to Rudra. That Vratya, 'just going 
about,"24 felt in himself the power to stir the creator (AV. 1 5. 1 . 1 ), and 
he built a metaphysical monument to the Sole Vratya. It rested on 
Rudra.

THE B I RT H  OF RUDRA 
1 .  THE BIRTH FROM PRAJAPATI 
a. The Ancient Names 
When Rudra claimed as his own the animals into which the ashes of 
Prajapati's fiery lake had turned, his shape was indescribably grue­
some and his name was Pasupati. The gods had given him both form 
and name; they had made him Lord of Animals; they had made him 
VastoĠpati, lord of the viistu. Another time, Rudra claimed the ani­
mals as his own, those found not on a wasteland but on a sacrificial 
site where the animals had been left. Then he appeared as a man 
darkly clad, a man whose identity was revealed by his claim. As Pasu­
pati, their lord, the cattle belonged to him. They had remained on the 
site, and what is left over (vastu) on the site (viistu) belongs to Rudra. 
Pasupati, Lord of Animals, shades over into VastoĠpati, lord of the 
viistu in both its meanings. In the wasteland as well as on the sacrificial 
site he relinquished his claim. Gruesome and uncanny he looked. 
This Rudra, the fierce god, acted as Siva the gracious. Rudra assumes 
one shape or the other; he is both. As fire and as archer he was the 
determining presence in the primordial scene; the arrow, his fiery 
sign, shines to this day in the sky. 
The first target of the archer was the Father, Prajapati, the Lord of 
Generation. So formidable was the archer, the guardian of the tran­
scendental wholeness, that his name could not be mentioned. Praja­
pati, who at that time had the shape of an antelope, in order to arrest 
the arrow of the archer made that Wild Hunter Lord of Animals, Pa­
supati. This is the ancient account (MS .4.2. 1 2). Did Prajapati the an­
telope, investing the Wild Hunter with lordship over animals, implic-

B I RT H  F RO M  PRAj ApATI • 99 
itly acknowledge him as his Lord? The later version in the Aitareya 
Briihmarta recounts that the gods created this god's shape of terror out 
of their own horror at Rudra's formidable deed (AB .3.33). At that 
time--or in that version-the gods were swayed by emotion, by their 
own fears, whereas in their creative inspiration they gave to that god 
the shape of Vasto˹pati. 
Vasto˹pati,. Pasupati, and also Prajapati are titles more than names. 
They designate the particular mode in which a god operates. It is by 
their actions that the gods are known. They have cognizances but are 
without stereotyped shape, though Pasupati was created by the gods 
as a symplegma of horror. Rudra, the savage god, too horrendous 
even for his name to be said aloud, the primordial guardian of the 
absolute, becomes the guardian and Lord of Animals as well as the 
guardian and lord of the viistu. The domains over which he rules are 
the state of nature and the state of art, the passionate and the creative 
self of man. While Rudra assumed this double lordship, the semen of 
Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, had fallen down on earth. Rudra­
Agni had prepared it for Prajapati, the Father. While it was being 
shed, the gods created Vasto˹pati. Agni, the Fire, consumed its copi­
ous downpour, and Rudra claimed the cinders and ashes as his own. 
These turned into animals. Pasupati, Lord of Animals, rules over 
these creatures of Prajapati's passion that he had caused to flare up. 
The formidable guardian of the absolute played an ambiguous, inev­
itable role. As guardian of the substance of immortality, he entrusted 
the seed of creation and readied it for the Father, and, too late, at­
tempted to prevent its fall to earth. The involvement of Rudra and 
Prajapati is frightening. A straight line leads from the preparation of 
the seed by Rudra I Agni to its being shed by the Father and to the 
gods' creation of Vasto˹pati. This line is crossed by the flight of an 
arrow. 1 The point of intersection lies in the Father. Rudra carries the 
action and responsibility, as carrier of the fire seed on the one hand, 
and as archer and guardian of the Uncreate on the other. Prajapati is 
his target and victim. However, the myth of Rudra flows on through 
?ew situations prefigured before the sun had risen on the first morn­
mg. 
Among them his birth is preeminent. In the I;?g Veda and the Mai­
triiya1J1 Sarp,hitil Rudra appears full-fledged on the scene, preeminently 
1 The three stars of the belt of Orion are said to correspond to Rudra's tripartite ar­
row. Cf. B. G. Tilak, The Orion, p. 1 00.

as a hunter. His different forms or designations, Vasto!;pati and Pa­
supati, were created by Prȳapati himself, and by the gods according 
to their own intuition or emotional reaction. The Briihmarws and the 
Atharva Veda, on the other hand, deal with the birth of Rudra, child 
of Prajapati. 
The birth of Rudra from Prajapati was adumbrated by the falling 
of the seed and the gods' creation of a brahman from which they 
formed Vasto!;pati. The mystery of the seed proceeds from its being 
made ready for the Father by Agni / Rudra to its being shed by the 
Father, "conceived" by the gods in their brahman, and given form as 
Vasto˹pati. The cosubstantiality with Rudra of the seed prepared by 
Agni / Rudra for the Father and emitted by the Father is part of the 
genealogy of Agni. Rudra, like Agni, is the son of himself (tanunapiit, 
cf. RV. l .  13.2). His birth as a crying or self-assertive child, moreover, 
Came about in more than one way, though the father is the same 
whether he is called Prajapati or, as is the case subsequently in the 
Puriir.tas, Brahma. 
Before Rudra was born, in the myths of the Briihma'tl-as he was the 
god whom the Satarudriya extols and whom the ȯg Veda (RV.2.33. 1 1) 
sees in fierceness enthroned on the high seat of his chariot the world. 
The birth of the god as. a mode of his manifestation introduces the 
element of time, and henceforth actions of Rudra will be laid out se­
quentially, though more in a causal than an historical order. They will 
be the consequences or the transpositions of paradigmatic themes, 
and their reality will be that of perennial symbols. They will form a 
framework in the narrative of Siva, which will be filled by many other 
myths, so that his being emerges from their total inexhaustible ac­
counts. 
b. The Golden Bowl and the Wrath of Prajiipati 
Prajapati wished to procreate. He practiced austerities, he exerted 
himself. Fire, Wind, Sun, Moon, and Dawn were born from him. The 
four sons of Prajapati also practiced austerities, and seeing lovely 
Dawn, their sister, the four sons became excited in holy passion and 
they shed seed. Prajapati gathered the sperm in a golden bowl. From 
this arose the god of a thousand eyes, a thousand feet, a thousand ar­
rows (KB.6. 1 ). 
This story, obviously an after-image of the primordial myth, makes 

B I RT H  FROM P R Aj A pATI • 1 0 1  
Rudra by indirection the son of Prajapati. Seed is shed as it had been 
in the primordial scene. However, it was not shed by Prajapati but by 
his sons, moved by the appearance of their sister Dawn. They did not 
have congress with her, the daughter of Prajapati, nor was there any 
disturbance; they got excited and were incontinent. Prajapati col­
lected their sperm in a golden bowl; its height and width were meas­
ured by an arrow's ftight (KB .6. I). Prajapati took to himself the sperm 
of his own sons. He held it in a vessel of gold, the incorruptible, im­
mortal substance. Prajapati carried this precious bowl as if it were his 
womb and he became the parent of the Archer who holds a thousand 
arrows, his thousand eyes fastened on his target and carried forth by 
a thousand feet. In this magnificat, the newborn is PuruĠa or Cosmic 
Man, hymned in the lJ-g Veda (RV. IO.g0). PuruĠa is this whole world 
(RV. IO.g0.2). He is beheld in the figure of man, but he is immeasur­
ably greater. PuruĠa has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and ar) 
thousand feet (RV. lO.g0. 1 ). 2 A thousand here is not a numeral, but a 
symbol of immensity. While he is this whole world, PuruĠa exceeds it. 
Cosmic Man of the lJ.g Veda has no attributes, he has nothing but his 
body-while the god arisen from the bowl of Prajapati holds a thou­
sand arrows. Immediately the overpowering figure of this newborn 
god grasps his father and demands to be given a name (KB.6.2). Be­
fore, when he appeared, an archer in the early dawn of creation, the 
terror he aroused was in his action, by his aiming at the very act of 
creation-procreation. None would dare to utter the name of that god. 
But now he insists upon being named. 
He aims at his father Prajapati, who asks him, "Why do you shoot 
at me?" The newborn one demands, "Give me a name; without hav­
ing a name I shall not eat food here." Prajapati gives him the name 
Bhava, Existence. But a second time he aims at Prajapati. He wants a 
second name, for with only one name he will not eat any food. Praja­
pati gives him his second name, Sarva. A third time he aims at his 
father, repeats his demand, and receives his third name, Pasupati. 
Still, he will not eat unless he receives one more name. He aims at his 
father five times more until he has received five more names: Ugra­
deva, the formidable god; Mahadeva, the Great God; Rudra; Isana, 
2 Puru˗a, Cosmic Man, is the prototype of all Indian images of deity showing prolif­
eratIon of limbs and body parts. Cf. D. Srinivasan, "The Religious Significance of Mul­
tIple Bodily Parts to Denote the Divine Findings from the Rig Veda," 1975, 137-79.

the Lord; and Asani, lightning (KB .6.2-g), eight names in all. Each 
one of the names implies a cosmic reality or domain, such as the sun, 
moon, water, and fire. 
What food in the world will sustain this avid being of a thousand 
eyes and a thousand feet unless it be this entire world? The hunger of 
Rudra newly born is that of existence. He aims at his father and does 
not let him go until he has been given by him the eighth name. He 
held him in his power until he, "eating the food he desires, assuming 
the forms he desires" (TUP.3. lOS),3 receives name after name. When 
his indwelling power was confirmed by each new name, only then did 
he relax his hold. He has received his identity and sustenance. He was 
relentless in his demand and hunger to assimilate, to convert into his 
own being, to take into himself the entire creation. This is the food by 
which he lives, and which, as Agni, he consumes. He is now confirmed 
in this world-his sustenance and substance. He is Cosmic Man, Pu­
rua: "Purusa alone is this entire world, both past and future; he is 
also the lord of immortality when he mounts above . . .  through food" 
(RV.IO.gO.2).4 The newborn god takes into himself the whole world. 
He encompasses the entire earth and exceeds it (SUp.3. 14). 
The birth of "that god" from Prajapati presaged in the raudra brah­
man took place from Prajapati in more than one manner. An un­
known ascetic, a Vratya swayed by the god within him, stirred the 
Lord of Generation into consciousness of that gold, the semen in his 
body; he stirred the Lord of Generation, who then emitted that gold. 
It turned into a being with a mark on the forehead. The being so 
marked grew by his innate power and asceticism and became what his 
"birthmark," the third eye, prognostically showed-the Great God 
Rudra, the Lord, the one and only Vratya, Ekavratya, the Vratya in 
excelsis. The unknown Vratya had made him manifest by means of 
the mind and body of the Lord of Generation. By an organic alchemy 
in divinis, Rudra, the Lord, Isana, was born from Prajapati. The shin­
ing gold from within Prajapati became Isana the Lord. Immediately, 
Ekavratya took up a bow, the bow of Indra, as a token that the power 
of Indra, king of gods, had passed on to him. Ekavratya with a "mark" 
on his forehead is as formidable as Rudra risen from the golden bowl 
of Prajapati.

B I RTH FROM P RAj A. PATI • 1 0 3 
If Prajapati in the KaU$itaki Briihmar.w appears a somew hat feminine 
character carrying the golden bowl in which the seed shed by his sons 
was gathered, Prajapati in the book of the Vratya in the Atharva Veda 
is the male creator whose seed is imperishable radiance in gold 
(AV. 15. 1 . 1 -2). Hiraoyagarbha, the "golden germ," generates by its 
own power. The birth of Mahadeva, the Great God, takes place by au­
tarky of the Lord of Generation. No female element plays any part 
whatsoever in this nativity. This is also true of another account of the 
birth of Rudra from Prajapati given in the Satapatha Briihmar.w. Here 
it is said that when Prȳapati spent himself into creation, all the gods 
abandoned him except Manyu, Fury, who sparkled like Fire 
(SB .g. 1 . 1 .6; d. RV. IO.84.2). Manyu, creative fury, and tapas, creative 
heat, are as close to each other as are Manyu and Kama, creative de­
sire (cf. AV.g.2.23). They are degrees and aspects of the creative fire. 
Prajapati cried. His tears fell on Manyu, and Manyu became Rudra of 
a hundred heads, a thousand eyes, and a hundred quivers, his bow 
strung and his arrow fitted to the string (SB .g. I . I .6). God Wrath who 
stayed with Prajapati is the creative fury of Prajapati. God Manyu was 
fecundated by the hot tears of the Lord of Generation, and he became 
hundred-headed, thousand-eyed Rudra-like unto PuruĠa, the effi­
cient cause of the universe-but he also had a hundred quivers. They 
belonged to Rudra as the fierce archer Sarva, now brought to life by 
the tears of the Lord of Generation, which inseminated his own fury. 
In this way, too, Rudra was generated by Prajapati; he became the son 
of the Lord of Generation. But it was Rudra-Agni who made this 
cosmic manifestation of his come about. The fire genealogy of cosmic, 
hundred-quivered Rudra begins with Agni-Rudra, who prepared the 
seed for the Father, in whom sexual passion was still burning when 
the fire of Rudra's arrow turned it into wrath. Wrath was kindled in 
Prajapati by Rudra. Prajapati's hot tears fell on Manyu, and Manyu 
was born as Rudra's true self. He was Rudra. The gods were afraid of 
him. 
Rudra, whether born as cosmic giant from the golden bowl of 
Pr့apati, from the gold in the Creator, or from Manyu (Wrath), re­
mains an archer as he was in the primordial scene. As PuruĠa, Cosmic 
Man, his hunting ground is the entire world. Woman has no part in 
either the birth from Manyu or in that of the Lord as Ekavratya, and 
only participates at a double remove in the birth from the golden 
bowl. The sons of Prajapati shed their seed by merely seeing their 

1 0 4 · B I RT H  O F  R U D R A  
lovely sister Dawn, the daughter of Prajapati. From that seed in a 
golden bowl held by Prajapati, Rudra is born. 
The gods who were afraid of Rudra-Manyu were advised by Prajaس 
pati to offer food to him in order to appease him. They offered to 
him the four hundred twenty-five offerings of the Satarudriya sacri­
fice,; and appeased him with the enormous offering and grandiose 
litany (SB .9. 1 . 1 .7). The birth of Rudra / Manyu (SB .g. 1 . 1 .6) is a sacس 
rificially cosmic event that parallels the birth of the ravenously hungry 
cosmic archer of the Kāitaki Brahmar:w (KB .6. 1-2). Sacrifices are the 
food by which gods live. Man provides the food; by sacrificing, he 
consecrates himself. When Rudra / Manyu, the newborn child of 
Prajapati, longed for food, he stood hungry and aflame on the fire 
altar that had now been completed. Agni had become Rudra. The 
gods made him immortal (SB .g. I . I . 1 ). 
The gods were not immortal from the beginning. They became im­
mortal by drinking Soma, the elixir of immortality. They were de­
pendent on man, on Soma, and on the sacrifice. 
Rudra wanted to be immortal as were the other gods. But he also 
wanted to be born. His birth was presaged in the primordial dawn. 
He was born as Wrath, he was born as PuruĠa, Cosmic Man, he was 
born as the Lord, Ekavratya, he was born as a child, the son of Praja­
patio 
From the beginning, Rudra the Wild God was unlike the other 
gods. He wanted to be on one level with them ritually. His status as 
god had to be confirmed sacrificially. Beyond this, his metaphysical 
reality needed cosmic reification. He had to be born into the world for ' 
the cosmos to be his body. 
c. The Memory of the Initial Evil 
The Brahma'(ta of a Hundred Paths tells of Prajapati, who was alone in 
the beginning. "He desired, 'May I exist, may I reproduce myself!' "6 
He did tapas; he practiced austerities (SB .6. 1 .3. 1 ). His son would not 
be a child of uncontrolled passion, such as had seized the Father in 
the beginning of things, according to the raudra brahman. On the con­
trary, Prajapati practiced tapas, a technique of concentrating the heat 
of the body, the vital energy, in ardent meditation, so that its full in­
tensity becomes available for any extraordinary endeavor. It is a tech-

nique of asceticism or yoga like that of the ascent or retention of se­

of tapas is not directed toward emancipation only, but also seeks ful­
fillment of other aims, particularly and only seemingly paradoxically 
procreation. Prajapati as the householder, with UĠas (Dawn) as his 
wife, held a sacrificial session for a year. The Lord of Generation shed 
seed in Uးas. In a year, a boy (Kumara) was born; he cried (SB .6. 1 .3.7-
8). 
A human, homely atmosphere has spread over the primal scene, 
that violent rape of Dawn, the Father's daughter. Instead, PraJapati is 
here the master of the house. He and Dawn are a couple established 
in their home, the world. In due course, their child is born. No one 
interferes with its begetting. The traumatic, portentous incident at 
the critical moment of the intercourse with Dawn seems forgotten. 
But the infant cries as soon as he is born. This does not seem surpris-c/ 
ing in the humanized setting of the story of the birth of a god. How­
ever, it worries the boy's father, the Lord of Generation. The mother 
apparently takes no interest in her child. The god, a newborn child, 
cries and demands to be named (SB .6. 1 .3.9). 
Newborn in his shape as Cosmic Archer, he voices the identical de­
mand. In either shape he persists in demanding name after name, 
eight names in all. Only then is he satisfied. The newborn god is 
equally clamorous in either of his shapes and he is satisfied when he 
receives his eighth name. The infant stops crying, and the Cosmic 
Archer who had aimed at his father releases his hold of Prajapati 
when he has received his last name (KB.6.2-g). However, the insist­
ence of the newborn god is prompted by an entirely different reason 
in each of his two shapes. 
As Purua or Cosmic Man, the god is born at a sacrificial session and 
out of a golden bowl held by PraJapati. Arisen, the overpowering fig­
ure grasps the father and demands to be given a name, saying, "for 
without a name assigned, I shall not eat food here" (KB .6.2) in this 
world.7 Bhava, Existence, was the first name given to him by his father 
(KB.6.2). 
With unforeseen suddenness, the theophany of the Cosmic Archer 
rising from a golden bowl of an arrow's flight's proportions, aims at 
Pr<uapati, although in a forethought Prajapati had collected the

sperm of fire and wind, of sun and moon, his sons whom he had just 
then created. Prajapati of the Satapatha BriihmafUJ, however, was alone 
in the beginning. There was nothing else. He created the earth and 
the seasons. Desire overcame him to be, to know himself, to procreate 
and see the living proof of his existence. Subsequently, a boy was born 
to him and to UĠas, the Dawn. The child cried; indeed, he wept. Con­
cerned, Prajapati asked the child the reason for his crying. The boy 
replied that he cried because he was not freed from evil, for no name 
had been given him. "Give me a name." The newborn god knew why 
he cried and demanded to be named. He knew what evil he wanted to 
be freed from. Many names had to be summoned to free him from 
the primordial evil when Dawn fled from its scene. The powers that 
were in him from the beginning had to be evoked at his birth and con­
firmed by their names. Being called by their names, they guarded him 
with his own power. Their presence in him accounted for his demand 
for name after name. The child remembered his past. It lived in his 
memory. By his memory the newborn god established his identity. 
Unlike his birth as Cosmic Archer, he bore no visible cognizance. 
In both his shapes, as Cosmic Archer and as infant, the newborn 
god, son of Prajapati, remembers the past. As Cosmic Archer, his 
shape proclaims it a hundredfold. In each of these shapes he de­
mands his names eight times, eight names. His father, the Lord of 
Generation, then names the newborn god: "You are Rudra." "And 
because he gave him that name, Agni became such like . . .  , for Rudra 
is Agni" (SB .6. 1 .3 . 1 0).8 The Satapatha BriihmalJa furthermore explains 
by popular etymology that Rudra is so called because he cried (rud; 
SB .6. 1 .3. 1O; cf. TS. 1 .5. 1 . 1). The Wild God is now the crying, weeping 
god. But the newborn god is not satisfied; he knows himself to be 
mightier even than that name. He asks for one more name, and when 
that is given to him he wants yet another, and is not satisfied until he 
has received altogether eight names (SB.6. 1 .3. 10- 1 8). The enormity 
of the primordial evil is greater than the power inherent in any one 
of the eight names. Only in their eightfold totality are they commen­
surate with the primordial evil. Only after receiving all eight does the 
newborn god ask his father for no other name (SB .6. 1 .3. 17; ViiP .27·5-
16).9

When the Father gives his son his first name, his identity at once 
reveals itself. He is Rudra-Agni, the Wild God, the fire of creation. 
This is not the first time that the Lord of Generation gave name and 
statuS to the god as yet nameless-or whose name should not be ut­
tered. Pasupati, Lord of Animals, was the name the Father had given, 
in fear, to the archer so that the hunter might spare him. But now 
Prajapati gives a name, not to an unknown, threatening, archer but to 
his own child, knowing in his heart that the newborn god and the 
hunter are one in essence. Not satisfied with one name only, Rudra 
asks for more names. Name by name they are promptly given, one 
after the other as the child goes on asking for them: Sarva, Pasupati, 
Vgra, Asani, Bhava, Mahadeva, and Isana, eight in all, including 
Rudra (SB .6. 1.3. 10-17). 
Prajapati was preoccupied with the primordial drama when the 
name Sarva, the thrower of the arrow, came to his lips; the name Pa­
supati came next. Formidable are these names. The next name, Ugra, 
the Ferocious, conveys their terror. It strikes like lightning (aSani), 
which is another name given to the child; lightning is the manifesta­
tion of fire in mid-air. These are names of dread and fire. Bhava, 
however, connotes Existence. Mahadeva is the Great God, and isana 
the Lord or Ruler. "These are the eight names of Agni-Rudra. Ku­
mara (the boy) is the ninth" (SB .6. 1 .3. 1 8; KB .6.2-9).10 The "boy" (Ku­
mara) is the newborn god. The numbers eight and nine have secret 
significance. Assuming the eight names, the boy is the ninth, the new. 
He is never seen as a mere boy; he is seen in those forms that he has 
entered one by one (SB .6. 1 .3.19). "The great god of eight names" 
(KB .6,9) shows his fierce might in his name Ugra. Elsewhere, instead 
of Asani "lightning," he is called Bhima, the Frightful (HGS .2.8.6-7). 
It was a Vratya wandering about who, in his illumination, saw this 
entire world extended toward the four directions and pervaded by his 
god: Rudra in the center, Bhava, Sarva, Pasupati, and Ugra in the 
four directions, Mahadeva above and Isana in every direction. The 
eighth name of his god is the Sole Vratya of the Atharva Veda, a trans­
figuration of the visionary Vratya. All the eight names are invoked in 
the Yajur Veda (VS ,39.8) and receive their offeringsY 
_ 10 In the Kaȩ'taki Briihma¯, the order of the names given by Prajiipati is Bhava, 
Sarva, Pasupati, Ugra. Mahiideva, Rudra, iSiina, Asani (KB.6.2-9)'

Only Rudra and Pasupati are mythic names. Bhava signifies exist:i 
ence itself, and he is the ruler and Lord, Isana (RV.2.33.9); he is the) 
Great God, Mahadeva. In cosmic greatness the newborn god received 
his ancient names from his father Prajapati. They were chosen by: 
Prajapati as they had been chosen before, from many others to whom. 
homage is paid, in the Satarudriya, the hymn of Rudra a hundredfold,. 
though even in this laud not all the names are invoked under which 
the god had then been known. Thus he is called in the lJ.g Veda, 
(RV.6-4g. 1O) Father of the world or Father of living beings. Though: 
this name was not, could not have been, among those that readiW 
came to Prajapati's mind, its meaning was in abeyance and waited to' 
raise its head in the ongoing myth of the newborn god. 
Uttering name after name, Prajapati assigned to each a domain{ 
The domain was neither territorial nor situated in any specific direcM 
tion, as were the stations of the archers in the cosmic pyramid of the' 
Sole Vratya. The domains were qualitative and elemental, ingrained 
in the substance of the cosmos, its order, and man's consciousness of 
it. The newborn god did not stop crying until he had received hi$ 
eighth name. He knew that he needed each name, together with the' 
reality or domain that Prajapati was going to give to him. 
d. The Investiture with the Cosmos 
The eight domains are those of the Vasus, the eight component pow္ 
ers of the Universe. These ancient gods dwell each in his sphere, and 
are one with it in name; from them develops the physical world. Their; 
ogdoad is invoked in the lJ-g Veda (RV.2.3 1 . 1 ;  3.8.8; 6.62.8; 10.48. 11; 
10. 1 25. 1 ;  1 0. 1 28.g). It consists of the pentad of the five elements. 
They are earth, the support of all creatures; fire that warms, illu-, 
mines, and destroys them; water, purifying and fertilizing; air that 
breathes through the universe; and ether or space that pervades them. 
all. To the pentad of existence constituted by the elements are added 
sun and moon, by whose light time is measured in hot glow and cold 
sheen. Together with the five elements, they form the heptad of ex­
istence. To this heptad are added the stars to form the ogdoad of the 
eight domains or realities of the manifest cosmos (cf. SB . 1 1 .6.3.6; 
BrUp·3·9·3; MBh.l .60. 1 7). Prajapati assigns fire, water, plants, air, 
lightning, rain, moon, and sun to Rudra as his domains (SB .6. 1 .3.10-
1 7), adumbrating, as does RĠi Tal).Qi in his hymn in the Mahiibhiirata 
(MBh. 13.16.35, 54), the eight concrete realities (G.$tamurti) with which 

B I RT H  FROM P RAj A pATI • 1 09 
rrajapati endowed his son. The Purii1Jas name them clearly. They de­
scribe the newborn child as it sat crying-glowing red and deep blue 
(nila-lohita) through both the sectors of the spectrum-on the lap of 
its father (ViiP.27·3-5; PP·5.3· 1 8g-go). To this crying child his 
father-whom the Pura1Jas know as Brahma-assigns his eight do­
mains.12 They are those of the ogdoad of the Vasus: the pentad of the 
elements and the dyad of sun and moon (ViiP.27. 1 7-19). However, 
the eighth domain with which Prajapati endows his son is not that of 
the far-away luminaries; their place within the body of the eight real­
ities, the ٩tamurti, is ceded to man, the sacrificer or initiated brah­
mana!; (ViiP.27· 19),13 who is an embodiment of mind. "Mind is the 
form of the Sacrificer" (SB . 1 2.8.2.4).14 Mind embodied in man, 
among the domains of Rudra, takes the place of the stars among the 
Vasus. Mind first came into existence when life stirred in the dark 
void of the primeval flood (RV. 1O. 1 2g.4). In the eightfold cosmos of 
Rudra, his eighth domain, mind, is within man, the microcosm. 
But not only man as mind, but also everyman is Rudra's domain 
(LP.2. 1 3.20), for man the microcosm is homologous with the cos်s. 
Not only does the eye see with the light of the sun and the glow that 
is Rudra (ViiP .27-40; LP .2. 1 3.24-25), but each of the different facul­
ties and functions of the living being represents one of the eight 
forms of the god. For instance, the vital energies ( prii1Ja) are the do­
main of Isana (ViiP.27.43); Pasupati's domain is in the digestive fire 
(44). Rudra dwells in the functioning of the total psycho-physical 
body of man; as Mahadeva he lives in man's immortal being and he 
comes into existence anew, again and again. 
The newborn god, having received his names and stations, makes 
no further demand on Prajapati. He is freed from the evil whose 
memory had made him cry. The evil of that first morning of the pri­
mordial aeon is now allayed. Now Kumara the "boy" starts out into 
his new world. He is the "ninth," "the New," in and as each of the 
eight realities of the cosmos and of man, the microcosm. Rudra had 
to be born to end the memory of the primordial evil. It persisted until, 
name by name and reality upon reality, the evil was eradicated from 
his memory. Now a new world under the dispensation of Rudra be-

gins. It is permeated by Rudra in each of its eight realities. This sacred 
ogdoad comprises the pentad of the elements and of the senses that 
perceive them and the dyad of the controlling agents, sun and moon, 
the measurers of time. These luminaries act at the same time as sym­
bols of the hot and the cold and of currents caused by them. Mind or 
consciousness of the initiated completes the triad of the elements and 
luminaries, as also the ogdoad. The newborn god is all of them in one. 
The memory of the primordial evil is not allayed until the last name, 
Mahadeva, the Great God, is given to the child. The Great God en­
tered into his domains as Atamurti, God in the cosmos and in man 
(cf. LP· 1 .4 1.35-36; cf. DStotra 9). 
The dialogue of Prajapati with his demanding newborn son, dark 
blue and red in color, is a rite of expiation devised by the newborn 
god and performed by Prajapati. It was Rudra's memory of the pri­
mordial evil that prompted the dialogue. 
In the ongoing myth of Rudra/Siva, events unfold across the aeons. 
Similarly, many hundreds of years may lie between different versions 
of one particular myth, or between the narrative and its related visual 
image. Among the most perfect works of Indian art are the images of 
Siva dancing. The image of Siva N ataraja, the king of the dance, cast, 
in bronze or carved in stone is a visual embodiment of Siva Atamurti,< 
or the eight realities.15 In images of this and other modes of Siva's: 
dance, South Indian sculptures from the eighth century onward show 
the figure of the dancing god with his gyrating body standing on the 
prostrate shape of an infant with a snake in its hand.16 The name of 
the prostrate shape is Apasmara Purua, and it is generally taken to · 
be a demon and a symbol of ignorance. I 7 However, its name says that. 
the infant shape is that of "a being without memory." Its lusciously.' 
modeled flesh, neither plagued nor activated by memory, is pinned; 
down by the foot of the dancing lord. The chubby babe Forgetfulness 
offers the greatest contrast to the newborn child of Prajapati. That 
child cried for its name in order to be freed from evil that it remern,,: 
bered so well. Because the newborn god remembered the primordiat: 
evil, that memory kept the ancient evil in abeyance as the infant de-

rnanded its names and received them from Prajapati. The world of 
Rudra / Siva began young and anew. But for the pained memory of 
the newborn god, no demands would have been made and no re­
sponse elicited; the world of Siva would not have come to be for Siva 
Astamiirti to dance in the cosmos and in the heart of man. 
The Wild God, guardian of the Un create and avenger of its viola­
tion, had to fail in preventing the violation so as to allow the seed to 
fall that he as Agni had prepared. The fire seed of creation deposited 
in the Father held the mystery of its origin and that of its descent. 
Rudra-Agni, the bearer of the seed, was to be born from that seed, 
rnetaphysically his own self and son, mythically the son of the Lord of 
Generation, Prajapati. The newborn god wrested from Prajapati his 
recognition and confirmation as ruler, Isana, and as Mahadeva, the 
Great God in his domain, the universe and man, in which he is em­
bodied. And he is known as the eight-formed Lord who is identical 
with all the worlds (LP.2. 13.29). The world is suffused with his pres­
ence, which is encountered wheresoever, in whomsoever. The Sata­
rudriya, the hundredfold laud of the Lord, knows where to find him; 
the Linga Puratla, dating from nearly two thousand years later, knows 
how to show that he has been found. Giving help to everyone and 
showing kindness to all is called the highest worship of the Lord of 
eight forms (LP.2. 1 3'3S-36). 
2. THE BIRTH FROM BRAHMA 
a. Preparations for Rudra's Birth 
The world of Rudra has come to exist. It will run its course, and, in 
the end, it will be consumed by Rudra, who is Agni, Fire, the sole wit­
ness of the dissolution of this cosmos. His eight realities constitute the 
substance of the cosmos and of man, the microcosm. The two are ho­
mologous, and they also interact, for man represents and compre­
hends them. As such, he himself is the eighth reality, namely, mind 
(manas). Man, here, is the initiate, the mental exemplar in the universe 
of Agamiirti, the scheme of things to be. In the context of Siva's 
myth, however, man has not yet been created in the flesh. To bring 
about man in his physical concrete existence as human being will be 
the task assigned to Rudra-Siva by his father, the Lord of Generation, 
who is known in the Puratlas as Brahma, the Creator. He will create 
the aeon where the noumenal universe that is Rudra's body will come 

1 1 2 
• B I RT H  O F  R U D RA 
to life in all its parts, and its ingredients will combine in sentient crea­
tures born to live and to die. 
The Father who shed the seed, Prajapati, and Brahma, successively 
in the ongoing narrative of sacred tradition, play the role of the Cre­
ator. They are identical in essence, though mythically differentiated 
from the lJ.g Veda to the Puril1:ws. They are assigned to different 
aeons. 
Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, felt alone. When a son was born 
to him, the relation of Rudra to the Father at the dawn of a former 
aeon was redeemed as soon as Prajapati, at the newborn god's de­
mand, invested the crying child with the constituents of the cosmos as 
they would exist in the universe and in man. Out of his own loneli­
ness, before his son was born, Prajapati gave to Rudra the double as­
surance of his existence in the universe and in man. In the world of 
Rudra man would not be alone. He would live with the cosmos, shar­
ing the eightfold reality of Mahadeva, the Great God, Isana, the Lord. 
The cycle of the fire seed of creation had fulfilled itself in the birth of 
Mahadeva, the Great God, born of Prajapati. When this aeon passes 
into the night of cosmic dissolution, another aeon will arise when 
Rudra will be born again from the Creator, whose name will now be 
Brahma. 
Man himself had not as yet come to exist, and after a long sleep 
Brahma awoke in a new aeon (kalpa) (LP. 1 .4 1 .37-38). The past aeon 
in which Rudra was born of Prajapati saw the Great God indwelling 
in the cosmos, throughout existence, and in the consciousness of man. 
That aeon with its universe was ideational. It adumbrated the fore­
cast; it provided the setting of a world where man would live and die. 
As yet man had not been born in the flesh. He existed only as the ve­
hicle of mind. He was the consciousness in creation, himself as yet not 
created. Though this aeon had passed, its framework would emerge 
at the end of the cosmic night, and the world of Aramiirti would b¢ 
filled with human beings destined to live and to die. But in between 
these two aeons night brooded over the waters of the cosmic flood in. 
the darkness of dissolution. "This (universe) existed in the shape of 
Darkness, unperceived, destitute of distinctive marks, unattainable by 
reasoning, unknowable, wholly immersed, as it were, in deep sleep" 
(M. l .S).18 Brahma, the creator, meditated on the principles of things·

to-be evolving out of prematter (prakrti) (cf. VP . 1 .5.3-4), and there ap­
peared to him delusion covered with darkness (tamas) in which the 
real form of things remained unknown, in which next to darkness ap­
peared illusion, great confusion, anger, and blindness (SP .7. 1 . 1 2. 1-2 ;  
cf. VP . 1 .5.3-6; BhP.3. 1 2.2). Brahma was not pleased with this creation 
of his (BhP.3. 1 2.3). In his desire to create living beings who them­
selves would procreate, he exerted himself and created couples who 
could mate and produce offspring only once, at the end of life.19 But 
this he deemed unsatisfactory, and he created a quantity of living 
creatures, so many that the three worlds were crowded, without room 
to breathe (MBh. 1 2.284. 1 3- 1 4). It was a catastrophe. Again he prac­
ticed tapas. He exerted himself, and from his mind four or seven or 
more sons were born to him (SP.7. 1 . 1 2. 1g-20; VaP.g. 1 8- 1g; MP.3'5-
8; KUP . 1 . 1 0. 1 2- 1 3; BhP.3. 1 2.3-4). However, they were disinterested 
in the course of the world; they had achieved mastery over their 
senses, they were free from desire, they were yogis and munis, who 
had silenced their roving minds. They did not produce progeny. 
Through yoga power they held their seminal energy upward, since 
Release was their ultimate aim (BhP'3. 1 2.4-5; SP.7. 1 . 1 2.20-2 1 ). 
Brahma's purpose was not served by them (MP.4.26-27). He exerted 
himself once more, and once more his progeny were mind-born sages 
(VliP.g.67-69). Something was going counter to Brahma's intention. 
First, the dar.k night of dissolution seemed to be clinging to his mind, 
the anguish of creation smothered its drive; Brahma was critical and 
self-destructive. Brahma, the creator of this new aeon, reacted to his 
frustration altogether differently from the Father, who, at the begin­
ning of things, almost demented by physical frustration, lost his bear­
ing. Aeons separate the Creator, the Father, from Brahma. Having 
passed through the dark night of gestation prior to their birth, his 
mind-born sons, when born, failed Brahma in his purpose to people 
the world. Being yogis of undeviating self-control, and born from his 
mind, they were embodied reactions to the primordial loss of control 
of the Father. They acted against the incontinence of the Father in 
that distant past that had slumbered uneasily in Brahma's mind 
Whence they were born. It is said that on finding them averse to the 
procreation of progeny, Brahma became despondent and desperate 
about the creation of living beings. He exerted himself in most severe

austerities; his mind concentrated on the creation of mankind. Noth­
ing happened. He waited in grief and his grief turned to anger. He 
cried in anger. Goblins and ghosts come out of his tears. Brahma 
swore at himself when he saw the offspring of his tears (KiiP . 1 . 10. 15-
2 1 ;  SP.7. 1 . 1 2 . 1 g-24). 
b. Rudra Issues from the Head of Brahmii 
In utter distress, Brahma breathed his last. And from his mouth 
Rudra came forth; the breath of life itself, glorious as a thousand sun& 
and blazing like the doomsday fire (KiiP. 1 .  1 0.2 1-2 2 ;  LP· 1 .41 ,42-43). 
Rudra then imparted the vital breaths to Brahma, and brought him 
back to life (SP.7. 1 . 1 2.3 1-32). According to another version, Rudra 
sprang from the forehead of Brahma, darkened with rage (BhP. 
3 . 1 2.6-10). The Mahiibhiirata lists the eleven mind-born sons of 
Rudra, here called SthaI:Iu, with the six mind-born sons of Brahma': 
(MBh. 1 .60. 1 -4)· 
Rudra, the avenger, at the dawn of creation was born into creation 
from Brahma's wrath, from the middle of his forehead, where the: 
world of the senses and the intellect meet. Or he left the body of: 
Brahma by his mouth as his life breath, as the breath itself of life 
(KiiP. 1 . 1O.22). Or "Brahma created Rudra, born of his irate self. . . .  
From his wrath a being was born with the effulgence of the sun'{ 
( ViiP.9.70,75; KiiP. 1 .2.5-6; cf. VrP.2.48-49; cf. BhP.3. 1 2.7). Radiant,; 
glorious Rudra, the breath itself of life (cf. BrUp.3.9.4), light of the 
sun and fire of doomsday, was born of Brahma's anger. Anger had 
rankled in the Creator over the aeons from the beginning, when 
Rudra had aimed his arrow against the Father, against Prajapati, the 
Lord of Generation. When the Creator in this present aeon sends into­
the world his mind-born sons, ascetics withdrawn from the world, he; 
is no longer the Lord of Generation. 
He also is no longer the Father, but is henceforth called Pitamahaူ

solute, the undefinable plenum, the Uncreate. As such his mind-born 
sons are in direct descent from the Uncreate, Rudra being his last son: 
At the same time, however, Brahma the Creator as well as Prajapati 
are but successive forms of the Father, whose wrath or anger-the 
Father foamed like a bull when his intercourse was interrupted (cf, 
RV. lo.61.8)-finally triggers in Brahma the creation of Rudra, 

B I RT H  FROM B R A H M A • 1 1 5 
Rudra, son of Brahma, is born from Brahma's wrath in this aeon, as 
he was born from that of Prajapati before, when in the shape of 
Manyu he did not abandon the Lord of Generation. "Wrath (Manyu) 
was born instantly as a blue-red boy from between the brows of Praja­
pati" (BhP·3· 1 2·7)· 
Rudra is born from Brahma's wrath, breath, and thought. He is 
born as the breath of life. When born from Prajapati in a former 
aeon, he was a crying child or also Cosmic Man in his hunger, and he 
became the cosmos. Born from Brahma, he is mind-born. The seed 
that he had prepared for the Father had become himself, the son of 
Prajapati. Prajapati freed his newborn child from evil; he also stilled 
his hunger, and the newborn god of eight names and stations became 
AHamurti, the cosmos. 
Now Rudra enters a new aeon, born not from the seed but from the 
mind of the Creator. He is born from the head of Brahma-mind­
born, as were the other ascetic sons of Brahma. Or he issues from the 
mouth of Brahmii as the breath of life itself in its fire and radiance. 
According to one ancient myth, it was from the mouth of the Creator, 
Prajiipati, who alone existed in the beginning and considered how to 
reproduce himself, that Agni, Fire, was generated (SB .2.2.4. 1). Rudra 
is Agni, Fire. As priir;.a, the life breath, he is the fire, the vitality of life 
itself. Rudra, the fire-seed of creation, son of PraJapati, is Rudra, the 
breath of life, issued from Brahmii the creator. 
But another myth relates how Rudra was born from a drop of 
Brahnii's blood. It oozed from Brahmii's forehead when he wiped 
away the sweat as he sacrificed into the fire caused by his self-glory. 
The drop of blood became Nlla-Lohita Rudra, the dark blue-red god 
(SkP·S· l.2.24-26). Carnal though not sexual, this birth of Rudra is also 
from the forehead of the Creator. The blood magic of nila-lohita is 
reincarnated in this birth story. 
Q/ 
The shock of Rudra's primordial shot stayed with the Creator. 
When Rudra released his arrow against the Father, he projected him­
self into this target. The avenger injected his wrath into his aim. The 
Father broke out in rage. All the gods abandoned Prajapati when he 
had spent himself into creation. Only god Manyu (Wrath) stayed with 
him and became his son, Archer and Cosmic Man (Puru˹a) in one. 
When Brahmii, the Creator, labored in the agony of creation, anger 
seized him. The sons that in the end were born from his mind were 
all ascetics. Finally from his wrath Rudra, the Great Yogi, appeared, 

1 1 6 • B I RT H  OF R U D RA 
the breath itself of life. In the primordial scene Rudra the yogi had 
assumed the appearance of an archer. He was the guardian of hith­
erto unspent metacosmic integrity. Avenging the dissemination of its 
substance by the Creator, the full impact of the ascetic god hit Praja­
patio It occupied the mind of Brahma, the Creator, and from it was 
born Rudra. 
Leaving the head of Brahma, Rudra entered the world as an ascetic 
or an androgyne (Ch. VIII) so as paradoxically to carry out Brahma's 
desire for progeny, his desire for the creation of mankind. 

VI 
THE REFUSAL TO PROCREATE 
AND THE 
ENCOUNTERS WITH DEATH 
1 .  STHAϦU, THE PILLAR 
As soon as he was born, Rudra cried violently, and Brahma-as Praja­
pati had done-gave him his names and stations (KiiP. l. IO.23-27; 
BhP.3. 1 2.8- 1 2). The investiture of the newborn god had become a 
rite. It had been first performed by Prajapati (Ch. V. l.d). With its 
completion, all was within the great Lord, all that he had desired. 
Then he gave up all desire. Mahesvara, God of Gods, renounced the 
wo:-Id. His mind fixed on the ultimate real, he drank deep of this su­
preme nectar, the uncreate and undecaying brahman (KiiP . 1 . 1 0.30-
31). He was absorbed in contem plation when Brahma ordered him to 
create progeny. 
Brahma, following his own unsuccessful attempts, insisted that 
Rudra create living creatures, that he bring mankind into being 
(BhP .3. 1 2. 14; d. VrP .2 1 .6) and beget children (VaP . 10.43). ဳudra re­
sponded to Brahma's command in a manner conformingဴvith his 
ascetic primordial nature. He followed the example · of the earlier 
mind-born sons of Brahma in that he would not procreate. Yet he also 
followed the example of Brahma: he created from his own self mind­
born sons, Rudras, equal to himself (BhP.3. 1 2. 1 5; VliP . IO'44-45; 
KuP. 1 .  10.32). He next discharged from his body lightning, thunder, 
and the meters (MP +29).' But this did not further Brahma's pur-

MP·4·'.l7 ff). 

1 1 8 ' R E F U S A L  TO PROCREATE 
pose: the creation of mortals to populate the earth. Brahma's plan was 
doubly contrary to Rudra's nature: he is the prototypal ascetic, and 
would not think of carnal progeny. He is also Siva, the compassionate 
god, who wants to prevent the imperfections and suffering of the hu­
man condition. The world thus was at a standstill. 
The mind-born sons of Rudra, the Rudras, are not all ascetics or 
sages, yet they acted as unlimited editions of possibilities and ara­
besques of Rudra's multiple nature. Not all were Nlla-Lohitas, dark 
and red. They were as multicolored as they were multiform (Vap. 
10.44-54). Rudra's mental issue resembled but was unlike the innu­
merable thousands of Rudras of the Satarudriya hymn (VS . 16.54-66). 
The Rudras of the Satarudriya litany were reverberations of the 
presence of Rudra; the Rudras of the Pura1J,as were his self-begotten 
sons, who were discharged from his mind by the Great Yogi before 
he stood in stillness. 
The Rudras vibrate the universe and man with Rudra's breath. 
They leap into man's awareness out of his food, in the street, in the 
wood, at any place, and at any time, in the wealth and elation of the 
Satarudriya hymn. They are turbulent and disturbing, invisible and 
full of energy (LP . 1 .70.3 1 2- 1 3), free from attachment, riders on large 
bulls (KiiP . 1 . 10.33-34). Some are hunch-backed, some are dwarfs and 
crooked (MP. 1 83.64). Or they are 840 million celestials called Sa­
dhyas, three-eyed and without fear of getting old (MP-4-30). They are 
yogis, teachers, students. Some emit smoke and blaze; some have 
eight curved fangs, two tongues, and three eyes. Some have thou­
sands of eyes, some are merciful and patient. They meditate, hold 
skulls, rush and leap everywhere between heaven and earth. Fully 
armed, they roam about and their mere glance may kill (LP . 1 .70.305-
1 3). Yet, on the whole, their multitudes are more human, less elemen­
tal than those of the Rudras of the great litany; they are, though less 
spectacular, less irresistible and more compassionate, akin to those 
companions of Rudra whom Asvatthaman saw in the uncertain light, 
blazing from the guardian of the camp of the PaI)Qavas and whom 
Rudra looked upon as his legitimate sons (MBh. 1O.7.41-42). When 
Rudra-Siva bade them work for the welfare of the world, they cried 
and ran about; the world is pervaded by them and they are devoted 
to all beings (VaP.g.77-81 ). Rudra's mind-born sons, unlike Brahma's, 
did not all monotonously withdraw from the world. On the contrary, 
they activate the movement in creation. They are the breath (pra1J,a) 

S T H A ݨu ,  T H E  P I L L A R · 1 1 9 
of life (LP . 1 .22.24; SP.7. 1 . 1 2.25-30) in all beings, for Rudra is the or­
igin of that breath (MBh.7. 173.92-93). At Mahadeva's command, the 
Rudras are to be worshiped together with the other gods (VliP.lO.58-
61 ; BP . 1 .2.g.82-86). They are the indomitable, deathless stirrings and 
vibrations of creation, unformed, misformed, correct, and overstated 
until-worshiped with the other gods-they find their norm and 
form. Rudra discharged from his being these animating, vivifying 
powers and withdrew into his core of stillness. 
When Brahma saw the Rudras, he warned Rudra, "Do not create 
such people, exempt from death; create others who are bound by 
birth and death" (KiiP . 1 . lO.36; cf. BP . 1.2.9.79-80). He should "create 
only such beings as would reap the fruit of their own karmas" 
(MP.4.3 1-32).2 But Rudra remonstrated that he would not create off­
spring subject to death and old age. He firmly stated his position: "I 
am standing by. You create people" (VliP.lO.56-57; LP.1 .70'316). 
Thereafter Rudra did not procreate (VliP. lO.63; LP. 1 .70.323). 
"Keeping the semen drawn up, Sthaʎu stood still until the great del­
uge. Because he said: 'Here I stand (sthito'smi),' he is known as Sthaʎu 
(one who stands)" (VliP.lO.64; BP. 1 .2.g.8g; cf. MP.4.32 ; cf. 
KiiP. 1 . 10·38; LP. 1 .70'323-24; cf. SkP.7.2.9. q; SP.7. 1 . 1 4. Q-2 1).3 
Rudra became Sthaʎu, a motionless pillar, a branchless stem. He 
stood in aeviternal illumination. 
Sthaʎu·(from the rootsthli, "to stand"), "a post," is Rudra's concrete 
symbol. Its upward direction shows his inflexible stance across the 
universe (cf. LP. 1 .86.1 39), as well as suggesting the upward with­
drawal of his semen. The visual concept of Sthar.lU, the pillar, is the 
paradoxical negation of the erect phallus, which the pillar shape sug­
gests. This image is the monument in which the Lord of Yoga became 
Ltha.ʎu, or liriga-formed. But for its implied meaning, this the3Phany 
IS without any visual anthropomorphic trait. The whole of ascetic 
Rudra's being is within its pillar shape. If the pyramid of the Sole 
Vratya was built mentally in a vision, a monument of the inner reali­
ဵation of that god, the verticality of Sthaʎu is a presentation of Rudra­
Siva, the yogi. This abstract pillar shape stands firm by the tension of 
the implied procreative force, its mastery, and negation. 
The motionless pillar is Siva, the ascetic, in whom the fire of life 
burns upward inwardly while he stands still. This is the mystery of 
2 Matsya Pura1}a (MP) , tr. "A Taluqdar of Oudh," 19 16, part I ,  p. 15. 
3 Ibid., p. Isn. 

1 2 0 ' R E F U SAL TO PRO C REATE 
SthaI)u (cf. MBh. 1 7. I 73.92). He is motionless, like a log in which the 
potentiality of fire is latent (cf. SUP. 1 . I3) and controlled. SthaI)u is 
Siva the yogi, an aeviternal, immovable presence, pillar of the world. 
Rudra did not carry out Brahma's command. He did not create 
mortals, whose sorry lot he foresaw. He stood still as a pillar, his organ 
of procreation itself motionless and pointing upward as a sign of the 
semen drawn upward, contained, consumed or transubstantiated 
within the body. The erect phallus of the yogi signifies the opposite of 
what this position conveys naturally, yet the erection is the basis for 
the conversion of its meaning. 
"Since Rudra stands burning upward, and since he stands and ex­
ists as the origin of life, and since the linga is aeviternally erect, he is 
known as SthaI)u" (MBh.7. I 73.92). The Mahiibhiirata sees SthaI)u not 
in his immutability as master over sexual power but as the immutabil­
ity of that power itself-and as the origin of life. Rudra does not pro­
create at Brahma's behest, but stands still forever in the shape of the 
linga as SthaI)u, the pillar. SthaI)u in the simplicity of its shape is the 
monument of Rudra's paradoxical truth. Its dual significance com­
prises the irreducible nature of Rudra, the Fire, the origin oflife, and 
Rudra, the Great Yogi, who, counter to nature, is master of the un­
spent life-giving power. 
Before going into stasis, Rudra had created his mind-born sons, 
hosts of turbulent Rudras. Although unpredictable and frightening, 
the Rudras, these uncanny vital powers, are recognized; they are to 
be accepted and worshiped along with the other gods. They are the 
movement of breath itself ( prii1Ja), whose origin is Rudra. The crea­
tion and conversion of the Rudras is a prelude to and accompaniment 
of Rudra's stasis. In their restlessness they are SthaI)u's alter ego. He 
discharged them from his mind and made them his sons. 
The myth of Rudra-Siva unfolds from aeon to aeon. Each new cos­
mos repeats and carries further the fundamental themes. When 
Rudra becomes SthaI)u, his eight cosmic names are in abeyance. 
When Siva-Atamurti dances his cosmic dance, his bronze image as 
Nataraja, king of dancers, shows the gyration of his flexed limbs up­
held by the stasis of the central axis of the flux of his movement. The 
immortal, invisible Rudras circulate in its rhythm. 
The Rudras cried and ran about; they pervade this world and are 
devoted to it. But Brahma rejected these immortal sons of Rudra be­
cause they could not fulfill his purpose (BP . 1 .2.9.70-80). They were 

STH A N U ,  T H E  P I L L A R ' 1 2 1  
not themselves, nor would they propagate,. mortals. Then Rudra 
withdrew into himself. He became SthaQu, motionless in aeviternal sa­
miidhi, ceaseless illumination, contained within himself, his seed with­
drawn into himself (BP. 1.2.g.88-8g). In his pillar shape Rudra re­
stores the unspent wholeness of the Uncreate. His seed and his breath 
are held. The fire seed of creation and the breath of life are held 
within his motionless shape. No mortals will ever be created by Rudra, 
but such things as knowledge, truth, asceticism, and illumination are 
in him, and he is in the gods, sages, and all beings; he is honored by 
all the gods (BP . 1 .2.g.8g-g2). The gods are "this side of creation" 
(RV. I0. 1 2g.6). Rudra at the beginning of things acted as the guardian 
of the Uncreate, and became its pillar in the myth of creation. 
As the bearer of the fire-seed of creation, from before the begin­
ning of things, Rudra is his own counter player and the ultimate cause 
of his own birth. As SthaQu, standing withdrawn into the godhead, 
into himself, while Brahma wants to create mortals, he resumes his 
ambivalence without which creation could not have begun, and with­
out which death would become the end of everything. 
When Rudra was told to create mortals instead of the mind-born 
Rudras, he decreed that these noble and mighty beings would roam 
about in his company (SP.7. 1 . 14, 17-19; cf. KitP.l. I0.38). Yet he 
stands in yogic trance until the dissolution of the universe. While he 
desists from .creation and withdraws into himself, the Rudras play 
around the motionless SthaQu, who is the pillar of containment per­
vading the universe (cf. LP. 1 .70.320-24 ; LP. 1.86. 1 39). Having re­
fused to engender mortals and having ceased to create immortals, the 
Great God says of himself: "I stand as the destroyer. Because I stand 
like a pillar, so I am stha1J,u" (SkP.7.2.9. 13-14). His withdrawal from 
the world signals his destruction of the world. SthaQu, the pillar of 
containment, stands as a marker across the entire creation. On the un­
chartered road from before the beginning of time, when Rudra, the 
hunter, arose as the avenger of the Uncreate, SthaQu stands until the 
ံnd of the aeon (VaP. lo.64), when Siva will destroy the gpsmos, danc­
Ing it out of existence, the sole witness of its destruction (KitP. 1 . 1O.64-
65). ' 
SthaQu the ascetic rises into the empyrean between Rudra the 
avenger and Siva the destroyer. His motionless shape has only one 
direction, upward. The self-contained shape holds within itself the 
power of life and of withdrawal from it. Within himself SthaQu re-

122 
• R E F U SA L  TO P ROCREATE 
stores the unspent integrity that was before the beginning of things. 
Standing in creation here and now, he is beyond creation. At the end 
of the aeon Siva will destroy the cosmos, absorb it back into himself, 
into the undifferentiated darkness of cosmic night-a periodically re­
newed reflex of the Uncreate. 
In declaring his nature to Brahma, Siva established his shape as 
SthaJ:lu. Henceforward SthaJ:lu becomes a name of Rudra-Siva. In this 
name the Great God will act in his myth as the motionless pillar be­
yond time, and the cycles of time will move around him. 
2. THE CREATION OF DEATH AND THE CYCLES OF TIME 
SthaJ:lu withdrew from procreation, frustrating Brahma. But Brahma 
persisted in his creative urge. Having produced his few mind-born 
sons and SthaJ:lu, who had turned away from the task of procreation, 
Brahma now produced people. In fact, he was overwhelmed by the 
profusion of creatures he created. They crowded the three worlds. 
Their number kept increasing, for they did not die (MBh . 1 2.248. 13-
14). They were the very opposite of the innumerable and immortal 
Rudras, who were born deathless as the throbbing itself of life. The 
creatures of Brahma, however, were sent into the world as a popula;;. 
tion that as yet had not met death. Bewildered and angered by the 
uncontrollable profusion of creatures he had brought about, Brahma 
flared up and his wrath broke out of his body in a fiery fury. It set the 
universe ablaze, and all living beings were about to be annihilated, 
once and for all, in the holocaust. Then SthaJ:lu, the Pillar, addressed 
Brahma, asking him to show his grace by allowing the threefold uni­
verse, past, present, and future, to exist. Brahma also had appointed 
SthaJ:lu to preside over living beings, and now SthaJ:lu asked the cre­
ator for a boon. SthaJ:lu asked that living creatures might come back 
into the world for repeated births and repeated deaths. Then Brahma 
drew his own fiery energy back within himself and permitted the fire 
to abate. Brahma, in his infinite power, decreed that henceforth activ­
ity in the outer world ( pravrtti) would be followed by withdrawal 
(nivrtti) in ever-renewed cycles (MBh.7, app. 1 ,  no. 8, lines 69- 1 16). 
When Brahma had withdrawn the fire of his fury into himself and 
let it subside, he granted Siva's boon of repeated births and deathS. 
Then, from all the openings of his body, a maiden came out. She was 
dark and dressed in red (MBh.7, app. 1 ,  no. 8, lines 1 1 8-19). Her starl,(, 

C YC LES O F  T I M E , 1 2 3 
colors, black and red (krHIa and rakta), resembled those of Rudra's 
body (nila-lohita) (cf. BhP.3. 1 2.7). Brahma saluted her whom he had 
summoned in his anger to kill all creatures, fools and sages alike, 
namely, Death. The lotus-eyed young goddess in her sorrow began to 
weep as she implored Brahma to release her from this cruel task that 
seemed to her to go against cosmic order (dharma). She asked for his 
permission to practice severe austerities. Then she fell silent. Brahma 
acquiesced and let her go to practice the severest asceticism for mil­
lions and millions of years. Still she could not bring herself to obey 
Brahma. The great god then granted her another wish that was in her 
heart. He reassured her of the righteousness of her assignment, that 
it was free from inequity. She would be with all creatures and act im­
partially, impeccably. But she did not agree. Finally Brahma con­
vinced her that her task was necessary and inevitable, as it conformed 
with the world order. Shed in compassion, her tears were to become 
terrible diseases, and people would succumb to them and die at their 
appointed time. She would send desire and anger together, when the 
time came for the end of living creatures. This relentless insistence of 
Brahma made Death afraid that he would curse her and she agreed 
to destroy living creatures (MBh.7, app. I ,  no. 8, lines 1 20-249). It was 
not in the power of young, compassionate, and ascetic goddess Death 
to prevent the pain of the dying and that of the living at their death; 
and she assumed the cruel task of destroying all their bodies when 
their time would come. 
The death of the body is inevitable. Brahma had to compel Death 
herself to accept this stern truth. Without it Brahma could not have 
given the boon that Rudra had asked of him-the boon that living 
creatures may come back into the world for renewed births and re­
peated deaths. All human beings, at the time of death, go to the other 
world and then return (MBh. 12.250.38). 
Creation-destruction and then the pause before a new life begins 
on earth are ordained by Brahma, but they are willed by Rudra-Siva, 
the compassionate, who himself is beyond time, ϥ motionless pillar 
(Sthar:lU). Siva, throughout this myth of the introduction of recurrent 
deaths and renewed lives of man-and of the cosmos-acts as Sthanu. 
SthaQu or "pillar" signifies the timeless, motionless state of samiidhi

the condition of mortals wherein past, present, and future will now

sustain recurrent themes. The pause, the withdrawal from activity 
(nivrtti) in its quiescence, is a reflex, in and beyond creation, of the 
Uncreate that is before and above all times and things. 
The rupture of the Uncreate marked the beginning of the myth of) 
Rudra. The Creator himself caused the break. Prajapati let flow int0 
creation some of the precious substance of the plenum, the Uncreateଜ 
Rudra, the threatening archer and guardian of the Uncreate, ap, 
peared just at the moment when the shedding of the seed could no 
longer be prevented. The Gandharva Krsanu, the archer and guard .. 
ian of Soma, did no better. His arrow grazed the falcon who had 
stolen the Soma; it did not stop the bird from bringing the elixir of 
immortality to mortal man. The falcon lost a feather; it fell, a witnes!l 
to the failure of Krsanu, the archer. The speed of the flight of the 
falcon, the surging passion and flow of the seed of Prajapati, and the 
speed of the discharge of the arrow are embodiments of time that de­
fied the intention of the archers. Time at the inception of Prajapati1s 
creation was the antagonist of Rudra, the avenger. 
When Brahma's progeny increased out of bounds and he could not 
regulate its growth, a holocaust seemed the only remedy. The creator 
in his anger was about to burn his deathless progeny. Its incalculable 
increase had already overwhelmed the three worlds. Rudra, moved 
by pity for the victims of Brahma's unchecked productivity, directed 
the wrath of Brahma away from the scheme of destruction, and 
Brahma fulfilled the request of Rudra not to let the universe end in 
an irreparable cataclysm. Brahma consented to let life go on in living 
beings to the appointed time, when it would be withdrawn from 
them; and, after a pause, they would return in other bodies until their 
time came to leave this world. This movement would go on till dooms­
day, when the entire universe would be destroyed and lie in dark qui. 
escence until a new aeon would arise in the dawn of a new cosmoS. 
Rudra, the ineffective guardian of the Uncreate, acted as the protec­
tor of creation. He unraveled the proliferating mass of Brahmaଝs 
helpless progeny by letting the creatures move along the river of time, 
with its waves surging and subsiding and the lives of the people flow­
ing along through periods of activity and quiescence. 
In the beginning, creation came about when Rudra as guardian of 
the absolute was defeated by time. At that very moment, however, 
time cooperated with Rudra-Agni, who had prepared the seed that 
then was flowing into creation. Now, when Brahma was about to ere-

CYCLES O F  T I M E · 1 2 5 
ate-and destroy-mortals, different roles were assigned to the ac­
tors. The fire of destruction was subdued by Rudra, and time was 
given a saving dimension by Rudra. Not the flight but the flux of time 
would carry man through repeated deaths and renewed lives. It is this 
quality of time that Rudra gave to the world. To allow the renewal of 
life there must be death at the appointed time, the cyclical rhythm of 
Rudra's time. 
The pathos of dying, however, seized the young goddess Death, 
who joined Brahma and Rudra at the moment when the Creator ful­
filled Rudra's wish and was about to give effect to it. The dark im­
maculate maiden was tormented by the pain she would be forced to 
inflict on mortals. It seemed to her against the order of the cosmos 
that she should have stepped out into the world from all the openings 
of Brahma's sentient body to inflict the suffering of dying. Brahma, 
however, was adamant about death's cosmic necessity. Rudra, 
Brahma, and the young compassionate and blameless goddess finally 
cooperated in bringing death into the world. Rudra alloted to death 
its position in the order of cyclical time. Death would be the open gate 
through which the current of time would take its course. Brahma had 
to be relentless in his insistence on the necessity of death-he knew 
what the world had been without it. Rudra brought the cyclical se­
quence of time into the cosmos as a remedy; Brahma summoned 
Death from within himself to make the remedy effective, to keep in­
tact the order of the cosmos. But the existence of death required the 
process of dying and the goddess knew its agony. 
The time that Rudra brought into the world is a lived time, in­
wardly experienced. It came to be when Rudra was moved to pity by 
the imminence of total extinction. He arrested and distributed it so 
that it would alternate with life in recurrent rhythms. Rudra's time is 
a form of his compassion flowing through creation around SthaI).u's 
immobile shape. 
Among his diverse attempts to create human beings, Brahma here 
succeeded with the help of his ascetic son Stha.,u. Consistent in his 
stance while seemingly paradoxical in his actions-paradoxical him­
self 'already as a motionless pillar in action-SthaI).u caused the Crea­
tor to introduce the renewal of life for his creatures who had been 
unable to die. Rudra, who had refused to create mortals and thereby 
bring into the world failure and suffering, had created immortals ex­
empt from both. They were his mind-born sons, exuberant improv-

1 2 6 • R E F U SA L  TO PROCREATE 
isations, arabesques and transmogrifications of the human condition, 
reflected in the mind of Rudra and agitating a world of freedom. 
Brahma's progeny, on the other hand, trod the earth and exceeded 
the bounds of space and time. The earth was about to be overrun by 
their throng, and there was no limit to the continuation of such a pre­
dicament. The immortality of his crowd was a state of deprivation; 
mankind lacked death. Brahma started a holocaust and SthaI).u, the 
motionless, moved by pity, diverted the cataclysm. Contrary to his 
original intention, he cooperated with Brahma in making bearable the 
human condition. He did this by offering the prospect of an aeviter­
nal return in accordance with which each death would lead to another 
life. 
Time had been the antagonist of Rudra, who was at the very begin­
ning the hunter and avenger. But for this, the arrow of the hunter 
would have struck its target as soon as Rudra had noticed the Father's 
behavior. The union of Father and daughter would have been pre­
vented and no seed would have been shed. In another sense, time co­
operated with Agni-Rudra, who had prepared the seed-its purpose 
being to be shed-whereas time antagonized Rudra. Time interposed 
itself between the intention of the hunter and his target, and made 
the arrow hit the target at the most vulnerable moment so that some 
of the seed was spilled and fell down to the earth. Rudra, guardian of 
the Uncreate, partakes of its timelessness, but insofar as he played his 
part, time itself meted out his actions. Time carried his arrow at its 
own speed, as it did that of Krsanu. The guardians of the timeless 
Uncreate were overtaken by the delaying action of time. 
The transition from the Uncreate into creation, from timelessness 
into time is a danger zone. The wound that Rudra inflicted causes 
havoc among the gods-from aeon to aeon. 
But when Brahma was about to consume in a holocaust the cosmos 
he had created, the moment had come for Rudra to confront time 
and to infuse it with his being. 
Although time does not appear as a persona in the myth of the cre­
ation of death, its presence lurks in the urgency of the fire of total 
extinction born of Brahma's wrath. SthaI).u, the motionless pillar, 
moved, although quiescent, by pity for the creatures of Brahma 
threatened with total extinction, begs him to grant them renewed life 
and the activity arising out of and alternating with death and quies­
cence. For them time will not end with death: they will return after a 

R U D RA C A ST RATES H I M S E L F · 1 2 7 
period of quiescence in a new birth. Time will carry them through re­
peated births and deaths to the end of the aeon. Rudra's time is a 
form of the Great God's pity for all creatures. That pity for man is the 
vehicle by which Stha1J.u diffuses his quiescence into the structure of 
time. Time will not prolong the lives of men; it will not defer their 
death. It will bring them back again into a new youth and a life reso­
nant with their past. In time their life will be ready for death-and 
rebirth. Stha1J.u, out of the quiescence of his stance, prevailed on 
Brahma. Death and rebirth thenceforth came to be interwoven in the 
pattern of time, due to Stha1J.u's compassion for creatures. The para­
dox of the motionless ascetic withdrawn from the world yet moved by 
pity for its creatures is resolved by a form of time that carries quies­
cence in its structure. Stha1J.u will stand by while the perennial re­
newal of its pattern will cease only at doomsday. 
Stha1J.u in his concern for the life of creatures fulfills the hope ex­
pressed in the Mahiimrtyuiijaya mantra of Rudra Tryambaka, whose 
power is over life and death (RV.7.Sg. 1 2 ;  VS.3.60; SB.2.6.2. 1 4). 
Tryambaka liberates from death when he allows life not to be cut off 
by it. Stha1J.u gives death its place in the renewal of life, a trans per­
sonal life carrying the here and now in indefinite repetition to quies­
cence and a new beginning, until the Great God absorbs in his dance 
of annihilation the Imcounted rhythms he has released. 
3. RUDRA PLUNGES INTO THE WATERS AND CASTRATES 
HIMSELF 
Charged by Brahma to creatଞ living beings, Rudra created immortals 
of deathless vitality before he turned into a motionless pillar, self-con­
tained in stillness. According to another tradition, however, the Great 
Yogi carried out Brahma's command to create living beings by plung­
ing into the water and then by castrating himself when asked to pro­
duce creatures (MBh. 10. 1 7. 10-1 1 ,  2 1 ). Saying at first that he was un­
able to produce creatures, Rudra plunged intb the water (VrP.2 1 .6). 
He practiced tapas, austere in creative fervor, over a long time. Rudra, 
deeply immersed in the water, was absorbed in the task to which he 
had responded according to his yogic nature, believing that "one 
without fervent austerities is not able to create creatures" (VrP.2 1 .7). 
Full of expectation, Brahma waited all that time. Nothing happened, 
and Brahma turned to another being whose name was Dakia 

1 2 8 ' R E F U S A L  TO PROCRE ATE 
(KuP. 1. 15. 1 ;  VrP.2 I .g). Brahma made Dak\>a the creator of all living 
beings. Seeing Rudra immersed in the waters, Dakia, his substitute, 
created living creatures. As soon as they were born, they ran toward 
him. They were hungry and wanted to devour him. Dakia turned to 
Brahma to protect him and to assign food for the living creatures. 
Brahma gave them herbs and plants, and gave the weaker creatures 
as food for the stronger. Then the living beings ate and multiplied by 
mating with their own kind and moved around the world. Brahma 
was pleased (MBh. lo. 1 7. 1 2-20). He had every reason to be pleased. 
According to the 5atapatha Briihmarza, in the beginning Prajapati, de­
siring offspring, sacrificed. He was Dakia (5B.2-4-4. 1-2). Brahma, the 
Pural)ic version of Prajapati, in creating Dakia recreated himself. 
At last Rudra rose from the waters and saw the living creation. At 
the sight he became angry, tore out his phallus and caused it to fall 
into the ground, since no purpose would be served by it (MBh. 
10. 1 7.20-24). By his ardent exertion he had diffused his splendor into 
the waters, created the plants and healing herbs for all creatures. The 
plants would multiply like those whose food they were to be. Without 
them the living beings would have died. Cheerless and in rage, Rudra 
went to the foot of Mount M iijavat to practice asceticism 
(MBh. IO. 1 7·25-26). 
Rudra is Agni, Fire. He plunged into the waters where life was gen­
erated by his heat, by the fervor of his asceticism. The waters are 
Agni's resting place (MBh. 1 3.84.24), his secret refuge when he-like 
Rudra-is charged at the sacrifice with an onerous task to perform 
(RV. 10.5 I. 1).4 His flight from the sacrifice into the flowing waters is a 
withdrawal from action, a merging of himself in himself (cf. 
MBh. 13.84.24). Agni hides in the waters, but at other times he is seen, 
a shaft of light from on high speeding to the shiny plane and resting 
there, the pillar of heaven (RV.4. 13.5) glowing like the sun. It is the 
leg of the sun. With its one foot it steps out of the beyond. Thus its 
name is Aja Ekapad, the uncreate One-Foot (RV.2.3 1 .6; 6.50. 14; 
1 0.65. 13; cf. 1 .67.3; 1 . 164.6; 8.4 1 . 10; 1 0.82.6). The light from on 
high plunges into the waters-as Rudra did-and shines forth, vi­
brating from the body of Rudra in solar and lunar rays (cf. 
MBh.7. 1 73.66; cf. LP.2. 1 2.7-23). Agni and Aja Ekapad merge the im­
ages of their light with that of Rudra. Rudra, who is the very self of 
• Ȩg Veda Sal'flhitii (RV) .  tr. R.T.H. Griffith, 1973, p. 567. 

R U D RA CASTRATES H I M S E L F ' 1 2 9 
yoga, is often described in terms of effulgent light (MBh.13· 1 7  ·55, 65, 
80). Light is the progenitive power (TS .7. 1 .'1 . 1 ;  5B .8.7. 1 . 1 6).5 Bathed 
by the water, Rudra, the young ascetic, kindles the waters with his cre­
ative fervor (tapas), and life stirs in them. Plants grow from the con­
tact. The plants will be the food of living creatures moving about on 
earth. 
When Rudra entered the waters, he was like that great wondrous 
presence ( yak$a) that strode in creative fervor on the crest of the sea 
(AF. 1O.7.38). That mighty presence was a brahmaciirin, a consecrated 
celibate, as Rudra is, young and ardent. Absorbed in creative fervor, 
the brahmaciirin stood in the sea, in the ocean. He shone on the earth 
(AF. 1 1 .5.26). He glowed with utmost inner exertion, the heat of cre­
ation. 
Agni in the waters, Aja Ekapad, the uncreate One-Foot, and the 
young, chaste brahmaciirin are likenesses of Rudra. In the particular 
situation of Rudra's taking refuge in the waters, they are identical 
with him. Agni and the uncreate One-Foot are cosmic figures. The 
world of man, however, lends the human figure to the brahmaciirin, a 
student who fervently exerts himself in mastering, transmuting, and 
transcending the psycho-physical body. The brahmaciirin is seen trans­
figured into a numinous presence, ayak$a. 
Rudra had sprung from the wrath of the Creator, from the fury of 
his frustration; he was meant to create mortals who would propagate. 
A mind-born son of Brahma, he was like the others before him, who 
were sages by birth and had overcome the world as soon as they were 
born. Rudra, however, sprung from Brahma's angry mind, was also 
bid by Brahma to carry out a task in which Brahma had failed. 
Though he was Brahma's mind-born ascetic son, he accepted the'pa­
ternal mandate and created life, though not through procreation. He 
plunged into the water, where the plants derived their nourishment 
from his presence. They pass it on to man. Rudra is "the food of the 
living beings everywhere" (LP . 1 .86.92). 
Rudra tarried in the water, and once aga&\ time was against him, as 
it was when creation began and the Wild God let his arrow fly too late 
to prevent the emission of seed by the Father. Again, too late Rudra 
emerged from the water, only to see the population another had al­
ready created. 
• Cf. M. Eliade, "Spirit, Light and Seed," 197 1 ,  p. 3. 

1 3 0 '  R E F U SA L  TO PROC REATE 
In a rage, Rudra rid himself of his phallus, which sank into the 
ground. Rudra withdrew to the mountains to practice the most ar­
duous tapas. Self-castration out of the rage of disappointment was the 
sequel to the wound Rudra had inflicted on the Father. Rudra had 
intended to prevent creation by sexual intercourse in which the 
Father was engaged, but he had not succeeded. Now, charged by 
Brahma, his father, with the task of creating living beings who would 
propagate, Rudra compromised and created vegetation, the food of 
life. He did not people the world with living and moving creatures. 
Instead he rid himself in fury of his phallus that now had no purpose, 
whereas all the while that Rudra was in the water he, in his total being, 
was the life-giving cosmic phallic power of which the sun-pillar is the 
figure. 
Rudra is that brahmaciirin, the sun, the vital and vitalizing power in 
manifestation. The sun itself, however, is but a figure in front of the 
inexhaustible, unspent source in the beyond. It was the spending of 
this power that Rudra, the Wild God, avenged. He had acted as its 
guardian. Rudra, in agreeing to Brahma's command to create living 
beings, seemed to evade the task by his plunge into the water, whereas 
he did cooperate, though he circumvented the implied mode of exe­
cution. Rudra is an ascetic according to human standards. But human 
standards do not apply to the god, who acts in accordance with them 
merely in order to approach the understanding of man. Rudra is the 
ascetic who guards the Uncreate and avenges the flowing of its sub­
stance into creation. With the primordial shot of his arrow he inserts 
his fury and his asceticism into the Creator who, as Brahma, creates 
mind-born ascetic sons and, paradoxically, delegates the task of cre­
ating living beings to one of them, namely, Rudra. Brahma, injected 
with Rudra's ascetic nature, assumes the role of his ascetic son, yet dis­
regards the asceticism of Rudra, knowing that Rudra is Fire and had 
prepared the seed for the Father. Rudra submerged in the waters is 
the hidden light and fire by which the plants stir into life and become 
the sustenance of living beings. 
Everything alive is dependent on food; it is Rudra, who caused 
it to be (cf. LP . 1 .86.92-95). Rudra is the fire and the food of life; he is 
absorbed by and in all creatures. 
Emerging from the water and confronted with mankind whom he 
did not create, his anger flared up. He roared and flames shot forth; 
ghouls, ghosts, and others appeared (VrP .2 1 .25-32). It was an anger 

RUDRA CAST RATES H I M S E L F ' 1 3 1 
of frustration, for creatures had come to exist and multiply while he 
had been absent preparing the food for them (MBh. 1O. 1 7.20-25). Be­
neath this anger burned the fiercer rage of revulsion against sexual 
creation by which mankind had come to multiply. He wanted to do 
away with this mode of creation in which he had played no part, and 
rid himself of his procreative organ (SP, DhS .49.82). 
Rudra, creative fire, mind-born son of Brahma, turned away from 
sexual creation. He did so spectacularly, not calmly, as Brahma's for­
mer mind-born sons had done. He had plunged into the water, then, 
emerging, severed his phallus out of anger and in revolt against sex­
ual contact, by which mankind in his absence was made by Dakia to 
people the earth. His rage belonged to Rudra the Fire; his revulsion 
to Rudra the yogi. He left his phallus, which entered the earth (cf. SP, 
DhS .49.82-83). 
As the Fire in the waters, Rudra warmed them to fertility. Vegeta­
tion would be their issue on which mankind would subsist, even 
though Rudra by plunging into the waters had refused to create those 
for whom this nourishment was intended. 
Rudra in the waters evaded sexual procreation. He acted as the 
mind-born son of Brahma, issued from the head of the creator as his 
very life breath. The Father, Prajapati-Brahma, had raised his pro­
creative level from his animality at the time when he himself, in the 
shape of an antelope, had made Rudra the Lord of Animals, Pasupati. 
Rudra introduced his own yoga nature into the Lord of Generation 
when he let fly the arrow against the procreative act. Now, Rudra, 
from the high level of his birth, plunged into the waters. He carried 
out the command of Brahma by his own creative, ascetic fervor. 
Plants resulted from it. As a yogi, Rudra turned away from carnal sex; 
as Agni, he diffused creative heat in the water until once again time 
was against him. He tarried a long while, during which Dak!/a brought 
mankind into being. Then, emerging from the waters, the fire of 
wrath leapt up in Rudra and he tore out his now useless phallus, hav­
ing rejected its services when Brahma fuld asked for them. The sev­
ered phallus fell to the ground-into the lap of the earth. On becom­
ing SthaQ.u, the Great God had discharged into creation the Rudras 
from within his being. On emerging from the waters, he tore out his 
phallus. It fell down to the earth, as did the seed of Prajapati. 
Rudra the avenger had hurled the fire arrow of his rage against the 
Father at the climax of the latter's sexual activity. Rudra injected his 

1 3 2 
• R E F U SA L  TO PROCRE ATE 
own avenging rage into the Father, instilling into Prajapati the blazing 
intensity of his own revulsion for the act by which the integrity of the 
absolute had been ruptured. This revulsion did its work in the Lord 
of Generation, so that he as Brahma produced mind-born sons. 
Rudra, on the other hand, as Brahma's mind-born son, was charged 
paradoxically with the task of creating carnal creatures. The other 
mind-born sons of Brahma had been true ascetics, and Brahma did 
not disturb their way of life. Rudra was more intimately linked with 
his father than with these single-minded, mind-born sages. Like them 
he was a yogi; but unlike him, the sages were not Agni the Fire. 
Rudra's plunge into the waters conformed with Rudra's nature as a 
yogi and Agni at the same time. As yogi, in the waters he had turned 
away from carnal creation, but the intensity of his tapas glowed in the 
waters, and life was engendered in them by his mere presence, per­
fected in calmness. The light that he radiated in the waters was as soft 
as moonlight. With his auspicious form that is half Soma and half fire, 
Rudra practiced chastity (brahmacarya) (MBh.7. 1 73.9S-97). Soma, the 
moon, is the lord of plants (RV. 1O.97. 1 8, 19) that grow in his mild 
light as it shimmers in the luminosity of Rudra in the water. The rays 
of sun and moon are his hair. While Rudra remained immersed, time 
had taken its course on land. When he emerged from the waters his 
heat flared up in fury, for Brahma had found another to carry out his 
task, and the earth teamed with couples and their children. Rudra 
castrated himself. His severed member fell to the ground. 
Rudra, the archer, had aimed at the Father embracing his daugh­
ter. They parted when their intercourse was arrested. Rudra, the 
mind-born son of Brahma, castrated himself. The coming into exist­
ence of mankind was threatened but not prevented by Rudra. His 
fierceness matched his naked asceticism. Essentially he was the Great 
Yogi aflame in ardor, adverse to procreation by which Dakia, his sub­
stitute, peopled this earth. And yet Rudra severed his member only · 
when, after emerging from water, he saw living creatures who had 
come into existence while he abstained from creating them. No pur­
pose would now have been served by his phallus. What purpose, other 
than as an instrument to be controlled, had it served for the mind­
born yogi from the beginning? Different from the earlier sons of 
Brahma, Rudra was not a world-renouncing sage only; he was Fire 
throughout, in his asceticism and in his rage. In the waters, the inten­
sity of his asceticism was the life-giving fire. Emerging from the water, 

K A VYA U SA N A S ' 1 3 3  
his rage was now spent against himself, the yogi, whom Brahma had 
bypassed in the creation of living beings. It equaled his rage against 
the Father in sexual embrace, in the process of procreation. 
By a fraction of time-which was then just about to begin its 
course-Rudra failed to prevent the violation of the Uncreate and the 
creation of living beings, when as a hunter he had attacked the 
Father. As Brahma's mind-born son doing tapas, he stayed too long 
immersed in the waters, and the creator bypassed him and appointed 
a substitute for him who carried out Brahma's bidding. Time once 
more seemed to be against Rudra, but time was also his ally, inasmuch 
as it made Brahma transfer his mandate to a substitute. This should 
have been in accord with Rudra's detachment from procreation. In­
stead, he literally detached, on rising from the waters, his own pro­
creative member. By this act he demonstrated his total detachment, 
and that he was not moved toward procreation. 
The Great God severed his linga in fury. He severed it because it 
was the procreative organ. In this action Rudra who is Wrath and Fire 
prevailed over Rudra, the Lord of Yoga. The severed linga retained 
the ambivalence of his two natures. Severed, the linga fdl into the 
earth, then rose in space, went to the iikasa, where it stood as the end­
less fire pillar whose beginning and end neither Viil)u nor Brahma 
could reach (SP, DhS .49.82-85). 
4. THE M£ETINGS WITH KAVYA USANAS 
a. Usanas / Sukra, the Seed and Planet 
To the command of Brahma to create mortals, Rudra, the Lord of 
Yoga, responded in two ways. In total introversion he turned into a 
motionless pillar. He became Sthal)u. Or he plunged into the waters 
to practice asceticism, and he remained submerged for innumerable 
years. The glow of his ascetic energy irradiated the waters, and the 
plants began their life in them. Like tl;te numinous being ( yaÑa), the 
I) 
brahmaciirin shining in a shaft of sunlight had entered their glistening 
plane. 
I'n another myth, Rudra's asceticism in the waters has a different 
prelude as well as different consequences. Before he entered the 
waters and stayed absorbed in the most severe austerities for millions 
of years, 
Rudra had swallowed 
the 
great yogi 
Bhargava 
(MBh. 1 2.278. 1 9-27)· 

1 3 4  • R E F U S A L  TO PROCREATE 
All this took place in mythical time, whose duration not only ex­
ceeds the years of human reckoning and whose validity is unaffected 
by time, but also accommodates in its fullness the several myths like 
islands. Each of the islands observes the time that the course of its 
myth demands. Each island receives its light from Rudra and reflects 
it in its own way. The concern is not with when Rudra entered the 
water, but that he entered it in one situation or the other, either bid 
by Brahma to create mortals or when provoked by Bhargava. 
Bhargava, as the name implies, was descended from Bhrgu, who 
was born of a spark from the flaming lake of the semen of Prajapati 
(AB·3.34; also MP. 195.7-8). Or, according to another PuraI).ic tradi­
tion, Bhrgu was one of the ten mind-born sons of Brahma (MP .3.5-8; 
BhP.3. 1 2.21-22). The proper name of this scion of Bhrgu is Usanas, 
and he is called Kavya Usanas on account of his omniscience. It was 
with Kavya Usanas that Indra, king of gods and creator of the cosmos 
of an earlier aeon, drank Soma, the drink of inspiration and elixir of 
life, the drink of immortality (RV. 1 .5 1 . 1 1 ).6 Kavya Usanas also made 
for Indra the Vajra, his irresistible weapon (RV. 1 . 1 2 1 . 1 2). In fact, by 
his own might, he made Indra's might (RV. 1 .5 1 .  10), for Usanas gave 
Indra the great weapon (RV.5.34.2). Usanas, the immensely powerful 
celestial n;i, friend of Indra (RV.6.20.1 1 ), left the gods and became 
the priest of the demons (MBh.1.71.6). 
Kavya Usanas, according to the Mahabharata, was a great yogi, pos­
sessed of magic power (siddhi) (cf. MBh . 1 2.278. 16). By its exercise he 
entered Kubera, lord of the city Alaka in the Himalayas on Mount 
Kailasa (VaP.4 7. 1), chief of the yakias and rakiasas, who are the genii 
and goblins, and the lord of treasures. The great ascetic Bhargava / 
Kavya Usanas by means of yoga entered Kubera and deprived him 
of his wealth and liberty. Kubera went to the Great God and told him 
what had happened. Siva, filled with rage, took up his lance. Usanas, 
who had watched from a distance, by his magic placed himself on the 
tip of Siva's weapon. Siva bent it with his hand, and it assumed the 
shape of a bow, it became Pinaka, Siva's bow. Mahadeva, the Great 
God, took Usanas in his hand and with care put Bhargava into his 
open mouth, swallowed him, and entered the water. There Siva stood 
motionless, 
absorbed

for 
millions 
of 
years 
(MBh.12.278.7-22). Then he rose from the waters. Brahma ap-

proached him and enquired about the progress of his austerities. 
Though Siva replied that they had been properly observed, he saw 
that Usanas, who was in his belly, had waxed in greatness on account 
of Siva's own asceticism. Usanas now began to wander about in Siva's 
belly. He sang a hymn of praise to Siva, for he wanted to get out, but 
Siva had closed all the outlets from his body, except the semen pas­
sage, and he asked Usanas to get out that way. Therefore Kavya 
Usanas became Sukra (MBh.1 2.278.23-32). Sukra means "shining," 
and also "semen." Sukra furthermore is the name of the planet Ve­
nus, which he became. Because he came out of the semen passage, he 
did not reach the center of the firmament (MBh . 1 2.278.32). When 
Siva saw him emerge from his penis shining with energy, he became 
angry and wanted to kill him. Uma prevented it, and Siva let Sukra, 
the shining planet, go wherever he wanted. Sukra became Uma's son 
(MBh. 1 2.278.33-36). 
More is told elsewhere in the Mahiibhiirata and the Puriiruzs about 
the relation of Siva and Usanas. The Viimana Puriir:ta does not favor 
Usanas with the privilege of being swallowed by Siva on this occasion. 
It describes how the long austerities of Rudra the yogi in the waters 
shook the universe. Brahma and the gods, in order to stop the agita­
tion of the cosmos, asked Rudra to terminate his austerities. Rudra 
rose from the water, but the earth continued to quake. Then Rudra 
wandered about and saw the ascetic Usanas practicing austerities on 
the bank of a river. Rudra asked Usanas the purpose of)his austerities, 
and Usanas replied that their purpose was to win from Siva the spell 
(vidyii) Saଟivani that revives the dead. Rudra then gave Usanas the 
spell (VmP ,36,33-43). 
Usanas, the priest of the Asuras, desperately needed this spell be­
cause, in the battle between the gods and the demons, the latter were 
put to flight and their ranks were depleted (MBh. 1 .71 .7). The Matsya 
Puriir:ta adds that Siva made Usanas fulଠKl a vow in order to obtain the 
spell. Head down, Usanas would have to inhale smoke from the sac­
rificial fire pit for a thousand years. Usanas fulfilled the vow. Siva gave 
him the spell and promised him that he would attain all his goals, but 
this was to be kept secret. Siva also gave Usanas the lordship over 
creatures and wealth, and made him invincible (MP.47.81-1 26).7 
Usanas revived the slain Asuras by the spell for instantaneous revival, 
7 Cf. W. D. O'Flaherty, Hindu Myths: A Sourcebook Translated/rom the Sanskrit, '975, 
pp. 292, 297 and pp. 337-38 for additional versions and discussions of the myth.

the Sanjlvanl Vidya. They rose from death and were the same as be­
fore (MBh· 1 .7 1.7-9). 
In the Usanas myth, Rudra in the water is Sthal)u, the immovable 
pillar. He is the ascetic absorbed in yoga, the Great God with his tri­
dent straight as the pillar. Sthal)u, however, as occasion demands, ac­
tively intervenes in the course of things. He saved the living beings 
from total extinction and made Brahma, the Creator, introduce the 
aeviternal return of life and death into the time structure of the cos-
mos. 
In Siva's encounter with Kavya Usanas, the great yogi and priest of 
the demons received from Siva the spell that brings the dead back to 
life, even though Kavya Usanas had put to evil use his own magic 
power. He had deprived Kubera of his wealth and liberty, and to es­
cape the onslaught of Rudra's weapon had placed himself on its tip. 
Rudra, the cosmic pillar, bent his lance and it became his bow, Pinaka, 
of which the rainbow is one figure and the vault of the firmament an­
other. 
There the planet Sukra has his place. His is not the highest place on 
the firmament, and the myth explicitly states why Sukra, the planet, 
in his wanderings cannot reach the highest station (MBh. 1 2.278.32). 
Though close to the sun, as morning star (Lucifer) and as evening star 
the planet Sukra is not seen in the cosmic North, in the center of the 
firmament where the sun-pillar-Sthal)u-meets the sky. Sun and 
Venus / Sukra are the planetary figures whose positions in the sky il­
lumine the relation of Sukra to Siva. Among the planets, Sukra's po­
sition is lower than Siva's; Siva has the sun for his metaphor. Among 
stars, it is Sirius who represents Rudra. Each of these luminaries in its 
own light conveys the splendor of Rudra, shining from the sky. 
The reason given for Sukra's not attaining the highest position in 
the sky is that he came out of Siva's penis, out of the lower part of the 
body of the god. Similarly, Sukra had to fulfill his vow of smoke in;. 
halation, holding his head down over a pit of fire. He had to learn 
humility. As priest of the demons, Kavya Usanas had fallen from the 
station that he had held as the power behind Indra, the creator of the 
cosmos and king of gods. 
For a moment Kavya Usanas was seen by Rudra on the tip of his 
trident, but Rudra brought him low even before he let him find his 
way out of his semen passage. 
Usanas lost the high position among the gods that was his when In-

KA VY A U SA N A S  • 1 3 7  
dra was the creator, though he retained great power by virtue o f  yoga. 
This he proved by entering Kubera, the guardian of Indra's treasure. 
While in him, Usanas robbed Kubera of his wealth and will power. 
Kubera, whose capital, Alaka, is in the north where Siva dwells on the 
mountain, sought Siva's help. As Usanas had entered Kubera, so Siva, 
taking Usanas into his hand, made him enter his body. There Us an as 
dwelt for a long time and grew in might by the asceticism of Rudra. 
Usanas had depleted Kubera, whom he had entered, and he grew as 
a result of Siva's austerities while he was within the body of Rudra, by 
whom he had been swallowed. 
The attitude of Rudra, Lord of Yogis, toward Usanas, the great 
yogi, is ambiguous. Rudra had Usanas in his power, yet he gave to 
Usanas of his own power--only to feel murderous toward him when 
Sukra ! Usanas emerged shining with energy from Rudra's body. 
Kavya Usanas, who was the power behind Indra, was overpowered 
by Rudra. Rudra, within the course of Indian theogony, has taken 
over many traits of Indra.8 By swallowing Usanas, Lord Siva took into 
himself the power that was Usanas's and Indra's. At the same time, 
the Lord of Yogis communicated his own magic power to Kavya 
Usanas in his belly, thereby increasing the power of his captive. When 
the latter came out of Rudra's body, the Great God let Sukra ! Usanas 
go wherever his wanderings as a planet would take him. 
The exit of Sukra from the body of Siva is told differently in the 
basic myth of Indian architecture (Ch. 111.5). Usanas, the priest of the 
Asuras (who had been defeated by the gods), sacrificed a goat. When 
the sweat of his anger fell on the sacrificial animal, it grew to' cosmic 
size and drove the gods from heaven. In order to save them, Siva let 
the fire from his third eye pursue Usanas, who could find no refuge 
except in Siva. By his yoga power Usanas made himself small, entered 
Siva's ear, and found refuge in the belly of the god, where he saw the 
whole universe resting in comfort. Siva, weased by the diplomacy of 
Usanas, discharged him through his semen (iukra) passage and be­
ଡtowed on him sovereignty as the planet Sukra. At the request of 
SUkra, the Lord also granted a boon to the defeated goat demon. This 
goat demon would be given a place of rest on earth, where the gods 
would reside on its extended shape, in the archetypal plan of every 
. " w. D. O'Flaherty, Asceticism and Eroticism in the Mythology of Siva, 1973, pp. 83-89, 
discusses the qualities and characteristics that Indra has in common with Siva, and that 
the latter inherited from the former.

temple (jpad.3.26.93- 1 25). The gods were supported by the sacrificial 
meaning of the goat demon while they held in check its demonic 
power. 
Siva assigned this residence to the former goat demon and made 
him protector of the site (vastupa). The prostrate shape of the goat 
demon, meted out to and occupied by the gods, who took their sta­
tions on him, underlies the structured order of the building. Sukra's 
defeated and pardoned demon lies at the base of sacred architecture 
here on earth. 
Sukra himself, however, having become the seed and son of Siva, 
was raised by him to the sky, shining brightly in the firmament as a 
planet, though this "Lucifer" cannot ever rise to the zenith, the cosmic 
North, the home of Siva. 
Siva, by swallowing U sanas, had taken to himself the ancient power 
of Indra. Yet, in return, Siva increased by his asceticism the power of 
Usanas, the great yogi, and placed him as planet in the firmament, 
and on earth Siva placed the fallen goat demon for temples to rise 
above it. 
More than that, the Lord of Yoga gave to Usanas the spell for re­
viving the dead. Usanas had proved himself worthy to receive it, for 
he had not only performed world-shaking austerities and kept his 
"smoke vow," head down, but, in a preceding aeon, he had been 
Kavya Usanas, who had served Soma, the elixir of immortality, to In­
dra. Now Rudra, who from the beginning had power over life and 
death, imparted to Usanas the secret for reviving the dead. It was an 
application to a demonic purpose of his power over death. 
From the beginning, Rudra had power over life and death. He 
spared the life of Prajapati and became Pasupati. Although it rested 
with Rudra Tryambaka to cut short the life of mortals or to let them 
enjoy its full span, Sthaf.lu, withdrawn into himself, projected his en­
ergy of withdrawal into a continuum where the activity of life would 
alternate with quiescence to the end of days. As Tryambaka, Rudra 
was the lord of time, of living creatures, of the present-in which to 
cherish past and future. As Sthaf.lu, he introduced the aeviternal pat­
tern of renewed life into the fabric of existence. To the priest of the 
demons, however, Rudra gave the spell for instant restitution of life 
cut short, a magic remedy against the death of the body and for the 
survival of the individual as an identical entity in the very same body. 

KA V Y A  U 5A N A S  • 1 3 9  
Siva let dwell on earth the prostrate shape of the goat demon arisen 
from Bhiirgava's sacrifice. He gave to him, assigned to him, the basic 
position underlying the creative work of the architect. Moreover, he 
gave to the goat demon one of his own names, and called him Vii­
stupa. 
Kiivya Usanas, the antagonist and protege of Rudra, was the power 
that had incited and driven Indra to the heroic feats by which this cre­
ator god established his cosmos. Kiivya Usanas was a great yogi, who 
used his power to inspire the Creator himself; he provided weapons 
to the conqueror of the dragon Vrtra. When, subsequently, Usanas 
became the chief priest of the demons, his sacrificial power in the 
shape of a goat demon assumed a destructive transcosmic dimension. 
Siva subdued the goat demon and gave it the basic position underly­
ing the architecture of the temple in which all the gods have their 
place. 
In Vedic ritual, Sukra's power had its symbol in the Sukra cup 
(MS +6.3). As such, "Sukra is the sun" (TS.6.4. 10.2; SB .4.2. 1 . 1 ). 
While Kavya Usanas was with the gods, his sun-power activated their 
king toward creation. Having left the gods, this mighty yogi, as priest 
of the demons, is Rudra's antagonist, whom the great god swallows as 
effortlessly as he bends his lance into the shape of a bow. Once Siva 
has drawn Usanas within himself, the Lord of Yoga, absorbed in aus­
terities, allows his own asceticism to increase the power of his captive 
antagonist, just as he imparts to Kavya Usanas the Saitiivani Vidya. 
The great god is bounteous to his antagonist, who previoJlsly had de­
prived Kubera, the brother of Siva, of his strength and treasure. 
b. The Origin of the Knowledge of Reviving the Dead 
Tradition is not unanimous about the origin of the Saftjivani Vidya. 
The Mahiibhiirata assigns to Usanas ownership of the spell for reviving 
the dead (MBh. 1 .7 1 .7-9). Siva came to ଢow through Nandin, his 
main attendant, that in the battle betweenC'the gods and the demons 
Usanas restored the dead demons to life. He did this by means of his 
Saiijivani spell. Siva ordered Nandin to bring Usanas to him, and he 
swallowed the latter. The gods became victorious, since the fallen de­
mons were not restored to life while Usanas was in the belly of Siva. 
When Sukra came out from Siva's penis, Siva made him his son 
(VmP.43. 1-42). Sukra, in this version of the myth, himself possessed 

1 4 0 ' R E F u S A L  TO PROC REATE 
the power or spell for reviving the dead. The memory of the ancient 
life-giving sun power of Kavya Usanas I Sukra survives in this tradi­
tion. 
Kavya Usanas, throughout his checkered career, retained his orig­
inal character, though his pristine might declined into magic. He was 
the life-giving power and, as such, he came to play the role of Sukra 
or semen, the seed of life. The semen that was emitted by Siva, how­
ever, was not his own seed; he allowed Kavya Usanas to appear as his 
seed, and when the latter came out shining, Rudra became angry (cf. 
MBh. 1 2.278'33-36). Sukra, because of his past when he was the sun, 
was qualified to appear as Rudra's semen. Rudra did not shed his own 
seed, since this would have gone against his brahmacarya. Neverthe­
less, by granting permission to Usanas-waxed in greatness by Siva's 
yoga-to emerge by way of his semen passage and no other opening 
of his body, Rudra made the image of the pillar of containment ap­
pear as that of the shedder of seed. 
Rudra's sojourn in the water had widely different consequences. 
When he had emerged with the intention of creating mortals and saw 
that this had been accomplished by Dakia, Rudra in fury castrated 
himself. When Rudra emerged with Kavya Usanas in his belly, seed 
was shed, and a star began to shine in the firmament as Siva's son. 
Ekavratya, the Sole Vratya, who is Rudra, took to himself a bow. It 
was Indra's (AV. 15. 1 .6). With it he took from Indra all that the bow 
encompassed-the wide earth under the vault of the sky. He became 
its ruler: {sana, the Lord. When Usanas, with deft wit, escaped being 
attacked by Rudra and settled himself on the tip of the lance of the 
Great God, he at once found himself on Rudra's bow, into which 
shape the latter had bent his weapon. Prognostically, Usanas found 
his place on the arc of the firmament, a position he was to occupy 
when Rudra, after gently having put him into his mouth, let him wan­
der in his body and leave his belly as Sukra, the planet. In between 
the swallowing and the emission, Usanas had waxed in might. He was 
strong through his ancient Soma-Vajra power, which Rudra further 
increased by his asceticism. As Rudra had taken up the bow of Indra, 
so Usanas held within himself the might of Indra. Rudra incorpo­
rated that ancient power-and discharged it to shine from the sky. 
The encounters of Rudra with Kavya Usanas are multifaceted, am­
bivalent events. They do not lie within the main direction that extends 
from the beyond through the Father-Prajapati-Brahma to Siva, but 

KA VYA U 5A N A S ' 1 4 ! 
are linked to it where Rudra plunges into the water. Thence a road 
opens on which Kavya Usanas traveled, where he met Kubera, after 
a long journey from the world of Indra. When Usanas found himself 
trapped in the body of Siva, he grew in power through Rudra's aus­
terities in the water. Brahma was interested in the outcome of those 
austerities. He solicitously inquired about their success, and was reas­
sured by Rudra (MBh. 1 2.278.23-24). The power and glory of Indra 
had been incorporated in Rudra, and Sukra arose shining in that 
world. But the power of Usanas had also increased through Rudra's 
yoga while Usanas was in Rudra's belly (MBh. 1 2.278.2S-28). 
The transfer of the· kingdom of one god to another was conducted 
without bloodshed. It merely caused Rudra some passing anger. At 
his birth Rudra, the Great God, had been established in and as the 
cosmos by Prajapati, his father, who gave him his names and domains. 
This was the beginning of Rudra's cosmos. His was not the first cos­
mos to come into existence. Indra, king of gods, had established an 
earlier aeon when he killed Vrtra, the precosmic serpent, who at that 
time was the guardian of the Uncreate. Indra received his inspiration 
and energy for the fight with the dragon from Kavya Usanas, who 
gave him his weapon. Indra, moreover, had killed his father and 
made his mother a widow (RV.4. 1 8. 1 2) before he became king of 
gods. By incorporating within his body Kavya Usanas, Rudra incor­
porated the kingdom of Indra within his realm. The only casualty in 
this theomachy was Rudra's lance. Even so it did not break; it bent 
and vaulted over Rudra's world. The world of Indra and Kavya 
Usanas had heroes for gods. They fought armed with weapons and 
wit to release the waters of heaven and the sun, which Vrtra kept im­
prisoned in the Uncreate. The task before Indra and Ra-.;ya Usanas 
was clear and, for all its difficulties, simple. Vrtra, the guardian of the 
Uncreate, was the enemy. Indra fought Vଣtra in order to bring into 
existence the manifest cosmos. Indra killed his father right at the be­
ginning. He then had no rival, and he had made a clean break with 
the past. 
Before he was born into his world, Rudra was not a warrior. 
Though he was an archer, he was essentially a hunter and, like Vrtra, 
a guardian of the Uncreate. He observed brahrnacarya. He lashed out 
in fiery rage when he saw the Father shed his seed. 
The story has here been told how, eventually, Rudra was born; how 
he assumed the state of being born as his manifest form, which sub-

1 4 2 · R E F U S A L  TO PROCREATE 
sumed his primordial appearance as a hunter. He became the cosmos 
and remained the archer, the guardian of the Uncreate and the 
avenger of its violation by the Father. After his birth from Brahma, 
Rudra did not sever the bond with his father. It was elastic and tena­
cious. Rudra neither broke it nor did he annihilate the Father; though 
he killed him, he brought him back to life (SkP'3' 1.40. 16, 36-42). 
When the Father asked Rudra to create mortals, Rudra showed him­
self as Sthal).u, withdrawn into himself by his asceticism. Or he 
plunged into the water and created the plants. Or, standing as Sthal).u 
in the waters, by way of his asceticism he made Usanas in his belly wax 
in power. Rudra had swallowed the ancient, heroic cosmos. Sukra was 
to rise as the morning star of Rudra's cosmos. It is the cosmos of the 
Great God who dwells in it, and, while he is its Lord, he remains the 
guardian of the Uncreate, whereas Vrtra, killed once and for all by 
Indra, lies at the bottom of the waters, which flow over his dead body. 
c. Kiivya Usanas and the Fallen Titans 
Mythologically, the figure of Kavya Usanas links the cosmos of Indra 
with that of Rudra. Cosmologically, it links the worlds of the gods and 
the Asuras, who became demons. The encounter between Rudra and 
Kavya Usanas took place late in the career of the ancient sage. Kavya 
Usanas drank Soma with Indra (RV. l .5 1 . 1 1 ). Indra needed Soma. As 
soon as he was born, he drank it in his father's house (RV.3.48.2). 
Gods such as Viil).u, the Matuts, or Trita Aptya treated Indra to this 
drink of immortality (RV.8. 1 2. 1 6). Originally Soma was in Vrtra 
(RV.IO. 1 24.4-6).9 There lay its source in the days before creation. 
Before Indra created the cosmos, Vrtra had withheld the waters 
and the light, the flowing light of the godhead. He also held captive 
the ancient gods, Agni, Soma, and Varul).a. Indra asked Agni, Soma, 
and Varul).a to emerge and leave Vrtra's darkness: "The rule has 
changed . . . .  The Asuras lost their power" (RV. I0. 1 24. 1-5). The 
Asuras were the Titans, the ancient gods, before Indra's rule. Soma, 
Agni, and Varul).a were Titans who went over to Indra and became 
gods. 
Kavya Usanas / Sukra ତas the priest of these gods. In that capacity, 
Kavya Usanas "made Indra's might" (RV. 1 .5 1 . 1O). The Asuras who 
left Vrtra, joined Indra and became gods of his cosmos. The other 
• Cf. A. Bergaigne, La Religion vedique, 3: 1 45-49 : Rg Veda Sa1[lhita (RV) , tr. K. F. Geld­
ner, 1 95 1 , 3 : 354. 

K A V Y A  U SA N A S · 1 4 3  
Titans stayed in darkness; they fell, when Vrtra died, into the neth­
erworld, where they retained their name of Asura. As denizens of the 
netherworld their position, however, was that of demons. 
In the lJ.g Veda, Sukra was with the gods, and judging by his actions 
and importance he seemed to be Indra's elder, the guru of the 
younger god in his new world. In the Briihma1J,as, however, Sukra was 
the priest of the demons (jB . 1 . ]  25). Nonetheless, he went back from 
the demons to the gods: the gods won him over with wishing cows 
(TmB .7.5.20). When he was the guru of the gods he received great 
wealth from the Asuras (BSS . 1 8'47). Wealth attracted Kavya Usanas. 
He entered Kubera, the god of riches, and stole his wealth. This in­
furiated Siva (MBh.1 2.278.7-1 3). 
The riches of Kubera, the great weapons that Sukra possessed, and 
the wealth that he received from the Asuras were of a special kind. 
They were treasures akin to Soma, a wealth not to be hoarded, a 
magic, potent wealth to be used. This wealth constituted a body of 
knowledge of which the Sailjivani Vidya, the science of resuscitation 
or the spell for reviving the dead, was part. Sukra was said to be the 
only one who had this power (MBh. 1 .71 .7-9), though it was said much 
earlier, in the Satapatha Briihma1J,a, that the gods resuscitated those 
slain in battle by means of a sacrifice to the Fathers (SB .2.6. 1 . 1 ). Ap­
parently, the sacrifice to the Fathers was effective on that particular 
occasion, though one does not hear that the gods used it for this pur­
pose at any other time; they would have been badly in need of the 
Saiijivani Vidya during their perpetual war with the demons. Rudra 
did not impart this Vidya to the gods; he reserved it for Usanas. 
Sukra employed the science of resuscitation only for the benefit of 
the demons. He brought back to life the demons/who had fallen in 
battle, and he kept their ranks at an even strength (V٨P.43. 1-8). How­
ever, Sukra himself did not hesitate to leave the demons and go over 
to the gods when things were going ifidly for the demons. Sukra de­
serted them and joined the gods, who were powerful at that moment. 
The demons had to confine themselves to the netherworld. Soon, 
however, Sukra, feeling sorry for them, returned and assured them 
of his help. As only a few of them were left, he asked them not to con­
tinue the fight and to practice asceticism. Surprisingly, he said he 
would go to Siva to acquire the spells for victory (MP.47.61-80; 
PP·S· 13·204-1 7)· 
Sukra received the spell from Siva (VmP '36.33-43). This happened 

1 4 4 · R E f lJ S A L  TO PROC REATE 
when the demon kings Hiral).yakasipu (Gold Cloth) and Bali were rul­
ing (cf. MP-47.34-39)' 
Later on, when Andhaka became the king of the demons, Sukra 
successfully applied his knowledge of revival to those fallen in battle. 
However, Nandin, Siva's chief of gal).as, informed Siva of Sukra's 
Vidy:i Siva ordered Nandin to seize Sukra; he did so, and presented 
him to Siva. Thereupon Siva threw Sukra into his mouth. Sukra wan­
dered through Siva's belly, where he roamed through the entire cos­
mos contained therein. Tiring of this experience, he clamored to be 
let out of the body of Siva. The Great God complied, let Sukra out 
through the semen passage and declared him to be his son (cf. Ch. 
VI.4.a). Sukra returned to the army of the demons (VmP .43. 1-44). 
The movement of Sukra from the demons to the gods and back 
again was a continuation of his original descent from the Asuras as 
Titans and gods to the Asuras who had become demons. The first de­
scent of Sukra made possible his freedom of movement between the 
two worlds, that of the gods and that of the demons, whose realms, 
after the fall of the Titans, had become separated and were as far 
apart as heaven and the netherworld. For this reason it was said that 
the wise Sukra became the guru of both the demons and the gods 
(MBh. l .60·40-42). 
Sukra was originally the priest of the Titans, the Asuras. When 
Soma, Agni, and Varul).a, these mighty Asuras, followed the change 
of rule, left Vrtra, and followed Indra, the Ri Sukra went with these 
gods, who had been Asuras. When with the death of Vrtra the Titans 
fell, Sukra again became their guru. For a short while he went back to 
the gods; he was a seer, and Siddha, a magician, wise and crafty, and 
he soon returned to the demons. Sukra exercised the power of resus­
citation only for the sake of the demons. Like Soma, the elixir of im­
mortality, the SanjIvani Vidya was secret knowledge. Essentially it be­
longed to the Asuras. 
Usanas put into practice a power that before creation had rested in 
the unknowable mystery of life-to-be that filled the Uncreate. Rudra, 
in the beginning of things, meant to preserve its integrity. Sukra, the 
priest of the Asuras, however, put to work some of the power that had 
lain in the Uncreate. The Asuras, when falien, benefitted by Sukra's 
power of resuscitation. 
Surprisingly, Sukra did not practice this power at every occasion 
that called for it. When the ranks of the demons fighting against the 

SWALLO W I N G WORLD PO I S O N · 1 4 5  
gods were depleted, Sukra asked them to stop fighting. He went to 
Siva and acquired the charms necessary for' victory. Siva made Sukra 
perform the smoke vow and granted him all the boons. Obviously 
Sukra, at that time, did not have the power to resuscitate the demons. 
He asked them to stop fighting. He expected to receive the spells 
from Siva. While it was certain that Sukra would succeed in winning 
this boon from Siva, the lord over life and death, it was equally clear 
that Sukra could no longer rely on his own power. The rule had 
changed once more since the time when some of the Titans had be­
come gods ' and the others had become demons. Siva had become 
Mahadeva, the Great God who had every power. 
The encounters of Siva with Kavya Usanas were of two kinds. From 
one of them Sukra emerged as Siva's son and as a planet. In the other, 
he had, at Siva's bidding, to perform the smoke vow before Siva 
granted him the knowledge for reviving the dead. 
Sukra having received it and used it to the detriment of the gods, 
Nandin, foremost of Siva's gal)as, represented to Siva that the revivi­
fication of the dead demons was intolerable (VmP.43.1O). Nandin re­
sented Sukra's power-unaware that it was given to him by Siva. Nan­
din spoke of it as if it had been Sukra's very own. 
Indeed, Usanas alone had the power of resuscitation (MBh. 1 .7 1 .7-
9). When this mighty magician and priest of the demons encountered 
Siva, Siva swallowed him. Together with his magic power, Usanas was 
kept within Siva practicing tapas, and Usanas waxed in power through 
Siva's austerities. A reciprocal increase of power resulted from 
Usanas's stay in Siva's body, and the Sanjivani Vidya became Siva's se­
cret. 
Its power was not integral to Siva. He gave (back) to Usanas the 
Sanjlvani Vidya; he even gave him the lordship over creatures and 
made him invincible, the glory of con5luering all the gods would be 
Usanas's (MP'47. 1 23-1 26; 249.4-6). Thus Siva, in the battle of the 
gods and the demons, helped the demons who, though fallen, had 
been Asuras, the powers before the cosmos was created by Indra. 
5. THE SWALLOWING OF THE WORLD POISON 
The gods did not do well in their fight with the demons, whose 
strength persisted undiminished due to the magic spell for resuscitat­
ing those who had fallen in battle that Kavya Usanas had received 

1 46 • R E F U S A L  TO PROCREATE 
from Siva. The worried gods asked Brahma for his advice, and he 
counseled them to cooperate with, rather than fight, the demons. The 
gods thereupon suggested to the demons that together they should 
churn the ocean for amrta, the elixir of immortality (MP.249.3-22). 
This proposal appealed to the demons, because by winning amrta and 
drinking it they would save themselves from being killed in battle. 
This was preferable to being resuscitated by the Saitjivani Vidya. 
Accordingly, the demons and the gods churned the ocean. Their 
churning stick was the mountain Mandara. The cosmic serpent 
Ananta uprooted the mountain with all its trees and creepers. Indra 
fastened the tip of the mountain on the back of the king of tortoises. 
The serpent Vasuki was the rope. As the gods and demons began the 
churn, the gods held Vasuki by the tail, the demons clutched him by 
the head. Fire and smoke arose from his mouth and turned into 
clouds and lightning. Then a thunderous noise came from the whirl­
pool of the deep as the trees crashed from the revolving mountain. 
Fire broke out from their friction, killing the forest animals and those 
under water, while the resins of the trees and the juices of the plants 
exuded into the ocean and mixed with its waters. After churning for 
a long time, the gods and demons became tired. However, the god 
ViiI)u-NarayaI)a gave them strength, and they stirred the ocean with 
renewed vigor (MBh. 1 . l6.6-32 ; cf. MP.249.23-82). 
Then wonderful things arose from the ocean: the moon and the 
sun, Sri (the goddess Luck), the Kaustubha gem of ViiI)u, and other 
treasures, one after another (MBh. 1 . 16.33-36; MP .250. 1-5). 
The churning went on with great vehemence, as the gods and the 
demons were avid for ambrosia. A burning mass of poison, the terri­
ble KalakiiŽa, came out of the ocean. It blazed with venomous fumes, 
which asphyxiated the triple world. Entranced, the hallowed Great 
Lord Mantramiirti, "Form-of-mantra," at the request of Brahma and 
in order to protect everyone, swallowed the poison. He held it in his 
throat. The KalakiiŽa poison left a dark blue mark forever on Siva's 
throat (MP.250. 14-6 1). From that time he was called NilakaQtha, the 
Blue-throated (MBh. 1 . 16.38N, insert 274, lines 5-7). When Brahma 
saw the blue lotus-like throat of Siva that looked as though a serpent, 
as though Takiaka-the king of serpents-was licking it, he eX­
claimed: "0 Siva, you look beautiful with this throat" (VliP.54.91-g2; 
cf. MSt. 14). Although the dark KalakiiŽa poison burned like the 
doomsday fire (VliP.54.85-87), it did not harm Mantramiirti, the 

S W A L LO W I N G  WORLD PO I SO N ' 1 4 7  
Great Lord, who held it in his throat, where the center of purity (vi­
suddha cakra)lO is situated, and whence the Word which is the body of 
the universe becomes manifest. The poison did not stain this subtle 
center in Siva's body. It left a blue mark (cf. SkP.5.2.14.9) on the 
throat of the god, by which he is recognized as the liberator from 
death and destruction. 
At another occasion he had drunk poison with a long-haired muni 
in ecstasy. The effect of the drink had carried KeSin in timeless trans­
port across celestial fields, whereas Siva absorbed within himself the 
KalakiiŽa poison. By drinking the KalakiiŽa poison, Rudra conquered 
its deadly power. As Mrtyunjaya, the conqueror of death 
(SkP. 1 . 1 . 1 0.68), he reabsorbed into himself its deadly darkness (kala), 
the destruction of phenomenal existence. The gods said to Siva, "we 
strove for amrta, for immortality, but found death" (SkP.5.2 . 1 4.5); 
and they confessed that they had churned the ocean out of greed 
(SkP.5.2.14.6). In their distress they declared that they should be 
blamed. Their greed had turned into poison. When Siva heard the 
confession of the gods, he was moved by compassion and drank the 
great, terrible dark poison (SkP.5.2. 14.9). 
The KalakiiŽa poison was a mass compacted of agony and greed. As 
it rose from the churn it broke out in flames; "by the anger of Rudra, 
by the fire of KalakiiŽa the universe was burned to ashes" 
(SkP. 1 . 1 . I0. l, 3). The black mass of agony and greed flamed up as the 
anger of Rudra, threatening or consuming the universe. The Great 
Lord swallowed it all and took back into himself the fire of his anger 
as, on another occasion, moved by compassion, he had made Brahma 
take back into himself his fiery energy by which the Creator had 
threatened to destroy all that he had created. Brahma complied, and 
out of all the pores of his body came Death, the young, dark goddess. 
Siva swallowed the flaming KalakiiŽa*nd held it in his throat, which 
it beautified with the color of the peaଥock (SkP.5.2. 14.9). 
Now the churning could continue. Further treasures came up and, 
at last, the gods and demons churned up amrta. It rose in a white ves­
sel held by Dhanvantari, the physician of the gods (MBh. 1 .  16.37; 
MP.251 .5-6). Dhanvantari here appears playing the role of the 
healer, which formerly belonged to Rudra (Ch. 11.3). The hallowed 
1 0 The viiuddha cakra is the fifth in ascending order of the six centers of subtle energy 
within the human body. Meditating on it, the yogi realizes the secret meaning of the 
four Vedas (Cf. SS.5.90-9 1 ).

Mantramurti saved the gods and the demons from death, so that 
Dhanvantari could come with the coveted ambrosia. It brought no 
happiness. Strife over the amrta, cunning, and deception broke out 
between the gods and the demons. It all ended with a tumultuous bat­
tle. The gods won the amrta and deposited this elixir of deathlessness 
with ViiI)u for safekeeping (MBh. 1 . 16'38-40; 1 . 17. 1-30; MP.251 .5-
36). 
Siva saved the cosmos from destruction by swallowing the Kalakuta 
poison-also called Halahala--compacted of poisonous greed and the 
agonies caused by it, and blazing with angry flames. Greed and pain 
formed the vicious poison that burst into choking fumes and flames; 
the latter are the anger of the Great Lord. The anger of Rudra was 
not directed in particular against the greedy gods; it was all-consum­
ing, and, when the gods admitted their greed, the Great Lord was 
moved to compassion. The formation of the Kalakuta poison out of 
greed and suffering was due to a natural process that led to catastro­
phe. Through the intercession of Rudra it was avoided. Mantramurti 
swallowed the whole of it and became Nilakamha of sinister beauty, 
with his dark blue throat. 
While the blessed Lord in trance, as Mantramurti, swallowed the 
world poison and became NilakaI)tha, he remained what he had been 
from the beginning. Manyu, "Wrath," is one of Rudra's names 
(BhP.3. 1 2 . 1 2), and denotes that part of his being that consumes the 
cosmos. Out of compassion the Lord took the fire of the poison-the 
fire of wrath-back into himself. The Great Yogi held it in his throat. 
After Siva had drunk the flaming poison that had threatened to de­
stroy everything living, Lord NilakaI)tha went back to his cave in 
Mount Meru, the world mountain. The sages who had assembled 
there bowed to the Lord and lauded him who had swallowed Kala­
kuta and allayed the cosmic turmoil. But Nila-Lohita, the blue-red 
god, smilingly disparaged his conquest of Kalakuta, since there was 
yet another and more terrible poison. Kalakuta was no poison at all 
when compared to mundane existence. This is the real poison, con­
sisting of desire and attachment. This poison is overcome by detach­
ment and withdrawal. These, more arduous than the swallowing of 
Kalakuta, liberate and set free (cf. LP . 1 .86,4-20). The greed of the 
gods and demons for immortality was but a special form of desire and 
attachment. 
To Siva, the Lord of Yoga, the conquest of death counted for less 

SWALLOW I N G  WORLD PO I S O N · 1 4 9  
than the conquest of passion and delusion, and the Great God smiled 
in the knowledge that in the end his fire would burn the universe to 
ashes. Then, toward the end of the cosmic night of dissolution, his 
fire would rise as a pillar of flames. 
In the churning of the ocean, Siva acted for the sake of gods, men, 
and demons. Gods and demons cooperated, a rare occurrence 
brought about by the common purpose of the winning of ambrosia, 
the nectar of immortality (R. 1 .44. I 4- I 6). It was ajoint endeavor, and 
had been going on for some time before the help of Siva was invoked 
by Brahma as the leader of all the gods (MP .250.27), or, according to 
another version, by ViiQu (R . I ,  app. 1 ,  no. 8, lines 8-1 2). 
The version of this myth (MP.249-25 1) already considered, and 
first narrated in the Mahiibhiirata (MBh . l . I6- I7), is not the only one. 
Another version, first recounted in the Riimiiya7}a, relates that the poi­
son arose first, and it was only after Lord Siva swallowed the deadly 
stuff that the treasures arose from the ocean. The poison, moreover, 
did not come up from the waters directly: it was venom vomited by 
the serpent king Vasuki after he let himself be used as the churning 
rope for a thousand years (R. I ,  app. 1 ,  no. 8, lines 1-3). He had be­
come weary and angered by the seemingly endless double pull of the 
gods, who held his tail, and the demons who pulled from the front. 
These positions had been assigned to them by Kril)a, the avatar of 
Viଦl)u. The demons, thinking they had been given preferential treat­
ment, were, in fact, scorched by the flames issuing from the mouth of 
Vasuki. On the advice of ViiQu, the gods and demons threw herbs 
and medicinal plants into, the ocean to invigorate its waters so that 
they would yield amrta. ViiQu saw to it that the gods and demons co­
operated in their shared venture to acquire the elixir of immortality. 
However, while Viil)u promised an equal portion to each of the par­
ties, he knowingly deceived the demons, frt:om whom he withheld the 
precious draught (VP . 1 .g.82- 1Og; BhP .8.g. I-13). 
In the myth, as told in the Vi$7}u Purii7}a, the deceit of ViiQu per­
vades the ambience of the churning of the ocean. In it ViiQu literally 
carried great weight: the cosmic mountain, Mandara, used as a churn­
ing stick, rested on a tortoise, which was ViiQu himself in one of his 
animal avatars. Moreover, ViiQu was also enthroned on the summit 
of the mountain; he occupied the pivotal position (VP.l .g.88-go). 
When Vasuki struck his teeth on the rocks, he vomited the frightful 
Halahala poison, which burned the entire world. The gods could not 

1 5 0

bear it and approached Vi!?l)u. ViiI:lu invoked Siva, the Great God. 
Because Siva is the foremost of the gods, he must receive what was 
first produced by the churning of the ocean; he must accept the 
venom as the gift of the first fruit. The blessed Lord Siva, moved by 
the distress of the gods and by the words of Viil)u, drank the Hala­
hala poison as though it were amrta, and then departed (R. I ,  app. 1 ,  
no. 8, lines 1-16). 
Vi!?I:lu, in the myth as told in the Ramaya1Ja, acted in character with 
his multiple role as portrayed in the Vi$1Ju Pura1Ja. His invocation of 
Siva bristled with irony. Lord Siva, however, moved by the plight of 
the gods and by the truth that the words of ViiI:lu conveyed, ignoring 
their irony, drank the Halahala poison-the venom of the serpent. 
Siva took it into himself with the grace that is his as a dancer, as the 
Great Yogi, and as the compassionate Lord. 
The churning of the ocean, samudra-manthana, a multilayered myth, 
is based on the diurnal annual cyclical movement of the sun. Its rising 
and setting was seen as due to a churning of heaven and earth. In the 
ȯg Veda, the churning was the work of the Asvins (RV.I O.24.4). These 
celestials, who, like Rudra, were healers, agitated the cosmic tree in 
opposite directions in order to liberate Saptavadhri (RV'5.78.6), a 
personification of the celestial fire. I I  
The churning of the cosmic ocean had the mountain rather than 
the tree as its pivot, and the labor of the two Asvins of an earlier time 
was performed by the gods and the demons; their churning rod was 
the cosmic serpent. They pulled it this way and that way. The position 
of ViiI:lu was pivotal; he was the fundament and crown of the churn­
ing stick. When the churning was about to lead to a catastrophe, 
Viil)u or Brahma sought the help of Lord Siva on behalf of the gods. 
In the narrative of the V41Ju Pura1Ja, where ViiI:lu was present in 
his shape of the tortoise and was also enthroned on the crest of Mount 
Mandara, no appeal was made to Siva to save the world from destrucJ 
tion by the KalakuŽa poison. In this version of the churning of the 
ocean, Siva did not figure as the savior from the deadly Halahala poi­
son. The poison risen from the ocean was taken possession of by the 
Nagas, the serpent gods (VP . 1 .9.97). Lord Siva had no part in its dis­
posal. He did not swallow the burning, deadly, black poison. Just be­
fore the appearance of the KalakuŽa, he took to himself one of the

treasures, the cool-rayed moon, as soon as it emerged from the waters 
(VP . 1 .9.97). Ever since, Lord Siva has carried the crescent moon in his 
matted hair. Its delicate arc is said to be the sixteenth segment of the 
moon. Eternal and immovable, it governs and stands above the alter­
nating succession of the white and black fortnights, a symbol of con­
sciousness that contains the ideas of all that will be.12 
This lovely ornament, the moon, with its cool rays, and holding in 
its cup Soma, the elixir of life, was all that Siva took from the cosmic 
ocean in the myth as told in the V4rtu Pura1J-<1. There, no beautiful 
blue mark was left on the throat of the Great God. l'he poison was 
taken care of by the serpents, the Nagas; their king Vasuki had spat 
it into the ocean. 
The world poison made its appearance in the Kna Yuga, the first 
and-not so--"Perfect Age." Later on, the blue-throated Lord was 
seen by people engaged in their daily pursuits. The herdsmen and the 
women saw him as they carried home water from pond or well. They 
saw the Great, formidable, God, the Savior, who had averted a pre­
mature destruction of the cosmos. They recognized him by the blue 
mark imprinted on his throat by the world poison. 
Tradition is not unanimous as to whether the deadly venom ap­
peared first when gods and demons had begun to churn the ocean for 
amrta, or whether the serpent threw it up after having been pulled 
back and forth as a churning rope. Formed by greed and deceit, the 
world poison rose from the cosmic ocean in the first, the Perfect, age, 
threatened the destruction of the cosmos, and was consumed by Siva, 
the destroyer of destruction, the Lord of Yoga, whose throat it beau­
tified and whose body it did not harm. Or the poison Kalakiira stayed 
with the Nagas, the serpents, the owners of treasure. 
The name Kalakiira has two literal meanings: "blatk (kala) mass 
(kula)" and also "time (kiila) puzzle (kut)." Both are simultaneously 
valid; the first hints at the dark secret of the other. Its darkness is that 
of death (cf. SkP . 1 . 1 . 10.68). The gods saw clearly that, while they had 
been churning for immortality, they had also churned up death. 
Siva Nilakal)rha, who swallowed the world poison in the first world 
age, the Krta Yuga, was but another form of Siva Mahakala, who will 
consume the time-world at the end of days. The gods spoke in human 
metaphors of emotion and conscience. In cosmic terms, however,

they had participated in and witnessed the commotion called Time, 
signaled in the first world age by the lights of heaven, by day and 
night. Time enveloped them like an all-consuming, deadly fire that 
had issued from the churning. Time, Kala, was the world poison. 
Siva, the Great Yogi, swallowed this venom unharmed. It marked his 
throat with sinister peacock beauty, dark blue, as if a serpent had 
kissed it.

LINGA 
1 .  THE FALLING OF THE Linga IN THE DEODAR FOREST 
At the churning of the ocean, when the Kalaku!a poison, dark and 
flaming, rose from the water and Siva swallowed it, a mark of somber 
beauty was left on his throat. The moment of the rising of the poison 
from the waters was a portentous one; it marked the transition from 
potentiality to act. Formed in the waters, the poison coagulated under 
the violence of the avidity of the churning gods and demons; a glis­
tening, viscous lump surged and, with its flames, engulfed heaven and 
earth. This was the anger itself of Rudra. 
When Rudra emerged from the waters into which he had plunged 
in response to the command of Brahma, his anger rose when he saw 
this command executed by another, by Dakia. In fury he tore off his 
phallus, drawing the extreme consequence of his asceticism (MBh. 
10. 1 7. 1 0-23). Siva practiced asceticism while under water; when he 
emerged he acted as the destroyer (cf. MBh.7. 1 73'{j7-99), his hair 
"red as the rays of newborn sun, / like flame arising from the ripened 
heat / of his ascetic trance"! (Subh.4.26). The god cast his linga on 
earth, and the earth received it as she had received the semen of 
Pr̼apati. 
In the beginning, Rudra violated the procreative act of the Father. 
N?w he did violence to his own procreative member, the target of the 
anger that Dakia had provoked. From this moment, Dakia became 
the antagonist of Rudra, who henceforth was confronted with two 
procreative figures against whose existence he played his consistent

roles. However, not Dakia but Rudra's own phallus was the immedi­
ate victim of the rage that inflamed his ascetic nature (MBh. 1O. 1 7.20-
24). At this extreme moment, Rudra no longer observed the vow of 
brahmacarya. He severed its instrument, and this was not the only time 
that the linga of the Great God, the Lord of Yoga, was severed. The 
linga was torn off another time and fell on the earth in the forest of 
Deodar trees. The body and the life of Siva are only metaphors. Al­
though anthropomorphic references bring the god nearer to human 
understanding, that likeness to man does not limit him by contingen­
cies of body or time or the imperfections of the human condition. 
Tradition is not unanimous on how and when the Lord came to the 
forest of Deodar trees. Deodar literally means "God wood." God 
Agni, the Fire, on becoming the priest of the gods, shook off his body. 
His bones became the Deodar tree (BD'7.75-78). A hidden fire burnt 
within and sustained the mighty evergreen trees in the forest where 
the linga of the Lord fell. 
In this retreat, sages, with their families lived the life of recluses, 
observing the established rites. The peace of the hermitage was inter­
rupted when a young stranger appeared on the scene, a naked yogi 
smeared with ashes, holding out his begging bowl for alms. Irresisti­
bly fascinated, the wives and daughters of the riis rushed to bring him 
fruits and other food (KiiP.2.37. 1 - 1 3; VmP, SM.22'53-58; SP.4. 1 2.g-
1 1). He excited them so much that they were beside themselves. His 
attraction was such that he seemed extraordinarily handsome (VmP, 
SM .22.59-6 1 ;  LP. l .2g. 10) or, on the contrary, he looked horrible with 
terrific, painted teeth (BP . 1 .2.27. 1 1 ). "His penis and testicles were like 
red chalk, the tip ornamented with black and white chalk" (BP. 
1.2.27. 12).2 The Pural)ic descriptions suggest one who seemed to ob­
serve dreadful vows and practices. Yet, the wives and daughters of the 
sages were driven mad with passion. They took hold of his hands, em­
braced him and lost all self-control (SP .4. 1 2 . 1 2-13). They had always 
been exemplary in their way of life, but now they knew no restraint. 
Their hair disheveled, shedding their ornaments and clothes 
(KiiP.2.37. 1 4-15), they could not tear themselves away from the in­
truder. Sometimes he laughed, sang, and danced beautifully; some­
times he roared repeatedly (BP. 1 .2.27. 1 3); he was naked, his hair was

horripilating, his penis large (MBh. 13, app. 1, no. 4, lines 66-67). In 
this manner he sported with the wives and the daughters of the sages. 
The nis, bewildered, pained, and infuriated, asked the strange 
mendicant his name. He remained silent. Outraged and stupefied, 
the sages did not recognize him (SP,jS'42 . 1 3-15)' 
Some say that the sages pulled out his phallus (VmP, SM.22.68), 
others that they made it fall by their curse (VmP .6.65; SP.4. 1 2. 17; SP, 
jS .42 . 1 6), still others that they ordered him to castrate himself 
(KUP.2.37.38-41 ; cf. SkP.6. 1 .20). But it is also said that only he could 
do so (BP. 1 .2.27.30-33). 
The sages had been stupefied and deluded for their own good by 
Siva's power of illusion (maya) (cf. SP .4. 1 2. 1 1). He put them to the 
test, and they did not recognize him. In one version of the story found 
in the Vamana PUra'IJa, his visit to the hermitage in the Deodar forest 
was an act of grace at Vma's request (VmP, SM.22'45-52). The sages 
were ascetics only because they observed established conventions. 
They failed when the Lord tested them with his outrageous ways and 
inner calm. But the women were fascinated; they were drawn to him, 
seeing him in beauty or in ugliness, both equally seductive. They came 
closer to him than the sages, though they too were deluded. They 
were aroused to erotic frenzy while he remained calm. He paid no 
heed to his effect on them (VmP, SM.22.53-68). He was a yogi, he had 
come begging in fulfillment of a vow; or he had been wandering 
about like one insane; his passion had burnt itself out in longing and 
grief for dead Sati, his wife, who had consumed her body in flames 
(VmP.6.26-2g, 58-66). It was after this or another, even more pro­
found, crisis that Siva came to the forest of Deodar trees. 
Images of Siva cast in bronze or carved in stone show him as Bhi­
kiatana, the supreme mendicant. They celଧrate the nakedness of the 
god. In them the Great God is shown not with the urdhvalinga, large, 
raised, and controlled by yoga, but, on the contrary, with the phallus 
small and pendant. 3 
It was Siva's purpose to enlighten the false sages by allowing them 
҉o humiliate him. It was an act of grace on his part (BP . 1.2.27. 1O; 
SP+ 1 2 . 1 1 ), but they were lost in anger (VmP, SM.22.67, 74). The 
Lord allowed himself to be assaulted and beaten by them. He ac-
3 D. Barrett. Early Cola BranuJ. pis. 4 1 , 53. 10 1 .  

1 5 6 ' UNGA 
cepted humiliation in the image that met the eye of the sages, as he 
had let himself be humiliated at the place of the sacrifice (Ch. IlI.2.b). 
He willed his linga to fall, and, unwittingly, the sages were his instru­
ments when they made it fall. Or he tore it out himself, as he did when 
he had risen from the waters. There he severed it as an instrument of 
procreation. In his play in the Deodar forest, he severed it as an in­
strument of lust. The severance of the phallus was the purpose of his 
play. He played convincingly. Though he revealed his true nature 
when he danced, yet so great was his power to delude that the nis did 
not recognize him. Even though he appeared horribly fascinating, 
holding firebrands in his hands (BP. 1 .2.27. 1 1-1 3), proclaiming him­
self as fire, these signals did not identify him. Though he aroused the 
women as the source of their desire, they were unable to see him as 
the killer of all desire (cf. MBh. 13. 17.51 ). They would touch but could 
not hold him who was free in frenzy and divine madness, the still core 
of the flame. 
The linga of the Great God fell (VmP, SM .22.68). He threw it on the 
surface of the earth and vanished from the sight of the sages. All 
things, moving and unmoving, were destroyed (VmP, SM.22.6g). The 
linga broke through the earth into the netherworld and went to the 
very sky (VmP .6.67; SP -4- 1 2.20; SP ,jS .42. 1 7- 1 8; SkP .6. 1 . 2 1 ). The ter­
rible, the marvelous linga of Siva turned into the linga that pervades 
the iikiiSa, and whose beginning and end Brahma and ViiI:lu cannot 
reach (SP, DhS .49.82-85). Severed, it is the same great phallus that 
the brahmaciirin of the Atharva Veda introduced into the earth 
(AV. l 1 .5.1 2). Then its pillar shape was seen extending from heaven 
to earth. Now it is seen rising from below, from the netherworld to 
the sky. One way or the other, it is seen in its cosmic integrity. 
Even though Siva castrated himself by his own hand when he rose 
from the waters, or by his will through the agency or the curse of the 
sages, or once again by his own hand, Siva is not a castrated god. The 
linga may be restored to his body (SkP .6. 1 .47-52 ;  d. VmP .6.84, 93) or 
Siva may refuse to have it restored (d. SkP.7. 1 . 1 87.34-35), indifferent 
to the question of the completeness of the anthropomorphic meta­
phor of his body. 
Yet by such a metaphor, by his naked body, he excited the forest 
dwellers. This was inevitable, for he was not an ordinary young ascetic 
but Siva, and his dark skin glowed with his fire. He showed himself in 

T H E  D E O D A R  FOREST · 1 5 7  
his nakedness, undisguised and incarnate. The women of the sages 
pined to yield to him their carnal selves. The Lord, the Great Yogi, let 
this effect of his have its play, it was part of his unaccountable behav­
ior, by which he shocked the righteous fiis-the establishment-to 
whom the naked truth in the immediacy of self-revelation was strange 
and suspect. 
This is how the Great God in the Deodar forest sported with the 
wives and daughters of the fiis. Deluded by his maya, they did not see 
that this great ascetic was free to play on lust as an instrument for pur­
poses of his own. Calmly he accepted the consequences of the effect 
that he had created in the minds of the nis. He had provoked their 
false accusations and welcomed their assault, which precipitated the 
fall of the linga and fulfilled the purpose of the Great God. He van­
ished, and then the linga traversed the cosmos. 
BhikiaŽana, the Supreme Beggar, ambiguously naked, phallic, and 
ascetic, startled the sages and their women, and they transgressed all 
bounds, swayed by frenzy and fury. Had they noticed his begging 
bowl? It was a skull stuck to his palm (KUP.2·31 .64, 73). 
Siva, the Lord, the naked beggar in disguise, inscrutably seductive 
(LP . 1 .29.9- 1 2), took them out of themselves and readied them for the 
climax, the severance of his phallus. 
Images of Siva in stone and bronze, other than those of BhikiaŽana, 
differentiate Siva from other gods when they show his mighty urdhva­
l٧nga. But as a rule, images of Siva, like those of other gods, are shown 
wearing rich jewelry and garments around the loins that deemphasize 
the presence of the linga. However, the linga is not meant to be absent, 
as is the case in images of the Buddha, on whose figure the organs of 
sex are said to have withdrawn.4 Their absence is one of the signs of 
the mahapurU$a, the Buddha as supernal being:;JIn other images, the 
linga is not erect, or its shape is concealed by garments and orna­
ments, but it is meant to be there. 
Siva as BhikiaŽana, Supreme Beggar, a form he had assumed when 
he visited the Deodar forest, is represented naked. The sky is his gar­
ନent; yet he wears ornaments. A serpent is coiled around his hips.

His linga is not raised-it conveys neither lust nor yogic control. Siva 
as Bhikiatana, in the tradition of the image makers, appears in divine 
spontaneity, aloof from the emotions that his maya provoked in the 
riis and their women. 
Siva willed his phallus (linga) to fall. Now it was separated from his 
body. This cognizance (linga) of the Great Lord would be seen by the 
gods in flaming glory, and the sages would worship it on earth (VmP, 
SM.23.9- 1 1 ), its shape of stone-or any other material-meted out in 
proportions of sacred geometry. It would rise through the millennia, 
as an abstract shape that implies the invisible presence of the Lord in 
the innermost sanctuary of a temple, the edifice surrounded on the 
outside by the many images in which Siva is seen as the main actor in 
his cosmic play. 
2. TRANSFIGURATION OF THE Linga: 
THE PILLAR OF FLAMES 
With Rudra's castration a cycle came to a close. It started at the begin­
ning of time with Rudra, the hunter, who shot his arrow of fire right 
into the copulation of the Father and the daughter. Now Rudra, the 
cosmic ascetic, turned against himself and did violence to his own or­
gan of sex. He severed it from his body, or the deluded sages in the 
Deodar forest were instrumental in its fall. The linga fell and pro­
ceeded to burn everything' in its path. Wherever it went, it burned 
(SP , jS.42. 16- 1 7). It broke through the earth into the netherworld, 
and thence up to the sky (SP+ 1 2. 1 7-20). Out of Rudra's mouth 
flames had come; they turned into demons, ghosts, and yogis 
(VrP .33.8). The demoniac, ghostly, and ascetic ambience of flames 
that Rudra exhaled into a burning universe was a prelude to the sov­
ereign, awful grandeur of the cosmic fire linga. Flaming, soaring with­
out beginning or end, its power loomed in the dark night of a world 
that had ended; the flaming linga pillar was its one and only light. 
A fter the fall of the linga to the ground, it rose in its own right, aflame 
in darkness, with consuming power, from the netherworld. It ex­
tended into heaven, whence the golden shaft of sunlight had de­
scended into the cosmic waters of another aeon, impregnating them 
with the limpid sheen of Rudra's presence. 
The descent of the impregnating light of heaven and the counter 
thrust of the ascending, flaming, phallic pillar are visionary com ple-

ments. As soon as the linga had fallen, Rudra, the Lord of Yoga, left 
the scene and retreated into the solitude of Mount Miijavat, where he 
practiced further austerities. 
The fertilization of the waters by the light from beyond was an im­
pregnation of matter with spirit. From it the plants were born, the 
staff of life, wherein Rudra's presence would feed mankind. The 
fallen phallus of Rudra, transfigured as cosmic phallic pillar flaming 
upward from the netherworld into heaven, was the counter player of 
the light from beyond. The pillar rose in the cosmic night in terrible 
splendor from immeasurable depths. 
In the darkness of the flood, it was seen by Brahma and Viil,1u. In 
the total homogeneity of a dissolved universe, Viil,1u and Brahma 
were arguing over their relative supremacy when they were inter­
rupted suddenly by the superluminous glow of a strange pillar of fire. 
Joined by Brahma, Viil,1u sped toward the indescribable flaming light, 
which grew before their eyes into infinity, rending heaven and earth. 
Overwhelmed and terrified by their unfathomable vision, the two 
gods sought the beginning and end of its burning immensity. 
Brahma, flying upward with the wings of his bird shape-the wild 
gander--'-Could not see its top, nor could Viil,1u, diving down for a 
thousand years in his shape of a boar, see the bottom of that fire linga 
of him who is the light and destruction of the universe. Both of the 
bewildered gods returned exhausted to the level they had started 
from, and within the flaming linga they beheld Siva in golden glory. 
He illumined the dark flood, and the two gods, Viil,1u and Brahma, 
bowed before him. Thunderous laughter, or the sound AUM, issued 
from the pillar, filled the sky, and Siva dispelled their fear (V liP ·55· 13-
57; Cf. LP. 1 . 1 7·32-59; cf. KuP . 1 .25·67- 101). 
Rudra's theophany in the linga took place in the int(:lYval between 
the destruction and reabsorption of one world age and the beginning 
of a new aeon. In the darkness of the flood, there were only two wit­
nesses to the spectacle. They were Brahma and Viil,1u, each unable to 
fathom the greatness of the flaming pillar. 
The epiphany of Rudra in the flaming linga was his self-revelation 
. as Agni, the glowing, flaming pillar of fire connecting heaven and 
earth. That is how he arose on the altar of Asvatthaman. When Agni 
comes through the sun-door from heaven to earth, he is the celestial 
light that glistens on the surface as he enters the waters. 
Agni travels between heaven and earth, but when the god tires of 

1 6 0 · Ll NGA 
his work as the messenger of the gods to men and of men to gods, he 
takes creative rest in the waters, as Rudra did before he arose and sev­
ered his phallus. Fallen to the ground, the linga sank into the earth. It 
cleft its way into the netherworld, and from this subterranean region 
of unprobed extent it shot upward, a flaming sign of Rudra's pres­
ence. It was the sign (linga) and at the same time the phallus (linga) of 
Rudra. It had no end and no beginning, but it had direction, flaming 
upward as does the earthly fire, pointing upward as does the linga of 
the ascetic, whose semen is consumed ascending by his tapas within his 
body. Transfigured, the detached creative limb, in its transcendent au­
tonomy, revealed to the gods Rudra's presence within its flames. The 
gods bowed to the Great God, the mystery of whose linga they could 
not fathom. 
In the flaming linga sign and abode, Siva manifested himself to the 
gods. The linga appeared like a hundred fires of dissolution, with a 
thousand garlands of flame, void of decrease or increase, with no be­
ginning, middle, or end (SP.2. 1 .7.48). Humbled and overawed by its 
mystery, the gods accepted its presence and bowed to it. Then Siva's 
revelation to the gods by revealing himself through the linga of fire, 
which their minds first failed to grasp, had for its setting the cosmic 
night of dissolution, whence a new world would arise again. The linga 
of fire was its herald. It was the transfiguration of the severed phallus 
of Siva. Having torn out the organ of procreation, and having let the 
instrument oflust fall to the ground, the Great God vanished from the 
scene. He revealed himself in glory within the transfigured linga to 
the gods who bowed to him (SP, DhS . 10. 1 2-16, 22-24). His ambience 
was fire, to which the linga had lent its pillar shape. The Great God 
himself was at its core. The two gods saw him. By divine sight they 
saw what no human eye can see and no words can define: the source 
of the light in the flames of the cosmic linga. 
3. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE Linga ON EARTH 
Within the cosmic, flaming linga, Siva was seen by the gods in the vast 
darkness of the night of dissolution. So that he could be realized 
within the linga here on earth, the linga fallen in the Deodar forest 
was taken up by an elephant in its linga-like trunk. Siva himself had 
assumed for this purpose the shape of an elephant. The linga was 

E ST A B L I S H M E N T  O N  E A RT H ' 1 6 1  
transported by him from the Deodar forest, where neither the gods 
nor the sages could lift it, to a lake where grew a great banyan tree, 
the embodiment of SthalJ.u. There Brahma established a stone linga 
on the primordial linga, which the elephant had set down and by 
which the stone became illumined. The lake where this and other mir­
acles happened became the primordial tirtha or place of pilgrimage. 
There liberation was attained by the sight of the linga and the touch 
of the banyan tree (VmP, SM.22·7- 1 1, 37-38; 23·9-34; 24. 1 7-25). 
SthalJ.u, rooted as a banyan tree in the middle of the lake of the pri­
mordial tirtha, and the stone linga, reinforced the presence of Siva 
here in this world. In the age-old symbols of omphalos stone and tree 
at the SaqInihatya lake, Siva henceforth was accessible to man. 
The banyan tree as SthalJ.u, the primordial linga in the waters as 
Siva himself submerged in them, the omphalos stone as a replica of 
the primordial linga, are transparent in their several meanings, one 
sliding over the other. Across them shines the holiness of the tirtha 
toward which the Siva elephant had carried the felled linga in his 
trunk, which resembled a linga. 
The mystery of the metamorphosis of the severed phallus of the 
god into a pillar of flames reverberated in the liberating sound AUM 
(cf. LP . 1 . 1 7.49). It rang across the vastness of the cosmic night as Siva 
revealed himself from within the linga to Brahma and ViilJ.u. 
The vision of the flaming linga seen by the gods and the legend of 
the establishment of the stone linga in the SaqInihatya lake introduced 
the worship of the linga. 
The mystery of the stone linga set down by the Siva-elephant in the 
Sarpnihatya lake goes deeper than this legend: it was in the water of 
this lake that Rudra had been immersed in yogic trance. When he 
emerged, he tore out his linga in fury. He hurled it down into the lake 
and it stood there erect. Ever since, the linga has been known as 
SthalJ.u (VmP, SM.28.22-34). Like a magnet, the SaqInihOt'Ya (tirtha 
drew to itself the two myths of the fallen linga. Overlapping, they in­
tensified the sanctity of the stone linga set up to be worshiped on 
earth. 
1t is also said that the gods overcame Siva's reluctance to take back 
the severed linga. He agreed to carry it if gods and men would wor­
ship it. Thereupon the gods set up the Linga and worshiped it 
(SkP .7. 1 .55-62). In one way or another, in one tirtha or another, linga 
worship became established on earth.

4. THE MEANING OF THE Linga 
In the cosmic night of an earlier age, the Padma Kalpa or Lotus aeon, 
Siva also had revealed himself to Brahma and Viil).u. Viil).u was lying 
on the serpent "Endless," his couch in the vast flood full of darkness. 
A large lotus had grown from his navel, and he was playing with it 
when Brahma happened to come by. The two gods, benumbed by 
Siva's maya, did not quite recognize each other, though Viil).u intro­
duced himself, saying that the whole universe was his realm, while he 
noticed that Brahma had the universe for his body. Brahma then said 
that he too was the demiurge. Viil).u wondered and, with Brahma's 
consent, entered through Brahma's mouth and saw all the worlds 
contained within the belly of Brahma. He roamed through them for 
a thousand years and, after coming out of the mouth of Brahma, he 
invited Brahma to enter his belly. Brahma then found all the worlds 
within Viil).u's body. Viil).u had gone to sleep, however, and Brahma 
could find no way out except through the lotus stalk in Viil).u's navel. 
Brahma seated himself in the shining lotus flower (LP . 1 .20. 1-32). 
While Brahma and Viil).u were arguing about their relative great­
ness and precedence, Siva had appeared wading across the flood. 
Winds blew hot and cold and shook the lotus flower; they were Siva's 
breath. As his agitated body rapidly splashed through the ocean, his 
fangs gleamed in his huge face, surrounded by his disheveled hair. 
He tossed masses of water to the invisible sky. He had ten arms and 
eyes going all around him. With his huge phallus erect, he roared ter­
ribly. Clad in pure golden raiments and wearing a girdle of munja 
grass, he held a trident. Brahma did not recognize him, but Viil).u 
knew he was the cause of the universe, the possessor of the seeds and 
their light. Viil).u beheld Lord Siva by the splendor of his great yoga 
(LP . 1 .20·33-37, 59-62, 69-73)' 
Then Viil).u explained to Brahma how Brahma himself had sprung 
from Siva through Viil).u, into whose womb Siva had placed the shin­
ing seed (LP . 1 .20.78-82). Though this theogony, in praise of Siva, 
seems to run counter to the mythic account of Siva having sprung 
from Brahma, it is valid in a context that sees Siva as the timeless 
cause and origin from which the Creator himself has sprung. The ap­
parent reversal of the relation of Brahma and Siva results from two 
different levels of speaking about Siva. In one, the gods act as anthro­
pomorphic symbols, in the other they are ontic realities. Siva, as cause 

M EA N I N G O F  T H E  LINGA 
• 1 63 
of causes and source of all creativity, is the cause of Brahma's being. 
Siva-Rudra reveals his causality by successively playing the roles of 
Agni, who prepared the seed for the father (Ch. I), and of the crying 
child on the lap of Brahma (the Creator and his father) (Ch. V). 
In the cosmic night of the Padma Kalpa, Siva in ebullient abandon 
splashed the waters of the flood. He appeared on a lower level of re­
alization than that of his manifestation from within the flaming linga 
pillar during the cosmic night of another Kalpa (VaP.SS.1 3-S7). He 
appeared, also, on a lower level of mythic significance, and with less 
depth of meaning than in the tale of his immersion in the calm waters 
in which he chose to plunge in response to Brahma's command 
(MBh. 1O. 1 7· 1O-26). 
Yet the knowledge of the two stations in the waters is subjacent to 
the baroque epiphany of the Lord as the bearer of seed agitating the 
waters of the cosmic night of the lotus aeon. Siva showed the paradox 
of his nature here: the wild potency of sex surging through his enor­
mous body, distending his phallus. This potency sharpened his fangs 
and tossed his mane of hair, while he was clad in pure golden rai­
ments and girt with an ascetic's belt. For he, "the possessor of seed," 
is the goal of ascetics (LP . 1 .20.72,73). As fire, Agni, he had prepared 
the seed for the Father (RV. 1 .71 .S, 8). His fire glowed in the immense 
linga pillar that appeared in the cosmic night preceding the present 
kalpa. But, in this night preceding an earlier aeon, he was clad in 
gold, and illumined the flood as he irradiated the waters in whose 
depth he had practiced tapas. The roaring epiphany of his sex­
charged shape, though clasped by an ascetic's girdle, was an anticli­
max to his form of Sthar:lU, the ascetic, a motionless pillar. But its ex­
uberant shape was the necessary complement whence his asceticism 
derived nourishment. Sex is the fuel of the fiery ardor of asceticism. 
It would burn itself out in arid waste if not sustained by the pdwer of 
sex, which it consumes and transforms. Siva shows these forms of his 
nature at will, they being at one within him. Thus, agitated, roaring, 
shining, the Lord was seen by the demiurges. He showed himself ten­
armed and seeing with innumerable eyes. Whatever may be the num­
ber'ofhis eyes, arms, or heads, he is the god who reveals and also sev­
ers his one and only phallus. 
The stone linga of Siva has been set up in the center of the inner­
most sanctuary of every Siva temple over the last two thousand years. 
The linga has been worshiped as a vertical stone, "grown by itself' 

1 6 4 • LlNGA 
from the ground (svayambhuva "self-existent"), and most sacred. Or it 
is a portable pebble smoothed into shape by the waves of a river. Or 
a shape made by the hand of man in clay, wood, stone, precious 
stones, or metal. A linga can be made of any material. It can be seen 
and worshiped anywhere: "even the circular luminous spot which the 
sun casts on a mirror, and which, for its resemblance to the shape of 
a lingam is called the phallic emblem of the solar rays" (AP'54.6).5 A 
linga is tied to the body of the newborn child in a Virasaiva or Lin­
gayat family, and every Lingayat wears throughout his life a linga, 
which is kept in a silver receptacle hung from around the neck; this 
"linga represents the wearer's soul, which is not different from the 
divinity, Siva."6 Less ostensibly, the linga is fixed in the heart of yogis 
(KiiP .2. 1 1 .94, 98), and in South India a linga is set up above the place 
of burial of a sannyiisin. 7 
Linga-like shapes of clay have been found in Mohenjo-daro and 
Harappa.8 They would date as far back as the seal discussed earlier, 
with the figure of a god whose phallus is shown pointing upward, in 
tune with the yoga posture (iisana) of the body. 
As A. Bharati has pointed out, the ithyphallic shape, as part of a 
figure represented in a yoga posture (iisana), would be inconsistent if 
interpreted as in "priapic" condition. The ithyphallic representation 
of the erect shape connotes the very opposite in this context. It stands 
for "seminal retention," and it represents Siva as "he stands for com­
plete control of the senses, and for supreme carnal renunciation."9 
The yogi does not deny sex, rather he transforms sexual urge and di­
rects it away from procreation and pleasure toward intuited wisdom, 
toward freedom and bliss. The ascetic god, whose seed is raised up, 
whose linga is raised up (MBh. 1 3. 1 7.45), is one with, though he stands 
at the other pole from, the god who is the bearer of seeds. The one 
creates the world of pleasure and pain, the other liberates from it. 
Their polarity is not that of eros and thanatos, of love and death, but 
of desire (kama) and liberation (mokńa). Between these two poles Siva 
stretches the path of yoga, of which he is the lord. On this diameter

of his boundless ambience the god operates at every point. There, in 
one of his modes, he is Time (Kala), and, being Time, who consumes 
life, he is Death (Kala). Once a part of his role was delegated to a god­
dess who resembled him (MBh.7, app. 1 ,  no. 8, lines 1 1 3-3 1 ). But the 
god who shows himself as Time-and-Death would not be Siva if he 
did not rule over Time-and-Death and overcome both. A legend tells 
of Siva breaking out of the linga in which he had been immanent. The 
Lord saved from death young MarkaQQeya, his devotee, who was 
doomed to die at the age of sixteen. When Death approached the lad, 
who was worshiping the linga, Siva appeared and warded off its 
threatening figure. Siva blessed MarkaQQeya to be always sixteen 
years old, an immortal youth (cf. SP.7. 1 .30.48)}O And when the sage 
Sveta, whom Death had bound, called out Rudra's name, Death asked 
him, "Where is your Rudra? . . .  Is he in the linga?" Siva appeared and 
Death freed Sveta (LP. 1 .30. 15-2 1). 
Is Siva in the linga the source of life that gives eternal youth? He 
saved from death and had the power to bring the dead back to life. In 
one version of his myth, Bhargava installed and worshiped a linga in 
order to obtain the spell for the resuscitation of the dead. He exerted 
himself in terrible austerities, and finally Siva came out of the linga. 
Bhargava / Sukra praised him as Siva the god of eight forms and the 
fire and· the giver of calm at every step. Siva gave to Bhargava the 
mrtasaiijivani mantra, by which the dead are brought back to life 
(SP.2·5·50. 1- 18, 23, 27, 41-43). The mrtyuiijaya mantra coalesced with 
the Saiijivanl spell. Similarly, it was by the linga form (lingarupa) that 
Siva resuscitated the gods and demons killed by the Kalakiita poison. 
By his mercy, they arose as though from a deep sleep (SkP. 1 .  1 .  10.5 1-
55)· Does the linga contain the god who is the source and secret of 
life? Siva revealed himself to the gods in the flaming linga pillar. 
( 
The linga is the object of the greatest sanctity, more sacred ଩n any 
anthropomorphic image. It is set up in the innermost sanctuary of 
every Siva temple. The earliest sculptures that are definitely identifi­
able as Siva-lingas are from GUQimaliam in South Indial! and from 
MatJura, 12 and show a pillar shape; the rounded top is demarcated 
and clearly represents the glans, so that the shaft represents not only

a pillar but also a phallus. Moreover, Siva stands in front of the linga, 
his back contiguous with its ascending shape; the phallus of the an­
thropomorph is shown pendant in the Gu<;limallam sculpture, and as 
urdhvalinga in the Mathura figure.13 Subsequently, the rounded tops 
of the pillars were given different curvatures, representing different 
conic sections, with the shaft subdivided into three sections according 
to geometrical propositions. The total shape of the linga rises as a 
stark, geometrically proportioned volume. 
The form of and the verbal references to the linga are charged with 
complex meaning. "Brahma has for his cognizance (anka) the lotus. 
For ViiQu it is the discus; and Indra has for his cognizance the thun­
derbolt. But the creatures of this world do not have any of the signs 
that distinguish these gods. On the other hand, all creatures have a 
linga (penis) or a bhaga (womb). Hence all creatures of this world must 
be thought of as belonging to Siva and to his consort" (MBh. 1 3. 1 4, 
note 102, insert 1 1 3, lines 1-2). The consort of Siva has not as yet been 
considered. She is essential, though not in the primordial morning of 
Rudra's attack of the Father in the ongoing myth of Siva. Indeed, it is 
said in the Kena UPañad that "Uma, the daughter of Himavat, who 
being always in the company of the all-knowing Lord (Mahadeva) had 
the power of knowing brahman,"14 which is here supreme knowl­
edge, and that she explained the marvelous appearance of brahman 
as a yaÑa to Indra (KUP.3. 1-2; 3. 1 2 ;  4. 1 ).15 
The linga of Siva has three significations. They are linga as sign; 
linga as phallus, and linga as cosmic substance ( prakrti or pradhiina), 
which is the subtle body (linga sarira) of Siva, who is the absolute real-

sort of Rudra as they appear in the pre-epic texts. Excepting Uma-Haimavati, hardly 
anything but their names is known. The names of Rodasi and the Prsni cow have to be 
added, and their significance in relation lO Rudra and the Maruts has yet to be clarified. 
Rudra's "paternity" of the Maruts, the mother being Prsni (RV.2.34-2 ;  5.52. 16; 5.60.5; 
6.66,3), is of a special kind, for the Prsni cow is also a bull (cf. A. Bergaigne, La Religion

suggests Rudra as the male half of the androgynous cow-bull, and that this would an­
ticipate Siva, the androgyne. The progenitive cow-bull, PrSni, however, corresponds to 
the progenitive bull-cow Tva˘δr-Savitr-Visvarupa (RV.3.38-4,8), rather than to Agoi, 
the self-perpetuating bull-cow.

ity, "the imperishable Puruia" (LP . 1 .20.70). The original meaning of 
the word linga is "sign," a mark that proves the existence of a thing. 
Thus, the Svetasvatara Upan4ad, where this word is used for the first 
time in the sacred tradition, says that Siva, the supreme lord, has no 
linga or mark (SUp.6.g), meaning that he is transcendent, beyond any 
characteristic. As a distinguishing mark, linga also means a character­
istic and, specifically, the sign of gender or sex.16 Linga, "sign," not 
only signifies the existence of perceptible things, but also denotes the 
imperceptible essence of a thing even before the thing in its concrete 
shape has come to exist. Thus the form of fire, which exists in the kin­
dling stick in a latent form, may not be seen, yet its linga is not de­
stroyed but may be seized again by another kindling stick (SUp. 1 . 1 3). 
Fire in its latent condition, unkindled, the potential of fire, its imper­
ceptible essence, is the linga of fire, in contrast with and indispensable 
to its visible form (riipa). The imperceptible essence of a thing, in its 
potentiality, is the linga of the thing. The insight of the Svetasvatara 
Upan4ad conveyed through the word linga is formulated explicitly in 
the Samkhya and Yoga schools or ways of looking at things (darsana), 
that is, by looking at their appearance and at ultimate reality. Linga 
here denotes the "subtle body" (linga sarira) underlying and ontolog­
ically preceding anything perceptible. The perceptible state, in this 
context, is the gross body (sthiila sarira), or concrete reality as it ap­
pears to the sense organs. In between the ultimate and concrete real­
ity is prakrti, also called pradhana. Out of this imperceptible cosmic 
substance all things have come, and to it they will return. 
As already discussed (Ch. IV. 2), prakrti consists of three gur:tas or 
"strands." They are sattva, rajas, and tamas, and function as tendencies 
through which the principles and powers of cosmic substance cohere. 
The principles are: mahat, "cosmic intelligence or revelation"; 
ahamkara, "individuation"; and manas, "mind." From these e<{Olve ths 
powers (indriya) of cognition that enable hearing, feeling, seeing, tast­
ing, and smelling and their corresponding subtle elements (tanmatra) 
to exist. From these supersensible tanmatras the sense particulars 
(mahabhiita) come into being. They are ether or space, air, fire, water, 
and earth. They are the vehicles of the tanmatras, and constitute the 
gross body of concrete, perceptible, and particularized reality. The 
subtle body (linga sarira) is the subtle prototype of the gross body. It

is the imperceptible stuff of energy by which all phenomena are pro­
jected into concrete reality, like fire from its latency. The subtle body, 
itself changeless, accompanies the life-of-the-individual (jiva) 
through the cycles of births and deaths, and is finally reabsorbed into 
the principles and powers of which it is composed. 
The two demiurges saw Siva in one of the intervals between two 
aeons in the cosmic night of dissolution of the Lotus aeon. They saw 
the bearer of seed (bijin), irradiating the dark cosmic flood with the 
light of his yoga, with the light of his seed (LP . 1 .20.69-70). His huge 
phallus had risen beneath the pure golden raiment cinctured by a gir­
dle of munja grass. 
The anthropomorphic shape functions as the "gross body" of the 
god. It is a superabundant evocation of fierce potency on a cosmic 
scale, and while it appears crassly phallic, it is much more than that. 
Greater in ambience than the vast body of the god is the light around 
him. It vibrates in waves of yoga, it emanates from the seed of Siva, 
under the golden cloth held to the body by the ascetic's girdle. By the 
huge shape, by the many arms, by such quantitative excesses in size 
and number, the superhuman quality of the divine vision is rendered 
in visual terms of fascinating horror. The bearer of the seed rages · 
with the vehemence of sex. 
While the two demiurges, in turn, measured the extent of their do­
main, the cosmos, the Great God shattered their desire for prece­
dence by his self-revelation as the power that inseminates, with his 
light, all creation-to-be. He is the power of creativity. His seed is the 
light. The superhuman phallus carries and emits the light. In his tem­
pestuous appearance in the cosmic night of dissolution, he illumines 
the flood, wading across its waters as he strides on them, a brahmacarin 
in the daylight of a Vedic hymn (cf. AV. l 1 .5.26). The girdle ofmunja 
grass shows him to be a brahmin, an ascetic, even while his body is 
fiercely phallic. The vision of Siva in the fralaya, in the dissolution of 
the cosmos, preceding the Lotus aeon, is an image of the night. In

another mode of his being, Rudra cut off his linga. It fell, sank into 
the earth, to arise in the cosmic night of another kalpa. Within this 
linga Siva revealed himself.

pillar, play around Siva, the changeless, ancient Puruia, the cause of 
the universe (LP . 1 . 20·70). 
In the first myth, the anthropomorphic image harnesses a multi­
plicity of limbs to a body of superhuman proportions, capable of ex­
pressing more than human states and power. In such anthropo­
morphic shapes, the god addresses himself to the devotee and lifts 
him into his being. In the second myth, the sudden and complete 
transition from the god thought of, though not explicitly evoked, in 
the shape of man to that of an inert pillar has the immediacy of a mir­
acle. The pillar shape remains its constant reminder. It is a symbol of 
self-containment in every section of its ascending volume. It rises up­
ward, like the phallus of the yogi who draws his seed upward. Sthii1Ju, 
the pillar, is a symbol in its own volumetric shape. Moreover, it carries 
the connotation of urdhvalinga, the linga or sign that rises upward as 
the seed is withdrawn upwards (urdhvaretas) (cf. MBh. 1 3· 17.45). This 
symbol abrogates any other meaning. The God has entered it totally. 
In the third myth, the pillar rises before the gods. It has no precedent, 
though it has a past. Mysteriously, it flames upward, and from within 
it the god is manifest. Sthii1Ju, the inert post, is a conversion of god 
into pillar. The flaming linga-pillar, in which the god appears, is the 
sheath of a theophany. 
The pillar form of Siva, as such, is a manifestation of the god modus 
geometrico. In this respect it is akin to Ekavratya, the transmundane, 
pyramidal four-sided ma1Jrjala. This pyramid, however, is a monu­
ment to an enthusiastic Vratya!s transformation into Rudra. In that 
pyramid Rudra had his station in the center of its ascending shape 
(AV. 15·5.5),just as Siva is manifest in the linga (MBh. 13. 1 7.74). Siva is 
present in the linga as pillar. The pillar is his symbolic equivalent. Siva 
turned into a pillar and became Sthal:lU. This is one way of realizin& 
his presence in the linga. It presupposes an awareness of the''facred in 
the pillar, whether wooden post or stone. The pillar shape is assimi­
lated to that of the linga, the erect phallus. Or Siva is present in the 
linga, the phallus. The phallus is his symbol. It contains the seed. As 
the seed cannot be seen while in the phallus, so Siva is invisibly pres­
ent-in the linga. The linga is not the Great God: it is the shape in which 
he dwells invisible. The Great God is known within his linga form 
(MBh·7. 1 72.86-go). The linga, or phallus, is the form in and through 
which Siva operates. While it is full with life yet to be, in that very state 
it is restrained; the seed is held drawn up. Siva, "whose seed is drawn 

1 70 • LINGA 
up, whose linga 
is raised" (MBh. 1 3. 17.4S), is a brahmaciirin 
(MBh.13. 1 7.72). He always observes the vow of chastity (brahmacarya). 
The sages, gods, gandharvas, and apsarases always worship his linga 
standing upright (MBh.7. 1 73.84). 
The linga is the phallus of Siva. Siva is in the phallus. God resides in 
whatever is part of god. The erect linga is full of seed. Siva is the car­
rier of the seed. At will, he may release or restrain it. As Lord of Yoga 
he restrains its movement, absorbs the seed in his total being. As the 
Mahiibhiirata expresses it, he is the yogi; he holds the great (cosmic) 
seed; he is one with tapas, fire and fervent self-control; he is one with 
the golden seed (MBh.13.17.39). He effects and is the transition from 
transitive action to an intransitive state. He is God, and he is the seed 
of the universe (MP.47. 1 30). The seed is golden with the radiance of 
light, the radiance of the sun-the inseminator. 17 He is the god of 
four faces; he is seen in the great linga, the beautiful beloved linga; he 
is lord of the linga, lord of the seed, and the maker of the seed 
(MBh. 1 3. 1 7.74-7S). In this paean to the linga he, who from the beginପ 
ning of things had prepared the seed, is known as its lord, whose do,. 
main is the linga-the cosmic substance of things to be, the "subtlଫ 
body" (linga sarira) of all that lives.18 
Siva's linga has many levels. They are worded in metaphor and syn1 
ecdoche, and supported by symbols. Moreover, while these interpenବ 
etrate, they retain their primary significance in mystical coherence 
The meaning of the Siva linga is in the phallus, it is in the pillar, mo.::! 
tionless or Raming, concrete or imagined, just as the linga can be 
shaped in clay, wood, or stone. Its substance, also, can be space itselfଭ 
As such, the iikasa linga is set up in the temple of Chidambaram. Thr 
walls of the sanctuary enclose the presence of Siva in the symbol HI 
iikasa, the first element of manifestation that spreads in all direction:. 
and makes space possible. Akasa penetrates the other four element. 
and all that is manifest. The meaning of the Siva linga is in each of i 
forms, whether verbal or visual. Even more than in any one of the. 
shapes, it is between them, a diapason that vibrates with Siva's pre$l' 
ence, while he is beyond sound, word, and form. It is this that thcJ 
upright shapes proclaim. It is perhaps appropriate that Vma, in t\it

and symbol IS 10 the word lznga Itself, denotmg as It does the sign oj 
sex. This meaning is undeniably given form in the earliest ling 
carved in stone. The significance of linga as the "subtle body" of Siv଱ 
however, was paramount in the sacred tradition, though the phaIli<l 
meaning remained strong. This is clearly worded in the Siva Pura!l4 
in a statement concerning Siva as either ni$kala or sakala (1.5.8-li,L 
The term ni$kala in its ambiguity clarifies the relation of the pillar,i, 
visual and symbolic form, to the conceptual term linga in its meta .. 
physical, as well as phallic, significance. Ni$kala literally means impar 
tite, without parts and, thus, without definable parts, without and be:> 
yond definition. In this latter sense its meaning comprises both tfit 
subtle body (linga sarira, prakrti), and also the unmanifest absolute (q 
linga). Moreover, the term ni$kala in Hindu iconography means ant. 
conic in contrast to sakala, that is, possessed of distinguishable parts,f. 
The anthropomorphic image of the deity is termed sakala, whereat 
the aniconic shape isni$kala (SP . 1 .5.8- 1 1 ). Thus, the Siva Purii1Ja help$ 
to clarify the complex relation of pillar, phallus, and subtle body'ia 
the linga, the "aniconic" symbol of the Supreme Lord. Further, tH6-
Siva Puriirta explains the <lpparition of Siva, the supreme lord, Paritr 
mesvara, in the flaming pilla;-to Brahma and Vii1)u: "He showed Ii. 
own form (rupa) by the form (rupa) of a ni$kala [or aniconic] pillar:" 
Thus, for the welfare of the world, Siva showed his own linga, undi" 
ferentiated from the pillar because of the character of his own ling1l. 
(SP . 1 .5.28-29). 
From that time on, the Siva Puriirta continues, the ni$kala linga arid 
the sakala icon were assigned to Siva alone (SP. 1 .5.30). The icon. 
form of other gods bestows enjoyment, but the iconic and anicort't 
forms of Siva grant enjoyment and release (SP . l  .5.3 1 ). The same tell 
explains that Siva is ni$kala, for he is supreme reality (brahman) itsetf 
(SP . 1 .5. 10). Hence, the ni$kala linga is used in his worship in the in­
nermost sanctuary only. Yet he also has a form in image; his sakdfl 
icons are of many kinds. In the worship of all other gods, the iconie 
(sakala) form is used (SP. 1 .5. 1 1-13, 20-24). Literally, sakala and ni$kO#i.r 
mean, respectively, "with parts" and "without parts." These words, ·ଲ

of the liitga as cult object, the liitga is of the nature of .transcendent 
bliss, and of the nature of knowledge, and it abides in the heart of 
yogis (KUP.2. 1 1 .94). 
The ଳg Veda (RV.7.2 1 .S; 1 0.99.3) disparagingly spoke of those who 
made the penis (siSna) their god. Those people were kept away from 
the Vedic sacrifice. Moreover, Indra slew them. Whoever they were, 
the object of their worship survives to this day in the form of the liitga. 
No other god but Siva is worshiped in the liitga pillar. The other gods 
are worshiped in their icons. Besides the innumerable liitgas, iconic 
images of Siva abound, though no iconic image of Siva occupies the 
center of the innermost sanctuary of a Siva temple. In an apparent 
contradiction, the two forms (iconic and aniconic), are combined to 
illustrate the story of Viil)u and Brahma bewildered by the flaming 
pillar of Siva. In the middle of the flame pillar, Siva reveals himself to 
the gods, as he reveals himself to his devotee. Carved within the liitga 
pillar in a mandorla-like opening, the figure of Siva stands straight as 
a pOSt.21 This visual paradox has intuitive clarity. The small icon of 
the unfathomable god is the cognizance by which god and man are 
able to recognize the presence of Siva himself within the inscrutable 
liitga (see however the juxtaposition of liitga and image, p. 166). 
Saiva sacred tradition assigns different levels in the hierarchy of 
manifestation to the flame liitg() that appeared to the gods in the 
cosmic night and to the liitga set up for worship. The VatulaSuddhii­
gama22 specifies the principles (tattva) and powers (sakli) in direct on­
tological descent from Siva, the ultimate reality, down to the liitga set 
up for worship. Siva, the ultimate reality, is beyond form, limitless, 
and unknowable by any mode of proof. At the end of the destruction 
of an aeon, however, Siva wills his transcendental power (Para Sakti) 
to evolve from him, which is but a thousandth part of himself. From 
a thousandth part of this transcendental power emerges Adi Sakti. 
"the primordial power"; similarly and in succession, the three powers 
of Iccha Sakli, "willing";Jnana Sakli, "knowing"; and Kriya Sakli, "act­
ing" evolve.23 From a tenth part of Para Sakli, "the transcendental 
power," comes the quiddity or principle of Sadasiva, the eternal Siva: 
"it exists everywhere as a subtle divine light, bright as the lightni଴g 
and pervades the space in the universe."24 From a tenth part of Adi

Sakti, the primordial power, the quiddity Isana-Siva evolves. It exists 
as a pillar of the most intense luminosity, like that of a hundred thou­
sand suns, and is called the celestial pillar (divya linga). As everything 
originates from this pillar, it is also called the root-pillar (mula stam­
boo). In the end everything also returns to it. The two highest onto­
logical levels, here called Sadasiva and isana Siva, in the descent from 
Siva, the ultimate, totally transcendent reality, are without form (ni.$­
kala).25 
The quiddity of the third level, proceeding from the power of will­
ing, also exists as a celestial linga. It has the brightness of fire with 
flames of fire flaring around it. This quiddity is no longer without 
form. It is more concrete (murta), and is considered as sakala. On the 
fourth level, or in the fourth stage, the celestial pillar is crystal clear 
and immense. The fifth and last quiddity exists as the linga set up on 
its plinth in the innermost sanctuary of the temple.26 
Myth and doctrine, though cognate, apply the same terms with 
some latitude. The fire pillar, though celestial (divya)-as are its on­
tologically preceding celestial pillars-is, however, no longer consid­
ered to be "without form." The fire pillar is conceived as endowed 
with form, because it had been seen, if only by the gods. The Vatu la­
suddhagama, moreover, describes a figure of Siva. This text beholds 
Siva on the crystal-clear pillar of the next or fourth ontological phase 
or level as four-faced, twelve-eyed, and twelve-armed.27 The icon of 
Siva in the fire linga of the PuratuLS thus rightly occupies the aniconic 
linga. Pura1Ja and Agama differ with regard to the limits they define 
for the realm of form (sakala). The Agama tradition sees the world of 
myth as situated within the world of form and beholds its images as 
concrete (murta). In the last stage, that of physical reality, inhere all 
the ontological principles and powers, for' each level contains within 
itself the powers and principles that in turn preceded it. This ipherent 
ontological hierarchy sanctifies the physical shape of the linga in its 
concrete reality. 
Starting from below the absolute, transcendent Siva, who cannot be 
conceived in any likeness whatsoever, the evolving Siva principles are 
:ouched in terms of light. They correspond to his subtle body (linga 
sarira). All-pervasive, with the imminence of lightning, it exists. It 
then condenses into a pillar, shining with the light of a hundred thou-

sand suns. This concentrate of effulgence is the celestial liitga, the 
root-pillar (mula stambha), whence everything originates and in which 
everything is dissolved. The primordial root-pillar, as yet impercep­
tible (nińkala) to gods and man, prefigures the flaming liitga pillar, 
which is sakala. The gods saw it. With it the fulguration, sunblast, and 
fire miracles in the ideation of the creative process subside in the crys­
tal clarity and sakala immensity of the last of the three "celestial lingas" 
(divya liitga) in which they prefigure the sakala liitga in manifestation, 
in its material body, the sthula sarira set up for worship, or "self exist­
ent." The terminology of the Agamas distinguishes the levels of the 
subtle body itself as nińkala in the two higher levels and assakala in the 
three successively lower planes, whereas the PuralJas consider as ni$­
kala the entire subtle body. The conception ofthe pillar (stambha) trav­
erses all the planes except the highest, which is entirely pervaded by 
the sharp, clear intensity of the light that is Siva. On the next lower 
plane the pillar of light is realized ontologically as the celestial pillar. 
The celestial pillar, by which Isana-Siva is known to exist in the invis­
ible empyrean, has its architectural symbol in the akasa or space 
liitga.28 This akasa liitga does not consist of space. On the contrary, it 
is a solid shape and functions as the finial of the tower (sikhara) on Siva 
temples (AP. I02.4) ; it can be found on such temples in Orissa and 
Andhra Pradesh of the seven;fh to tenth centuries. It rises high in 
space directly above the linga on the ground in the innermost sanc­
tuary, the womb chamber ( garbha-grha) of the temple. 
Returning to the Vatulaiuddhagama, on each of the next two onto­
logical levels, the abstract pillar shape of fire or of crystal is associated 
with an iconic image of Siva-the two planes being considered as sa­
kala. In this context, the clear-cut definition of the Siva PuralJa speakଵ 
of Siva manifesting his own form (svarupa) through the form of a ni$­
kala stambha, an amalgam of pillar, phallus, and subtle body 
(SP. l ·5·28-29)· 
The combination of the conceptual form, as in the Vatulaiuddhii٥ 
gama, of the liitga and iconic figure stems from the purpose that these 
different visions and visualizations serve. They are symbols that sup­
port and evoke the presence of Siva, the ultimate reality, the unman­
ifest, invisible, and unknowable source of creation. The purpose is 
fulfilled by the stereometric liitga and the icon. They belong to the 
reaIm of form (ropa), the realm of art in the age of the PuralJas.

In the great rock-cut cave temple of Siva in Elephanta, the linga, a 
cylinder rounded off on top, rises in stark purity within the small in­
nermost sanctuary in the same spacious hall where, in supreme gran­
deur, the partly iconic shape of Sadasiva (Pis. 1 ,  2, 4), integrating 
within its structure the verticality of the linga, presents in subtlest nu­
ances of form the innermost essence of Siva. Myth, ontology, and art, 
interrelated creative modes of the realization of Siva, incorporate het­
erogeneous traditions and convert them into complex, startlingly co­
herent immediacy. 
The linga in the abstract stereometry of its evocative phallic shape 
is an ontological symbol. It holds the unmanifest and invisible source 
of creativity. The image of Sadasiva in Elephanta (PI. 4), created from 
within this source, gives form to it. As the gods of the raudra brahman 
of the IJ.g Veda carved Rudra-Vastoipati out of a mantra, so did the 
sculptor of Sadasiva in Elephanta invest this image of Siva, in visible 
terms, with the mystery of the linga. Siva tore out his linga and sepa­
rated from himself the organ of procreation and the instrument of 
lust. The linga touched ground, entered the earth, and flamed on a 
cosmic scale, consuming its substantiality in fire, yet retaining its 
shape, a transmundane sign glowing from the netherworld to the sky 
whence, incandescent, it soared to further horizons imperceptible to 
the eye. The transubstantiation of the severed linga into fire, thence 
into light, is a cosmic analogy to the transmutation of the yogi who 
experiences in himself the reabsorption of the elements of which his 
body is constituted until he obtains a body made of fire (cf. SUP.2. 1 2 ;  
cf. 5S .1 .69 -78) . The flaming linga was seen by the gods; the linga of 
light was within and beyond the flames, beyond and through which 
they could not see. The epiphany of Siva from within the flames en­
lightened them. 
The pillars of flame and light, described in the ViitulaSuddhiigama, 
are precipitations of yogic realizations. The concrete linga, which is 
worshiped here on earth, is the result of the same sequence-in re­
verse-by which the yogi transmutes his body, implying in its materi­
ality (be it clay, stone, or gold) the transcendental, indescribable 
source at its core. 
The motionless pillar of the linga rises from the ground in which it 
is embedded, so that it stands firmly established. 
According to another version, however, the severed linga, fallen to 
the ground, did not come to rest, but moved about, ·burning every-

thing, until it found the yoni or lap of the goddess (SP -4- 1 2 . 1 8-19, 32. 
48). But the combined symbol of linga and yoni presupposes the exist .. 
ence of the Great Goddess, whose entry into the myth of Siva-myth .. 
ically an exit from Siva's body-is an alternative response of the Grea( 
God to Brahma's command that he create mortals. He did not create 
mortals. He is the unknowable source itself of life. The invisible presଶ 
ence of the source is ontologically implied in the concrete shape of the 
symbol linga. This symbol has the shape of a pillar; it resembles a 
phallus and calls to mind the motionless figure of Sthal)u. 
A South Indian legend about a local linga at Kcincipuram tells of 
Siva having destroyed, in the course of one night, everything that ex 
.. : 
isted in creation. He danced and proceeded toward the creation of a. 
new universe. He appeared as a "linga of light." Having entered the 
linga, Siva created all that he had destroyed-nature, stars, gods, manହ 
animals, plants, and so on. After worshiping this linga, Brahmci ob< 
tained the pow\:r of creation.29 
The appareଷt paradox of Brahma, the Creator, obtaining the 
power of creation from the Siva linga has its mythical past in Rudra 
having prepared the seed for the Father. In the legend from Kanel" 
puram, Siva, having danced a dance of creation, enters the linga oi 
light in which he appears. Image enters into symbol. They interpen. 
etrate on the hallowed ground of the linga. 
5. THE Linga AND THE FACE OF SIVA 
The concretization of the supernal light in the material shape, the, 
linga, rises as phallic pillar, a symbol complete in the simplicity of its 
stereometric appearance. Some lingas, however, carry the head 6.p 
Siva, either one head alone, or a head in each of the four directionସ 
and a fifth head, invisible as a rule, but of the highest significance, as: 
its name and position denote. The heads project from the curved 
plane of the pillar, and are modeled from the ears forward. They arϤ 
integrally part of the linga, which they enlarge and whose content 
they make explicit. They are expositions of the meaning of the lingi 
in manifestation, that is of its ontological reality and concrete exist଺ 
ence. Among the mUkhalingas, or lingas combined with the face

(rnukha) of Siva, the four-faced li'ngas predominate. The fifth, invisi­
ble, head is implied in the overall conception. This type of liitga is the 
visual equivalent of the five mantras or brahmans. Inasmuch as a mantra 
is a thought form, particularly one in which deity is felt to be present, 
each of the faces of the li'nga corresponds to one of the five mantras, 
and represents a particular manifestation of Siva. The faces are an­
thropomorphic and are executed in a concrete material. They are im­
ages (milrti) corresponding to mantras. Face-liitgas with one or five 
faces, as the liitga from Bhita shows, are known from the second cen­
tury B.C.30 The five-fold mantra is first known from the Taittiriya AraŅ­
yaka (TA. 1O'43-47), which is assigned to the third century B.C., if not 
earlier. This complex of thought-forms, embodied in representa­
tional shapes, appears as if precipitated into the form of the Panca­
rnukha liitga, in which the "abstract" liitga pillar coalesces with the an­
thropomorphic faces (cf. SayaI)a on TA. 1O'43-47). 
The combination of pillar and head is known in India in several dif­
ferent contexts, the abstract vertical shape ending with or sur­
mounted by the head. To this day, wooden pillars are set up that ter­
minate with a human head. Several varieties of this configuration 
representing a god or deified hero exist in Bihar, in eastern India. 
They show the two component parts, pillar and head, demarcated 
from each other or coalesced, shoulders and arms of the globular 
head merging in low relief with the cylindrical post.31 In this latter 
mode, the fifth head of the stone Bhita liitga rises from the central 
post, to which the four other heads of Siva adhere in low relief. The 
Bhita liitga is exceptional in its coalesced shape of post and figurative 
components. Moreover, the fifth head, on top, is fully carved in the 
round and very conspicuous. As a rule, however, it is present in name 
only, the plain dome shape terminating the liitga. There, the fifth 
head is to be thought of, symbol of an invisible, metaphysical reality. 
While the Bhita liitga incorporates the presence of Siva in the coa­
lescence of pillar and human shape, another liitga, of about the same 
time, in GUQimallam, South India, boldly shows the entire anthropo­
morphic figure of Rudra-Agni standing in front of the towering and 
explicitly phallic liitga.32 Both these visualizations combine abstract

stereometric and anthropomorphic shapes, the phallic associatioli 
being vested in that of the pillar. 
. 
A different combination of vertical and upright head is described; 
in an early Buddhist text. The Mahiikapi Jiitaka relates that the sku" 
of the Buddha, encrusted with gold, was to be set up on the point of 
a lance.33 Though the implications of this memorial have no direct 
bearing on a mukhaliitga, it shows a combination of a vertical object, a 
staff-though not a pillar-with the "human" head. The skull of the 
Buddha, inlaid with gold, the imperishable substance, would indicate 
that the relic and emblem of death had been made a symbol of im .. 
mortality. 
The vertical is the direction of the sacred; it is a symbol of ascenti 
pointing to heaven and transcendent regions. A vertical megalith" 
considered to be th,e seat of the spirit of a dead person and, for thi$: 
reason, a focus of p଻wer, protects the living and ensures the fertility 
of the fields and worl1en. The megalith acts as an instrument of fecunି 
dation in Dravidian and Munda, and also in Bhil, Gond, and othen 
tribal traditions.34 Within Saivism, special sacredness accrues to thel 
sviiyambhuva liitgas. These liitgas, according to the Kiimikiigama, have: 
come into existence by themselves, as their name implies-and are beϣ 
lieved to have existed since time immemorial.35 They are believed not' 
to have been made by the hand of man. Their natural, spontaneous଼ 
apparently inexplicable origin invests the sviiyambhuva, or self-exist; 
ent, stone liitgas with extraordinary sanctity. Inasmuch as the sanctity 
inheres in the natural hardness and durability of stone, the manଽ 
made liitgas partake of it. The enduring quality of stone invests every 
stone liitga as if the primordial substance ( prakrti) were ingrained in 
it. In its wide ambience of associated constituents, the shape of the 
liitga may include urns and vessels made of clay, exhibiting on theit 
walls a likeness of a human face. All these forms and traditions were 
available for or concurred with the conception of the mukhaliitga, a 
precipitate of mantra into visible, tangible form, a solidification of sa­
cred sound.

veys not only the retention of the seed once "stirred" but its upward 
conduction, "through the spinal cord to the brain,"36 retaining its in­
tegrity as creative substance, while being transformed and absorbed 
mentally as bodhicitta, the "thought of Awakening."37 This tantric re­
alization is seen in the mukhalinga or "face-linga ," the two overlapping 
components forming a visual unity, an artistically potent symbol of 
the ascent and transmutation of sexual into mental power, a channel­
ing of the procreative into creative faculty. As if to confirm this an­
cient knowledge, villagers in Girnar, a village about eleven miles from 
Nasik in Maharashtra, told a Peace Corps volunteer that in the winter 
they put woolen scarves around their head in order to keep warm 
their semen that is stored there.3s The belief of village people of the 
present, tantric realization and practice, and the form of the mukha­
linga, though on different levels of awareness, form part of the same 
tradition. The mukhalinga of one or five faces, of which the fifth as a 
rule is invisible, represents an inner realization by symbolic configu­
ration. 
At the same time, the linga, set up for worship, whatever its mate­
rial, is the reification and concrete symbol of the light beyond percep­
tion, a light that took shape so that the eyes of the gods could see it 
wreathed in flames. The symbolical penetration of supernal light and 
its transformation in the concrete material shape of the linga is a proc­
ess cognate with ontological thought. Once the vision of descending, 
condensing light strikes the terrestrial base and assumes concrete ex­
tension, its volume is situated in space. While the vertical direction of 
the pillar remains essential, it is ensconced in matter and takes on vol­
umetric extensiveness. Though the upper part of the linga is circular, 
its lowest part is square; it is oriented in the four directions. This low­
est part is sunk into the ground or into the pedestal of the linga. The 
square section is basic to the linga, although it is not visiqle. As the 
main part of the volumetric shape, the cylindrical shaft with the four 
heads incorporates the theme of the four directions. The heads face 
them in the most explicit iconography, which hinges on the embodied 
equation of mantra and deity, of sacred sound and vision. 
Four is the sacred number of manifestatioୀ and orientation. Five,

• LINGA 
the quintessential number, is not only that of the center but, by verti­
cal extension, of a significance above, and symbolically beyond, the 
realm of the four directions on the terrestrial horizontal plane. Tech­
nically, the linga being a stereometric solid, the fifth head is assigned 
to the top, as in the Bhlୁa liitga. This, however, is an exceptional in­
stance. The paitcamukha linga, of which the texts speak, in its sculp­
tural form shows the four heads encircling the shaft. The top of the 
linga is without a head, for the fifth head of the five-faced, or paitca­
mukha linga is a symbol of Siva in transcendency, invisibly present in 
the pentad. Thus the color of the fifth head is said to be that of crystal. 
Five is the sacred number of Siva. Each of the five "letters" or syl­
lables of the mantra of Siva, nama!; siviiya, has its equivalents on many 
levels of realization, while together the five syllables say "Obeisance to 
Siva," signifying the assent and total commitment to Siva by his dev­
otee. In more expanded thought-forms amounting to verbally artic­
ulate incantations of Siva, the paitcabrahmans invoke, one by one, five 
different forms of Siva. They are Sadyojata, Vamadeva, Aghora, Tat­
puruia, and Isana. They are represented by the five faces of Siva, 
which have their correspondents in the five elements, in the five 
senses, in the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action39 
(see chart). "One should know all things of the phenomenal world as,. 
of a fivefold character, for the reason that the eternal verity of Siva is 
of the character of the fivefold Brahman" (pBUp.31 ).40 Siva, in man­
ifestation, is perceived in the five senses and in the five elements. He 
dwells in each, as he is in the five organs of actions, from those of sex 
to those of speech (LP .2.14. 1 -3 1 ). 
The eight reaiities of Siva, as AiŽamurti, constitute the cosmos. The 
five mantras, the paitcabrahmans, of which the five-faced linga is the 
concrete shape, hold the total reality of Siva, transcendent and im­
manent. It is realized within man, the microcosm, himself image and 
also part of the cosmos. The four visible faces of the linga are directed 
toward the world in which man lives, and in which each of the faces 
of god has its own countenance. 
Sadyojata is "born all at once." His is possibly the one and only face 
looking out from an ekamukha linga (a linga with one face only). It con­
fronts the devotee as existence itself, for Sadyojata, whose mantra is

the first of the pentad, is invoked in it as Bhava, existence. The face 
of Existence appears a miracle of sudden eruption into this world of 
the senses from the side of the pillar-shaped body of the linga. Ac­
cording to the Linga PuratLa, his appellation is a secret word of power 
(brahman), for Sadyojata, who is Siva, the Unborn, the source of birth, 
is not beyond existence in this world (LP . 1 .23'5-6; 16.9- 10). The face 
of Sadyojata as shown on paitcamukha lingas resembles that of Tatpu­
rua, who is Mahadeva, the Creat God.41 Aghora, a euphemism for 
Chora, the Frightful, is Rudra at his fiercest; he is Sarva, according to 
the mantra. Chora is terrible and black, resembles Death, and is Time. 
But he who knows Siva and that it is he who has assumed this terri­
fying form, has no terror and is full of peace (LP. 1 .23. 1 8-22). Vama­
deva is the name of the face of god on the left (vama). Vama, more­
over, means "lovely." The fivefold mantra, bodied forth from the 
linga, compacts and coordinates the hierarchy of manifestation, from 
the sense powers and subtle elements to the sense-particulars. Each of 
the five faces of the linga has its equivalent on two ontological levels, 
that of the "subtle elements" (tanmatra) and of the gross elements 
(mahabhuta). Besides these categories, the five faces of the linga are 
also the symbols of the metaphysical levels, from m.anas (cosmic mind) 
upward to ahamkara, the individuating principle, to mahat and finally 
to prakrti and pur̄a , cosmic substance and spirit. Through these tran­
scendent categories, Siva, the ultimate reality, becomes the efficient 
and material cause of all that exists. Siva-tattva (the ultimate reality) 
has its symbol in the usually invisible face of the Lord, Isana, who is 
"the knower of the field" (k$etrajita); his presence vibrates in his man­
tra. Tatpurua is the symbol of prakrti ; Aghora is the symbol of mahat 
(buddhi) or cosmic intellect; Vamadeva, the symbol of ahamkiira, and 
Sadyojata the symbol of manas (mind) (LP.2. 14.6-1O). While the five 
faces are equivalent images of the world of the senses, they are at the 
same time symbols of the transcendental categories, so that Sadyojata, 
"born all at once" as the symbol of mind has, in the world of the 
senses, the power of sex and the element earth as equivalent refer­
ences (LP. 2 . 1 4.20, 25). Each has its particular color. In this way the 
five-faced linga is the comprehensive symbol of the five-times-fivefold 
reality, Siva, in whom are all the twenty-five tattvas or ontological

principles, from the unfathomable beyond to concrete existence 
(LP.2. 14·31 -33)· 
Sadyojata, "born all at once," symbol of mind (manas)-who was 
generated first, is the first of the five mantras, and is existence itself­
appears to occupy, in the symbolism of the paiu:amukha linga, the po­
sition of the initiated, who represents manas, the eighth reality of AÆ­
tamiirti Siva. 
The five mantra faces of the linga are those of Siva. As faces of god 
they have their own names and iconography, and are shown not in­
frequently as busts with arms that carry their particular emblems. 
Sadyojata is equated with Nandin, the foremost attendant and door­
keeper of Siva. Vamadeva, the "lovely" face of the left, is Vma, the 
Great Goddess, as consort of Siva. Aghora is Bhairava, the horrible, 
frightening form of the Great God. Tatpuruia is Mahadeva, the 
Great God. !Sana, whose face is generally not shown, indicates the 
presence of Siva, the eternal Sadasiva, in whom is evoked Siva in utter 
transcendency (VDhP.3.48.1-8).42 Once Uma asked Siva why he 
had four visible faces. Siva explained that the eastern face conveyed 
the supernatural and the perennial practice of asceticism, the western 
face expressed the sustenance of the universe, and the northern face 
showed meditation of the Veda, the sum total of all knowledge. The 
northern and western faces were auspicious, whereas the southern 
face meant the destruction of progeny (MBh. 13, app. 1 ,  no. 1 5, lines 
278-8 1 , 30 1-305). 
The categories of the Linga Puriitta are those of the Samkhya sys­
tem. Its ontology, in the Vi$ttudharmottara Puriitta, is represented as a .  
theophany. Differences in coordination occur in the Purii1)as, how­
ever; in the Agni Puriitta, for instance, white is associated with Tatpu­
ruia and yellow with Sadyojata (AP.304.25). 
While the Purii1)as, in explaining the meaning of the five faces of 
the linga, adhere to the Samkhya system, a late Saiୂa Upani$ad, the 
Pancabrahma Upani$ad, and Saiva philosophy account for the meaning 
of the mantras themselves, which are figured on the five-faced linga. 
Accordingly, Isana,. Tatpuruia, Aghora, Vamadeva, and Sadyojata, 
ୃhe five mantras, the pancabrahmans, are sound-forms that constitute 
Siva in transcendency.43 They are represented by the anthropo-

morphic symbols of the five faces of the linga. These also represent 
the five aspects of the power or sakli of Paramasiva. Paramasiva, or the 
Supreme Siva, in utmost transcendency, is pure creativity, pure 
changeless consciousness, the godhead in which all things inhere. Pa­
ramasiva, boundless plenum of pure consciousness, by its inherent 
power represents itself as Siva Tattva, consciousness, together with 
Sakti Tattva, the power of consciousness to act. Siva Tattva, and Sakti 
Tattva, the Siva principle and the Sakti principle, are unproduced, 
eternal. They coexist monadically. Their polarization inheres in the 
Sadosiva Tattva, the first evolute of consciousness, wherein "I-this" 
(aham-idam), or consciousness and its subject, arise in close embrace. 
Thence isvara Tattva evolves, the principle wherein consciousness 
gazes at itself as the object. In the next evolute, the Sadvidya Tattva, 
consciousness, looks first at aham, "I," and then at idam, "this." In this 
third stage of the increasing distance of "I" and "this," all things are 
created. They are prefigured in the universal consciousness before its 
transcendental unity displays itself as duality by the power of maya. 
The ontological hierarchy of the five transcendental principles of 
Siva, Sakti, Sadasiva, ISvara, and Sadvidya, which are "pure princi­
ples" or Swldha Tattvas, has its point of reference in Paramasiva, that 
is in pure, changeless consciousness, in pure creativity, or, only seem­
ingly paradoxically, in the Uncreate. 
The transcendental aspects of sakli or power associated with the five 
pure principles (tattva) are, respectively: cit or parosakti, the power of 
transcendental consciousness; ananda, bliss, the primordial or iidi 
sakti; and the transcendental powers of knowing, willing, and acting 
(jnana sakti, icchi sakti, krzya sakti). 
The immutable pure principles and their powers, by an ongoing in­
crease of the distance of aham-idam, give rise to duality, to discrimi­
nation, because of the finitizing or defining power of consciousness. 
This power or sakti is maya, the power that brings about the prefigu­
ration of mind and matter. Maya, delusion, according to Kashmiri 
Saivism, is an eternal power dormant in consciousness, which disrupts 
the transcendental unity of the pure principles and effects the impure 
duality of the manifest world. By the activity of maya the pure princi­
ples and powers are transmitted to and transmuted in the realm of 
pure-impure (swldha-aswldha) principles, a metaphysical limbo be­
tween the transcendental and the phenomenal in which aham and 
idam are distinct as PUnt.$a (cosmic creator) and Prakrti (cosmic sub-

FACE O F  S I V A , 1 8 7 
stance). Hence, the cosmos evolves in its subtle and gross aspects, 
from cosmic intelligence (mahat), the individuating principle 
(ahmnkara), and cosmic mind (manas), to the sense powers (indriya) and 
subtle elements (tanmatra), and down to Earth. The re.llm of the "im­
pure principles" (aiudha tattva) of Saiva ontology is identical with 
that of the ontology of the Sarhkhya philosophy, while being per­
meated by the presence of Paramasiva, the ultimate point of refer­
ence of every tattva and each particular of knowledge, action, and 
concrete reality. 
In the ontological theophany of Siva, the body of god consisting of 
mantra (mantra-murti) is represented by the five-faced liitga. The sym­
bol of the presence of god on each and all levels of realization and 
reality is vested within the audible / inaudible sound of mantra over 
and above the luminance of the liitga pillar. 
The Pancabrahma Upani$ad, a text possibly prior to the Vi$ttu­
dharmottara Puriitta, assigns control of all saktis to Tatpuruia (PB Up. 1 5), 
whereas jniina, icchii, and kriyii sakti are specifically associated with 
Vamadeva, Aghora, and Sadyojata, respectively (PBUP. 12, 8, 6). Be­
sides, Tatpuruia is associated with the north (commentary on PBUp. 
1 5); Vamadeva, Aghora, and Sadyojata with the south, west, and east, 
respectively (commentary on PBUP. l0, 7, 5). The Viitulaiuddhiigama, 
on the other hand, gives precedence to icchii sakti instead of jniina 
sakti.44 Doctrinal differences, as well as possible errors in transmission, 
may account for changes in attribution, but they do not alter the main 
structure of Saiva ontology. The doctrines were at their peak in the 
latter part of the first millennium of the present era; they coincided 
with the living tradition of the myths and imagery of the Puriittas, ad­
hering to Sarhkhya doctrine, while the pancabrahman mantras them­
selves were embodied in the Taittiriya Arattyaka ( 10.43-47) in about the 
third century B.C. 
The Pancabrahma Upani$ad says: "With the knowing of the fivefold 
Brahmans, consisting of Sadyojata and others, as the preliminary 
step, one should know that all this phenomenal world is the Parabrah­
man, Siva, of the character of the fivefold Brahmans, nay he should 
know whatever is seen or heard of or falls within or lies beyond the 
range of his inner and outer senses, as Siva of the character of the 
fivefold Brahmans alone" (PBUP.26).45 The Upani$ad continues: "In

bonds of worldly existence" (PBUP.40-41 and commentary).46 
Reverting from the metaphysical and ontological meaning of the 
paitcamukha linga to the myth of the linga of the Great God: the linga 
was seen torn out and fallen on the earth, just as the seed of the Cre­
ator had fallen in the beginning of things. Fire consumed the lake of 
the seed of Prajapati. The severed linga of Siva entered the earth, van­
ished, and rose as a pillar of flame that only gods could see. Rudra 
was born; he arose from the seed of Prajapati, and he sprang from 
the head of Brahma. He was born anew from aeon to aeon. The myth 
of his creation, in successive aeons, holds the mystery of his birth, im- ' 
plied in the symbol of sex and in that of the head. Rudra is seed-born, 
mind-born, breath-born, though Uncreate. He is the Great Yogi, 
whose urdhvalinga is a sign of self-containment. He becomes Sthal)u, 
the post, when Brahma asks him, his own mindborn son, to create 
mortals. Rudra infused his own asceticism into his father Brahma, 
who created him from his head, unlike Prajapati, who had engen­
dered him from his seed. Head and sex lie close together in the myth 
of Rudra and in the concrete shape of the mukhalinga, which is made 
of stone or any other substance. 
The heads, one invisible, the others manifest, are united with the 
linga of Siva in their proper places. Invested with their form and 
meaning, the linga is the concrete shape permeated by the vibrations 
of the light and of the mantras of Siva. With its five faces, the linga 
projects its meaning beyond the perimeter of its abstract phallic shape 
into an ambience where mantra and image coincide. Siva Mantramiirti 
is at the same time Sadyojata-Nandin, 'Just born" in the mind of his 
devotee, and, facing in the opposite direction, he is Tatpuruia-

Mahadeva, "suchness" and the Great God. The faces of Nandin and 
Mahadeva resemble each otherY 
Along the other axis, and facing in opposite directions, the dread­
ful countenance of Aghora-Bhairava is the antithesis of the loveliness 
of Vamadeva-Vma.48 Aghora-Bhairava is Rudra, the Wild God at his 
fiercest. Vamadeva, "the god of the left," is the Great Goddess, she is 
Vma, part of Siva and his consort. Her face, suffused with tenderness, 
is to the left of that of Mahadeva. Although the mantra of Vamadeva 
does not explicitly invoke the goddess, the face of Vma, to the left of 
the Great God, surges from the linga, swelled by the invisible presence 
of Prakrti (Plates 4, 6, 10). 
6. Linga, Mantra, TIME, AND ETERNITY 
Transcendental reality and ontological becoming, together with phe­
nomenal existence, have their symbol in the linga. With reference to 
the latter, and inasmuch as the four visible faces of the linga are ori­
ented in the four directions, the movement of the sun, that is of time, 
is built into the conception of the four-faced linga. The number four 
is symbolically that of the four directions. It was transferred from the 
four cardinal points, together with their respective faces, to an alle­
gory of time, as seen in each of the four yugas or world ages-the 
Krta, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali Yugas. These ages follow one upon 
the other in each aeon (kalpa). The Vayu PUra'fJ,a relates that the gods 
were worried when the yugas came into being, for they were con­
trolled by Kala, the dread god of four faces, who is Time. In their fear 
of Kala, the gods resorted to Mahadeva, the Great God. For a thou­
sand years they propitiated him (VaP .32.6-10), for only Mahadeva the 
Great God would know the four-faced Kala. The Great God ad­
dressed himself to Kala and calmed him. God Kala then felt free to 
introduce each of his four faces to the Lord. He ideୄtified each with 
one of the four world ages, beginning with the white face, which was 
that of the Krta Yuga, the Perfect Age. He then introduced the red 
face as that of the Treta Yuga, and the tawny yellow face as that of 
the Dvapara Age. He introduced last the terrible black face with 
47 K. Kumar, "A Dhyana-Yoga Mahdamiirti," pp. 107, 109, and pis. V-VIII. 
48 Ibid. 

1 90 '  LINGA 
threatening red eyes (VaP.32. 1 1-1g). It showed that this last age, the 
Kali Yuga, the present age, could know no happiness, for Kala in that 
age would grab everyone (VaP.32. l g-20). When god Kala, who is time 
and death, had introduced each of his four faces, Lord Siva, who all 
the while had known their identity, declared that in the fourth face or 
age he himself was to be worshiped; in fact, he inhered in each of 
them (VaP.32.2 1-22). All four faces were those of Mahesvara, the 
Great Lord, who makes time roll on, and who has five faces, the fifth 
face being placed above the others. 
God Kala, however, has no fifth face; he carries only four faces of 
Lord Siva, for time does not exist in transcendency, which the fifth 
face of Siva symbolizes. Below it, under the sun, in the revolving 
world of time, each world age has its own clear and strong color. Yet 
it is particularly in the darkness of the present yuga that Kala, who is 
time and death, resembles Lord Siva. 
In the beginning, when the Perfect Age emerged at the first dawn, 
time was the antagonist of Siva. Though as yet it did not show its face 
and was not personified, it acted against Rudra. It did not permit him 
to prevent the rupture of the Uncreate. Subsequently, when Rudra 
had agreed to, but tarried in carrying out, Brahma's command, time 
again ran its course, seemingly counter to Rudra's purpose. Dakia 
had superseded Rudra. Though time (Kala) thus far had not shown 
its face but had made its actions fdt, it now revealed four faces. They 
were Siva's masks and mouthpieces. 
Each of the faces has its own significance, but the four faces of god 
Kala speak with more than one tongue. Although the white face of 
Kala had four tongues, their number subsequently dwindled 
(VaP.32. 14- 19). In the last, the present, age, the horrendous black 
face with its one black tongue says that Kala, time, death, and Rudra 
are one. While in this yuga, the Kali Yuga, there is no happiness 
(VaP.32.20), there also is no fear for him who recognizes in the dark 
face of Kala the face of the Great Lord (VliP.32.23-25). 
The allegory of the four-faced god Time is analogous to, and 
closely fits the conception of, the four-faced linga. As Siva dwells in 
both, the two shapes coalesce; the faces of Kala are masks of Siva. The 
four faces of the linga, inasmuch as they face the four directions, greet 
the sun at the four significant stages of its annual cycle. They are ori­
ented in time. Whereas the ontological symbolism of the linga in-

MANTRA , T I M E ,  E T E R N  I T Y  • 1 9 1 
cludes the element space, conceptually it does not provide for the di­
mension of time that abides in Siva. 
In the Krta, the Perfect Age, the great .Rii TaI)<;li praised Lord Siva 
as the passage of time in the year, the yuga, and so on (MBh. 1 3. 16.46). 
Through the encounter of the Great God with and his self-recogni­
tion in Kala, the linga, the ontological symbol of Siva, became vested 
with the dimension of time. The linga now encompassed the sense 
powers and the elements together with time, the condition for their 
existence. In the world of concrete reality they cannot function if time 
be taken from them. Their relation would dissolve, they would disin­
tegrate. While death appears to be the alternative of the temporal 
condition in this world, death is built into the structure of time. Death 
says that she is powerless and acts under the authority of Time. All 
modes of behavior are directed by time (MBh. 13.I .S8-60). Kala oper­
ates in all creatures. The universe is suffused with time; all acts and 
all attitudes, all modes of behavior are conditioned by Kala. 
Thus we see that Death, the beautiful young goddess, carried out 
the dictate of Kala. She did not act on her own account but was di­
rected by Kala, whose dark presence loomed over the aftermath of 
Brahma's extinguished conflagration of the cosmos that he had cre­
ated. At this moment, Rudra as SthalJu imparted his yoga power of 
withdrawal to Time. He inserted the pause of quiescence into its 
speeding course and assuaged the immutable fact of dying by making 
the Creator accept the aeviternal rhythm of cyclical time, thus allow­
ing for periods of withdrawal and rest between those of activity. 
SthaI)u, the motionless pillar, held in himself the timeless, indivisible 
eternity of the absolute that is realized by yogis in samiidhi. Absolute, 
undivided Time is a quality of the realization of the absolute. The 
Great God, the Lord of Yoga, as SthaI)u, is an embodiment of the par­
adox of absolute Time. As such his image is that of the,god Mahakala, 
"great" or transcendental Time, in contradistinction to Kala, relative 
time, the condition for the existence of the universe. 
Relative time showed itself first, just before the primordial sunrise. 
Its flight, which was that of Rudra's arrow, caused the Father to with­
draw from the embrace of his daughter. His seed, the seed of creF­
tion, fell to the earth. 
In his primordial action, Rudra caused time to become manifest. 
Though Rudra was its cause, time acted against the purpose of 

1 92 
• LlNCA 
Rudra; but in that respect it followed the pattern that Rudra himself 
had established. He did this by first preparing the seed and then ob­
structing the consequence of his action. There was no unilinear path 
leading into creation. 
Rudra, Lord of Yoga, held within himself motionless, indivisible, 
absolute Time, his inner equivalent of the Uncreate. He became the 
cause of relative time, the condition for the existence of the universe. 
Like time, Rudra, the Wild Archer, brings death. The great, mythical 
:Rii TaI).Ҋi-who sang his hymn to Rudra in the first, the Perfect, Age, 
the Kfla Yuga-knew the Great God not only as the passing of time 
in the year (MBh. 13.16.46) but also as Death, as Time, and the ulti­
mate cause of time, and he knew him as eternity (MBh.13.16.5 1 ). The 
vision of :Rii TaI).Ҋi in the Krta Yuga foresaw and comprised Kala and 
Mahadeva as they would appear in the Kali Yuga. 
The Wild God of the lJ.g Veda, in the dawn of the world, did not 
reveal his face. His bow and arrows sufficed to establish the identity 
of him who had the power to cut short the span of life of man and 
beast. Rudra Tryambaka acted in the way in which the features of 
Kala-Aghora's face are cast.49 
At the dawn of creation, the Wild Archer aimed his arrow at the 
procreative act. The arrow would have prevented the inception oflife 
had not time intervened and allowed the seed of the Creator to fall. 
Time then was against Rudra; it cooperated with the purpose of the 
Creator by providing the field for Rudra's action. Time played an am­
biguous part, as did Rudra himself. The Wild Hunter, having pre­
pared the seed for the Father, obstructed the consequence. Creation 
came about, borne by tensions of ambiguity. Rudra, the Lord of Yoga, 
resolved them within his unqualified quiescence. When he himself 
came to be born from the mind or breath of Brahma, the Creator, he 
chose the shape of SthaI).u, the pillar, as his own. This was in response 
to Brahma's having charged him with the creation of mortals. Or he 
chose an alternative response and plunged into the waters. Plants 
came to life in the water as his light irradiated them. He dwelled in 
the waters for a long time; for him, in his trance, time did not exist. 
Time, however, mattered to Brahma, the Creator, who assigned to 
another, to Dakia, the work of populating the wide earth. When at 
49 Cf. ibid., pI. VII and p. 1 07. 

MANTR A , T I M E ,  E T E R N I T Y ' 1 93 
last Rudra rose from the water and saw all the people whom he had 
not created, he raged. 
Time once again had been Rudra's antagonist, or an ambiguous 
helpmate. At the moment of primeval dawn, time had been part of 
the scene in which Rudra sent forth his arrow. The scene was set on 
the border of the timeless Uncreate of which Rudra acted as guard­
ian. Since then, Rudra had come to be born from Prajapati, the Lord 
of Generation; Prajapati gave his son his names, as well as his do­
mains. They comprised the total manifest cosmos together with sun 
and moon, the measurers of time. Rudra henceforth comprised the 
entire manifest world in his cosmic body. While he stayed under 
water, time was drowned in his yogic absorption, but he kept Brahma 
waiting, and made him transfer to Dakia the responsibility of creating 
mortals. Although Rudra raged when he rose from the waters for 
having been bypassed by the Creator, he owed this not altogether un­
welcome, and probably not unforeseen, treatment to his cosmic as 
well as yogic power over time; past, present, and future lay within him 
while he practiced tapas in the waters. 
In his shape as SthaI).u, Rudra's alternative response to Brahma's 
order to create mortals, time was kept in abeyance by Rudra's resolve 
to stay motionless until the end of the world. 
When Brahma, however, distressed by the miscarriage of one of his 
experiments in creating mortals, had been about to consume his cre­
ation in a holocaust, Rudra, the pillar, moved by pity, came to its res­
cue. He implored Brahma to allow the triple universe-the future, 
the past, and the present-to exist (MBh.7, app. 1 ,  no. 8, lines 69-98). 
In his great concern for creatures, Rudra asked for even more than 
that. He begged of Brahma that all creatures, having lived their lives, 
would go to rest and come back to a new period of activity. Out of his 
timeless being Rudra introduced into the dimension ?f relative time 
a rhythm of movement and pause, an aeviternal return of life and of 
cosmic cycles. 
Pity moved SthaI).u, the pillar. Out of his concern for life, he who 
had turned away from the creation of mortals made the creator ex­
tend their life beyond the life span of their mortal bodies, so that 
when life withdrew from one body it would, after a period of rest, re­
turn to new activity in another. Rudra, the Great Yogi, who had laid 
time to rest within himself, projected from within himself a pause into 

1 94 ' LINGA 
the course of time. The Great Lord, moved by pity, had taken unto 
himself his primeval antagonist, time, had laid it to rest, and had im­
parted to its flight a new quality, a cyclical rhythm of pause and re­
turn. 
In their fear of Kala, who is time, the gods had resorted to Maha­
deva, for none but the Great Lord would know him. Siva recognized 
himself in the four faces of Kala-the yugas-and made time roll on. 
In yet another vision, carrying, paradoxically, the movement of 
time even beyond the four faces of Kala, the five faces or mantras of 
Siva are beheld manifesting in time, one after the other, in the vast­
ness of succeeding cycles-not of yugas or world ages but of aeons 
(kalpa); one kalpa equals one day of Brahma, or 1 ,000 times the 
432,000,000 years of four yugas (LP . 1 .4.4; 1 .4.24-36). In this context, 
the twenty-ninth aeon (kalpa) was singled out for the manifestation of 
Sadyojata (ViiP .22.g-14; LP . 1 . 1 1 .2-5; 1 .23. 1-6). This particular aeon, 
the twenty-ninth, may have been chosen for one particular reason. 
When twenty-eight aeons have passed, a vast revolution of world ages 
has been completed; this revolution is analogous to the briefer move­
ment of the moon across its twenty-eight mansions; or it is analogous 
to the duration of a manvantara, which comprises four yugas repeated 
seven times. After such a vast period of ages, the time comes for the 
total manifestation of Siva as the Pancabrahmans, his five mantras, be­
ginning with Sadyojata.5o 
When Siva was born to Prajapati, he appeared as Nila-Lohita, a boy, 
blue and red. This child, comprising the colors of the spectrum, sud­
denly sat on the lap of Prajapati (ViiP.27.3-5)' Now, as Brahma de­
sired a son from aeon to aeon, he meditated, and a youth appeared to 
him in one aeon after the other, each time of a different color. Sad yo­
jata was the first to appear to Brahma: the child was pure white 
(LP . 1 . 1 1 . 1-8; 1 .23. 1-3; ViiP.22.8- 14). The other mantra manifestations 
appeared successively, in red (LP. 1 . 1 2. 1-3; VaP.22.2 1-25), in yellow 
(ViiP.23. 1- 1O; LP. 1 . 13. 1 -3), or black (LP. 1 .  14.3-4; ViiP.23.22-2g), or 
in the color of crystal (cf. LP. 1 . 16.4-5; cf. VtiP.23.36-40). isana, the 
ruler, whose face of crystal color in principle and as a rule is invisible 
50 According to the Linga PuratlZ, Sadyojata is manifest in the twenty-ninth kalpa 
(LP. 1 . 1 1 . 2-5), Vamadeva is manifest in the thirtieth kalpa (LP. 1 . 1 2. 1-5), Tatpuruéa in 
the thiny-first kalpa (LP. 1 . 1 3 . 1 ), Aghora in the thirty-second kalpa (LP. 1 . 14. 1 -6), and 
LP. 1 . 1 6. 1 -6 treats of the kalpa of i sana.

and above-that is "beyond"-the other faces on the linga, is here co­
ordinated with the other youths, just as the isii:namantra is coordinated 
as the fifth mantra with the other four. In conjunction with each of 
these five blessed youths appeared disciples of the same respective 
colors, who showed by their actions the way to reunion in Lord Siva 
(LP. 1 . 1 1 .6- 1 1 ;  1 . 1 2.6-13; 1 . 1 3.16-2 1 ;  1 . 14.7-13; 1 . 16.36-39; Vap. 
22.8-35; 23. 1-40, 58-61 ). The impact of Siva's birth is manifes­
tation from Prajapati-Brahma resounded through the aeons in the 
five mantra-youths and their disciples. They carried into the sequence 
of aeons the presence of him who is Sadasiva, the eternal, who is su­
preme, eternal bliss, who projects all beings into existence and with­
draws them again into himself, the origin of the worlds, and who 
is called Time, the destroyer (cf. Hymn of TaQQi, MBh . 1 3. 16.5 1 ). 
The projection of embodied mantras into aeonic sequence reduces 
their significance, eternal verities becoming temporal truths. Whereas 
it is in the nature of sound, the conveyance of mantras, to be located in 
time, the five mantras were also known to constitute Siva's body, which 
though imaged anthropomorphically was known to be a "body of 
pure energy" (sahti sarira) having no substance ( Prahrti).51 The five 
mantras constitute its head, face, heart, sex, and feet (SDS p. 82).52 
Sound is one ofthe subtle elements (tanmiitra) within the impure prin­
ciples (aSuddha tattva) of manifestation, and inheres in iikiiSa, that is, 
ether or space. Sound is but a conveyance for mantra. Mantra, how­
ever, is more recondite than sound. Its origin lies in the realm of the 
pure principles. There are five kinds of sound in relation to mantra. 
The ultimate principle of sound is para vaG. Para viic or transcendental 
sound belongs to Siva tattva, the first Principle of Deity manifesting. 
In ontological hierarchy, Sahti tattva is the abode of paSyanti viic or 
"seeing sound," whereas SadiiSiva tattva, the abode of madhyama vaG '
. is 
the midpoint between the first stage of manifestation of sound and 
sound as substance (vaihhari viic). Madhyama viic 'is differentiated 
though not articulate, like words one utters to oneself without using 
the vocal cords; vaihhari vaG is sound as vibration. It is of two kinds, 
subtle or inaudible sound-belonging to isvara tattva--operating on a

much higher or lower frequency than is audible to the physical ear; 
and gross vaikhari vae. Gross vaikhari vae belongs to Sadvidya tattva. 
The element akasa is the vehicle of gross vaikhari vac .53 
The hierarchy of sound has its origin in the pure principles; in its 
lowest state it manifests as audible sound and reaches the ear of man. 
Thus Isana, represented by the quintessential, invisible face of Siva, 
"adorned with the sound AUM" (PBUP . l g), controls all the sounds. 
Siva, whose body is mantra (cf. PB Up. 6), by this very body links his dev­
otee to himself, audibly, inaudibly, simultaneously in the world of 
the senses and the empyrean.

THE ANDROGYNE GOD 
1. PROLEGOMENA TO THE CREATION OF 
THE GREAT GoDDESS 
Brahma raged against himself when he, the Creator, had failed in his 
several attempts to create mortals who would produce offspring by 
carnal intercourse and die at their appointed time. The people he had 
created increased beyond measure, for death as yet had not come into 
being to keep their throng in check. The overpopulation filled the 
three worlds (MBh . 1 2.248. 1 3-14). Or the pairs of human beings that 
Brahma carefully grouped according to their emotional, moral, and 
intellectual endowment, as he created them in descending order from 
his mouth and chest to his thighs and feet, though they hastened to 
sexual intercourse, failed to produce children, except once-and then 
only at the close of life.! This did not meet the population density re­
quired in mythical time. Looking back at such self-defeating experi­
ments, Brahma wondered, "how can real knowledge dawn on one 
who is engaged in activities of creation?" (SP.2. 1 . 1 5. 1 3).2 Brahma 
dwelled in his mind on the state of abiding in ultim୅te reality beyond 
creation, the Uncreate, that had been ruptured at the beginning of 
things by the intercourse of the Father with his daughter, and re­
sorted to purely mental creation. His mental issue, however, consisted 
of sons who were ascetic sages, lost to the world, altogether disinter­
ested in procreation or sex (BhP'3. 1 2'3-5)' Then Rudra sprang forth 
as his mental son from his furrowed brow (BhP.3. 1 2.6-1O), or from 
his mouth, which was breathing with the exertions of tapas and also

with rage (SP.7. 1 . 1 2.26; LP. 1 .41 .42-43). Brahma delegated to Rudra 
the task of creating mortals. 
Brahma, in the anger of frustration, remembered, we might pre­
sume, that it had been Rudra who prepared the seed for the Father 
and, also, that he had let his arrow fly against him, when the Father 
was shedding that seed into creation. He, Brahma, we may also pre­
sume, remembered that Prajapati had made Rudra Lord of Animals, 
Pasupati, for sparing his life. He knew that Rudra had the power to 
extend or to withhold life. 
Rudra responded in more than one way to the command of 
Brahma. He refused to cooperate with Brahma and left the creation 
of fallible, vulnerable mortals to Brahma. Rudra withdrew into him­
self; he became SthaJ;lU and, in the sparse, motionless shape of the pil­
lar of self-containment, he then and for all time upheld what he had 
guarded before creation had become an issue: the inviolate integrity 
of a state beyond words, to which as Lord of Yogis he now showed the 
way. This was, however, not the only response the Great Lord gave to 
the Creator. As Rudra had been born from his father in more than 
one way, so the Great God reacted to the command of Brahma in 
more than one way. Brahma, on his part, also approached his im­
mense son in more than one way. 
In one version of the castration myth, Brahma created Gaun, of 
shining beauty, to be the wife of Rudra; Rudra was pleased. But when 
Brahma asked him to beget progeny, the great, mighty Rudra 
plunged into the water. The Lord immersed himself in the water, 
thinking that a man without inner incandescence, without tapas, can­
not create progeny. While Rudra went on with his ascetic austerities, 
Brahma took back into himself that daughter of his (VrP .2 1 .2-8). 
Though Rudra had been pleased by Gaur!, he chose tapas, the exer­
cise of the inner light and fire, and not the woman, not the goddess, 
as the means to create progeny. He stayed submerged for a long while 
and, risen from the waters, paradoxically, he castrated himself. Dras­
tically, he severed his procreative limb from his vast body and set his 
linga free. It assumed cosmic dimension and metaphysical signifi­
cance proportionate to the decision of Rudra. Brahma, not having 
foreseen this act of his son, found it exceeded his understanding. He 
also could not believe the fire miracle of the flaming pillar until Siva 
revealed himself within the linga to the Creator. When Brahma could 
not fathom the linga's transcending greatness, he went so far as to re-

D I V I DE D  GOD · 1 99 
sort to a lie. This lie was to cost him his fifth head (Ch. IX.2). But be­
fore he lost it, he worshiped Rudra, who had revealed himself to the 
gods in the transcosmic fire linga, while on earth the linga of stone or 
some other material will be worshiped by mortals. 
It mattered to Rudra that gods and man worship the linga. He fore­
saw that the linga would be installed on earth and worshiped (VmP, 
SM.23.9-1 1 ). On the other hand, he at first refused to take his phallus 
back (SkP.7. 1 . l 87.34), but finally he returned it to his body 
(SkP.6. 1 .62). The anthropomorphic metaphor of the body of the 
Lord slides over the other metaphor of his body, whose extent is the 
universe. When the linga had been severed from the body, it ap­
peared in the limitless darkness of a cosmic night before a new cosmos 
was to arise. In its fiery light it held all the potentialities of becoming, 
that constitute the existence of the cosmos and of man, the micro­
cosm. Siva is AHamurti, his body the manifest universe. The linga is 
his ontological symbol. Anthropomorphic and cosmic metaphors 
combine and hint at the mystery of Siva and the linga. 
In his Sthal)u shape, Rudra established self-containment as an in­
trinsic form of being. The one-pointed shape of the pillar is the par­
adigm that the god implanted in the vertical body of man. In his self­
castration, however, the Lord of Yogis separated from his vast body 
the manifest cosmos, the creative principles and powers by which the 
cosmos comes to exist. The linga is their symbol. The Great Lord, 
from his transcendental being, set forth his cosmic presence, percep­
tible in his eightfold reality as Airamurti; it is knowable ontologically 
and worshiped as linga. By turning into a motionless pillar, by becom­
ing Sthal)u, where he is described as having his seed drawn up 
(LP . 1 .70.323; SP.7. 1 0 1 4. 2 1 ), and, again, by severing his linga, Rudra 
each time answered in his way the command of Brahma to create. 
Neither response satisfied Brahma. Undaunted by the self-revelation 
of Rudra-in lieu of procreation-that his commaέd had effected, 
Brahma gave this last mind-born son of his a third and last chance to 
carry out his bidding to create mortals. 
2. THE DIVIDED GOD 
The setting was the same as before. Rudra issued from the head of 
Brahma, from his prolonged anger, which arose when the mind-born 
Sons of the Creator showed no interest in sex and procreation. None 

2 00 
• T H E  A N D RO GY N E  GOD 
knows how Rudra looked when he issued from the forehead or the 
mouth of Brahma, either to become SthalJu or to sever his linga from 
his lXJdy. Obviously he appeared as a male. Charging Rudra with his 
task to create mortals, Brahma received in response a self-declaration 
by his son of his own being. SthalJu was the total form of the Great 
God as Lord of Yoga, withdrawn in samadhi. In this motionless state 
he had restored within himself the integrality of the Uncreate. By his 
second response, the severance of the linga and its transfiguration, the 
Lord Siva revealed the ontology of his being as the cosmos in its rela­
tion to the Uncreate. Both these symbolic shapes came into being by 
the will of the Lord. 
The third response to the Creator was given by Lord Siva, the lord 
of yogis (d. SP.24.SS-6S; 2S.S-2g), as soon as he sprang from 
Brahma's mouth. His vast figure was like fire, terrible to behold 
(KiiP. 1 . 1 1 .2-3; d. VaP.9.7S; LP. 1 .70.32S); it was half male and half 
female (VaP .9·7S; LP. 1 .70·32S; VP . 1 .7. 1 2- 1 3; LP. 1 .4 1.7-9; LP · 1 .S.28; 
SP.2. 1 . 1S'SS-S6; KiiP. 1 . 1 1 .3). Brahma asked the Lord to divide him­
self, and then Brahma disappeared out of fear (KiiP . 1 . 1 1 .3). 
Lord Siva appeared from Brahma's forehead, his fierce, immense 
body a glowing mass, half man, half woman (LP . 1 .41 .7-9). This form 
presaged the human race in its two constituents, the male and the fe­
male, the right and left halves of the body of Lord Siva. His androg­
ynous body had been conceived in Brahma's mind. When it emerged 
from Brahma's head, it was terrifying to behold, glowing like the sun, 
hot because of Brahma's anger and because it was the shape of Rudra, 
who is Fire. 
Rudra is Agni. Agni, the Fire, had for his highest symbol "the bull 
who is also a cow" (RV. 1O.S.7; cf. RV. 1 . 14 1 .2; 4.3. 10). This image of 
Fire loomed at the last frontier that the mind of the Vedic seers, in 
quest of the ultimate, could reach (RV. I0.S.6). There, it would seem, 
it burned itself into the mind of the Creator. The theriomorphic im­
age of totality in its bovine shape of power was a seal and sentinel be­
yond which thought, vision, and word could not penetrate. Beyond 
this image of totality lay the Uncreate. The bull-cow was also, in the 
most ancient aeon, the image of Visvarupa, the primordial Creator 
(RV·3·38·4, S, 7; 3·S6·3)·3 
3 The bull.-cow Agni (Ch. 1.4), unlike the progenitive bull-cow Visvarupa, is self-per­
petuating, Agni being his own son (tanunapiit), (cf. A. A. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, pp. 
99-100 and Ch. VII n. 15). 

D I V I DE D  GOD · 2 0 1  
The bull-cow, the theriomorphic image of Agni, stored in the mind 
of the Creator desiring to create mortals, assumed anthropomorphic 
shape; Rudra, who is Agni, issued from Brahma's head as Ardha­
narisvara, a figure half man, half woman. When the image of Ardha­
narisvara "the Lord whose half is woman" formed itself in the brood­
ing mind of the Creator, the memory of sexual intercourse as a means 
of creating mortal creatures came back to him with renewed force. 
Having the Supreme Lord in view, Brahma exerted himself in auster­
ities, in order to create mortals who would multiply (LP . 1 .41 .7-9)' 
The dependence of the Creator on Rudra's help in bringing about 
creation was rooted in the traumatic experience of the Father Praja­
pati, the Lord of Generation, whose progenitive act Rudra, a fierce 
hunter, had threatened by his sudden appearance. For sparing him, 
however, Prajapati made Rudra Pasupati, Lord of Animals. Now it 
was Brahma, in his plight of creating mortals, who sought the assist­
ance of Rudra; he knew that this wild, ascetic god had the power to 
withhold death and thus give life. 
In order to allay the misery of Brahma, and to multiply his subjects, 
Rudra became the son of Brahma (SP .7. 1 . 14.3-4). Rudra was born an 
androgyne, the right half male, the left female, but the male and fe­
male halves had no procreative association. In their contiguous close­
ness there was no room for desire. When Brahma saw his androgy­
nous son, he asked him to divide himself, whereupon Rudra split his 
undivided male-female self into a male and a female entity. He con­
tinued the process and split the male entity into eleven Rudras 
(VaP.g.75-77; SP·7· 1 . 1 2.27), this time condensing their indefinite 
number. Before he became Sthal;lU, he had discharged them from 
himself in an unlimited edition of his own being (Ch. VI. 1 ). The num­
ber eleven had the sanction of a previous aeon, w,hen the eleven 
Rudras were part of the three times eleven or thirty-three gods 
(RV. l . 1 3g· 1 1 ;  3.6.9; 8.35.3). This number comprised the Vedic gods, 
including the group of the eight Vasus, who subsequently entered the 
domain of Rudra, and also the group of twelve gods, the Adityas, 
which included all the suns that ever shone (cf. SH.l i .6.3.5; AB .2. 1 8). 
The Rudras carried the breaths ( praruts) of the one Rudra, the Alman, 
the inmost self, into all there is (cf. BrUp.3.9.4). They were concerned 
';ith all beings and permeated the three worlds (VaP.g.80-81 ;  cf. 
SP .7. 1 . 1 2.29-30). The Rudras were the vital energies, the vital breaths 
(prarut) in all that lived (cf. SP.7. 1. 1 2.30; ChUp.3. 16.3). 

2 0 2  • T H E  A N D ROGYNE GOD 
Though Brahmii had pondered over creation by sexual inter­
course, the Creator could not people the earth with human beings, 
since women had not yet emerged from Siva (SP.7. 1 . 15.2). Brahma, 
in his austerities, had contemplated the Lord as Ardhaniirisvara, the 
form of the Great God in which he is perpetually together with the 
woman in him, the Great Goddess, who is his sakti , his power. Brahma 
knew that without Siva's power, progeny would not be born, and with 
love in his heart, thinking about Lord Siva united with the great Sakti 
called Siva, he practiced tapas (SP .3.3.2-6). Pleased by the austerities 
of Brahmii, the Lord w hose half is a woman granted the Creator the 
fulfillment of his wish. Having divided himself and set up his male 
domain elevenfold (SP. 7. 1 . 1 2.27), he created the Goddess from the 
other half of his body. Sakti manifested from the body of Siva. She 
had all the divine qualities of the Great God. Though she pervaded 
everything, she appeared like a wonderfully embodied woman, bewil­
dering the entire world with her maya, her magic illusion, for in reality 
she is unborn, though apparently born of Siva (SP.7 . 1 .16.6-1 1 ). 
The Great Goddess, the highly illustrious one, sharing half the 
body of the Lord, on having been separated by him, became Sati, 
"The Real" (LP .1 .70.326-27). This was the image of herself in which 
Siva was to know her as his wife in the universe. In his image as 
Ardhanarisvara, the Lord manifested the signs of both sexes as the 
cause of creation. All creatures bear these signs (cf. MBh . 1 3. 14, note 
102, insert 1 13, lines 1-8). For the sake of the welfare of the world, 
the Great Goddess became Sati among mortals (cf. LP. 1 .70'327-28; 
KUP. 1. 1 1 .57).4 All the women in the three worlds are born from her 
alone. She is everything in the feminine gender, and Rudra is every­
thing masculine (LP. 1 .5.29-30)' Now, however, since the Goddess 
proved to be the more fascinating by being barely discernible to the 
sight of the gods, it is said that Siva requested her, for the sake of cre­
ation, to divide herself in halves, one white, the other black 
( LP· 1 .7°·328). 
This polarity was an anticipatory epitome of all the goddesses that 
were to spring from it. They were to guide and agitate a posterity that 
Brahmii yearned to establish with the help of Siva. The names of the 
goddesses are infinite. The entire universe was pervaded by them.

propensities, they were known as so many shapes of prajnii or gnosis, 
and also oUn or luck (LP . 1 .70,333-344). 
Siva hypostasized; he separated from himself the Goddess so that 
Brahma, wishing to increase mankind through sexual intercourse, 
could address himself to her. Brahma bowed to Siva. He told the God­
dess in a hyperbole of deference that he, Brahma, had been created 
by her consort, the lord of gods, and ordered by him to create prog­
eny. Mentally, Brahma had created the gods and others, but they did 
not multiply. They had to be created again and again. But now 
Brahma wanted creation to originate by means of copulation. The fe­
male sex, however, had not as yet issued from Siva, and Brahma-ac­
cording to the Siva Puriitw-lacked the power to create women 
(SP.3.3.2-6; 7. 1 . 16. 1 -6, IS- 1 8). 
All saktis, all female powers, spring from the Great Goddess. Hence 
Brahma asked Siva to give him the power to create women (SP.3.3.7-
20). Brahma then asked the Great Goddess for yet another boon. He, 
the Creator, implored her, the mother of the universe, to be born as 
the daughter of Dakka, his son. The supreme goddess, Siva, the sakti 
of Siva, consented and granted Brahma his request. From the middle 
of her brow she created a sakti equal in glory to herself. Lord Siva, the 
ocean of mercy, then smilingly asked Sakti to fulfill the desire of 
Brahma, and she became Sat!, the daughter of Dakka (SP.3.3.2 1-27). 
Then the Great Goddess, the goddess Siva, reentered the body of 
Siva, and Lord Siva vanished (SP.3.3.28). From that time, womankind 
was created in the world, procreation became sexual, the enjoyment 
of pleasure in woman was established, and Brahma was happy 
(SP·3·3·29; 7· 1 . 16.2S; SP.2S.S-2g). 
Sat! is the Great Goddess. As Sat! she acted the part she had to play 
in the myth of Siva; she issued from and represented the Great God­
dess, who had returned into Siva. The Great Goddess, as idea, would 
be eternally within Siva, while as image she would be Sat!, whom Siva 
would love as his wife. Before that could happen, she had to become 
the daughter of Dakka. She had to be born, and though she was an 
image of the Great Goddess, she was but an aspect of her whole un­
fathomable being. 
Before the Great Goddess consented to be born in her role as the 
daughter of Dakka, she had allowed saktis to become apparent every­
where (SP.7. 1 . 1 6. 1g-22). But none of these saktis or powers would 
hold the attention of Siva, and none had to be born as anyone's

daughter. They remained intangible powers to be reckoned with, in­
definitely large in number, like that of the Rudras prior to their being 
represented by their Vedic number symbol of eleven. 
The Great Goddess, by order of Brahma, had to be born as the 
daughter of Dakka so as to become the wife of Siva. By the order of 
Brahma, Sat! was given to Rudra by Dakka (SkP .7.2.9. 1 1 ). This son of 
Brahma was born from his mind or, according to other-in this con­
nection more relevant because phallically suggestive-accounts, from 
his thumb (MP.3.9 ; VP.4. 1 .6; cf. SkP.7. 1 .  19.57).5 It was Dakka who 
filled the earth with mortals, his own progeny, while Rudra tarried, 
immersed in the waters (Ch. VI.3). Dakka, son of Brahma, played a 
role intermediate between Brahma, the Creator, and Siva, his mind­
born, ascetic son. According to the Hariva1{lia, Dakka, in a subsequent 
aeon born of Marika and the ten Pracetasas, produced moving and 
stationary creatures by his mind, then created women and married 
them to other beings, whence arose creation by intercourse (H.2.45-
49). Dakka was a progenitor, a Prajapati, a Lord of Generation, a title 
of the Father in Vedic days.6 Subsequently, however, this role was 
shared by a number of patriarchs, all mind-born sons of Brahma. 
Sati was to act out her own destiny and follow her own will. She had 
issued from the Great Goddess, and had become the daughter of the 
patriarch Dakka. The Great Goddess, having been separated from 
Siva and having brought Sati into existence, reentered the body of 
Siva. Siva was the cause, by two removes, of the creation of women, of 
intercourse and sensual fulfillment. The Great Goddess is their 
proximate origin. Only insofar as she herself had manifested from 
Siva is the Great God their source. Moreover, the Great Goddess on 
her own did not create Sati. The cooperation of Dakka was needed, 
who at the command of Brahma let the sakti of the Great Goddess be­
come his daughter Sati. 
The detachment of Rudra, the Great Yogi, was so great that in one 
version of the myth, in the Skiinda Puratl-a, Rudra subsequently ac­
cepted as his wedded wife Sati, whom Dak$a, at the command of 
Brahma, had given to him. But when Brahma told Rudra to pro­
create, Rudra refused. Creation was the duty of Brahma, whereas he 
himself was the destroyer. He stood firm as a post and showed himself 
" Markm:u!eya Pura1Ja (MaP), tr. F. E. Pargiter, 1904, p. 55 1 (= 1 0 1 .9- 1 0). 
6 The Harivarrtia even notes this interchange of identity at one point by referring to 
DakTa as DakTa Prajapati (H.2·42 and 45; cf. MP·3·9)·

as Sthal)u (SkP.7.2.9.7-17; VrP.2 1 .2-8; Ch. VI, supra). As a bride­
groom, he took the form of Sthar:lU. The Great Yogi had directed in­
ward the outward drive of sexual power. He had withdrawn it into 
himself, where he, the Fire of life, burned perpetually upward. When 
born from Brahma as Ardhanarisvara, however, the Lord shone 
forth a flaming seal of undivided wholeness, male and female in one. 
Obeying the command of the Creator, he divided himself. His sepa­
rated female half became the Great Goddess. In her own right, she let 
issue from her the sahli who was to become Sati, her image. Although 
woman and sexual pleasure had emanated from the Great Goddess, 
Rudra neither procreated children with Sati nor created mortals. 
He mentally created the Rudras exactly like himself, free from fear, 
old age, and death, when Brahma wanted him to create mortals 
(SP .7. 1 . 14. 1 4-17). Though it is said that Siva, when thinking of Sati, 
created the innumerable Rudras, they were still mentally created by 
him (VaP.1O'43-54; LP. 1 .70.303-304; 1 .6. 1 1 ). Even though Sati 
dwelled in his mind, his mentation did not bring about her maternity. 
Nowhere does Sati figure as the mother of the Rudras.7 
Ardhanarisvara, born from Brahma's forehead, was commanded 
by Brahma. Thence the Great Goddess stepped forth and was born as 
Sati, the prefiguration of woman and bride-to-be of Siva, the Lord of 
Yoga. 
Seen in the cycle of revolving aeons, Ardhanarisvara will be born at 
the beginning of a new creation in the same way as in the past. In a 
vision recorded in the Linga Pura1}a, the androgynous god blazing 
forth from Brahma's forehead burned Brahma, who thus had no 
chance to command Ardhanarisvara to divide himself. Then, by the 
path of yoga, Ardhatlarisvara enjoyed his own half, the Supreme 
Goddess. He created ViĈI:lu and Brahma in her (LP. 1 .4 1 .9- 1 2). In an­
other version, ViĈI:lu created Brahma, who in turn created Rudra. In 
another aeon (kalpa), Rudra created Brahma. Then, ih another aeon, 
ViĈI:lu created Brahma, then Brahma created ViĈI:lu, and then Lord 
Siva created Brahma. Brahma, seeing the misery in the world, left off 
7 The Rudras issued or were discharged from Rudra. Another Vedic group of gods, 
the Maruts, were sons of Rudra (RV.2.33.1). The Prsni cow and Rudra were their 
father and mother (RV.5.52.16). Rudra put the germ into Prsni (RV.6.66.3). However, 
the Prsni cow was androgynous (cf. A. Bergaigne, La Religion vedique, 2 :397-98); her 
milk flowed from the udder of the bull Prsni (RV-4-3. 10). Rudra's participation in this 
cow-bull and in the birth of the Maruts from Prsni await clarification; cf. Ch. VII n. 1 5.

the activity of creation. Motionless like a rock, he remained in samiidhi 
for ten thousand years (LP. 1 .4 1 . 1S-20). 
In the middle of the lotus in his heart he installed Lord Siva 
(LP . 1 .4 1 .20-22). Then the Lord pierced through Brahma's forehead. 
The original color of Lord Siva was dark (nila) but he became red (lo­
hita) from inner contact with fire; hence he is like Kala-who is Time 
and Death. He was named Nlia-Lohita (LP . 1 .41.2S-27). 
In a dizzying, reciprocal, transaeonic theogony, Brahma, initially 
burnt up by the androgyne god, returned in cycles. He returned less 
frequently as the creator of Siva and VikI.1u than as one created by 
these gods. Siva Ardhanarlsvara, the yogi, enjoying by the path of 
yoga his own undivided, twofold being, set in motion the cycles of a 
reciprocal theogony. In its vortex, the tensions of the father-son re­
lation of Brahma and Siva were set at nought. No room was left for 
them in the heart of Brahma. 
As Brahma inhaled, the lotus within the cavity of his heart faced 
downward. As he held his breath, the lotus, facing upward, expanded 
its petals, and Brahma installed the Great Lord Siva in the infinitesi­
mally small space within his heart (LP. 1 .41.20-22). Another aeon was 
about to begin. 
In the vision of the Linga Purii:1}a, the androgyne god was Parames­
vara Siva, one with Paramesvari origin and pivot of Siva or Rudra in 
manifestation. In the latter aspect, Siva, the Destroyer, was coordi­
nated with Brahma, the Creator, and VikI.1u, the Preserver, each a 
demiurge, subordinate to Paramesvara Siva. Each in turn was vested 
with the full power of deity in manifestation. The reciprocal, concat­
enated filiation of the three gods was a paradox unfolding through 
the aeons, that is in time, whereas the supreme, timeless paradox was 
that of Ardhanarisvara, the androgyne yogi enjoying by the path of 
yoga the other half of his being, the Supreme Goddess. 
Brahma installed Isvara, the Lord, within the lotus of his heart, and 
once again Siva was to be born from Brahma's forehead, but this was 
aeons away from Siva's burning of Brahma. Now Siva took the form 
of AkƐamurti as he stood before Brahma. By the grace of Aktamurti, 
Brahma took up again the work of creation and, having created the 
world, he slept for a thousand world ages (yuga). When he awoke he 
desired to create living beings. Thus he performed austerities, but 
nothing happened. His sorrow at his failure turned into anger. Con­
sumed by fury he breathed his last, and Rudra issued from his mouth, 

G E N EALOGY O F  D E S I RE · 2 07 
the breath of life ( priirta) itself, and became Ard hanaris vara 
( LP . 1 .41 .35-43). Brahma's life was restored by Ardhanarisvara 
( LP. 1 .4 1 .  48-49). A new cycle began in which Brahma willed to en­
gender mortals and Ardhanarisvara let the Great Goddess step out of 
his own being and send her power to be born in the shape of woman. 
3. THE GENEALOGY OF DESIRE 
To Brahma, the Creator, creating Rudra from his forehead or his 
mouth had been an act of anger and despair. It did not have the de­
sired result, for, as yet, through the creation of Ardhanarisvara and 
the Great Goddess, only the possibility of sexual enjoyment and sen­
sual fulfillment had been created. Brahma therefore continued the 
work of creation, and in the end succeeded in creating mortals. This 
task Rudra had shunned, inasmuch as he had thought Brahma prop­
erly should perform it. The birth of Rudra from Brahma's head was 
but an interlude in the course of creation. Having asked androgynous 
Rudra to separate himself into male and female, and having wit­
nessed the division of the male half into the eleven Rudras, Brahma 
created Manu Svayambhuva out of, and like, himself. At the same 
time he created Satariipa, the immaculate. Manu Svayambhuva mar­
ried her.8 From that time, living beings began to multiply rapidly 
(VP.1.7. 14-2 1). Brahma's first mind-born sons, ascetics disinterested 
in procreation, had been found ineffective for his purpose. Brahma 
at last took recourse to himself, and not only literally reproduced him­
self as Manu Svayambhuva but also created at the same time Satariipa 
"of a hundred forms," the female half of himself. Manu and Satariipa 
became the paradigmatic progenitive couple. By becoming his son­
while yet remaining himself-Brahma gained some distance from 
himself; he stepped out of himself toward the creaturely world. 
When Brahma commanded Rudra to divide himself,-he spoke from 
within his own being. As the creator of the universe, Brahma disposed 
of and fully activated all the powers of creation, but not necessarily all 
at the same time. Thus, his desire to create mortals who would mul­
tiply through sexual intercourse had remained unfulfilled for a long 
time. The shape of Ardhanarisvara, his mind-born son, a totality half 
male and half female, seemed to Brahma to have the making of a pro-
' Markm:uJeya Pura1,U1 (MaP). tr. F. D. Pargiter. '904. pp. 247-48 (= 5°.7" 5).

genitive couple. Rudra, however, having separated his two halves, bi­
furcated his male-female potency throughout the cosmos. He divided 
the male half into eleven Rudras. He requested the Great Goddess, 
whom he had separated from his body, to divide herself in two, 
whereupon an untold number of goddesses came forth. Brahma then 
asked the Great Goddess to allow the race of women to emerge from 
her. Without the archetypal image of woman before him, Brahma felt 
himself unable to create women. Although the Great Goddess created 
asakti from within herself and fulfilled the request of Brahma to per­
mit Sakti to be born as Sati, the daughter of Dakka, the expectation of 
Brahma remained unfulfilled. The Great Goddess returned into Siva, 
and Sati, who was to become the wife of Siva (cf. SkP.7.2.g. 1 1- 1 2), 
never gave birth from her womb to a child engendered by Siva. Even 
as the Great God had refused to create mortals, so, fittingly, the gods 
who became his sons were not born in the usual way of mortals. This 
should not have been expected of any god, and least of all of those 
who were the sons of Siva, even though they were not his mind-born 
sons. 
Brahma saw at last that he could not depend on Siva's help in en­
gendering mortals. The task with which Brahma had charged him 
gave the Great God an opportunity only to manifest his otherness 
from Brahma. Thus Brahma, thrown back on himself, reproduced 
himself and fulfilled the role he had meant to assign to Rudra. With­
out further delegating the work of creation to any of his sons, and 
having gained distance from his various experiments in creation, 
some nearly disastrous (Ch. VI.3) and others unsatisfactory, Brahma 
finally followed his true and ancient nature as Creator. He created 
Manu, the paradigm and progenitor of man. Mankind, seen from the 
world contained in the myth of Siva, could have been established only 
after Ardhanarisvara had let the Goddess step out from his being, 
and Sati, the celestial idea of woman, was born. 
Brahma, the Creator, was preceded by Prajapati, the Lord of Gen­
eration. The themes of the myth of Prajapati / Brahma and those of 
the myth of Rudra / Siva interact in counterpoint. While the myth of 
Siva carries the leading melody, that of Brahma, the Creator, contrib­
utes its ancient themes, which are basic to the myth of Siva Ardha­
nansvara. Siva was ordered by Brahma to complete and carry out 
Brahma's work of creation. Twice Siva had complied according to his 
own nature, and the result had not served Brahma's purpose. The 

G E N E A LO G Y  OF D E S I R E · 2 09 
third lime, as Ardhanarisvara, Siva conformed with the Creator. The 
Lord of Yoga took up, in a new key, the work of Brahma / Prajapati, 
the Creator, the Lord of Generation. 
The myth of the creation of man by Prajapati is told in the Satapatha 
Brahmaruz (SB.6. 1 .  1 .8 to 6. 1 .2. 1 1 ;  cf. TmB.7.6. 1-6). "Prajapati, having 
created these worlds, was firmly established on the earth" (SB. 
6. 1 .2. 1 1  ).9 Rudra in this creation myth did not disturb the formation 
of the cosmos of Prajapati. While Rudra played no part in this myth 
of the sovereignty of Prajapati, the mode of operation of Prajapati, as 
Creator, brought into focus the figure of Ardhanarisvara. 
The Briihma1Ja of a Hundred Paths relates how Prajiipati desired to 
reproduce himself. To this end he practiced austerities and created 
the Vedas (SB.6. 1 . 1 .8). Again he practiced austerities and created the 
waters out of Vac, who is Speech, for viic belonged to him (SB .6. 1 . 1 .9). 
Prajapati desired to be reproduced from the waters, and he entered 
them with the Vedas (SB .6. 1 . 1 . 10). An egg arose. From the egg the 
Vedas were first created (SB .6. 1 . 1 . 10). In ascetic effort, practicing ta­
pas, Prajapati conceived the Vedas, sum of all knowledge, and he cre­
ated the waters, the realm of fertility, out of Speech. Speech was his, 
articulating the Revelation. The transformation of the intuited knowl­
edge, of the conception, into the spoken word of the Vedas came about 
in the waters. From the egg formed in the waters the Veda arose, con­
ceived by the Creator and made into Word through viic. Th embryo 
in that egg was fire and the shell of the egg was earth (SB .6. 1 . 1.8- 1 1 ). 
Again Prajapati desired to multiply, and he, as fire, united with the 
earth (SB .6. 1 .2. 1). The embryo was the wind and the eggshell the air 
(SB .6. 1 .2.2). As Vayu, Wind, PrƑapati cohabited with air; from the 
egg that formed itself,. the sun was created; the eggshell was the sky 
(SB .6. 1 .2.3). And again Prajapati desired to multiply, to reproduce 
himself. As the sun he united with the sky. From the egg that then 
arose the moon was created; the eggshell became the_ four quarters of 
the world (SB .6. 1 .2.4). 
Having created earth, air, sky, and the four regions, PrƑapati de­
sired to create creatures that would be his in these worlds (SB .6. 1 .2.5). 
Through his mind he united with Speech, and became pregnant 
(SB .6. 1 .2.6). Four times he consorted with Vac (Speech); the eight 
Vasus, the eleven Rudras, and the twelve Adityas, the sun gods, were 
" Satapalha 8riihmatul (58), tr. J. Eggeling, 1963, part III, p. 150. 

2 1 0 ' T H E  A N D RO G Y N E  GOD 
thus created, and the Visvedevas, the "all-gods." Prajapati placed 
these groups of beings on earth, in the air, in the sky, and in the four 
directions, respectively (SB .6. 1 .  2 .6-9). Then Prajapati created every­
thing that exists (SB .6. 1 .2. 1 1 ). 
Prajapati, the lord of progeny, conceived the Vedas, the sum of all 
knowledge. This was his first creative act; he also created the waters 
out of Speech, for Speech belonged to him. Speech, Vac, was a 
woman; her gender made her female; she was Prajapati's speech. 
Prajapati immersed himself in its fluency, and the Vedas arose from 
an egg that had formed itself by his contact with the waters of crea­
tion. The embryo inside the egg was fire. 
Prajapati's desire to reproduce himself continued from one copu­
lation to the next. In each an egg was formed and an embryo within 
it. Prajapati took the shape of each successive embryo: he was fire, the 
embryo in the shell of the earth, in one "generation," and in the next 
he was fire, the consort of the earth, renewing himself in each gener­
ation, like the mother who becomes the wife of the son, who becomes 
her lover (cf. AB .7. 13; cf. BrUp.6.4.2). 
Prajapati's creation per generationem was an ongoing renewal ! rever­
sal, a concatenation, whose resilient links transmitted the past to the 
future and held in each loop the memory and promise of an eternal 
now. 
Having created the cosmos on the firm foundation of the Vedas 
(SB .6. 1 .  1 .8), the Creator desired to create creatures. By his Mind he 
united with Speech and became pregnant. By the union of the crea­
tive intellect and articulate speech, the cosmos came to exist and all 
who have their place in it, gods and mortals. From the upper vital 
functions ( prii'(l,a) Prajapati produced the gods, and from the lower 
vital functions, the mortals (SB .6. 1 .2 . 1 1 ). 
"The creative pOwer is always a unity of conjoint principles."lo 
Manas (Mind) and Vac (Speech) were a creative, procreative couple, 
but it was Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, who became pregnant. 
Sexual images abound in the world of Prajapati. Prajapati, who was 
Mind, conceived. Thus he became pregnant. The Indian image mak­
ers of later millennia show Brahma as pOt-bellied, a pregnant male, 
rendering visually the identity in god of creation and procreation. 
Though pregnant, Prajapati was not an androgyne. The images of 
10 A. K. Coomaraswamy, "The Vedic Doctrine of Silence," in Coomaraswamy, 1977.

Brahma, there being no images of Prajapati, do not show a combina­
tion of male and female features, but reveal the uniquely female con­
dition of pregnancy in the distended abdomen of a powerful and al­
together male figure. Manas and Vac were so closely one in the 
Creator that he carried her condition in his shape. "He [Prajapati] 
laid the power of reprod uction into his own self " (SB . 1 1 . 1 .6.7). In the 
image of Brahma, the figure of Prajapati survived the actuality of the 
Lord of Generation, whom the Vedas and Briihmartas celebrate. I I 
Brahma, of whom the Manu Smrti and the Puriirzas speak, unlike 
Prajapati in his crήation of man, was not the ultimate cause. He was 
the efficient and material cause, first in the line of descent from the 
Self-Existent, or Svayambhu. An autarchic genealogy led from the in­
conceivable, indiscernible Svayambhu to Manu, the paradigm of man. 
This was so according to an essentially male genealogy, in which the 
female was intermingled with, separated from, and united with the 
male. Brahma in his Purat:Iic nascent universe-and unlike his sculp­
tural representations-was neither a pregnant male nor an andro­
gyne. Having split himself, Brahma became a male and a female. Be­
fore that, no such distinction could be seen in Brahma. In contrast to 
Siva, no androgynous images of Brahma exist. The androgyne was a 
modality of Agni, Fire, who was the bull-cow; of Visvarupa, though 
functioning differently, the primordial, manifesting Creator of a long 
past aeon; and of Siva, the "Lord whose half is woman." 
The creation of Brahma had its beginning in the mind of the ut­
terly indefinable Self-existent. His seed was deposited in the waters 
and became a golden egg. It floated in the waters. Brahma was born 
in the golden egg (M . 1 .8-9). The Manu Smrti, in its Puriirta-like ac­
count of the universe of Brahma, tells of the substantiation of the 
metaphysical Self-existent a.s it extended, station by station, down to 
Manu. It emerged from the total darkness that was before the begin­
ning. This total darkness was already a reification of the altogether 
indescribable Uncreate. 
. 
In the total darkness in which the universe lay immersed, as if in 
deep sleep, was the Self-existent, Svayambhu, who is inconceivable, 
indiscernible, and eternal, and who contains all created beings. He

desired to produce creatures of many kinds from his own inconceiv­
able body. First, with a thought, he created the waters and placed his 
seed in them. That seed became a golden egg, brilliant like the sun. 
In that egg he himself was born a male, as Brahma, the progenitor of 
the whole world. He dwelled in that egg for one whole year. Then, by 
his thought, he divided it into two halves. Out of the halves he formed 
heaven and earth. Dividing his own body, Brahma became a male and 
a female. Through the female he produced Viraj, who is the plan or 
prefiguration of the cosmos. The male, Viraj, having performed aus­
terities, produced Manu Svayambhuva, the progenitor of the whole 
world (M. 1 .  1-34). 
The unknowable, unfathomable Self-existent reproduced himself 
(M. 1 .7-9; VP. 1 .7. 16). For this purpose he as Brahma split in two the 
golden egg formed from the seed of Svayambhu, the Self-existent. 
Out of the two halves of the egg he formed this world of heaven and 
earth. Just as he divided the egg and it became heaven and earth, so 
Brahma divided his own body and it became a male and a female. 
Prior to his self-division, Brahma was not an androgyne. It was on di­
vision only that Brahma, the male, became differentiated as male and 
female, as the egg on division became the two separate and comple­
mentary entities of heaven and earth. It was not unusual for the 
cosmic egg to be split in this manner. God Indra, albeit from the out­
side, had performed the feat of separating heaven and earth in the 
aeon under his dispensation (RV.5·31 .6; 6.44.24; 10.44.8). 
Brahma, the Creator, was not androgynous, although following the 
mode of Ardhanarisvara, not only Brahma but also Vikl)u were in­
deed beheld as androgyne, each viewed as creator of the universe 
and, as such, identical with one another (H, app. 37, lines 40-47). 
Prajapati also had not been androgynous, although he became preg­
nant when he entered by his Mind (Manas) into union with Speech 
(Vac) and created gods and mortals (5B .6. 1 .2.6ff ). The pregnant 
Creator, a potent maternal male (cf. Vedagarbha ; BhP.3. 1 2. 1), was a 
reservoir of conjoint creativity, male in appearance and female in the

adjacent halves, one male, the other female. 
Svayambhu, the Self-existent, created the waters and placed his 
seed in their lap. When it grew into an egg, the foetus within the egg

from Svayambhii downward is not recorded in the Veda. It is stored 
in memory (smrti), of which the Manu Smrti is a record. Brahma's ex­
periments with creation are told in the epics and the Puriirws. The 
main currents, with their eddies, of the myths of Brahma and of 
Rudra flow on, from the one to the other, and intermingle. 
Although the creation myth of Svayambhuva Manu is not told prior 
to the Manu Smrti, where apparently it is a later, PuraQic addition,12 it 
is inserted here as background for the Vedic myth of Rudra. Manu, 
the father of man (RV.2.33. 1 3) and initiator of the sacrifice 
(RV. 1O.63.7), is known in the lJ.g Veda as son of Vivasvat, the Sun 
(RV.8.52. 1 ).13 Manu in the lJ.g 'Veda is not descended from the Self­
existent, Svayambhii. Though the ultimate ancestor of man on earth 
is not named in the lJ.g Veda, his conception is prefigured in the crea­
tion hymn that sings of Abhu, the life principle (RV. IO. 1 2g.3).14 Sva­
yambhii and Abhu are closely related. 
In an often retold and contracted version of the myth of Brahma's 
creation, the genealogy of Manu is shortened. The male and the fe­
male produced by Brahma's division were Manu, one in essence with 
Brahma, and Satariipa (VP. 1.7. 16- 1 8; cf. AP. 1 7.7-1O). From their 
union sprang two sons and two daughters (KilP . 1 .8.g-1 1 ). Prasiiti, 
"the birth-giving," one of the two daughters of Manu and Satariipa, 
was given in marriage to Dakka, one of Brahma's mind-born sons 
(KilP. 1 .8. 1 1 ). Dakka had many daughters; one of them was Sati, the 
Great Goddess herself incarnate (K ilP . 1 .8. 16- 1 7). After Dakka, son of 
Brahma, was reborn as the son of the Ten Pracetasas and Marika, pro­
creation came about by sexual intercourse. Before that time it had re­
sulted from mental conception, sight, or touch (LP. 1 .63.2; cf. 
KilP . 1 . 15· 1-2). 
The universe of Brahma, in which Manu Svayambhuva was perfect 
or paradigmatic man, unfolded placidly. Svayambhii, the Self-exist­
ent, desired to produce creatures. Although he was unknowable and 
inconceivable, the mere fact that he desired to produce creatures 
placed him at one remove from the Uncreate, of which nothing what-

soever could be predicated. Svayambhii, being a personification, nec­
essarily and paradoxically brought the fathomless Uncreate within 
the range of human empathy. The Self-existent desired and created 
through thinking, as well as by placing his seed in the waters that his 
thought had created. Without friction or interruption, as though by 
an organic process, Svayambhii extended and substantiated himself 
as Brahma in the cosmic egg. 
Logically and cosmologically, by taking the liberty of presenting a 
sequence of myths in the reverse order of their appearance in their 
respective texts, the ]J.g Veda and the Manu Smrti, the descent of 
Brahma from Svayambhii would have preceded the appearance of 
the Wild God on the cosmic stage. Incipiently, as described in the ]J.g 
Veda, Abhu, the arch-potential, the will-to-live, the first stage of man­
ifesting Mind, hot with creative fervor (tapas), floated in the flood, and 
desire (kama) overcame it as the first seed of mind (RV.IO. 1 2g. 1-4). 
Desire (kama) was the first seed of the mind of the Creator. 
Svayambhii, the Self-existent, and his substantiation as Brahma, 
were not conceived in Vedic time. Svayambhii, the Self-existent, and 
Abhu of the jJ.g Veda (RV. 1O. 1 2g.3), the life potential, each denote a 
starting point, a prime locus of creation. But, whereas Abhu is the life 
germ nascent in the dark flood of emptiness of a cosmos as yet un­
created, Svayambhii is Self-existent as if Uncreate that is beyond 
form and image, beyond darkness, flood, or emptiness. Yet Svayam­
bhii, indefinable as is the Uncreate itself, paradoxically, by being its 
personification, thinks and desires. Thus, utter transcendency 
touches upon the as yet uncreated, which will become created. 
Svayambhii was "born" as Brahma, who, by splitting himself, creί 
ated heaven and earth and man and woman. Svayambhii, Brahma, 
and Svayambhuva Manu--of immutable essence and increasingly 
compact substance-were stages from creative desire in the Self-exist­
ent to creation. The seed, the golden egg, was its substance. Satariipa, 
the woman of a hundred shapes, cosubstantial with Brahma, cooper­
ated with him. 
Brahma, after dividing himself, carried into the world not only the 
unfathomable reality of Svayambhii, to which Manu became the heir, 
but also the desire that had swelled the seed of Svayambhii in the 
waters. It was at one with the first seed of the mind of the Creator 
(RV.IO. 1 2g·3)· 
The genealogy of desire was traced first in the creation hymn of the 

2 1 6 · T H E  A N D ROGY N E  G O D  
lJg Veda (RV. 1O. 1 2g) and in the 5atapatha Brahma'IJa (5B. 10.5.3. 1 ,  3; 
I 1 . 1 .6. I ). According to the hymn, there was in the beginning neither 
nonexistence nor existence, neither death nor life. Ensconced in an 
impenetrable flood of dark emptiness there was mind only; in inner 
incandescence (tapas), mind became, was "born" as Abhu, the life po­
tential. It was overcome by desire (kama) and "that one" (tad ekam) was 
the first seed of mind (manas) (RV. IO. 1 2g. 1 -4).15 From this seed 
sprouted the entire creation. 
Svayambhu, the Self-existent, and Abhu, the essential existent, the 
life potential, were close in meaning. While Abhu, the life potential, 
was created by the fervor (tapas) of mind, Svayambhu created by his 
mind. In the lJg Veda hymn, desire (kama) overcame the life potential 
and became the seed of mind. Kama, in the lineage of Svayambhu, 
arose from the seed of Svayambhu when Brahma, who was Svayam­
bhu now born of his own substance, split the golden egg (cf. 
SB . 1 1 . 1 .6.2) and himself. 
Mind effected its own concretization through tapas, its indwelling 
fervor, and desire overcame the life potential, Abhu, that had formed 
itself in the inner incandescence of mind, in the dark waters of the 
flood of the void. 
Abhu, the life germ, praised in the lJg Veda hymn, was personified 
as Svayambhu in the Manu Smrti, comprising in his germinal person 
both mind and desire. Crowing in substance, Svayambhu became the 
cosmic egg as well as Brahma, the Creator. Brahma (like Prajapati; 
SB . I I . 1 .6.2) dwelled in his egg, the cosmic substance, for one year. 
The year of growth was one cycle of time. Time grew organically in 
the substance of the cosmic egg. Before that it was nonexistent. Kama, 
the desire in Svayambhu, was prior to, and also within, Brahma. 
Tradition is not unanimous about the manner in which Manu came 
to be. Although the direct line of his descent remained unchallenged, 
it lost its unruffled smoothness when attention focused on Brahma, 
the Creator. Brahma's unsuccessful attempts at creating mortals also 
cast their shadow on the events that led to the birth of Manu. Thus, 
the Matsya PuratJa relates that Brahma, dissatisfied with his creative 
work, invoked goddess Cayatri, who is Satarupa in the form of sacred 
speech (MP.3.30-32; cf. BhP.3. 1 2.28-33); she is the most hallowed

Kama. Impulsively, Brahma had cursed Kama. But the involvement 
of Rudra in this curse was provoked by Brahma's deep-seated resent­
ment of Rudra. Its cause lay as far back as the beginning of things. 
Kama released his arrows against Brahma. They inflamed Brahma 
with lust. Kama was an archer like Rudra. Brahma, the Creator, was 
his target. Aeons ago, at the beginning of things, Rudra had let his 
arrow fly against the Father / Prajapati. The arrows of Kama and of 
Rudra flew in opposite directions. Rudra's arrow was sent against the 
Creator, against the inception of life on earth. The arrow of Kama 
incited Brahma with passion and toward procreation. Between these 
two attacks on the Creator-the one the beginning of the myth of 
Rudra and the other of god Kama-Rudra had cqme to be born from 
Brahma. Whereas Rudra, in the course of his ongoing myth, became 
the son of Brahma, Kama (desire) brought about, and from the begin­
ning of things was part of, Brahma. Kama was ingrained in Brahma, 
as it was in Abhu, the life potential. 
Kama was the urge in the creative mind toward manifestation, con­
densation, and substance. The arrows of Kama-<lf which the Purarws 
speak-were directed hitherward. God Kama with his arrows, the ar­
rows of desire, intensified from the outside the urge that had been 
shaping Brahma even before Brahma had come to be. Kama, the god, 
made Brahma flare up in passion when Brahma had seen Gayatri, 
who had sprung from half of his body, and whom he first mistook for 
his daughter. 
The arrows of Kama flew toward this world; they would wound but 
not kill, they would incite passion. Rudra released but one arrow, aim­
ing back and away from creation, at a target that had arisen on the 
horizon. Kama, desire, in the creation hymn of the IJg Veda, was the 
urge into substance, into life embodied in form. Brahma had been 
sustained for one year within the cosmic egg before he split the egg 
into which the seed had grown. The egg was as much a symbol of 
Brahma's world as the linga was the symbol of Siva's world. 
In the myth of Rudra, the seed had been made ready for the Father 
by Rudra. Rudra, the Fire, the spark of life out of the source in the 
beyond, the Uncreate, was its guardian and avenger. The arrow of 
Rudra flew against the Father-against the act of procreation-for 
the sake of the integrity of the Uncreate. When the arrows of Kama 
hit the Creator, their sting incited the passion of Brahma for his 
daughter. Brahma and Kama were c9substantial. However, although 

G E N E ALOGY O F  D E S I R E · 2 1 9 
Brahma-he disliked to admit it-played the role of the Father vis-a­
vis his daughter, and also that of the father of Rudra, Rudra of the 
]J.g Veda had not entered the scene of his own myth as son of the 
Father / Prajapati. Rudra, the Fire, was to become the son of Praja­
pati / Brahma; Kama, desire, was ingrained in Brahma. Before Kama, 
the god, appeared on the stage of the PuraŅas, kama had been in 
Brahma; they were one in origin from Svayambhii. 
As desire (kama) overcame Abhu, so Kama, Desire, overcame 
Brahma: god Kama shot his arrows at Brahma. They excited Brahma 
as he gazed at his daughter Savitri, or Gayatri. Brahma sprouted five 
heads in order better to see Savitri as she walked around him wor­
shipfully and soared upward, escaping from his lustful gaze 
(MP·3·35-40). 
The scene between Brahma and Savitr! was a reenactment of the 
primordial scene augmented by the presence and reactions of the 
sages, the mind-born sons of Brahma, and punctuated by the then­
acquired five heads of Brahma. Rudra, the protagonist in the primor­
dial scene, though he did not act in its restaged version, was present 
in Brahma's curse of Kama. The latter had taken Rudra's place as the 
assailant of the Creator. Hence Kama, "born from Brahma's heart" 
(MP.3. 1O), was to direct his arrows from the universe of Brahma to­
ward Rudra, the Great Yogi. 
According to another version of the myth, Kama was born from the 
mind (manas) of Brahma. This occurred when Brahma had created by 
his mind beautiful Sandhya, the Twilight. (She had been Dawn, 
daughter of the Father, primordially.) Brahma, aroused by her 
beauty, created Kama (S'P.2.2.2 . 1 8-23, 35-36). A late version of the 
myth in the Skanda PuraŅa, relates that Kama was born of Brahma 
after his mind-born sons, and, like them, refused to carry out the 
command of Brahma to procreate. In this version, Kama, in his atti­
tude toward the command of Brahma, acted like Siva, the ascetic son 
of Brahma, though he soon gave up this stance. His flower-arrows 
would not let him maintain it. They were destined to fly off to arouse 
desire and make it blossom (SkP.5.2 . 1 3.2-20). They were not, as a 
rule, directed fatally to pierce to the root. Kama-like Rudra, the 
avenger-was an archer. Kama and Rudra aimed with different pur­
poses at the same target, the Creator himself, whose mind-born sons 
they were. 
The genealogy of Kama had been contained within the universe of 

2 2 0  • T H E  A N D RO G Y N E  GOD 
Brahma. In the myth of Rudra, the figures of the Father, Prajapati, 
and Brahma successively acted out their essential identity. Kama en­
tered the universe of Rudra after Ardhanarisvara let the Great God­
dess send forth her sakti, her power. Then Rudra became the target 
of Kama. Desire entered the world of Rudra. The Great Goddess had 
prepared the way. 
4. THE BIRTH OF SAT! 
According to a version of Brahma's myth-a version in the thrall of 
Siva-it was at the prompting of Siva, present within Brahma, that the 
Creator divided himself in two, male and female (SP.2.l. I6.Jo-J I). It 
is generally held, however, that Brahma, following his own nature 
and precedent, had commanded Siva to divide himself (VaP '9.75-76). 
The exchange of roles gave to Siva precedence over and assigned to 
him immanence in Brahma, whose son he was. Such fluctuations and 
inversions moved around a fixed center outside time, though time 
was just about to begin. The center lay between Rudra, the andro­
gyne, and Brahma, who split the cosmic egg as he split his body. Agni, 
the bull-cow, had been Rudra's theriomorphic image. In anthropo­
morphic likeness the Great God was Ardhanarisvara, the Lord whose 
half is woman. In the visual image created by art, the figure of Siva as 
Ardhanarisvara balances wide-flung curves of the left, female half of 
his body with the firm verticals of the right and male half.11 The im­
age of Ardhanarisvara comprises their diversity, being an indivisible 
whole of two related but different and complementary halves. 
Brahma, on the other hand, is never depicted as androgynous. His 
portly male shape carries a big belly. All the world, in the multitude 
of its shapes, rests within his pregnancy. The image of the male, pot­
bellied Brahma stays through Indian art as that of the parent, whose 
issue, however, is born from his seed or from his mind. 
Siva, the Lord whose half is woman, is an image of wholeness in 
which equivalent parts show their distinction, right and left. Straight 
and static on the one side, of flexed posture and flowing lines on the 
other, the two halves combine in the image of Ardhanarisvara in as 
many varieties of assimilation or contrast as will make whole the im­
age of the Lord. He shows himself half-male, half-female, comprising 
17 The figure of Ardhanarlsvara in Elephanta (pis. 3. 1 1 , 1 2) overemphasizes Siva's 
left half, giving the image a poignancy unrivaled by images of the goddess herself. 

B I RT H  O F  SAT i · 2 2 1 
both natures. They exist in god. In the image of Ardhanarisvara they 
are marked in the difference that their shapes affirm, and that their 
axis in common upholds and denies. Along the vertical axis of the fig­
ure of Ardhanarisvara, cast in bronze or carved in stone, the male and 
female characteristics are iconographically distinct and visually com­
plementary. By assuming the mind-made shape of Ardhanarisvara, 
Lord Siva, paradoxically revealed himself totally in anthropomorphic 
terms. In neither of his two other births from Brahma's head had he 
gone so far as to incorporate comprehensively a human likeness in his 
shape. Before he became Sthal)u he discharged from himself the in­
numerable wild Rudras, and withdrew into his immutable stillness as 
the pillar of self-containment, of tensionless, solidified intensity, face­
less and without body. In his second response he tore out his linga in 
a blaze of fury and set it free. The shape of his severed organ of sex 
became one with the pillar and was accepted by gods and man as the 
cosmic symbol of the Lord. 
Sexual terms and situations are basic to and abound in the myth of 
Siva. Their elementary power, supported by a living tradition and its 
symbols, seizes the devotee and allows him to rise to the level he is 
capable of reaching in approaching Siva. The linga, the comprehen­
sive symbol of Siva in his myth, had to be severed from his body. 
When Brahma asked Siva Ardhanarisvara to divide himself, Siva had 
already done so, though not in his half-man, half-woman shape. Di­
vided, or severed from the body of the Lord, the linga is the total sym­
bol of being and becoming, and signifies Siva, who is before and be­
yond either. 
Sthal)u and linga are each Siva in his wholeness, the one psycholog­
ically, the other ontologically. Sthal)u is the symbol of the destroyer, 
who, as the Great Yogi, abolished all demands and commands that 
would fetter the freedom of his integral state. Being the Lord of 
Yoga, Siva became Sthal)u. Being the Wild God, Rudra tore off his 
linga. It arose as a flaming pillar, the word linga-hermeneutically sig­
nifying the destroyer, as Sthal)u defined himself (eh. VI. l). In nei­
ther of his two responses to Brahma did' Siva fulfill the demand of 
Brahma; he did not create mortals. He did not engender progeny in 
any womb other than that of prakrti, and from it, the original maya, 
the entire universe is born (cf. KUP.2.8.3). 
Ardhanarisvara-half man, half woman-issued from the mouth 
of Brahma, when Brahma, infuriated that all his ascetic exertions did 

2 2 2  • T H E  A N DROGY N E  GOD 
not have the desired result, gave up his life. From the tears he had 
shed in his anger, ghosts and goblins sprang up (LP. 1.4 1 .40-43). They 
were adorned with svastikas. Brahma cursed his austerities that had 
brought about these destructive creatures. As he expired, the vital 
energies, the breaths of life, left his body. Rudra restored to Brahma 
his vital breath, and Brahma, hearing Rudra address him as though 
in a dream, saw standing before him Rudra Ardhanarisvara with 
eight cosmic bodies and eleven fold (LP . 1 .41 .40-SS). 
The Lord whose half is woman both divided himself and remained 
as Rudra. The female half became the Great Goddess, Uma 
(LP. 1.41 .44, SS). While each of his former halves, now god and god­
dess, continued to divide themselves, they carried out literally the ear­
lier order of Brahma (VaP.g.7S-76; cf. LP . 1 .70.3 14-1 S). They did this 
as though unaware of its implied purpose. They neither created nor 
did they procreate mortals. True, the eleven Rudras carried the 
breath of Rudra into all that lived. Specifically, the Great Goddess, on 
being commanded by Siva, divided herself into the polarities of her 
nature, such as black and white, PrȳiIa and SrI, wisdom and wealth. 
From these polarities all the goddesses originated, thousands of them; 
all life was in their thrall (LP . 1 .70.328-344; VaP.g.82-87). 
The proliferat;on of female power by Siva's will, and in execution 
of Brahma's order, continued, but did not meet Brahma's need. 
Brahma finally appealed to the Great Goddess. He did not bypass 
Siva. On the contrary, he bowed to Siva's will, giving up at last his fu­
tile efforts at procreating mankind. He prostrated himself before Siva 
Ardhanansvara, without whose power progeny would not be born. 
Brahma addressed himself to Siva Ardhanarlsvara as though the bi­
partite sexual unity of the Great God prefigured progenitive couples. 
Thereupon, Siva, in his majesty and mercy, detached his female half 
from his body. Brahma introduced himself to Siva, whose shape was 
that of the Great Goddess, the Sakti of Lord Siva. Brahma told her 
that he had been created by Siva, her consort, the lord of gods 
(SP .3.3.2-10, 13- 1 S). Such a deferential reversal of the relationship of 
Brahma and Siva would seem hyperbolic flattery, instead of a graceful 
abdication by Brahma, as Pitamaha, the grandfather, from his role as 
Creator. That role he now passed on to Siva. Brahma, the Creator, 
the Father who had been the target of Rudra, the archer, at the be­
ginning of things, and who became the father of Rudra / Siva, the 
Great God, now made over to the Lord the role of the Creator. 

B I RT H  O F  SAT i • 2 2 3 
Rudra's asceticism, which, at the beginning, he had injected into the 
Father, had worked insidiously in the Creator. His mind-born sons 
were ascetics adverse to the ways of the world. Rudra-Siva himself, by 
a coincidence of cause and effect, became the mind-born son of 
Brahma. Brahma could not go further in spiritualizing hi:> procrea­
tive role. In fact, the spiritualization of his procreative role was a rea­
wakening in Brahma of the primordial mode of creation when Mind 
only became the seed of creation. But this lay far back in the genesis 
of the cosmos. The Creator, however, in his role of the Father or 
Prajapati, Lord of Generation, had been engaged in sexual inter­
course when he was struck by Rudra. Brahma raised the procreative 
activity to his head, whence Rudra was born. This was Rudra's second 
place of birth. In his first birth he had arisen from the seed of Praja­
pati, the lord of progeny. 
Brahma, having come near the end of his mental resources, ap­
pealed to Siva, his son-half man, half woman. From this form of his 
son, Brahma anticipated a fruition of his own asceticism. The inner 
heat generated by his fervid exertions, his tapas, would promote the 
fulfillment of his wish. This hope was founded in the seemingly par­
adoxical effect of asceticism upon sexual and procreative power. He 
relied on the harnessing, concentrating, heightening of his powers by 
tapas. They would achieve the desired result. Lord Siva, the Great 
Yogi, was delighted with Brahma's asceticism, and fulfilled his wish by 
indirection. ArdhanariSvara detached the Great Goddess from his 
body; he created her by separating the female half from his body 
(SP .25'4-9) so that Brahma could address himself directly to her. She 
gave Brahma the power to create women. She agreed to be born as 
the daughter of Daka, the mind-born son of Brahma. For this pur­
pose the Great Goddess Siva created a Sakti equal in splendor to her­
self, who issued from between the brows of the Great Goddess. When 
Siva saw Sakti, the Great God smiled and played his part in the celes­
tial game. He admonished this Sakti, a projection of the Great God­
dess and equal to her in glory, to fulfill the desire of Brahma and be­
come the daughter of Daka. The Great Goddess, having given to 
Brahma the power to create women, reentered the body of Siva. Ever 
since, womankind has been created in the world, and creation became 
sexual (SP.3.3.20-2g; SP.25. 10-28). 
Even before Brahma told Siva that he was created by her consort, 
Siva had addressed Brahma as his dear son (SP .3.3. I 1). He did this in 

2 24

a happy frame of mind, and Brahma confirmed their relationship in 
his appeal to Siva. Not on every occasion when the question of pater­
nity was to arise between Brahma and Siva was inversion or exchange 
of fatherhood and sonship accepted as gracefully. The essential dia­
logue here, however, was not between Siva and Brahma but between 
the Great Goddess and Brahma; it was Siva who helped Brahma to 
overcome the hitherto all-male creative situation. Siva here seemed to 
act only as an intermediary between Brahma and the Great Goddess, 
who, her mission fulfilled, reentered the body of Lord Siva. It was a 
return into the wholeness of Lord Siva, whence she had sprung. Thus 
Siva, after all, if indirectly, played the leading part in the creation of 
the idea of woman. It was now left to Brahma to find a partner for 
her and to set in motion procreation by sexual intercourse. Brahma's 
immediate concern, however, was not to find a mate for the Sakti, 
who was as brilliant as the Great Goddess and had sprung from her 
brow. Instead, he secured a father for her, namely, Dak$a, his son. 
Although Daka was to have many daughters, there was none to com­
pare with the Sakti, who was alike to the Great Goddess and whose 
name was to be Sati', the Real. 
Siva, into whom the Great Goddess returned, who was the ocean of 
mercy and her origin, stood by almost like Sthal)u during the dia­
logue of Brahma, the Creator, with the Great Goddess. Ardha­
nari'svara knew that those who would be born of women, owing to the 
exertions of Brahma, would not see the light of day as the children of 
Siva. Though the Lord whose half is woman encompassed both sexes, 
and though the Great Goddess, after her detachment from the Great 
God and her meeting with Brahma, rejoined Siva Ardhanari'svara, no 
mortals issued from that unity. Sakti, on the other hand, who had 
sprung from and was alike to the Great Goddess, having become the 
daughter of Dak$a, was destined for Siva. Aeon after aeon the Great 
Goddess was to be born to become the bride of Siva. As Sati' she be­
came the daughter of Daka; in a later aeon she was born as Parvati', 
daughter of Parvata Raja, the Mountain Lord. The union of Siva and 
Sati was childless, although it is said that Siva begat four sons in Dak­
ayal)i: they were Hari, Knl)a, Nara, and Narayal)a (VmP.6. 1-2). 
These four names designate Vil)u and some of his avatars. The son­
ship of all the gods or of Vil)u, in particular, was to show the suprem­
acy of Sati, the bride-to-be of Siva, as the Great Goddess and "mother 
of the world" (SP .3.3.2 1 ). Related to such theogonies is the vivid par-

adox and mythical anomaly of Ardhanarisvara, who "by the path of 
yoga enjoyed the female half of himself. . . .  In her he created Vil)u 
and Brahma" (LP . 1 .4 1 . 1O- 1 2). Indeed, Siva meditated on Sati when 
he created the Rudras (VaP. 1O'43-54; LP. 1 .70'303-304)' But when 
Brahma told Rudra, the lord of Sati, to perform creation, Rudra said 
he would not perform creation, he would become Sthal)u, and left for 
Kailasa with Sati (cf. ShP.7.2.9.5- Q; cf. Ch. X.A.l). 
Human beings were not the progeny of Siva and Parvati, nor was 
any immortal born from the sexual union of Siva and the daughter of 
the Mountain Lord. Each of these statements allows for a partial ex­
ception, one being the birth of Karttikeya from Parvati after she 
drank the water of the golden lake of seed (MP. 1 58·34-49; 159.1-3), 
the other being the human incarnation of Siva as King Candra­
sekhara.18 
Siva did not create mortals. He stood by as the Great Goddess, his 
Sakti, who stemmed from him, gave Brahma the power to create 
women. She gave to him of herself, of her own power (sahti) when a 
Sakti issued from her forehead. Brahma gave her to Daka, his son, 
the progenitor, to be his daughter. In this way the power (sahti) of 
Siva, on being detached from Ardhanarisvara, was transferred to the 
progeny of Brahma-to Daka, the progenitor. Sati, at Brahma's be­
hest, was born as the daughter of Daka. Brahma took the leading 
part in establishing Sati in his family or universe. Having discharged 
in anger fiercely glowing Ardhanarisvara from his forehead, how­
ever, and having asked him to separate himself, Brahma performed 
a similar operation on himself, converting his substance into Manu 
and Satarupa. They begat children by sexual intercourse. 
Brahma's many experiments with and modes of creation led in the 
end to his dividing himself into a progenitive couple: Manu and Sata­
rupa. They had four children: two sons and two daughters. One of 
the daughters, Prasuti, the "birth giving," Brahma bestowed on 
Daka, the effective instrument of manifestation, .his mind-born son, 
who proved his competence by producing twenty-four daughters with 
Prasuti (VP . 1 .7. 16-1g, 22). Those who from the age of the Brahmarws 
had charged Prajapati with incest and had not been silenced by the 
age of the Pura1)as were comforted when they understood that 
" One version of the story is succinctly translated in W. D. O'Flaherty, Asceticism and 
Eroticism in the Mythology of Siva, pp. 206-207. The full story is told in Kiilil!i Purii͆ 
(KP) , chapters 46-52.

Brahma embodied the four Vedas and that Satariipa, of a hundred 
forms, in her form as Savitri and Gayatri was the essence itself of the 
Vedas (cf. MP .4.7-10). This redeeming relationship did not help 
Brahma recover from the passion he had felt as Prajapati-and as the 
Father of mankind-for his daughter Uas, the Dawn. Desire over­
came him when he saw Satariipa in one or the other of her forms. 
Creation by self-division had been Brahma's proper mode of oper­
ation from the time he had split the cosmic egg, in which he was born 
and where he had dwelled for a year. The seed of Svayambhii, the 
Self-existent, had grown into the cosmic egg. Desire had made Sva­
yambhii, who contained all the creatures, shed seed so as to produce 
creatures of many kinds from his body. Desire was in Svayambhii 
when he reproduced himself and became Brahma. 
The universe of Brahma, born from the golden egg, carried Kama 
in its substance, since Svayambhii, the Self-existent, deposited his seed 
in the water, until the stage at which Manu, the paradigm of man, was 
created. For this purpose Kama had assumed divine shape. The Great 
Goddess, Siva, in her own right, had created a goddess like herself. 
When that goddess became the daughter of Daka, the son of 
Brahma, the world opened up for women, intercourse, and the pleas­
ure of sex. They were awaiting Manu when he married Satariipa, his 
cosubstantial consort. 
From the left side of Siva and by indirection, the fire of the fierce 
god was transmitted by the Great Goddess to Sati. She needed to be 
born to Daka, son of Brahma, to become real, to exist. Without Sati's 
birth into the universe of Brahma, the flower arrows of Kama would 
have wilted and fallen to the ground. 
When the curtain rose at the beginning of things, only three figures 
could be discerned in the crepuscule of a nascent cosmos: the Father, 
. together with his daughter, and the Wild Hunter aiming his arrow at 
the interlocked pair. Now the curtain rises for the second time, and 
the same gods, some with new names and playing several roles, con­
tinue the play. Brahma has taken over the part of the Father and lord 
of progeny, Prajapati. The Wild Hunter appears in several changes 
of costume. He had already shown himself as the formidable andro­
gyne, radiant, fierce, and vast (VP. 1 .7. 1 2-14), difficult to look at and 
extremely terrible as Ardhanarisvara (KiiP . 1 . 1 1 .3). He detached from 
himself his Sakti, the Great Goddess, who held the stage for only a 
short while to reappear later as Daka's daughter, given to him by

Brahma. Three male figures sprang from Brahma: two mind-born 
ones, the protagonist Rudra-Siva and DakĮa; and Kama, ingrained in 
Brahma and said to have sprung from the heart of Brahma. These 
and Sati, daughter of DakĮa, carry on the divine play, the lila of Siva, 
the Great Lord. But for the presence of another, invisible actor, it 
would never have started. He was an antagonist of Rudra, and one 
whose delaying action interfered with the intent of the Wild God, the 
avenger. He made his presence felt subsequently when Rudra tarried 
under water and DakĮa performed the task assigned to Rudra by the 
Creator. Though the invisible actor was not named in either of these 
relevant scenes, he was most intimately connected with Rudra. He ap­
peared to be antagonistic to Rudra, the avenger, the Lord of Yoga, by 
interfering with his intent, yet he furthered the course of the play that 
had Rudra for its principle actor. A third time his presence loomed 
large, when Sthal)u prevented Brahma from burning up his universe. 
At that time Sthal)u communicated his own being to the silent, invisi­
ble player. Yet another time Rudra recognized himself in this actor, 
who at that meeting had assumed a definite shape and revealed his 
name as Kala, "Time" (Ch. VII.6). If Kama (Desire) is cosubstantial 
with Brahma (the Creator), Kala (Time) is one with Rudra in creation 
and beyond. There Rudra's name is Mahakala (Ch. IX.5). 
5. CREATION OF WOMAN, SEX, AND SENSUAL FULFILLMENT 
In the ongoing myth of Siva, the predicament of Brahma had been 
that he could not create mortals by means of sexual intercourse 
(SP.3.3.4). This insurmountable difficulty went back to the traumatic 
experience of the Father when his intercourse with the daughter had 
been disturbed by the Wild Hunter. The memory of that early morn­
ing, aeons ago, had not left the Creator, although he had, on several 
occasions, produced creatures who mated and multiplied. It is not ex­
plicitly stated in what manner the people whom Brahma had created 
multiplied uncontrollably. The Creator, at that time, found no other 
remedy to stop the unforeseen disastrous increase of living beings 
than by a total conflagration of his universe (MBh. 1 2.248. 1 3-1 7). Al­
though much had happened since that early morning at the begin­
ning, the Creator, the Lord of Generation, remembered his assailant. 
Though the Lord of Generation at that time, in the far away past, had 
immediately bestowed on his attacker lordship over animals for spar-

228 • T H E  A N D RO G Y N E  GOD 
ing his life, the incident had not been closed. In a much later aeon, 
when the Creator was referred to as Brahma and was desperately 
straining to produce creatures through sexual intercourse, he re­
membered the shock he had experienced, when he himself for the 
first time in creation was engaged in that act. His assailant, Rudra, the 
Wild God, came to his mind-and was born from his mind. He, who, 
in the past, had attacked and nearly killed the Creator and disrupted 
his sexual union, would now be the one to enable him to create by 
sexual union. Rudra had the power over life and death, the power to 
avert death and bring about the inception of life. Twice, when 
Brahma had summoned his mind-born son, he disappointed his 
father. Though Rudra was the Lord who comprised the entire cos­
mos, he was primordially the Lord of Yoga. Not that he only sat ab­
sorbed in meditation; he showed his asceticism in his actions, from the 
time when he had appeared as a Wild Hunter to the moment when 
Brahma summoned him and he appeared from the head of the Cre­
ator and became SthaQu, or plunged into the water and cut off his 
linga. When Brahma summoned Rudra for the third time, the Great 
God had taken androgynous shape in the mind of the Creator. In this 
shape, too, Rudra manifested once again as Lord of Yoga. Ardha­
narisvara, the Lord whose half is woman, immense and fiercely blaz .. 
ing, issued from the head of the Creator. He had assumed this heral­
dic device to proclaim the unity of his bipartite appearance. The unity 
was a symbol of his completeness, two halves upheld by him, the Pil­
lar, the axis of the ambivalent shape. He had let the male and female 
shape coalesce in a design whose figures had been those of bull and 
cow when he stood as Agni, the Fire of creation, on its border with 
the Uncreate. Brahma, however, intent on sexual procreation, com­
manded Ardhanarisvara to divide himself. Siva carried out Brahma's 
command, and before the eyes of Brahma, the Great God and the 
Great Goddess stood face to face. At once Siva, the Great Goddess, 
after granting Brahma the boon he desired, was back again within 
Siva Ardhanarisvara. In the short moment of her separateness from 
the Lord, she, like Brahma himself, let issue from her own forehead 
another celestial, a sakti, who was to be born as Sati, the daughter of 
Daka. Sati, the Real, incarnate as goddess, was to be the woman in 
the life of Siva. Emanating from the Great Goddess, she was sent into 
the world of the gods to participate in the mystic play in which Siva 
and Siva are "the sanctifiers of living beings in the entire universe; the 

C R E AT I O N  O F  W O M A N · 2 29 
couple whose bodies are devoid of birth and death and who have 
taken the bodies of an excellent man and a youthful maiden" 
(SP.7. 1 . 1S.3S).19 In the complexities of the divine play into which the 
Great God entered, he assumed a shape, resembling that of man, in 
company with Siva, the goddess. 
Brahma had felt himself unable to produce creatures through sex-
. ual intercourse, since womankind had not emerged from Siva 
(SP.7. 1 . 1S.2). Rudra had discharged from himself the Rudras, whose 
features prognostically included and whimsically portrayed a wide 
range of human types and their activities. But none ofthem was fem­
inine. A male universe was taken for granted. Brahma himself had 
created couples, and Daka his son was to populate heaven and earth, 
but in these efforts of the progenitors woman played no part in her 
own right. She functioned as a copulative adjunct. This was true even 
though the Lord of Generation, Prajapati, having given Nila-Lohita 
(the blue and red god) his names, had, according to PuraI).ic tradition, 
provided each of them with a wife duly named (VP . 1 .8.2-g; 
BhP.3. 1 2 . IO-14). This had been in an earlier aeon, and the wives were 
goddesses and abstractions. Prajapati at that time rewarded the insist­
ence of his demanding son by giving all he had asked and even more, 
in order to establish him fully in the cosmos. At that time Prajapati 
did all he could for his son. Now, however, it was Brahma who needed 
help, troubled as he was by his repeated failure. Something, Brahma 
felt, was lacking, and he knew himself incapable of its creation. Siva 
had failed him when Brahma had charged him with the creation of 
mortals. Brahma had to accept his refusal to procreate, but now a vi­
sion hitherto not conjured by the Creator arose in his mind, and once 
more he let the Lord be born from his forehead. He had the shape of 
Ardhanarisvara. Beholding this immense form, one half of which was 
as much like as it was unlike the other, Brahma asked Ardhanarisvara 
to divide himself. Then Siva, the Great God, divided himself, and his 
left half, the Great Goddess, stood before Brahma. She had been in 
Siva and now, on her own, assumed the role of the Creator. She let 
issue from her forehead her power (sahti) into the cosmos. To become 
real (sat), Sakti had to be born from Daka, the progenitor. The Great 
Goddess, having sent forth her sahti, reentered Siva. The Sakti went 
into the world of the gods, where she was born from Daka as Sari.

• T H E  A N D RO G Y N E  GOD 
Woman was first in god. So that woman should come to be, Lord 
Siva, the Great God, placed the woman in him-she was half of him­
self--outside himself. Then he saw the Great Goddess. Seen sepa­
rately, she was the Great Goddess. She emanated her own power into 
the cosmos to be born by Daka, the progenitor. She became real (sat), 
she became Sati, for she had been born, had been given substantiality. 
Her progenitor Daka passed it on to her from Brahma, the egg-born, 
his father. 
In this way woman, immanent in the Lord, emanated from Ardha­
narisvara and showed herself as the Great Goddess. Standing in tran­
scendency she released her own power to be born in the line of 
Brahma, the Creator. From this side of her ancestry Sati was endowed 
with substantiality, for Brahma, the Pitamaha, the grandfather, had 
been born of and spent a year in the cosmic egg. Along with substan­
tiality, desire was ingrained in her paternal lineage. Desire had come 
to Brahma himself from Svayambhii; it was the first seed of Mind. 
Lord Siva Ardhanarisvara created woman, the Great Goddess, who, 
thus empowered, sent out her own power to be embodied as Sati, the 
Real, when viewed from transcendency, and as the idea of woman, 
when viewed from the world of mortals, who thenceforward would be 
born from the sexual union of a man and a woman. 
In his form of Ardhanarisvara, Rudra completed the work of the 
Creator (SP.3.3. 1 ). In none of his other forms had he manifested the 
goddess within him. He had discharged the Rudras into creation, and 
the universe reverberated with the rhythms of life, but the goddess he 
had retained within him when he became Sthal)u. His total asceticism 
required the female element to be implicated in his self-absorbed ar­
dor. Then, as Ardhanarisvara, the Lord whose half is woman, he di­
vided himself and faced the Great Goddess. Her presence was all 
power. She was transcendental power (Para Sahti), she who would 
discharge her power in innumerable saktis, potent goddesses, who 
would dispense it to all who were destined to exist on earth, their 
home. They would fill it in increasing number, born from the sexual 
embrace of man and woman, children of sensual delight. The im­
mense fire-shape of Ardhanarisvara scintillated in innumerable 
colors of union when the Great Goddess reentered the Lord and Sati 
was being born from Daka, the son of Brahma. Brahma, having re­
produced himself as his son Manu, the progenitor of mankind, co­
habited with her of a hundred forms, Satariipa, his daughter. She was 

C R E A T I O N  O F  W O M A N ' 2 3 1 
totally of Brahma's substance, and Prasiiti, her daughter, who was 
procreation in person, continued the line of Brahma. Sati, born into 
the lineage of Daka, brought to it the power that had descended to 
her from the Great Goddess, the left half of the immense, frightening 
fire in the shape of Ardhanarisvara. 
This is how Siva completed the work of Brahma, the Creator. He 
was called-and Brahmii called him-to complete this work, for it was 
he who had begun it. He, the Fire in creation, .had prepared the seed 
for the Father, the inseminator, the Lord of Generation, Prajiipati; 
and he caused the seed to fall on the earth when he surprised, fright­
ened, or killed Prajiipati in sexual embrace. 
Prajapati was not only the inseminator, he himself prefigured the 
universe: he was its golden germ, Hirar:Iyagarbha (RV. 1O. 1 2 1 . l ;  
TS.5.5. 1 .2; SB. l l . 1 .6.2-7), the golden egg from which was born 
Brahma. Ontologically, the hierarchy of Brahma began with Svayam­
bhii, but historically, in post-Vedic tradition, Brahma came to take the 
place of Prajapati. Svayambhii, the Self-existent, was the ultimate or­
igin of Brahma, a substantiation of mind whereas the seed of the Father 
was prepared by Fire, the spark of life. 
In the universe of the Self-existent, Manu and Satariipa, male and 
female, were the separate manifestations of Brahma, "split up 
through the desire of creating; and these are declared as the parents 
of the creation that sprang into existence" (KS.2.7).20 Creation pro­
ceeded in the cosmos and continued as procreation when Brahmii re­
produced himself as Manu Sviiyambhuva. Manu is the final progeni­
tor of mankind, himself the embodiment of the Self-existent. His 
lineage was flawless, and all was well in the world of Brahma of the 
golden egg, a world of organic metaphysics. 
Prajapati, the inseminator, however, acknowledged Rudra as born 
from his seed. The newborn god had not forgotten the primal scene, 
and he made his father free him from the memory. Shedding his 
seed, the immortal substance, the Father had violated the integrity of ' 
the Uncreate. Rudra, the Fire, having prepared the seed for the 
Father, had incited the Father, who became the target of the arrow of 
the Wild God. When Rudra was born from the seed of the Father, the 
Creator, the double memory of that morning was allayed for Rudra. 
The memory, however, stayed with Brahma, the Creator. Similarly,

Manyu, "Wrath" had stayed with Pr.yapati (Ch. V. l.b). It impeded his 
creative activity. The sexual act at the beginning of things, by which 
he had violated the Uncreate and during which he himself was 
wounded by the Wild God, became the stumbling block in his task of 
creating mankind. The arrow of Rudra, as it struck the Father, had 
injected into him the asceticism of the Great Yogi together with the 
fury of the Wild Hunter. Brahma resorted to mental creation, and his 
mind-born sons were ascetics averse to sexual procreation. At that 
phase Brahma, the Creator, conceived by his mind Rudra, who had 
been born from the seed of Prajapati, the Lord of Generation. When 
Brahma called Rudra to his mind, the Great God issued from the 
head of Brahma and proved himself to be the Great Yogi that he had 
been from the beginning. He who had been the guardian of the Un­
create and avenger of its violation showed its integrity within his own 
being and became Sthal)u. A second time, when Brahma thought of 
Rudra and let him be born from his mind, the Lord of Yoga resorted 
to the waters and remained immersed in them. This was an ambigu­
ous response. He clarified it on emerging from the water. He tore off 
his organ of sex. He did it in anger, perhaps as a gesture of expiation 
for having originally struck the Father while he was engaged in the 
sexual act. Rudra set free his linga. 
The third time Brahma called upon Rudra, the Great God, the 
Lord of Yogis, he manifested from the head of Brahma as the Lord 
whose half is woman. To Brahma this manifestation in its fiery glow · 
appeared to hold the promise of becoming a couple that would unite 
sexually. Brahma's mind was set on sexual procreation as the condi­
tion for mortals to people the earth. 
Once, aeons ago, when nothing else existed but Purua, and crea­
tion had not yet begun, supernal man let himself become two. From 
that arose husband and wife. He united with her. From that union 
mankind was born (BrUp. l .4.3). Purua divided himself because he. 
was alone; nothing existed besides himself. He was afraid, but had no 
reason to be afraid, since there was none to fear (BrUp. 1 .4.2). Yet, 
being alone, he also had no delight, and for this reason desired a sec­
ond (BrUp. 1 .4.3). Ardhanarisvara had no desire. He was not alone. 
He was all in one, male and female, a single unity. At Brahma's comဧ 
mand the Lord Siva, whose half is woman, divided himself and let his 
Power, his Sakti, be seen by him and by Brahma. She was the Great 
Goddess, a woman in shape, all fire. Woman is fire; the delights of sex 

C R E AT I O N  O F  W O M A N · 2 3 3  
are its sparks (cf. BrUp.6.2. 13). The Great Goddess, the transcenden­
tal Sakti, sent forth her power to be born as Sati, real in the world of 
Brahma. 
Rudra, who is Agni, Fire, sent forth one-half of his glowing self, 
which had the shape of woman. The Great Goddess had already reen­
tered the Lord when her fire power had burned its way into the lap 
of Sati, who was to become the bride of Siva. Rudra, in the form of 
Ardhanarisvara, divided his body of fire. The Great Goddess stood 
before him, glowing, and then reentered his shape. The Lord had 
separated her from himself to send her glowing ardor, shaped like 
her, like a woman, into the world of the gods, which was ready to re­
ceive her. Brahma granted this boon to the Great Goddess, who be­
came the daughter of his mind-born or thumb-born son Daka. In his 
own substance, and following upon the self-division of Ardha­
narlsvara, Brahma reproduced himself as Manu and Satarupa.21 The 
progeny from the union of Manu and Satarupa were not carnal hu­
manity (VP. 1 .7· 16-3S)· Their progeny represented the qualities, pro­
pensities, aspirations, predicaments, and activities that were prognos­
tications of the human condition (VP.1 .7.20-3S; VtiP. 1O. 16-28).22 
These Rudra had been loath to create. Even so, they were the issue of 
Brahma's or Manu's intercourse with Satarupa, and intercourse 
would not have come to be had not the Great Goddess sent her Sakti 
to be born as the reality of woman, that is as the idea or archetype of 
woman, comprising all her faculties, including her sex and sexuality. 
That the Great Goddess sent out her power in the likeness of herself 
into the sexual act and its joy was due to Ardhanarisvara's self-divi­
sion. Then only could Manu-or Brahma-and Satarupa beget the 
human race as it came forth, adumbrated by all its qualifications. 
Ardhanarisvara sent out of himself his fire power, his sahli, and let 
it be born as the idea of woman, sex, and sensuality. Siva did not cre­
ate mankind. Mankind was eventually born in the line of Brahma. 
From that line Sati had received just enough substantiality to make 
her real as the idea of woman, while also being essentially the Great 
Goddess. 
Sthal).u, the post, withdrawn into himself, let his fire burn perpet­
ually upward, consuming and destroying all but itself. The Great Yogi 
is one in nature with the Lord whose half is woman. At will, be it even

at the command of Brahma, Lord Siva directs his fire to create or to 
destroy, to create while destroying, or even to destroy while creating 
the objects that change their names and shapes while the fire keeps 
burning. 
In his form of Ardhanarisvara, Rudra completed the work of the 
Creator. The Wild God, as Agni, had begun it. In the shape of an 
archer he had interrupted the first sexual embrace in which the 
Father shed the substance of the Uncreate. It was a rape; Dawn, his 
daughter and partner, fled. In his form of Ardhanarisvara, Rudra let 
the Great Goddess out of himself to transmit her power to Sati, who 
was at once like the Great Goddess and like woman-to-be. She would 
bring to every sexual embrace the fire of the goddess who stems from 
Siva, the Lord. Brahma experienced bliss as creation became sexual 
(SP .3.3.27-29). 
The sexualization of Siva's world was channeled from the Great 
God through his Supreme Sakti, who was one with him as Ardha­
narisvara, to her Power or Sakti. She was born as Sati, the daughter of 
Daka. The emblematic unity of Ardhanarisvara was split and difဨ 
fused in a heterosexual world, which the Great Goddess had brought 
about at the request of Brahma. Just as Siva had severed his linga and 
set it free in the cosmos, the Lord whose half is woman let the Great 
Goddess step out of his body and create the female sex. Siva took the 
linga back to his body, and the Great Goddess reentered the Lord. 
Each of these separations was of abiding consequence; they refer back 
to the unity whence they have sprung. The Great Goddess played her 
own part as Sati and, in another aeon, as Uma or Parvati, the daugh­
ter of the Mountain and consort of Siva. The togetherness, meetings, 
and separations of the Great God and the Great Goddess, as Siva and 
Sati or Siva and Parvati, play on all the strings of sensibility, passion, 
and understanding that resound in human beings. Embodied among 
the other gods, the transcendental Sakti took upon herself her tragic 
role as Sati, and the Great God mourned her death. Siva and Sati, Siva 
and Parvati, for the sake of mortals, were to play their roles among 
the gods as if they were human. In this way Siva and Brahma came to 
terms. Brahma had wanted his recalcitrant son to create mortals, and 
Siva carried out this command by creating the possibilities and pat­
terns of human life prefigured in the world of the gods. 
The Supreme Sakti, the Great Goddess, her mission fulfilled, en­
tered Ardhanarisvara. The visual image of the androgyne, though 

C R E A T I O N  O F  WOMAN · 2 3 5  
timeless, answered to both stages in the myth of Ardhanarisvara. In 
this manifestation, Lord Siva was born androgyne. When the tran­
scendental Sakti returned into his body, he was once more the andro­
gyne Lord, which he had not ceased to be. The eternal image, having 
discharged its meaning into the action of the myth, resorbed it. The 
timeless, changeless image was a seal that comprised, in its paradoxi­
cal unity, the simultaneous and equivalent existence of opposite enti­
ties. 
A reflection of this image, transposed into temporal sequence, may 
be seen in a legend transmitted in varying accounts from the Riimii­
yarw (7.78-8 1 )  to a late Puriirw version (BDP.l.S3.So-SS). In the leg­
end as told in the Riimiiyarw, the state of androgyny is phased in suc­
cessive stages of one month's duration. Here is told the tale of King 
Ila, son of Kardama Prajapati; a powerful and just ruler (R.7.78.3-7). 
It takes place at a time when, after the death ofSati, Siva had married 
Parvati. 
Once, while hunting in a forest and having killed hundreds of thou­
sands of wild animals, King Ila entered a grove, the pleasance of Siva. 
On that occasion the Lord, in order to please the goddess, who was 
then his wife Uma, the daughter of the Mountain (Parvati ), had as­
sumed the shape of a woman (R .7.78.8- 1 2), and, accordingly, all male 
creatures in the forest were changed into females: there were no male 
animals to be seen anywhere in the forest (R.7.78. 1 2-13). On entering 
the forest Ila and his retinue all became women (R .7.78. 14- 1 S). The 
grove had been enchanted. Ila felt sorry for himself, but he was filled 
with fear when he realized that all the femininity had been caused by 
the Lord of Uma (R .7.78. 16). King Ila then entered into the presence 
of Siva. The Great Lord spoke smilingly and let Ila ask for any boon 
of his choice, except manhood (R.7.78. 1 7- 1 9). King Ila refrained 
from asking Siva for any boon and addressed himself to Parvati. With 
the consent of Rudra, Devi gave Ila a boon, half of it on her behalf, 
the other on that of Siva. The boon was that Ila would live half of his 
life as a woman and the other half as a man. Ila was pleased. He sug­
gested to the goddess that he live as a very beautiful woman for one 
month and as a man for the next month (R.7.78.20-26). The goddess 
agreed but added that while male, Ila would not remember his female 
form, and while female he would not remember his male form 
(R·7·78.27-28). 
In the first month Ila, the most beautiful woman in the three

worlds, wandering in the forest, came to a pond. There she saw 
Budha (the planet Mercury), shining like the moon, himself the son 
of the moon, practicing austerities in the water. Ba marveled at the 
sight (R.7.7g.5- 1 1). Budha, on seeing the girl, more beautiful than 
any celestial being, thought her fit to become his wife. He came out of 
the water and, on hearing that she was her own mistress and had no 
husband, proposed that she with her friends dwell on the mountain 
with him (R .7.7g. 1 2-24). Budha made love to Ila in the month of 
Madhu (March-April) (R.7.80.6-8). When the month was over, Ila, be­
coming Ila, awoke one morning and saw Budha doing tapas in the 
pond, his arms raised to the sky. King Ila was persuaded by Budha to 
remain in the forest. In the ninth month Ba gave birth to the son of 
Budha and turned the child over to its father (R .7.80.9-25). When Ila 
had once more become a man, Budha undertook to remedy Ila's 
state, and hence a horse sacrifice to Siva was undertaken. Siva was 
pleased, and granted Ila his manhood (R.7.81 .4-1 9)' King Ila 
founded the city of Prati˷hana (R .7.81 .2 1 ), and his son Puriiravas. 
succeeded him (R .7.81.22-23). According to the Mahabharata, Ila is re­
membered as both mother and father of Puriiravas (MBh. 1 .7o. 16).١ 
This mode of parentage would have been more appropriate in 
Brahma's world than in Siva's. 
The effect on Siva of his creation of the goddess from within him" 
self was so powerful that the Great God himself, as told in the Rama­
yafla story of Ila, assumed the shape of a woman in order to please the 
goddess (R .7 .78. 1 1 - 1 2) by being like her. The grove that surroundeQ 
Siva and Vma responded: its trees and the animals also became fe­
male. The mighty King Ila, entering the grove, succumbed to the 
spell and became a woman, Ila. Siva, having already as Ardha..: 
narisvara hypostasized the woman in himself, now to please the god­
dess took the shape of woman and caused all life in the enchanted 
grove to become female. King Ila, shocked at the transformation and 
realizing that Siva had brought it about, was allowed by Siva to ask for 
any boon--except that of manhood. Ila, dumbfounded, did not re­
spond to the Great God held in the thrall of the feminine. She turned 
to the goddess, who, in her equanimity and with the consent of Siva, 
gave the boon, half on her own account, half on that of Siva. The 
boon given to Ila was a divided life. During one half she would be a 
woman, during the other a man. Ila expressed her gratitude, while 
asking for a modification of the boon. The modification involved the 

C R E A T I O N  O F  W O M A N · 2 3 7  
question of timing the gift, so that she might change her sex every 
month. Vma granted the request on condition that no memory would 
connect the two sexes of Ila / Ila. Ila / Ila was thus the first androgyne 
in the world of time, leading a split life that ran its course on a level 
below that of the timeless validity of the transcendental image of the 
Supreme Lord whose half is woman. 
In between the transcendental plane, whence the image of the Su­
preme Lord whose half is woman shines forth, and the creaturely 
world, lies the region of the gods, where Siva together with Parvati had 
taken residence on Mount Kailasa. Uma, beseeched by Ila and with 
due reference to Siva, favored her with a decision that meticulously 
did justice to the equality of the male and the female factors on the 
side of the givers and the recipients of the boon. It was conceded, 
however, with one particular clause, involving the lack of memory of 
Ila as Ila and of Ila as Ila. The unity of the male and female in Ardha­
narisvara was withheld from Ila as well as from Ila. Like beads of two 
different colors, the male and the female condition were strung with­
out interval and without consciousness of one another. They were 
strung on the thread of the life of Ila, who was not to know that she 
was and would be again King Ila. At the end, Ila having fulfilled her 
female role in giving birth to Pururavas, and having once more be­
come I1a, Lord Siva granted lifelong manhood to King Ila. The desire 
for manhood prevailed over the satisfaction that Ila experienced in 
the months when she enjoyed extreme beauty and motherhood. 
In other versions of the legend of Ila / Ila, it was Parvati who not 
only gave the boon to Ila but also caused the spell to be cast over the 
sacred grove. Once, when the seven sages had come to the sacred 
grove to see Siva, they found the god and Parvati making love. The 
goddess, getting up naked and ashamed, said to Siva that anyone in 
the future who would cross the boundary of the grove and enter the 
hermitage would become a woman (VaP.85.25). Or again it was Siva, 
Who, for the satisfaction of Parvati, cast a spell over the grove, prom­
ising her the transformation of any future intruder (DBhP. 1 . 1 2. 16-
23; BhP .9. 1 .23-33; cf. MP . 1 1 .45-46). 
Regardless of whether it was Parvati herself or Siva who cast the 
spell over the sacred grove, the goddess was its cause. She had entered 
first, in an earlier aeon, the life of Siva as Sati. Born in the present 
aeon as Parvati, the goddess in the exercise of her sexual role used 
her spell-binding power when her love-making with Siva was inter-

rupted. Siva, the Lord whose half is woman on the transcendental 
plane, was, on the level of the gods, the husband of the goddess Peir­
vati, who herself or through her lord asserted herself. The spell to 
which Ila succumbed was an application, on the level of the gods, of 
the power that the Great Goddess had discharged from herself. 
Caught and offended by the sages in the exercise of her sexual role, 
she remonstrated by turning, on her own account or by the will of 
Siva, male into female. Thus, the state of transcendental unity, which 
she had left, was adjusted to the dimension of time. She carried her 
spell even further and deprived Ila / Ilei of memory, identity, or 
wholeness. The legend of Ila / Ilei is a sequel in reverse to the mani­
festation of Siva, the Great God, as androgyne. 
The discontinuity in the form of Ila / Ilei changing sex terminated 
when Ila regained his manhood permanently. This he did by means 
of a horse sacrifice to Siva, and Siva was pleased (R.7.8 1 . 1 4-1S). The 
legend of Ila's changes of sex, accompanied by a loss of memory, has 
a happy end, inasmuch as his masculinity was restored forever. 
Though the goddess directly or indirectly had caused the change 
from male to female, in the end it was Siva who restored Ila's man­
hood. King Ila was a mortal, his changing sex was but a refraction in 
the mirror of time of Ardhaneirisvara's timeless being. 
Another king, similarly, though in the distant past, had also been 
destined to change his sex, a retribution by the god Indra, whom the 
king had annoyed. King Bhangeisvana, however, changed into a 
woman, did not suffer a loss of memory, and was able to assess her 
life as woman and her life as man. Consequently, she implored Indra 
to allow her to remain a woman, for the affection of women is greater 
than that of men, and the pleasure that women enjoy during inter­
course is always much greater than that of men. Indra fulfilled her 
wish (MBh.13.1 2.2-g, 29-49). 
The Lord whose half is woman, having singled out that half from 
himself, made it possible for the Great Goddess to send her power 
into the world. This power was substantiated and realized among the 
gods in the shape of Sati, and it made itself felt henceforward in the 
female sex and in the joy of intercourse. These could not have come 
about had not Siva "exposed" the goddess from his body. She stood 
in front of him; she was addressed by Brahmei before she returned 
into Siva. Brahma appealed to her power; and having made it come 
true, or realized it, she returned into the Lord. By sexualizing the 

C RE A T I O N  O F  W O M A N ' 2 3 9 
world, Siva enabled mortals, whom he did not himself create but 
whose birth, after much reluctance, he now had made possible, to de­
light in sex. By sending the Great Goddess out of himself, duality 
came into the world. 
Jla / Ila, the mortal, a king and thus in a privileged position, was 
given little choice when the female sex had already been imposed on 
him by Siva. Siva meant to deprive him of his manhood for having 
disturbed the love-making of the god and having annoyed the god­
dess, in particular. She, however, made Siva agree to her suggestion 
of a compromise by which King Ila would have the benefit of alter­
nating periods of masculinity and femininity. This was a questionable 
boon, as the goddess deprived him of the memory of his life in one 
state when he was in the other (R .7.78.20-28). It was left to a star, 
Budha, the planet Mercury, to initiate the horse sacrifice to Siva, by 
means of which King Ila remained a man for the rest of his life. 
Whereas it is not reported if King Ila was allowed to recollect his past 
and link in his person the double experience, another king, Bhanga­
svana, another plaything in the hands of a god, successively experi­
enced the joys and sufferings of the life of a woman and that of a 
man. Given the freedom of choice out of his comprehensive sexual 
experience, he decided to be a woman (MBh. 1 3. 1 2.2g-49). 
Ardhanarisvara, whose image prefigured in one body the possibil­
ity of sexual awareness of both sexes, completed the creation of 
Brahma. Though he did not create mortals, he made it possible for 
them to come into existence by issuing the half of him that is the Great 
Goddess into the world. Her sex came into existence with the birth of 
Sati, who was destined by Brahma to become the true bride of Siva. 
This goddess consumed her body in the fire of her yoga. In a later 
aeon, the sexual union of Siva and Parvati was beyond compare; on 
one occasion Siva made love to her for a thousand years (SP.2.4. 1 .27-
28). The love-making of Siva and Parvati was as hot as fire, for Rudra 
is Fire, and there was no end to their love play, for the Great Yogi 
retained the semen in his body. The love-making of the Great God, 
even considering that he was the Lord of Yoga, was different from 
any other, human or divine. "The great god, Mahesvara, never de­
lights with a wife distinct from his own self . . . .  The joy within him is 
called the goddess. Siva is not outside him" (KUP.2.3 1 .20-2 1 ). 
Rudra, the Fire, had prepared the seed for the Father. Ardha­
narisvara sent out of himself the woman in him, his creative power, 

2 40

his sahti, into the universe of Brahma. She was born, became "real." 
Satl was the idea of woman realized on the level of the gods. From 
that time the consciousness and exercise of sex came into the world. 
By its power, gods, demons, sages, the ancestors ( pitr), and kings were 
created (M. 1 .34-37), the hierarchy of the human condition, whose 
progenitors were Manu and Daka ( VP . 1 .7. 16-22). Sending his 
power, the Goddess, into the world, Siva completed the creation of 
Brahma. From that time sexuality came into the world, as did mortal 
men and women (cf. SP.25.5-28). 
In his primordial manifestation, Rudra, the archer, interrupted the 
sexual act of the Father. Seed was shed. The substance of the Un­
create fell on the earth. This was at the beginning of the myth of 
Rudra, as told in the IJ.g Veda. From Prajapati, the Lord of Genera­
tion, according to the Briihmatlas, Rudra arose. He was born into the 
cosmos and he, the son of Brahma, became the cosmos, Atamiirti. 
The elements, time, space, and man-the initiate-were his domain. 
In the fivefold universe of the Pancabrahmans sex played no part in 
heaven or on earth; although in transcendency, Purua was distin­
guished from Prakrti. The linga implied these two categories (Ch. 
VII.4). Siva permitted to step out from within himself the Great God­
dess, who is an image of Prakrti in the form she had within Ardha­
narlsvara. By the power of the Great Goddess, Satl came to be born as 
a daughter of Daka, the progenitor. 
Rudra, the archer, was the avenger of the rupture of the Uncreate. 
Its integral substance had flowed into creation. Rudra, the mind-born 
son of Brahma, his seed drawn up within Sthal)u, became the pillar 
of self-containment, a form as abstract in shape as it was anthropo­
morphic by allusion. This shape of Rudra the yogi, the ascetic, was a 
symbol of the state of transcendental wholeness as it had been before 
anything came to be. Yogic austerities were the means of attaining 
that state. As lord of yogis (SP.24.64-66), Siva became Ardhanarisvara 
(SP .25'5-9). His shape as androgyne had the vertical of the pillar for 
its axis. Sthal)u and Ardhanarisvara were cognate forms of Siva, born 
from Brahma, consistent in the opposed meanings that coexist within 
Lord Siva. Rudra had so deeply injected his asceticism into Brahma 
that the Creator had become impotent as procreator of the human 
race. It was for Siva to remedy this incapacity. At Brahma's request, 
Ardhanarlsvara gave half of his glowing self out into the world, which 
became sensitized with sexuality and peopled by mortals, susceptible

to the arrows of Kama. It was Kama who, bewildering men and 
women with his five flower-arrows, carried on the eternal creation 
(SP.2.2.2·37)· 
6. Yoni AND Linga 
Kama, desire, had arisen in the heat (tapas) of the nascent cosmos of 
Tad Ekam "That One," the arch-potential, Abhu (RV. 1O. 1 2g.2). Full­
fledged, god Kama manifested in front of Brahma when Brahma de­
sired Gayatrl. Kama let fly his arrows in all directions. Brahma was the 
nearest victim, and Rudra, the lord of yogis, was the ultimate target. 
Prior to the attack of Kama, Siva did not ever yield to desire. He 
glowed with heat and fire, radiant as NIIa-Lohita. His eyes were sun, 
moon, and fire itself (KUP.2.S.g), shining and flaming. Downward 
from the thighs he was blazing fire; the upper half of his body was 
like the moon. With that auspicious moon quality he practiced asceti­
cism, while his terrible blazing form below burned everything, de­
vouring flesh, blood, and marrow (MBh.7. 1 73.9S-98). Thus, with the 
lower half of his self he was the destroyer, but there also burned the 
fire of sex. 
In the Deodar forest, the Lord had played with it. He held his na­
ked linga in his hand; the sight inflamed the women of the sages 
(SP .4. 1 2 . 10-1 3). If he himself was aloof, his mere presence spelled se­
duction. It roused the sages to action. The linga, the organ oflust, had 
to fall. The Lord, the Supreme Beggar, in a situation of escalating 
passion and fury, let his linga be torn off by the fis, or by himself. He 
had been playing an ambiguous game. It was terminated by the cata­
clysmic fall of the linga, whether the sages cursed the linga to fall 
(SP .4. 1 2. 1 7- 1 8), or whether it was Siva's will to let it fall (BP . 1.2.27.32-
33). When it fell, it burned everything before it like fire. It did not 
stop anywhere, went into hell and heaven, and agitated all creatures 
on earth (SP.4. 1 2. 1g-2 1 ). It is said that the sages, who had not recog­
nized the god, wentto Brahma to ask his help against the devastating 
power of the linga set free, of sex let loose (SP.4. 1 2.22). Brai;tma, 
knowing that no good would come to the three worlds as long as the 
linga could not be made to stand still, advised the desperate sages to 
propitiate Devi, to beseech the Great Goddess to take the form of the 
yoni, the womb. There the linga would come to rest (SP.4. 1 2.28-32). 
Then the sages and the gods worshiped Siva. He assured them of 

2 4 2  • T H E  A N D RO G Y N E  GOD 
happiness when his linga would be held in a yoni, but no woman ex­
cept Parvatl would be able to hold the linga of Siva. Held by her, the 
linga would at once become still (SP -4- 1 2.43-46). Hence, Parvati in the 
form of the yoni would be the pedestal in which the linga would be 
installed. 
At the end of its journey, the raging, severed linga of the lord stood 
still, in yogic control, in Parvati's yoni. The goddess, reduced to the 
female sex organ in its form as architectural symbol and cult object, 
was conceived as the counterpart of and supplement to the severed 
linga. Together they were installed on earth, their place of worship. 
The cult object of the linga combined with a yoni shows the cylindrical 
shape of the former rising from a pedestal with a spout-like elonga­
tion. The latter fulfills a practical purpose: it allows the water, poured 
in worship over the "burning hot" stone linga, to flow off its base. The 
pedestal, serving a utilitarian purpose, came to signify the yoni. The 
iirdhvalinga rises from this base as Agni, the flame of fire, rose from 
the sacrificial altar, itsyoni (RV. 1 . 140. 1 ;  3.5.7; lO.91 .4). The linga does 
not enter the yoni. 
The linga in the yoni is a paradoxical visual symbol. In ancient times, 
the urdhvaliitga of the Lord, set up for worship, rose from the ground 
or a plinth, and no yoni was part of the sacred symbol. The mythical 
account of the entry of the linga into the yoni related in the Siva Puro,­
Ņa reduced the cosmic dimension of the linga to its basic function as 
penis. The reduction in meaning as conveyed by the myth, however, 
was in line with the naturalism of the shape of the earliest lingas seဩ 
up for worship. Between the explicitly phallic shape of the earliest lin­
gas and the later, abstract pillar shape of the linga lay the symbolic sat­
uration of this vertical sign with ontological meaning. Between the ab­
stract pillar shape by itself and its setting in the yoni lay a return to the 
primary phallic meaning. If the early "naturalistic" shape was shown 
turgid with life-giving power in which inhered all the possibilities of 
generation and modalities of existence, the linga in the yoni focuses on 
the sexual situation of coitus, introducing into it, however, the para­
dox of the urdhvalinga as a sign of iirdhvaretas (Ch. 1.3). The latter conဪ 
notes the retention, ascent, and transformation of the seed within the 
body of the lord of yogis. The abstract, geometrical shape, however, 
of the iirdhvalinga, the repository of the ontology of existence, placed 
on the yoni as its pedestal, rises out of the yoni, the womb; it does not 

YONI A N D  LINGA 
• 2 4 3  
enter it. The "linga in the yoni" emerges from the yoni; it does not pen­
etrate it. This paradox in the coital proximity of the sexual symbols is 
consonant with and amplifies that of the linga itself. 
Siva as SthaI}u, the pillar, and Siva in the millennial embrace of Par­
vati are seemingly antithetic images, in each of which, however­
though different in emphasis-the Great God reveals his yogic and 
phallic being. It was during the endless love-making of the Lord with 
the goddess that the sage Bhrgu called on Siva. The sage wanted to 
find out if Siva truly was the greatest god. Siva, however, did not re­
ceive the sage, because he was in union with the goddess. Offended, 
Bhrgu cursed Siva that he would have the shape of yoni-and-linga 
(PP.6.282.1g-31 ). 
Here Siva, cursed by Bhrgu, took the shape of yoni-and-linga. The 
linga-yoni symbol was not the only form of Siva resulting from a curse 
by a sage. When the linga fell in the Deodar forest, the future worship 
of the linga also resulted from a curse. In that myth, "in some ver­
sions, Siva is said to be cursed to be worshipped as the linga, while in 
others he himself curses the sages to worship him as the linga."23 The 
excess of sexual power emanating from the Great God was hard for 
the sages to endure. The object of their aversion was cursed, or they 
were cursed by Siva to worship the linga. 
In ancient times, the phallus worshipers were kept away from the 
sacrifice (RV.7.2 1 .S), and god Indra made short shrift of them. They 
were slain by him (RV. 1O.g9.3). The sages, who, in their own way, ad­
hered to the tradition of the sacrifice, were cursed by Siva to become 
linga worshipers, while they themselves cursed Siva to be worshiped 
in the linga. It was an uneasy transition for the sages, from sacrificial 
offerings to linga worship. In the ongoing myth of Siva, moreover, 
linga and yoni not only retained their value as mere symbols but be­
came actors. 
According to the Brhaddharma Puriirza, Siva, absorbed in yogic 
trance, was apprehended by the goddess. She failed to arouse him 
from his meditation, but he could not help noticing her presence, as 
she had taken the shape of a foul-smelling corpse. Siva returned to 
his trance. The Great Yogi then assumed the shape of the linga, and 
the goddess took the shape of the yoni. She placed the linga within her 
23 w. D. O'Flaherty, Asceticism and Eroticism in the Mythology o/Siva, p. 1 80.

and plunged into the water to create progeny (BDP. 1 .31 . 16-36), car­
rying out what Siva had postponed and avoided when he had plunged 
into the water (Ch. VI.3). The combined symbol shape of linga and 
yoni in this late, Tantric myth was separated into its constituent parts, 
which were personified as god and goddess until they resumed their 
original position in nature during coitus. The active part was played 
by the goddess. In the above parable, her anthropomorphic, symbolic 
shape was that of a putrid corpse. 
The goddess, in anthropomorphic form and not in the shape of the 
yoni, became part of the linga in the homology of the Vi$rtudharmottara 
Puriirta (VDhP.3.48.4-8).Z4 There, the five mantras or thought forms of 
Siva embodied in the linga with its five faces were homologized with 
five different aspects of the Lord. The Viimadeva mantra, represented 
by the face of Vamadeva, was equated with that of Vma or Parvati, 
the Great Goddess. The face of Vamadeva, the lovely (viima) god, was 
that of woman, adorable in her absorption in samiidhi, fulfilled like the 
open lotus flower in her hand (PI. 10). Vamadeva evoked woman and 
sex. A chant, based on intercourse, is called the Viimadevya siiman or 
chanted meditation on Vamadeva (ChUP.2. 13. 1 -2). The chant is struc­
tured, or progresses, like the ritual of love. It begins with the invita­
tion or invocation of the deity, proceeds to the request, which is the 
preliminary laud, on to the lying down with the woman, which is the 
hymn of glory, and on to the parting, which is the concluding hymn.25 
The structure of the Vedic ritual is at one with the progress of the 
lovers in the Viimadevya chant of the Chiindogya Upani$ad, just as the 
goddess and Siva Mantramurti coincide in the Vamadeva face of the 
image carved in Elephanta and described in the Vi$rtudharmottara 
Puriirta. 
The goddess was sent out from within Ardhanarisvara, and she 
reentered his body. Between these two movements, Sati, her likeness, 
came to exist, the image of femininity. She was Prakrti given anthro­
pomorphic shape, and her ways, though they prefigured those of the 
human condition, were transposed to the world of the gods. She was 
to be the bride of Siva, who was her origin. Their union would be a 
reunion, with the linga in the yoni as its sign.

By a further reduction of the linga to its natural function, it is said 
that the universe was created from the seed emitted from the linga of 
Siva during the sexual act, and the gods worshiped that linga.26 
The obvious phallic basis of the sign of the Great God was never 
forgotten in any of the myths or forms of the Siva linga, but no myth, 
it would seem, tells the story of how the universe was created from the 
seed that poured out of the linga of Siva. It was the seed of Prajapati 
that fulfilled that function when it flowed down so copiously that it 
formed a lake (Ch. I1l.l). Reversal of the roles of Prajapati-Brahma 
and Siva was part of the relationship of these gods as father and son. 
Their relation was considered reversible from the age of the Brah­
ma1}OS: it was the twofold relation of Prajapati and Agni, of Agni and 
Prajapati, as father and son (SB .6. 1.2.27). The two gods embodied the 
Creator as substance oflife and as spark oflife, both the cause oflife, 
material and efficient cause, in the conjoint work of creation. The in­
teraction of the two gods was fundamental to the myth of Rudra­
Siva.27 Whereas the reversible relationship as father and soh cost 
Brahma his fifth head, the Siva-linga, almost ironically, by an appro­
priation of Prajapati's mode of operation, was represented as sexual 
creator. Invested with this meaning, the linga stood diametrically op­
posite to the avenger of the primal, procreative act of the Father, for 
whom Rudra had prepared the seed. Rudra, the yogi and bearer of 
the seed, restrained the seed within himself, or he let it flow at will; by 
indirection only, one or the other god or sage was to arise from it. For 
this purpose Rudra had to be born from the seed of Prajapati, the 
Lord of Generation, who endowed his son with the cosmos; and 
Rudra had to be born as Ardhanarisvara from the torment and fury 
of Brahma's, the Creator's, mind. In creation, Rudra, of innumerable 
names and shapes, has but one sign of his totality, the urdhvalinga, un­
mistakable in its shape, ambiguous in its meaning. Ardhanarisvara 
was born fierce and ambivalent in order to complete the work of 
Brahma's creation. In Ardhanarisvara, who embraced both the sexes 
presents a long note on the interpretation of the chant as a "description of the union of 
the human soul with the Divine Beloved," p. 1 3 1 .  
26 Cf. ibid., p. 228. 
27 The opposition and identity of Prajapati-Brahma and Agni-Rudra and also, most 
cogently, their complementarity have been demonstrated at length by W. D. 
O'Flaherty, Ascetisicm and Eroticism in the Mythology 01 Siva , pp. 1 1 1 -40. 

246 '  T H E  A N D RO G Y N E  GOD 
and was beyond them, was the intimate and ultimate origin of the 
communion of the male and female principles, a paradoxical prog­
nosis of sensual fulfilment. Desire had no part in the world of Ardha­
nansvara. 
Kama, Desire, the god of love, had not as yet intruded into the 
myth of Siva. His attack on the lord of yogis was still to come. Still, it 
is said that because Siva remembered Kama, the eternal linga of Siva 
rose on earth (SkP .7. 1 .200.9-30). Kama, it seems, lived in the perfect 
and prognostic memory of Siva, the Great Yogi, just as the primordial 
scene had been stored in the memory of the newborn Nila-Lohita 
(Ch. V.3). The overtones of desire, however, sounded first in the 
world of Brahma, when Kama strung his bow and made Brahma his 
victim. 
Prognostic memory as well as a reversal of time are effective in the 
relation of other events in which Ardhanarisvara and the linga are 
connected in the continuity of their myth. Thus, the Linga Purarla says 
that the goddess is the mother of the universe. Her name is Bhaga 
(womb). She is the altar of the god who has the form of the linga. The 
linga is the Lord. Together they created the universe. Siva in the form 
of the linga is the light that abides above the darkness (LP . 1 .gg.6-7). 
God and goddess, linga and yoni, are the cocreators of the universe. 
In this view, Siva's invisible presence does not inhere in the linga, 
which is Prakrti (Ch. VII.4). Prakrti here is the goddess as the dark 
womb and altar, from which rises the divine splendor. Bhaga is the 
sacrificial ground and the linga is Agni, the flame of fire. Having 
transferred prakrti from the linga to the yoni, the Linga Pura'(ta contin­
ues to say that from the union of linga and yoni [vedi] came Ardha­
narisvara. First, he created Brahma, his son, the four-faced Lord. Siva 
granted cosmic knowledge to Brahma, and Brahma asked Siva to di­
vide himself. From the left side of his body he created the Goddess as 
his wife (LP.1 .gg.8- 1 2). The reversed roles of Brahma and Siva as 
father and son are interwoven with the linga-yoni ensemble. This 
pregnant formula, according to the above context, required Siva to 
become Ardhanarisvara. Teleologically, the linga-yoni symbol pre­
vailed over the image of Ardhanarisvara, and Siva prevailed over 
Brahma as Brahma became the son of Siva. In another account from 
the same text, the Lord became the son of Brahma. He then became 
male and female Ardhanarisvara and, as the Lord, burned Brahma. 
Thereafter, for the purpose of the increase of the world, Ardha-

narisvara, by the path of yoga, enjoyed the female half of himself. In 
her he created Vil)u and Brahma (LP. 1 .4 1 .g- 1 2). Thus Brahma was 
egg-born, lotus-born, and born also from the body of the Lord 
(LP · 1 .41 . 1 3)· 
In this version, Ardhanarisvara as the son of Brahma divided him­
self into a male and a female. He enjoyed her who had been half of 
himself. This relation, though by way of yoga, was counter to the ar­
chetypal image of Ardhanarisvara with its axial male-female division 
of the body, precluding any sexual position of union. Nonetheless, 
Ardhanarisvara not only turned-by the path of yoga-into a progen­
itive couple but became the father of Vil)u and of Brahma. Before 
that, Ardhanarisvara Siva burned Brahma, whose son he was, so that 
Brahma could be born again from Siva. This was Brahma's third 
mode of birth; his other births were in the waters, where the cosmic 
egg floated, his original place of birth, and in the cosmic lotus flower, 
the ancient birthplace of the goddess Lakmi, the lotus-born (Pad­
maja). The death and birth of Brahma were due to the greatness of 
Siva, while the triple birth of Brahma was a synopsis of the several 
living traditions about the birth of the Creator. Moreover, not only 
Brahma but also Vil)u became Siva's son. 
In creation, on the level of the gods, a world full of anthropo­
morphic metaphor, the gods of the Purii't"as were prone to demon­
strate their superiority among each other. Siva manifesting out of the 
flame linga humbled Brahma and Vil)u in their aspects as demiurges. 
The relation, however, of Brahma and Siva, which is that of father 
and son, is complex, intimate, and reciprocal. Related to the reversi­
bility of origin is the flexibility of overlapping situations and concep­
tual levels. Time and space, as mythical dimensions, allow not only the 
same objects or symbols but also the same actions to be grouped in 
several ways. Thus, when, according to one account, ArdhanarlSvara 
had divided himself, Daka took the female half, gave her to Rudra, 
and asked him to perform creation. Rudra refused and asked 
Brahma to create and let him destroy. "I will become Sthal)u." Then 
Siva with Sati went to Kailasa (SkP.7.2.9.5-1 7). Siva, who as Ardha­
narisvara was to complete Brahma's creation, had recourse to his as­
cetic nature and resumed his position as Siva-Sthal)u; then Siva went 
to Kailasa with Sati, taking for granted and as part of himself his re­
solve to be Sthal)u, withdrawn into himself, the destroyer of all fet­
ters. Siva in his togetherness with Sati, Siva as Sthal)u, and Siva as

I .  ONE, FOUR, FIVE HEADS OF THE CREATOR 
Rudra had prepared the seed for the Father; Rudra shot the Father 
while he, the Lord of Generation, Prajapati, was spending his seed 
into creation. Creation is a destructive activity. It violates the integrity 
of the indefinable absolute, making manifest and disseminating its 
contents. 
Rudra, the avenger of the primordial act of the Father, was born in · 
another aeon from the seed of Prajapati. To assuage the memory of 
the primordial scene that troubled his newborn son, Prajapati in­
vested Rudra with the cosmos. 
In yet another aeon, Rudra was born from the head of Brahma. 
The Father, Prajapati, and Brahma are successive names of the Cre­
ator, per generationem. Rudra, who had prepared the seed for the 
Father, carried within himself the fire seed of life. Born as a mental 
son of Brahma and being Consciousness itself, the Great God and 
Lord of Yoga acted out fully his role as avenger. He severed his linga 
from his body. He cut off the head of Brahma. 
When Prajapati and his daughter consorted as antelopes, Prajapati 
was pierced by the arrow of Rudra; he bounded to the sky and be­
came the constellation Mrga, the antelope (AB.3.33; cf. SB . 1 .7.4. 1-3); 
or Prajapati, pierced by the arrow, abandoned his body, and became 
the constellation Mrgasiras (SB .2. 1 .2.g). Mrgasiras, the antelope's 
head, is the head of Prajapati (SB .2. 1 .2.8), though this constellation 
may also represent the abandoned body of Prajapati (SB .2. 1 .2.g). In 
the sky among the stars, Prajapati became established as Mrgasiras, 

O N E ,  FO U R, F I V E  H EA D S ' 2 5 1 
the head of the antelope, for the body of Prajapati, struck by the ar­
row, fell to the ground (SkP.3. 1.4o. 1 2). As Prajapati, pierced, aban­
doned his body (SB .2.1 .2.g), a great light arose from it, went to the 
sky, and became the star M:rgasiras (SkP.3. 1 .4o. 1 3). Mahadeva, that 
ocean and treasury of compassion (SkP. 3.1 .4o.26, 35), who had sev­
ered the head of the Creator of the world (SkP.3. 1 .40.30), revived 
Prajapati-Brahma and placed four heads on his body. They were 
those of Nandin, the leader of Siva's host, and of others of his gal).as. 
Having lost his one head and received four, four-headed Brahma 
praised Siva. Henceforward, according to this version of the myth, 
Brahma had four heads (SkP .3. 1.40.39-49). The head of the antelope 
had become a separate reality. To this day it looks down from the sky. 
Brahma, however, acquired his four heads in more than one way. 
The four heads of Brahma faced the four directions. The four di­
rections constitute the extent of the manifest world; the four orients 
refer to the movement of the sun. They indicate the cosmos under 
the rule of time. Four being the comprehensive number of the total 
manifestation, is also the number of revelation--completely made 
Word in the four Vedas. Brahma, the Creator, was fittingly given four 
heads. It did not matter on whose shoulders each had formerly sat; 
their number was all that mattered, for it showed the comprehensive­
ness of Brahma's being. 
Even so, this number of heads proved to be insufficient when 
Brahma had to cope with the appearance of a lovely girl, dark, slen­
der, and with beautiful eyes (cf. VmP, SM .28,4-5, 20). She appeared 
from one half of his body (Ch. VII I.3) as he invoked Savitri, the most 
sacred mantra, the essence of the Vedas, whose other name is Gayatri 
(MP·3.30-32). Savitri manifested in response to Brahma's dissatisfac­
tion with his creation of mind-born sons and as he was conceiving a 
new plan for the creation of living beings. She was one of Satariipa's 
hundred forms (MP.3.3 1). Brahma first thought she was his daugh­
ter, and he desired her. He could not take his eyes off Savitri, and did 
not want to turn his head. Instead, by his own will he grew four heads 
in the four directions in order to see her while she walked around 
him. Satariipa, embarrassed, moved heavenward (MP.3.32-40; cf. Ch. 
VIII.3). 
The self-acquired four heads of Brahma resulted from his lusting 
after his daughter. In them he set forth into the world in the four di-

2 5 2 
• B H A I RA V A  
rections his hitherto undivided self. The heads had sprouted from his 
desire for something no longer within himself. It was Gayatri, the 
goddess who had appeared from his own half. True to the ancient 
pattern, she was his daughter. Being his daughter she carried within 
her the knowledge of her celestial origin. 
Her ascension provoked the appearance of one more, the fifth, the 
quintessential head on top of the four. Brahma covered it with his 
long, matted hair. Its abundance showed his virile power; its uncared­
for tangled look gave him the appearance of a yogi. Nevertheless, due 
to his desire for congress with his daughter, Brahma lost all the power 
accumulated by his austerities (tapas) that he needed for the creation 
of the universe (MP'3.39-40)! 
Brahma's desire for his daughter was aroused by her beauty, but it 
was caused by Kama, who was born just then as Brahma's mental son 
(SP.2.2.2.23, 35-36). Kama was born to madden and delude people, 
and Jor this purpose Brahma gave him magic arrows. Kama immedi­
ately tested them and pierced Brahma. They had the desired effect. 
Seen in this amorous state by his other mind-born sons, the ascetics, 
Brahma was ashamed (MP.4. 1 1). He became angry with Kama and 
cursed him. The curse of the Creator meant death to Kama, and im­
plicated Siva in this fatality. Brahma cursed Kama that he would be 
reduced to ashes when he made Siva his target. Kama cried out in an­
guish that Brahma had created him to captivate the minds and arouse 
love in whomever his arrows hit, and that he had carried out 
Brahma's instruction. Then Brahma promised him that he would be­
come incarnate again. Kama, sad on account of the curse but relieved 
by its modification, departed (MP .4. 1 1-2 1). 
Brahma in his curse of Kama meant to avenge his own passion on 
Siva, exposing him to the same predicament that had befallen his own 
person. Primordially, when Prȳapati had become a victim of Rudra's

"You are King Soma, the far seeing, paiicamukho'si prajapatir," that is, the "five-faced

are the Brahmin, the King, the Hawk and the Fire. With these mouths he eats the kings, 
the people, the birds, the regions, and with the fifth mouth he eats all the beings. In 
KBUp.2. 10, I I ,  however, Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, and not King Soma is spo­
ken of. King Soma as Lord of Generation shades over into Prajapati, the Lord of Gen­
eration, the five heads a forecast of Brahma's five heads.

arrow, he made Rudra Lord of Animals, and Pasupati, the lord of 
creatures, spared the life of Prajapati. Now, however, Brahma had 
been victimized, not by Rudra but by Kama, desire, which had seized 
the Creator at the very beginning of creation. Though Brahma 
cursed Kama, the Creator revenged himself on Rudra / Siva. Like 
Brahma, Siva would become a victim of Kama and his victory would 
be the death of Kama and his resurrection. 
Exhausted by his curse of Kama and by his own shame, Brahma 
abandoned his body. His daughter, seeing her father dead, killed her­
self, but both were revived by Vil)u. Vil)u then gave her in marriage 
to Kama and named her Rati, the goddess Lust (BVP-4-35.38-73, 
101). Satarupa, of a hundred forms, Brahma's daughter, when she 
died in loyalty to her father, was called Sandhya, Twilight (SP.2.2.5.7-
10; 2.2.7. 1-5). Long ago, when creation began, she had been Uas, the 
first Dawn of a nascent cosmos. At that time Prajapati was pierced by 
the arrow of Rudra. Now he was a victim of Kama's arrow and he left 
his body in shame. According to the Brahmavaivarta Purcl1;a, Sandhya 
killed herself and became the goddess Lust, Rati, the wife of Kama 
(BVP-4-35.7 1-73, 101). But this was not her only fate. Her other fate 
was to become Arundhati, the embodiment of conjugal chastity 
(SP.2.2.5.8). Just as a god or goddess may be born more than once, 
each may have more than one fate and live it out in more than one 
shape. 
The number of Brahma's heads and the manner in which they 
came to be convey metaphysical and lesser problems. Together with 
the inherent significance of the numbers one, four, and five, the ex­
istence or acquisition of the respective number of heads and the loss 
of one of them-be it the first and only one or the fifth and last-form 
an intricate pattern. The light thrown on it by several versions of the 
myth moves around a central sensitive knot in which the identities of 
Siva and Brahma are tied up. The pattern of the threads, seen in this 
uncertain light, appears positive from one angle, negative from an­
other, but out of seeming contradictions the heads sit or·f all in the 
appointed place. 
Thus, it was Siva who gave Brahma his four heads in compensation 
for the one he had caused to be severed. Or Brahma himself sprouted 
all his five heads. Prajapati had been felled by Rudra-Siva, because he 
had emitted into creation some of the substance of the Uncreate. It 

2 54 
• B H A I RA VA 
fell into creation as its seed. Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, was 
lustful and incontinent. Rudra avenged the violation of the wholeness 
of the Uncreate. The incontinence of the progenitive act of Prajapati 
was his target. The head that had allowed it was severed and trans­
ferred up to the sky, to the stars. Siva, the Great God, full of compas­
sion, compensated the severance of the one and only head of the 
Head of the World by placing four heads on Brahma's shoulders. In 
renewed wholeness, Brahma's eyes now beheld the whole world and 
he carried the sum of all knowledge, the fourfold Veda, within him 
and held it in his hand in the shape of a book, as his images show. 
Thus Brahma, the Creator, got four heads. He got them by the grace 
of Siva. 
Others, however, know that Brahma the lotus-born (BhP ,3.8. 16), 
Brahma the egg-born (PP .S. 14.88; MP.2'3S-36), had four heads from 
the beginning (BhP.3.8. 1 6). The myth of Brahma, the Creator, be­
longs to an aeon long after the one head of Prȳapati, the Lord of 
Generation, had found its place in the sky. On the other hand, 
Brahma got himself his five heads. One by one, they appeared on his 
neck for the same reason for which Prajapati's one and only head had 
been severed from his body. The intercourse of Prajapati with his 
daughter and the desire of Brahma for his daughter are symbols 
through which was acted out the primordial violation of the Uncreate 
by the Creator. 
Uas, first Dawn of the world, haying been the partner in the trau­
matic, primeval scene, marked the transition into creation. Though in 
union with the Father, she had not been the target of Rudra's arrow. 
As Sandhya, Twilight, a kind glance from Siva's eye freed her from 
all shortcomings and, delighted with her asceticism, Siva told Sandhya 
that she had become pure (SP.2.2.3.S9; 2.2.6.30-40). 
Sandhya was reborn from the sweat of Daka as Rati, Lust, his 
daughter (SP.2.2.3.5 1-S9); or she entered the sacrificial fire, where, at 
the end of the sacrifice, sage Medhatithi found her as his daughter in 
the sacrificial pit (SP.2.2.7. 1-S, 14). Uas, cosmic Dawn, in mythical 
transformation, descended to being Sandhya, the twilight of each rit­
ual day and, after her voluntary death, was reborn as lust or as con­
jugal fidelity, the one considered to be the opposite of the other. 
Brahma did not retain his fifth head for long. It had arisen above 
the four heads as Brahma sought not to lose sight of his daughter in 

O N E ,  F O U R ,  F I VE H E A D S ' 2 5 5  
her flight from this earth. The fifth head looked heavenward. It dif­
fered from the other four heads by its position, above their level. 
In this respect, the fifth head of Brahma resembled Isana, the head 
of Siva. Siva, being Mantramiirti, necessarily had five heads. His man­
tra, Namal,t Sivaya, is of five syllables; his fivefold evocation in the Tait­
tiriya Aratlyaka and its form as the linga of five faces showed the pentad 
to be Siva's comprehensive numerical symbol. Of the five faces of 
Siva, that of Isana, the Lord, towered above the others; it represented 
a higher plane in the total reality of the god. 
Brahma had four heads and the fifth was supernumerary, exces­
sive, the outgrowth of Brahma's surpassing desire for his daughter, 
who took flight heavenward. Uas had run away from the Father,post 
factum, to the south, the region of perdition. It is also said that 
Brahma grabbed his daughter in order to cohabit with her. Before 
she vanished she told Brahma that five faces were not becoming to 
him; four faces, full of Veda, would be proper (BhvP.3.4. 1 3. 1 -S). 
With his five heads, Brahma numerically rivaled Siva, whose five­
fold being was conveyed from ancient times by his five mantras. The 
exalted position of the fifth head of Siva had a pejorative counterpart 
in Brahma's fifth head. Position and number of the heads of the two 
gods were deceptively similar, but Brahma's fifth head negated all 
that Siva's fifth head meant. The elevated position of Brahma's fifth 
head singled it out for an assault by Siva. It was a reenactment of 
Rudra's primeval onslaught on the Father. The target, however, was 
not in the region of sex. It had moved up to the head. The attack did 
not come from a Wild Hunter, his name unuttered because of fear. 
The attack came from Siva, born from Brahma's head. Brahma as 
father of mind-born sons seems to have had not more than one head, 
the birth-giving head. 
Brahma, it would appear, enjoyed the manner in which he had ac­
quired his five heads, that is, by looking at the beauty of his daughter 
while she reverentially circumambulated him, for, on another occa­
sion, he created the celestial maiden Tilottama, of unrivaled beauty. 
As her name im plies, she was made of the min utest particles of jewels. 
Tilottama walked around the assembly of the gods. When she came 
near Siva and was at his side, another face of Siva appeared. When 
she was behind him another face of the god appeared, and as she 
walked on, a fourth face. Siva manifested his sovereignty of the uni-

2 5 6  • B H A I RA V A  
verse with the face looking toward the east. With the face turned to 
the north he sported with the Great Goddess. With the face toward 
the west he showed himself as the ordainer of the happiness of crea­
tures, and with the southern face he showed himself as their destroyer 
(MBh. 1 3. 1 28. 1-6). He revealed himself to Tilottama, the lovely tempt­
ress, as the Five Brahmans, though she could not see his fifth, invisible 
face. 
The archetype of all the many heads, eyes, and limbs of the Great 
God is Supernal Man, the Purua, in whose likeness Rudra was born. 
The numbers, a hundred or a thousand, hint at the innumerable, 
whereas any number smaller than ten is not a cypher but a symbol, 
the number four standing primarily for the directions of space, the 
number five, in this context, being the quintessential number of the 
center raised above the four other heads. In Brahma's case, the fifth, 
supererogatory head was evil; in the episode of Tilottama, Brahma 
created a situation similar to that in which he had found himself when 
Savitri' appeared before him. In the assembly of the "gods, Brahma 
seemed to mean to ensnare Siva in a situation parallel to the one that 
had produced his own fifth head, but Siva put out only four heads. 
Brahma thought of humbling Siva by inducing him toward the pro­
duction of several, but he had not exceeded four visible heads, 
whereas Brahma had achieved five heads in his amorous pursuit. 
Brahma retaliated for having been in a position where he compul­
sively copied the pentad of Siva's head by bringing about a similar sit­
uation; but Siva did not produce more than four heads-the number, 
as Savitr!, his daughter, had said, that was becoming to Brahma. 
Brahma's fifth head, an outgrowth of uncontrolled desire, seen 
against the fifth, invisible head of Siva, that of isana,dwelling in tran­
scendency, amounted to a sacrilege. 
According to another point of view, the five heads were given to 
Brahma long ago by Siva as a special sign (SP . 1 .8.7), in a rite, as it 
were, of initiation to invest Brahma with the power to create. Siva with 
five faces spoke the five syllables-Namaါ Sivaya-with his five mouths 
to Brahma. Brahma grasped them with his five faces or mouths 
(LP . 1 .85. 13-14). 
In a complete reversal of positions, the five heads of Siva are said to 
have appeared during an argument between Siva and Brahma. Siva 
stared at Brahma's fifth face when five-faced Brahma emerged from 

O N E ,  FO U R ,  F I V E  H E A D S ' 2 5 7 
the cosmic ocean. After an angry exchange between the two gods, the 
five faces of Siva manifested (VmP.2.23-34; d. Ch. IX n. I ). 
The reciprocal relation of Siva's and Brahma's five heads is even 
more involved, but also resolved in other myths. When Brahma was 
unable to create and asked Siva to be his son, Siva said he would cut 
off Brahma's head. Siva was born from Brahma's head, from the 
mouth breath, or forehead of Brahma. Brahma, having created five­
headed Siva, became overweening; his fifth head generated heated 
energy, it shone brighter than the sun, it outshone the splendor of the 
gods and incapacitated them. Siva cut off the fifth head and kept it in 
his hand to prevent it from burning the earth and drying up the 
ocean (BrP. 1 1 3.1-18; cf. SkP.5. 1 .2.7-26; d. PP.5.14.92-1 15).2 The 
severed head of Brahma, held in Siva's hand, was to cling to it. The 
head became a skull and served Siva as his begging bowl (cf. Ch. 
IX.2). Or Brahmasiras, the head of Brahma, retained its formidable 
energy and became the Pasupata weapon, which Siva gave to Arjuna, 
the pal).Qava hero and son of Indra (MBh'3'41 .7-8, 13).3 
Arjuna had subjected himself to ascetic austerities when, to obtain 
a sight of Siva, he went into the Himalayan wilderness (MBh.3.39. 10-
12). There the pal).Qava hero encountered a wild hunter, a Kirata, of 
powerful build. At that moment a boar was about to attack Arjuna. 
Though the boar was struck down simultaneously by the arrows of 
Arjuna and of the Kirata, Arjuna and the Kirata began to fight as to 
who had first aimed at the boar. The Kirata proved to be invulnerable 
and got hold of Arjuna's bow Gal).Qiva (MBh·3·4o. 1-25, 39). 
Pleased with Arjuna's courage in battle, Siva revealed himself to 
Arjuna. Arjuna prostrated himself before Siva, the Wild Hunter. 
Smilingly, Siva, holding Arjuna's hands, pardoned him (MBh.3.40.52-
61). Siva granted his request for the Brahmasiras weapon. Thus, Siva 
gave to Arjuna the Pasupata weapon, which can be hurled by the 
mind, by the eye, by words, and by the bow (MBh'3.4 1 . 13-16). The 
Kirata also returned the Gal).Qiva bow to Arjuna (MBh.3.41.25). 
Brahmasiras, "the head of Brahma" had become a most powerful 
weapon, the Pasupata weapon, which was no other than the Pasupata

Vrata (cf. AUp.67), the vow by which alone kaivalya, liberation from 
the fetters of existence, can be obtained (commentary on AUp.67). 
Rudra / Siva, the Wild Hunter from the beginning of things, whom 
Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, had made Pasupati, Lord of Ani­
mals, lord of creatures, took the shape of a Kirata. As a Kirata, a tribal 
huntsman without caste, he imparted to Arjuna, the warrior, the in­
fallible weapon of the Pasupata vow by his gift of the Brahmasiras, the 
magical power inherent in Brahma's severed head. 
Siva, the Wild Hunter, the Kirata, had a following of women, thou­
sands of Kirata women (MBh.3.4o. 1 7). In another shape, that of Bhi­
katana, the Supreme Beggar, Siva had enlightened the sages in their 
forest hermitage. There, the women of the p;;is followed him, en­
tranced by the mysterious beggar. 
The bacchantic women who followed Bhikatana / Bhairava and 
the Kirata amazons were groups of enthusiasts, ecstatics, and jungle 
dwellers who recognized Lord Siva; they were drawn to him, followed 
and praised him, even though their men, the sages in the Deodar for­
est, were averse to him. 
In another hermitage, the wife of sage Atri, for example, unwilling 
to live in subjection to her husband, left him and sought the protec­
tion of Lord Siva, subjecting herself to great austentIes 
(MBh. 1 3. 14.65-66). Yet another woman, the mother of Upamanyu, 
blessed with the knowledge of Siva, lived as an ascetic in the wilder­
ness. Once her son asked her to cook some dish with milk, for he had 
tasted milk on his visit to another hermitage. She had none to cook, 
for, living in the woods, roots and fruits were her only food, and as­
ceticism together with the recitation of sacred mantras were the daily 
practices of the recluses. Having no sweet milk to give to her son, the 
mother of Ri Upamanyu told him about Siva, the giver of everything 
(MBh. 13. 1 4.75-84). The mother of Upamanyu praised Mahadeva, the 
Great God who is incomprehensible to ordinary, unenlightened man, 
though he resides in the hearts of all creatures. Many are the forms 
of his grace (MBh. 13, app. 1, no. 4, lines 1 1-18). 
The laud of Mahadeva by the mother of Upamanyu was imbued 
with the knowledge and fervor of the Satarudriya hymn. She added to 
the "hundred" forms of Rudra, hailed in that paean, those of the Ki­
rata and the Sabara, representatives of the wild tribes of the jungle; 
she added the shapes of tortoise, fish, conch, and snake; the demonic 
and ghoulish form of Preta, Pisaca, Rakasa; of lizard, leopard, crow, 

SE V E R E D  H E AD ' 2 59 
and peacock, of many other beasts, birds, and of every man. She saw 
the Great God girt with snakes; his earrings, girdle, and sacred thread 
made of snakes. She saw him wearing an elephant skin but also per­
fectly naked, fair complexioned, dark complexioned, pale, ruddy, 
white with ashes smeared all over his body, and the crescent moon 
shining from his forehead. She saw him dance and wander over cre­
mation grounds, and she saw him sport with the daughters and wives 
of the nis. She heard him sing and play on many instruments; she 
heard him laugh, cry, and make others cry, or he appeared to her like 
a madman. She knew him as the very breath of life, its principle 
(jiva); she knew him as the conscious mind and its transcendence, 
yoga itself, Mahesvara, the Great Lord, the destroyer of all creatures 
and on whom all creatures rest (MBh. 13, app. 1 ,  no. 4, lines 27-77). 
The mother of Upamanyu, unable to give her son the milk that 
nourished other P;lis living closer to village and pasture than her re­
treat in the mountain forest, saw the Wild God as a Kirata. As a Ki­
rata, a wild hunter, the Great God gave to Arjuna his missile, the 
Brahmasiras, the "Head of Brahma," that is, the Pasupata weapon or 
Pasupata vow. It was a powerful weapon. Its magic worked in many 
ways, for it could be aimed by the mind, by the eye, by words, and by 
the bow. But before the Brahmasiras weapon, the head of Brahma, 
could become effective, Siva had to sever the head of Brahma, his 
fifth head. In the myth of the Kiriita, Arjuna received the Brahma­
siras weapon from the hand of Siva. In the myth of Bhairava, the 
head of Brahma clung to the hand of Siva. It became a skull (kapiila), 
the begging bowl of Siva as Bhika˷ana. 
2. THE SEVERED HEAD: THE CAUSE OF ITs FALL 
The fifth head of Brahma had to fall, for more than one reason. The 
Skiinda Purii1Ja remembers the one fundamental, primordial cause. It 
says that formerly, in the very beginning of the Krta Yuga, the golden 
age, Brahma was enamored of his youthful daughter and was about 
to cohabit with her. Seeing this, Siva cut off with a sword the fifth 
head of Brahma (SkP.2 .3.2 .3-4; cf. 3. 1 .40.5-1 6). The primal scene, at 
the beginning of days, is staged here in the costume of a later age, 
when the figure of the Father Prajapati had acquired the features of 
Brahma, including the fifth head, the physiognomical projection sky­
ward of his lust that had gone to his head. Rudra, in this setting, did 

260 • B H A I RA V A 
not direct his arrow toward the sex of Prajapati. Instead, he wielded 
a sword by which he cut off the obnoxious head.4 But for the change 
in costume and iconography, the primordial scene has remained in­
tact. 
According to other accounts, the site of the decapitation of Brahma 
was not the stark vastness of a nascent world but the sublime peak of 
Mount Meru, the cosmic mountain (KiiP.2.31 .3). There, the great 
sages asked Brahma which god was the imperishable, supreme reality. 
Deluded by Siva's maya, Brahma declared himself as the supreme 
reality (KiiP.2.31 .4-6). ViI:1u made the same claim for himself 
(KiiP.2.31 .8-1O). The Vedas declared Siva to be the ultimate reality in 
whom all beings reside, the highest reality that the yogis know, the 
Great Lord who makes the wheel of existence revolve, Sankara, the 
bringer of peace, Mahadeva, the Great God, Purua, the primal 
being, Rudra (KiiP.2.3 1 . 1 3- 1 6). Hearing these words, Brahma in his 
delusion laughed and asked: "How is it that the Supreme Spirit, the 
Brahman, free of all attachment, lustily sports with his wife and the 
very haughty Pramathas, the churn-spirits?" (KiiP.2.3 1 . 1 7- 1 8; cf. 
SP .3.8.31-32; SkP .3. 1.24. 16). 
Brahma, in this contest of supremacy, assumed an aggressive stance 
against Siva, who was not present in the assembly of the gods and 
sages on the peak of Mount Meru. It was under the spell of the maya 
of Lord Siva that the two demiurges acted as they did. Brahma in­
veighed against Siva for the same reason that-in the opinion of some 
of the gods-Rudra had attacked Prajapati in the primordial scene. 
The intercourse of Prajapati and his daughter, however, had been a 
signal only that the wholeness of the absolute was being ruptured by 
the flow of its substance into creation. Subsequently, the meaning of 
the symbol sank into, and was submerged in, its sexual impact. It rose 
to Brahma's uneasy and deluded mind when he attacked Siva, the 
Great Yogi, apparently in the thrall oflust and thus disqualified from 
being supreme reality, free from all attachment. 
The final word in the assembly of gods and sages was spoken by a 
formless one that had taken on a form, the sound AUM, the primor­
dial sound, the pralJava, the source of all mantras (KiiP.2.3 1 . 19). Pra­
lJava said, "Never does the Great Lord Rudra-Siva take delight in any 
wife who would be separate from his own self. The glorious Lord is 
4 W. D. O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology, p. 284, on the removal of 
the "in auspicious first head."

self-luminous, eternal. His delight in himself is called Devi, the god­
dess. Siva is not outside Siva" (KUP.2.31 .20-2 1 ;  cf. SP.3.8'34-35; cf. 
SkP.3. 1 .24. 1 8- 1 9). He is that ascetic who, by his very nature, is "always 
in close union with the goddess" (KUP.2'3 1 .47).5 
Prajapati had cohabited with his daughter. She was his self-begot­
ten duality. Siva held within him the goddess, his state of bliss. In this 
way he was one with her, in self-contained fulfillment of deity. Its in­
candescence dissolved their lineaments. The alternative of the Lord 
and the goddess within him had manifested as Ardhanarisvara, the 
right and left, male and female in equal parts within the Lord. 
PratJava, pure sound, ethereal vibration in which the cosmos chants 
itself, if it reached Brahma's ear, failed to convey its message to him, 
deluded as he was by Siva's inscrutable maya (KUP.2' 3 1 .22). At this.im­
passe a celestial light irradiated the firmament, a shining orb 
(KUP.2.3 1 .23-24; SkP.3. 1 .24.28-30), or a mass of flames from heaven 
to earth (SP .3.8.37), or was it Purua, carrying a trident? The crescent 
moon was his head ornament, a third eye shone in his forehead, and 
he was wreathed in serpents (SP'3.8'37-41 ). Brahma's fifth head 
looked up and burned with rage, and he saw Nila-Lohita 
(KUP.2'31 .26). The fifth head of Brahma burned with anger 
(SP .3.8.39). Having created this fifth head, Brahma spoke to the Su­
preme Lord: "0 Great God, I know you. In the past you sprang from 
my forehead. You were my son named Rudra. Come to me. I will pro­
tect you" 
(KUP.2'31 .28; 
SP.3.8.42-43; 
SkP.3. 1 .24.3 1-34; cf. 
MP. 1 83.84-86). As Mahesvara, the Lord, heard these arrogant words, 
he sent forth Kalabhairava (KuP .2.31 .29; SkP .3. 1 .24.35) of dread ap­
pearance, Kalaraja, the lord of time of whom even time is afraid. 
There are no words for the fearfulness of Bhairava, for his terror. 
Bhairava is the complete form of Siva. Fools, deluded by Siva's maya, 
do not know him (SP'3.8.2). Bhairava, the Kalapurua, Time who 
controls time, who controls everything (KUP.2'31 .29, 45), cut off that 
head with the nail of his left thumb (VrP .97.6-7), or with the tips of 
the nails of the fingers of his left hand (SP .3.8.52), or simply cut it off 
after a great battle (KUP.2'31 .30)' 
The severed head became attached to Rudra's hand (VrP.97.7). Its 
skull did not leave the palm of Bhairava's left hand. 
Bhairava is Siva at his most fearful. He is Siva entire, whether spo-

ken of as emanated from Siva, or, seen on the highest level of Siva, as 
Mahadeva Kalabhairava, the Great God Kalabhairava. It was the 
same left hand that severed the head and to which clung the skull of 
Brahma. According to the Kurma PuriirJa, Siva acted out his being, 
facing himself in multiple unity. Mahadeva, the Great God, enjoined 
Nila-Lohita, who stood in front of him, to carry the skull as his beg­
ging bowl, and collect alms for the expiation of the sin that he had 
committed. The Great Lord said to Kalagni, who is Time, the devour­
ing Fire, and who became Bhairava, "Roam constantly begging alms." 
Mahadeva Kalabhairava of dark countenance and beauty then wan­
dered through the world (KUP.2'3 1 .61-73). Much as he wanted to be 
freed from it, the skull remained in his hand while he expiated his sin 
(SP·3·8.61-62). 
The unnamed god whose arrow struck the Father in his organ of 
sex and Siva-Bhairava, who cut off Brahma's fifth head, are one in 
essence. 
Brahma's fifth head taunted Lord Siva manifesting in glory; it be­
littled the Great God for having been born as Brahma's son and of­
fered paternal protection to Mahadeva. Siva, however, had antici­
pated the animadversion of Brahma. At the time when Brahma had 
desired Siva to be born as his son so that Brahma could create living 
beings, Siva had assured Brahma that he would cut off the overbear­
ing fifth head of Brahma (SkP .5. 1.2.20-2 1). 
The fifth head of Brahma was that of a horse (BhvP. 1 .22. 1 3-16). 
The horse's head is known to crown ViI)u: he is called Hayamukha, 
"horse-faced one" (MBh. 1 .20, note 10, 299, line 2), but a similar form, 
Hayagriva, is the name of a demon killed by ViI)u (MBh.S. 1 28.49). 
The ambiguity of the horse's head stems from the sun, vivifying and 
also scorching, of which the horse is a symbol. Thus, also, the horse's 
head holds and gives away secret knowledge (RV. I .  1 16. 1 2 ;  1 . 1 1 7.22; 
1 . 1 1 9.9).6 The fifth head of Brahma recited indiscretely, though 
prognostically, the Atharvar:ta mantra, " '0 Kapalin,' 'Skull-bearer,' 0 
Rudra, . . .  protect the world . . .  " as Rudra,just born, sat on the shoul­
der of his father (VrP.97'3-S)' 
The fifth head of Brahma, self-acquired by his lust or arrogance, 
had to fall because of its foreknowledge and indiscretion in having in-
6 A. A. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 14 1 ,  on the cut-off head and the horse's head; 
cf. S. Kramrisch, "The Mahavira Vessel and the Plant Putika," 1 975, pp. 224-26. 

S E  V E R E D  H E A D · 26 3 
voked and provoked the newborn god as Kapalin, a title he was to 
earn once he had cut off Brahma's head, and the head had turned 
into a skull clinging to his hand as he went begging with this bowl that 
had held Brahma's most compelling drive and ambition. Hearing the 
words of the mantra, "0 Skull-bearer, 0 Rudra . . .  ," from Brahma's 
mouth, Rudra Ni]a-Lohita, Bhairava, cut off the fifth head of Brahma 
with the nail of his left thumb (VrP ,97,5-7). 
Misgivings based on their father-son relationship prompted 
Brahma's fifth head to a fatal indiscretion. If the fifth head gave away 
its foreknowledge in order to infuriate Siva, it did do worse when, ac­
cording to another version of the myth, it lied. This took place on the 
battlefield when Brahma and ViQ.u fought, not with words but with 
their weapons, so as to prove by the victor's sovereignty, his ultimate 
reality. Siva, seeing that the flaming weapons of the fighting demi­
urges were about to burn the world, appeared on the battlefield as a 
huge column of fire. The gods, wondering what this blazing pillar 
was, attempted to fathom its extent, as they had done when the flam­
ing pillar arose from the flood of a cosmic night. They failed to reach 
either bottom or top, but Brahma, on his return from on high, where 
he had flown in the shape of a wild gander, lied to ViQ.u that he had 
seen the top of the pillar. What he had seen was a Ketaki flower that 
had floated down from high above when Siva's head had shaken with 
laughter on seeing the fight of Brahma and ViQ.u. But when ViQ.u 
bowed to Brahma, believing that Brahma had seen the top of the 
flaming pillar, Siva manifested to punish Brahma (SP.1.7.4-29). He 
created Bhairava from the middle of his forehead to chastise Brahma 
(SP. 1 .8. 1 ). In this myth, Mahadeva, the Great God, bid Bhairava to 
worship Brahma with his sharp, quick sword. Bhairava caught hold 
of the hair of Brahma's fifth head, which was arrogant and had lied; 
he raised his sword to strike (SP . 1 .8,3-4), and cut off Brahma's fifth 
head (SP'3.8'52). The radical punishment of Brahma on ethical 
grounds, because the Creator had lied, though it was meted out in a 
cosmic setting, obfuscated the metaphysical significance of Siva's par­
ricide of Brahma, the Creator. To strengthen the argument on ethical 
grounds, not only did Brahma himself lie, but he also made the Ke­
taki flower give false evidence by saying that it was the witness to the 
truth of Brahma's assertion that he had seen the top of the linga 
(SP . 1 .7.24-25). In another version of the myth, Brahma resolved to 

2 6 4 ' B H A I RA V A  
say that he had seen the end. He sprouted a fifth head in the form of 
a she-ass, to speak the lie that his other four faces could not 
(BrP. 1 35· 1 -2 1 ). 
The lie of Brahma was a more ethically justifiable reason for his be­
heading than was the self-glory of the fifth head that, according to yet 
another version, made it outshine the radiance of all the other gods. 
For this overweaning brightness of the fifth head, Rudra, according 
to the Padma Purrl1;a, cut off the head with the nail of his left thumb 
(PP. 5. 1 4. 1 1 2- 1 3). The Skiinda Puriir;a amplifies this account. The 
fifth head of Brahma, elated with pride, produced such fiery heat (te­
jas) that it destroyed the fire of gods and demons. They sought refuge 
with Siva who, on their behalf, went to Brahma. Brahma-now over­
whelmed by darkness--did not recognize Siva, who laughed aloud. 
Brahma, stupefied by Siva's laughter and confused by his tejas, lost his 
head to the nail of Siva's left thumb. Brahma was so confused by the 
hot intensity (tejas) of Rudra that he did not know that his head had 
stuck to Rudra's hand. Stuck with the skull, Siva danced (SkP .5. 1.2.33-
69)· 
So shattering was the truth of Siva beheading the Creator that it 
had to be embellished, and was told on levels easier of access than that 
ofthe primordial scene. In one such story the two essential motifs, the 
desire of the Creator for his daughter and the severing of his head by 
Siva, are linked causally. Sarasvati was furious when Brahma made 
amorous insinuations, and she cursed the mouth that had spoken in­
appropriately. In the future, Brahma's fifth head would always speak 
objectionably and bray like a donkey. Then, one day, Siva and Parvati 
came to see Brahma. While the four heads of Brahma welcomed Siva 
worshipfully, the fifth mouth made some disagreeable sound. Siva, 
annoyed with the evil fifth head, cut it off. It remained stuck to his 
hand during his wanderings all over the earth, though Siva could 
have burned it (SP,JS .49.65-80). 
The skull of the fifth, quintessential head of Brahma, in which his 
lust and pride had reached their peak, had to fall. Siva felled the head 
of Brahma with the same inevitability that had directed the arrow of 
Rudra against the Father, Prajapati. Brahma's verbal provocation by 
overstating his paternal status, the rasping sound of his voice, and the 
telling of a lie at a crucial moment were but expressions of irritation 
that stemmed from a deep-seated cause. 
The head of Brahma had to fall. It was severed by Siva, who for this 

K A L A  A N D  M A H A K A LA • 26 5 
purpose sent forth from himself Bhairava, his own other form 
(SP .3.8.60). Bhairava is the total, complete Siva (SP.3.8.2). The nail of 
his left thumb sufficed for nipping off Brahma's head (SP.3.8.52; 
SkP.5. 1 .2.65; MP. 183.86). Bhairava looked so fierce that even Kala, 
who is Time and Death, was afraid of him; hence he is Kalabhairava. 
Bhairava also was Kalaraja, lord of time and death. Terror emanated 
from Bhairava (SP.3.8.46-47). Tormented by fear, those who beheld 
him saw in him the source of their own fear. In the fulness of their 
fear they saw the embodiment of fear. Thus, his name describes the 
effect that he created in the frightened eyes of the beholder, dilated 
by fear, as those of the god were dilated by devastating fury. The 
word Bhairava is derived from bhzru, which means timid, fearful, in 
the sense of feeling fear. 7 Bhairava is an appellation by inversion, 
placing effect into cause. While the name of Rudra, unspeakable in its 
horror, was not to be pronounced, Bhairava's name did not denote 
the identity of the god, but intensified his frightfulness by communi­
cating the effect of his frightfulness. 
Bhairava in particular is Siva, as Sarva was Rudra. The fierce 
hunter had changed his shape and mode of attack. He allowed no dis­
tance between himself and his victim. Their contact was close, one 
sharp touch by the hand of the god was final, neither time nor space 
intervened. 
Siva become Kapalin. The skull of Brahma stuck to Bhairava's 
hand. The sin ofbrahminicide did not leave him. Like any murderer 
of a brahmin, Siva / Bhairava had to expiate this greatest of all sins, 
though he was God. By making himself a sinner he became "the di­
vine archetype of the Kapalika ascetic."8 The Kapalika "symbolizes 
the perfected yogin precisely because on a mundane level he is the 
most debased of ascetics."9 It was not for the first time that Rudra / 
Siva abased himself (Ch. III.2.b). 
3. TIME, DEATH, AND TIMELESSNESS: KALA AND MAHAKALA 
Time was deeply entrenched in the myth of Siva. In the primordial 
scene, as an invisible actor, time had played a decisive and ambiguous 
role. It placed itself between the intent of Rudra and the actuality of

his shot. The actor was not only invisible but also had no name. We 
call him Time. Had Rudra's arrow hit its target as soon as the Wild 
Archer saw the mating couple, no seed would have been spilled, and 
no substance would have flowed from the Uncreate into creation. By 
intervening at the moment of Rudra's intent to halt the couple, at the 
moment when Rudra acted out his role as the guardian of the abso­
lute and avenger of its infringement, Time entered the scene. Time 
had come into existence with the first movement of Rudra. Even be­
fore that, in the spontaneity of his being, Rudra was the carrier of the 
seed for the Father, in the limbo between the Uncreate and the crea­
tion of life. While Time obstructed the intent of Rudra and frustrated 
the immediate purpose of the attack on the Father by the Wild God, 
he was only seemingly Rudra's antagonist. His intervention was di­
rected against Rudra, the avenger, and, at the same instant, under­
takenfor Rudra, the bearer of the seed. 
Time reenacted the simultaneity of its twofold role on another oc­
casion. Time intervened between Rudra's plunge into the water and 
his emergence from yogic absorption w hen under water. While 
Rudra had tarried, apparently to ready himself for the work of crea­
tion / procreation, Daka was at hand and accomplished the task for 
the Creator with which Rudra had originally been charged. In both 
scenes, the one at the dawn of creation, the other on the banks of and 
in the water of Rudra's immersion, Time, the invisible, acted with 
Rudra, while giving the appearance of defeating Rudra's immediate 
purpose. 
In creation, Rudra, the Wild God, the fierce archer, threatened the 
life of man. His arrows brought death; they cut off man from life, as 
a gourd is cut off from its stalk (RV.7.S9. 1 2), before it can ripen, be­
fore its time. The duration of life (ayus), the lived dimension of time, 
was in Rudra's hand. Time, the actor, invisibly present at the begin­
ning of creation, insinuated itself into the life that Rudra had helped 
to bring about, so that it should ripen in the fullness of time, but 
Rudra had the power over life and time. He could shorten their span, 
The Wild God ruled over lived time (ayus). 
Once, Rudra met Kala, god Time (Ch. VII.6), and recognized him­
self in him, looking out from his eyes, although Time had only four 
faces and lacked the fifth face of Siva that is beyond time. But for this 
difference, god Kala and Siva could be mistaken for one another. The 
,. 
, -
,. 
fifth face of Siva, the Lord, Isana, is beyond time. Thus, Siva is Time, 

KA L A  A N D  M A H A K AL A  • 26 7 
Kala, and he is beyond Time, Mahakala. Inasmuch as he is Time, he 
has coalesced with time, his original antagonist, who from the begin­
ning was within his ambience. 
Time had invisibly entered the myth of Rudra at the beginning and 
presented his credentials to the archer. They were the present, past, 
and future set by him along his arrow, the arrow of unilineal time. In 
creation Rudra directed his own arrow toward living creatures. I f not 
averted, it would cut short the duration of the life of animate beings. 
Their lifetime would be shortened; Kala, Time, would stop their last 
breath and the beating of their heart. 
God Kala is Time, the Ender (antaka). He is Death to the living 
being and it is he who also ends the cosmos. He is the Destroyer of 
existence; he is the inalienable counterpart of life. He is Rudra, the 
Great God whose form as Kala carries the fact of death. The misery 
of dying was entrusted to the dark and beautiful young goddess 
Death (Ch. VI.2). She had come out from all the pores of Brahma, 
the Creator, who was intent on making a holocaust of his unmanage­
ably proliferating, deathless creation. With tears in her eyes, she im­
plored the Creator to let her desist from her appointed task. But this 
he would not grant to her. For all her tears and most severe austerities 
over millions of years, the young goddess had to acquiesce. She ac­
cepted the immutable fact of death. She accepted herself when cycli­
cal time had come to be at the intervention of Siva as SthaQu 
(MBh. 1 2.248-50). 
Kala, the Ender, is a form of Sarva, the archer. From without he 
approaches the beings and terminates their vital energies (priifUl). 
But, inasmuch as Rudra is himself the vital breath ( priifUl), even as he 
had been the carrier of the vital seed, it is he who from within, as 
much as from without, constitutes the life span, the lived time of mor­
tals. Within the living organism time moves rhythmically. Breathing, 
pulsating, alternating like day and night, the vital breath is the micro­
cosmic homology to cosmic time. The dance of Siva begins within the 
inner rhythm of living beings and thence embraces the cosmos. Its 
ာtage is set in many places, in the heart of man, in the heights where 
Siva is at home in Himalayan groves, in temples, or wherever a site is 
favorable, and also at the end of the world, before it is swallowed in 
the abyss of the cosmic flood. 
Unilineal time, the time of the arrow and the archer, and the vi­
brant, palpitating rhythm within living beings are both Rudra's time, 

268 ' B H A I R A V A  
as the Vedas know it and the Brahmarws. Rudra, however, the Wild 
Archer, is also the lord of yogis and he is SthaI;lu, who discharged 
from his being the tumultuous Rudras (Ch. V 1 . 1 ). In the silence of his 
mind and body, time stood still. But when Brahma, the Creator, was 
at a loss in his work of creating living beings, for their life went on and 
on because there was no stop to it (death as yet had not been created 
and the lifetime of his creatures stretched endlessly), SthaI:lU, compas­
sionate and merciful, appeared on the scene of Brahma's intended 
holocaust. He summoned triple time-past, present, and future-and 
requested Brahma to instill into its flux the quiescence of his own 
being. Thus, periods of ongoing activity would alternate with periods 
of withdrawal, the business of living would subside and out of its 
pause life would begin again. In aeviternal rhythms the current of 
time would be channeled in the cosmos, reflecting not only the pul­
sation of life within the microcosm, but with it also the possibility of 
realization, in samadhi, of timelessness. Projected outward into the 
flux of time, pra'(l,a (the inner movement of life within the living 
being), and the state of withdrawal (holding the promise of at-one­
ment within its stilled mind and body), these two (the vital breath and 
yogic stasis) would coalesce in a new order of time, carrying the assur­
ance of an aeviternal return. 
Straight, arrow-like time and the time of aeviternal return are Siva's 
modalities of time within creation. By Sthal:\u's intervention Brahma 
gave effect to the latter. 
Before the arrival of SthaI;lu on the scene of the holocaust, Brahma 
had lost his hold on time, for which, as Prajapati, he had been the par­
adigm. The myth and rites of Prajapati in his relation to time were 
recorded in the Satapatha Brahma'(l,a. The human being as the sacri­
ficer was implicated in the renewal of time by building up the fire al­
tar, the terrestrial homology of the cycle of the year and of Prajapati. 
By his participation in the piling up of the fire altar, by rites of archi­
tecture, the sacrificer recreated the body of Prajapati, who had fallen 
down in sheer exhaustion after having spent himself into creation. By 
architectural rites, man participated in the reconstruction of Prajapati 
and, at the same time, effected his own regeneration. 
Prajapati created all living creatures, whereas Brahma, injected 
with Rudra's asceticism, produced only mental progeny. "Having cre­
ated all existing things, he [Pr<tiapati] felt like one emptied out, and 

KA L A  A N D  M A H A K A L A  • 26 9 
was afraid of death" (SB. 1 O.4.2.2; 3.9. 1 . 1 ;  TB. 1 .2.6. 1). 10 Creating, 
Pr,yapati had dispersed himself into the manifold universe. The 
breath of life left him, and the gods abandoned him; he asked Agni, 
the Fire, to restore him (SB .6. 1 .2 . 1 2-13). Hence the gods built up 
Prajapati and gave him the shape of the fire altar (SB .6. 1 .2 ' 1 4- 1 8). 
Brick by brick they built him up in the fullness of a year, the time in 
which nature renews and spends itself. The building of the altar was 
a paradigmatic rite in which Prajapati was recomposed symbolically 
by the piling up of a structure. As the gods had done first, so man, the 
sacrificer, was to build up the fire altar as the counterpart of Prajapati 
(cf. SB.l 1 . 1 .8.3). By doing this sacred work, the sacrificer consecrated 
himself magically, for he meted out the proportions of the altar ac­
cording to his own measure. I I The fire altar thus became a work of 
identification, a homology by sacred, architectural rites, of man and 
the Creator. Reassembling the fallen, exhausted, dispersed Prajapati 
by sacred knowledge and sacred work, the sacrificer restored the Cre­
ator to pristine totality, to last as long as time lasts in its cycles, of 
which the year is the unit. Prajapati, who was weakened, is the year 
(SB. 6. 1 .  2. I 8, 1 9) and " the Year . . .  is the same as Death, for he [Praja­
pati, the year] . . .  , by means of day and night, destroys the life of 
mortal beings" (SB . 1 O-4-3. 1 ).12 Day and night are taken here not in 
their cyclical renewal but in their succession along the arrow of time. 
Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, is the year. Exhausted from cre­
ation, he was afraid of death, which he carried in himself in the 
succession of days and nights. Time and death were immanent in the 
work of the Creator, and in him inasmuch as he identified himself 
with his creation. Prajapati was afraid of death, which he carried 
within him and into creation, for without death the year would have 
no form; not dying, it would have no end, no time to die in. Time 
pervaded the work of the Creator and himself at work. It held sway 
over him. 
The visual figure of Prajapati, the year, was a volumetric shape, an 
altar built of bricks and replete with the symbolic significance of each 
single brick. The year with its seasons and, with it, death, as the Briih­
ma'[ta of a Hundred Paths explicitly states, was built into its structure. It

was not the movement of time but the sections of the year, the unit of 
recurrent time, that were symbolically laid out, their sequence in time 
conveyed by the spatial order according to which the brick symbols 
were laid down. The "time" of Prajapati, or Prajapati as Time, al­
lowed itself to be laid out spatially in a work of architecture. The-time 
of Siva flowed into the movement of the limbs of Siva, the lord of the 
dance. Works of sculpture and architecture demonstrate each in its 
own form the time of which they are the symbols. The building of the 
Vedic altar, by the accompanying words of the sacred rite of architec­
ture, is self-explanatory. Symbolically, time, the time of the seasons, 
was built into the altar. The form of the altar comprised time, con­
ceived as it were in terms of space. 
Prajapati, who sacrifices himself into creation and is ritually re­
stored by sacrificial man, the builder of the altar, is a self-contained 
symbol of the renewal of life. The building of the altar is the means 
by which man, like the Creator himself, is restored to wholeness (cf. 
SB . 1 1 . 1 .8.4-6). Prajapati's collapse is made good by his restoration. 
The symbol of his restoration, the altar, is piled, brick by brick; their 
layers make up its shape as the seasons make up the body of the year. 
The other myth of Prajapati was not enacted ritually by man on 
earth; it was seen in the sky by the gods. Prajapati, the antelope, be­
came the victim of Rudra. Pierced by his arrow, the wounded ante­
lope fled to the sky and became a star. Some say that the star is the 
head of the antelope (Mrgasira) (SB .2.1 .2.8), and that Prajapati, 
pierced by Rudra's arrow or by the gods, abandoned his body, "for 
the body is a mere relic (or dwelling, vastu)" (SB .2.1 .2.9).13 Even so, it 
was Prajapati's body, the body of the sacrifice. It is also said that Praja­
pati assumed the form of the sacrifice and that he gave himself up to 
be sacrificed (SB . 1 1 . 1 .8.2-3). Prajapati the antelope, the sacrificed an­
imal, and Prajapati the year, the sacrificial altar, are here equivalent. 
The myths of Rudra "sacrificing" Prajapati and of Prajapati's self-sac­
rifice were drawn together. 
The year, Prajapati, was renewed each spring, at the vernal equi­
nox, when a star was seen to rise before the sun. The star "supported" 
or heralded the rising sun and vanished when the sun had risen. With 
this spectacle in the sky began a new sacrificial year, a new cycle oflife. 
The priest, watching the sky, uttered the vlZ$at call over the auspicious

star and began to perform the rites of the new year sacrifice when the 
star was no longer visible, and until the sun had come to the spot 
where the star was last seen.14 For generations, the star that heralded 
the rising of the sun at the spring equinox was Orion; the beginning 
of the year was announced by the same star. Then over generations, 
the priest watching the sky observed that it was no longer Orion that 
rose before the sunrise of the spring equinox. The sun had moved 
away and rose in another star, Aldebaran. The beginning of the sac­
rificial year had moved from Orion to Aldebaran; Prajiipati had 
moved toward RohilJi. The precession of the equinoxes, watched over 
more than a millennium (from ca. 4500 to ca. 3400 B .C.),15 was tele­
scoped mythically in the image of Prajiipati moving toward RohilJi. 
Rudra (Sirius), seeing that Prajiipati had moved to RohilJi, aimed at 
him. 
Astronomical time, that is, the movement of the stars, illuminates 
the mythical movement of Rudra's appearance on the primordial 
scene. Mythically, Rudra appeared on the scene of the primordial 
morning out of nowhere and no time, right out of the Uncreate. His 
arrow, however, sped along time that carried it from intent to target. 
Having entered the scene, Rudra brought with him time. Its length 
was that of the flight of his arrow. 
Prajiipati as the embodiment of the annual cycle of vegetative life 
played his part in the dawn of that first morning. Astronomically, it 
began a new era, that of RohilJi. Mythically, however, that morning 
signified the beginning of time as such and the dawn of creation. Rit­
ually, Prajiipati was built up as the altar. Its layers were the seasons. 
Sections of time were homologized with spatial extent. Noetically, the 
conception of time preceded its symbols. In the language of myth, 
Time would be the father of Prajiipati. 
Thus, the Atharva Veda speaks of Time as the father of Prajiipati 
(AV. lg.53.8). Father Time is in the highest heaven (AV. lg.53.3), be­
yond the cosmos, beyond Prȳiipati. He has engendered the past and 
the future (AV. lg.53.5). His is the eternal present, a time beyond 
time, duration without beginning or end: timeless transcendency in 
the Uncreate. Time is the source of immortality and all beings 
(AV. lg.53.2). Time transcended Prajiipati and became his son, living 
with his creatures as their past and future (cf. AV. lg.53.4). In the

AthanJa Veda account, transcendent Time spontaneously flowed into 
creation. Neither violence nor sin accompanied its descent. The bea­
tific epiphany of transcendental time in the temporality of the created 
world included Prajapati. 
Although Siva played no part in the hymns of Time of the Atharoa 
Veda (AV. 19.53, 54), the Svetasvatara Upan4ad knows Siva as beyond 
time. "Higher and other than time . . .  is he from whom the world 
revolves" (SUp.6.6). "He is the beginning, the impulse of the causes 
. . .  beyond time, and without separate parts" (SUp.6'5)' "Into him 
. . . in the beginning and at the end the universe is gathered" 
(SUp+ I). "He is the maker of time" (kiilakara) (SUp.6.2, 16). 
Time in manifestation, when the first sun was rising over a world of 
temporality, was Rudra's invisible, cooperating antagonist. Their in­
teraction was set in motion from a source in the beyond. The Atharva 
Veda calls this originator Kala in the highest heaven. The Svetasvatara 
Upan4ad calls him Siva. 
Siva is Time beyond time, Time undivided in its plenitude, as it was 
before and is beyond creation. Transcendental Time, as the fullness 
of eternity, pervades the Uncreate. Time in the Uncreate is the hid­
den source of the causes that unite the Uncreate with creation. At this 
junction, Rudra discharged his arrow. The motionless time of eter­
nity, which permeates the Uncreate, set forth into creation as tempo­
rality. The Wild God together with his cooperating antagonist were 
its figures. The cause itself that set them forth bears their own names. 
It is called Kala in the highest heaven or Siva as Kalakara, "the maker 
of time." The theophany of Siva as Time has taken into itself Kala in 
the highest heaven. From him the world revolves, in him is the origin 
of the revolving time world; he spins the universe, and draws its ro­
tating axis back into timelessness. 
Siva, however, as transcendental Time as such, is called Mahakala 
(MBh. 12, app. 1 ,  no. 28, line 249), time in its vastness; whereas within 
creation he is all movement in time, for this is how Time manifests. 
Siva is the cosmic dancer, Rudra the hunter, whose arrow flies in time. 
As Rudra let the arrow fly and the sun was already rising over the pri­
mal scene, paradoxically undisturbed motionless Time took what is 
his-namely, time-put it between the intent of the maker of time 
and his target-and the seed of the Father flowed down on the earth. 
The irruption of transcendental Time into creation, its transmuta­
tion into the temporality of this world, made itself felt as a searing, 

K A LA A N D  M A H A K ALA • 2 7 3  
invisible combustion that consumed continuously the universe. Kala, 
Time, came down in an uninterrupted current, imperceptibly assail­
ing all beings, unnoticeably from instant to instant changing each 
creature, drawing it into obscurity, touching every part of man and 
the universe (MBh.I Z.Z I 7. 1 8-S9). The descent of transcendent Time 
into the world of temporality was an invisible, continuous combustion 
of existence, darkly insidious and silent. "In the conversation of peo­
ple time moves along in imperceptible form" (SP.S.Z6. 1O). 
Mythically, Time, the cooperating antagonist of Siva, coalesced with 
Siva. Cosmogonically, transcendent Time descended into the world, 
extending while consuming its substance from within, in an imper­
ceptible process. From this ailing world as his background in manifes­
tation, Siva withdrew and became Sthal)u, the post, in whom time 
stood still. 
It was Sthal)u who made Brahma desist from the holocaust Brahma 
had intended. At that time the Great Yogi, acknowledging the inex­
orable movement of time, which he transcends (SUp.6.S), and of 
which he himself is the cause (SUp.6.z), in the stillness of his stance 
appealed to Brahma. Siva as Sthal)u, the pillar, the Great Yogi. had in 
himself that timeless state that he has as Kala in the highest heaven. 
Brahma inserted into the inexorable onrush of time the quiescence 
that was in Sthal)u. Thenceforward time flowed rhythmically through 
the activity of life to the quietude of its cessation and on to a new life. 
The aeviternal return is a form of Siva's yogic stasis projected into the 
ceaseless movement of time, a paradoxical entry of transcendental 
Time or timelessness in which the Great Yogi dwells, into the relent­
less passage of time. Cyclical time of alternating activity and with­
drawal is a modality, created by Brahma, of Siva's, Sthal)u's, being. 
This form of the "eternal return," brought about by Brahma cooper­
ating with Siva, is related to Prajapati, the year's recurrent time. Its 
cycle revolves in the life of nature; the other, the time of the "eternal 
return," flows through the hearts of the believer. 
At another cosmic moment, at the churning of the ocean, Siva took 
into himself the world poison that is time. He swallowed the poison 
that had risen from the ocean, or which Vasuki, the king of serpents 
of the netherworld, had thrown up. Its flames and fumes would have 
asphyxiated gods and demons alike. Or it was not Vasuki but Ananta, 
the Endless, the cosmic serpent, from whose mouth Kalakii˷a, the poi­
son called time, had issued (cf. KuP. I .4Z.z6-z8). 

2 7 4 · B HA I RA V A  
SthaI)u inserted his timeless being into time, giving it the rhythm of 
all who were to breathe in life and cease in death and start again in an 
ever-renewed systole and diastole. The aeviternal return is a form of 
time due to Siva's compassion for living beings. 
All the same, time proceeds relentlessly, composed of minute parts 
that are less than an instant (Ñatla), composed of days, months, and 
years; every fraction of Kala is a form of Siva (MBh.13.17. 1 38; 
SP .7. 1 .7.6). Kala is forever at work, changing at every moment the liv­
ing bodies that he consumes. The inexorable power of Kala cannot be 
fought because Kala creates the beings and destroys them; everything 
is in Kala's power, but Kala is in no one else's power. He controls all 
this. Hence Kala has been described as pratla, the vital breath 
(KUP.2.3. 16- 1 7). Imperceptibly, Kala's identity slides over that of 
Rudra, the life breath in all beings. and Lord Siva recognizes himself 
behind Kala's mask (Ch. VII.6). 
Siva is "the maker of time" (SUp.6.2, 1 6). By acting as he did from 
the beginning, he created time, his cooperating antagonist. They ap­
peared simultaneously on the scene of the world. Rudra the Fire, 
Agni, is also Kalagni (Kala-Agni), the Fire that destroys the world, the 
fire that is time. Time pervades the manifest universe, the world of 
maya. In the song of the Lord, the isvara Gita, Rudra says of himself 
that being the master of and one with maya, he becomes united with 
Kala, creates the universe, and also destroys it (KUP.2.3.22-23). Kala, 
impelled by Rudra, creates the universe and gives it momentum. 
Rudra gives the impetus to Kalajust as he prepared the seed for the 
Father. Rudra is the prime mover, Kala is the dark, world-destroying 
form of Lord Siva, Sambhu, who is benevolent (KuP . 1 .42.29). 
Rudra destroys the world by assuming the form of Kala 
(KUP. 1.42.28-29). Being but a form, an aspect issued from the Lord, 
Kala is said to be born of Sankara, the bringer of peace (KuP . 1 .42.29), 
as much as Kalagni, the destroyer, who reduces everything to ashes, 
becomes Mahesvara, the Great Lord (KUP.2.44.2-3). 
Kala, whether as Rudra or born of Rudra (MBh. 13.16.51), and 
breathing with him in all beings, retains his own aeviternal identity. 
He is Time, the Destroyer, Death, in every breath in creation. The 
gods were afraid of him. "All the gods, frightened by Kala, saw the 
Great Lord who is Hara, the ravisher, and, calmed by him, became 
peaceful" (KUP. 1 .24.40). In their fear, the gods were drawn to Hara / 
Siva, as fearful an aspect of the Great God as is Kala. Hara took away 

K A LA A N D  M A H A K A LA • 2 7 5  
their fear and restored peace to them. Kala, Time, is but a nuance of 
Hara, the Destroyer. Kala knows no peace. Kala is perpetual move­
ment, has and gives no rest, races along from beginning to end, with­
out respite, merciless, offering no refuge. Siva Kalagni, the consum­
ing fire of time, Siva Sankara, the bringer of peace "into whom at the 
beginning and at the end all the universe is gathered" (S Up.4. 1 ), is the 
origin of the world and its destroyer (MBh. 13. 145.38-39; 13.14. 1 82-
85), so that it can arise anew. 
The Time by which the worlds come to an end is different from the 
time that measures life (cf. SSi. l . lO). Time that measures life is lived 
time; its desired duration for the human being is a hundred years. 
Rudra has the power to cut short its span. Inasmuch as Kala is Rudra, 
Rudra is Death, or a form of death (MBh. 13.14. 1 84). He consumes life 
by burning it up as Agni (MBh. 13. 14. 1 84); he is Death (Mrtyu) and the 
god of death (Yama); he is Kala (Time) (MBh.13. 16.5 1). Time is the 
universal destroyer (MBh. 1 3. 1 7.3 1 -32). He burns the universe that he 
has created (MBh.13.14. 1 2g, 161). His form is time (MBh. 13. 1 7. 104). 
He is past, present, and future (SP.7. 1 .7.4), and he is aeviternal time, 
form of the ceaseless succession of birth and death. Everything arises 
from Kala and perishes through Kala (SP.7. 1 .7. 1). Kala is relentless, 
unilineal time, Death, the Ender, unassuaged by the palliative of the 
aeviternal return into which Rudra let flow his yogic absorption, un­
amenable to elixirs (SP.7. 1 .7. 1 4). Time is the universal fatality. "The 
whole universe caught in its mouth whirls like a wheel through the 
activities of creation and annihilation" (SP.7. 1 .7.2).16 While Siva rec­
ognizes himself as Time, opening that dangerous mouth; he recog­
nizes himself in his own image spread over the firmament as Kalarii­
pin, the shape of time, the Zodiac (VmP.5.28-30; cf. MBh. 1 3. 1 7. 104). 
Within Siva's being, Siva Kalariipin is the antithesis of Siva, the Lord 
of Yoga. As the Supreme Yogi, Siva is the imaged symbol not of time 
but of eternity, the unfathomable dimension of the Uncreate realized, 
paradoxically, within embodied beings who are yogis (SP.5.26. 1 2). 
Kala, the inherent calamity of existence, is a form of Siva, is under the 
control of Siva, but Siva is not subject to its control (SP.7. 1.7.9-1O). 
Rudra in manifestation coalesced with his antagonist at the begin­
ning of creation, and Rudra as Kalagni-Rudra, the Fire that is Time, 
absorbs the world into his own self at the time of destruction (AUP.55 
1 6 Siva Purarw (SP). tr. "A Board of Scholars" and ed. J. L. Shastri, 1963, p. 1 799.

and commentary). Thus, when the creation is to be dissolved, Rudra 
assumes the forms of Kala, the all-consuming fire (MBh . 1 3. 14. 1 84-
85), and burns down the universe (AP'368.7- 1 1 ). He burns it down 
and dances wildly (SP.33.28-29). The consuming fire of time is the 
Destroyer. Kala devours existence in the dark abyss of his wide jaws. 
The power of burning, devouring Kala cooperates with tamas, 
"darkness," the tendency of disintegration. They are at one within 
Rudra, who draws the world into nonexistence. Tamas, a quality in­
herent in creation, has no mythical figure, as Kala does. Tamas, the 
tendency of disintegration, like Kala, all-consuming time, is active 
from the beginning. "Whatever destroys any existing thing, moveable 
or stationary"17 is the Destroyer, Rudra (VP. 1 .22.39). Rudra to whom 
tamas belongs enters the night of destruction into which creation has 
been drawn. There, Kala, of dark complexion (LP . 1 .95.41), as Ka­
lagni Rudra absorbs the world into himself (AUP.55 and commen­
tary). Rudra remains even after all is gone at the end of the kalpa 
(MBh. 1 3. 14. 1 85), even as he existed before creation and before time 
(AUp.2 and commentary). Then, however, there was no darkness and 
"when there is no darkness, then there is no day or night, nor being, 
nor nonbeing," only Siva alone. "That is the Imperishable," "the ador­
able light of the Impeller, and the ancient wisdom proceeded from 
that" (SUP+ 1 8).18 
Siva's ambience comprises and exceeds the world of time. The 
Great Yogi, the destroyer of all fetters, is also the destroyer of time. 
Kala's realm is the world, the entire manifestation. While he races 
through it unchecked, he leaves behind him the motionless bodies 
across which he has sped. Kala means death to the body, to individual 
existence. Siva, the Great God in transcendency, made and impelled 
Kala, made him, in manifestation, share his entire domain, to unfold 
his innumerable illusions, while he from whom this world revolves is 
beyond and other than time (cf. SUp.6.6). Timelessness is an attribute 
that "undefines" the Uncreate. Rudra, the guardian of the Uncreate 
and avenger of its violation, in his form of Sthat:lu is the yogi in whom 
the Uncreate is restored in its integrity. MoÑa, release from the fetters 
of contingency, is the recreated Uncreate, recreated by yoga, of which 
Rudra is the lord. The discipline of yoga is a mode of the creative

power. "Yoga is called maya (creative power) by the wise, and Maha­
deva, the Great God, is ိalled yogi and Lord of Yoga" (KUP.2.4.30). 
Yoga is a fervent discipline or asceticism by which the human prac­
titioner releases the power to dissolve his bondage to the world (cf. 
SP .5.26. 1 2). By the same yoga, Mahadeva, the Great Lord of Yoga, 
creates this world in all its contingency and relativity in which ultimate 
reality is shrouded by his maya. In his ultimate reality, Siva does not 
unfold the veil of maya. Being beyond action, he does not reveal the 
creative power by which he sets the world in motion. Setting it into 
motion, he is Kala, whom he impels (KUP.2.4.28-2g) aeviternally. This 
impulsion out of eternity, an act of supreme bliss, is Siva's, the yogi's, 
eternal dance (KUP.2-4-33). 
Impelled by the supreme joy of creative power, god Kala is given 
his mandate, and by his own sport, aeon after aeon, he consumes the 
whole universe; and having consumed it, Kala becomes Mahakala 
(SkP.4. 1 .7.91 ). Kala, the dark mode of Siva, moves as an antiphony of 
Siva's dance; the fire of creation becomes recognizable in the fire of 
destruction as it flares up again and again, until its extinction, when 
Kala, Time, consumes itself and becomes Mahakala, absolute Time or 
timelessness. 
Kala is the dark mode of Siva. Kala means "time," "death," and 
"black." It is equivalent to tamas, the dark tendency of disintegration, 
of which Siva is the lord. As Kala he swallows everything with the 
quality of darkness (KUP . l . I0.82). Compacting the images and nar­
rative of myth with Samkhya philosophy, the Kurma Purarta evokes 
the progress of Kalagni, the Fire of Time, which burns everything to 
ashes. He burns the whole universe along with gods, demons, and 
men. Taking on a terrifying appearance and entering the sun's orb, 
he burns the entire world. After the conflagration of the gods, the 
Goddess stands alone, the sole witness; with a garland of the skulls of 
the gods as His ornament, He fills heaven. He has a thousand eyes, a 
thousand shapes, a thousand hands, a thousand feet, a thousand rays, 
huge arms, fangs in his dreadful face, eyes blazing, holding a trident, 
wearing animal skin, abiding in divine yoga, having drunk supreme, 
abundant, nectarine bliss, the Supreme Lord dances the TaT)Qava 
dance. The highly blessed goddess, having drunk the nectar of the 
dance of her consort, through yoga enters the body of the trident­
bearing god (KUP.2.44.2- 1 2). 
Leaving the ecstasy of the Tal).Qava dance at his pleasure, the Lord 

2 7 8 
• B H A I RA V A  
sees the burning universe. Then the earth with all her properties dis­
solves into water. Fire devours the water; fire is dissolved in wind, 
wind in space, space in the sense organs; the gods are dissolved in one 
of the three modes of bondage constituting ahamkiira (the individuat­
ing principle); ahamkiira is dissolved in mahat (cosmic intellect), and 
mahat is dissolved in brahman. After dissolving the elements and the 
principles in this manner, the Great Lord separates prakrti (cosmic 
substance) from puru$a (spirit). Their dissolution does not come about 
by itself. It is willed by the Great Lord. Prakrti nonmanifest is the equi­
librium of the gUfl(ls. Prakrti, the womb of the world, is without con­
sciousness. Puru$a, Consciousness itself, the twenty-fifth principle 
(tattva), stands at the apex, apart, the Only One. The sages call him 
the witness. Thus, according to sacred tradition, does the perpetual 
power of the Great Lord Rudra burn everything, from prakrti to at­
oms (KUP.2.44. 1 3-24). 
Kalagni, the Fire of Time, operates within creation and devours it. 
Timelessness as it was before creation, before the beginning in which 
inheres the end, has its figure in god Mahakala, Time as measureless 
immensity. Mahakala is the ultimate paradox of time. 
While Kala and Kalagni are degrees of Rudra in manifestation, at 
its end and beyond manifestation, Kala alone has a witness and victim 
in every living being. Releasing his clutch on life as Kalagni, in a con­
suming blaze of selfီignition, his metamorphosis is the metaphysical 
fulfillment of time as Mahakala, eternity. The mythical figure of Ma­
hakala is Bhairava. The hierarchy of Time within Lord Siva is acted 
out in the myth of Bhairava. The myth shows the overcoming oftem­
porality that has its image in Kala, the god who is Time and Death, 
gorging himself on the bodies of the living. As such, Kala is commit­
ted to an act of continuous destruction, aeon after aeon. Then the 
Lord Kalagni Rudra, the highest lord, the seed of the universe, the 
fire of annihilation "whose form is time and who has no torm" 
(KuP . 1 .28.48), reduces everything to ashes and merges the self in his 
own Self (KUP.2.44.2-3). 
4. SIVA'S DANCE FOR B.٣I MANKA٤AKA 
Siva showed himself to each of his devotees in a shape that met the 
need of the worshiper. Once, in Saptasarasvata, a place of pilgrimage, 
Mankal)aka, a n;i, worshiped Siva by muttering the five-syllabled man-

tra: Namal,t Siviiya. ˸i MankaQ.aka was aglow with fervid asceticism. In 
the transport of his joy that Rudra had come, he danced. Rudra asked 
him for what purpose he had danced. Although MankaQ.aka saw the 
Lord Rudra, he did not reply; he danced again and again. When the 
Lord, the holy one, saw MankaQ.aka wrapped up in self-gratifying 
pleasure and conceit, Rudra, to destroy the vanity of the ri, tore open 
his own body. Ashes came out of it, the proof of asceticism. Then 
Rudra, the destroyer of the moving universe, assumed a form of su­
preme majesty: he danced, thousand-headed, thousand-eyed, thou­
sand-footed, his face dreadful with fangs, flame garlanded, terrifying 
(KUP.2'34.44-S3)' Then the Lord God resumed his former shape, em­
braced his devotee, and as a boon revealed himself to Mankal).aka as 
Kala and the maker of Kala, the actuator who impels all (KUP.2.34.S6-
63)· 
The excitable ˸i Mankal).aka was one in name and legend with a 
seer who marked by his hermitage and history a particular tzrtha in 
Kuruketra (MBh'3.8 1 . 1 ,  97). The holy land of Kuruketra, to the 
south of the river Sarasvati, abounded in lakes and sacred places of 
pilgrimage (tzrtha) (MBh'3.81 . 17S-78). At the Gate of Kuruketra is 
the tirtha of a famous yak$ini (MBh'3.81. 19-20); three other yak$as 
guard the other gates: Macakruka, Tarantuka, and Arantuka 
(MBh'3.81 .7, 1 3, 42; cf. 1 78). Together, these four marked a sacred 
square. The sacrt>d geography of India was laid out in squares, 
guarded at the four points by yak$as, potent presences who sustained 
the wealth in the soil and the nourishment in the plants. The yak$as 
had female counterparts, the yak$irtzs. Their weighty, colossal images, 
carved in stone, abounded in northern and mid-India. They were 
more ancient than the Mahiibhiirata and some are still in existence, 
though the yak$as ceded their worship to other gods who superseded 
them.19 One tirtha belonging to the Great Goddess is known as Sa­
kambhari; here the Goddess subsisted for a thousand celestial years 
on plants alone.20 She attracted many ris, rich in asceticism. Because 
she entertained them with planis (siika), she became known by the 
name Sakambhari (MBh.3.82. 1 1-13). Did ˸i Mankal).aka, a siddha or 
sage possessed of magic powers, subsist on plants and feel their juice 
pulsate through his body, strengthening and elating him (MBh. 
19 Cf. V. S. Agrawala, Matsya Pura{la-A Study, 1963, pp. 280-8 1 .

3.8 J .g7-98)? Did he, like Trita fallen into a well (RV. 1 . 105. 1 7; 
10.8.7), on seeing a creeper hanging down into it, will mentally the 
juice of the plant to be the juice of Soma, the elixir of immortality 
(MBh .g. 35. 25-33)? 
The Mahiibhiirata gives a different account of the meeting of Siva 
and Ri Mankal).aka. Once, when Mankal).aka accidentally cut his fin­
ger with a blade of kusa grass and plant juice flowed from his wound, 
his joy was boundless and he danced. Overwhelmed by the powerful 
skill of his dance, all the creatures and plants began to dance. The 
gods, however, went to Mahadeva requesting him to stop the dancing 
ri. It was then that the Great God appeared before the ri and asked 
the reason for the overwhelming joy that made him dance 
(MBh'3.8 1 .g7-103)' The ri gave the miracle of the plant juice flowing 
from his wound as the reason for his joy and dancing. Siva struck his 
thumb with one of his fingers and ashes as white as snow flowed from 
his wound. The ri fell at the feet of Lord Siva and worshiped him as 
the creator and ordainer of the universe and to whom all return at 
the end of the yuga (MBh'3.8 1 . 104-109)' In the legend, twice told in 
the Mahiibhiirata (cf. MBh.g'37'34-48), Siva showed Mankal).aka the 
snow-white heap of ashes that flowed from his body. Siva, in these 
early versions of the legend, did not dance. He did not display his 
dance of Time and Death against Mankal).aka's self-absorbed joyous 
transport. Siva revealed himself in the stillness of ashes falling from 
the wound of his body, from a higher incandescence than that of vital 
exuberance or emotional transport. 
The siddha / f$i Mankal).aka had absorbed into himself the nourish­
ing juices of the plants of this earth or the Soma juice itself, and the 
juices retained their purity within the body of the siddha. When Man­
kal).aka saw the plant juice flowing from his body, he felt freed from 
the bondage of blood. The flow of ashes, however, from the body of 
the Great God showed a higher degree of rarefication than the ri had 
achieved by the transformation of his blood into plant juice. Siva had 
absorbed the world into his own self at the time of dissolution (AUP.55 
and commentary). He showed himself as Kala and the actuator of 
Kala, the fire that burns to ashes the world and all its sins (d. 
KUP.2.34.62). "What is Agni is ashes; what is air, is ashes; . . .  what is 
all this (phenomenal world) is ashes; what are the mind and such as 
these, the eyes, are ashes alone; the Avyakta from which all these orig-

T I ME TO ETE R N I T Y · 2 8 1  
inate, is also ashes,"21 runs the PiiSupata Vrata, the mantra of the lord 
of creatures (AUp.67). The elements or sense objects, the senses, 
mind, and its fabric are burned up, one in the other, in the ultimate 
conflagration that has its symbol in ashes and its Kilagni-Rudra image 
in the dance of Siva when Mankal).aka trembled and bowed his head 
before the Lord (cf. KtiP.2.34.55). He enlightened the sage, allowing 
him to see beyond the elation of the senses and the mind, when Siva, 
the Fire, will dance the cosmos out of existence and nothing will re­
main but Siva alone (cf. SP.33.28-39)· 
5. THE BREAKTHROUGH FROM TIME TO ETERNITY 
When the gods first observed with amazement that the equinoctial 
sun had moved from one star to another and that along with it the 
beginning of the year had moved from Orion, they had witnessed on 
the ecliptic the precession of the equinoxes, the greatest movement of 
time in the cosmos. Rudra, the Wild Hunter, aimed at Prajapati, the 
year. Did he mean to arrest or undo the movement of time, as he had 
meant to prevent the flow of life out of the Uncreate? Prajapati's 
mythical image was the antelope, whereas, ritually, the year was his 
form. Projected to the stars, the two modes of reference coalesced. 
The constellation Orion was beheld as the figure of Prajapati, the an­
telope. As such, Prajapati had his position fixed in the sky, whereas 
Prajapati, the year, had his visual symbol on earth, in the architecture 
of the Vedic altar. It was, however, so it would seem, the movement 
of the vernal equinoctial point, which marked the beginning of the 
year, that is, Prajapati, from Orion toward Aldebaran (Rohil).i) that 
gave its meaning to the star myth. 
Rudra was its protagonist, Time his unnamed, cooperating antag­
onist. Time began in consonant ambiguity with Rudra. The ambiguity 
of Kala was to become the certainty of Death. Rudra as Sarva, the 
fierce archer, saw to it and Rudra as Mrtyuiijaya freed from it. The 
world of Rudra, the Wild God, had this coherence. He established its 
pattern in the dawn of the world, when he became Pasupati, the Lord 
of Animals. 
Rudra is Agni the Fire. Fire is a hunter. Time is a fire that burns its 
way through life; Kalagni, the fire that is time, burns up life, ends it. 
2 1  AthaTVaSira Upan@ad (AUp). lr. T.R.S. Ayyangar and ed. G. S. Muni. 1953. p. 49. 

2 8 2  • B H A I RA V A  
Kala, Time, is Death. In its cosmic dimension he is Kalagni, the 
doomsday fire consuming the entire creation. 
Acting as the Wild Hunter, Rudra set time in motion and time took 
its course. It seemingly ran counter to Rudra's immediate intent, 
though it provided the dimension in which to manifest his actions. 
Rudra and Kala were a syzygy \hose momentum Rudra provided. As 
Kaiagni, at the end of the yugas, the fire that is Death consumes 
everything, including time. "Praise be to Kala of dark complexion; 
praise to the destroyer of Kala" (LP. 1.95.41). Siva, in ultimate fulfill­
ment of his nature, the Fire engulfing the darkness (lamas) of time, 
ends time itself. Siva, the prime mover, as Kalakala (SP.23.24), Time 
beyond time, full of the highest bliss, dances at the end of the world 
(SP .23.42). Encircled by flames he dances the world out of existence. 
All its forms dissolve in the vehemence of his dance, and their essence 
is reabsorbed in the universal consciousness, in Siva. During pralaya, 
the state of dissolution, manifestation lies dormant until its slumber­
ing potentialities shine forth in the dawn of a new creation. There, 
they germinate out of eternity into time. 
Time, the antagonist and alter ego of Siva, has the manifest world 
as his field of action. In the shape of iiyus, the length of life or lived, 
experienced time, he stood as "fulcrum in the nest of the Highest" 
(RV. 1O.5.6).22 This image was one of the signs marking the frontier 
of human understanding and of absolute transcendency. The "nest of 
the Highest," in which life is hatched, was located, like the bull-cow, 
the image of Agni, on the razor-sharp yet insubstantial line that for­
bids entry into ultimate reality. In itself without dimension, it is out of 
bounds to human understanding, for whose sake the signs were set 
up on the border. 
With his first shot Rudra signaled that creation, the time-world of 
movement and action, had begun. Paradoxically, his arrow was di­
rected away from the nascent world of beings. Rudra had aimed in 
the other direction whence the seed was about to leave its source. 
Thence, he derived his own momentum when, as Sarva, he let his ar­
rows fly into creation. Rudra started his work as a hunter, an archer, 
and he fulfilled it as a dancer. His first witness and victim had been 
the Father. At the end he remains himself the only witness of the 
time-world consumed by his flames.

T I M E  TO ETERN ITY • 2 8 3 
As the cosmic dancer, Siva's work was completed, though not ter­
minated. At the end of each aeon, the Great God dances the cosmos 
out of existence. Creation / destruction, an aeviternal process, takes 
place in temporality, the time world of Rudra-Siva. 
It was of his own making and as son of Brahma, the Creator, that 
he let himself be born into it. Brahma wanted his son to complete the 
work of creation, whereupon Rudra became SthaQu, motionless, de­
tached, withdrawn, drawing within himself the life that Prajapati had 
meant him to bring into the world. As SthaQu, the post, Rudra 
showed himself the counterpart of the tree of life, unconsumed fuel 
to his fire, potent in seemingly arid starkness, as were the white ashes 
that he let flow from his body for ုi MankaQaka to see. 
SthaQu stood by, leaving Brahma's work unachieved, making him­
self the sign of a reality that though without definition was capable of 
being realized. As sign of cessation, SthaQu, the post, stood for the 
arrest of time, a state beyond death. The symbol shape of Siva SthaQu, 
the branchless stem, stands opposite to the image of dancing Siva, his 
many arms, his flowing hair filling the cosmos with the rhythms of his 
being. SthaQu standing by the moving universe is a symbol of the 
timeless state attainable in samiidhi. Siva, the Lord of Yoga, dwells in 
timeless eternity, while Siva, the dancer, performs his aeviternal 
dance at the end of each aeon across which Kala speeds. 
Out of the timelessness of his stasis, SthaQu communicated his 
being to Time. The presence of SthaQu, when Brahma had willed to 
terminate in a holocaust his flawed creation, made the Creator adjust 
the straight line of time running from past to future to alternating 
phases of movement and rest. SthaQu, in ascetic withdrawal from the 
world, motionless and beyond time, represents eternity realized from 
within. The post is a symbol of the restitution in creation of timeless­
ness that was and is in the Uncreate. The shape of the post points up­
ward. It supports nothing but the empyrean, and signifies its realized 
presence in the world of time, in the heart of man. Moved by pity, 
Siva SthaQu made Brahma impart the pause of quiescence-a reflex 
of eternity-to the stream of time whence life and action would re­
surge once more. 
Rudra, the Wild God, had set time into motion-past, present, and 
future, a fiery, consuming current. SthaQu, the Great Yogi, through 
Brahma's agency communicated the quiescence of timelessness in 
which he dwelled to the rushing stream of time. Even so, the waves of

time rolled on, through periods of activity and withdrawal until a final 
conflagration and dissolution (pralaya). 
Pralaya is the cosmic homology of absolute, transcendental Time, 
"Kala in the highest heaven" or Mahakala, before the descent of time 
into the world. At the end of the time-world, Kalagni Rudra, the fire 
that is time and annihilation, becomes Mahakala. As the last flame of 
Kalagni flares up, it expires in Mahakala. In that instant, Kalagni be­
comes and is Bhairava, in a leap from the dissolution of the cosmos 
into the metaphysical realm. The dissolution of the cosmos takes place 
in what had been manifestation. Its annihilation is but an image of 
transcendency, a homology of the Uncreate. In the leap from the an­
nihilation of the cosmos to the metaphysical realm or transcendency, 
Kalagni becomes Bhairava. His explicit name is Kalabhairava (cf. 
KUP.2.3 1 .7 1 ,  30). Because even Kala fears him, he is called Kalabhai­
rava (SP'3.8.47), or Kalaraja, the Lord of Kala (SP'3.8'46). Bhairava is 
a form of Siva (SP'3.8.60); more than that, Bhairava is Siva's integral 
form. It was Bhairava or Siva as Bhairava who snipped off Brahma's 
overweening head (KiiP.2·3 1 .30; SkP·3.1 .24.39; 4. 1 .3 1 .41, 48). 
The mythical identity of Bhairava corresponds with the explicit 
epistemological definition given to Bhairava in Saiva thought,23 from 
the ninth to the fourteenth century, in Kashmir and in South India. 
In the words of H. von Stietencron, "Bhairava [in Sa iva philosophy, 
especially in Kashmiri Saivism] is a designation for the undifferen­
tiated universal consciousness . . .  ,"24 comprising the entire cosmos as 
an unqualified and undivided whole. It is a state of supreme pleni­
tude of the absolute and the realization of this plenitude on the level 
of mental experience. "The state of absolute unity is at the same time 
the ultimate source of all creation." It is the first of "three fundamen­
tal planes" of experience or realization. The third and last plane "is 
that of resorption, of dissolution of the world in deity." "Employing a 
cosmic image, this is the instant when the god takes back into himself, 
i.e. swallows up, the play of the universe that he produced."25 
Brahma's assumed fifth head was severed by Bhairava. Libidinous 
from the start, overbearing and evil-tongued, it had appeared com­
peting with Siva's fifth head in transcendency, provoking Siva and its 
own fate.

Bhairava's shape was a syndrome of terror. The gods who put to­
gether the most terrible shapes in order to compose an adequate form 
of Pasupati's frightfulness (Ch. 1.2) exhausted their resources in giv­
ing plausibility to the appearance of the Wild God on his entry into 
the first act of the drama of creation. This conglomerate of horror, 
the guise of Rudra contrived by the gods, became threadbare in the 
course of more than a thousand years, and allowed the naked terror 
of the god to assume anthropomorphic features. No image of any 
other aspect of Siva comprises as many contrasting iconographic types 
as that of Bhairava, such as the frenzied, sinewy skeleton figure of 
Atiriktanga Bhairava26 or the staring, bloated, pot-bellied shape of 
Bhairava that the Vir(tudharmottara Pura'(ta (VDh.P .3.59. 1-5) de­
scribes.27 Bhairava, having swallowed up and consumed Time, had 
taken into himself the agonies of all time, the death pang of creatures, 
the hollow horrors oflife. Fed by them, he needed nothing more than 
the nail of his left thumb to cut off Brahma's head. 
The Father was wounded in his genitals by the Wild God who 
avenged the loss of integrity of the absolute that the Lord of Genera­
tion had caused. Rudra carried out a paradoxical task, for the fullness 
of the U ncreate is not ever depleted. It flowed into creation that came 
to recognize Rudra, the Lord, in his many shapes. In his ultimate, in­
tegral shape, the Great God reenacted the primordial scene: he as­
saulted the Creator, and the head of Brahma fell. 
Siva, son of Brahma, was born from the head of the Creator, from 
his breath, from his mind. Brahma, sarcastically, in order to humble 
26 Powerful images of Atiriktiinga Bhairava are in the RiimeSvara Cave (Cave 2 I) in 
Ellora, of the sixth century. (See T. A. Gopinatha Rao, Elements of Hindu Iconography, vol. 
2, part I ,  pl. 43); on the Vaital Deul, Bhuvanesvar, Orissa, see M. E. Adiceam, "Les 
images de Siva dans I'Inde du Sud, IV. KaI)kiila Mimi," 1965, p. 36, fig. 13. 
2 1  This type is represented by images of the Piila and Sena school of eastern India (cf. 
R. D. Banerjee, The Eastern Indian School of Medieval Sculpture, 1933, p l .  LV(c). Of spe­
cial significance are also the iconographic type of Vatuka Bhairava, riding on a dog 
(T. A. Gopinatha Rao,Elements of Hindu Iconography, vol. 2 ,  part I , p. 178) and the South 
Indian images of Siva standing in front of a large dog (M. Adiceam, "Les Images de Siva 
dans I'Inde du Sud, II. Bhairava," 1965, pp. 23-44, figs. 1-4, 7, 8) in lieu of Nandin, 
who conveys Siva. The Satarudriya renders special homage to the dogs (TS-4-5.4), and 
Viistoépati/Sirius is the dog star. The howling, large-mouthed dogs (AV. I 1 .2.30) belong 
to Rudra, the hunter and dweller in cremation grounds, as well. A small bronze sculp­
ture of about the fourteenth century from Nepal, P. Pal, Nepal, Where the Gods Are 
Young, 1975, pp. 94, 1 28, pI. 64 shows a shrine surrounded by a cremation ground. In 
the center of the shrine a dog is seated, his mouth open. The dog in the center of the 
shrine is Bhairava. 

286 • B H A I RA VA 
the Great God, reminded Siva of his place of origin. Bhairava cut off 
the fifth mocking head, in its most exposed, most vulnerable position. 
With one, barely perceptible gesture, Bhairava deleted in that head 
the consciousness of Rudra's birth into the cosmos. Kalagni Rudra, 
the destroyer of creation (SkP .7. log. I , 5), cut back the arrogant head, 
together with the memory it had held. Cutting off the head of the 
Creator, Kala Bhairava relieved Brahma of the evil that had been 
stored in his head. 
The head of Brahma fell and he died (SkP.3. 1 .24.39). The head 
stuck to the hand of Bhairava. Once more Rudra had acted as a par­
ricide. His guilt was not lessened when Isvara, the Lord Siva, brought 
Brahma back to life (SkP.3. 1.24.40). Or Siva consoled Brahma: 
though Siva had cut one of Brahma's heads, Brahma had four heads 
left that would never perish. Siva admonished Brahma not to worry 
over a predestined incident (VmP, SM.28.4-5, Ig-20). 
Time entered the cosmic scene when the Father cohabited with the 
daughter and Rudra set his arrow flying. Rudra set time into motion, 
allowing time to unfold. In a fiery stream it would burn itself into all 
living things, and consume them in the darkness of Kala, god Time 
who is Death (SP.7. 1 .7. 1 4) to the living, who is Kalagni, the Fire of 
doomsday, the conflagration of the cosmos. Everything will be anni­
hilated through Kala, as everything has originated from Kala (cf. 
SP .7. 1 .7. 1 ), Rudra's cooperating antagonist whom Rudra himself had 
set into motion, intent on preserving the integrity of the absolute, 
while its substance was already beginning to flow into creation. 
Everything is Kalagni's fuel until Rudra's unfettered being breaks 
through the flames. The breakthrough from time into timelessness is 
the mysterium tremendum of Siva Bhairava. It is the restitution of time­
lessness as it was before the beginning, the timelessness of the Un­
create. Bhairava is the integral Rudra at the instant of the break­
through from time (Kala) into the timeless immensity (Mahakala) of 
the Uncreate. 
At this instant, Bhairava, with the nail of his thumb, snipped off the 
fifth head of the Head of the Universe. The head fell straight into his 
hand, stuck to his left palm, and would never leave it (VmP.2.36-37)· 
Mahadeva made Bhairava, his "other form" and integral self, take 
upon him the Kapalika vow that he would go begging all over the 
world with his skull-bowl, collecting alms until the skull would fall 
from his hand. Bhairava had to undertake this vow, the Kiipiilika

Vrata (SP. 3.8.60-62; VrP. g7.9- 1O; cf. KUP. 2.31 .64-65; 67-68; SkP. 
4. 1 .31 .5. 1-53; cf. VmP. 2.38-43), in expiation of his sin for having 
cut off the fifth head of the Head of the World, the head of the Cre­
ator, his father. Worse than a parricide, Bhairava had cut off the head 
of Brahma, who was a brahmin, and brahminicide was known from 
ancient days as the most heinous of all crimes (cf. SB . 13.3.5.3). 
The head of Brahma stuck to Bhairava's palm. When god Indra 
twisted off the head of demon Namuci, it did not let him go, rolled 
after him, and accused him (RV.5.30.7; 6.20.6; TB . 1 .7. 1 .6-7). 
Brahma's severed head clung fast to Bhairava's palm. Its accusation 
took the shape of a dreadful fury, called brahmahatyii, the sin of brah­
minicide. 
Sthal)u and Bhairava are symbol and image of Siva as transcenden­
tal reality with reference to creation. Sthal)u is the symbol standing by 
creation; Bhairava takes 6ff from the created world. Both are figures 
of return from the world of time to the Uncreate, the latter with ref­
erence to cosmic, the former with reference to microcosmic or yogic 
realization. 
6. THE WANDERINGS OF BHAlRA VA AS THE SUPREME BEGGAR 
Mahadeva Kalabhairava roamed over the three worlds with the skull 
in his hand. He came to the Deodar forest (KiiP.2.31.73-78). The 
sages who dwelled in the forest did not recognize the naked mendi­
cant holding out his bowl. They were immersed in practicing austeri­
ties and tending the sacrificial fires. They conformed with sanctioned 
conventions. They had lost the way to release from bondage 
(KuP .2.37.2-4). 
They were shocked and provoked by the naked mendicant who 
had entered their establishment. Bhairava appeared in his form of 
Bhikøatana, the Supreme Beggar. As Kapalika / Kapalin, "bearer of 
the skull bowl," Siva had been known in the Mahiibhiirata WBh. 
13. 1 7. 1 00); there too he was known as Mahakala WBh. 1 2, app. 1 ,  no. 
28, line 249). 
Bhairava-Bhik;;atana, young, stark naked, with no distinguishing 
attribute except his begging bowl and a garland of forest flowers, at­
tracted the women and infuriated the r;;is. The Supreme Beggar, 
looking and behaving unlike anyone they had ever seen, put the r;;is 
to the test. He outraged their sense of propriety and excited their jeal-

2 8 8  • B H A I RA V A  
ousy. They were less concerned about the interruption of their aus­
terities and the loss of power that they had gained by these arduous 
exertions and that had accrued to them by the faithfulness of their 
wives.2H 
The subsequent castration of the Lord, along with the fall of the 
linga of the Supreme Beggar in the Deodar forest on Mount Himavan 
and its transfiguration, was as momentous an event as was the fall of 
Brahma's head, witnessed by the Vedas, on the peak of Mount Meru. 
Siva-Bhairava felled the head of Brahma, the seat of consciousness of 
the Creator. Bhairava ended the mythical time that had begun when 
the Father embraced the daughter and Rudra shot his arrow. By cut­
ting off the head of Brahma, Rudra, who was Kala, became Mahakala, 
the paradox of time in transcendency or the realization of eternity. 
The empty skull of Brahma stuck to the hand of Bhairava. As the beg­
ging bowl of the Supreme Mendicant it needed to be filled. 
The breakthrough of Kala, or time experienced, into the realiza­
tion of metaphysical time or timelessness marked the beginning of 
Bhairava's pilgrimage in the triple world. He was naked, had no other 
garment than the sky. He held out his empty begging bowl; readily 
the entranced women in the Deodar forest put in their alms. When 
he was castrated, his linga did not fall as easily as had Brahma's head. 
But when it did fall, it was transfigured as a fiery pillar without begin­
ning or end, and traversed the cosmos. 
In a former aeon, when Rudra emerged from the water, he tore 
out his linga in a rage. The linga was of no use to him, as he was un­
willing to procreate mortals, and someone else, Dak1;>a, had fulfilled 
this command of Brahma. This was not Rudra's, the Wild God's, the 
Great Yogi's, task. Inthe Deodar forest, the strangely seductive men­
dicant yogi let his linga fall. The sages cursed the organ of lust of the 
Supreme Beggar, the terrible god Bhairava. Had they not been out­
raged by his startling, un seeming ways, and had they looked at his 
begging bowl, they would have seen death staring at them from the 
skull that it was. Maybe the strange yogi was insane; he howled, 
danced, and smiled in bliss and terror. He offended all conventions, 
for he had broken through all limitations. He had overcome death, 
he was beyond time, but at the same time he was a murderer. He had 
murdered his father, the Creator, a brahmin. The head of Brahma 
28 W. D. O'Flaherty, Asceticism and Eroticism in the Mythology of Siva, pp. 1 78-79. 

T H E  S U PR E M E  B EGGAR · 2 89 
stuck to him, the skull did not leave his palin; brahmahatya, his sin, fol­
lowed him. The forest dwellers did not know that the young intruder 
into their settled ways of life was expiating his crime, was carrying out 
the Kapalika vow. As he went through the forest an antelope would 
raise its head, would rise on its hind legs toward the hand of the Great 
God. Off and on he would hold out to it some young leaves. This is 
how Indian sculptors and painters remembered and imaged Bhika­
tana, the Supreme Beggar.29 With tenderness they gave shape to the 
animal (mrga). At the beginning of things, it was the Father (Prajapati) 
who had taken the shape of an antelope. 
Rudra let his linga fall because the sages were hostile to it 
(KUP.2'37'39-40), to the organ of lust in its naked display. Where the 
forest dwellers had seen seduction at play they had taken part in the 
mystery of Rudra-Bhairava. Having severed the head of Brahma, he 
had risen above himself as Time and Death. It was a breakthrough 
from his manifestation in the created world into the Uncreate. In the 
Deodar forest, Rudra let fall, like a ripe fruit, the severed linga from 
his body. As the linga touched the ground, frightening portents an­
nounced its transfiguration. 
Bhairava and the linga are each the integral Siva, the one abiding 
beyond time in the timelessness of the Uncreate, the other traversing 
the cosmos. Though the forest dwellers had not recognized the Lord 
in his naked shape of Bhairava, they took part in the falling of the 
phallus and witnessed its transfiguration. They worshiped the Lord in 
the linga, and found peace. When the linga fell, Siva vanished (VmP, 
SM.22.67-68; KUP.2·37·4 1). 
Kalabhairava, Sankara, the bringer of peace, continued his pilgrim­
age; the women followed him. They sang and danced in front of the 
black-faced lord, Kalabhairava. Sankara then came to the abode of 
ViI)u (KUP.2'31 .77-79). 
In the Deodar forest, Kala Bhairava did not show the blackness of 
his countenance, though some could see the terrific teeth in the 
strange beggar's face (BP . 1 .2.27. 1 1 ). Lord Siva in the Deodar forest 
did not look the same to all who saw him, nor were his movements 
interpreted by them in the same way. He had come to the Deodar for­
est on his pilgrimage of expiation, true to his Kapalika vow. He had

come to impart the knowledge of withdrawal and peace (nivrtti; 
KUP.2.37.S). He showed himself in his nakedness; as he went along, 
he baffled, enraged, tested, and enlightened the sages when he al­
lowed himself to be maimed. This was part of his pilgrimage, and he 
continued his progress. 
To the forest dwellers who had not recognized the god, he ap­
peared gold-complexioned, most handsome (KuP. 2.37.6-7), or ugly 
and deformed (LP. 1 .2g.g). They also saw him having come by him­
self, or they beheld him accompanied by a beautiful woman, who was 
Vil)u in disguise (KiiP.2.37.9). The sons of the sages desired her 
(KUP.2.37.1S), but this, though it brought further confusion, did not 
change the course of events. The linga of Siva fell and Siva vanished 
(KUP.2.37'39-4 1 ). After terrible portents, the sages realized through 
Anusiiya, Atri's wife, that Siva had been there, and they sought advice 
from Brahma (KUP.2.37.42-4S). On Brahma's instruction, the wor­
ship of the Siva linga became established on earth (KUP.2'37.87-88). 
When the Lord appeared once more in the Deodar forest, accom­
panied by Parvati, the sages recognized and praised him, though he 
was smeared with ashes, his eyes were reddened, and he held a fire­
brand (KUP.2'37.99- lOS)' 
The appearance of Siva with Parvati in the Deodar forest, while it 
echoed, also climaxed the appearance of Siva with entrancing Mohini, 
Delusion, a form of Vil)u. The sages asked Siva how they should wor­
ship him, and the Lord told them to observe the Pasupata vow 
(KuP .2.37. 1 26-40). Then Siva and Parvati vanished, having assured 
the sages they would come to them if the sages meditated on them 
(KUP.2.37. 149). As the sages meditated, Parvati and then Siva alone 
were seen by them in glory (KUP.2'37. 1S3-S7). The sages, having 
taken the Pasupata vow (cf. AUp.67)' realized Siva as the only and 
eternal reality. All else was delusion. He had appeared with the fire­
brand that inflamed in them the fire of knowledge of the ultimate 
reality (cf. KUP.2.37. 100). This fire burns everything to ashes. Fire it­
self and the sense objects-the senses too-and the mind turn into 
ashes. 
This time the sages had seen the Lord smeared with ashes when he 
entered the Deodar forest. The very appearance of the Lord imbued 
them with the Pasupata doctrine. Before that, from his very entry into 
the Deodar forest, the sages had witnessed the Supreme Beggar car­
rying out the Kapalika vow. The worship of the linga as well as the 

T H E  S U PR E M E  B E GGAR · 29 1 
Kapalika and Pasupata mode of realizing Siva were established in the 
archetypal forest of Deodar trees, the vital center of the realization of 
the fire of god in which everything is burned to ashes, while the magic 
play (lila) of the Lord retains its validity. 
The Deodar forest was twice hallowed by the visit of the Supreme 
Beggar. By his first coming the worship of the linga became estab­
lished. It was in his second visit that the Pasupata vow was established 
among the sages. Siva himself had made it lead to release (vimukti) 
(K uP. 2.37. 140-43). 
The introduction of the Goddess, amplifying the effect of Siva's 
maya on the forest dwellers, lent more than an operatic grandeur to 
the Lord's play. The presence of the Goddess added overtones to the 
passing of Siva, the Supreme God, the naked beggar, through the 
Deodar forest. In a final vision granted to the sages (KUP.2'37. 1 53-
62), the Goddess, Siva's sakti or power, appeared in the sky, in a gar­
land of flames (K uP. 2.37. 1 54) preceding the manifestation of the lord 
of maya , Siva himself, with whom she is one (KUP.2.37. 1 61). 
The scene in the Deodar forest allowed for ambiguities and per­
plexities not only in the reactions of the sages, their wives, daughters, 
and sons but also in the minds of the myth makers. Some understood 
the visit of the strange mendicant as a rite of passage enacted by Siva 
Bhairava. Others saw Lord Siva entering the forest distraught after 
the death ofSatt (VmP.6.58; SkP .7.3.39.5- 1 2). They knew that she had 
consumed herself by means of yoga in flames of grief, because Siva, 
the Great God, her husband, had been excluded, on the ground that 
he was a Kapalin, by Daka, her father, from the sacrifice he was per­
forming (cf. VmP.4. 1-16). Siva, the Kapalin, the carrier of the skull 
bowl, is Siva Bhairava, the ultimate cause of the death of Sati. The 
forest of Deodar trees was witness to the maddening grief of Siva, as 
it had been the scene of his frenzy when he had cut off the head of 
Brahma. 
In another myth, Siva comes to the Deodar forest full of desire. 
Siva, not satisfied by making love to Parvatt, went naked and full of 
desire to the Deodar forest, there to make love with the wives of the 
sages (SP, DhS . lO.78-80). 
At all times, Siva showed himself to his bhakta or devotee in the 
shape and to the extent in which his worshiper was ready to sEe him. 
The Lord's play in the Deodar forest thus attracted to itself situations 
and modes of Siva's being that were peripheral to the plot of the play. 

292 
• B H A I R A  VA 
Similarly, but with an opposite effect, diverse forms of Siva would en­
ter, if by their name only, a narrative without any obvious connection 
of that name to the actuality of the story. When Mankal).aka, for ex­
ample, bowed down before Siva, he bowed down before Girisa, the 
Lord of the Mountain; Hara, the Ravisher; Tripurasiidana, the De­
stroyer of the Three Cities of the Asuras (KUP.2.34'58). None of these 
epithets had any direct bearing on the legend of Mankal).aka, yet they 
evoked the presence of Lord Siva in the vastness and power that 
Mankal).aka came to realize. Episodes were condensed into epithets 
denoting permanent aspects of deity. They referred to actions that 
happened once as significant events in which the permanent being of 
deity shone forth. Thus, these incidents became part of, defined, and 
accentuated the image of the god. 
The Deodar forest drew Siva to itself in the most intense moments 
of his manifestation, while roaming over the country frenzied with 
guilt, in the agony of mourning, and, as some say, maddened by sex. 
Within the sacred geography of India, the Deodar forest on its 
Himalayan slope was Siva's place of passage, whereas he never left 
Varal).asi once Brahma's skull had fallen from his hand. 
The play in the Deodar forest, in drawing to itself various events 
from the myth of Siva, had but little concern with their sequence. Siva 
had entered the Deodar forest as a Kapalin, the bearer of Brahma's 
skull, while expiating the sin ofbrahminicide. As a Kapalin, Siva Bhai­
rava, following his decapitation of Brahma, had come to the Deodar 
forest. There, Siva became castrated. 
In the Daka / Sati myth, however, Siva entered the Deodar forest 
after the death of Sati, which she inAicted on herself in consequence 
of Siva's exclusion from the sacrifice because he was a Kapalin. 
In the context of Parvati's estrangement, Siva entered the Deodar 
forest after his dissatisfaction with Parvati, his wife whom he had mar­
ried after Sati had died. Whatever were the reasons seen in Siva's visit 
to the Deodar forest, and whether the visit was interrupted and re­
newed (LP.1 .2g.7-24, 36-42; 1 .3 1 .20-37; KUP.2.37.2- 163), it was one 
and the same visit differently accounted for and variously celebrated. 
What happened in the Deodar forest happened once and for all. The 
linga of the god fell and was transfigured. The different preludes and 
circumstances of Siva's advent led to the same climax, and its after­
math was revealed in the mystery play in the Deodar forest. 

T H E  S U P R E M E  B E G G A R ' 2 93 
Sankara, the Bringer of Peace, left the Deodar forest with his beg­
ging bowl and, on his wanderings through the three worlds, where he 
visited the countries of gods and demons, came to the abode of ViġQu 
(KUP.2.3 1 .73-79). All the while Brahmahatya, the ghoulish figure of 
brahminicide personified, followed Bhairava. Nila-Lohita, as soon as 
he had asked Bhairava to observe the vow of expiation, had sent this 
fury, a figure of his guilt, to accompany Bhairava. She would not leave 
Bhairava until they came to Varal)asl. She was gruesome to look at 
(KuP .2.31 .68-70). 
Vivaksena, the gatekeeper of Viġl)u's residence and himself born 
from a portion of ViQu, not knowing the purpose of the visit, nor 
recognizing the Supreme Lord, Paramesvara, checked Bhairava, who 
held the kapiila and a trident in his hand (KuP.Z.3 1 .79-82). Bhairava 
sent forth a terrible attendant, who fought with Vivaksena, and the 
Great God, Mahadeva, pierced Viġvaksena with his trident. Carrying 
aloft on his trident the dead body of Vil)u's doorkeeper, Siva entered 
Vil)u's residence and faced the god who maintains the universe 
(KUP.2.31 .83-88). On seeing Siva holding out his bowl, the blessed 
Lord Vil)u asked Siva, the lord of the universe, why he went a-beg­
ging (SP.3.9.23). Then Vil)u opened a vein in his forehead. A stream 
of blood gushed forth into the skull; for a thousand years it kept on 
flowing (KuP. 2 .31.8g-g1). Even so, the skull bowl was not filled com­
pletely by Vil)u's offering (KUP.2.3 1 .g 1 ; MP. 183.90), nor could 
Vil)u persuade Brahmahatya to leave the trident bearer (KiiP. 
2.3 1 .g4-95). Vil)u repeated the advice given by Siva Nila-Lohita to 
Siva Bhairava: Bhairava should proceed to Varal)asl, the holy city, 
where Brahma's skull and the sin would fall from Bhairava 
(KUP.2·31 .g6). 
Siva Bhairava left the house of Vil)u; he went away intending to 
visit all the sites and shrines of deep mystery. Praising the Lord, the 
Pramathas, the "churn spirits," as always, accompanied the Great As­
cetic Siva Bhairava, as he danced on his way holding the trident with 
Vivaksena's body transfixed on it. Anxious to see the dance of the 
Lord, Vil)u rushed after him. Mahadeva, the Great God, infinite 
yoga itself, on seeing Vil)u, danced again and again. Accompanied 
by Vil)u, Brahmahatya, and his host of churn spirits, with his splen­
did bull Dharma as his vehicle, Bhairava approached Varal)asi. As the 
lord of gods entered the holy city, the miserable Brahwahatya with a 

2 94 • B HA I RA VA 
shriek went to hell. In Varal)aSI, Sankara placed the skull in front of 
his hosts, the gal)as, and returned Vivaksena, his life restored, to 
Vil)u (KUP.2.3 1 .96- 104). 
Bhairava, embodiment of the breakthrough into the Uncreate­
Bhairava, the symbol of the shattering of contingency-having left 
the forest accompanied by the frenzied women (KUP.2'31 .77-78), in 
the course of his pilgrimage came to the house ofVil)u, the sustainer. 
Vivaksena, the doorkeeper, who did not recognize Mahadeva and 
obstructed his entry into Vil)u's abode, for his lack of perceptiveness 
and for his dutiful obstruction found himself pierced on Siva's tri­
dent. Bhairava, balancing the corpse of Vivaksena on his long­
stemmed weapon, and holding out his left hand with the skull bowl, 
entered the building. Having learned Siva's reason for begging alms, 
Vil)u, the sustainer of the universe, made his blood spurt from his 
forehead into the skull bowl, without being able to fill it. 
Bhairava had to move on and continue his pilgrimage. Dancing in 
holy madness, he proceeded in the direction of Varal)asl. Vil)u could 
not resist rushing after the dancing god. There was no end to the 
dance of Siva, himself absorbed in endless yoga (KUP.2'3 1 .  100), until 
the Great God, Sankara, the bringer of peace, reached Varal)asl. The 
skull of the Creator, the blood of the sustainer of the universe, and 
the corpse of Vivaksena swayed in the hands of dancing Rudra, the 
Destroyer of all fetters, the liberator. 
In Varal)aSI, as Paramesvara Siva had decreed, the sin of brahma­
hatya left Bhairava. Ever since, whoever comes to Varal)asl with de­
votion is freed from sin, even that of brahminicide. The holy center 
where the skull of Brahma fell to the ground became known as Ka­
palamocana, "liberating from the skull." It was on the eighth day of 
the month of Margasiras, the "Head of the Antelope," that Siva ap­
peared in the shape of Bhairava (SP'3'9'54-56, 59-60, 63). 
The coming down to earth of Bhairava, the death of Death, to the 
holy city of Varal)aSI, the city of liberation, is told in the Pura1JG.S with 
slight variations. Vil)u, even before putting his question to Bhairava, 
had recognized Mahadeva, for he asked the Great God the reason for 
playing this role, and on hearing the reason he conceded to Bhairava, 
"you play as you please" (SkP .4. 1.31 .86). He saw through the play 
Mahadeva had staged for the sake of the sages and gods; he knew that 
he, the Supreme Spirit, took his forms at will, that it was the Lord's 

T H E  S U PR E M E  B EG G A R · 2 95 
playfulness to appear before him as he did. Siva's sight alone liberated 
(SkP -4- 1 ·3 1 ·9g-101). 
Siva danced as the skull fell from his hand (cf. SkP.5. 1.2.6g). 
Whether, as in one version, Siva danced on his way to the holy city as 
he had danced, in a different mode, in the Deodar forest, or whether 
he danced out of joy in VaraI).asi at the fall of the skull from his hand, 
it is said that Siva manifested as Bhairava on the eighth day of the 
dark half of Margasiras, the month called after the constellation 
Mrgasiras, the head of Prajapati. 
VaraI).asi is not the only sacred site where Bhairava was freed from 
the skull of Brahma, the kapala; but no other final station of Bhai­
rava's pilgrimage was equal in sacredness to VaraI).asi, nor had as 
mighty a myth. The legend of the sanctuary of Kapaldvara, the lord 
of the skull tells of a sacrifice in heaven held by Brahma and Gayatri. 
A fierce, naked, abject-looking man came, skull bowl in hand, and 
said, "give me food," The participants in the sacrifice wanted to drive 
away the sinful, naked Kapalin, bearing a skull, unfit for sacrificial 
rites. The awful-looking beggar said that on hearing of Brahma's sac­
rifice, he had come from afar. He was hungry. Why did they revile 
him? The brahmins insisted that he leave quickly, for their sacrificial 
hall was not a place for one emaciated by hunger. When the intruder 
heard this, he threw the skull on the floor. The brahmins asked him 
to throw it out. As the beggar did not stir, the brahmins asked some­
one to remove the skull with a stick. This was done-and immediately 
another skull appeared on the spot. When that skull was thrown out, 
yet another cropped up, and so it went on for a hundred thousand 
years. Hosts of skulls appeared and polluted the sacrifice. Finally, 
Brahma asked the intruder why he spoiled the sacrifice. Siva then said 
to Brahma: "you know that not the same offerings are made to me as 
to the other gods. I get a special portion." Brahma assured Siva that 
in the future no sacrifice would be complete without taking Siva into 
account. There would always be a special chant for him. He would 
stand near the gate, skull in hand, and would be known as Kapale­
svara, lord of the skull. Siva then destroyed all the skulls (el'. 
SkP.6. 1 . 1 82 . 1 -41). 
In this skull fantasy, replacing the one skull that clung to Siva's 
hand by a series of self-renewing skulls, Bhikatana, the Supreme 
Mendicant, appeared as a hungry, naked beggar; some, however, say 

296 · B H A I RA V A  
he was dressed in tattered rags, dirty and dusty (SkP.7. 1 . 103.3). The 
humiliated and subsequently accepted intruder was Rudra, the 
stranger who appeared darkly clad at the Vedic sacrifice (Ch. 1 11.2) 
before Brahma had been heard of in Indian myth. 
Brahma, it is told elsewhere, had provoked his decapitation when 
Rudra, his newborn son, sat on his shoulder and the fifth head of 
Brahma prognostically chanted the Atharoa1)a mantra. "0 Kapalin, 0 
Rudra, . . .  protect the world . . . .  " Subsequently, Rudra cut off his 
father's head (VrP.g7'3-7). He became a Kapalin and observed the 
Kapalika vow (VrP.g7. 1O- 1 1), enjoined for murderers of brahmins 
(M. I I .73).30 The fulfillment of the vow took him to Varal)asl 
(KiiP.2.31 .96, 101). On his wanderings over the earth, Rudra divided 
the head of Brahma, keeping one piece of the skull in hand and put­
ting the other pieces in his own hair, made himself a sacred thread 
out of its hair, and made the beads of his rosary and garlands out of 
the "big" bone (VrP.g7. 1 1- 1 4). A skull grins from the parting of the 
hair of an uncannily lovely BhikiaŽana bronze image of the eleventh 
century.31 
In this version, not only did Siva carry the head of Brahma resting 
in his hand and hair, but he was seen wearing a garland of heads, 
thousands of heads, thousands of them Brahma heads (cf. 
SkP.7. 1 .9.S, 6), and he loved the place where corpses are burned 
(KSS .2.8- IS). On such recreation grounds, also, Siva danced. To him 
who had overcome death, its shapes-the skulls and bones-were but 
ornaments swaying with his dancing body. 
The macabre exuberance of Siva's death ornaments was but a se­
quel to Siva's orgiastic entry into Viil)u's house. With Brahma's, the 
Creator's, skull stuck to one hand, Bhairava speared ViŬvaksena, the 
dutiful if not perceptive gatekeeper. Flaunting the corpse of Viiva­
ksena on his trident, the Wild God stepped across the threshold and 
faced god Viil)u, the Preserver of the universe. Lord Viil)u, despite 
the intrusion of Siva into his house and the presence of the corpse of 
his gatekeeper held aloft on Siva's trident, offered his own blood into 
the kapiila in Siva's hand. He let it spurt from his forehead 
(KiiP.2.31 .89-go), or from his right hand, which he held out to his 
guest (pP .5. 14. 14-15) so that his blood might fill the empty skull bowl.

I t  has never yet been filled. Siva's fire eye again and again consumed 
what was offered into the skull that stuck to his palm.32 Siva himself 
once said of the kapiila that this world, resembling a skull, rested in his 
hand (KSS. 2 .  15).33 
Siva, the Destroyer, having forcibly entered the house of Viit:Iu, the 
Preserver, was given a guest offering such as only the Sustainer of the 
World could offer him. Viit:Iu gave Bhairava his own life blood and, 
in ecstasy, he followed Bhairava, who danced his way to Varat:Iasl. 
God Viit:Iu himself, like the women of the sages in the forest who had 
followed the naked mendicant, left his home to be near the dancing 
beggar. God Viit:Iu, as Siva was departing, joined the wild, ghastly cor­
tege of the skull-bearer wielding his trident with the corpse of ViglU's 
gatekeeper impaled on it. The dead body of him who was to have 
guarded the house of Vi1;it:Iu decorated Siva's trident and swayed in 
the joyous dance of the Lord. The horrible Brahmahatya followed the 
God all the while on the way to Varat:Iasl. 
Carrying the skull of Brahma and the corpse of Viivaksena, Bhai­
rava danced, a moving figure of Consciousness that had transcended, 
while in its fullness it comprised all conditions in which God manifests 
to the eye of mortals. Having severed the head of the Creator and 
killed the guardian of the house of the Sustainer of creation, Bhairava 
had cut through all fetters. Horrendous, abject, naked, or in rags that 
emphasized his nakedness, self-contradictory and consistent with his 
unspeakable being, with an entrancing smile on his lips he bared his 
fangs. The images of the Lord show him young and in glory as Bhi­
k1;iatanamurti, the Supreme Beggar. They show him as KaiIkala­
murti, carrying the impaled body of Viivaksena; or emaciated and 
deathlike in his image as Bhairava; or stern, bloated, his matted hair 
surrounded by flames, fiercely ponderous, and black as Kala and Ma­
hakala. No contradictions were adequate and no single iconographic 
likeness sufficed to render the total, tremendous mystery of Bhairava. 
The furthest outreach of contradictory qualities was gathered in the 
intensity of the myth, and split in the variety of images in bronze and 
stone. They adumbrate the breakthrough from time into eternity, 
from Kala to Mahakala, from creation back into the Uncreate. 
The head of Brahma was cut off by Siva Bhairava. The gatekeeper

at the threshold of ViiI).u's house was pierced to death by the trident 
of Siva Bhairava. He entered the house of ViiI).u, the Preserver of the 
World, and left, at ViiI).u's advice, for V.-mlI).asl. Unable to resist, 
ViiI).u left his house to follow the dancing god on the way to VaraI).asl, 
where sin, guilt, and the skull of Brahma fell from Siva. The skull 
broke into a thousand pieces (MP.183.99-100); with a shriek Brah­
mahatya sank into the netherworld. When the frenzy of the ecstatic 
pilgrimage of Bhairava on earth came to its end, the god was then and 
there released from all fetters of his own making (cf. VmP .3.42-44). 
After he had taken his bath in a wonderful pond, full of lotuses, the 
pond became known as Kapalamocana, "releasing of the skull" 
(VmP ,3.47-51 ). 
Having been freed from the cut-off head of Brahma, Siva returned 
into transcendency whence the Wild Hunter from out of nowhere 
had appeared in the primordial scene. 
At Kapalamocana, Siva was freed from his sin of having cut off the 
head of Brahma. The site forever remains the most holy abode of 
Lord Siva on earth. It was called A vimukta, the region never forsaken 
by the Great God (MP. 1 8 1 . 1 3-15; 1 83.99; 184.25-28). In his terrible 
shape, motionless and stable like a pillar, Lord Siva stays there until 
the dissolution of the world (MP . 1 82'3-4). His abode is invisible to or­
dinary man, in space (antariÑa) above the cremation ground; only 
yogis, brahmaciirins, and those who know the Veda can see it (MP. 1 82.5-
8). Those who go to Avimukta obtain not only freedom from sin but 
also freedom from the cycle of births and deaths; they obtain final 
release and union with Siva (MP. 182.1 1-27). The Great God resides 
in Avimukta with all his attendants. Some have faces like infuriated 
lions and wolves, others are hunchbacked, some are dwarfs, others 
are contorted; armed giants guard the sacred grove of Avimukta 
(MP . 183·63-67)· 
The motley crowd of the freakish retinue of Siva is part of his am­
bience. Indefinitely variable in its monstrosity, wit, and vitality, it in­
cludes the misshapen as possibilities within his orbit. Rudra refused to 
create mortals because they were imperfect. The retinue of Siva, bhu­
tas, ga'[las, pramathas, piiri$adas, kumbhiiruJas, riiÑasas, and pi.5iicas-dif­
ferent types of spirits, sprites, ghosts, and ghouls-do not belong to 
the pitiable class of mortals; they are part of Rudra's being, tremors, 
resonances of his nature, byproducts of tensions that sustain his con-

T H E  S U P RE M E  B E G G A R · 2 99 
tradictory wholeness. They are scintillations of the Rudras, smither­
eens of the terrifying glory of Rudra-Siva himself. 
His abode was the burning ground, which was "covered with hair 
and bones, full of skulls and heads, thick with vultures and jackals, 
covered with a hundred funeral pyres, an unclean place covered with 
flesh, a mire of marrow and blood, scattered piles of flesh, resounding 
with the cries of jackals" (MBh . 1 3. 1 28. 1 3-1S). Indeed, in his wander­
ings all over the earth, the Great God had always been in search of a 
hallowed spot. "There is nothing purer than a cremation ground," 
Siva declared (MBh. 1 3. 1 28. 16). The hosts of ghostly beings that are 
his companions loved to dwell there, and Siva did not like to stay any­
where without them (MBh . 1 3 . 1 28. 1 8). 
Revulsion as a means of detachment had its form in the imagery of 
the cremation ground. It dwelt not on the cessation of life and the 
purgation of the mortal body through the consuming fire, but on the 
byproducts of physical disintegration. Though gruesome, they were 
less terrifying than disgusting. 
Revulsion in its last degree of sublimation reaches up to holiness. 
As part of the divine play of the Great God, it hovers above the cre­
mation ground, shedding its odor in the ethereal purity of the 
antariÑa. 
The burning ground offers its extreme situation after the end of 
the life of the body, full of debris in which the ghouls delight, the 
ghouls whose company Siva never liked to be without. The residence 
of Siva, above the burning ground in A vimukta, is never without Siva, 
as the word Avimukta implies. The forest of Deodar trees, on the 
other hand, was but a plac of passage for Siva on his wanderings. It 
was the place of the critical moment, after Siva had decapitated his 
father the Creator, or after he lost his wife Sati by her self-immola­
tion. The Deodar forest was the place of the highest pitch of the god's 
passion. He danced, laughed, acted like a madman, and was inwardly 
calm when his linga fell. 
In his divine play, Rudra-Siva, the Wild God, assumed many guises 
or shapes, but he did not wear a mask. As Bhairava, his fearful coun­
tenance revealed his fangs and revoked the smile that came to the lips 
of the Great God every so often when he addressed himself to the 
gods. His laughter resounded from the measureless flaming linga that 
traversed a cosmic night.

The macabre setting of the burning ground was the locale of the 
detachment of Lord Siva. The smile and laughter of the god, which 
he released on so many occasions, were similarly expressions of his 
aloofness from whatever situation he summoned. They conveyed the 
surpassing joy that set his play going-in heaven, on earth, and in the 
nether world. It was staged from Siva's abode in the space of the cre­
mation ground, "for who could live, who could breathe, if there were 
not this bliss in the space?" (TUP.2.7).34

THE FAM ILY OF SIVA 
A. THE LINEAGE OF DAKSA, THE PROGENITOR 
1. LIFE AND DEATH OF SATI 
a. The Spring of Love 
The Perfect Age, the Krta Yuga, had passed. It was perfect inasmuch 
as it contained the abiding themes on which the myth of Mahadeva, 
the Great God, was built. They were to sustain and determine the on­
going structure of his presence. The Krta Yuga, however, was less 
than perfect if it were to be assessed in human terms. It began with 
the fall, the fall of the seed of the Creator, the fall from the Uncreate 
into creation. 
At the beginning of the next, even less perfect age, the Treta Yuga, 
the sixty daughters of Dakia were born (SP.2.2.6.55; 14.4),1 of whom 
Sati was the first (VtiP.30.40-41 ). It is also said that Sati / Siva was the 
middle or the last-born (SP.2.2. 14.9). The latter alternatives have lit­
tle to commend themselves, for the race of women had not been cre­
ated prior to Sati's incarnation. But myth has its own inconsistencies 
or differing versions. The general view that Sati should be born from 
Dakia and one of his wives runs' counter to another statement made 
in the HarivarrtSa that after creating all moving and unmoving crea­
tures, both bipeds and quadrupeds, by his mind, Dakia then created 
women, whom he gave to various gods; hence arose reproduction 
through couples (H.2.46-49). Dakia's first birth was in the distant 
past, at the beginning of things, when he was born from Aditi, and 
1 The number of Dakݧa's daughters is said to have been twenty-four (VP. 1 .7.22) or 
sixty (VP. 1 . 1 5. 103) or fifty (VP. 1 . 1 5.77-78). 

3 02 · FA M I L Y  O F  S I V A 
Aditi was born from Dakia (RV. 1O.72.4). The birth of Dakia from 
Aditi is on the same level as Agni, the bull-cow, that is, at the furthest 
reach of metaphor (cf. RV. 1O.S.7, Ch. 1.4). Dakia had traveled far 
through the aeons, from his birth from Aditi, to his becoming 
Brahma's son,2 and father of Sati. 
Twenty-seven of his daughters he gave to the moon in marriage 
(SP.2.2.6'S6). They were the Nakiatras, the twenty-seven lunar man­
sions. Satl, however, was to become the bride of Siva (VliP.30.41). 
With that purpose, the Great Goddess out of her own will assumed 
human shape and was born from VlriI;ll, Dakia's wife (SP.2.2. 1 4. 1 2-
14, 24)· 
Brahma had prayed to the Great Goddess to fascinate Siva, for he 
did not think that Siva, the yogi, detached from the world, would on 
his own account take to himself a goddess as his wife. If he, the cause 
of the universe, remained detached, creation would not come about. 
The Great Goddess would have to enthrall the great ascetic to fulfill 
Brahma's plan (SP.2.2. 1 1 . 1 8-28). The cosmic goddess appeared as 
Yoganidra, "slumbering wakefulness" (SP.2.2. 1 1 .6). She glistened 
like collyrium (SP .2.2.1 1 .7) as she assured Brahma of her endeavor to 
delude Siva so that he would take a bride (SP.2.2. 1 1 .4S-46). Dakia, 
having performed austerities for three thousand years with great de­
votion to Siva, saw the dark, primordial goddess before him. She was 
the Great Goddess in her cosmic form; as the power of the Great God­
dess, she had emanated from her. She appeared to Dakia in her dark 
cosmic form sparkling with Ardhanarlsvara's fire. Its superluminous 
radiance scintillated out of her darkness. In this form she was Kalika, 
the Dark, the primordial, cosmic goddess. Dakia, in a prognostic vi­
sion of her iconic shape, conceived of her seated on a lion; she held a 
blue lotus and a sword in two of her four hands. At Brahma's bidding, 
Dakia worshiped her who had not as yet been embodied in corporeal 
shape. He prayed to her that she be born as his daughter, to fascinate 
and enthrall Siva. She alone had this power. Kalika granted the boon 
that Dakia asked of her. As Siva had been born as Brahma's son, so 
Siva would be born as Dakia's daughter. By this divine play of hers, 
the Great Goddess would fulfill the purpose of the entire world. The 
Great Goddess in her cosmic form agreed to be Siva's beloved in every 
incarnation (SP .2.2 . 1 2.6-29).

Brahma had a willing Great Goddess to cooperate with him in his 
plot of enticing Siva, the great ascetic, to take a wife. Since she had left 
the form of Ardhanarisvara and had chosen to be born as DakÆa's 
daughter, assuming human appearance and becoming Siva's bride 
was her way of returning to Siva. Darkly glittering, the Great Goddess 
had already left bipartite wholeness for the world of duality, the 
realm of Kalika, the cosmic power of the Great Goddess. Willing to be 
born as DakÆa's daughter and to fascinate Siva, Kalika listened to 
DakÆa's prayer. DakÆa knew that no other woman would be compe­
tent to enthrall Siva. Toward this tremendous task the goddess Ka­
lika-whose other names are CaୈH;lika, the Fierce, and Durga, the Dif­
ficult to Reach (SP.2.2. 1 1 .3, 6)-was ready to become Dak$a's 
daughter, but first she made one condition: if ever in future DakÆa 
should show her less respect, she would cast off her body and with­
draw into her inmost self, or take up another shape (SP .2.2. 1 2.33-34). 
Dak$a named his daughter Uma (SP.2.2.14.49), a name rich in pos­
sible meanings. It could have alluded to the night-splendor of her 
beauty, or it could have singled her out as the "Mother of the Uni­
verse," by which appellation DakÆa paid homage to Sati (SP.2.2. 14.27-
28). As the Mother of the Universe she would have been in line with 
Umu, the Sumerian "Mother"3 and with Ommo, the name of the 
Goddess, the consort of Siva, inscribed on a coin of HuviÆka, the Ku­
\iaI:\a king.4 The Goddess appears in the Taittiriya Ara'!tyaka (TA. 1O.1 2  
and SayaDa on same). Under the name Uma she explains to Indra the 
identity of the Supreme Brahman, which had eluded the other gods 
(KUp·3· 1 2  and 4. 1 ). 
Brahma's plan to see the Great Goddess, Kalika, the Mother of the 
Universe, take birth as DakÆa's daughter for the purpose of entranc­
ing Siva was only part of a total design for diverting Siva, the Lord of 
Yoga, from his true nature-asceticism-and making him subservient 
to the Creator's purpose, the creation of mortals. Sati's task in the se­
duction of Siva was part of a twofold plan devised by Brahma. Sati 
knew that only by asceticism co'uld she draw the great ascetic toward 
herself. While Brahma had no need to intensify her asceticism, he ex­
erted himself in rendering Siva susceptible to her incomparable 
beauty. Brahma's design for the temptation of Siva was complex and 
deep-rooted. It had more than one cause.

Brahma still smarted from the loss of his head. It had been pre­
ceded by the loss of his mind when he, full of lust, had stared at his 
daughter Sandhya (also called Savitrl, Ch. IX. l ). His infatuation on 
that occasion had spread to his sons, including Dakia. Brahma and his 
sons were helpless, for they were hit by the arrows of a wonderfully 
handsome being who appeared as Brahma's creation, just as Brahma 
stared at Sandhya. That wonderful being, born with a bow and five 
flower arrows, was Kama. He started his work even while Brahma as­
signed to him his task: to fascinate men and women and carry on the 
aeviternal work of procreation. Even the gods Brahma, ViiI}u, and 
Siva would be in his power (SP.2.2.2.22-39). Hit by Kama's arrows, 
Brahma was seen in this state by Siva, who saw everything from high 
in the air. Siva laughed and mocked Brahma (SP.2.2.3.36-45). 
Shamed and angry, Brahma cursed Kama, who had brought about 
his ludicrous plight, and included in his curse Siva, who had ridiculed 
him: Kama was cursed to be burned by the fire of Siva's eye after 
doing the same thing to him (SP.2.2.3.61-64). 
Brahma shed drops of sweat. From them the pitrs, "the Fathers" 
were born. They had for their mother Sandhya, after whom Brahma 
had lusted (SP.2.2.3.48, 58-59). Dakia, in a similar though lesser 
plight, had also perspired and from his sweat Rati, the goddess Lust, 
was born (SP.2.2.3.5 1-53). She was to become the wife of Kama 
(SP.2.2.4.4-6). Brahma particularly resented having been seen by Siva 
in a scene analogous to the primordial one in which Rudra, the Wild 
Hunter, far from being an amused spectator, had aggressively taken 
a vitally fateful part. Now, howe૿er, it was Kama's arrow, not Siva's, 
that hit Brahma. Brahma cursed Kama, but he also meant to confront 
the two archers, Kama and Siva: Brahma wanted Siva to succumb to 
Desire, whereas Kama would be burned to ashes by the fire shooting 
from Siva's eye (MP.4. 1 2; SP.2.2.3.64). Brahma's curse was directed 
as much against Siva as it was against Kama; the double target, more­
over, revealed also Brahma's duplicity in regard to Siva. He wanted 
Siva to be struck by the arrow of Desire in order to avenge Rudra's 
primordial attack on Prajapati engaged in intercourse. Interlocked 
with Brahma's vengefulness was his wish to turn Siva away from his 
asceticism and to inflame him by the same erotic passion that had led 
to Brahma's disgrace. The motives of Brahma, far from pure, rein­
forced one another. His vindictiveness against Siva sharpened the 
curse against Kama, made it all the more effective, because Brahma 

L I F E  A N D  D E AT H  O F  SAT i · 30 5 
wanted to avenge himself on Kama and he wanted Siva to succumb to 
Kama for the sake of creation, which Brahma alone was unable to ac­
complish. Brahma's revenge was directed primarily against Siva, who 
had wanted to prevent creation, having primordially assaulted Praja­
pati and interrupted him in the act of procreation, and who had 
mocked Brahma in his erotic excitement. 
On hearing Brahma's curse, Kama shuddered with fear. He cried 
out in dismay, entreating Brahma to save him from the effect of the 
curse. Kama was not to blame for having aimed at Brahma: he had 
only carried out Brahma's command not to spare anyone, not even 
Brahma. Moved, Brahma modified his curse, though he maintained 
that Siva's glance would reduce Kama to ashes and he would become 
bodiless. But this curse would end; Kama's body would be restored 
when Siva took a wife (SP.2.2.3.68-76). Then Brahma would be 
happy (SP.2.2.8. 15). 
Brahma's plot approached Siva in two stages. Sati was to attract Siva 
by her asceticism and captivate him by her loveliness. Then Kama was 
to wound and inflame Siva. Seeking release from Brahma's curse, 
Kama helped Brahma in his strategy. He left Brahma's presence in 
sorrow for having been cursed, but glad that the curse had been mod­
ified and that his body would be restored to him (MP .4.2 1 ;  
SP.2.2·3·78). 
When the Great Goddess had descended into Viril)ls womb, 
though she was conceived like any child, DakÆa, her father, recog­
nized his daughter as the Great Goddess and worshiped her. From 
her early childhood, when playing with other children, she drew pic­
tures of Siva, her songs were about Siva, her mind was directed to­
ward Siva, and when Brahma came" on a visit and told her to marry 
Siva, she was not surprised. Worshiping Siva day by day, Sati grew up 
subjecting herself to increasingly arduous austerities with Siva as her 
goal. Her desire for him grew daily, and she meditated on Siva with 
concentrated devotion (SP.2.2. 14P 3-27, 55-57; 1 5. 1-28). Her auster­
ities strengthened her desire. 
Meanwhile the gods and sages went to Kailasa where they praised 
Siva, the Lord of Yoga, who is neither god nor demon, neither man 
nor beast, neither male, female, nor eunuch. What remains after all 
negations-that is Siva (SP.2.2. 15.33, 6 1 -62). Brahma urged Siva to 
take a wife, as all the other gods had done. Siva repJied that it would 
be improper for him to marry because he was detached from the 

306 ' F A M I LY O F  S I V A  
world and always practiced yoga. What use had he for a loving wife? 
Further, he was always dirty and inauspicious, completely absorbed in 
the realization of the absolute; marriage was a bondage and did not 
interest him (SP.2.2. 16.26-27, 3 1 -34). But, for the sake of his devo­
tees, he would marry. The woman would have to be of a very special 
kind, beautiful and practicing yoga. "She must be a Yogini when I 
practice Yoga and a loving woman when I indulge in love" 
(SP.2.2. 16.36-3g).5 When Siva would be absorbed in his imperishable 
nature, in utter transcendency, wretched be anyone who would dis­
turb him. There was another condition on which Siva insisted: should 
she ever doubt his words, he would abandon her (SP.2.2. 16.40-44). 
Brahma then spoke to Siva of Sati, practicing austerities in order to 
win Siva as her husband. Siva in his mercy should grant her the de­
sired boon and should marry her lovingly. Smiling, Lord Siva agreed 
(SP.2.2. 16.46-5 1 , 57)· 
Sati was devoted to Siva. She practiced yoga, not in order to gain 
release but to ready herself for Siva and at the same time draw him to 
herself. She did not know that Siva, the Lord of Yoga, persuaded by 
Brahma, had resolved to make her his wife for the sake of his devo­
tees and creation. Siva let the yoga power of Sati, the magic of her 
concentrated will, and his own compassion for his devotees do their 
work. 
Sati was absorbed in meditation when Siva became visible to her: 
handsome, radiant, five-faced and three-eyed, four-armed, the cres­
cent moon on his forehead, his throat blue. The celestial Ganga 
adorned his head (SP.2.2. ! 7.3-5). Continuing her meditation, she 
bent her head in worship. Siva wanted to give her the fruit of her aus­
terities, and he wanted to hear her voice. He asked her to choose 
whatever boon she desired. She could not speak, shy with love for 
Siva; and when at last she asked for the boon, she could not complete 
the sentence. As she prayed that Siva, the giver of boons, the bride­
groom of her desire, would fulfill her desire-:-Siva completed her 
thought and asked her to be his wife. Silent, in dark, glowing beauty 
she stood before his crystal clarity. When she found words, she joy­
ously requested the Lord of the universe to take her with due marital 
rites in the presence of her parents, and Siva consented (SP.2.2. 1 7·7-
23)·

Love had entered their hearts. Siva responded to Sati erotically, a 
form of love that hitherto his anthropomorphic shape had not expe­
rienced, while in his symbol shape, the linga, the erotic fire flamed up­
ward all the while. He was thought of as acting in the shape of man. 
Love of more than one kind dwelled in Siva-the benign, as his name 
implies, though even Vedic Rudra, the Wild God, was invoked for his 
benevolence (RV. 1 . 1 14.3; 1 . 1 2 2. 1 ;  2.33. 14; 5.4 1.2; 5.5 1 . 1 3), his ex­
ceeding benevolence (cf. TS.4.5. 1 . 1), and for healing (TS -4-5. 1 . 1 ). Out 
of love for his devotees, he saved from death Sveta and MarkaQQeya. 
Out of love for his devotees, Siva projected his maya and acted as the 
protagonist in the play that touched the hearts of the people and 
showed them the Great Yogi assuming the part of the lover. 
Out of compassion, for the sake of the gods and his devotees, the 
Great God showed himself to the Goddess in his supernatural shape. 
He agreed to take in marriage, according to custom established 
among mortals, the Goddess embodied in human shape. 
Henceforth Siva and Sati will appear to act like mortals; in this 
manner, the play (lila) of the Great God will be understood by mor­
tals. While playing his divine play and entering into its mood, the 
Great God, who conjures up this play, remains aloof in his transcen­
dental reality. It shimmers through his maya, the magic veil of his 
presence. 
Sati returned to her parents' house and Siva went to his Himalayan 
hermitage, his meditation disturbed by his longing for Sati. Still, 
Kama was given no chance to attack Siva. Excited like any mortal in 
love, Siva had abandoned his meditation on the Supreme Self, which 
he was, and thought of Sati. 
Siva had readily accepted Brahma's plan, but he had made certain 
conditions. His stipulation that his future wife should be a yogini, if 
he was ever to marry, was in tune with his own nature. His stipulation 
that she should be a loving woman when he indulged in love was not 
in character with Siva the ascetic. But the ascetic god meant to act in 
conformity with Brahma's plan. Thinking further about his future 
wife, he anticipated the possibility of her interfering with his utter ab­
sorption in himself, with his transcendency. In that case he would 
Curse her. The prospect of marriage, to which Siva had readily 
agreed, did not really appeal to Lord Siva. He even thought of the 
possibility of leaving Sati should she not fully believe in him. In short, 
Siva did not unconditionally accept Brahma's plan. But he had begun 

30 8 · F A M I L Y  O F  S I VA 
to be stirred by Sati. Also, he thought of marrying her for the sake of 
his devotees. He felt disturbed. 
Sati, on the other hand, wholly devoted to Siva, had neither ques­
tions nor premonitions. It had been withheld from her that DakÆa 
had been compelled by Brahma to give his daughter in marriage to 
Siva. 
Brahma made DakÆa agree to an early wedding of Siva and Sati 
(SP.2.2 . 1 7.30-36, 68-69). Then, the preparations for the wedding 
completed, Siva started in the month of Caitra from his hermitage on 
Kailasa. Brahma, ViÆl)u, and all the gods and sages accompanied Siva 
to DakÆa's house. The hides of elephant, tiger, and serpents, the 
crescent moon, and the ascetic's matted hair, by Siva's will, became his 
wedding ornaments (SP.2.2. 1 8.20-24). DakÆa welcomed Siva wor­
shipfully and announced the marriage agreement to his guests 
(SP. 2.2. 1 8.30). Brahma was chosen to perform the marriage rites 
(SP.2.2. 1 8.31). When the stars were in auspicious conjunction with 
the planets, DakÆa happily gave his own daughter Sati to Siva 
(SP. 2.2. 1 8. 33). ViÆl)u praised Siva as the Father and Sati as the 
Mother of the World. He praised them for having entered the world 
for their own pleasure, for the safety of the good and the suppression 
of evil. Thus, standing close to the Lord who shone with the col­
lyrium-dark luster of the goddess, ViÆl)u counseled Siva to kill any 
man who would lust after Sati. Siva laughed but promised to act ac­
cordingly. ViÆl)u then left the wedding, and Brahma performed the 
sacrificial rites (SP.2.2. 19.3-1O). 
The descent of the power (sakti) of the Great Goddess into the cos­
mos, as Kalika, the Mother of the Universe, and her resolve to act as 
a mortal on becoming Sati, a real woman, were fraught with appre­
hension and forebodings. Kalika, the Mother of the Universe, grant­
ing to DakÆa the boon of becoming his daughter, uttered a solemn 
warning: she would cast off her body were DakÆa in the future, after 
becoming her father, less respectful toward her than when he asked 
her the boon of becoming his daughter (SP.2.2 . 1 2'34). Even as the 
Cosmic Goddess Kalika was uncertain about DakÆa's future relation to 
Sati, so also was Siva uncertain about the steadiness of Sati's feelings 
toward himself. Were she ever to show disbelief in his word, he would 
abandon her (SP.2.2.16.44). To these prognostic fears of Siva and Ka­
lib, ViÆl)u added a further apprehension through his advice: should 
any man lust after Sati, Siva should kill him (SP.2.2.1g.7). 

L I F E  A N D  DEATH O F  S AT ! ' 30 9 
The time had now come in the marriage ritual for the bridal pair to 
walk around the sacred fire, which Brahma as the chief priest was 
tending. He saw Sati's bare feet protrude below her garment, and was 
smitten with lust. He stared at her. Anxious to see her face covered by 
her veil, he put wet branches on the fire to make it smoke, and as Siva 
covered his eyes smarting from the smoke, Brahma lifted Sati's veil 
and looked at her face again and again with growing exCitement. He 
covered up the four drops of semen that he let fall to the ground. 
Siva, though blinded by smoke, saw it all and raised his trident to kill 
Brahma, but ViťQu, who had anticipated the episode, intervened, 
pleading that he, Brahma, and Siva were but manifestations of Siva in 
transcendency, from whom they and all else had emanated. Siva, 
knowing this to be the truth, desisted from killing Brahma 
(SP.2.2. 1 g. 1 7-76). 
Brahma's incontinence at the wedding of Siva and Sati was a gro­
tesque replica of the Father / Prajapati's primordial transgression. 
This archetypal exploit already had one replica, in the myth of 
Brahma lusting after Sandhya. There, it cost him his head. Here it 
was a shameful incident that Siva could afford to overlook, as a pec­
cadillo of the Creator deluded by Siva's maya. Siva was in a generous 
and playful mood. He urged Brahma not to be afraid, and requested 
him to touch his own, Brahma's, head with his hand. Brahma obeyed 
and obtained the form of Siva's vehicle, the bull. Brahma, having thus 
become Siva's vehicle, was told he would be born as a man with a bull's 
head and would roam over the earth. Any man who, lusting after an­
other man's wife, would hear Brahma's story would be free from that 
sin, whereas Brahma would be laughed at. To be held in ridicule by 
people was to be Brahma's abasement. At the same time, as many a 
man was sure to find himself in this position, Brahma's sin would 
gradually decrease, and he would become pure (SP.2.2.20.7-20). 
Ribald, absurd, and amusing, this vignette added to the wedding of 
Siva and Sati was part of the play of the Lord to assure his devotees of 
his mercy and humor. The four; drops of semen shed by Brahma, 
however, did not bring about any progeny; on the contrary, they 
swelled and became the four great clouds-'-Sarpvartaka, Avarta, Puť­
kara, and DroQa-that bring about the dissolution of the universe 
(SP.2.2.20.2 1-24), when Siva will dance the cosmos out of existence. 
Brahma's untimely propensity turned into a harbinger of destruction. 
Brahma concluded the wedding rite. Siva and Sati mounted his ve-

3 1 0 ' FA M I LY O F  S I VA 
hicle, the bull, and followed by his gaQas, rode to Kailasa. Dakia ac­
companied Siva half way, happy with Siva's love (SP.2.2.20-47-S I ). It 
was, according to the Siva Purii1)O" under the rule of Svayambhuva 
Manu that the marriage of Siva and Sati took place (SP.2.2.20.S8). 
When Siva reached his home, the snow-clad mountains, the Hima­
laya, the gods and sages took leave of him (SP.2.2.20.S3-SS). Siva dis­
charged his gaQas, Nandin, and all others from his mountain cave. He 
was alone with Sati, played with her, caressed and teased her; they 
sported in verdant groves and dark caves. Then, climbing Himalayan 
ridges, Siva remembered Kama of his own accord (SP.2.2.2 1 .8-28). 
When Kama arrived, Spring spread his splendors: trees blossomed 
and the waters were full of lotus flowers (SP.2.2.2 1 .29-30). Entranced 
by Sati, Siva made love with her; it was as though she entered his body 
(SP.2.2. 2 1 .42). Holding her in close embrace or, full of fun, wreath­
ing flower garlands around her, as well as conversing with her, he 
gave her knowledge of the Self, of the principle of life, and of the Su­
preme Spirit (SP.2.2.2 1 .43-44). In this way Mahadeva, the Great God, 
the naked yogi, revealed himself to her. Enthralled by her, Siva 
sported with Sati, the Great Goddess, day after day for twenty-five 
years according to the reckoning of the gods (SP.2. 2.2 1 .47). Siva, the 
protagonist of his divine play, abandoned himself to his new role to 
the point where it appeared to him as his own reality. 
Sati knew that her austerities had been performed to win the Lord 
of Yoga as her husband. His love would not be like that of any god or 
mortal. She won him in the only way he could be won, by yoga, and 
now he loved her in a way that only the Lord of Yoga could achieve. 
He held his semen within his body, and while his fervor never de­
creased, the Great Yogi remained collected within himself. Moreover, 
Siva had set forth the condition that his beautiful bride must be a yo­
gini when he practiced yoga and a loving woman when he was intent 
on love (SP. 2.2. 16.39). But he indulged in love as a yogi, with his seed 
drawn up, experiencing erotic pleasure while restraining his body, his 
consciousness calm. He was always engaged in yoga (SP.2.2. 1 6.30). It 
was the basic modality of his being and metaphor of his transcend­
ence. The Lord of Yoga, however, was unapproachable for Sati while 
in samadhi. 
b. Sali's Frailty 
Following the long spring of their love, the summer season came with 
days of scorching sunshine and hot winds. Siva and Sati took shelter

• 3 1 1  
in the shade of trees, for Siva had no house of his own: he had always 
been a homeless wanderer. But when the rainy season came, the trees 
gave no protection from lightning and the pouring clouds, and Siva 
had no money to build a house; all he had was the tiger skin that he 
wore and the snakes that were his sacred thread, his armlets, brace­
lets, earring, and girdle around his hips. He laughea away Sati"'s faint­
heartedness, and took her up on a cloud where no rain could fall. 
Hence, Siva became known as Jimutaketu, "having a cloud as his ban­
ner" (VmP. 1 . 1 1-30). Or he led her high up to the top of the Himala­
yas, where even the clouds do not reach. There Siva lived with Sati for 
ten thousand years of the gods (SP. 2.2.22 . 1 -65). Occasionally he vis­
ited Mount Meru, where the gods were, or he went to different places 
on earth. Still, he found happiness only with Sati (SP.2.2.22.66-68). 
After sporting with Siva until satisfied, the bride of Siva became 
very indifferent. She told Siva that her mind had turned away from 
the delights of love, blessed though she was to have become Siva's wife 
(SP.2.2.23. 1 -7). She knew that the Lord had married her out of love 
for his devotees (SP.2.2.23.6). She knew that Mahadeva out of love 
for his devotees let his maya, his power of illusion, stage the divine 
play that would draw his devotees to him by bringing him and Sati 
near to them. It was a sublime play in which god and goddess showed 
themselves swept by emotion and joined in passion while calm in their 
immutable selves. "All this is Siva's play. The mighty one produces 
many plays; he is independent and changeless. Sati also is like this" 
(SP.2.2.24. 16), though in principle rather than in action. 
Sati wanted to know the secret of devotion for the sake of which 
Siva created and acted out his plays. Siva explained that there was no 
difference between devotion and perfect knowledge (SP.2.2.23. 16). 
He meant that there was no difference in the object attained by them. 
The Great God was concerned that his devotees attain both release 
from the world and happiness in it (cf. SP.2.2.23. 1 5- 1 7). Prognosti­
cally, he had the Kali Yuga in mind, the present age in which his dev­
otees live, and during which the knowledge of ultimate reality and 
detachment have grown old and lost their attraction (SP.2.2.23.39). 
No other path brings happiness as does devotion (SP.2.2;23.38). Re­
signed and aware of the disposition of man in the Kali Yuga, Siva ex­
plained to Sati the virtue of devotion when perfect knowledge-the 
consciousness that "I am brahman"-was hard to obtain in this world, 
and that few men knew that Siva was brahman (SP.2.2.23. 13,14). 
Siva's explanation had satisfied Sati as it applied particularly to the 

3 1 2 ' F A M ILY O F  S I V A 
Kali Yuga, especially in need of the grace of Lord Siva (SP.2.2.23.37-
38). Thus Sati and Siva, who are the embodiment of the Supreme 
Brahman and who give happiness to the three worlds, sported in the 
Himalayas and elsewhere (SP.2.2.23'SS-S6). All the same, things did 
not go well with Sati. She did not always follow the meaning of Siva's 
divine play, and at times was deluded by his maya. Once Siva, having 
ascended his bull with Sati, roamed over the earth. They came to the 
Dal)<;laka forest and saw Rama searching for his abducted wife 
(SP.2.2.24. 2 1 -23). Rama was an avatar of Viťl)u. In the past, Siva had 
at one time crowned Lord Viťl)u as the lord of the universe 
(SP. 2.2.25.2 1 ). Having bestowed this lordship on Viťl)u, Siva bowed 
to Rama, an incarnation of Viťl)u, the lord of the universe 
(SP.2.2.24.27). Sati did not know of Viťl)u's coronation by Siva, and 
when she saw Siva bow before Rama, who was wailing for the ab­
ducted Sita and roaming in the forest, she was puzzled (SP.2.2.24.29). 
Even though Siva told her that Rama was an avatar of Viťl)u, Sati still 
doubted the divinity of Rama (SP.2.2.24.39-41 ). Siva then playfully 
urged the doubting Sati to test the divinity of Rama (SP .2.2.24.43). 
Sati staged a play of her own. She assumed the shape of Sita, the 
abducted wife of Rama. If Rama indeed was an incarnation of Viťl)u, 
he would see through her disguise. Disguised as Sita, she went to 
Rama, who on seeing her laughed and said, "Siva!" Sati was alarmed 
and ashamed for not having believed Siva and having doubted Rama 
(SP.2.2.24.45-5 1). She repented, and grief-stricken she returned to 
Siva (SP.2.2.25.41-46). 
Siva knew everything and recalled with distress the vow he had 
made in the presence of Viťl)u that if she should ever doubt his word, 
he would abandon her. Were he now to retain his love for Sati, his 
vow would be broken (SP.2.2.25.48-so; 16.44). It was then that Siva 
mentally abandoned Sati. He did not tell her the contents of the vow, 
and, to console the distressed goddess, he narrated many tales to her 
on their way back to Kailasa. There Siva, the yogi, entered samiulhi, 
meditating on his transcendent, real, Self (SP.2.2.25.5 1-60). 
When Siva finished his meditation, Sati, agitated in her heart, went 
to him. Siva tried to entertain and cheer her, telling stories of interest 
to her. She obtained happiness, as before, and Siva did not forsake his 
vow (SP.2.2.25.63-66). But it would be wrong to speak of Siva as hav­
ing become estranged and separated from Sati. The two are not sep­
arate. While they play as they like, Satt and Siva are united like a word 

L I F E  A N D  D E AT H O F  S AT i

and its meaning; but should they so wish, their separation can be 
imagined (SP.2.2.25.67-69). When the Great Goddess had stepped 
out of Ardhanarisvara and sent her power into the cosmos to be born 
as Sati, DakÆa's daughter, the Great Goddess returned into Ardha­
narisvara and Sati became the wife of Siva. The Goddess became real 
as a woman born of the wife of DakÆa; Sati was destined to become 
the bride of Siva by the will of Brahma. By her own will the dark, 
beautiful Sati practiced austerities. Her beauty and steadfast yoga at­
tracted Siva, the ascetic, and he asked the shy but determined Sati to 
be his wife. Suffused with love, Sati, the daughter of the ritualist 
DakĶa, asked Siva, the Lord of Yoga and of the universe, to take her 
according to the marital rites in the presence of her father 
(SP. 2.2. 1 7.22). This mattered to her greatly, for she had inherited 
from her father a sense of strict observance of rites. Little did she 
know that some time later she would be forsaken mentally by Siva, 
who could not continue to love her the same way as before 
(SP. 2.2.25.50-5 1 ), and that she was to blame. 
At the wedding, Siva wore a bridegroom's dress and ornaments: the 
elephant and tiger skins, and the serpents transformed at his will 
(SP. 2.2.1 8.23). But when he went to live with Sati in the Himalayan 
solitudes, he returned to his usual attire. Although Sati had subjected 
herself to fasts and other austerities in the worship of Siva, she had 
been accustomed to the style of life in her father's house, and became 
fainthearted living with Siva through the heat of a summer where the 
shade of trees was the only refuge from the scorching rays of the sun. 
She feared the coming of the monsoon, the torrential rain, and Siva 
took her up on a cloud; in voicing her fears of the coming monsoon, 
she revealed that she had not trusted Siva to protect her. 
Out of her own free will Sati had assumed human form 
(SP.2.2. 15.8, 27); by her own power of illusion (maya) she became and 
acted like a human (SP.2.2. 14.40); she was petulant and weak in faith. 
When the long spring of their love had been drawing to an end, Siva 
visited different places on earth; even so he found real happiness only 
when he was with Sati (SP.2.2.22.65-68). She, however, sated with 
love, let her mind dwell not on attachment, though hecattachment 
had been to the Lord himself who is beyond attachment, but on de­
tachment from the world and worldly bondage (SP.2.2.23. 1-9). It was 
then that Siva spoke to her of devotion (SP .2.2.23. 1 2- 1 7). 
It so happened that some time after, when wandering over the 

3 1 4 · F A M I LY OF S I VA 
earth in the company of Sat!, the time of testing came. They encoun­
tered Rama exiled and in distress in a southern forest. When Siva 
bowed before the grief-stricken figure, Sat! was astonished that the 
lord of the world should bow to any one, particularly such a dis­
traught person, and when Siva told her the reason, she was uncon­
vinced and doubted him. She meant to find out for herself the reason 
for Siva's deference to Rama, and went to test Rama, disguising her­
self as Rama's wife. Instantly, she was recognized by Rama. Shame­
faced and pained, she returned to Siva, for whom her test of Rama 
was a test of herself, of her faith and belief in Siva. Then Siva mentally 
forsook Sat!. 
Such was the divine play of the Great God in which Sat! acted her 
part as the mortal that she, the Great Goddess, had willed to become. 
All the same, the descent of the Great Goddess into human likeness, 
into the world, left intact her image as the Great Goddess who had 
stepped out of Ardhanar!svara and, in a trice, had returned into him. 
The triple figures of Sat!, of Kalika, the cosmic goddess, and of the 
Great Goddess are overlapping transparencies on the luminous 
ground of Siva Ardhanar!svara. 
The incarnation of the Great Goddess as Sat! was her way back to 
Siva through the failings and suffering of the human condition that 
she had chosen. When the first spring of their love was over and she 
had been with Siva both as yogin! and loving woman, the young god­
dess became dissatisfied. Her mind needed answers that would clarify 
her longing for ultimate knowledge, her need for devotion, and the 
relation of both these essential strivings. She had assumed the role of 
a human being, and was born to a life of ease and elegance in DakŬa's 
house. Though she had prepared herself for Siva's ascetic ways and 
responded to them as being of his very nature, when exposed to the­
not self-imposed---duress of living at the mercy of the elements, she 
turned petulant and was oblivious of Siva's power. She began to doubt 
not only his actions but also his word, and by her lack of faith she lost 
the Great God. She had her own will; out of love for this stubborn 
child, he reluctantly let her have it, and she sought her own death out 
of love of Siva as much as in anger for his humiliation by DakŬa. She 
sacrificed herself in flames of anger, before the celebration of DakŬa's 
sacrifice had begun. She regained her divinity and oneness with Siva 
in the fire that consumed her body, while Siva, moved by passion and 
compassion, could not overcome her loss.

c. Renewed Humiliation of Siva 
Siva and Sati returned to the Himalayas. They lived on Mount Man­
dara whence, on occasion, they visited hallowed sites. Thus they at­
tended a sacrifice held by the patriarchs and sages at Prayaga, at the 
confluence of the sacred rivers Ganga and Yamuna. Siva and Sati 
were already present when Dakia, the lord of patriarchs, arrived. Siva 
did not rise and bow to Dakia as did the others assembled there. This 
insult infuriated Dakia. In his anger he accused Siva of being like an 
outcast without religion and nobility, and cursed him to lose his share 
in the offerings (BhP .4.2 ,4-1 8). The curse only confirmed the status 
quo and gave it permanence (cf. Ch. III.2.b). 
Dakia's curse was prompted by the insult to his pride. Actually, 
however, Siva went against the very grain of Dakia (VaP '30-45-49). 
and Dakia's pent-up anger broke out in words of fury. Various 
Pura'(tas show, by giving different reasons, or by stating that there was 
no reason (BVP .4.38.5), Dakia's deep-seated, congenital hatred of 
Siva, who had let fly his arrow against Prajapati / Brahma, the father 
of Dakia. Dakia saw Siva as shamelessly dwelling in cremation 
grounds, mad and vile, as well as absorbed in endless love making 
with Sati, the daughter he had given as a wife to Siva. He had done it 
reluctantly, at Brahma's command (BhP.4.2.4- 1 6; SP.2.2.26. 10-16). 
Dakia cursed Siva to lose his share of the sacrifice (BhP.4.2. 1 7-18; 
SP.2.2.26. 1 8). 
In his curse at the sacrifice in Prayaga, Dakia brought up to date 
and gave actuality to a situation that was not new to Siva. He had been 
excluded from the sacrifice (TS.2.6.8'3; GB .2. 1 .2; TmB.7.9. 16), and 
was treated as an outcast by the gods. They gathered and ate together, 
but they did not eat with Siva. They contrived that no share of the 
offerings was to be assigned to Rudra in all sacrifices (MBh . 1O. 18.2-4; 
1 2.274.25-26; VaP.30. 1 1 2-13; cf. KuP . 1 . 1 4.8). At the sacrifice in Pra­
yaga, Siva's curse by Dakia was returned by Nandin, Siva's chief of 
gaI)as and foremost devotee. He cursed Dakia to become a gross sen­
sualist, worldly and vulgar. He would also be goat-faced (BhP.4.2.20-
26; SP.2.2.26.30-39). This too was a dreadful curse, exposing pejora­
tively Dak1?a's nature, for this arch-patriarch with his bountiful 
progeny was the paradigm of the competent sacrificer and ritualist. 
The goat, if the least of the five kinds of sacrificial animals-man, 
horse, 
bull, 
ram, and goat-according to ancient tradition 

3 1 6 ' FAM I LY O F  S I VA 
(SB . 1 0.2. 1 . 1), remained the most common sacrificial victim. Besides, 
the goat was considered a lecherous animal. Dakia, as the account of 
the great sacrifice celebrated by him will show, indeed left it goat­
headed (Ch. X.A.2.a). Iconographically, his goat head is Dakia's cog­
nizance. 
Hearing Nandin's curse, Siva laughed and soothed his foremostdev­
otee by making him understand that in truth Siva had not been 
cursed, could not be cursed, being himself the sacrifice and the sacri­
ficial rite as well as attached to and beyond the sacrifice (SP.2.2.26.43-
47). Delighted, Siva, accompanied by his gal).as, left the assembly. 
Dakia, full of fury and ill will against Siva, went to his home 
(SP .2.2 .26.5 1-52). 
When Siva spoke of himself as being sacrifice and sacrificer in one, 
he referred to a time when he in the shape of Varul).a performed a 
universal sacrifice. He, the foremost of the gods, so the Mahiibhiirata 
relates, assumed the shape of Varul).a (MBh . 1 3.85. 1 -2), the Overlord 
of the Universe (RV.2.28.6; 5.85. 1 ;  7.82.2; 8.42. 1).6 All the gods, 
sages, Vedas, the UpaniJads, the syllable AUM, Past, Present, and Fu­
ture came to that sacrifice. The Great Lord offered himself as an ob­
lation into himself. Then all the goddesses came to the sacrifice of 
Siva / Varul).a. When Brahma, who acted as the main priest, saw the 
beautiful celestial women, he shed some seed on the earth. God Piiian 
gathered the seed and cast it as an oblation into the fire. From that 
seed offered into the fire all the sages arose, beginning with Bhrgu, 
Angiras, and Kavi, also the Rudras, Vasus, and Adityas, the divisions 
of time, the stars, and planets (MBh. 13.85.3-24). Though all of them 
were already present at the sacrifice, the myth relates how they came 
into being at this very sacrifice, accounting for the result by its cause, 
while reversing their sequence. 
Mahadeva said, "This sacrifice is mine. I am the sacrificer. The first 
three offspring are mine" (MBh.1 3.85.25-26). Then Agni made a sim­
ilar claim (MBh. 1 3.85.27). Brahma, however, declared as his own all 
that had come out of the sacrifice, for it was his seed that was poured 
into the fire whence everything had arisen (MBh. 13.85.28-2g). In the 
end all the gods praised Brahma from whom the entire creation had 
sprung (MBh. 1 3.85.30). On their pleading, Bhrgu, the first-born of 
the sages, although born of Brahma became Rudra's own child 
6 Cf. A. A. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 23. 

L I FE A N D  D E A T H  O F  SAT ! ' 3 1 7 
(MBh.1 3.85.32). Angiras became Agni's adopted son, and Kavi be­
came Brahma's son (MBh. 1 3.85.33). The offspring of these three 
sages was to people the earth (MBh. 1 3.85.35). 
Rudra's role in the sacrifice was as the original impetus that brought 
it about and as the sacrificial act itself. Brahma contributed his sub­
stance. 
In this complex creation myth, which deviates from, though it is re­
lated to, the Rudra-Prajapati creation myth (Ch. 111. 1), Rudra / Var­
uI).a as the Overlord of the Universe offered himself into creation. He 
claimed the outcome of the sacrifice as his own, just as he, in his hor­
rendous shape of Pasupati, had claimed all that had remained after 
the lake of Prajapati's seed had gone up in flames. 
Rudra, lord of the sacrifice, in the shape of VaruI).a, the Overlord 
of the Universe, offered in his sacrifice his total self, like Puruia 
(RV.lO.gO). Brahma, however, contributed the seed and substance to 
the sacrifice and made Rudra, the Lord of Yoga, the nominal and 
adoptive father of creation. Rudra in the lJ.g Veda was invoked, 
though once only, as "Father of the World" (RV.6.4g. 1O) and its Lord 
(RV.2.33.9). Dakia, vituperating Rudra, had been unaware or ob­
livious of the position of Rudra, who was the sacrific଀r and the sacri­
fice. 
When the rainy season had passed, Dakia himself, foremost of the 
patriarchs, the Prajapatis, began the celebration of a great sacrifice 
(VmP.2.7) at Gangadvara in the foothills of the Himalayas 
(VaP·30.94). Dakia invited everyone, all his relatives, all the great 
gods, and the other celestials. He did not invite Rudra, his son-in-law, 
the husband of Sati, whom he had cursed at the sacrifice in Prayaga. 
This time his displeasure and disgust with Rudra was pinpointed on 
Rudra being a Kapalin, the bearer of the skull of Brahma (KP. 16.30-
3 1 ;  1 7.7- 1 2 ;  61 .4-5; VmP.2.8- 1 7; 4. 1 ;  cf. KUP.l. 14. 1 1 ;  SP.2.2.27.22). 
Dakia's mind was full of Rudra, who had shown himself for what he 
was, Darkness (tamas) embodied, and he reviled Rudra for being na­
ked, smeared all over with ashes of burnt corpses, wearing garlands 
of severed heads, and the bones of the dead as his ornaments. The 
hides of tiger and elephant dangled from his shoulders, his hair was 
disheveled as he roamed over cremation grounds like a madman, 
sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, a drunkard, riding a bull sur­
rounded by ghastly hosts of ghouls, ghosts, and goblins, altogether 
impure (PP.5.5.42-50; SP.2.2.27.43-44; BhP.4.2. 14- 1 6). Having cut 

3 1 8 ' F AM I LY O F  S I VA 
off the head of the Creator, Rudra had become macabre, gruesome, 
filthy, and demented in the eyes of Dak\ia, which was exactly how 
Rudra wanted to be seen, steeped in the horror of his own act, when 
he fulfilled his vow of expiation. Tormented, he had gone on his way 
to Release. 
One day, SatI, who did not know of the great sacrifice that her 
father was about to hold at Gangadvara, saw the Moon with Rohil)I 
going to Dak\ia's residence (SP.2.2.28.3). She told Vijaya, her lady-in­
waiting, to ask the Moon where they were going (SP.2.2.28.S). When 
Vijaya brought back the news that it was to Dak\ia's sacrifice, Sati im­
petuously entered Siva's council chamber and entreated him to come 
with her to her father's sacrificial hall. Siva lovingly restrained her; 
did she not know, as Dak\ia did, that Siva was his particular enemy? 
(SP.2.2.28.6-24). Siva tried to dissuade Sati from a journey to her 
father's house, and firmly stated that he, not having been invited, was 
not going to DakÆa's sacrifice (SP.2.2.28.2S-30). He was not invited 
because he was Kapalin, he carried the skull of Brahma, DakÆa's 
father; Sari, being Kapalin's wife, was not invited, though she was 
DakÆa's daughter. Little did Satl know that her father had given her 
in marriage to Siva only because Brahma had made him do so 
(SP.2.2.27.22-23, 42). Accepting Siva's refusal to accompany her to 
Dak\ia's sacrifice, she won his permission to proceed to her father's 
house, for she was pained and anxious to know what was going on in 
the mind of DakÆa and the assembled gods (SP.2.2.28.32-36). She 
went to DakÆa's sacrifice in royal splendor, riding Siva's richly orna­
mented bull and followed by sixty thousand of Siva's attendants 
(SP.2.2.28'37-40). When they reached the gate of the sacrificial enclo­
sure, Satl dismounted from Na,ndin (chief of the gal)as, and Siva's 
foremost attendant, who had the shape of a bull and the qualities of 
a noble devotee). She went alone inside the place of sacrifice and saw 
the portions laid out that had been allotted to all the gods. But noth­
ing had been set apart for Siva. She became intolerably angry 
(SP.2.2.2g. 1-7). DakÆa wanted to know why she had come at all 
(SP.2.2.2g.30). Forgetting the vow the goddess Kalika had made him 
take before she became his daughter, that Satl would cast off her body 
should he treat her with disrespect, DakÆa told Satl to her face that 
Siva, king of ghosts, goblins, and spirits, of lowly origin, improperly 
and indecently dressed, had been accepted by him as his son-in-law 
because Brahma induced him to this folly. But, as she had come all 

L I F E  A N D  D E AT H O F  SAT i 
• 3 1 9 
the way to the sacrifice, she could have her share (SP.2.2.29.3 1 -34). 
Sati replied that she would cast off her body, abandon this contempt­
ible body sprung from DakÆa and gain happiness (SP. 2.2.29.60-61 ). 
She added that DakÆa himself, during the course of his sacrifice, 
would be killed by her lord, Mahadeva. He would be reborn as the 
son of the ten Pracetasas, not as a brahmin but as a kÆatriya 
(MP.13.13-1S)' Then the obscuration of DakÆa's mind due to his an­
ger left him and he saw Sati as the Mother of the Universe and prayed 
to her not to forsake him. He understood her resolve, but he was des­
perate. Fearing he had lost her, he wondered where he would ever 
find her again (MP. 1 3. 1 6-23). Sati consoled him by saying that "she 
was to be found at every time, in every region, in every being. There 
was nothing in the universe in which she was not to be found" 
(MP . 1 3·24)·7 
She fell silent and became calm. Seated on the ground, she medi­
tated on Siva. She controlled her breath. Her inner, yogic fire con­
sumed her body. Its ashes remained on the ground (SP.2.2.3o.2-8; cf. 
KUP. 1 . 13·S9)· 
d. The Agony of Siva and YakJa Piiitciilika 
When Siva heard of Sati's death, he tore out a bunch of his matted 
hair and threw it angrily at the top of the mountain. From his breath 
a hundred fevers were born (SP.2.2.32.20, 24). 
Siva went to DakÆa's house and, after destroying the sacrifice, 
agreed to revive DakÆa and the others, but DakÆa would carry the 
head of a goat on his shoulders (BhP-4-7.2-3); or he cursed DakÆa to 
be born in a kÆatriya family and to procreate a son in his own daugh­
ter (KuP . 1 . 1 3.62). Creation by means of sexual intercourse would be­
gin with the appearance of DakÆa as the son of the Pracetasas 
(LP . 1 .63.2). Siva gave vent to his rage by curses appropriate for 
DakÆa, son of Brahma / Prajapati: DakÆa would perform incest, a trav­
esty of the primordial symbol of the violation of the Uncreate by 
Prଁapati. When Siva came to the spot where Sati had consumed her­
self in the flames of her anger, Siva smeared his body with her ashes. 
In agony and demented, he roamed over the country (BVP -4-43.27; 
4'38. 1 2- 1 3). Or, according to another, tantric tradition, Sati's body' 
that he had loved was still where she had shed it. Siva., raving in fren-
7 Matsya PUTCl1;a (MP) , tr. "A Taluqdar of Oudh," 19 16, p. 4 1 .  

3 20 • F A M I LY O F  S I VA 
zied pain, embraced the dead body, his hot tears burnt the earth. The 
gods asked Sanaiscara, the planet Saturn, to hold the tears of Siva, but 
Saturn was unable to contain them (KP . 1 8. 1 -27). Siva raised Sati's life­
less body and, placing it on his shoulders, balanced it on his head. He 
danced exceedingly, his arms flailing the regions. The stars were scat­
tered by the swish of his hair. Death, love, and despair syncopated the 
escalating speed of his Tal:l<;lava dance; the earth shook while Siva 
went on dancing in frenzy, his eyes whirling. The gods wanted to calm 
him, and ViťQu thought of a device to end the orgiastic dance. As Siva 
danced on and on, the body of Sati became lighter and lighter, and he 
saw that limbs and parts had fallen from it. ViťQu's disc had cut it part 
by part whenever Siva's feet touched the earth. Siva now had lost even 
the body of Satt, but then he saw her yoni, which had dropped in 
Kamarupa and had sunk into the netherworld. Shaken, Siva changed 
into a mountain and in the shape of a rock linga upheld the yoni. 
Wherever a part of Satt had fallen there rose a linga (cf. BDP . 1 .40. 1 3-
54; cf. DBhP·7·30·44-50; Cf. KP . 1 8·36-54)· ViťQu saved the earth from 
being shaken and destroyed by Siva's impassioned dance, and Siva be­
came calm, though his sorrow did not leave him. 
He had mentally forsaken Satt when she lived with him. She found 
him in the fire of her self-immolation. He clung to her charred, dead 
body, losing even that carnal residue of her existence, and turned into 
a rock to find permanent union with her in their symbol shape of linga 
andyoni. But this perennial symbol of his being, in the tantric context 
of this version of the myth, was a manifestation of a different kind 
from the one he assumed in his divine play, a manifestation of feeling 
and acting as a human being while also being a god. In this form he 
mourned Sat!, wandering about distraught as if in search of her. 
Then Kama espied Siva. Kama's five arrows may or may not have 
grazed Siva in that Himalayan spring when Satt had lived with him, 
but now the arrow called "Maddening" smote Siva and he went mad 
(VmP.6.26-27). Distraught, he roamed through the forests and fell 
into a river. The water was scorched by Siva's heat and turned black. 
Thenceforward the water of the river Yamuna remained black 
(VmP.6.28-3 1 ), but Siva wandered on in glades, along river beds, not 
knowing where he was, singing, wailing, weeping, brooding on Sati, 
dreaming of her. In his dreams he would implore her to return to 
him. When he awakened from his dream with a moan, Kama smote 
him again (VmP.6.32-43)' Smitten by the arrows "Insanity" (unmada)

and "Torment" (santiipana) Siva noticed Yakia panGi.lika, the son of 
Kubera, and transferred to Pancalika his insanity, torment, and yawn­
ing (vijrmbharta), for he knew PancaJika to be capable of bearing these 
afflictions (VmP .6.44-49). Panciilika took them over and Siva bestowed 
a boon on Pancalika that "whoever will see you at any time in the 
month of Caitra, touch or worship you with devotion, be he an old 
man, a child, a young man, or a woman, shall go mad. 0 Yakl'a, they 
shall sing, dance, sport and play on their instruments with zeal."8 
Even as they speak mirthfully in front of Pancalika, they will have 
magic powers (VmP.6.so-S3). It was in the spring, in the month of 
Caitra, that the magic of Yakl'a Piinciilika had begun to work. Siva's 
abysmal, crazed dance of mourning as he carried Satls dead body had 
been changed, as if by a magic touch of the yak$a ; Siva's madness had 
been converted into the lighthearted happiness of people dancing 
and singing and feeling the presence of Siva, though they come in 
contact with a mere yak$a only. In this way they would, unknown to 
themselves, celebrate the wedding anniversary of Lord Siva. Sati, the 
bride of god, was present in them, as she was after her death in all 
beings (cf. MP. 13.24). 
When Siva had sported with Sati in the spring of their love, the 
Great God was her gentle guide, initiating her into an understanding 
of herself, revealing to her the principle of life, and communicating to 
his beloved the presence of ultimate reality. In a vision, while meditat­
ing on him, she had seen him in divine radiance; at their wedding, she 
saw him as she beheld him in her vision, wearing all the shin­
ing ornaments of a bridegroom. Siva had changed his frightening at­
tire of the hunter and the yogi into dazzling splendor. She was not to 
know his fearsome shape, though Dakl'a had cursed it in her presence 
at the sacrifice in Prayaga. Her god and husband was her gentle, play­
ful guide. He expected her to be strong in her faith, and when she 
doubted his word he abandoned her mentally and diverted her mind 
by telling her pleasant stories. She had failed in her devotion to him, 
although she had listened to Siva's discourse on devotion (bhakti), the 
easy, pleasant path for those iill the Kali Yuga. But this age had not 
come as yet, and Sati did not apply to herself Siva's remarks. Her 
mind was shrouded in darkness, as was her body, like that of the 
Cosmic Goddess, whose incarnation she was. Down to the mom'ent

when she doubted Siva-and realizing that Siva had told her the 
truth, had returned to him-he had loved her so dearly that she 
seemed to enter his body, to be within him as she had been in Ardha­
narisvara. Mentally, Siva abandoned her, only to love her the more 
when finally he lost her who sacrificed herself, albeit in anger, for the 
sake of her love for him. The young daughter of Dakia consecrated 
herself by her sacrifice, and Siva, in pained frenzy, madly longed for 
her bodily nearness. Awake and asleep he dreamed of her, pleaded 
with her who was "constantly heard, seen, felt, admired, and em­
braced" (cf. VmP.6.38).9 She was the true love of the Yogi who did not 
let his semen flow. Siva's marriage with Sati had served Brahma's pur­
pose as little as did Siva when he became Sthal)u or plunged into the 
water. 
Siva transferred his woes to Yakia Pancalika, who would infect in 
the spring, in the month of Caitra, with contagious gaiety, dance, and 
music whomever might touch him. 
Siva unburdened his agonies on Yakia pancalika. Obligingly, the 
yaÑa accepted them. By the alchemy of his yaÑa nature and the 
glance, touch, or devotion of a human being in the spring, in the 
month of Caitra, the woes of Siva would turn into mirth, dance, and 
music. The pain and passion of the Great God, filtered through the 
yaÑa's being, when touched by anyone, would turn into joy and crea­
tivity. The spring madness communicated by Yakia Pancalika, and 
rooted in the agony and passion of the Great God, informed a local 
celebration in the Pancala country with intimations of deity. Siva then 
bade Pancalika to journey through all the countries, bringing his 
spring miracle to everyone. Siva then turned his steps toward the 
south, but there too Kama pursued him and Siva fled into the forest 
of Deodar trees (VmP.6.s6-S8; Ch. I X.6). 
2. THE SACRIFICE OF DAKSA 
a. Destruction of the Sacrifice 
In the first shock of the news of Sati's death Siva had torn out a fistful 
of hair. When he dashed it against the top of a mountain a terrific 
explosion was heard. The cluster of matted hair split into two halves. 
Virabhadra rose from one half of that cluster of hair (SP.2.2.32, 20-
9 Ibid., p. 28. 

S A C R I F I C E  O F  D A K S A  · 3 2 3 
22). From the other half arose the dreadful Mahakali (SP.2.2.2S). 
This awful goddess was the female counterpart of Virabhadra. Else­
where, however, it is said Virabhadra was created from Siva's brow 
(MBh. 1 2.274'36-38), while Bhadrakali was born from the anger of the 
Great Goddess, just as Virabhadra was born from Rudra's anger 
(MBh. 1 2, app. 1 ,  no. 28, lines 1 1 8- 1 9). Virabhadra, born from Siva's 
potent hair, or from his mouth (VaP .30. 1 22), was, like Puruia of the 
[J.g Veda, of great strength and splendor, with a huge body, a great 
being (VaP.30. 1 28-29). Like Puruia, the supernal male, he had a 
thousand heads, eyes, feet (VaP.30. 1 23), but also terrible tusks pro­
jecting from his mouth (VaP'30. 1 26) and numberless weapons 
(VaP.30. 1 23-24). He had the size of any of the world mountains, was 
ablaze all over, and dripped with blood. The crescent moon shone on 
his head. He was girt with snakes, wore tiger and lion skins and a gar­
land of flowers on his head. He was anointed with unguents and 
adorned with jewels. He rolled his eyes in rage. Sometimes he danced, 
sometimes he spoke sweetly or meditated intently. In short, he was a 
monstrous demon whose deceptive exterior disguised his true nature 
full of wisdom, detachment, sovereignty, asceticism, truth, patience, 
fortitude, lordship, and self-knowledge (VaP.30. 1 2S-36). He greatly 
resembled Siva, whose emanation and emissary he was; or Siva him­
self, according to an earlier account, destroyed the sacrifice (MBh. 
1 2 .274.3 1 ). 
Virabhadra was charged by Siva to destroy the sacrifice of Dak$a, to 
burn Dakia, his wives and kinsmen, and to fell the gods ViglU, 
Brahma, and Indra (SP.2.2'32'47-S8). Mahakali, the active power of 
destruction, was accompanied by the nine Durgas (SP.2.2.33. 1 1-1 2), 
whereas Virabhadra was followed by all the attendants of Rudra, who 
in hundreds of thousands had each assumed the shape of Rudra 
(SP.2.2.33.S). Over and above these, othersjoined the retinue of Vira­
bhadra. There were thirty million dogs, born like Virabhadra himself 
of Siva's hair (SP.2.2.33.36), the powerful issue of the one who as the 
Hound of Heaven scintillated frottHhe [J.g Veda sky (Ch. 11.4). Siva had 
remained faithful to his canine form. The dog stayed with him, his 
stately companion in his aspect of Bhairava, to which the South In­
dian image makers, in the beginning of the second millennium of oUf 
era, gave visible reality in art. 
Virabhadra and his host set out in chariots drawn by ten thousand 
lions. Among his bodyguard were lions, tigers, crocodiles, fish, and 

3 2 4 ' FA M I LY O F  S I VA 
elephants (SP.2.2.33.7-8). Sixty-four groups of angry yoginis (divine 
sorceresses, demonesses, and fairies) and I)akinis and Sakinis, along 
with Bhutas (ghosts), the Pramathas (churn spirits), the Guhyakas 
(guardians of hidden treasures), the Bhairavas, K$etrapiilas (land 
guardians), and other types of spirits and fiends accompanied Vira­
bhadra (SP.2.2.33. 13- 1 5). 
Evil omens appeared: Dakia's left eye, arm, and thigh throbbed, 
stars shone billiantly in daylight, and thousands of vultures hovered 
over Dakia's head. Dakia and others vomited blood, pieces of flesh, 
and bones. Then darkness set in; it was shot across by a peculiar blaze. 
The gods fell senseless to the ground. There they lay like dead ser­
pents, or they bounced up again like balls; they rolled and dashed 
against each other like tortoises. All the gods, even ViiJ.lu, had their 
powers blunted (SP.2.2.34.2-20). After a great battle, the gods and 
others were put to flight and went to their respective worlds 
(SP. 2.2.36. 16- 18). They came to understand that the w hole catastro­
phe was brought about by Sati (SP.2.2.37.42). 
The gods having left, all who depended on sacrifices were defeated. 
On seeing the destruction of the sacrifice, the sacrifice itself was 
frightened and, taking the shape of an antelope, it fled. Virabhadra 
seized the sacrifice in the form of an antelope fleeing up to the sky 
and beheaded it (SP. 2.2.37.44-46). This done, Virabhadra kicked the 
patriarchs and sages on their heads (SP.2.2.37.48). CaJ.lQa, the Fierce, 
pulled out the teeth of Puian, because-according to the Siva 
PuriituZ-Puian had shown his teeth when he laughed while Siva 
was cursed by Dakia (SP.2.2.37.54). Nandin tore out the eyes of 
Bhaga, who had winked, approvingly, at Dakia uttering his curse 
(SP. 2.2.37.55). Virabhadra, in person, with the tip of his fingers cut 
off the nose of Sarasvati, the consort of Brahma (SP.2.2.37.49). 
Dakia, who was hiding behind the altar, was dragged out by Vira­
bhadra, who tore off the head of Dakia-as Siva had severed 
Brahma's head-and threw it into the sacrificial fire pit, a last sacrifi­
cial offering (SP.2.2.37.58-61 ). When the entire sacrificial site with all 
that was left on it was burnt, Virabhadra's laugh rang across the three 
worlds. Flowers from the celestial gardens were wafted over Vira­
bhadra by a cool, fragrant breeze as he, having accomplished his task, 
went to Kailasa, to Lord Siva (SP.2.2.37.63-67). 
In other versions of the destruction of Dakia's sacrifice Siva himself 

SACR I F I C E  O F  D A KSA • 3 2 5 
was the destroyer. In the evening, after the destruction, Siva danced 
(NS .4.234). 
A cycle had come to a close. DakÆa's head was cut off by Vira­
bhadra / Siva in retribution for DakÆa's not having invited Siva to his 
sacrifice on account of Siva being a Kapalin, having cut off the fifth 
head of Brahma, DakÆa's father. Dak$a, carrying out Brahma's will, 
had reluctantly become Siva's father-in-law. He had to pay with his 
own head for having slighted Siva, just as Brahma had. Dak$a's be­
heading was not only an aftermath but also a kind of replay in the 
chain of these beheadings. 
After the destruction of DakÆa's sacrifice, the defeated and muti­
lated gods went to Brahma, and related their defeat. Brahma was 
pained on account of Dak$a, his son, whom he wanted to see restored 
to life and his sacrifice continued. Brahma and the gods resolved to 
go to Kailasa and ask Siva's forgiveness (SP.2.2.40.3-6, 20-22). They 
found the Lord under the shady branches of his vata (fig) tree where 
he went to practice yoga (SP.2.2.40.3S-37). The gods eulogized the 
Lord as an ocean of mercy, A$̻amiirti, the primordial lord, and they 
asked him to revive both the uncompleted sacrifice of Pr̼apati Dak$a 
and DakÆa himself, and to restore the organs and limbs of the muti­
lated gods. The gods promised that Siva would be allotted his share 
in the sacrifice (SP.2.2.41 .44-S1 ). Siva, acknowledging his delusion of 
the gods by his inscrutable miyii (SP.2.2.42.4), stated clearly that the 
destruction of DakÆa's sacrifice was not his work, for if one hates an­
other, it will recoil on him (SP.2.2.42.S). Lord Siva then decreed that 
god Bhaga should again see by the eye of the sun, but PiiÆan would 
remain toothless (SP.2.2.42.7-8). Then Siva, accompanied by the gods 
and sages, proceeded to the site of the sacrifice, where he saw the de­
struction that Virabhadra had wrought (SP.2.2.42 . 1 3-1S). At Siva's 
command, Virabhadra quickly threw DakÆa's headless body in front 
of Siva, and the gods put the head of a goat, the sacrificial animal, on 
the body of Dak$a. Siva glanced at the head joined to the body, and 
Dak$a, regaining life, awoke as if from a deep sleep. DakÆa was about 
to praise Lord Siva but was overcome with emotion and love for Sati, 
his deଂd daughter. When he, calmed down, he who formଃly had 
hated Siva now praised him (SP.2.2.42.21-32). DakÆa completed the 
sacrifice and gave Siva his full share in the sacrifice (SP.2.2.43.2S-26). 
Though DakÆa's sacrifice was part of Siva's divine play, it was the 

32 6 · FA M I LY O F  S I VA 
culmination of Rudra's aeviternal struggle for recognition by those 
gods who had been critical of him from the beginning. As described 
in the Siva Puril'l:za, the pageantry of Dakia's sacrifice served a moral. 
Earlier versions were free from this. Moreover, paradoxically, the 
plot of Dakia's sacrifice (MBh. 1 2.274.23-26) had its precedent in 
which Dakia did not figure at all. There, it was the gods who excluded 
Rudra from the sacrifice (cf. MBh. 1O. 1 8.2-4). Rudra's exclusion from 
the sacrifice, whether by the gods or by Dakia, and his winning his 
share by destroying the sacrifice, became the recurring themes in 
common to all versions of the myths (cf. TS.2.6.8'3; SB . 1 .7.4. 1-1 7). 
This main theme, however, was the consequence, and served as a 
cloak to cover a fundamental situation: the assault by Rudra of the 
Father, Prajapati. Rudra's arrow had pierced Prajapati, the Creator / 
Progenitor, the god, the antelope. This was the primeval myth. Acted 
out ritually, Rudra pierced Prajapati, the sacrifice. 
Wounded Prajapati, the antelope, the embodiment of the sacrifice, 
who had cohabited with his daughter in the shape of a female ante­
lope, sprang up to heaven and, blazing in beauty, became the constel­
lation Mrga, the Antelope. Rudra, the hunter who followed the ante­
lope across the sky, became the star Mrgavyadha, the Hunter of the 
Antelope (AB .3.33; cf. MS-4-2. 1 2 ;  cf. SB.2.1 .2.g; cf. VaP.30. 157; cf. 
MBh. 1O. 1 8. 13-14; cf. VmP.5.26-27; cf. LP. 1 . 100'34-35; cf. SP. 
2.2.37.45-46). The gods themselves had urged Rudra to pierce Praja­
pati (SB . 1 .7-4-3, 4). 
"When the anger of the gods subsided, they cured Prajapati and cut 
out that dart of this (Rudra); for Prajapati, doubtless, is this sacrifice" 
(SB . 1 .7-4-4).10 The gods were anxious to save this small part of the 
sacrifice, this morsel of the Creator's body pierced by the arrow of 
Rudra. It should not get lost, should not be wasted. Small as it was, it 
should be the first part of the offering (priiSitra) (GB .2.1 .2). The gods 
had it taken to Bhaga to eat. Bhaga looked at it. It burned his eyes 
and he became blind. They had it taken to Puian, who tasted it and 
lost his teeth. It was not yet appeased. It was then taken to Brhaspati, 
the lord of the creative Word. He took it to Savitr, the "Impeller" (of 
the sun). He "impelled" it, and it did not harm him. It was appeased 
(SB . 1 .7-4-5-8; GB .2.1.2; cf. TS .2.6.8'3-6; cf. KB .6. 13)' Some Pura1Jf1S, 
speaking about the gods injured by Rudra at the sacrifice, add to the 
1 0  Satapatha Brahmatla (SB) , tr. J .  Eggeling, 1 963, part I ,  p. 2 1 0. 

SA C R I F I CE O F  D A KSA • 32 7 
ubiquitous figures of Bhaga and PiiÆan that of Kratu (the Sacrifice). 
Bhaga and PiiÆan lost their eyes and teeth, respectively, whereas 
Rudra cut off the testicles of Kratu. Kratu fell to the ground, his 
organ of procreation having been pierced (VrP .33. 1 0- 1  I ;  cf. 
SkP .4.2 .89'43-44)· 
Although, in this account, Kratu is coordinated with the other gods 
at the sacrifice, the memory of the Vedic context knows that Rudra 
wounded the generative organ of Prajapati, Kratu, the sacrifice. The 
small bit that the gods had cut out of Prajapati was magically potent: 
it was that part of the Lord of Generation that had felt the entry of 
the arrow of Rudra and was in immediate contact with its searing 
thrust. It held the power of Rudra's arrow even when cut out of Praja­
patio That danger-laden morsel had to be offered right back to the 
source, to the lord of the creative Word, to Savitr, the Impeller of the 
sun, the vivifying power that illumines the cosmos and the mind. 
The gods excluded Rudra from the sacrifice. They well knew for 
what reason. But then in a hysteron proteron, it is implied that Rudra 
pierced the sacrifice because the gods excluded him from the sacrifice 
(TS .2.6.8.3)' Because they assigned no share to him, Rudra went after 
them and pierced the sacrifice. This inversion was a "translation" of 
the tremendous primordial mystery from mythical event into ritual 
performance. Because Rudra's arrow had struck Prajapati, the Lord 
of Generation, the gods excluded Rudra from the sacrifice in the ' 
hope that the sacrifice would be effective for them. Then, Rudra 
pierced the sacrifice. 
Mythically, Rudra pierced Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, only 
once. This mythical feat was enacted ritually by Rudra piercing the 
sacrifice. It was now the task of the gods to propitiate Rudra by ritual 
means so that the sacrifice should be well offered and benefit them. 
Whatever the first part of the offering may have been physically, 
symbolically it was the morsel of the Creator's body pierced by the ar­
row of Rudra. Its power was' devastating. It deprived the gods of vi­
sion and creative potency. The teeth of PuÆan symbolized the latter.11 
It was PiiÆan who cast Brahma's seed into the sacrificial fire (Ch. 
X.A. I .c). Only Savitr himself, the Impeller of solar power, of)ight, 
sight, and creativeness, could appease the rabid morsel.

The primordial myth told in the ȯg Veda and its ritual reenactment 
as described in the Yajur Veda and the Briihma'(tas are substantially 
identical. The bridge from the aeviternal meaning of the myth to its 
sacrificial symbol connects different levels, one of intuited vision, the 
other of ritual practice. In consequence of the mythical assault against 
Prajapati by Rudra, the seed of the Creator fell on the earth, which is 
the place of sacrifice, whatever be the location of any particular cele­
bration. Mythically, the gods cut out of the body of Prajapati the ar­
row stuck in the wound. As soon as it was seen, the perfervid might of 
this "fore-offering" assaulted the gods. Finally, they were able to allay 
its fierceness by offering it to Savitl', the Impeller. Ritual practice had 
for its model a myth, the myth of the dangerous, wounded spot of 
Prajapati's body. Because it had been potent, endangered, and 
wounded, it became dangerous: the danger-causing arrow had stuck 
in it. The star myth of Prajapati, the antelope, and the hunter in the 
sky had its ritual equivalent in the myth of the wounded flesh of 
Prajapati and Rudra's arrow, which had inflicted the wound. 
In Dakia's sacrifice, Virabhadra / Rudra pursued the antelope to 
the sky and beheaded the antelope, the sacrifice. CaI)<;la, the Violent, 
a subform of Rudra, knocked out the teeth of Puian, and Nandin 
plucked out the eyes of Bhaga; Virabhadra cut off the nose of Sara­
svati and crushed Bhl'gu, whose moustache was torn out by MaI)i­
bhadra (SP.2.2.37.4S-SS). The emanations and acolytes of Siva imper­
sonated the angry morsel charged with Rudra power, which the gods 
had cut out of the wounded, killed, or sacrificed Prajapati. 
The primordial sacrifice in which the Father / Prajapati was the vic­
tim, the paradigmatic ritual sacrifice celebrated by the gods, and the 
sacrifice of Prajapati Dakia succeeded and substituted for one an­
other in the ongoing myth of Rudra. 
According to the Mahiibhiirata, the sacrifice, following the primor­
dial sacrificial pattern, was offered by the gods after the Kl'ta Yuga 
had passed. Rudra was excluded from the sacrifice because the gods 
did not know him truly. Though he looked like a brahmaciirin, clad in 
an antelope skin, he also carried a bow; he was Mahadeva, the Great 
God, whom the other gods had not recognized and to whom they had 
assigned no share. Enraged, Rudra went to the sacrifice and, while the 
earth trembled and the stars wandered in irregular courses, his arrow 
pierced the heart of the embodied sacrifice; in the shape of an ante­
lope it fled to heaven. After the sacrifice had fled along with Agni, the 

SAC R I F I C E  O F  D A K SA 
• 3 2 9 
sacrificial fire, the gods lost their creative powers. Rudra deprived 
Bhaga of his eyes and Puian of his teeth. Laughing aloud, he para­
lyzed the other gods. They sought his protection. Gratified, Rudra 
threw his burning wrath into the ocean. There it dwelled, drinking 
the water of the ocean incessantly (MBh. IO. 1 8. 1-2 1 ). Appeased, 
Rudra restored the mutilated gods. They assigned to Mahadeva all 
the oblations as his share (MBh. IO. 1 8.22-24). The Great God here ap­
peared cruel and kind in one, that is, in his pristine nature. 
Rudra / Mahadeva in this amplified version played the part of the 
baneful priiSitra, which in turn had contained his destructive power. 
In other words, Rudra destroyed the sacrifice from which the gods 
had excluded him. Having destroyed it, he made it whole again and 
won his share in the sacrifice. No wonder the gods did not know 
Rudra truly; it was difficult to know him, the Great God who was and 
looked like an ascetic and acted like a demon. They could not make 
sense of him, let alone make a mantra or poem, as the gods of the lJ.g 
Veda had done when they saw the Wild God, the formidable archer. 
Fighting for his place in the sacrifice, Rudra gained a precarious ad­
mission to the world of the gods. He had to be born from Prajapati, 
the Father; he had to receive from his mouth the names by which he 
was invested with the cosmos and became Mahadeva, the Great God. 
By his birth and the receiving of his names he was freed from evil. 
Even so, he remained outside the pale of the other gods, who cele­
brated sacrifices and received their share in them. Whereas the 
Father, Prajapati, the Creator, had become Rudra's victim and made 
Rudra his son, Rudra did not gain recognition from the sacrificing 
gods. To gain admission to the sacrifice and the world of the gods 
Rudra, paradoxically, had to reenact his primordial feat. His shot now 
was aimed at the sacrifice. The sacrifice took the shape of an antelope, 
the same shape in which Prajapati had become the target of the Wild 
Hunter. Prajapati attacked by Rudra made him Pasupati, Lord of 
Animals. 
Dak(ia appeared first in the myth of Rudra and the sacrifice in two 
other versions in the Mahiibhiirata. In both these versions Parvati and 
not Sati was the wife of Rudra (MBh.1 2.274.7 and 1 2, app. I ,  no. 28, 
line 69). Sati does not appear in the Mahiibhiirata. Virabhadra: on the 
other hand, has his origin recorded in the Mahiibhiirata, obliquely in 
one instance (MBh. 1 2.274.36-40) and directly in the other (MBh. 1 2, 
app. I ,  no. 28, lines 70-80). According to the first account, due to 

3 30 ·  FAM I LY O F  S I V A  
Siva's hot rage for not having been invited to the sacrifice, a drop of 
sweat fell on the earth from the forehead of Siva, who was pursuing 
the fleeing antelope, the sacrifice, to the sky. From the blazing fire 
that shot up on the spot a dreadful being arose, covered with hair all 
over its black skin. It had bloodshot eyes and was dressed in the color 
of blood. That being devoured the antelope, the embodiment of the 
sacrifice. It then attacked the gods at Dakia's sacrifice. At the request 
of Brahma, this fearful creature was made to wander over the earth 
and was named Fever, the dreadful energy of Mahadeva. Siva distrib­
uted it in the earth as bitumen of the mountains, as a throat disease of 
horses, as a bilious attack in everyone, as hiccups of parrots, and in 
many other pains in which it was to enter tigers, men, and Vrtra, the 
cosmic serpent (MBh. 1 2.274.23-56). Because fever is the dreadful en­
ergy of Siva, none but Siva can remove it. Thus Siva is shown in his 
form of Jvaraharesvara, the lord who removes fever, dancing three­
legged like an off-balance Nataraja, one arm thrown across his body 
pointing to the raised leg that gives grace and dances away the fever.12 
Elsewhere, however, it is said that the drop of sweat that fell from 
Siva's forehead, on falling to the earth, became Virabhadra 
(MP.72. 1 1 - 1 3). Or Virabhadra emanated from the mouth of Rudra 
(MBh. 1 2, app. I ,  no. 28, lines 70-7 1), and confined his destructive ac­
tivity to the sacrifice of Dakia. Born from the contact of Siva's hair 
and the rock, Virabhadra's birth also fulfilled different conventions 
established in Siva's myth. 
After Virabhadra destroyed the sacrifice, Siva himself arose from 
the sacrificial pit and Dakia adored him in a hymn celebrating the one 
thousand and eight names of the Lord (MBh. 1 2, app. 1 ,  no. 28, lines 
140-55). The emergence of Siva, effulgent in glory and smiling, from 
the sacrificial pit in the narrative of the Mahiibhiirata took the place of 
Siva's becoming Pasupati in the account of the Maitriiyatlz SaTflhitii

Puratlas.

Primordially, Rudra was made Pasupati, Lord of Animals, by Praja­
pati for sparing his life; he earned this title anew in the course of his

ongoing myth. It acquired a new actuality. After Siva had defeated 
the gods in Dakia's sacrifice, they were helpless. Their divine, creative 
powers had been taken from them. Deprived of their faculties of 
knowledge, they were reduced to the condition of animals. Because 
the gods had not given him his share of the sacrifice, Siva had taken 
away their creative powers. Then the gods in their plight praised Siva, 
as he decreed that they all were animals (PaSu) and Siva, their lord 
(pati), would release them. Siva became the Lord of Animals, Pasu­
patio He gave back to Piiian his teeth, to Bhaga his eyes, and to each 
god his creative power and understanding (VrP.2 1 .78-82 ; 33.25-28; 
cf. MBh. 1O. 18.22-23). The gods recognized Siva as the primordial and 
eternal lord of redeeming knowledge, the Lord of Animals, Pasupati. 
Rudra reduced the gods to the state of animals. He made them an­
imals in order to save them. He became the redeemer of those who 
had become his creatures (paSu). In the primordial scene, the Father / 
Prajapati was the animal whose life Rudra saved. At the site of Dakia's 
destroyed sacrifice, the gods had to be humbled by Rudra; they had 
to become animals before Rudra could save them. The anguish of the 
creatures made possible their salvation. Pasupati, Lord of Animals, 
was the Lord and Savior of those who herd been gods and who, fallen 
from their divinity by their pride as participants in Dakia's sacrifice, 
had become animals (paSu). 
Rudra, the hunter of the antelope (mrga), is the Lord of Animals, 
Pasupati. PaSu, as a rule, is taken to designate the tame, domestic an­
imals or cattle such as belonged to Rudra in the sacrifice of the An­
girases. He made them over to Nabhanedi(ltha (Ch. 111.2). Rudra as 
Sarva was a slayer of man and cattle. Because he was a slayer of cattle, 
the gods who had divided the sacrificial animals among themselves re­
luctantly gave Rudra a portion of the sacrifice (TmB.7.9. 1 6- 1 8). The 
animals (PaSu) , however, that Rudra claimed as his own from the 
ashes of the burned-out lake of Prajapati's sperm included different 
kinds of antelopes, buffalo, camel, ass, tame and wild animals 
(AB·3·34)· Similarly, animals that live in the air, in forest, and village 
are collectively called paSu (RV .1O.go.8).13 Man too is included among 
the paSu (RV.3.62. 14). 
The Pasupata doctrine, one of five schools of religious doctrines 
mentioned in the Mahibhirata (MBh. 1 2.337.59, 62), relates the animal 
13 Cf. l}.g Veda Sarrthitii (RV) , tr. K. F. Geldner, 195 1 , 3:288.

(paiu), that is, the creature, the human being, or "soul" (iitman), to the 
Lord (pati) who breaks the snare (piiSa) that binds the unredeemed 
human being to worldly existence and its objects (LP . 1 .80. 1). "Salva­
tion in Pasupata doctrine is the state called End of Sorrow (dubkh­
anta)."14 " . . .  it is achieved only by the grace of God. Preliminary to 
this final liberation, however, is Yoga, . . .  'the union of the iitman and 
isvara.' The soul does not become absorbed or dissolved in isvara 
. . .  but remains inseparably tied to God in the state . . .  called Rudm­
siiyujya" (cf. PS. 5.33).15 
Although the Pasupata doctrine may appear to be grafted onto the 
myth of Dakia's sacrifice, the two are intrinsically connected. They 
stem from the primordial scene and preserve its metaphysical ontol­
ogy in terms of myth and religion. At the time of the Puriit;Uls, the 
Pasupata doctrine had long been established.16 Siva himself had an­
nounced that by the power of his yogic illusion he would appear as a 
brahmaciirin who, having entered a corpse on the cremation ground, 
would be known as Lakulin. This would come about at the holy site of 
Kayavatara, the "Descent into a Corpse," the present-day Karvan, 
near Baroda. There, also, four ascetic sons would be born to Siva 
(LP. 1.24. 1 27-32; ViiP. 23.219-24). The prophecy of Siva referred to 
himself as Lakulisa, the founder of the Pasupata order, who most 
probably lived in the first half of the second century A.D.17 The four 
sons-or disciples-represent the four sects following the Pasupata 
doctrine. 
In the first age of the gods, Prajapati had given to Rudra the lord­
ship over animals. Rudra became Pasupati. When this perfect age, the 
Krta Yuga, had passed, 18 Siva gave the Pasupata religion to Dakia, the 
son of Brahma, Brahma having taken over from Prajapati the role of 
creator. A cycle had come to a close between Prajapati, the Lord of 
Generation, and Prajapati Dakia, the patriarch. 
After the destruction of the sacrifice, Siva manifested in glory, aris-

ing from the sacrificial pit, and granted Dakia the boon of the resto­
ration of the sacrifice. Dakia praised Siva by uttering his thousand 
and eight names (MBh. 1 2, app. 1 ,  no. 28, lines 140-55). Carried away 
by their power and his own emotion, he concluded the hymn by stat­
ing the reason for not having invited Siva to the sacrifice. Since Rudra 
was the creator, master, and indwelling spirit of all creatures-since 
Rudra was adored in all sacrifices-therefore Dakia had not invited 
him to his sacrifice (lines 381-84). Or perhaps Dakia failed to invite 
Siva because he was stupefied by Siva's power of delusion (lines 385-
86). Siva in his grace did not doubt the sincerity, and overlooked the 
discrepancies in Dakia's statement, that is, his sweeping eulogy of 
Siva's universal acceptance at the sacrifice as the reason for his not in­
viting Siva, while at the same time admitting that his delusion was the 
cause for not having invited Siva. Dakia was no longer aware that he 
had stigmatized Rudra as a Kapalin, that he had even refused to know 
of Rudra's existence, when at the beginning of the sacrifice he had 
said that he knew many Rudras, he knew the eleven Rudras, but did 
not know Mahesvara (BrP .39.30-33; MBh. 1 2, app. 1, no. 28, lines 40-
41 ; ViiP .30. 105). Siva granted Dakia salvation (siiyujya). Siva made 
Dakia a leader of his host, the gaQas (LP. 1 .  100.49). Dakia would 
therefore dwell close to Pasupati on Mount Kailasa when Siva resided 
in his city called Bhogya, the Enjoyable (cf. LP . 1 .80.2). 
c. The City Called Bhogya 
Siva lived in different styles in the Himalayan altitudes. He had no 
house, no shelter for himself and for Sati, his bride. He was an ascetic 
and at the same time newly married; he could be both, for he was the 
Wild God sporting in the forest, or taking his ease on a cloud. Never­
theless, for granting a sight of himself to the gods who had been paius, 
Pasupati resided in his palace in Bhogya (LP . 1 .80. 1-3)' This city was 
built in eleven concentric and superimposed rings around the peak 
called Kailasa. Visvakarman, the architect of the gods, had built the 
palaces, mansions, and ramparts within the walls of the cities and 
their gate structures. The palace of Siva was in the highest, the elev­
enth, city, which was perfectly round, right on the peak of Kailasa 
(LP . 1 .80.9-23). 
,_ 
The city was full of beautiful women of the Rudras, gaQas, and sid­
dhas; there were thousands of Rudrakanyas, the Rudra virgins adept 

3 3 4 · F A M I LY O F  S I VA 
at conversation and music, both vocal and instrumental. Their eyes 
were roving, for the girls were slightly drunk. Many dancers lived in 
the city of Siva, with Gandharvas and Apsarases, yaÑas and serpents. 
All were splendidly dressed in different fashions and jewelry, and all 
the people in Siva's city were fond of pleasure and love (LP . 1.80.30-
40). The elegant and luxurious costumes of the people in Bhogya ap­
parently had much to hide, for as is stated in one text, gods, sages, 
and people are born without clothes, but because they do not control 
their sense organs, they cover them with clothes (BP . 1 .2.27. 1 1 8- 19). 
Dakia who had been cursed to be a sensualist, was now rewarded 
with a sight of the peak of delight in Siva's city of Bhogya. Having lost 
his head in the destruction of his sacrifice, Dakia had been made 
whole again by the gods, who had put a goat's head on Dakia's 
shoulders, and Siva's glance gave Dakia new life. In this restored 
identity Dak!;ia won liberation on seeing Pasupati in his city of de­
lights, where Siva resided on appropriate occasions, away from what 
is called the world of shame, delusion, and fear that he had created 
(BP. 1 .2.27. 1 1 7), a world ofpaius, although he had refused Brahma's 
command to create such a world (Ch. VI. 1 ,  3). 
The atmosphere of the city of Bhogya, heavy with the scent of flow­
ers and women, though it lacked the fresh air of the mountain groves 
where Siva used to sport with Sati, was free from the macabre fumes 
that rose toward Siva's residence in Avimukta. There, high up in 
iikasa, Siva dwelt liberated from having been Kapalin, the bearer of 
Brahma's skull. In Bhogya, Siva, the Lord of Yoga, resided as bhogl. 
Yoga and bhoga (sensual enjoyment) seem diametrically opposed in 
human experience. Siva, however, the Lord of Yoga, considered him­
self a yogi having supreme gnosis and a bhogl in full control of his 
senses (SP.2.2. 10.25). Siva imparted the Pasupata Vrata, the Pasupata 
vow and faith, to the assembled gods who had come to Bhogya for 
this purpose (LP. 1 .80. 1 -2, 54-56). The Pasupata vow is a sacrament of 
fire and ashes. When the doomsday fire breaks out of Siva's third eye, 
all creation is destroyed. Similarly, everything creaturely is destroyed 
in those who take upon themselves the Pasupata vow. It rests on the 
knowledge that existence is a relation of consumer and consumed. 
Fire is the consumer and Soma, the essence of life, is the stuff con­
sumed. Ashes are the very potency of Siva. Whatever has become 
ashes has become sacred. By daubing the body with ashes, and having 

S A C R I F I C E  O F  D A K S A  • 3 3 5 
controlled anger and the senses, all sins are destroyed and there will 
be no more rebirth (cf. BP. 1 .2.27.86-88, 106-24).19 
Siva had danced for RÆi MankaQ.aka the dance of Time. The earth 
had been shaken by the rÆi's jubilant dance when he had discovered 
that plant sap instead of blood flowed through his veins; Siva put a 
stop to the sage's exuberance by dancing himself before RÆi Man­
kaQ.aka. The elation was halted when he saw the lightness of Siva's 
dance, light as ashes. Siva cut one of his own fingers and white ashes 
dusted the ground (VmP, SM. 1 7.7-1 S). White and weightless, they 
showed to the sap-inspired rÆi a freedom from turbulence that the 
miraculous change in his own body, from blood to plant sap, had 
failed to achieve. But when Siva anointed his body with ashes, they 
were those of Sati, who had consumed her body in the yoga fire of her 
love and anger. Now that she no longer existed in the body, her ashes 
cooled the agony Siva suffered by being separated from her. 20 
Ashes are a potent and ambivalent dust of cooled embers, the prod­
uct of fire and matter that have ceased to be. Having gone through 
fire, they not only are purified matter but themselves purify. Symbol­
ically they are the essence, the spirit of matter, set free. They not only 
purify but are said to protect from evil the house of childbirth, in par­
ticular (BP . 1 .2.27. 1 1 4). Even so, from ashes the fields are made fer­
tile. Those who were covered with ashes, in control of their senses, 
calm, and came to Siva attained Release (BP . 1 .2.27. 1 1 S).21 For those 
who had undertaken the Pasupata vow the delights Bhogya had to of­
fer were immaterial; they were able to enjoy without attachment 
whatever the city had to offer. According to Siva's teachings, the sins 
of his devotees are destroyed after they bathe in ashes and meditate 
on Lord Siva (BP . 1 .2.27. 1 2 1 -2 2), and tripling their effort and having 
thrice bathed in ashes they become GaQ.apatis or lords of Siva's host 
(BP. 1 .2.27. 122-23), like Dakia. Those who would meditate and go 
northward obtain immortality (BP . 1 .2.27. 1 24); those who turn south 
to the cremation grpunds, understanding the eight qualities of Siva, 
become immortal (BP. 1.2.27. 1 24-26). Embodied as Lakulisa in Kaya­
vatara, Siva taught the Pasupata doctrine on earth .

d. The Antelope 
In the myth of Siva, the goat as sacrificial as well as demonic and lech­
erous animal was associated with Dakia. Its significance is less perva­
sive than that of the antelope. 
From Vedic time, the antelope, a denizen of untamed nature, was 
the animal figure of Prajapati in the spontaneity of his intercourse 
with his daughter. Rudra shot Prajapati the antelope. Prajapati-in a 
way even in this myth-sacrificed himself into creation, spent himself 
while creating. In the myth of the Satapatha Briihma1}4 (Ch. IX.3), 
Prajapati, exhausted from creation, collapsed and fell apart 
(SB.6. 1 .2.1 2). Conceptualized as the year, Pr£tiapati of the Satapatha 
Briihmatta spent himself into creation (SB.6. 1 . 2. 1 8). He filled with his 
content the year, the unit of cyclical time. He was built up by the gods 
in the shape of the Vedic altar (SB .6. 1 .2 . 1 3-22). The human sacrificer 
imitated their example and by complex architectural rites built up the 
sacrifice in the shape of the altar. 22 Pr£tiapati was the sacrifice and the 
year (SB. l 1 . I . l.l); and Prajapati was the altar (SB. I0. 1 .3.5). In the 
Mahiibhiirata and the Purii1}4s, however, the sacrifice, threatened with 
destruction by Rudra / Virabhadra, fled to the sky in the shape of an 
antelope (VmP.5.26-27; MBh. 1 2.274.34-35). It took its flight in the 
same figure in which Prajapati had been shot at by Rudra. 
Vedic Prajapati, the antelope, frightened to death by Rudra, the 
Wild Hunter, made him Pasupati, Lord of Animals, for sparing 
Prajapati's life. In Dakia's sacrifice as told in the Mahiibhiirata, how­
ever, the antelope, the "personified" sacrifice, was struck by Rudra's 
arrow right in the heart (MBh. 1O. 1 8. 13; cf. LP. I .  1 00.34-35; cf. 
SP.2.2.37.45-46), and leapt up and fled to heaven, pursued forever by 
the Hunter of the Antelope. Mrgavyadha, the hunter of the ante­
lope, up in the sky is the star name of Rudra, the Lord of Animals, 
Pasupati. 
Prajapati Dakia, patriarch and sacrificer, his own head having been 
thrown into the sacrificial fire as a last offering, was given the head of 
a goat when his sacrifice was restored and completed by Siva. When 
represented in art, the identity of Dakia is immediately recognizable 
by his head of a goat, though Agni on one occasion assumed the face 
22 Satapatha Brahrrul1:Ul (SB) , tr. J. Eggeling, 1963, part III, p. 1 50 n. 3, where Egge­
ling notes that the restoring of Prajapati is "symbolically identified with the building up 
of the fire-altar."

of a goat to amuse his child Karttikeya (MBh.3.2 15.23). This was in 
character for the myth in which Agni lusted after the krttikiis, the 
wives of the rťis, who became the "mothers" of Karttikeya. 
The goat was the last and least of the five animals offered in Vedic 
sacrifices (cf. SB . lO.2. 1 . 1). The sacrificer redeemed himself by the an­
imal that he offered (SB . 1 1 .7. 1 .3). Most anciently, the five kinds of 
sacrificial victims were man, horse, bull, ram, and goat (SB . 1 0.2. 1 . 1). 
Subsequently the goat alone remained the sacrificial animal 
(SB.6.2. 1 .5, 39; 6.2.2. 1 -6) that functioned as a proxy for the human 
sacrificer, for his animal nature that he sacrificed. By sacrificing it he 
consecrated himself. 
The black antelope skin, on the other hand, symbolized the sacri­
fice itself (SB .6,4. 1 .6; 1 2.8.3.3; 14. 1 .2.2). The brahmacarin was clothed 
in a black antelope skin (AV. l l .5.6). The rite of consecration was per­
formed on a black antelope skin (SB . 1 . 1 .4.3; 3.2. 1 . 1 ). During the year 
of initiation, the sacrificer wore a circular gold plate suspended OQ a 
triple cord of hemp from his neck down to his navel. The golden disc 
had twenty-one knobs comprising symbolically the totality of space 
and time. This golden disc was the sun, the twenty-one knobs its rays. 
Wearing the golden disc, man was transfigured from his human ex­
istence into his divine essence, for only then was he able to bear the 
fire of the sun, its seminal vital energy (SB .6.7. 1 . 1-8). The golden disc 
was "sewn up in a black antelope's skin; for the black antelope skin is 
the sacrifice" (SB .6.7. 1 .6).23 Between the body of the sacrificer and the 
solar energy of the golden disc lay the antelope skin as the means of 
protection and transfiguration. 
The sacrificer was anointed on the black antelope skin (SB .  
9·3·4· lO). Antelope and goat, in their symbolic significance, are clearly 
differentiated. Rudra's upper garment was a black antelope skin 
(BP. 1 .2.27·99). At a sacrifice, when Brahma invested Rudra with the 
sword that he had created for him, Rudra showed himself wearing a 
black antelope skin studded with stars of gold (MBh. 1 2. 1 60.44-47). 
He wore it as Mrgavyadha / Sirius, the Hunter of the Antelope. 
"On a he-goat's skin should be anointed one desirous of prosperity, 
on a black antelope skin one desirous of spiritual lustre" (SB .  
9'3.4. 1 4).24 The goat skin was magically instrumental in securing 
worldly goods, whereas the black antelope skin ଄as ritually effective 
23 Ibid., part III, p. 266. 
24 Ibid., part IV, p. 227. 

3 3 8 '  F A M I L Y  O F  S I VA 
in satisfying the longings of the mind and spirit for illumination. 
Should anyone desire both these fulfillments, he should be anointed 
on both skins (SB .9.3+ 14). The imparting of the Pasupata vow in 
Bhogya, the city of Siva, was not less accommodating. 
The consecrating magic of the black antelope skin was vested in the 
black antelope, Rudra's victim. "Once upon a time the sacrifice es­
caped the gods, and having become a black antelope roamed about. 
The gods having thereupon found it, and stripped it of its skin" 
(SB . 1 . 1 .4. 1 ).25 The black antelope was homologized with the sacrifice. 
The land where the black antelope roamed was the land suitable for 
sacrifice, from the eastern to the western ocean, from Himalaya to 
Vindhya. What lay beyond it was the land of barbarians (M.2.2 1-23). 
Even so it was the skin of the black antelope (kn'IJiijina) that sanctified 
and was homologized with the brahman (KB + 1 I). The gods flayed the 
animal; Rudra had shot it. 
Ironically though, by unerring logic, Rudra, who was excluded 
from the sacrifice, was the cause of the sacrificial, sanctifying magic 
emanating from the flayed skin of the black antelope, his victim. 
Ritually, the black antelope was the sacrifice. Mythically and ritu­
ally, Prajapati was the sacrifice. "With the sacrifice the gods sacrificed 
to the sacrifice" (RV. 10.90. 1 6; VS .3 1 . 16; SB . 10.2.2.2).26 The antelope 
was Prajapati and, from the beginning, Rudra's animal victim. 
The antelope became part of the iconography of Siva. In bronze 
and stone images of many aspects of Siva, the antelope remains 
closely associated with the Great Lord. He holds it in his hand; he dis­
plays it as an attribute as he displays his other attributes-the battle 
axe, trident, flame, drum, and skull-as insignia of his being. Play­
fully, the antelope-small in scale, for it is but an attribute-is shown 
leaping, supported by the fingers of the god's hand raised shoulder 
high, leaping toward the god or away from him, its head turned to­
ward Siva or in the opposite direction. The antelope is part of the im­
age of Siva in his manifestation as Candrasekhara, the lord crowned 
with the crescent moon. In this aspect the figure of Siva stands 
straight like the .cosmic pillar, like the linga, and this aspect is further 
emphasized in the image of Siva Ekapada or "One Foot," whose body

26 Cf. ͅg Veda Sa1flhitii (RV) , tr. K. F. Geldner, 195 1 , 3:289. Geldner notes that the 
sacrificial animal and the deity to whom the animal is sacrificed are one person.

is supported by a coalesced leg terminating in one foot.27 The ante­
lope is similarly balanced on the hand of Siva in a flexed stance as Tri­
purantaka,28 the destroyer of the triple city of the demons; or it is 
shown on his hand as Viiapaharal)a, Siva having swallowed the world 
poison;29 on his hand as Vil)adhara-Dakiil)amiirti, the Lord as the or­
igin of music and all the arts;30 or on the hand of Siva Vriabha­
vahana31 leaning on his conveyance, the bull. The antelope is on Siva's 
hand when he is represented together with the Goddess, his bride, as 
Kalyal)a Sundara;32 when he stands his arm embracing the Great God­
dess as Umasahita;33 or enthroned with her as Somaskanda, with the 
child SkandaiKarttikeya between them.34 Even the Great Goddess, 
shown by herself as Mahesvari, upholds the cognizance of the ante­
lope, as does the Great God himself.35 In the image of Pasupati, how­
ever, though it is similar to that of Candrasekhara,36 the figure of the 
antelope is substituted by akapiila, the skull of Brahma (SRa.2.22. 1 14-
16), demonstrating the parallel meaning of the hunter Rudra and the 
antelope / Prajapati on the one hand, and that of Bhairava and 
Brahma on the other. In contrast to this wealth of images, the stand­
ardized iconography of the image of Pasupati, but for its name, does 
not exhibit any feature that would visibly make it an image of the 
Lord of Animals. 
From the Vedic myth of Pasupati to its epic and Pural)ic transposi­
tions-the latter supported by a living faith, the Pasupata religion­
and by innumerable images of Siva in many aspects, the antelope ac­
companies Siva. Prajapati, the antelope of the Maitriiyatti Sa1{thitii 
(4.2. 1 2), and the antelope, the embodied sacrifice, each Siva's victim, 
are upheld playfully by one of Siva's hands. The animal was inte­
grated into the iconography and composition of the figure of Siva it­
self; it was drawn into and became part of diverse manifestations of 
the Great God with the inscrutable smile. 
Held in the upper left of Siva's four hands and shown by icono­
graphic conventioଅ balanced on or leaping from two fingers, the an­
telope was incorporated into the ambience of Siva, as were his other

attributes: the weapons, the musical instruments, other objects, and 
the skull of Brahma. The latter, related mythically to the Prajapati­
antelope, was confined to images of Siva Pasupati and Bhairava, 
whereas the antelope graced many aspects of Siva that did not directly 
refer to Siva as the Hunter of the Antelope. 
Instead of being carried by the hand of Siva, the antelope is shown 
in much larger size by the side of Siva as Bhikiatana, the Supreme 
Beggar, and also as Kankalamiirti, the "skeleton (-bearing) image," 
the latter carrying not only the skull of Brahma but also the corpse of 
Viivaksena. Standing beside the god and raising itself on its hind legs 
is an antelope, its head looking toward Siva's pendant hand, appar­
ently holding out to the antelope some leaves. The god holding out 
his hand to the animal accentuates the meaning of this iconographical 
conception. To the left of Bhikiatana, balancing the figure of the an­
telope on his right, a gal}a carries on his head a large bowl, a recep­
tacle for all the offerings presented to the Supreme Beggar, which he 
keeps in store for his devotees.37 In his grace, the Lord holds out his 
hand to the antelope. 
The antelope, the animal symbol of Prajapati, the Lord of Genera­
tion, the Creator, implies also the creature, the animal or paSu, the hu­

were, answered, "The Jivas are said to be the Pasus. Pasupati is so 
called because of his being the controller of the Pasus" (jUP. 1 2- 1 3).38 
In the work of the artists, the sculptors and painters, the figure of the 
antelope looks up to the image of Bhikiatana holding out his hand to 
the animal. In all the other images, the figure of the pasu, the animal, 
the human soul, is in Siva's hand.

Ten Pracetasas (MBh. 1 2, app. I ,  no. 28, lines 1 -2 ;  KUP. 1 . 13.53-62). 
Siva had cursed DakÆa by this rebirth on learning of his treatment of 
Sat! and her consequent death (K UP . 1 . 13.6 1 -63). 
Siva's passionate grief for Sati was assuaged in the age of Manu 
Vaivasvata by the birth of Parvati, the daughter of Parvata, "the 
Mountain," and his wife Mena, "the Woman." Brahma had planned 
that the Great Goddess who had been born as Sati would be reborn as 
Parvatl, the daughter of the Mountain (MP. 154.52, 60-61). In the 
meanwhile, the gods had fallen on evil days. They had been unable to 
hold their own against a formidable demon called Taraka, "Star." 
Taraka had practiced austerities as enormous as was his might. There 
lay the source of his power. He had approached Brahma, who 
granted to the ascetic demon the boon that he asked for. "If a son 
born of Siva becomes the commander-in-chief of an army and dis­
charges weapons against me, let my death occur then" (MP. 154.47-
, 
39 
54; SP.2·3· 15·4 1 ,  1 6.26). 
Before Parvati was to be born, Brahma prayed to Ratri, the goddess 
Night, who had emanated from him first. She alone was able to ac­
complish the great work Brahma had planned (MP . 154'55-58). 
Brahma praised the goddess Night, saying, "you are like lust itself to 
the sensuous, you are the play of those who are playful, the delusion 
of the mind, and you are Kalaratt'i, the Night of Demons, and the de­
stroyer of all that exists" (MP . 1 54. 78-84). Ratri was asked to aid the 
gods through the birth of Parvati (MP . 1 54.70-74). Ratri went to the 
Mountain King's palace. As Ratri entered Mena's fragrant, luxurious 
bedroom, night set in. Parvata and Mena had gone to bed. As Mena 
began to feel sleepy, the goddess Ratri entered her mouth. Slowly the 
goddess Night found her way into Mena's womb and colored the em­
bryo blackଆ She remained in Mena's womb till the time of delivery 
(MP . 1 54.90-95). 
Parvati was born at midnight when the constellation Mrgasiras was 
in conjunction with the moon. The Goddess assumed her own form 
(SP.2·3.6·32-33). Seeing the lovely faced one born of her own will, 
Parvata was perplexed and terrified by her radiance, and asked the 
Great Goddess, "Who are you? I do not know you, my child" 
(KUP. 1 .  1 1 .56-61). The Goddess showed herself to the Mountain 
in her divine form of calmly fierce majesty 9nd infinite wonder

(KuP . 1 . 1 .66-68). Parvata praised her with a thousand names 
(KuP . 1 . 1 .2 1 1). She showed the gentle, gracious form of glory, and the 
Mountain knew that she was the embodiment of the Self of all, she 
was Prakrti, Siva, the highest bliss. She was the goddess Mahesvari, 
half of Siva's body, called Siva. She was all-pervading, endless, without 
division, but the seat of all distinctions. She was the highest sakti or 
power of Mahesvara, the Great Lord. Relying on her, the Great God 
created and destroyed the world. She was the best of creation in every 
category. With her alone, Siva attained his own bliss (KUP. 1 . 1 .2 1 3-
236). Mahesvari was the Sakti (the embodied power) of the Lord, but 
it was he who possessed sahti (power). The yogis who contemplate the 
real truth see their complete oneness. Those who seek liberation find 
refuge in Parvati, the highest goddess, the self of all beings belonging 
to the self of Siva. Parvata would abide by his daughter's wish and give 
the goddess in marriage to the Lord of Gods, to Siva (KUP. 1 . 1 1 .3 1 6), 
who has no beginning and is unborn (KuP . 1 . 1 1 .302). 
Parvata felt there was neither god nor demon in the world equal to 
him, since the Mother of the World had been born to him as his 
daughter (KUP. 1 . 1 1 .252), and he rejoiced as he looked at the child 
shining in dark splendor. Parvata, the Lord Mountain, named his 
daughter Kali, the Black (SP.2.3.7. 1 1 ). 
Sati's mother, the daughter of sage Virat:la, was called Asikni, Night 
(SP .2. 2.29-4). Sat! and Parvati were both darkly beautiful, like blue lo­
tus flowers. But it was Ratri, the goddess Night, who entered the 
womb of Mena and painted the embryo black. Mena herself was a 
mind-born daughter of the Forefathers (pitr) (VaP '3o.27-31 ). She was 
to become the mother of two, or as others say three daughters. Ac­
cording to the Ramaya'IJa, Mena was the mother of two daughters, 
Ganga, the elder, and Uma (parvati), the younger (R . 1 .34. 1 3-14). The 
Vamana Pura'IJa knows three daughters of Mena or Parvata: RagiI).i, 
the Red, who was all red and dressed in red; Kurila, the Curvaceous, 
with curly dark hair and wearing a white garland and white dress; and 
Kali, the Black, also called Parvati, who was the youngest (VmP.25. 1-
4). The two elder girls practiced austerities, for each wanted to be­
come the mother of Siva's son; they were seen by the gods, and each 
girl was taken to the heaven of Brahma. Brahma found the austerities 
of neither adequate to make her fit to give birth to a son of Siva. The 
girls became angry and lost their tempers, particularly Kutila. There­
upon Brahma cursed them; Ragit:li, born of the Mountain, became 

LORD M O U N T A I N ' 3 4 3  
Sandhya, the red evening twilight, conjoined with the body of the 
Pleiades (Krttikas). Kutila, however, by the curse of Brahma was 
burnt and subsequently turned into water. In that form she would be 
able to bear Siva's seed, though not to the end; as a fast-flowing river 
she inundated the heaven of Brahm a (VmP.25.5-20). When Mena saw 
that her two elder daughters, the red and the white, were lost to her, 
she prevented her black daughter Kali from practicing austerities, ex­
claiming: "U ma-do not (practice austerities)" (VmP.25.2 1). 
The family of Parvati, in which the Great Goddess was incarnated 
as the daughter of Parvata, consisted of Mena, the Woman; her father 
Parvata, the Mountain; and her curvaceous sister Kutila, who in the 
heaven of Brahma turned into the overflowing celestial waters and 
became Ganga (the Ganges), the name by which she is called in the 
Ramayarta. The other sister, Ragit:ti-whose redness completed the tri­
ple color scheme of the three gu'!UlS-became absorbed in the constel­
lation of the Krttikas, the Pleiades. 
Parvata the Mountain was as old as the rocks and the lJ.g Veda. 
There he was invoked together with the Waters, the Rivers, and 
Heaven and Earth, and with Indra, Savitr, and other gods 
(RV.6.4g. 1 4; 7.34.23).40 Beyond this, the Mountain formed an essen­
tial part in the cosmogony that has god Indra for its hero. In that 
myth, the Mountain was a figure that stood for the intangibly high 
ambience that enclosed the world, closed it off from spaces of shim­
mering light toward which its slopes were rising. The Mountain en­
closed the world and closed off the infinite regions of light in the be­
yond above its impenetrable extent (cf. RV. 2.23. 18; 5.56.4; 5.60.3), 
the region of the sun before it ever shone on earth. When Indra cleft 
the Mountain, the light of heaven flowed down to earth (cf. RV. 
1 .32. 1-4; 6.30.3-5; 1O.8g.7).41 Parvata, the Mountain, keeping the 
light of heaven imprisoned, had been its guardian. In this respect Par­
vata, though inactive, was akin to Rudra, the archer, and to Krsanu, 
who by their actions intended to keep in its integrity the stote ante 
principium, before creation. In the myth of Indra-which pervades the 
lJ.g Veda-the Uncreate was a pleroma of light closed off by the Moun­
tain, and Indra brought it to the world. The ple}:oma of the Uncreate 
held the elixir and essence of Life: Soma, the elixir oflife, and semen, 
the seed of life. Vrtra, the serpent, had lain coiled around the cosmic

mountain. Vrtra was killed by Indra and fell to the bottom, into the 
abyss, when Indra shattered the mountain and released the streams 
to flow to the sea and freed the sun to shine in this world. But lndra's 
first act of creation was not yet complete, for the sun became engulfed 
in darkness in the cave at rock bottom, whence it had to be liberated 
and let out (RV. 1 .62.3, 5; 3.39.5; 6. 1 7.5; l O. 138.2) to rise in the spring 
of the world. Parvata was the rock bottom in the depths as well as the 
dome on high, the firmament, the sky, that had kept imprisoned the 
light and waters of life. 
In the creation myth of Indra, the figures of the Mountain and of 
Vrtra, the serpent coiled around it, correspond to those of Rudra and 
Krsanu, the archers. The Mountain was cleft, dead Vrtra fell to its 
bottom, becoming Ahi Budhnya, the Serpent of the Deep. The shin­
ing rivers of light and life flowed down from heaven to the earth, and 
their waters filled the ocean. The sun, having shown its face on high, 
had yet to be liberated from the cave deep in the mountain, where it 
had been kept imprisoned by demons. Now Dawn could come forth 
and the sun could rise and set going the world of time. Like Vrtra, the 
serpent, Rudra and Krsanu, too, failed to keep in its integrity the state 
ante principium, before creation. Their arrows could not arrest the 
flowing to earth of Soma, the elixir of life, and the semen that Praja­
pati shed into creation. They had been in the Uncreate, described as 
a region of ineffable light that Parvata and Vrtra had held unspent. 
The precosmic power of the Mountain had to yield the streams of 
flowing light of which the celestial Ganga, who was also called Kutila, 
became the mythical image. Her sister Ragil)i, the "red," Dawn or 
Twilight, had been her fellow prisoner. Her figure, of indistinct con­
tour in this myth, became merged with the Pleiades, the Krttikas, stars 
fixed in the firmament-the Mountain-becoming visible at the wan­
ing of the red evening twilight. Though liberated from the rock or 
Mountain, neither of these two daughters of Parvata was deemed ad­
equate in her austerities to qualify as the future, potential mother of 
Siva's son, although in the mythical universe of Siva, Ganga as well as 
the Krttikas (Ragil)i) cooperated in the birth of Siva's son. 
The bond that was to be forged between Siva and Parvati links the 
Mountain, a figure of the precosmic state as imaged in the myth of 
Indra, with the cosmic presence of Siva. The third and youngest 
daughter of Lord Parvata was Parvati, the bride-to-be of Siva. 

LORD M O U N T A I N · 345 
Within creation itself and-in later Indian myth, the Mountain was 
seen rising from the center of the world into the regions where the 
gods are at home. Mount Meru, the cosmic mountain, carried the hi­
erarchy of beings. Under the name of one of its peaks as cosmic axis, 
Mandara, the mountain functioned in the Churning of the Ocean. 
The Mountain in the cosmos of Indian myth was the center of that 
cosmos; on its heights in heaven dwelled the great gods, in cities, pal­
aces, and caves, enlivened by the presence of lesser celestials who 
moved about at will or rested on its slopes. Siva dwelled in Kailasa and 
also favored Mount Mandara. These mythic sites on high, envisioned 
from the earth, were assigned to the north, to the Himalayan alti­
tudes. Cosmically and symbolically, the north signified the region of 
the pole star. Mythically, the Himalayan region was its proxy on earth. 
The king of these mountains was Parvata. Parvataraja brought to his 
anthropomorphic representation his precosmic past. From him is­
sued Ganga the celestial river, whose other name is Kutila, who 
flooded the heaven of Brahma. Thence she flowed on earth, vivifying 
and bringing into this world her significance from before creation; 
when Parvata was forced open and had to let the flowing light from 
beyond into the world of man from the uncharted regions of tran­
scendency, the inviolate and inexhaustible plenum, Parvata's eldest 
daughter, Sandhya, the twilight or Dawn-the Father's Daughter­
merged with the Krttikas. It is natural that a daughter of the Moun­
tain should merge with the Pleiades, for in creation the Mountain had 
its cosmic figure as the night sky, where the light from beyond was 
seen shining forth in the shape of stars. 
Ganga, the elder daughter of Parvata, the Mountain, the stony 
dome of ancient heaven where in the world of later myth she flooded 
the heaven of Brahma, was to occupy the highest position on Siva's 
body. For a long while he held her captive in his hair on her precipi­
tous descent from heaven. Had Siva not supported her on hi,S mighty 
head she would have crashed down to earth, shattered it, and flown 
into the netherworld. He sheltered her in the matted skeins of his 
hair, and let her flow on to fulfill her mission, flowing in heaven, on 
earth, and the netherworld, thrice herself, Tripathaga, moving on 
her path. She is called Mandakini in heaven, Vegavati or Ganga on 
earth, Bhogavati in the netherworld (PP.6.267.46-47). 
She came from the apex of heaven to the moon, and flooded the 

3 46 '  F A M I LY OF S I VA 
heaven of Brahma (BhP. 5. 1 7. 1 ,4; VP.2.2.32).42 She came down from 
heaven into the netherworld in order to redeem the sixty thousand 
ruthless sons of King Sagara (R . 1 .43. 1-4; cf. LP. 1 .66. 15-20). 
The sixty thousand sons of Sagara were born to him by one of his 
two queens; the other queen had only one son (R. 1 .37. 1-17). After 
some time Sagara decided to undertake a horse sacrifice (R . 1 .37.23-
24; MBh.3. 105.9). The rite required that the consecrated horse be set 
free to roam at will. The land over which it wandered would form 
part of the king's realm. At the end of the year the horse was sacri­
ficed and the king became a Cakravartin, or sovereign of the entire 
domain. As the rite progressed, God Indra, for his own ends, ab­
ducted the horse and took it into the earth (SP .5.38.50). In vain did 
the sixty thousand sons who had accompanied the horse search for it. 
They went everywhere on earth, and then descended into the neth­
erworld. After a long time they found the horse near the hermitage 
of sage Kapila (MBh.3. 105. 1O-25). Ignoring the sage, the sons of 
Sagara quickly seized the horse (MBh.3. 106. 1 ). Angered, the sage 
opened his eyes, the fire of his tejas shot forth and burned to ashes the 
sixty thousand sons of King Sagara (MBh'3. 106.2-3). They were 
found by Arpsumat, the grandson of Sagara. He beseeched Rt>i Kapila 
to grant that those whom his anger had destroyed would ascend to 
heaven. The sage promised that they would attain heaven when 
Ganga was brought from heaven to purify their ashes with her waters 
(MBh.3. 1 06.20-27). This was beyond the power of the descendents of 
King Sagara until Bhagiratha, the grandson of Arpsumat, by his as­
ceticism and devotion to Siva, moved the Great God to agree to sus­
tain Ganga, the daughter of the Mountain, during her descent to pre­
vent the earth being split by the impact of her fall (MBh.3. 108. 1-6). 
Siva caught the turbulent Ganga like a garland of pearls on his fore­
head (MBh.3. 108.g). She who had thought by raging whirlpools to 
press Siva down into the netherworld could not find an outlet from 
the meshes of his hair, and floated on them like a flower. She at last 
reached the earth. Her waters flooded the ashes of the sons of Sagara. 
At last, the ancestors of Bhagiratha were redeemed. Ganga flowed 
into the seas and her waters filled the ocean (MBh.3. 108. 12-17).43

Impetuous Ganga, "who was as beautiful as the rays of the moon,"44 
not having been found capable by Brahma to bear the seed of Siva, 
insisted she was capable, that she would make the head of Siva bow 
down by her austerities. Brahma cursed her to become all water, and 
she inundated Brahma's heaven (VmP.25.6-14). Though she wanted 
to bear Siva's son, she resented her initial humiliation and wanted to 
show herself superior to Siva, who had the power to support her on 
his head and imprison her in his hair. She was violent in her turbu­
lence. She would crush Siva so that pieces of his bones, like small bits 
of conch shells, would be mixed with her water and N andin would 
have to search for them.45 She was intensely desirous of Siva, deter­
mined to hold him within her aquaeous body, having broken him up 
all together. But he caught and entrapped her in his hair. There, he 
carried her on his head like an ornament, or let her glide like a mer­
maid along the waves of his hair when he danced. "As beautiful as the 
rays of the moon," she found herself close to the crescent moon that 
graced Siva's brow. Its thin sickle showed it to be waning, for the gods 
had drunk its Soma nectar, leaving but this last part for the Pitrs, the 
Manes, to drink.46 Ganga, released from Siva's hair, found her way to 
the sons of Sagara, dead and burned to ashes. She purified them by 
her water, and they ascended to heaven. Death associations decorate

Ganga's purpose in descending into the netherworld had been 
achieved. She purified the dead and they ascended to heaven. This 
mission the sacred river Ganges fulfills to this dayY Ganga went 
through all the levels of the cosmos and of inner experience. She 
wanted to bear Siva's son, but she also wanted to crush Siva. Fierce 
and proud, this river goddess fulfilled her mission when first she

on her work never ceased. The water of the sacred river Ganges

brings release to the dying who seek it, and she bringsjoy to the living. 
The Ganges is called "giver of release" (mok$adii) and "giver of joy" 
(bhogadii). But she did not bring much joy to Parvati, who looked upon 
her as a rival. 48 Ganga had never been in Siva. She came to Siva from 
on high; he caught her on his head and kept her in his hair. She 
floated with his locks spreading through the cosmos when he danced 
in ecstasy. Her foam caressed his hair, her hands reached out to the 
crescent moon on whose nectar the Manes feed. Parvati frowned at 
her (MD'50). Ganga took no notice of Parvati'sjealousy, which preoc­
cupied the minds of poets and artists. She had a mission and tempo­
rarily had become Siva's captive. She loved him destructively, but 
could not harm him. Her desire to become the mother of Siva's son 
was fulfilled by indirection, while Parvati did not bear the seed of Siva. 
Parvati, the youngest daughter of the Mountain and of the 
"Woman" or Mena-whose name is shared by Apsarases, seductive 
nymphs arisen from the spray of the cosmic ocean at its churning­
from before her birth was destined for the surpassing task, beyond 
her control, which her sisters could not fulfill by themselves: to be­
come the mother of Siva's son. For this purpose the goddess Night, 
her starry eyes dosed, had entered Mena's womb and infused night's 
darkness into the embryo. She enveloped the embryo until birth. The 
goddess Night painted in Mena's womb the embryo with her darkness 
(lamas) (MP . 1 54.6 1 -70). 
In this manner Brahma prepared the birth of Parvati so that the 
Lord might fulfill the purpose of Brahma. The Great Goddess coop­
erated with Brahma and entered her second incarnation as the 
daughter of the Mountain. She fixed herself in the mind of Lord 
Mountain when he made love with Mena, and Mena conceived 
(SP.2'3.6'5-6). Brahma's long-frustrated desire for the creation of 
mortal progeny through Siva was now superseded by a new urgency. 
Only a supergod born of Siva would be able to destroy the demon 
Taraka. 
Parvati was a full incarnation of the Great Goddess (SP .2.3.4.25). 
Previously, the Great Goddess had been incarnated in Sati, to win the 
love of Siva. Now she decided to be born as the daughter of the 
Mountain and Mena (SP.2.3.6.2). She had taken this form in answer 
4" Cf. Mudriiriik.$asa 1 . 1 ., quoted by C. Sivaramamurti, Gmigii, p. 23·

to the prayer of the gods that she again become the wife of Siva 
(SP.2.3.4. 1 8). The Great Goddess, the eternal Prakrti (SP.2.3.5.26), 
remembered herself as Sati, who had cast off her body in anger at her 
father DakÆa's disrespect for Siva (SP.2.3-4-31). Before her yoga fire 
engulfed her, however, Sati had told DakÆa that she could be found 
at any time, any place, in every being; there was nothing in the uni­
verse in which she could not be found (MP . 13.24). Yet Siva could not 
find her or peace anywhere. He made a garland of her bones. Like 
one who was not a god he wailed aloud; like a lover he spoke in a man­
ner disordered by the pain of separation (SP .2.3+37-39). Although 
the Supreme Lord by his power of illusion had taken upon himself 
madness and pain, yet he is really unaltered, undistressed, and un­
conquered. Through any change in form whatever he is untainted by 
maya; what use has he for love and delusion? (SP.2.3+40-41 ). 
2. SIVA AND PARVATI 
a. The Goddess Night 
In the meanwhile, the demon Taraka oppressed the gods, laid waste 
the celestial world, and invaded the sky-high mountain. No one, no 
god, had been able to subdue Taraka, for he was a great ascetic and 
by his asceticism he had won the boon from Brahma: Taraka would 
be defeated by an infant seven days old; but his slayer was not yet 
born. The slayer of Taraka was to be born as Siva's son (MP . 1 54.33- ' 
38, 47-49). 
In due course the Great Goddess as Parvati was born from Mena; 
she cried like any newborn child. Although the little girl soon played 
with balls and dolls, the knowledge of her previous birth came to her 
(SP.2·3·7· 1 ,  22, 24)· 
Parvati had privileges of birth similar to those of Sati. In addition, 
she had all the knowledge of the world of the gods (who acted like 
human beings), which Sati had not acquired in her short life. The 
lineage of her family, however, was different from that of Sati's. 
Dakia was a son of Brahma, the Creator, whereas Parvata's original 
state lay far back, before the rule of the gods began and before the 
Asuras, tଇe Titans, had become demons. One feature that these two 
incarnations of the Great Goddess had in common was the darkness 
that showed in their complexion, which they lଈrgely owed to the god-

35 0 '  F A M I LY O F  S I V A  
dess Night, whose name Sati's mother had borne and who, in person, 
had entered Mena's womb. On her father's side, Parvati was heir to 
the hardness of the mountain. 
The goddess Night, who had enveloped with her darkness Parvati 
while yet unborn, was to play a vital role in Parvati's relation with Siva. 
According to Brahma's plan, Parvati would practice austerities in or­
der to be united with Siva, and when united with him in marriage, the 
conjoint energies would be formidable. Even so, the destruction of 
the demon Taraka seemed improbable. The conjoint tapas of Siva and 
Parvati had to be made even stronger. With the help of Ratri, the god­
dess Night, their tapas would increase to a pitch of intensity at which 
their love making would create a son able to destroy Taraka. To this 
purpose the goddess Night was to interrupt the love making of Siva 
and Parvati by a quarrel between them. Siva would chide Parvati in 
jest on account of her dark color. Parvati would be annoyed and leave 
Siva to perform austerities in order to rid herself of her darkness. 
Siva, too, would practice tapas. After this interruption, heightening 
their energies, the son born of their union would destroy the demon 
Taraka (MP . 1 54.58-70). 
Brahma instructed the goddess Night to work on the increase of 
sexual power of Siva and Parvati by two means: tapas and quarrel. 
Their amorous enjoyment interrupted, their frustrated desire would 
demand even more compellingly to be satisfied. The quarrel itself, 
having heightened their emotional tension, would itself require fur­
ther tapas to be allayed.49 Then, with increased energy, their desire 
would bring together god and goddess in a union without compare 
from which their son, the victor over Taraka, would be born. In the 
plan of Brahma, the asceticism of the gods was meant to be subser­
vient to their role as the future parents of the son who would save the 
world. 
In order to make Siva engender a supergod, Brahma had to do 
more than merely command Siva, as he had done hitherto when he 
wanted Siva, the Great Yogi, to create mortals. Now, however, 
Brahma's concern was the survival and creativity of the gods. Both 
were threatened by the demon Taraka. A new god was needed, more 
powerful than Taraka, more powerful than any god. He did not as

yet exist and could be born only from the union of Siva and Parvati. 
Brahma's purpose had changed: Siva should not procreate mortals 
but a supergod to defeat an invincible demon. 
b. The Burning of Kama 
In making his plan, Brahma took part in the rila of Siva, in which the 
gods seem to behave like mortals. He took into account that tapas or 
asceticism can be practiced to more than one purpose. Parvati and 
Siva practiced austerities (tapas). The austerities of Siva, the Lord of 
Yoga, led him, in samiidhi, to the reality of his utter transcendency. 
The austerities, however, that Parvati would practice were not to lead 
to samiidhi, the abnegation of all outwardly directed activity and 
power. The strenuous discipline of will, though it was part of asceti­
cism, was not the whole of yoga and stopped short of its end. For Par­
vati, austerities were the means for harnessing escalating power to her 
one purpose, winning Siva as her husband. By tapas anything could 
be won-beauty, fame, and wealth in the world of man (cf. 
VmP.25.58) and in the world of the gods-and Parvati was certain that 
"desired objects are obtained by asceticism and there is nothing im­
possible for an ascetic" (MP . 154.290).50 She would even consume her 
body by austerities, for she had no doubt that by practicing tapas she 
would fascinate Siva and draw him to her. She would win the love of 
the Great Yogi and become his wife (MP. 1 54.289-92). 
Parvati grew up in her parents' home and conquered the whole 
world by her beauty and intelligence. Rii Narada read her palm and 
saw that one who was without father or mother, a naked yogi free 
from desire, would be her husband (SP.2.3.8. 1 1 ; cf. MP. 1 54. 1 76-
184), a description obviously referring to Siva (SP. 2.3.8. 1 3). None but 
Kama, the god of love, could bring about their union (MP . 154.207). 
Kama, who could bring down gods, sages, demons, and others by the 
side glances of a beautiful woman (SP.2.3. 17.20), should bring about 
the impossible and make Siva his victim. At that moment, lndra 
thought of Kama, who immediately with Rati, the goddess Lust, his 
wife, appeared before Indra. Charged by Indra with his nearly im­
possible mission, Kama, accompanied by Rati and by Vasanta

(Spring), went to the hermitage of Siva in order to disturb and inter­
fere with his unshakeable asceticism (MP.1 54.208-20; SP.2.3. 17. 1-2, 
28-43)· 
Kama, the god of love, entered a verdant grove on the mountain 
peak, where he found Siva seated in deep meditation in the hero pos­
ture on the coils of Vasuki, the king of the serpents of the nether­
world, holding the serpent's tail. Siva's long, matted hair reached the 
ground, where a skull and a water vessel had been placed. Terrible 
serpents, coiled and with their hoods raised, adorned his hair, around 
his ears, and encircled his body like ornaments. A lion skin hung from 
his shoulders. His eyes were half closed in a face of indescribable 
beauty (MP . 1 54.227-34)' 
The serpents of Siva, conspicuous at all times around his body, 
were assembled more copiously and significantly than ever when 
Kama was about to attack Siva. In full excitement, their hoods raised, 
they coiled around his ears. They were breathing fire. Siva held in his 
hand the tail of Vasuki, on whose coils he was seated, in full mastery 
of the king of serpents of the netherworld, who served as his seat. The 
serpent, a multivalent symbol, poisonous and menacing, implying 
death and sex, protected Siva's aloofness. He held the tail of the ser­
pent king in his hand and used as ornaments the rest of the serpent 
brood. They encircled Siva and guarded him, as their ancestor Vrtra 
had lain coiled around the cosmos before creation, and as a serpent 
spreads its hood above the linga in uncounted representations of the 
present day. 
Kama went right into Siva through his ears, and Siva'ssamiidhi van­
ished. But Siva exercised his yoga power and was again in samiidhi, 
while Kama, affected by Siva's yoga power, left Siva's body, stationed 
himself outside, and discharged his flower arrow at Siva's heart. A 
great flame of fire blazed from the third eye of the infuriated Siva and 
burned Kama to ashes (MP . 154.235-50; cf. MBh . 1 2 . 1 83. 1O. 3-5)' The 
flame of fire in the shape of a mare entered the ocean and began to 
consume the water (SP.2.3.20.2 1 ;  cf. MBh.7. 1 73.75 and insert 1464 
under n. 75). Rati, in distress, smeared Kama's ashes all over her 
body. She wanted to kill herself. While Siva consoled her by saying 
that Kama would be born again (MP . 154.259-74), he also rejoiced 
that Kama had been reduced to ashes, for desire (kama) leads to hell, 
from lust is born anger, from anger is born delusion, and because of 
delusion asceticism is destroyed (SP .2.3.24.27).

c. Seduction of Siva and His Marriage 
Siva remained in his mountain retreat for many years, practicing aus­
terities. When he came to the city Oiadhiprastha, situated within the 
kingdom of Parvata, the latter, on hearing of Siva's arrival, went to 
render homage to Siva (SP .2.3. 1 1 . 10). The Mountain King took with 
him his lovely daughter, exquisitely dressed. On their way through 
the forest they met the disconsolate Rati, who told her story. Parvata 
shuddered, whereas Rati's lament made Parvatl see clearly that death 
was preferable to a life of pain and frustration. These, however, could 
be overcome by practicing austerities, and she resolved to obtain Siva 
by her asceticism (MP.1 54.275-92). 
Siva was absorbed in meditation when Parvata-Raja arrived, offer­
ing flowers, fruits, and his daughter to serve the Lord. Siva saw Par­
vatl in her great beauty. Regaining control over his nascent passion 
and closing hisଉyes, he meditated on himself, the ultimate reality 
(SP.2.3. 1 2.1-1 2). Parvata, though doubtful, requested Siva's permis­
sion to come daily and serve the Lord. Siva broke his meditation. 
Opening his eyes he asked Parvata not to bring his daughter with him. 
What use was a woman to him, an ascetic, a yogi? (SP.2.3. 1 2 . 1 3-30). 
Parvatl, undaunted, addressed the Great Yogi: "Siva, you practice ar­
duous austerity because you have the energy to do so. That energy is 
Prakrti, the cause of all action. How can the Great Lord of the linga 
exist without Prakrti?" Siva was delighted by Parvatl's words and re­
plied, "I destroy Prakrti by great austerities; in my ultimate reality I 
am without Prakrti." Siva's words made Parvati smile inwardly, and 
she said, "Everything, at all times, is held together by Prakrti. What 
you hear, what you eat, what you see, and what you are are all the 
activity of Prakrti. 0 Lord, if you are greater than Prakrti, why do you 
practice austerities here on this mountain?" Parvatl, not wanting to 
argue with the Lord of ascetics and stating emphatically, "I am Prakrti 
and you are Puruia," added that it was only through Prakrti that Siva 
had qualities and form. Without her Siva was without attributes and 
unable to perform any activity. If he were really superior to Prakrti, 
he need not fear being near her (SP.2.3. 1 3. 1 -2 1). Moreover, her near­
ness would only stimulate and strengthen his yogic power of aloof­
ness. 
Siva as well as Parvatl was adept in the art of yoga. In their meeting 
they showed the effect of its solitary practice. Their nearness, more-

over, and her beauty were welcome obstacles that increased their tapas 
and also their tejas. It was the intention of Brahma to make Siva desire 
Parvati, and to see to it that Parvati should make her future husband 
become the father of their son. This would have been an obvious de­
mand had Siva been any man or god. To induce, however, the Lord 
of Yoga to behave like natural man was tantamount to making him 
abandon what he essentially was. 
Parvatl's words voiced the Samkhya viewpoint, whereas Siva upheld 
the Vedanta point of view (SP.2.3. 1 3.22). While Siva and Parvati were 
engrossed in their universe of discourse, Brahma assured the be­
sieged gods that Taraka would be destroyed. Brahma himself, having 
given Taraka the boon of a qualified invulnerability, could not de­
stroy him. Siva's cooperation was essential. If there were a son born 
of Siva, he alone could kill Taraka. Brahma was certain that Siva 
would marry Parvati; the gods would then have to ensure the descent 
of Siva's semen into parvatl. Parvati alone is capable of making Siva, 
who controls his semen upward, let his semen flow downward. No 
other woman would be capable of this. There was no time to be lost 
now for the gods to make Siva desire Parvatl as his wife (SP.2.3. 16.20-
35)· 
The battle between Siva, the ascetic, and Kama, fought in a sudden 
spring in the Himalayan mountains, continued within Siva himself, 
whom Kama had entered for a moment only. There, within the Great 
Yogi, the pendulum between self-control and desire kept swinging, 
the tremors of the one, the pull of the other, impeding, reinforcing, 
reciprocally acting on each other. They left unmoved the transcen­
dental reality of Siva. 
Kama had entered the world of Siva from the universe of Brahma. 
Kama had been the first effective power in the chain of creation. 
Rudra, the ascetic, the Wild Hunter, though obstructing the act of 
creation / procreation which is one in the Father, in his capacity of or 
identity with Agni had prepared the seed for the Father. Though an­
tagonistic to the uncontrolled outpouring or spontaneous generosity 
of the Creator, Rudra had prompted it. Rudra and the Father repre­
sented first principles. Only tenuously were they conceived anthro­
pomorphically. Their actions were mythical symbols that adumbrated 
and clarified the relation of the absolute, or Uncreate, to the creation. 
The Wild God who was from the beginning had to be "born" in order 
to take possession of the cosmos,. His cosmos became the scene of "the 

SI V A  A N D  p A R V AT I · 3 5 5  
divine play of the Great God which protects the world" (SP .2.3-4-36). 
Assuming for the sake of his devotee the role of god in the sem­
blance of man,51 the bearer of the seed and the yogi were one and the 
same, acting in a conceptually consistent, though logically conflicting, 
manner. A primary task of the yogi is the subduing of lust. Without 
desire, however, no conquest of desire can be undertaken. It is the 
stuff that yoga consumes. Hence its power. Siva is both the Lord of 
Yoga and the destroyer of Kama (MBh . 1 3. 1 7.5 1). Siva the yogi pre­
supposes Siva as Kama, the latter controlled by while sustaining the 
former. "Throughout the Pural).aS, the meaning of the conquest of 
Kama by Siva is undercut by qualifying episodes and even complete 
reversals: Siva burns Kama but is nevertheless sexually aroused; Siva 
burns Kama only to revive him in a more powerful form; . . .  and, the 
final Hindu complication, Siva is Kama."52 The dialogue between Siva 
and Parva!'ti was provoked by Kama, the emissary of Indra. He was 
sent from the universe of Brahma to set going Siva's play. Kama was 
doubly present in the play that had the seduction of Siva by Parvati 
for its theme: once within Siva himself, whom he entered if only for 
a moment through his ears, and again when he attacked Siva from 
outside (MP . 154.235-45)' In fact, once burnt to ashes and bodiless, 
Kama became omnipresent, existing "in the minds of all embodied 
creatures."53 
The discourse of Siva and Parvati, on the other hand, allowed the 
minds of those embodied creatures, who are Siva's devotees, to partic­
ipate in the divine play as if the Great Gods were human. Siva staged 
his play out of concern for his devotees (cf. SP.2.3.25.64), making 
them see in a vivid drama the coherent roles of the male and female 
protagonists who in reality are Puruia and Prakrti (cf. LP .2. 1 1 .3-4). 
Parvati herself told it to Siva, who at that moment was not in a mood 
to listen (SP.2.3. 13. 1 7-20). 
51 Siva explained to the Great Goddess that perfect knowledge, that is, consciousness 
that "I am brahman," was hard to find in the three worlds (S1'.2.2.23. 1 3- 1 4). There was, 
however, no difference. between devotion and knowledge (SP.2.2.23. 16). This conces­
sion allows for the statement made by Brahma: "Everything is a sport of Siva. The Lord 
I,ndulges in many divine sports. He is independent and undecaying" (SP.2.2.24. 16); 
SȠva Pura'(Ul (SP), tr. "A Board of Scholars" and ed. J. L. Shastri, 1973, 1 :385. The di­
VIne sports are his plays (lilii) which he stages and performs in anthropomorphic sem­
blance for the sake of his devotee. Through his lilii the Lord comes near to his devotee 
who is precluded from the consciousness, "I am brahman."

Parvati knew her own mind. Her determination was as firm as 
the Mountain, her father. Besides, she had the seductiveness of 
"Woman," her mother, who shared her name Mena with Apsarases. 
The beautiful princess Parvati became a yogini in order to win by her 
austerities Siva as her husband, so that their son would be born as the 
slayer of the hitherto invincible demon Taraka. Parvati was free from 
the failings of Sati, who had shown herself vacillating as well as obsti­
nate, when against Siva's counsel she went uninvited to DakÆa's sacri­
fice. Sati was also faint of heart; she had doubted Siva's ability to shel­
ter her from passing clouds. Worse than that, she doubted Siva's word 
in the episode with Rama. Nothing could make Parvati swerve from 
her path of asceticism. Her mind was set, with Siva in her heart. By 
her asceticism she would move Siva more surely than by her beauty or 
intelligence. Her austerities would lead Siva away from his asceticism; 
he would marry her and beget a son on her. She was firm in her par­
adoxical purpose. In vain did Mena attempt to dissuade her daughter 
from leaving the palace and going into the wilderness to subject her­
self to ascetic rigors. Fasting, Parvati stood in the summer near blaz­
ing fires; during winter she remained in icy water, meditating on Siva 
(SP .2.3.22. 1 7-27, 40-42). The universe and the gods were scorched by 
her austerities. Vi!iI,lu and the gods went to Siva, imploring him to 
marry Parvati and free the gods from the misery that Taraka caused 
them. Lord Siva should accept Parvati's hand in marriage (SP. 
2 .3.24. 1 3- 16). Siva, rising from his trance, answered: "If the goddess 
Parvati, the most beautiful lady, were to be accepted by me, she will, 
be able to resuscitate Kama on account of the marriage. Then all the, 
gods, sages and ascetics will become lusty and incompetent in the: 
great path of Yoga" (SP.2.3.24. 1 8- 1g).54 Still, though Siva considered, 
marriage a great fetter, he decided to marry Parvati for the sake of 
begetting a son (SP.2.3.24.60, 75). He had drunk poison for the sake 
of the gods, and would not disappoint them now (SP.2.3.24.70)' Siva 
played his role of prospective bridegroom to perfection rather than 
leave room for doubt about his love for Parvati. He himself was in the' 
thrall of his miya, and took refuge in his assurance of serving his devf: 
otees and furthering the welfare of the gods. 
He was swayed by Parvati, drawn to her as an ascetic and excited b· 
her as a woman. Siva decided to test Parvati's resolution (SP-' 
'4 Siva PUratUl (SP) , tr. "A Board of Scholars" and ed. J. L. Shastri, 1973, p. 566.

2.3.25. 16), the intensity of her asceticism, the clarity o f  her mind, the 
purity of her devotion, and her knowledge of himself. 
The fire of her asceticism had made all living beings shudder, so 
Indra sent the seven rÆis to Parvati. The seven sages told her that if 
she was attempting to have Lord Siva as her husband, she meant to 
obtain the unattainable: the passionless ascetic whose fire had con­
sumed Kama. The sages tried to dissuade her from her resolve to win 
by extreme asceticism Siva as her husband. They wanted to discour­
age her by describing the Great Yogi as "naked, ferocious, Dweller of 
the cremation grounds, the carrier of skulls, a hermit, statue-like in 
action, a beggar, mad, fond of collecting ugly and terrible things, and 
inauspiciousness incarnate . . . .  He is the wearer of a necklace of gory 
heads, adorning Himself with terribly hissing snakes, . . . moving 
about with his ferocious attendants."55 Did she think of gratifying sex­
ual desires or\getting any happiness with Siva in this and the other 
world? ParvatI replied that they did not know the Great God 
(MP. 154'3 1O-46). The disparagement by the p,;is only strengthened 
her resolve. 
Happy with the result of their test, the seven sages went to Siva. 
Taking his seat on an antelope skin, Siva was pleased to hear of the 
successful visit of the sages with Parvati. Straight away the seven sages 
called on the Mountain King and Mena, for, Parvati having stood the 
test, Lord Siva had asked for the hand of their daughter. The Moun­
tain King should now give his daughter in marriage to Siva in order 
to save the world. Parvata was overcome by emotion; Mena, however, 
was less certain about the wisdom of giving her daughter in marriage 
to Siva, whose only qualification, if it were one, was his asceticism 
(MP.154·379-80, 389-91 ,  406-16). 
Their mission fulfilled, the sages went to their home (SP.2.3.25.72-
73), and Siva longed to meet ParvatI again. Again he wanted to test 
her. Approaching her, he took the appearance of an.old ascetic and 
expressed his astonishment of seeing so beautiful a girl engaged in 
austerities in a forest. Light seemed to emanate from him. Parvati told 
him about her seemingly hopeless quest. In spite of her austerities she 
had not attained what she desired, and she wasjust about to enter the 
fire When the old brahmin arrived. She could not wait, and threw her­
self into the fire, which instantly became like sandal paste. Impressed

3 5 8 ·  F A M I LY O F  S I V A  
and smiling, the old brahmin wanted to hear the whole story 
(SP .2.3.26. 1-30). Parvati told him that she had sought to attain Siva by 
mind, by speech, and by action; she knew her object was very difficult 
to attain. The old brahmin advised Parvati to dismiss Siva from her 
mind. He knew him, the naked, ash-smeared, serpent-wreathed as­
cetic, the skull-bearer who married Sati, who killed herself. Parvati 
should not throw herself away on Siva, a homeless loner, whose birth 
was unknown and who was surrounded by ghosts and ghouls. He was 
completely unsuitable for her (SP.2.3.27. 1-38). Parvati agreed with 
the old brahmin's words. They were true; they described some of 
Siva's forms that he adopted in his divine play (SP.2.3.28. 1-3). Did the 
old brahmin mean to denigrate Siva? Exasperated, Parvati was about 
to leave when the old brahmin assumed the beautiful shape of the 
Lord Siva in which Parvati had meditated on him; he clasped his be­
loved (SP.2.3.28.36-42). She addressed him, the lord of gods, as her 
husband, for she knew her father would accept him (SP.2.3.29.7- 1 1 ). 
Then Siva, laughing lovingly, praised Parvati as the great power of 
illusion, the primordial nature (SP.2.3.29.20), and she declared her­
self as his devotee, his wife always in every birth (SP.2.3.29.32). At the 
same time Parvati appreciated Siva's different sports, while he re­
mained intent upon himself, the Ultimate Reality (SP .2.3.29.34). Siva 
allowed himself to be seduced into marriage by Parvatl's beauty, her 
mind, her asceticism, but more than these by her infallible under­
standing of himself in the macabre horror in which he clad his tran­
scendence. The tests were Siva's key to their wedding chamber. 
She returned to her parents, who received her with joy. Parvata eel· 
ebrated the return of his daughter by the distribution of gifts and the 
recitation of hymns. Then he went to the river Ganges for a bath 
(SP.2·3·30·5, 23, 25)· 
Meanwhile, Siva had assumed the appearance of a dancer. He was 
dressed in red, and carried a horn in his left hand and a drum in his 
right. He danced with great expertise and sang very charming songs. 
He blew the horn and played on the drum. It was an exquisite per­
formance. People came crowding into the palace. They all were en­
raptured and became ecstatic. Parvati swooned from a vision of Siva, 
his three eyes shining, his body smeared with ashes, wearing a serpent 
as his sacred thread and a garland of bones, and carrying his trident 
and all the other symbols. It was the unfathomable, ascetic god whom 
she desired. Siva granted her the boon to be her husband. Then the 

S I V A A N.D pA RVAT I

vision vanished, while the dancing beggar continued his perform­
ance. Mena, delighted by his enchanting dance, offered hiII1jewels in 
golden bowls. The dancer refused them. Instead, he asked for Parvati 
and started to dance and sing again. Mena was surprised and angry. 
In the meantime, Parvata returned from the Ganges and heard what 
had happened. Everyone wanted to drive out the dancer, but none 
could touch him who was like a great fire, shining and brilliant. Then 
the dancer showed his power to Parvata: he stood before Parvata in 
the shape of ViiI).u and changed into Brahma; he turned into the ra­
diance of Siva and Parvati. Then Parvata saw these shapes become a 
mass of splendor, undefinable in its formless expanse. And once more 
the mendicant begged for Parvati as alms. He accepted nothing else, 
and vanished. Himavat and Mena realized that it was Siva who had 
been there <!ild had now gone home (SP.2.3.30.26-S3). Though he 
had chosen the shape of a beggar, Siva danced before Mena a dance 
of enchantment. It swayed Parvati. Swooning, she saw the Great God 
who had come to her in his frightening beauty to ask her to be his 
bride. The vision vanished, but indeed the dancing beggar asked for 
Parvati's hand. When Parvata and all the others wanted to drive out 
the dancing beggar, he stood before Parvata as ViiI).u, changed into 
Brahma, changed into Siva with Parvati herself, and then dissqlved 
into sheer radiance. Siva's wizardry touched those on different levels 
of readiness for him, delighting Mena by the beggar's dance, while 
Parvati swooned on recognizing Siva in his macabre, ascetic shape. He 
enlightened Parvata by showing himself in his threefold divinity, his 
triple aspect of nameless light. 
In order to win Parvata's consent to the marriage, but to have that 
consent given with reservations,56 the gods requested Siva to visit Par­
vata and to make disparaging remarks about himself (SP.2.3.3 1 .9- 1 1 ,  
29)· Once more Siva appeared in disguise. Looking like a VaiiI).ava 
brahmin, a matchmaker, Siva went to the Lord of Mountains. None 
but Parvati recognized the god in his disguise.· The matchmaker told 
her parents that he had heard of the possibility of Parvata giving his 
daughter to Siva in marriage. He warned Parvata, saying that Siva has 
no support, no connections; is a beggar, ill-shaped, without qualities; 
. 56 If the lord of the mountain were to give his daughter to Siva with reservations in 
hIS heart about the marriage, he would not gain the fruit of his act immediately, and 
hence as a receptacle of many jewels would remain longer on the earth to the satisfac­
tIon of the gods (SP.2.3.3 1 .2-5).

dwells in cremation grounds, looks like a snake catcher; is a yogi, na­
ked, smeared with ashes, his matted hair unkempt; he is without 
pedigree, has a bad character, is ill-tempered; nobody knows his age, 
and he lacks good judgment. The brahmin stopped, and Siva, calm, 
the player in various divine sports, went to his own home 
(SP.2·3·3 1·31-S3)· 
Mena was disconsolate. She went into her "boudoir," took off her 
necklace and lay on the floor sobbing (SP.2.3.32.7). In the meanwhile 
Siva, longing for Parvatl, summoned the seven sages and sent them to 
Lord Mountain (SP.2.3.32.8-g, 34-36). The sages told the Mountain 
that Siva was the father of the universe and Parvatl its mother. Hence, 
Parvatl should be given to Siva, the Supreme Spirit (SP.2 .3.33. 1). The 
seven riis spoke the truth. Siva and Parvatl are the figures of Puruia 
and Prakrti, the eternal principles of creation. "Siva is the wife of Siva 
in every birth" (SP.2.3.33.46). When the seven sages left, the Moun­
tain sent out a letter of betrothal to Siva, and the wedding invitations. 
All the mountains and rivers came to the wedding (SP.2.3.37.4-S, g, 
41-42). The gods sent ଊii Narada ahead. He arrived at the thousand­
pillared palace of the Mountain King. It had been built by Visvakar­
man, the creator per artem. Great was Na,rada's surprise when he saw 
his own image made by Visvakarman. Narada was somewhat mysti­
fied, but, on entering the marriage hall, he was bewildered. Had Siva, 
seated on his bull and surrounded by his gal).as arrived already for the 
wedding? Had the gods, led by Viil).u, also arrived, and the sages and 
the other celestials? Narada could not believe that he had been duped 
by the magic of Visvakarman, who had made these true likenesses of 
celestial realities (SP.2 .3.4 1 . 1 - 1 2). By the illusion that the portraits in 
his palace caused, the Mountain King subtly and gracefully had taken 
his revenge on Indra, who long ago had clipped the wings of the 
mountains and deprived them of their ability to fly (SP .2.3.41 .23-29; 
MS. 1. 10. 1 3). Now the Mountain King showed Indra and the gods 
that wings were, so to say, superfluous. The gods were present in ef­
figy; they had come to the Mountain even before they had started out 
in the marriage procession of Siva. The Mountain King, aided by 
Visvakarman, had taken his creative revenge on Indra, who had de­
prived the mountains of their power to fly. 
Siva, having received Parvata's letter and accepted its contents, in­
vited all the gods to Kailasa before he started on his wedding proces­
sion (SP.2.3.39.S, 2 1 -22). The seven mothers undertook the rite of 

S I V A  A N D  pA R VAT I ' 3 6 1 
the decoration of Siva for his wedding. His usual attire became his 
wedding ornaments. The moon became the bridegroom's crown, his 
third eye became the beautiful tilaka on the forehead. The serpents 
around his ears became earrings studded with jewels, and the ser­
pents on other parts of his body changed into the ornaments of the 
respective parts; all were studded with gems. The ashes became san­
dal paste and other unguents; the elephant hide became beautiful 
cloth (SP.2.3·39·36-41 ). The elephant hide in particular lent itself to 
becoming a suitable garment for this occasion. It had belonged to an 
elephant demon whom Siva had slain (SP.2.5.57. 1 ). Gajasura, the de­
mon, was a voluptuary, and since he had not controlled his senses, he 
became evil (SP.2.5.57.25-26). Siva pierced him with his trident 
(SP.2.5.57.49).5erced, he asked for a boon, which Siva granted. Siva 
should wear the hide of the demon, purified by the fire of his trident. 
Scorched by the flames of asceticism, the hide did not burn 
(SP.2.5.57.58-61 ). Dressed for his wedding, Siva had a beautiful ap­
pearance extremely difficult to attain (SP.2.3.39.42). Starting out for 
the palace of Lord Mountain, "Siva appeared to be completely over­
powered by Kama like an ordinary man" (SP.2.3.41:5 1 ).57 
The marriage procession of Siva was nearing the palace of the 
Mountain King. Mena was anxious to see the bridegroom. She stood 
on the terrace, and Siva took delight in seeing her watching the 
procession, for he meant to delude her. The procession was arranged 
in groups. At the head came the handsome Gandharvas, richly 
dressed, riding in their vehicles with flags and banners. Groups of 
heavenly nymphs accompanied them. When Mena saw Mal).igriva, the 
lord of yak.$as, she took him to be Siva. She was told that he was only 
an attendant of Siva, and when the next god surrounded by his reti­
nue came within her sight, twice as splendid as Mal).igriva, she was 
similarly mistaken. Thirteen times more Mena was taken in by the es­
calating splendor of each following god with his retinue. Her happi­
ness and pride increased, became almost unbearable, until Narada 
announced the arrival of Siva. He was preceded and surrounded by 
his gal).as of wondrous shapes; and by bhiitas and pretas, elementals 
and ghosts who dispelled the proud anticipation of Mena. Some had 
the form of wind murmuring through the banners. Their innumera­
ble host showed, as was their wont, all the deformities one could think

of. When Mena saw Siva in their midst, she trembled. Seated on his 
bull, he had five faces, three eyes, ashes smeared all over his body; the 
crescent moon in his matted hair, ten hands with the skull in one of 
them; he wore the hides of a tiger and an elephant and held his bow 
in one hand, his trident in another. He had an odd number of eyes, 
and was misshapen and untidy (SP.2.3.43. 1-6 1 ). 
Alarmed, trembling, and burdened with grief, Mena fell to the 
ground (SP.2.3.43.62-63). When she awakened from her swoon she 
bewailed her fate and that of Parvati. The reward of her daughter's 
austerities was painful to look at (SP.2.3.44. 1-S); Mena wanted to cut 
off her head and run away (SP.2.3.44.22). The words of the sages 
failed to console her (SP .2.3.44.37-38). The Mountain King explained 
to her that Siva had many names and many forms. Did she not recol­
lect an earlier deception (as the dancing beggar) (SP.2 .3.44.42-4S)? 
Mena did not listen. She threatened to give up her life if the Moun­
tain decided to give their daughter to Siva (SP .2.3.44.S0). Parvati told 
her disconsolate mother that she had wooed Siva by mind, word, and 
action, and her mother could do as she liked. Mena, gnashing her 
teeth, seized Parvati and beat her. She threatened to poison her or 
throw her in a well (SP. 2.3.44.60-62, 6S). Mena ceased ranting when 
at last she was made to understand that Siva had many forms, both 
hideous and handsome, but she agreed to give her daughter to him 
only if he took on a lovely appearance (SP.2.3.44.90-101). Siva 
showed himself in his divine, compassionate beauty (SP.2.3.4S.3-4). 
Parvata and Mena started the marriage rites (SP .2.3.48. 1-2). Siva 
had to declare his lineage (SP.2.3.48.7). He was silent. Narada, know­
ing the reason, with his mind fixed on Siva began to play on the virta. 
The Mountain asked Narada to stop playing at this important mo­
ment (SP.2.3.48.8-1 1 ). Narada stopped playing and told the Moun­
tain that even ViÆl)u, Brahma, and the other gods did not know Siva's 
lineage or family (SP.2.3.48. 1 6). Siva was the formless Supreme Brah­
man; he was without attributes. According to his own wish he had 
qualities, a body, and many names. Even a wise man does not know 
him (SP. 2.3.48. 18, Ig, 2 1). The Mountain listened with delight, and 
Narada continued: Nada, the primordial sound, is the lineage of Siva, 
and Siva is identical with Nada (SP.2.3.48.2S-28). It was for this rea­
son, Narada said, that he played on his lute when Parvata asked to be 
told Siva's lineage (SP .2.3.48.30). This explanation of the mystery of 
Siva satisfied the Mountain (SP.2.3.48.31), for Nada, primordial 

S I V A  A N D  p A R V A T i · 3 63 
sound, is the basic momentum or "substance" from which the world 
is made. It is the protoଋype of sound, and the condition necessary for 
creation to take place. Akasa, ether 0; space, the firs҉ element of man­
ifestation, has sound for its quality (SS . 1 .70, 73; cf. SS .S.26, 2g). 
NoW the Mountain King and the guests at the wedding knew that 
the lord of the three worlds was seen by them face to face 
(SP.2.3.48.34). Parvata gave his daughter Parvati in marriage to Siva 
(SP.2.3.48.37). During the wedding rites, as the bridal pair were cir­
cumambulating the sacred fire, Brahma, the main priest, kept staring at 
Parvati's feet (SP.2.3.49.3-S). The same weakness had overcome him 
at Sati's wedding. This time the spilled drops of semen did not turn 
into threatening clouds of doom; instead, thousands of sages arose 
from them, the -yalakhilyas (SP.2.3·49·7, 34-3S)' They greeted 
Brahma, their father, and went to the mountain Gandhamadana 
(SP .2.3.4g.36-38). Siva, angered at first at Brahma's incontinence, as­
sured him that he had nothing to fear (SP.2.3.49.9, 46-47). Siva was 
benignly contemptuous rather than murderous, as he had been at the 
same occurrence during Satls wedding, when he had said that having 
killed the Creator he himself would create all living things, or he 
would create another Creator (SP.2.2 . 1g.S8-60). He had come to 
terms with the mechanism of Brahma's sexuality, which was lacking 
in the emotional, erotic overtones that Kama's arrows had released in 
Siva's heart. 
After the wedding, the time had come for Rati to bring Siva the 
ashes of Kama. Siva glanced at them with compassion, and Kama, as 
beautiful as before and wielding bow and arrows, emerged from the 
ashes (SP.2 .3.S 1 . 1-1S). Siva with Parvati returned to his mountain 
home. 
d. The Sons of Piirvati and of Siva 
i. Gal).esa; the Sapling of the Asoka Tree; Viraka 
In the groves and forest solitudes of Mount Mandara, the Great Yogi 
and the Great Goddess strolled and frolicked. They were young and 
carefree. As time went on, Parvati felt a longing for a son. Once, after 
having bathed, she rubbed scented oil and powder on her body. It 
mixed with the scruff of her skin and she shaped the matter into a 
human figure with an elephant's head. Then, out of fun, she threw 
the little figure into the Ganges, where it grew to such an extent that 

3 64 ' F A M I LY O F  S I V A  
it became as large as the world. Parvati called him to her as her son 
Ganga, too, addressed him as her son. The gods worshiped him; he: 
was called Vinayaka (MP . lS4.S00-SoS), and Brahma and Rudra made: 
him the head of the gaQas (Yaj. 1 .270). Thus was the birth of GaQesCl 
from Parvati. Though the birth of GaQesa is told in different ways be· 
cause of the difference in kalpas (SP .2-4- 13.S), GaQesa was born aଌ 
Parvati's son; Siva was his father only inasmuch as Parvati's longing 
for a son had arisen in her as Siva's wife. It was by her own effort thaI 
GaQesa was born from her body, albeit from its scruff. Some of Par­
vati's resentment that Siva had not fathered the child could have gone 
into the substance from which she shaped GaQesa. 
Creating GaQesa, however, did not altogether satisfy Parvati. Her 
longing for a son continued. This time she gratified her longing by 
planting a sapling of an aSoka tree, and she tended the young tree with 
great care. The gods rebuked her. They expected her to give birth to 
a son, but she disappointed them by her reply that one tree was worth 
ten sons (MP . 1S4.s06-1 2). Thus, for the time being, she assuaged her 
desire for a son. 
After this incident, Siva gently led her into his palace to play dice 
with her. Suddenly a tumultuous noise was heard, and Siva explained 
to Parvati that the lords of gaQas were amusing themselves. The gaQas 
had been humans who had won Siva's favor by austerities, fasts, celi­
bacy, and pilgrimages. They were powerful and dear to Siva; he could 
not live without them (MP. 1S4.S 14-2g). Their favored city was 
Bhogya, but they also chose other sacred cities, gardens, abandoned 
houses, bodies of demons, infants, mad men, and the cremation 
ground for their residence. They were addicted to music and danc­
ing, and some were naked, while others looked like deer or birds 
(MP . I S4.S30-4 1). They were like the Rudras of the Satarudriya hymn 
(cf. Ch. IV. 1 ). 
Parvati was especially attracted to one gaQa, clad in antelope skin 
and wearing a girdle of munja grass and a garland of stone heads, 
who was beating his arms with slabs of stone. He was held in great 
esteem by the other gaQas, Siva told her, for his wonderful qualities. 
His name was Viraka or Virabhadra. Parvati said she wished she 
could have a son like him. When would she be blessed with such a 
son? Siva said he, Viraka, would be her son and would call her 
"mother" (MP . 1 S4.S42-47). 
Viraka / Virabhadra, in an earlier Manvantara, had come into ex-

SI V A  A N D  pA RVAT i · 3 65 
'stence when Siva, in despair over Sati's death, dashed a bunch of his 
1 
_ 
hair against a rock. Virabhadra act଍d as Siva's alter ego and emissary, 
and destroyed Dakťa's sacrifice (SP.2.2·32.20-22, 47-58; 2.2·37·44-
46). In the Vaivasva଎a Manvantara, Viraka, thoଏgh still a child, had 
become a leader of Siva's gaQas. He resembled Siva inasmuch as he 
wore a garland of human heads. They were, however, of stone. Vi­
raka playfully also slapped his arms with slabs of stone. This distin­
guished him from other gaQas and attracted Parvati, the daughter of 
the Mountain or the Rock. Viraka seemed predestined to become her 
son, to continue the line of her own father, the Mountain or Rock. 
Virabhadra was closely linked with Siva, to whom he owed his exist­
ence, whether he appeared at the instant when Siva struck the rock 
with a bunchj)f his hair, or whether, as the embodiment of Siva's 
wrath, he emanated from Siva's mouth for the destruction of Dakťa's 
sacrifice (VaP.30. 1 22 ;  MB. 1 2, app. 1 ,  no. 28, lines 70-7 1 ). When 
Dakťa Prajapati at a different time held his sacrifice and did not invite 
Siva, Parvati objected to Siva and became miserable over his exclu­
sion. Understanding what was in Parvati's heart, Siva with his terrify­
ing attendants destroyed the sacrifice himself (MBh. 1 2.274. 18-35). 
Parvati, however, was not Dakťa's daughter and did not immolate 
herself in flames of love and anger when Siva was excluded from the 
sacrifice. 
GaQesa was Parvati's son born from her own desire and the per­
fumed scruff of her body (MP. 154.500-505); or he is said to have 
been born, as the result of Parvati's desire, from her dress and Siva's 
kiss (BDP.1 .60.7-32); or he was given to her as the result of a boon 
requested of KnQa by Parvati after she had praised and then beheld 
the Great God (BVP ,3.8. 1 ,  8-9). Viraka, on the other hand, was Siva's 
creation, and Parvati played no part in his coming into existence. Vi­
raka became her son by inner affinity and Siva's consent. Parvati 
seemed pleased, though in her inmost being she was dissatisfied. 
ii. Birth of Karttikeya 
Ardhanarisvara let the goddess step out from his total being. The 
Great Goddess discharged her power as Sakti, the Cosmic Goddess, 
who was born as Dakťa's daughter Sati and reborn as Parvati, the 
daughter of the Mountain. The Great Goddess and the Cosmic God­
dess are eternal presences. Sati and Parvati, her incarnations, were 
theophanies who for the sake of mankind acted out their destinies as 

366 • F A M I L Y  OF S I VA 
if they were mortals, in the presence of the Great God whose partners 
they were in his divine play. 
In whatever situation they met him face to face, they knew him in 
his ultimate reality, though they would doubt him, quarrel with him, 
or even denigrate him. In his love for them they felt the awful gran­
deur of the Lord as Time and Death, and his utter detachment as the 
Great Yogi. While they acted as if they were human, they were god­
desses, essentially the Cosmic Goddess and ultimately the Great God­
dess, his other half. He knew their tremors, for it was he who made 
them vibrate when playing on his lute, and he recollected them in his 
inscrutable smile. 
In assuming his roles, Siva had mankind-that is, his devotees-in 
view. The great performer and dancer remained wholly himself, 
though he varied his own role and created anew those of the principal 
players. DakÆa and his daughter Satt were personages widely differ­
ent from Parvata, his wife Mena, and their daughter Parvatt. Each 
character acted out his own destiny. It rested on his mythical past, of 
which he was the living symbol. The significance of their actuality was 
embedded in it, or the outcome of situations whose remembrance im­
bued the play in which Parvatt took the leading female part; Mahac 
deva remained the constant, principal figure, manifesting in whatever 
guise and mood his own ineffable, contradictory, and consistent, tran­
scendent presence. Satt, the Real, had been the first coming to earth 
of the Cosmic Goddess. Sat! maintained her divinity in her inborn deଐ 
termination to win, by the fervor of her self-imposed discipline, Siva 
as her husband. She had been separated from him from before her 
birth, and was driven back to him in yogic effort and ecstasy. She 
found him only to lose him, inasmuch as she acted as a human-a 
young, inexperienced girl, weak in faith though strong in tapas. She 
lost Siva through her lack of confidence in the word and power of the 
Lord, and sacrificed herself in flames of anger, hurt in her pride and 
love of Siva. 
As inborn as Satt's love of Siva was DakÆa's hatred of him. Satt car­
ried in her being the Great Goddess who had separated from, and al­
ways is, in Siva. DakÆa, Brahma's son, who had given his daughter to 
Siva against his will because Brahma had urged him (BhP.4.2. 16; 
SkP .7.2.9. 1 1 ), carried Brahma's resentment of his decapitation by 
Siva into hatred of Siva, his son-in-law. 
Satt's marriage to the Great God was without issue. It could not 

S I VA A N D  p A R V A T i · 36 7 
have been otherwise, for the love making of the Great Yogi was con­
trolled, his seed was drawn up; his sexual power remained contained 
·thin his body, and its substance was transubstantiated into the self-
WI 
, 
realization of the god. Sati, herself a yogini, knew and was with Siva 
when he desired her. When he was insami}dhi, she was in the presence 
of transcendence itself; she kept aloof. Siva had warned her to stay 
away from his motionless body. 
After the death of Sati, the Great Goddess was born as Parvati, the 
daughter of the Mountain and Mena. From her father, Parvatl had 
inherited the firmness of the rock. This was not any rock, not even 
the rock of ages, but that all-embracing rock which, in the myth of 
Indra, had held within it the cosmos-to-be. This possessive Mountain 
had kept within ଑lf the flowing light of the godhead. When the 
Mountain was shattered by Indra, the sun's rays and the flowing riv­
ers were set free. 
Parvati was not the only daughter of the Mountain. Her older sister 
was Kutila / Ganga, and the third sister was Twilight / Dawn, who 
merged with the Krttikas, the Pleiades. On her father's side, Parvati 
brought to her marriage with Siva the power of a hoary cosmic myth. 
Her sister Ganga was similarly endowed, and Siva was to face the ri­
valry of the two sisters in relation to him. Mena, their mother, the 
"Woman," was earthbound, being the daughter of the Fathers, the 
pitrs. She offered obstacles to Parvati's unconventional marriage. 
While she was enchanted by the mendicant Siva's dance and music, 
she was appalled and became rabid when Siva, in gruesome majesty, 
came to his wedding. Misjudging the total integrity of the Great God, 
she finally consented to give Parvati to Siva of lovely shape. 
Parvati before her marriage showed hardly any of the traits of her 
mother's character. Parvatl's strength of mind, will, and emotion 
equaled Siva's. She argued with him and held her own in metaphysi­
cal discourse. She won and held Siva. Over and above everything, she 
had a mission to fulfill: to give birth to Siva's son. For this purpose she 
had been painted black by the goddess Night while in her mother's 
womb. The goddess Night carried out a stratagem of Brahma. Par­
vatl's dark complexion had not disturbed Siva before their marriage. 
Rather, her dark beauty enchanted him. After their marriage, one 
night as they were lying together, Siva in his ashen white, unearthly 
sheen and the goddess embracing him, Siva in jest compared her dark 
arms to a serpent encircling a tree. Parvati resented Siva's words, spo-

3 6 8 ' F A M I LY O F  S I V A  
ken while the rays of the new moon were falling on her white gar. 
ment. She looked like the night of the new moon (MP . 155. 1-2) that 
shed its soma beams from Siva's locks on the goddess who herself is 
Soma, the elixir of immortality that suffuses Siva who is fire (cf. 
BP . 1 .2.27. 1 1 2 ;  cf. SP .7. 1 .28. 19). But neither her soma nature nor the 
moonlit peace around her assuaged parvatl. The Great God and the· 
Goddess quarreled, and infuriated, Parvatl left Siva to practice aus­
terities (MP . 155.3-23). She remained surrounded by fire in the 
scorching sun .of summer and stayed under water in the rainy season 
(MP . 1 56.8-1O). Brahma having granted her wish to acquire a gold 
complexion so that she would be an ornament in the arms of her lord 
(MP . 1 57.8- 1 2), she returned to Siva, who, after their quarrel, had 
been absorbed in austerities. Now they met and their love was 
stronger than before. In this respect, the goddess Night had com଒ 
pleted her task. They made love immeasurably for a thousand years 
according to the reckoning of the gods (SP .2.4. 1 .24) as if it were a sin­
gle night (KS .8,9 1). While the goddess Night had succeeded in height­
ening the erotic tension of the lovers, all that she effected was a 
change in the color of Parvatl, who shed her black complexion, thus 
severing her connection with the goddess Night. Thereafter Parvatl 
glowed in golden color, like Siva's son-to-be, whom she was not to con­
ceive. 
As no son had been born to Parvatl from Siva, the distress of the 
gods was great. The very purpose of the marriage of Siva and Parvati 
had remained unfulfilled, and the gods were helpless, for Taraka's 
might was based on Brahma's boon that none but Siva's son would 
have the power to defeat and kill Taraka. Brahma had also antici­
pated that none but Parvatl could seduce the Great Yogi to shed his 
seed in her. Kama's death and resurrection seemed to have been in 
vain. The gods were in an unthought-of dilemma. Only the issue of 
Siva and Parvati's conjoint power could defeat Taraka, but being en­
dowed with such power would he not be a threat to Indra himself, 
who had summoned Kama to bring about the union of Siva and Par­
vatl? And who would dare to interrupt the seemingly endless love 
making of Siva? The earth trembled under its weight (SP.2.4. 1 .44)· 
But if a son were born to Siva from Parvatl, the entire universe would 
be burned by the issue of their combined energy. He would vanquish 
both the gods and the demons (BVP.3. 1 . 26). The gods in their plight 
addressed themselves to Siva himself (R . 1.35.8-9). They asked Siva 

S I VA A N D  pA R V AT i · 36 9 
for the favor that he would not t;>eget a son in the goddess Vma. He 
should restrain his fiery energy. Siva agreed and drew up his seed (cf. 
R. l .35. 10- 1 3). From that time, according to the Mahiibhiirata, he be­
came known as urdhvaretas (MBh. 1 3·83.4 1-47), one more instance of 
a hysterOn proteron or inverted causality, for the Great Yogi had con­
trolled his seed all the while. 
All the same, the gods had had to interrupt this unending congress 
that left the world uncared for by Siva, and from which no child was 
born (R. 1 .35·6-7)· Moreover, the gods found themselves in a quan­
dary. According to the Siva Purii1J(l, their distress at being besieged by 
Taraka prevailed when they decided to approach Siva in the arms of 
Parvati in the bedroom of his palace (SP.2.4. 1 .61-63). But whether 
they were more frightened by the danger to themselves of the power 
of Siva's son should he be born (BVP .3. 1 .26), or by the threat to their 
existence posed by the demon Taraka, for whose conquest it was in­
cumbent that Siva's son should be born (MBh . 1 3.84· 1-2; MP. 154'47-
55), the outcome was the same. Siva rose from his love making, the 
seemingly interminable intensity of which in itself had been a threat 
to the world. Only Siva, the Lord of Yoga, in the fury of his love mak­
ing, could have held the semen within him (SP.2.4.2. 1 ). 
It was Agni the Fire who, on behalf of the gods, in the shape of a 
bird-a gander, dove, or parrot according to different accounts-had 
unobservedly entered the bedroom and disturbed the couple in their 
embrace (VmP.28.38-43). Siva got up and went to meet the gods who 
had been waiting outside, and after hearing their request, let his se­
men fall on the ground, where Agni in the form of a dove swallowed 
it (SP .2.4.2. 1-1 1 ). 
As Siva took a long time to return, Parvati came out, and when she 
saw the gods and heard what had happened, she cursed the gods 
(SP .2.4.2. 1 1- 1 7). Since they had hindered her in her desire for a son, 
they should have no offspring of their own (R. 1 .35.20-2 1 ;  cf. 
MBh. 13·83.48-49). Parvati indicated that Siva had desired to pro­
create (MBh. 1 3.83.49). This was what she must have wishfully been 
thinking. 
The curse of Parvati, entailing the childlessness of all gods and god­
desses, was but a continuation of Siva's refusal to procreate. She trans­
ferred to the world of the gods Siva's resolution not to create mortal 
progeny. Parvati, thinking in terms of mortal women, considered 
childlessness to be a curse. This was contrary to a view held even by 

3 7 0 ·  F A M I L Y  O F  S I V A  
Brahma himself about the descent of man. When Brahma first cre­
ated human couples, they hastened to sexual intercourse and had no 
children except at the end of life, when they produced pairs of chil­
dren. They lived in heaven, without iniquity and strife. Thereafter, 
they fell from heaven and became passionate; the women conceived 
frequently, and in the course of time people became possessive and 
avaricious. Discord grew among them.58 Parvati, the Great Goddess, 
felt like a woman. Childlessness was her greatest sorrow; it made her 
suffer even more acutely than the interruption of her congress with 
Siva and the falling of his seed on the earth (cf. BVP.3.2.23-24). Ac­
cording to one version of the myth found in the Viimana Puriir:ta, Par­
vati, having pronounced her curse, went to take a bath. While rubbing 
her skin with scented ointments she made GaI).esa out of the scruff of 
her skin (VmP.28.56-66). At whatever phase of her married life Par­
vati created GaI).esa, it was an act of self-assertion against the disap­
pointment of her failure to have a son by Siva. 
The seed of Siva, which he discharged on the earth, leapt into a 
blaze of fire--{)r into the mouth of the Firebird. From this seed even­
tually Siva's son was born. He was to have more than one mother. As 
Siva's son he was called Kumara, "the young boy," eternally celibate; 
he was Siva's sheer essence. The name Kumara had been waiting for 
him by predestination: it was Rudra's ninth name given by his father 
Prajapati (Ch. V. l .a; SB .6. 1 .3. 1 8), and it heralded the new god, the 
glowing energy (tejas) itself of Siva, the one who is born from "that 
radiant seed surpassing the sun" (MD.43).59 Parvati was not the 
mother of Kumara. Her yoga power of seduction had failed to make 
Siva fecundate her, and had been instrumental only in arousing the 
Lord of Yoga. He controlled the emission of his seed until it spurt into 
Fire. 
Agni was exempt from Parvati's curse, as he was not present when 
she pronounced it (MBh. 13.84.8). Agni carried Siva's seed within him 
until, commanded by Brahma, he threw it into the Ganga, who car­
ried it until she too could bear it no longer. She deposited the embryo 
on a mountain, where the Kfttikas nursed it and adopted the child as 
their son. Hence his name Karttikeya (MBh.g.43.6-16; 1 3.84.8-13)' 
The child had six faces, as it had the six Pleiades as its "mothers" 
(MBh.g.43. 1 2). The seed of Siva had been carried by Agni and Ganga,

and the Krttikas nursed the child. All three daughters of the Moun­
tain were thus instrumental in the nativity of Siva's son: Parvati had 
stirred Siva but was deprived from receiving his seed; Ganga had car­
ried the embryo; and RagiI,li was merged with the Krttikas, who 
nursed the newborn child (MBh.g.43. 1 2- 1 3). Many more claimed to 
be his mothers (cf. MBh·3·213·1-2, 2 1 7·6-9), all by indirection, for by 
Parvati's curse all gods and goddesses were condemned to be child-
less. 
Siva's seed had been offered as an oblation into the mouth of Agni. 
Agni the Firebird was the altar for the offering. An altar in the form 
of a bird was Agni's ancient shape that received the Soma offering in 
Vedic times (SB . 10. D.l): Siva, having ଓoଔplକted hCs role as his wife's 
yogic husband, offered his seed by sacnficmg It not mto the fire of her 
womb but into Fire itself. On another occasion, Siva had offered his 
total self into the fire of his self-sacrifice. At that time, he assumed the 
shape of VaruI,la and offered his total self into creation; he offered 
his presence into all living beings. But, so that they should come into 
bodily existence, it was Brahma who offered his seed (Ch. X.A. l .c). 
From the seed of Rudra, however, held within his body while con­
sorting with Parvati for a thousand years and ejaculated into the Fire, 
his son came to be born through the aborted pregnancy of Ganga, 
Parvati's sister who had received Siva's seed from Agni (cf. 
MBh·g·43·6-9)· 
Siva had gone to the end of the yogic path of the retention of the 
seed under extreme erotic and sexual provocation. Had he not been 
disturbed, he would have continued the great copulation beyond even 
a thousand years of the gods. Disturbed by the Firebirdଖ he gave up 
being the Lord of Yoga and showed himself to the gods as sacrificer 
and sacrifice unto himself, for Agni is Rudra. 
Parvati, having cursed all the deities to be childless like herself 
(SP.2·4·2. 1 8), and having gone through an antithesis of the immacu­
late conception, made physical childlessness a condition common to 
all gods and goddesses. It was an empty revenge. Indeed, she was dis­
contented (SP .2.4.2.22). 
Siva's sexual asceticism had several degrees. He was a yogi who had 
no use for a woman; he was a married yogi who did not consummate 
his marriage but indulged in love-play and copulation. Being in­
wardly detached, he could afford to take delight in this relation with 
Parvati. He was, however, no longer acting as a yogi when his seed fell 

3 7 2 ·  FA M I LY O F  S I V A  
and spurted into the fire. On other occasions he acted neither as yogi 
nor as sacrificer when he let fall his seed. It happened through lovely 
Mohini (Delusion), and Siva himself had asked for it. The occasion 
was the Churning of the Ocean; after Siva had swallowed the world 
poison, the gods had won the elixir of immortality and the demons 
had stolen it from the gods. ViÆDu came to the help of the gods. He 
took the shape of Mohini-his form of seduction by which he also be­
guiled the sages in the Deodar forest-and by her charms won back 
the amrta for the gods (BhP.8.8.41-46; 8.9. 1 1-13). Thereupon Siva, 
who was accompanied by Parvati, asked ViÆDU to show once more his 
enticing shape. ViÆDu again became Mohini. Siva seized her and his 
semen fell on the ground. It turned into gold and silver (BhP .8. 1 2  .1-
3, 1 2-33)· From the seed was born Sasta / Aiyanar, the son of Siva and 
ViÆDu, and if ViÆDu in this context is taken as a proxy for Parvati,60 
the situation would be akin to the birth of Siva's son Karttikeya. Icon­
ographically, the image of Siva known as Harihara shows ViÆDU 
(Hari) on the left side, which is the place of the goddess in the image 
of Ardhanarisvara. 
Another time, Mohini provoked the fall of Siva's seed and Hanu­
man was born from it (SP'3.20'3-7)' The seduction of Siva by ViÆDU / 
Mohini as his female Power would amount to a progenitive self-se­
duction that the image of Ardhanarisvara denies. In these myths, not 
only was Siva struck by the arrows of Kama but Kama entered Siva; 
he even was Siva, while in the case of Mohin! (Delusion), Siva was 
swayed by her. 
The tremendous energy of Siva, the Lord of Yoga, that went into 
his love making with Parvati prepared the birth of Skanda. In the sub­
sequent shedding of the seed, Siva no longer showed himself as yogi, 
but as Fire. As Fire, he had prepared the seed for the Father. As Fire, 
he offered his own seed into Fire whence his son, his glowing energy, 
was to be born. 
The Mahiibhiirata was first to tell of the birth of Karttikeya, who in 
this ancient myth was born from the seed of Agni, the celestial Fire 
(MBh.3.2 14. 1-17). The identity of Agni and Rudra, explicitly reiter­
ated in the Mahabhiirata (MBh'3.2 1 8.27-30), pervades the myth of the 
birth of Karttikeya, born of one fiery essence impersonated by Agni 
and Rudra. Agni carried Rudra's seed and shed it without physical

contact into Ganga. The goddess, unable to bear the glowing embryo, 
deposited it on a mountain (MBh.g.43.6-9; 13.84.8- 1 2, 48-64). The in­
fant glowed in golden splendor; everything around seemed transub­
stantiated into gold (MBh. 1 3.84.68-70). In this way gold came to exist 
as the offspring of the god of blazing flames. Gold was the ingrained 
color of the son of Siva. Parvati, who was not to be his mother, had 
acquired her golden color through her tapas. Though the goddess 
had shed her darkness, and Siva and Parvati were reconciled after 
their quarrel, Parvati found other reasons to be discontented. She was 
jealous of Ganga, with whom Agni / Rudra had consorted and who 
had carried the embryo in her womb (cf. R . 1 .36.7-31 ). 
Agni in the Mahiibhiirat.!!:Jmyth was Adbhuta Agni, the celestial Fire 
(MBh.3.2 13. 1-2). He had come out of the disc of the sun and entered 
the sacrificial fire of the sacrifice of the celestial f!iis. There Agni saw 
the wives of the riis-the Krttikas or Pleiades (MBh.3. 2 1 3.38-42). (In 
the Deodar forest their astral meaning was not obvious.) Agni fell in 
love with the wives of the nis (MBh.3.2 1 3.44). And here the myth of 
the birth of Karttikeya begins. 
One day when Indra saw the sun rising over the eastern mountain 
and the new moon gliding into the sun at the raudra moment of dread 
significance, he saw the gods and demons fighting on the eastern 
mountain. The morning twilight was spattered with red clouds. Agni, 
carrying the oblations of the riis, had entered the disc of the sun. As 
Indra saw the union of the sun and the moon, their fearful conjunc­
tion, and Agni entering the sun, Indra thought it wondrous. And he 
thought of Agni begetting a son who would be stronger than any 
other god and who would defeat the demons (MBh'3. 2 1 3.26-36). 
In other words, the vision of Indra took place when the sun was in 
the Krttikas. Agni, the celestial fire, having come to the sacrifice of the 
riis, saw their beautiful wives and decided to become the household 
fire in order to be near them (MBh'3. 2 1 3.4S-47). Their union, though 
veiled in complications, impersonations, and substitutions, resulted in 
the birth of their son Karttikeya, so called after his foster mothers, the 
Krttikas. Thus, in the oldest allusion to the story, the leading figures 
are the celestial Agni and the Krttikas (SB .2. 1 .2.4-5). The latter were 
seen by Indra in a morning twilight spattered with red clouds. An an­
thropomorphic figure of this red dawn was Ragil)l, who merged with 
the Krttikas, the Pleiades (Ch. X.B. 1 ). Agni, in his rapid flight be­
tween the household fire of the riis and the sun, was in the sun and 

3 74 ' F A M I L Y  O F  S I V A  
the sun was in the Krttikas, or the celestial fire of the sun was in the 
Krttikas. At that moment the new moon was gliding into the sun. 
Though Indra saw all this, the moon did not figure any further 
among the complex events and transformations that preceded the 
birth of Karttikeya. The Krttikas were his first "mothers." Parvati, her 
heart aching in her empty body, stood last in line as a potential 
mother of Karttikeya. She was altogether absent from the earliest ac­
count of the prelude to the birth of Karttikeya given in the Mahii­
bhiirata. Though Siva also does not appear in this early version of the 
myth, his presence was prefigured by Agni. In the later Pural)ic ver­
sions of the myth, Agni played a role subsidiary to that of Siva, and 
the Krttikas became foster mothers or nurses of Karttikeya. Ganga 
was given her share in carrying Siva's seed, whereas the l<.ey role of 
Svaha, who in the early version seduces Agni by impersonating the 
wives of the riis (MBh.3.2 13.50-52), was discontinued in the later ver­
sion, which gave prominence to Parvati. The transfers and elabora­
tions of the roles of the participants in the birth of Karttikeya61 have 
their starting point in the vision of Indra, which took place, though in 
mythical time, at an astronomically definable moment. The spring 
equinox when the sun was in the Pleiades, can be assigned to about 
2300 B.C. The conjunction of the sun with the new moon further 
specifies the beginning of the month of the new year that started from 
the vernal equinox when the sun was in the Pleiades.62 
The myth of Siva as referred to the sun and the stars was seen in 
two of its most significant moments, at the spring equinox when the 
sun was in Aldebaran (Rohil)i) and at the spring equinox when the 
sun was in the Pleiades. More remote than these two significant "mo­
ments" is the rising of the vernal equinoctial sun, heralded by Sirius / 
Vastoipati, the Dog Star. 
iii. The Blind Demon King 
Once while Siva was sporting with Parvati on Mount Mandara, she 
covered in jest with her golden, coral-like hands the three eyes of Siva. 
Immediately the ' cosmos was steeped in blinding darkness. Her

hands, resting on Siva's forehead, perspired from the heat of the fire 
of Siva's third eye; the ruttingjuice from her hands was heated by the 
fire in Siva's forehead. A terrible creature was conceived. It was an­
gry, black, with matted hair, anଗ blind. It sang, cried, laughed, 
danced, and stuck out its tongue. Siva told Parvati, "you did this by 
closing my eyes, 0 my beloved, why are you afraid of it?" Parvati, 
however, could not understand how and why such an ugly creature 
had come into existence. Siva explained that the revolting and im­
mensely powerful creature was born of his sweat, and that Parvati was 
the cause of the creation of that being. His name would be Andhaka, 
"Blind." Parvati would be responsible for his safety and well being: he 
was her own son (SP_1S.42 . 1 S-26; SP, DhS·4.4-14). 
At that time the demon king Hiral).yakia or Gold Eye, who had re­
mained childless and whose wife pined for a son, subjected himself to 
rigorous austerities in order to see Lord Siva. Siva, pleased by the self­
control and self-abnegation of the demon king Gold Eye, granted him 
the boon of a son who would inherit the kingdom of the demons. 
Hiral).yakia was granted a son by adoption. It was Andhaka whom 
Siva gave to Gold Eye as his son (SP.2.S.42.28-40). Siva, however, 
warned King Gold Eye: should Andhaka attempt vile deeds or covet 
the Mother of the Universe, Siva himself would "purify" Andhaka's 
body. Nor could Andhaka obtain Parvati without defeating Siva 
(VmP·37·6- 16). 
The demon king did not Jive long. He was killed by Viil).u, 
(SP.2.S.42.49) and Andhaka as his son became the new, immensely 
powerful king of the demons. The royal demon family resented 
Andhaka's kingship, for he was king by adoption only. Andhaka, 
though he appeased his paternal cousins, the sons of demon Hiral).ya­
kasipu (Gold Cloth), he went to a forest where he underwent auster­
ities more severe than any other god or demon could perform. Not 
only did he stand on one leg with his arms raised continuously, but 
every day he offered a piece of his flesh together with his blood into 
the sacred, blazing fire. When nothing but his bones were left and he 
was about to offer his bloodless skeleton to the fire, he was seen by the 
gods. They were frightened, as the power of these austerities threat­
ened their existence, and Brahma immediately offered Andhaka a 
boon: he could have whatever was very hard to get in the universe. 
Andhaka said that, being blind, he wanted divine vision and death­
lessness. Neither gods-not even Viil).u and Siva-nor demons, Gan-

3 7 6 · FA M I LY O F  S I V A  
dharvas, ya٠as, serpents, or anyone should be able to kill him. 
Brahma explained that there was no immunity from death for anyone 
born in any way. Andhaka modified the boon he desired and formu­
lated it in terms that surprised Brahma. Andhaka said, "who is the 
most excellent woman of all time, whether old, middle-aged, or 
young, shall be like a mother to me, even though she be unapproach­
able to all men in body, mind, and speech. Let me be destroyed if I 
desire her" (SP.2.5.44. 1-16). Andhaka expressed the oedipal death 
wish that Siva hact foreseen because he had willed it. 
Brahma granted the boon. Then, at Andhaka's request, he restored 
Aesh and blood to Andhaka's skeleton body. The demon king forth­
with proceeded with his conquering army all over the earth. He lived 
the life of a demon king, full of pride and sex. He had every woman 
he wanted. He conquered the whole world, built a city on the Man­
dara Mountain, and gradually made people settle there. Once, his 
ministers saw a strange hermit in a mountain cave. The crescent 
moon adorned his head, he wore an elephant hide, serpents coiled 
around his body, and his necklace consisted of skulls. He held a tri­
dent, arrows, quiver, bow, and a rosary. Ashes were smeared over the 
splendor of his four-armed body. The ministers noticed a white bull 
nearby. They also saw a beautiful woman in the splendor of her youth 
and covered with jewelry. All this the ministers reported to Andhaka. 
He trembled with lustful anticipation and sent his emissaries back to 
the hermit with the order that the hermit should give his wife to 
Andhaka. The demon king's ministers taunted the hermit about the 
incongruity of his appearance, his absorption in performing austeri­
ties, and the presence of his ravishing woman companion. The hermit 
should surrender his weapons and carry on his austerities. Smilingly, 
Siva revealed his identity to the ministers (SP.2.5.44. 1 8-57). 
Although some time had passed since the birth of Karttikeya, Siva 
now resolved to practice tapas (or the Pasupata vow, as others say) in 
order to restore the energy and vitality he had lost in his endless love 
making with Parvati (VmP.34.2-3; SP.2.5.45. 1 1- 1 3). When urged to 
give Parvati to the demon king, Siva said that the fiend could take 
whatever pleased him at the moment (SP.2.5.44.60). Andhaka had 
said that the daughter of the Mountain should be given to him, but 
she could do as she pleased. He had no power over her (VmP .40.45-
49). Parvati remarked that Siva and Andhaka were gamblers in a 
game of life, and whoever won would get her (VmP .4°.5 1 ). Siva stood 

S I V A  A N D  pA R V A T I 
• 3 7 7  
quietly. Then, in order to carry out the great auSterities by which Par­
vati would be free from sorrow, he left for the divine (Deodar) forest 
(SP .2·S·4S· 13)· 
The description of Parvati by Andhaka's ministers had inflamed the 
senses of the demon king. In vain did a son of Gold Cloth named 
Prahlada who, though a demon, was a devotee of Viøl).u, attempt to 
dissuade the blind demon king from his infatuation. He told Andha­
ka his past. Parvati, the Mother of the Universe, was the wife of Siva, 
who was his father. They let their son be adopted by Gold Eye, the 
demon king. Siva, at that time, had warned King Hiral).yakøa that if 
Andhaka should covet the Mother of the Universe, Siva himself 
would "purify" Andhaka's body (VmP.37.3- 1 1). 
Prahlada's words had no effect on blind Andhaka, blinded also by 
lust and arrogance. He rushed with his army to the Mountain cave 
where Parvati stayed during Siva's absence, guarded by Viraka, her 
son. Andhaka attacked Viraka. Frightened, Parvati thought of 
Brahma, Viøl).u, Indra, and the other gods. They came, having as­
sumed female appearance, as it would have not been seemly for the 
gods to enter the cave where the goddess resided (SP .2.S.4S. 16-27). 
Or, in another version of the myth, it was Parvati herself who took up 
a hundred forms in fear of the demon king (VmP.33.34). Parvati, 
blazing with fury, and standing among the hundred goddesses, set 
out herself with a vast army of divine women in whose velocity thou­
sands of powerful currents were let loose, and Andhaka was repulsed 
(VmP'33.3S-40). Siva, having performed the Pasupata vow, returned 
and embraced Parvati. She dismissed the many goddesses. Blind 
Andhaka, who had not been able to recognize Parvati, sent an emis­
sary to Siva challenging him as one who was not a true ascetic but only 
an enemy, and ordering him to surrender Parvati. Siva invited 
Andhaka to fight with him (SP.2.S.4S.42-S I). 
Although the army of the demons was kept intact by Sukra's science 
of resuscitation (saiifivani vidyii) (VmP .43.6-8), Nandin captured Sukra 
and brought him to Siva, who swallowed him, ejaculated him through 
his penis, and made him his son (VmP.43.26-43; cf. Ch. VI.4.a). Siva 
then produced Yawn and, infested by it, the demons opened wide 
their mouths and those gods whom they had swallowed came out; the 
army of the demons was defeated (VmP ,43.63-68). Siva danced, whirl­
ing his eighteen long arms; he meditated, worshiped the sun, and 
danced, joined by his gal).as and the gods. Then he performed the twi-

3 7 8 ·  FA M I L Y  O F  S I V A 
light worship (sandhyii) and danced to the utmost of his desire. He was 
again ready to fight with Andhaka (VmP .43.69-74). The demon king, 
seeing his army defeated and Siva invincible, had lost none of his lust 
for Parvati (VmP .43.75-78). He thought of a ruse that would subject 
Parvati to his desire. He would delude her by assuming the shape of 
Siva, and enjoy her body. Andhaka ordered the demon Sunda to as­
sume the shape of Nandin. Both he and Nandin appeared covered 
with wounds fresh from the recent battle (VmP .43.79-82). Parvati, 
seeing Siva and Nandin wounded and coming to her apartment, 
made her maids bring dressings and ointments; tending Siva's 
wounds, she failed to see the bull marks on his sides, knew that she 
had fallen victim to a deception, and ran away in fear (VmP.43.83-93). 
Andhaka, blind as he was with passion and by birth, pursued her but 
could not catch up with her, for she had vanished into a radiant, white 
arka flower. Andhaka resumed his own shape and returned to his" 
army (VmP'43'94-97). 
Parvati, taking refuge in an arka flower, took refuge in Siva. 
Though the significance ofthearka plant is not dwelt upon in thePurii-' 
tuJs, it was ancient knowledge that the arka tree stood for Rudra. It: 
had sprung from Rudra's resting place (SB .g. I . I .g), and was consub­
stantial with him. It sustained Rudra with its own life sap; it was the 
sacrificial food offered to Siva ritually in the Satarudriya sacrifice. 
When the God stood flaming on the altar longing for food, the gods 
gathered food for him. They offered wild sesamum to him by means 
of an arka leaf (SB.9. 1 . 1 . 1-8). The leaf on which the food was offered 
and the food were looked upon as one. They were the offering for 
Agni / Rudra, to be consumed by him. They became one with him, 
and he revealed himself as "Agni, the arka" (SB . 1O.3.4.5). 
While Parvati found refuge in the arka flower, the fiercest battle be­
gan to rage between the gods and the demons. Finally, only Siva and 
Andhaka were left on the battlefield (VmP.44. 19-22). Siva pierced the 
heart of Andhaka with his trident (Vmr44.27). Andhaka was impaled 
on the trident that Siva held aloft, high up in the air (VmP .44.39). The 
lower half of Andhaka's body was dried up by the rays of the sun, the 
upper half was drenched by the downpour of the clouds; his flesh 
withered (SP.2.5.46.38). Yet the demon Andhaka did not die. For a 
thousand years of the gods he remained impaled on Siva Bhairava's 
trident, his body dried up by Siva's eyes that are sun and fire 
(VmP .44.49). Having lost his demon kingdom and his demon nature 

SI VA A N D  pA R V AT I · 3 7 9 
(SkP .6.:2g.26), ဈhe demon king became pure and free from sin bဉ .the 
fire of Siva's (third! eye (VmP .44.50). On the stake held aloft by Siva, 
Andhaka praised Siva and cried out for protection, saying, "I am a 
sinner," and "I was born in sin." . . .  "Do not be angry wညth me, 0 Lord 
of gods. You made me this waဋ." . . .  "Protect me. I have come to you 
for refuge" (VmP·44·51 -66). Siva, pleased with Andhaka, let him 
choose any boon he liked except Parvati (VmP .44.67-68). Andhaka re­
plied that Parvati w,as his mother and Siva his fathဌr, and chose the 
boon of becoming Siva's devotee (VmP .44.69-7 1). Siva, the ocean of 
compassion, made him a chieftain of his gal)as named BhfIlgi 
(VmP.44.72; SRh'5.46.39). He took Andhaka off the trident and, hav­
ing passed his hands over Andhaka's body, made him whole again 
(VmP.44.73). Siva, accompanied by Andhaka and Nandin, returned 
to his mountain home, where he saw the daughter of the Mountain in 
the white arka flower (VmP.44.84-85). She left the flower. Siva em­
braced her and presented to her Andhaka, her son (VmP.44.86-8g). 
He praised the Great Goddess, and she asked him to choose a boon. 
Bhrngi said; "0 Parvati, let my sins come to an en'ct. 0 mother, let me 
be devoted to Siva in eternity" (VmP.44.91-93). Thus, Siva in his ter­
rible form of Bhairava transformed the foremost demon into Bhrngi 
due to his devotion. 
Andhaka, hideous, black, and blind, owed his existence to a care­
free, careless, playful, impulse of Parvati. She covered thဍ three eyes 
of Siva and darkness set in. Once already she had played a similar 
game. She covered Siva's two eyes. As their light went out, Siva 
opened a third 'eye that none had seen before. The fire of destruction 
shot out from the middle of his forehead, soared to heaven, and con­
sumed the Himavat Mountain, Parvati's father. Siva, however, out of 
compassion restored the Mountain and he forgave Parvati her lack of 
foresight (MBh. 13.1 27.26-38). Parvati had failed to understand that 
the slightest obstruction caused to Siva's body would have cosmic con­
sequences. In this instance, Siva restored the damage that had been 
done by his spontaneous, fiery outbreak, and he restored Parvati"s 
confidence. It was a childish prank that could have destroyed the 
World. Instead, it released into the cosmos Siva's power of destruction 
that was to clean the world from obsolescence and dross, and make 
possible a new beginning after the end of days. Moreover, it gave to 
Siva his unique cognizance, the vertical third eye in the middle of his 
forehead. Artists first rendered this cognizance of Siva by showing the 

38 0 · F A M I LY O F  S I VA 
third eye horizontally in the middle of the forehead. God Indra was 
also shown with the third eye, placed horizontally, in the middle of 
the forehead. Indra's third eye was but a singularization of the thou­
sand eyes that had come to cover his entire body. These represented 
multiples of the physical organ, the eye (or also the vulva-but this 
latter significance has no bearing here), and like the eye their position 
was horizontal, whereas Siva's third eye, in post-KuøaQa sculptures, 
cut across the horizontal extent of the forehead and of the physical 
plane. Siva's third eye was an outlet of the fire within himself, which 
he sent forth into the cosmos as the power of destruction / creation. 
When Parvatl covered with her coral-like hands the three eyes of 
Siva, her hands were heated by the fire of Siva's third eye. The per- . 
spiration from her hands and the heat from Siva's forehead commin­
gled, and from this Andhaka issued, blind, dark, hairy. The hideous 
creature showed himself to be Siva's son. He danced, sang, laughed, 
and cried as Siva did at times. He had the excessive intensity of Siva's 
disposition. And he was furious. But it was Parvati who had caused 
him to come into existence by closing Siva's eyes. By her frowardness, 
the light and fire within Siva that keep the universe alive were oc­
cluded within Siva. His forehead broke out in a sweat of frustration, 
anger, and nascent sexual excitement. Hideous Andhaka, more intiဎ 
mately than any other being, became the son of Siva and Parvatl, hav­
ing been born from the direct touch and sweat of his parents. This 
scion of the two greatest divinities, in his ugly deformity, had no rea­
son to be grateful to his parents, or to his mother in particular, who 
had provoked his coming into existence. 
By demoniac coincidence, Gold Eye, the childless demon king, ex­
erting himself in austerities in order to have a son, gave Siva the op­
portunity of granting his wish by giving blind Andhaka to Gold Eye 
as his adopted son. Siva knew why he gave Andhaka away to be 
adopted by the demon king. He knew Andhaka's vicious might, of 
which Andhaka's lusting after his mother was part. By making his son 
over to the demons, Siva placed him where he belonged. It was the 
proper place from which Andhaka could exercise his power, and 
through which Siva could lead into sin and later redeem his ill-begot­
ten son. 
The adoption by Gold Eye did not clear Andhaka's vision. Born 
blind, he became blind with passion and blind with arrogance. 
Though adoption had made Andhaka legitimately the son of Gold

Eye, Andhaka's cousins did not fully accept him and made him feel 
that his origin lay elsewhere than in the demon kingdom. Andhaka 
then subjected himself to self-immolating austerities, honing his body 
until only his skeleton was left. By this extreme yogic discipline he 
took revenge on himself for not being accepted as the scion of Gold 
Eye, and he took revenge on his original parents, particularly on Par­
vatl, who had caused his plight. Born with the qualities of a demon, 
though himself of the highest divine descent, Andhaka was adopted 
by the king of demons, thus legally having the status of a demon, yet 
spurned by his demon family. Finding himself in this impossible sit­
uation, he meJ.t to achieve the impossible. The gods were frightened 
for their own sake by his terrific penance, and Brahma offered him 
the boon that indeed he could attain whatever was inaccessible. 
Andhaka being blind and of divine origin, wanted divine vision. He 
wanted to be exempt from death, but this Brahma could not grant 
anyone. Then by his own impulse Andhaka formulated the boon he 
craved: the most excellent woman in the world should be like a 
mother to him, though she be unapproach<i,ble to any man. Should, 
however, Andhaka covet her, he should be destroyed. Unwittingly, he 
had repeated the warning Siva gave when he made over Andhaka to 
Gold Eye for adoption. 
Hideous, black, blind Andhaka acted out his destiny. Born through 
an act of indiscretion on the part of his mother, abandoned by both 
parents, and made over by Siva to the demons, where by looks and 
disposition he belonged, legally confirmed in his new status but re­
pudiated by his new family, Andhaka in anguish longed for a mother 
of supernal perfection, and desired her who was unapproachable. As 
king of the demons, Andhaka had any woman he wanted. 
Nearly giving himself away in asking for his boon, he pulled himself 
together and added, to Brahma's surprise, his wish to be destroyed 
should he covet his mother. His wish for destruction overwhelmed 
him. As powerful in his kingdom as he was desperate in his life, he 
longed for his divine mother who abandoned him after having caused 
his blindness and ugliness. He wanted divine vision. Brahma granted 
Andhaka's wish de profundis. He also restored his body. 
The blind demon king, having conquered the three worlds and en­
joyed all they had to offer, stayed in his new city in the Himalayas and 
heard from his ministers about an uncanny hermit and a most beau­
tiful woman who stayed near him. Their description of the woman 

3 8 2 · FA M I LY O F  S I VA 
aroused in him an insane desire for her. He refused to listen to hiS 
cousin Prahlada, who informed Andhaka about his own past as it haဏ 
settled down in and disturbed the recesses of his mind. Andhaka in;" 
sisted on demanding the beautiful woman from the strange yogi, who; 
was Siva. Immersed in the observance of the Pasupata vow, Siva let: 
Parvati decide for herself her response to the demon's demand. It was 
somewhat cynical, but Siva trusted Parvati to stand on her own, which 
she did, for she had all the power of the Great Goddess, and it assisted 
her in the shape of all the women that the gods had become in order 
to defend her when Andhaka and his soldiers drew near her cave 
guarded by Viraka. When Siva returned, having fulfilled the Pasu­
pata vow, Andhaka in his blindness did not see him, nor could he in 
his blind lust discern Parvati amid the waves of divine femininity 
whose impact engulfed him. In the ensuing battle between Siva and 
Andhaka, the army of the demons was defeated and Siva exulted in 
a cosmic dance, sinking into meditation whenever he paused. This 
was the moment when Andhaka, realizing that his army was defeated 
and that Siva was invincible in battle, decided to seize Parvati, disguisز 
ing himself as Siva wounded in the war. Parvatl, finding the body of 
the demon king without certain marks she knew to be on Siva's body, 
saw through Andhaka's deception, ran away, and escaped him. Blind 
and impassioned as he was, he could not reach her, nor could he see 
her. He resumed his own hideous shape and continued the fight with 
Siva, who impaled him on his trident. Though pierced through the 
heart, Andhaka did not die. Impaled, he meditated on Siva until his 
flesh withered away, and he praised the Lord until he was released 
from the great fear of his sin. Siva forgave his son his base lust of Par­
vatl (SP .2.5.49.4-20; VmP .44.72). At last he could worship Parvatl and 
pray to the mother that he be eternally Siva's devotee (VmP -44.90-93). 
Andhaka, pierced in his heart, impaled on the trident of Siva, and 
reduced to a skeleton was not the same Andhaka who by his tremen­
dous demonic energy practiced austerities in order to obtain the boon 
from Brahma that astounded even the Creator. Andhaka then had 
cut off all his flesh and drained away his blood until only a skeleton 
remained. The boon he desired was complex: divine vision; death­
lessness; the most excellent woman, unapproachable to all men, as his 
mother; and destruction should he covet her. 
Impaled on Siva's trident, blind Andhaka in new austerities dried 
up until only his bones remained, but he did not die. He obtained di-

S I V A  A N D  pA R V AT I  • 3 8 3 
. e vision-he saw Parvati as the Mother. Along with his flesh his in­
uatiOn had dried up, and he had lost a demon's kingdom. 
Parvati, the cause of Andhaka's blindness, had confronted the 
sightless demon king in multiples, each a furious defensive shape of 
herself. He could not recognize her whom he coveted because he 
Ould not see her in that outburst of female power. He attempted to 
c 
, 
seize her by assuming Siva's shape, but blind by birth and passion, he 
could not catch her when she ran away and fled into a white arka 
flower. For all this blindness of his-by birth, lust, and pride-Andha­
ka should have died. He was saved by Siva's grace when impaled and 
withered; held aloft on Siva's trident, he meditated and obtained di­
vine wisdom.-Siva then took Andhaka to Parvati, his mother. 
Andhaka, of divine origin, had been destined to lead a tortured life 
of demonic lust, power, passion, rejection, ascetic self-destruction, 
and longing for divine vision and the .perfect woman, the Mother of 
the Universe who had abandoned him. Though he lived in darkness, 
divine vision and the Mother of the Uuiverse were his by birth. Ob­
sessed by demonic, unconsciously incestuous desire, he drove himself 
to his own defeat; his death was a purification by Siva, who had willed 
his redemption and return to his origin. 
Images of Siva together with Parvati (Uma-Mahesvara) and also of 
other forms of Siva include the skeletal figufe of Bhfl1gi. An etiolog­
ical myth identifies this figure with a ni of that name,63 unaware that 
Bhfl1gi, who had been Andhaka, was part of the "holy family" of Siva 
along with GaJ:lesa, Karttikeya, and N and in.

XI 
THE DEMONS 
1. DEMONS OF SEX 
a. A(ii 
Though Andhaka looked and acted like a demon from the moment 
of his birth, he was of divine origin and was led back to the gods. The 
demon had appeared spontaneously in consequence of an unpremed­
itated, playful movement of Parvati's hands. On another occasion, it 
was Siva who teased Parvati during their love making. She resented 
his calling her black and she left the house, only to have a demon en­
ter in her absence. In those tension-charged, amorous moments, the 
slightest dissonance released forces beyond control. A playful gesture 
or word during the love making of the gods brought about one de­
mon and attracted another. 
Siva had teasingly commented on Parvati's darkness one night as 
they were lying together, her arm like a dark serpent around his white 
sandal-treelike body. She also looked like the night of the new moon. 
As Siva called her Kali, "Black," Parvati withdrew from his embrace. 
Angered, she called Siva more than black, Mahakala, the great or 
transcendent darkness. Then Siva told her she was as hard as rock, 
like the Mountain, her father, cold as snow, and crooked like the 
winding Himalayan footpaths. Parvati rejoined that Siva, like ashes, 
knew no affection, that he lived in cremation grounds, shameless, na­
ked, fond of disgusting things, and wearing skulls (MP.155.1-23). 
Parvati hurled reproaches at Siva which before their marriage she 
had defended Siva against, not only accepting but enthralled by the 
inscrutably abhorrent traits of the Great God. 

·DEMONS O F  S E X · 3 8 5 
Brahma's dark scheme worked. Parvati took as a personal slight 
Siva's description of their contrasting colors that set off their separate 
and combined beauty. She exaggerated a possibly implied ambiguity 
and hurled its pejorative meaning back at Siva, overlooking in her ir­
ritation that serpents were dear to Siva and served as his ornaments, 
and that he wore on his head the crescent moon whose rays rested on 
her white garment. Parvati was leaving the palace in order to win by 
renewed austerities a golden complexion so as to be loved more truly 
by her lord when Viraka came running, imploring her not to leave. 
But she was firm in her resolve and spite; she instructed Viraka to 
guard the gate and not to let any woman enter in her absence, for Siva 
was covetoBofwomen (MP.155·24-34)· 
A<;li, a demon and son of Andhaka, learning that Parvati had left 
Siva, thought the time had come for him to kill Siva, who had ended 
i:he life and rule of his father, the demon king. A<;li ignored, or did 
not want to know, the transfiguration of Andhaka speared on Siva's 
trident. By his own austerities AA@ had won a boon from Brahma that 
he himself could not be killed if he did not change his shape. Anxious 
to revenge himself on Siva, he entered the palace unseen by Viraka, 
for he crawled in shaped like a serpent; once in the palace, the ser­
pent assumed the shape of Parvati. Siva at first was happily surprised 
on seeing her return, for his longing တas great. But when Parvati said 
she had returned driven by love, Siva realized that she had come back 
without fulfilling her purpose, and he knew the woman could not be 
Parvati. He also noticed on her body a clump of hair where Parvati's 
body had the mark of a lotus. Siva, seeing through the hoax of the 
satanic demon, fixed a thunderbolt on his penis that rendered inef­
fective the strong sharp teeth that A<;li had put into the vagina of his 
Parvati disguise. Siva killed the demon A<;li (MP . 156. 1 1-37). The real 
Parvati, engaged in austerities, heard from Vayu, the Wind, of a 
woman dead in Siva's palace and cursed rock-born Viraka that his 
mother should turn into a stone, without heart, inanimate, and rug­
ged, which Parvati craved to become (MP. 156'37-39; 157.1-2). 
Parvati completed her austerities, and her color became golden. 
Like a sheath the darkness had fallen from her, transforming itself 
into the goddess Night (MP . 157. 13-14). Parvati returned to·Siva's pal­
ace, revealed herself in her golden identity to Viraka, her son, whose 
innocence she acknowledged by modifying her curse. Siva quickly 

3 86 • D E M O N S  
made love to Parvati and did not desist for a thousand years of the 
gods (MP.158.6-28; cf. PP.5.41.1-12 1).! 
The sequence of events in Siva's married life varies according to 
different traditions. Thus, Gal)eSa is said to have been born before or 
after the birth of Karttikeya. On the other hand, the A<;ii episode took 
place before the birth of Karttikeya, and Andhaka was impaled by 
Siva after the birth ,of Karttikeya. A<;ii, however, is said to have been 
Andhaka's son, who meant to avenge his father's death on Siva. Each 
of the several myths is valid in its own right. They are strung together 
like manifold beads on a chain, some of more recent make, some an­
cient. Their colors and shapes may be gathered in one sequence or 
another, and enhance the figure for whose sake they have been as­
sembled. 
After their marriage, Parvati did not see Siva in the same light as 
that in which he had appeared to her before the wedding and in the 
long years of her ascetic life of readying herself for Siva and drawing 
him to her. Living with Siva, she became irritable when Siva lovingly 
teased her; or grew insouciant when she playfully touched him. From 
that contact of her hand Andhaka was born and, when she left Siva 
following their quarrel, A<;ii entered. Demons sprang from or entered 
into the erotic life of Siva and parvatl. Andhaka, their son, was re­
deemed by his inner conversion while impaled on Siva's trident. His 
son A<;ii found his death through another weapon, the thunderbolt of 
Siva's penis. Siva administered death to the demon by means of sex, 
a method the demon had meant to practke successfully on· Siva. Par­
vati had given A<;ii the opportunity to find his death through Siva. 
Having meant to kill Siva by deceitful seduction, he became the victim 
of Siva. The weapon that Siva used was his linga equipped with ada­
mantine power. The lethal power of sex was provoked in Siva by the 
demon's deceit and sexual fantasy. Kali's black color had set afoot this 
far-reaching effect. The demon had crept into Siva's apartment in the 
guise of a serpent; it was, however, Siva who had likened Parvati' em­
bracing him to a serpent coiled around a tree. This remark, offensive 
to Parvati, brought magically to Siva's apartment the serpent-shaped 
demon who meant to act as Parvati. In serpent shape the demon en­
tered his death chamber where, disguised as Parvati, he made love

with Siva. Siva did not see the serpent, he only saw the woman who 
looked like Parvati. 
A<;Ii's serpent shape appeared to serve his purpose; it was an appro­
priate disguise for entering the prထsence of Siva, whose ambience the 
serpents form. They surrounded Siva when Kama attacked him. He 
mastered their power. They functioned as his amulets and orna­
ments, they guarded the Uncreate. They were the protection of Siva, 
who is called the one who wears black serpents (SP.2.S. 1 3.26). They 
also were his weapons, his bow and arrow. KJ;øl)a and Arjuna saw 
these terrible snakes become Siva's bow and arrow (MBh.7.S7.72). In­
deed, the Pinaka, Siva's bow which is like a thousand rainbows, was 
really a mighty snake (MBh. 13. 14. 1 22). Protective ornaments or ag­
gressive weapon, the serpent belongs to Rudra. It is strong with an­
cient Asura power. Kavya Usanas, acting as the priest of the demons 
whom Siva attacked, tore out a lock of his hair and hurled it against 
Siva. From that lock of hai\,sprang many serpents. They began to bite 
Siva, and his throat turned blue (MBh. 1 2.329. 1 S). From VJ;tra, the 
serpent guardian of the Uncreate, whence also the demons received 
it, the serpent power had come to Siva. In the shape of KUI)c.lalini, 
according to the symbolic language of Tantra, the serpent power lies 
coiled around his linga in the l၌wermost cakra or center of realization 
of the body, which is associated with the element earth.2 The chthonic 
abode of the serpents and the region of sex are tantric symbolic equiv­
alents of the same center. In the sex myth of Siva and the demon Ac.li, 
the serpent with sinister intent made its way to Siva, but changed into 
the semblance of Parvati before reaching Siva, who killed the demon 
who had changed his shape twice. The bite of the serpent issued from 
a lock of Usanas turned into a mark that appears as an ornament on 
Siva's throat. This mark is also said to be due to the world poison that 
arose during the Churning of the Ocean (Ch. VI.S). According to 
some, the serpent Vasuki had spat the 'poison into the water. 
b. Piirvad's Ballgame 
Siva's linga was fatal to the demon by virtue of the thunderbolt power 
ostensibly added on to it, but in fact inherent in it. The adamantine

Archaeology, 1946, pp. 8-9, 38, and table I ;  M. Eliade, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, p. 
245· 

3 8 8  • D E M O N S  
power of the vajra or thunderbolt was, moreover, of a double nature, 
inasmuch as vajra in tantric usage signified transcendentally the aဒ 
solute, while also implying its other meaning of phallus.3 The latter 
meaning is obvious in the scene described in the myth, while the other 
meaning, though not inherent in the narrative, hovers over the 
crassly sexual situation. It was Siva's linga that annihilated the demon. 
The effectiveness of Siva's vajra linga in the A<;li myth looms at the 
opposite end of the urdhvalinga of the Great Yogi. Siva's deadly power 
of sex was activated against a demon attempting in the shape of Par­
vati to cohabit with Siva. 
The demons once saw her playing ball. She enjoyed the game, and 
two lustful demons got excited as they watched her. Parvati hit both 
of them at the same instant with one ball; they fell to the ground like 
ripe fruits or like mountain peaks struck by a thunderbolt, and the 
ball changed into a linga (SP.2.5.59. 1 6-27). The thunderbolt power of 
Siva's linga directed against demons by Parvati's hand protected Par­
vatl's chastity. The paradox of Siva's death-bringing vajra linga was 
centered on Parvati, who was saved from being raped by the demons 
through Siva's sexual power, which brought death to them. 
The episode of Parvati's ball game, which fatefully attracted the two 
mighty demons Vidala and Utpala, whose names but for this incident 
would be unknown, was brought about indirectly by Siva himself. 
These demons had harassed the gods; Brahma thought of Siva, and 
Siva sent Narada, the celestial sage, to the demons, singing the glory 
of Parvati's beauty. They responded by getting excited and resolved 
to abduct the goddess. The moment had come, so they thought, when 
one day, flying in the air, they saw Parvati playing ball (SP.2.5.59.2-
17). Siva played his own game, not far away from Parvati. He used 
her beauty as bait, and they both enjoyed the game. 
c. J alandhara 
At another and more crucial phase of the perennial battle of the gods 
and demons, Siva, indirectly through Narada, the celestial sage whom 
he commissioned, made similar use of Parvatl's beauty while she, on 
her own, went one step further and caused the death of Vrnda, the 
flawless, devoted wife of J alandhara, then the emperor of the demons 
and a "son" of Siva. The tragic myth of Jalandhara begins with Siva

casting off into the ocean the fire of fury of ?is third eye. Indra and 
Brhaspati had gone to Kailasa to see Lord Siva. A naked yogi with 
mဓtted hair and radiant face blocked the way. Indra, not recognizing 
Lord Siva, who meant to test their knowledge, asked the yogi re­
peatedly who he was and received no reply. Enraged, Indra threat­
ened Siva with his thunderbolt, and Indra's arm was paralyzed 
(SP.2.5. 13.4- 1 8). Siva mastered his rising fury; so that the fire of his 
third eye that was about to kill Indra should not hurt him, Siva cast it 
into the ocean (SP.2·5. 1 3·48-50). Instantly, the fire of Siva, born of 
the eye in the forehead and cast into the salt ocean at the mouth of 
the Gange,s, assumed the form of a boy. As the child cried terribly, 
Brahma <fescended from heaven. Although the Ocean could not tell 
Brahma anything about the origin of the child, Brahma said that the 
boy Jalandhara would become the emperor of the demons. None ex­
cept Siva would be able to slay him, and he would return to the place 
of his origin (SP.2.5. 1 4.4-28). 
Sukra (Kavya Usanas) performed the rites of coronation, and soon 
J alandhara grew into a handsome man and was married to V rnda, the 
daughter of the great demon Kalanemi. Jalandhara then ruled over 
the Asuras with the assistance of Sukra (SP .2.5. 14.30-40). 
Jalandhara ruled over the earth with justice and nobility, but he re­
sented the churning of the Ocean, his "father," whose treasure, the 
amrta, the gods had treacherously taken (SP .2.5. 1 5. 1 7-19). Hence, the 
gods were unhappy under Jalandhara's rule. Distressed, they sought 
Siva's help. Siva sent Røi N arada to act on behalf of the gods who suf­
fered under Jalandhara (SP.2.5. 1 8. 1-5). After consulting with the 
gods, the celestial sage N arada went to see J alandhara (SP. 2.5. 18. 1 8-
19)· Narada, on being asked whence he had come and what was the 
purpose of his visit, described to Jalandhara the residence of Siva in 
its celestial beauty. Narada had wondered if there were any other 
place to match Siva's residence; in response Jalandhara showed off his 
wealth. Narada commented that Jalandhara, who possessed the most 
beautiful of everything, lacked only the best jewel among women. Na­
rada then returned to his description of Siva's residence. Siva lived 
there as a naked yogi with Parvati, his wife of exquisite beauty. Her 
charm was such that she had even subjugated Siva, the Great Yogi. 
Jalandhara, though he was surrounded by all the wealth in existence, 
could not boast of such beauty near him. Narada exerted himself to 
make Jalandhara covet Parvati, and he succeeded in exciting the king

• D E MO N S  
of demons (SP.2.S. 1 8.22-S0). Infatuated, Jalandhara, who had con­
quered the world and ruled over the gods, sent his messenger, Rcihu, 
to Siva. He demanded that Siva give Pcirvati to J alandhara. He was the 
ruler; it was for him to enjoy all excellent things. What use was the 
incomparable beauty of Parvati to the Great Yogi attended by ghosts, 
spirits, and demons? Her place should be with Jalandhara, who had 
seized and enjoyed the most precious possession of every god 
(SP.2.S. 1g.3-16). Rahu placed Jalandhara's message before Siva, the 
Great God, who appeared in regal splendor, celestial ornaments 
adorning his perfect body white with ashes. After listening to Rahu's 
message, a terrifying creature burst out from between Siva's eye­
brows. Huge with the face of a lion, it got hold of Rcihu and started to 
devour him. Siva restrained the hungry creature and made it devour 
its own body. When the creature was left only with its head, Siva made 
it his gaJ.la and doorkeeper Kirttimukha (SP.2.S. 1g. 1 8-48), the apo­
tropaic face that guards the entrance of the house of god. 
Jalandhara, angered by the failure of his emissary, mobilized the 
entire army of the demons against Siva's gaJ.las (SP.2.S.20.7-8). It was 
a hopeless battle for the gar:tas, because the demons by the magic 
power of resuscitation exercised by Sukra kept their ranks undimin­
ished, until Siva, in great fury, sent forth a sorceress from his mouth 
(SP.2.S.20.49-S2). Her mouth was cavernous, her breasts crushed 
trees (SP.2.S.20.S2); she had teeth and eyes in her womb. She went to 
the battleground and stuffed Sukra into her vagina, where she kept 
him for the time being (SP.2.S.20.SS; PP.6. 1 8.82-g0). Sukra (the 
Seed), the wielder of the magic of resuscitation, was held captive in 
the womb of the witch, and the fight of the demons and Siva's gar:tas 
remained undecided until Siva himself, in his terrible form and 
laughing, went into the battle, riding on his bull (SP.2.S.22. 1 ). Jalan­
dhara saw that his powers of warfare were useless against Siva, and 
took recourse to his magic power, coနuring up an illusion of Gan­
dharvas and Apsarases, dancing and singing. They held Siva's interest 
while Jalandhara, driven by lust and assuming the shape of Siva, ten­
armed, five-faced, and three-eyed, went toward parvatJ. She came to 
meet him. Overwhelmed by her beauty, his seed fell and he was par­
alyzed. From this ParvatJ realized that he was a demon, that he did 
not have the stamina of a god, and she vanished. She told Viør:tu about 
the incident, for it struck her that J alandhara unwittingly had shown 
her the way to his own destruction. As Jalandhara had attempted to 

D E M O N S  O F  S E X · 3 9 1 
subject her to his lust, so Viøl)u should violate the chastity of Vrnda, 
the wife of Jalandhara. Viøl)u thereupon went to Jalandhara's city to 
carry out his deception (SP.2.S.22.33-S2). First, Viøl)u made Vrnda 
have bad dreams and see evil omens, even the death of Jalandhara 
killed by Siva. None could restore Jalandhara to life once Siva had 
killed him. Yet, an ascetic who was Viøl)u in disguise achieved the im­
possible to the eyes of Vrnda: he restored J alandhara to life. Little did 
she know that it was Viøl)u who now had assumed the appearance of 
Jalandhara. Vrnda and Jalandhara embraced and made love. Only at 
the end did Vrnda realize that she had made love with Viøl)u. She 
cursed Viøl)u jnd entered the fire. Having sacrificed herself, her 
sheer inner light (tejas) reached the world of Siva and was absorbed 
into Parvati (SP.2·S·23.3-49)· 
Jalandhara, having been unable to deceive Parvati, returned to the 
battlefield. By that time the dancing and singing Gandharvas and 
Apsarases had vanished from Siva's vision. Finding himself back on 
the battlefield, Siva fought with Jalandhara. Once more Jalandhara 
exercised his maya and made Siva see Parvati, this time bound in her 
chariot and beaten by demons. Siva became distressed, but as Jalan­
dhara attacked him the delusion vanished (SP.2.S.24.2- 14). Siva de­
cided to kill Jalandhara. Then, in great fury and for sport, Siva with 
his big toe drew a wondပous terrible discus in the waters. Laughing, 
he challenged Jalandhara to lift the wheel created in the waters. 
Should he lift it up, he would be able to fight with Siva. Jalandhara in 
reply boasted of his former exploits, among them his having seized 
Va<)ava, the fire-mare-the submarine fire-and having closed her 
flaming mouth that devoured the water of the ocean. Siva laughed 
and became enraged. He held in his hand Sudarsana, the discus he 
had drawn with his toe. He threw the discus, bright like a hundred 
thousand suns and the fire of dissolution, and he severed the head of 
Jalandhara (SP.2.S.24.2S-47). The tejas departed from Jalandhara's 
body and merged into Siva, just as the tejas from Vrnda's body had 
merged into Parvati. The entire universe then resumed its normal 
course (SP. 2.S.24.S2, S8). 
While Andhaka was more a son of Parvati than of Siva, and.became 
a demon only by adoption even though he looked and acted like a de­
mon from birth, Jalandhara was born from Siva's ire. Parvati had no 
share in the making of J alandhara. He assumed his shape in the 
Ocean whose son he became: he was destined by Brahma to become 

39 2 
• D E M O N S  
emperor of the demons. Jalandhara was fair-minded yet, being a de­
mon, he was an enemy of the gods. The war between the gods and 
the demons that had Siva and Jalandhara as protagonists was waged 
in two domains: that of arms, demanding power and skill, and that of 
sex and deception, with Parvatl and Vrnda as pawns. Siva played an 
equivocal part. Jalandhara was his own issue, whom none could kill 
except Siva himself. To this end Siva sent Narada to tempt Jalandhara 
with his description ဖf Parvatl's beauty; moreover, he made the stead­
fast, faithful demon king's slowly rising desire appear justified on ac­
count of Siva's, the yogi's, unsuitability as Parvatl's husband. Jalan­
dhara's demand for ParvatJ, in the end, almost seemed reasonable for 
one who ruled over the gods and possessed everything excellent ex­
cept Parvati. When Jalandhara succumbed to the temptation of Na­
rada's description of Parvatl and sent Rahu to Siva to demand Parvati, 
Siva received Rahu with devouring fury. Siva's indirect offer of Par­
vati to the demon king having miscarried, the war of the gods and 
demons continued. Siva either knew from the beginning that Na­
rada's mission would be unsuccessful, or else he left it to Parvati to act 
on her own vis-a.-vis Jalandhara, as he had done in the case of 
Andhaka, the demon king. 
Siva played a safe and cruel game in tempting Jalandhara, for Par­
vati and Siva were inseparable, like a word and its meaning. To those 
who did not know this truth and thought of them as separate, Siva's 
attitude toward Parvati could have seemed cynical and calculated. 
Parvati, less subtle than Siva and more demonical than J alandhara, 
retaliated. She made Viøl)u exercise his power of illusion on Vrnda, 
the devoted wife of Jalandhara. Parvati made Viøl)u make love with 
Vrnda, revenging Jalandhara's aborted attempt on herself. But in 
contrast to Jalandhara's clumsy and revealing behavior, Viøl)u in the 
course of his maya, using psychological tactics, twice disguised himself. 
Posing as an ascetic, he knew how to win Vfnda's confidence., The 
false ascetic conjured before her eyes the illusion of the maimed, dead 
body of her husband; he followed this up by himself assuming the 
shape of Jalandhara, whom in the meanwhile he had restored to life. 
He revived, rose, embraced, and kissed Vrnda. Overwhelmed, Vfnda 
yielded to him whom she believed to be Jalandhara, but who was 
Viøl)u. Then, realizing his deception and what she had done, Vrnda 
killed herself. 
ParvatJ had taken her revenge on Jalandhara; she dealt a fateful 

D E M O N S  O F  S E X · 393 
blow to him by Vrnda's death. Siva then decided to kill the weakened 
Jalandhara in battle bΰ means of the discus called Suαaβsana. Siva cre­
ated this sharp wheel In the waters of the ocean by stIrrmg them play­
fully with his big toe (SP.2.5.24·26, 46). The wheel, an ancient symbol 
of the turning of heaven around the cosmic axis (cf. RV. I0.8g.4), ac­
cording to the Jalandhara myth was created in the cosmic waters, the 
domain where Jalandhara was born. Siva challenged the demon king 
to lift the w heel created by Siva in the waters. If he could perform this 
feat, he would be competent to fight with Siva. As Jalandhara did not 
stir, Siva laughed and became angry; he hurled the Sudarsana wheel, 
as bright as a-Hundred thousand suns, and severed the head of the 
emperor of the demons from his body (SP .2.5.24.28, 44-47). 
The cosmic Sudarsana weapon in Siva's hand, destructive of the 
worId power of the demons, ended the life of Jalandhara, while it was 
Siva's trident that h/<l:d pierced the heart of Andhaka. The movement 
of heaven around the cosmic axis and the cosmic axis itself were the 
respective weapons signifying the annihilation of cosmic rule of the 
demons and establishment of that of the gods. 
Jalandhara, unable to take up the Sudarsana but glorifying in his 
previous achievements, told Siva that he had closed the mouth of the 
submarine fire (SP. 2.5.,H.38). Jalandhara the demon king had origi­
nated from the cast-off fire of Siva's third eye. It had broken out to 
kill Indra, king of the gods (SP.2.5. 1 3.49-50; 2.5. 1 4.4), as it had killed 
Kama. That fire of Siva's anger, the fire that killed Kama, became a 
mare (Va<;lava) and was taken by Brahma to the ocean to feed on its 
water (SP .2.3.20. 14- 19). 
Both Jalandhara and Va<;lava, the submarine fire-mare, originated 
from the fire of Siva's third eye, and each became a demonic power in 
its own right. In their relation to Vrnda and Jalandhara, the gods 
acted like demons, whereas Vrnda, of unalloyed defuonic extraction 
and nobility in her essence and energy (tejas), became one with Par­
vati. The fire of Siva's third eye created demonic powers in the water, 
or it heated his forehead so that when Parvati laid her hands on Siva's 
eyes and darkness engulfed the cosmos, from the fire of Siva's fore­
head and the sweat from her hands Andhaka was born (SP.2.5.42. 16-
I g; SP, DhS. 4.6-7), who like Jalandhara, the "son of the Ocean," 
became king of the demons by adoption. While Andhaka, though of 
celestial descent, was diabolic from the start, Jalandhara had to be 
perverted by Narada for the sake of the gods by Siva's command. Siva 

394 • D E M O N S  
took back to himself the tejas of his son jalandhara whom he had led 
astray. The tejas of Vrnda, the blameless victim of Parvati, merged 
into the Great Goddess. jalandhara and his passionate, trusting wife 
were lost to the world of the demons. Siva and Parvati, having de­
praved, deceived, and deprived jalandhara and Vrnda of their lives, 
took the demons' energies (tejas) into themselves. The two noble de­
mons were joined with the Great Gods. They had gone through their 
fated trials and, having played their parts in the game devised by the 
gods, jalandhara was taken back by Siva, and Vrnda, the sorely tried 
demoness, joined the Great Goddess. Unlike fierce Andhaka, they 
acted out their destiny without attaining release while still embodied. 
2. SIVA'S DEMON 
Though the gods and the demons were perpetually at war, the gods, 
the Devas, the shining ones, had many traits in common with the de­
mons, who frequently extended their rule beyond Patala, the nether­
world, their home after the fall of the Titans, the Asuras. The Asuras, 
more ancient than the gods and nearer to the undefinable Uncreate, 
were beyond good and evil; potentially they held the germs of both, 
but it was only after their fall, when the shining Devas arose, that the 
Asuras, relegated to the netherworld, became demons. They were the 
"others" and therefore enemies, and thought of as evil by the gods 
who, for this reason, felt free to treat them with evil intent. The char­
acter of the gods and the demons did not coincide with the dichotomy 
of good and evil. The two pairs of opposites overlapped as much as 
they intersected in changing patterns. Siva / Virabhadra raged with 
demoniac furor as he destroyed the sacrifice of Dakøa. To destroy sac­
rifices to the gods was one of the main purposes of a demon, for in 
this way the gods were deprived of their food. Under a different kind 
of stress Siva danced with demonic frenzy as he carried the dead body 
of Sati, whom he had loved exceedingly. The excessiveness of his 
grief-as well as of his elation-was an outburst in which Siva's demon 
revealed himself. It was for the demon's sake, also, that Siva would 
show his outwardly unprovoked smile or let his laugh be heard. The 
tension and bond between god and demon found its release in Siva's 
smile and laugh. The demon was in the god from before the begin­
ning. God Rudra was essentially an Asura (RV.S.42. 1 1); his Asura na­
ture never left him (RV.2.33.9). 

5 1  VA'S D E MON ' 3 9 5  
The inscrutable smile of the god is spread over the countenance of 
innumerable images of Siva. His laugh-or was it the sound AUM­
rung over the waters of dissolution as the god manifested frဗm within 
the cosmic linga (Ch. VII.2). Besides, the excess that was in Siva man­
ifested in the shape of the Rudras, gaJ)as, and Pramathas, who were 
Siva's entourage and kept his ambience astir with movement. Before 
becoming SthaJ)u, Siva dismissed the turbulent Rudras from his 
being. Their demonic traits, however, subsisted in the grotesque 
physiognomies of innumerable gaJ)as who formed Siva's host, prog­
nostications .or Cfricatures of possibilities of the human coဘditiမn. 
Busy in makmgrhemselves felt, the gaJ)as were the comparatively lll­
finitesimal quantities replete with the impulsion of his presence that 
swelled the host of the Great God. Some had attained the status of 
gaJ)as and had become leaders of troops after having been defeated 
in other forms and having "died," as was the case with Dakøa and 
Andhaka. The Pramathas or churn spirits, another component of 
Siva's host, formed an elite of whirling impetuosity. Nothing could 
stagnate where the Pramathas appeared. The demon ism and density 
of Siva's entourage, which throbbed with the invisible and varied tex­
ture of feeling alive, was tinged with grotesque and lugubrious hues. 
Others, the bhufas, riiÑasas, and piSiicas, ghosts and fiends, belonged to 
more dangerous categories. Siva preferred to stay with them in cre­
mation grounds. 
Siva explained his liking for cemeteries to Vma when she asked him 
the reason for his dwelling in cremaJ:ion grounds, which were full of 
hair, bones, and skulls, jackals and) vultures, and the smoke rising 
from corpses, when he had so many beautiful residences. Mahesvara, 
the Great Lord, replied to the Goddess that in the past he had been 
.looking a long time for a pure place to dwell in. He could not find 
one, was frustrated, and out of anger against procreation he created 
the terrible piSiicas, flesh-eating ghouls and goblins, and the r٦asas, 
intent on killing peoplf. Out of compassion and to protect people and 
alleviate their fear, however, he kept these ghosts and fiends in cre­
mation grounds. Since he did not want to live without the bhutas and 
gaJ)as, he chose to live in a cemetery. The brahmins worshiped him in 
daily sacrifices, whereas those who desired liberation took the terrible 
Rudra vow. Only heroes (vira) could stay in such a place. It was not fit 
for seekers of long life or for the impure. None but Rudra could free 
people from fear. When the ghosts stayed with him, they caused no 

3 96 • D E M O N S  
harm. It was for the well-being of the world that Rudra lived in ceme­
teries (MBh. 1 3, app. 1 ,  no. 1 5, lines 358-95). 
The Rudras, gaʎas, and Pramathas, demonic contingents of vital 
energies that only Rudra can control, were complemented by dread­
ful hordes of ghosts and ghouls whom Rudra out of consideration for 
mankind kept with him in cemeteries. Even so, it was he who had cre­
ated the Rudras. It was out of anger against procreation that he dis­
charged them. It was due to the fiery fury shooting out of Siva's third 
eye that Jalandhara, the demon king, was born and the submarine 
mare came to be. Rudra himself was born from Brahma's anger. As 
Manyu, Anger, he was born from Prȳapati. 
The cemetery had its place at the opposite end of procreation. 
When horror, disgust, and revulsion are overcome in the charnel 
ground, ashes remain. From them the animals were born at the 
burnt-out lake of Prajapati's semen (eh. I1L l), and ashes make fertile 
the fields. Siva has smeared them all over his body. 
The anger of Siva was a creative counterpart of his samiidhi. From 
his anger demons came forth and joined the ranks of those who had 
fallen into the netherworld. The former were god-created demons, 
the others were demons descended from the Asuras. The latter's 
domicile was the netherworld, whereas the innumerable hosts of Siva 
accompanied him in heaven, and the most macabre ones were kept in 
bounds on earth, in cemeteries, a guard of honor of the elect, the he­
roes (vim) who had overcome their animal nature, who had nothing 
to fear because they had attained freedom from fear. 
Implied in Siva's answer to Parvati was his nature as Tryambaka, 
lord over life and death (RV.7.59. l 2), and YogeSvara, Lord of Yoga, 
who had discharged his aversion to procreation in the shape of the 
Rudras. He was the lord over the life of creatures and the master of 
his own virility, which he controlled and kept unspent. He had turned 
away from procreation and dwelled in the cemeteries where he liked 
to stay. His "necrophilia" complemented his aversion to procreation, 
and he rationalized, for the sake of Parvati or for his devotee, his 
spontaneous predilection for cemeteries. The explanation that the 
dreadful ghosts concentrated there around him would not harm peo­
ple who thus could live free from fear was only part of his entire state­
ment-which meant that those who feared the awful ghosts were des­
tined to remain outsiders. Only heroes could be near him in the 
cremation ground, heroes who had defied death and liberated them-

SIVA'S DEMON • 397 
selves from passions and, fear. These were the true devotes ofRudra 
in his fonn of dread. 
The metaphor of the cemetery is on the same level of intensity of 
realization with the 'myths of Siva dancing while he carried Sati"s dead 
body, and with the death of A<;li by monstrous sex. These extreme sit­
uations are symbols of Siva's power that defies death. A fierce bliss of 
agonized compassion shaped the physiognomy of some of the images 
of Bhairava as represented in art. Siva liked his ghostly entourage. It 
attracted to his presence those who had nothing to fear, who had mas­
tered the onslaught of the multiple categories of threatening powers 
that were fatal to those who were less than heroes, and who could not 
control the frightening phantoms because they had not controlled 
themselves. Siva, the yogi, in his compassion, kept them away from his 
macabre residence, his preferred dwelling in the world of mortals. 
In a lighter vein, basing Siva's liking of cemeteries on the god's own 
past and cosmic role, Kal).abhiiti, a piSaca or meat-eating ghoul in the 
Kathiisaritsagara, relates Siva's answer to Parvati's question. Siva him­
self told it to the demon in the burning ground at Ujjain. Siva said he 
was asked by Parvati as to where his delight in skulls and cremation 
grounds came from. Siva then told her that having cut off the head of 
arrogant Brahma, he felt remorse and undertook a difficult vow. 
Thus it came about that he carried a skull in his hand and loved the 
places where corpses are burned. "Moreover, this world, resembling 
a skull, rests in my hand; for the two skull-shaped halves of the egg 
before mentioned are called heaven and earth" (KSS.2.8-15).4 
According to Siva's answer to Parvati in the Mahabharata, however, 
the cremation ground was a testing ground for the vira, the hero, 
while Siva, withholding the fear of death from the living who were 
unable to overcome it, was at home among death's figures, liked their 
variety, and kept them contained by his presence. 
By another act of containment, by the power of yoga, Siva, the 
Great God, more than any other god, was an Asura. The great gods 
of the lJ.g Veda still bore that title.5 They possessed maya, creativity, 
which filled the Uncreate. All things to be created, to be manifested,

they held within this power in a state of potentiality before the sun 
had risen and revealed the flowing light of the godhead. This was 
their treasure. The Mountain and Vrtra, the serpent that had lain 
coiled around it, guarded the treasure. It also had other guardians-­
the Gandharva Krsanu and Rudra. 
The Great Asura Vrtra tenaciously guarded the treasure, but he 
was defeated by Indra, who made him lose his hold. The serpent was 
killed by the young, new, conquering god, and the mountain was shat­
tered. Then the treasure of the Asuras became manifest for all to see, 
under the light of the sun. It had been a hard battle and long fight as . 
the demons, the partis, clung to their treasure, unwilling to open up 
the cave and have the treasure dispersed (RV.6.3g.2; 1 0. 108. 1 - 1 1 ). 
They clung to it like misers to their gold. 
Seen from the manifest world of which Indra became the creator, 
the vice of the Asuras was their unwillingness to part with their treas­
ures: the sun, the light, the rivers. Indra killed the serpent Vrtra who 
enclosed them, and shattered the mountain where they were held 
captive. For the same reason Indra threw away the three heads of the 
Titan Visvariipa, the son of Tvaøtr Visvariipa, after Trita Aptya had 
killed the avaricious Titan, who did not live up to the name Visva­
rlipa, "All-Form," which he had inherited from his father, the shaper 
of all form among the Asuras (RV. I0.8.7-9). The world of the Titans 
was a world of potentiality. It held all the powers and forms of crea­
tion, and withheld them from creation. In this sense the Asuras were 
considered demons by those among them who left and followed In­
dra. 
The partis or misers explicitly represented this Asuric or demonic 
trait. After Vrtra had been slain, they kept hidden in a cave deep 
down in the mountain their treasure, cows, and horses. Not only In­
dra (RV.6.3g.2 ;  6.20.4) but also Agni (RV.7.9.2) or Agni and Soma 
(RV. l .g3.4), who had left the Asuras, as well as the Angirases 
(RV. 1 .83.4) had to free the treasure that the partis refused to share 
when the river Rasa was already flowing in the emerging cosmos.6 
Cosmically, in the mythic world of Indra, the treasure of the Asuras 
was dispersed all over creation. Vitally and in the human metaphor of 
the creation myth that has Prajapati and Rudra as protagonists, the 
seed of Prajapati fell down onto the earth and life had its beginning. 
6 Cf. A. A. Macdonell. Vedic Mythology, pp. 157 and 63.

Soma, the elixir of immortality and of creative inspiration that had 
belonged to the Asuras and that was with them when they were in 
Vrtra and en coiled by the serpent, had been brought down to man. 
Visibly, physically, the treasure of the Asuras was dispersed in the cos­
mOS. Its metaphysical reality, whether concentrated as Soma in In­
dra's myth, or as semen in Rudra's myth, by the power of yoga was 
vested in Rudra / Siva. Serpents guarded the Great God at any time, 
and particularly when god Kama attacked him. The Great Yogi re­
tained the tr9sure; he did not shed it into the lap of woman. The self­
containment of the Lord of Yoga, formulated in terms of sex, had its 
illustration in the myth of Siva and Parvati. From the outset, she knew 
the mystery of the treasure of the Asuras that Siva carried and, in the 
course of the myth, she responded on more than one level to Siva's 
demon. An,p we see "the dark neck of Siva, which the God of Love 
has, so to speak, surrounded with nooses in the form of the alluring 
looks of Parvati reclining on his bosom . . .  " (KSS . 1 . 1 )7 when the god­
dess wants to know why Siva delights in skulls and charnel grounds. 
3. COSMIC DEMONS 
a. The Domicile in the Netherworld 
Siva Aøtamurti permeated the universe as soon as Prajapati had in­
vested the newborn god and given him his names (Ch. V. l). Receiving 
his names, the child became ?e from evil. It was the primordial evil 
inherent in the inception of lifယ_ on earth that the divine child, given 
his names, overcame. 
Evil, however, had more than one origin.8 It sprang up when the 
Asuras were besieged by Indra, some of them going over to his rule. 
Indra and the gods who, like Vil).u, had been on his side, as well as 
the Asuras who left Vrtra, became the ·victorious gods of a new cos­
mos, the Devas, the shining ones. The Asuras who had not joined In­
dra fell into the netherworld, whence they emerged again and again 
to extend their power over heaven and earth. Originally, the Asuras 
were precosmic powers. They were roused from potentiality to act by 
the assault of god Indra. Later Vedic theogony, however, only faintly 
remembering the precosmic precedence of the Asuras, was con-

cerned with the created world, having Prajapati as the Creator of the 
cosmos, and assigned to him the creation of both the gods and the 
Asuras. "There were two classes of the descendants of Prajapati, the 
gods and the Asuras; the younger ones were the gods, the elder ones 
were the Asuras" (BrUp. 1 .3. 1 ).9 Conceding seniority to the Asuras, 
however, was not the only criterion by which the Briihma1Jas distin­
guished between the two categories. The gods, as a rule, issued from 
the upper part of Prajapati's body, the Asuras from the lower part10 
(SB . 1 1 . 1.6.7-9; cf. VP . 1 .5.3 1-33).1 1  The gods emerged as superior not 
only by the respective position of their origin, but also by their asso­
ciation with light and goodness, while the Asuras were seen together 
with darkness and evil (SB . 1 1. 1 .6.7-9)' The inscrutability of the pre­
cosmic Asuras, the Titans, in Brahma's creation condensed into dark­
ness. Fallen, the Asuras were assigned a lower position and an evil dis­
position. The Titans became demons. In the Briihma1J,as, their origin 
from the lower portion of Prajapati was tantamount to their fall. On 
account of the low position to which they now were "born," they 
were doomed to be evil. The gods and the demons, both born from 
Prajapati, were vying with each other for supremacy (SB .  1. 2.5. 1 ;  
BrUp. 1 .3. 1 ;  ChUP . 1 .2.1). I n  spite of their lowly position, the demons 
defeated the gods, thought that the world belonged to them, and 
wanted to divide it. When the gods heard of it, they went to the 
Asuras with god ViøI).u at their head and the desire of sharing the 
earth with the demons. The demons proposed to give to the gods as 
much land as ViøI).u could lie upon. ViøI).u was a dwarf, but he also 
represented the sacrifice, and the sacrifice was as large as the whole 
earth (SB . 1 .2.5. 1-7). 
Though the Asuras were generous in their offer to divide the earth 
between themselves and the gods, they had not meant to share it with 
them in equal parts; they meant to give them just as much as the 
dwarf-god, lying down, could cover. Little did the demons know that 
ViøI).u was the sacrifice and thus as large as the earth. The gods had 
tricked the Asuras, who were left landless. The sly gods were worse 
than the demons. 
9 The texts vary, but in two sources the asuras are born first: cf. MarkaruJeya Purarw 
(MaP), tr. F. E. Pargiter, 1904, p. 233 (= 48.4-8); and VP. I .S·31-33.

interchangeably. 

COS M I C  D E M O N S · 40 I 
Inasmuch as the demons were afflicted with ရvil on account of their 
low birth--equivalent to their fall-they were victims of circumstance, 
whereas the gods who tricked them abused their high station and 
were more evil than the demons. Or it is said that the demons re­
garded themselves as equal to the gods and vied with them 
(MBh. 1 2. 1 60.28-2g). They made the initial mistake of considering 
themselves equal with the gods because both had been born of Praja­
patio They did not take into account that Prajapati, the Creator, had 
himself smitte them with evil when he saw that he had created dark­
ness, which he equated with evil. Evil had its origin in the Creator. 
Thus the demons were righteous from the beginning, and the god­
dess Sri, "Fortune" dwelled with them. She attached herself always to 
those who lived according to the dharma or norm of their own station. 
The demons were/law-abiding, self-disciplined, generous, and com­
passionate; they lived gracefully, free from envy and greed. But in the 
course of time the demons began to yield to desire and anger. They 
became quarrelsome, self-indulgent, and took pleasure in entertain­
ments where men dressed as women and women as men. The god­
dess Sri, therefore, left the demons and went over to the gods 
(MBh.1 2.22 1 .26-83). As the demons degenerated, their good fortune 
left them. Desire and greed, self-indulgence and anger, as time went 
on, destroyed their dharma. They changed, but not in their pride. 
They regarded themselves လs equal to the gods, and to make up for 
what they had lost of theiJinitial assets in the course of time, they 
strove against the gods (d. MBh. 1 2. 1 60.28-30). Their deterioration 
kept pace with that of mankind in the course of the yugas (Ch. VII.6). 
They became evil and fought with the gods, whom they generally 
worsted, only to be defeated by the gods' guile and trickery. The de­
mons recovered quickly, as they could rely on their knowledge of re-
suscitating the dead. 
. 
On the intellectual and ethical levels, the demons did not do better 
than in the emotional sphere. "The gods and the demons, born from 
Prajapati, received their father's inheritance, namely speech: truth 
and untruth. They both spoke truth, and they both spoke untruth; 
they were alike" (SB.g.S. 1 . 1 2). Then the gods left untruth and held to 
truth, and the Asuras did just the opposite. The truth that had been 
in the Asuras saw this change and went to the gods. The untruth that 
had been in the gods thereupon went to the demons. The result was 
that the gods, who spoke nothing but truth, became very poor and 
n

4 02 • D E M O N S  
despised, whereas the demons who spoke untruth throve and were 
very prosperous; but in the end they came to nought (SB .g. s. 1 .  13- 1 7). 
Then the gods started performing sacrifices and spreading the truth. 
The demons went there to fetch what originally had been theirs. 
When the gods saw the demons, they stopped the sacrifice and did 
something else. The demons went away, but they came back again 
and interrupted the sacrificing gods at each step (SB .g.S. I . 1 8  ff.) until 
the gods, by performing certain rites, besieged on the earth, in the 
air, and in the sky the three cities that the demons had built (see infra, 
XI.3.b; SB .3.4.4.3-4; cf. SB . 1 O.2.S.2) after Ta.raka had been defeated 
by Karttikeya. 
Up to that time, the demons, comprising the Daityas and the Dan­
avas, lived in Rasatala in the netherworld called patala.12 The Daityas 
were descended from Diti, the Danavas from Danu (cf. MBh. I .S8.30). 
Both these demonesses, at the time of the Mahiibhiirata, were looked 
upon as daughters of Dakøa (MBh . l .Sg. I I- 1 2). Danu, however, be­
fore the Titans fell, had been the mother of Vrtra, the Asura, the 
cosmic serpent (RV. 1 .32.9). After their fall, the demons became city 
dwellers. Their cities were better than those of mortals, more splen-, 
did even than those of the gods. Their capital, HiraQyapura, the 
golden city, had been built by Visvakarman, the architect of the gods, . 
and created in his mind by Maya, the architect of the Asuras 
(MBh.S.g8. 1-2). Maya was the planner. The gods had no objection to 
letting their architect execute the work and build the capital city of. 
the Asuras. It was a way of acknowledging their foes as superior to 
them. The city had beautiful facilities for luxurious recreation and 
sport (MBh.S.g8.g-lS). 
Patala, the lowest region of the netherworld, is said to be so named 
because here fall all the forms of water (MBh'S'97.6). Daityas and 
Danavas worshipfully frequented Patala, and many sinful Danavas 
had made it their home (MBh.S.97. 1 ,  1 1). The source of life was 
there. An egg of great beauty lay in its waters. It was there from the 
beginning of creation; none knew its origin. When the end of the 
world was to come, a mighty flame of fire would rise from it and con-
12 Patala is the name of the netherworld. It has seven levels or regions, Rasatala being 
the fourth, and the lowermost region again being called patala. Rasatala of the Puriu;ws 
owes its name to Rasa, the "heavenly stream" (5. S. Bhave, The Soma Hymns of the lJ.g 
Veda, 1960, 2:81). For suggested identification of the river Rasa with the ecliptic, cf.

sume the three worlds (MBh.5.97. 1 7- 1 9). There also blazed the Asura 
fire, known as the fire-mare, Va<;lava, the submarine fire, that feeds 
on water (MBh·5·97·3)Y It had left Siva as his wrath, though the ori­
gin of the submarine fire outside the Saiva tradition was also differ­
ently accounted for as Asura fire. There also the (sun-) horse rose 
from the primal source (cf. RV. 1 . 1 63. 1 ).I4 There also the celestial el­
ephant Airavata took up the cool water and imparted it to the clouds, 
whence Indra shed it down on earth as rain (MBh.5.97.7). Aquatic 
monsters lived tဝre who subsisted on the rays of the moon 
(MBh.5.97.8). Many kinds of creatures that died in the daytime, 
pierced by the rays of the sun, came back to life in Patala in the night, 
as the rays of the moon revived them with amrta (MBh.5.97.9-1O). It 
was there that the gods, after defeating the Asuras, drank the amrta 
and deposited it (MBh.5.g7.4). 
The domicile of the Asuras after their fall, after Indra had killed 
Vrtra, or after they were born from Prajapati / Brahma, was down 
below the level of the earth: the demons had entered the earth 
(SB . l l . l .6.8). They went into the darkness, though not into hell. 
Hell was below the netherworld, a fathomless dark pit reserved for 
evil-doers, particularly of human birth (RV.2.2g.6; 7.104.3, 1 1, 17; 
9.73.9), and was called Narilka (AV. 1 2.4.36). It was furnished, accord­
ing to the Pura'(tas, with accoutrements of exquisite torture, in a hot 
hell, a cold hell-altoget;heသ}even of them, one above the other.I5 
The entrance to hell was at the mare's head, Va<;lavamukha, where 
the submarine fire, Va<;lavanala, issued from her mouth, in the South­
ern Ocean,16 near the celestial south pole. The south, at all times, 
from the IJ.g Veda on, was known as the region of death. This was the 
cosmic south, below the earth. Patala, the netherworld, was above it. 
ဟHell was a place of punishment. Nagas, guilty of the crime of brah­
minicide, had to go to hell and leave Patala,i7 the stratum of the neth­
erworld deepest in position as well as significance.

Patala had become the deep region of mystery after god Indra's on­
slaught of the cosmic mountain. There the waters fell and cradled an 
egg that held creation and also destruction. It floated in the waters, 
which were laced with amrta and lit up by the flaming mare's head. 
This subterranean, sublunar domain, sheltered from the scorching 
sun, lay below the domicile of the demons, who before the creation of 
the cosmos had been Titans. 
The embryo of the waters and of the moving and unmoving 
(RV. l.7o.2), and the horse that emerged from the waters (RV. l.163. 1) 
were images de profundis of fire hidden in the deep. The horse that 
has its seat in the ocean is a manifestation of Agni (VS . 17.87). 
From their sumptuous domicile in the netherworld the fallen and 
subsequently more and more corrupted Asuras or demons made fre­
quent forays. They emerged in order to disturb the sacrifices, so as to 
deprive the gods of sustenance, and their armies overran heaven and 
earth. Though the demons were always defeated, they rose again. 
They were irrepressible, and this was unavoidable in the world of di­
chotomy, where light is set against darkness, white against black, good 
against evil, and gods against demons. While sons of god, like 
Andhaka or Jalandhara, could become demons, none born as a de­
mon became a god, whereas Kavya Usanas, who was a Titan, offici­
ated at different phases of his long career as priest of the gods and 
priest of the demons. From their abode in the netherworld the de­
mons, in their perpetual war with the gods, threatened heaven and 
earth, where they made themselves at home and ruled over con­
quered land from their newly built fortified cities. Andhaka's exploit 
was but one of their innumerable, if temporary conquests. 
Their fortresses originally were built of stone. There were hun­
dreds of them (RV-4-30.20), that gave them as much or as little secu­
rity as the Mountain where the Titans had dwelled. They did not, 
however, build stone fortresses only. Their citadels were of iron 
(RV.2.20.8); they also had golden strongholds (AV. I0.6. 1O), and 
Suøʎa, the demon, had a moving fortress (RV .8. 1 .28), though it is not 
stated what it was built of. They needed these strongholds, for they 
were sorely besieged by the gods, whom they also wanted to baffle by 
the splendor of their fortifications. In the course of time they alto­
gether relied on metal fortifications on earth, in the air, and in the 
sky.

b. The Destruction of the Triple City of the Demons 
"The Asuras had three citadels; the lowest was of iron, then there was 
one of silver, then one of goldဠ The gods could not conquer them; 
they sought to conquer them by siege . . . .  They made ready an arrow, 
Agni as the point, Soma as the socket, ViøQu as the shaft. They said, 
'Who shall shoot it?' . . .  'Rudra,' they said, 'Rudra is cruel, let him 
shoot it.' He-.S'hid, 'Let me choose a boon; let me be overlord of ani­
mals.' Therefore is Rudra overlord of animals. Rudra let it go; it cleft 
the three citadels and drove the Asuras away from these worlds." 
(TS.6.2.3. 1-2).18 This was not the only time that Rudra became Lord 
of Animals, for this status had been conferred on him by Prajapati, 
and the gods contrived his fearful shape (Ch. 1.2). Rudra's request to 
the gods would seem unexpected, unless by his renewed shot he 
wanted to have his title confirmed. Or the myth of the three cities, 
taking no cognizance of the primordial myth, assigns to its own setting 
Rudra's becoming Pasupati (Ch. X.A,2.b). 
Rudra let his arrow fly against the three citadels of the Asuras. The 
citadels were burned and the demons were driven from the earth, the 
air, and the sky. Or, it is said, the gods themselves discharged the ar­
row (KB .8.8). Again, when the Asuras made the worlds into their 
forts, the gods performed certain sacrificial rites of siege whereby the 
Asuras were defeated (SB'3'4+3-4)' Or from the rite of siege was 
made an arrow with Agni, Fire, as its tip (AB . 1 . 25). Agni then took 
possession of the citadels, his body occupied each one of them; en­
cased in iron, silver, and gold, he chased away the threatening Asuras 
(cf. VS ,5.8; K<iS .24. lO; SB .3+4.23-25). Thus, the forts of the demons, 
each now encasing Agni, were conquered by the gods, who had be­
sieged them by having ritually set up the fire altar and accessory parts 
as their citadels, whence they besieged the demons and conquered 
their fortresses on earth, in the air, and the sky. Hence an amulet 
made of three bands--one of gold, one of silver, and one of iron­
will protect the wearer from the demons or dangers that threaten him 
from the sky, the air, and o, and he will overcome whoever 
hates him (AV.5.28.g, lO). In the ritual myth, the demons made the 
three worlds into their forts; their forts were as large as these worlds 
themselves. The demons, at that time, did not build their forts in the 
,. Taittiriya Sa'f!lhitii (TS) , tr. A. B. Keith, 1 9 1 4 ,  p. 504. 

4 06 • D E M O N S  
three worlds-as they were subsequently said to have done. They con­
verted the triple world into fortresses of their own. The gods de­
fended themselves from their own fortresses; these were the sacrifi­
cial buildings and the rites of siege (upasad). 
Ritual and magical practice in their own effectiveness corresponded 
to the myth of Rudra, the archer, and the fire of his arrow. His pri­
mordial myth, valid at all times, was actualized, though the target was 
not Prajapati, the Creator procreating, but a demonized universe. 
The myth of the burning of the three citadels of the Asuras was a 
reassessment of Prajapati's primordial intercourse in the light of that 
morning of the world when it had become the target of Rudra's ar­
row. The shot rang through hundreds and thousands of years from 
the lJ-g Veda through the Briihma'tl-as, and, though it did not gather 
momentum, it was heard through the Mahiibhiirata, and its reverber­
ations became louder and louder in the centuries of the Purii'tl-as, in 
the ongoing myth of Rudra. 
After Taraka was defeated by Karttikeya, the son of Siva, the three 
sons of Taraka-the demons Tarakakøa, Kamalakøa, and Vidyun­
malin, or Sun-Eye, Lotus-Eye, and Lightning-Wreathed, respec­
tively-practiced austerities, and Brahma granted a boon to these as­
cetics. They asked for immortality, but Brahma never granted this 
boon because he was unable to give it. They then asked for another 
boon that would, so they hoped, be practically as efficacious. They 
wanted to live in three fortified cities, whence they would rove all over 
the world. After a thousand years they would come together, and 
their cities would be united into one. Only that god who could pierce 
the three cities with one arrow would be able to cause their destruc­
tion (MBh.8.24.4-1 2). 
Indra had been unable to defeat the troublesome demons. The 
gods asked Rudra to slay them, and promised that the animals slain 
in every sacrifice would be his (MBh,7. 1 73.S2-SS). The gods offered 
Rudra his share in the sacrifice. They accepted his condition, for they 
had no other chance of victory over the demons; even their own sur­
vival was threatened. 
The three Asuras commissioned Maya, their master architect, to 
build the three cities-one each of gold, silver, and iron-in the sky, 
air, and on earth, respectively (MBh.8.24. 13- 16). From their cities, the 
three demon kings soon assailed the three worlds (MBh.8.24. 1 9). The 
demons were full of energy, for Maya fulfilled the wish of everyone 

C O S M I C  D E MON S · 4 07 
living in the three cities (MBh.8.24.22). Within their metal walls, the 
cities were equipped with every convenience and luxury, including 
parks and ponds. What is more, Hari, the son of Star-Eye and himself 
a great ascetic, won a boon from Brahma. It was a pond of a special 
kind, for it brought back to life those slain in battle when their bodies 
were thrown into the reviving water (MBh.8.24.23-26). Or it was a 
well, full of amrta, and with the same properties of restoration, which 
Maya created (MP.136.8-1 6). 
The magicအke or well in the golden city, with its vivifying water, 
produced by the tapas of Hari and a boon from Brahma, or by the 
maya of Maya the Asura, was a replica of Gold-Eye's city, or derived 
from the waters in the netherworld wherein burned the perpetual 
flame ofVaQava's head, born of the fire of Rudra. The fire-mare lived 
in the waters, at the bottom of the netherworld, whither the waters 
had fallen from the Beyond, where they had been held captive, by the 
great Asura Vrtra. These vivifying waters, guarded by the great 
Asura, on his defeat and death by Indra's hand had fallen into Patala, 
the netherworld, the substratum and source of the enjoyments that 
Rasatala, the domicile of the fallen demons, provided for them. The 
austerities of the demon Hari, and a boon of Brahma, had created the 
lake in the golden city. Its miraculous water had fallen from the 
deathless Beyond, the Uncreate, the source of life, into the nether­
world, flooding its fieဢ>"ith the power vested in it by its origin and 
now rendered available to the demons in their dispersion all over the 
world, once their dead bodies were immersed in the lake of the 
golden city. From the same source Kavya U sanas, priest of the Asuras, 
had received the secret of bringing the dead back to life. By the pos­
session of the well or pond whose water revived the dead fallen in bat­
tle, the demons possessed a limited substitute for the freedom from 
death that Brahma had been unable to grant them. 
In spite, however, or because of their opulence and abundance, all 
did not go well with the demons. Though they had everything, they 
became overbearing and, insensate in their greed, they began to in­
vade and ruin the towns and cities all over the world (MBh.8.24.28-
30). Now the time had come for the gods to appeal to Siva. They 
praised him who is unborn and is Lord of the Universe, robed in an­
imal skins, the lord of all trees, of all kine, the lord of all sacrifices 
(MBh.8.24·36-S 1 ). Siva agreed to slay the demons. and preparations 
for the attack on the three cities commenced (MBh.8.24.64-6S). 

4 08 • D E M O N S  
Under the instructions of Vis va karman, their architect, the gods be­
gan to build the chariot of Siva (MBh.8.24.67). The mind was the 
ground on which the chariot stood; the earth was the body of the 
chariot; sun and moon were the chariot's wheels, the four Vedas the 
four steeds, and Brahma was the charioteer (MBh.8.24.75, 68, 71, 
103, 108). Siva mounted his chariot (MBh.8.24'93)' In ancient times, 
as Rudra, he had sat on the seat of his chariot, piercing with his 
weapon like a wild beast (RV.2.33.1 1 ). The chariot set out for Tri­
pura, the triple city. As Siva ascended the chariot, the horses fell to 
the ground on their knees, but Brahma, seizing the reins, urged on 
the horses. With horses swift as the wind, they approached the three 
cities. Siva strung the bow and, when the three cities became united, 
Siva discharged the arrow and the triple city began to fall. Burning, 
the Asuras sank into the western ocean (MBh.8.24. 1 10-2 1 ;  cf. 
MP. 138·39, 4°)· 
The Tripura myth is told in the Puriu:tas in many versions con­
cerned with the deterioration and corruption of the demons, which 
justified Siva's attack.19 Tripura, the demon city, had become a site of 
religious dissent, heresies, and lawlessness. It had sunk from the 
world of myth into that of history, and was ripe for destruction when 
Siva mounted his chariot. 
i. The Bull, ViglU, and Siva 
Vi\il)u had come to Siva's aid and had raised his chariot when, con­
trary to all expectation, this glorious vehicle, the earth, replete with all 
the powers of the cosmos, had begun to sink (MP. 1 36'54-59; 
SP.2.5.9.7-8; LP. 1 .72.28-3 1 ). Vi\il)u alone could raise the earth. Once 
before he had raised the earth when she had sunk. At that time she 
had sunk into the ocean, depressed by all the evil perpetrated on her. 
At that time Vi\il)u had taken the shape of a boar;20 now, however, 
Viøl)u took the appropriate shape of a bull, Siva's bull who is Dharma 
(VDhP.3.48. 1 8),21 law and order in the cosmos and in the world of 
man. Viøl)u, the bull, raised Siva's chariot by his horns (MP . 1 36.58-
59)· 
Viøl)u as a bull gave double support to Siva. By his own will god 
Viøl)u had come out of Siva's arrow (cf. LP . 1 .72.24) to raise his chariot

and, giving this support in the shape of a bull, yiglU became Siva's 
own trusted vehicle, which from ancient times had "conveyed" Siva in 
both senses of the word. Siva, "bull of bulls," who can be approached 
by yoga only had the bull as vehicle and cognizance of his power. But 
when the bull conveyed the Great Yogi who rides or dances on its 
back (Siva images from eastern India of about the eleventh century 
A.D. show Siva dancing on Nandin), the bull named Nandin, 'Joy," is 
Dharma iJelf, an image of controlled power. 
Having raised Siva's chariot, ViøQu the bull trampled over the de­
mons and right into Tripura, where he destroyed the flower beds and 
drank up all the amrta in the lake. Then he returned to Siva 
(MP .136.63-65). ViøQu acted according to the dharma of his self­
chosen station. 
Another time, after the Churning of the Ocean, Siva himself took 
the shape of a bull in order to set things right when they had gone out 
of control. As the amrta emerged from the ocean, bewitching girls ap­
peared from the drops of spray. They were Apsarases, nymphs 
(SP.3.22.20-22). The demons quickly took them to their lavish houses 
in the netherworld (SP.3.22.36-37). ViøQu, in pursuit of the van­
quished demons, on seeing the young enchantresses made love with 
them and engendered many wanton sons who ravaged heaven and 
earth (SP.3.22.4Jဣ&). Siva saw the havoc done by ViøQu's sons 
(SP.3.22.55). He entဤred the netherworld, bellowing terribly, for he 
had taken the shape of a bull. With his horns and hoofs he killed them 
and kicked Vi(iQu, who had invited all divine beings to take part in the 
orgy, back to his senses (SP.3.23. 1-13). Having cursed them all, Siva 
said that whoever except a self-contained sage or a demon born of 
Siva enters that place will die immediately (SP. 3.23.33). Siva himself 
provided for both exceptions. He himself fulfilled the first condition, 
for his senses were controlled, and he had demons as his sons. A self­
controlled sage would either take no notice at all of the enဥhantresses, 
or he would not be affected whether he took one or many of them; in 
fact, his tapas would increase in their tempting presence that could not 
erotically excite his emotion while he ဦenced sexual pleasure, 
whereas the demons would succumb to temptations (SP.2.3. 18.44; 
KS .1 .59).22 When Vi(iQu had assumed the shape of Siva's bull, he also 
assumed its nature and its mission to defeat unruly demon powers.

ii. The Child o n  Parvati's Lap 
While the triple city began to burn, Parvati came to see the spectacle. 
She had then on her lap a child with five tufts of hair on his otherwise 
bald head. She asked the gods who that child was. Indra did not like 
it, and was about to strike the child with his thunderbolt. Smiling, the 
child paralyzed Indra's arm. Indra and the gods went to Brahma and 
told him about the strange happening. Brahma knew that the child 
was Siva. Brahma asked the Great God to be gracious to Indra. The 
gods then praised Siva in a magnificent hymn (MBh·7· 1 73·57-69; 
1 3. 145.28-41 ). 
Parvati had come as a spectator, when the battle was won and the 
triple city of the Asuras was being consumed by flames. Suddenly, a 
child was on her lap. She did not know it, and she asked the gods who 
that child was. She was baffled by its appearance, Indra resented it, 
but Brahma knew its identity. It bore Siva's sacred number five on its 
head as a cognizance. It was Siva, the cruel god, whom the gods on 
account of his cruelty had chosen to burn the three cities. But the 
child, smiling in its cruelty, became the gracious god and restored 
Indra's arm. 
Parvati, the Great Goddess, the childless goddess, found Siva-her 
child, as it were-on her lap. He was Mahadeva, the Great God, born 
from no mother and at the height of his power. He had conquered 
the demons in the manifest world, his realm, which they had invaded. 
In the hour of his triumph, Parvati found the Great God anew. He 
had come to the lap that he had left barren, and she felt his presence, 
cradling the infant as if he were her son. 
In another context, Siva, in the form of an infant crying in the cre­
mation ground full of ghosts, drew the Great Goddess toward him. 
She had assumed the dark horrendous shape of Kali, and had just de­
feated the demon Daruka. She was still full of fury, which Siva was 
eager to imbibe. Deluded by Siva's maya and not recognizing him, the 
goddess bent down and took up the crying infant, kissed it, and suck­
led it. He drank the fury of the dire goddess along with her milk. Siva 
then assumed his AHamurti form; he showed himself as the entire 
universe, in which her excessive fury had been allayed. At dusk, the 
lord of gods, in order to propitiate the goddess, danced the Tal)Qava 
dance. His host of ghosts and the leaders of goblins accompanied the 
dance. The Great Goddess drank in the ambrosial flavor of the dance, 

COSM I C  D E M O N S · 4 1 1  
and danced herself in the midst of the ghosts, along with the yoginis 
(LP . 1 . 106. 14-26). 
Before Tripura, Siva gave himself to the goddess as her child, 
though leaving her unaware whence it had come and who it was. She 
received the Lord, a formidable gift, her child. Or he let himself be 
found by her, let her, the dread goddess, feel motherly so that he 
could absorb within himself her anger. Leaving behind the deceptive 
maya shape of t-lJ infant, the lord of gods, the Prime Mover of all, 
showed himself as the cosmos. Refreshed by the goddess's maternal 
milk of fury, he danced the Tal)Qava at dusk in the cremation 
ground, and the goddess joined the dance of the lord of destruction­
creation in the burning grounds. 
Siva danced and caused others to dance. The holy family danced. 
It was before Tripura that Karttikeya danced. A late Pural)ic myth 
times Parvati's appearance before Tripura differently from the Maha­
bharata. She had been with Siva when he decided to destroy the triple 
city of the demons. Playfully, she diverted his attention to Karttikeya, 
their son, beautifully groomed by his mothers, the Krttikas and Svaha 
(the last-named, though his primary mother, has not been accounted 
for in the present context). Siva feasted his eyes on him. Forgetting 
the harassed gods and the demons, he embraced his son and asked 
him to dance. ,The 1;ଘd!IJg gal)as danced along with him and, at the 
command of Siva, the entire three :worlds danced. The gods were 
puzzled, then excited, and finally dejected, until Nandin, riding on his 
white bull, admonished the gods to build Siva's chariot, as the triple 
city was as good as destroyed (LP. 1 .7 1 .  1 1 7-63). Siva let himself ex­
press his joy through his son, to the delight of Parvati. Even so, the 
gods began to build the stupendous war chariot for Siva, who as­
,cended the glorious though somewhat overweight vehicle. 
iii. Tripura in the Microcosm 
The ancient myth of the burning of the three cities was envisioned in 
the Mahabharata (MBh.>.24) aଙ enacted iଚhe cosmos by th: gods and 
the demons. The latter had mvade1:r-ind usurped the tnple world. 
The same myth, however, was also thought of as having the body of 
man for its scene. The actors were the same, even though they had 
different names: the Asuras entered the bodies of men. Then pride, 
which destroys man's dharma, arose. From pride arose anger, then 
shameful behavior, then delusion. People did as they pleased. Then 

4 1 2 · D E M O N S  
the gods appealed to Siva. With a single arrow they felled three de­
mons, together with their habitations. The chief of the demons, called 
Bhima, who struck the gods with terror, was slain by Siva. When this 
chief of the demons was slain people regained their former nature 
(MBh . 1 2 .283·8- 1 7)· 
The moralized version with the human being, the microcosm, for 
its playground was implicit in the cosmic myth. As told in the Maha­
bharata, the world calmed down and became normal after the defeat 
of the Asuras. The microcosmic version relates that the chief of the 
demons was slain by Siva himself; the other demons were felled by 
one arrow of the gods. 
The destruction of their tUree cities and the expulsion of the de­
mons from the cosmos was Siva's victory. He was persuaded, accord­
ing to the Mahabharata, by the promise that animals slain in every sac­
rifice would be his (MBh.7. 173.SS; 1 3. 1 4S.26), whereas in the earliest 
account of his victory over the Asuras, in the Taittiriya Sa1f1,hita, he had 
asked to be made Lord of Animals (TS.6.2.3. 1-2). The moralized ver­
sion contained the implication that the demons who entered the bod­
ies of men were the passions and failings that make man their habitat, 
their Tripura. The leaders of these demons were Pride, Anger, 
Shameful Behavior, and Delusion; their habitat was "natural" man, 
the pasu, the unregenerate human being. 
The moralized version, equating the three mighty demons plus a 
leader with the powerful passions, would be appropriate for the time 
when the truth that originally was in the Asuras had left them and 
had gone to the gods, and the untruth that was originally in the gods 
had left them and had gone to the Asuras. The demons, however, who 
flocked from the netherworld to settle in the three cities (MP . 1 3 1 .4-S) 
in the sky, in the air, arid on earth, lived virtuously. They lived in the 
pursuit of the three aims of life: in dharma, in accordance with their 
own station, and in the legitimate enjoyment of wealth and pleasure 
(artha and kama) (MP. 1 3 1 . 1O), for they got all they wanted through 
Maya's maya (MP. 1 3 1 .6), the magic, creative power of their great ar­
chitect, who had built the three cities. 
iv. The Drama in the Sky 
Maya was a great ascetic, and through Brahma's boon he built the 
three cities, each impregnable by itself. By his maya the great architect 
built another civilization, that of the demons (MP. 12g.23-2S; 1 30. 1-

COSM I C  D E M O N S · 4 1 3 
1 1 ). Its standards and achievements were analogous to those of the 
gods and men. The demons passed their life as happily as the gods in 
heaven (MP . 13 1 . 1  1 ). Maya also built a temple of Siva, for the demons 
worshiped Siva (MP . 13 1 . 1 3). Maya had built and completed the three 
cities when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Puøya 
(MP . 1 29.3 1 ;  1 30. 1 1 - 1 2 ;  1 32. 15-16). It would also be at the time of the 
conjunction of the asterism Puøya with the moon that the three cities 
would rise and meet the firmament (MP . 139'3-5)' Whoever would at­
tack these three cities at the time of their conjunction could destroy 
them by one arrow only (MP . 1 29.3 1-33). Who else but Lord Siva 
could destroy these three cities? (MP. 1 29'36; SP.2.5. 1 .51-52; 
SP·35·30-34)· 
Puøya is one of the twenty-seven lunar mansions, a constellation 
conspicuous neither for its size nor its brilliance. The name Puøya 
does not figure in the early myth of Rudra, when this star was known 
as Tiøya (Ch. 11.4). At that time, its mythical association with Rudra 
appears to have been established, although Rudra's star form was the 
Hunter of the Antelope, the star Mrgavyadha or Sirius. Yet, as it was 
said explicitly that Tiøya was Rudra (TS .2.2. 10. 1-2), it has now to be 
shown what might have led to the transfer of Rudra's association with 
Sirius to the Nakøatra or lunar station called Tiøya and subsequently 
Puøya. 
Sirius, the brilliant star, may be seen shooting rays like arrows, 
whereas Tiøya is a star conspicuous neither by size nor brightness. 
The lJ-g Veda (RV. 1O.64.8) invoked "Agni, Krsanu, Tiøya, the archers, 
Rudra, the true Rudra among Rudras" to come to the sacrifice. 
Whether the archers invoked here were Tiøya and Rudra, the true 
Rudra among Rudras, or Krsanu and Tiøya who is Rudra, is left open 
to interpretation. The Taittiriya Sa1Jlhitii, however, left no doubt about 
the identity of Tiøya and Rudra. 
What would have been the reason or one of the reasons of making 
Tiøya the star of Rudra? A favorable time for performing the bull sac­
rifice (sulagava) to Rudra was after the full moon of Tiøya / Puøya 
(GGS'3. 1O. 1 8 ;  SSS .4. q. I -3 and commentary; cf. TS .2.2. 10. 1).23 This 
sacrificial date was Rudra's, apparently even before he was admitted 
by the other gods to their sacrifices. 
The name Puøya as that of the sixth lunar mansion occurs already

in the Atharva Veda.24 It was synonymous with Tiya, and, in the end, 
the name Tiya was replaced altogether by Puya as that of the sixth 
house of the moon.25 
The three cities of the Asuras were situated on the earth, in the air, 
and in the sky (MP. 1 29.33-34). They had to come together, be 
aligned, and form one city. Then only could they be pierced by 
Rudra's arrow. The cities rose from the earth and the air, and met the 
city in the sky; they formed the 'Three-fort" city, Tripura. Rudra 
pierced it with one arrow and, burning, it fell into the western ocean. 
When he had discharged his arrow, Lord Siva the Great God wept on 
account of Mayaဆho would perish (MP . 140'44-49). Siva saved Maya 
and his palace from under the sea (MP . 1 40.50-52, 75). The palace 
was then seen where Dhruva, the Pole Star is, but Maya moved to an­
other region where he felt safe (MP. qo.80). 
The cities of the Asuras had been the enemy's bastions in the triple 
world. They had fortification walls of shiny metal. When they came 
together in the sky they were dazzling. 
To begin with, in the Briihma'(las, the strongholds of the Asuras 
were the three worlds. Having conquered them, the demons occupied 
them and made these, their worlds, into forts. Rudra sent his fire ar­
row, or the gods did it by the power of their rites, and the three 
forts-the universe-were filled with fire. It was a world conquest, a 
universal conflagration that wiped out the demons from earth, air, 
and sky, and left them untouched in their domicile, the netherworld. 
This was the late Vedic conception of the three strongholds of the 
Asuras. 
Subsequently, in .the Mahiibhiirata, the three strongholds of the de­
mons were said to have been built as fortified cities in the three worlds 
and thence, from these cities, the demons would roam all over the 
worlds. These three cities were the work of the demon mastermind, 
Maya. They revolved, each on its level; they were part of a revolving 
universe. The Matsya Purii'(la specifies that each city occupied a square 
of one hundred yojanas (MP . 1 29.3 1), that is, eight hundred or nine 
hundred miles. The square plan was basic in Indian architecture,26

and its size mythical. Whereas the Mahabharata describes the cities as 
rotating, the Matsya Pura1Ja says the cities would go anywhere where 
they willed (MP. 1 30. 15). Extent and mobility of the three strongholds 
changed. Originally conterminous with the extent-and subsequently 
also with the motion--of the manifest world, they were assigned a 
shape and size of their own and, according to the Matsya Pura1Ja, also 
a motion of their own, as they would go anywhere they willed. Origi­
nally, the arrow that pierced the three strongholds set the whole 
world afire. Subsequently, the three strongholds were no longer con­
terminous with the extent of the three levels of the cosmos on which 
they were built; and lastly, they were given movements of their own. 
The Tripura myth changed in the course of time from the concep­
tion of the triple universe usurped by the demons to that of three 
strongholds of large, though limited, extent, built on its levels and 
moving with them; and, finally, the movement of the cities was ac­
cording to will; the strongholds were envisioned as shiny units, having 
their own movements. They would have to come together in the sky 
so that they could be pierced by one arrow. 
Originally the Tripura myth had a cosmo-symbolical dimension. 
Rudra regained for the gods a universe from which they had been 
ousted. His mythical arrow was equivalent in efficacy with the upasad 
rites performed by the gods with Agni as their agent. In the course 
of time, this coming together of the strongholds in one universal con­
flagration, in which Agni lay in triple armor encased in iron, silver, 
and gold, yielded to a vision no longer of mythic, universal signifi­
cance but of temporal, astronomical urgency. Although no explicit 
data were given in the Pura1Jas other than the time of the Puńya yoga 
for the three cities to come together, or be aligned in such a way that 
"Rudra could pierce them with one arrow, and other than that these 
three strongholds had their own movements, still the three strong­
holds, it would appear, were seen as three planets that at a certain 
Puńya yoga were close together and in one line with the position of 
Rudra, the archer. Their triple conjunction had to be in one straight 
line with Sirius. 
The triple conjunction of planets could have been seen in the vicin­
ity of Orion at more than one date. No further specification, however, 
being given in the Pura1Jas, the particular date of the cyclically recur­
rent phenomenon of three planets in conjunction near Orion and 

4 1 6 · D E M O N S  
aligned with Sirius cannot immediately be ascertainedP At the time 
of its observation, mythical thinking recognized Rudra, the archer, his 
arrow directed toward his target, Tripura. The triple city had arisen 
in the region of the sky near Orion, the antelope, and was in one line 
with Sirius, whence Rudra, the Hunter of the Antelope, was seen to 
have let fiy his first arrow, aimed at the Father, Prajapati. Between this 
primeval initiating deed and the destruction of Tripura extends the 
ageless myth of Rudra. Though the destruction of Tripura was en­
acted in mythical time, cosmic phenomena were adduced as witnesses. 
The change in the scenario of the Tripura myth was linked, it ap­
pears, with a particular, observed astronomical configuration. 
Rudra, who became Kala, Time, was the main actor in his primor­
dial myth when Prajapati moved toward RohiI}1 and made love to her. 
Prajapati the year had transferred its beginning from its accustomed 
station in Orion toward Aldebaran. 
The beginning of the year, the renewal of life, had been considered 
fixed with the sun's rising in one and the same star. When this ob­
served and believed-in phenomenon was observed not to be an aevi­
ternal reality, but had changed so that the vernal equinoctial sun no 
longer rose in Orion, but had left that position, had gone toward Al­
debaran, the shock of this observation-though it must have been 
made over a very long time-had its mythical image in Prajapati's un­
pardonable movement toward RohiI}! (Aldebaran). The precession of 
the equinoxes that was known in its fulness and named by the Greek 
astronomer Hipparchus in 1 2 7  B.C. only, but which must have been 
observed in India over a very long time--even before and when the 
spring ဇquinox moved from Orion toward Aldebaran-became the 
cosmic, astronomically verified "moment," synchronized with the 
Father's approach to his daughter. 
Another moment, ominous and in this instance predictive, was wit­
nessed by Indra in his vision of a battle of gods and demons as the sun 
was rising in the Krttikas and the new moon was gliding into the sun, 
a moment predicting the birth of Karttikeya heralded by the sun ris­
ing in the Krttikas, the Pleiades;28 the rising of the vernal equinoctial

Pillai, suggests either 2270 B.C. or 503 B.C. as possible dates.

sun of an earlier aeon, in Aldebaran; and in a most distant past in Sir­
ius-these significant moments in the myth of Rudra (and Indra) 
were linked with the visible cosmos, the stage on which the gods were 
clothed with their imagined shapes and trappings. The stars signaled 
the events of their myths, they were the cosmic code that myth deci­
phered and translated in its own language. 
The time when the sun at the vernal equinox no longer rose in 
Orion but moved to Aldebaran was after 4500 B.C. More than a mil­
lennium later, the sun rose at the vernal equinox in Rohil)l / Alde­
baran and, more than another millennium after that, about 2200 
B.C.,29 the sun at the vernal equinox rose in the Krttikas, the Pleiades 
(Ch. IX·3)· 
The fourth myth of Rudra / Siva linked with a definite movement 
in the sky was that of the burning of the triple city of the Asuras by 
Rudra. In its last phase, it seems to have referred to a special conjunc­
tion of the moon and a star (Puya) that coincided with a particular 
configuration of certain planets and the star Sirius. 
If from the Matsya Puriirta onward an astronomical date was as­
signed to the burning of Tripura, elsewhere a terminus post quem is 
given by laying the corruption of the virtuous demons to the activities 
of a heretic teacher, who was the creation of Vil)u. This teacher 
converted the demons to Buddhism with the sole purpose of divert­
ing them from their worship of Siva (SP.2.5.3.45-2.5.6.28; cf. 
LP. 1.71.73-96; SP'34.24-7 1). The teacher of Buddhism as a creation 
of Vil)u would have been no other than the Buddha avatar of Vil)u. 
The Buddha avatar of Vil)u was established in Hinduism about a 
millennium after Gautama Buddha himself, that is, around the sixth 
century A.D.30 It may have been introduced earlier. 
The introduction into the narrative of the myth of a historically dat­
able occurrence such as the teaching of Buddhism-a heretic religion 
put into the mouth of the Buddha avatar of Vil)u, which depraved 
the virtuous demons-is secondary in importance to the inclusion, in 
the texture of the myth, of the luminaries, the signals of time. In the 
Vedic age, the occurrences in the sky were of paramount importance

for the timing of the sacrifices. Astronomy was a science ancillary to 
the Veda. The life of the gods depended on the sacrifices, their suste­
nance. 
Rudra, as soon as he entered his myth, was confronted by time, 
without which no action is possible. He let his arrow fly in mythical 
time-which lies before and is valid for all time-at the dawn of a sun­
rise that saw the paradigmatic event in which Rudra revealed his 
being. Time then was his antagonist, for that great Asura Rudra / 
Agni had just stepped out of the Uncreate, making ready the seed for 
the Father. 
Rudra, in his ongoing myth, became Time itself, Kala, and his 
myth, at significant points, was linked with momentous movements 
observed in the sky. God Indra was struck by a particular sunrise of 
ominous portent, in the Krttikas, the Pleiades, which heralded the 
birth of Karttikeya, whom the Pleiades were to nurse. 
The age of the linking of the myth of Rudra / Pasupati, on the one 
hand, and of the myth of the vision of Indra heralding the birth of 
Karttikeya, on the other, with astronomical events observed by the 
unaided eye of god or man, his priest, can be ascertained astronomi­
cally, whereas the latest versions of the burning of Tripura would be 
from an age cognizant of Buddha's word, enounced by the Buddha 
avatar of ViøI:lu, datable historically. 
v. Siva's Animals 
The demons were worshipers of Siva. They were true devotees. 
Whether they were good or evil did not matter, for even though they 
would commit sin, they would be absolved from it and were protected 
by worshiping Siva (SP.l!.S'3'S-7; LP. 1 .71 .67-71 ). The situation was 
complicated, for the demons were the enemies of the gods, and there­
fore had to be destroyed whether they were good or bad. But what­
ever they were mattered little, because although they were the. ene­
mies of the gods, they were worshipers of Siva, and the loyalty of the 
god to his devotees was intense. A means had to be found to make it 
possible for Siva, in whom the gods saw their only savior, and who had 
committed himself to saving them, to destroy the demons of Tripura. 
ViøI:lu once again came to Siva's aid. By his maya ViøI:lu succeeded 
in obstructing the worship of Siva, and he won the demons away from 
Siva. ViøI:lu, however, was not a free agent. It was by Siva's command 
that ViøI:lu deluded the demons (SP.2.5.3.45-S0). The divine means 

COSM I C  D E M O N S · 4 1 9 
of leading the demons away from the worship of Siva were more de­
vious than the corruption that they effected. The corruption con­
sisted in leading the demons away from the worship of Siva, and in 
leading their wives, separately deluded by Røi Narada, to promiscuity 
(SP. 2.5.4. 1-1g; 2.5.55-61 ;LP. 1.71.g2). The entire Tripura became con­
verted and demoralized; Viøl)u was satisfied, and Siva felt free to at­
tack Tripura (SP.2'5.6.2-3, 34-35 ; LP. 1 .7 1 .g4-95, 1 1 7-19). The heresy 
of the demons as motivation to induce Siva to destroy the demons­
though he had his scruples-was a theme introduced in the later Pur­
iiŅas. Tripura lost its mythical dimension and became a center of re­
ligious polemics and politics. Oppressed by their weight, Viøl)u-in 
his bull shape-slipped. When Siva got into his chariot made of the 
entire earth with all its riches and values, the Veda-horses fell head­
long down to earth, and Viøl)u, "the supporter of the earth," taking 
the shape of a bull, only for a moment succeeded in raising the char­
iot; in the next moment he fell to the ground on his knees. At the in­
stance of Siva, Brahma as the charioteer finally succeeded in steady­
ing the chariot and, with his mind as swift as the wind, drove on to the 
triple city (LP . 1 .72.2g-33)' Just then the three strongholds were seen 
in the sky (SP.2.5.9. 1 2). It was then that Siva asked the gods to give 
him lordship over the animals (SP.2.5.9. 1 3). This was the crucial 
point in the victory of the gods over the demons. At this moment Siva 
asked the gods to give him the lordship over animals (TS.6.2.3. 1-2 ; 
SP.2.5.9. 13; LP . 1 .72.34), or the gods promised him that animals slain 
in every sacrifice would be his (MBh.7. 1 73.55). Prajapati, at the begin­
ning, on the first morning of Rudra's myth, had offered the cruel, 
Wild God the lordship over animals if Rudra desisted from killing 
him. Before the fall of Tripura, Siva demanded the lordship over an­
imals before he would kill the demons and free the gods from fear. 
Prajapati, for the latter reason, had made Rudra Lord of Animals, Pa­
supati, in return for Rudra's grace. 
Rudra had put forth his claim to the animals at the burnt-out lake 
of Prajapati's seed, for its embers and ashes had turned into animals 
and he had relinquished his claim. He gave to Nabhanediø{ha, nearest 
to him of Vedic seers, the cattle due to Rudra himself at the sacrifice 
of the Angirases. Again and again Rudra, Lord of Animals, asserted 
his claim to the animals. The animals sacrificed at every sacrifice were 
to be his. The Vedic sacrificial animals were goat, sheep, horse, bull, 
and finally man, for whom the other animals substituted as sacrificial 

4 2 0  • D E MO N S  
victims. All creatures were the animals of Lord Siva, and he made the 
gods his animals not only at Tripura but also at DakĠa's sacrifice, from 
which he had been excluded. It was an act of retribution by the Wild 
God. He destroyed the sacrifice, maimed the gods, deprived them of 
their creativity and senses. They had come to know the destructive 
power of Rudra by indirection, when they themselves, in their anx­
iousness to preserve it, took the first part of the offering, the prasitra, 
to one god after the other; it injured and maimed each one when he 
tasted it. The first part of the offering was charged with Rudra's 
power. As his arrow, it had pierced Prajapati. That pierced part was 
the fore-offering, the prasitra, that wreaked havoc among the Vedic 
gods. Later, when they graced DakĠa's sacrifice with their presence, 
Siva / Virabhadra made felt his unwanted presence. The act of de­
priving them of their creativity was a substitute for the wound in­
flicted by Rudra's arrow on Prajapati. 
At the sacrifice of DakĠa, Siva deprived the gods of their creative 
powers, reduced them to the state of animals, that very state in which 
Prajapati the antelope could not help shedding his seed. Rudra 
avenged the animality of Praj;ipati, the Creator procreating. 
"How did the gods, including Brahma, become animals?" ask the 
sages in the Linga Pura'!Ul. "How did Pasupati, the Great Lord, come 
to burn the three cities of the demons?" (LP . 1 .7 1 . )  -2). These ques­
tions were asked at the beginning of the chapters on the destruction 
of Tripura in the Linga Pura'[ta. They follow the chapter on the proc­
ess of creation (LP. )  .70). The burning of the triple city of the demons 
was not the end of creation. A cleansed, regenerate world began with 
its fall. The demons had been corrupted. Siva was ready to destroy 
th࿽ corrupted demons, but not before the gods had declared them­
selves to be animals. The gods were reluctant to accept this status, dis­
inclined to admit that they were animals, unregenerate creatures, 
pasus. Siva assured them that on recognizing- him as their lord, they 
were freed from the fetters (pasa) that bound them to the objects of 
their desire. To corrupt the demons so as to justify burning them was 
an act of exoneration of Siva, for the demons, though the enemies of 
the gods, were his devotees. The gods, on the .other hand, for whose 
sake Siva was about to destroy Tripura, like human beings and all who 
are created, lived in their natural, congenital state, which they took 
for granted. Siva made them see themselves as animals, and having 
thus made them into animals (PaSu), he alone could free them and be-

COS M I C  D E M O N S ' 42 1  
come their Lord, Pasupati Siva, the lord of all sentient beings. They 
observed the Pasupata vrata, and all the gods became the Lord's crea­
tures. Siva untied the snares (pasa) of each pa.su, of each individual 
(SP.2.5.9. 1 3-24). In the meanwhile, when Siva had decided to destroy 
Tripura, Parvati drew Siva's attention to Karttikeya, and Siva asked 
him to dance. All the leading gal)as danced with him, the entire uni­
verse danced at the moment (LP. 1 . 7 1 . 1 19-3 1 )  of Siva's resolve to de­
stroy Tripura. As he stood in his chariot, Siva glanced at the three cit­
ies. They were instantly reduced to ashes. The gods said that even 
though the cities had been burned by his mere glance, Siva ought to 
discharge the arrow for their benefit. Then Siva, laughing, dis­
charged his arrow (LP · 1 .72. 1  10- 14; SP·35·42, 43)· 
Why indeed should Siva, who could destroy the whole universe 
with his mind, have mounted his chariot accompanied by all his gal)as 
to burn Tripura? It was just for the sake of his play (filii). What other 
benefit had he to derive from this elaborate spectacle? (LP. 1 .72.95-97; 
SP·35·30-32) . . 
From the entry of Fire into the iron, silver, and gold strongholds of 
the Asuras to the allegoric extravaganza of the Puriir:zas, Siva's fire-ar­
rOw loomed large. By its power Rudra became Pasupati, the Lord of 
Animals; they were his to be slain, left unscathed, protected, or re­
leased. The first animal in Rudra's power was the Creator himself; fi­
nally, all creatures became Rudra's animals. He liberated them from 
their animal nature, he removed their fetters; he was their savior. The 
recognition and designation of Rudra as Mahadeva, "the Great God," 
occurred, according to the Mahiibhiirata, when the gods decided to 
build his chariot on which he was to conquer Tripura (MBh.8.24.63). 
From the beginning, the Wild Archer, the Hunter, had been made 
Lord of Animals by Prȳapati. Yet Rudra had not been accepted by 
the other gods until they had to recognize him as Mahadeva, to whom 
they gave half of all their energies (MBh.8.24 . .62), so that armed with 
bow and arrow he ascended his chariot. He had been slighted, hum­
bled, excluded from the sacrifice. In the beginning the Creator him­
self, whether actually or potentially, had been his sacrificial animal, 
the victim of the first of Rudra's arrows sent forth in creation against 
the creaturely act of procreation, the shedding of the seed, the· sub­
stance from out of the pleroma of the Uncreate. 

XII 
THE PRESENCE OF SIVA 
1 .  CONSPECTUS 
"0 Wealth, my treasure, honey, red flame of heavenly hosts that ex­
cels all lustre, embodied One, my kin, my flesh, heart within my flesh, 
image within my heart, my all-bestowing tree, my eye, pupil of my 
eye, image seen in that pupil, save me from the disease of the pow­
erful karma ,"I Saint Appar of the seventh century sang to Siva. 
Flaming, glowing, palpably near, and in him, embodied in his own 
flesh, in his heart and eye, the saint saw the image of the Savior. 
The Wild God, a hunter, his arrow afire, had been seen before life 
had come to be. Right into its nascent future he released his arrow­
its searing thrust went deep. Its sharp, burning point fixed the begin­
ning of life on earth in the world of Rudra. Had it not been for the 
terror of this entry of the god into his world, Appar could not have 
felt the god throbbing in his flesh, could not have seen the red flame 
of heavenly hosts carry the image that he held in his heart and that 
was reflected in his eye. 
Rudra's world starts with the flight of his arrow precisely aimed at 
the Father, the Creator in the act of procreation. He shed seed and 
some of it fell on the earth. His seed held all life to be; it was a potent 
substance made ready by Agni / Rudra and never shed before. It was 
in the Father before it was stirred by the sight of his daughter, con­
substantial with and hypostasized by him just then. Her separation 
from him provoked Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, to seek union 
with her; spontaneously, the Creator seized her, united with her as

C O N S PE C T U S ' 4 2 3 
creatures do. He acted as, and had the shape of, an animal, an ante­
lope. While the seed of the Creator fell, the gods made of it a brahman 
and gave it the shape of VastoĠpati. It fell into creation. Before that 
the mysterious substance of the seed had been contained within the 
Uncreate, a state beyond and before creation. Inviolate in its integrity 
of total potentiality, the Uncreate was a pleroma, beyond existence, 
metaphysical, transcendent, beyond the reach of words, prior to and 
beyond action in which myth has its beginning. The Uncreate had its 
guardians, who knew this unconditioned, ultimate secret. 
Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, was about to release it when he 
became Rudra's target. Only an act of violence could prevent the vi­
olation of the Uncreate. Ablaze, Rudra discharged his arrow. He was 
Fire who had prepared the seed, heating it beyond Prajapati's endur­
ance, and the Lord of Generation let it flow down to earth. 
Rudra / Agni, bivalent in his double attack on the Father, made 
sure of his prey, whom he had excited, incited, and caught in the act. 
Rudra was a fiery hunter, the fire oj creation and in creation to be. 
Flaming, he had taken his stand at the boundary of the Uncreate be­
yond which no mind could reach. Thence he discharged his arrow. It 
flew at the first dawn of the inception of life, hit its target and nearly 
missed its aim. The arrow, sent flying as the Father embraced the 
daughter, struck as he cohabited with her, and some seed fell down 
on the earth. 
Rudra, the guardian of the Uncreate, the Fire and cause of crea­
tion; the fierce Archer, by his first action brought about time. Without 
it no action can take place, nor can a place be reached without it. The 
arrow, a fraction of time too late, failed to separate the mating pair 
before seed was shed. The substance of the Uncreate flowed into cre­
ation. 
Having incited it, Rudra interrupted Prajapati's intercourse. 
Rudra, the Fire, caused and stimulated a result that the Wild God 
meant to prevent. As Agni he stood on the boundary ofthe Uncreate; 
his flame lashed hitherwards and heated the Father's seed. As Rudra 
he aimed at the procreating Father this side of the boundary. Praja­
pati faced hitherwards, Rudra faced the Uncreate, whose guardian 
and exponent he was and whose integrity Time prevented him from 
preserving. He struck the creator / progenitor, and the arrow stuck in 
his genitals. He "killed" the Father only to revive him, or he spared 
his life.

Rudra, guardian of the Uncreate and avenger of its loss of integ­
rity, was the antagonist of the creator / procreator who acted as ani­
mal (paiu) according to the spontaneous compulsion of its nature. 
Rudra spared the life of Prajapati on the condition that the Lord of 
Generation make Rudra Lord of Animals. The Creator himself thus 
became Rudra's charge, as did every animal, every sentient being that 
would be created, man or god, and other animals, wild and tame. By 
the Aight of his arrow, the Wild God, guardian of the Uncreate, be­
came the murderer of the Father and the protector of all creatures, 
including the Creator. Inasmuch as he was Fire, Rudra had Aared up 
at the limit of mind's grasp, at the frontier of the Uncreate; inasmuch 
as he was the Wild Hunter, he killed the Father; and inasmuch as he 
was God, he spared his victim's life and was acknowledged as Pasu­
pati, the Lord of Animals, who protects the creature. The guardian 
of the Uncreate, the ultimate, unconditioned Reality, was fierce as 
Fire, a Wild Hunter incensed by the copulation of the Father and aim­
ing to prevent the Father's emission of seed, prognostic of his own 
birth and the beginning of life on earth. 
Though he did not succeed in this, his arrow stuck in the wound he 
had inAicted. The searing thrust of his arrow remained in the Aesh of 
the Creator. The gods preserved the wounded part. It was not larger 
than a barley corn, and wreaked havoc from sacrifice to sacrifice 
through Rudra's myth until that morsel was appeased. 
Rudra had acted in two directions, the one hitherwards into crea­
tion when he prepared the seed for the Father, the other backwards 
and away from this world. They lay on the same endless line that cuts 
across the boundary between the intelligible and the transcendental 
realms where Agni was stationed. Life came to earth in Prajapati's 
seed that Rudra had made ready. Its potency was of the Uncreate, 
and was immeasurable like the Uncreate itself. Paradoxically, the 
measureless plenum of the Uncreate remained measureless as it had 
been and is-when realized in samiidhi by the yogi. Withdrawn from 
action, Rudra the Wild Hunter is the Lord of Yoga, one with his Self, 
the measureless, inviolable homology of the Uncreate. 
The myth of Rudra begins with the primordial action of the God. 
Implied in it is its ground, the Uncreate, the consciousness of which 
prompted Rudra's action. Rudra is Consciousness and his actions are 
its forms. The Uncreate is the abiding content. Each of his move­
ments touches on it.

He assumed the appearance of a man of lowly station, a hunter in 
his primordial myth, uncanny and not gladly seen, though he was 
God. This the people felt, though they gave him as offerings only the 
remnants of their own food, or even things not fit to be eaten. They 
also celebrated sacrifices exclusively his own, but these had to take 
place outside the village. He was an outcast among gods; they did not 
want to see him at their own sacrifices, but the herdsmen saw him and 
the women on their way to get water from the pond. Those who were 
of low station and made their living in a demanding, hazardous, or 
devious way knew him, for he threatened or protected them. He had 
that power; their life was in his hands. They were afraid of him, and 
where he did not harm them they worshiped him in his power and 
grace. Perhaps they had no words to contain his awful greatness. The 
words were given 10 a seer who in divine vision witnessed the primor­
dial scene and sang of it in the raudra brahman (RV. IO.6 1 . 1 ), the "song 
of the seed" (AB .6.27). 
In the primordial scene, Rudra not only showed his frightening 
power but also his control and, with it, his grace. He refrained from 
killing the Father, or if he did kill him he brought him back to life. 
Also, on more than one occasion, he refrained from taking the cattle 
that belonged to him (Ch. 1l1.2.a). His way was the mastery over life, 
not only of the gods or the animals but also his own, for he was an 
ascetic who controlled his power, and he was the god who let flow 
from it his grace. Fierceness was his nature and the reason why the 
other gods, though unwilling to accept him as their equal, recognized 
him as their lord, the Lord of Animals, Pasupati. His fierce fire as a 
hunter was directed outward; as a࿾ ascetic he held it within and it il­
lumined his being. He stood apart and was an outsider to the other 
Vedic gods. He could be recognized by his weird, mad looks. He 
seemed poor and uncared-for, neglectful of his appearance; the gods 
despised him, but he intentionally courted dishonor, he rejoiced in 
contempt and disregard, for "he who is despised lies happy, freed of 
all attachment" (PS .3.3 and commentary; cf. PS .3.7-9).2 The fierce, 
self-humiliated Lord was a yogi, and inasmuch as he was Fire, he 
burned within himself by the heat of his asceticism the pride of self­
abasement. He provoked contempt as a test of his detachment. It was 
confirmed by his willed exposure to contempt, by which he proved

426 ' PRESENCE O F  S I V A  
himself to be above contempt. Similarly, on other occasions, he let 
himself be sexually tempted in order to prove, and persist in, his brah­
macarya. To all appearances he was uncanny Rudra, the fierce god, 
because he burns, because he is fiery, because he devours flesh, blood, 
and marrow (cf. MBh.7. 173.98). 
Appearing as a wild hunter, his proper form on earth, he was 
feared and avoided, while sanctity emanated from his naked body, 
below ,the snakes and animal skins that he had slung around him. Be­
cause he was outside the pale of the other gods, he wanted to justify 
the attitudes of those who thought to demean him. He reinforced 
whatever was thought despicable in him; he made himself resemble 
the way in which he appeared to those securely established by the 
standards of their own position. He made himself the butt of their 
aversion, bringing to their notice exactly what they were capable of 
seeing in him. His was an asceticism that by intensifying his abject con­
dition clarified his detachment, while outwardly its state of exultancy 
appeared as madness. It was a closely fitted mask by which he asserted 
his freedom from any standard by which those who saw the Wild God 
would dare to judge him. Had he been man, pride might have cor­
roded his antics. Despised and rejected, he would low like a bull-his 
vehicle that would carry him through millennia of worship-he would 
laugh and dance as though mad. He drew to his appearance and riv­
eted on it baffled attention; he offered himself as a spectacle that cut 
through the prejudices and the limitations of his detractors. Though 
he transcended their understanding, he fascinated them. The gods of 
the lJ-g Veda who witnessed the primordial scene made of it a work of 
art in which the other face of the fierce Archer was revealed to them. 
In the primordial upheaval itself they saw the cosmogonic order that 
their creative mind obeyed; they made a poem, an audible form of 
their vision, and out of that substance they shaped the other side of 
Rudra: Vastowati, the Lord of the Dwelling, the guardian of sa,cred 
ordinance. 
Pasupati and VastoĠpati are two aspects of Rudra, opposed and 
complementary, part of the inscrutable physiognomy of Rudra / Siva. 
Extending the human metaphor to his body, it was half fire, like the 
sun, flame, and lightning, and half Soma, like the moon (cf. 
MBh.7. 1 73.9S); and also half male, half female, right and left. In him 
polarities coexist; it could not be otherwise. Should the one cancel out 
the other, at that very moment creation itself would cease to exist, and 

C O N S PECTUS ' 4 2 7 
God would have lost his body, the world. Even so, the polarity of the 
being of Lord Rudra is not completely described, for the Wild Hunter 
was his form of outgoing action that was willed and directed. Under 
the golden raiments wrapped round the loins of the Lord-manifest­
ing in a cosmic night-was the urdhvalinga of the yogi (Ch. VII.2). It 
was the ascetic's, the yogi's, special cognizance. The hunter who prac­
ticed the yoga of archery withdrew in samiidhi and returned into his 
self, where he was at one with his Self. 
He was alone, unborn, like the Uncreate. When he defied under­
standing he wanted to be despised. Fascinated by the horror of his 
abjectness, those who disregarded him were drawn to him. Though 
his real name should not be uttered, he had a hundred names to 
which he answered. They were part of his identity, but did not define 
him. 
He even had more forms than names; his forms were beyond num­
ber, for he lived in all beings-he was their life, its operative cause. 
Life, self-contained, was held within him. He did not engender life. 
While Rudra remained one, he was his own plural, the Rudras. The 
Rudras were everywhere. 
In the primordial dawn, as Rudra sent his arrow to its target, Time 
had intervened on the scene of Rudra's nascent cosmos. Before 
Rudra had recognized his antagonist, T࿿me had entered Rudra's 
presence. As Kala / Time, Rudra raced along. He was the movement 
itself of life, its breath, drawn by its momentum to outlive its forms 
that as Kala / Death he defined. Rudra left even Time and Death be­
hind, transcending them as Bhairava. When Rudra faced, and be­
came, Time, his direction was hitherward, in,to, through, and out of, 
creation. Once, however, moved by pity for living beings doomed to 
die, he cooperated with Brahma and, resorting to his yoga nature, let 
its calm flow into the current of time, so that life would rest and rise 
again in a new wave;. Rudra then acted as the Healer, though the pal­
liative of recurrent lives and deaths was not the remedy he would dis­
pense by his own will. At that time he helped Brahma out of a difficult 
situation into which the Creator had put himself and the creatures 
created by him. Rudra reserved his remedy for those who were strong 
enough to receive it. It would give them cessation of all sorrow, would 
free them from the misery of karma, would place them out of time and 
into the realization of ultimate reality in which they would be joined 
with Rudra. 

42 8 ' PRE S E N C E  O F  S I V A 
In the first dawn of the creation of man Rudra released his arrow. 
His burning energy went along with it, pierced and became embed­
ded in Prajapati, and Rudra became Prajapati's son (Ch. V. I). By this 
paradox, Rudra was to be born into the cosmos that was to be his own. 
When he had entered manifestation, he had neither mother nor 
father; now Prajapati, the Lord of Generation, became his father. Sit­
ting on his lap, the infant of cosmic dimension demanded to be given 
his names and to be established throughout the realm of his world. 
The cosmos became the embodiment of Rudra. Though he no longer 
appeared as a wild hunter, he retained his insignia, the bow and the 
arrow. Thence, Rudra's being unfolded in the cosmos, and the cos­
mos became his visible presence. He existed before creation and be­
fore time; he exists now and will continue to exist in the future; noth­
ing ever exists apart from him (AUP.2 and commentary). The long­
haired muni shared this knowledge. He drank with Rudra from the 
same cup. 
The myths of Siva have many levels. They have to be entered all at 
the same time, or else the total, multiple perspective of each is lost 
sight of. Crazed beggar, savior, necrophiliac, voluptuary, ascetic, he is 
each wholly on the plane where he acts, while on another plane he is 
Sadasiva, the eternal Siva, who lays out his presence in his five faces, 
of which the fifth, invisible in principle, is part of the pancamukha 
hnga, Siva's concrete, monumental symbol. 
With the thrust of his flaming arrow, Rudra's hot energy (tejas) en­
tered and was embedded in the Lord of Generation. "Prajapati saw in 
himself gold. He generated that gold." It grew and became Maha­
deva, the Great God (Ch. V. lob). An enthusiastic visionary, a Vratya, 
evoked and beheld this scene. The gold that the Vratya had seen first 
in Prȳapati and then, immediately, in front of the Lord of Genera­
tion was, according to another account, held in Prajapati's hands. It 
had the shape of a bowl and the dimensions of an arrow's flight. In 
his golden bowl Prajapati's seed by second generation was gathered. 
His sons had shed it on seeing his daughter, their sister. From it the 
Archer arose in cosmic size. He held a thousand arrows. He had a 
thousand heads. He filled the Universe, yet he was an infant-he 
clasped his father, demanding to be given a name. Full-fledged in his 
cosmic power, he had arisen from Prajapati's golden bowl, the womb 
as it were of the Lord of Generation, the material cause of the uni­
verse. 

CO N S PECTUS · 4 2 9 
Given his names and freed from the sin of his un forgotten past, 
Rudra was invested by his father with the cosmos and became the cos­
mos. He moved within it and exceeded it. "PuruĠa is this entire world, 
what has been and what will be and he is the lord of deathlessness" 
(RV.I0.g0.2).3 Vedic PuruĠa held no arrows in his thousand hands, 
and let himself be offered by the gods as the sacrificial offering which 
they sacrificed into creation. Rudra, the thousand-eyed PuruĠa with 
his thousand arrows, was born to release them into the world of men, 
gods, and demons-at DakĠa's sacrifice, or against Tripura. It was 
with the glance of fire from his third eye that he burnt to ashes Kama, 
the archer Desire. Serpents were wreathed around Siva meditating in 
a Himalayan cave, where Kama attacked the Great God. Serpents 
protected Siva; he wore serpents as amulets, ornaments, and his sa­
cred thread. They were coiled around him, as Vrtra, most ancient of 
all serpents, had lain coiled around the mountain. Jointly Vrtra and 
the mountain guarded the Uncreate-before Indra's creation. It is 
enjoined in the Grhya Sutras, the texts on domestic ritual, that one 
should make offerings to Rudra in a place where there are snakes (cf. 
AGS .4.8.27-28; cf. HGS . 1 . 16. 10). The ritual, of common practice, in­
voked Rudra to protect one from the dangerous, poisonous snakes, 
among whom he lived. The connection of Rudra and the serpents was 
felt in daily life. It had overtones not neces!sarily audible to everyone 
and not always present. To this day, a linga, over which a serpent rises 
with hood expanded, may be seen in worship in many a Saiva house­
hold. The truth about Siva comes from many levels, from Vedic in­
tuitions, or the devotion of jungle folk, and from those below and out­
side the brahmin elite. The gods of the latter, to begin with, were at 
odds with Rudra; they did not let him share the sacrificial offerings, 
.and he had his own priests who sacrificed to him (VtiP.30. 1 1 2, 1 1 3, 
1 19). The serpents, in the polyvalence of their meaning, cling to 
Rudra, the healer, who knows how to control them (TS45. I .Z); they 
shed their skins as symbols of renewal. Rudra alone could swallow the 
poison that Vasuki, the serpent king, had spat into the ocean; it beau­
tified Rudra's throat, made it gleam blue, the color of the peacock­
enemy of the serpents. He wore the mark of the serpent's poison as 
an ornament, as if a serpent had kissed him on that spot. "Shining 
with jewels or with glistening snakes, wearing an elephant hide or silk,

with skulls or the moon as his diadem, no one can comprehend Siva, 
who takes all forms" (KS .5.78). "His nature at once transcends and in­
cludes all the polarities of the living world."4 
Cooperating opposites within Siva's boundless orbit-Dr alterna­
tives such as snakes and jewels-would also reverse their meaning. 
What is poison or death to the ignorant is bliss or release to the know­
ing. From the beginning, the phallic shape of the Siva liitga, standing 
erect, negated its function as an organ of procreation. It was an 
urdhvaliitga, conveying by its erect shape that the seed was channeled 
upward, not ejected for the sake of generation, but was reversed in its 
course, retained and absorbed for regeneration. The mukhaliitga, the 
face liitga, a visual paradox in its unified shape of phallus and face, 
conveyed that the seed stirred sexually was controlled, rediverted, 
and absorbed mentally, and was a symbol of the metaphysical-onto­
logical reality of Siva. 
With the "birth of Rudra" from Prajapati's seed the God entered the 
cosmos, the world of his dispensation, and he became the cosmos. It 
was the first act in his play of manifestation. Man in the flesh had not 
yet come to be when Brahma, the Creator, in a successive aeon, con­
tinued Prajapati's work. The creation of human beings was Brahma's 
self-assigned task. According to Saiva tradition, he created Rudra to 
help him, for he had not been successful. Out of Brahma's frustra­
tion, out of the anger of his mind, Rudra was born anew; and 
Brahma, desperate to the point of perverse vindictiveness, charged 
Rudra, his ascetic, mind-born son, with the creation of mortals. 
Brahma had not forgotten what Rudra had done to the procreating 
Father, nor had Prajapati, from whose anger and tears, according to 
one account (Ch. V. I .b), Rudra had been born. By whatever mode 
Rudra had become the son of Prajapati, it was a birth by bodily filia­
tion, whether it took place from within Prajapati's body that had held 
the gold, the god to be, or by indirection from Prajapati's seed, or by 
Prajapati's tears that fell on Manyu, his anger. 
In his next birth and the second act of his play, Rudra was born 
from the mind or breath of Brahma, the Creator; Rudra asserted and 
maintained his asceticism, his aversion to procreation in his triple 
birth from Brahma's mind. He became SthaI)u, the Pillar; he cas­
trated himself, and, finally, sprang, an androgyne in shape, from 
4 H. Zimmer. Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization. 1946. pp. 1 25-1 26. 

CON SPECTUS · 4 3 1 
Brahma's furrowed brow. Sthal)u, the Pillar, was Siva's most cogent 
form of protest against Brahma's command to create mortals. Siva's 
castration-after he emerged from the water or in the Deodar for­
est-gave transcosmic significance to the severed liitga and established 
its worship on earth. Finally, in the form of Ardhanarisvara, Lord 
Siva was born from Brahma's mind in a prognostic form of humanity, 
an integer of man and woman, though, as god Siva's, the ascetic's, 
own shape he was precluded from sexual union by the hieratic bilat­
eral frontality of the-biune shape. This was as far as the Lord of Yoga 
would let himself be born from Brahma. Born as Ardhanarisvara, he 
followed, however, Brahma's command and divided himself, allowing 
the Great Goddess to proceed from and return into his self. There­
after, degree by degree, the Great Goddess allowed herself to be born 
from Dak(>a of the lineage of Brahma. She was the idea of woman, but 
in order to fulfill her role in Siva's play, she assumed the character of 
the headstrong yet fallible bride-to-be of Siva, whose childless wife she 
was destined to become. 
Throughout his two marriages, to Sati and to Parvati, Siva the Lord 
of Yoga did not engender a child in the womb of the Great Goddess.5 
Though his frightful potency on one 02casion persisted in the lap of 
Parvati for a thousand years of the gods, and made him oblivious of 
the world and his obligation to it, he remained self-contained and did 
not shed his seed. He was the Lord of Yoga. Parvatl had desired Siva 
because he was primarily a yogi. His fearsome appearance only en­
hanced the attraction she felt for him. Still, when the gods, for the 
well-being of the world, felt it necessary to interrupt the seemingly 
endless love making of Siva-who being a yogi did not stop-while 
her womb remained empty, she cursed the gods who had interrupted 
their intercourse as well as all the goddesses to be barren. Parvati's 
curse and the childlessness of the gods were a final sequel to the 
events in the primordial morning. When Siva's seed fell at last, it was 
an offering into the Fire. 
Siva and Parvati have been celebrated in'art and poetry, forming as

a (Ow consort of Isana in the shape of a bull, takes part in the Sulagava sacrifice along 
with {sana as a bull and their calf (S. K. Bhattacharji, The Indian Theogony, p. 1 42). 
Rudra's relation with the Prsni cow is of a special nature (RV.2.34.2. 1O; 5.52. 16; 5.60.5; 
6.66·3)· See Ch. VII n. 15 and Ch. VIII n. 7.

they do the most accessible aspect of the Great God, which he offered 
in his play. O'Flaherty, in her book Asceticism and Eroticism in the My­
thology of Siva, gives full insight into their relation. 
Both aspects, the ascetic and the erotic, were united in the symbol 
of the linga. Its ambiguously abstract and concrete shape was the pivot 
to which ontology gave its terms and ritual its service. To this monu­
mental symbol of manifestation the embodiments ofmanlra attached 
themselves in facial terms. Time, Kala, also found its identity in four 
of the faces in which Siva's fivefold presence was made manifest. Kala, 
whose face is as frightening as Death's, is as black as cosmic night. 
Kala means black, and Kala, the god who is one with Siva, is a mythical 
equivalent of Siva to whom tamas belongs in the cosmic texture. 
Tamas, the descending tendency, corresponds to the destructive qual­
ity of time. Just before the first cosmic dawn there was nothing but 
darkness (lamas). That darkness was Rudra (cf. MaUp.5.2). The dark­
ness before manifestation spread with the fall of the Asuras into the 
netherworld, or, according to the mythical terms of another cosmo­
gony, it lay all around A-bhu in the precosmic flood (RV. 1O. 1 2g.3). 
Beyond that darkness is Siva's transcendency (SUp.4. 1 8). Cosmogon­
ically and in manifestation, tamas, darkness, was part of the triple de­
sign of the fabric of the cosmos. Tamas, the dark strand of existence, 
belongs to Rudra. It was interwoven with the other two gu'l),aS repre­
sented by Brahma and Vil)u. 
Mythical time, a mode of the "eternal now"; contingent time that 
carries death; the time of grace, which Brahma and Siva conjointly 
granted to Death, the compassionate goddess, where activity and rest 
would follow one another like flood and tide, like waking and sleeping 
in recurrent rhythm: each manifestation of time was gathered in and 
overcome by the Ender of Time, transcendental Siva, eternity. 
Siva did not create his cosmos: he pervaded this domain of his that 
Prajapati had given him together with his names. These represented 
aspects of his being, facets of his totality meant to be seen in their co­
herence, though each would seem to stand or act on its own. Or one 
might see the many aspects of Siva in succession. The Ocean of Story, 
the Kathiisaritsagara, tells of a Siva linga in the heavenly abode of Siva, 
called Siddhisvara, where Siva was always present. The linga of Siva 
"exhibits in succession all his forms" (KSS . 1 l5. 1 1O- 1S).6 
The sequence of all of Siva's forms on one constant ground, a the-
6 Kathiisaritsiigara (KSS) , tr. C. H. Tawney and ed. N. M. Penzer, 1968, 8: 152.

ophany displayed in time, was different from the central presence of 
Siva sim ultaneously with his four faces in the four directions on a pan­
camukha liitga. An actual or mental rite of circumambulation would 
not lose sight of the center, while the parts would be seen from dif­
ferent angles. 
An analogous method of seeing Siva is to consider the several ver­
sions of a myth to be like the stations of a mentally performed rite of 
circumambulation, in which the total meaning shows itself together 
with its gradual changes. The skull fantasy of the Skanda Purarw (Ch. 
IX.6) sprouted from Brahma's decapitation and, while the skulls went 
on multiplying, they brought into focus Siva's exclusion from, and his 
subsequent less than half-hearted admission to, the sacrifice. 
The above distortion of the Bhairava myth was due to a partial and 
narrow view. In another myth, the several versions of the reciprocal 
relation of Brahma's and Siva's fifth head ranged over half a circle of 
viewpoints (Ch. IX.I ). A full round, however, was made when in yet 
another myth the antelope, Rudra's victim in the primordial morning, 
was hymned as Siva himself: "Obeisance to the God in the form of a 
deer (or antelope), the lord of the deeF,"7 This eulogy of Pasupati / 
Siva further praised the god who had the form of an animal (paiu) , 
who destroyed the snares (piiSa) of maya that bind the paSu, and who 
played with the paiu. The eulogy of Siva, the antelope, ended with an 
obeisance to the Lord who assumed the form of an animal and 
roamed at will with the Pramathas in a sacred forest: "Obeisance to 
the God who is the seed of the world's salvation."8 The antelope, ani­
mal form of Prajapati, had become the animal (paiu) form of Siva and 
of the creature (paiu). 
The pasu, the sentient being, freed from its fetters (piiSa) no longer 
knows itself·as separate from Siva, while the paiu, ensnared by the 
world and its riches, may not be aware that Siva is in him. King 
Candrasekhara and his queen Taravati, unknown to themselves, were 
incarnations of Siva and Parvati. It was only under great stress that 
they became aware of their divine nature-for a moment only-then 
they returned to their day-to-day consciousness as mortals,9

Siva and Parvati live in every being. Siva is born anew in every child. 
When Sucimati, the wife of a sage, wanted a son like Mahesvara, and 
her husband, with this wish in mind, worshiped the Viresvara liitga in 
Varal)asi, a boy appeared above the liitga and Siva fulfilled the desire 
of the sage and his wife. Siva himself assumed the name of Grhapati, 
"lord of the house," and let himself be born as Sucimatls son. The 
legend, told in the Skanda Pura1Ja, was represented in many images in 
eastern India of about the tenth century A . D .  that showed the new­
born child lying close to its beautiful mother on an elegant bed. The 
right hand of the infant is raised in the gesture of granting freedom 
from fear.! 0 
Siva conceived by the wife of a brahmin sage assumed the name 
Grhapati, lord of the house. It was his proper name, for the gods, in 
the beginning, had conceived and formed him as Vastopati, the Lord 
of the Dwelling. Grhapati, the child, an incarnation of Siva, could 
have repeated the words from the hymn attributed to Sankara: "My 
Self is you . . .  my breaths your servants, my body your home."! ! The · 
body as the house of God is the microcosmic equivalent of the viistu. 
Vastopati, lord of the viistu, was given form in the raudra brahman, 
the archetypal wonder work of the gods, of which the arts in this 
world are to be understood as an imitation (cf. AB .6.27; Ch. 1.2). 
Siva is present in the world of man. Pasupati, the Lord of Animals, 
frees from his fetters the "animal," unregenerate man tied to his ego 
and its passions, and he frees this man, the "social animal," from the 
fetters of conventions. Rudra prepared the fire seed of creation for 
the Father, and it is he who implants it in man for the creation of 
works of art, in imitation of the archetypal wonder works of the gods. 
The unnamed God of the primordial scene was a wild hunter. The 
Satarudriya hymn rendered homage to Rudra, the archer (TS +5. 1), 
and to the makers of arrows, to the potters, smiths, and fishermen 
(TS .4.5.4), to those of low social standing and also to those of no social 
standing, the robber, thief, and cheat, and also to the dogs Cis +5.3, 
4).12 Siva appeared as a beggar, a homeless ascetic, or also a workman.

A South Indian legend tells of an old woman who was bid by a Pan­
dyan king to repair a dam. She was not up to the task. In her distress, 
she worshiped her Lord, Sundarda, the "Beautiful Lord," Siva. A 
workman appeared-on the spot carrying a basket and a spade. With 
one stroke he repaired the dam. He was Siva. The king built a splen­
did temple of Lord Sundaresa, who to this day is worshiped in the 
Great Temple at Madura, and is taken in procession in a golden bas­
ket with a golden spade.13 
From the primordial dawn to this day, Siva is present in the cosmos. 
From that morning time (Kala) came to be. What happened then left 
its image in the sky. Rudra overcame time as Mahakala, he became 
Bhairava in his breakthrough from Time into Timelessness. If Siva of 
a thousand and more names and forms is evoked as one of them, he 
necessarily is also its opposite, the cruel kind God. He encompasses 
the orbit of the mind, which thinks in .pairs of opposites. All of them 
are His in manifestation and even beyond, for he includes the ulti­
mate pair: creation and the Uncreate. He is their Consciousness. 
The Great Yogi carries within himself the consciousness of the Un­
create, the Absolute. In meditation he withdraws within himself, he 
returns to the Uncreate. Opening his "sun/and moon" eyes, he sees 
himself in every thing that exists. He is Atamurti, Existence itself. 
Siva Atamurti is Existence. Siva, the Great Yogi, is the consciousness 
of Existence and of the U ncreate. 
2 .  VIကခU AND SIVA 
While Brahma was inextricably part of the pattern of Rudra's myth, 
ViDu's role was supportive and subsidiary. Vil)u was assigned Siva's 
left half in the image of Siva called Harihara following the conception 
of the image of Ardhanarisvara. However, this unified image was sur­
passed when it was said that Siva was ViDU and ViDu was Siva 
(BNiirP .14.2 14). 
This is told mythically as well as explicitly in the story of Arjuna's 
Contest with a Kirata: a wild hunter (Ch. IX. I). The Kirata, the wild 
hunter who, unknown to Arjuna, was Siva, after a fierce contest of 
bhadra himself, of Siva's hair (Ch. X.A.2.a). Furthermore, Sarama, the dog mother of 
the sun, moon, and Sirius, offered herself also to be a mother of Karttikeya (S. Kram­
risch, 'The Indian Great Goddess," p. 262); cf. Ch. IX n. 27.

their powers, knocked the heroic Arjuna senseless (MBh.3.40.50-5 1). 
Pleased with Arjuna's prowess, Siva revealed himself to his devotee 
(MBh.3.40.52-54). Siva had put him to the test so that Arjuna could 
prove his worth and be given by Siva the Pasupata weapon. Arjuna 
then saw Siva in his glory, the Cause of all Causes, and he praised 
Mahadeva, "Honor to Siva in the form of ViI:lu and ViI:lu in the 
form of Siva, to the Destroyer of Daka's sacrifice, to Harirudra!" 
(MBh.3.40. insert no. 1 74, lines 1 -6, after verse 57). 
In the opposite spirit, the myth of Siva as Sarabha (cf. SP.3. 1O.4) 
tells of ViI:lu in his incarnation as man-lion (Narasirpha). Narasirpha 
disembowelled the demon HiraI:lya-kasipu, "Gold-Cloth," who had 
not only harassed the gods but who hated his own son, Prahlada, a 
devotee of ViI:lu. Although the demon was killed, the fury of Nara­
sirpha persisted (SP.3. 10. 1 5-25). He threatened to annihilate the uni­
verse (SP .3. 1 1 .27), and thought himself to be Kala, death, the cause 
of universal destruction (SP .3. 1 1 .35). Siva, who is Mahakala, the 
Death of death (SP.3. 1 1 .59), like a four-legged bird dug his claws into 
Narasirpha and lifted him up. The man-lion lost his power, and Siva / 
Virabhadra put an end to Narasirpha's life (SP.3.1 2.7-22). Vira­
bhadra peeled off the skin of the man-lion, and Siva since then has 
worn this hide (SP'3. 1 2'35-36). Myths of this kind and their images 
tell less about Siva than about the sympathies or antipathies of his fol­
lowers and their struggle for power. Iconography endowed Sarabha 
with eight legs-four of them like a lion's and resting on the ground, 
and four long, clawed legs turned upward-a body that is half man, 
half lion, and two wings, which represent Kali and Durga.14 Sarabha 
looked as if the Siva bird had taken to itself the shape of the man-lion, 
beautified significantly by the bird's wings, symbolizing Siva's saktis or 
female powers. In one (unpublished) painting, the figures of the god­
desses are inscribed in Siva / Sarabha's golden wings; serpents wriggle 
and writhe on and around the lion's body, tail, and golden wings; the 
beaked head of Sarabha is surmounted by a mighty serpent. In the 
unknown painter's vision, the shape of the man-lion had been ab­
sorbed in Sarabha's shape, and their synthesis was guarded all over by 
serpents. The myth of Sarabha stirred the memory of the ancient im­
age of the serpents surrounding a sacred center-and a tendentious 
fable acquired hallowed meaning. Sarabha occupies a very narrow

facet of the totality that is Rudra / Siva. Even so, the image of the bird­
man-lion was invested with the power of the god that brought to life, 
in the work of an urknown painter of the eighteenth century, the am­
bience of the god with its serpents and the Ganges flowing from the 
golden locks of the demoniac bird-man-lion's head. 
Siva frequently acts more like a demon than a god. He retained his 
Asura hood in creation, when other gods had left being Asuras and 
other Asuras had become demons. It was proper for Siva to meet 
Kavya Usanas on more than one occasion, for this Asura priest offi­
ciated for the gods as well as the demons, though not at the same time. 
The knowledge of resuscitation of the dead was Kavya Usanas's se­
cret; according to some, however, it was Siva who possessed its magic 
power. It was peripheral to his being. 
Siva should be thought of in a fourfold manner, and perceived as 
the cause of existence, existence itself, the cause of liberation, and re­
lease (LP . 1 .28.23). As the cause of existence, Siva had prepared the 
seed of existence for the Lord of Generation, and was born as exist­
ence from the Lord of Generation. As the cause of liberation and re­
lease, Siva was a yogi holding within himself the power of life, the 
power of creativity. As the Lord of Yoga hဂ causes the transformation 
of the vitally creative power into mental creativity and the interiorized 
objectivity of detachment that leads to Release. He, who showed him­
self as the Wild Hunter, excluded from their company by the other 
gods, a frenzied beggar who walked and danced his way into freedom 
from his sin, found Release. The "passion" of Siva / Bhairava, the 
erotic attachment of the ascetic god, intensified by his togetherness 
with his own seductive and exteriorized female power, and his burn­
ing of Kama were different ways toward the liberation of which he 
himself was the cause. In more than one form was Lord Mahadeva 
the way and cause of Release. The f:lg Veda (RV.2.33.3) invoked him: 
"0 Rudra, creation's most glorious in glory, mightiest of the mighty, 
. . .  lead us safely beyond distress."15 
To the ignorant he showed himself in their fear, and they saw the 
horror of the god; those who knew him saw the god in his grace-he' 
was Siva who gave them peace. In whichever way he was seen, his 
laughter spread from transcendency over his inscrutable face, or it re­
sounded loudly, liberatingly in the cosmic night from the linga

wreathed in flames. It showed and made audible his freedom. Or Siva 
dances. He does not play the role of a dancer. "Siva's dance is only the 
dance rendering of himself .
. . .  "16 His dance complements his tapas. 
Both are forms of the creative fire, the one turned inward in trance, 
the other turned outward in ecstasy. 
Once, at the beginning of the rainy season, as the Skimda Purii1J,a 
relates, all the gods came to Mount Mandara to see Siva dance for the 
pleasure of the goddess. Siva had observed brahmacarya and he was in 
a happy mood (SkP .6.254.8-1 4). All the musical instruments arrived 
in thousands. Siva was surrounded by his gal)as and demonic troops 
of piSiicas and bhittas. Then all the Ragas, the Melodies, came. Siva had 
created them by thinking of them. They came from the cakras, the 
centers of Siva's subtle body (SkP.6.254. 1 8-45)' The gods played on 
their instruments as Siva took on his form of Mahanata, the cosmic 
dancer. Five-headed, ten-armed, ash-smeared, emerald-crested, 
wearing garlands and armlets, his radiant body expanded through 
the three worlds; the mountain resounded with the beat of Siva's feet, 
the earth swayed rhythmically (SkP.6.254.46-56, 62). Parvati then 
praised Siva, and Siva let her occupy the left half of his body, which is 
known to belong to ViĠl)u (SkP .6.254.70-88). Siva had a skull in his 
hand, half of his neck was marked blue by the poison that he had 
swallowed at the Churning of the Ocean, half of his garland was 
strung with skulls, the matted hair carried the crescent moon, he was 
clad in animal skins. The other side was Gauri's. On one side was the 
bull, on the other a fish (SkP .6.254.89-92).17 Brahma and the other 
gods saw this marvelous configuration and praised Siva with the 
words, "He who is Siva is ViĠl)u, he who is ViĠl)u is Sadasiva" 
(SkP .6. 2 54. 1(0). The words of the gods stated the same truth that had 
come from Arjuna's mouth when Siva, passing as a wild hunter, re­
vealed himself. Brahma's equation, however, was not quite correct. 
He equated Lord ViĠl)u with Lord Sadasiva, Siva's highest aspect as 
manifest deity (d. VDh'3.48.6). 
In VaiĠDava elation, the Skiinda Puriirta's account of Siva's cosmic 
dance in the rainy season assigns precedence to ViĠDU over the god­
dess in being Siva's left half. The goddess, on the other hand, by the 
grace of Siva was allowed to occupy ViĠDU'S half of Siva's body. Such

reshufflings of mythical positions, though they are games played by 
sectarian interests, add a flavor of their own to the ongoing myth of 
Siva. They do not seem to have disturbed the melodies that had em­
anated from Siva's subtle body just before the Goddess took her own 
place in Ardhanarlsvara's shape. 
3. SIVA'S DANCE 
In the Kiirma Puriirw, Siva says of himself, "I am the originator, the 
god abiding in supreme bliss. I, the yogi, dance eternally" 
(KUP.2.4.33). "Having said this, the Lord of Yogis, the Supreme God, 
danced, showing his formidable, supreme reality" (KiiP.2.5.1). In the 
spotless sky the yogis saw him dancing, the Great God who is Lord of 
all beings, whose maya is all that IS here, and who activates the universe 
(KUP.2.5.2-4). They saw in the sky Rudra, the Great Liberator, who 
loves his devotees and liberates them from ignorance (KUP.2.5.7). 
They saw the Great God full of energy dancing with ViĠl).u in the clear 
sky (KUP.2.5.2). In his dance Rudra and ViĠl).u became one, ViĠl).u be­
coming the left half of Lord Rudra (KUP. 2.5.1 8, 20). The celestial dance 
of Siva the yogi was seen only by yogis and sages (KiiP.2.5.3-4), 
whereas the whole cosmos was the scene of Siva's dance. At the end of 
time, he dances the awesome Tal).<;iava. The stamping of his foot, the 
gyrations of his body, his flailing arms toss the mountains into the air; 
the ocean rises, the stars are lashed and scattered by Siva's matted 
hair. In order to save the world, Siva in his perverse power dances the 
world out of existence (MSt. 16; HV. 1 .46),18 wildly laughing (cf. 
MD·58), scattering ashes from his body (KS.5.79) so that the world 
may be renewed. This is the Tal}<;iava dance of Siva, as Kala-Maha-
,kala, the Destroyer, Destroyer of destruction. But, from his flowing 
hair the rivers will flow again into existence (cf. LP . 1 .43.32-39; 
SP·57·72-82), and the rays of sun and moon will be seen again for 
what they are, the hair of Siva (MBh.7. 1 73, note 92, insert no. 1470, 
lines 1-2). 
The dance in the sky before the eyes of the yogis and sages, the 
cosmic dance, and the dance of destruction-creation have the uni­
verse for their stage. Another dance, the Ananda Tal).<;iava, Siva's 
"dance of bliss in the hall of consciousness,"19 is Siva's dance within

the heart of man. There Nataraja, the lord of dancers, dancing, shows 
his fivefold activity, the expression of his divine totality. His dancing 
limbs convey by their movements and symbols the fivefold action of 
creation, maintenance, dissolution, veiling-unveiling, and liberation. 
Natanija dances the cosmos into existence, upholds its existence, and 
dances it out of existence. The Lord veils existence with illusion so 
that it is seen as real, and, dancing, he removes the veil. The raised 
leg of the dancer shows the liberating freedom of his dance, the drum 
raised by the right hand sounds the note of creation, the flame in the 
left hand flickers in the change brought about by destruction, the 
right hand grants freedom from fear, the fear of repeated births and 
deaths, and assures the maintenance of life. The dancer's foot is firmly 
planted on the infant shape of the demon Amnesia, the Apasmara 
Puru!ia, and accentuates the vertical, cosmic axis of the god's body.20 
The movement of the dancer around this axis, self-enclosed in bal­
anced gyration, is encircled by flames. 
The South Indian broဃze image of Nataraja in its explicit, yet con­
tained, form equals in its perfection the static shape of the linga with 
its encapsulated power. Sivaramamurti cites a panegyric of late date 
from Chidambaram, the sacred center of Nataraja's worship. The 
hymn, called Tatvaryastava,21 celebrates the "foremost of the hunt­
ers," who "dances in the company of his beloved in the . . .  forest of 
Tillai trees, . . .  causing the waves of sentience to tremor and scintil­
late . . . .  As he dances, he appears in the immaculate lotus ofthe heart . 
. . . "22 In the verbal sophistication of the panegyric the memory of the 
Hunter is fresh. The dance of this Hunter, "in the immaculate lotus 
of the heart" is by the same dancer who as yogi danced for yogis and 
sages only. 
Siva dances for the Goddess special Tal)<;lava dances for her three 
forms as Uma, Gauri, and Kalika. His dance as a beggar for Parvati's 
hand delighted Mena. He danced the Tal)<;lava before Tripura, and 
after he killed the elephant demon, in the red glow of the setting sun,

blood dripping from the elephant's hide (cf. MD'36). He danced his 
mad, erotic dance (LP. 1.3 1.30), rising to supreme glory-and accom­
panied by ViĠI,lu-in the Deodar forest (KitP.2.37.20); he danced in 
the evening, after the destruction of DakĠa's sacrifice (NS .4.234); as 
Bhairava, he danced on leaving ViĠI,lu's house, and again when the 
skull fell from his hand in VaraI,lasi; he dances on the cremation 
ground where the funerary pyres abound and keep warm the earth 
scattered with corpses. He danced in the battle with Andhaka 
(VmP '43.69-76), Lord Kalagni Rudra danced holding Andhaka aloft, 
impaled on the trident (KitP. l . lS.184; SP.2g.2S-27). Andhaka him­
self danced when he was born, and after he had become Bhplgi; 
GaI,leSa, Karttikeya, and the Goddess dance, and the Mothers whose 
chorus Siva leads, playing on the virta. Siva's gaI,las dance; there is no 
end to Siva's dance, it disperses his tejas, his fiery energy and glory in 
his world. 
On one occasion Siva did not dance. At that time the whole universe 
had begun to dance, nothing could resiငt the dance of RĠi MankaI,laka 
in his elation. He danced with the joy of discovery when his hand was 
cut by a blade of kuSa grass and plant sap flowed from his wound in­
stead of blood. This miracle filled the rĠi with excessive joy and pride 
unbecoming to an ascetic. Siva, at the request of the gods, put a stop 
to the commotion. He stood in front of the rĠi, struck his own thumb 
with his finger, and ashes fell from the wound. Ashamed, the sage 
danced no moreP In another version of the myth, Siva, having 
shamed the ni by the calm flow of ashes, danced, assuming cosmic 
dimension, and revealed himself to the ni as Time and Death and the 
impeller of all (Ch. IX.4). 
In between his dances Siva stayed in different residences. He had 
come from the north and preferred to live in secluded caves in the 
Himalayan mountains. There the yogi and the wild, uncanny god felt 
at home. Indeed, they both were Rudra and the north was Rudra's 
quarter.24 In that direction he was worshiped. All the other gods were 
worshiped in the eastern direction, where the sun rises. In fact, he was 
homeless. Sati, his bride, found it difficult to adjust to her husband's, 
the yogi's, way of life. Parvati, the daughter of the Mountain, was 
more confirmed in her asceticism. It filled her with holy fire whether

Siva chose to stay in palace or mountain solitude. Frequently Siva 
stayed in charnel grounds, and his mansion, in iikasa above the burn­
ing ground in Varal).asi, was a place he never forsook. Only yogis and 
sages could see the mansion where Siva stayed. Siva built for himself 
another mansion high above the Pole Star. It "remains suspended in 
the sky solely through the strength of his asceticism" (BVP . 1.25.1-2).25 
When Siva steps out of his mansion in the cosmic north, the empy­
rean, he expounds, under the shady branches of his fig tree 
(SP. 2.2.40.35-37), music, yoga, gnosis, and all the arts and sciences to 
the sages.

THE GREAT CAVE TEM PLE OF S I VA 
ON T H E  ISLAND OF E LEPHANTA 
Entry into the presence of Siva was given form in his Great Cave 
Temple on the island of Elephanta.* Hewn out of the rock in the mid­
dle of the sixth century A.D.,t wide pillared entrances in the east, west, 
and north lead into the interior (c. 130 ft. by 1 30 ft.). But for these 
light-filled entrances, the temple has no exterior. It is a cave made 
into a hall (mar-{iapa) by arrays of pillars and vertical limits that sup­
port a flat ceiling and the weight of the hill above it. The vertical limits 
of the temple are in the south and at the four corners of the mar-rj,apa 
(see floor plan). The southern vertical limit, the largest "wall" expo­
sure of the cave temple, is recessed from the mar-r)apa by an ardhamar-­
{iapa, a pillared vestibule that opens into the mar-rj,apa. In the north, 
and opposite the ardhamar-rj,apa, a pillared portico (mukhamar-rj,apa) 
leads into the hall of the Great Cave Temple. The vertical limits are 
carved from the mass of the rock. Hollowed out, they are chapels, 
caves within the solid matrix of the rock, opening into the large inte­
rior of the total cave temple. "Architectural" mouldings and pilasters 
are their carved frames. 
Within the pillared main hall, toward the western entrance, the

stark planes of a cubical cella form the walls of the innermost sanctu­
ary (garbhagrha, or "womb-house") of the cave temple (PI. 1). They 
open on each of the four sides of this cubical garbhagrha. Steps lead 
up to the open doorways. They frame the mulavigraha, the nuclear 
form, the linga, rising in the center of the square innermost sanctuary 
(PI. 2).2 Figures of celestial guardians (dviirapiila), eight in all, extend­
ing nearly from floor to ceiling, flank the doors. Carved almost in the 
round, their calm, impassive figures project into the pillared temple 
hall. The pillars, plain four-sided prisms in the lower half, rise above 
with gently swelling ribbed shafts whose broad, circular capitals seem 
to cushion the pressure of the rock which they support. The pillars 
are aligned in columniations from east to west, leading to the garbha­
grha, around which they form an ambulatory. At the same time, the 
lines of pillars create another axis from north to south, to the recessed 
southern limit with its three chapelsfthat of Sadasiva in the center, 
flanked by the chapels of Siva Ardhanarisvara and Siva Gangadhara 
(PIs. 3-5)' The cave temple is double-focused: on the mulavigraha, the 
linga in the stern cubical innermost sanctuary in the west (PI. 2); and 
on the sculpture of Sadasiva, the iconic form of a pancamukha linga, 
ensconced deep in the rock in a cubical recess in the middle of the 
southern limit of the cave temple (PI. 4). The other vertical limits of 
the temple hall are at its corners and in the portico in the north; in 
both, they are chapels within rectangular frames, hollowed out from 
the mass of the rock. The "architectural" framework functions like 
the front of a showcase. It sets off the individual sanctuaries embed­
ded in the matrix of the rock. 
As the linga is enclosed within its shrine, the garbhagrha, the latter, 
together with the linga, is surrounded by the chapels of the entire 
temple hall. They communicate Siva's presence, embodied as it is in 
the totality of this temple cave in which the unmanifest Siva is en­
shrined in the innermost sanctuary. 
The unmanifest Siva, in utter transcendency, dwells in the linga.

mukha linga.4 The four faces of Siva are those of TatpuruĠa / Maha­
deva, Aghora / Bhairava, Vamadeva / Uma and Sadyojata / Nandin.5 
Ekamukha and pancamukha lingas had been carved and worshiped for 
centuries before the sculptures of Siva as linga and image were carved 
in Elephanta. The Sadasiva image in Elephanta integrates three of the 
visible faces of Siva (PI. 4). The three heads, each heightened by its 
crown, coalesce, their tripartite bulk letting the central face with its 
crown exceed the others. It rises like the high, domed cylinder of the 
linga symbol. Although it has only three faces, the Sadasiva image in 
Elephanta is a kind of pancamukha linga, emerging from the dark 
depth of the rock. The fourth face, at the back of the frontal face of 
TatpuruĠa / Mahadeva, cannot be seen, as the colossal sculpture, 
within the darkness of its chamber, is cut out of the rock at the south­
ern limit of the temple cave. It confronts the devotee with three of its 
heads rising from one broad bust and base. The fifth face-in tran­
scendency-is beyond the sight of mortals and has not been carved.6 
The four heads when carved on a free-standing pancamukha linga, 
according to the texts (Ch. VII.S), are associated each with one of the 
four directions. TatpuruĠa / Mahadeva, according to the texts, should 
face east. The plan of the temple cave of Elephanta, however, assigns 
to Sadasiva the central and dominant position on the south wall, and 
TatpuruĠa / Mahadeva, in Elephanta, faces north.7 1conology had to 
yield to technical necessity. Position and orientation of the temple 
were dictated by the shape of the rock from which its large hall was 
excavated. In planning the sculptural display, the total meaning-of 
which the temple cave was to be the shape-and the natural condi­
tions of the site were the determining factors. 
The central, deep recess of the south wall of the cave temple en­
shrines Sadasiva within stark and straight planes. They encase the co-

1946, pp. 4.8. Mahiideva refers only to the head in the middle of the three heads shown 
in Elephanta of the five-faced Sadiisiva. The middle head with its high crown suggests 
a linga shape. Later iconography shows the five heads with one anthropomorphic body 
(B. N. Sharma, Iconography of SadiiSiva, pp. 1 -3 1 ,  frontispiece; and pis. 8, 10, etc.).

lossal paramount image (h. 2 0  ft. 7 in.) of the cave temple. Its faces 
emerge in the farthest depth of the temple cave, the darkness of the 
recess lit by the uncertain chiaroscuro of the cave, or the warm glow 
of oil lamps. 
TatpuruĠa's face contains the fullness of absolute knowledge that is 
peace. The now-damaged eyelids are lowered to let its bliss touch 
weighty, closed lips, relaxed in meditation. They guard the inscruta­
ble state in which Mahadeva, the Great God, dwells (PIs. 6, 7). The 
face has no other definition than the sharp intersections of its bound­
ing planes. They meet in wide curves, in the front view, a vessel of 
quiddity (PIs. 4, 6), and in sha!p angles of the profile (PI. 9). These are 
cut as if by one stroke of a trenchant tool sensitized by its contact with 
the rock, transforming it into the likeness of God. 
Sacred composure smoothes Mahadeva's broad forehead. It is 
crowned by a symphony of jewelry, rising in cascades of filigree or­
naments around the radiating strands of hair piled high, symbols of 
generative power contained in the jatiimukuta of the lord of ascetics 
(PI. 4). His left hand holds in front of the chest a "citron" (miitulinga), 
a fruit rich in seeds. A wide and intricately chiselled torque and a bead 
string rest on the chest, surround the triple curve of the broad neck, 
and accentuate the linga pillar shape of Mahadeva's crowned head. 
The necklace also fastens to this central theme of the image the lateral 
heads, set off in profile from TatpuruĠa / Mahadeva in their midst. 
On the right of Mahadeva's face (PI. 6), wriggling serpent locks and 
raised serpent hoods interspersed with manifold flowers and tender 
leaves lead to a staring skull, the crown jewel of the coiffure, piled 
high above Aghora / Bhairava's face. On the left of Mahadeva's 
crown, by contrast, rows of small cork-screw curls, surmounted by 
swags and swirling curves frame and crown Vamadeva / Vma's coun­
tenance. The rich textures of the coiffures and crowns of the lateral 
profile heads conceived in the round and facing east and west form a 
foil for Mahadeva's head. Motifs and rhythms of the coiffures convey, 
as much as their faces, the nature of each of these aspects of Siva. 
In Bhairava's face, the vaulting planes that compose Mahadeva's 
face are contracted in bulges charged with energy. His irascible pro­
file is turned toward a serpentS that rears from out of Bhaira va's hand 
and faces, a threatening symbol of death, the baneful eye of the dread 
god. His moustache, as if twisted by rage, cuts across the full, carnal

cheek. Above the furled brow of the fearful god the sunken-eyed 
skull stares into nothingness. 
On the left of Mahadeva, Uma's contemplation makes unfold a lo­
tus flower held in her hand (PIs. 10, 4, 6). Absorbed within her own 
being, the Goddess communicates with the flower raised shoulder 
high. Vamadeva, the Mantra and beauteous deity on Mahadeva's left, 
is indeed the Great Goddess, Uma (Ch. VII.5). Even though her fea­
tures resemble those of Mahadeva, they do not convey Siva's quiddity 
as TatpuruĠa. They communicate his grace by her charm. Right and 
left of Mahadeva's "face of eternity," the contorted virile visage of 
Bhairava and the dreaming femininity of Uma represent the mystery 
of the coexistence of the absolute together with the fundamental pair 
of opposites of male and female as they exist in God.9 This meaning 
underlies the three-faced image in Elephanta. It was described in the 
VińTJudharmottara PuriirJa (VDhP. 3.48. 1 -7). 
Doubly recessed by "pilasters" and pedestal, the mystery of Sada­
siva's image occupies the central chapel in the southern limit of the 
maTJrjapa. No room is left in that deep bay for anything besides the 
darkness around the image. In front of each "pilaster" or "offset," the 
figure of a guardian of the threshold is accompanied by a gal)a. These 
dviirapiila figures, relaxed in their stance and more animated than 
those that guard the hnga shrine, are attuned to the presence of Sada­
siva; they are images of empathy, and their faces, though with expres­
sions reduced to human terms of feeling, still resemble Mahadeva's 
face. Their lips gently touch, and serpents are their ornaments. 
The mouldings of the wide base of Sadasiva's image are continued 
along the square platform, the base of each dviirapiila, linking archi­
tecturally these foreposts to the main image that they flank-separate 
from, and yet connected with, the bays or recesses beyond the pilas­
ters. 
These chapels, on either side of Sadasiva's sanctuary, celebrate Siva 
Ardhanarlsvara, the androgyne god (PIs. 3, 1 1, 1 2 )  and Siva Ganga­
dhara (PIs. 5, 1 3), the support of Ganga, the river. Each of these im­
ages is the main figure in a grotto that fills its bay in a manner peculiar 
to Elephanta. 
In the grotto in which Ardhanarlsvara is made manifest leaning on 
his bull, their gigantic ensemble dominates the scene (PI. 3). The

crowned androgyne god towers over the many figures of the compo­
sition. Set forth from the back of the chapel, he appears in their midst 
in a space as if between heavy, billowing curtains drawn apart so as to 
reveal the asymmetry of his androgyne shape (PIs. 3, 1 1 , 12). Ardha­
narisvara in a leisurely way leans on Nandin's accommodating shape. 
The dome of Ardhanarisvara's breast, the amplitude of the left fe­
male hip, appear even larger than they are by the tribhanga or triply 
bent stance of the figure. The tilt of Ardhanarlsvara's head with its 
high crown is unaffected by the wide-flung, curving bulk of the hip; 
the lowered foremost arm of the goddess passes along it. With this 
long, extended arm, ArdhanarJsvara communicates his being to the 
assembled gods whose figures seem to crowd into, fill, and make up 
the grotto (PIs. 1 1 , 1 2). 
The emphasis on the left half of Ardhanarisvara's body by the slant 
of the pendant arm, is compensated on the right by the main arm of 
the god bending to rest on Nandin's shape; god and animal form one 
visual unit. Its apex touches Ardhanarisvara's brow. The biunity of 
Ardhanarisvara's body admits, in this sculptural composition, the fig­
ure of Nandin as a supplement to Siva's shape. Nandin belongs to 
Siva; in more than one sense does the bull convey Siva. In the grotto, 
the epiphany of Siva is comprised of the Goddess and the bull, as well. 
Ardhanarisvara's four arms radiating from the shoulders hold at 
bay the onrush of jubilant gods who come to hail the epiphany. 
Ardhanarisvara remains aloof; the hands of his raised upper arms are 
turned inward. The goddess holds a mirror in which is reflected the 
god's being, while his lowered lids and slightly parted lips seem to 
presage a knowledge of every pain (PI. 1 1 ). The paradoxical reality of 
compassionate detachment expressed in the face of the god is a physi­
ognomical equivalent to the symbol of the mirror; it catches the reflex 
of the god's face. The face does not look into the mirror. The mirror 
is a symbol and restatement of Siva's being. Centuries later, a hymn 
by Abhinavagupta10 praises Siva himself as the mirror of undifferen­
tiated consciousness. In Siva, light of consciousness, everything is re­
flected. The objects seen in the mirror are neither separate from each 
other nor from the mirror. They constitute a whole that cannot be 
dissociated. The undifferentiated consciousness of the Lord and the 
multiple reflections coexist.

An oblong nimbus separates the god's epiphany from the depth of 
the grotto which is full of figures of celestials who seem to be arriving 
from right and left. Right and left do not extend in one plane with 
the ground in front of which Ardhanarisvara is stationed. Rather, 
they form the sides of the bay and are perpendicular to the ground of 
his image. The sides extend forward. The multitude of figures, stand­
ing, seated, flying, emerges from these lateral grounds toward the 
epiphany of Ardhanarisvara's image standing in their midst in full 
front view. The emerging figures are arranged in tiers (PI. 3). 
The entire scene is not a high relief in the accepted sense, that is, 
carved with reference to its ground. It is conceived with reference to 
three grounds, whence the figures have come, and which enclose the 
interior of the grotto in which Ardhanarisvara manifests. From the 
lateral grounds-somewhere in the depth of the rock-the multitudes 
of celestials make their appearance. All of them are turned toward the 
main group of Ardhanarisvara with Nandin. It is stationed in an in­
terior brought about by the figures as they emerge in high relief from 
their respective grounds toward the central group. The unified form 
resulting from a relief conceived as emerging from three "grounds" 
or ideational limits, perpendicular to each other somewhere deep in 
the rock, may be called the grotto form of relief. From out of these 
lateral grounds the figures emerge in different degrees of vehemence 
and visibility. Those at the bottom of the grotto appear to have sta­
tioned themselves on the floor of the grotto: Karttikeya, Siva's son, on 
the right proper of the god; two female figures, possibly Jaya and Vi­
jaya, "ladies in waiting" of the Goddess, to her left. These divinities 
occupy the lowermost part of the composition and are the largest 
among the divine host. They reach to the height of the hip of the fig­
ure of the goddess and to Nandin's hump. Above them, the god 
Brahma on his lotus, carried by flying haT(tsas, and lndra on his ele­
phant are conspicuous figures, emerging from the matrix of the rock 
on the proper right of Ardhanarisvara; but even more dynamic is the 
figure of ViĠl)u, to the left of the Goddess. He rides on impetuous, 
large-winged Garu<;la (PI. 1 1), bursting out of the rock amid hosts of 
celestials, flying up toward Ardhanarisvara. The flight of the ap­
proaching gods on their vehicles occupies the second horizontal reg­
ister of the grotto composition. The figures in this register seem to be 
coming forth or to have emerged from within the rock on both sides 
of the grotto, and to advance and turn toward Ardhanarisvara; and 

E LE P H ANTA • 4 5 1 
above them, in the third tier, celestials, no longer supported by their 
animal vehicles, fly by the power of their own elation. I I Exultantly, 
the long-limbed bodies of these celestials soar in mighty gusts from 
rip;ht and left, respectively, toward Ardhanarisvara. They form a can­
opy around the god's head. While most of their approaching figures 
fly on clouds and are carved in the main plane of the relief, others 
among their host emerge perpendicular to it, from their cloud bank, 
on either side of the god's high nimbus. 
The "grotto relief" conceived with reference to these intersecting 
grounds, discharging, as it were, their figures into a unified space cre­
ated and bounded by them, climaxes a trend established in Indian art, 
that is, the coming forth of the figures from out of their ground into 
the space of the relief. This could be seen in Sanchi, of the first cen­
tury B.C., in a relief on the south gate, and later in the Mahayana cave 
paintings in Ajanta (second half of the fifth century A.D.).12 There the 
figures, modeled by means of painting, seem to advance from the 
depth of the painting toward the spectator. 
The illusion created by painting the figures emerging from the 
depth of the painting toward the spectator, as also the emergence of 
relief figures from their ground-the rock-have their analogy in the 
Samkhya concept of vyaktavyakta, the "manifest-unmanifest," a state of 
transition from the one to the other, implying the latter in the former. 
The particular use of this mode of visualization was put into the serv­
ice of Saiva themes in Elephanta, where the emergence of the figures 
is not from one ground only, but simultaneously from three grounds. 
The liiiis of the Great God inspired this special employment of the 
"dimension of forthcoming." Hosts of figures, all comparatively small 
in scale, surround the figure of Siva in his grottos in Elephanta, just 
as hosts of Rudras and gaIJas swarmed around Siva, from the Sata­
rudriya hymn to the Pura'(!as. 
Whereas figureless, straight planes encase Sadasiva's image, each of 
the filiis or playful manifestations of Siva is bodied forth in a grotto of 
its own that has no sharp edges. The carved figures in their density 
make up its confines. The large central group of Ardhanarisvara is set 
forth from the ground in front of which its majesty is displayed; the 
1 1  Pairs of Hying celestials were carved on bracket capitals in the latest caves of 
Ajanta; cf. W. M. Spink, Ajanta to Ellora, 1967, fig. 18, a bracket capital, Cave II.

lateral figures emerge from their respective ground.13 The rock seems 
to discharge its contents in the sculptural shapes of the gods that form 
Ardhanansvara's grotto. Their impact seems to come from within the 
rock and their emergence to acquire figured shape. Propelled from 
their ground by the sculptor's creative dynamism, their postures are 
oriented toward Ardhanarisvara. Having come to see and celebrate 
his manifestation, their ranks are ordered in three horizontal tiers: 
the lowest, with large standing figures; the middle, with the gods 
seated on their vehicles or thrones; and the uppermost register, in 
which long-limbed wingless celestials, flying in droves, approach 
Ardhanansvara's crowned majesty (PI. 3). 
The linga enshrined in the garbhagrha and framed by the austere 
geometry of the door openings, and the image of Sadasiva, similarly 
encased by straight walls, offer a dramatic contrast to the manifesta­
tions of Siva in grotto-like chapels (PI. 2). 
The grotto of Ardhanarisvara to the left of Sadasiva's recess has its 
counterpart in the relief of Siva Gangadhara on the right of the co­
lossal Sadasiva scu,lpture (PI. 5). In this grotto relief, which has the de­
scent from heaven of the river (goddess) Ganga for its subject, the 
gods take part in a cosmic event, the descent of Ganga, the celestial 
river, from heaven to earth and into the netherworld. Ganga, sister of 
Parvati and her rival, is seen from her triple bust upward, a diminu­
tive shape above Siva's crown. She comes down with flying garments 
(PI. 5) and tops as if she were an additional coronet Siva's jatamukuta. 
Greeted by the long-limbed flying gods, she accentuates and forms 
the peak of the aureole or prabhama1J,rjala-like extent of Siva's ambi­
ence. Parvati, to his left, is assigned her place in a rectangular exten­
sion of Siva's arched setting. Between the two large figures of god and 
goddess a small squat gal)a intervenes. His face is turned up beseech­
ingly, expectantly, toward Siva. To the right proper of Siva kneels the 
heroic and devout figure of King Bhagiratha; his three-quarter back 
view expresses both these qualities of Sagara's scion, whose austerities 
brought Ganga down from heaven with such force, it is said, that her

impact would have rent the earth. To save the earth Siva caught 
Ganga in his matted hair (PIs. 5, 13)' 
In the sculpture in Elephanta, however, Siva in his grace appears to 
have stilled her impetuousness, offering his matted hair, piled high 
on his head, for her to rest on, while allowing himself to be rapt in a 
shower of blissfulness, his, body swaying like Kutila / Ganga herself, 
the curvaceous one. While Siva lowers his head, turned away from 
Parvati, he holds out his upper left arm toward her, thereby bridging 
the distance that separates them. Her body sways in the opposite di­
rection from that of Siva. The dehanchement of her left hip, akin to 
that of Ardhanarisvara, is becoming to Parvati's womanly shape. And 
she seems to be flooded away from Siva, reciprocating his swaying 
away from her, rapt as he is in the cosmic delight of Ganga's descent. 
However, Siva and Parvati are not only connected by Siva's arm 
reaching out to her, and by their divine coquetry, but also by the 
rhythm of the formal tie in which the sculptor holds them in his com­
position. Their swaying away is enhanced by the projected hip of 
each. By their postures that space"them away from each other-by 
these very postures, they are tied together in two sweeping curves of 
the composition that exceed their figures. The two curves intersect 
above the two figures and come close at the bottom.14 The creative 
translation, in terms of visual art, of the play and tensions that sepa­
rate and unite Siva and Parvati is accompanied by the expression of 
Parvati's face. Waiting, enchantment, knowingness of the situation, 
and consciousness of her own seductiveness are conveyed by the fig­
ure of Parvati, resting within herself, tending away from, and drawn 
back toward Siva (PIs. 13-15).'5

"walls" and situated to either side of the three entrances, arrest and 
attune to Siva's lilas the devotee's circumambulation around the linga 
shrine.16 Turning to the right in order to circumambulate the linga 
shrine, the chapel or grotto celebrating Siva's marriage to Parvati 
(KalyaI).a-Sundaramiirti) is on the devotee's left, flanking the west side 
of the liitga shrine and the west entrance of the ambulatory (PIs. 16-18). 
The wedding of the Great God and the Great Goddess, as seen by 
the sculptor of Elephanta, does not take place in the palace of King 
Parvata, as the Purii'(l,as tell us. In the Elephanta relief, King Parvata 
ushers the bride toward Siva, and Brahma officiates as priest in the 
grotto formed by the gods present at the wedding (PIs. 16- 1 8).17 Siva, 
the bridegroom, is lithe, young, and calm. His divinity ascends from 
his face to the high pile of the ascetic god's hair in front of the high 
oval of his halo that rises from the noble shoulders of a body of su­
perhuman tenderness. It is a transubstantiated body, the subtle body, 
that yoga has formed and that the artist has made visible. It is in this, 
their subtle body, that the gods are made visible in Elephanta. It re­
sembles the human shape, but is free from the contingencies of its 
mortal frame. It is the shape of an inward awareness of the body 
gained through yoga experience.lစ 
The main right arm of the god is bent in the direction of Parvati. 
She is small and suffused by emotion. It wells up in the curves of her 
shy body. What difference between its yielding stillness and the 
sweeping elegance of Parvati, Siva's wife (PIs. 1 3, 1 6)! Her face is in­
clined, as is Siva's face, in sweet surrender, which her lips savor and 
her lowered eyelids acknowledge. A cadence of inwardness links God 
and Goddess as they clasp hands (now missing). 
Though the figures of Siva's wedding and SivakalyaI).a Sundara are 
badly damaged, the composition in the grotto can be seen to conform 
with the principles followed in the lateral chapels of the Sadasiva trip­
tych, even though the second tier of the grotto is not occupied by ce­
lestials on their viihanas or vehicles, but by the upper half of the main 
figures at the wedding. Bringing a large water vessel, Candra the

Moon enters the grotto from its side on the right proper of Parvati, 
allowing Parvataraja to usher in the bride, his daughter, toward 
Siva.'9 King Parvata's bulky figure, in three-quarter front view, lays 
his hand like a blessing on his daughter's arm as he gives her away to 
Siva. The group of Candra the Moon-not seen in the plates-King 
Parvata the Mountain, and the daughter of the Mountain proceeds as 
if it had come from out of the side of the grotto toward the middle 
and front, where Siva and Parvati are beingjoined in marriage.20 
The main action in the grotto is on Siva's right proper. The left 
side, more static in its structure, comprises the squatting figure of 
Brahma-the priest at the marriage-tending the fire, the tall figure 
of ViĠl)u, and others. The flying hosts on their cloud banks of the top­
most register graze Siva's halo and the heads of the protagonists. 
These are placed in dynamic asymmetry in which the figure of Siva 
does not occupy the middle of the relief, but allows the smaller figure 
of Parvati a large share of the grotto for her retinue to make their 
entry into the grotto under a cloud bank of flying celestials. The latter 
meets at the very top of the relief, in a point above Siva's head, the 
flight of the gods that halts on the other side of Siva's aureole. In this 
high point two compositional arcs have also come to meet: one, rising 
from Siva's left foot, ascends over the head of Brahma; the other 
curves upward from Parvati's right foot and touches her right shoul­
der. The pointed arch formed by the two curves encloses the union 
of Siva and Parvati, just as the "mandorIa" of intersecting composi­
tional curves held together the seeming estrangement of God and 
Goddess in the Gangadhara chapel. 
Proceeding further in the ambulatory along the west side of the 
linga shrine, the chapel of Siva's wedding is seen to be opposite the 
recess that encloses the scene of Siva killing the demon Andhaka (An­
dhakasuravadha) (PIs. 19, 20). The ambulatory west of the Hnga 
shrine functions at the same time as portico of the west entrance into 
the temple. Siva in his serenity, the celestial bridegroom, and Siva in 
his furor, the demon slayer-the love of god and the terror of god­
are both present to the devotee who enters the temple from the west. 
19 Plates 16 and 1 7 show part of the large water vessel held by Candra, whereas the 
figures of Brahma and Vi˗l)u are not shown. 
20 A group of figures, part of a larger composition carved in the Buddhist cave of 
Lonad, is closely related in treatment to the wedding scene of Elephanta; cf. R. v. Ley­

The chapels reveal the two natures of Siva as the MaitrayaŅi Sa1{thita 
had evoked them (Ch. 1.2): Siva the gracious and auspicious, and Siva 
the formidable and cruel. He is shown in both his natures to the right 
and the left of the linga shrine. The faces of Aghora / Bhairava and 
Vamadeva / Uma are, similarly, to the right and left of Tatpurua / 
Mahadeva's face (PIs. 4, 6). 
Ardhanarisvara, Gangadhara, and Sundaramurti are epiphanies of 
Siva, the gracious god whose totality comprises his male and female 
natures. Withdrawal into his being, compassion, delight, and peace 
are cast over the divine countenance according to the specific lila and 
its resolution of the male-female concomitance that each of these 
manifestations has for its theme-Ardhanarisvara: biunity of the 
male and the female in God, undivided in his towering shape; Ganga­
dhara: god and goddess, separate figures, moving away from and 
drawn toward each other; Sundaramurti: the joining in marriage of 
Siva and ParvatI. These themes were given form by one master who 
envisioned the grotto as their setting. He realized his vision in the 
Ardhanarisvara chapel, and it stayed with him in the other two chap­
els (PIs. 3, 1 1 ;  5, 1 3; 1 6, 1 7)· 
Though Parvati's role in the myth of Andhaka is fundamental, she 
does not seem to have been a major figure in its sculptural presenta­
tion in Elephanta. Her figure and also those in the lowermost panel 
and on the right are practically destroyed. Now, Siva alone, dancing 
in his furor of destruction, carries the scene. In the chapel of the fran­
tic god, the grotto is practically blotted out by a large, plain, concave 
rectangular shape-the hide of the elephant demon Nila whom Siva 
had overcome by dancing him to his death, before Siva transfixed 
Andhaka by his lance or trident (Pis. 19, 20).21 By his two hindmost 
arms, whose mutilated stems branch off from the god's shoulders, he 
has raised the Aayed elephant's skin like a wind-inAated cloak. Siva's 
hands have gripped the edge of the skin, and it takes the shape of an 
elegant horizontal rim that marks the upper boundary of the raging 
god's concave backdrop. Only to Siva / Bhairava's left proper, where 
the hollow elephant hide ends behind Andhaka's impaled body, can 
the lateral parts of the grotto be seen-though not in Plates 19 and 
2o-with its multitude of staggered figures. The long-limbed Aying

gods and other celestials of the . top register ate relegated above the 
straight edge of Siva's bleak "cave"; they form an outer border of hov­
ering, gliding rhythms flanking a group of gaI)as and other celestials, 
fĠis, who worship a rock sanctuary. To the right proper of Siva, the 
rectangular, concave recess formed by the elephant hide appears cut 
short by the mighty sword held upright and ready to strike, in the sec­
ond right hand of the eight-armed god. 
From his shoulders, a cloudburst of arms shoots off, propelling his 
body toward Andhaka's diminutive, impaled figure. The long shaft of 
the trident from whose tip Andhaka's body dangles crossed the rag­
ing god's chest. It must have been held in the same way as in a relief 
of the same scene from the Dasavatara cave (Cave 1 5) of Ellora. The 
body of Siva lunges forward while vaulting upward, carved in the 
round against the curved plane of the elephant hide, its background. 
Abounding in exuberant power, the figure is modeled naturalisti­
cally; its dynamism is one of bodily innervation as much as of artistic 
form. Breath-inflated che'st and abdomen, delicately modeled breast, 
the smooth, full cheeks rounded over high cheekbones, and a gaping, 
panting mouth exposing fangs, tongue lolling and eyes bulging under 
contracted brows-these are self-contained but coherent shapes, their 
effect heightened by their juxtaposition with the god'sjatiimukuta, de­
tailed in each of its dainty single motifs: the volumetric skull orna­
ment, the piled-up coiffure, a sum of single small patterns, the neat 
precision of their array intensifying by contrast the leering horror of 
the god's countenance. Aghora / Bhairava's face (Pis. 4, 6), by com­
parison, exudes a sense of well-being in the strong flesh of its monu­
mental stasis. 
The immediacy of the god's breathing, immaculately groomed, 
body is communicated to the thrust of his arm, arching from behind 
his shoulders (PI. 19) and the firm clasp of his hands. The second 
right arm does not merely hold a sword, it wields the weapon that 
slayed the elephant demon, whereas the corresponding left hand 
catches in a bowl the blood dripping from Andhaka's impaled body 
so that it may not fall on the earth and produce new demons. The 
goddess Yogesvari, issued from Siva in this context, as a rule has this 
task assigned to her. 
Possibly a master other than the sculptor of the triptych and the 
grottos of Sundaramiirti; Nataraja, and YOgIsvara / Lakulisa (PIs. 1 -

18; 2 1-25) created the sculpture of Siva killing Andhaka. Although 
not represented by work in other chapels, two broken images22 from 
Elephanta may be attributed to this particular trend within the sculp­
tures of Elephanta. 
The chapels near the eastern entrance to the cave temple are now 
battered and blurred. They lack the grandeur of conception of the 
other compositions. The two recesses, right and left of the eastern 
entrance, one showing RavaI).a shaking Kailasa, and the other de­
picting Siva in his Himalayan cave accompanied by Parvati:, seated 
near him, are replete with layers of rock and cloud banks arrayed 
horizontally. Unlike the grotto compositions, each of these very high 
reliefs is carved with reference to one ground only. In this they con­
form with the style of the earlier reliefs of the YogesvarI cave temple 
near Bombay.23 They look forward to the three horizontal registers 
of the grotto compositions, the uppermost zone teeming with cloud 
banks, diminutive linga shrines, long-limbed flying celestials, and 
other motifs of the grotto sculptures. The panels near the east en­
trance predate the miracle of the creation of the other sculptures in 
the Great Cave Temple. 
The chapels at the northern entrance, oriented as they are toward 
the interior of the mukhamm;uJapa or portico, admit to or dismiss the 
devotee from Siva's presence in the cave temple. The chapel dedi­
cated to Siva Yogisvara / Lakulisa (Pl. 2 1 )  faces that of Siva N ataraja 
(Pl. 25). Siva is the primordial yogi, the guardian of creative energy, 
master of the discipline of its preservation, and also master and 
teacher of all the other arts that capture and give form audibly and 
visibly to the realization of ultimat࿻ reality. Incarnated in Lakulisa,24 
the Great Yogi is shown absorbed in meditation, his powerful body 
taut with the breath of life (praruz) that sustains creation (PI. 2 1 ). He is 
seated cross-legged in hieratic symmetry on an open lotus. Wide-pet-

It is the image of Durga in particular w hose volumetric, palpable fleshiness offers the 
strongest contrast with the respective portion of Ardhanarisvara's image, while the 
other image, representing Siva with Parvati and a gaJ:ta similarly contrasts with the fig­
ure of Parvati (Pis. 1 3, 1 4). The tremulous contour of the pudgy limbs of the figures of 
the Siva-Parvati fragment is absent from any of the figures of the grotto reliefs. Their 
contours are firm, their shapes comparatively "abstract."

aIled, the lotus has unfolded in its rocky setting, on a long stalk, 
straight as a pillar, a symbol of the cosmic pillar that traverses and 
holds together the universe. A Naga or serpent god on either side 
worships the pillar emerging from the watery netherworld. In the 
Great Yogi's grotto the congeries of figures advancing from the sides 
are being kept at bay from YOglsvara's immobile seat on top of the 
cosmic lotus (the lower part is not included in PI. 2 1). 
The grotto of the epiphany of the Great Yogi incarnated as Laku­
lisa is set back from the front of the chapel on a high platform leveled 
from out of rock boulders. Within the grotto of the lord of yogis, the 
two throngs of flying celestials stop short, having come to the orbit of 
Yogisvara's effulgence, the high nimbus rising from his shoulders. 
Siva as Lakulisa is at the same time the cosmic yogi enthroned in 
meditation on the lotus of iikiiSa above the world pillar, worshiped by 
serpents in an image akin to that of the Buddha similarly repre­
sented.25 The heroic bqdy of Siva, however, unlike that of the Bud­
dha image, expands with the might of the breath held in the powerful 
chest vaulting forward. It sustains the imperious verticality of Siva's 
body, and carries erect the full oval face of the Great Yogi in medita­
tion. Virile, disciplined, and effortless, the image is lord over all the 
gods whose figures make up the vibrancy around the immobile Lord 
of Yoga manifest in his grotto. The destroyed sculpture gives only a 
blurred suggestion of the original effect of that lord and teacher, the 
yogi whose eternal conquest of selfhood is celebrated in this cave, the 
Great Yogi whose breath is life itself within the stillness of his heroic 
body. He is the "lord of the cave" (Guhesvara).26 In sculptures (Ele­

is the lord of caves; he resides in caves (cf. LP. l .86·4-5; SP.2·5·44, 39-
40, 58). 
In the wedding scene, the figure of Siva was that of an ethereal ad­
olescent, the transubstantiated body composed of sentiency. As slayer 
of the demon Andhaka, Siva's body in lionlike nobility was an instru­
ment that even the God's wildest fury left exquisite. 
In the chapel opposite the image of YOglsvara / Lakulisa, however, 
the total being of Siva as Nataraja, the lord of dancers, imbues his 
movement (PIs. 22-24). The grave gyration of the dance takes into it­
self the space in which Siva dances and which surrounds him. Ampli­
tude and distortion of the full-bodied shape comprise an apparent 
weightlessness; vehement energy soars, stilled by its own impetus. 
The face of Siva, lord of dancers, more than any other of Siva's faces 
as carved in Elephanta, resembles that of Tatpurua. Nataraja's face 
is that of the quiddity of the dance. In it the Supreme Siva manifests 
(cf. KUP.2.5. 1-7). 
The eight-armed figure of Siva holds in one of his right hands an 
axe with a long staff. A serpent coiled round it rears its head toward 
Siva. The staff is inclined to the right, parallel in its decisive line to the 
tilt of Siva's head. The fourth left arm, raised and bent at the elbow, 
holds in its hand a folded cloth, gathered to unveil-{)r ready to veil­
the orbit of Siva's dance. It is the veil of maya. Withdrawing it, Lord 
Siva at will reveals his presence, the only reality; or he covers it by the 
intricate texture of the fabric of which the world of the senses is 
woven. In Nataraja's chapel, the flight of the celestials has dwindled 
and condensed into clusters n:miniscent of bracket capitals on which 
the ceiling of the cave seems to rest. The throng of the gods on the 
right and left of Nataraja is held spellbound. They seem to have 
halted, each of his own accord: the tall figure of Karttikeya (PI. 25), 
his son holding his staff, joyfully leaping GaI)eSa, Parvatj" s son above 
him, and the two celestial ris above him-all on the extreme proper 
right of Siva; while Parvati is on the left, with Indra above her. These 
figures facing forward rather than toward Siva are part of his epiph­
any, rather than building up the grotto in which the god manifests.3o 
The floating weightlessness of the amplitude of the body as much as 
the calm of intersecting planes of the dance-entranced face show the 
god at rest in the rhythm of his movement by which he dances the 
world into and out of existence. 
30 Cf. C. Sivaramamurti, The Art of India, p. 362, fig. 379.

The most cogent array of the celestial host arriving to celebrate the 
presence of Siva was seen to have congregated in Ardhanarisvara's 
epiphany (PI. 3). Jubilantly the figures make and fill the grotto of the 
compassionate lord. In the Gangadhara chapel, the disposition of the 
rejoicing gods is schematized; it is modified in the nuptials of Siva and 
Parvati. Reduced in number and more sparsely set, the attendant 
gods and nis witness Siva's dance or the samiidhi of the lord of yogis. 
In these two chapels of the mukhama1Jtf,apa, the immovable stasis of the 
lord of yogis faces the eternal movement of the lord of dancers. States 
of self-trance and entrancement are bodied forth in the sculptures of 
Elephanta. They are part of a total work of art, Siva's Great Cave 
Temple. 
Never before and never after has a sculptural modality such as the 
"grotto" directly issued from a realization of Siva, surrounded by the 
other gods manifesting in his world. Never before and never after has 
the transcendental reality that is Siva imbued the ontological symbol 
of his cosmos, the Pancamukha linga, so as to become the form of the 
triune head of Sadasiva as carved in the depth of the cave. 
A precursor to, or near contemporary with, the sculptural quality 
of the triptych and the Sundaramurti chapel of Elephanta is a colossal 
stele, possibly of Siva "Saptasvaramaya," Siva as embodiment of the 
seven principal musical notes.31 In weightless ponderosity the stand­
ing figures of Siva rise, a triple pillar soaring; they issue fourfold from 
the central pillar, each figure, each "note," sounded in clear perfec­
tion, in symphonic ascent and radiation above the supporting orches­
tra of gal).as at the bottom of the stele. The "Saptasvaramaya" image of 
Siva, Siva as the seven musical sounds-the music of the spheres­
unique in its iconography and form, is another work of Siva realiza­
tion to which a surpassingly great sculptor has given form. The image 
is still in worship in Parel, a suburb of Bombay. 
The style of these su preme works of art belongs to the region of the 
Konkan around Bombay, which enjoyed the patronage of the Kala­
curi dynasty, who were devotees of Siva.32 
The Saiva sculptures executed in the Konkan under the patronage 
of the Kalacuri dynasty were preceded by and owed much to Bud-
31 Siva " Saplasvaramaya," detail, see L. Frederic, The Art of India, p. 1 65, pI. 1 33; 
C. Sivaramamurti, The Art oj India, p. 176; A. de Lippe, Indian Medieval Sculpture, pI. 7. 
m vial is held in the left hand of (apparently) each of the seven figures. This aspect of 
Siva has as yet not been accounted for iconographically.

dhist cave sculpture of the Deccan under Vakaѱaka patronage. This is 
seen in the Saiva cave of Yogesvari in Amboli, near Bombay, which 
predates Elephanta. Soon the placid and somewhat staid character of 
the Vakaѱaka style inAuenced sculpture, as seen in the Yogesvari cave; 
but also the creative quality of this style to express by the subtlest 
modeling, the deepest devotion, as in the Buddhist rock-cut Cave 
Three, Aurangadad, became informed with dynamic grandeur and 
the capacity for conveying the superhuman reality that is Siva. 
The urge to give form to the realization of Siva was supported by 
qualities peculiar to western Indian sculpture commingling with those 
of the Vakaѱaka tradition. These were a fulsome, if stolid weightiness 
manifest already in Kanheri (near Bombay) in the second century 
A.D.,33 and a naturalism, stimulated by the Indian renaissance of Hel­
lenistic memories. The fusion of these two components brought about 
figures of western Indian sculpture like those from Samalaji and 
other sites in Gujarat and Rajasthan.34 They combine volumetric 
opulence with a facile "classical" charm. In some of the sculptures of 
the Yogesvari cave temple, as well as of Elephanta, a forcefully and 
naturalistically modeled body of palpable "Aeshiness" was given to im­
ages such as those of Harihara (Yogesvari) and Durga (Elephanta).35 
With these resources at their command, the sculptors of the Konkan 
fused the several components into a style having a new authority, 
ready to serve a new vision. Full-bodied, throbbing with elemental 
energies, controlled and calm in a superhuman way, of weightless 
gravity are the figures that communicate the presence of Siva to the 
cave temple at Elephanta. 
The Kalacuri school of sculpture, beginning in the Yogesvari cave 
and reaching its climax in Elephanta, continued to create rock-cut 
Saiva temples in Ellora. Mythic reliefs of heroic dimension and nar­
rative intent celebrate in the Ramesvara cave (Cave 2 1 )  at Ellora 
scenes like the "Austerities of Parvati" (PI. 26), carved shortly after 
Elephanta, that is, in the second half of the sixth century. The master 
sculptor of the Ramesvara cave, although having taken note of the

grottos of Elephanta, ordered the relief in sequences of pure and sim­
ple shapes. The figures seem to advance from the ground of the relief 
in a choreography of closely set columnar shapes attuned to the calm­
ness of suspended emotion in which the scene is set. 
The panel representing the "Austerities of Parvati," follows the ver­
sion of the myth narrated in the Viiriiha Purii1J{l (VrP .22.4-26), which 
differs from that of the Siva Purii1Ja according to which Siva in the 
guise of an old ascetic tries to dissuade Parvati from winning Siva to 
be her husband, pointing out the horror of Siva the ascetic. Hearing 
Parvatl praise Siva in his true and ultimate being, the ascetic reveals 
himself as Siva (Ch. X.B.2.c). The old ascetic put to the test Parvati's 
knowledge of Siva, the Supreme Reality (SP.2.3.26-28). According to 
the Viiriiha Purii1Ja, however, Siva in the disguise of an old brahmaciirin 
came to disturb Parvatl's austerities in order to test the tapas and com­
passion of the Great Goddess (VrP.22.4-26). 
In the relief of the Ramesvara cave, Parvatl, straight as a pillar and 
next to an "architectural" pillar, stands in the midst of four burning 
fires, only two being visible, in front of rocks. A fifth fire, that of the 
sun-not shown in the relief-scorches her, the ardor of whose tapas 
is greater than that of the fires in whose midst she stands. She counts 
the beads of her rosary unaware of the young ascetic (rather than an 
old beggar) who has approached her, holding out his hand. Parvatl, 
disturbed in her meditation on Siva, asks the beggar to go to bathe in 
the lotus pond nearby and return for his meal. In the pond a makara 
catches hold of the mendicant's leg. He cries out, and Parvatl, aban­
doning her meditation and also her scruples of touching the beggar, 
goes to his aid. She clasps his right arm with her left hand and raises 
the mendicant-who is Siva himself-from the monster's mouth. In 
the relief, the large and crowned figure of the god towers above that 
of the beggar rescued by Parvati's hand-her left hand, not her right 
that avoids pollution, but her left hand that is nearer to her heart. Sol­
emnly she stands to Siva's right, his bride-to-be. 
By her compassion, greater than her obedience to propriety, 
greater even than her asceticism, the Great Goddess wins Siva. The 
relief tells the story, joining in continuous narration two groups, that 
is, its two significant moments: on the left, the ascetic Parvati, her at­
tendant, and the beggar; on the right, once more Parvati, grown in 
stature, the beggar, and Siva. The figures betray no emotion. Like pil-

lars they mark the progress of the story. It begins with Parvall, the 
tapasvini, and ends with Siva, the Great God, with Parvatl, the Great 
Goddess, at his side. Rocks in low relief rise behind them. 
The sculptural restraint and solemn lyricism, the measured move­
ments and dispassionate faces of the postlike figures grouped in 
dense interlocking contiguity, have hardly more than one component 
in common with the sculptures of Elephanta. It is the underlying pon­
derosity of western Indian sculpture that asserts itself, particularly in 
the figures of Parvatl and in that of crowned Siva on the extreme right 
of the panel. The style in which the sculptor made his vision come 
true is not imbued with a realization of Siva. Rather, it is an enchanted 
rendering of a Saiva theme to which the sculptor brought his training 
and dedication. 
In a different vein and with all the resources of the school at his 
command, the sculptor of the image of Varahl (PI. 27), one of the 
seven mothers whose images occupy a wall of the Ramesvara cave, 
made the usually boar-faced goddess an embodiment of capricious 
hauteur and sensitive elegance. This high-brow Vanihl bewitches the 
viewer and subjects him to her charm. The charm of Parvatl in Ele­
phanta (Pis. 14, 15, 1 8) on the other hand, is an efflorescence of her 
being. More ancient than the group of the mothers who, with Yoges­
vari, came to Siva's assistance and intercepted the blood dripping 
from impaled Andhaka, is their sacred number seven (RV. 1 . 14 1 .2; 
1 . 146. 1 ;  2.5.2; 3.6.2; 4.42.8; g. i02.4). Images of these seven who 
embodied bad qualities but were the active powers (iakti) of the great 
gods, were carved in Elephanta (east wing),36 as also in the Ramesvara 
cave. While their standing figures in the former ale largely defaced, 
their seated images in the RameSvara cave are glaced by the alluring 
and unapproachable ambiguous beauty of Varahl, the Sakti of ViġI}u 
in his boar incarnation. 
The RameSvara cave represents the ability of the Kala.;uri artist to 
infuse the figures of Saiva themes with responses that were in the (lrt­
ist and to which the artist, whether himself a devotee of Siva or not, 
creatively gave form. At the other end of creative achievement, the 
sculptures of the nearly contemporary Dhumar Lena cave (Ellora, 
Cave 2g), in megalomaniac emulation of Elephanta, are inflated 
shapes void of the meaning that their iconography connotes. 
36 See Hiranand Sastri and R. Parimoo, A Guide to Elephanta, pI. 15. 

E L E P H A N T A · 4 65 
Continued creative impact of Elephanta on . Ellora was, however, 
provided for by the image of N atanija. The image of the dancing god 
in the Dasavatara cave (Cave 1 5, mid-eighth century) (PI. 28), about 
twO centuries later than Elephanta, shows the dancing body of the 
god move in the opposite direction from that of the Elephanta sculp­
ture. Body and limbs are elongated, the body languorous and atten­
uated. Here the stylishness of another, namely, the western Calukyan 
school of art, has assuaged the once formidable repose in movement 
of the image. To the three walls of the recess in which this large figure 
is inscribed cling the figures of a few assembled gods. The conception 
of the grotto is only residually valid here. The dancing figure fills, and 
one of its arms even exceeds, the recess in which it is displayed.37 
Compared to Elephanta, the dance has less vehemence and also less 
stillness. A posture sustained by the limbs of the dancing god rather 
than filled by his total being exceeds the bay. The subsidiary figures 
form an accompaniment and an audience; they identify the scene in 
which they are inscribed, they do not bring it about by their own dy­
namic participation, though an acute linear fluidity pervades the lan­
guor of the composition. 
Finally, in the LaiIkesvara cave of the Kailasa complex of sanctu­
aries (Cave 16, later part, eighth century) (PI. 29),38 Siva the great 
dancer is seen flinging himself into the plane of the relief by a torsion 
of hips which places the left leg from back to front and to the right 
with such superhuman elan that the movement of the right leg, bent 
in an obtuse angle, allows the lunging body to soar forward with the 
arms raised laterally, bent upward as a scale that balances above a slim 
torso the elongated head in three-quarter front view along with the 
backward tilt of its high coiffure. The multitude of arms branching 
off from the elbows leaves the shoulders unencumbered, and the 
hands, as far as they have not been broken off, are alive with the 
movements of birds in flight. 
Verve and balance of this TaI).Qava dance are enhanced by baroque 
fluttering scarves, festoons swinging from the crown, and a number 
of style elements absorbed from the several schools of art that had 
37 For the entire "grotto" relief, see L. Frederic, The Art of India, p. 162, pI. 1 2g. The 
left raised arm, only part of which can be seen in PI. 28, extends the diagonal thrust of 
the figure's movement from the bent right knee upward to the top of the bay, where it 
is cut short by the ceiling of the bay.

succeeded the Kalacuri style of EBora.39 Not part of a grotto, the fig­
ures of flying gods on either side at the top establish here the fore­
ground of the celestial spectacle. Two gaJ)as have found room be­
tween the wide-apart feet of the dancer. The grotto formed by the 
figures of the gods and in which Siva dances and manifests variously 
in Elephanta has dissolved, and its figures, in several vestigial groups, 
cling to the wall of a rectangular stage. 
It was only after another two hundred years, from the tenth into 
the thirteenth century, that Siva's Ananda Tal).<;lava was created-this 
time in South India, in the round, in glorious bronze images en­
shrined in sanctuaries of their own. 
The grotto composition created in Elephanta may be considered a 
specifically Saiva form of sculpture carved in the living rock. Another 
type of rock-cut relief was employed in Ellora on the inner face of the 
entrance to the Kailasa temple. It shows Siva the Archer as Tripuran­
taka, the Destroyer of the triple city of the demons (PI. 30). Siva, from 
his chariot drawn by four swift horses, the Vedas, flying through the 
air, discharges his arrow and destroys by one single shot the rule of 
the demons in the three worlds (eh. XI.3.b). His bow arches over the 
god's slim body, a taut curve of energy sweeping upward and includ­
ing the high crown of the god in its sweep. The entire scene is meant 
to be seen taking place in the air through which the horses are flying. 
The miracle of the swiftly flying arrow was the theme of the sculptor. 
The four Veda-horses convey it by their flight, carved on a rock-cut 
wall at a right angle to the plane that is the ground of the archer in 
his chariot. Impassive Brahma is the charioteer and ViøJ)u, in bull 
shape, confidently rests in front of him. Siva, the archer, a figure of 
trim Palla va style shape, and the four Veda-horses are forms of one 
pointed energy cutting across the air, here presented by the space 
held between two walls intersecting at a right angle. Siva's bow, curv­
ing from one wall to the other, holds in its arc victor and victim, the 
latter of diminutive shape, limbs spread out flying, falling, to his 
doom. His defeat parallels Siva's victory. Above Siva's bow more de­
mons tumble along the wall of defeat. The flying, long-limbed celes࿼ 
tials of Elephanta come to mind. 
The architectural moldings of the chariot on one wall and the rec­
tangular niche cut out to accommodate the horses on the other are

Sources and Relationships of the Kailasa Temple in EBora," 1977.

contrivances, each of which emphasizes its own wall and singles out 
the space between them as part of the total composition. The conti­
nuity of the scene, represented on two adjacent intersecting walls, was 
taken up in the Kailasa temple in Ellora nearly a thousand years after 
the excavation from the living rock of the Buddhist Vihara at Bhaja 
in the Konkan.40 There, a throng of demoniac figures carved in low 
relief seems to have seeped out of one wall and its density continues 
on the adjacent wall at a right angle, making this part of the courtyard 
a corner charged with mythical content. Irrespective of the difference 
in style, the rock, under the hand of the sculptor, allowed itself to be 
treated as a continuous relief around the corner. 
Sculpture in the rock, different from architecture and its structural 
framework, allows myths to be conveyed in a visual form suggested to 
the sculptor by the mass of the rock itself. Continuity of relief around 
a corner includes the space between the perpendicular walls as part 
of the artistic whole, and is one of the two creative forms of rock 
sculpture. The other is the grotto. Its space is my tho-sculptural; it is 
the mode in which Siva manifested in Elephanta. 
A counter example to the my tho-sculptural quality of the Tri­
purantaka carving in the gate wall of the court of the Kailasa temple 
is a rectangular panel of Siva Tripurantaka (PI. 3 1 )  carved in low re­
lief in a narrow corridor of the Kailasa temple, in yet another, the RaĠ­
trakuta style, proper to Ellora of the eighth century, confining within 
its limits the martial vigor of Siva's attack on the "triple city." 
The timeless state of being of Siva pervaded the sculptures of Ele­
phanta, even though a particular myth at its significant moment was 
the theme. In a very large sculpture of the Kailasa temple (latter part 
of the eighth century) the myth is housed in a cave setting of architec­
tural quality. The theme is "Siva shows his grace to Raval).a" (PI. 32), 
as the demon king is about to uproot Siva's mountainY The event is 
staged in a hieratic ally composed grotto where rocks resembling ar­
chitectural moldings in the lower part of the composition frame the 
deep cavity of Raval).a's earth-shaking enterprise. Its futility is dem­
onstrated by the order in Siva's Himalayan residence, a grotto idyll 
recessed above Raval).a's dark station. On a high throne of rocks enliv­
ened with gal).as, Siva and Parvatl tower above two guardians whose

quietly seated figures occupy each a niche of its own, flanking Siva's 
throne of rock boulders. Parvatl's lithe shape reclines against Siva, 
and she clasps the left arm of her lord. His subtly delicate shape is 
averted from her in a posture of ease, with his right arm raised, bal­
ancing his battle axe with his fingers, while the toe of his left foot, by 
merely touching the ground, stabilizes the quaking mountain. Deeper 
in the grotto, unnoticed by the divine couple, a female attendant 
rushes into a further recess of the cave. Her fleeing back view, the 
face turned toward Parvati, gives the only indication of imminent 
danger. Diminutive figures of worshiping celestials on craglike, scal­
loped clouds, descended from the impetuously flying celestial hosts of 
Elephanta, form here, as they did before, a baldachin of Siva's cave. 
A rationalized composition disposing its figures with courtly tact and 
tenderness creates a tableau of Siva in his well-ordered mountain res­
idence. Raval)a's futile attempt at shaking the mountain will be par­
doned, as is anticipated by the clear symmetries of this grotto idyll, a 
late descendant of Elephanta's pristine artistic power of rendering 
Siva's presence.
