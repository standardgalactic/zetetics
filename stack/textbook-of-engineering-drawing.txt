CHAPTER 1 
1.1 Introduction 
Drawing Instruments and 
Accessories 
Engineering drawing is a two dimensional representation of three dimensional objects. In general, it 
provides necessary information about the shape, size, surface quality, material, manufacturing process, 
etc., of the object. It is the graphic language from which a trained person can visualise objects. 
Drawings prepared in one country may be utilised in any other country irrespective of the 
language spoken. Hence, engineering drawing is called the universal language of engineers. Any 
language to be communicative, should follow certain rules so that it conveys the same meaning to 
every one. Similarly, drawing practice must follow certain rules, if it is to serve as a means of 
communication. For this purpose, Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) adapted the International 
Standards on code of practice for drawing. The other foreign standards are: DIN of Germany, BS 
of Britain and ANSI of America. 
1.2 Role of Engineering Drawing 
The ability to read drawing is the most important requirement of all technical people in any profession. 
As compared to verbal or written description, this method is brief and more clear. Some of the 
applications are : building drawing for civil engineers, machine drawing for mechanical engineers, 
circuit diagrams for electrical and electronics engineers, computer graphics for one and all. 
The subject in general is designed to impart the following skills. 
1. Ability to read and prepare engineering drawings. 
2. Ability to make free - hand sketching of objects. 
3. Power to imagine, analyse and communicate, and 
4. Capacity to understand other subjects: 
1.3 Drawing Instrument and Aids 
The Instruments and other aids used in draughting work are listed below: 
1. Drawing board 
2. Mini draughter 
3. Instrument box 
4. Set squares 
5. Protractor 
6. Set of scales 
7. French curves 
8. Drawing sheets 
9. Pencils 
10. Templates

1.3.1 Drawing Board 
Until recently drawing boards used are made of well seasoned softwood of about 25 mm thick with 
a working edge for T-square. Nowadays mini-draughters are used instead of T-squares which 
can be fixed on any board. The standard size of board depends on the size of drawing sheet size 
required.

Drawing sheet 
Fig. 1.1 Mini-draughter 
1.3.2 Mini-Draughter 
Mini-draughter consists of an angle formed by two arms with scales marked and rigidly hinged to 
each other (Fig. I. I ). It combines the functions ofT-square, set-squares, scales and protractor. It is 
used for drawing horizontal, vertical and inclined lines, parallel and perpendicular lines and for 
measuring lines and angles. 
1.3.3 Instrument Box 
Instrument box contains 1. Compasses, 2. Dividers and 3. Inking pens. What is important is the 
position of the pencil lead with respect to the tip of the compass. It should be atleast I mm above as 
shown in Fig. 1.2 because the tip goes into the board for grip by 1 mm.

1.3.4 Set of Scales 
Scales are used to make drawing of the objects to proportionate size desired. These are made of 
wood, steel or plastic (Fig.I.3). BIS recommends eight set-scales in plastic/cardboard with 
designations MI, M2 and so on as shown in Table 1.1 Set of scales

1.3.5 French Curves 
French curves are available in different shapes (Fig. 1.4). First a series of points are plotted along 
the desired path and then the most suitable curve is made along the edge of the curve. A flexible 
curve consists of a lead bar inside rubber which bends conveniently to draw a smooth curve 
through any set of points.

1.3.6 Tern plates 
These are aids used for drawing small features such as circles, arcs, triangular, square and other 
shapes and symbols used in various science and engineering fields (Fig.l.5). 
Fig. 1.5 Template 
1.3.7 Pencils 
Pencils with leads of different degrees of hardness or grades are available in the market. The 
hardness or softness of the lead is indicated by 3H, 2H, H, HB, B, 2B, 3B, etc. The grade HB 
denotes medium hardness oflead used for general purpose. The hardness increases as the value of 

__________________ Drawing Instruments and Accessories 
1.5 
the numeral before the letter H increases. The lead becomes softer, as the value of the numeral 
before B increases (Fig.l.6). 
Hard 
Soft 
Fig. 1.6 Pencil Leads 
The selection of the grade depends on the line quality desired for the drawing. Pencils of grades 
H or 2H may be used for finishing a pencil drawing as these give a sharp black line. Softer grade 
pencils are used for sketching work. HB grade is recommended for lettering and dimensioning. 
Nowadays mechanical pencils are widely used in place of wooden pencils. When these are 
used, much of the sharpening time can be saved. The number 0.5,0.70 of the pen indicates the 
thickness of the line obtained with the lead and the size of the lead diameter. 
Micro-tip pencils with 0.5 mm thick leads with the following grades are recommended. 
Fig. 1.7 Mechanical Pencil 
HB Soft grade for Border lines, lettering and free sketching 
H Medium grade for Visible outlines, visible edges and boundary lines 
2H Hard grade for construction lines, Dimension lines, Leader lines, Extension lines, Centre lines, 
Hatching lines and Hidden lines. 

CHAPTER 2 
Lettering and Dimensioning Practices 
(As per BIS : SP : 46 : 2003) 
2.1 
Introduction 
Engineering drawings are prepared on standard size drawing sheets. The correct shape and size 
of the object can be visualised from the understanding of not only its views but also from the 
various types of lines used, dimensions, notes, scale etc. For uniformity, the drawings must be 
drawn as per certain standard practice. This chapter deals with the drawing practices as 
recommended by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) SP: 46:2003. These are adapted from what is 
followed by International Standards Organisation (ISO). 
2.2 
Drawing Sheet 
The standard drawing sheet sizes are arrived at on the basic Principal of 
x: y = 1 : -..12 and xy = 1 where x and yare the sides of the sheet. For example AO, having a surface 
area of 1 Sq.m; x = 841 rom and y = 1189 mm. The successive sizes are obtained by either by 
halving along the length or.doubling the width, the area being in the ratio 1 : 2. Designation of sizes 
is given in Fig.2.l and their sizes are given in Table 2.1. For class work use of A2 size drawing 
sheet is preferred.

2.2.4 Lines (IS 10714 (part 20): 2001 and SP 46: 2003) 
Just as in English textbook the correct words are used for making correct sentences; in Engineering 
Graphics, the details of various objects are drawn by different types of lines. Each line has a 
defmite meaning and sense toconvey. 
IS 10714 (Pint 20): 2001 (General principles of presentation on technical drawings) and SP 46:2003 
specify the following types oflines and their applications: 
• Visible Outlines, Visible .Edges : Type 01.2 (Continuous wide lines) The lines drawn 
to represent the visible outlines/ visible edges / surface boundary lines of objects should be 
outstanding in appearance. 
• Dimension Lines: Type 01.1 (Continuous narrow Lines) Dimension Lines are drawn 
to mark dimension. 
• Extension Lines: Type 01.1 (Continuous narrow Lines) 
• There are extended slightly beyond the respective dimension lines. 

__________________ Lettering and Dimensioning Practices 
2.5 
• Construction Lines: Type 01.1 (Continuous narrow Lines) 
Construction Lines are drawn for constructing drawings and should not be erased after 
completion of the drawing. 
• Hatching / Section Lines: Type 01.1 (Continuous Narrow Lines) 
Hatching Lines are drawn for the sectioned portion of an object. These are drawn inclined 
at an angle of 45° to the axis or to the main outline of the section. 
• Guide Lines: Type 01.1 (Continuous Narrow Lines) 
Guide Lines are drawn for lettering and should not be erased after lettering. 
• Break Lines: Type 01.1 (Continuous Narrow Freehand Lines) 
Wavy continuous narrow line drawn freehand is used to represent bre~ of an object. 
• Break Lines : Type 01.1 (Continuous Narrow Lines With Zigzags) 
Straight continuous ~arrow line with zigzags is used to represent break of an object. 
• Dashed Narrow Lines: Type 02.1 (Dashed Narrow Lines) 
Hidden edges / Hidden outlines of objects are shown by dashed lines of short dashes of 
equal lengths of about 3 mm, spaced at equal distances of about 1 mm. the points of intersection 
of these lines with the outlines / another hidden line should be clearly shown. 
• Center Lines: Type 04.1 (Long-Dashed Dotted Narrow Lines) 
Center Lines are draWn at the center of the drawings symmetrical about an axis or both the 
axes. These are extended by a short distance beyond the outline of the drawing. 
• " Cutting Plane Lines: Type 04.1 and Type 04.2 
Cutting Plane Line is drawn to show the location of a cutting plane. It is long-dashed dotted 
narrow line, made wide at the ends, bends and change of direction. The direction of viewing 
is shown by means of arrows resting on the cutting plane line. 
• Border Lines 
Border Lines are continuous wide lines of minimum thickness 0.7 mm

Understanding the various types oflines used in drawing (i.e.,) their thickness, style of construction 
and appearance as per BIS and following them meticulously may be considered as the foundation 
of good drawing skills. Table 2.2 shows various types oflines with the recommended applications.

Precedence of Lines 
1. When a Visible Line coincide with a Hidden Line or Center Line, draw the Visible Line. 
Also, extend the Center Line beyond the outlines of the view. 
2. When a Hidden Line coincides with a Center Line, draw the Hidden Line. 
3. When a Visible Line coincides with a Cutting Plane, draw the Visible Line. 
4. When a Center line coincides with a Cutting Plane, draw the Center Line and show the 
Cutting Plane line outside the outlines of the view at the ends of the Center Line by thick 
dashes. 
2.3 LETTERING [IS 9609 (PART 0) : 2001 AND SP 46 : 2003] 
Lettering is defined as writing of titles, sub-titles, dimensions, etc., on a drawing. 
2.3.1 Importance of Lettering 
To undertake production work of an engineering components as per the drawing, the size and 
other details are indicated on the drawing. This is done in the fonn of notes and dimensions. 
Main Features of Lettering are legibility, unifonnity and rapidity of execution. Use of drawing 
instruments for lettering consumes more time. Lettering should be done freehand with speed. 
Practice accompanied by continuous efforts would improve the lettering skill and style. Poor lettering 
mars the appearance of an otherwise good drawing. 
BIS and ISO Conventions 
IS 9609 (Part 0) : 2001 and SP 46 : 2003 (Lettering for technical drawings) specifY lettering in 
technical product documentation. This BIS standard is based on ISO 3098-0: 1997. 
2.3.2 Single Stroke Letters 
The word single-stroke should not be taken to mean that the lettering should be made in one stroke 
without lifting the pencil. It means that the thickness of the letter should be unifonn as if it is 
obtained in one stroke of the pencil. 
2.3.3 Types of Single Stroke Letters 
1. Lettering Type A: (i) Vertical and (ii) Sloped (~t 75 0 to the horizontal) 
2. Lettering Type B : (i) Vertical and (ii) Sloped (at 75
0 to the horizontal) 
Type B Preferred 
In Type A, height of the capital letter is divided into 14 equal parts, while in Type B, height of the 
capital letter is divided into 10 equal parts. Type B is preferred for easy and fast execution, because 
of the division of height into 10 equal parts. 
Vertical Letters Preferred 
Vertical letters are preferred for easy and fast execution, instead of sloped letters. 

2.8 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing--------------------
Note: Lettering in drawing should be in CAPITALS (i.e., Upper-case letters). 
Lower-case (small) letters are used for abbreviations like mm, cm, etc. 
2.3.4 Size of Letters 
• Size of Letters is measured by the height h of the CAPITAL letters as well as numerals. 
• Standard heights for CAPITAL letters and numerals recommended by BIS are given below : 
1.8, 2.5, 3.5, 5, 6, 10, 14 and 20 mm 
Note: Size of the letters may be selected based upon the size of drawing. 
Guide Lines 
In order to obtain correct and uniform height ofletters and numerals, guide lines are drawn, using 
2H pencil with light pressure. HB grade conical end pencil is used for lettering. 
2.3.5 Procedure for Lettering 
1. Thin horizontal guide lines are drawn first at a distance ' h' apart. 
2. Lettering Technique: Horizontal lines of the letters are drawn from left to right. Vertical, 
inclined and curved lines are drawn from top to bottom. 
3. After lettering has been completed, the guidelines are not erased. 
2.3.6 Dimensioning of Type B Letters (Figs 2.5 and 2.6) 
BIS denotes the characteristics of lettering as : 
h (height of capita) letters), 
ci (height of lower-case letters), 
c2 (tail of lower-case letters), 
c3 (stem of lower-case letters), 
a (spacing between characters), 
bl & b2 (spacing between baselines), 
e (spacing between words) and 
d (line thickness),

The following are some of the guide lines for lettering (Fig 2.9 & 2.10) 
1. Drawing numbers, title block and letters denoting cutting planes, sections are written in 
10 mrn size. 
2. Drawing title is written in 7 mm size. 
3. Hatching, sub-titles, materials, dimensions, notes, etc., are written in 3.5 mm size. 
4. Space between lines = ~ h. 
5. Space between words may be equal to the width of alphabet M or 3/5 h. 

2.10 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing--------------_____ _ 
Fig. 2.9 Inclined Lettering 
6. Space between letters should be approximately equal to 115 h. Poor spacing will affect the 
visual effect. 
7. The spacing between two characters may be reduced by half if th is gives a better visual 
effect, as for example LA, TV; over lapped in case of say LT, TA etc, and the space is 
increased for letters with adjoining stems. 
CAPITAL Letters 
• Ratio of height to width for most of the CAPITAL letters is approximately = 10:6 
• However, for M and W, the ratio = 10:8 for I the ratio = 10:2 
Lower-case Letters 
• Height of lower-case letters with stem I tail (b, d, f, g, h, j, k, I, p, q, t, y) = Cz = c3 = h 
• Ratio of height to width for lower-case letters with stem or tail = 10:5 
• Height of lower-case letters without stem or tail c1 is approximately = (7/10) h 
• Ratio of height to width for most lower-case letters without stem or tail = 7: 5 
• However, for m and w, the ratio = 7: 7. For I and I, the ratio = 10:2

2.4 Dimensioning 
Drawing of a compo Inent, in addition to prividing complete shape description, must also furnish 
information regarding the size description. These are provided through the distances between the 
surfaces, location of holes, nature of surface finish, type of material, etc. The expression of these 
features on a drawing, using lines, symbols, figures and notes is called dimensioning.

2.4.1 Principles of Dimensioning 
Some of the basic principles of dimensioning are given below. 
I. All dimensional information necessary to describe a component clearly and completely shall 
be written directly on a drawing. 
2. Each feature shall be dimensioned once only on a drawing, i.e., dimension marked in one 
view need not be repeated in another view. 
3. Dimension should be placed on the view where the shape is best seen (Fig.2.14) 
4. As far as possible, dimensions should be expressed in one unit only preferably in millimeters, 
without showing the unit symbol (mm). 
5. As far as possible dimensions should be placed outside the view (Fig.2.15). 
6. Dimensions should be taken from visible outlines rather than from hidden lines (Fig.2.16).

7. No gap should be left between the feature and the start of the extension line (Fig.2.I7). 
8. Crossing of centre lines should be done by a long dash and not a short dash (Fig.2.I8).

2.4.2 Execution of Dimensions 
1. Prejection and dimension lines should be drawn as thin continuous lines. projection lines 
should extend slightly beyond the respective dimension line. Projection lines should be drawn 
perpendicular to the feature being dimensioned. If the space for dimensioning is insufficient, 
the arrow heads may be reversed and the adjacent arrow heads may be replaced by a dot 
(Fig.2.19). However, they may be drawn obliquely, but parallel to each other in special cases, 
such as on tapered feature (Fig.2.20).

2. A leader line is a line referring to a feature (object, outline, dimension). Leader lines should 
be inclined to the horizontal at an angle greater than 30°. Leader line should tenninate, 
(a) with a dot, if they end within the outline ofan object (Fig.2.21a). 
(b) with an arrow head, if they end on outside of the object (Fig.2.21b). 
(c) without a dot or arrow head, if they end on dimension line (Fig.2.21c).

Fig. 2.21 Termination of leader lines 
Dimension Termination and Origin Indication 
Dimension lines should show distinct tennination in the fonn of arrow heads or oblique strokes or 
where applicable an origin indication (Fig.2.22). The arrow head included angle is 15°. The origin 
indication is drawn as a small open circle of approximately 3 mm in diameter. The proportion lenght 
to depth 3 : 1 of arrow head is shown in Fig.2.23.

__________________ Lettering and Dimensioning Practices 
2.17 
When a radius is dimensioned only one arrow head, with its point on the arc end of the dimension 
line should be used (Fig.2.24). The arrow head termination may be either on the inside or outside 
of the feature outline, depending on the size of the feature. 
Fig. 2.24 Dimensioning of Radii 
2.4.3 Methods of Indicating Dimensions 
The dimensions are indicated on the drawings according to one of the following two methods. 
Method - 1 (Aligned method) 
Dimensions should be placed parallel to and above their dimension lines and preferably at the 
middle, and clear of the line. (Fig.2.25). 
70 
Fig. 2.25 Aligned Method 
Dimensions may be written so that they can be read from the bottom or from the right side of 
the drawing. Dinensions on oblique dimension lines should be oriented as shown in Fig.2.26a and 
except where unavoidable, they shall not be placed in the 30° zone. Angular dimensions are oriented 
as shown in Fig.2.26b 
Method - 2 (uni-directional method) 
Dimensions should be indicated so that they can be read from the bottom of the drawing only. 
Non-horizontal dimension lines are interrupted, preferably in the middle for insertion of the dimension 
(Fig.2.27a). 
Angular dimensions may be oriented as in Fig.2.27b 
Note: Horizontal dimensional lines are not broken to place the dimension in both cases.

The following indications are used with dimensions to show applicable shape identification and to 
improve drawing interpretation. The diameter and square symbols may be omitted where the shape 
is clearly indicated. The applicable indication (symbol) shall precede the value for dimension 
(Fig. 2.28 to 2.32).

2.5 Arrangement of Dimensions 
a 
..:# o 
Fig. 2.30 
Fig. 2.31 
Fig. 2.32 
The arrangement of dimensions on a drawing must indicate clearly the purpose of the design of the 
object. They are arranged in three ways. 
1. Chain dimensioning 
2. Parallel dimensioning 
3. Combined dimensioning. 
1. Chain dimensioning 
Chain of single dimensioning should be used only where the possible accumulation of tolerances 
does not endanger the fundamental requirement of the component (Fig.2.33) 
2. Parallel dimensioning 
In parallel dimensioning, a number of dimension lines parallel to one another and spaced out, 
are used. This method is used where a number of dimensions have a common datum feature 
(Fig.2.34).

CHAPTER 3 
Scales 
3.1 
Introduction 
It is not possible always to make drawings of an object to its actual size. If the actual linear 
dimensions of an object are shown in its drawing, the scale used is said to be a full size scale. 
Wherever possible, it is desirable to make drawings to full size. 
3.2 
Reducing and Enlarging Scales 
Objects which are very big in size can not be represented in drawing to full size. In such cases the 
object is represented in reduced size by making use of reducing scales. Reducing scales are used 
to represent objects such as large machine parts, buildings, town plans etc. A reducing scale, say 
1: 10 means that 10 units length on the object is represented by 1 unit length on the drawing. 
Similarly, for drawing small objects such as watch parts, instrument components etc., use offull 
scale may not be useful to represent the object clearly. In those cases enlarging scales are used. 
An enlarging scale, say 10: 1 means one unit length on the object is represented by 10 units on the 
drawing. 
The designation of a scale consists of the word. SCALE, followed by the indication of its ratio 
as follows. (Standard scales are shown in Fig. 3.1) 
Scale 1: 1 for full size scale 
Scale 1: x for reducing scales (x = 10,20 ...... etc.,) 
Scale x: 1 for enlarging scales. 
Note: For all drawings the scale has to be mentioned without fail.

3.3 Representative Fraction 
The ratio of the dimension of the object shown on the drawing to its actual size is called the 
Representative Fraction (RF). 
RF

If the desired scale is not available in the set of scales it may be constructed and then used. 
Metric Measurements 
10 millimetres (mm) = 1 centimetre( cm) 
10 centimetres (cm) = 1 decimetre(dm) 
10 decimetre (dm) = 1 metre(m) 
10 metres (m) = 1 decametre (dam) 
10 decametre (dam) = 1 hectometre (bm) 
10 hectometres (bm) = 1 kilometre (km) 
1 hectare = 10,000 m2 
3.4 Types of Scales 
The types of scales normally used are: 
1. Plain scales. 
2. Diagonal Scales. 
3. Vernier Scales. 
3.4.1 Plain Scales 
A plain scale is simply a line which is divided into a suitable number of equal parts, the fIrst of 
which is further sub-divided into small parts. It is used to represent either two units or a unit and its 
fraction such as km and bm, m and dm, cm and mm etc. 
Problem 1 : On a survey map the distance between two places 1 km apart is 5 cm. Construct 
the scale to read 4.6 km.

Note: If 4.6 km itself were to be taken x = 23 cm. To get 1 km divisions this length has to be 
divided into 4.6 parts which is difficult. Therefore, the nearest round figure 5 km is considered. 
When this length is divided into 5 equal parts each part will be 1 km. 
1. Draw a line of length 25 cm. 
2. Divide this into 5 equal parts. Now each part is 1 km. 
3. Divide the first part into 10 equal divisions. Each division is 0.1 km.

3.4.2 Diagonal Scales . 
Plain scales are used to read lengths in two units such as metres and decimetres, centimetres and 
millimetres etc., or to read to the accuracy correct to first decimal. 
Diagonal scales are used to represent either three units of measurements such as metres, 
decimetres, centimetres or to read to the accuracy correct to two decimals. 
Principle of Diagonal Scale (Fig 3.6) 
1. Draw a line AB and errect a perperrdicular at B. 
2. Mark 10 equi-distant points (1,2,3, etc) of any suitable length along this perpendicular and 
mark C. 
3. Complete the rectangle ABCD 
4. Draw the diagonal BD.

Thus, the lines 1-1',2 - 2', 3 - 3' etc., measure O.lCD, 0.2CD, 0.3CD etc. respectively. Thus, 
CD is divided into 1110 the divisions by the diagonal BD, i.e., each horizontal line is a multiple of 11 
10 CD. 
This principle is used in the construction of diagonal scales. 
Note: B C must be divided into the same number of parts as there are units of the third dimension 
in one unit of the secondary division.

3.4.3 Vernier Scales 
The vernier scale is a short auxiliary scale constructed along the plain or main scale, which can 
read upto two decimal places. 
The smallest division on the main scale and vernier scale are 1 msd or 1 vsd repectively. 
Generally (n+ 1) or (n-l) divisions on the main scale is divided into n equal parts on the vernier 
scale. 
(n -1) 
(1) 
Thus, 1 vsd = -n-msd or 1-; msd 
When 1 vsd < 1 it is called forward or direct vernier. The vernier divisions are numbered in the 
same direction as those on the main scale. 
When 1 vsd> 1 or (1 + lin), It is called backward or retrograde vernier. The vernier divisions 
are numbered in the opposite direction compared to those on the main scale. 
The least count (LC) is the smallest dimension correct to which a measurement can be made 
with a vernier. 
For forward vernier, L C = (1 msd - 1 vsd) 
For backward viermier, LC = (1 vsd - 1 msd) 
Problem 8 : Construct a forward reading vernier scale to read distance correct to decametre 
on a map in which the actual distances are reduced in the ratio of 1 : 40,000. The scale 
should be long enough to measure upto 6 km. Mark on the scale a length of 3.34 km and 
0.59 km. 
Solution: (Fig. 3.10) 
6xl000x 100 
1. RF = 1140000; length of drawing = 
40000 
= 15 em 
2. 15 em is divided into 6 parts and each part is 1 km 
3. This is further divided into 10 divitions and each division is equal to 0.1 km = 1 hectometre. 
Ims d = 0.1 km = 1 hectometre 
L.C expressed in terms of m s d = (111 0) m s d 
L C is 1 decametre = 1 m s d - 1 v s d 
1 v s d = 1 - 1110 = 9110 m s d = 0.09 km 
4. 9 m sd are taken and divided into 10 divisions as shown. Thus 1 vsd = 9110 = 0.09 km 
5. Mark on itbytaking6vsd=6x 0.9 = 0.54km, 28msd(27 + 1 on the LHS of 1) =2.8 kmand 
Tota12.8 + 0.54 = 3.34 km. 
6. Mark on it 5 msd = 0.5 km and add to it one vsd = 0.09, total 0.59 km as marked.

Conic Sections 
Cone is formed when a right angled triangle with an apex and angle e is rotated about its altitude 
as the axis. The length or height of the cone is equal to the altitude of the triangle and the radius of 
the base of the cone is equal to the base of the triangle. The apex angle of the cone is 2 e 
(Fig.4.20a). 
When a cone is cut by a plane, the curve formed along the section is known as a conic. For this 
purpose, the cone may be cut by different section planes (Fig.4.20b) and the conic sections obtained 
are shown in Fig.4.20c, d, and e.

When a cone is cut by a section plane A-A making an angle a = 90° with the axis, the section 
obtained is a circle. (Fig 4.20a) 
4.2.2 Ellipse 
When a cone is cut by a section plane B-B at an angle, a more than half of the apex angle i.e., e 
and less than 90°, the curve of the section is an ellipse. Its size depends on the angle a and the 
distance of the section plane from the apex of the cone. 
4.2.3 Parabola 
If the angle a is equal to e i.e., when the section plane C-C is parallel to the slant side of the cone. 
the curve at the section is a parobola. This is not a closed figure like circle or ellipse. The size of 
the parabola depends upon the distance of the section plane from the slant side of the cone. 
4.2.4 Hyperbola 
If the angle a is less than e (section plane D-D), the curve at the section is hyperbola. The curve 
of intersection is hyperbola, even if a = e, provided the section plane is not passing through the 
apex of the cone. However if the section plane passes through the apex, the section produced is an 
isosceles triangle.

4.2.5 Conic Sections as Loci of a Moving Point 
A conic section may be defined as the locus of a point moving in a plane such that the ratio of its 
distance from a fixed point (Focus) and fixed straight line (Directrix) is always a constant. The 
ratio is called eccentricity. The line passing through the focus and perpendicular to the directrix is 
the axis of the curve. The point at which the conic section intersects the axis is called the vertex or 
apex of the curve. 
The eccentricity value is less than 1 for ellipse, equal to I for parabola and greater than 1 for 
hyperbola (F ig.4.21).

An ellipsoid is generated by rotating an ellipse about its major axis. An ellipsoidal surface is used as 
a head-lamp reflector. The light source (bulb) is placed at the fIrst focus F I (Fig.4.36). This works 
effectively, if the second focus F2 is at a sufficient distance from the fIrst focus. Thus, the light

CHAPTERS 
Orthographic Projections 
5.1 Introduction 
In the preceding chapters 1 to 4 plane geometry, where the constructions of the geometrical 
figures having only two dimensions are discussed, solid geometry is delt with in the following 
chapters. 
Engineering drawing, particularly solid geometry is the graphic language used in the industry to 
record the ideas and informations necessary in the form of blue prints to make machines, buildings, 
strutures etc., by engineers and technicians who design, develop, manufacture and market the 
products. 
5.1.1 Projection 
As per the optical physics, an object is seen when the light rays called visual rays coming from the 
object strike the observer's eye. The size of the image formed in the retina depends on the distance 
of the observer from the object. 
If an imaginary transparent plane is introduced such that the object is in between the observer 
and the plane, the image obtained on the screen is as shown in Fig.5.1. This is called perspective 
view of the object. Here, straight lines (rays) are drawn from various points on the contour of the 
object to meet the transparent plane, thus the object is said to be projected on that plane. 
Converging rays 
Observer 
Fig. 5.1 Perspective Projection 

5.2 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing-------------------
The figure or view fonned by joining, in correct sequence, the points at which these lines meet the 
plane is called the projection of the object. The lines or rays drawn from the object to the plane are 
called projectors. The transparent plane on which the projections are drawn is known as plane of 
projection. 
5.2 Types of Projections 
1. Pictorial projections 
(i) Perspective projection 
(ii) Isometric projection 
(iii) Oblique projection 
2. Orthographic Projections 
1. Pictorial Projections 
The Projections in which the description of the object is completely understood in one view 
is known as pictorial projection. They have the advantage of conveying an immediate 
impression of the general shape and details ofthe object, but not its true dimensions or sizes. 
2. Orthographic Projection 
'ORTHO' means right angle and orthographic means right angled drawing. When the 
projectors are perpendicular to the plane on which the projection is obtained, it is known as 
orthographic projection. 
5.2.1 Method of Obtaining Front View 
Imagine an observer looking at the object from an infinite distance (Fig.5.2). The rays are parallel 
to each other and perpendicular to both the front surface of the object and the plane. When the 
observer is at a finite distance from the object, the rays converge to the eye as in the case of 
perspective projection. When the observer looks from the front surface F or the block, its true 
shape and size is seen. When the rays or porjectors are extended further they meet the vertical 
plane(Y.P) located behind the object. By joining the projectors meeting the plane in correct sequence 
the Front view (Fig. 5.2) is obtained. 
Front view shows only two dimensions of the object, Viz. length L and height H. It does not 
show the breadth B. Thus one view or projection is insufficient for the complete description of the 
object. 
As Front view alone is insufficient for the complete description of the object, another plane 
called Horizontal plane (H.P) is assumed such that it is hinged and perpendicular to Y.P and the 
object is in front of the Y.P and above the H.P as shown in Fig.5.3a. 
5.2.2 Method of Obtaining Top View 
Looking from the top, the projection of the top surface is the Top view (Ty ). Both top surface and 
Top view are of exactly the same shape and size. Thus, Top view gives the True length L and 
breadth B of the block but not the height H.

Textbook of Enginnering Orawing--------------------
x Y Line: The line of intersection ofVP and H.P is called the reference line and is denoted as xy. 
Obtaining the Projectin on the Drawing Sheet 
It is convention to rotate the H.P through 900 in the clockwise direction about xy line so that it lies 
in the extension ofVP as shown in Fig. 5.3a. The two projections Front view and Top view may be 
drawn on the two dimensional drawing sheet as shown in Fig.5.3b. 
Thus, all details regarding the shape and size, Viz. Length (L), Height(H) and Breadth(B) of any 
object may be represented by means of orthographic projections i.e., Front view and Top view. 
Terms Used 
VP and H.P are called as Principal planes of projection or reference planes. They are always 
transparent and at right angles to each other. The projection on VP is designated as Front view 
and the projection on H.P as Top view. 
Four Quadrants 
When the planes of projections are extended beyond their line of intersection, they form Four 
Quadrants. These quadrants are numbered as I, II, ill and IV in clockwise direction when rotated 
about reference line xy as shown in Fig.5A and 5.6(a). 
Horizontal plane 
Fig. 5.4 Four Quadrants 
In the Figure 5.5 the object is in the first quadrant and the p;Qjections obtained are "First 
angle projections" Le., the object lies in between the observer and the planes of projection. Front 
view shows the length(L) and height(H) of the object, and Top view shows the length(L) and the 
breadth(B) of it.

Fig. 5.5 Orthographic Projection of Front, Top and Side views 
The object may be situated in anyone of four quadrants, its position relative to the planes being 
described as in front ofY.P and above H.P in the first quadrant and so on. 
Figure 5.5 shows the two principle planes H.P and v.p and another Auxiliary vertical plane 
(AVP). AVP is perpendicular to both VP and H.P. 
Front view is drawn by projecting the object on the v.P. Top view is drawn by projecting the 
object on the H.P. The projection on the AVP as seen from the left of the object and drawn on the 
right of the front view, is called left side view. 
5.3 First Angle Projection 
When the object is situated in First Quadrant, that is, in front ofV.P and above H.P, the projections 
obtained on these planes is called First angle projection. 
(i) The object lies in between the observer and the plane of projection. 
(li) The front view is drawn above the xy line and the top view below xy. (above xy line is v.p 
and below xy line is H.P). 
(iii) In the front view, H.P coincides with xy line and in top view v.p coincides with xy line. 
(iv) Front view shows the length(L) and height(H) of the object and Top view shows the length(L) 
and breadth(B) or width(W) or thicknes(T) of it. 
5.4 Third Angle Projection 
In this, the object is situated in Third Quadrant. The Planes ofporjection lie between the object 
and the observer. The front view comes below the xy line and the top view about it.

Designation and Relative Position of Views 
An object in space may be imagined as surrounded by six mutually perpendicular planes. So, it is 
possible to obtain six different views by viewing the object along the six directions, normal to the six 
planes. Fig.5.6 shows an object with the six possible directions to obtain the six different views 
which are designated as follows. 
1. View in the direction a = front view 
2. View in the direction b = top view 
3. View in the direction c = left side view 
4. View in the direction d = right side view 
5. View in the direction e = bottom view 
6. View in the direction f= rear view 
The relative position of the views in First angle projection are shown in Fig.5.7. 
Note: A study of the Figure 5.7 reveals that in both the methods of projection, the views are 
identical in shape and size but their location with respect to the front view only is different. 
5.5 Projecton of Points

consists of number of points:-'From this, it is obvious that a solid may be generated by a pl~

Fig. 5.8 
Points in Space 
A point may lie in space in anyone of the four quadrants. The positions of a point are: 
1. First quadrant, when it lies above H.P and in front ofV.P. 
2. Second quadrant, when it lies above HP and behind v.P. 
3. Third quadrant, when it lies below H.P and behind v.P. 
4. Fourth quadrant, when it lies below H.P and in front ofV.P. 

5.8 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing------------------
Knowing the distances of a point from H.P and V.P, projections on H.P and Y.P are found by 
extending the projections perpendicular to both the planes. Projection on H.P is called Top view 
and projection on Y.P is called Front view 
Notation followed 
1. Actual points in space are denoted by capital letters A, B, C. 
2. Their front views are denoted by their corresponding lower case letters with dashes ai, bl, d, 
etc., and their top views by the lower case letters a, b, c etc. 
3. Projectors are always drawn as continious thin lines. 
Note: 
1. Students are advised to make their own paper/card board/perplex model ofH.P and V.P as 
shown in Fig.5.4. The model will facilitate developing a good concept of the relative position 
of the points lying in any of the four quadrants. 
2. Since the projections of points, lines and planes are the basic chapters for the subsequent 
topics on solids viz, projection of solids, development, pictorial drawings and conversion of 
pictorial to orthographic and vice versa, the students should follow these basic chapters 
carefully to draw the projections.

_____________________ Orthographic Projections 
5.9 
2. Looking from the front, the point lies 40 mm above H.P. A-al is the projector perpendicular to 
V.P. Hence al is the front view .of the point A and it is 40 mm above the xy line. 
3. To obtain the top view of A, look from the top. Point A is 60mm in front ofV.P. Aa is the 
projector prependicular to H.P Hence, a is the top view of the point A and it is 60 mm in front 
ofxy. 
4. To convert the projections al and a obtained in the pictorial view into orthographic projections 
the following steps are needed. 
(a) Rotate the H.P about the xy line through 90° in the clock wise direction as shown. 
(b) After rotation, the fIrst quadrant is opened out and the H.P occupies the position verically 
below the V.P line. Also, the point a on H.P will trace a quadrant of a circle with 0 as 
centre and o-a as radius. Now a occupies the position just below o. The line joining al 
and a, called the projector, is perpendicular to xy (Fig.5.9b). 
5. To draw the orthographic projections. 
Note: 
(a) Front view : Draw the xy line an? draw ~ectior at any point on it. Mark al 40mm _" 
above xy on the projector.-
. 
(b) Top view: 
on the same projector, mark a 60 mm below xy. (Fig.5 .9c) 
1. xy line represents H.P in the front view and v.p in the top view. Therefore while drawing the 
front view on the drawing sheet, the squares or rectangles for individual planes are not 
necessary. 
2. Only the orthographic projections shown in FigA.9( c) is drawn as the solution and not the 
other two fIgures. 
Probl~m : Draw the projections of a point A lying on HP and 25mm in front of v.P. 
Solution: (Fig.5.10) 
1. Point A is lying on H.P and so its front view allies on xy line in Fig.5.1 Oa. Therefore, mark a 
line xy in the orthographic projeciton and mark on it a l (Fig.5.1 Ob). 
2. Point A is 25mm in front ofV.P and its top view a lies on H.P itself and in front of xy. 
3. Rotate the H.P through 90° in clock wise direction, the top view of the point a now comes 
vertically below al . 
4. In the orthograpl;tic projection a is 25 mm below xy on the projector drawn from al. 
~ Problem: Draw the projections of a point A lying on v.p and 70 mm above HP. 
Solution: (Fig.5.lI) 
1. Looking at the pictorial view from the front (Fig.5.11a) the point A is 70 mm above H.P and 
so a l is 70 mm above xy. Hence, mark a l the orthographic projection 70 mm above xy 
(Fig.5.11b).

2. Looking at the pictorial view from the top, point a is on V.P and its view lies on xy itself. The 
top view a does not lie on the H.P. So in this case the H.P need not be rotated. Therefore 
mark a on xy on the projector drawn from al . 
Problem : A Point B is 30 mm above HP and 40 mm behind v.p Draw its projection. 
Solution: (Fig.5.I2) The point B lies in the IT Quadrant 
1. It is 30 mm above H.P and bI is the front view ofB and is 30 mm above xy. 
2. Point B is 40 mm behind v.P. and b is the top view ofB which is 40 mm behind xy. 
3. To obtain the orthographic projections from the pictorial view rotate H.P by 90° about xy as 
shown in Fig.5.12a. Now the H.P coincides with v.p and both the front view and top view 
are now seen above xy. b on the H.P will trace a quadrant of a circle with 0 as centre and ob 
as radius. Now b occupies the position above o.

5.6 Projection of Lines 
The shortest distance between two points is called a straight line. The projectors of a straight line 
are drawn therefore by joining the projections of its end points. The possible projections of straight. 
lines with respect to V.P and H.P in the flrst quadrant are as follows: 
I. Perpendicular to one plane and parallel to the other. 
2. Parallel to both the planes. 
3. Parallel to one plane and inclined to the other. 
4. Inclined to both the planes. 
1. Line perpendicular to H.P and parallel to V.P 
The pictorial view of a stright line AB in the First Quadrant is shown in Fig.5 .16a. 
1. Looking from the front; the front view of AB, which is parallel to v.p and marked, albl, is 
obtained. True length of AB = al bl• 
2. Looking from the top; the top view of AB, which is perpendicular to H.P is obtained a and b 
coincide. 
3. The Position of the lineAB and its projections on H.P. and V.P are shown in Fig.5.l6b. 
4. The H.P is rotated through 900 in clock wise direction as shown in Fig.5.16b. 
5. The projection of the line on V.P which is the front view and the projection on H.P, the top 
view are shown in Fig.5.l6c.

3. To obtain the front view al bl; as AB is parallel to V.P and inclined at an angle a to H.P, albl

2. When a line is parallel to Y.P and inclined at an angle ofa to H.P, this inclination is seen in the 
front view and a indicates always the true inclination with H.P. Hence, front view is drawn 
fIrst to get the true length of the line.

1. Inclination of a line with V.P is always denoted by 4>. 
2. when a line is paralel to H.P and inclined at an angle of 4> to v.P, this inclination 4> is seen 
in the top view and hence top view is drawn fIrst to get the true length of the line. 
4. Line inclined to both the planes 
When a line is inclined to both H.P and V.P, it is called an oblique line. The solution to this kind of 
problem is obtained in three stages, as described below. 
Problem : To draw the projections of a line inclined at e to H.P and 4> to v.P, given the 
position of one of its ends. 
Construction (Fig.S.21). The position of the lineAB is shown in Fi&- 5.21a. 
Stage I Assume the line is inclined to H.P by eO and parallel to V.P. (Fig.5.21b) 
1. Draw the projections alb\ and ab1 of the line ABI(=AB), after locating projections and a 
from the given position of the end A. 
Keeping the inclination e constant rotate the line AB I to AB, till it is inclined at 4> 0 to v.P. 
This rotation does not change the length of the top view abl and the distance of the point 
BI =(B) from H.P. Hence, (i) the length of abl is the fmallength of the top view and (ii) the 
line f-f, parallel to xy and passing through bl
l is the locus of the front view of the end of point 
B. 
Stage llAssume the line is inclined to VP by 4> and parallel to H.P(Fig.5.21c) 
2. Draw the projections ab2 and ab of the line AB2(=AB), after locating the projections al and 
a, from the given position of the end A. 
Extending the discussion on the preceding stage to the present one, the following may be 
concluded. (i) The length ab is the fmallength of the front view and (ii) the line t-t, parallel to 
xy and pasing through b2 is the locus of the top view of the end point B. 
Stage ill Combine Stage I and Stage IT (Fig.5.21d), 
3. Obtain the fmal projections by combining the results from stage 1 and IT as indicated below: 
(i) Draw the projections al b\ and ab2 making an angle e and 4> respectively with xy, after 
location of the projections al and a, from the given position of the end point A. 
(iI) Obtain the projections alb2
1 and abl, parallel to xy, by rotation. 
(iii) Draw the lines f-f and t-t the loci parallel to xy and passing through bll and b2 respectively. 
(iv) With centre al and radius al b2
1, draw an arc meeting f-f at bl. 
- (v) With centre a and radius abl , draw an;arc meeting t-t at b. 
(vi) Join al,b', and a,b forming the required final projections. It is observed from the figure 4.21 c

5.7 ·Projection of Planes 
A plane figure has two dimensions viz. the length and breadth. It may be of any shape such as 
triangular, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, circular etc. The possible orientations of the planes with 
respect to the principa~ planes H.P and v.p ofprojection are: 

5.20 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing-----------------
1. Plane parallel to one of the principal planes and perpendincular to the other, 
2. Plane perpendicular to both the principal planes, 
3. Plane inclined to one of the principal planes and perpendclicular to the other, 
4. Plane inclined to both the principal planes. 
1. Plane parallel to one of the principal planes and perpendicular to the other 
When a plane is parallel to V.P the front view shows the true shape of the plane. The top view 
appears as a line parallel to xy. Figure 5.23a shows the projections ofa square planeABCD, when 
it is parallel to V.P and perpendicular to H.P. The distances of one of the edges above H.P and from 
the V.P are denoted by d1 and d2 respecively. 
Figure 5.23b shows the projections of the plane. Figure 5.23c shows the projections of the plane, 
when its edges are equally inclined to H.P. 
Figure 5.24 shows the projections of a circular plane, parallel to H.P and perpendicular to V.P.

TRACES 
Traces of a line 
When a line is inclined to a plane, it will meet that plane when produced if necessary. The point at 
which the line or line produced meets the plane is called its trace.

CHAPTER 6 
Projection of Solids 
6.1 
Introduction 
A solid has three dimensions, the length, breadth and thickness or height. A solid may be represented 
by orthographic views, the nuber of which depends on the type of solid and its orientation with 
respect to the planes of projection. solids are classified into two major groups. (i) Polyhedra, and 
(ii) Solids of revolution 
6.1:1 Polyhedra 
A polyhedra is defmed as a solid bounded by plane surfaces called faces. They are : 
(i) 
Regular polyhedra 
(ii) Prisms and (i~i) Pyramids. 
6.1.2 Regular Polyhedra 
A polyhedron is said to be regular if its surfaces are regular polygons. The following are some of 
the regular plolyhedra. 
I 
~-
(a) Tetrahedron 
(b) Hexahedron( cube) 
(c) Octahedron 
(d) Dodecahedron 
Fig. 6.1 

6.2 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing-------------------
(a) Tetrahedron: It consists of four equal faces, each one being a equilateral triangle. 
(b) . 'Hexa hedron(cube): It consists of six equal faces, each a square. 
(c) Octahedron: It thas eight equal faces, each an equilateral triangle. 
(d) 
Dodecahedron: It has twelve regular and equal pentagonal faces. 
(e) Icosahedron: It has twenty equal, equilateral triangular faces. 
6.2 
Prisms 
A prism is a polyhedron having two equal ends called the bases pralle I to each other. The two 
bases are joined by faces, which are rectangular in shape. The imaginary line passing through the 
centres of the bases is called the axis of the prism. 
A prism is named after the shape of its base. For example, a prism with square base is called a 
square prism, the one with a pentagonal base is called a pentagonal prism, and so on (Fig.6.2) The 
nomenclature of the prism is given in Fig.6.3.

Pyramids 
A pyramid is a polyhedron having one base, with a number of isosceles triangular faces, meeting at 
a point called the apex. The imaginary line passing through the centre of the base and the apex is 
called the axis of the pyramid. 
The pyromid is named after the shape of the base. Thus, a square pyramid has a square base 
and pentagonal pyramid has pentagonal base and so on (Fig.6.4( a)). The nomenclature of a pyramind 
is shown in Fig.6.4(b).

Solids of Revolution 
If a plane surface is revolved about one of its edges, the solid generated is called a solid of 
revolution. The examples are (i) Cylinder, (ii) Cone, (iii) Sphere. 
6.5 
Frustums and Truncated Solids 
If a cone or pyramid is cut by a section plane parallel to its base and the portion containing the apex 
or vertex IS rt:moved, the remaining portion is called frustum of a cone or pyramid

Prisms (problem) Position of a Solid with Respect to the Reference Planes 
The position of solid in space may be specified by the location of either the axis, base, edge, 
diagonal or face with the principal planes of projection. The following are the positions of a solid 
considered. 
1. Axis perpendicular to one of the principal planes. 
2. Axis parallel to both the principal planes. 
3. Axis inclined to one of the principal planes and parallel to the other. 
4. Axis inclined to both the principal planes. 
The position of solid with reference to the principal planes may also be grouped as follows: 
1. Solid r~g on its base. 

_______________________ Projection of Solids 
6.5 
2. Solid resting on anyone of its faces, edges of faces, edges of base, generators, slant 
edges, etc. 
3. Solid suspended freely from one of its comers, etc. 
1. Axis perpendicular to one of the principal planes 
When the axis ofa solid is perpendicular to one of the planes, it is parallel to the other. Also, 
the projection of the solid on that plane will show the true shape of the base. 
When the axis of a solid is perpendicular to H.P, the top view must be drawn fIrst and then 
the front view is projected from it. Similarly when the axis of the solid is perpendicular to 
V.P, the front view must be drawn fIrst and then the top view is projected from it. 
Problem : Draw the projections of a cube of 35mm side, resting on one of its faces 
(bases) on HP., such that one of its vertical faces is parallel to and 10mm in front of

4. Obtain the top view by projecting the above two views. 
Note: Rules to be observed while drawing the projections of solids. 
(i) If a solid has an edge of its base on H.P or parallel to H.P, that edge should be kept 
perpendicular to V.P. If the edge of the base is on V.P or parallel to V.P, that edge should 
be kept perpendicular to H.P. 
(n) If a solid has a comer of its base on H.P, the side of the base containing that comer 
should be kept equally inclined to v.P. If a solid has a comer of its base on V.P, the sides 
of the base containing that comer should be kept equally inclined to H.P. 
3. Axis inclined to one of the principal planes and parallel to the other. 
When the axis of a solid is inclined to any plane, the projections are obtained in two stages. 
In the first stage, the axis of the solid is assumed to be perpendicular to the plane to which 
it is actually inclined and the projections are drawn. In second stage, the position of one of 
the projections is altered to statisfy the given condition and the other view is projected from 
it. This method of obtaining the projections is known as the change of position method. 
Problem : A pentagonal prism with side of base 30mm and axis 60mm long is resting 
with an edge of its base on HP, such that the rectangular face containing that edge is 
inclined at 600 to HP. Draw the projections of the prism when its axis is parallel to 
v.P.

3. Obtain the fmal top view by projection. 
Note: For completing the fmal projections of the solids inclined to one or both the principal 
planes, the following rules and sequence may be observed. 
(i) 
Draw the edges of the visible base. The base is further away from xy in one view will 
be fully visible in the other view. 
(n) Draw the lines corresponding to the longer edges of the solid, keeping in mind that the 
lines passing through the visible base are invisible. 
(iiI) Draw the edges of the other base.

6.10 Auxiliary Projections 
The conventional orthographic views, viz, front, top and side views may not be sufficient always to 
provide complete information regarding the size and true shape of the object, especially when it 
contains surfaces inclined to the principal planes of projections. The true shape of an inclined 
surface can only be obtained by projecting it on to an imaginary plane which is parallel to it. This 
imaginary plane is called an auxiliary plane and the view obtained on it is called the auxiliary view. 
Fig 6.77 
Fig. 6.77 
In Fig. 6.77 the auxiliary view required is a view in the direction of the arrow Z. The top view is 
omitted for clarity. The object is in the first quadrant. The view in the direction of the arrow is 
obtained by projecting on to a plane at right angles to the arrow Z. This is a Vertical Plane 
containing the line xl-YI' The comers are projected on to the Auxiliary Vertical Plane (AVP) to 
obtain the auxiliary view as shown. Since the auxiliary plane is vertical, the edges AB, CD, GJ and; 
FK are vertical and will be of true lengths on the auxiliary view. All other lengths are inclined to the 
auxiliary plane. The auxiliary view thus obtained will not be of much use to see the true shape of the 
inclined plane. 
The advantage of auxiliary projections to see the true shape ofthe inclined surfaces is illustrated 
in Fig. 6.78(a).

Fig. 6.78 
As the auxiliary view only shows the true shape and de~ils ofthe inclined surface or feature, a 
partial auxiliary view pertaining to the inclined surface only is drawn. Drawing all other features 
lead to confusion of the shape discription. 
6.10 Types of Auxiliary Views 
Auxiliary views may be classified, based on the relation of the inclined surface of the object with 
respect to the principal planes ofprojections. 
Auxiliary Front new 
Figure 6.79 Shows the auxiliary front view of a cube, projected on an Auxiliary Vertical Plane 
(AVP), inclined to VP and perpendicular to HP. Here, the auxiliary front view is projected from the 
top view, and its height is same as the height of the front view. 
Auxiliary Top new 
Figure 6.80 shows the auxiliary top view of a cube, projected on an auxiliary vertical plane inclined 
to VP and perpendicular to H.P. The diagonal of the cube is vertical and its front view is given. The 
auxiliary top view is projected from the front view and its depth is the same as the depth of the top 
view. 
Primary and Secondary Auxiliary news: 
The auxiliary view obtained on either AIP or AVP is known as primary auxiliary view. The secondary 
auxiliary view is required to obtain the true shape of the surface when the surface of an object is 
inclined to both HP and VP.

CHAPTER 7 
Devlopment of Surfaces 
7.1 Introduction 
A layout of the complete surface of a three dimentional object on a plane is called the development 
of the surface or flat pattern of the object. The development of surfaces is very important in the 
fabrication of articles made of sheet metal. 
The objects such as containers, boxes, boilers, hoppers, vessels, funnels, trays etc., are made of 
sheet metal by using the principle of development of surfaces. 
In making the development of a surface, an opening of the surface should be determined fIrst. 
Every line used in making the development must represent the true length of the line (edge) on the 
object. 
The steps to be followed for making objects, using sheet metal are given below: 
1. Draw the orthographic views of the object to full size. 
2. Draw the development on a sheet of paper. 
3. Transfer the development to the sheet metal. 
4. Cut the development from the sheet. 
5. Form the shape of the object by bending. 
6. Join the closing edges. 
Note: In actual practice, allowances have to be given for extra material required for joints and 
bends. These allowances are not cosidered in the topics presented in this chapter. 
7.2 
Methods of Development 
The method to be followed for making the development of a solid depends upon the nature of its 
lateral surfaces. Based on the classillcation of solids, the folloiwing are the methods of development. 
1. Parallel-line Development 
It is used for developing prisms and single curved surfaces like cylinders in which all the edges / 
generators of lateral surfaces are parallel to each other. 
2. Radial-line Development 
It is employed for pyramids and single curved surfaces like cones in which the apex is taken as 
centre and the slant edge or generator (which are the true lengths)as radius for its development.

determine the true lehiter of the slant edge, say OA, rotate oa till it is parallel to xy to the 
position.oal. Through al ' draw a projector to meet the line xy at all' Then Oil all represents 
the true length of the slant edge OA. This method of determining the true length is also 
known as rotation method.

CHAPTER 8 
Intersection of Surfaces 
8.1 Introduction 
Ducts, pipe joints, smoke stacks, boilers, containers, machine castings etc., involve intersection of 
surfaces. Sheetmetal work required for the fabrication of the above objects necessiate the preparation 
of the development ofthejointsl objects. Orthographic drawings oflines and curves of intersection 
of surfaces must be prepared first for the accurate development of objects. Methods of obtaining 
the lines and curves of intersection of surfaces of cylinder and cylinder, prism and prism are shown 
to introduce the subject. Figure 8.1 Shows intersection of two cylinders. 
(a) 
(b) 
Fig. 8.1 
8.2 
Intersection of cylinder and cylinder 
Example 1: A horizontal cylinder of diameter 40 mm penetrates into a vertical cylinder of 
diameter 60 mm. The axes of the cylinders intersect at right angles. Draw the curves of 
intersection when the a'(is of the horizontal cvlinder is parallel to the VP. 
Solution: (Fig 8.2) 
1. Draw the top and front views of the cylinders. 
2. Draw the left side view of the arrangement. 
3. Divide the circle in the side view into number of equal parts say 12. 

8.2 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing------------------
4. The generators of the horizontal cylinder are numbered in both front and top views as shown. 
5. Mark point m, where the generator through 1 in the top view meets the circle in the top view 
of the vertical cylinder. Similarly mark m2,········ .mI2. 
6. Project m17 to m\ on the generator II II in the front view. 
7. Project m7 to m17 on 71
7, Similarly project all the point. 
8. Draw a smooth curve through m\ ....... mI7. 
This curve is the intersection curve at the front. The curve at the rear through m1
4, m1s--
-m1
12 coincides with the corresponding visible curve at the front. 
Since the horizontal cylinder penetrates and comes out at the other end, similar curve of 
intersection will be seen on the right also. 
9. Draw the curve through n\ ...... nl7 following the same procedure. The two curves m\-mI7 
and n\ -n\ are the required curves of intersection.

The procedure to be followed is the same as that in example above. The curves of intersection 
appear as straight lines in the front view as shown in the figure. The two straight lines are at right 
angles. 
Example 3: A vertical cylinder of diameter 120 mm is fully penetrated by a cylinder of 
diameter 90 mm, their axes intersecting each other. The axis of the penetrating cylinder is 
inclined at 300 to the HP and is parallel to the VP. Draw the top and front views of the 
cylinders and the curves of intersection. 
Construction: (Fig 8.4) 
1. Draw the top and front views of the cylinders. 
2. Following the procedure in example 1 locate points ml in the top view. Project them to the 
corresponding generators in the inclined cylinder in the front view to obtain points mIl' mlz 
etc. 
3. Locate points n\ ....... n\o etc., on the right side using the same construction. 
4. Draw smooth curves through them to get the required curve of intersection as shown in the 
figure.

Textbook of Enginnering Drawing-------------------

8.3 
Intersection of prism and prism 
When a prism penetrates another prism, plane surface of one prism intersects the plane surfaces of 
another prism and hence the lines of intersection will be straight lines. In these cases, lines on the 
surface of one of the solids need not necessarily be drawn as it is done with cylinders. Instead, the 
points of intersections of the edges with the surface are located by mere inspection. These points 
are projected in the other view and the lines of intersection obtained. 
Example 4: A square prism of base side 60 mm rests on one of its ends on the HP with the 
base sides equally inclined to the VP. It is penetrated fully by another square prism of base 
side 45 mm with the base side equally inclined to the HP. The axes intersect at right angles. 
The axis of the penetrating prism is parallel to both the HP and the VP. Draw the projections 
of the prisms and show the lines of intersection. 
Construction: (Fig 8.5) 
1. Draw the top and front view of the prisms in the given position. 
2. Locate the points of intersection of the penetrating prism with the surfaces of the vertical 
prism in the top view by inspection. Here, the edges 2-21' of the horizontal prism intersects 
the edge point of the vertical prism at m2 in the top view. n4 corresponds to the edge 4-41, 
and the immediately below m2, ml and ~ relate to I-II' and 3-3 1 respectively. 
3. Similarly locate points nl, Dz, ~andn4' 
4. Project ml onto II -III in the front view as mil' Similarly project all other points. ml3 coincides 
with m\ and nl3 coincides with n\. 
5. Join ml2 mil and m\ ml4 by straight lines. Join nl2 n\ and n\ nl4 also by straight lines.

CHAPTER 9 
Isometric Projection 
9.1 
Introduction 
Pictorial projections are used for presenting ideas which may be easily understood by persons 
even with out technical training and knowledge of multi-view drawing. The Pictorial drawing 
shows several faces of an object in one view, approximately as it appears to the eye. 
9.2 
Principle ofIsometric Projections 
It is a pictorial orthographic projection of an object in which a transparent cube containing the 
object is tilted until one of the solid diagonals of the cube becomes perpendicular to the vertical 
plane and the three axes are equally inclined to this vertical plane. 
Insometric projection of a cube in steps is shown in Fig.9.1. HereABCDEFGH is the isometric 
projection of the cube.

9.2 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing------------------
The front view of the cube, resting on one of its corners (G) is the isometric projection of the 
cube. The isometric projection of the cube is reproduced in Fig.9.2. 
Isometric Scale 
In the isometric projection of a cube shown in Fig.9.2, the top face ABeD is sloping away from the 
observer and hence the edges of the top face will appear fore-shortened. The true shape of the 
triangle DAB is represended by the triangle DPB. 
p 
Fig. 9.2 An isometric Cube 
The extent of reduction of an sometric line can be easily found by construction of a diagram 
called isometric scale. For this, reproduce the triangle DPA as shown in Fig.9.3. Mark the 
devisions of true length on DP. Through these divisions draw vertical lines to get the corresponding 
points on DA. The divisions of the line DA give dimensions to isometric scale.

9.3 
From the triangle ADO and PDO in Fig.9.2, the ratio of the isometric length to the true length, 
\ 
i.e., DAIDP = cos 45°/cos300 = 0.816 
The isometric axes are reduced in the ratio 1 :0.816 ie. 82% approximately. 
9.2.1 Lines in Isometric Projection 
The following are the relations between the lines in isometric projection which are evident from 
Fig.9.2. 
1. The lines that are parallel on the object are parallel in the isometric porjection. 
2. Vertical lines on the object appear vertical in the isometric projection. 
3. Horizontal lines on the object are drawn at an angle of 3 0° with the horizontal in the isometric 
projection. 
4. A line parallel to an isometric axis is called an isometric line and it is fore shortened to 82%. 
5. A line which is not parallel to any isometric axis is called non-isometric line and the extent of 
fore-shoretening of non-isometric lines are different if their inclinations with the vertical 
planes are different.

9.2.3 Isometric Drawing 
Drawing of objects are seldom drawn in true isometric projections, as the use of an isometric scale 
is inconvenient. Instead, a convenient method in whichtheforeshorten-ing oflengths is ignored and 
actual or true lengths are used to obtain the projections, called isometric drawing or isometric view 
is normally used. This is advantageous becausethe measurement may be made directly from a 
drawing. 
The isometric drawing offigure is slightly larger (approximaely 22%) than the isometric projection. 
As the proportions are the same, the increased size does not affect the pictorial value of the 
representation and at the same time, it may be done quickly. Figure 9.5 shows the difference 
between the isometric drawing and isometric projection.

Steps to be followed to make isometric drawing from orthographic views are given below 
(Fig. 9.6). 
1. Study the given views and note the principal dimensions and other features of the object. 
2. Draw the isometric axes (a). 
3. Mark the principal dimensions to-their true values along the isometric axes(b). 
4. Complete the housing block by drawing lines parallel to the isometric axes and passing 
through the above markings( e).

5. Locate the principal corners of all the features of the object on the three faces of the 
housing block( d).

9.2.4 Non-Isometric Lines 
In an isometric projection or drawing, the lines that are not parallel to the isometric axes are called 
non-isometric lines. These lines obviously do not appear in their true length on the drawing and can 
not be measured directtly. These lines are drawn in an isometric projection or drawing by locating 
their end points. 
Figure 9.7 shows the steps in constructing an isometric drawing of an object containing non-
isometric lines from the given orthographic views.

9.7 
9.3.1 Box Method (Fig. 9.8) 
When an object contains a number of non-isometric lines, the isometric drawing may be conveniently 
constructed by using the box method. In this method, the object is imagined to be enclosed in a 
rectrangular box and both isometric and non-isometric lines are located by their respective points 
of contact with the surfaces and edges of the box.

9.3.2 Off-set Method 
Off-set method of making an isometric drawing is preferred when the object contains irregular 
curved surfaces. In the off-set method, the curved feature may be obtained by plotting the points 
on the curve, located by the measurements along isometric lines. Figure 9.9 illustrates the application 
of this method.

CHAPTER 10 
Oblique and Perspective Projections 
10.1 Introduction 
Pictorial projections are used for presenting ideas which may be easily understood by all without 
technical training. They show several faces of an object in one view, as it appears to the eye 
approximately. Among the pictorial projections, Isometric Projections are the most common as 
explained in previous chapter. 
10.2 Oblique Projection 
Oblique Projection of an object may be obtained by projecting the object with parallel projections 
that are oblique to the picture plane (Fig 10.1) 
In oblique projection, the front face of the object appears in its true size and shape, as it is placed 
parallel to the picture plane. The receding lines representing the other two faces are usually drawn 
at 30°,45° or 60° to the horizontal, 45° being the most common practice. 
As in the case of isometric projection, in oblique projection also, all lines that are parallel on the 
object appear parallel on the drawing and vertical lines on the object appear vertical.

Textbook of Enginnering Orawing---------...--------
10.3 Classification of Oblique Projection 
Oblique projections are classified as cavalier, cabinet and general, depending on the scale of 
measurement followed along the receding lines, as shown in Fig 10.1. The oblique projection shown 
in Fig IO.la presents a distorted appearance to the eye. To reduce the amount of distortion and to 
have a more realistic appearance, the length of the receding lines are reduced as shown, either in 
Fig. IO.lb or as in Fig 10.lc. If the receding lines are measured to the true size, the projection is 
known as cavalier projection. If they are reduced to one half of their true lengths, the projection is 
called cabinet projection. In general oblique, the measurement along the receding lines vary from 
half to full size. 
\ 
Note: Oblique projection has the following advantages over isometric drawing: 
1. Circular or irregular features on the front face appear in their true shape. 
2. Distortion may be reduced by fore-shortening the mea')urement along the receding axis, and. 
3. A greater choice is permitted in the selection of the position of the axes. 
10.4 Methods of Drawing Oblique Projection 
The orthographic views of a V-block are shown in Fig. lO.2a The stages in obtaining the oblique 
projection of the same are shown in Fip;. lO.2b.

10.3 
1. After studying the views carefully, select the face that is either the most irregular one or the 
one with circular features if any. Make that face parallel to the picture plane to minimize 
distortion. 
2. Draw the face to its true size and shape 
3. Draw the receding lines through all the visible comers of the front face. 
4. Mark the length of the object along the receding lines andjoin these in the order. 
5. Add other features if any on the top and side faces. 
10.4.1 
Choice of Position of the Object 
For selecting the position of an object for drawing the oblique projection, the rules below are 
followed. 
1. Place the most irregular face or the one with circular features parallel to the picture plane. 
This, simplifies the construction and minimizes distortion. 
2. Place the longest face parallel to the picture plane. This results in a more realistic and 
pleasing appearance of the drawing (Fig. 10.3)

Poor 
Fig. 10.3 
10.4.2 
Angles, Circles and Curves in Oblique Projection 
As already mentioned, angles, circles and irregular curves on the surfaces, parallel to the picture 
plane, appear in true size and shape. However, When they are located on receding faces, the 
construction methods, similar to isometric drawing may be followed. 
For example, th e method of representing a circle on an oblique face may be carried out byoff-
set method and the four centre method cannot be used. In case of cabinet oblique, the method and 
the result is the same as that of isometric drawing, since the angle of the receding axis can be the 
same as that of isometric axis. Figure 10.4 shows circles of same size in both isometric and oblique 
projections using 45° for the receding axis for oblique projections. 
Curved features of all sorts on the receding faces or inclined surfaces may be plotted either by 
the off-set or co-ordinate methods as shown Fig 10.5 
Figuers 10.6 to 10.8 show some examples of oblique projections.

Fig. 10.8 
Perspective projection is a method of graphic representation of an object on a single plane called 
picture plane as seen by an observer stationed at a particular position relative to the object. As the 
object is placed behind the picture plane and the observer is stationed in front of the picture plane, 
visual rays from the eye of the observer to the object are cut by the picture plane. The visual rays 
locate the position of the object on the picture plane. This type of projection is called perspective 
projection. This is also known as scenographic projection or convergent projection. 
Method of preparing a perspective view differs from the various other methods of projections 
discussed earlier. Here, the projectors or visual rays intersect at a common point known as station 
point. A perspective projection of a street with posts holding lights, as viewed by an observer from 
a station point, is shown in Fig. 10.9. The observer sees the object through a transparent vertical 
plane called picture plane as shown in Fig.l 0.9(a). The view obtained on the l"cture plane is shown 

10.6 
Textbook of Enginnering Orawing-----------------
in Fig. 10.9(b). In this view, the true shape and size of the street will not be seen as the object is 
viewed from a station point to which the visual rays converge. This method of projection is 
theoretically very similar to the optical system in photography and is extensively employed by 
architects to show the appearance of a building or by artist-draftman in the preparation of illustrations 
of huge machinery or equipment.

Nomenclature of Perspective Projection 
The elements of perspective projection are shown in Fig. 10.10. The importantterms used in the 
perspective projections are defined below. 
1. Ground Plane (GP.): ~s is the plane on which the object is assumed to be placed. 
2. Auxiliary Ground Plane (A.GP): This is any plane parallel to the ground plane (Not shown in 
Fig. 10.10) 
3. Station Point (S.P.): This is the position of the observer's eye from where the object is 
viewed. 
4. Picture Plane (p.P.): This is the transparent vertical plane positioned in between the station 
point and the object to be viewed. Perspective view is formed on this vertical plane. 
5. Ground Line (GL.): This is the line of intersection of the picture plane with the ground plane. 
6. Auxiliary Ground Line (A.GL.): This is the line of intersection of the picture plane with the 
auxiliary ground plane. 
.

7. Horizon Plane (H.P.): This is the imaginary horizontal plane perpendicular to the picture 
plane and passing through the station point. This plane lies at the level of the observer. 
8. Horizon Line (H.L.): This is the line of intersection of the horizon plane with the picture 
plane. This plane is parallel to the ground line.

9. Axis of Vision (A.V.): This is the line drawn perpendicular to the picture plane and passing 
through the station point. The axis of vision is also called the line of sight or perpendicular 
axis. 
10. Centre ofVision (C. V.): This is the point through which the axis of vision pierces the picture 
plane. This is also the point of intersection of horizon line with the axis of vision. 
11. Central Plane (C.P.): This is the imaginary plane perpendicular to both the ground plane and 
the picture plane. It passes through the centre of vision and the station point while containing 
the axis of vision. 
12. Visual Rays (V.R.): These are imaginary lines or projectors joining the station point to the 
various points on the obje~t. These rays converge to a point.

Textbook of Enginnering Drawing-----------------
10.5.2 
Classification of perspective projections 
Perspective projections can be broadly classified into three categories. 
I. Parallel perspective or single point perspective. 
2. Angular perspective or two point perspective. 
3. Oblique perspective or three point perspective. 
These perspective projections are based on the relative positions of the object with respect to the 
picture plane. All the three types of perspectives are shown in Fig. 10.11. 
Parallel perspective or single point perspective 
If the principal face of the object viewed, is parallel to the picture plane, the perspective view 
formed is called parallel perspective. Such a perspective view is shown in Fig. 10.1 1 (a). In parallel 
perspective views, the horizontal lines receding the object converge to a single point called vanishing 
point (V.P.). But the vertical and horizontal lines on the principal face and the other faces of the 
object, do not converge, if these lines are parallel to the picture plane. Because the lines on the-
faces parallel to the picture plane do not converge to a point and the horizontal lines receding the 
object converge to a single vanishing point, the perspective projection obtained is called parallel or 
single pomt perspective. Single point perspective projection is generally used to present the interior 
details of a room, interior features of various components, etc. 
Angular perspective or two-point perspective 
If the two principal faces of the object viewed are inclined to the picture plane, the perspective 
view formed is called angular perspective. Such a perspective is shown in Fig. 1 0.11 (b). In angular 
perspective views, all the horizontal lines converge to two different points called vanishing point left 
(V.P.L.) and vanishing point right (V.P.R). But the vertical lines remain vertical. Because the two 
principal faces are inclined to picture plane and all the horizontal lines on the object converge to two 
different vanishing points, the perspective view obtained is called angular or two point perspective. 
Two point perspective projection is the most generally used to present the pictorial views oflong 
and wide objects like buildings, structures, machines, etc. 
Oblique perspective or three point perspective 
If all the three mutually perpendicular principal faces of the object viewed, are inclined to the 
picture plane, the perspective view formed is called oblique perspective. S~ch a perspective view 
is shown in Fig. 10.1I(c). In oblique perspective views, all the horizontal tines converge to two 
different points called vanishing point left (V.P.L.) and vanishing point right (V.P.R) and all the 
vertical lines converge to a third vanishing point located either above or below th.e horizon line. 
Because all the three principal faces are inclined to the picture plane and all the hontcntal and the 
vertical lines on the object converge to three different vanishing points, the perspective view obtained 
is called oblique or three point perspective.

Fig. 10.11 Classification of perspective projections 
Three point perspective projection may be used to draw pictorial views of huge and tall objects 
like tall buildings, towers, structures, etc. If the station point is near by the ground plane, the vertical 
lines will vanish at a point above the horizon line. If the station point is located above the object, all 
the vertical lines will vanish at a point below the horizon line. Oblique perspective projection is 
seldom used in practice.

Methods of Perspective Projection 
VISUal Ray Method 
In this method, points on the perspective projection are obtained by drawing visual rays from SP to 
both top view and either front view or side view of the object. Top and side views are drawn in 
Third Angle Projection. 
Perspective projection of a line is drawn by first marking the perspective projection of its ends 
(which are points) and then joining them. Perspective projection of a solid is drawn by first obtaining 
the perspective projection of each comer and thenjoining them in correct sequence. 
Vanishing Point Method 
Vanishing Point: It is an imaginary point infinite distance away from the station point. The point at 
which the visual ray from the eye to that infinitely distant vanishing point pierces the picture plane 
is termed as the Vanishing Point. 
When the observer views an object, all its parallel edges converge to one/two/tbree points 
depending on the.1ocations of the object and the observer.

CHAPTER 11 
Conversion of Isometric Viewl to 
Orthographic Views and Vice Versa 
11.1 Introduction 
The following principles of orthographic views are considered in making the above drawings: 
1. In first angle projection; the Front view on the above and the Top view at the bottom are 
always in line vertically. 
2. The front view and the side view are always in line horizontally. 
3. Each view gives two dimensions; usually the front view gives lengh and height, top view 
gives le~gth and width and side view gives hight and width. 
4. When the surface is parallel to a plane its projection on that plane will show its true shape 
and size. 
S. When the surface is inclined its projection will be foreshortened as shown.(Fig.ll.l)

Textbook of Enginnering Drawing-------------------
2. While selecting the views; the object is placed in such a way the number of hidden lines are 
kept to minimum. 
3. Front view is drawn seeing the object in a direction is which its length is seen. It is also 
chosen such that the shape of the object is revealed. The direction of the view is indicated 
by arrows.

CHAPTER 12 
12.1 Sectioning of solids 
12.1.1 
Introduction 
Sections of Solids 
Sections and sectional views are used to show hidden detail more clearly. They-are created by 
using a cutting plane to cut the object. 
A section is a view of no thickness and shows the outline of the object at the cutting plane. 
Visible outlines beyond the cutting plane are not drawn. 
A sectional view, displays the outline of the cutting plane and all visible outlines which can be 
seen beyond the cutting plane. 
Improve visualization of interior features. Section views are used when important hidden details 
are in the interior of an object. These details appear as hidden lines in one of the orthographic 
principal views; therefore, their shapes are not very well described by pure orthographic projection. 
12.1.2 
Types of Section Views 
• Full sections 
• Half sections 
• Offset sections 
• Revolved sections 
• Removed sections 
• Broken-out sections 
12.1.3 
Cutting Plane 
• Section views show how an object would look if a cutting plane (or saw) cut through the 
object and the material in front of the cutting plane was discarded 
Representation of cutting plane 
According to drawing standards cutting plane is represented by chain line with alternate long dash 
and dot. The two ends of the line should be thick. 
Full Section View 
• In a full section view, the cutting plane cuts across the entire object 
• Note that hidden lines become visible in a section view 
Hatching 
On sections and sectional views solid area should be hatched to indicate this fact. Hatching is 
drawn with a thin continuous line, equally spaced (preferably about 4mm apart, though never less 
than Imm) and preferably at an angle of 4S degrees. 

12.2 
Textbook of Enginnering Drawing----------------___ _ 
(i) 
Hatching a single object 
When you are hatching an object, but the objects has areas that are separated. all areas of 
the object should be hatched in the same direction and with the same spacing. 
(ii) Hatching Adjacent objects 
When hatching assembled parts, the direction of the hatching should ideally be reversed on 
adjacent parts. If more than two parts are adjacent, then the hatching should be staggered 
to emphasise the fact that these parts are separate.

Freehand Sketching 
13.1 Introduction 
Freehand sketching is one of the effective methods to communicate ideas irrespective of the 
branch of study. The basic principles of drawing used in freehand sketching are similar to those 
used in drawings made with instruments. The sketches are self explanatory in making them in the 
sequence shown (Fig. 13.1 to 13.14).

CHAPTER 14 
14.1 Introduction 
Computer Aided Design and 
Drawing {CAD D) 
In previous chapters we dealt with traditional drawings in which we use essentially drawing board 
tools such as paper, pencils, drafter, compasses, eraser, scale etc., which will take more time and 
tough in complex drawings. The most drawback with traditional drawing is lNFORMA TION 
SHARING i.e. if an engineer is drawing design of machine component and suddenly the 
manufacturer to modifies dimension of innermost part of the component; in such situations one 
cannot modifY the drawing already drawn, he should redraw the component. 
CADD is an electronic tool that enables us to make quick and accurate drawings with the use 
of a computer. Drawings created with CADD have a number of advantages over drawings created 
on a drawing board. CADD drawings are neat, clean and highly presentable. Electronic drawings 
can be modified quite easily and can be presented in a variety of formats. There are hundreds of 
CADD programs available in the CADD industry today. Some are intended for general drawing 
work while others are focused on specific engineering applications. There are programs that 
enable you to do 2D drawings, 3D drawings, renderings, shadings, engineering calculations, space 
planning, structural design, piping layouts, plant design, project management, etc. 
Examples of CAD software 
- AutoCAD, PROlEngineer, IDEAS, UNIGRAPHICS, CATIA, Solid Works, etc. 
14.2 History of CAD 
In 1883 Charles Barbage developed idea for computer. First CAD demonstration is given by Ivan 
Sutherland (1963). A year later ruM produced the first commercial CAD system. Many changes 
have taken place since then, with the advancement of powerful computers, it is now possible to do 
all the designs using CAD including two-dimensional drawings, solid modeling, complex engineering 
analysis, production and manufacturing. New technologies are constantly invented which make 
this process quicker, more versatile and more Powerful. 
14.3 Advantages of CAD 
(i) Detail drawings may be created more quickly and making changes is more efficient than 
correcting drawings drawn manually.

(ii) It allows different views of the same object and 3D pictorial view, which gives better 
visualization of drawings 
(iii) Designs and symbols can be stored for easy recall and reuse. 
(iv) By using the computer, the drawing can be produced with more accuracy. 
(v) Drawings can be more conveniently filed, retrieved and transmitted on disks and tape. 
(vi) Quick Design Analysis, also Simulation and Testing Possible.

14.5 The Coordinate System 
The coordinate system is another method of locating points in the drawing area. It enables us to 
locate points by specifying distances from a fixed reference point. One can locate a point by giving 
its distance in the horizontal direction, vertical direction, measuring along an angle, etc. 
The coordinate system is available when a function requires data input in the form of point 
locations. You may use it while drawing, editing or any time you need to locate a point. The most 
common coordinate systems are as follows: 
• Cartesian coordinates 
• Polar coordinates 
14.5.1 
Cartesian Coordinates 
Cartesian coordinates is a rectangular system of measurement that enables you to locate points 
with the help of horizontal and vertical coordinates. The. horizontal values, called X-coordinates, are 
measured along the X-axis. The vertical values, called V-coordinates, are measured along the Y-
axis. The intersection of the X- and Y-axes is called the origin point, which represents the 0,0 
location of the coordinate system. 
The positive X values are measured to the right and the positive Y values are measured above 
the origin point. The negative X and Y values are measured to the left and below. To enter a 
coordinate, you need to enter both the X and Y values separated by a comma (X, V). 
(-X, +Y) 
IN THIS EXAMPLE. EACH 'TICK' 
REPRESENTS ONE DRAWING UNIT. 
(-10, -5)--_\ 
(-X, -V) 
+Y 
-Y 
Fig. 14.5 
14.5.2 
Polar Coordinates 
(+X. +Y) 
- (9, 6) 
'- ORIGIN (0. 0) 
(+X, -V) 
Polar coordinates allow you to defme a point by specifying the distance and the direction from a 
given point. This mode of measurement is quite helpful in working with angles. To draw a line at an 
angle, you need to specify how long a line you want to draw and specify the angle. 

14.6 
Textbook of Engineering Drawing _________________ _ 
14.6 The Formats to Enter Coordinates 
Cartesian or polar coordinate values can be entered in two formats: 
• Absolute 
• 
Re lative 
Absolute format is a way of measuring distances from a fIxed reference location (origin point), 
which is the 0,0 location of the coordinate system. Consider this point to be stationary at all times. 
In some CADD programs this point remains visible at the left bottom corner of the drawing area, 
while in others it is invisible. 
You can use this point as a reference to measure any distance in the drawing. Absolute coordinates 
are primarily used to adjust the alignment of diagrams in a drawing, to align one drawing with 
another or to make plotting adjustments. 
Relative format is a way of measuring distances from the last point entered. All measurements 
are taken the same way as the absolute coordinates, with the only difference being that the relative 
coordinates are measured from the last point entered instead of the origin point. When a point is 
entered, it becomes the reference for entering the next point and so on. This mode of measurement 
is frequently used for drawing because it is always convenient to place the drawing components 
relative to each other rather than a fIxed reference point. 
Examples 
Cartesian Coordinates 
• Sounds like math, and it is exactly the same as in math 
• Input as either Absolute or Relative Coordinates 
-
Absolute X; Y 
-
Relative @K, Y 
Polar Coordinates ( Vector Coordinates) 
• Used to input a distance and the direction angle 
• Format: @Distance<Angle 
14.6.1 
User-Defmed Coordinate System 
CADD allows you to create a user-defmed coordinate system that can help simplify drawing. 
When you need to work with a complex drawing that has many odd angles this mode of measurement 
is very useful. 
Let.s say you need to draw or modify an odd-shaped diagra 'n, it is very difficult to use Cartesian 
or polar coordinates because they would involve extensive calculations. In this case, you can create 
a cuslom coordinate system that aligns with the odd angles l ,. the diagram. 
To defme a new coordinate system, you need to specify where you want the origin point and the 
direction of the X and Y-axis. The computer keeps working according to this customized coordinate 
system unless you set it back to normal 

Computer Aided Design and Drawing (CADD) 
14.7 
The user-defined coordinate system is especially helpful when you are working with 3D. In a 
3D drawing, you need to define each point with three coordinates and work with various surfaces 
of a 3D model. The user-defined coordinate system allows you to align coordinates with a specific 
surface. 
NOTE: At the bottom left of the AutoCAD is the coordinate display. 
Move your cursor around the drawing area and watch the coordinate change

14.10 TheDrawingToolsofCADD 
The following are the basic drawing tools found in a CADD program: 
• Line types 
• Multiple parallel lines 
• Flexible curves 
• Arcs and circles 
• Ellipses and elliptical arcs 
• Text 
• Dimensions 
• Hatch patterns 
• Polygons 
• Arrows 
14.10.1 Using Line Types 
There are a number of line types available in CADD that can be used to enhance drawings. There 
are continuous lines, dotted lines, center lines, construction lines, etc. CADD enables you to follow 
both geometrical and engineering drawing standards. You can use line types to represent different 
annotations in a drawing. For example, an engineer can use line types to differentiate between 
engineering services in a building plan. One line type can be used to show power supply lines, while 
the others to show telephone lines, water supply lines and plumbing lines. 
The drawing tools 
3-3 
CADD is preset to draw continuous lines. When you enter the line command and indicate a starting 
point and end point, a continuous line is drawn. If you want to draw with another line type, you need 
to set that line type as the current line type. Thereafter, all the lines are drawn with the newly 
selected line type. 

______________ Computer Aided Design and Drawing (CADD) 
14.21 
14.10.2 Drawing Multiple Parallel Lines 
CADD allows you draw parallel lines simultaneously just by indicating a starting point and an end 
point. These lines can be used to draw something with heavy lines or double lines. For example, 
they can be used to draw the walls of a building plan, roads of a site map, or for any other presentation 
that requires parallel lines. 
Most programs allow you to define a style for multiple parallel lines. You can specify how many 
parallel lines you need, at what distance and if they are to be filled with a pattern or solid fill. A 
number of add-on programs use multiple lines to represent specific drawing features. For example, 
an architectural program has a special function called '"wall'. When you use this option, it automatically 
draws parallel lines representing walls of specified style and thickness. 
Note: 
Multiple lines are a unified entity. Even though double lines are drawn, they are treated as one line. 
You cannot erase or edit one line separately. However, there are functions available that can break 
the entities apart. 
14.10.3 Drawing Flexible Curves 
CADD allows you to draw flexible curves (often called splines) that can be used to draw almost 
any shape. They can be used to create the smooth curves of a sculpture, contours of a landscape 
plan or roads and boundaries of a map. To draw a flexible curve, you need to indicate the points 
through which the curve will pass. A uniform curve is drawn passing through the indicated points. 
The sharpness ofthe curve.i, the roughness of the lines and the thickness can be controlled through 
the use of related commands. 
Drawing Arcs and Circles 
CADD provides many ways to draw arcs and circles. There are a number of advanced techniques 
available for drawing arcs and circles, which can simplify many geometrical drawing problems. 
You can draw an arc by specifying circumference and radius, radius and rotation angle, chord 
length and radius, etc. 
Arcs are drawn so accurately that a number of engineering problems can be solved graphically 
rather than mathematically. Suppose you need to measure the circumference of an arc, just select 
that arc and the exact value is displayed. 
The following are basic methods for drawing arcs and circles: 
(These are essentially the same methods you learn in a geometry class. 
However, when drawing with CADD the approach is a little different.) 
• Center point and radius 
• 3 points 
• Angle and radius 

14.22 
Textbook of Engineering Drawing ______ ---' ___________ _ 
• 2 points 
• 2 tangents and a point 
• 3 tangents 
14.10.4 Drawing Ellipses and Elliptical Arcs 
Ellipses are much easier to draw with CADD than on a drawing board. On a drawing board, you 
need to find the right size template or draw a series of arcs individually to draw an ellipse. With 
CADD, all you need to do is specify the size of the ellipse. 
The following are two basic methods for drawing ellipses: 
• Length and width 
• Axis and rotation angle 
Note: The above topics are illustrated with Figs. in CADD PRIMER. 
Adding Text to Drawings 
CADD allows you to add fine lettering to your drawings. You can use text to \\ rite notes. 
specifications and to describe the components of a drawing. Text created with CADD is neat, 
stylish and can be easily edited. Typing skills are helpful if you intend to write a lot of text. 
Writing text with CADD is as simple as typing it on the keyboard. You can locate it anywhere 
on the drawing, write it as big or as small as you like and choose from "- number of available fonts. 
Note: 
The drawing tools 
3-5 
When large amounts of text are added to drawings, it slows down the screen displays. Many 
programs provide options to temporarily tum off text or to display text outlines only. This feature 
helps save computer memory and speeds up the display of screen images. The text can be turned 
back on whenever needed. 
The following are the basic factors that control the appearance of text: 
(The exact terms and procedures used vary from one program to another.) 
• Text height 
• Height to width ratio and inclination ofle~ers 
• Special effects 
• Alignment of text Gustification) 
• Text fonts 
Note: The above topics are illustrated with Figs. in CADD PRIMER. 

_______________ Computer Aided Design and Drawing (CADD) 
14.23 
Defining a Text Style 
As discussed, there are a number offactors that control the appearance oftext. It is time-consuming 
to specify every parameter each time you need to write text. CADD allows you to define text 
styles that contain all the text information such as size, justification and font. When you need to 
write text, simply select a particular style and all the text thereafter is written with that style. 
CADD offers a number of ready-made text styles as well. 
Important Tip 
There are a number of add-on programs available that can make working with text faster and 
easier. These programs provide basic word-processing capabilities that can be used to write reports 
and make charts. They provide access to a dictionary and thesaurus database that can be used to 
check spelling and to search for alternative words. 
Drawing Dimensions 
CADD's dimensioning functions provide a fast and accurate means for drawing dimensions. To 
draw a dimension, all you need to do is to indicate the points that need to be dimensioned. CADD 
automatically calculates the dimension value and draws all the necessary annotations. 
The annotations that form a dimension are: dimension line, dimension text, dimension terminators 
and extension lines (see fig.). You can control the appearance of each of these elements by changing 
the dimensioning defaults. 
The following are the common methods for drawing dimensions: 
• Drawing horizontal and vertical dimensions 
• Dimensioning from a bas~ line 
• Dimensioning arcs and circles 
CADD PRIMER: http://www.caddprimer.com 
3-6 
• Drawing dimensions parallel to an object 
• Dimensioning angles 
Note: The above topics are illustrated with Figs. in CADD PRIMER. 
Adding Hatch Patterns to Drawings 
The look of CADD drawings can be enhanced with the hatch patterns available in CADD. The 
patterns can be used to emphasize portions of the drawing and to represent various materials, 
finishes, and spaces. Several ready-made patterns are available in CADD that can be instantly 
added to drawings. 
Hatch patterns are quite easy to draw. You don't need to draw each element of a pattern one 
by one. You just need to specify an area where the pattern is to be drawn by selecting all the 

14.24 
Textbook of Engineering Drawing ___________________ _ 
drawing objects that surround the area. The selected objects must enclose the area completely, like 
a closed polygon. When the area is enclosed, a list of available patterns is displayed. Select a 
pattern, and the specified area is filled. (Illustrated with Fig. In CADD PRIMER) 
Drawing Symbols 
Symbols provide a co'nvenient way to draw geometrical shapes. You may compare this function 
with the mUlti-purpose templates commonly used on a drawing board. To draw a geometrical 
shape, such as a pentagon or hexagon, select an appropriate symbol from the menu, specifY the 
size of the symbol, and it is drawn at the indicated point. (Illustrated with Fig. In CADD PRIMER) 
Drawing Arrows 
Arrows (or pointers) in a drawing are commonly used to indicate which note or specification 
relates to which portion of the drawing, or to specifY a direction for any reason. There are several 
arrow styles available in CADD programs. You can choose from simple two-point arrows to 
arrows passing through a number of points, and from simple to fancy arrow styles. To draw an 
arrow, you need to indicate the points through which the arrow will pass. (Illustrated with Fig) 
The Command Line Box 
• There are two basic ways to input a command: 
-
The command line 
-
Clicking on a command icon. The command icons will execute the appropriate text 
based command on the command line 
• Additionally some commands have a keyboard shortcut option that normally involves the 
"cntrI" or "ait" keys on the keyboard 
• The command line box size can be changed to show more or fewer command lines

Using the Help function 
• AutoCAD has a good command reference in it's help function. 
• This presentation will not duplicate that reference. You should frequently refer to the command 
reference as you learn the various commands. 
• Some practical pointers are added here that may not be easily encountered in the command 
reference. 
Drawing Lines 
• Either type "line" on the command line or click on the line icon in the draw toolbar. 
• Lines can be drawn by point and click. 
-
Can keep an eye on the coordinates display to make sure that you get what you want. 
• Lines can be specified by their end point coordinates. 
-
Type in the coordinates on the command line 
• Lines can be specified by their first point coordinates, then by an distance and angle. 
-
Select starting point, type in "@distance<angle" 
-
Example: @5<45 would go 5 units at a 45 degree anglt: 
• Click the line icon (or enter "line" on the command line) 
• Draw a horizontal line whose left end coordinate is 0,.5 and is 5 inches long. 
• Continue the line so that the second segment is starts at the end of the first line and goes 
vertically up 1.5 inches 
The Copy Command 
• The copy command is used to make a single duplicate of an entity or group of entities. 
• Click on copy icon in the modify menu and follow the instructions on the command line. 
• Note that copy offsets may be independent ofthe actual line 
Selecting Objects 
• AutoCAD has several ways to select objects. 
-
Click on each ~bject that you want to select. 
-
Make a window that encloses all the objects that you want to select. 
• Click on the lower or upper LEFT corner of desired window area 
• Click on the opposite corner of the window area 
-
Make a boundary that selects every thing that is within the boundary and that CROSSES 
the boundary. 
• Click on the lower or upper RIGHT corner of desired window area 
• Click on the opposite corner ofthewindow area
