Introduction 
One of the well-known prospects of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is the isogeny 
of supersingular elliptic curves with as many subgroups of their points as possible. The 
discrete logarithm problem (DLP) of classical elliptic cryptography is replaced by the 
problem of finding one of the isogenies of a large number of subgroups of such a 
noncyclic curve, which is sufficiently resistant to the attacks of a virtual quantum 
computer. To date, the growing interest in isogenies is associated with the shortest key 
length in the proposed algorithms in comparison with other known candidates for PQC 
at a given level of security [1]. 
Sect. 2 provides a brief review of the literature on this topic. Sect. 3 of the article 
gives the basic definitions of isomorphic curves in Montgomery and Edwards forms, 
the laws of the point’s addition, and doubling with a modification adapted to the 
horizontal symmetry of inverse points. A brief overview of the properties of three 
classes of generalized Edwards form curves following the classification is given. Sect. 4 
summarizes the results of one of the methods for obtaining 2-isogeny for two classes 
of complete and quadratic Edwards curves [3] to the class of twisted Edwards curves, 
analyzes the existence conditions for the 2-isogeny in three classes of Edwards curves 
over a prime field, and includes examples.

Review of the Literature 
The properties of isogenies for Weierstrass curves are well studied. Effective methods 
for constructing and isogenies properties of promising classes of curves in the Edwards 
form are much less known. The Edwards curves with one parameter, defined in [2], 
have very attractive advantages for cryptography: fastest exponentiation of a point [2], 
completeness and universality of the law of point’s addition, affine coordinates of a 
neutral element of a points group, enhanced security against side-channel attacks [2–
4]. 3- and 5-isogenies are considered in previous works [5] and [6]. 
The programming of group operations is accelerated due to the absence of a singular 
point at infinity as a neutral element of an Abelian group of points. The introduction of 
the second curve parameter in [7] extended the class of curves in the Edwards form and 
gave rise to classes of quadratic and twisted curves with new properties of interest to 
cryptographic applications. In this paper, the known results for the 2-isogeny of 
complete and quadratic Edwards curves [3, 8] are generalized to the class of twisted 
Edwards curves [9, 10]. In particular, an analysis of the existing conditions of such 
curves over a prime field is given.

Isomorphism and Properties of Classes of Generalized 
Edwards Form Curves 
The analysis of isogenies of Edwards curves is often based on Weierstrass and their 
special cases of isomorphic curves in Montgomery or Legendre form. Let’s describe 
the curve of the Montgomery form over the field 𝐹𝑞, 𝑞= 𝑝𝑚 by the equation [7] 
 𝑀𝐶,𝐷: 𝐷𝜈2 = 𝑢3 + 𝐶𝑢2 + 𝑢, 𝐶= 2
𝑎+𝑑
𝑎−𝑑, 𝐷=
4
𝑎−𝑑, 𝑎=
𝐶+2
𝐷, 𝑑=
𝐶−2
𝐷, 𝐶2 ≠4. 
(1) 
This curve is by a rational transformation of coordinates 
 
𝑦=
𝑢
𝜈, 𝑥=
𝑢−1
𝑢+1 ⟹𝑢=
1+𝑥
1−𝑥, 𝜈=
𝑢
𝜈 
(2) 
is mapped into a birationally equivalent in the generalized Edwards form curve of 
[7, 10] with the equation 
 
𝐸𝑎,𝑑: 𝑥2 + 𝑎𝑦2 = 1 + 𝑑𝑥2𝑦2, 𝑎, 𝑑∈𝐹𝑝
∗, 𝑑≠1, 𝑎≠𝑑, 𝑝≠2. 
(3) 
Unlike the original equation of this curve in [7] here we multiply the parameter 𝑎 by 
𝑦2 instead of 𝑥2. If the quadratic character 𝜒(𝑎𝑑) = −1, the curve (3) is isomorphic to 
the complete Edwards curve [2] 𝐸1,𝑑= 𝐸𝑑 with one parameter d 
 
𝐸𝑑: 𝑥2 + 𝑦2 = 1 + 𝑑𝑥2𝑦2, 𝜒(𝑑) = −1, 𝑑≠0,1. 
(4) 
In the case of 𝜒(𝑎𝑑) = 1 and 𝜒(𝑎) = 𝜒(𝑑) = 1 the curve (1) is isomorphic with the 
quadratic Edwards curve [10] 

3 
 
 
𝐸𝑑: 𝑥2 + 𝑦2 = 1 + 𝑑𝑥2𝑦2, 𝜒(𝑑) = 1, 𝑑≠0,1 
(5) 
having, in contrast to (4), the parameter d defined as a square. This difference leads to 
radically different properties of curves (4) and (5) [10], which are summarized below. 
Despite this, in the pioneering work [7], these classes of curves are united by the general 
term “Edwards curves.” 
In [10], we proposed to swap the coordinates X and Y in the form of an Edwards 
curve. Then the modified universal law of addition of points has the form 
 
(𝑥1, 𝑦1) + (𝑥2, 𝑦2) = (
𝑥1𝑥2−𝑎𝑦1𝑦2
1−𝑑𝑥1𝑥2𝑦1𝑦2 ,
𝑥1𝑦2+𝑥2𝑦1
1+𝑑𝑥1𝑥2𝑦1𝑦2). 
(6) 
If two points coincide, we obtain from (6) the law of points doubling 
 
2(𝑥1, 𝑦1) = (
𝑥12−𝑎𝑦12
1−𝑑𝑥12𝑦12 ,
2𝑥1𝑦1
1+𝑑𝑥12𝑦12). 
(7) 
The use of modified laws (6), (7) allows us to preserve the generally accepted horizontal 
symmetry (relative to the axis X) of the inverse points. 
Let’s define now the inverse point as −𝑃1 = (𝑥1, −𝑦1) we will acquire according to 
(6) the coordinates of the neutral element of the group of points 𝑂= (𝑥1, 𝑦1) +
(𝑥1, −𝑦1) = (1,0). Except for the neutral element О on the axis x, there is also the point 
of the second order, for which by (7) 2𝐷0 = (1,0) = 𝑂. Depending on the properties 
of the parameters a and d we can get also two singular points of the 2nd order and two 
singular points of the 4th order. 
As follows from (3), the axis Y can also contain non-singular points  
±𝐹0 = (0, ± 1
√𝑎
⁄
) of the 4th order, for which ±2𝐹0 = 𝐷0 = (−1,0). These points 
exist over the primary field 𝐹𝑝 if the parameter 𝑎 is a square (quadratic residue). The 
law of points addition (6) of the curve (3), in contrast to the original, retains the 
definition of the degree of isogeny adapted to curves in the Weierstrass form. In 
addition to the above, points of the 4th order can exist as non-singular for nonzero 
coordinates x and y [10]. The order of the Edwards curve is 𝑁𝐸= 2𝑚∙𝑛, 𝑚≥2, 𝑛 is 
odd. 
Justification of the new classification of generalized Edwards form curves is given 
in papers [10, 11]. Below are definitions of three classes of these curves and a list of 
fundamental properties of curves of different classes. 
Depending on the properties of the parameters a and d, generalized Edwards form 
curves (3) are divided into 3 non-intersecting classes: 
• Complete Edwards curves with the condition C1: 𝜒(𝑎𝑑) = −1. 
• Twisted Edwards curves with the condition C2.1: 𝜒(𝑎) = 𝜒(𝑑) = −1. 
• Quadratic Edwards curves with the condition C2.2: 𝜒(𝑎) = 𝜒(𝑑) = 1. 
The main properties of these classes of curves [8–10]: 
1. For points of the second order, the first class of complete Edwards curves over a 
prime field is the class of cyclic curves, while twisted and quadratic Edwards curves 
form classes of non-cyclic curves. The maximum order of points of curves of the last 2 
classes does not exceed 𝑁𝐸2
⁄ . 

4 
2. The class of complete Edwards curves does not contain singular points. The order 
of these curves is 𝑁𝐸≡4mod8 or 𝑁𝐸≡0mod8. 
3. The twisted Edwards curves contain only two singular points of the 2nd order 
𝐷1,2 = (±√
𝑎
𝑑; ∞). The order of these curves is 𝑁𝐸≡4mod8 or 𝑁𝐸≡0mod8. 
4. Quadratic Edwards curves contain two singular points of the 2nd order 𝐷1,2 =
(±√
𝑎
𝑑; ∞) and two singular points of the 4th order ±𝐹1 = (∞; ±
1
√𝑑). The order of these 
curves is 𝑁𝐸≡0mod8. 
5. Twisted and quadratic Edwards curves form pairs of quadratic torsion based on 
the transformation of parameters: 𝑎̃ = 𝑐𝑎, 𝑑̃ = 𝑐𝑑, 𝜒(𝑐) = −1. 
6. In the classes of twisted and quadratic Edwards curves, the replacement 𝑎↔𝑑 
gives the isomorphism 𝐸𝑎,𝑑~𝐸𝑑,𝑎. 
7. Complete and quadratic Edwards curves are isomorphic to curves with parameter 
𝑎= 1: 𝐸𝑎,𝑑~𝐸1,𝑑/𝑎. The introduction of the parameter into the equation of curve (3) is 
justified only for the class of twisted Edwards curves. 
8. Twisted Edwards curves under 𝑝≡1mod4 do not have the points of the 4th order 
and have the order 𝑁𝐸= 4𝑛, 𝑛 is odd. 
9. For points of odd order, the law of addition of points (6) is always complete (i. e., 
the sum of any pair of points does not give a singular point). 
4 
2-Isogeny for the Classes of Complete, Quadratic, 
and Twisted Edwards Curves 
The isogeny of the elliptic curve 𝐸(𝐾) over a field 𝐾 into a curve 𝐸′(𝐾) is a 
homomorphism 𝜙: 𝐸(𝐾̅) →𝐸′(𝐾̅) over an algebraic closure 𝐾̅ given by rational 
functions. This means that for all points 𝑃, 𝑄∈𝐸(𝐾), 𝜙(𝑃+ 𝑄) = 𝜙(𝑃) + 𝜙(𝑄) and 
there exist rational functions [12] 
 
𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) = (
𝑝(𝑥)
𝑞(𝑥) , 𝑦
𝑓(𝑥)
𝑔(𝑥)) = (𝑥′, 𝑦′), 
 
mapping points of the curve 𝐸 at the points of the curve 𝐸′. The degree of isogeny is 
the maximum of the degrees 𝛼= deg 𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) = max{deg 𝑝(𝑥) , deg 𝑞(𝑥)}, and its 
kernel is subgroup 𝐺⊆𝐸 of the order 𝛼 (separable isogeny), the points of which are 
mapped by the function 𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) into a neutral element of the group O. 
Isogeny compresses the points of the curve 𝐸 at 𝛼 times and is a surjection (𝛼 points 
of the curve 𝐸 are mapped to one point of the curve 𝐸′). When 𝐺= 𝑂, isogeny becomes 
isomorphism (𝛼= 1). 
The calculation of isogenies is usually carried out using the Velu formulas [12] for 
curves in the Weierstrass form. In paper [3] isogeny formulas of the second (2-isogeny) 
and odd degrees are obtained, adapted, in particular, to curves in the form of Edwards 
(4) and (5) with one parameter 𝑑 (complete and quadratic Edwards curves). 
Let us analyze and extend some of their results to curves (3) with the emphasis on 
the analysis of the existing conditions for 2-isogeny over a prime field. 
 

5 
 
The construction of 2-isogeny in [3] is carried out in three stages: 
1. Isomorphic transformation 𝜓1(𝑥, 𝑦) = (𝑢, 𝜈) of the Edwards curve into the 
Montgomery form. 
2. The construction of 2-isogeny 𝜓2(𝑢, 𝜈) = (𝑈, 𝑉). 
3. Reverse transformation 𝜓3(𝑈, 𝑉) = (𝑥, 𝑦) of the isogenous curve in the 
Montgomery shape to the Edwards shape. 
As a result, the composition 𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝜓1 ∘𝜓2 ∘𝜓3 of three mappings between the 
curve 𝐸 and the isogenic curve 𝐸′ is found. 
At the first stage, the Edwards curve (3) 𝑥2 + 𝑎𝑦2 = 1 + 𝑑𝑥2𝑦2 by a rational 
transformation (2) 
 
𝜓1(𝑥, 𝑦) = ((𝑎−𝑑)
1+𝑢
1−𝑢, (𝑎−𝑑)
2𝑢
𝜈) 
 
is transformed into the birationally equivalent Montgomery form 
 
𝜈2 = 𝑢3 + 2(𝑎+ 𝑑)𝑢2 + (𝑎−𝑑)2𝑢. 
(8) 
The point (0,0) is the second-order point of this curve, which, together with the point 
at infinity as a neutral element of the group, forms the kernel of the 2-isogeny. It is 
required to find parameters 𝑎̅ and 𝑑̅ of the isogenous curve with equation (8) and the 
rational function 𝜓2(𝑢, 𝜈) = (𝑈, 𝑉). 
For the Montgomery curve of the general view 
 
𝑀𝑐,𝑏: 𝜈2 = 𝑢3 + 𝑐𝑢2 + 𝑏𝑢, 
(9) 
finding 2-isogeny is well known [12]. Based on the Velu formulas, using the laws of 
the addition of the points of the curve in the general Weierstrass form, for the curve (9) 
one can obtain the 2-isogeny ([12], the example 12.4) 
 
𝜓2(𝑢, 𝜈) = (
𝑢2+𝑐𝑢+𝑏
𝑢
,
𝑢2−𝑏
𝑢2 𝜈) = (𝑈, 𝑉) 
(10) 
and the equation of the isogenous curve 
 
𝑉2 = 𝑈3 −2𝑐𝑈2 + (𝑐2 −4𝑏)𝑈. 
(11) 
The discriminant of the quadratic equation on the right-hand side of (11) is Δ = 16𝑏, 
and depending on the meaning of 𝜒(𝑏), the curve (11) has one or three points of the 2nd 
order. In the first case, one can construct one 2-isogeny, in the two-three points (for 
three kernels as subgroups of the second-order). 
The main question in this work is the question of the existence of 2-isogeny in three 
classes of Edwards curves. As follows from (8) and (9), only those curves (9) of general 
form can be reduced to the Montgomery form (1) or (8) (and, accordingly, to the 
Edwards form), the parameter 𝑏 of which is the square (𝜒(𝑏) = 1). This is connected 
with the existence on the curve (9) the points of the 4th order 𝐹= (𝑢1, 𝜈1), such that 
2𝐹= (0,0). Then, taking 𝑏= 𝑢1
2, equation (9) after replacement 𝑐→𝐶𝑢1 is reduced 
to the form 
 
𝜈2 = 𝑢3 + 𝐶𝑢1𝑢2 + 𝑢1
2𝑢, 
(12) 

6 
or to isomorphic (1) (or its quadratic torsion) curve 
 
𝜈2 = 𝑢3 + 𝐶𝑢2 + 𝑢, 𝐶= 2
𝑎+𝑑
𝑎−𝑑. 
(13) 
This curve is birationally equivalent to the generalized Edwards form curve (3) when 
𝜈2 →𝐷𝜈2. The equation (12) is equivalent to (8) when 𝑢1
2 = (𝑎−𝑑)2 and 𝐶𝑢1 =
2(𝑎+ 𝑑). 
Thus, the 2-isogenic curve (11) with the discriminant Δ = 16𝑢1
2 in this case, has 
three points of the 2nd order, and corresponding isogenies can be found only in the 
classes of quadratic and twisted Edwards curves forming pairs of quadratic torsion. At 
the time the curve 𝐸, for which isogeny is built, can have one point of the 2nd order and 
two points of the 4th order (the class of complete Edwards curves), or belong to other 
classes of Edwards curves with three points of the second order. For example, with 𝑝≡
3mod4 supersingular curve 𝜈2 = 𝑢3 + 𝑢 (for which 𝜒(𝑐2 −4𝑏) = −1) has one point 
of the second-order and two points of the 4th order and is isomorphic to the complete 
Edwards curve. Its 2-isogenous curve (11) 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 −4𝑈 has three points of the 
second-order and falls into the classes of quadratic and twisted Edwards curves with 
the same order 𝑝+ 1 of these curves. However, the element (–4) is a quadratic 
nonresidue, and the Edwards curve, isomorphic to a curve of the form 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 −4𝑈, 
does not exist over a prime field (see equation (12)). However, taking 𝑈→𝑈−2, we 
obtain an isomorphic curve 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 + 6𝑈2 + 8𝑈, for which isomorphism with the 
Edwards curve over a prime field with 𝑝≡7mod8 exists. Thus, the original curve 𝐸 
of the form (8) with the adaptation to Edwards curves can have one or three points of 
the second-order and, therefore, over a prime field belongs to one of the classes of 
complete, twisted, or quadratic Edwards curves. All these curves in the extension 𝐹𝑝2, 
in which all the elements of the subfield 𝐹𝑝 become squares, become quadratic Edwards 
curves. Of course, in the extension 𝐹𝑝𝑛, we can also build complete as well as twisted 
Edwards curves. 
The equations (8) and (9) are identical for 𝑐= 2(𝑎+ 𝑑), 𝑏= (𝑎−𝑑)2, then 
𝑐2 −4𝑏= 16𝑎𝑑 and the isogenic curve equation (11) in the Montgomery form has the 
form 
 
𝑀1: 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 −4(𝑎+ 𝑑)𝑈2 + 4𝑎𝑑𝑈. 
(14) 
Its discriminant is Δ = 16(1 −𝑑)2, and the corresponding roots are defined as  
2(𝑎+ 𝑑) ± 2(𝑎−𝑑) = {4𝑎, 4𝑑}. Therefore, it can be written as follows: 
 
𝑀1: 𝑉2 = 𝑈(𝑈−4𝑎)(𝑈−4𝑑). 
(15) 
Linear coordinate offset 𝑈→{𝑈−4𝑎, 𝑈−4𝑑} to other values of the cubic roots in 
(15) leads to two alternative equations (14) of isogenous curves in the Montgomery 
form: 
 
𝑀2: 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 −4(𝑑−2𝑎)𝑈2 + 16𝑎(𝑎−𝑑)𝑈, 
(16) 
 
𝑀3: 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 + 4(2𝑑−𝑎)𝑈2 −16𝑑(𝑎−𝑑)𝑈. 
(17) 

7 
 
The curve (16), up to isomorphism, coincides with the isogenic curve in the form (8), 
but with the parameters 𝑎̅ and 𝑑̅ 
 
𝑉2 = 𝑈3 + 2(𝑎̅ + 𝑑̅)𝑈2 + (𝑎̅ −𝑑̅)
2𝑈. 
(18) 
From this equation and (12)–(14) one can obtain the equalities 
 
2
𝑎̅+𝑑̅
𝑎̅−𝑑̅ 𝑈1 = −4(𝑎+ 𝑑), 𝑈1
2 = 16𝑎𝑑. 
 
Hence, after the substitution 𝑈1 = ±4√𝑎𝑑 we obtain 
 
𝑎̅+𝑑̅
𝑎̅−𝑑̅ =
∓(𝑎+𝑑)
2√𝑎𝑑⟹𝑑̅1
±1 = 𝑎̅1 (√𝑎+√𝑑
√𝑎−√𝑑)
2
. 
(19) 
So, for curve (8), two isogenous curves (14) in the form (18) have two mutually inverse 
parameters 𝑑̅1
±1 of isomorphic quadratic or twisted Edwards curves. 
According to property 5 of Sect. 2, the twisted Edwards curve is the quadratic torsion 
of the quadratic Edwards curve 𝐸1,𝑑= 𝐸𝑑 with the offset 𝑐= 𝑎 of the parameters 𝑎̃ =
𝑎, 𝑎̃ = 𝑎𝑑, 𝜒(𝑎) = −1, where 𝑑 is the parameter of the quadratic Edwards curve 
(𝜒(𝑑) = 1). In this case, the parameter 𝑎 can be considered as a fixed factor of the 
variable parameter 𝑑, moreover 𝑎̃ ± 𝑑̃ = 𝑎(1 ± 𝑑). For example, with 𝑝≡3mod4 for 
a twisted curve, we can take 𝑎= −1 аnd with 𝑝≡1mod4 as the smallest value of the 
quadratic nonresidue. 
Further, instead of the curve 𝐸𝑎,𝑑 we will use the curve 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑 that leads to the 
substitution 𝑑→𝑎𝑑. This simplifies the formulas for the isogenic curve parameters. 
The formula (19) is valid only for one of the three points of the 2nd order (0,0) of the 
curve (15). Based on (12), (13), (16)–(18) one can obtain two more formulas for the 
parameter 𝑑̅2,3 of isogenic curves, which are given below in Theorem 1. 
The inverse transformation of isogenous curves in the Montgomery form (𝑀1, 𝑀2, 
and 𝑀3) into the Edwards form 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑 is performed based on rational functions (2) taking 
into account different values of coordinates of points of the 4th order  
±𝑈1 ∈{4𝑎√𝑑, 4𝑎√1 −𝑑, 4𝑎√𝑑(𝑑−1)} or ±𝑈1 = 𝑎̅ −𝑑̅ with the help of rational 
function 
 
𝜓3(𝑈, 𝑉) = (
𝑈−𝑈1
𝑈+𝑈1 ,
2𝑈
𝑉√
𝑈1
𝑎̅−𝑑̅) = (𝑥, 𝑦). 
 
Substitution of these rational functions of the form (2) into the equations of the curve 
in the Montgomery form gives the isogenic Edwards curve 𝑥2 + 𝑎̅𝑦2 = 1 + 𝑑̅𝑥2𝑦2. 
The composition 𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝜓1 ∘𝜓2 ∘𝜓3 of three transformations leads to the 2-
isogeny formulas for curves in the Edwards form, which are given below in Theorem 1. 
In [3], the theorem was proved that is valid for complete and quadratic Edwards 
curves (𝑎= 1). We generalize this theorem to all generalized Edwards form curves (3). 
Besides, we give its formulation taking into account the modification of the law of 
points addition (6) of Edwards curves and the replacement (𝑥↔𝑦) [10].

Theorem 1. Let’s take the generalized Edwards form curve 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑 and the elements 
(possibly in extension) of the field 𝐾: 𝛿2 = 𝑑, 𝛾2 = 1 −𝑑, 𝑖2 = −1. Then there exist 
three pairs of 2-isogeny 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑→𝐸′𝑎,𝑎𝑑̅, set by the functions 𝜙1, 𝜙2, and 𝜙3 
𝜙1(𝑥, 𝑦) = (𝑎𝑑∓𝛿
𝑎𝑑± 𝛿
𝑎𝛿𝑥2 ± 1
𝑎𝛿𝑥2 ∓1 , 𝑖(𝑎𝛿∓1) 𝑦

mapping 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑→𝐸′𝑎̅,𝑎̅𝑑̅ with the parameters 𝑑̅1
±1 = 𝑎̅ (
1−𝛿
1+𝛿)
2
; 
𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) = ((𝑎𝛾∓1)𝑥2 ± 1
(𝑎𝛾± 1)𝑥2 ∓1 , (𝑎𝛾∓1)𝑥𝑦), 
mapping 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑→𝐸′𝑎̅,𝑎̅𝑑̅ with the parameters 𝑑̅2
±1 = 𝑎̅ (
1−𝛾
1+𝛾)
2
; 
𝜙3(𝑥, 𝑦) = (−𝛿𝑥2 ∓𝑖𝛾−𝛿
𝛿𝑥2 ± 𝑖𝛾−𝛿, (𝑖𝛾± 𝛿) 𝑦
𝑥), 
mapping 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑→𝐸′𝑎̅,𝑎̅𝑑̅ with the parameters 𝑑̅3
±1 = 𝑎̅ (
𝑖𝛾−𝛿
𝑖𝛾+𝛿)
2
. 
 
The proof of the theorem for the case 𝑎= 1 is given in [3]. Let us adapt its formulas 
for the curve (3). 
Taking into account the accepted designations, equations (16), (18), (19) of isogenic 
curves can be written 
𝑀1: 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 −4𝑎(1 + 𝛿2)𝑈2 + (4𝑎𝛿)2𝑈; 
𝑀2: 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 + 4𝑎(1 + 𝛾2)𝑈2 + (4𝑎𝛾)2𝑈; 
           𝑀3: 𝑉2 = 𝑈3 + 4𝑎(𝛿2 + (𝑖𝛾)2)𝑈2 + (4𝑎𝑖𝛿𝛾)2𝑈. 
The first coordinates of the points (𝑈1, 𝑉1) of the 4th order of these curves (for them 
2(𝑈1, 𝑉1) = (0,0)) are respectively equal to 𝑈1
(1) = ±4𝑎𝛿, 𝑈1
(2) = ±4𝑎𝛾, and  
𝑈1
(3) = ±4𝑎𝑖𝛿𝛾. Equating the coefficients at 𝑈2 in (15), (20), and the equations of 
isogenic curves, we obtain 
2 𝑎̅ + 𝑑̅
𝑎̅ −𝑑̅ 𝑈1
(1) = −4𝑎(1 + 𝛿2), 
2 𝑎̅ + 𝑑̅
𝑎̅ −𝑑̅ 𝑈1
(2) = 4𝑎(1 + 𝛾2), 
2 𝑎̅ + 𝑑̅
𝑎̅ −𝑑̅ 𝑈1
(3) = 4𝑎(𝛿2 + (𝑖𝛾)2). 
Hence, for each pair of isogenic curves, we find the values of the parameters: 
𝑑̅1
±1 = 𝑎̅ (1 −𝛿
1 + 𝛿)
2
, 
𝑑̅2
±1 = 𝑎̅ (1 −𝛾
1 + 𝛾)
2
, 
𝑑̅3
±1 = 𝑎̅ (𝛿−𝑖𝛾
𝛿+ 𝑖𝛾)
2
. 
We emphasize that for the curve 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑 they do not depend on the parameter 𝑎, but they 
depend on the parameter 𝑎̅. 
The proof of formulas for mapping rational functions 𝜙1, 𝜙2, and 𝜙3 is based on the 
composition 𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝜓1 ∘𝜓2 ∘𝜓3 of three transformations: from an Edwards curve 

9 
 
to a Montgomery shape, an isogenous transformation of a Montgomery curve, and 
finally the inverse transformation of the latter to an Edwards curve. It repeats the 
corresponding proof in [3] with the replacement 𝛿→𝑎𝛿, 𝛾→𝑎𝛾. 
It should be noted that the generally accepted definition of the degree of isogeny is 
the highest of the degrees of the polynomials of the first rational function 
𝑝(𝑥)
𝑞(𝑥) of the 
transformation 𝜙(𝑥, 𝑦) [11]. It is valid for Weierstrass curves. If we turn to the original 
Theorem 1 [3], then we come to a paradoxical result: the degree of 2-isogeny is equal 
to 1. The modified law of  Edwards curve points addition (6) with horizontal symmetry 
of inverse points ±(𝑥1, 𝑦1) = (𝑥1, ±𝑦1) adopted by us removes this paradox: the degree 
of isogeny is 𝛼= deg(𝜙) = 2. 
Let’s consider some properties of 2-isogeny of Edwards curve 𝐸𝑎,𝑎𝑑 over a prime 
field. 
Proposition 2. The complete Edwards curve with the order 𝑁𝐸≡0mod8 has a 
unique mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) over the primary field 𝐹𝑝 at 𝜒(𝛾) = 1 to the quadratic 
Edwards curve. 
Proof. By doing 𝜒(𝛾) = 1 the complete curve has points of the 8th order and its order 
is 𝑁𝐸≡0mod8 [10]. At 𝜒(𝛾) = 1 there exist elements ±𝛾 of the field 𝐹𝑝 and the 
parameter 𝑑̅2
±1 = 𝑎̅ (
1−𝛾
1+𝛾)
2
 of the quadratic (𝑎̅ = 1) or twisted (𝜒(𝑎̅) = −1) Edwards 
curve. At 𝑎̅ = 1 there exists a 2-isogeny 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) and the corresponding quadratic 
curves are isomorphic to each other with parameters 𝑑̅2
±1. The transformation from a 
quadratic curve to a twisted curve as a quadratic torsion change all points of the curve 
(except 𝑂= (1,0) and 𝐷0 = (−1,0)), therefore, an isogeny 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) from a complete 
curve exists only in a pair of quadratic curves (𝑎̅ = 1). On the other hand, for the 
complete Edwards curve over the field 𝐹𝑝 there are no elements of the field 𝛿= ±√𝑑, 
because 𝜒(𝑑) = −1 and 2-isogeny 𝜙1(𝑥, 𝑦) and 𝜙3(𝑥, 𝑦) over the field 𝐹𝑝 do not exist. 
This proves the uniqueness of the mapping 𝜙3(𝑥, 𝑦) as one of three functions defined 
in Theorem 1. 
Consequence. The complete Edwards curve with the order 𝑁𝐸≡0mod4 does not 
have 2-isogeny over the field 𝐹𝑝 in all classes of generalized Edwards form curves. 
Proof. From Proposition 2 it follows that the complete Edwards curves are mapped 
exclusively to the quadratic Edwards curves. But the order of quadratic Edwards curves 
is 𝑁𝐸≡0mod8 [10], that’s why complete Edwards curves with the order  
𝑁𝐸≡0mod4, according to the Tate theorem [12], do not have 2-isogeny over the field 
𝐹𝑝. 
Proposition 3. The quadratic Edwards curve has the only mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) over the 
prime field 𝐹𝑝 to the quadratic Edwards curve at any values 𝑝 and 𝜒(𝛾) = 1, and 
mappings 𝜙1(𝑥, 𝑦) and 𝜙3(𝑥, 𝑦) at 𝑝≡1mod4 and 𝜒(𝛾) = 1. 
Proof. Similarly to Proposition 2, there is a unique mapping of the Edwards quadratic 
curve over the prime field to the Edwards quadratic curve; at 𝜒(𝛾) = 1 the only 
mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) of the Edwards quadratic curve over the prime field 𝐹𝑝 to the 
Edwards quadratic curve takes place. By doing 𝑝≡1mod4 and 𝜒(𝛾) = 1 for quadratic 
curves there exist the elements of the field 𝛿= ±√𝑑, 𝛾= ±√1 −𝑑, and 𝑖= ±√−1, 
and, respectively, mappings 𝜙1(𝑥, 𝑦) and 𝜙3(𝑥, 𝑦). 

10 
Proposition 4. The twisted Edwards curve has the only mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) over the 
primary field 𝐹𝑝 to the Edwards twisted curve at 𝑝≡3mod4 and 𝜒(𝛾) = 1. 
Proof. According to property 8 of the Sect. 1 [10], at 𝑝≡1mod4 the twisted 
Edwards curve over the primary field 𝐹𝑝 does not have points of the 4th order, therefore, 
the corresponding 2-isogeny does not exist in this class of curves. At 𝑝≡3mod4 over 
the field 𝐹𝑝 there do not exist elements 𝑖= ±√−1 and, respectively, mappings 𝜙1(𝑥, 𝑦) 
and 𝜙3(𝑥, 𝑦). The only 2-isogeny in this class at 𝑝≡3mod4 and 𝜒(𝛾) = 1 is the 
function 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦). 
Let’s consider examples of the 2-isogeny of complete and quadratic Edwards curves 
over the field 𝐹𝑝. 
Example 1. Let 𝑝= 11 and the complete Edwards curve 𝐸= 𝐸7: 𝑥2 + 𝑦2 = 1 +
7𝑥2𝑦2 where 𝜒(𝑑= 7) = −1, 𝜒(1 −𝑑= 4) = 1 with the order 𝑁𝐸= 16 is given. 
According to Theorem 1, there exists only a pair of 2-isogeny Edwards quadratic curves 
𝐸′ = 𝐸4 and 𝐸′ = 𝐸3 with the parameters 𝑑1,2 = 𝑑̅±1 = {4,3} and the mapping 
𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦). They have the same order 𝑁𝐸= 16 (which corresponds to the well-known 
Tate theorem [11]), are isomorphic to each other, but instead of one they already have 
3 points of the 2nd order (the curves are noncyclic) and 12 points of the 4th order. There 
are two singular points of the 2nd and 4th order. The points of the original complete 
curve E  are denoted as 𝑃𝑖 , and the points of two isogenic curves 𝐸′ is as 𝑄𝑖. As with 
the doubling of points, the mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) compresses the preimage (curve 𝐸) in 
half, i.e. maps a pair of points of curve 𝐸 to one point of curve 𝐸′. Unlike doubling, 2-
isogeny does not necessarily halve the order of a point of even order. 
On the curve E , we have points (±1,0), (0, ±1), (±2, ±4), (±3, ±3), (±4, ±2). 
Let 𝑃1 = (2,4) is the point of the 16th order of the curve. 𝑃2 = (3,3) = 6𝑃1 is the point 
of the 8th order, 𝑃3 = (4,2) = 11𝑃1. On the isogenous curve 𝐸′ = 𝐸4, except points 
𝑂= (1,0), 𝐷0 = (−1,0), ±𝐹0 = (0, ±1), we have singular points 𝐷1,2 = (±5, ∞), 
±𝐹1 = (∞, ±5), and points of the 4th order (±2, ±3) and (±3, ±2). Let’s denote 𝑄1 =
(2,3), 𝑄2 = (3,2), 𝑃∗= 𝑃+ 𝐷0 = (−𝑥1, −𝑦1). Using the first function value 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) 
we calculate 
±𝜙2(𝑃1, 𝑃1
∗)(1) = (3, ±2) = ±𝑄2, 
±𝜙2(𝑃2, 𝑃2
∗)(1) = (∞, ±5) = ±𝐹1, 
±𝜙2(𝑃3, 𝑃3
∗)(1) = (−3, ±2) = ∓𝑄2
∗, 
𝜙2(±𝐹0)(1) = (−1,0) = 𝐷0, 
𝜙2(𝐷0, 𝑂)(1) = (1,0) = 𝑂. 
The second isogenic curve 𝐸′ = 𝐸3 with the parameter 𝑑= 3, except points O, 𝐷0, ±𝐹0, 
has singular points 𝐷1,2 = (±2, ∞), ±𝐹1 = (∞, ±2), and the points of the 4th order 
(±4, ±4) and (±5, ±5). Let 𝑅1 = (4,4) and 𝑅2 = (5,5). According to the second value 
of the function 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦)(2) we obtain 
±𝜙2(𝑃1, 𝑃1
∗)(2) = (4, ∓4) = ∓𝑅1, 
±𝜙2(𝑃2, 𝑃2
∗)(2) = (0, ±1) = ±𝐹0, 
±𝜙2(𝑃3, 𝑃3
∗)(2) = (−4, ∓4) = ±𝑅1
∗, 
𝜙2(±𝐹0)(2) = (−1,0) = 𝐷0, 
𝜙2(𝐷0, 𝑂)(2) = (1,0) = 𝑂. 

11 
 
So, the function 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) maps a pair of points of the same order of the curve to one 
point of the curve 𝐸′ (i.e. the function 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) is a surjection), and one complete 
Edwards curve is mapped to two isomorphic quadratic curves. 
Example 2. Let’s construct the isogeny for the quadratic curve 𝐸= 𝐸3 from example 
1 with the parameters 𝑑= 3, 1 −𝑑= 9, 𝛾= 3. One of the isogenic curves when 
mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦) has the same parameter 𝑑= 3 and the same points 𝑅1 = (4,4), 𝑅2 =
(5,5), 𝐷1,2 = (±2, ∞), ±𝐹1 = (∞, ±2), ±𝐹0 = (∞, ±1), 𝐷0, 𝑂. The mapping 
𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦)(2) of this curve gives us the points of the curve 𝐸′ 
±𝜙2(𝑅1, 𝑅1
∗)(2) = (∞, ∓2) = ±𝐹1, 
±𝜙2(𝑅2, 𝑅2
∗)(2) = (0, ∓1) = ∓𝐹0, 
𝜙2(±𝐹0)(2) = (−1,0) = 𝐷0, 
𝜙2(±𝐹1)(2) = (2, ∞) = 𝐷1, 
𝜙2(𝐷1, 𝐷2)(2) = (−2, ∞) = 𝐷2, 
𝜙2(𝐷0, 𝑂)(2) = (1,0) = 𝑂. 
If you reapply the function 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦)(2) to the points of the isogenous curve 𝐸′, we obtain 
the points of the curve 𝐸′′ 
𝜙2(±𝐹0)(2) = (−1,0) = 𝐷0, 
𝜙2(±𝐹1)(2) = (2, ∞) = 𝐷1, 
𝜙2(𝐷1, 𝐷2)(2) = (−2, ∞) = 𝐷2, 
𝜙2(𝐷0, 𝑂)(2) = (1,0) = 𝑂. 
Thus, the second isogeny returns us to the points of the original curve (𝐸′′ = 𝐸), and 
for two steps the mapped points of the curve 𝐸 are doubled (multiplied by 𝛼: points of 
the 4th order are mapped into points of the 2nd order, and points of the 2nd order are to 
the point 𝑂). This is an example of dual 2-isogeny 𝜙̂2 = 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦)(2) for a quadratic 
curve over a prime field. 
Consider the isogenies of twisted Edwards curves over the field 𝐹𝑝. According to 
Proposition 3, they exist only at 𝑝≡3mod4 and 𝜒(𝛾) = 1, at the same time it is 
possible to accept 𝑎= 𝑎̅ = −1. 
Example 3. Let 𝑝= 19 and the twisted curve 𝐸−1,−9 with the parameters 𝑎= −1, 
𝑎𝑑= −9, 𝛾= √11 = ±7 is given. Its order is 𝑁𝐸= 16. It has the points 𝑂, 𝐷0,  
𝐷1,2 = (±6, ∞), and the points of the first quadrant 𝑃1 = (2,1), 𝑃2 = (3,6),  
𝑃3 = (5,5) (total of 12 points of the 4th order with the coordinates (±𝑥, ±𝑦)). One of 
the isogenous curves 𝐸′−1,−16, when mapped 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦), has the parameter  
𝑑̅2 = (
1−7
1+7)
2
= 16, the points 𝑂, 𝐷0, 𝐷′1,2 = (±5, ∞), and the points of the 4th order of 
the first quadrant 𝑄1 = (2,3), 𝑄2 = (7,8), 𝑄3 = (9,9) (total of 12 points of the 4th order 
with the coordinates (
,
)
x
y


). The mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦)(1) of the curve 𝐸−1,−9 gives 
the points of the first isogenous curve 𝐸′−1,−16 
±𝜙2(𝑃1, 𝑃1
∗)(1) = ± (
(−7 −1)22 + 1
(−7 + 1)22 −1 = 2, (−7 −1)2 = 3) = ±𝑄1, 
±𝜙2(𝑃2, 𝑃2
∗)(1) = ±(−7,8) = ∓𝑄2
∗, 
±𝜙2(𝑃3, 𝑃3
∗)(1) = ±(−9,9) = ∓𝑄3
∗, 
𝜙2(𝐷1, 𝐷2)(1) = (5, ∞) = 𝐷′1, 
𝜙2(𝐷0, 𝑂)(1) = (1,0) = 𝑂. 

12 
The second isogenous curve 𝐸′−1,13 with the reverse meaning of the parameter  
𝑑̅2
−1 = 3−1 = 13 is isomorphic to the first one and contains the points 𝑂, 𝐷0,  
𝐷′′1,2 = (±4, ∞), 𝑅1 = (2,2), 𝑅2 = (8,6), 𝑅3 = (9,7). The mapping 𝜙2(𝑥, 𝑦)(2) of the 
curve 𝐸−1,−9 gives the points of the 2nd isogenous curve 𝐸′−1,−6 
±𝜙2(𝑃1, 𝑃1
∗)(2) = ± (
(−7 + 1)22 −1
(−7 −1)22 + 1 = −9, (−7 + 1)2 = 7) = ∓𝑅3
∗, 
±𝜙2(𝑃2, 𝑃2
∗)(2) = ±(8,6) = ±𝑅2, 
±𝜙2(𝑃3, 𝑃3
∗)(2) = ±(2,2) = ±𝑅1, 
𝜙2(𝐷1, 𝐷2)(2) = (4, ∞) = 𝐷′1, 
𝜙2(𝐷0, 𝑂)(2) = (1,0) = 𝑂. 
In contrast to the isogenies of quadratic curves over a prime field, for twisted Edwards 
curves that do not have singular 4th order points, pairs of 4th order points of the curve 𝐸 
are mapped to one point of the same order of the curve 𝐸′. Halving the number of 
singular points is an advantage of the class of twisted Edwards curves over quadratic 
ones (when programming isogenies). 
For isogeny 𝜙: 𝐸→𝐸′ there exists dual isogeny 𝜙̂: 𝐸′ →𝐸, in such way that  
𝜙°𝜙̂ = [deg(𝜙) = 𝛼] [11]. The formulas of  Theorem 2 prove that over the field 𝐹𝑝 for 
the complete Edwards curves, dual isogeny does not exist, but it exists in the extension 
𝐹𝑝2. To find dual isogeny 𝜙̂: 𝐸′ →𝐸, for example to the function 𝜙1(𝑥, 𝑦) with the 
values of the isogenic curve 
𝑑̅1
±1 = 𝑎̅ (1 −𝛿
1 + 𝛿)
2
. 
It is necessary to solve the inverse problem: from the known value 𝑑̅1 of the curve 𝐸′ it 
is necessary to calculate one of the suitable values of the parameter 𝛿 of the curve 𝐸, 
which is determined by a similar formula 
𝛿±1 = 1 −√𝑎̅−1𝑑̅1
1 + √𝑎̅−1𝑑̅1
. 
Hence we see that the dual mapping of the curve 𝐸′ to the complete and twisted 
Edwards curves 𝐸 exists only in the extension 𝐹𝑝2, in which all curves defined over the 
field 𝐹𝑝, have the properties of quadratic curves.

Conclusions 
Thus, over the field 𝐹𝑝 there exists 2-isogenies 𝜙: 𝐸→𝐸′ from the complete curves to 
the quadratic Edwards curves, from the quadratic curves to the quadratic Edwards 
curves, and also from the twisted curves to the twisted Edwards curves. In the extension 
𝐹𝑝2 all the curves defined over the field 𝐹𝑝 become quadratic Edwards curve (their 
parameters 𝑎 and 𝑑 are the squares in the field 𝐹𝑝2), and for any such curve, there is a 
pair of isogenic quadratic curves defined by Theorem 1. In practice, in this regard, the 
isogenies of curves given over 𝐹𝑝 are calculated over the extension 𝐹𝑝2. The 
implementation of one of the promising algorithms for PQC Supersingular Isogenies 
Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) [13] is based, as is known, on 2- and 3-isogeny of supersingular

elliptic curves. The use of fast twisted Edwards curve arithmetic will undoubtedly allow 
the construction of more efficient cryptosystems.
