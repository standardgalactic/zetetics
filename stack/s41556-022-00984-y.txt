Mammalian embryos sequentially differentiate into trophec-
toderm and an inner cell mass, the latter of which differenti-
ates into primitive endoderm and epiblast. Trophoblast stem 
(TS), extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) and embryonic stem 
(ES) cells derived from these three lineages can self-assemble 
into synthetic embryos, but the mechanisms remain unknown. 
Here, we show that a stem cell-specific cadherin code drives 
synthetic embryogenesis. The XEN cell cadherin code enables 
XEN cell sorting into a layer below ES cells, recapitulating the 
sorting of epiblast and primitive endoderm before implanta-
tion. The TS cell cadherin code enables TS cell sorting above 
ES cells, resembling extraembryonic ectoderm clustering 
above epiblast following implantation. Whereas differential 
cadherin expression drives initial cell sorting, cortical ten-
sion consolidates tissue organization. By optimizing cadherin 
code expression in different stem cell lines, we tripled the 
frequency of correctly formed synthetic embryos. Thus, by 
exploiting cadherin codes from different stages of develop-
ment, lineage-specific stem cells bypass the preimplantation 
structure to directly assemble a postimplantation embryo.
Cadherins and protocadherins regulate cell adhesion forces in many 
different systems1–4. Cells expressing different types and levels of cad-
herins show differential cell–cell adhesion and sorting1,5–8. Moreover, 
synthetic genetic programs, in which distinct cell–cell contacts spec-
ify differential cadherin expression, can induce self-organization into 
multidomain structures and sequential assembly9.
To determine the role of cadherins in the self-assembly of syn-
thetic, so-called ETX embryos10,11, we first re-analysed single-cell 
RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data that we published previously10 
to examine cadherin expression in the building blocks of ETX 
embryos: embryonic stem (ES), trophoblast stem (TS) and extra-
embryonic endoderm (XEN) cell lines (Fig. 1a). We found that 
E-cadherin (Cdh1) messenger RNA (mRNA) was equally abundant 
in ES and TS cells, whereas P-cadherin (Cdh3) was expressed only 
in TS cells, and K-cadherin (Cdh6) was expressed mainly in XEN 
cells (Fig. 1b,c). The differential expression of cadherins in ES, TS 
and XEN cells implies a potential role in driving the self-assembly 
of ETX embryos.
We then examined the expression of these three cadherins in 
cells dissociated from either ETX or natural embryos at successive 
stages (Fig. 1a). ES/epiblast, TS/trophectoderm and XEN/primitive 
endoderm lineages were defined by the expression of their respec-
tive markers and showed similar dynamics of cadherin expression 
in ETX and natural embryos (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1a). 
In natural embryos, E-cadherin was expressed in all lineages from 
E4.5 to E6.5; P-cadherin expression was elevated only in trophec-
toderm after implantation (E5.5 and E6.5); and K-cadherin expres-
sion was elevated only in primitive endoderm before implantation 
(E4.5) when it sorts below the epiblast (Fig. 1d and Extended Data  
Fig. 1b). We verified that the corresponding proteins, similar to 
mRNA, were differentially expressed in ES or TS colonies (Extended 
Data Fig. 1c), day 4 ETX embryos and E5.5 natural embryos 
(Extended Data Fig. 1d). Therefore, XEN cells most resemble E4.5 
primitive endoderm cells of the preimplantation embryo, whereas 
TS cells resemble extraembryonic ectoderm cells of the postimplan-
tation embryo.
ES cells readily form chimeras with eight-cell-stage embryos 
and sort to the epiblast lineage. Given that E- and K-cadherin were 
differentially expressed in the epiblast and primitive endoderm of 
natural preimplantation embryos, we examined whether overex-
pression (OE) of these cadherins in ES cells would affect their sub-
sequent sorting in the blastocysts of chimeras (Fig. 1e). We found 
that wild-type ES cells (n = 32 embryos) and ES cells overexpress-
ing E-cadherin (Cdh1 OE) contributed exclusively to the epiblast 
of the chimeras (n = 16 embryos) (Fig. 1f,g). In contrast, ES cells 
overexpressing K-cadherin (Cdh6 OE) frequently contributed to 
the primitive endoderm (n = 16 embryos) (Fig. 1f,g and Extended 
Data Fig. 1e). These data are consistent with K-cadherin promot-
ing primitive endoderm localization and E-cadherin promoting 
epiblast localization.
We noted that ES cells overexpressing P-cadherin (Cdh3 OE) 
were excluded from the preimplantation embryo (n = 13 embryos) 
and sorted outside the trophectoderm (Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data 
Fig. 1f), consistent with low P-cadherin expression in all lineages of 
the blastocyst and elevated P-cadherin expression in the trophecto-
derm only in the postimplantation natural embryo.
To evaluate whether differential adhesion plays a role in 
ETX embryo self-assembly, we used atomic force microscopy 
(AFM) to determine the cell–cell adhesion of ES, TS and XEN 
cells in vitro (Fig. 2a,b). We found that the mean adhesion forces 
between ES–ES cell couples (1.94 ± 0.54 nN) and TS–TS cell cou-
ples (2.20 ± 0.85 nN) were significantly higher than those between

XEN–XEN cell couples (0.55 ± 0.11 nN) or between ES–TS cell 
couples (0.57 ± 0.36 nN), thus indicating a tendency for ES cells and 
TS cells to form homotypic associations. In addition, the adhesion 
forces between XEN–ES cell couples (0.83 ± 0.96 nN) were greater 
than those between XEN–XEN cell couples (0.55 ± 0.11 nN) or 
XEN–TS (0.46 ± 0.24 nN) cell couples, suggesting that XEN cells 
have the highest affinity for ES cells (Fig. 2c). We also inferred adhe-
sion forces from the contact angles between cells12 (Fig. 2d). The 
contact angles at ES–ES, TS–TS and XEN–ES junctions were greater 
than the contact angles between ES–TS, XEN–XEN and TS–XEN 
cells (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2a), in agreement with the 
AFM measurements.
To compare cell–cell contact angles in ETX and natural embryos, 
we employed the imaging surface analysis environment (ImSAnE) 
algorithm13,14 to extract focal planes from three-dimensional (3D) 
stacks of E-cadherin-stained day 4 ETX and E5.5 natural embryos 
and unrolled these into 2D projections (Extended Data Fig. 2b). 
In agreement with cell contact angle measurements in stem cell 
doublets, we found that the homotypic contact angles were larger 
than the heterotypic contact angles in ETX and natural embryos 
(Extended Data Fig. 2c). We also noted that the contact angle 
between XEN–XEN and VE–VE cells at the surface of ETX embryos 
and natural embryos was close to 180° (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d), 
indicating a smooth boundary interface and reflecting the high 
relative tension along the interface after self-organization. Together, 
these measurements indicate differential cadherin expression and 
differential adhesion between stem cells that build—and lineages 
that comprise—ETX embryos.
To examine the potential relationship between differential cad-
herin expression and differential adhesion, we measured adhesion 
forces between ES and TS cells and immobilized E-cadherin (Cdh1) 
or P-cadherin (Cdh3) substrate (Fig. 2f). ES cells exhibited higher 
adhesion with immobilized E-cadherin (2.13 ± 0.83 nN) than with 
P-cadherin (1.07 ± 0.54 nN), whereas TS cells displayed compa-
rable adhesion forces with both E-cadherin (2.02 ± 0.89 nN) and 
P-cadherin (2.41 ± 0.86 nN). We then used RNA interference to 
knockdown (KD) cadherins in stem cells. E-cadherin KD reduced 
ES–ES adhesion fourfold. P- or E-cadherin KD similarly reduced 
TS–TS adhesion, suggesting that downregulation of one cadherin 
was sufficient to decrease the TS–TS adhesion force below a critical 
threshold (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 2e). Depletion of either 
E- or P-cadherin from XEN cells did not affect their homotypic 
adhesion (Fig. 2g). Thus, E-cadherin is required for the homotypic 
adhesion of ES cells, whereas both E- and P-cadherin are required 
for the homotypic adhesion of TS cells.
To assess whether the measured adhesion forces are sufficient 
to generate ETX embryos, we simulated assembly using the cellular 
Potts model (CPM)15, re-sampling our AFM adhesion force mea-
surements to provide parameters (Fig. 2h). This analysis showed 
that, among the many sorted configurations possible with three 
cell types, ETX-like structures were the most favoured (Fig. 2i) (see 
Supplementary Information).

Next, we determined how the observed cadherin code affects 
the efficiency of ETX embryogenesis. Single-cell suspensions of 
ES, TS and XEN cells seeded into microwell plates assembled 
into multiple structures, of which 15.4% formed ETX structures  
recapitulating postimplantation embryo morphogenesis (Fig. 3a 
and Supplementary Video 1). In contrast, 38.2% of structures had 
more than one ES compartment, 30.8% had more than one TS 
compartment and 12.8% had mislocalized XEN cells or lacked 
an outside XEN layer; we termed these missorted ETX structures  
(Fig. 3b–d). The proportion of correctly sorted ETX embryos

plateaued at 15% after the first day of culture (Extended Data  
Fig. 3a). Thus, the three cell types undergo a sorting phase within 
the first 24 h of seeding before becoming consolidated into com-
partments. We hypothesized that cells can no longer sort during the 
consolidation phase due to their low mobility. To test this, we filmed 
ETX embryo formation by time-lapse microscopy and tracked cell 
mobility (Extended Data Fig. 3b). This revealed all cell types to be 
mobile during the cell sorting stage, becoming relatively immobile 
during the tissue consolidation stage (Extended Data Fig. 3c,d).
XEN cell sorting fell into a particular two-phase pattern. XEN 
cells sorted efficiently; over 90% of XEN cells formed a monolayer, 
first enveloping ES cells and then spreading to cover TS cells. KD of 
E-cadherin (Cdh1) or K-cadherin (Cdh6), which are co-expressed 
in XEN cells, reduced the frequency of ETX embryos having a con-
tinuous XEN layer (Fig. 3e,f). However, XEN cells with OE of Cdh1 
or Cdh6 often missorted within these compartments (Fig. 3e,f). 
Thus, an optimal balance of E-cadherin and K-cadherin contributes 
to the proper sorting of XEN cells in ETX embryos.
Differential adhesion cannot fully account for the ability of XEN 
cells to envelop the TS layer because the adhesion force between ES 
and XEN cells is larger than that between ES and TS cells, and XEN 
cells were found between the ES and TS compartments in approxi-
mately 10% of CPM simulations that sampled these data (Fig. 2i). 
The discrepancy between the predicted interfacial hierarchy for 
the sorted configuration in the ETX embryo and the measured dif-
ferential adhesion force led us to hypothesize that the low number 
of XEN cells we used for making ETX embryos was insufficient to 
cover all ES cells during the sorting stage. To test this, we seeded 
ES and TS cells with between five and ten XEN cells and fixed the 
nascent structures at days 1 and 3. We found that low numbers of 
XEN cells first covered the ES cells only; subsequently, the TS cells 
enveloped the entire structure (Extended Data Fig. 3e,f). When we 
seeded approximately ten ES cells per structure, the XEN cells com-
pletely covered the ES cells, thereby excluding TS cells (Extended 
Data Fig. 3e,f), consistent with our measurements of differential 
adhesion.
Previous studies have reported a role for cortical stiffness in cell 
sorting, particularly in cell externalization16–18, prompting us to con-
sider whether cortical tension may influence the capacity of XEN 
cells to form their external monolayer. Indeed, our AFM17 measure-
ments indicated that cortical stiffness is lower in XEN cells than in 
either TS or ES cells (Extended Data Fig. 3g). To determine whether 
differences in cortical stiffness between the different stem cell types 
of ETX embryos were due to differential actomyosin activity, as in 
other systems17,19,20, we measured cortical stiffness in the presence of 
blebbistatin (a myosin inhibitor21). Blebbistatin reduced the corti-
cal stiffness of both ES and TS cells to the same level as in XEN 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 3h). We also found that well-sorted ETX 
embryos treated with either blebbistatin or cytochalasin D (an actin 
depolymerizer22) at day 3 for 24 h—once the primary sorting phase 
was completed—failed to maintain efficient sorting compared with 
control ETX embryos (Extended Data Fig. 3h). Moreover, when we 
treated well-sorted ETX embryos with either blebbistatin or cyto-
chalasin D for 24 h at day 3, once the primary cell sorting phase was 
complete, more than 80 and 85% of blebbistatin- and cytochalasin 
D-treated structures, respectively, failed to maintain sorting com-
pared with 18% of control ETX embryos (Extended Data Fig. 3h).
To further test the role of cortical stiffness on XEN cell exter-
nalization, we used a CPM in which cortical stiffness can be tuned 
independently. We found that lower stiffness increased both the 
sorting efficiency and speed of XEN cell externalization (Extended 
Data Fig. 3i), suggesting that the softness of XEN cells is important 
for this event. Together, these data suggest that, in addition to the 
differential expression of distinct cadherins, cortical stiffness plays a 
role in the self-assembly of stem cells into ETX embryos.
Next, we examined the function of the cadherin code in ES and 
TS cells during ETX embryo assembly. KD of P-cadherin (Cdh3) 
in TS cells, but not in ES cells, resulted in TS mislocalization and 
disrupted ETX embryogenesis. Similarly, KD of E-cadherin (Cdh1) 
in ES cells, but not TS cells, disrupted ETX embryogenesis. ETX 
embryo formation still occurred following E-cadherin depletion 
from TS cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 4a), suggesting that 
differential expression of P-cadherin between ES cells and TS cells 
is sufficient to drive their sorting. We noticed that E-cadherin and 
P-cadherin showed different levels of expression in individual 
wild-type ES and TS cells, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4b–d). 
We considered that subsets of wild-type stem cells with low cadherin 
expression compromise ETX embryo formation. Indeed, when we 
combined wild-type ES and XEN cells with either a P-cadherin OE 
subset or a P-cadherin KD subset of TS cells, P-cadherin KD TS 
cells mislocalized to the ES compartment. Similarly, when combin-
ing wild-type XEN and TS cells with either an E-cadherin OE subset 
or an E-cadherin KD subset of ES cells, we observed mislocalization 
of E-cadherin KD ES cells in the TS compartment (Extended Data 
Fig. 5a,b). Thus, populations of ES and TS cells with low E-cadherin 
and low P-cadherin expression, respectively, compromise sorting 
in ETX embryos. Strikingly, mixing E-cadherin OE ES cells and 
P-cadherin OE TS cells with wild-type XEN cells increased ETX 
embryogenesis efficiency by almost threefold from approximately 
15% with wild-type stem cells to approximately 42% with the OE 
cells (Fig. 3h). The time course of the sorting of E-cadherin OE ES 
cells, P-cadherin OE TS cells and XEN cells revealed that around 
30% of these structures were well-sorted 12 h after cell seeding com-
pared with 6.8% of wild-type structures (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d).

Thus, the sorting rate is increased following cadherin OE, as sug-
gested in simulations23. Together, these results indicate that variable 
E-cadherin expression in ES cells and P-cadherin expression in TS 
cells limits the efficiency of ETX embryo formation.
As 
implantation-stage 
embryo 
morphogenesis 
requires 
both lumenogenesis and basement membrane formation, we 
wanted to determine whether cadherin-enhanced ETX embryo 
self-organization also improved these events. ETX embryos gener-
ated from wild-type stem cells formed a central lumen—correspond-
ing to the lumen of the epiblast rosette at implantation24,25—within 
the ES compartment by day 2. By day 3, multiple lumens developed 
in the TS compartment, corresponding to the multiple lumens of 
the E5.5 extraembryonic ectoderm, and these unified into a single 
cavity between days 4 and 5, as in natural development by E6.0 
(Fig. 4a). Such a single unified cavity formed in over 90% of prop-
erly sorted ETX embryos but in fewer than 5% of ETX structures 
with missorted ES and TS cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Moreover, 
ETX structures with missorted XEN cells lacked cavities entirely 
(Extended Data Fig. 6b). Importantly, proper sorting and amniotic 
cavity-like formation were observed in only 9% of structures built 
from wild-type cells but in 40% of structures built from E-cadherin 
OE ES cells, P-cadherin OE TS cells and wild-type XEN cells  
(Fig. 4b,c). Moreover, the structures formed from cadherin OE cells, 
and the cavities within them, were longer than in ETX embryos 
built from wild-type cells (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d) after 3 d in cul-
ture. Together, this indicates that E- and P-cadherin OE in ES and 
TS cells, respectively, promotes cavity formation in ETX embryos.
Lumenogenesis requires signalling from the basement mem-
brane, produced by the visceral endoderm24,26. Accordingly, we 
found that ETX structures with missorted XEN cells, which lacked 
a cavity, also failed to establish a basement membrane (Extended 
Data Fig. 6e). A continuous laminin-containing basement mem-
brane was detected in 78% of structures built from E-cadherin 
OE ES cells, P-cadherin OE TS cells and XEN cells (Fig. 4d) but in 
only 45% of structures made from wild-type ES, TS and XEN cells  
(Fig. 4e). Thus, elevated expression of E- and P-cadherin in ES and 
TS cells, respectively, increases the successful formation of basement 
membrane, lumen and correctly sorted ETX embryos (Fig. 4f).
Our findings shed light on the remarkable self-assembly of stem 
cells into synthetic embryos10,11,27–32. We show that this requires a 
cadherin code that, through strong homotypic interactions, sorts 
ES and TS cells into distinct compartments. In contrast, heterotypic 
interactions enable XEN cells to first surround ES and then TS cells. 
Although XEN cells have a cadherin code resembling preimplan-
tation primitive endoderm, they nevertheless attain the ability to 
support synthetic postimplantation morphogenesis (Extended 
Data Fig. 6f). These differences between natural and ETX embryos 
highlight the distinct use of common rules between biological  
development and bioengineering. Synthetic embryo assembly uti-
lizes these codes in a distinct way: XEN cells use the preimplanta-
tion code of primitive endoderm to sort in a layer below ES cells, 
whereas TS cells use the postimplantation code of extraembryonic 
ectoderm to sort as a cluster above ES cells.
The outcome of cell sorting has been modelled previously by 
considering cell-specific differences in interfacial energies maxi-
mizing the most energetically favourable cell interfaces15,33–36. 
Disparity in interfacial energy was considered to reflect adhesion 
differences, with cadherins being the best-characterized effectors1,37, 
as espoused in the differential adhesion hypothesis (DAH)33,38. In 
accord, we now show that cell sorting is driven in ETX embryos by 
increased cadherin-mediated homotypic interactions in relation to 
heterotypic interactions. The later development of the differential 
interfacial tension hypothesis (DITH)16,17,39–41 invoking the role of 
differential cortical tension in sorting resonates with our findings 
on XEN cell externalization in self-assembly. Together, our obser-
vations support the balance between adhesion and tension (DAH 
versus DITH) as in biophysical models of cell sorting. However, 
incomplete ES–TS sorting still results in local order, emphasizing 
a need for global-scale sorting to fully recapitulate natural mor-
phogenesis. DAH and DITH only account for local sorting to form 
homotypic clusters of ES and TS cells, as seen even in missorted 
structures. For complete sorting, ETX embryos must escape from 
locally correct neighbourhoods within globally incorrect patterns 
to explore alternative conformations. If cells remain in local minima 
before cell sorting is complete, structures will remain missorted.
The importance of the cell type-specific cadherin code is illus-
trated by our finding that established wild-type stem cell lines show 
heterogeneous cadherin expression, with some subsets below the 
threshold required to support proper sorting. Elevating E-cadherin 
in ES cells and P-cadherin in TS cells substantially improves ETX 
embryogenesis efficiency (Fig. 4f). This identifies a broader chal-
lenge in synthetic biology; namely, characterizing and ameliorating 
the impacts of heterogeneity in stem cell lines—factors that remain 
for the most part undefined but reported35,42–44. Such heterogene-
ity might affect the distribution of cell–cell cohesive properties 
within the same cell population45, confounding the hierarchy of 
interactions necessary to drive self-organization of other organoid 
structures46,47. Thus, the principles of self-organization that we now 
describe can provide a means for increasing the efficiency of forma-
tion of different types of organoids by modulating interactions and 
the physical properties of cells.

P-cadherins enables the sorting of ES (epiblast-like), XEN (VE-like) and TS (TE-like) stem cells. Wild-type ES cells with low E-cadherin expression and 
wild-type TS cells with low P-cadherin expression exhibited detrimental global sorting efficiency. This could be overcome by overexpressing E-cadherin 
in ES cells and P-cadherin in TS cells to increase the efficiency of ETX embryo formation. Proper morphogenesis, including cavity formation, basement 
membrane formation (purple) and symmetry breaking can only be observed in well-sorted structures. Numerical data are available as source data.

Mouse embryos. Mice were maintained according to national and international 
guidelines. All experiments were regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) 
Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical review by the University 
of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. Experiments were 
approved by the Home Office. Animals were inspected daily and those that showed 
health concerns were culled by cervical dislocation. Six-week-old female CD-1 
mice were used in all of the animal experiments. All experimental mice were free of 
pathogens and were on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, with unlimited access to water 
and food. The temperature in the facility was controlled and maintained at 21 °C.
Generation of cell lines. The experiments were performed using mouse E14 
wild-type ES cells48 (derived in the laboratory of M.Z.-G.). The H2B-CFP ES cells 
were a gift from M. Elowitz, the wild-type TS cells were a gift from J. Nichols, the 
EGFP TS cells were a gift from J. Rossant, the wild-type XEN cells were a gift from 
E. Na and the H2B-RFP XEN cells were derived from wild-type XEN cells. Cdh1 
and Cdh6 OE ES cells were generated from E14 wild-type ES cells, the Cdh3 OE TS 
cells were generated from wild-type TS cells and the Cdh1 and Cdh6 OE XEN cells 
were generated from wild-type XEN cells (see below).
To generate cadherin OE ES, TS or XEN cell lines, 0.5 μg of a super piggyBac 
transposase expression vector (PB210PA-1; System Biosciences) and 2 μg 
Cdh1-pHygro, Cdh3-pHygro or Cdh6-pHygro plasmid were co-transfected into 
cells using Lipofectamine. Cells were passaged for 24 h after transfection and 
subjected to selection in medium containing 50 μg ml−1 hygromycin (10687010; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 week. A similar approach was used to generate the 
stable nuclear reporter H2B-RFP XEN cell line.
Cloning. Cloning procedures were performed using Gateway technology (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific). The fragment of interest (Cdh1, Cdh3 or Cdh6) was amplified 
by PCR to introduce attB sites. These fragments were cloned into the pDONR221 
vector (a gift from J. Silva) using BP clonase II (11789020; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). The fragment of interest (Cdh1, Cdh3 or Cdh6) was subcloned into a 
pHygro vector containing a hygromycin resistance cassette for expression in stem 
cells. The recombination reaction was carried out using LR Clonase II (11791100; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific).
PiggyBac-based expression plasmids for Cdh1, Cdh3 or Cdh6 were generated 
by PCR amplification of the respective genes in pENTR-Cdh1 (49776; Addgene), 
Cdh3 (Myc-DDK tagged) (MR227345; OriGene Technologies) or Cdh6 
(mouse-tagged ORF clone) (MG222740; OriGene Technologies) with the oligos 
listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Small interfering RNA. Cells were transfected with 25 nM small interfering 
RNA (siRNA) directed against Cdh1 (1027418-SI00946631), Cdh3 
(1027418-SI02666440) or Cdh6 (1027418-SI00946967) (Qiagen) siRNA or 
with control scrambled siRNA (Qiagen) using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection 
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were harvested at 72 h 
post-transfection and assayed by quantitative PCR (qPCR).
Flow cytometry analysis. Single ES and TS cell suspensions were collected, fixed 
in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature 
using 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.1% glycine. Cells were then incubated with 
anti-E-cadherin (1:200; 13-1900; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or P-cadherin antibody 
(1:100; sc-1501; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for overnight incubation at 4 °C in 
blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution plus Tween 20) (PBST) 
containing 10% FBS). Cells were washed twice in PBST and then incubated with 
secondary antibody (1:500 dilution) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 
1–2 h. Cells were then analysed by quantitative flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) 
and the intensity profiles of E- and P-cadherin were plotted using FlowJo software 
(version 10.7.1) (https://www.flowjo.com).
Cell doublets experiment. To measure cell–cell contact angles, 1200 dissociated 
ES, TS or XEN cells were mixed in pairs and seeded onto AggreWell plates (34411; 
STEMCELL Technologies) pretreated with rinsing solution (07010; STEMCELL 
Technologies). Cells were centrifuged at 100g for 3 min. After 1 h incubation at 
37 °C, cells were collected and fixed for immunostaining.
Cadherin-coated surface preparation. To measure the adhesion forces between 
cells and cadherin-coated surfaces, we followed a previous study49. Briefly, 
gold-coated glass cover slips (AU.0100; Platypus) were cleaned in argon plasma  
for 30 s and subsequently functionalized by immersion in thiol solution  
(P50757; Sigma–Aldrich) for 16 h, then rinsed with EDTA-buffer (15575-020; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove excess thiol. The cover slips were subsequently 
incubated with 10 μg ml−1 recombinant E-cadherin (8875-EC-050; R&D Systems) 
or P-cadherin (761-MP-050; R&D Systems) for 12 h at 4 °C. Before making force 
measurements, the cadherin-coated surfaces were washed with HEPES  
(15630106; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and activated by incubation in the same 
buffer for 30 min.
Adhesion force measurement. Cell–cell or cell–cadherin adhesion forces were 
measured using an atomic force microscope (Bruker NanoScope) coupled to 
a confocal microscope (TCS SP5II; Leica). Tipless silicon nitride cantilevers 
were V shaped, with nominal spring constants (60 pN nm−1; NP-0; Veeco 
Instruments). The atomic force microscope cantilevers were plasma cleaned before 
functionalization with concanavalin A, as described previously17,49. The system 
was calibrated in cell-free medium at 37 °C before each experiment by measuring 
the deflection sensitivity on a glass surface, allowing the cantilever spring constant 
to be determined in situ. Before loading the sample, the sample stage movement 
was calibrated using NanoScope software (version 6.13). Before measurements, 
cells were dissociated with TrypLE (12604013; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 
resuspended in HEPES-buffered cell culture medium (15630056; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Cell suspensions were loaded into the atomic force microscope sample 
chamber and a single cell was captured by pressing the cantilever onto the cell 
with a contact force of 500 pN for 1 min. The cell was lifted from the surface and 
allowed to establish firm adhesion on the cantilever for 5 min. To measure the 
cell–cell adhesion force, the captured cell was lowered to contact with another 
single cell cultured on a gelatin-coated glass-bottom Petri dish (FD35; WPI). 
To measure the cell–cadherin adhesion force, the captured cell was lowered to 
contact cadherin-coated cover slips. The approach and retraction speeds were 
kept constant at 10 μm s−1 with a contact force of 2 nN. Three force curves were 
acquired for each cell. The captured cell was left to recover for 3 min between 
different adhesion force measurement cycles before it was adhered to the surface 
in a different position. Before and after every single measurement, we checked that 
our probing cell remained on the cantilever by direct observation. Maximal cell 
adhesion forces as well as the single rupture force step height were extracted from 
retrace curves using JPK IP software.
Cell cortical stiffness measurements. The stiffness of cells was measured 
using an atomic force microscope (Bruker NanoScope) coupled to a confocal 
microscope (TCS SP5II; Leica), as described previously50,51. The point-and-shoot 
procedure (NanoScope software; Bruker) was used to measure cell stiffness. All 
cells were kept in CO2-independent cell culture medium during the measurement.

A fluorescent 10 μm polystyrene bead (Invitrogen) was glued to silicon nitride 
cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 0.06 N m−1 (NP-S type D; Bruker). 
Indentations were performed using the single force option with a total indentation 
depth of 50–100 nm. To obtain cell stiffness values from force curves, PUNIAS 
software was used as described previously50,51. Multiple force displacement curves 
(at five different locations) were fitted to the Hertz model to calculate cell cortical 
stiffness (Young’s modulus).
Stem cell-derived ETX embryo generation. ETX embryos were generated as 
described previously10. Approximately 6000–7000 ES cells, 15,000–19,000 TS cells 
and 5000–6000 XEN cells were added dropwise into AggreWell plates having 
1200 microwells in one well (34411; STEMCELL Technologies). The microwells 
were treated with rinsing solution (07010; STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were 
centrifuged at 100g for 3 min. 1.5 ml c-IDG medium containing 7.5 nM ROCK 
inhibitor (72304; STEMCELL Technologies) was added dropwise to each well. On 
the following day (day 1), 1 ml medium was removed gently from each well and 
replaced with 1 ml fresh c-IDG medium without ROCK inhibitor. This step was 
repeated once to fully remove the ROCK inhibitor. On day 2, 1 ml c-IDG medium 
was replaced with 1 ml fresh medium. On day 3, the media was replaced with IVC1 
medium10,24,52. IVC1 medium comprises advanced DMEM/F12 (21331-020; Gibco) 
supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) FBS, 2 mM GlutaMax, 1% vol/vol penicillin–
streptomycin, 1× ITS-X (51500-056; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 8 nM β-estradiol, 
200 ng ml−1 progesterone and 25 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine.
Immunofluorescence. Natural embryos, stem cell-derived structures or stem cells 
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (15710; Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 
20–30 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBST (containing 0.05% Tween 
20) and permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature in 0.3% Triton X-100 and 
0.1% glycine. Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C in 
blocking buffer (PBST containing 10% FBS). The following day, samples were 
washed twice in PBST and then incubated with secondary antibody (1:500) in 
blocking buffer at room temperature for 1–2 h. Embryos were transferred to PBST 
drops in oil-filled optical plates before confocal imaging.
The following primary antibodies were used: Tfap2c (1:200; AF5059; R&D 
Systems), Brachyury (1:200; AF2085; R&D Systems), Gata4 (1:500; 36966; Cell 
Signalling Technology), Laminin (1:500; L9393; Sigma–Aldrich), Oct4 (1:500; 
sc-5279; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), E-cadherin (1:200; 13-1900; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and P-cadherin (1:100; sc-1501 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or MS-1741 
(Fisher Scientific)). The following secondary antibodies from Thermo Fisher 
Scientific were used: Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-Mouse (1:500; A-21202), Alexa 
Fluor 488 Donkey anti-Goat (1:500; A-11055), Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey anti-Rat 
(1:500; A-21208), Alexa Fluor 568 Donkey anti-Rabbit (1:500; A-10042), Alexa 
Fluor 568 Donkey anti-Mouse (1:500; A-10037), Alexa Fluor 647 Donkey anti-Goat 
(1:500; A-21447) and Phalloidin (1:200; A30104). Detailed information of the used 
antibodies is provided in Supplementary Table 1.
RNA extraction and real-time qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells using 
TRIzol Reagent (15596-026; Invitrogen). Real-time qPCR was performed with 
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (4368708; Applied Biosystems) and StepOnePlus 
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The fold change in mRNA 
expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method with Gapdh as an endogenous 
control. For the qPCR primers used, see Supplementary Table 1.
scRNA-seq sample preparation and dissociation. Natural and ETX embryos were 
transferred to Falcon tubes, washed with PBS and incubated in TrypLE Express 
(12604013; Gibco) for 15 min at 37 °C to dissociate them into single cells. If clumps 
remained, the incubation was extended for an additional 5 min at 37 °C and the 
sample pipetted further. Samples were filtered to remove large clumps, centrifuged 
at 200g for 5 min and resuspended in PBST (containing 0.02% Tween 20) and 
then processed for encapsulation, as previously reported29,53. For E5.5 embryos, 
one litter of 12 embryos was dissociated together. A total of 15 ETX embryos were 
dissociated for sequencing. Cells in culture were dissociated into a single-cell 
suspension using TrypLE Express (12604013; Gibco) and multiplexed using 
MULTI-seq lipid-modified oligos before running on two 10X Genomics lanes 
using single-cell 3′ version 3 reagents as reported54.
scRNA-seq analysis. A previously submitted and filtered scRNA-seq dataset 
comprising the ETX and natural embryos was downloaded from the Gene 
Expression Omnibus repository (GSE161947)29. The count matrix was loaded 
into Seurat version 3 (ref. 55), the fraction of counts mapping to mitochondrial 
genes was computed and the object was then log-normalized to a scale factor of 
10,000. The 2,000 most variable genes were computed, the object was scaled and 
the percentage of mitochondrial counts was regressed out. Dimensional reduction 
was performed with principal component analysis and the data were projected 
on a uniform manifold approximation and projection low-dimensional space 
using 20 principal components. The embryonic, endoderm and trophectoderm 
lineage identity was pooled from previous annotations29, corresponding to 
clusters with high Dnmt3b, Gata4 and Lamb1 and Cdx2 and Gata2 expression 
levels, respectively. The average expression was computed using the average 
expression function and the latter was log2 normalized. The expression levels 
of cadherins and protocadherins were subsequently plotted on a heatmap. The 
uniform manifold approximation and projection plots were directly plotted 
using the methodology described recently29 after keeping the ETX and natural 
embryo samples only and re-computing the neighbourhood graph (five 
neighbours and 30 principal components; code at https://github.com/fhlab/
scRNAseq_inducedETX).
Time-lapse imaging. To perform time-lapse imaging, cells were seeded on Gri3D 
PEG-hydrogel dishes with glass bottoms (SUN Bioscience) and imaged under a 
spinning-disc microscope (3i) with a Zeiss EC Plan-NEOFLUAR 20×/0.5 objective 
in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The structures were imaged every 
5–10 min by collecting image stacks of 10 μm z-planes. Images were processed 
using SlideBook 5.0 (3i). Raw data were processed using the open-source image 
analysis software Fiji. For single-cell tracking, Imaris image analysis software 
(Bitplane) was used.
Quantification and statistical analysis. Criteria for selecting ETX embryos. 
Egg cylinder structures with one TS-derived compartment and one ES-derived 
compartment, covered by an outside XEN-derived visceral endoderm-like 
monolayer were considered to be well-sorted ETX embryos for analysis. Structures 
that did not fulfil these criteria were considered to be missorted ETX structures. 
Structures containing all three types of cells were collected and counted for 
quantification.
Image data acquisition, processing and quantification. Fluorescence images were 
acquired using an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope (LEICA software LAS 
X; Leica Microsystems) with a Leica FLUOTAR VISIR 25× or 40× objective. 
Images were acquired with 0.5–3.0 μm z-separation. To screen entire structures, 
the tile-scan imaging mode with automatic image stitching of the SP8 confocal 
microscope was used. All images were analysed and processed using Fiji software 
(http://fiji.sc). For digital quantifications and immunofluorescence signal intensity 
graphs, laser power and detector gain were maintained constant to permit 
quantitative comparisons of different experimental conditions within a  
single experiment.
To evaluate cell–cell contact angles in 3D ETX and natural embryos, 
ImSAnE13,14 was employed to extract planes of the embryos from 3D stacks of 
E-cadherin and unroll them into a two-dimensional projection. Different lineages 
were indicated by different nuclear markers during analysis. Geometric observables 
as well as general distortions in projections can be correctly quantified using 
built-in correction methods in MATLAB14.
Numerical simulations. CPM. A CPM15 was used to infer the predicted 
distributions of conformations given measurements of cell adhesion from AFM, as 
well as to determine the roles of cortical stiffness on the self-organization of ETX 
embryos. We parameterized adhesion strengths using cohesion forces between 
pairs of cell types, which were directly measured by AFM (Supplementary Table 2). 
For each simulation, we sampled this distribution to build the adhesion (J) matrix. 
Specifically, for a given element in this matrix, we sampled (with replacement) the 
set of AFM cohesion forces measured between pairs of cell types (for example, 
ES–ES, ES–TS and so on), performed around 500 times to establish an ensemble 
of J matrix samples. Each J matrix sample was used to perform a CPM simulation, 
generating an ensemble distribution of conformations over time. Simulations 
evolve via a stochastic minimization of an energy function (see equation (1) in 
the Supplementary Information) that accounts for both differential affinity and 
other physical properties of cells. Simulations were scored at each time point for 
being one of the 16 possible sorted configurations (Fig. 2i) by determining whether 
each cell type was enveloping and/or contiguous (see Supplementary Information 
for details). To test for the importance of softness in XEN cell externalization, we 
varied the cortical stiffness parameter for XEN cells (λXEN
P
) and repeated the above 
simulation procedure.
Statistics and reproducibility. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad 
Prism (versions 8.0 and 7.0a) software (with the exception of the analysis of 
sequencing data). Data with a Gaussian distribution were analysed using a 
two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test (two groups) or one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) (multiple groups) with Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Significant 
differences in the variance were taken into account using Welch’s correction. Data 
that did not have a Gaussian distribution were analysed using a Mann–Whitney 
U-test (two groups) or Kruskal–Wallis test (multiple groups) with Dunn’s multiple 
comparison test. For all quantifications, a minimum of three independent 
experiments were performed. The in vitro cell experiments were not randomized 
as it was not necessary. For experiments with chemical inhibitors, samples were 
randomly allocated to control and experimental groups. Embryos were randomly 
allocated to control and experimental groups for the in vivo experiments. 
Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the 
experiments. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes. 
Sample sizes were determined based on previous experimental experience. The 
sample sizes used to derive statistics are provided in each figure caption. No data
