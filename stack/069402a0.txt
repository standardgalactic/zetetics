Prof. Hann shows further that the probabilities of 
positive temperature variations at Greenwich and negative 
pressure variations at Stykkisholm, and vice versd, are o-83 
and o-85 respectively. 
In the case of the Azores he shows 
that a similar reversal with Stykkisholm occurs. 
Interest-
ing results are also obtained when he oonsiders the new 
station at Angmagsalik, in Greenland. 
THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION. 
THE annual meeting of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science was held at St. Louis on 
December 26, 1903, to January r. 
The address delivered 
by the president of the association, Prof. Ira Remsen, 
appeared in NATURE of January 28; and extracts from the 
addresses of presidents of some of the sections are given 
below. 
ATOMS AND ELEMENTS. 1 
Is matter oontinuous or discrete? argued the opposed 
schools of Grecian philosophy led by Leucippus, Democritus 
and Epicurus, and dominated by Aristotle. 
Despite the 
clarity of the statements of the Roman Lucretius,' the 
atomic hypothesis received scant attention until the seven-
teenth century of the Christian era, when Galileo 's experi-
mental 
science 
assailed 
Aristotelian 
metaphysics 
and 
demanded verification of the premises of that philosophy 
which had governed all the schools of Europe for two 
thousand years. 3 
While Gassendi, Boyle, Descartes, New-
ton, perhaps Boscovich, Lavaisier, Swedeborg, Richter, 
Fischer and Higgins had to do with our modern atomic 
theory, Dalton one hundred years ago " created a working 
tool of extraordinary power and usefulness " in the laws of 
definite and multiple proportions. 
As Clarke 4 remarked, 
" Between the atom of Lucretius and the Daltonian atom 
the kinship is very remote." Although the lineage is direct, 
the work of Berzelius, Gmelin and others; the laws of 
Faraday, Gay Lussac, Avogadro, Dulong and Petit; the 
reformations of Laurent and Gerhardt, but particularly 
Cannizzaro; the systematisations of de Chancourtois, New-
lands1 Hinrichs, Mende!t\eff and Lothar Meyer; the stereo-
chemrstry of van 't Hoff and Le Bel have imperialised the 
ideas of the Manchester phi!Dsopher, so that the conceptions 
of the oonservative atomists of to-day are quite different 
from those at the beginning of the closed century. 5 
The Da!tonian ideas had scarcely reached adolescence 
before Prout (rSrs), giving heed tD the figures concerned, 
would have all the elements compounded of hydrogen. 
The 
classical atomic mass values obtained by sympathetic Stas 
and the numerous investigations of those who followed him 
with all the refinements human ingenuity has been able 
devise, temporarily silenced such speculations but not until 
Marignac had halved the unit, Dumas had quartered .it, 
and Ziingerle, as late as r882, insisted upon the one 
thousandth hydrogen atom. 
Th; notion, like Banquo's ghost, will ever up, for if one 
may judge from the probability calculations of Mallet (Phil. 
Tratls., clxxi., 1003, r88r) and Strutt (Phil. Mag., (6), i., 
JII), a profound truth underlies the now crude hypothesis. 
Crookes (Chem. News, lv., 83, r886), from observations 
made during prolonged and painstaking fractionations of 
certain of 
the rare earths, 
supported 
his 
previously 
announced " provisional hypothesis " as to the genesis of 
the elements from a hypothetical protyle, which existed when 
the universe was without form and void. 
He designated 
those intermediate entities, like yttrium, gadolinium and

Urstoff; fire mist, protyle, the ultra-
gaseous form, the fourth state of matter (Crookes, Royal. 
Societies, June ro, 
r88o) was condensed by a process 
analogous to cooling; in short, the elements were created. 
The rate of the cooling and irregular condensation produced 
" the atavism of the elements," and this caused the form-
ation Df the natural families of the periodic system. 
Marignac (Archives des 
Physiques et Naturelles, 
17-5; Chemical News, !vi., 39), criticising this hypothesis, 
states :-" I have always admitted 2 the impossibility of 
accounting for the curious relations which are manifested 
between the atomic weights of the elements, except by the 
hypothesis of a general method of formation according to-
definite though unknown laws; rven when these relations 
have the character of general ant absolute laws." 
Further, " I do not the less ackn wledge that the effect of 
constant association of these elemen s is one of, the strongest 
proofs that can be found nf the co 1munity of their origin. 
Besides, it is not an isolated fact 
we can find other ex-
amples such as the habitual association in minerals of 
tantalum, niobium, and titanium." 
The peculiar discharge from the negative electrodes of a 
vacuum tube was investigated many years ago by Hittorf 
and Crookes, who arrived at the conclusion that it was 
composed of streams of charged particles. 
All are familiar 
with the very recent proposed " electrons " 
and " cnr-
puscles " resulting from the beautiful physical researches 
of Lodge and J. J. ThDmson. These appear to have caused 
a trembling in the belief of many in the immutability of the 
atom, and the complete abandonment of the atom is seriously 
discussed bv others. 
Although- by chemical means, so far, we have be n unable 
to break up the atoms, apparently electrical energy, in the 
form of kathode rays, for example, follows the grain of 
atomic structure. 
Some advanced thinkers look upon the 
atoms as disembodied charges of electricity. Ostwald has 
taught it. 
Electric charges are known only as united to 
matter, yet Johnstone Stoney and Larmor, have speculated 
on the properties of such charges isolated. 
" Such a charge 
is inertia, even though attached to no matter, and the in-
crease of ine,-tia of a body due to electrification has been 
calculated by both Thomson and Oliver Heaviside, the con--
ception accordingly being advanced that all inertia is 
electrical, and that matter, as we know it, is built up of 
interlocked positive and negative electrons. If it were 
possible in any mass of matter to separate these electrons 
then matter would disappear and there would remain merely 
two enormous charges of electricity." 
We are aware of 
phenomena attributed to the negative electrons; we await 
anxiously the announcement of the po'sitive electrons. 
We do know, however, as A. A. Noyes says, that " there 
exists in the universe some thing or things other than matter 
which, by associatiDn with it, give rise to the changes in 
properties which bodies exhibit, and give them power of 
producing changes in the properties of other bodies." 
Shall we say, as does Remsen, " An element is a substance· 
made up of atoms of the same kind? " 
Can we say that 
it is. not? Venable (the " De-finition of the Element," Am. 
Chemist, r875, 23) truly says: "An element is best defined' 
by means of its properties." These conceits are not ex-
clusive. 
The properties are the result of the action of 
physical forces and chemical affinity, whatever that may be. 
Certain of the novel atmospheric gases have so far re-
sponded but poorly to the latter, as predicted before their 
discovery by Flawitzsky, Julius Thomsen and de Boisbaudran 
in r887. 
The following simpler definition has finally served as my 
guide : An elemeHt is that which has not been decomposed, 
so far as we are aware, iHto 
other than itself. 
In 
short, it is consistent. 
We have decided to define an element by its properties. 
The alterations produced in the properties of the most 
characteristic elements by the presence of small amounts of 
foreign substances are evident in steel. The influence of 
arsenic upon the conductivity of copper is well known, and 
Le Bon (Compt. retld., cxxxi., 706, 1900) has recently shown

that traces of magnesium (one part in 14,ooo) in mercury 
cause the latter to decompose water and to oxidise rapidly 
in the air at ordinary temperatu·res. 
Thorium with less 
than a trace of actinium produces an auto-photograph. 
This point cannot be too strongly stressed in the rare 
earth field. 
One who has wrought with thorium dioxide 
well knows the influence a small amount o.f ceri'llm has upon 
solubility. The conflicting statements in the lite·rature 
as to the colours of the oxides of the complexes, neodidy-
mium and prreseodidymium, cause one to wonder if different 
researchers have had the same hreccei ty. 
An appeal to the spectroscope is, of course, in the minds 
of all my hearers. 
Grunwald, in a series of papers on his theory of spectrum 
analysis, 
1 endeavours " to discover relations between the 
·spectra and thus to arrive at simpler, if not fundamental 
., elements.' " 
He came t-o the conclusion that " all the 
·so-called elements are compounds of the primary elements a 
. and b " (coronium and helium). 
Ames (Am. Chern. ]., 
xi., 138, 1889), having directed attention to the use of 
•uncorrected data by Grunwald, remarks : " The concave 
grating gives the only accurate method of determining the 
ultra-violet wave-lengths of the elements; and as a con-
sequence of not using it, most of the tables of wave-lengths 
so far published are not of much value." 
Lockyer maintained that the lines of certain brilliant 
vary not only in length and in number, but also 
111 bnlhancy and in breadth, depending upon the quantity 
of_ the substance as well as temperature (Roy. Soc. Proc., 
lx1., 148, 183; Chem. News, lxxix., 145). 
Being unable to 
decompose the eleA'lents in the laboratory, he studied the 
.spectra of the stars. The spectra of the colder stars show 
many more metals, but no metalloids, whereas the coldest 
stars show the Crookes spectrum of metalloids which 
are compounds; none of the metalloids are found in 
the spectrum of the sun. 
More than 100 ooo visual 
observations and 2000 photographs were 
in the 
resea!'ches. 
Without doubt the spectroscopic criteria are the most 
valuable we have in judging finally the elements 
and 
mayhap will remain ;;o. but in my liumble opinion: such 
hav_e not alone suffictent authority, as yet, to usher the 
asptrant to a place among the elect. The contention frames 
1tself, however , in an expression o·f the need for uniformity. 
Whether we follow the most advanced metaphysico-
chemical teachings or no, if there be a ny one ·concept upon 
which modern practical chemical thought depends, it is the 
1aw of definiteness of composition. 
There may be, and 
-doubtless are, definite, perhaps invariabl·e, properties of our 
ele?lents ?ther than their combining proportions, the atomic 
w etghts, tf you please, yet, so far as we know, they approxi-
ma te more closely than any fixed, if not permanent, ratios. 
Many of these values, by which we lay such store are de-
pendent upon data in which, I venture the assertion, too 
great_ 
has been bestowed, or opinions to which 
suf!ictent attenhon has not been given. 
As hinted at in the earli.er porti-on of this unduly prolonged 
a ddress, many have theonsed as to the ultimate composition 
of matter. The logic of Larmor's (Phil. Mag., December, 
1897. 506) theory, involving the idea of an ionic substratum 
of matter, the support of J. J. Thomson's (Phil. Mag.,

associated and have to do with the eventual composition of 
matter. 
I have unverified observations which go to show 
the existence of at least one element with a very high atomic 
weight. If it be confirmed, then we have them now or they 
are making, and probably breaking up, as shown by that 
marvellous class of elements in the discovery' of which the 
Curies have been pioneers. 
If our ideas that all known elements come from some 
primordial material be true, then it stands to reason that 
we are coming in time, perhaps, to that fixed thing, a frozen 
ether, the fifth state of matter. 
I may make use of 
dangerous analogy and liken our known elements, arranged 
in a perfected na tural system, to the visible material spec-
trum, while electrons, &c., constitute the ultra-violet and 
cosmyle composes the infra-red, either one of the latter by 
proper conditions being convertible into perceptible elemental 
matter . 
THE SCOPE OF GEOGRAPHY. 2 
The essential in geography is a relation between the 
elements of terrestrial environment and the items of organic 
response ; this being only a modernised extension of Ritter's 
view. 
Everything that involves such a relationship is to 
that extent geographic. 
Anything in which such a relation-
ship is wanting is to that extent not geographic. The loca-
tion of a manufacturing village at a point where a stream 
affords water-power is an example of the kind of relation 
that is meant, and if this example is accepted, then the 
reasonable principle of continuity will guide us to include 
under geography every other example in which the way 
that organic forms have of doing things is conditioned by 
their inorganic environment. 
The organic part of geo-
graphy must not be limited to man, because the time is 
now past when man is studied altogether apart from the 
other forms of life on the earth. The colonies of ants on 
our western deserts, with their burrows, their hills, their 
roads and their threshing floors, 
exhibit responses to 
elements of environment found in soil and climate as clearly 
as a manufacturing village exhibits a response to water-
power. The different coloration of the dorsal and ventral 
parts of fish is a response to the external illumination of our 
non-luminous earth. The word arrive 
is 
a 
persistent 
memorial of the importance long ago attached to a success-
ful crossing of the shore line that separates sea and land. 
It is hot significant whether the relation and the elements 
that enter into it are of easy or difficult understanding, nor 
whether they are what we call important or unimportant, 
familiar or unfamiliar. The essential quality of geography 
is that it involves relations of things organic and inorganic; 
and the entire content of geography would include all such 
relations. 
Thus defined, geography has two chief divisions. 
Every-
thing about the earth or any inorganic part of it, considered 
as an element of the environment by which the organic in-
habitants are conditioned, belongs under physical geography 
or physiography.' 
Every item in which the organic in-
habitants of the earth-plant, animal or man-show a re-
sponse to the elements of environment, belongs under 
organic geography. Geography proper involves a consider-
ation of relations in which the things that belong under its 
two divisions are involved. 
Geography is, therefore, not simply a description of places; 
it is not simply an acx:ount of the earth and of its inhabitants, 
each described independently of the other; it involves a rela-
tion of some element of physical geography to some item of 
organic geography, and nothing from which this relation 
is absent possesses the essential quality of geographical 
discipline. The location of a cape or of a city is an elemen-
tary fact which may be built up with other facts into a 
relation of full geographic meaning; but taken alone, it has 
about the same rank in geography that spelling has in 
language. 
A map has about the same place in geography

that a dictionary has in literature. 
The mean annual 
temperature of a given station, and the occurrence of a 
certain plant in a certain locality, are facts of kinds that 
must enter extensively into the relationships with which 
geography deals; but these facts, standing alone, are want-
ing in the essential quality of mature geographical science. 
Not only so; many facts of these kinds may, when treated 
in other relations, enter into other sciences; for it is not so 
much the thing that is studied as the relation in which it is 
studied that determines the science to which it belongs. 
There can be no just complaint of narrowness in a science 
that has charge of all the relations among the elements of 
terrestrial environment and the items of organic response. 
Indeed, the criticism usually made upon the subject thus 
defined is, as has already been po·inted out, that it is too 
broad , too vaguely limited and too much concerned with all 
s.orts of things to have suffici·ent unity and coherence for a 
real science. 
Some persons, indeed, object that geography 
has no right to existence as a separate science; that it is 
chiefly a compound of parts of other sciences ; but if it be 
defined as concerned with the relationships that have been 
just specified, these objections have little force. 
It is true, 
indeed, that the things with which geography must deal are 
dealt with in other sciences as well, but this is also the case 
with 
astronomy, 
physics, 
chemistry, 
geology, 
botany, 
zoology, history, economics, and other sciences. 
There is no 
subject .of study the facts of which are independent of all 
other subjects; not only are the same things studied under 
different sciences, but every science employs some of the 
methods and results of other sciences. 
The individuality of 
a science depends not on its having to do with things that 
are cared for by no other science, or on its employing 
methods that are used in no other science, but on its study-
ing these things and employing these methods in order to 
gain its own well-defined object. 
Chemistry, for example, 
is concerned with the study of material substances in re· 
lation to their constitution, but it constantly and most 
properly employs physical and mathematical methods in 
reaching its ends. 
Botanists and zoologists are much 
interested in the chemical composition and physical action 
of plants and animals, because the facts of composition and 
action enter s.o largely into the understanding of plants and 
animals considered as living beings. 
Overlappings of the 
kind thus indicated are common enough, and geography, as 
well as other sciences, exhibits them in abundance. 
It may 
be that geography has a greater amount of overlapping than 
any other science; but no valid objection to its content can 
be made on that ground ; the maximum of overlapping must 
occur in one science or another-there can be no discredit 
to the science on that account. 
Geography has to do with 
rocks the origin of which is studied in geology ; with the 
currents of the atmosphere, the processes of which exemplify 
general laws that are studied in physics; with plants and 
animals, the forms and manner of !!rowth of which are the 
first care of the botanist and zoologist; and with man, 
whose actions recorded in order of time occupy the historian ; 
but the particular point of view from which the geographer 
studies aU these things makes them as much his own 
property as they are the property of anyone else. 
SOME UNSOLVED PROBLEMS OF ORGANIC ADAPTATION.' 
The recent impulse which has come to biologic progress 
by experimental methods, and the remarkable results which 
have been attained thereby, may without exaggeration be 
said to have raised anew many an earlier doubt as weU as 
brought to light problems apparently beyond the scope of 
the older explanations. 
It may not, therefore, be an ex-
travagant assumption to announce the entire question -of 
organic adaptations as open for reconsideration, in the light 
of which no apology will be necessary for directing atten-
tion .to certain phases of the subject upon the present 
occasiOn. 
Among the many problems which recent investigations 
and conclusions have brought into better perspective as well 
as sharper 
which might profitably be dis-
cussed, the 
of a smgle address preclude any very wide 
?f 
I have, therefore, chosen to restrict my 
d1scusston ch1efly to problems of coloration among lower 
1 Apridged 
.an address de!ivered before tbe Section of Zoology of the 
Amencan A:tsOClatlon by Prof. C. W. Hargitt. 
NO. 1791, VOL. 69l 
invertebrates, including incidental references to correlated! 
subjects, and the probable limitations of colour as a facoor 
in organic adaptation. 
As is perfectly well known, colour in nature is due to one 
of two causes, or to a combination of both, namely, (r) 
what has been termed optical or structural conditions, such. 
as diffraction, interference or unequal reflection of light, 
examples of which are familiar in the splendid hues of the 
rainbow, the iridescent sheen and metallic colours of the 
feathers of many birds, wings of insects, &c. 
(2) \Vhat are· 
known as pigmentary colours, due to certain material sub-
stances lodged within the tissues of animals or plants which 
have the property of absorbinf$ certain elements of light 
and of reflecting others, and thereby producing the sensa-
tion of oolour. 
While the two are physically quite distinct 
it is not unusual to find them associated in producing some· 
of the most exquisite colour e.ffects of which we have know-
ledge. 
In a general way one may usually distinguish. 
between these two sorts of colour by noting that those 
which are purely optical in their character produce a con-
stantly changing impression as the relative position of 
object or observer may happen to vary with reference to the 
angle and direction of light; while, upon the other hand, 
colours which are due to pigments show this property very 
slightly or not at all, and that, moreover,- pigment colours 
are usually more or less soluble in various reagents, such as 
alcohol, ether, acids, alkalies, &c., and that they often fade 
rapidly under the influence of strong light or in its absence, 
or upon the death of the organism . 
The work of Krukenburg, MacMun, Macallum, M'Ken-· 
dric, Hopkins, Urech, Eisig, Cunningham, and a host of 
others, comprising a mass of literature of enormous pro-
portions, will be available to those interested, and may 
afford some faint conception of the magnitude and import-
ance of the field to be explored, as well as an introduction 
to that already made available. 
And while as a result of 
this activity many and various organic pigments have been 
isolated and their composition in part or entirely made 
known, it must be recognised that the task of the chemical 
analysis of any such highly complex compounds as most of 
these are known to be is attended with extreme difficulty 
and no small measure of uncertainty. 
StilJ, it has been 
possible fairly to distinguish several classes of such pig-
ments, differentiated physiologically as follows :-
(I) Those directly serviceable in the vital processes of the 
organism. 
Under this head may be classed such pigments 
as hremoglobin, chlorophyll, zoonerythrin, chlorocruorin, and 
perhaps others less known. 
It need not be emphasised that 
by far the most important of these are the two first named. 
The others, found chiefly among the lower invertebrates, are 
believed to serve a function similar to the first. 
(2) Waste products. Among these the several biliary pro-
ducts are too well known to call for special note. 
Guanin 
is a pigment of common occurrence in the skin of certain 
fishes, and is associated with the coloration of· the species. 
Similarly certain colouring matters have been found in the 
pigments of many Lepidoptera, known as lepidotic acid, a 
substance closely allied to uric acid, and undoubtedly o.f the 
nature of a waste product. 
(3) Rese.rve products. 
Of these there are several series, 
one of wh1ch, known as lipochrome pigments, is associated 
with the metabolism involved i'n the formation of fats and 
oils. 
Perhaps of similar character are such pigments as. 
carmine, or rather cochineal, melanin, &c. 
It may be some-
what doubtful whether these pigments do not rather belong 
to the previous class, where should probably be listed such 
products as hrematoxylin, indigo, &c., all of which have been 
claimed as resultants of destructive metabolism in process of 
being eliminated from the physiologically active tissues of 
the body of the organism. 
Of similar character is probably 
tannic acid, . a substance well known among plant products 
and involved in the formation of many of the brownish and 
rusty 
of autumn foliage, particularly of the oaks 
and allted trees, as are the lipochromes in the formation of 
the reds and yellows which form so conspicuou·s a feature 
among autumn colours. 
While the association of these and other pigmentary 
matters has long been known in connection with both 
animal and plant growth, and while the conception of their· 
more or less intimate relation to the active metabolism of 
the various tissues is not new, compa.ra.tively little has beetl>

done toward directly investigating and elucidating the exact 
nature and extent of the process. This seems to be especially 
the case in relation to the part played by these products in 
the formation of those features of coloration among 
organisms with which we are now concerned. 
From considerations of researches connected with various 
organisms three things seem to be more or less evident :-
(I) That in all regenerative processes a very marked 
degree of metabolism is involved, whether in the mere meta-
morphosis of .old tissues into new, or in the dkect regener-
ation of new tissues by growth processes, both of which 
seem to occur. 
(2) That in regenerative processes there is often associated 
the development of pigmentary substances which seem to 
have no direct function in relation thereto. 
(3) That in many cases there follows a more or less active 
excretion and elimination of portions of the pigment in 
question. 
In the present review I have not in the least sought to 
ignore or discredit the value of natural selection as a factor 
in organic evolution. 
Nnr would Ibe understood as wholly 
discarding colour as a factor in organic adaptation, pa,rticu-
lariy among the higher and more specialised forms, but 
rather to show its limits. 
At the same time I must submit 
to a growing conviction that its importance has been largely 
overestimated, and that other factors have been as largely 
lost sight of. If the present discussion may serve in even 
the smallest degree to direct attention to some of the latter 
it will have served its chief purpose.

THE 
Education 
Committee 
O<f 
the Manchester City

gr;mt of 4oool. be given from the city rates in aid of the 
University of Manchester. 
IT is announced in Science that Prof. John Hays Ham-
mond has added Io,ooo!. to his previous gift of Io,ooo!. for. 
a metallurgical laboratory of Yale University, and that by 
the will of the late James A. Woolson Boston University 
will ultimately receive I2o,ooo!., Radcliffe College 6o,oool., 
and the Wesleyan Academy at Wilbraham, Mass., 6o,oool. 
MR. P. N. RussELL, who for many years carried on 
extensive engineering works in Sydney, but has latterly 
resided in London, has made a further donation· of so,oool. 
for an additional endowment to the School of Engineering 
at the University of Sydney. 
Mr. Russell originated this 
school about seven years ago by an endowment of so,oool. 
LORD KELVIN will distribute the prizes at the North-
ampton Institute, London,. on Friday, February z6.

THE annual report of the Carnegie Trust for the 
versities of Scotland was submitted to the trustees at their 
third annual meeting, which was held in London on Friday 
last. The report states that the scheme of allocation for 
five years of an annual grant of 4o,oool. among the four 
Scottish universities became operative on January I, I903. 
Of the grant for the year ended December 3I, I90J, sums 
amounting -to 20,325!. have been claimed and handed over. 
One ·chair has been founded and its first occupant appointed 
NO. 1791, VOL. 69] 
-the Burnett Fletcher chair of history and archmology in 
the University of Aberdeen. 
Of the sum of zo,oool. re-
quired for the endowment of this chair, donations amount-
ing to about I2,oool. have been received from the Burnett 
trustees, Mrs. Fletcher, and others. The ordinance insti· 
tuting a chair of geology in the University of Glasgow has 
been approved by Parliament, and it is expected that a pro-
fessor will be appointed before n·ext winter session, when 
the accumulations in hand of the annual grant of zoool. 
assignedtowards the endowment of this chair will be avail-
able, together with such portion of the future annual grants 
as may .be needed to complete the endowment fund of 
IS,oool., half of which is provided by the Bellahouston 
trustees and others. 
In the University of St. Andrews two 
lectureships-in French and in botany-have been estab-
lished, each with an endowment of w,oool. 
Under the 
scheme of endowment of post-graduate study and research 
the committee has made the first awards. 
The estimated 
outlay under this head for the academic year I903-4 is 
3524!., of which the sum of I828Z. was expended within 
the year I903. 
The committee has entered into an agree-
ment with the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh 
by which the trust has purchased the property and labor-
atory of the college in Forrest Road, Edinburgh, for 
ro,oool., 
on 
the understanding that 
the 
College 
of 
Physicia_ns and the CoUege of Smgeons continue their pre-
sent annual contributions of 750!. and zool. respectively to 
the working of the laboratory. 
THE second annual 'report of the executive committee in 
connection with the fund for advanced universitv educa-
tion and research at University College, London, 
pre-
sented at the annual general meeting of the members of 
the college on February 24. 
It wiJI be remembered that 
the two main purposes of the fund are :-(I) to raise the 
sum of 20o,oool. to bring about the incorpo·ration of Uni-
versity CoJlege in the University of London, and thus to 
promote the unification of university studies in London; 
(2) To provide the sum necessary to equip and endow Uni-
versity College adequately for its work as an integral part 
of the University of London. 
For this purpose it was 
estimated that a capital sum of. Soo,oool. was required, or 
an income corresponding to such capital sum. 
For the first 
of these purposes the committee has raised I4I,oool., leaving 
a balance of 59,oool. necessary to enable the conditions of 
incorporation to be fulfiJled. 
Since August 3I, I903, a most 
important addition has been .made to the fund owing to 
the munificence of an anonymous donor, who, through Pmf. 
E. H. Starling, F.R.S., and Dr. Page May, promised the 
sum of so,oool. 
This sum, together with additional sub-
scriptions received since the date mentioned, brings the total 
amount raised up to I67,287l., of which I4I,oo01. is avail-
able for the purpose of incorporation and the. balance of 
26,oool. for the endowment and equipment of the coJlege. 
It will be seen that while considerable progr,ess has been 
made, much remains to be done to realise the whole scheme. 
It is desirable that the remainder of the money necessary 
for incorporation should be raised without delay in order 
to make it possible for a Bill to be introduced in the House 
of Commons next session. The report of the council of 
University College presented on the same occasion contains, 
in addition to fuJI financial statements for the year I902-
rgo3, an exhaustive list. of original papers and other publi-
cations .completed by members of the staff of the college 
during the same period, and also particulars of the post-
graduate courses of lectures and laboratory work during 
tlw present session. 
THE secretaries of the Royal Society have addressed a 
letter to the Vice-Chancellor of the· University of Oxford 
directing attention to a resolution adopted by the president 
and council of the Royal Society :-" That the universities 
be respectfully urged to consider the desirability of taking 
such steps in respect of their regulations as will, as far as 
possible, ensure that a knowledge of science is recognised 
in schools and. ,elsewhere as an essential part o.f general 
education." Enclosed with the. letter was a statement re-
garding scientific education in schools, drawn up by a com-
mittee nf the Royal Sodety, and both are printed in. the 
Oxford University Gazette. The statement points out. that 
"it ·still remains subs:tantiaJly true that the public schools 
have devised for themselves no adequate way of assimilating
