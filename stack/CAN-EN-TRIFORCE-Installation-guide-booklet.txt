Canadian 
Edition

Storage and Handling
1.	 Keep TRIFORCE ® open joist 
bundles wrapped until the 
time of installation to protect 
them from bad weather.
2.	 Use wood filler to 
separate bundles.
3.	 Always store, stack and 
handle TRIFORCE® open 
joist vertically and level—
never flat.
4.	 Do not store TRIFORCE® 
open joist in direct contact 
with the ground.
5.	 Be cautious when using 
forklift to avoid damage. If 
the ground is uneven in the 
storage area, reduce forklift 
speed to avoid “bouncing” 
the load.
6.	 When handling with a crane, 
use a spreader to pick up 
the load, if necessary, to 
minimize handling stresses. 
Keep TRIFORCE® open 
joist vertical.
7.	 Maintain stack height within 
safe limits.
8.	 Handling of TRIFORCE® open 
joists with a crane or forklift 
should be done by lifting 
from below the bottom of 
the bundle.
9.	 Do not stack other material 
on top of TRIFORCE® open 
joist bundles.
10.	 Bundle wrap can be slippery, 
especially when wet or icy. 
Avoid walking on material.
Installation Instructions
1.	 Except for trimming the joist 
length on the OSB end panel, 
chords should never be cut, 
drilled or notched.
2.	 Install TRIFORCE® open 
joist so that top and bottom 
flanges are within 1/2" of 
true vertical alignment.
3.	 Joists must be restrained at 
the ends to prevent rollover.
4.	 Apply concentrated loads 
only on top flanges. Do not 
suspend concentrated loads 
from bottom flanges, except 
for light loads such as ceiling 
fans or light fixtures.
5.	 TRIFORCE® open joists 
must be protected from bad 
weather prior to installation.
6.	 Joists should be used in dry 
conditions only.
7.	 Never install a damaged 
TRIFORCE® open joist.
8.	 If optional strongbacks are 
installed, they must be made 
of dry lumber.
9.	 End bearing must be a 
minimum of 1 ½". Placement 
Guide may specify 
longer bearings.
10.	 To transfer a vertical load 
applied above the joist to a 
bearing, it may be necessary 
to add a rim board, squash 
blocks or blocking panels.
11.	 Joists must not be in direct 
contact with masonry 
or concrete.
12.	 DO NOT WALK ON JOISTS 
until properly braced. Serious 
injury may occur.
13.	 DO NOT PILE construction 
materials on joists until they 
are fully installed, braced and 
have subfloor installed.
14.	 When nailing into the joist 
flange, nails must be spaced 
at least 2 ½" o.c.
15.	 Details on the following 
pages show only the 
installation requirements 
specific to TRIFORCE® 
open joists. For other 
installation requirements, 
refer to the bulding code or 
manufacturers' instructions.
16.	 Adhesives used for floor 
systems should comply with 
ASTM D3498-03 Standard 
Specification for Field-Gluing 
Plywood to Lumber Framing 
for Floor Systems. When 
gluing the subfloor to the 
joists, follow the instructions 
of the adhesive manufacturer.

Not permitted
Never notch, cut or drill a joist member.

Joist Orientation
Each TRIFORCE® open 
joist is marked to indicate 
a bottom flange. In order 
to achieve maximum 
shear capacity, the joist 
should be installed with 
proper orientation.

Standard Details
This section provides standard details for normal framing situations. For loads that are not 
uniformly distributed and/or for joists supported by bearings other than end bearings, joist 
capacity must be verified using the manufacturer's Analyzer software.
The project designer and/or general contractor is responsible for determining if standard 
details apply.
