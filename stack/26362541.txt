 UNIVERSALITY OF CUTOFF FOR THE ISING MODEL
 By Eyal Lubetzky and Allan Sly
 New York University and University of California, Berkeley
 On any locally-finite geometry, the stochastic Ising model is known to
 be contractive when the inverse-temperature ß is small enough, via classic
 results of Dobrushin and of Holley in the 1970s. By a general principle pr
 posed by Peres, the dynamics is then expected to exhibit cutoff. However,
 far cutoff for the Ising model has been confirmed mainly for lattices, he
 ily relying on amenability and log Sobolev inequalities. Without these, cuto
 was unknown at any fixed ß > 0, no matter how small, even in basic examp
 such as the Ising model on a binary tree or a random regular graph.
 We use the new framework of information percolation to show that, in
 any geometry, there is cutoff for the Ising model at high enough temper
 tures. Precisely, on any sequence of graphs with maximum degree d, the Isi
 model has cutoff provided that ß < K/d for some absolute constant k (a res
 which, up to the value of k, is best possible). Moreover, the cutoff locatio
 is established as the time at which the sum of squared magnetizations dro
 to 1, and the cutoff window is 0(1), just as when ß = 0.
 Finally, the mixing time from almost every initial state is not more than a
 factor of 1 + Eß faster then the worst one (with ep ->■ 0 as ß -*■ 0), wher
 the uniform starting state is at least 2 - eß times faster.
 1. Introduction. Classical results going back to Dobrushin [12] an
 [15] in the early 1970s and continuing with the works of Dobrushin
 [13] and of Aizenman and Holley [1] show that, if G is any graph 
 with maximum degree d, the Glauber dynamics for the Ising model
 a rapid convergence to equilibrium in total-variation distance at hig
 peratures. Namely, if the inverse-temperature ß is at most cq/cI for
 co > 0, then the continuous-time dynamics is contractive, whence 
 niques show that the total-variation mixing time is O(logn).
 A known consequence of contraction is that the spectral gap of th
 bounded away from 0, and so, by a general principle proposed by 
 (addressing whether or not the product of the spectral gap and mixing t
 with n), one expects the cutoff phenomenon1 to occur. (For more

 the Ising model on any sequence of transitive graphs when the mixing tim
 O(logtt), and in particular in the range ß < co/d as above.
 This universality principle, whereby cutoff should accompany high enough
 peratures in any underlying geometry, is supported by the heuristic that at 
 enough ß the model should qualitatively behave as if ß = 0. The latter, equiva
 to random walk on the hypercube, was one of the first examples of cutoff,
 lished with an 0(l)-cutoff window by Aldous [2], and refined in [4, 8]. Thu
 may further expect cutoff for the Ising model with an 0(l)-window provide
 ß is small enough.
 In contrast, cutoff for the Ising model has so far mainly been confirmed 
 [22,23], via proofs that hinged on log-Sobolev inequalities (see [5,9,10, 32]) 
 are known to hold for the Ising model on the lattice [16, 26-29, 34, 35] as w
 on the subexponential growth rate of balls in the lattice.
 Even before requiring these powerful log-Sobolev inequalities, the restri
 to subexponential growth rate automatically precluded the analysis of examp
 basic as the Ising model on a binary tree at any small ß > 0, or on an expan
 graph (e.g., a random regular graph), the hypercube, etc.
 Here, using the framework of information percolation that we introduced in t
 companion paper [25], we confirm that on any sequence of graphs with max
 degree d, cutoff indeed occurs whenever ßd is small enough, and with an 0
 window (just as when ß = 0). Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the in
 state on the mixing time (e.g., a warm start of i.i.d. spins versus the all-plus star
 state).

 temperature there is cutoff within an 0(l)-window around the point

 0 < e < 1 and large enough n, the continuous-time heat-bath Glauber dynam
 for the Ising model on G with inverse-temperature 0 < ß < ic/d satisfies
 ^mix(1 — b) > — Clog(l/e),
 ^mix(£) 5 + Clog(l/e).
 In particular, on any sequence of such graphs the dynamics has cutoff with
 0(1)-window around tm.
 Apart from giving a first proof of cutoff for the Ising model on any tree/expa
 graph at ß > 0, note that the above theorem allows the maximum degree d t
 depend on n in any way, and so it applies, for example, to the Ising model on
 hypercube (with d = log2 n), a dense Erdôs-Rényi graph Q(n, |), etc.
 As mentioned above, the proof uses the new information percolation fram
 work, which analyzes interactions between spins viewed as a percolation pro
 in the space-time slab. As opposed to the application of this method in the 
 panion paper [25] for the torus, various obstacles arise in the present setting 
 to the asymmetry between vertices and lack of amenability. Moreover, a naiv
 plication of the method would require ß to be as small as about d~d, and carry
 it up to K/d (the correct dependence in d up to the value of k) required sev
 novel ingredients, notably using a discrete Fourier expansion (see Section 4.2
 prescribe update rules for the dynamics that would endow the resulting percol
 clusters with a subcritical behavior.
 Roughly put, the framework considers the dynamics at a designated time around
 tm, and for each site develops the history of updates that led to its final spin (tracing
 back branching to its neighbors). The resulting "information percolation" clusters
 in the space-time slab are then categorized into three types:—Red (those surviving
 to time zero and nontrivially depending on the initial state), Blue (those remain
 ing which involve a unique "ancestor") and GREEN (all remaining clusters), as
 illustrated in Figure 1. The green clusters (which may exhibit complicated depen
 dencies but are independent of the initial state) are taken out of the equation via
 conditioning, leaving behind a competition between blue clusters (whose ances
 tor vertices are i.i.d. uniform spins by symmetry) and red clusters. Controlling the
 latter, namely an exponential moment of their cumulative size, then establishes
 mixing.
 Overall, the information percolation framework allows one to reduce challeng
 ing problems involving mixing and cutoff for the Ising model into simpler and
 tractable problems on subcritical percolation.
 It is natural to ask about extension such as boundary conditions, external fields
 or other spin systems. While the present arguments makes use of the symmetry
 between plus and minus spins in the Ising model, we expect that the results should
 generalize to the case of boundary conditions or external fields. Conversely adapt
 ing these methods to the antiferromagnetic Ising model or the Potts model likely

 FIG. 1. Information percolation clusters for the stochastic Ising model on two geometries: hyper

 if it survives to time 0, blue if it dies out and is the history of a single vertex, and green o/w.
 requires additional new ideas as the monotonicity of the Ising model is crucial in
 matching the upper and lower bounds. The specific challenge is that in the Potts
 model a grand coupling will couple more slowly than a coupling of two states.
 Furthermore, by analyzing not only on the size of the red clusters, but rather
 where these hit the initial state at time zero, this framework opens the door to
 understanding the effect of the starting configuration on the mixing time (where
 sharp results on total-variation mixing for the Ising model were only applicable to
 worst-case starting states, usually via coupling techniques).
 Our next result demonstrates this by comparing the worst-case mixing time
 [which is matched by the all-plus starting state up to an additive 0(1)-term] with a
 typical starting configuration, and finally with the uniform starting configuration,
 that is, each site is initialized by an independent uniform ±1 spin. Informally, we
 show that the uniform starting state is roughly at least twice faster compared to
 all-plus, but perhaps surprisingly, almost every deterministic starting state is about
 as slow as the worst one.
 Formally, if i±(tK<)) is the distribution of the dynamics at time t started from xo
 then $ix (e) is the minimal t for which /i f" is within distance s from equilib
 rium, and ?jSx(e) is the analogue for the average 2~n J^Xo /4X°' the annealed
 version, as opposed to the quenched t^x f°r a uniform Xq).

 Ising model on an n-vertex graph G with maximum degree at most some fixed

 following hold for any 0 < ß < ßo and any fixed 0 < a <1 at large enough n:

 Specifically for the annealed analysis, even if a cluster survives to time zero (and
 beyond) it might still be perfectly coupled to the stationary measure, for example,
 a singleton strand (and more generally, a blue cluster) would receive a uniform spin
 both from the Ising measure and from the random initial state. Hence, we modify
 the framework by redefining red clusters as those in which at least two branches
 of the cluster reach time zero, then proceed to merge in the interval (—oo, 0), as
 illustrated in Figure 2. It is this factor of 2 that eventually transforms into the
 factor of 2 — s improvement in the mixing time. It seems reasonable to expect
 asymptotic factor is exactly 2 for ß positive and sufficiently which has been shown
 on the cycle [25] but the current analysis is not precise enough to establish it. Of
 course, for ß = 0, the annealed measure is already mixed.

 Verifying cutoff is often quite challenging, for example, even for simple random
 walk on an expander graph, no examples were known prior to [20, 21] (while this
 had been conjectured for almost all such graphs), and to date there is no known
 transitive example (while conjectured to hold for all transitive expanders).

 will focus on the two most notable examples of Glauber dynamics, each having an
 intuitive and useful graphical interpretation where each site experiences updates
 via an associated i.i.d. rate-one Poisson clock:
 (i) Metropolis: flip o(u) if the new state ou has a lower energy (i.e., 7t(cru) >
 7r(cr)), otherwise perform the flip with probability n(ou)/n(o). This corresponds
 to c(w, a) = exp(2ßa(u) £«-« ^Cy)) a 1.
 (ii) Heat-bath: erase a{u) and replace it with a sample from the conditional
 distribution given the spins at its neighboring sites. This corresponds to c(u, a) =
 1/[1 + exp(—2 ßa{u) <r(v))].
 It is easy to verify that these chains are indeed ergodic and reversible w.r.t. the
 Ising distribution jr. While our main results were all stated for the heat-bath chain,
 we note that by using the same approach one can infer the analogous statements
 for the Metropolis chain.
 Until recently, sharp mixing results for this dynamics were obtained in relatively
 few cases, with cutoff only known for the complete graph [6,17] prior to the works

 A beautiful short lemma of Miller and Peres [30] shows that, if a measure
 {±1}V is given by sampling a variable R C V and using an arbitrary law for
 spins and a product of Bernoulli^) for V \ R, then the L2-distance of /x fro
 uniform measure is at most E2|/fnÄ'' — 1 for i.i.d. copies R, R'. (See Lemm

 2.3. Enhancements of the framework: Custom update rules and modified
 unit interval. We will consider the information percolation clusters develo
 above from the designated time
 t* = tm-\-si, for 5* = Clog(l/f),
 where C > 0 will be specified later, and £ > 0 is the parameter for the mix
 time. However, instead of the standard procedure of developing the history, 
 an update at v either deletes it from the history (via an oblivious update) 
 places it by its set of neighbors N(v), we will allow v to be replaced (with va
 probabilities) by any subset of its neighbors, in the following way.
 Recall that an update of the form (7, U,t) eV x [0,1] x [0, /*] results 
 placing the spin at 7 at time t by some deterministic function T(jc, U), wh
 x = EueN(J) Xt(u). We introduce the notion of a generalized update rule
 der to establish the right dependence on ß in Theorem 1 by having rules up
 which typically only observe a small number of neighboring vertices. The u
 are of the form (7, A,U,t) where (7, U, t) is as before and the additional v
 A C [d] corresponds to a subset of the neighbors of vertex 7. The new updat
 exposes the spins {ffi,..., 0]a|} of these neighbors at time t, then generates
 new spin at 7 via $a(ci, • • •, o"|A|> U).
 With this generalized update rule, one unfolds the update history of a v
 {Jfv (t) : 0 < t < r*} as before, with the one difference that an update (7;, A,-, £/
 for which 7, 6 now results in Jfv(t) = JKiU) U A, \ {7,} for all 
 [ti+i,ti). The functions {4>a : A C [<i]}, as well as the probability distribution
 the subsets A C [d] to be exposed, will be derived from a discrete Fourier 
 sion of the original rule T (see Lemma 4.1), so that the new update proc
 would, on one hand, couple with the Glauber dynamics, and on the other, 
 ally use small subsets A which endows our percolation clusters with a subc
 behavior giving a better dependence on ß.

 longer corresponds to the dynamics, it generates a set of information perco
 clusters which dominate the original histories. The purpose of this construct
 that forbidding vertices to die in the first unit interval will be useful in the con
 of conditioning on other clusters. We will write C, X, as well as (t) etc. fo

 = {<%«) :v£ A, t<t+\.
 As explained following the definition of the three cluster types, at the heart of 
 matter is estimating an exponential moment of the size of the red clusters 
 Mgreen > the joint history of all green clusters. To this end, we consider th
 lowing conditional probability that a subset A is a red cluster. Define
 (2.6) = supP(A g Red | — H,{Ae Red} U {A c Vblue}),
 h
 noting that, toward estimating the probability of A € Red, the effect of condition
 ing on amounts to requiring that must not intersect We should note
 that the event A 6 Red means that A is a single red cluster, not a collection of
 them.
 LEMMA 2.1. If ß < 1/(5 d) then for any A C V and v e A,
 <2|A|E

 where zv is the time it takes the history ofCv to first coalesce into a single point (if
 at all), that is,
 (2.7) xv = min{f > 1 : \JF^(ti, — f)| = 1} A t*.
 It is worthwhile noting in the context of the parameter rv that, when developing
 the update history backward in time, rv is not a stopping time, since Cv is affected
 by any potential coalescence points for t < t+ — f„; instead, one can determine rv as
 soon as (t) — 0. Also observe that rv = 1 iff \CV \ = 1. Finally, the coalescence
 point w at time t = tir — xv (when t > 0) need not belong to for example, we
 may have J4?v(t) — 0 while w e Jfu for some u ^ v whose history intersected that
 of v at time t' > t.
 The subcritical nature of the information percolation clusters (prompted by our
 modified update functions <J>a) allows one to control exponential moments of the
 cluster sizes, as in the following lemma.

 The above lemma, the proof of which follows standard arguments from percola

 CLAIM 3.3. For any t, s > 0, we have
 e-2s < T,wmt+s(w)" ^ e-2(\-ßd)s
 Y,wmt(w)2
 Proof. The lower bound follows from the straightforward fact that
 mt+s(w) > e~smt(w) for any s, t > 0 and w, since the probability of observing
 no updates to w along the interval (/, t + s) (thus maintaining the magnetization
 without a change) is e~s. It therefore remains to prove the upper bound.
 When a vertex v is updated if a is the sum of the spins of its neighbors,
 then v is set to 1 with probability \ | tanh(jßcr) and —1 otherwise. Thus, since
 tanh(x) < 1 for all x e R after an update of v at time t,

 Recalling that t* = tm + s*> we apply the above claim for t = tm

 PROOF. Let X't and X" be two independent copies of the dynamics started
 from jto. We claim that we may couple Xt with X\ and X" so that, on the event
 {u £ Cv], we have Xt(u) = X't(v) and Xt(v) = X't'(v). Couple the updates of Xt
 and X't inside the history M'u. On the event {u £CV} couple the updates of Xt and
 X'l inside the history This is permissable since these histories are disjoint and
 the histories are measurable with respect to the updates inside them. Hence,
 E[X,(ii)X,(v)] = E[X»X>) + (Xt(u)X,(v) - X't(u)X;'(v))l{„eC„}]
 < E[X(ii)]E[X"(tO] + 2P(u € Cv).
 It follows that Cov(Xt(u), Xt(v)) < 2P(m e Cv) < 2F(u e Cv), and so

 together with the collective history of every v A.
 For a given subset S c V, let Red J denote the red clusters that arise when
 exposing the joint histories of Jifs (as opposed to all the histories Note
 the events {A e Red} and {A e Red^} n [J^a H = 0} are identical since
 the event of A being a red cluster means the histories of A satisfy the proper
 ties of being a red cluster and they do not intersect the histories of any vertices
 in the complement of A. Similarly, define Blue|, and by the same reasoning
 M C Vblue} = {A c Vblue^} n n^ = 0}.
 Next, given = X, we need to ensure that the component of A avoids X.
 This can be complicated by the fact that X could include parts of A for times before
 U and so the event may be very unlikely. To take care of this possibility, let su =
 su(X) = max{s : (u, s) G X] be the latest most time at which X contains u e A.
 This implies that any u with su < U must receive an update in the interval (su, r*] in
 order to avoid X. We set A' — {u e A : su > f* — 1} and define U = U(A', {sM }U&A')

 P(A e Red | — X,{Ae Red} U {A c Vblue}) to be equal to
 P(A € Red*A,JfA n X = 0,U \ = *)
 P({A e Red* } u {A c W* h n * = 0, U | = X) '
 Since the event {A € Red^| n {J^aD C X = 0} fl U is measurable in the a-field
 of updates within the space-time slab complement of X (thanks to the specifically
 defined notion of Red^), it is independent of = X}, and the same applies to
 the event ({A € Red^}U {A c VblueJ }) H c X = 0} C\U. Thus, the above
 expression equals
 P(A g Red^, n X = 0 IU)
 P({A e Red* } U {A c VBlue. }, MA fl X = 0 | U) '
 The numerator is at most P(A € Red^ | U). As for the denominator, it is at least
 the probability that, in the space conditioned on U, every u e A gets updated in
 the interval (su v — 1, î*] and the last such update (i.e., the first we expose when
 revealing Mu) is oblivious (implying A C VBlue* )—which is ö'A'(l — l/e)^A '.
 As this is at least e"'"4' for small enough ß [recall the definition of 9 in (2.4)],
 (4.1) VA < e|A|P(A e Red^ \U).
 Recall that in order for A to form a complete red cluster, the update historie
 {Mu : u e A} must belong to the same connected component of the space-time
 slab, and moreover, the configuration of A at time u must be a nontrivial functi
 of the initial configuration. Thus, either the histories [Jfu : m € A} coalesce to 
 single point w at some time 1 < T < t+—and then the spin there must depe
 nontrivially on the initial state, that is, X^(w) / Xj(w)—or the histories for all
 u e A all join into one cluster along (0, f*] and at least one of these survives to
 time 0. (The same would be true if we did not restrict the coalescence time to b
 at least 1, yet in this way the conditioning on U, which only pertains to update
 along the interval (t* — 1, ?*], does not cause any complications.) For the latter, w
 denote by J {a, b) the event that the histories join in the interval {a, b), and for the
 former we let
 x' = min{? > l:[j&(k-0| = l} At», T = r* - r',
 and note that the variable r' is a stopping time w.r.t. the natural filtration associated
 with exposing the update histories backward from time t+, indeed, in contrast t
 a definition of xv analogous to (2.7)—asking for {Jfu : u e Cv] to coalesce to a
 single point—here one only requires this for {Mh : u e A} (whereas Cv may be
 affected by the histories along (0, T] as these may admit additional vertices to i
 With this notation, we deduce from the above discussion that
 P(A € Red* | U) < p(jj{ J(T, h), w e X+(w) / Xj(w)} \ uj.

 The final step is to eliminate the conditioning on U using the modified update
 history M, which we recall does not remove vertices from the history along the
 unit interval (r* — 1, r*] and grants each vertex an automatic update at time r*. As
 such, Mu{t) C Jfu{t) ïoï any vertex u and time t.
 We claim that each of the terms in the right-hand side of (4.2) is increasing in the
 percolation space-time slab (i.e., they can only increase when adding connections
 to the update histories). Indeed, this trivially holds for {A c Cv}; the variable rv is
 increasing as it may take only longer for Cv to coalesce to a single point; finally, as
 the interval (t+ — xv, U] does not decrease and neither does along it, the event
 [w € - Tu, /*)} is also increasing.
 Therefore, if we do not remove vertices from the update history along (f* — 1, f*]
 then the right-hand side of (4.2) could only increase. Further, observe that, as long
 as no vertices are removed from the history along that unit interval, the connected
 components of the update history at time U — 1 remain exactly the same were we
 to modify the update times of any vertex there, while keeping them within that unit
 interval. In particular, should a vertex at all be updated in that period, we can move
 its latest update time to U.

 play a key role in the proof of Lemma 2.2.
 Lemma 4.1. For every e > 0, there exists some k > 0 such that the following
 holds provided ßd < k. For any r < d, there are nonnegative reals {pkj '• k =
 0,..., r) satisfying
 P0,r > 1 - and (^jPk,r < D0(2ßr)k
 (4.3) k
 for all k,
 where Do is an absolute constant, such that the Glauber dynamics can be coupled
 to an update function 0 that selects a subset A C [r] of the neighbors of a degree
 r vertex with probability p\A\,r and applies to it a symmetric monotone boolean
 function <t>4 [i.e., x) = —4>a(x) and 4>aM is increasing in x].
 Proof. Setting
 f(x) = ^(tanh(x) + 1) =
 e* + e~x
 we have that the Glauber dynamics update function at a given site with neighbors
 o\,...,or assigns it a new spin of 1 with probability f(ß Y!i=\ °ï)- Writing the
 Taylor series expansion f{x) = Bex1, with
 1 dlf
 and so, bearing in mind that tanh(z) has no singularities in the open disc of radius
 tt/2 around 0 in C and thus X) Bt converges absolutely,
 Bo = B\ = 1 /2 and ^T\Be\ = B for some absolute constant B > 0.

 Next, we wish to verify that ([)pk,r < Do(2ßr)k for some absolute constant
 Do and all k. Let Do = 4B and note that for k = 0 the sought inequality is trivial
 since Do > 1 (recall B > Bo + B\ — 1) whereas po,r < 1 (we have shown that
 pi r > 0 and clearly pkj > 0 for all k > 2). For k = 1, we again recall from (4.5)
 that rpi r < 2r\C\ \ < AßrB < Do(2ßr), and similarly, for k > 2 we have
 y Pk,r = 2y ICk\(k + 1) < 4B(k + 1)(ßr)k < ABVßrf = D0(2ßr)k.
 For any sufficiently small ßr, this of course also shows that pk,r 5 1 for all k, as

 4.3. Exponential decay of cluster sizes: Proof of 
 rule from Lemma 4.1, the probability that an upda
 will examine precisely k of its neighbors is
 fypk,r < D0(2ßr)k < D0(2ßd)k,
 with the inequality thanks to (4.3). The probability that a given neighbor of v, with
 degree some r' < d, receives an update in which it examines both v and k — 1
 additional neighbors is at most
 (y! ]\ fr J
 < max-Do(2ßr')k = -D0(3ßd)k,
 k — \ J r'<d r d
 using that x[!x < el!e < 3/2 for all x >2. Hence, the rate at which the
 the vertex v expands to k additional vertices along the time interva
 most
 D0(\+r/d)(3ßd)k <2D0(3ßd)k.
 By the same reasoning, the extra update at time that is applied to v in Jf con
 nects it to k of its neighbors (k — 0,..., r) with probability at most Do(2ßd)k,
 while each of its r neighbors contributes at most k new points with probability 
 most Do(3ßd)k/d.
 We now develop the cluster of the vertex (wo, to) in the space-time slab by
 exploring the branch at wo, both forward and backward in time, examining whic
 connections it has to new vertices—either through its own updates or through those
 which examine it—until it terminates via oblivious updates in both directions. W
 then repeat this process with one of the points discovered in the exploration process
 (arbitrary chosen), until all such points are exhausted and the cluster is complete
 revealed.
 Let Ym denote the number of vertices explored in this way after iteration m [i.e.,
 Fi is the number of vertices discovered via the branch incident to (wo, to), etc.]
 and let Zm be the total length of edges in the time dimension [i.e., (z, a), (z, b) fo

 First, for the length variable, we apply Lemma 4.1 with e — (1 — 77)/4, an

 with the gamma variable T(2,1 - e) measuring the time until the explored branch
 terminates (in both ends) using the key estimate p^r > 1 — e from Lemma 4.1,
 translated by 1 to account for the unit interval (/* — 1, in which vertices are not
 removed from .
 For the vertex count variable, with the above discussion in mind, observe th
 conditioned on Wm the number of new vertices exposed along the new branch
 dominated by Y?k=\ Vm\ in which

 5. The effect of initial conditions on mixing. In this section, we con
 random initial conditions (both quenched and annealed), and prove Theorem
 The first observation is that, thanks to Theorem 1, the worst-case mixing
 satisfies
 *Mix(a) = 'm + 0(1) for any fixed 0 < a < 1,
 with tm as defined in (1.1), and moreover, the same holds for the m
 time started from all-plus. By Claim 3.3, we have \ log« < tm < (j 4- e^
 with £ß = ßd/(2 — 2ßd) vanishing as ß 0. Thus, we may prove the boun
 the annealed/quenched mixing times when replacing tm by ^ log«.
 5.1. Annealed analysis. As mentioned in the Introduction, rather than
 paring two worst case boundary conditions we will compare a random one dir
 with the stationary distribution: By considering updates in the range t € (—oo, t
 we can use the coupling from the past construction to generate a coupling
 the stationary distribution. Let Xt denote the process started from uniform 
 conditions at time 0 and let Yt be the process generated by coupling from th
 The information percolation clusters of V will now be defined as the conn
 components of the graph on the vertex set V where (u, v) is an edge iff Jfu
 JFv(t) ^ 0 for some -oo < t < tm (in contrast to the previous definition wh
 we had 0 <t <tm). The notion of being a red cluster is redefined to be any 
 such that I UueCv ^u(t')\ _ 2 for all 0 <t'< tm. Blue clusters will be defined
 before and green clusters will again be the remaining clusters. We claim tha
 can couple the spins at time tm of all nonred clusters. Indeed, if a cluster 
 not red, then there is some time t' > 0 such that | U«gc„ I — 1- Call 
 vertex w. By symmetry, both Xt'(w) and Yt'(w) are equally likely to be plu
 minus and so we may couple them to be equal independently of the spins o
 other clusters. We may then also couple the spins in that cluster to be the sa
 both Xt and Y, to be equal for all t > t'. Thus, the configurations will agree o
 of the red clusters.
 Let 2U(A) denote the size of the smallest connected set of vertices (an
 containing A. In a graph of maximum degree d, the number of trees of size 
 taining the vertex v is bounded above by (ed)k, and hence the number of an
 A containing a specified vertex with 20(A) = k is at most (ed)k.
 Lemma 5.1. For any d, C, e > 0 there exists ßo > 0 such that the follo
 holds for large enough n. If 0 < ß < ßo and t+ = (| + e) log« then for any A,

 Remark 5.3. In the above proof, one could instead carry the analysis as in
 the proof of Theorem 1 (partitioning the event in Lemma 2.1 according to the
 events {\CV\ = k] when estimating the sum over v 3 A), that way replacing the
 factor of (ed)k lattice animals by 2k subsets of Cv. Consequently, the statement
 of Proposition 5.2 remains valid for any ß <co/d where cq depends on s but not
 on d.
 5.2. Quenched analysis. Here, we show that the mixing time from a typical
 random initial state is at most a factor of 1 + $ß faster than that from the worst
 starting state. As before, let Xt be started from a uniformly chosen initial state Xq
 and let Yt be started from the stationary distribution n.
 PROPOSITION 5.4. Let t~ = J logn — wn for some wn f oo. Then
 ||Px0(Xf- € •) — 7V ||tv 1 as n -> oo.
 PROOF. Note that by the monotonicity of the update rules, for any update
 history of u, the spin at m is a monotone function of Xq. With probability e~!,
 the vertex u is never updated in which case Xt(u) = Xo(u). Since by symmetry
 E[X;(m)] = 0, it follows that
 E[X,(m) I X0(u) = +1] > e~', E[X,(w) | X0(«) = -1] <
