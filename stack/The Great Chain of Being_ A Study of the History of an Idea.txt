ames Lectures
on Philosophy
and
Psychology were established
at Harvard
in 1929
from a bequest of the late Edgar Pierce.
The purpose
of the Lectureship
is to honor the memory of William
James
and at the same time provide
public
lectures
and informal
instruction
by an eminent
scholar not
permanently
connected with the University.
Professor
Lovejoy's
lectures
were given
as the second
series on this foundation
in the second half
of the academic
year
1932-33.


PREFACE
THE
TITLE of this book, I find, seems to some not unlearned
persons odd, and its subject unfamiliar.
Yet the phrase which
I have taken for the title was long one of the most famous in
the vocabulary
of Occidental
philosophy, science, and reflec-
tive poetry;
and the conception which in modern times came
to be expressed by this or similar phrases has been one of the
half-dozen most potent and persistent presuppositions in West-
ern thought.
It was, in fact, until not much more than a cen-
tury ago, probably the most widely familiar conception of the
general schemeof things, of the constitutive pattern of the uni-
verse; and as such it necessarily predetermined
current ideas
on many other matters.
The real oddity, then, is that its history has not previously
been written and its meaning and implications analyzed.
In
now attempting
this I shall be presenting what, I think, ought
to be, but apparently
are not, historical
commonplaces;
if
they are not, I venture
to hope that this book may help to
make them such.
Many separate parts of the history have,
indeed, been told before, and are therefore presumably
more
or less familiar;
it is their relation to a single pervasive com-
plex of ideas -
and thereby,
often, to one another -
that
still seems to need to be set forth.
That the use of the term
"the chain of being" as the descriptive name for the universe
was usually a way of predicating
of the constitution
of the
world three specific, pregnant,
and very curious characteris-
tics; that these characteristics implied a certain conception of
the nature of God;
that this conception was for centuries con-
joined with another to which it was in latent opposition -
an
opposition which eventually became overt;
that most of the
religious thought
of the West has thus been profoundly
at
variance with itself'; that with the same assumptions about the
constitution of the world was associated an assumption about
ultimate
value,
also in conflict with
another
and
equally
prevalent conception of the good -
the former manifesting its
full consequences only in the Romantic
period;
that this idea

VIII
PREFACE
of value, together with the belief that the universe is what the
term "the chain of being" implied that it is, provided
the chief
basis for most of the more serious attempts to solve the problem
of evil and to show that the scheme of things is an intelligible
and rational one;
and that the \same belief about the structure
of nature
lay in the background
of much early modern
sci-
ence, and therefore
influenced
the formation
of scientific hy-
potheses in various ways -
these are some of the more general
historical facts which I have attempted
to exhibit and illustrate
in some detail.
This preliminary
intimation
of them may at
.least help
the possible reader
to judge
whether
any of the
themes of the volume are of interest to him, and to facilitate
the task of the reviewer -
though, as a prudent
author should,
I have tried to avoid disclosing
in a prefatory
summary
too
much of the plot of the story to be told.
The history of this complex
of ideas has seemed to me to
suggest, if not to demonstrate,
certain
philosophical
conclu-
sions;
and these I have tried to indicate
in the "moral"
ap-
pended
to the final lecture.
But they
are,
I realize,
very
inadequately
set forth;
to have developed
them fully would
have inordinately
lengthened
the volume.
The
lectures
are for the most part
printed
as they were
orally delivered;
but the liberality
of the Syndics of the Har-
vard
University
Press has made
it possible to expand
them
considerably,
chiefly by the addition
of more citations of illus-
trative
passages.
These
last will, I dare
say, seem to some
readers
too abundant.
But in my own reading
of works of
this character
I have often been exasperated
by finding precis
or paraphrases
where I desiderated
the actual language
of the
authors
whose ideas were under
consideration;
and my rule
has therefore
been to give the words of relevant
texts as fully
as was consistent with reasonable
brevity.
On the other hand,
no attempt
has been made to include the whole mass of pos-
sible illustrations;
the volume
makes
no pretension
to be,
even approximately,
a corpusof the texts in which the central
and the related ideas dealt with occur.
There is in the nature of the enterprise
attempted
a certain
difficulty for which
I hope the benevolent
reader
will make
some allowance.
The lectures were not designed for specialists

in a single field, but for a mixed academic audience;
and it is
an essential part of the purpose of the book to pursue the ideas
with which it is concerned into a number of distinct provinces
of the history of thought.
It has in consequence occasionally
seemed advisable,
when dealing with subjects belonging
to
one province, to explain certain matters which, to those es-
pecially conversant with that province, will need no explana-
tion -
but which may not be equally known to specialists in
other fields, or to the "general
reader."
Most of what
is here printed
as Lecture

and some
sentences of Lecture X have previously been published in the

My thanks are due to several colleagues and friends who
have generously read in manuscript parts of the book on which
their learning made them especially valuable critics and ad-
visers.
For such assistance I am particularly
indebted to Dr.
George Boas, Dr. Harold Cherniss, Dr. Robert L. Patterson,
and Dr. Alexander Weinstein, of Johns Hopkins University,
and Dr. Marjorie Nicolson of Smith College.
I cannot refrain
from expressing to the Harvard Department
of Philosophy my
high appreciation
of the honor and privilege of presenting at
Harvard,
upon a lectureship
bearing
the name of William
James, some slight fruits of the years since, in my philosophical
novitiate, I first heard him exemplify in his incomparable
way
the meaning of "pragmatic
openness of mind" and the possi-
bility of fresh and revivifying approaches
to man's
ancient
problems.

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING


I
INTRODUCTION
THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY
OF IDEAS
THESE
lectures are primarily an attempt to offer a contribution
to the history of ideas; and since the term is often used in a
vaguer- sense than that which I have in mind, it seems neces-
sary, before proceeding
to the main business in hand, to give
some brief account of the province, purpose, and method of the
general sort of inquiry for which I should wish to reserve that
designation.
By the history of ideas I mean something at once
more specific and less restricted than the history of philosophy.
It is differentiated
primarily by the character
of the units with
which it concerns itself. Though it deals in great part with the
same material
as the other branches of the history of thought
and depends
greatly upon their prior labors, it divides that
material in a special way, brings the parts of it into new group-
ings and relations, views it from the standpoint
of a distinctive
purpose.
Its initial
procedure
may
be said -
though
the
parallel has its dangers -
to be somewhat analogous to that of
analytic chemistry.
In dealing with the history of philosophi-
cal doctrines,
for example,
it cuts into the hard-and-fast
in-
dividual systems and, for its own purposes, breaks them up into
their component
elements, into what may be called their unit-
ideas.
The total body of doctrine of any philosopher or school
is almost always a complex and heterogeneous
aggregate -
and often in ways which the philosopher himself does not sus-
pect.
It is not only a compound
but an unstable compound,
though,
age after age, each new philosopher
usually forgets
this melancholy
truth.
One of the results of the quest of the
unit-ideas
in such a compound
is, I think,
bound
to be a
livelier sense of the fact that
most philosophic
systems are
original or distinctive
rather
in their patterns
than in their
components.
When the student reviews the vast sequence of
arguments
and opinions which fill our historical textbooks, he

4
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
is likely to feel bewildered
by the multiplicity
and seeming
diversity of the matters presented.
Even if the array of ma-
terial is simplified somewhat
by the aid of conventional
-
and
largely
misleading -
classifications
of philosophers
by
schools or -isms, it still appears
extremely
various and com-
plicated;
each age seems to evolve new species of reasonings
and conclusions, even though
upon the same old problems.
But the truth is that the number
of essentially distinct philo-
sophical ideas or dialectical
motives is -
as the number
of
really distinct jokes is said to be -
decidedly limited, though,
no doubt, the primary ideas are considerably
more numerous
than the primary jokes. The seeming novelty of many a system
is due solely to the novelty of the application or arrangement
of
the old elements which enter into it. When this is realized, the
history as a whole .should look a much more manageable
thing.
I do not, of course, mean to maintain
that essentially novel
conceptions, new problems and new modes of reasoning about
them,
do
inot from time to time emerge
in the history of
thought.
But such increments of absolute novelty seem to me
a good deal rarer than is sometimes supposed.
It is true that,
just as chemical compounds
differ in their sensible qualities
from the elements composing them, so the elements of philo-
sophical doctrines,
in differing logical combinations,
are not
always readily recognizable;
and, prior to analysis, even the
same complex may appear to be not the same in its differing
expressions, because of the diversity of the philosophers'
tem-
peraments and the consequent inequality in the distribution
of
emphasis among the several parts, or because of the drawing
of dissimilar conclusions from partially identical premises.
To
the common logical or pseudo-logical
or affective ingredients
behind
the surface-dissimilarities
the historian
of individual
ideas will seek to penetrate.
These elements will not always, or usually, correspond to the
terms which we are accustomed to use in naming the great his-
toric conceptions of mankind.
There are those who have at-
tempted to write histories of the idea of God, and it is well that
such histories should be written.
But the idea of God is not a
unit-idea.
By this I do not mean merely the truism that dif-
ferent inen have employed the one name to signify superhuman

beings of utterly
diverse and incongruous
kinds; I mean also
that beneath
anyone of these beliefs you may usually discover
something,
or several things,
more elemental
and more ex-
planatory,
if not more significant,
than itself.
It is true that
the God of Aristotle had almost nothing
in common
with the
God of the Sermon
on the Mount
-
though,
by one of the
strangest
and most momentous
paradoxes
in Western
history,
the philosophical
theology
of Christendom
identified
them,
and defined the chief end of man as the imitation
of both.
But
it is also true that Aristotle's
conception
of the being to whom
he gave the most honorific
name
he knew was merely
one
consequence
of a certain
more general
way of thinking,
a
species of dialectic (of which I shall later speak) not peculiar to
him but highly characteristic
of the Greek and almost wholly
foreign to the ancient Jewish
mind -
which has historically
manifested
its influence
in ethics and
aesthetics,
and some-
times even in astronomy,
as well as in theology.
And it would,
in such a case, be to the prior idea, at once more fundamental
and more variously operative,
that the historian of ideas would
apply his method
of inquiry.
It is in the persistent
dynamic
factors, the ideas that produce effects in the history of thought,
that he is especially interested.
Now a formulated
doctrine
is
sometimes a relatively inert thing.
The conclusion reached by
a process of thought
is also not infrequently
the conclusion of
the process of thought.
The more significant factor in the mat-
ter may be, not the dogma which certain persons proclaim
-
be that single or manifold in its meaning
-
but the motives or
reasons which have led them to it.
And motives and reasons
partly
identical
may
contribute
to the production
of very
diverse conclusions, and the same substantive
conclusions may,
at different
periods
or in different
minds,
be generated
by
entirely distinct logical or other motives.
It is not, perhaps,
superfluous
to remark
also that the doc-
trines or tendencies
that
are designated
by familiar
names
ending in -ismor -ity, though they occasionally may be, usually
are not, units of the sort which the historian
of ideas seeks to
discriminate.
They commonly
constitute,
rather,
compounds
to which his method of analysis needs to be applied.
Idealism,
romanticism,
rationalism,
transcendentalism,
pragmatism-

6
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
all
these
trouble-breeding
and
usually
thought-obscuring
terms, which one sometimes
wishes to see expunged
from the
vocabulary
of the philosopher
and the historian
altogether,
are
names of complexes, not of simples -
and of complexes in two
senses.
They
stand,
as a rule, not for one doctrine,
but for
several distinct and often conflicting doctrines held by different
individuals
or groups to whose way of thinking
these appella-
tions have been applied,
either by themselves
or in the tradi-
tional terminology
of historians;
and each of these doctrines, in
turn, is likely to be resolvable into simpler elements, often very
strangely combined
and derivative
from a variety of dissimilar
motives and historic influences.
The term 'Christianity,'
for
example,
is not the name
for any single unit of the type for
which the historian
of specific ideas looks.
I mean by this not
merely the notorious
fact that persons who have equally
pro-
fessed and called themselves
Christians
have, in the course of
history, held all manner
of distinct and conflicting
beliefs un-
der the one name, but also that anyone
of these persons and
sects has, as a rule, held under that name a very mixed collec-
tion of ideas, the combination
of which into a conglomerate
bearing
a single name and supposed
to constitute
a real unity
was usually the result of historic processes of a highly compli-
cated and curious sort.
It is, of course, proper
and necessary
that ecclesiastical
historians
should write books on the history
of Christianity;
but in doing so they are writing of a series of
facts which, taken as a whole, have almost nothing in common
except the name; the part of the world in which they occurred;
the reverence for a certain person, whose nature
and teaching,
however,
have
been
most variously
conceived,
so that
the
unity here too is largely a unity of name;
and the identity of a
part of their historic antecedents,
of certain causes or influences
which, diversely combined
with other causes, have made each
of these systems of belief what
it is.
In the whole series of
creeds and movements
going under the one name, and in each
of them separately,
it is needful
to go behind
the superficial
appearance
of singleness and identity,
to crack the shell which
holds the mass together,
if we are to see the real units,
the
effective working ideas, which, in any given case, are present.
These
large
movements
and
tendencies,
then,
these con-

THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY

ventionally
labelled -isms, are not as a rule the ultimate
ob-
jectsof
the interest of the historian of ideas; they are merely
the initial materials.
Of what sort, then, are the elements, the
primary and persistent or recurrent
dynamic units, of the his-
tory of thought,
of which he is in quest?
They
are rather
heterogeneous;
I shall not attempt
a formal definition,
but
merely mention some of the principal types.
(I ) There
are, first, implicit
or incompletely
explicit as-
sumptions,or more or less unconsciousmentalhabits, operating
in
the thought of an individual
or a generation.
It is the beliefs
which are so much a matter
of course that they are rather
tacitly presupposed
than formally expressed and argued for,
the ways of thinking
which seem so natural
and inevitable
that
they are not scrutinized
with
the eye of logical self-
consciousness, that often are most decisive of the character of a
philosopher's
doctrine,
and still oftener of the dominant
in-
tellectual tendencies of an age. These implicit factors may be
of various sorts.
One sort is a disposition to think in terms of
certain categories or of particular
types of imagery.
There is,
for example, a practically
very important
difference between
(we have no English term for them) espritssimplistes-
minds
which habitually
tend to assume that simple solutions can be
found for the problems they deal with -
and those habitually
sensible of the general complexity of things, or, in the extreme
case, the Hamlet-like
natures who are oppressed and terrified
by the multiplicity of considerations probably pertinent
to any
situation
with which they are confronted,
and the probable
intricacy
of their interrelations.
The representatives
of the
Enlightenment
of the seventeenth
and eighteenth
centuries,
for example, were manifestly-characterized
to a peculiar de-
gree by the presumption
of simplicity.
Though
there were
numerous
exceptions,
though
there were powerful
ideas in
vogue which worked in the contrary
direction,
it was never-
theless largely all age of espritssimplistes;and the fact had the
most momentous
practical
consequences.
The assumption
of
simplicity was, it is true, combined in some minds with a cer-
tain sense of the complexity of the universe and a consequent
disparagement
of the powers of man's understanding,
which
might
at first seem entirely incongruous
with it, but which

8
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
in reality was not so.
The
typical early-eighteenth-century
writer was well enough aware that the universe as a whole is
physically an extremely large and complicated
thing.
One of
the favorite pieces of edifying rhetoric of the period was Pope's
warning against intellectual
presumptuousness:
He who through vast immensity can pierce,
See worlds on worlds compose one universe,
Observe how system into system runs,
Wha t other planets circle other suns,
What vary'd being peoples every star,
May tell why Heaven has made us as we are.
But of this frame, the bearing and the ties,
Thestrong
connections, nice dependencies,
Gradations just, has thy pervading soul
Look'd thro?
Or can a part contain the whole?
You may find this sort of thing in abundance
in the popular
philosophy of that time.
This pose of intellectual modesty was,
in fact, an almost universally
prevalent
characteristic
of the
period,
which Locke, perhaps,
more than
anyone
else had
brought
into fashion.
Man must become habitually
mindful
of the limitations of his mental powers, must be content with
that "relative and practical understanding"
which is the only
organ of knowledge that he possesses. "Men,"
as Locke puts
it in a familiar passage, "may find matter
sufficient to busy
their heads, and employ their minds with variety, delight and
satisfaction, if they will not boldly quarrel with their own con-
stitution,
and throwaway
the blessings their hands are filled
with, because they are not big enough to grasp everything."
We must not "loose our thoughts into the vast ocean of being,
as if all that boundless extent were the natural and undoubted
possession of our understandings,
wherein is nothing exempt
from its decisions or that escapes its comprehension.
But we
shall not have much reason to complain of the narrowness of
our minds, if we will but employ them about what may be of
use to us, for of that they are very capable.
. ..
It will be no
excuse to an idle and untoward servant, who would not attend
his business by candle-light,
to plead that he had not broad
sunshine.
The candle that is set up in us shines bright enough
for all our purposes.
The discoveries we can make with this

THE STUDY OF THE HISTOR Y OF IDEAS
9
ought to satisfy us, and we shall then use our understandings
right, when we entertain
all objects in that way and proportion
that they are suited to our faculties."
But though
this tone of becoming
diffidence,
this ostenta-
tious modesty in the recognition
of the disproportion
between
man's intellect and the universe, was one of the most prevalent
intellectual fashions of a great part of the eighteenth century, it
was frequently
accompanied
by an extreme presumption
of the
simplicity of the truths that areneedful for man and within his
reach,
by a confidence
in the possibility of "short
and easy
methods,"
not only with the deists, but with pretty much all
matters
of legitimate
human
concern.
"Simplicity,
noblest
ornament
of truth,"
wrote John
Toland,
characteristically;
and one can see that to him, and to many of his time and tem-
per, simplicity was in fact, not merely an extrinsic ornament,
but almost a necessary attribute
of any conception
or doctrine
which they were willing to accept as true, or even fairly to
examine.
When Pope, in his most familiar lines, exhorted his
contemporaries:
Know then thyself!
Presume not God to scan!
The proper study of mankind is man,
he implied
that
the problems
of theology
and
speculative
metaphysics
are too vast for human
thought;
but he also im-
plied, to the contemporary
ear, that man is a tolerably simple
kind of entity,
to plumb
whose nature
was well within
the
scope of the decidedly limited and simple intellectual
powers
with which he was endowed.
Assuming human nature to be a
simple
thing,
the
Enlightenment
also, as a rule,
assumed
political and social problems to be simple, and therefore easy
of solution.
Rid man's mind of a few ancient errors, purge his
beliefs of the artificial complications
of metaphysical
'systems'
and theological
dogmas, restore to his social relations some-
thing like the simplicity of the state of nature,
and his natural
excellence would, it was assumed, be realized,
and mankind
would live happily ever after.
The two tendencies I have been
mentioning,
in short, may probably
be traced
to a common
root.
The limitation
of the scope of activity of man's interest
and even of the ranging of his imagination
was itself a mani-

10
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
festation of a preference for simple schemes of ideas; the temper
of intellectual
modesty was partly the expression of an aver-
sion for the incomprehensible,
the involved, the mysterious.
When, on the other hand, you pass on to the Romantic Period,
you find the simple becoming an object of suspicion and even
detestation,
and
what
Friedrich
Schlegel
characteristically
called eine romantische Verwirrung the quality
most valued
in
temperaments,
in poems, and in universes.
(2) These endemic
assumptions,
these intellectual
habits,
are often of so general and so vague a sort that it is possible for
them to influence the course of man's reflections on almost any
subject.
A class of ideas which is of a kindred
type may be
termed dialectical motives.
You may, namely, find much of
the thinking of an individual,
a school, or even a generation,
dominated
and determined
by one or another turn of reason-
ing, trick of logic, methodological
assumption,
which if ex-
plicit would amount
to a large and important
and perhaps
highly debatable
proposition in logic or metaphysics.
A thing
which constantly
reappears,
for example,
is the nominalistic
motive -
the tendency, almost instinctive with some men, to
reduce the meaning of all general notions to an enumeration
of the concrete and sensible particulars
which fall under those
notions.
This shows itself in fields quite remote from technical
philosophy, and in philosophy it appears as a determinant
in
many
other
doctrines
besides
those
customarily
labelled
nominalism.
Much
of William
James's
pragmatism
bears
witness to' the influence upon him of this way of thinking;
while in Dewey's pragmatism
it plays, I think, a much smaller
part.
Again,
there is the organismic
or flower-in-the-cran-
nied-wall motive, the habit of assuming that, where you have a
complex of one or another kind, no element in that complex
can be understood,
or can, indeed, be what it is apart from its
relations to all the other components of the system to which it
belongs.
This, too, you may find operative
in some men's
characteristic
modes of thinking even upon non-philosophical
matters;
while it, also, shows itself in systems of philosophy
other than those which make a formal dogma of the principle
of the essentiality of relations.
(3) Another
type of factors in the history of ideas may be

THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY
OF IDEAS
I I
described
as susceptibilities
to diverse kinds of metaphysical
pathos.
This influential
cause in the determination
of philo-
sophical fashions and speculative tendencies
has been so little
considered
that
I find no recognized
name for it, and have
been compelled
to invent one which is not, perhaps,
wholly
self-explanatory.
'Metaphysical
pathos'
is exemplified in any
description of the nature of things, any characterization
of the
world to which one belongs, in terms which, like the words of a
poem, awaken through
their associations, and through
a sort
of empathy which they engender, a congenial mood or tone of
feeling on the part of the philosopher or his readers.
For many
people -
for most of the laity, I suspect -
the reading
of a
philosophical
book is usually nothing
but a form of aesthetic
experience,
even in the case of writings which seem destitute
of all outward
aesthetic charms; voluminous
emotional rever-
berations,
of one or another
sort, are aroused
in the reader
without
the intervention
of any definite
imagery.
Now of
metaphysical
pathos there are a good many kinds; and people
differ in their degree of susceptibility
to anyone
kind.
There
is, in the first place, the pathos of sheer obscurity, the-loveliness
of the incomprehensible,
which has, I fear, stood many a phi-
losopher in good stead with his public, even though
he was
innocent
of intending
any such effect.
The phrase omneigno-
tum pro mirificoconcisely explains
a considerable
part
of the
vogue of a number of philosophies, including some which have
enjoyed great popular reputation
in our own time.
The reader
doesn't
know exactly what they mean, but they have all the
more on that account an air of sublimity;
an agreeable feeling
at once of awe and of exaltation
comes over him as he con-
templates
thoughts
of so immeasurable
a profundity
-
their
profundity
being convincingly
evidenced
to him by the fact
that he can see no bottom to them.
Akin to this is the pathos
of the esoteric.
How exciting and how welcome is the sense of
initiation
into hidden
mysteries!
And how effectively have
certain
philosophers
-
notably
Schelling
and Hegel a cen-
tury ago, and Bergson in our own generation
-
satisfied the
human
craving for this experience,
by representing
the cen-
tral insight of their philosophy
as a thing to be reached,
not
through
a consecutive progress of thought
guided by the
Of-

12
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
dinary
logic available
to every man,
but through
a sudden
leap whereby one rises to a plane of insight wholly different in
its principles from the level of the mere understanding.
There
are expressions of certain
disciples of M. Bergson which ad-
mirably
illustrate
the place which the pathos of the esoteric
has in this philosophy,
or at least in the response to it.
M.
Rageot, for example, declares that unless one is in some sense
born again one cannot acquire that intuitionphilosophiquewhich
is the secret of the new teaching;
and M. Le Roy writes: "A
veil interposed between the real and ourselves, which falls of a
sudden as if an enchantment
were dissipated,
and leaves open
before the mind depths of light hitherto unimagined,
wherein
is revealed before our very eyes, for the first time, reality itself:
such is the feeling which is experienced
at every page, with
singular intensity, by the reader of M. Bergson."
These two types of pathos, however, inhere not so much in
the attributes
which a given philosophy
ascribes to the uni-
verse as in the attributes which it ascribes to itself -
or which
its votaries
ascribe
to it.
Some examples
of metaphysical
pathos in the stricter
sense ought
therefore
to be given.
A
potent variety is the eternalistic
pathos -
the aesthetic pleas-
ure which the bare abstract
idea of immutability
gives us.
The greater philosophical poets know well how to evoke it. In
English poetry it is illustrated
by those familiar lines in Shel-
ley's Adonaisof which we have all at some time felt the magic:
The One remains, the many' change and pass,
Heaven's light forever shines, earth's shadows fly ....
It is not self-evident that remaining
forever unchanged
should
be regarded
as an excellence; yet through the associations and
the half-formed images which the mere conception of change-
lessness arouses -
for one thing, the feeling of rest which its
innereNachahmunginduces in us in our tired moods -
a phi-
losophy which tells us that at the heart of things there is a
reality wherein is no variableness
nor shadow that is cast by
turning, is sure to find its response in our emotional natures, at
all events in certain phases of individual
or group experience.
Shelley's
lines exemplify
also another
sort of metaphysical
pathos, often conjoined with the last -
the monistic or pan-

THE
STUDY OF THE HISTORY
OF IDEAS
I 3
theistic pathos.
That
it should afford so many people a pe-
culiar satisfaction
to say that All is One is, as William James
once remarked,
a rather
puzzling thing.
What is there more
beautiful or more venerable
about the numeral
onethan about
any other number?
But psychologically
the force of the monis-
tic pathos is in some degree intelligible when one considers the
nature of the implicit responses which talk about oneness pro-
duces.
It affords, for example,
a welcome sense of freedom,
arising
from
a triumph
over,
or an
absolution
from,
the
troublesome
cleavages and disjunctions
of things.
To recog-
nize that
things which
we have hitherto
kept apart
in our
minds are somehow
the same thing -
that,
of itself, is nor-
mally an agreeable
experience
for human
beings.
(You will
remember
James's
essay "On
Some Hegelisms"
and on Mr.
B. P. Blood's book called The AnaestheticRevelation.) So, again,
when a monistic philosophy
declares, or suggests, that one is
oneself a part of the universal
Oneness,
a whole complex of
obscure emotional
responses is released.
The deliquescence
of
the sense -
the often so fatiguing
sense -
of separate
per-
sonality, for example,
which comes in various ways (as in the
so-called
mob-spirit),
is also capable
of excitation,
and
of
really
powerful
excitation,
too,
by
a
mere
metaphysical
theorem.
Mr.
Santayana's
sonnet
beginning
"I
would
I
might forget that I am I" almost perfectly expresses the mood
in which conscious individuality,
as such, becomes a burden.
Just such escape for our imaginations
from the sense of being a
limited,
particular
self the monistic
philosophies
sometimes
give us.
Distinct from the monistic pathos is the voluntaristic
-
though
Fichte
and others have contrived
to unite
them.
Here it is the response of our active and volitional nature,
per-
haps even, as the phrase goes, of our fighting blood, which is
aroused
by the character
which is ascribed
to the total uni-
verse with which we feel ourselves consubstantial.
Now all this
has nothing
to do with philosophy
as a science; but it has a
great deal to do with philosophy as a factor in history,
for the
reason that it is not chiefly as a science that philosophy
has
been a factor in history.
The susceptibility
to different sorts of
metaphysical
pathos plays, I am convinced,
a great part, both
in the formation
of philosophical
systems by subtly guiding

14
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
many a philosopher's
logic, and in partially causing the vogue
and influence of different philosophies among groups or gen-
erations which they have affected.
And the delicate task of
discovering
these varying
susceptibilities
and showing how
they help to shape a system or to give an idea plausibility and
currency is a part of the work of the historian of ideas.
(4) Another part of his business, if he means to take cogni-
zance of the genuinely operative
factors in the larger move-
ments of thought,
is an inquiry which may be called philo-
sophical semantics -
a study of the sacred words and phrases
of a period or a movement, with a view to a clearing up of their
ambiguities,
a listing of their various shades of meaning,
and
an examination
of the way in which confused associations of
ideas arising from these ambiguities
have .influenced the de-
velopment of doctrines, or accelerated
the insensible transfor-
mation of one fashion of thought into another, perhaps its very
opposite.
It is largely because of their ambiguities that mere
words are capable of this independent
action as forces in his-
tory.
A term, a phrase, a formula, which gains currency or
acceptance
because one of its meanings,
or of the thoughts
which it -suggests, is congenial
to the prevalent
beliefs, the
standards of value, the tastes of a certain age, may help to alter
beliefs, standards of value, and tastes, because other meanings
or suggested implications,
not clearly distinguished
by those
who employ it, gradually become the dominant
elements of its
signification.
The word 'nature,'
it need hardly be said, is the
most extraordinary
example of this, and the most pregnant
subject for the investigations of philosophical
semantics.
(5) The type of 'idea' with which we shall be concerned is,
however, more definite and explicit, and therefore
easier to
isolate and identify with confidence, than those of which I have
been hitherto speaking.
It consists in a single specific proposi-
tion or 'principle'
expressly enunciated
by the most influential
of early European
philosophers,
together
with some further
propositions which are, or have been supposed to be, its corol-
laries.
This proposition
was, as we shall see, an attempted
answer to a philosophical
question which it was natural
for
man
to ask -
which reflective
thought
could hardly
have
failed to ask, sooner or later.
It proved to have a naturallogi-

THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY
OF IDEAS
15
cal affinity for certain other principles, originally advanced
in
the course of reflection upon certain quite different questions,
which consequently
became agglutinated
with it.
The char-
acter of this type of ideas, and of the processes which constitute
their history, need not be further described in general terms,
since all that follows will illustrate it.
Second, any unit-idea
which the historian
thus isolates he
next seeks to trace through
more than one -
ultimately,
in-
deed, through
all -
of the provinces of history in which it
figures in any important
degree, whether
those provinces are
called philosophy, science, literature,
art, religion, or politics.
The postulate of such a study is that the working of a given con-
ception,
of an explicit or tacit presupposition,
of a type of
mental habit, or of a specific thesis or argument,
needs, if its
nature
and its historic role are to be fully understood,
to be
traced connectedly
through
all the phases of men's reflective
life in which those workings manifest themselves, or through as
many of them as the historian's resources permit.
It is inspired
by the belief that there is a great deal more that is common to
more than one of these provinces than is usually recognized,
that the same idea often appears, sometimes considerably
dis-
guised, in the most diverse regions of the intellectual
world.
Landscape-gardening,
for example, seems a topic fairly remote
from philosophy;
yet at one point, at least, the history of land-
scape-gardening
becomes
a part
of any truly
philosophical
history of modern thought.
The vogue of the so-called "Eng-
lish garden,"
which spread so rapidly in France and Germany
after
I 730, was, as M. Mornet and others have shown, the thin
end of the wedge of Romanticism,
or of one kind of Roman-
ticism.
That vogue itself -
partly, no doubt,
the expression
of a natural
revulsion of taste from an over-dose of the formal
gardening of the seventeenth century -
was partly also an in-
cident of the general craze for English fashions of all kinds,
which
Voltaire,
Prevost,
Diderot,
and
the Huguenot
jour-
nalistesin Holland had introduced.
But this change of taste in
gardening was to be the beginning and -
I do not, assuredly,
say, the cause, but the foreshadowing,
and one of the joint
causes -
of a change of taste in all the arts and, indeed, of a

16
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
change of taste in universes.
In one of its aspects that many-
sided thing called Romanticism
may not inaccurately
be de-
scribed as a conviction that the world is an englischerGartenon a
grand
scale.
The
God of the seventeenth
century,
like its
gardeners,
always geometrized;
the God of Romanticism
was
one in whose universe things grew wild and without trimming
and in all the rich diversity of their natural shapes.
The prefer-
ence for irregularity,
the aversion from that which is wholly
intellectualized,
the yearning
for echappeesinto misty distances
-
these, which were eventually
to invade the intellectual
life
of Europe at all points, made their first modern appearance
on
a grand scale early in the eighteenth
century in the form of the
new fashion in pleasure-gardens;
and it is not impossible
to
trace the successive phases of their growth and diffusion. 1
While the history of ideas -
in so far as it may be spoken of
in the present tense and the indicative
mood -
is thus an at-
tempt at historical synthesis, this does not mean that it is a mere
conglomerate,
still less that it aspires to be a comprehensive
unification,
of other historical disciplines.
It is concerned only
with a certain group of factors in history, and with these only
in so far as they can be seen at work in what are commonly
considered separate divisions of the intellectual
world; and it is
especially interested
in the processes by which influences pass
over from one province to another.
Even the partial
realiza-
tion of such a program
would do much, I cannot but think, to
give a needed unifying background
to many now unconnected
and, consequently,
poorly understood
facts.
It would help to
put gates through
the fences which, in the course of a praise-
worthy effort after specialization
and division of labor, have
come to be set up in most of our universities between depart-
ments whose work ought to be constantly
correlated.
I have
in mind especially the departments
of philosophy
and of the
modern literatures.
Most teachers of literature
would perhaps
readily enough admit that it is to be studied-
I by no means
say, can solely be enjoyed -
chiefly for its thought-content,
and that the interest of the history of literature
is largely as a
record of the movement
of ideas -
of the ideas which have
affected men's imaginations
and emotions and behavior.
And
the ideas in serious reflective literature
are, of course, in great

THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY

part
philosophical
ideas in dilution -
to change
the figure,
growths
from
seed scattered
by great
philosophic
systems
which themselves, perhaps, have ceased to be.
But, through a
lack of adequate
training
in philosophy,
students
and even
learned
historians of literature
often, I think, have not recog-
nized such an idea when they met it -
have not, at least,
known its historic lineage, its logical import and implications,
its other appearances
in human
thought.
Happily,
this con-
dition is fast altering for the better.
On the other hand, those
who investigate
or teach the history of philosophy
sometimes
take very little interest in an idea when it does not wear philo-
sophical full dress -
or war-paint
-
and are prone to disre-
gard its ulterior workings in the minds of the non-philosophic
world.
But the historian
of ideas, while he oftenest will seek
for the initial emergence of a conception
or presupposition
in
some philosophic or religious system or scientific theory, will
seek for its most significant manifestations
in art, and above all
in literature.
For, as Mr. Whitehead
has said, "it is in litera-
ture that the concrete outlook of humanity
receives its expres-
sion.
Accordingly,
it is to literature
that we must look, par-
ticularly in its more concrete forms, if we hope to discover the
inward thoughts of a generation."
2 And, as I think -
though
there is not time to defend the opinion -
it is by first distin-
guishing and analyzing
the major ideas which appear
again
and again, and by observing each of them as a recurrent
unit
in many contexts,
that the philosophic
background
of litera-
ture can best be illuminated.
Third: in common with what is called the study of compara-
tive literature,
the history of ideas expresses a protest against
the consequences
which have often resulted from the conven-
tional division of literary and some other historical studies by
nationalities
or languages.
There are some good, and obvious,
reasons
why the history
of political
institutions
and
move-
ments, since it must in some way be broken up into smaller
units, should be divided
upon national
lines; yet even these
branches
of historical
inquiry
have
in recent
times gained
greatly
in accuracy
and
fruitfulness
through
an increasing
realization
of the necessity of investigating
events or tendencies

18
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
or policies in one country
in order
to understand
the real
causes of many events, tendencies, or policies in another.
And
it is far from self-evident that in the study of the history of
literature, not to speak of that of philosophy, in which this prac-
tice has been generally
abandoned,
departmentalization
by
languages is the best way of recognizing
the necessity for spe-
cialization.
The existing scheme of division is partly a histori-
cal accident,
a survival of the time when most professors of
foreign literatures
were primarily
language-masters.
As soon
as the Historical study of literature
is conceived as a thorough
investigation
of any causal process -
even the comparatively
trivial one of the migration
of stories -
it must inevitably dis-
regard national
and linguistic boundary
lines; for nothing
is
more certain than that a great proportion
of the processes to
be investigated
disregard
those lines.
And if the function
of
teachers or the training
of advanced
students is to be deter-
mined by the affinity of certain minds for certain subjects, or
certain types of thought,
it is at least dubious whether, instead
of professors of English or French
or German
literature,
we
ought not to have professors of the Renaissance,
of the later
Middle Ages, of the Enlightenment,
of the Romantic
Period,
and the like.
For there was doubtless, on the whole, more in
common, in fundamental
ideas and tastes and moral temper,
between a typical educated
Englishman
and a Frenchman
or
Italian of the later sixteenth century than between an English-
man of that period and an Englishman
of the 1730's or the
1830's or the 1930's -
just as there is manifestly more in com-
mon between an average New Englander
and an Englishman
of 1930 than between a New Englander
of 1630 and his present
posterity.
If, then, a special capacity for sympathetic
under-
standing of that with which he deals is desirable in the histori-
cal specialist, a division of these studies by periods, or groups
within periods; would, it might plausibly be argued, be more
appropriate
than a division by countries, races, or languages.
I do not seriously urge such a reorganization
of the humanistic
departments
of universities;
there are obvious practical
diffi-
culties in the way.
But these difficulties have little to do with
any real cleavages among the facts studied -
least of all when
the facts have to do with the history of ruling categories, of

THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY

19
beliefs, of tastes, of intellectual
fashions.
As Friedrich
Schlegel
long ago said:
"Wenn
die regionellen
Theile
der modernen
Poesie, aus ihrem Zusammenhang
gerissen, und
als einzelne
fur sich bestehende
Ganze betrachtet
werden, so sind sie uner-
klarlich,
Sie bekommen
erst durch
einander
Haltung
und
Bedeutung."

Fourth: Another
characteristic
of the study of the history of
ideas, as I should wish to define it, is that it is especially con-
cerned with the manifestations
of specific unit-ideas
in the col-
lective thought
of large groups of persons, not merely in the
doctrines or opinions of a small number of profound thinkers or
eminent writers.
It seeks to investigate the effects of the sort of
factors which it has -
in the bacteriologist's
sense -
isolated,
in the beliefs, prejudices,
pieties, tastes, aspirations,
current
among the educated
classes through,
it may be, a whole gen-
eration, or many generations.
It is, in short, most interested in
ideas which attain a wide diffusion, which become a part of the
stock of many minds.
It is this characteristic
of the study of
the history of ideas in literature
which often puzzles students
-
even advanced
students -
in the
present-day
literature
departments
in our universities.
Some of them, at least, my
colleagues
in those departments
often tell me, are repelled
when called upon to study some writer whose work, as litera-
ture, is now dead -
or at best, of extremely
slight value, ac-
cording
to our present
aesthetic
and intellectual
standards.
Why not stick to the masterpieces, such students exclaim -
or
at least to these plus the minor classics -
the things that can be
still read with pleasure, or with a feeling of the significance for
men of the present
age of the ideas or the moods of feeling
which they express?
This is a natural
enough state of mind, if
you don't
regard
the study of literary
history
as including
within its province
the study of the ideas and feelings which
other men in past times have been moved by, and of the proc-
esses by which what may be called literary and philosophical
public opinion is formed.
But if you do think the historian of
literature
ought
to concern
himself with these matters,
your
minor writer may be as important
as -
he may often, from
this point of view, be more important
than -
the authors
of

20
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
what are now regarded
as the masterpieces.
Professor Palmer
has said, with equal truth and felicity: "The
tendencies
of an
age appear more distinctly in its writers of inferior rank than in
those of commanding
genius.
These latter
tell of past and
future as well as of the age in which they live. They are for all
time.
But on the sensitive responsive
souls, of less creative
power,
current
ideals
record
themselves
with
clearness."
4
And it is, of course, in any case true that a historical
under-
standing
even of the few great writers of an age is impossible
without an acquaintance
with their general background
in the
intellectual
life and common moral and aesthetic valuations
of
that age; and that the character
of this background
has to be
ascertained
by actual
historical
inquiry
into the nature
and
interrelations
of the ideas then generally prevalent.
Finally, it is a part of the eventual task of the history of ideas
to apply its own distinctive analytic method in the attempt
to
understand
how new beliefs and intellectual
fashions are in-
troduced
and diffused, to help to elucidate
the psychological
character
of the processes by which changes in the vogue and
influence of ideas have come about;
to make clear, if possible,
how conceptions
dominant,
or extensively
prevalent,
in one
generation
lose their hold upon men's minds and give place to
others. To this large and difficult and important
branch of his-
torical interpretation
the method of study of which I am speak-
ing can make only one contribution
among many;
but it is, I
can't but think, a necessary contribution.
For the process can
hardly
be made intelligible
until the natures
of the separate
ideas which enter as factors in it are discriminated
and sepa-
rately observed in their general historic working.
These lectures, then, are intended to exemplify in some small
measure the sort of philosophical-historical
inquiry of which I
have been merely sketching the general aims and method.
We
shall first discriminate,
not, indeed,
a single and simple idea,
but three ideas which have, throughout
the greater part of the
history of the West, been so closely and constantly
associated
that they have often operated
as a unit, and have, when thus
taken
together,
produced
a conception
-
one of the major
conceptions
in Occidental
thought
-
which came to be ex-

THE STUDY OF THE HISTORY

2 I
pressed by a single term: "the Great Chain of Being"; and we
shall observe the workings of these both separately and in con-
junction.
The example will necessarily be inadequate,
even as
a treatment
of the special topic chosen, being restricted
not
only by limitations
of time but by the insufficiency of the lec-
turer's
knowledge.
Nevertheless,
so far as these limitations
permit, we shall try to trace these ideas to their historic sources
in the minds of certain philosophers;
to observe their fusion;
to note some of the most important
of their widely ramifying
influences
in many
periods
and
in diverse
fields -
meta-
physics,
religion,
certain
phases
of the
history
of modern
science, the theory of the purpose
of art and the criteria
of
excellence therein,
moral valuations,
and even, though
to a
relatively slight extent, in political tendencies;
to see how later
generations
derived from them conclusions undesired
and un-
dreamed-of
by their originators;
to mark some of their effects
upon men's emotions and upon the poetic imagination;
and in
the end, perhaps,
to draw a philosophic moral from the tale.
But I ought, I think, to close this preamble
with three notes
of warning.
The first relates to the very program which I have
outlined.
The study of the history of ideas is full of dangers and
pitfalls;
it has its characteristic
excess.
Precisely because
it
aims at interpretation
and unification
and seeks to correlate
things which often are not on the surface connected,
it may
easily degenerate
into a species of merely imaginative
historical
generalization;
and because the historian
of an idea is com-
pelled by the nature of his enterprise
to gather material
from
several fields of knowledge,
he is inevitably,
in at least some
parts of his synthesis, liable to the errors which lie in wait for
the non-specialist.
I can only say that I am not unmindful
of
these dangers and have done what I could to avoid them;
it
would be too sanguine to suppose that I have in all cases suc-
ceeded in doing so. In spite of the probability,
or perhaps the
certainty,
of partial
failure,
the enterprise
seems worth
at-
tempting.
The other warnings are addressed to my hearers.
Our plan
of procedure
requires
that
we deal only with a part
of the
thought
of anyone
philosopher
or anyone
age.
The part,
therefore, must never be mistaken for the whole.
We shall not,

22
THE
GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
indeed,
confine our view solely to the three connected
ideas
which are the theme
of the course.
For their philosophical
significance and historic operation
can be understood
only by
contrast.
The story to be told is in great part a story of con-
flict, at first latent, eventually
overt, between these ideas and a
series of antagonistic
conceptions,
some of the antagonists being
their own offspring.
We must, then, observe them throughout
in the light of their antitheses.
But nothing that is to be said is
to be construed
as a comprehensive
exposition
either of any
system of doctrine or of the tendencies of any period.
Finally,
it is evident
that, when one tries to relate in this fashion the
biography
of even one idea, a heavy demand
is made upon the
catholicity
of the intellectual
interests
of one's auditors.
In
tracing
the influence
of the conceptions
which form the sub-
ject of this course we shall be obliged, as has been intimated,
to
take account
of episodes in the history of a number
of disci-
plines usually supposed
to have little to do with one another,
and usually studied in comparative
isolation.
The history of
ideas
is therefore
no
subject
for
highly
departmentalized
minds;
and it is pursued
with some difficulty in an age of de-
partmentalized
minds.
It presupposes,
also, an interest in the
workings of human
thought
in the past even when these are,
or seem to many of our generation
to be, misguided,
confused,
or even absurd.
The history of philosophy
and of all phases of
man's reflection is, in great part, a history of confusions of ideas;
and the chapter
of it with which we shall be occupied
is no
exception
to this rule.
To some of us it is not less interesting,
and little less instructive,
on that account.
Since man, for bet-
ter or worse, is by nature,
and by the most distinctive impulse
of his nature,
a reflective
and interpretative
animal,
always
seeking rerum cognoscerecausas, to find in the bare data of ex-
perience more than meets the eye, the record of the reactions
of his intellect
upon
the brute
facts of his sensible existence
constitutes,
at the least, an essential part of the natural
history
of the species, or sub-species, which has somewhat
too flatter-
ingly named itself homosapiens; and I have never been able to
see why what is distinctive in the natural
history of that species
should appear -
especially to a member of it -
a less respect-
able subject
of study
than
the natural
history
of the para-

meciumor the white rat.
No doubt man's quest of intelligibility
in nature
and in himself, and of the kinds of emotional
satis-
faction
which
are conditioned
by a sense of intelligibility,
often, like the caged rat's quest of food, has found no end, in
wandering
mazes lost. But though the history of ideas is a his-
tory of trial-and-error,
even the errors illuminate
the peculiar
nature, the cravings, the endowments, and the limitations of the
creature
that falls into them, as well as the logic of the prob-
lems in reflection upon which they have arisen; and they may
further serve to remind us that the ruling modes of thought of
our own age, which some among us are prone to regard as clear
and coherent
and firmly grounded
and final, are unlikely to
appear in the eyes of posterity to have any of those attributes.
The adequate
record of even the confusions of our forebears
may help, not only to clarify those confusions, but to engender
a salutary doubt whether we are wholly immune from different
but equally great confusions.
For though we have more em-
pirical information
at our disposal, we have not different
or
better minds; and it is, after all, the action of the mind upon
facts that makes both philosophy
and science -
and, indeed,
largely makes the 'facts.'
Nevertheless,
those who do not care
for the natural
history of man in his most characteristic
ac-
tivity, who have neither
curiosity nor patience
to follow the
workings of other minds proceeding from premises which they
do not share, or entangled in what seem to them, and often are,
strange confusions, or engaged in speculative enterprises which
they may regard
as hopeless, ought in fairness to be warned
that much of the story which I am to try to tell will be for them
without
interest.
On the other hand,
I think it only fair to
warn those who, for such reasons, are indifferent
to the story
here to be told, that without an acquaintance
with it no under-
standing of the movement
of thought in the Occident,
in most
of its major provinces, is possible.

II
THE GENESIS OF THE
IDEA IN GREEK
PHILOSOPHY:
THE THREE
PRINCIPLES
THE
most fundamental
of the group of ideas of which we are to
review the history appears
first in Plato;
and nearly all that
follows might therefore serve as an illustration
of a celebrated
remark of Professor Whitehead's,
that "the safest general char-
acterization
of the European
philosophical
tradition
is that it
consists in a series of footnotes to Plato."
But there are two
conflicting major strains in Plato and in the Platonic tradition,
With
respect
to the deepest
and farthest-reaching
cleavage
separating
philosophical
or religious systems he stood on both
sides; and his influence upon later generations
worked in two
opposite directions.
The cleavage to which I refer is that be-
tween what I shall call otherworldliness
and this-worldliness.
By otherworldliness
I do not mean a belief in and a preoccupa-
tion of the mind with a future life.
To be concerned
about
what will happen
to you after death,
or to let your thought
dwell much upon the joys which you hope will then await you,
may obviously be the most extreme form of this-worldliness;
and it is essentially such if that life is conceived,
not as pro-
foundly different in kind from this, but only as more of much
the same sort of thing,
a prolongation
of the mode of being
which we know in the world of change and sense and plurality
and social fellowship, with merely the omission of the trivial or
painful features of terrestrial
existence, the heightening
of its
finer pleasures,
the compensation
of some of earth's
frustra-
tions.
The two most familiar expressions by Victorian
poets of
the desire for a continuance
of personal
existence
perfectly
illustrate this.
In nothing was Robert Browning's breezy gusto
for the life that
now is more manifest
than
in his hope to
"fight
on, fare ever, there as here."
And when Tennyson's
meditatiomortis ended with a prayer
simply for "the wages of
going on, and not to die" he, too, in his less robustious
way,

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
25
was declaring
the sufficient worth of the general conditions of
existence
with
which
common
experience
has already
ac-
quainted
us.
Both writers were, indeed, giving utterance
to a
special form of this feeling which had been somewhat excep-
tional before the Romantic
period -
though our present his-
torical survey will show us its earlier emergence -
and was
highly characteristic
of their own age -
an identification
of
the chief value of existence with process and struggle in time,
an antipathy
to satisfaction and finality, a sense of the "glory
of the imperfect,"
in Professor Palmer's
phrase.
This is the
complete negation of the otherworldliness
of which I am speak-
ing.
For of that, even in its milder manifestations,
a more or
less sweeping contemptusmundi has been of the essence; it has
had no necessary -
though in most of its Occidental
phases it
has had an actual -
connection
with the craving for a sepa-
rate
personal
immortality;
and in its more thorough-going
forms it has seen in that craving the last enemy to be overcome,
the root of all the misery and, vanity of existence.
By 'otherworldliness,'
then -
in the sense in which
the
term, 1 suggest, is an indispensable
one for distinguishing
the
primary antithesis in philosophical or religious tendencies -
I
mean the belief that both the genuinely
'real'
and the truly
good are radically antithetic in their essential characteristics
to
anything
to be found in man's
natural
life, in the ordinary
course of human
experience,
however
normal,
however
in-
telligent, and however fortunate.
The world we now and here
know -
various, mutable,
a perpetual
flux of states and rela-
tions of things, or an ever-shifting phantasmagoria
of thoughts
and sensations, each of them lapsing into nonentity in the very
moment of its birth -
seems to the otherworldly
mind to have
no substance in it; the objects of sense and even of empirical
scientific knowledge are unstable, contingent,
forever breaking
down logically into mere relations to other things which when
scrutinized prove equally relative and elusive.
Our judgments
concerning
them have seemed to many philosophers
of many
races and ages to lead us inevitably
into mere quagmires
of
confusion
and
contradiction.
And -
the
theme
is of the
tritest -
the joys of the' natural
life are evanescent and delu-
sive, as age if not youth discovers.
But the human will, as con-

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
ceived by the otherworldly
philosophers,
not only seeks but is
capable of finding some final, fixed, immutable,
intrinsic, per-
fectly satisfying good, as the human
reason
seeks, and
can
find, some stable, definitive, coherent, self-contained,
and self-
explanatory
object or objects of contemplation.
Not, however,
in this world is either to be found, but only in a 'higher'
realm
of being differing in its essential nature, and not merely in de-
gree and detail, from the lower.
That other realm, though to
those enmeshed in matter, occupied with things of sense, busy
with plans of action, or absorbed in personal affections, it ap-
pears cold and tenuous and barren of interest and delight, is, to
those who have been emancipated
through
reflection or emo-
tional disillusionment,
the final goal of the philosophic
quest
and the sole region in which either the intellect or the heart of
man, ceasing, even in this present life, to pursue shadows, can
find rest.
Such is the general creed of otherworldly
philosophy;
it is
familiar enough, but we need to have it explicitly before us as
the contrasting background
for what is to follow. That this is a
persistent type, and that it has, in one form or another,
been
the dominant
official philosophy of the larger part of civilized
mankind
through
most of its history, I need not remind you.
The greater number of the subtler speculative minds and of the
great religious teachers have, in their several fashions and with
differing degrees of rigor and thoroughness,
been engaged in
weaning
man's
thought
or his affections,
or both,
from his
mother
Nature -
many of them, indeed,
in seeking to per-
suade him that he must in very truth
be born again, into a
world whose goods are not Nature's
goods and whose realities
he cannot know through those processes of the mind by which
he becomes acquainted
with his natural environment
and with
the laws to which its ever-changing
states conform.
I have said
"official philosophy"
because nothing, I suppose, is more evi-
dent than that most men, however much they may have pro-
fessed to accept it, and have even found in the reasonings or
the rhetoric
of its expositors a congenial
and moving sort of
metaphysical
pathos -
which is partly
the pathos of the in-
effable -
have never quite believed it, since they have never
been
able to deny to the things disclosed
by the senses a

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
27
genuine and imposing and highly important
kind of realness,
and have never truly desired for themselves
the end which
otherworldliness
held out to them.
The great metaphysicians
might seek to demonstrate
its truth,
the saints might in some
measure fashion their lives in accordance
with it, the mystics
might return
from their ecstasies and stammeringly
report
a
direct experience of that contact with the absolute reality and
the sole satisfying good which it proclaimed;
but Nature in the
main has been too potent for it.
While the plain man might
admit the metaphysician's
demonstration,
might humble him-
self before the saint, and might credit,
without
professing to
understand,
the mystic's report,
he has manifestly continued
to find something
very solid and engrossing in the world in
which his own constitution
was so deeply rooted
and with
which it was so intimately
interwoven;
and even if experience
defeated his hopes and in age the savor of life grew somewhat
flat and insipid, he has sought comfort in some vision of a bet-
ter ' this-world'
to come, in which no desire should lack fulfil-
ment
and
his own zest for things
should
be permanently
revitalized.
These facts, it is incidentally
to be observed, do not
mean that the general character
and tone of a society in which,
at least nominally,
an otherworldly
philosophy
is widely ac-
cepted or officially dominant
is little affected by that circum-
stance.
The spectacle of medieval Europe, or of India before,
and even since, its infection with the Western plague of nation-
alism, is sufficient evidence to the contrary.
Where some form
of otherworldliness
is generally
professed, the socially preva-
lent scale of values is largely shaped by it and the principal
themes and objectives of intellectual
effort receive their char-
acter from it. The'
worldly'
man in such a society commonly
reveres -
and is usually obliged to support -
the minority
who have more or less thoroughly
and sincerely turned
from
the pursuit
of temporal
goods and detached
themselves from
the hurly-burly
of the world in which he is not unpleasurably
engrossed;
and, by a familiar
paradox,
exemplified
often in
medieval
Europe
as it is in contemporary
India,
the chief
power in the affairs of this world is not unlikely to fall, or to be
forced, into the hands of those who have withdrawn
from it.
The otherworldly
philosopher
is made the ruler, or the secret

THE
GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
ruler of the ruler,
the mystic or the saint becomes the most
powerful, and sometimes the shrewdest,
of politicians.
There
is perhaps nothing so favorable
to success in this world's busi-
ness as a high degree of emotional
detachment
from it.
But
the
social
and
political
effects
of otherworldliness,
though a rich and interesting
theme, do not here concern us,
except
as a reminder
that otherworldliness
has always been
compelled
in practice
to make terms with this world and has
often been instrumental
to ends foreign to its principles.
It is
of its own nature as a mode of human thought and feeling, and
especially of the philosophic motives which provide its grounds
or its 'rationalization,'
that some further consideration
is perti-
nent to our topic.
It manifestly may exist, and historically has
existed, in diverse degrees; it may receive partial application
in
some provinces of tho·ught and not in others;
and strains of it
may turn up in queer and incongruous
contexts.
There
is a
purely metaphysical
otherworldliness
which is sometimes to be
found completely
dissociated
from any corresponding
theory
of the nature of the good, and therefore from any otherworldly
moral and religious temper.
Perhaps
the oddest example
of
this is to be seen in those half-dozen
irrelevant
chapters
about
the Unknowable
which Herbert
Spencer, under the influence
of Hamilton
and Mansel, prefixed to the Synthetic Philosophy.
There
are, moreover,
as I have intimated,
several
distinct
features or categories of the world of common thought and ex-
perience which may give rise to the denial of either its 'reality'
or its value.
It may be metaphysically
condemned
merely be-
cause of its temporal
character
and perpetual
incompleteness;
or because of the seeming relativity
of all its component
mem-
bers, the lack in each of them of any self-contained
intelligi-
bility in which thought can find its term; or because it seems to
be merely a random
collection of petty existences, all of them
fragmentary,
imperfect,
and without
any obvious and neces-
sary reason
for being;
or because
our apprehension
of it is
through
those deceitful
organs,
the senses, which neither
in
themselves
nor even in any inferential
constructions
based
upon them and defined in the terms which they provide,
can
be freed from the suspicion of subjectivity;
or because of its
mere multiplicity,
its recalcitrance
to that insatiable
craving

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
29
for unity which besets the speculative reason; or -
in the case
of certain less ratiocinative
minds -
simply because of inter-
mittent
experiences in which it loses the feel of reality -
Fallings from us, vanishings,
Blank misgivings of a creature
Moving about in worlds not realized -
so that
the conviction
becomes to such minds overpowering
that true being, the world in which the soul can feel itself at
home, must be somehowother than 'all this.'
Anyone
of these
motives may give rise to a genuinely
otherworldly
ontology
because each of them fixes upon some one truly distinctive and
constitutive
character
of 'this'
world.
But when only one or
only a few of them are operative,
there does not result what
may be called an integral otherworldliness
in the metaphysical
sense; some other characters
of the world known to natural
ex-
perience remain exempt from the impeachment.
On the side
of value,
again,
'this'
world
may
be
dismissed
as evil or
worthless on the ground of anyone,
or all, of the familiar com-
plaints which fill the pages of the otherworldly
moralists and
religious
teachers:
because
the world-process,
when the at-
tempt is made to conceive it as a whole, presents to the imag-
ination
only an incoherent
and tedious drama,
full of sound
and fury but signifying nothing -
either a pointless repetition
of the same episodes, or a tale of endless change which begins
nowhere,
has reached
no consummation
commensurate
with
the infinite time in which it has been going on, and verges to
no intelligible
goal; or because all desires that arise in time
and are fixed on ends in time have been found by experience
to constitute
only an endless renewal
of dissatisfaction,
and
can be seen by reflection
to share necessarily in the baffling
transiency
of the process in which they are immersed;
or be-
cause there is, in not a few men, even in some not themselves
capable
of the true mystic ecstasy, a recurrent
emotional
re-
bellion against the mutual externality
of things and against the
confining separateness
of their own being, a craving to escape
from the burden of self-consciousness, to "forget that I am I,"
and be lost in a unity in which all sense of division and all con-
sciousness .of otherness
would
be transcended.
An integral

30
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
otherworldliness
would combine
all these motives, and indict
this world upon all counts.
It is best exemplified in some of the
Upanishads,
in the system of the Vedanta,
in the Vedantist
and Buddhist strain -
so ironically alien to the actual life and
personal temper of Schopenhauer
-
in Die Welt als Wille und
Vorstellung;primitive
Buddhism,
which is a kind of pragmatic
otherworldliness,
falls short of it only by its negativity,
its in-
sistence upon
the insubstantiality
and
worthlessness
of this
world
without
any altogether
unequivocal
assertion
of the
positive reality
and positive value of the alternative.
Some
modern
observers
of otherworldliness
will perhaps
question
whether
Buddhism
has not in this come nearer
to disclosing
the strange truth that many of the great philosophers
and theo-
logians have been occupied
with teaching
the worship of-
nonentity;
though of nonentity
made to seem more'
real'
and
emotionally
more satisfying by an emphasis upon its freedom
from the particular
defects and limitations
-
the relativity,
the internal logical conflicts, the lack of finality for thought and
desire -
which characterize
all the concrete objects of which
we can think at all.
It is not necessary for our purpose to at-
tempt
to answer this large question
here.
What
is certain is
that such philosophers
have always believed themselves to be
doing precisely the reverse of this.
But any otherworldliness,
whether
integral
or limited, can,
it would seem, make nothing
of the fact that
there is a 'this
world'
to be escaped from; least of all can it justify or explain
the being of such a world, or that
of any particular
feature
or aspect of empirical
existence which it negates.
Its natural
recourse,
therefore,
is, as in the Vedanta,
to the device of
illusionism.
But to call the characters
of actual
experience
'illusion,'
blank nonentity,
though it is a kind of poetry which
has a very potent metaphysical
pathos, is, philosophically
con-
sidered,
plainly
the extremest
kind of nonsense.
'Unreal'
those characters
may conceivably
be in the sense that
they
have no existence or no counterparts
in an objective order out-
side the consciousness of those who experience
them.
But to
speak of them as absolutely
unreal,
while experiencing
their
existence in oneself and assuming it in other men, and while
expressly pointing
to them as imperfections
to be transcended

GENESIS OF THE
IDEA
3I
and evils to be overcome,
is obviously to deny and affirm the
same proposition
in the same breath.
And a self-contradiction
does not cease to be meaningless
by seeming sublime.
Thus
any otherworldly
philosophy
which
does not resort
to this
desperate
subterfuge
of illusionism seems to have this world,
whatever
its ontological
deficiencies,
on its hands
as an un-
accountable
mystery, a thing unsatisfying,
unintelligible,
and
evil, which seemingly ought not to be, yet somehow undeniably
is. And this embarrassment
is as evident in the partial
forms
of otherworldliness
as in the integral
variety.
Even though it
be only to the temporality,
the successiveness and lapsingness,
of the experiences we know, that you wish to deny the eulogis-
tic epithet of 'real,'
it remains the fact that all the experienced
existence that we have is successive and lapsing, and that such
existence is, by initial hypothesis,
antithetic
to that which is
eternal and forever at the goal.
It is in the light of this primary antithesis of otherworldliness
and
this-worldliness
that
the dual role of Plato in Western
thought
can best be understood.
Unhappily,
when one at-
tempts
to set forth the essentials of Plato's
philosophy
today
one is confronted
at the outset
with
radical
differences
of
opinion
among .learned
specialists
concerning
two distinct
questions:
first, whether the doctrines to be found in many, or
even
in any,
of the Dialogueswere
held
by Plato
himself;
second, what these doctrines -
to whomever
attributable
-
actually
were.
If nothing
can be said to be 'known'
upon
which there is disagreement
among specialists of high repute,
we can hardly
be said to know anything
of the teaching
of
Plato himself
about
the
profounder
issues of philosophy.
Plato's characteristics
as a writer naturally
make the Dialogues
an even more fruitful field than the works of other philosophers
for learned
.controversies.
The dramatic
form in which the
reasoning
is cast; his tendency to introduce
avowedly'
mythi-
cal' or figurative
modes of expression precisely at the crucial
or culminating
points of an argument;
the pervasive irony in
the Socratic
dialogues;
the intrinsic
logical difficulties of the
problems
raised;
the apparent
irreconcilability
of the argu-
ments of some of the dialogues with those of others; the differ-
ence between Aristotle's version of some of Plato's theories and

32
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
that which might be gathered
from his own writings -
these
all give immense room for diversities of interpretation,
and, in
particular,
make it easy for modern exegetes to find in him the
expression, or at least the adumbration,
of doctrines to which
they themselves incline.
I wish, so far as possible, in these lec-
tures to avoid entering upon controverted
questions of exegesis,
or of the intellectual
biography
of individual
writers.
But it
would, no doubt, seem an evasion of a relevant issue if, in speak-
ing of Platonism, no account were taken of these differences in
the conclusions of scholars who have devoted
much of their
lives to the study of the Platonic writings.
The disputed ques-
tion to which some brief reference must at this point be made
is that concerning
the attribution,
not of the writings them-
selves, but of the doctrines (whatever they may be) contained
in them.
The long current
view that, with the exception
of
some of the earlier dialogues in which the Theory
of Ideas
does not appear,
Plato was propounding
a metaphysical
doc-
trine of his own which went far beyond the teaching of Socra-
tes, is still affirmed by the most eminent
of German
Plato-
scholars, Constantin
Ritter,
who, indeed,
in his most recent
work, assures his readers that"
no one doubts this."
1
But in
fact there has been a marked, though not universal, tendency
among recent British students
of Plato to attribute
the con-
ceptions
and
arguments
which
are put
into
the mouth
of
Socrates or the other principal interlocutors
in the dialogues to
these philosophers,
rather
than to Plato himself.
If Burnet's
contentions
are right,
the entire
Theory
of Ideas
must
be
ascribed to Socrates, of the substance of whose final philosophy
Plato, a sort of greater Boswell, was, in the dialogues in which
Socrates is the chief speaker, merely giving an objective and
historically
trustworthy
report.
It is, according
to Burnet,
questionable
whether
Plato ever accepted
that
theory;
it is
certain that when he began to set forth his own distinctive and
original opinions he had already rejected it, and that the Pla-
tonic teaching, properly so called, was concerned, not with the
Ideas, but mainly with"
two things which
hardly
play any
part in his earlier writings, or at least only in a mythical form,
namely, God and the Soul," these being now treated"
quite
simply and without
any touch of mythical
imagery."
2
The

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
33
anthropomorphic
God of the Timaeus and the Laws, in short,
not the Idea of the Good, is the supreme theme of Plato's own
philosophy;
and the story of the creation
in the former dia-
logue is (it would seem to be implied) to be taken, in the main,
literally, and not as a myth expressing in figurative and popu-
lar language
a far subtler
metaphysical
conception.
And
while one great
authority
thus
regards
as probably
non-
Platonic
the theory
most conspicuous
in the dialogues
of
Plato's middle period, in which Socrates still sustains the bur-
den of the argument,
another, Professor A. E. Taylor, deals in
a similar manner
with the most important
of the later ones.
Agreeing substantially
with Burnet that we "have no right to
assume without proof" that, for example, "the doctrine of the
Phaedoand the Republicwas ever taught by Plato as his own,"
Taylor adds that it is equally "a mistake to look in the Timaeus
for any revelation
of distinctively
Platonic doctrines."
3 The
theories therein expounded
are -
or were by Plato conceived
to be -
those of the speaker whose name the dialogue bears, a
South-Italian
philosopher and medical man of an earlier gen-
eration, a contemporary
of Empedocles, who sought to amal-
gamate
the biological
ideas of that
philosopher
"with
the
Pythagorean
religion and mathematics."
4
This is "in fact
the main thesis" of that work of vast learning which is Taylor's
Commentaryon the Timaeus.t
If we accept both conclusions, a
great part of what has usually been regarded as the philosophy
of Plato is taken away from him and assigned to other and
earlier thinkers; and most of the dialogues are to be understood
mainly as contributions
to the history of pre-Platonic
specula-
tion.
From this it would follow that
Plato himself (in his
extant writings) must be regarded chiefly as a historian of other
men's philosophies rather than as a great original philosopher.
In spite of the admirable
learning
and force of argument
with which these views have been defended, I find it, I confess,
difficult to accept them; and the difficulty is especially great
with respect to those dialogues which present various aspects of
the Theory of Ideas.
That Plato should, solely out of piety to
his early teacher, have devoted a great part of his mature life
as a writer to expounding,
with apparent
fervor and incom-
parable
eloquence
(which was pretty
certainly
not that
of

34
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Socrates himself), a doctrine which he did not desire to incul-
cate nor believe to be true, seems to me psychologically very
improbable.
Nor are we without
better evidence than psy-
chological
probabilities.
There
are two weighty
evidences
against Burnet's theory.
The first is the testimony of Aristotle,
who was extremely unlikely to be ignorant
upon the matter
and had no conceivable motive for misrepresenting
it. And he
plainly and repeatedly reports that Socrates occupied himself
only with questions of moral philosophy and not at all with
"the general nature of things," and that Plato introduced
the
name and the conception
of the" Ideas" -
in short, that he
was responsible for the transformation
of the Socratic ethics and
logic of definition into a metaphysics."
The other piece of evi-
dence lies in a writing
of Plato's which has been singularly
neglected.
Its authenticity,
it is true, has sometimes been dis-
puted;
but
few recent
Plato
scholars
question
it.
In the
Seventh
Epistle, probably
written
near the end of his life,
Plato presents not only a vindication
of his political activities
but a summary of the fundamentals
of his philosophy."
There
is here no dramatic dialogue to render dubious the ascription
of the doctrine
set forth, no playful irony, no myth.
Plato
speaks in his own person and with the utmost
earnestness.
And the doctrine
is essentially that of the Phaedrus and the
sixth and seventh books of the Republic. It is the Theory of
Ideas culminating
in a frank mysticism.
His deepest
and
"most serious" conviction, Plato declares, is, "by reason of the
weakness inherent
in language,"
incapable
of adequate
ex-
pression in words; and he therefore never has attempted,
and
never will attempt,
really to convey it by mere
writing or
speech to other men.
It can be gained only by a sudden illumi-
nation, in a soul prepared for it by austerity of life and disci-
pline of the intellect.
Nevertheless,
"there
is a certain true
argument"
which both leads towards it and makes clear why,
in itself, it must remain ineffable.
What that argument shows
is that the true objects of rational knowledge, the only genuine
realities, are the immutable essences of things -
of circles and
all figures, of all bodies, of all living creatures, of all affections
of the soul, of the good and the fair and the just.
These essences
are never identical with the fleeting objects which are their

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
35
sensible manifestations,
nor even with our thoughts
of them;
nor can their nature be more than adumbrated
in verbal defi-
nitions.
Thus Plato's philosophic
testament
is nothing
other
than a reaffirmation
of the doctrine
of Ideas in its most un-
qualified and mystical form -
and a declaration
that it is this
which he has "many times set forth" in his previous writings. 8
While, for these and other reasons, I find the view that Plato
was not the author of Platonism unconvincing,
it is incumbent
upon any contemporary
expositor to recognize that there is a
formidable
weight of scholarly opinion in favor of it.
It may,
then, be the case that what I have to say of Plato's
part in
the history of the ideas that here concern
us is true, not of
him, but of other men who were before him.
But for our pur-
pose the distinction
is of minor importance.
The Plato with
whom we are here concerned is the author of the Dialogues,the
Plato whose words, whether
they expressed his own concep-
tions or not,
have
profoundly
influenced
Western
thought
through
all the subsequent
centuries.
The Neoplatonists,
the
Schoolmen,
the philosophers
and poets of the Renaissance,
of
the Enlightenment,
and of the Romantic
period, were, perhaps
unfortunately,
unacquainted
with the theories of recent classi-
cal scholars.
1'0 them, Platonism was the entire body of con-
ceptions and reasonings contained
in the dialogues which they
knew; and it was to them a single and, in the main, coherent
system of thought
-
as it still is in the eyes of some not less
learned contemporary
exegetes.
Now this Plato, it need hardly be said, is the main historic
source of the indigenous
strain
of otherworldliness
in Occi-
dental philosophy
and religion, as distinguished
from the im-
ported Oriental
varieties.
It is through him, as Dean Inge has
said, "that
the conception of an unseen eternal world, of which
the visible world is but a pale copy, gains a permanent
foot-
hold in the West. . .. The call, once heard, has never long been
forgotten
in Europe";
9 and it is from his writings, it is to be
added,
that
the belief that
the highest good for man lies in
somehow
translocating
himself into such a world
has been
perennially
nourished.
That
the otherworldliness
which his
successors certainly learnedjrom
Plato was ever taught by him
-
or is to be found in the Dialogues-
is, indeed, another mat-

36
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
ter about which learned
opinion differs.
It is zealously main-
tained by Ritter
that there is in the Theory of Ideas in general
nothing
of what
he calls"
a fantastic
view -of reality."
The
fundamental
contention
of that theory is merely that our judg-
ments, both of fact and of value, when reached
by due process
of reflection,
possess objective
validity
(" the Platonic
Idea is
the expression of the simple thought
that every rightly formed
conception
has its solid basis in objective reality"
10),and that
we can therefore attain
a knowledge
of things as they are inde-
pendently
of our apprehension
of them.
It is, of course, true
that
the objective
counterparts
of true"
representations,"
of
which
Plato
speaks,
are
universals,
corresponding
to class-
names.
But this does not imply a "doctrine
of a transcendent
realm
of Ideas"
11 subsisting
by themselves
apart
from
the
things of this world in which they are manifested.
'Ideas'
are
universals
because words always designate universals;
and true
knowledge
is of Ideas chiefly in the sense that"
every repre-
sentation
as such has a universal
relation,
not the individual
phenomenon,
as its content."
12 A general concept is the result
of an act of classification;
and a classification
is correct if" it is
not purely subjective,
but has a basis in the objective relations
of the things classified,"
if it presents
together
a complex
of
properties
which
actually
occur
together
in nature,
in that
particular
collection of existing things to which we give a single
name,
and"
is not a combination
put together
merely by our
fancy
out
of elements
which
experience,
indeed,
furnishes
separately,
but not in such association."
13 No doubt some of
"the
Platonic
myths
and
the kindred
poetic
similes of the
Symposium, Republic and Phaedrus" suggest that Plato did mean
something
more than
this by " Ideas,"
but these passages are
but Phantasiegemiilde;they were not meant by their author to be
taken seriously,
and the modern
reader
"cannot
be too em-
phatically
warned
against
the common
but
gross fallacy
of
treating
them as of equal significance with the results methodi-
cally reached"
by Plato "through
scientific inquiry."
14
But this version
of the Platonic
teaching
-
or of what
is
most emphasized
and most characteristic
in it -
seems to me,
despite the great learning
of its author,
essentially
wrong.
It
rests partly upon the highly improbable
assumption
that Aris-

GENESIS
OF THE
IDEA
37
totle's
account
of the Theory
of Ideas is false, not merely in
some degree, but in substance
and upon the main point.
Now
Aristotle was not a philosophically
unintelligent
person; he was
for twenty years a pupil and associate of Plato's in the Acad-
emy; and when he wrote many other men were still living who
could judge, from their own knowledge,
of the general correct-
ness of his interpretation.
It is true that
we have reason
to
think that he was disposed to make the most of the points of
difference between his own philosophy
and his master's;
this is
not uncommon
with pupils.
But that he completely
misrepre-
sented the nature
of Plato's
central
doctrine
it is hard to be-
lieve.
Nor can such a toning-down
and simplification
of the
Platonic
doctrine
be reconciled
without
violence with certain
of the Dialoguesthemselves;
while it conflicts absolutely
with
the evidence of the Seventh Epistle.
It can be held only upon
the arbitrary
assumption
that
what
seems "fantastic"
to a
modern
philosopher
of a certain
school cannot
possibly have
seemed true to a Greek philosopher
of the fifth century B. C.
It
requires
us, inter alia, to suppose
that just
those conclusions
which Socrates and all the interlocutors
in the Phaedoagree are
logically demonstrable
with the highest degree of certainty
15
were
for
both
Socrates
and
Plato
mere
flights
of poetic
fancy;
and it requires
us also to dismiss as little more than
irrelevant
rhetorical
embellishments
nearly all the myths and
similitudes
in Plato.
It is true that he himself warns us that
these are not to be taken literally;
but this is not equivalent
to saying that
they are not to be taken
seriously,
that
they
are not figurative
intimations
of theses which Plato regards as
both true and important,
but difficult to convey"
in matter-
moulded
forms of speech."
It is -
especially
in the Republic
-
precisely when he reaches the height of his argument,
the
conceptions
which for him are plainly the most certain and the
most momentous,
that he begins to speak in parables.
He does
so, as he there also explains, because in these ultimate
reaches
of his thought
the terms of common
language
fail him;
the
truth
can only be shadowed
forth through
sensible analogues,
as in a glass darkly.
But that he insisted that philosophy,
the
highest knowledge,
is concerned,
not with things that change,
not even with the constant
general
laws of concomitance
and

38
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
succession which hold good of these things and their changes,
nor yet solely with the truths of mathematics,
but with a tran-
scendent realm of pure noumena
of which the natural
world is
only a dim and distorted
shadow -
this can be denied only if
we are willing to treat
as negligible
a whole series of Plato's
most distinctive
and most emphatic
utterances.
But since this
dissent of mine from the opinion
of so eminent
a specialist as
Ritter
may well seem both rash and dogmatic,
I am happy to
be able to support
it by the weighty Judgment
of Professor
Shorey:
"The
hypostatized
ideas
are
Plato's
Ding-an-sich,
deliberately
accepted
with
full perception
of the apparent
absurdity
of the doctrine
from the point of view of common
sense."
16 "Plato's
fearless and consistent
realism is so repug-
nant to 'common
sense' that modern
critics either take it as a
proof of the naivete,
not to say childishness,
of his thought,
or
extenuate
the paradox
by arguing
that he cannot
have meant
it seriously and must have abandoned
or modified the doctrine
in his maturer
works.
All such interpretations
spring from a
failure to grasp the real character
of the metaphysical
problem
and the historical
conditions
that made Plato grasp and cling
to this solution."
17
So long, however,
as Plato's metaphysics
is occupied
with a
multiplicity
of eternal
Ideas, corresponding
to all the natural
variety of things, its otherworldliness
is manifestly of a peculiar
and partial
kind.
The sensible world was never for Plato a
mere illusion or a mere evil.
And the other world, as well as
this, was a plurality;
and there was also a plurality
of individ-
ual souls, permanently
separate
from one another
and distinct
from the Ideas, even when translated
into that higher region.
The
system in this phase
was thus relatively
free from the
monistic
sort of metaphysical
pathos,
though
perhaps
richer
than
any other
in the eternalistic.
The World
of Ideas was
rather
a glorified, detemporalized
replica of this world than a
blank negation
of it.
The'
Idea'
of an object of sense, though
it be conceived
as immutable
and not apprehensible
through
the physical organs of perception,
is still only a congealed
and
inefficacious
counterpart
of that
object -
with
some of its
characteristics
left indeterminate.
Nothing
of the rich quali-
tative diversity
of nature
is -
or, at all events, should be-

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
39
left out: simple sensible qualities; the non-temporal
relations
which subsist between natural objects; the complex groupings
of such qualities and relations, which make up the 'what'
of
the things we experience;
and with these, all the moral and
aesthetic qualities, justice and temperance
and beauty -
all
are simply projected into another realm of being, where each
may be the better enjoyed aesthetically
by virtue of its con-
ceived exemption from passage and alteration and of the irrel-
evance to it, in its eternal fixity, of all human
planning
and
striving.
It presents no objects to be achieved; there is nothing
to be doneabout it; to contemplate
it is, after all, to enjoy, in
James's phrase, a "moral
holiday."
But what is contemplated
consists of the ingredients
of the world we know viewed sub
qutidamspecieaeternitatis-
with perhaps,
for Plato at times,
some illicit exclusions of the essences which, even when so
viewed, are not pleasing matter for contemplation.
It is true
that Plato himself did not use his World of Ideas as a resort in
which to take moral holidays.
He was bent upon making it in-
strumental
to terrestrial
ends, upon deriving concrete moral
and political lessons from it; and he has been reproached
for
this by Mr. Santayana,
who finds him ignorant of the nature
of the" spiritual life," for which the disinterested
contempla-
tion of the essences is sufficient, which has no preferences and
is "disintoxicated"
from the values, moral as well as sensual,
that engross our lives as temporal and active creatures.
"Pure
Being is infinite, its essence includes all essences; how then
should it issue particular
commands,
or be an acrimonious
moralist?"
In this criticism
Mr.
Santayana
has, I think,
pointed out a real inconsistency in Plato; though I also think,
as apparently
Mr. Santayana
does not, that it was a happy
inconsistency.
It is only when, in the Republic,Plato introduces an Idea of
Ideas, from which the others seem to be conceived as in some
obscure manner
derivative,
that
he plainly
appears
as the
father of otherworldliness
in the West-though
Parmenides,
no doubt, was its Urgrossvater. Here, as elsewhere, there is no
question as to the nature of Plato's historic influence; the com-
pletely 'other'
and ineffable'
One,' the Absolute of the Neo-
platonists, it is certain, was for those philosophers,
and their

40
THE GREA'F CHAIN OF BEING
many later echoers, medieval
and modern, Jewish, Moslem,
and Christian,
an interpretation
of Plato's'
Idea of the Good.'
But here also, as before, the contemporary
specialists in Pla-
tonic studies are not agreed
that
what came out of Plato's
doctrine
was contained
in it.
Ritter,
in accordance
with his
general eagerness to free the Theory of Ideas from any strain
of" the fantastic or grossly non-natural,"
finds the" Idea of the
Good"
synonymous with"
the state of good," and holds that
both expressions signify only that the concept associated with
the word 'good'
is "no
mere fanciful creation
of our own
thought,
but has an independent,
objective reality";
and this
proposition,
he thinks, can be otherwise expressed by saying
that"
the world of actuality
is really so constituted
that we
have reason to call it good, to regard good as dominant
in it."
What, in short, Plato is affirming, in what he says about the
Idea of the Good, is " the reign of a rational divine power in all
that exists and all that comes to pass in the world"
(das Walten
einer uemiinftigengottlichen Macht in allem Weltsein und Weltge-
schehen).18This reduces the meaning
of the doctrine
that the
Good is the Idea of Ideas to an optimistic faith in the control of
this world's
temporal
course by a benevolent
providence
-
this faith being at the same time curiously confused with, or
regarded
as the basis of, the assertion of the objective validity
of moral judgments.
That
Plato held both these beliefs, and
that the latter was one of his most persistent and fundamental
convictions, cannot be denied.
But to suppose that this simple
creed was all that Plato meant to convey by his strange and
oracular utterances
about the Idea of the Good is to leave out
of account
precisely what is most conspicuous
and most dis-
tinctive in them.
Against all such tendencies (now much in the
fashion) to, so to say, naturalize
this part of Plato's teaching,
his own words too loudly speak.
For there are certain things which the Republicsurely makes
plain enough about Plato's conception of that Idea.
First, that
it is for him -
or for the Platonic
Socrates -
the most in-
dubitable
of all realities.
Second, that it is an Idea or essence
-
"Good itself," in distinction from the particular
and chang-
ing existences which in varying degrees participate
in its na-
ture;
19 and that it therefore has the properties common to all

GENESIS OF THE
IDEA
41
the Ideas,
of which
the most fundamental
are eternity
and
immutability.
Third,
that
it is the polar
opposite
to 'this'
world;
to apprehend
it, the faculty of knowledge,
along with the whole soul, must be wheeled round from that which is sub-
ject to becoming until it is able to endure the contemplation
of that which
is, and the most resplendent part thereof; and this, we declare, is the Good."
Fourth,
that its true nature
is therefore
ineffable in the forms
of ordinary
speech; it is "an
indescribable
beauty,"
and can-
not be literally
brought
under
even the most universal
of the
categories
applicable
to other
objects of thought;
"far
from
being identical
with reality"
-
i. e., in any sense in which
other
things
have
reality -
"it
actually
transcends
it
in
dignity and potency."
21 Fifth, that the Form of the Good is
the universal
object of desire, that which draws all souls to-
wards itself; and that the chief good for man even in this life is
nothing
but
the contemplation
of this absolute
or essential
Good.
It is true that those who have become capable
of the
contemplative
life must be compelled
to forgo it in order
to
become the rulers of the state; but this is for them a temporary
sacrifice of their
own highest
felicity for the sake of others.
Those who have caught
some vision of the Good "will
not
willingly
busy themselves
about
the affairs of men, but will
ever be eager to occupy themselves
with the things that are
above."
22 In this world's business they will at first, indeed, be
clumsy enough -
so different is it from that contemplation
of
the divine which they once enjoyed.
For the genuine
knowl-
edge of the Good is for Plato certainly
no mere acquaintance
with
natural
laws, and
no pragmatic
wisdom,
even of the
highest degree.
It is not possessed by those who merely have
"the
keenest eye for the passing object and remember
best all
that used to precede and follow and accompany
it," and from
this" are best able to foresee what is going to happen
next."
23
The interpreters
of Plato in both ancient and modern
times
have endlessly disputed
over the question
whether
this con-
ception
of the absolute
Good was for him identical
with the
conception
of God.
Stated thus simply, the question is mean-
ingless, since the word 'God'
is in the last degree ambiguous.
But if it be taken as standing for what the Schoolmen called the

42
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
ens perfectissimum, the summit
of the hierarchy
of being, the
ultimate
and only completely satisfying object of contempla-
tion and adoration,
there can be little doubt that the Idea of
the Good was the God of Plato; and there can be none that it
became the God of Aristotle, and one of the elements or 'as-
pects' of the God of most of the philosophic theologies of the
Middle Ages, and of nearly all the modern Platonizing
poets
and philosophers.
And though
in Plato, as in his followers,
some vague notion of a sublimated
mode of conscious life and
blissful feeling probably persisted even in the conception of this
otherworldly
Absolute,"
beyond this the attributes
of such a
God were, in strictness, expressible only in negations
of the
attributes of this world.
You could take, one after another, any
quality or relation or kind of object presented in natural
ex-
perience, and say, with the Sage in the Upanishad:
'The true
reality is not like this, it is not like that'
-
adding only that it
is s.omething far better.
It was nevertheless
by a peculiar
dialectic
of his own-
quite different, for example; from that which is exemplified in
the monism of the Vedanta
-
that Plato reached this climax
of the otherworldly
strain in his philosophizing.
His Absolute
was the Idea of the Good; and the term 'good'
for him, as in
most Greek thought,
connoted,
above all, a certain definite,
though still essentially negative, characteristic.
This is mani-
fest in nearly all the Greek schools of moral philosophy which
descended from Socrates -
in the temper of the ideal Cynic,
Diogenes, who needed and wanted nothing that any other man
could give him, in the ataraxy of the Epicureans, in the apathy
of the Stoics.
The essence of 'good,'
even in ordinary human
experience, lay in self-containment,
freedom from all depend-
ence upon
that
which
is external
to the individual.
And
when 'the Good' is hypostatized
and made the essence of the
supreme reality, the term has the same connotation,
except
that
it is now taken in an absolute
and unqualified
sense.
"The
Good," says. Plato in the Philehus,"differs in its nature
from everything else in that the being who possesses it always
and in all respects has the most perfect sufficiency and is never
in need of any other thing."
25 "The
claims of both pleasure
and mind to be the Good itself" are, in the argument
of the

GENESIS OF THE
IDEA
43
dialogue,
"alike
set aside"
on the ground
that"
both of them
lack self-sufficiency (avrapKELa)and adequacy
and complete-
ness."
26 Such is the property
in which all particular'
goods'
in some degree participate;
such in its fullness is the attribute
which distinguishes
the Absolute Being from all others.
Now there was plainly implicit in this dialectic of the Idea of
the Good a strange consequence,
which was to dominate
the
religious
thought
of the West for more
than
two thousand
years and is, though no longer dominant,
still potent in it.
If
by , God' you meant -
among many other and seemingly in-
compatible
things -
the Being who is, or eternally
possesses,
the good in the highest degree; and if " the good" meant abso-
lute self-sufficiency;
and if all imperfect
and finite and tem-
poral beings are, as such, not to be identified
with the divine
essence -
then it manifestly
followed that
their existence -
that is, the existence of the entire sensible world in time, and
of all conscious beings who are not in any sense genuinely self-
sufficient -
can bring
no addition
of excellence
to reality.
The fullness of good is attained
once for all in God; and"
the
creatures"
add nothing to it. They have from the divine point
of view no value; if they were not, the universe would be none
the worse.
Plato himself, it is true, does not explicitly draw out
this consequence,
and the fact that he does not is, no doubt,
significant,
But it is nevertheless in the clear implication
of this
part of his doctrine that we must recognize the primary
source
of that
endlessly repeated
theorem
of the philosophic
theo-
logians that God has no need of a world and is indifferent
to it
and all that
goes on in it.
This implication
of the Platonic
Idea of the Good speedily became explicit in the theology of
Aristotle.
"One
who is self-sufficient,"
he writes in the Eude-
mian Ethics, "can
have no need of the service of others, nor of
their affection,
nor of social life, since he is capable
of living
alone.
This is especially evident in the case of God.
Clearly,
since he is in need of nothing, God cannot have need of friends,
nor will he have any."
27
It is -
to cite, by way of anticipa-
tion, only one or two out of a thousand
later examples -
this
Platonic
as well as Aristotelian
strain that Jonathan
Edwards
may be heard echoing in Colonial America, when he declares:
"No notion of God's last end in creation of the world is agree-

44
THE GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
able to reason which would truly imply or infer any indigence,
insufficiency and mutability
in God; or any dependence
of the
Creator
on the creature,
for any part of his perfection
or hap-
piness.
Because it is evident,
by both Scripture
and reason,
that God is infinitely,
eternally,
unchangeably
and independ-
ently glorious and perfect; that he stands in no need of, cannot
be profited
by, or receive anything
from the creature,
or be
truly hurt, or be the subject of any suffering or impair of his
glory and
felicity from any other
being."
28
This eternally
serene and impassible Absolute is, manifestly,
somewhat
diffi-
cult to recognize in the sadistic deity of the sermon on "Sinners
in the Hands
of an Angry God";
but Edwards
did not differ
froIn most of the great theologians
in having many Gods under
one name.
This element
in the Platonic
tradition,
no doubt,
has owed its persistence to the fact that it corresponds
to one of
the natural
varieties of religious experience.
There
is plainly
one type or mood of religious imagination
and feeling, and a
concomitant
kind of theological
dialectic,
which can be satis-
fied with nothing less than an assurance of the utter isolation of
the supreme
object of contemplation
from the natural
world,
and
its sublime
indifference
even to its worshippers.
The
perennial
vitality
of this way of thinking
may be seen in the
expression of it by a writer in many respects extremely'
mod-
ern,'
in whom
one would
not
have
anticipated
finding
it.
"The
artistic
and intellectual
consciousness,"
Mr.
C. E. M.
Joad has recently declared,
"are exalted, not degraded,
by the
otherness of their objects.
The point applies with even greater
force to the religious consciousness.
A Deity who, conceived as
permanent
and perfect, yet enters into relation
with a world
which is changing
and imperfect,
with the changing
and im-
perfect human
beings that inhabit
it, or with the principle
of
life that animates it, is diminished
in respect of the qualities for
which he is venerated.
Like Goodness and Beauty,
Deity, if
Deity exists, must be a non-human
value, whose significance
consists in His very unlikeness
to the life that aspires to Him.
He may be known by life, and, as life evolves and develops, He
may be known increasingly,
...
but God himself is unaffected
by such contemplation
....
He is unaware
of the movement.
of life towards Him. . ..
God, it is obvious, if He is to be an

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
45
object worthy of our adoration
must be kept unspotted
from
the world that adores him."
29 That
is a contemporary
and
quite precise phrasing
of a characteristic
note of the mode of
otherworldliness
which soon developed
out of -
if it was not
quite unequivocally
expressed in -
the Platonic doctrine con-
cerning the Idea of the Good.
Now if Plato had stopped
here, the subsequent
history of
Western thought
would, it can hardly be doubted,
have been
profoundly different from what it has been.
But the most no-
table -
and the less noted -
fact about his historic influence
is that he did not merely give to European
otherworldliness
its
characteristic
form and phraseology and dialectic, but that he
also gave the characteristic
form and phraseology and dialectic
to precisely the contrary tendency -
to a peculiarly exuberant
kind of this-worldliness.
For his own philosophy
no sooner
reaches its climax in what we may call the otherworldly
direc-
tion than it reverses its course.
Having arrived at the concep-
tion of an Idea of Ideas which is a pure perfection alien to all
the categories of ordinary
thought
and in need of nothing ex-
ternal to itself, he forthwith finds in just this transcendent
and
absolute Being the necessitating logical ground of the existence
of this world; and he does not stop short of the assertion of the
necessity and worth of the existence of all conceivable kinds of
finite, temporal, imperfect, and corporeal beings.
Plato clearly
was dissatisfied
with
a philosophy
in which
no ground
or
explanation
of the existence of mundane
things, and of the
number
and diversity of their several modes and degrees of
imperfection,
was so much as suggested, and in which the flux
was a wholly
senseless and
supererogatory
addition
to the
Eternal.
And if any reason for the being of the sensible world
was to be found, it must necessarily, for Plato, be found in the
Intellectual
World,
and in the very nature
of the sale Self-
Sufficing Being.
The not-so-good, not to say the bad, must be
apprehended
as derivative
from the Idea of the Good, as in-
volved in the essence of Perfection.
The self-same God who
was the Goal of all desire must also be the Source of the crea-
tures that desire it.
This crucial turn in Plato's doctrine first becomes apparent

THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEiNG
in the same passage of the Republic in which the 'otherness'
of
the Idea of the Good is so insistently
declared.s?
The Good is
"not
only, to all things known
[i. e., by us] the cause of their
being known, but also of their existence and their reality"
-
of the sort of reality they possess, which, as we have seen, is so
different for Plato from that of" the Good"
that he is unwilling
to use the same term for both.
The transition
here is, no doubt,
too abrupt
and oracular
to be intelligible;
but its meaning
and
its grounds in Plato's mind are to be found more fully indicated
in a passage of that later dialogue
which -
though,
as Jowett
said, it is to most modern
readers"
the most obscure and re-
pulsive"
-
nevertheless
had
for two
millennia
by far
the
greatest
influence
of all the Platonic
writings.
In the Timaeus
Plato definitely undertakes
the return journey
from that higher
region
of "absolute
being"
to the
lower
world
which
his
thought
in certain
moods, and perhaps
in an earlier phase, so
eagerly
outsoared."
It is true that
much
of this dialogue
is
expressly
mythical,
and that
it is therefore
necessary
to dis-
engage its serious philosophic
content from the poetic imagery.
Where the lines are to be drawn it is not always easy to deter-
mine;
there has been, apparently
from the second generation
of the Academy
to the present
day, disagreement
among
the
learned
on the question
where
the poetry
ends and the phi-
losophy begins.
Into most of these involved controversies
it is,
fortunately,
not essential that we should enter.
Our concern is
solely with
t\VO closely related
conceptions
which the dialogue
first introduces,
so far as we know, into the general
stock of
Occidental
philosophical
ideas.
The first is an answer to the
question:
Why is there any World of Becoming, in addition
to
the eternal
World
of Ideas,
or, indeed,
to the one supreme
Idea?
The second is an answer to the question:
What principle
determines
the number
of kinds of being
that
make up the
sensible and temporal
world?
And the answer to the second
question is for Plato -
or at all events for the philosopher
who
holds forth in the dialogue
-
implicit
in the answer
to the
first.
Both of these are questions of a sort which, for the most part,
philosophers
no longer ask -
though some modern
physicists,
who are perhaps
the boldest
speculative
minds
of our time,

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
47
have attempted
a kind of answer to the second.
It was re-
marked
more than half a century ago by T. H. Green that
"every form of the question why the world as a whole should
be what it is, ...
is unanswerable."
32 There is scarcely any
general
contrast
between
the Platonic
strain
in European
thought down to the late eighteenth century and the philoso-
phy of more recent times which is more significant than this.
For to acknowledge
that such questions
are necessarily in-
soluble or meaningless is to imply that, so far as we can judge,
the world is in final analysis non-rational,
that its being at all,
and its possessing the extent that it has and the range of di-
versity which its components exhibit, and its conformity to the
very curious set of primary laws which empirical science dis-
covers -
that these are just brute facts for which no intelligible
reason can be given, and which might equally well have been
other than they are.
If that is the case, the constitution of the
world is but a whim or an accident.
But Plato transmitted
to
later Greek and medieval and early modern philosophy
the
vast assumption -
which was, indeed, more than once chal-
lenged -
that these questions may and should be asked; and
he provided,
for those after him who asked them, the long
accepted answer.
The history we are to review is thus, among
other things, a part of the history of Western man's long effort
to make the world he lives in appear to his intellect a rational
one.
The answer to the first question is introduced in a simple and
doubtless
figurative
phrase,
which was to be reiterated
by
countless later philosophers and poets.
Before beginning
the
story of the genesis of the world, "let us," says Timaeus, "state
the cause wherefor he who constructed it did construct Becom-
ing and the universe."
The reason is that"
he was good, and
in one that is good no envy of anything else ever arises. Being
devoid of envy, then, he desired that everything should be so
far as possible like himself.
This, then, we shall be wholly
right in accepting from wise men as being above all the sover-
eign originating
principle of Becoming and of the cosmos."
33
What did these sentences mean -
or at all events, what were
they understood
to mean by later Platonists?
The being to
whom"
goodness" is here ascribed is nominally the anthropo-

48
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
morphic Artificer of the world who is the hero of the creation--
myth which the dialogue relates.
But if we are to assume that
the doctrine of this dialogue is at all reconcilable
with that of
the Republic -
to which the Timaeus is presented
as a sort of
supplement
-
the details of the myth, and most of the char-
acteristics and activities ascribed to the Demiurgus,
cannot be
taken literally;
nor have they been so taken by most ancient
and modern followers of Plato.
In the Republic the ground and
source of all being, we have seen, is the Idea of the Good itself;
and it has therefore been held by many interpreters
that the
Creator who figures in the Timaeus is simply a poetic personifi-
cation of that Idea, or -
as the Neoplatonists
construed it -
an emanation,
or subordinate
divinity,
through
which
the
world-generating
function
of the Absolute
and Perfect One
was exercised.
More probable
than either is the view that the
two originally distinct strains in Plato's thought are here fused,
and the resultant
conception
then given a largely figurative
expression.
Plato had in his philosophy
two classes of super-
sensible and permanent
beings which were in other respects
quite different in nature,
as the conceptions
of them were in
their historic origins -
' Ideas' and' souls.'
Ideas were eternal
objects of pure thought,
souls were everlasting
conscious and
thinking
beings;
and
since the former
were
universals
or
essences, and the latter were individuals,
they could not easily
be reduced to unity.
But it is at least a probable conjecture
-
which can be supported
by specific passages -
that Plato in
the end conceived of the highest members
of both series as
somehow identical.
If so, the Demiurgus
of the
Timaeus, as
"the best soul," may be regarded
as possessing fully the attri-
butes of "that
which is good in itself" -
however figurative
we may suppose the greater part of the characterization
of it to
be.
One or another
of these three interpretations
must be
adopted if we are to assume that the Platonic doctrine has any
unity and coherency whatever.
In any case, the passage tells us that
the supramundane
being whose reality accounts for the existence of this world was
"good."
And we must keep in mind that, for any Platonist,
nothing
partook
in any degree of the nature
or essence ex-
pressed by the word'
good,' except
in so far as it was self-

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
49
sufficient.
In the Timaeus itself, the excellence,
after its own
fashion, even of the created world, is made to consist in a sort
of relative and physical self-sufficiency; the material
universe
was" so designed that all its active and all its passive processes
occurred within itself and by its own agency, since he that con-
structed
it deemed
that
it would
be better
if it were self-
sufficient rather
than in need of other things."
34 The"
best
soul"
would clearly, upon this Platonic
principle,
not be the
best if it had need, for its own existence or excellence or happi-
ness, of anything other than itself. Yet when he sets about tell-
ing us the reason for being of this world, Plato exactly reverses
the essential meaning
of "good."
In part,
no doubt,
he is
taking advantage
of the double signification
which the word
had in Greek as in modern usage.
But the metaphor
which he
employs in making the transition suggests that he was attempt-
ing to reconcile the two senses, and, indeed, to derive the one
from the other.
A self-sufficient being who is eternally
at the
goal, whose perfection is beyond all possibility of enhancement
or diminution,
couldnot be "envious"
of anything
not itself.
Its reality could be no impediment
to the reality, in their own
way, of beings other than it alike in existence and in kind and
in excellence; on the contrary,
unless it were somehow produc-
tive of them,
it would lack a positive element
of perfection,
would not be so complete as its very definition implies that it is.
And thus Plato, tacitly making the crucial assumption that the
existence of many entities not eternal,
not supersensible,
and
far from perfect, was inherently
desirable,
finds in his other-
worldly Absolute,
in the Idea of the Good itself, the reason
why that Absolute
cannot
exist alone.
The concept
of Self-
Sufficing Perfection,
by a bold logical inversion, was -
with-
out losing any of its original implications
-
converted into the
concept of a Self-Transcending
Fecundity.
A timeless and in-
corporeal
One
became
the
logical
ground
as well as the
dynamic
source of the existence of a temporal
and material
and extremely multiple and variegated
universe.
The proposi-
tion that -
as it was phrased
in the Middle
Ages -
omne
bonumest dijJusivumsui here makes its appearance
as an axiom
of metaphysics.
With this reversal there was introduced
into
European
philosophy
and theology the combination
of ideas

50
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
that for centuries
was to give rise to many of the most char-
acteristic
internal
conflicts, the logically and emotionally
op-
posing strains, which mark its history -
the conception
of (at
least) Two-Gods-in-One,
of a divine
completion
which was
yet notcomplete in itself, since it could not be itself without the
existence of beings other than itself and inherently
incomplete;
of an Immutability
which required,
and expressed
itself in,
Change; of an Absolute which was nevertheless not truly abso-
lute because it was related,
at least by way of implication
and
causation,
to entities
whose nature
was not
its nature
and
whose existence and perpetual
passage were antithetic
to its
immutable
subsistence.
The dialectic
by which Plato arrives
at this combination
may seem to many modern
ears uncon-
vincing and essentially verbal, and its outcome no better than
a contradiction;
but we shall fail to understand
a large and
important
part of the subsequent
history of ideas in the West
if we ignore the fact that just this dual dialectic dominated
the
thought
of many generations,
and even more potently in me-
dieval and modern than in ancient times.
To the second question -
How many kinds of temporal
and
imperfect
beings must this world contain?
-
the answer fol-
lows by the same dialectic:
all possible kinds.
The"
best soul"
could begrudge
existence to nothing
that
could conceivably
possess it, and "desired
that all things should be as like himself
as they could be."
"All things"
here could consistently mean
for Plato nothing
less than the sensible counterparts
of every
one of the Ideas;
and, as Parmenides
in the dialogue bearing
his name
(I30c,
e) reminds
the young
Socrates,
there
are
in the World of Ideas the essences of all manner of things, even
things paltry or ridiculous
or disgusting.
In the Timaeus, it is
true, Plato speaks chiefly of" living things"
or " animals"
; but
with respect to these, at least, he insists upon the necessarily
complete translation
of all the ideal possibilities into actuality.
It must not, he says, "be thought
that the world was made in
the likeness of any Idea that is merely partial;
for nothing in-
complete
is beautiful.
We must suppose rather
that it is the
perfect image of the whole of which all animals -
both in-
dividuals and species -
are parts.
For the pattern
of the uni-
verse contains within itself the intelligible
forms of all beings

GENESIS
OF THE
IDEA
5 I
just as this world comprehends
us and all other visible crea-
tures.
For the Deity, wishing to make this world like the fairest
and most perfect of intelligible beings, framed one visible living
being containing
within itself all other living beings of like
nature,"
that is, temporal and sensible.
There is a passage in
the Timaeus which seems to imply that there are in the intelli-
gible world Ideas even of individuals,
or at all events of the
most nearly
particularized
universals,
those which
are, by
virtue of the number of their differentiating
qualities, as like
individuals as may be: of the perfect and eternal model, says
Plato,
"the
other
living beings
[i. e., their
"Forms"],
in-
dividually
and generically,
are parts;
and to this model the
cosmos is of all things most like."
35 It-is because the created
universe is an exhaustive replica of the World of Ideas that
Plato argues that there can be only one creation;
it includes
the copies" of all other intelligible creatures,"
and therefore
there is, so to say, nothing left over in the model after which a
second world might be fashioned.
So, in the form of a myth,
the story of the successive creation of things is told.
After all
the
grades
of immortal
beings
have
been
generated,
the
Demiurgus
notes that mortals still remain
uncreated.
This
will not do; if it lack even these the universe will be faulty,
"since it will not contain all sorts of living creatures, as it must
do if it is to be complete."
In order, then, that"
the Whole
may be really All," the Creator deputed to the lesser divinities
who had already been brought into being the task of producing
mortal creatures after their kinds. And thus" the universe was
filled completely
with living beings, mortal
and immortal,"
and thereby became"
a sensible God, which is the image of the
intelligible -
the greatest, the best, the fairest, the most per-
fect."
In short, Plato's Demiurgus
acted literally upon the
principle in which common speech is wont to express the tem-
per not only of universal tolerance but of comprehensive
ap-
probation
of diversity -
that
it takes all kinds to make a
world.
Even if Plato had not given this theological
form to his
answer to the question how many modes of being the universe
must contain, he could hardly have failed to reach the same
conclusion on other grounds.
For the alternative
would have

52
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
been the admission
that, out of the whole range of the Ideas,
only a limited
selection have sensible embodiment.
But this,
we may be fairly sure, would
have seemed to him a strange
anomaly.
If any eternal
essences have temporal
counterparts,
the presumption
was that all do so, that it is of the nature of an
Idea to manifest itself in concrete existences.
If it were not so,
the connection
of the t\VOworlds would have seemed unintelli-
gible, the constitution
of the cosmos, indeed,
of the realm
of
essence itself, a haphazard
and arbitrary
thing.
And it was
wholly contrary
to Plato's way of thinking
to entertain
such a
supposition.
It is this strange and pregnant
theorem of the' fullness' of the
realization
of conceptual
possibility
in actuality,
that, in con-
junction
with two other
ideas usually
associated
with it and
commonly
regarded
as implied
by it, is to be the principal
topic of these lectures.
It has, so far as I know, never been dis-
tinguished
by an appropriate
name;
36 and for want of this, its
identity
in varying
contexts
and in different
phrasings
seems
often to have escaped recognition
by historians,
I shall call it
the principle
of plenitude,
but shall use the term to cover a
wider range of inferences from premises identical
with Plato's
than he himself draws;
i. e., not only the thesis that the uni-
verse is a plenum[ormarum in which
the range
of conceivable.
diversity
of kinds of living things is exhaustively
exemplified,
but also any other
deductions
from the assumption
that
no
genuine
potentiality
of being can remain
unfulfilled,
that the
extent and abundance
of the creation
must be as great as the
possibility of existence and commensurate
with the productive
capacity
of a 'perfect'
and inexhaustible
Source, and that the
world
is the better,
the more
things
it contains.
Before we
proceed
to survey
the later
adventures
and
alliances
of this
principle,
t\VOimplications
latent
in Plato's original enuncia-
tion of it ought to be noted.
(I) In
the
duality
of metaphysical
tendencies
which
we
have now seen to be characteristic
of Platonism
was implicit a
corresponding
reversal
of the
original
Platonic
scheme
of
values -
though
of this also the full consequences
were to be
but tardily worked out.
The Intellectual
World was declared
to be deficient
without
the sensible.
Since a God unsupple-

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
53
mented by nature
in all its diversity would not be "good,"
it
followed that he would not be divine.
And with these proposi-
tions the simile of the Cave in the Republic was implicitly
annulled
-
though Plato himself seems never to have realized
this.
The world of sense could no longer, except by an incon-
sistency, be adequately
described as an idle flickering of insub-
stantial
shadow-shapes,
at two removes from both the good
and the real.
Not only did the sun itself produce
cave, and
fire, and moving shapes, and the shadows, and their beholders,
but in doing so it manifested a property
of its own nature not
less essential -
and, as might well appear,
even more excel-
lent -
than
that
pure radiance
upon which no earthly
eye
could steadfastly
gaze.
The shadows were as needful to the
Sun of the intellectual
heavens as the Sun to the shadows; and
though
opposite to it in kind and separate
from it in being,
their existence was the very consummation
of its perfection.
The entire realm of essence, it was implied, lacked what was
indispensable
to its meaning
and worth so long as it lacked
embodiment.
And it was, logically, no far cry from this to that
later conception
in which the allegory of the Cave was pre-
cisely reversed -
the World of Ideas now becoming an insub-
stantial
thing, a merepattern,
having, like all patterns,
value
only when given concrete realization,
an order of " possibles"
which had but tenuous and meagre being in a sort of ante-
mundane
Kingdom
of the Shades until the boon of existence
was conferred
upon
them.
Why
then,
it could
be asked,
should the mind of man busy itself, either for contemplation
or
for delight,
with, these bare,
abstract,
changeless
Forms
of
things, why should it dwell upon the shadows, when it had be-
fore it sensible realities in all their full-blooded
particularity
and was itself a participant
in that same richer mode of being?
But even where the inversion of the primary
Platonic scheme
of things was not carried
so far as this, it was eventually
to
prove easy to find in the logic of this passage of the Timaeussup-
port for the conviction that the proper business of a Troglodyte
is with the shadows in his cave.
For if he should seek to leave
the dim region assigned him and turn to the sunlit fields with-
out, he would (it could be, and was to be, argued) be counter-
working the Universal
Cause, leaving vacant
a place in that

54
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
general order in which the principle of plenitude required that
every possible place should be filled.
(2) This expansiveness or fecundity of the Good, moreover,
as Plato clearly implies, is not the consequence of any free and
arbitrary
act of choice of the personal Creator in the myth; it
is a dialectical necessity.
The Idea of the Good is a necessary
reality; it cannot be other than what its essence implies; and it
therefore
must, by virtue
of its own nature,
necessarily en-
gender finite existents.
And the number
of kinds of these is
equally predetermined
logically;
the Absolute would not be
what it is if it gave rise to anything less than a complete world
in which the' model,' i. e., the totality of ideal Forms, is trans-
lated into concrete realities.
It follows that every sensible thing
that is, is because it -
or at all events, its sort -
cannot but
be, and be precisely what it is. This implication,
it is true, is
not fully drawn
out by Plato himself; but since it is plainly
immanent
in the Timaeus, he thus bequeathed
to later meta-
physics and theology one of their most persistent, most vexing,
and
most contention-breeding
problems.
The
principle
of
plenitude
had latent
in it a sort of absolute
cosmical deter-
minism
which
attains
its final systematic
formulation
and
practical
application
in the Ethics of Spinoza.
The perfection
of the Absolute Being must be an intrinsic attribute,
a property
inherent in the Idea of it; and since the being and attributes
of
all other
things are derivative
from this perfection
because
they are logically implicit in it, there is no room for any con-
tingency anywhere
in the universe.
The goodness of God -
in the language of religion -
is a constraining
goodness; he is
not, in Milton's
phrase,
"free
to create or not,"
nor free to
choose some possible kinds of beings as the recipients
of the
privilege of existence, while denying it to others.
And since
the characteristics
that each of these has are also, upon Pla-
tonistic principles, inherent
in the eternal Idea of it -
in just
that distinctive possibility of being of which it is the realization
-
neither God nor the creatures could conceivably have been
or done aught other than what they are and do.
But though
the fundamental
conceptions
of the Timaeus were to become
axiomatic
for most medieval
and early modern
philosophy,
against this implication
of them, it is notorious, there has been

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
55
in the Western
mind a perennial
recalcitrance.
The reason-
ings in which this recalcitrance
manifested itself, and the mo-
tives which prompted
it, do not as yet concern us.
The reverse process in Platonism finds no place in the system
of Aristotle.
There is, it is true, much less of the general temper
of otherworldliness
in him than in Plato.
But his God gener-
ates nothing.
Except for a few lapses into the common fashions
of speech, Aristotle adheres consistently to the notion of self-
sufficiency as the essential attribute
of deity; and he sees that it
precludes that sort of dependence
upon others which would be
implied by an inner necessity of producing
them.
It is true
that this Unmoved
Perfection is for Aristotle the cause of all
motion and, it would seem (though there is a duality in Aris-
totle's ideas here), of all the activity of imperfect beings; but it
is their final cause only."
The bliss which God unchangingly
enjoys in his never-ending
self-contemplation
is the Good after
which all other things yearn and, in their various measures and
manners, strive.
But the Unmoved Mover is no world-ground ;
his nature
and existence do not explain why the other things
exist, why there are just so many of them, why the modes and
degrees of their declension from the divine perfection
are so
various.
He therefore cannot provide a basis for the principle
of plenitude.
And that principle is, in fact, formally rejected
by Aristotle in the Metaphysics:"it is not necessary that every-
thing that
is possible should exist in actuality";
and "it
is
possible for that which has a potency not to realize it."
38
On the other hand, it is in Aristotle that we find emerging
another
conception -
that
of continuity
-
which was des-
tined to fuse with the Platonistic
doctrine
of the necessary
'fullness'
of the world, and to be regarded
as logically implied
by it.
Aristotle
did not, indeed,
formulate
the law of con-
tinuity with any such generality as was afterwards given to it.
But he furnished his successors, and especially his late medieval
admirers, with a definition of the continuum:
"Things
are said
to be continuous whenever there is one and the same limit of
both wherein
they overlap
and which they possess in com-
mon."
39 That all quantities
-
lines, surfaces, solids, motions,
and in general
time and space -
must be continuous,
not

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
discrete, Aristotle maintained.t?
That
the qualitative
differ-
ences of things must similarly constitute linear or continuous
series he did not with equal definiteness assert, still less that
they constitute a single continuous
series.
Nevertheless, he is
responsible for the introduction
of the principle of continuity
into natural
history.
That all organisms can be arranged
in
one ascending sequence of forms, he did not, indeed, hold.
He
saw clearly -
what
it required,
certainly,
no great perspi-
cacity to see -
that living beings differ from one another
in
many kinds of ways -
in habitat,
in external form, in ana-
tomical structure,
in the presence or absence or degree of de-
velopment of particular
organs and functions, in sensibility and
intelligence;
he apparently
saw also that there is no regular
correlation
between these modes of diversity, that a creature
which may be considered'
superior'
to another
in respect to
one type of character
may be inferior to it in respect to' an-
other.
He therefore made,
it would appear,
no attempt
to
frame any single exclusive scheme of classification
even of
animals.
Nevertheless, any division of creatures with reference
to some one determinate
attribute
manifestly gave rise to a
linear series of classes. And such a series, Aristotle observed,
tends to show a shading-off of the properties of one class into
those of the next rather than a sharp-cut
distinction
between
them.
Nature refuses to conform to our craving for clear lines
of demarcation;
she loves twilight zones, where forms abide
which, if they are to be classified at all, must be assigned to two
classes at once.
And this insensibly minute gradation
of dif-
ferentness
is especially evident
at precisely
those points at
which common speech implies the presence of profound
and
well-defined contrasts.
Nature,
for example,
passes so gradually from the inanimate
to the animate that their continuity
renders the boundary between them indistinguishable;
and there is a middle
kind that belongs to both orders.
For plants come immediately
after inani-
mate things;
and plants differ from one another in the degree in which they
appear to participate
in life. For the class taken as a whole seems, in com-
parison with other bodies, to be clearly animate;
but compared with ani-
mals to be inanimate.
And the transition from plants to animals is con-
tinuous;
for one might question whether some marine forms are animals
or plants, since many of them are attached
to the rock and perish if they
are separated from it. 41

GENESIS OF THE
IDEA
57
The existence of ' zoophytes'
continued
for centuries to be the
favorite,
endlessly repeated,
illustration
of the truth
of the
principle of continuity
in biology.
But Aristotle found numer-
ous further examples of such continuity,
in classifications based
upon other criteria.
You may, for example,
distinguish
ani-
mals by their habitat
-
which to the Middle Ages was to seem
a highly significant distinction -
into those of the land, the air,
and the waters; but you cannot bring all real kinds within the
limits of one or another of these divisions.
"Seals are in some
sense land and water animals
in one"
and bats are "inter-
mediate between animals that live on the ground and animals
that
fly, and
may
therefore
be said to belong
to both
or
neither."
Of the mammals, again, it cannot be said that all are
either quadrupeds
or bipeds, the latter class solely represented
by man;
for "participating
in the nature of both man and
quadrupeds
is the ape," belonging to neither class or to both.
42
It will be seen that there was an essential opposition between
two aspects of Aristotle's influence upon subsequent
thought,
and especially upon the logical method not merely of science
but of everyday reasoning.
There are not many differences in
mental habit more significant than that between the habit of
thinking
in discrete,
well-defined
class-concepts
and that of
thinking in terms of continuity,
of infinitely delicate shadings-
off of everything
into something
else, of the overlapping
of
essences, so that the whole notion of species comes to seem an
artifice of thought not truly applicable to the fluency, the, so to
say, universal overlappingness
of the real world.
Now just as
the Platonic writings were the principal sources both of other-
worldliness and of its opposite in Western philosophy,
so the
influence of Aristotle encouraged
two diametrically
opposed
sorts of conscious or unconscious logic. He is oftenest regarded,
I suppose, as the great representative
of a logic which rests
upon the assumption
of the possibility of clear divisions and
rigorous classification.
Speaking of what he terms Aristotle's
"doctrine
of fixed genera and indivisible species," Mr. W. D.
Ross has .remarked
that this was a conclusion to which he was
led mainly by his" close absorption
in observed facts."
Not
only in biological species but in geometrical
forms -
"in the
division of triangles, for example,
into equiangular,
isosceles,

58
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
and scalene -
he had evidence of rigid classifications in the
nature of things."
43 But this is only half the story about Aris-
totle; and it is questionable
wh.ether it is the more important
half. For it is equally true that he first suggested the limitations
and dangers of classification,
and the non-conformity
of na-
ture to those sharp divisions which are so indispensable
for
language
and so convenient
for our ordinary
mental
opera-
tions. And the very terms and illustrations used by a hundred
later writers down to Locke and Leibniz,
and beyond, show
that they are but repeating Aristotle's expressions of this idea.
From the Platonic
principle
of plenitude
the principle
of
continuity could be directly deduced.
If there is between two
given natural species a theoretically possible intermediate
type,
that type must be realized -
and so on ad indefinitum; other-
wise, there would be gaps in the universe, the creation would
not be as "full"
as it might be, and this would imply the inad-
missible
consequence
that
its Source
or Author
was not
"good,"
in the sense which that adjective has in the Timaeus.
There are in the Platonic dialogues occasional intimations
that the Ideas, and therefore their sensible counterparts,
are
not all of equal metaphysical
rank or excellence; but this con-
ception not only of existences but of essences as hierarchically
ordered remains in Plato only a vague tendency,
not a defi-
nitely formulated
doctrine.
In spite of Aristotle's recognition
of the multiplicity
of possible systems of natural
classification,
it was he who chiefly suggested to naturalists
and philosophers
of later times the idea of arranging
(at least) all animals in a
single graded scala naturae according
to their degree of "per-
fection."
For the criterion of rank in this scale he sometimes
took the degree of development
reached
by the offspring at
birth; there resulted, he conceived, eleven general grades, with
man at the top and the zoophytes at the bottom."
In the
De Anima another hierarchical
arrangement
of all organisms is
suggested, which was destined to a greater influence upon sub-
sequent philosophy
and natural
history.
It is based on the
"powers
of soul"
possessed by them, from the nutritive,
to
which plants
are limited,
to the rational,
characteristic
of
man"
and possibly another kind superior to his," each higher

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
59
order possessing all the powers of those below it in the scale,
and an additional
differentiating
one of its own."
Either
scheme, as carried out by Aristotle himself, provided a series
composed of only a small number of large classes, the sub-
species of which were not necessarily capable
of a similar
ranking.
But there were in the Aristotelian metaphysics and
cosmology certain far less concrete conceptions which could
be so applied as to permit an arrangement
of all things in a
single order of excellence.
Everything, except God, has in it
some measure of" privation."
There are, in the first place, in
its generic"
nature"
or essence, "potentialities"
which, in a
given state of its existence, are not realized; and there are su-
perior levels of being, which, by virtue of the specific degree of
privation characteristic of it, it is constitutionally
incapable of
attaining.
Thus" all individual things may be graded accord-
ing to the degree to which they are infected with
[mere]
potentiality."
46 This vague notion of an ontological scale was
to be combined with the more intelligible conceptions of zoo-
logical and
psychological
hierarchies
which
Aristotle
had
suggested; and in this way what I shall call the principle of
unilinear gradation was added to the assumptions of the full-
ness and the qualitative
continuity
of the series of forms of
natural existence.
The result was the conception of the plan and structure of the
world which, through the Middle Ages and down to the late
eighteenth century, many philosophers, most men of science,
and, indeed, most educated men, were to accept without ques-
tion -
the conception of the universe as a "Great
Chain of
Being," composed of an immense, or -
by the strict but sel-
dom rigorously applied logic of the principle of continuity -
of an infinite, number of links ranging in hierarchical
order
from the meagerest kind of existents, which barely escape non-
existence, through "every possible" grade up to the ensper-
fectissimum -
Of, in a somewhat more orthodox version, to the
highest possible kind of creature,
between
which and the
Absolute Being the disparity was assumed to be infinite-
everyone
of them differing from that immediately above and
that immediately
below it by the "least possible" degree of
difference.
Again by way of anticipation, let me quote, out of

60
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
many, two or three modern poetic phrasings of these concep-
tions.
In the seventeenth century the principles both of pleni-
tude and continuity
find expression in the characteristically
bold, and mixed, metaphors
of George Herbert:
The creatures leap not, but expresse a feast
Where all thy guests sit close, and nothing wants.
Frogs marry fish and flesh; bats, bird and beast;
Sponges, non-sense and sense; mines, th' earth and plants."
Pope in the next century
in a passage which, I trust, every
schoolboy knows, enunciates the chief premise of his -
which
is to say, the usual -
argument for optimism, by summing up
the principles of plenitude
and continuity
in two neat coup-
lets:
Of systems possible if 'tis confest
That wisdom infinite must form the best,
then
...
all must full or not coherent be,
And all that rises, rise in due degree.
From the resultant picture of the whole of things Pope deduces
a moral -
much cherished by the eighteenth-century
mind -
to which we shall have occasion to .return.
Vast chain of being! which from God began,
Natures aethereal, human, angel, man,
Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,
No glass can reach;
from Infinite to thee,
From thee to nothing. -
On superior pow'rs
Were we to press, inferior might on ours;
Or in the full creation leave a void,
Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd;
From Nature's chain whatever link you strike,
Ten th, or ten thousand th, breaks the chain alike.
The consequence of any such elimination- of even one link in
the series, Pope goes on to observe, would be a general disso-
lution of the cosmical order;
ceasing to be "full,"
the world
would cease to be in any sense" coherent."
I recall here pas-
sages so well known chiefly to remind you that the Essay on
Man is also, in part,
one of the footnotes to Plato.
James
Thomson
in
The Seasons was less expansive
on the theme:

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
61
"Has
any seen," he inquires -
somewhat redundantly,
since
every instructed
person in that age was supposed
to be ac-
quainted
with it -
Has any seen
The mighty chain of being, lessening down
From Infinite Perfection to the brink
Of dreary nothing, desolate abyss!
From which astonished thought, recoiling, turns?
But the Chain of Being was not, of course, to become merely
the occasion for poetic rhapsodies such as these.
Not only in
technical metaphysics but in the sciences, it -
or the group of
principles
from which
it was forged -
was to have conse-
quences
of great
historical
moment.
Thus,
for example,
a
special
student
of the
history
of classificatory
science
has
pointed out the decisive role of the principles of gradation
and
continuity
in the biology of the Renaissance:
By these assertions [of Aristotle] there was established, from the very be-
ginning of natural
history, a principle which was long to remain authori-
tative:
that according to which living beings are linked to one another by
regularly
graduated
affinities. . ..
Thus from Aristotelian
science two
ideas -
very differently elaborated and, in truth, rather loosely connected
with one another -
were received as a legacy by natural
history in the
Renaissance.
The one was the idea of a hierarchy of beings; a philosophi-
cal dogma which Christian theology, following Neo-Platonism,
had often
made the theme of an essentially speculative interpretation
of the universe.
. ..
The other was the postulate that between natural
things the transi-
tions are insensible and quasi-continuous.
The latter, though it may ap-
pear to be of less metaphysical significance, had, for the use of naturalists,
the great advantage
of permitting
an at least apparently
easy verification
through the examination of actual sensible objects. This, moreover, did not
make it impossible at the same time to draw from the Scholastic teaching an
axiom which seemed to confer upon this principle a rational necessity: oic.,
that in the orderly arrangement
of the world there can be no 'gap' or no
'dispersion'between
the 'forms.'
48
Though
the ingredients
of this complex of ideas came from
Plato and Aristotle, it is in Neoplatonism
that they first appear
as fully organized
into a coherent
general scheme of things.
The
dialectic
of the theory
of emanation
is essentially
an
elaboration
and extension of the passages in the Timaeuswhich
have been cited; it is, in short, an attempt at a deduction of the

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
necessary validity of the principle of plenitude, with which the
principles of continuity and gradation
are definitely fused.
In
Plotinus still more clearly than in Plato, it is from the proper-
ties of a rigorously otherworldly,
and a completely self-suffi-
cient, Absolute, that the necessity of the existence of this world,
with all its manifold ness and its imperfection,
is deduced.
The One is perfect because it seeks for nothing, and possesses nothing,
and has need of nothing; and being perfect, it overflows, and thus its super-
abundance
produces
an Other.P
. . .
Whenever
anything
reaches
its
own perfection, we see that it cannot endure to remain in itself, but gener-
ates and produces some other thing.
Not only beings having the power of
choice, but also those which are by nature incapable
of choice, and even
inanimate
things, send forth as much of themselves as they can:
thus fire
emits heat and snow cold and drugs act upon other things. . . .
How then
should the Most Perfect Being and the First Good remain shut up in itself,
as though it were jealous or impotent -
itself the potency of all things?
. ..
Something must therefore be begotten of it. 50
And this generation of the Many from the One cannot come to
an end so long as any possible variety of being in the descend-
ing series is left unrealized.
Each hypostasis will"
produce
something lower than itself";
to the "ineffable"
potency of
generation"
we cannot impute any halt, any limit of jealous
grudging;
it must move forever outward,
until the ultimate
confines of the possible are reached.
All things have come to be
by reason of the infinity of that power which gives forth from
itself to all things and cannot suffer any of them to be disin-
herited.
For there was nothing which prevented
anyone
of
them from participating
in the nature
of the Good, in the
measure in which each was capable of doing so."
61
The first stages of this descending process belong to the In-
telligible World, and have nothing
to do with time or sense;
but the third of the eternal hypostases, the Universal Soul, is
the immediate
parent
of nature;
for it, too, is incapable
of
"remaining
in itself," but, "first looking back upon that from
which it proceeded,
it is thereby filled full" -
i. e., is, so to
say, impregnated
with all the Ideas, which make up the sub-
stance of the next preceding
hypostasis, or Reason -
" and
then going forward in the opposite direction,
it generates an
image of itself," namely, "the sentient and the vegetative na-

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
63
tures"
(i. e., animals and plants).
Thus"
the world is a sort of
Life stretched
out to an immense span, in which each of the
parts has its own place in the series, all of them different and
yet the whole
continuous,
and
that
which
precedes
never
wholly absorbed
in that which comes after."
52
The Scale of Being, then, as implied by the principle of the
expansiveness and self-transcendence
of" the Good,"
becomes
the essential conception of the Neoplatonic
cosmology.
When,
for example,
Macrobius,
in the early fifth century,
gives, un-
der the guise of a commentary
on a work of Cicero's, a Latin
abridgment
of much of the doctrine of Plotinus, he sums up the
conception in a concise passage which was probably one of the
chief vehicles through
which it was transmitted
to medieval
writers; and he employs two metaphors
-
of the chain and of
the series of mirrors -
which were to recur for centuries
as
figurative expressions of this conception.
Since, from the Supreme God Mind arises, and from Mind, Soul, and
since this in turn creates all subsequent things and. fills them all with life,
and since this single radiance
illumines all and is reflected in each, as a
single face might be reflected in many mirrors placed in a series; and since
all things follow in continuous succession, degenerating
in sequence to the
very bottom of the series, the attentive observer will discover a connection
of parts, from the Supreme God down to the last dregs of things, mutually
linked together and without a break.
And this is Homer's golden chain,
which God, he says, bade hang down from heaven to earth.
53
The generation
of the lower grades of being, or of all of them
that are'
possible,' directly
by the Soul of Nature,
and ulti-
mately by the Absolute,
is, it will be seen, regarded
by the
Neoplatonist
as a logical
necessity.
Plotinus,
no doubt,
is
reluctant
to apply the term'
necessity,' or, indeed, any other
definite term, to the One; of the highest object of thought that
predicate
must be both affirmed and denied, as must its oppo-
site, freedom or contingency.
But, in spite of this characteristic
quibbling,
the whole tendency
of the Neoplatonic
dialectic is
adverse
to that
conception
of arbitrary
volition
and
capri-
ciously limited selection from among the possibilities of being,
which was to play a great
part
in the history of Christian
theology.
Neither
the Absolute nor the Cosmic Soul would,
for our thought,
be what, upon the Neoplatonist's
most funda-

THE GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
mental principles, we must regard them as being, namely, in
their respective degrees"
good," unless they were also genera-
tive, to a degree limited only by the logical character
of the
system of Ideas eternally contemplated
by the second hypos-
tasis, the Universal
Reason.
"Is it," Plotinus asks, "by the
mere will of the being who meted out to all their several lots
that
inequalities
exist among
them?"
"By no means,"
he
answers; "it was necessary according to the nature
of things
that it should be so." 54
In this assumption
of the metaphysical
necessity and the
essential worth of the realization
of all the conceivable forms
of being, from highest to lowest, there was obviously implicit
the basis of a theodicy; and in the writings of Plotinus and Pro-
elus we find already
fully expressed the catchwords
and the
reasonings to which King and Leibniz and Pope and a host of
lesser writers were to give fresh currency in the eighteenth cen-
tury.
The optimistic formula itself, in which Voltaire was to
find the theme of his -irony in Candide,was Plotinian;
and the
reason which Plotinus gives for holding this to be the best pos-
sible world is that it is "full"
-
"the whole earth is full of a
diversity of living things, mortal
and immortal,
and replete
with them up to the very heavens."
Those who suppose that
the world might have been better fashioned do so because they
fail to see that the best world must contain all possible evil -
that
is, all conceivable
finite degrees of privation
of good,
which Plotinus assumes to be the only meaning
that can be
attached
to the term"
evil."
He who finds fault with the nature of the universe does not know what he
does, nor whither his arrogance is leading him.
The reason is that men
know not the successive grades of being, first, second, third and so on con-
tinually until the last is reached.
. . .
We ought not to-demand
that all
shall be good, nor hastily complain because this is not possible. 56
Difference of kind is treated as necessarily equivalent
to dif-
ference of excellence, to diversity of rank in a hierarchy.
How, if there is to be a multiplicity of forms, can one thing be worse unless
another is better, or one be better unless another is worse? . . .
Those who
would eliminate the worse from the universe would eliminate Providence
itself....
56
It is the [cosmic] Reason that in accordance with rationality produces

GENESIS OF THE IDEA
the things that are called evils, since it did not wish all things to be [equally]
good. . . .
Thus the Reason did not make gods only, but first gods, then
spirits, the second nature, and then men, and then animals, in a continuous
series -
not through envy, but because its rational nature contains an in-
tellectual variety.
But we are like men who, knowing little of painting,
blame the artist because the colors in his picture are not all beautiful -
not
seeing that he has given to each part what was appropriate
to it. And the
cities which have the best governments are not those in which all citizens
are equal.
Or we are like one who should complain of a tragedy because it
includes among its characters, not heroes only, but also slaves and peasants
who speak incorrectly.
But to eliminate these low characters would be to
spoil the beauty of the whole;
and it is by means of them that it becomes
complete [lit. "full "].57
A rational world, then -
and the kind of world implied by
the nature of the Absolute -
must exhibit all degrees of the
imperfection which arises from the specification of differences
among creatures through distinctive limitations.
It is there-
fore absurd for man to claim more qualities than he has re-
ceived; it is as if he should demand
that since some animals
have horns, all should have them."
Man simply happens to be
the creature
that occupies a particular
place in the scale, a
place which could not conceivably be left vacant.
The same principles chiefly serve Plotinus when he deals
with the problem
of the suffering of the non-rational
(and
therefore sinless) animals.
He is well aware that there rages
"amongst
animals and amongst men a perpetual war, without
respite and without truce,"
69 but he is serenely sure that this is
" necessary" for the good of the Whole, since the good of the
Whole consists chiefly in the" variety of its parts."
"It is bet-
ter that one animal should be eaten by another than that it
should never have existed at all";
the tacit assumption here
that it could have life only upon those terms obviously can re-
late, not to a necessity pertinent to animals in general, but only
to the specific class of logically possible animals whose "na-
ture"
it is to be eaten.
They are needed to make up the set.
The existence of the carnivora
and of their victims is indis-
pensable to the abundance of that cosmic Life whose nature it
is to "produce
all things and to diversify all in the manner of
their existence."
Conflict in general, adds Plotinus, is only a
special case and a necessary implicate of diversity; "difference

66
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
carried to its maximum
is opposition."
And since to contain
and to engender difference, "to produce otherness," is the very
essence of the creative World-Soul,
"it will necessarily do this
in the maximal degree, and therefore produce things opposed
to one another, and not merely things different to a degree fall-
ing short of opposition.
Only so will its perfection
be rea-
lized."
60
Yet Plotinus is unwilling to say that the number of temporal
beings, or the number
which corresponds
to them in the In-
telligible World,
is literally
infinite.
Like most Greek phi-
losophers, he feels an aesthetic
aversion to the notion of in-
finity, which he is unable
to distinguish
from the indefinite.
To say of the sum of things that it is infinite is equivalent
to
saying that it has no clear-cut
arithmetical
character
at all.
Nothing that is perfect, or fully in possession of its own poten-
tial being, can lack determinate
limits.
The conception of in-
finite number
is, moreover,
self-contradictory;
it is, Plotinus
says, repeating
an already
trite argument,
"contrary
to the
very nature of number."
On the other hand, he cannot admit
that the Ideal Number,
the archetype of the numerical
aspect
of the sensible world, is any assignable finite number.
For we
can always conceive of a number greater than any such num-
ber, but"
in the Intelligible World it is impossible to conceive
of a number
greater
than
that which is conceived"
by the
divine
Intellect,
for that
number
is already
complete;
"no
number
is wanting or can ever be wanting
to it, whereby it
might be increased."
61 Thus Plotinus's position is essentially
equivocal;
the number of beings is at once finite and greater
than any finite number
can be.
It is to precisely the same
evasion that we shall see many others resorting.
But, finite or
not, the world at all events is for Plotinus in his usual, though
not quite invariant,
teaching so "full"
that no possible kind
of being is wanting in it.

III
THE CHAIN OF BEING AND SOME INTERNAL
CONFLICTS
IN MEDIEVAL
THOUGHT
FROM Neoplatonism
the principle of plenitude,
with the group
of ideas presupposed
by it or derivative
from it, passed over
into that complex of preconceptions
which shaped the theology
and the cosmology of medieval Christendom.
Two men more
than
any others determined
the formula
for this new com-
pound
of old
ingredients
-
Augustine
and
the
unknown
fifth-century
author of that strange collection of misattributed
writings
or pious
forgeries
which
passed
for the
work
of
Dionysius, the Athenian
disciple of St. Paul.
In the theology
of both the influence of the principle is manifest.
Thus Augus-
tine, finding in it his answer to the old question, "Why,
when
God made all things, he did not make them all equal,"
reduces
the Plotinian
argument
on the matter
to an epigram
of six
words: non essentomnia, si essentaequalia: "if all things were
equal, all things would not be; for the multiplicity
of kinds of
things of which the universe is constituted
-
first and second
and so on, down to the creatures of the lowest grades -
would
not exist."
The assumption implicit here, once more, is mani-
festly that literally all -
that is, all possible -
things oughtto
be.
Still more conspicuous
is!the principle
in the writings of
the Pseudo-Dionysius.
It constitutes the essence of his concep-
tion of the divine attribute
of "love"
or "goodness,"
anthro-
pomorphic
terms which usually mean with him, as they appear
frequently
to mean in medieval theology, not compassion, nor
the alleviation
of human suffering, but the immeasurable
and
inexhaustible
productive
energy, the fecundity of an Absolute
not conceived
as truly possessing emotions
similar to man's.
God's
"love,"
in other
words,
in medieval
writers
consists
primarily
rather
in the creative or generative
than in the re-
demptive or providential
office of deity: it is the attribute
that
(in a wholly Neoplatonic
phrase which Thomas Aquinas bor-

68
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
rowed from the Areopagite)
nonpermisit manereDeum in seipso
sine germine,id est sineproductionecreaturarum.: It was a love of
which the original
beneficiaries,
so to say, were not actual
sentient creatures
or already existing moral agents, but Pla-
tonic Ideas, conceived figuratively as aspirants for the grace of
actual existence.
Love which works good to all things, pre-existing overflowingly in the
Good, . . . moved itself to creation,
as befits the superabundance
by
which all things are generated.
. . .
The Good by being extends its good-
ness to all things.
For as our sun, not by choosing or taking thought but by
merely being, enlightens all things, so the Good ...
by its mere existence
sends forth upon all things the beams of its goodness.s
Here the phraseology of the primitive Christian conception of
a loving Father in Heaven has been converted into an expres-
sion of the dialectic of emanationism;
and it is to be noted that
the inner necessity of generating finite beings thus attributed
to
the Absolute is represented
as also necessarily commensurate
with the Absolute's own infinite"
superabundance,"
and by
implication,
therefore,
as inevitably
extending
to all possible
things.
Dante, long after, echoes these passages of the Areopagite, as
well as that of Macrobius,
and repeats, as most of the theologi-
ans had done, Plato's phrase in the Timaeus: the good cannot
be subject to "envy,"
and therefore must be self-communica-
tive:
La divina bonta, che da se sperne
Ogni livore, ardendo in se sfavilla,
81 che dispiega Ie bellezze eterne.s
It is in his explanation
of the existence of the angelic hier-
archies that Dante chiefly elaborates
the implications
of this
conception
of the necessarily self-diffusive energy of I'Eterno
Valor. Even of this one order ofbeings
the number created is
infinite, or, at all events, greater than any number of which a
finite intellect can conceive.
This nature doth so multiply itself
In numbers, that there never yet was speech
Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.
And if thou notest that which is revealed
By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands

THOUGHT
69
Number determinate
is kept concealed.
. . ..
The height behold now and the amplitude
Of the eternal power, since it hath made
Itself so many mirrors, where 'tis broken,
One in itself remaining as before..4
But, as is elsewhere expressly said, this necessity of production
inherent in the divine goodness is not limited to the creation of
an infinity of spiritual
beings.
It extends to things mortal
as
well as immortal;
the emanation
of existence from its fount
descends by degrees through
all the levels of potentiality.
That which can die and that which dieth not
Are nothing but the splendor of that Idea
Which by His love our Lord brings into being .
. . . . . . . . . . . That living Light
Through its own goodness reunites its rays
In new subsistences as in a mirror,
Itself eternally remaining One.
Thence it descends to the last potencies,
Downward from act to act becoming such
That only brief contingencies it makes. 5
This is a fairly unequivocal
expression of the principle of pleni-
tude;
for if even the ultimepotence could not be refused the
privilege of existence, still less could any potentialities
higher
in the scale.
And, for the sort of philosophy which Dante fol-
lowed and is here assuming, the whole series of possibles was
logically antecedent
to the creation;
it was an eternally
fixed
program for a "full"
universe, which God's"
goodness" made
certain of realization.
Yet in these passages, though they were but poetic versions
of what the Areopagite
and many
another
respected,
if less
authoritative,
philosopher
had seemed to say, Dante
verged
upon a heresy; indeed, it was impossible for a medieval writer
to make any use of the principle of plenitude
without verging
upon
heresies.
For that
conception,
when
taken
over into
Christianity,
had to be accommodated
to very different prin-
ciples, drawn
from other
sources, which
forbade
its literal
interpretation;
to carry it through
to what seemed to be its
necessary implications
was to be sure of falling into one theo-
logical pitfall or another.
This conflict of ideas did not, indeed,

jO
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
arise for those extreme
anti-rationalists,
represented
in the
later Middle
Ages by the Scotists, William
of Ockham,
and
others, who held the arbitrary
and inscrutable
will of the deity
to be the sole ground
of all distinctions
of value.

sumed that a thing was made good merely by God's willing it,
and evil, or not good, by his not willing it, you were debarred
from reasoning at all about the implications
of the attribute
of
"goodness."
The world contained
whatever it had pleased its
Maker to put into it; but what sort of creatures,
or how many
of them, this might mean, no man had any means of judging,
except by experience
or revelation.
But upon those who felt
the need of meaning something when they called God" good,"
and those who, inheriting
the Platonic tradition,
had an aver-
sion from the creed of the ultimate
irrationality
of things, the
principle of plenitude inevitably forced itself -
only, however,
to encounter
opposing assumptions
or needs even more potent
than itself.
Since the divine
"goodness"
admittedly
meant
creativeness,
the conferring of the gift of actuality
upon things
possible, it seemed at once irrational
and irreligious to say that
the ensperfectissimumis not thus "good"
by its essence.
Yet to
admit this was seemingly to fall into the extreme
opposite to
that of the Scotists, and regard all reality as a necessary deduc-
tive consequence
of the necessary nature
of the primal
Idea.
Hence it followed that God's freedom of choice must be main-
tained by denying what Dante came so perilously near to as-
serting, viz., that the actual
exercise of the creative
potency
extends of necessity through
the entire range of possibility.
From Augustine
on, the internal
strain resulting
from the
opposition
of these two dialectical
motives is clearly apparent
in medieval
philosophy.
In the twelfth century
the issue be-
came overt and acute through
the attempt
made by Abelard
to carry out consistently the consequences
of the principles of
sufficient reason and of plenitude,
as these were implicit in the
accepted meaning
of the doctrine of the"
goodness"
of deity.
Abelard
saw clearly that these premises led to a necessitarian
optimism.
The world, if it is the temporal
manifestation
of a
" good" and rational World-Ground,
must be the best possible
world ; this means that
in it all genuine
possibility must be
actualized ; and thus none of its characteristics
or components

THOUGHT
7I
can be contingent,
but all things must have been precisely
what they are.
That
this consequence
may appear
shocking
Abelard recognizes, and he at first professes to hesitate to adopt
it; but in the end he leaves his reader
in no doubt
as to his
position.
We must inquire whether it was possible for God to make more things
or better things than he has in fact made.
. . .
Whether we grant this or
deny it, we shall fall into many difficulties because of the apparent
unsuit-
ability of the conclusions to which either alternative
leads us. For if we as-
sume that he could make either more or fewer things than he has, ...
we shall say what is exceedingly derogatory to his supreme goodness.
Good-
ness, it is evident, can produce only what is good; but if there are things
good which God fails to produce when he might have done so, or if he re-
frains from producing some things fit to be produced
(facienda), who would
not infer that he isjealous or unjust -
especially since it costs him no labor
to make anything?
. . .
Hence
is that
most true argument
of Plato's,
whereby he proves that God could not in any wise have made a better
world than he has made.
[Quotes
Timaeus goc] . . . God neither
does
nor omits to do anything
except for some rational
and supremely
good
reason, even though it be hidden from us; as that other sentence of Plato's
says, Whateveris generatedis generatedby somenecessarycause,for nothingcomes
into beingexcepttherebe somedue causeand reasonantecedentto it. Hence also is
that of Augustine's,
where he shows that all things in the world are pro-
duced or disposed by divine providence,
and nothing by chance, nothing
fortuitously.
[Quotes QuaestionesLXXXIII,
26] To such a degree is God
in all that he does mindful of the good, that he is said to be induced to make
individual
things rather by the value of the good there is in them than by
the choice (libitum) of his own will, . . .
This is in accord with what
Jerome says, For Goddoesnot do this becausehe wills to do so, but heunlls to do so
becauseit is good.
It is not to God, then, that the attitude
hocvolo,sicjubeo, sit pro
rationevoluntasis to be attributed,
says Abelard, but only to men
who are given over to the capricious desires of their own hearts.
From all this -
and much more which I omit -
it is certain,
Abelard concludes, that it is intrinsically
impossible for God to
do (or make) or to leave undone
(or unmade)
anything
other
than the things that he actually does at some time do or omit
to do; or to do anything
in any other manner
or at any other
time than that in which it actually is done: eo solummodoDeum
possefacere vel dimittere, quaequandoquefacit vel dimittit, et eomodo
tantum vel eo temporequofacit, non alio.6
Thus Abelard
had, some five centuries
earlier, drawn from

72
THE
GREAT CHAIN
OF BEING
Plato's
premise
the most characteristic
of Spinoza's
conclu-
sions; had, in other words, drawn
from that premise its true
consequence.
7
His doctrinal
affinity
with
the seventeenth-
century Jewish philosopher
may be still further
seen from the
character
of his reply to an objection which, he says, had been
"very
recently made,"
namely,
that no thanks would be due to God for what he has done, since he could not
avoid doing it and acts rather by necessity than by will.
This objection is
wholly frivolous.
For here a certain necessity arising out of his nature,
or
his goodness, is not separate from his will, nor can we speak of a constraint,
as if he were forced to do something against his will. . . .
Since his good-
ness is so great, his will so perfect, that he does what ought to be done, not
unwillingly,
but spontaneously,
he is so much the more completely
to be
loved because of his very nature, and the more to be glorified because this
goodness of his belongs to him not by accident but substantially
and im-
mutably.
From all this follows the usual argument
for optimism
of the
sort which was to become so universally
familiar in the seven-
teenth
and eighteenth
centuries:
the goodness of this best of
possible worlds consists, not in the absence of evils, but rather
in their
presence -
consists, that
is, in the actualization
of
what Abelard calls the rationabilisvarietaswhich requires them.
In favor of this view he could, as we already
know, cite very
high authority.
It is not to be doubted that all things, both good and bad, proceed from
a most perfectly ordered plan, that they occur and are fitted to one another
in such a way that they could not possibly occur more fittingly.
Thus Augus-
tine: since God is good, evils would not be, unless it were a good that there
should be evils. For by the same reason for which he wills that good things
shall exist, namely, because their existence is befitting (conveniens),he also
wills that evil things should exist, . . . all of which as a whole tends to
his greater glory.
For as a picture is often more beautiful and worthy of
commendation
if some colors in themselves ugly are included in it, than it
would be if it were uniform and of a single color, so from an admixture
of
evils the universe is rendered more beautiful and worthy of commendation.
8
But though
the premises of the argument
could scarcely be
denied by the most orthodox
theologian,
the conclusion could
as little be admitted;
Abelard
had indiscreetly
made manifest
both
the deterministic
and
the
antinomian
implications
of
principles which nearly everyone accepted.
It was one of the

CONFLICTS
IN MEDIEVAL
THOUGHT
73
heresies charged against Abelard by Bernard of Clairvaux
that
he taught"
that God ought not to prevent
evils..since by his
beneficence
everything
that happens
does so in the best pos-
sible manner."
9 And Peter Lombard,
in the LiberSententiarum,
the famous compend
which was for centuries
to be the chief
textbook of students of theology, condemned
Abelard's
reason-
ing on these points, and offered a curious refutation
of it. To
maintain
that the universe is so good that it could not be bet-
ter is "to make the creature
equal to the Creator,"
of whom
alone perfection may legitimately
be asserted; if, however, it is
admitted
that the world is imperfect,
it follows that there are
possibilities of being and of good that are unrealized,
and that
"God could have made other things and better things than he
has made."
10
Henceforward
it was recognized
to be inad-
missible to accept a literal optimism, or the principle of pleni-
tude, or the principle of sufficient reason which was the basis of
both.
Yet, though
the dominant
philosophy
of the Middle
Ages
could not do with these principles,
it could not do without
them;
and the conflict between
its characteristic
presupposi-
tions, which had in the time of Abelard taken the form of open
controversy, continued
to manifest itself in the form of an inner
opposition
of tendencies
in the minds of individual
thinkers.
Nothing could better illustrate this than a review of some of the
deliverances on these matters of the greatest of the Schoolmen;
through.it
we shall see both the embarrassment
which this in-
ternal strain in the traditional
doctrine
caused him, and the
ingenious but futile logical shifts to which it compelled him to
resort.
Thomas Aquinas seems first of all to affirm the principle
of
plenitude
quite unequivocally
and unqualifiedly.
Everyone desires the perfection of that which for its own sake he wills
and loves: for the things we love for their own sakes, we wish . . . to be
multiplied as much as possible. But God wills and loves His essence for its
own sake.
Now that essence is not augmentable
or multipliable
in itself
but can be multiplied only in its likeness, which is shared by many.
God
therefore wills things to be multiplied,
inasmuch as he wills and loves his
own perfection.
. ..
Moreover, God in willing himself wills all the things
which are in himself; but all things in a certain manner pre-exist in God by
their types (rationes). God, therefore, in willing himself wills other things.

74
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Again, the will follows the understanding.
But God in primarily un-
derstanding
himself, understands
all other things; therefore, once more,
in willing himself primarily, he wills all other things."
Now this, as a recent Roman
Catholic
commentator
on the
Summa contraGentilesobserves, "taken
by itself might seem to
argue that God wills the existence of all things that He under-
stands as possible, and that He necessarily wills the existence
of things outside himself, and so necessarily creates them."
12
Not only might the passage mean this; it can, in consistency
with
assumptions
which
Aquinas
elsewhere
accepts,
mean
nothing else. All possibles" fall under an infinite understand-
ing," in Spinoza's phrase, and, indeed, belong to its essence;
and therefore nothing less than the sum of all genuine possibles
could be the object of the divine will, ille., of the creative act.
But Thomas
cannot,
of course, admit
this; he is under
the
necessity of affirming the freedom of the absolute will; necesse
est dicereuoluntatemDei essecausamrerum,et Deumagereper volun-
tatem, nonper necessitatemnaturae,ut quidamexistimaoeruntP Con-
sequently the creation
must be restricted
to a selection from
among the Ideas.
In order to exclude necessity without
ex-
cluding
"goodness"
from the divine act of choice, Thomas
first introduces
a distinction -
which is almost certainly the
source of the similar one in Leibniz
and Wolff -
between
absolute and hypothetical
necessity: the will of God, though it
always chooses the good, nevertheless chooses it "as~becoming
to its own goodness, not as necessary to its goodness."
This is a
distinction which will not bear scrutiny;
to choose other than
the greater good would be, upon Thomistic principles, to con-
tradict both the notion of the divine essence and the notion of
volition; and in any case, the argument grants that the greater
good, which here implies the greatest sum of possibles, is in
fact chosen.
Thomas therefore adds a further and highly char-
acteristic piece of reasoning of which the outcome
is simply
the negation
of the
conclusion
which
he
had
previously
expressed.
Since good, understood to be such, is the proper object of the will, the
will may fasten on any object conceived by the intellect ill which the notion
of good is fulfilled. Hence, though the being of anything, as such, is good,
and its not-being is evil; still, the very not-being of a thing may become an

CONFLICTS
IN MEDIEVAL
THOUGHT
75
object to the will, though not of necessity, by reason of some good which is
attached to it; for it is good for a thing to be, even at the cost of the non-
existence of something else.
The only good, then, which the will by its
constitution
cannot wish not to be is the good whose non-existence would
destroy the notion of good altogether.
Such a good is none other than God.
The will, then, by its constitution
can will the non-existence of anything
except God.
But in God there is will according to the fullness of the power
of willing, for in Him all things without exception exist in a perfect manner.
He therefore can will the non-existence of any being except himself, and
consequently does not of necessity will other things than himself.l!
Hence, though
the divine intellect conceives of an infinity of
possible things, the divine will does not choose them all; and
the existence of finite things is therefore
contingent
and the
number
of their kinds is arbitrary.
But the argument
by which the great Schoolman
seeks to
evade the dangerous
consequences
of his other,
and equally
definitely affirmed, premise is plainly at variance with itself as
well as with some of the most fundamental
principles
of his
system.
It asserts that the existence of anything,
in so far as it
is possible, is intrinsically
a good; that the divine will always
chooses the good; and yet that its perfection
permits
(or re-
quires) it to will the non-existence of some possible, and there-
fore good, things.
It is therefore not surprising that in a later
passage Aquinas again reverts to the thesis that the Absolute,
if good or rational,
must generate
variety in a measure pro-
portional
to his power -
which could only mean,
infinitely,
though within the restrictions imposed by the logical impossi-
bility of some things.
Origen had, in connection
with his doc-
trine of the pre-existence of souls, declared that God's goodness
had been shown at the first creation
by making all creatures
alike spiritual
and rational,
and that the existing inequalities
among them were results of their differing use of their freedom
of choice.
This opinion
Aquinas
declares
to be manifestly
false. "The
best thing in creation is the perfection of the uni-
verse, which
consists in the orderly
variety
of things ....
Thus the diversity of creatures does not arise from diversity of
merits, but was primarily
intended
by the prime agent."
The
proof offered for this is the more striking because of the con-
trast
between
its highly scholastic method
and
the revolu-
tionary implications
which were-latent
in it.

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Since every agent intends to induce its own likeness in the effect, so far
as the effect can receive it, an agent will do this the more perfectly, the more
perfect itself is. But God is the most perfect of agents;
therefore it will be-
long to him to induce His likeness in creation most perfectly, so far as befits
created nature.
But creatures cannot attain to any perfect likeness of God
so long as they are confined to one species of creature;
because, since the
cause exceeds the effect, what is in the cause simply, and as one thing, is
found in the effect in a composite and manifold way. . ..
Multiplicity,
therefore, and variety, was needful in the creation, to the end that the per-
fect likeness of God might be found in things according to their measure.
. ..
[Again], if any agent whose power extends to various effects were to
produce only one of those effects, his power would not be so completely re-
duced to actuality
as by making many.
But by the reduction
of active
power to actuality the effect attains to the likeness of the agent.
Therefore
the likeness of God would not be perfect in the universe if there were only
one grade of effect. . ..
[Again] the goodness of the species transcends the
goodness of the individual,
as form transcends' matter;
therefore the multi-
plication of species is a greater addition to the good of the universe than the
multiplication
of individuals of a single species.
The perfection of the uni-
verse therefore requires not only a multitude of individuals, but also diverse
kinds, and therefore diverse grades of things. 15
It must be patent
to the least critical
reader
of this passage
that here, once more, the Angelic Doctor avoids embracing
the
principle
of plenitude
in its unqualified
form only by an in-
consequence,
since he, like every orthodox
theologian,
held
that the divine power extends not simply to "various"
but to
an infinity of effects. The substitution
of" many"
for" all pos-
sible" was a manifest drawing back from the conclusion which
the premises not only perrnitted
but reo...uired.
Here, then, or in passages of the same sort in other writings
of Thomas
Aquinas,
is probably
the proximate
source of the
arguments
later to be employed
by King and by Leibniz
in
their theodicies,
and of a species of theory of value which, as
taken over by eighteenth-century
writers, was to have momen-
tous consequences
-
the thesis of the inherent
and
supreme
value of variety of existence as such, the assumption
that the
more essences, regardless
of their rank in the scale, there are
realized in the universe, the better it is. If the world were not
constituted
of things
good and
things
evil (in the sense of
deficient in good), then, says Thomas,
All possible grades of goodness would not be filled up, nor would any
ereature
be like God in having
pre-eminence
over another.
Thus
the

CONFLICTS
IN MEDIEVAL
THOUGHT
77
supreme beauty (summusdecor)would be lost to the creation, if there were
lacking that order by which things are dissimilar and unequal.
. ..
If
there were a dead level of equality in things, only one kind of created good
would exist, which would be a manifest derogation from the perfection of the
creation.
. ..
It is no part of divine providence wholly to exclude from
things the possibility of their falling short of good; but what can thus fall
short, sometimes will do so; and the lack of good is evil.
Thus
the great
Schoolman
does not hesitate
before the ob-
viously perilous thesis that"
a universe in which there was no
evil would not be so good as the actual universe."
Those rea-
son falsely, he declares, who say that"
since an angel is better
than a stone, therefore
two angels are better
than one angel
and a stone. . ..
Although
an angel, considered
absolutely,
is
better than a stone, nevertheless
two natures
are better than
one only; and therefore a universe containing
angels and other
things is better than one containing
angels only; since the per-
fection of the universe is attained
essentially in proportion
to
the diversity
of natures
in it, whereby
the divers grades
of
goodness are filled, and not in proportion
to the multiplication
of individuals
of a single nature."
16
It is evident from all this that one can hardly say, with the
author
of a recent
admirable
study of the Thomistic
system,
that Thomas
holds the realization
by man of "that
supreme
good which consists in assimilation
to God"
to be "the
sole
reason for being of the universe."
17 It is an equally essential
part of the teaching
of the great Dominican
philosopher
that
+he universe is its own reason for being; that is to say, that the
orderly variety
of things,"
the actualization
of Ideas, is an
end in itself, an end which is not merely instrumental
to man's
salvation,
and is essentially incompatible
with the"
assimila-
tion"
of the creatures
to anything,
in any sense which would
imply a loss of the dissimilarity
of things from one another
or
even from their source.
It is, probably,
also here that we find the principal
medium
of transmission
to various
eighteenth-century
writers
of the
Neoplatonicjustification
of the way of the lion with the ass -
and of the lion's Maker.
Non conservareturvita leonis, nisi occi-
dereturasinus. "It would be inconsistent with the rationality
of
the divine government
not to allow creatures to act according

78
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
to the mode of their several natures.
But by the very fact of
creatures
so acting there follows destruction
and evil in the
world, since things, through their mutual contrariety
and op-
position, are destructive of one another."
This evil of conflict
and of suffering on the part of those incapable
of moral evil
was, then, also one which "it
did not befit providence
alto-
gether to exclude from the things it governs."
All these attempts
to explain evil away as necessary mani-
festly imply optimism;
a supposed proof of the logical inevita-
bility of a given" evil" as an element in the best possible uni-
verse could have no point unless it were assumed that
the
universe actually is and must be the best possible.
Yet here,
once more,
Thomas,
remembering,
no doubt,
the fate of
Abelard,
shifts his ground;
and again we witness the painful
spectacle
of a great
intellect
endeavoring
by spurious
or
irrelevant
distinctions
to evade the consequences
of its own
principles, only to achieve in the end an express self-contradic-
tion.
When he comes to confront directly Abelard's
question
utrum Deus possit meliorafacere ea quaefacit, Thomas first states
honestly and vigorously the arguments
(on the basis of ac-
cepted doctrines or authorities)
for the view he is to reject.
To
answer the question in the affirmative
seemed to be plainly
equivalent to denying that God does whatever he does potentis-
sime et sapientissime-
which it was, of course, not permissible
to deny;
and again we hear one of the endlessly repeated
echoes of the argument
of the Timaeus: "If
God could have
made things better than he did, and would not, he was en-
vious; but envy is wholly foreign to God."
But to these con-
siderations
Thomas
replies by a series of distinctions.
An
individual
thing of a given kind cannot
be better
than the
"essence"
of its-kind; thus the square of a number could not be
greater than it is, for if it were it would not be the square but
some other number.
The irrelevance of this to the real issue is
obvious.
Of greater seeming relevance is the distinction
be-
tween "better"
when used with reference to the manner
of
action of the agent (modusexpartefacientis) and when used with
reference
to the character
of the thing
done
or produced
(modusexpartefacti).
In the former sense it must be maintained
that"
God could not do anything in a better manner than he

CONFLICTS
IN MEDIEVAL THOUGHT
79
has done";
in the latter sense, the opposite must be asserted:
"God
could give to the things made by Him a better modus
essendithan he has, so far as their accidents are concerned."
But the distinction,
though possible for a Scotist, was incon-
gruous with Thomas's
most cherished convictions;
it implied
that the" goodness" of an act, at all events in the case of deity,
was wholly unrelated
to the objective character
of the thing
done or intended.
Finally, the ingenuity
even of this subtle
doctor was insufficient to save him from an argument
of three
sentences of which the third is the formal negation of the first.
It is to be maintained
that, these things being supposed, the universe
cannot be better than it is, because of the supremely befitting order which
God has assigned to things) wherein the good of the universe consists.
If
anyone
of these things were [separately] better, the proportion which con-
stitutes the order of the whole would be vitiated.
. . .
Nevertheless, God
could make other things than he has, or could add others to the things he
has made;
and this other universe would be better .18
With
his guarded
and
wavering
but ·unmistakable
ap-
proaches to the principle of plenitude Thomas Aquinas joins
an entirely
definite assertion of the principle
of continuity.
Albertus
Magnus,
writing De animalibus, had already laid it
down that"
nature
does not make
[animal] kinds separate
without making
something
intermediate
between
them;
for
nature does not pass from extreme to extreme nisipermedium." 19
Thomas
accordingly
dwells upon the "wonderful
linkage of
beings (connexiorerum)" which nature
"reveals
to our view.
The lowest member
of the higher genus is always found to
border
upon
(contingere)the highest
member
of the lower
genus."
The stock example of the zoophytes, borrowed from
Aristotle, is cited; but the principal application which Thomas
gives to the conception
is to the relation of mind and body.
The material, the genuscorporum,at its highest, namely, in man,
passes over into the mental.
Man's constitution
is "aequaliter
complexionatum,has in equal
degree
the characters
of both
classes, since it attains to the lowest member of the class above
bodies, namely, the human soul, which is at the bottom of the
series of intellectual beings -
and is said, therefore, to be the
horizon
and boundary
line of things corporeal
and
incor-
poreal."
20
Thus the pressure of the principle
of continuity

80
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
tended, even in the Middle Ages, to soften, though it did not
overcome, the traditional
sharp dualism of body and spirit.
The emphasis upon that principle
is recurrent
in later theo-
logical writers of the highest reputation
-
for example,
in
Nicolaus Cusanus:
All things, however different, are linked together.
There is in the genera
of things such a connection between the higher and the lower that they meet
in a common point;
such an order obtains among species that the highest
species of one genus coincides with the lowest of the next higher genus, in
order that the universe may be one, perfect, continuous."
The
accepted
'philosophical,'
as distinct
from
the
dog-
matic, argument
for the existence of angels rested upon these
assumptions of the necessary plenitude
and continuity
of the
chain
of beings;
there
are manifestly
possibilities
of finite
existence
above the grade
represented
by man,
and
there
would consequently
be links wanting
in the chain
if such
beings did not actually exist. The reality of the' heavenly hosts
could thus be kno\vn a priori by the natural
reason, even if a
supernatural
revelation did not assure us of it. 22 This -
to an-
ticipate -
continued for many centuries to be the chief reason
offered in justification
of the belief in "spiritual
creatures";
Sir Thomas Browne exclaims in ReligioMedici, "It
is a riddle
to me ...
how so many learned
heads should so far forget
their metaphysics,
and destroy the ladder
and scale of crea-
tures, as to question the existence of spirits."
Even in the mid-
dle of the eighteenth century the poet Young finds in the prin-
ciple of continuity
a proof of the immortality
of the human
soul, as well as of the existence of purely or permanently
in-
corporeal creatures:
Look Nature through, 'tis neat gradation
all.
By what minute degrees her scale extends!
Each middle nature join'd
at each extreme,
To that above it, join'd
to that beneath .
. . . . . . . But how preserv'd
The chain unbroken upwards, to the realms
Of Incorporeal
life? those realms of bliss
Where death hath no dominion?
Grant a make
Half-mortal,
half-immortal;
earthy part,
And part ethereal;
grant the soul of Man
Eternal;
or in Man the series ends.

Wide yawns the gap;
connection is no more;
Check'd Reason halts;
her next step wants support;
Striving to climb, she tumbles from her scheme.P
But in Young's
time the assumption
that there can, in a ra-
tional order, be no missing links was mainly to be turned
in
quite
another
direction,
with very different
results.
Yet so
persistent has been this inference from the principle
of pleni-
tude that we find Victor Hugo still rhetorically
elaborating
it
in the eighteen-fifties:
Comme sur Ie versant d'un mont prodigieux,
Vaste melee aux bruits confus, du fond de l'ombre,
Tu vois monter a toi la creation sombre.
Le rocher est plus loin, l'animal est plus pres.
Comme Ie faite altier et vivant, tu parais!
Mais, dis, crois-tu que l'etre illogique nous trompe?
L'echelle que tu vois, crois-tu qu'elle se rompe?
Crois-tu, toi dont les sens d'en haut sont eclaires,
Que la creation qui, lente et par degres
S'eleve ala lumiere,
.•.
S'arrete sur l'abime al'homme?
Such a supposition,
implying the illogicality of being, is inad-
missible; the scale continues
through
countless stages higher
than man:
Peuple Ie haut, Ie bas, les bords et Ie milieu,
Et dans les profondeurs s'evanouit en Dieu! 24
Returning
to the author of the Summa theologica,his position
with respect to the principles of plenitude
and continuity
may
now be summed up.
He employs both freely as premises, we
have seen, whenever
they serve his purpose;
but he evades
their consequences
by means of subtle but spurious or irrele-
vant distinctions when they seem to be on the point of leading
him into the heresy of admitting
the complete correspondence
of the realms of the possible and the actual,
with the cosmic
determinism
which this implies.
And all orthodox
medieval
philosophy,
except the radically anti-rationalistic
type, was in
the same position.
There
were only two possible consistent
views -
that of Duns Scotus, on the one side, that later repre-
sented by Bruno and by Spinoza, on the other.
The philoso-

phers who rejected the former horn of the dilemma -
who,
as the only alternative
to admitting
that the creation was an
irrational
caprice, asserted the inherent"
goodness"
of deity,
and accepted
the principle
of plenitude
as implied by this --
could escape the other horn only by a judicious inattention
to
the obvious consequences of their own premises.
The sort of reasoning from the principle of plenitude
which
I have been illustrating
from the Christian
Schoolmen was, of
course, no monopoly of theirs; it has its parallels in the writ-
ings
of both
Moslem
and
Jewish
medieval
philosophers.
Averroes writes, for example:
Why did God create more than one sort of vegetative and animal souls?
The reason is that the existence of most of these species rests upon the prin-
ciple of perfection [or completeness].
Some animals and plants can be seen
to exist only for the sake of man, or of one another;
but of others this cannot
be granted,
e. g., of the wild animals which are harmful to men. 2S
There
was, however,
a still more significant,
though
less
frequently explicit, inner conflict in medieval thought,
and in
Neoplatonism
before it, which was likewise due to the associa-
tion of the principle of plenitude with certain other elements in
the accepted group of fundamental
assumptions.
It was a con-
flict between t\VOirreconcilable
conceptions of the good.
The
final good for man,
as almost
all Western
philosophers
for
more than a millennium
agreed,
consisted in some mode of
assimilation
or approximation
to the divine nature,
whether
that
mode
were defined
as imitation
or contemplation
or
absorption.
The doctrine
of the divine attributes
was thus
also, and far more significantly, a theory of the nature of ulti-
mate value, and the conception
of God was at the same time
the definition
of the objective
of human
life; the Absolute
Being, utterly
unlike
any creature
in nature,
was yet the
primum exemplar omnium.
But the God in whom man was thus
to find his own fulfilment was, as has been pointed out, not one
God but two.
He was the Idea of the Good, but he was also
the Idea of Goodness;
and though
the second attribute
was
nominally deduced dialectically
from the first, no two notions
could be more antithetic.
The one was an apotheosis of unity,
self-sufficiency, and quietude,
the other of diversity, self-tran-

scendence, and fecundity.
The one was, in the words of Peter
Ramus, a Deus omnislaboris,actionis,confectionisnonmodofugiens
sedfastidiens et despiciens;the other was the God of the Timaeus
and of the theory of emanation.
The one God was the goal of
the 'way up,' of that ascending process by which the finite
soul, turning from all created
things, took its way back to the
immutable
Perfection in which alone it could find rest.
The
other God was the source and the informing
energy of that
descending process by which being flows through all the levels
of possibility down to the very lowest.
The merely logical
difficulties of reconciling these two conceptions have already
been suggested;
but logical difficulties, with respect to the
ultimate
objects of thought,
did not greatly trouble
the me-
dieval mind.
The notion of the coincidentiaoppositorum,of the
meeting of extremes in the Absolute, was an essential part of
nearly all medieval theology, as it had been of Neoplatonism;
what Dean Inge has delicately termed"
the fluidity and inter-
penetration
of concepts in the spiritual world," or in plainer
language,
the permissibility
and even necessity of contradict-
ing oneself when one spoke of God, was a principle commonly
enough recognized, though the benefits of it were not usually
extended
to theological
opponents.
The
slight
uneasiness
which the application of such a principle left in the mind could
be, and by the scholastic theologian usually was, alleviated by
the explanation
that the seemingly contradictory
terms were
used in a sensuseminentior-
that is to say, that they did not
have their usual meanings, nor any other meaning which the
human
mind could understand.
But the inner strain in me-
dieval thought
which here concerns us was not simply a dis-
crepancy
between
two speculative- ideas held by the same
minds; it was also a discrepancy between two practical ideals.
It might appear easy to affirm of the divine nature what to us
must seem incompatible
metaphysical
predicates;
but it was
impossible to reconcile in human practice what to us must seem
incompatible
notions of value.
There was no way in which the
flight from the Many to the One, the quest of a perfection de-
fined wholly in terms of contrast with the created world, could
be effectually harmonized
with the imitation
of a Goodness
that delights in diversity and manifests itself in the emanation

84
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
of the Many
out of the One.
The one program
demanded
a withdrawal
from all "attachment
to creatures"
and cul-
minated in the ecstatic contemplation
of the indivisible Divine
Essence;
the other,
if it had
been formulated,
would
have
summoned
men to participate,
in some finite measure,
in the
creative passion of God, to collaborate
consciously in the proc-
esses by which the diversity of things, the fullness of the uni-
verse, is achieved.
It would have found the beatific vision in
the disinterested joy of beholding
the splendor of the creation
or of curiously tracing
out the detail of its infinite variety;
it
would have placed
the active life above the contemplative;
and it would, perhaps,
have conceived
of the activity
of the
creative artist, who at once loves, imitates,
and augments
the
"orderly
variousness"
of the sensible world,
as the mode of
human
life most like the divine.
But in the earlier Middle
Ages these implications,
however
clearly contained
in one side of the accepted body of doctrine,
remained
for the most part
without
effect.
Since the two
theories
of value
could
not be concretely
harmonized,
me-
dieval Christian
philosophy,
like Neoplatonism
before it, was
constrained
to choose between them, and, of course, chose the
first.
It was the Idea of the Good, not the conception
of a
self-transcending
and generative
Goodness,
that
determined
the ethical teaching of the Church
(at least in her counsels of
perfection)
and
shaped
the
assumptions
concerning
man's
chief end which dominated
European
thought
down to the
Renaissance,
and in orthodox
theology,
Protestant
as well as
Catholic, beyond it.
The'
way up' alone was the direction in
which man was to look for the good, even though the God who
had from all eternity perfectly possessed the good which is the
object of man's
quest was held to have found, so to say, his
chief good in the 'way down'
-
had, in the curious and sig-
nificant phrase of the Areopagite,
been"
cozened by goodness
and affection and love, and led down from his eminence above
all and surpassing
all, to being in all."
The consummation
towards which all finite things yearn, and towards which men
were to strive consciously, was to return to and remain in the
Unity which yet did not, and by its essence could not, remain
within itself.

though this amorchemuoueil solee l'altre stellewas the negation
or reversal of the Love which manifested itself in engendering
the multiplicity
of things in heaven and earth.
Sir Thomas
Browne was (as a. recent writer has remarked)
but repeating
the usual scholastic assumption when he wrote that"
things as
they recede from unity, the more they approach
to imperfec-
tion and deformity,
for they behold their perfection
in their
simplicities and as the nearest approach
unto God."
27
But though the scheme of values implicit in the principle of
plenitude lay thus, for the most part, undeveloped
in medieval
philosophy and religion, it was too essential a part of the re-
ceived tradition
to remain
wholly unexpressed;
the conflict
between it and the opposite conception of the good sometimes
becomes apparent
even in the writings of the most orthodox
theologians.
Thus Augustine in a curious chapter De pulchri-
tudinesimulacrorumobserves that"
the supreme art of God"
is
manifested in the variety of the things that it has fashioned out
of nothing,
while the inferiority of human
art is shown in its
limited
ability
to reproduce
this diversity,
or numerositas,of
natural
objects, for example,
of human
bodies.
Augustine,
then, seems on the point of deriving a species of aesthetic theory
from the principle of plenitude;
the function of art, he suggests,
is to imitate or parallel this diversity of the created world as
nearly exhaustively as possible; and this, the argument
mani-
festly implies, is truly an imitatiodei, and therefore par excellence
a religious exercise.
But here the saint checks himself and re-
verts violently to the ascetic and otherworldly
side of his doc-
trine: "Not
that those who fashion such works [of art] are to
be highly esteemed, nor those who take delight in them;
for
when the soul is thus intent upon the lesser things -
things
corporeal which it makes by corporeal means -
it is the less
fixed upon that supreme Wisdom from which it derives these
very powers."
28
Thus Augustine
is involved
in the incon-
gruous conclusion that God as creator is notto be imitated, that

86
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
certain divine powers in which men in a measure participate
are not to be employed by them, and that the creation in which
alone the divine attribute of" goodness" is manifested is not to
be enjoyed.
In the efflorescence of the arts in the later Middle
Ages such an attitude,
though it could not be officially aban-
doned,
clearly
became
increasingly
uncongenial;
and
we
already find Dante dwelling, as even an orthodox and mystical
poet of the fourteenth
century could hardly fail to do, rather
upon the kinship of the work of the artist with the divine office
of creation.
Since, according to Aristotle, art is the imitation
of Nature, and since Nature is the manifestation
of the perfec-
tion of God, it follows that"
your art is as it were a grandchild
of God"
(vostraartea Dio quasieNipote).29 In the Renaissance
this aspect of the medieval conception comes fully into its own.
"Non merita nome di Creatore,"
said Tasso proudly, "se non
Iddio ed il Poeta" ; and Giordano Bruno wrote that"
the gods
take pleasure in the multiform
representations
of multiform
things, in the multiform fruits of all talents; for they have as
great pleasure in all the things that are, and in all representa-
tions that are made of them, as in taking care that they be and
giving order and permission that they be made."
30
In its ethical bearings the conflict between the implications
of the two conceptions of the imitatio dei may be plainly dis-
cerned in Thomas Aquinas.
He often declares that"
the crea-
ture approaches more nearly to God's likeness if it is not only
good but can also act for the goodness of other things, than if it
is merely good in itself," since God's goodness"
outpours
it-
self."
It is for this reason, among others, that it is well that
"there
is in the creatures plurality and inequality '"; if all were
in all respects equal, none could " act for the advantage
of an-
other."
31 Yet in the end, of course, the true perfection of man
does not consist, for Thomas any more than for Augustine, in
any concern with the creatures to whom one can communicate
good; it consists in the blissful absorption
of the whole con-
sciousness of the individual
in the contemplation
of a God to
whom one can communicate
no good.
If we turn to a typical seventeenth-century
Platonist,
we
may see the same conflict between these two equally Platonic
conceptions of deity, and therefore of the good, still persisting,.

and in an even more acute form.
John
Norris of Bemerton
(r657-171 r) dwells
with
almost
equal
fondness
upon
the
thought
of the eternal
self-containedness
and
the perpetual
self-diffusiveness implicit in the idea of an Absolute and Perfect
Being.
God is, on the one hand,
"the
universal
Plenitude,
whose happiness
is consummated
within his own circle, who
supports himself upon the basis of his own all-sufficiency and is
his own end and center."
But on the other hand:
The nature of God involves, as in notion and conception,
so likewise in
truth and reality,
absolute and infinite perfection;
and consequently,
in-
cludes a beneficent and communicative
disposition, this being a perfection.
Nor does the superlative eminency of the divine nature only argue him to
be communicative
but to be the most communicative
and self-diffusive of
all beings.
For as all kinds, so also all degrees of excellency must of neces-
sity be included in a being absolutely and infinitely perfect.
. . .
This ex-
cellent communicativeness of the Divine Nature is typically represented, and
mysteriously exemplified by the Porphyrian
Scale of Being.
And Norris accordingly,
in his Divine Hymn on the Creation,em-
broiders
pleasantly
and
devoutly
upon
the
theme
of the
Timaeus:
Love, gentle Love, unlockt [God's] fruitful breast,
And woke the Ideas which there dormant
lay.
Awak'd their beauties they display;
Th' Almighty smil'd to see
The comely form of harmony
Of His eternal imag'ry;
He saw 'twas good and fair, and th' infant platform blest:
Ye seeds of being, in whose fair bosoms dwell
The forms of all things possible,
Arise and your prolific force display."
Norris therefore finds it difficult to see how a universe which is
a replica
of the world of Ideas enhanced
by the additional
dignity
of existence,
a universe
which
thus
manifests
the
"favorite
and darling
excellence"
of its Author
and deserves
his praise, can be an unworthy
object of delight for man.
If the beauty and variety of the creature was so considerable as to merit
approbation
from Him that made it, what is there of our love and compla-
cency that it may not challenge?
That which can but pleaseGod may well
be supposed to satisfy man;
that wherein the Creator delights, the creature,
one would think, might fully rest and acquiesce in.
By such considerations

88
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
as these, when solely attended to, I have been sometimes almost prevailed
upon to think that there is good enough in the creation of God, if amassed
together
and fully enjoyed, to employ the whole activity of my love and
fix the entire weight of my soul.
Yet, even here, the otherworldly
mood finally prevails;
no
created thing can satisfy man:
When I consider experience, and compare the aspirations of my nature
with the goodness of the creation, I am driven to conclude that, although
the creatures of God ...
are all good enough to afford matter for enter-
tainment and praise, yet they cannot detain and give anchorage to the soul
of man. . ..
Some repast may be found in the creature, but as for com..
plete satisfaction, and termination of desires, theSeasaith, it is notin me; and
the Depth saith, it is not in me. All that God ever did or ever can make, will
prove insufficient for this purpose, and come under that decretory sentence
of the wise Preacher, Vanity of Vanities, all is vanity.
Nor does Norris stop with this; he goes on to declare that in
finite things not even a part of our good is to be found;
the
heavenly Beauty should be not only the ultimate
but the sole
object of man's love.
Whatever portion of our love does not run in this channel must neces-
sarily fix upon disproportionate
and unsatisfied objects, and therefore be
an instrument of discontent to us. 'Tis necessary, therefore, to the complet-
ing of our happiness, that that object should engrossour affections to itself,
which only can satisfy them;
. . . [as] the eye does not only love light above
other things, but delights in nothing else.
Doubtless,
Norris grants,
this is a counsel of perfection
not
always practicable
in this life. "It
is the privilege and happi-
ness of those confirmed spirits who are so swallowed up in the
comprehensions
of eternity,
and so perpetually
ravished with
the glories of the Divine Beauty, that they have not the power
to turn aside to any other object."
But we may even in this
world
approximate
to this absorption
in the
otherworldly
good; and the more nearly we do so, "the
fewer disappoint-
ments and dissatisfactions we shall meet with."
33
There was, of course, a familiar device for mediating in some
degree
between
the two elements
of the
Platonic
heritage
which in these passages seem to be merely in blank opposition
to one another -

those saints and
mystics, pagan
or Christian,
whose other-
worldliness
was of the less acrid
and impatient
sort.
Even
though
(according
to one side of the traditional
assumptions)
no true value could be ascribed to any created thing, it might
nevertheless
be assumed
that
the approach
to the supreme
good was normally,
or even necessarily, gradual;
and the cur-
rency of the metaphor
of the scale or ladder of being made such
a concepti on seem the more natural.
The
graded
series of
creatures
down which the divine life in its overflow had de-
scended
might
be conceived
to constitute
also the stages of
man's ascent to the divine life in its self-contained
complete-
ness. Thus, like Adam's angelic schoolmaster
in ParadiseLost,
the philosophers
who could not bring
themselves
wholly to
accept"
that decretory
sentence of the wise Preacher,"
dwelt
upon the necessity of gradualness
in the"
way up," and
The scale of nature set
From center to circumference, whereon
In contemplation of created things
By steps we may ascend to God.
For thus at least a provisional
and instrumental
value might
be recognized
in things natural,
even while all genuine good
was declared
to lie in a supersensible
and supernatural
order.
Man might legitimately
permit his mind to busy itself with the
creatures
and to find joy in them, so long as he used each of
them as a means of passage to what lay above it on the vast
slope of being.
It was to this conception
that appeal was com-
monly made to justify that worldly employment,
the study of
natural
science.
Even in the eulogy of astronomy
at the be-
ginning of the De reoolutionibusorbium,the labors of the man of
science are represented
as a way of ascending
this scale; the
final reason for engaging in them is -
not, it is to be observed,
that
they are occupied
with the works of God as Creator,
though that consideration
is mentioned
-
but
that"
we are
drawn on by them, as by a vehicle, to the contemplation
of the
highest good."
34
Yet plainly the conception
of the creation
as a ladder
for
man's ascent did not really reconcile the implications
of the
principle
of plenitude
as a theory
of value with the other-

go
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
worldly side of Platonistic philosophy and Christian theology.
For, in the first place, the parallel between the descending and
the ascending process was little more than verbal.
The scale
of being conceived as a ladder by which man might mount to
beatitude
was not literally composed of the same steps as the
scale of being conceived as the series of natural forms. No one,
I think, seriously proposed, as the true method of man's salva-
tion, that he should begin by fixing his thought,
whether by
way of intellectual
contemplation
or aesthetic
enjoyment,
upon what Macrobius called"
the dregs of being," and should
then proceed from these, by minute
transitions,
through
the
successively more complex forms of plant life, should pass from
these to the" zoophytes,"
from these in turn to shellfish, from
these to fishes, from these to the higher animals, and so on in
detail
through
the hierarchy
of nature
as medieval
natural
history conceived it, and finally through the successive grades
of angels.
The notion of infinitesimal gradation,
which was of
the essence of the cosmological
Chain
of Being, was hardly
suitable to a program
which was, after all, designed to bring
man as speedily as possible to his final supersensible felicity,
or to as close an approximation
to it as the conditions of earthly
life permit.
If that consummation
were the goal, it was not
really evident that a gradual
approach
was the best; at most
such gradualness
could in consistency be regarded
only as a
concession to man's weakness -
a dangerous concession, to be
made only grudgingly
and whenever
possible to be avoided
altogether.
And finally, the program
of "ascent
to God by
contemplation
of created
things"
admitted
no such inherent
worth in the mere existence of imperfect beings in all possible
diversity as was implied by the principle
of plenitude.
Con-
ceived as steps in the stairway
up to perfection,
the lower
grades of being had only the use that belongs to steps, that of
things to be spurned and transcended;
and such a conception
had little in common with the assumption that the existence of
each of these grades is a thing so good on its own account that
God himself had been, so to say, constrained
by his very di-
vinity and rationality
to engender everyone
of them.
A single example

of these
last observations;

losophy though
not in its date -
from a famous devotional
book of the Counter-Reformation,
the work of one who was
scarcely the less a mystic for being a most aggressive and re-
doubtable
theological
controversialist.
Cardinal
Bellarmino's
(1542-1621) treatise De aseensionementis in Deumper sealas erea-
turarumis perhaps
the most celebrated
modern
elaboration
of
this conception,
and
it shows plainly
the usual
incongruity
between the importance
given to the principle
of plenitude
in
the doctrine
of the attributes
of deity and the exclusion of it
from the theory of the chief good of man.
At first the creation
seems to be represented
as the diffracting
lens through which
alone any vision of God is possible to a finite mind ja
multi-
plicity which does not exclude
absolute
simplicity
is beyond
our comprehension,
and therefore, if we are to behold at all the
perfection
of the divine essence, it must be broken up for us
into distinct parts.
God willed that man should in some measure know him through
his
creatures, and because no single created thing could fitly represent the in-
finite perfection of the Creator,
he multiplied
creatures,
and bestowed on
each a certain degree of goodness and perfection, that from these we might
form some idea of the goodness and perfection of the Creator, who, in one
most simple and perfect essence, contains infinite perfections.
Thus it is in the consideration
of the diversity of existent things
that we corne, says Bellarmino,
to realize the infinite variety
which
(though
without
detriment
to simplicity)
is of the
essence of the Divine Reason:
Though
the mere multitude
of created things is itself wonderful, and a
proof of the multiform perfection of the one God, still more wonderful is the
variety which appears in that multiplication,
and it leads us more easily to
the knowledge of God; for it is not difficult for one seal to make many im-
pressions exactly alike, but to vary shapes almost infinitely, which.is what
God has done in creation, this is in truth a divine work, and most worthy of
admiration.
I pass by genera and species, which everyone agrees are exceed-
ingly various and diverse. . . .
Raise now
my soul, the eye of thy mind
towards God, in whom are the Ideas of all things and from whom, as from
an inexhaustible
fountain,
this well-nigh infinite variety springs: for God
could not have impressed those numberless forms on created things unless
in a most eminent and exalted mode he had kept their Ideas or patterns in
the depths of his own Being.

92
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Yet the conclusion to which all this might seem to tend is not
drawn, but rather its opposite: it is not in the further tracing
out of the complexity and richness of detail in nature or human
nature
through
scientific inquiry,
nor yet in the imitation
of
that "divine
work most worthy of admiration"
through
the
representation
in art of its inexhaustible
diversity, that man is
to busy himself. His concern is still withthe
One, not with the
Many.
For all "the
various goods which are found distrib-
uted among created
things are found in altogether
a higher
way united in God."
35 The great Jesuit controversialist
is, in-
deed, no harsh ascetic of the fashion of Bernard of Clairvaux;
nor will he go to the extreme represented
by such a mystic of
the Counter-Reformation
as St. John of the Cross, who bade
"the spiritual man aim at complete abstraction
and forgetful-
ness, so that,
as much as possible, no knowledge or form of
created things -
as if they existed not -
shall remain in his
memory."
Bellarmino concedes that"
we are not commanded
while on this earth to put away from us all consolation from
creatures."
Yet their chief office is to remind us of their own
transiency and insufficiency, or to serve as sensible symbols of
supersensible
attributes
of deity, and thus to show that"
all
things other than God are vanity and vexation of spirit, which
have no existence, but only appear to have, and do not afford
solace, but only affliction."
"The
ascent of the ladder
of
created things"
is, after all, only another name for a progres-
sive contemptusmundi..
There is, it will be observed, in the passage of Bellarmino
last cited a touch of illusionism, an intimation
of the doctrine
that all plurality
and individuation
are mere unreal appear-
ances.
The temptation
to lapse into the phraseology of illu-
sionism has never been very remote from either Neoplatonic or
Catholic
metaphysics,
partly
because
the
otherworldly
or
mystical mood naturally
expresses itself by treating
as mere
nonentity
the world from which it turns away, partly because
such a conception
offers a seeming alleviation
of that inner
logical conflict of which I have been speaking.
If one resorts
to that easy, if self-contradictory,
expedient of denying that the
manifold of finite things has any existence, all problems dis-
appear at a stroke; since nothing except the One really exists,

there is nothing really to be explained.
Yet this was not a way
of escape from its difficulties which Christian
theology could
adopt.
It is not, indeed, that
the otherworldliness
of either
Neoplatonic
or Catholic philosophy
was in itself less extreme
in degree than that of the Vedanta
or of other Indian systems.
When the mind of Plotinus, or of Augustine, or of the Pseudo-
Areopagite, or ofJohn the Scot, or even of Thomas Aquinas, is
turned
solely upon
that
side of his doctrine,
he is not less
thorough-going
than
the sages of the more mystical Upani-
shads, or than Shankara,
in asserting the' otherness'
of the true
reality and the only genuine good -
its absolute exclusion of
all the characteristics
of the existence which we now experience
or of which our discursive thought can frame any conception."
The difference is merely that the Occidental
doctrine was es-
sentially dual; it asserted this, but it also asserted the opposite;
the second of the two elements was firmly incorporated
in its
substance as much by its Platonistic
as by its Jewish sources.
The influence of the Timaeus and of the Neoplatonic
dialectic,
mediated
chiefly through
the
Pseudo-Dionysius,
combined
with the authority
of Genesis to constrain the medieval
theo-
logian to affirm a real generation
of a real universe of particu-
lar existents
and
to identify
deity
with
self-expansive
and
creative
energy.
Consequently
the language
of acosmism,
when it shows itself in a writer, like Bellarmino, well grounded
in this tradition,
is never to be taken too literally;
it is only an
extreme statement
of one side of this double doctrine,
which
must be understood
to be offset, however inconsistently,
by the
other side.
The long suppressed conflict between the two strains in the
traditional
complex
of presuppositions
developed
in some
writers of the Renaissance
into an overt dualism of two war-
ring principles, one good and one evil, but both necessarily in-
herent
in the divine nature
itself, and consequently
present
also in human
nature.
And it is significant
that in some of
these early modern recombinations
of ideas derived from Pla-
tonistic, Jewish,
and
Christian
sources, the usual
medieval
preference
is reversed;
the higher value is given, not to the
Unmoved Mover, the state in which the One is undivided and
eternally
at rest in its own self-sufficiency, but rather
to the

94
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
restless" active principle,"
which is manifested in becoming,
motion,
diversification.
Thus
Robert
Fludd
(1574-1637),
developing
a dualism derived
partly,
apparently,
from the
philosophy of Bernardino Telesio and partly from Kabbalistic
sources, tells us that as, in the divine essence,
the potential
or dark principle, is contrary
and opposite in his essential
property, unto the actual emanation of light beginning, so also have each
of them manifested, or brought forth into this world, two offsprings, or essen-
tial properties, which are oppugnant
in condition, and flat adversaries in
their nature unto one another;
and the two active virtues are Cold and
Heat. . . .
For the property of the dark Nothing, or deformed abyss, is
naturally to rest, and not to act or operate;
and the reason is, because that
its appetite is to be conversant in and about the center, beyond the which
there is no motion or action, and not to dilate itself towards the circumfer-
ence, as the Spirit of light, or God in his volunty, or patent nature, is ac-
customed to do.
For this reason, the dark principle doth challenge unto
itself, by a natural instinct, rest and quietness, and this property begetteth
or produceth
one essential virtue of its own condition, namely, cold, the.
which, as it is elected as a champion to resist the assaults of her opposite,
namely of Heat, whose comparisons are motion or action;
...
so unless
it be roused or stirred up by the assaults of Heat, it moveth not, but seemeth
to wait upon its drowsy mother, Darkness and privation, whose children
are fixation and rest, which sleep in and cleave fast unto the center, and
therefore are unwilling to look forth towards the circumference.
And in
verity, cold is an essential act, proceeding from, and attending on, the divine
puissance, which in this property doth contract its beams from the circum-
ference into its self.
It is, then, this property of God's essence, sensibly manifested in
cold, which "is the mother of privation,
death, vacuity, in-
anity, deformation,"
the"
only efficient cause of inspissation,
contraction,
fixation, immobility, ponderosity, rest, obtenera-
tion or darkness, of mortification, privation, stupefaction, and
such like."
37 Doubtless, Fludd feels constrained to admit, "it
is a wondrous thing, and passing all human understanding,
that out of one Unity in essence and nature, two branches of
such opposite nature
should arise and sprout forth, as are
Darkness (which is the seat of error, deformity, contention,
privation,
death)
and Light, which is the vehicle of truth,
beauty, love, position, and the like."
It is not surprising"
that
the sect of the Manicheans did so stiffly hold that there were
two co-eternal
principles";
and Fludd,
though
he cannot,

CONFLICTS
IN MEDIEVAL THOUGHT
95
either as Christian or as Platonist, give up the doctrine of the
derivation
of all being from a single, simple, and perfect es-
sence, nevertheless is uneasily aware that his two divine attri-
butes, or what we are compelled to conceive as such, have in all
practical
respects much the same roles as God and the Devil.
What
concerns us here is that the part of devil-within-the-
deity is taken by the attribute
of self-sufficiency or self-con-
tainment,
of which the influence is manifested by the tendency
in things to seek the moveless centre of Being; this is that"
dis-
cording,
privative
and hateful affection which darkness and
deformity doth afford unto the children of light and life, and
to all the beauteous offspring thereof."
38 It is when deity goes
forth of itself and lives in its" benign emanations"
that, so to
say, its
better
nature
is manifested.P
'Plenitude,'
conse-
quently,
is one of Fludd's
sacred
words,
while
he dilates
eagerly upon nature's
horrorvacui:
Job argueth that Vacuity, Inanity, and Darkness, are one and the same
thing;
to wit, Vacuity, Inanity,
or Voidness, because that all fullness or
plenitude is from God in his actual property.
. . .
The earth that was be-
fore the revelation of God's spirit inane and void, is now become full of
divine Light, and multiplying Grace.
Whereupon it was no more void and
empty, that is to say, destitute of essential being, but became fertile and
fruitful, being now replenished with divine fire and the incorruptible
spirit
of God, according unto that of Solomon, Spiritus disciplinaesanetus implet
orbemterrarum; • . .
And the Apostle, Christusimpletomnia, Christ filleth all
things. Whereby we may perceive, that all plenitude is from the divine Act,
as contrariwise Vacuity is, when that formal life is absent from the waters,
and this is the reason that Vacuumor Inane is held so horrible a thing in
Nature.
Forasmuch
as the utter absence of the eternal emanation, is in-
tolerable to the creature, because that everything desireth fervently to be
informed, and that by a natural
appetite or affection, and therefore it is
abominable unto each natural thing to be utterly deprived of being.t?
Thus
in Fludd
the "evil
principle"
is defined
in precisely
those terms in which the traditional
philosophy
was wont to
express the nature of the perfection in which all desire finds its
consummation:
Here all thy turns and revolutions cease,
Here's all serenity and peace;
Thou'rt
to the Center come, the native seat of rest,
There's now no further change, nor need there be,
When One shall be Variety."

96
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
To Fludd the "native
seat of rest" was the abode of darkness
and death,
and the existence which is "conversant
in and
about
the center"
is the negation
of all good.
Yet he was
merely carrying out to its logical consequence
one of the two
tendencies which had been forcibly conjoined in the Platonistic
and the Christian
tradition.
Another
form of this conflict may be noted.
The good for
any being, according
to an accepted
principle
also inherited
from the Greek philosophy of the fifth century B.C., lies in the
realization
of its specific" nature";
and it was, therefore, cus-
tomary to formulate
the argument
even for the most extreme
otherworldliness
nominally in terms of" conformity to nature"
in this sense.
But the concrete meaning given to this was de-
rived wholly from that dialectic whereby the good was identi-
fied with self-sufficiency.
Man, as rational, was declared to be
capable of realizing his nature
only in the possession of abso-
lute, underivative,
and infinite good, that is to say, in a com-
plete union or assimilatiointellectusspeculatioi42 with the 'divine
perfection and beatitude.
But this denaturalization
of the no-
tion of specifically human good would have been impossible if
the logic of the principle of plenitude
had been applied at this
point, as in a later age it was to be applied.
Of this long-lasting
conjunction
of essentially incompatible
ideas, three aspects of which we have been examining,
the
significance may now be expressed in more general terms.
The
most important
and distinctive circumstance
in the history of
religious and moral
philosophy
in the Occident
is the fact
that both later Platonism and the accepted
philosophy of the
Church
combined
otherworldliness
with
a virtual,
if not
usually a literal or unqualified,
optimism.
Both were equally
committed
to the two contradictory
theses that'
this' world is
an essentially evil thing to be escaped from, and that its exist-
ence, with precisely the attributes
it has, is a good so great that
in the production
of it the divinest of all the attributes
of deity
was manifested.
Of the temporal,
sensible,
divided
world
from which it would turn men's thoughts and affections away,
a consistent otherworldly
philosophy may give anyone
of three
accounts.
It may, as we have seen, say that the belief that any

CONFLICTS
IN MEDIEVAL THOUGHT
97
such world exists is a pure illusion.
It may, while not denying
the reality of the world, declare that it oughtnever to have been,
that the genesis of anything other than the Eternal and Perfect
One was an utter and inexplicable
disaster.
Or it may, with
primitive Buddhism,
refuse to discuss such merely speculative
questions as the origin, raisond'etre.,or metaphysical
status of
the world, or even the positive nature of the goal to be sought,
and devote its whole energy to persuading
men that temporal
and sentient existence is an unmitigated
evil and to showing
them a way of escape from it. 43 But to a choice between these
three forms of pessimism such a philosophy is limited."
There
was manifest
for a time in Western
religious thought -
in
Manichaeism
and in the Gnostic Christian heresies -
a strong
tendency towards the second of these positions; if this tendency
had prevailed
none of the incongruities
which we have been
noting
would
have arisen.
The
emergence
out of the un-
troubled
peace of the divine life of a groaning
and travailing
creation,
a universe of sundered
and temporal
and corporeal
beings, would have been regarded as the original and essential
Fall, and whatever Demiurgus was conceived to be concerned
in the business would have been regarded
as the original and
essential Devil.
How much there was in the assumptions
ac-
cepted
both by pagan
Platonists
and Christian
theologians,
during
the first four centuries,
which might have seemed to
make inevitable
some outcome
of this type is evident.
The
significance
of the decision -
concretely
manifested
in the
rejection of the temper and doctrines of the Gnostics by Plo-
tinus and, more dramatically,
in Augustine's
conversion from
Manichaeism
-
in favor of a fruitful inconsistency, was not to
become clearly apparent
until modern
times, nor, indeed, in
its entirety,
until
the eighteenth
century.
But through
the
Middle Ages there were at least kept alive, in an age of which
the official doctrine was predominantly
otherworldly,
certain
roots of an essentially'
this-worldly'
philosophy:
the assump-
tion that there is a true and intrinsic multiplicity
in the divine
nature,
that
is to say, in the world of Ideas;
that,
further,
"existence
is a good," i. e., that the addition of concrete actu-
ality to universals, the translation
of supersensible 'possibilities

98
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
into sensible realities, means an increase, not a loss, of value;
that, indeed, the very essence of the good consists in the maxi-
mal actualization
of variety;
and that the world of temporal
and sensible experience is thus good, and the supreme mani-
festation of the divine.

IV
THE PRINCIPLE
OF PLENITUDE
AND THE
NEW COSMOGRAPHY
IN BRINGINGabout the change from the medieval to the mod-
ern conception
of the scale of magnitude
and
the general
arrangement
of the physical world in space, it was not the
Copernican
hypothesis, nor even the splendid achievements of
scientific astronomy
during the two following centuries,
that
played
the most significant
and decisive part.
In the cos-
mography that by the beginning of the eighteenth century had
come to be commonly held among educated men, the features
which differentiated
the new from the old world-picture
most
widely, those whereby it most affected the imagination
and
modified the prevalent
conception of man's place in the uni-
verse, the traditional
religious beliefs, and the mood of re-
ligious feeling, -
these features owed their introduction
and,
for the most part, their eventual general acceptance, not to the
actual discoveries or the technical reasonings of astronomers,
but to the influence of those originally Platonistic metaphysical
preconceptions
which,
as the preceding
lecture
has shown,
had, though potent and persistent, been always repressed and
abortive in medieval thought.
In order to make this evident
it is needful, first of all, to consider what those aspects of the
older cosmography were which had, or seemed to the medieval
mind
to have,
religious
and
moral
implications -
which
helped to determine
how far men could feel themselves emo-
tionally at home in their world and after what fashion they
should conceive their status and role therein.
It is an error to suppose that the medieval world was a small
affair, in which the earth bulked relatively large.
Though the
distances
in the Ptolemaic
system were trivial
beside those
hundreds
of millions of light-years
in which the astronomer
of today reckons, they were not trivial in proportion
to the
terrestrial magnitudes which furnish the scale for the imagina-

100
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
tion.
Ptolemy himself had said that the earth is a mere dot in
comparison
with the heavens.
Maimonides
late in the twelfth
century wrote in The Guideofthe Perplexed:
In order to form a correct estimate of ourselves we must consider the re-
sults of the investigations which have been made into the dimensions and
distances of the spheres and stars.
It has been shown that the distance be-
tween the centre of the earth and the summit of the sphere of Saturn is a
journey of about eight thousand seven hundred years of 365 days, assuming
that one walked forty leagues a day [i. e., the distance, in round numbers,
is 125 million miles]. . . .
Consider this vast and terrifying distance; it is
of it that the Scripture declares: Is not God in the height of Heaven? and behold
the height oj the stars, how high they are! . ..
This great distance which has
been shown is, however, only a minimum;
for the distance from the centre
of the earth to the concave side of the sphere of the fixed stars cannot be less,
and may be many times greater.
. . .
As for the sphere of the fixed stars,
its thickness must be at least as great as one of the stars contained in it, of
which each has a volume exceeding that of the terrestrial globe more than
ninety times ; and it is possible that
the sphere itself is much thicker still.
Of the ninth sphere which imparts to all the others their diurnal motion,
the measure is not known;
for as it contains no stars we have no means of
judging of its magnitude.
Consider, then, how immense is the size of these
bodies, and how numerous they are.
And if the earth is thus no bigger
than a point relatively to the sphere of the fixed stars, what must be the
ratio of the human species to the created universe as a whole?
And how
then can any of us think that these things exist for his sake, and that they
are meant to serve his uses? 1
Roger
Bacon dilated
with unwearying
enthusiasm
upon the
rerummagnitudo. "The
least of the visible stars is greater
than
the earth;
but the least of the stars has, in comparison
with the
heavens, virtually
no size. . ..
According
to Ptolemy a fixed
star, because of the magnitude
of the heaven,
does not com-
plete its circuit in less than thirty-six thousand
years, though it
moves with
incredible
velocity.
But it is possible to walk
round
the earth in less than three years."
2 The theme con-
tinued
to be a favorite one with the anti-Copernicans
in the
sixteenth century.
Du Bartas, for example,
thus labored it (I
quote from Sylvester's version of La Sepmaine, 1592):
The least star that we perceive to shine
Above, disperst in th' arches crystalline,
(If, at the least, star-clarks be credit worth)
Is eighteen times bigger then all the earth.

PLENITUDE

101
Yea, though a king by wile or war had won
All the round earth to his subjection,
Lo, here the guerdon of his glorious pains:
A needle's point, a mote, a mite, he gains,
A nit, a nothing (did he all possess).3
But though the medieval world was thus immense, relatively
to man and his planet,
it was nevertheless definitely limited
and fenced about.
It was therefore essentially picturable;
the
perspectives
which
it presented,
however
great,
were
not
wholly baffling to the imagination.
The men of the fifteenth
century
still lived in a walled universe as well as in walled
towns.
And -
unlike medieval
towns and other
medieval
things -
this cosmical scheme had the essential qualities of a
work of classical art; indeed, the most classical thing in the
Middle Ages may be said to have been the universe.
Men pre-
ferred to worship in Gothic churches, but the architecture
of
the heavens was not a piece of Gothic design -
which is not
surprising since it was, in fact, a Grecian edifice.
The world
had a clear intelligible unity of structure, and not only definite
shape, but what was deemed at once the simplest and most
perfect shape, as had all the bodies composing it.
It had no
loose ends, no irregularities of outline.
The simplicity of its in-
ternal plan had, indeed, under the pressure of observed astro-
nomical facts, come to be more and more recognized
as less
complete
than
one could wish; but the chief poetic cicerone
through the universe paid little attention to these troublesome
complications
of detail, and they probably did not much dis-
turb the non-astronomical
mind.
It has often been said that the older picture of the world in
space was peculiarly fitted to give man a high sense ofhis own
importance
and dignity; and some modern writers have made
much of this supposed implication
of the pre-Copernican
as-
tronomy.'
Man occupied, we are told, the central place in the
universe, and round
the planet of his habitation
all the vast,
unpeopled
spheres obsequiously
revolved. 5
But the actual
tendency of the geocentric system was, for the medieval mind,
precisely the opposite.
For the centre of the world was not a
position of honor;
it was rather
the place farthest removed
from the Empyrean,
the bottom of the creation, to which its

102
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
dregs and baser elements sank. The actual centre, indeed, was
Hell; in the spatial sense the medieval world was literally dia-
bolocentric.
And the whole sublunary
region was, of course,
incomparably
inferior to the resplendent
and incorruptible
heavens above the moon.
Thus Montaigne,
still adhering
to
the older astronomy,
could consistently describe man's dwell-
ing-place as "the filth and mire of the world, the worst, lowest,
most lifeless part
of the universe,
the bottom
story of the
house."
How, then, he demanded,
could a creature native to
it and fellow-lodger with"
the lowest of the three orders of
animals"
(i. e., land animals) dare in imagination"
to place
himself above the circle of the moon, and reduce heaven under
his feet"?
"By what authority,"
asks Montaigne,
can man
assume that
"this
admirable
moving of heaven's
vault,
the
eternal light of these lamps rolling so proudly over his head,
...
were established and continue so many ages for his com-
modity and service?"
6 John Wilkins in 1640 mentions, as one
of the arguments still advanced against the Copernican system,
that drawn
from the vileness of our earth, because it consists of a more sordid and base
matter than any other part of the world; and therefore must be situated in
the centre, which is the worst place, and at the greatest distance from those
purer incorruptible
bodies, the heavens. 7
It is sufficiently evident from such passages that the geocentric
cosmography
served rather for man's humiliation
than for his
exaltation, and that Copernican ism was opposed partly on the
ground that it assigned too dignified .and lofty a position to his
dwelling-place.
There
were,
of course,
other
elements
in the
medieval
Christian system which wereadapted to breed in the featherless
biped a high sense of his cosmic importance
and of the mo-
mentousness of his own doings.
But these were not connected
with the geocentric astronomy;
they easily could survive, and
were, indeed, little affected by, its abandonment.
It was not
the position of our planet in space, but the fact that it alone was
supposed to have an indigenous population
of rational beings
whose final destiny was not yet settled, that gave it its unique
status in the world and a unique
share in the attention
of

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
1°3
Heaven.
If it was the only region of corruption
it was also the
only region of generation;
here alone new souls were born, im-
mortal destinies still hung in the balance,
and, in some sense,
the fulfilment of the design of the Creator himself was at stake.
If, then, this dim and squalid cellar of the universe was (with
one exception)
the least respectable
place in which any beings
could have their abode, it was also the place in which all that
was really dramatic
and stirring
was going on.
Thus,
with
however glaring a contradiction
of the doctrines of the divine
self-sufficiency and impassibility,
the affairs of men were con-
ceived to be objects of immeasurable
solicitude on the part of
Deity itself; so that a single natural
folly of an unsophisticated
pair in Mesopotamia
could, by its consequences,
constrain one
of the persons of the Godhead
to take on human flesh and live
and die upon this globe for man's salvation.
Throughout
his-
tory lesser beings from the upper world had been busy minis-
trants to man, while rebel spirits had been scarcely less flatter-
ingly engrossed in the enterprise of his destruction.
"As I was
looking,"
says a character
in one of Zangwill's
novels, "at
Signorelli's'
Descent into Hell,' I was thinking how vividly our
ancestors
enjoyed
life, how important
each
individual
soul
was, to have the ranged battalions of Heaven and Hell fighting
for it.
What an intense sense of the significanceof life!"
The
actual
pleasurableness
of this conception
to the medieval
be-
liever may perhaps
be doubted;
to be the bone of contention
between powers so great and each, in its own way, so exacting,
was hardly an agreeable position for the average sensual man,
even
aside from
his natural
apprehensions
concerning
the
eventual
issue of the conflict in his own case.
But undeniably
it was a position which tended to encourage
and justify a cer-
tain racial
amour propre. This was, however,
related
to the
current
cosmography
only in so far as that implied that this
planet
alone contained
a race of free creatures
half-material
and half-spiritual
-
the middle link in the Chain of Being -
for whose
allegiance
the
celestial
and
the infernal
powers
competed.
What was poetically and religiously significant in the older
cosmography
was, then,
little
touched
by the
Copernican
theory.
For Copernicus
the solar system and the universe re-

1°4
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
mained
identical;
his world, though
not geocentric,
was still
centred, still spherical in shape, still securely walled in by the
outermost
sphere, se ipsam et omnia continens:" So long as the
whole sensible universe remained
thus limited
and boxed-in,
and so long as the planet occupied by man, whatever its spatial
position, was still assigned a unique biological, moral, and re-
ligious status, the aesthetically
and practically
distinctive char-
acteristics of the medieval cosmical scheme remained.
And the
one change of this kind implied
by the abandonment
of the
geocentric
system was, as is evident
from what
has already
been said, the reverse of that often attributed
to the new as-
tronomy;
to remove man from the centre of things was to raise
him from his low estate.
It meant also the denial of the Aris-
totelian
notion
that
the central
position
is a peculiarly
de-
graded one, and of the whole antithesis between the sublunary
world of becoming and the immortal
and immutable
heavens.
But this had already been attacked by several medieval writers.
More than a century before Copernicus,
for example, Nicolaus
Cusanus
had rejected
the assumption
that
the earth
is the
basest part of the universe; we do not know, he declared,
that
death and corruption
are peculiar
to this globe, and the divi-
sion of the heavens into two parts, occupied by essentially dif-
ferent sorts of bodies, is without justification.
9 This incidental
implication
of Copernicanism,
then, was not novel, though it
still seemed to some, in the sixteenth
century,
startling
and
revolutionary.
And the most serious blow to the traditional
conception was given, not by the reasonings of Copernicus,
but
by Tycho Brahe's discovery of Nova Cassiopeiaein 1572-
A strange new visitant
To heavens unchangeable,
as the world believed,
Since the creation.
At this time the Copernican
theory had made little progress
and was, of course, not accepted even by Tycho himself; it can-
not, therefore, be credited with the breaking down of the divi-
sion of the world in space into two regions utterly dissimilar in
their properties
and dignity.
A non-geocentric
arrangement
of the heavens could, indeed,
plausibly be regarded
as more harmonious
than the Ptolemaic

PLENITUDE

105
scheme with the Christian theology; and this consideration
did
at least as much as any purely astronomical
reasons to gain the
potent support of Kepler for the new hypothesis -
or rather,
for a significant modification
of it.
For though the theory of
Copernicus
had ascribed the motions which account for "the
appearances"
to the earth rather
than to the spheres of the
sun, planets, and fixed stars, it was not, of course, a heliocentric
theory;
the centre of the world was the centre of the earth's
orbit.
The sun, though nearest that position, did not occupy
it, and the planes of the planetary
orbits did not pass through
the sun. Thus, as Dreyer has pointed out, Copernicus had still
"felt compelled to give the earth quite an exceptional position
in his new system" -
so that, as Dreyer somewhat mislead-
ingly adds, "the
earth was nearly as important
a body in the
new system as in the old"
(the truth being, as we have seen,
that its position in the old system was not one of importance).
The heliocentric theory, properly so called, was due to Kepler,
not to Copernicus.
In spite of Aristotle there doubtless had
always been, for the imagination,
a certain
incongruity
be-
tween the central position of the idea of God in medieval meta-
physics and the peripheral
position of the Empyrean
in me-
dieval cosmology;
and the chief merit of his new system in
Kepler's
eyes was that it eliminated
this incongruity,
placing
atthe
heart of the sensible universe the body which could most
naturally
be regarded
as the physical symbol or counterpart
of
deity, or, more precisely, of the first Person of the Trinity
-
the orb which was admittedly"
the most excellent of all," the
source of all light and color and heat, "that
which alone we
should judge to be worthy of the Most High God if he should
be pleased with a material domicile and choose a place in which
to dwell with the blessed angels."
10
It is not without perti-
nency to the general theme with which we are concerned that
this theological
argument
for the heliocentric
theory appeals
to Kepler especially because he is here thinking of God, not in
the Aristotelian manner as a self-contained and unmoved final
cause of motion and endeavor in other beings, but chiefly as a
generative
and self-diffusive energy."
And
how essentially
medieval the cosmography
even of Kepler remained
may be
seen from the way in which he further
carried out his astro-

106
THE GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
nomico-theological
parallelism
and from the fact that,
pre-
cisely by means of the heliocentric system, he was able to find
new reasons for conceiving the world to be as definitely limited
and enclosed as it had been in the system of Ptolemy.
If the
sun is the analogue of God the Father,
the sphere of the fixed
stars, Kepler finds, is manifestly the sensible counterpart
of the
Son, the intermediate
region of the planets being assigned to
the Holy Ghost."
The
function
of the outer
sphere
is to
"throw
back and multiply the light of the sun, like an opaque
and illuminated
wall."
It may also be described as "the skin
or shirt of the universe"
(mundicutissivetunica),keeping the in-
ternal heat generated
by the sun from being lost through
in-
definite diffusion; the theological parallel here seems a trifle
strained.
As for the distances between the heavenly
bodies,
Kepler professed to have shown (with the aid of the heliocen-
tric assumption)
that this manifested a harmonious
plan such
as previous
astronomers
had
sought
but
not found.
Con-
vinced that the cosmos must conform to aesthetic requirements
and
having,
like a typically
medieval
mind,
an essentially
classical taste in universes, he was unable to believe that the
intervals between the orbits of the six then known planets failed
to correspond
to some exact rule of proportion.
While no
simple arithmetical
ratios proved applicable,
he finally, as he
supposed,
reached
the triumphant
discovery that
"God
in
creating the universe and laying out the heavens had in view
the five regular solids of geometry, celebrated since the time of
Pythagoras and Plato, and that it was in accordance with their
properties that he fixed the number of the heavens, their pro-
portions, and the ratios of their movements."
13 In this Kepler
too, it will be observed, was in his own fashion relying upon
the principle of sufficient reason; the Creator must, he could
not doubt, have been guided by some non-arbitrary
formula in
assigning these ratios and in fixing the number
of planets as
six, and therefore of the intervals as five. There couldbe only
five regular solids; and if this necessity in the world of Ideas
could be transferred to the limitation of the number of heavens,
the general plan of things could be regarded as having in some
sort a rational basis as well as an aesthetic orderliness.
It was
in the quest of verification for this wholly fanciful hypothesis

PLE"NITUDE AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
1°7
that Kepler eventually achieved his discovery of the third law
of planetary
motion.
The Copernican doctrine, it is true, demanded
of the plain
man a difficult revision of certain natural
habits of the unre-
generate intellect -
a revision which he has never yet, in his
ordinary
mental pictures of the motions in the solar system,
succeeded in accomplishing
fully.
The new hypothesis not
only appeared
to conflict with the testimony of the senses but
contained at least a hint of the repellent notion of relativity -
i. e., of the purely relational import of the conceptions of place
and motion.
Yet to the philosophically enlightened there was
in this nothing essentially novel or heterodox.
The deceitful-
ness of the senses was a well-worn theme for edifying discourse;
and the new astronomy afforded some welcome fresh illustra-
tions for that theme, of which its seventeenth-century
advo-
cates did not fail to make use. As for the general idea of the
relativity of apparent
motion to the observer, that must, after
all, have
been a commonplace
to every astronomer;
and
Copernicanism implied no more than this. Any implication of
a more thorough-going
doctrine of the relativity
of position
and motion -
or even of determinable
position and motion -
could be avoided so long as the now unmoving sphere of the
fixed stars remained to serve as an absolute system of reference
-
in Copernicus's
own phrase, as the universilocus, ad quem
motusetpositiocaeterorumomniumconferatur
.14
The chief affront of Copernicanism to theological orthodoxy
lay, not in any fundamental
discrepancy
between it and the
more philosophical parts of the traditional
scheme of the uni-
verse, but in its apparent
irreconcilability
with certain details
of that body of purely historical propositions which Christi-
anity had, to an extent matched
in no other religion, incor-
porated in its creed.
The story of the Ascension, for example,
was obviously difficult to fit into the topography of a Coperni-
can world; and it was easy for the ecclesiastical adversaries of
the new hypothesis to point to numerous passages of Scripture
which made it evident that supposedly inspired and infallible
writers had, as a matter of course, assumed the motion of the
sun about the earth and other postulates of the astronomy of
naive common sense. Yet, with the aid of some ingenuity and

108
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
some liberality of exegesis, these embarrassments
could be, and
in time were, got over with a certain degree of plausibility;
and
in any case, it was not the merely Copernican
innovation
that
raised the more general and deeper-reaching
difficulties, even
with respect to the historical content of Christian
dogma.
The truly revolutionary
theses in cosmography which gained
ground
in the sixteenth and came to be pretty generally
ac-
cepted before the end of the seventeenth
century were five in
number,
none of them entailed
by the purely
astronomical
systems of Copernicus or Kepler.
In any study of the history of
the modern conception of the world, and in any account of the
position of any individual
writer, it is essential to keep these
distinctions
between issues constantly
in view.
The five more
significant
innovations
were:
(I)
the assumption
that
other
planets of our solar system are inhabited
by living, sentient,
and rational
creatures;
(2) the shattering
of the outer walls of
the medieval universe, whether these were identified with the
outermost crystalline sphere or with a definite"
region"
of the
fixed stars, and the dispersal of these stars through vast, irregu-
lar distances;
(3) the conception
of the fixed stars as suns
similar to ours, all. or most of them surrounded
by planetary
systems of their own; (4) the supposition
that the planets in
these other
worlds also have conscious inhabitants;
(5) the
assertion of the actual infinity of the physical universe in space
and of the number
of solar systems contained
it it.
The first of these -
and, of course, still more the fourth -
deprived human
life and terrestrial
history of the unique im-
portance
and momentousness
which the medieval
scheme of
ideas had attributed
to them and Copernicanism
had left to
them.
The theory of the plurality
of inhabited
worlds tended
to raise difficulties, not merely about the minor details of the
history included
in the Christian
belief, but about its central
dogmas.
The entire moving drama
of the Incarnation
and
Redemption
had seemed manifestly to presuppose a single in-
habited
world.
If that presupposition
were to be given up,
how were these ·dogmas to be construed,
if, indeed, they could
be retained
at all?
Were we, as Thomas
Paine
afterwards
asked, "to suppose that every world in the boundless creation

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
1°9
had an Eve, an apple, a serpent, and a Redeemer?"
15 Had
the Second Person of the Trinity
been incarnate
on innumer-
able planets in turn, or was ours the only portion of the uni-
verse in which
moral
agents had any need of redemption?
These difficulties were recognized
at least by the early seven-
teenth century,
but they do not appear to have been regarded
by the theologians
of the time as very serious.
Campanella
refers to them in his ApologiaPro Galilaeo,1622, and his views
on
the subject. were summarized
in English
by Wilkins in
1638:
If the inhabitants
of other globes were men,
then he thinks they could not be infected with Adam's sin; yet, perhaps,
they had some of their own, which might make them liable to the same mis-
ery with us; out of which, it may be, they were delivered by the same
means as we, the death of Christ."
By the second and third of these theses, the potential
im-
portance
of which for the imagination
it would be difficult to
overestimate,
the physical universe ceased to have any center;
it was broken up into (at the least) a vast multiplicity
of iso-
lated systems distributed
upon no recognizably
rational
plan;
it ceased to be a shape and became
a formless aggregate
of
worlds scattered
irregularly
through
unimaginable
reaches of
space.
The change from a geocentric to a heliocentric
system
was far less momentous
than the change from a heliocentric
to
an acentric one.
The"
first question concerning
the Celestial
Bodies," Bacon said, "is whethertherebea system,that is, whether
the world or universe
compose altogether
one globe, with a
centre; or whether
the particular
globes of earth and stars be
scattered
dispersedly,
each on its own roots, without
any sys-
tem or common centre."
17 When the number
and extension
of these worlds were further assumed to be infinite, the universe
tended to seem baffling not only to the imagination
but to the
reason itself; for the mathematical
antinomies
arising from the
application
to reality of the notion of numerical
or quantitative
infinity now assumed a new pertinence
and gravity.
I have said that the Copernican
and Keplerian
cosmical sys-
tems did not necessarily
imply these five more striking
and
far-reaching
novelties, and that the former were held by some
astronomers
and other writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries who did not accept the latter -
and viceversa. It is

110
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
not, however, historically
true that the abandonment
of the
geocentric scheme did not seem to some minds to render some
of these more
sweeping
hypotheses
more
probable.
Thus
Bacon,
who was an anti-Copernican,
though
not an alto-
gether unhesitant
one, remarked
that "if it be granted
that
the earth moves, it would seem more natural
to suppose that
there is no system at all, but scattered globes, than to constitute
a system of which the sun is the centre."
18 This, however,
Bacon seems to urge as one of the"
many and great incon-
veniencies"
which "are
found in the system of Copernicus";
it is a deduction,
and an obviously forced one, made by an
adversary of the theory.
It is true, also, that the heliocentric
picture
of our system
could be regarded
as lending a certain plausibility
to the hy-
pothesis of other inhabited
planets in that system.
By placing
the earth upon the same footing as these other bodies in one
respect, it suggested the possibility that the similarity
might
extend to other particulars,
such as the presence of conscious
life. The usual argument
may be given in the words of Burton
(162 I):
hocposito, to grant this their tenet of the earth's motion;
if the earth move
it is a planet and shines to them in the mOOD,and to other planetary in-
habitants as the moon and they do to us upon the earth;
but shine she doth,
as Galileo, Kepler, and others prove, and then perconsequens,the rest of the
planets are inhabited, as well as the mOOD.. ..
Then (I say) the earth and
they [Mars, Venus, and the rest] be planets alike, inhabited
alike, moved
about the sun, the common centre of the world alike, and it may be those
two green children which Nubrigensis speaks of in his time, that fell from
heaven came from thence.P
But such an inference was obviously a loose argument
by anal-
ogy, and could, of itself, hardly
have convinced
anyone
not
already inclined to the conclusion upon other and more cogent
grounds.
And in fact that conclusion had been reached before
Copernicus,
and
not as a deduction
from
the heliocentric
theory.
Not only were the more pregnant
and startling innovations
not dependent
upon the Copernican
theory; they were none of
them,
before the nineteenth
century,
supported
by any evi-
dence whatever that we should now call scientific; and at least

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
I I I
three of them still remain uncertain.
The second and part of
the third were not, indeed, beyond the possible scope of astro-
nomical verification;
but they could not be verified by any
methods in use for three centuries after Copernicus.
Whether
the fixed stars were grouped at approximately
equal distances
from the sun within a well-defined zone centering about that
body, or were diffused at vast intervals through
space, could
not be determined until the distance of a number of them from
the earth could be measured.
But no successful measurement
of a stellar parallax was accomplished until 1838,20and photo-
metric methods of determining
distance were unknown.
The
acceptance of the heliocentric system implied, indeed, that the
remoteness of all the stars was far greater than even the Ptole-
maic astronomers had supposed; for it was the recognition of
the earth's orbital motion that gave a base-line by means of
which it seemed that a parallax should be detectable.
Since
none could be discovered by what were then deemed highly
refined methods, it followed that the distance, and presumably
therefore
the size, of the nearest star must be incalculably
great.
But on the other hand, the repeated failures to establish
a parallax served for more than a century as plausible argu-
ments against the heliocentric system itself.
The more important
features of the new conception of the
world, then, owed little to any new hypotheses based upon the
sort of observational
grounds which we should nowadays call
'scientific.'
They were chiefly derivative from philosophical
and theological premises.
They were, in short, manifest corol-
laries of the principle of plenitude,
when that principle was
applied, not to the biological question of the number of kinds
of living beings, but to the astronomical questions of the mag-
nitude of the stellar universe and of the extent of the diffusion
of life and sentiency in space.
God, it seemed, would, in the
phrase of the Timaeus,have been "envious"
if he had refused
the privilege of actual existence to any logically possible being
at any place where such existence was possible -
if, at least,
as was sometimes conveniently,
if inconsistently, added, there
were not countervailing
reasons why their existence would
have been attended
~r a preponderance
of detriment
to other
beings. The creative power was, hr hypothesis, infinite, and its

I I 2
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
manifestation
should therefore be infinite; and there appeared
to be no reason why, wherever there was matter, there should
not be life. Now these premises, we have seen, were current
throughout
the Middle Ages, even in the writings of orthodox
theologians who were unwilling to draw from them all their
implications.
And the contention
that the infinity of worlds
and of inhabited
systems was among these implications
was
equally familiar, though usually rejected by the orthodox.
The
argument
that
the universe must be infinite because
God's
omnipotence
requires that he should not ab operecessareis dis-
cussed by Augustine in the De civitatedei (X, 5), though
it is,
of course, opposed by him.
In view of the intimate acquaint-
ance of medieval Christian
philosophers
with the writings of
Augustine, the thesis must have been familiar to all of them.
By the fifteenth century a tendency towards the acceptance of
it is already marked.
In the Or Adonai of the Jewish philoso-
pher Crescas (1410) there is offered a refutation
of the argu-
ments by which Aristotle in the De Coelothought to show that
"there
are not any other worlds" -
i. e., any other than the
one system of concentric spheres in which the earth is situated:
" Everything said in negation of the possibility of many worlds
is 'vanity
and a striving after wind.'"
Commenting
on this.
in his admirable
edition of a part of the work of Crescas, Pro-
fessor H. A. Wolfson
21 observes that
Crescas "does
not say
definitely how many worlds may exist.
He only contends for
the existence of' many worlds.'
But knowing of his rejection of
Aristotle's denial of an infinite number
of magnitudes
and of
his contention
as to the existence of an infinite space, we may
reasonably infer that the number of Crescas' many worlds may
rise to infinity."
Later in the same century the same thesis was
adumbrated
by a great Christian
metaphysician.
The Car-
dinal Nicolaus Cusanus, one of the subtlest though hardly one
of the clearest philosophical
minds of the later Middle Ages,
had transferred to the physical universe the paradoxical
figure
which theologians had sometimes employed to express the doc-
trine of the"
immensity"
of God.
The world, Cusanus de-
clared in his De doctaignorantia(1440), is a sphere of which the
"centre
coincides with the circumference."
Less paradoxi-
cally expressed,

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
I 13
The world has no circumference;
for it if had a centre and a circumfer-
ence there would be some space and some thing beyond the world, supposi-
tions which are wholly lacking in truth.
Since, therefore, it is impossible
that the world should be enclosed within a corporeal centre and a corporeal
boundary,
it is not within our power to understand
the world, whose centre
and circumference
are God.
And though
this world cannot
be infinite,
nevertheless it cannot be conceived as finite, since there are no limits within
which it could be confined.
The earth, therefore, which cannot be the cen-
tre, cannot be wholly without motion.
. . .
And just as the world has no
centre, so neither the sphere of the fixed stars nor any other is its circum-
ference.
The belief in the stationary
and central earth is due merely to
a failure to recognize the relativity of apparent
motion:
It is evident that this earth really moves, though it does not seem to do
so, for we apprehend
motion only by means of a contrast with some fixed
point.
If a man on a boat in a stream were unable to see the banks and did
not know that the stream was flowing, how would he comprehend
that the
boat was moving?
Thus it is that, whether a man is on the earth or the sun
or some other star, it will always seem to him that the position he occupies
is the motionless centre and that all other things are in motion.P
These passages were frequently
cited by seventeenth-century
writers as an anticipation
of both these theses of later writers,
which thus seemed to have the prophetic
endorsement
of a
Cardinal;
and taken by themselves they were such an anticipa-
tion.
The mind of Cusanus, however, was less concerned with
astronomical
questions than with a species of mystical theol-
ogy.
It is not the sun, but God, whom he would put in the
place of the central earth; he alone is'" the centre of the world
and of the spheres and of the earth who is at the same time the
infinite circumference
of all things."
And the rejection of the
notion of a finite universe bounded
by the sphere of the fixed
stars does not lead Cusanus to an entirely unequivocal
asser-
tion of an infinite physical world of other suns and planets
beyond those imaginary
limits, but only to the conviction
of
the unintelligibility
of the whole conception of a physical and
quantitative
world and the necessity, once more, of passing
from it to the conception of God.
While the passages did pro-
pound,
as a sort of by-product,
a new astronomical
thesis,
their essential object was to illustrate the author's favorite phi-
losophical contention,
to vindicate
that doctaignorantiawhich

I 14
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
consists in knowing
that
we do not know.
Any antinomy
which reflection
seemed to reveal served his purpose;
it was
one more welcome instance of the identity
of opposites.
And
it was precisely in order to exemplify the identity
of opposites
that
Cusanus
endeavored
to show, by whatever
arguments
came to his hand, that
the concepts of 'centre'
and'
circum-
ference,' as applied
to the universe, have no clear and distinct
meaning.
Thus,
though
one can hardly
say with Giordano
Bruno that
Cusanus
enunciated
his thesis "rather
under
his
breath"
isuppressiorevoce), for his utterance
of it was bold
enough,
it was in the end so elusively interpreted
and so sub-
ordinated
to theses of quite a different type, that it apparently
had no great influence towards
the abandonment
of the Aris-
totelian and Ptolemaic
conception
-
which, indeed, Cusanus
himself, in a later writing, continues
to employ;
the divine wis-
dom, he observes, "placed
the earth in the middle and caused
it to be heavy
and
to move at the centre
of the world."
23
This, however,
may perhaps
be supposed
to refer only to our
own system.
More concrete and unequivocal
is Cusanus's assertion of the
existence
of inhabitants
on other
globes.
He well illustrates
what we have seen in other instances, the tendency of medieval
writers
who reject
the principles
of plenitude
and
sufficient
reason
in general
terms,
to argue
unhesitatingly
from these
premises
in particular
cases.
Operatum Dei nulla est ratio, he
roundly declares:
there is no reason why the earth is the earth,
or man, man, except that he who made them so willed."
This,
of course,
logically
implied
the impossibility
of any a priori
knowledge about what exists. Yet Cusanus confidently
argues
that it is inconceivable
that"
so many spaces of the heaven and
stars should
be vacant"
as the common
view implied.
Not
only of the sun and moon, but also de aliis stellarum regionibus,
we conjecture
that none of them are without inhabitants,
but that there
are as many particular
partial worlds (partesmundiales)composing this one
universe as there are stars, which are innumerable,
unless it be to him who
created all things in number.P
The
same conclusion
follows from
the
assumption
that
all
grades
in
the
Scale
of Being
have
existence
somewhere;
"since,"
he writes, "from
God natures
of differing degrees of

PLENITUDE

nobility proceed, there are inhabitants
in every region"
of the
heavens.
"The
earth is perhaps inhabited
by lesser beings"
than dwell in other globes, though it does not seem that any-
thing nobler and more perfect than the intellectual
nature,
which is to be found here in the earth and its region, can exist.
Of the same generic nature, then, "even if of another species of
it, are the inhabitants
of the other stars."
For the rest, "they
remain wholly unknown
to us" -
though Cusanus ventures
some conjectures as to their characteristics,
drawn from those
of the globes they occupy_
The logical grounds of the new astronomy were thus among
the many elements of the modern
conception
of the world
which were carried in solution in medieval thought;
and they
were by the end of the Middle Ages already beginning to show
signs of precipitation.
By the early
sixteenth
century
the
theories
of the plurality
of solar systems and of inhabited
planets, of the infinity of the number of the stars and the in-
finite extent of the universe in space, were already common
topics of discussion.
Thus Palingenius, ten years or more be-
fore the publication
of the De revolutionibusorbium, in an im-
mensely popular
poem used in many schools as a textbook,
recorded that
Singula nonnulli credunt quoque sidera posse
Dici orbes,
and himself argued that there must be creatures in the other
regions of the heavens immeasurably
superior to man, since it
is inconceivable that"
the infinite power of God" can have ex-
hausted
itself with
the production
of so insignificant
and
wretched a being.
"Is it not blasphemous,"
asks the poet, "to
say that the heavens are a desert and rejoice in no residents,
and that God rules only over us and the beasts,
Tam paucis, et tam miseris animalibus, et tam
Ridiculis? "
"It is certain that the omnipotent
Begetter had the knowledge,
the power and the will to create better things than we are, ...
and the more things he makes, and the more noble, the more
resplendently
shines forth
the beauty
of the world and
the

I 16
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
power of deity."
26 With respect to the literal numerical
in-
finity of the stars Palingenius uses the evasion which had been
usual since Plotinus in dealing with the number of grades in the
Scale of Being:
Plurima sunt numero, ut possit comprendere
nemo.F
The whole argument
is here again an inference from the
assumed infinity of the productive potency of the First Cause to
the necessary innumerability
of the actual effects. Later in the
century, as a recent interesting discovery has shown, the Eng-
lish astronomer,
Thomas
Digges,
added
to his exposition
(largely a free translation)
of Copernicus
an assertion of the
infinity of the" orb" of the fixed stars, "garnished
with lights
innumerable
and reaching
up in Sphaericall altitude without
end."
28
No specific deduction
of this conclusion
from the
Copernican scheme of the solar system is attempted
by Digges;
the only reason given for it is that this is a suitable way of con-
ceiving of "the
glorious court of ye great
God, whose un-
sercheable works invisible we may partly by these his visible
conjecture,
to whose infinit power and maiesty such an infinit
place surmounting
all other both in quantity
and quality only
is conuenient."
29
Though
the elements of the new cosmography
had, then,
found earlier
expression in several quarters,
it is Giordano
Bruno who must be regarded as the principal representative
of
the doctrine of the decentralized,
infinite, and infinitely popu-
lous universe; for he not only preached it throughout
Western
Europe with the fervor of an evangelist, but also first gave a
thorough
statement
of the grounds on which it was to gain
acceptance
from the general public.
And while he may have
owed his interest in the question to the innovation of Coperni-
cus, whose greatness he never tired of celebrating,
it is certain \
that he was not led to his characteristic
convictions by reflec-
tion upon the implications of the Copernican
theory or by any
astronomical
observations.
Those convictions
were for him
primarily,
and almost wholly, a deduction
from the principle
of plenitude,
or from the assumption on which the latter itself
rested, the principle
of sufficient reason.
The
Timaeus, Plo-

tinus (for Bruno" the prince of philosophers "), and the School-
men, not the De revolutionibusorbium,were the chief sources of
his theory.
He may be regarded as carrying on the philosophy
of Abelard and extending the same reasonings to the field of
astronomy.
His premises are at bottom the same as those from
which Dante
argued
to the virtual
infinity of the celestial
hierarchies
and
the actualization
of all the possibilities of
being; but they are brought to bear upon the question of the
number of potential stellar systems to which the Eternal Power
must be supposed to have imparted
actual existence.
Bruno
is, in short, precisely in those features of his teaching in which
he seems most the herald and champion of a modern concep-
tion of the universe, most completely the continuer of a certain
strain in Platonistic
metaphysics
and in medieval
theology.
The "infinity
of worlds"
was, it is true, well known to have
been a thesis of Democritus and the Epicureans,
but this told
against the theory rather than in its favor; it was its deduci-
bility from much more orthodox premises than the Democritic
that assured its triumph
in the seventeenth century.
The essential character of Bruno's argument is perhaps most
clearly and concisely shown in a prose passage in the De lm-
menso,written about 1586. He here contends that the infinity
of stellar worlds in space follows directly and obviously from
principia communia,premises that everyone admits.
For it is
axiomatic that"
the divine essence is infinite";
that the meas-
ure of its potency (moduspossendi)corresponds to the measure
of its being (modusessendi),and its modusoperandi,in turn, to its
moduspossendi;that a potentiainfinita,such as is thus admittedly
possessed by the World-Ground,
cannot exist nisi sit possibile
infinitum. Equally undisputed
is it that the Absolute Being is
perfectly simple, that"
in it being, power, action, volition ...
are one and the same."
The possible and the actual, in short,
identical in God, must be coextensive in the temporal
order.
Hence an infinity of beings and of worlds must exist, in all pos-
sible modes.
"We insult the infinite cause when we say that it
may be the cause of a finite effect; to a finite effect it can have
neither
the name
nor
the relation
of an efficient cause."
Hence, more specifically, it is impossible that the quantity
of
matter should be finite, or that, beyond the traditional
bound-

I 18
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
aries of the heavens, there should be naught
but empty space
-
a yawning chasm of unrealized
possibility of being.
Of the
endlessly numerous
worlds thus demonstrated
to exist, some,
Bruno adds elsewhere,
must be even more magnificent
than
ours, with inhabitants
superior to the terrestrial
race."
In a passage in which essentially the same reasoning
is less
formally presented,
the sources of it become still more clearly
apparent
through
Bruno's repetition
of the stock phrases and
metaphors
which we have already noted in earlier writers:
Why should or how can we suppose the divine potency to be idle? Why
should we say that the divine goodness, which is capable of communicating
itself to an infinity of things and of pouring itself forth without limit, is nig-
gardly?
. . .
Why should that centre of deity which is able to expand itself
(if it may be-so expressed) into an infinite sphere, remain barren, as if it were
envious? Why should the infinite capacity
be frustrated,
the possibility of
the existence of infinite worlds be cheated, the perfection of the divine image
be impaired -
that image which ought rather
to be reflected back in a
mirror as immeasurable
as itself? ...
Why should we assert what is so full
of absurdities
and, while it in no wise promotes religion, faith, morals, or
law, is destructive of so many principles of philosophy? 31
Elsewhere
the proof is made to rest more directly
and ex-
plicitly upon the principle of sufficient reason.
If there was, as
we must suppose,
a reason
why the place occupied
by our
planet
should be filled, there was still more reason why all
other places equally capable of occupancy should be filled; and
there is nothing in the nature of space which restricts the num-
ber of such places.
In general,
"in so far as there is a reason
why some finite good, some limited perfection, should be, there
is a still greater
reason why an infinite good should be; for,
while the finite good exists because its existence is suitable and
reasonable,
the infinite good exists with absolute
necessity."
True,
the notion of "infinite
good"
can be applied
in strict-
ness only to an incorporeal
perfection;
but"
what prevents the
infinity that is implicit in the absolutely simple and undivided
First Principle
from becoming
explicit in this its infinite and
unbounded
simulacrum,
capable
of containing
innumerable
worlds?"
Not, adds Bruno here, that mere spatial extension or
physical
magnitude
has in itself any"
dignity"
whereby
.
should be in itself an expression of the perfection
of the First
Cause.
It is really because of the necessity for the realization

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
I 19
of the full Scale of Being that
there must be an infinity of
worlds to afford room for such a complete deployment
of the
possibles.
"The
excellence
of the
natures
and
corporeal
species" could not otherwise be sufficiently manifested;
"for it
is incomparably
better
that Infinite Excellence should express
itself in innumerable
individuals than in some finite number of
them. . ..
Because of the countless grades
of perfection
in
which the incorporeal
divine Excellence must needs manifest
itself in a corporeal
manner,
there must be countless individ-
uals such as are those great living beings of which our divine
mother,
the Earth,
is one."
32
With this we encounter
once more the usual argument
for
optimism.
"That
is perfect which consists of many parts, dis-
posed in a fixed sequence and closely joined together."
It is
therefore
".not permissible
to carp at the vast edifice of the
mighty Architect because there are in nature some things that
are not best, or because monsters are to be found in more than
one species.
For whatever
is small, trivial or mean serves to
complete the splendor of the whole."
There can be no "grade
of being which, in its own place in the series, is not good in rela-
tion to the whole body."
33
The deterministic
implications
of all this are clearly recog-
nized and are drawn out in much the same form as they had
been by Abelard more than four centuries before.
Since God
is immutable,
and since in him potency and act are one,
there is no contingency in his operation;
but a determinate
and certain
effect immutably follows from a determinate
and certain cause; so that he
cannot be other than he is, nor have any possibility other than that which
he has, nor will other than what he actually wills, nor do aught other than
what he does. For the distinction between the potential and the actual is
pertinent only to beings that are subject to change.s-
In the other aspects of Bruno's philosophy
we are not here
interested;
but it is perhaps
well to avert possible misunder-
standing by pointing out that it is not solely the strain in me-
dieval thought connected with the principles of plenitude
and
sufficient reason, or with the idea of the divine"
goodness,"
that is manifest in his doctrine.
While this element in the tra-
ditional
complex is.developed
freely and consistently,
certain
other· ingredients
quite
incongruous
with it are likewise re-

120
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
tained
and are equally
emphasized.
Thus, for example,
the
Brunonian
Absolute, though on the one hand essentially gen-
erative, and manifested in the multitudinous
abundance
of the
creation,
is also transcendent,
self-sufficient, indivisible,
time-
less, ineffable,
and incomprehensible,
all its attributes
being
completely
negative
to all those of the world we know, and
even, to our understandings,
self-contradictory.
The intrinsi-
cally contradictory
nature of the general medieval conception
of God, which is present but judiciously
obscured
and mini-
mized in a writer like Thomas
Aquinas,
is by Bruno ostenta-
tiously paraded;
for him, in one very characteristic
mood, the
greater the paradox,
the better the doctrine.
The one Perfect and Best Being ...
does not include itself, for it is not
greater than itself; it is not included by itself, for it is not less than itself.
. ..
It is a term in such wise that it is not a term;
it is form in such wise
that it is not form; it is matter in such wise that it is not matter.
. . .
In
its infinite duration
the hour does not differ from the day, the day from the
year, the year from the century, the century from the moment.
. . .
Thou
canst not more nearly approach to a likeness to the Infinite- by being a man
than by being an ant;
not more nearly by being a star than by being a
man;
...
for in the Infinite these distinctions are indifferent -
and what
I say of these I mean to imply of all the other distinctions whereby things
subsist as particular
entities (intendo di tutte I'altre cose di sussistenza parti-
co/are). . . . Since in it centre does not differ from circumference,
we may
safely affirm that the universe is all centre, or that the centre of the Uni-
verse is everywhere
and the circumference nowhere, in so far as it differs
from the centre; or contrariwise,
that the circumference is everywhere and
the centre nowhere."
Bruno, too, in short, had, like Plotinus and like the Schoolmen,
at least two Gods, whose properties
and functions
no mind
could conceivably reconcile.
And at times, when the strain of
these contradictions
becomes too great even for him, Bruno all
but yields to the temptation
to acosmism, which, as has been
remarked,
was never very far from any philosopher
of the
Platonistic
tradition.
"All
that constitutes
diversity,
all that
consists in generation,
corruption,
alteration
and change, is not
entity,
is not Being, but is a condition
and circumstance
of
Being, which is one, etc. . ..
Whatsoever
makes multiplicity
in things is not what is, is not the thing itself (/a cosa), but only
the appearance
in which it is represented
to the sense....
All that constitutes
difference
and number epuro accidente,e

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
121
pura figura, epura complessione,"36 All this, of course, is utterly
contrary to the side of Bruno's doctrine which has occupied us
here -
the thesis that there is in the absolute essence a real
necessity of the real existence of all possible things to the maxi-
mal possible degree of diversity.
So too in Bruno's ethics, as
illustrated,
for example, in the Eroicifurori, much of the other-
worldly or anti-naturalistic
strain persists.
He represents,
in
short, nearly all aspects of the complex of preconceptions
cur-
rent in medieval
philosophy.
But he makes the meaning
of
each of these preconceptions,
as well as the incongruity
of the
whole compound,
far clearer than ever before, by developing
each with bold and rigorous logic within its own sphere, and
with a fine indifference to any lack of harmony between it and
any of the others.
And the result, among other things, was a
supposed proof, from strictly traditional
and medieval prem-
ises, of a conclusion which meant the destruction
of the me-
dieval picture
of the physical
universe -
and therewith
of
much else that was inseparably
associated with it.
The three greatest astronomers of Bruno's own and the suc-
ceeding
generation
-
Tycho
Brahe,
Kepler,
Galileo -
all,
at least ostensibly, rejected the doctrines
both of the infinity
and the"
plurality"
of worlds; but they all more or less defi-
nitely accepted
the first of the five new theses -
i. e., that of
the plurality
of inhabited
globes within
our solar system."
Galileo in his actual belief, it is fairly certain,
inclined to the
Brunonian
view; he remarks with emphasis in the Dialogue on
the Two Principal Systems of the World that "no
one has ever
proved
that
the world is finite and of a definite
shape."
38
Nevertheless his spokesman in the dialogue formally concedes
to the Aristotelian
interlocutor
that in fact the universe "is
finite and spherical
in form and therefore
has a centre."
39
But when the question is raised whether,
assuming that there
are inhabitants
on the moon, they are like those upon
the
earth or quite dissimilar from them, Galileo clearly betrays the
influence
upon his mind of the principle
of plenitude.
We
have, he points out, no " sure observations"
to decide the mat-
ter; and the astronomer
as such cannot affirm a thing to exist
merely because it is logically possible (per una semplicenon re-

122
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
pugnanza). Yet, Galileo adds, if he is asked what his "primary
intuition
and pure natural
reason tells him as to there being
produced
upon the moon things similar to or different from
those known to us here,"
he is constrained
to answer"
that
they are entirely different
and to us wholly unimaginable";
for this appears to him"
to be required
by the richness of Na-
ture and the omnipotence
of its Creator and Governor."
40 It
was, therefore,
not because he rejected
in principle
all con-
clusions based upon considerations
of this kind that
Galileo
failed to champion
openly the larger theses which Bruno had
drawn from the same premises.
But it is to be noted that precisely these more profound in-
novations
in cosmological
ideas were well fitted to reinforce
certain
characteristic
strains in the traditional
religion.
For
example, one of the chief themes of the Christian moralist had
always been the virtue of humility.
Pride, the initial sin, first
source of all our woes, could never be sufficiently inveighed
against.
A medieval
or early modern
writer, discoursing
on
this theme, could employ a supposed cosmographical
fact (as
we have seen Montaigne
doing) to point
his moral:
man's
almost central,
and therefore
all but lowest, place in the en-
tire creation.
This astronomical
reason for humility,
as has
been already
remarked,
the new astronomy
destroyed.
But
the doctrine of the incalculable
vastness, still more that of the
infinity, of the world provided a substitute;
if man's position in
the universe was no longer peculiarly degraded,
his littleness,
at all events, was more apparent
than
ever.
To make man
thus sensible of his inexpressible unimportance,
in so far as he
was regarded
merely as a part of nature,
might well prepare
him to walk humbly with his God; and, as we shall presently
see, this adaptability
of the more extreme new theses in cos-
mography
to the uses of edification clearly did much to render
them more acceptable
in comparatively
orthodox circles in the
seventeenth
century
than they might have been expected
to
prove.
Those
who held
them
chiefly, no doubt,
on other
grounds,
did not fail to point out their value for purposes of
religious edification.
After the fifth decade of the seventeenth
century,
not only
the Copernican
but also the Brunonian
theses had the ad van-

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
123
tage of the support of the most influential philosopher of the
age.
Mindful of Galileo's condemnation,
Descartes, who had
no taste for martyrdom,
was always careful, in defending the
Copernican
system, to refer to it as a "fable"
or mere "hy-
pothesis," which, indeed, agreed with the known facts better
than any other, but need not on that account be regarded as
true; but no reader can have been in doubt either as to the
logical outcome of the philosopher's
arguments
or as to his
actual opinion,"
But Descartes showed n-oteven this cautious
reserve with respect to what might have seemed greater here-
sies, but which in fact, as he was careful to note, "the Cardinal
of Cusa and several other doctors"
had adopted
sans qu'ils
aientjamais tte repris de l'Eglise de ce sujet" 42 -
the rejection of
the enveloping sphere and the assertion of the infinity of in-
habited worlds.
For the conclusions that the fixed stars are at
varying distances from the sun and that the distance between
the nearest of them and the orbit of Saturn
is incalculably
greater than the diameter of the earth's orbit, Descartes gives
ostensibly astronomical
reasons, but even these reasons were
evidently strengthened in his mind by their congruity with the
principle of plenitude; and upon that premise chiefly rested his
further assurance of the existence of innumerable
other stars
and systems invisible to tis. It is «much more suitable to be-
lieve" this than"
to suppose that the power of the Creator is so
imperfect that no such stars can exist."
43 In short the pre-
sumption from which we must reason, where other evidence is
unavailable,
is that what, so far as we can judge, is capable of
being, is. The production of an infinity of worlds was possible
to the Creator;
and the principle 'which we must always ac-
cept in such matters is that the possibility has been realized.
We must ever keep before our eyes the infinity of the power and goodness
of God, and not fear to fall into error by imagining his works to be too great,
too fair and too perfect; on the contrary, we must take care lest, by supposing
limits (of which we have no certain knowledge) to exist [in God's works] we
may seem to be insufficiently sensible of the greatness and power of the
Creator.t'
From' these doctrines of the new cosmography Descartes drew
moral and religious lessons of a sufficiently edifying and by no
means novel sort. They furnished him, as the older theory had

124
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
furnished Montaigne,
with reasons for rejecting the anthropo-
centric
teleology with which many
theologians
had naively
flattered the pride of man.
"It
is not at all probable
that all
things have been made for us in such a way that God had no
other end in view in making them ....
We cannot doubt that
there is an infinity of things which exist now in the world, or
which formerly existed and have now ceased to be, which have
never been seen by any man or been of use to any."
45 When
Montaigne
had inveighed against"
pride," it had hardly been
from otherworldly motives; having a profound temperamental
antipathy
to everything
stilted, pretentious,
affected,
and a
penetrating
sense of the comedy of human
existence, he had
delighted in pricking the bubble of man's vanity and putting
him in his undistinguished
but not unsuitable
nor, if he will
adapt
himself to it, unenjoyable
place in nature.
Descartes,
however, uses his astronomical
conceptions
as a corrective of
our self-esteem in quite another spirit; he illustrates the under-
lying affinity, already pointed
out, between
the new cosmo-
graphical conceptions, especially in their extreme or Brunonian
form, and what was, after all, the fundamental
thing in the
traditional
religious
temper,
namely,
its otherworldliness.
Writing in 1645to the Princess Elizabeth,
he enumerates
four
principles of the understanding
which should guide us in the
conduct of life; the third of these is that the universe is infinite.
Meditation
upon this teaches us modesty and helps"
to de-
tach our affections from the things of this world."
"For
if a
man imagine that beyond the heavens there exist nothing but
imaginary spaces, and that all the heavens are made solely for
the sake of the earth, and the earth for the benefit of man, the
result is that he comes to think that this earth is our principal
dwelling-place
and this life the best that is attainable
by us;
and also that, instead of recognizing the perfections which we
really possess, he attributes
to other creatures
imperfections
which do not belong to them, in order to raise himself above
them."
46
It was probably to the vogue of Cartesianism
rather than to
any direct influence of the writings of Bruno that the rapidly
growing acceptance of the theories of the plurality and infinity
of worlds in the second half of the seventeenth
century was

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
125
chiefly due.
How completely it was possible for even learned
authors to forget the pioneers of the new cosmography and to
transfer to Descartes the whole credit for it may be seen from
Addison's
Latin oration on the new astronomy
delivered at
Oxford in 1693.
It was Descartes, said Addison, who "de-
stroyed those orbs of glass which the whims of antiquity
had
fixed above"
and "scorned
to be any longer bounded within
the straits and crystalline walls of an Aristotelic world."
47
In England Henry More became for a time the most zealous
defender of the infinity of worlds.
His adoption of the theory
apparently
owed something
to Descartes'
recent
example,
though More, steeped both in Plotinus and in the Scholastic
philosophers,
needed no other sources than these to provide
the grounds of his argument.
How simply and directly the
new conception
of the physical world could be drawn from
familiar
and orthodox
medieval
premises is as clearly illus-
trated in More's poetic version of the argument
as in Bruno's
reasonings.
If God's omnipotent,
And this omnipotent
God be everywhere,
Where'er he is, then can he eas'ly vent
His mighty virtue thorough all extent,
. . .
Unless omnipotent
power we will impair
And say that empty space his working can debar
Wherefore this precious sweet ethereall dew,
For ought we know, God each where did distil
And thorough all that hollow voidness threw,
And the wide gaping drought therewith did fill,
His endless overflowing goodness spill
In every place;
which streight he did contrive
Int' infinite severall worlds, as his best skill
Did him direct and creatures could receive:
For matter infinite needs infinite worlds must give.
The centre of each severall world's a sunne
With shining beams and kindly warming heat,
About whose radiant
crown the planets runne,
Like reeling moths about a candle light;
These all together, one world I conceit.
And that even infinite such worlds there be,
That inexhausted
Good that God is hight,
A full sufficient reason is to me,
Who simple Goodnesse make the highest Deity."

126
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
More's disciple Glanvill, restating the argument
in prose -
perhaps a less appropriate
medium -
reduces it to a sentence:
" to affirm that goodness is infinite, where what it doth and in-
tends to do is but finite," is simply" a contradiction."
But the
same conclusion can be justified on other grounds:
Yea, the Scripture affirms that which is the very strength of mine argu-
men t, oiz., that
God made all things best. . ..
It had been far more
splendid, glorious and magnificent for God to have made the universe com-
mensurate
with his own immensity,
and to have produced
effects of his
power and greatness wherever he himself is, uir., in infinite space and dura-
tion, than to have confined his omnipotence
to work only in one little spot
of an infinite inane capacity, and to begin to act but t'other day.
Thus the
late creation,
and finiteness, of the world seem to conflict with the un-
doubted
oracle of truth."
In Pascal we have the ·curious combination
of a refusal to
accept the Copernican
hypothesis with an unequivocal
asser-
tion of the Brunonian.
Between the Ptolemaic,
the Coperni-
can, and the Tychonic arrangement
of the solar system Pascal
found it impossible to decide.
All three agreed with the visible
appearances which they were designed to explain; "who, then,
can, without danger of error, support anyone
of these theories
to the prejudice of the others?"
50 Yet no man was ever more
obsessed with the thought
of the infinite magnitude
of the
world than Pascal, and none ever dilated upon it more elo-
quently.
He more than rivals Bruno in this, yet (for the most
part)
with
precisely
the opposite
motive
and
temper.
In
Bruno the idea of the infinity of things, in extent, in number,
and in diversity, gives rise to an intense aesthetic admiration
and enjoyment;
he seems to expand
emotionally
with the
magnitude
of the objects upon
which
he expatiates.
This
passes over into a mood of religious adoration;
but it is usually
an essentially cosmical piety, finding its object in the creative
energy manifested in the sensible universe.
The same is, in the
main, true of Henry More.
But to Pascal's imagination
the
vision of the infinicree
is not exhilarating
but oppressive; he,
even more than Descartes, dwells upon it because it belittles
and humiliates
man
and
baffles his understanding.
In his
knowledge
of nature -
such is the burden
of that familiar
piece of gloomy eloquence in the Pensees-
man finds only a

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
127
reason for self-abasement;
for what it chiefly shows him is " the
disproportion
between what is and what he is."
Let him look upon that resplendent
luminary set like an everlasting lamp
to lighten the universe;
let him remember
that the earth is but a speck in
comparison with the vast circuit which this star describes;
and let him then
consider with amazement
that
this circuit is itself no wider than a pin-
point beside that which is embraced
by the stars that roll in the firmament.
But if our sight stops here, let imagination
pass beyond;
wit will weary of
conceiving before nature
wearies of providing
it with objects to conceive.
The whole of this visible world is only an imperceptible
fleck in the ample
bosom of nature.
No idea of ours can approach
it.
In vain we swell our
conceptions beyond all imaginable
distances;
our minds still give birth but
to atoms, in comparison
with the reality of things.
It is an infinite sphere
of which the centre is everywhere and the circumference
nowhere.
Finally,
it is the chief sensible manifestation
of the omnipotence
of God;
let our
imagination,
then, lose itself in the thought
of it. . . .
Let man think of
himself as one who has strayed into this out-of-the-way corner of nature, and,
from this narrow
prison in which he finds himself lodged -
I mean the
universe -
let him learn to estimate
at their just value the earth,
king-
doms, cities, and himself.
What is a man, in the midst of infinityi'j!
To bring man thus to think meanly of himself is, it is true,
only one side of Pascal's purpose.
His simple rule of procedure
in dealing with a race whose self-estimates always tend to one
excess or to the other,
Pascal has told us: "s'il
se vante, je
l'abaisse;
s'il s'abaisse, je Ie vante;
et je contredis
toujours,
jusqu'a
ce qu'il comprenne
qu'il
est un monstre
incompre-
hensible."
52 Reflection upon the infinity of the physical world
is thus, ostensibly,
merely a support
for one of the opposed
theses which make the antinomy
of human nature:
"misere
et
grandeur
de l'homme."
The compensatory
consideration
is
that
of the superior
dignity
of "thought"
-
even the most
transitory
and ineffectual
thought
-
over insensible
matter,
however vast and however potent.
" All the bodies that exist,
the firmament,
the stars, the earth
and its kingdoms,
are of
less value than the least of minds; for it is aware of them, and
of itself -
while they are aware of nothing."
"By virtue of
space I am comprehended
and engulfed in the universe as a
mere point;
but by virtue
of thought
I comprehend
it."
53
Yet to stop with this would be, after all, to leave the last word
to the more cheerful side of the antinomy,
which Pascal has no
mind to do.
While"
all man's dignity lies in thought,"
and

128
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
while"
thought is in its nature
a thing admirable
and incom-
parable,"
in its actual operation
in man it is a fatuous thing:
"il fallait qu'elle efrt d'etranges
defauts pour etre meprisable ;
mais elle en a de tels que rien n'est plus ridicule."
54
And the
assumption of the infinity of the universe once more provides a
means
of abasing
man,
by showing
him the futility
of his
noblest
endowment.
The
natural
office and
aspiration
of
thought
is to understand;
but a reality that is infinite is neces-
sarily unintelligible.
"For
want of having contemplated
these
infinities, men have set forth rashly upon the investigation
of
nature, as if there were some proportion
between it and them."
But after they have once truly faced the immensity of even the
physical
world,
they must inevitably
be plunged
into "an
eternal despair of ever knowing either the beginning or the end
of things" ; they will be certain only that no assuranceetfermete,
no certain and solid knowledge, is attainable
by them through
the use of their
natural
intellectual
powers.
"This
.being
realized, men will, I think, remain at rest, each in the state in
which nature has placed him.
This middle position which has
fallen to our lot being equally removed from the two extremes
[of infinity and nonentity],
what matters it that a man should
have a little more understanding
of things?"
It is not merely,
for Pascal, that an infinite world is too big to be exhaustively
investigated
by us -
though that of itself, he declares, means
that no single part of it can be really understood,
since"
its
parts all are so related
and interlinked
with one another
that
it is impossible to know the parts without
knowing the whole
or the whole without knowing all the parts."
55 The still deeper
difficulty is that the very notion of infinite number
or magni-
tude, which we know to be truly predicable
of reality, at the
same time involves our thought
in insoluble antinomies.
"We
know that there is an infinite and we are ignorant
of its na-
ture."
Thus, "we know that it is false that numbers are finite,
therefore
it is true that a numerical
infinite exists; but we do
not know what it is. It is false that it is odd, it is false that it is
even; nevertheless,
it is a number,
and every number
is either
odd or even."
Plunged
thus into mysteries and inconceiva-
bilities
in its contemplation
of mere
nature,
the reflective
mind will be neither surprised nor rebellious when it encoun-

PLENITUDE
AND THE
NEW COSMOGRAPHY
129
ters them in religion.
God is like the physical infinite, a being
"of whom it is possible to know that he is, without
knowing
what
he is" -
except in so far as supernatural
means of at-
taining
a certain
practical
knowledge
of him are vouchsafed
to US. 56
Pascal's use of the assumption
of the world's infinity is, how-
ever, arbitrary,
not to say malicious;
he employs it when it fits
his mood and in so far as it serves his purpose
of chastening
man's pride, but he characteristically
ignores the supposition
-
common enough in his time and usually regarded as a corol-
lary of the former assumption
-
that these infinite worlds are
populated.
To a Bruno,
even to a Kepler
with
his walled
universe, the race that occupies this planet has no lack of com-
pany, though it unfortunately
possesses no means of communi-
cating with its neighbors
on other globes; and thus these and
many
other
writers
of the period
could
look out upon
the
reaches of stellar space with a cheerful sense of the ubiquity
of
conscious life and enjoyment.
But Pascal seems to conceive of
mankind
as alone in a dead infinity of matter that travels end-
lessly upon its barren
rounds, without thought
or understand-
ing, with naught
in it that is akin to man.
"L'eternel
silence
de ces espaces infinis m'effraie."
But if he had thought
other-
wise, had permitted
himself to consider seriously the implica-
tions of the theory of a plurality
of worlds, Pascal would have
been faced by difficulties to him more embarrassing
than this
feeling of solitude in the physical world,
For the intellectual
basis of the religious
convictions
in which
he found
escape
from the pessimism and scepticism which the spectacle of mere
nature
bred, lay (apart
from the argument
of the wager ) al-
most wholly in the belief in the reality of a supernatural
revela-
tion through
the history of Judaism
and Christianity
and the
documents
in which
that
history
is recorded.
That
belief
would,
for reasons
already
suggested,
have
been somewhat
difficult to adjust to the assumption
of the existence through-
out the infinity of space of countless other races of rational
and
presumably
sinful beings.
Pascal better than any other writer makes evident a certain
ironic aspect of the history of the principle of plenitude.
That
principle,
we have seen, primarily
tended
towards,
and was

I 30
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
congenial
to, what
I have called the this-worldly
type of re-
ligious feeling and moral
temper;
for it implied
the genuine
reality and the metaphysical
necessity of the sensible world; it
found in the creation
of such a world an actual
enhancement
of the divine perfection;
and it served, for century
after cen-
tury,
as the chief basis of the arguments
for optimism.
Yet
since it seemed to make the world literally
infinite,
its conse-
quences could, as has also been pointed out, easily be turned to
the service of otherworldliness;
and it was upon this possibility
of the astronomical
application
of the conception
that Pascal
seized.
Again, the principle
at bottom was, as has already ap-
peared
in numerous
instances,
the manifestation
of a kind of
rationalism;
it expressed the conviction
that there is an essen-
tial reasonableness
in the nature
of reality, a sufficient ground
in the intelligible
world for everything
that concretely
exists.
But when it was construed
as implying
the real existence of a
quantitative
or numerical
infinite,
it seemed rather
to make
reality
essentially
alien to man's
reason,
permeated
through-
out with paradoxes
and contradictions.
He who thus followed
the principle of sufficient reason to what appeared
to be its ulti-
mate
consequence,
found
his conclusion
destructive
of the
assumption
from which it had been derived.
He might thus be
easily converted
into such a pyrrhonienaccomplias made, in Pas-
cal's eyes, the most hopeful material
for a chretiensoumis.
In the last quarter
of the seventeenth
century the triumph
of
the new cosmographical
ideas was rapid;
and by the first or
second decade of the eighteenth
century
not only the Coperni-
can theory of the solar system but also the belief in other in-
habited
planets
and in the plurality
of worlds seems to have
been commonly
accepted
even in highly orthodox
circles. The
Entretiens sur la pluraliti
des mondes (1686) of Fontenelle
no
doubt did more than any other single writing
to diffuse these
ideas among
the educated
classes generally.
Of no book was
the levity of the manner
ever more incongruous
with the mag-
nitude
of the theme;
to this, no doubt,
was in great measure
due the success of the Entretiensas an oeuvrede vulgarisation. Its
vogue in England
was scarcely less than in France."
The first
English
translation
was published
within
two years,
and
a
dozen other editions of this or other versions appeared
in the

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
131
course of the following century.
Fontenelle's arguments for the
presence of "inhabitants
" (which appears
usually to mean
intelligent beings) on other bodies of our system, and for the
hypothesis that all the fixed stars are centres of systems of in-
habited
planets,
are chiefly four.
In part he relies upon a
simple argument
from analogy,
which probably
derived
its
plausibility from its approximation
to the inference from (sup-
posed) identity of cause to identity of effects.
"You
grant"
-
so he sums up this argument -
" that when two things are
like one another
in all those things that appear to you, it is
possible that they may be like one another in those things that
are not visible, if you have not some good reason to believe
otherwise."
Now this, continues
Fontenelle,
passing some-
what easily from "possible"
to "probable,"
is "the
way of
reasoning I have made use of. The moon, say I, is inhabited
because she is like the earth;
and the other planets are in-
habited because they are like the moon."
68
About the popu-
lation of the moon Fontenelle is not, in fact, altogether serious;
he recognizes that the absence of a lunar atmosphere
renders
it doubtful,
and finally adopts the theory only to please his
Marquise.
But with regard to the other planets of our system
the contention is seriously advanced, and on the same ground
it is maintained
that
the other suns probably
have planets
about them, which are the abodes of life.
This, of course, is
the argument
from analogy at its lowest level; it has no real
probative force. At times Fontenelle recognizes that this part
of his reasoning
amounts
to little more than
asking "Why
not?"
and so thrusting
the burden
of proof upon
the other
side.
The second argument
is that from the analogy of na-
ture on this planet
to probable
conditions
elsewhere.
We
see from our own observation
and from the recent disclosures
of the microscope that nature tends to crowd all matter with
life, so that "every
grain of sand"
sustains millions of living
creatures.
"Why,
then, should nature,
which is fruitful
to
excess here, be so very barren in the rest of the planets?"
This,
however, should not be assumed to be a mere multiplication
of
the same models.
"Nature
hates repetitions,"
and diversifies
her products
in each of the inhabited
worlds.
This dissimi-
larity increases with the distance, "for whosoever should see an

132
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
inhabitant
of the moon and inhabitant
of the earth would soon
perceive that they were nearer neighbors than one of the earth
and one of Saturn."
59
But the argument
rests much more heavily upon the other
two considerations,
both
already
traditional,
and
both
in
essence applications
of the principle
of sufficient reason.
The
first of these is the argument
from the irrational
wastefulness,
the
wanton
squandering
of opportunities,
which
we must
acribe to the Author of Nature,
if we accept the conclusions of
astronomy
as to the extent of the universe, and then suppose
that only a tiny fraction
of this extent is occupied
by living
things.
And there is finally the almost conclusive presumption
drawn from the theological
doctrine
of the infinity and good-
ness (in the sense of fecundity)
of the Absolute
Being from
whom all things proceed.
In short, Fontenelle
observes in his
preface, "l'idee
de la diversite infinie que la Nature
doit avoir
mis dans ses ouvrages,
regne dans tout le livre"
-
an idea
which
certainly
"cannot
be disputed
by any philosopher."
The conclusion
drawn
is, Fontenelle
grants,
only a probable
one; but it has a probability
of approximately
the same order
as that of the former existence of Alexander.
Neither is capable
of demonstrative
proof; but all that we know is favorable to the
supposition,
and there is nothing
whatever
against it.
You have all the proofs you could desire in a like matter:
the entire re-
semblance of the planets with the earth, which is inhabited, the impossibility
of conceiving any other use for which they were created, the fecundity and
magnificence of nature,
the certain regard she seems to have had to the
necessities of their inhabitants,
as in giving moons to those planets remote
from the sun.
Upon the effect of the belief in the plurality
of worlds on the
imagination
Fontenelle
touches playfully.
His .Marquise pro-
tests that the spectacle of the world which the philosopher
has
disclosed to her is "dreadful."
The philosopher
is not down-
hearted.
Dreadful, Madam,
said I; I think it very pleasant.
When the heavens
were a little blue arch, stuck with stars, methought
the universe was too
strait and close; I was almost stifled for want of air; but now it is enlarged
in height and breadth and a thousand vortexes taken in.
I begin to breathe

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
133
with more freedom, and I think the universe to be incomparably
more
magnificent than it was before."
But this, of course, is a purely aesthetic
consolation -
and
that only for those whose taste values bigness and variety more
than simplicity and intelligibility and perfection of form.
The
effect of the enlargement
of the world upon man's active na-
ture is, Fontenelle admits, depressing.
It affords a justification
for doing nothing, since it makes all human achievement seem
of infinitesimal consequence.
"We
must confess," concludes
the Marquise,
"that
we scarce know where we are, in the
midst of so many worlds; for my own part, I begin to see the
earth so fearfully little, that I believe that from henceforth
I
shall never be concerned
at all for anything.
That
we so
eagerly desire to make ourselves great,
that we are always
designing,
always troubling
and harassing
ourselves, is cer-
tainly because we are ignorant
what these vortexes are; but
now I hope my new lights will in part justify my laziness, and
when anyone reproaches
me with carelessness, I will answer,
Ah, didyou but know what thefixed stars are!"
Many Englishmen, and perhaps most English clergymen, of
the early eighteenth
century derived their general notions of
astronomy largely from William Derham's
Astro-Theology,ora
Demonstrationof theBeing and Attributesof Godfrom a Surveyof the
Heavens (I 7I5).
The book appeared
under royal patronage,
and its author was a Canon of Windsor and a Boyle Lecturer,
as well as a Fellow of the Royal Society.
It thus presumably
represented
a position officially approved by the orthodoxy of
the time, theological as well as scientific.
Derham unequivo-
cally supports
the infinitist cosmography,
which,
under
the
name of the" New System," he carefully distinguishes from the
Copernican.
It
is the same as the Copernican
as to the Systeme of the Sun and its Planets.
. . .
But then whereas the Copernican
Hypothesis supposeth the Firma-
ment of the Fixt Stars to be the Bounds of the Universe, and to be placed at
an equal Distance from its Center
the Sun; The New Systeme supposeth
that there are many other Systemes of Suns and Planets,besides that in which
we have our residence:
namely that every Fixt Star is a Sun, and encom-
passed with a Systeme of Planets, both Primary and Secondary, as well as
ours. . ..
In all probability
there are many of them [Systemes of the Uni-
verse], even as many as there are Fixt Stars, which are without number.

134
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
And Derham
holds that all the planets (including the moon)
in our own system, and all those in the infinity of other solar
systems, are "Places,
as accommodated
for Habitation,
so
stocked with proper
Inhabitants."
This"
New System"
he
thinks"
far the most rational
and probable
of any";
and his
first and chief reason for this opinion is the usual theological
one:
[This System] is far the most magnificent of any;
and worthy of an in-
finite CREATOR:
whose Power and Wisdom, as they are without
bounds and
measure, so may in all probability exert themselves in the Creation of many
Systemes, as well as one.
And as Myriads of Systemes are more for the
Glory of GOD,and more demonstrate
his Attributes, than one, so it is no less
probable than possible, there may be many besides this which we have the
Privilege of living in. 61
And the moral which is drawn from the " New System" is pre-
cisely that
which the medieval
writers
and
the early anti-
Copernicans
had drawn from the Ptolemaic:
From the consideration
of the prodigious
Magnitude
and Multitude
of
the Heavenly Bodies, and the far more noble Furniture
and Retinue which
some of them have more than we, we may learn not to overvalue this world,
not to set our hearts too much upon it, or upon any of its Riches, Honours,
or Pleasures.
For what is all our Globe but a Point, a Trifle to the Uni-
verse! a Ball not so much as visible among the greatest part of the Heavens,
namely the Fixt Stars.
And if Magnitude
or Retinue may dignify a Planet,
Saturn or Jupiter may claim the preference;
or if Proximity
to the most
magnificent
Globe of all the Systeme, to the Fountain
of Light and Heat,
to the Center, can honour and aggrandize a Planet, then Mercuryand Venus
can claim that dignity.
1£,therefore, our World be one of the inferior parts
of our Systeme, why should we inordinately
seek and desire it?62
Derham,
however, adds the pleasant
suggestion that among
the principal advantages
of" the Heavenly State"
will be im-
proved facilities for astronomical
observation -
or explora-
tion.
We are naturally
pleased with new things, we take great Pains, undergo
dangerous Voyages, to view other countries:
with great Delight we hear of
new Discoveries in the Heavens, and view these glorious Bodies with great
Pleasure through
our Glasses.
With what pleasure,
then, shall departed,
happy Souls survey the most distant Regions of the Universe, and view all
those glorious Globes thereof, and their noble Appendages,
with a nearer
View.v

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
135
Further
evidence of the currency of the same hypothesis in
the most respectable and orthodox circles by the beginning of
the eighteenth century is to be seen in Sir Richard Blackmore's
Creation (I 7I 2).
Blackmore
is one of the most ridiculed
of
eighteenth-century
poets; he had the ill luck to draw upon
himself the animosity of both Dennis and Pope, besides lesser
satirists.
Yet his Creation,which seems to most readers now one
of the most tedious of the didactic poems of an age of tedious
didactic poetry, was much admired
by many of his contem-
poraries and eighteenth-century
successors. Addison said of it
(Spectator,339): "It was undertaken
with so good an intention,
and
is executed with so great
a mastery,
it deserves to be
looked upon as one of the most useful and noble productions in
our English verse.
The reader cannot but be pleased to find
the depths
of philosophy
enlivened
with all the charms
of
poetry,
and to see so great a strength
of reason, amidst so
beautiful
a redundancy
of the imagination."
Even Dennis
described
the Creationas "a
philosophical
poem which has
equalled that of Lucretius in the beauty of its versification, and
infinitely surpassed it in the solidity and strength of its reason-
ing"; and Dr. Johnson compared it with Pope's philosophical
poems to the disadvantage
of the latter.
The Creation,then, is,
in point of vogue and contemporary
reputation,
one of the im-
portant
philosophical
poems of the century.
Blackmore
on the whole accepts the Copernican
theory,
though he seems to waver on the question a little.
But about
the plurality of worlds he has no doubts.
Yet is this mighty system, which contains
So many worlds, such vast etherial plains,
But one of thousands, which compose the whole,
Perhaps as glorious, and of worlds as full.
All these illustrious worlds, and many more
Which by the tube astronomers explore;
And millions which the world can ne'er descry
Lost in the wilds of vast immensity,
Are suns, are centers, whose superior sway
Planets of various magnitude obey. 64
And he finds it -
for pretty much the reasons which Milton

136
THE GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
forty years before had rejected -
impossible
to doubt
that
these other bodies are inhabited.
When we on faithful nature's
care reflect,
And her exhaustless energy respect,
. . .
We may pronounce each orb sustains a race
Of living things adapted
to the place ....
Were all the stars, those beauteous realms of light,
At distance only hung to shine by night,
And with their twinkling beams to please our sight? .
Are all those glorious empires made in vain?6a
The "globe
terrestrial"
is but"
a mean part"
of the whole;
of some of the others the denizens
Must this low world's inhabitants
excel.
And since to various planets they agree,
They from each other must distinguished
be
And own perfections different in degree.
The type of religious thought and feeling which the assump-
tion of the infinity of the world
and the multiplicity
of in-
habited
globes probably
chiefly tended
to produce
in the
average orthodox
and commonplace
mind in the eighteenth
century
finds perhaps
its best expression in the last book of
Young's
Night
Thoughts (Night
IX),
1745.
Few poems are
comparable
to it in the contrast between its contemporary
and
its later vogue and influence.
The Ninth Night is an offset to
the other eight; they were entitled
The Conflict, this The Con-
solation. The Ninth Part consists of Night Thoughts
in a dif-
ferent sense from the others.
Night had, in the main, been the
time congenial to Young's muse because it is sombre, appro-
priate to thoughts of death, the grave, and the other world, or
evocative of sorrowful memories.
But now night is the time
when the starry heavens are disclosed to us, when the work of
the astronomer
begins.
It is night that
sets to view
Worlds beyond number;
worlds conceal'd
by day
Behind the proud and envious star of noon.
It is, then, of a succession of religious musings upon astronomy
that the poem chiefly consists.
The theory of the infinity of worlds Young accepted,
no

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
137
doubt,
chiefly because most people by this time accepted
it;
but it also evidently
had an especial appeal
to him as a poet
and as a writer of works of religious edification.
It lent itself to
that sort of swelling, diffuse, and ejaculatory
rhetoric
which
Young and his readers loved -
to the taste which Mr. Saints-
bury indicates
when he speaks of the Night Thoughts as "an
enormous soliloquy addressed by an actor of superhuman
lung-
power to an audience
of still more superhuman
endurance."
And it suited the type of religiosity
which seeks to find the
sources of awe and reverence
and devotion
in dwelling upon
the physical bigness of the creation.
It is somewhat in the vein
of the American
preacher
who devoted a sermon to elaborat-
ing the proposition
that
God is greater
than
Niagara
Falls.
Young
was not one who expected
to find God, not in the
thunder
and the whirlwind,
but in the still, small voice.
He
seems to have believed that he might bring about the moral
reformation
of the youthful
Lorenzo
whom
he is constantly
apostrophizing
-
and whose nocturnal
employments,
he in-
timates,
were neither
astronomical
observation
nor medita-
tions among
the tombs -
by overwhelming
his imagination
with the spectacle
of the vastness of the world,
and by thus
making him sensible, sometimes of the littleness of man, some-
times of the possibilities open to him as the being capable
of
occupying
himself with thoughts
so vast.
He, also, finds a
means of abasing the human understanding,
and therefore the
better preparing
it for accepting
the "mysteries"
of Christian
theology,
in the thought
of the spatial
and physical
infinite.
There is, too, in Young the expression of a distinctly'
Roman-
tic' taste in universes -
in one sense of that equivocal
term:
Nothing can satisfy but what confounds,
Nothing but what astonishes is true.
While these seem to be some of the motives which prompt
Young
to the acceptance
of the infinitist
cosmology,
he too
justifies it argumentatively
by the same sort of reasons which
had been advanced
long before by Bruno,
and had now be-
come the stock-proof of the doctrine.
Where ends this mighty building?
Where begin
The suburbs of creation?
Where, the wall

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Whose battlements look o'er into the vale
Of non-existence,
NOTHING'S
strange abode!
Say, at what point of space JEHOVAH
dropp'd
His slacken'd line, and laid his balance by;
Weigh'd worlds and measur'd infinite, no more?
The question is a hard one, Young grants;
but it is "harder
still" to admit that the creation has an end in space.
To be-
lieve in its infinity is the more "just conjecture":
If 'tis an error, 'tis an error sprung
From noble root, high thought of the most high.
But wherefore error?
Who can prove it such? -
He that can set OMNIPOTENCE
a bound.
Can man conceive beyond what GOD can do? . . .
A thousand worlds?
There's space for millions more;
And in what space can his great fiat fail!
There is internal evidence that Young conceived himself to be'
here offering a direct poetic counterblast
to Milton's
poetic
expressions of finitism.
The existence of countless races of intelligent inhabitants
on
the other celestial systems seems to Young not less indubitable.
The argument
is largely from the usual presumption
of the
plenitude
of the creation
and the inconceivability
that
the
Author of Nature
could have wasted matter
by leaving any
great portion of it untenantable
by human beings (here, again,
there is a pretty
evident
polemic reference
to Paradise Lost,
VIII,
100-106):
Vast concave! ample dome! wast thou designed
A meet apartment
for the Deity?
Not so: that thought alone thy state impairs,
Thy lofty sinks, and shallows thy profound,
And straitens thy diffusive; dwarfs the whole,
And makes an universe an orrery . . .
. . . . . . . . For who can see
Such pomp of matter, and imagine, mind,
For which alone inanimate was made,
More sparingly dispens'd? . . .
. . . . . . . 'Tis thus the skies
Inform us of superiors numberless,
As much, in excellence, above mankind,
As above earth, in magnitude, the spheres.

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
139
There is thus, as a consequence, apparently, of a curious fusion
of literary influences and a resultant confusion of ideas, a hint
of the fanciful idea, which Kant was to elaborate
a decade
later, that there is a gradation of the types of beings in propor-
tion to their distance from the centre -
or at all events, from
the earth.
The poet takes an imaginary voyage through space,
and at the same time conceives of this as an ascent of the Scale
of Being.
I wake; and waking, climb Night's radiant scale,
From sphere to sphere; the steps by Nature set
For man's ascent; at once to tempt and aid;
To tempt his eye, and aid his tow'ring thought;
Till it arrives at the great Goal of all.
Even in the middle and late eighteenth century these cosmo-
logical doctrines were, it is to be noted, defended, by some of
the most eminent minds of the period, not at all upon observa-
tional grounds, but upon the familiar Platonistic
and Bru-
nonian premises. J. H. Lambert, for example, as a pioneer in
the determination
of stellar magnitudes
and
distances
by
photometric
methods,
holds a high place in the history of
scientific astronomy;
yet it was wholly from the principle of
plenitude
that
he confidently
concluded
(I 76I) that
other
worlds must be inhabited.
Could the world be the effect of an infinitely active Creator, unless in
every part of it life and activity, thoughts and desires, were- found in the
creatures?
Could I conceive its perfection to consist in a continuous and
inexhaustible diversification of similarities, and yet leave in it vacant places
where there were no parts of a whole which should be infinitely complete?
Such gaps I could not admit;
and I had no hesitation in filling every solar
system with habitable globes, so far as the admirable order which has been
given to their course permits. . . .
Those who still doubt or wholly deny
this are so limited in their understanding because they recognize no means
of verification except their eyes, and therefore will not hear of proofs from
general principles and of moral certainty.w
Yet even the existence of these limited intelligences, Lambert
intimates, is in keeping with the same general plan of the uni-
verse; it takes all kinds of people, even stupid ones, to make the
world complete.
The infinity of the world in space, however,
Lambert cannot admit.
In time it must be regarded as con-
tinuing in infinitum, but its spatial infinity seems to him to in-

140
THE GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
valve the inadmissible conception
of a realized infinite number.
Kant, about the same time, was arguing both for the infinite
extension of the physical universe and the infinite plurality
of
worlds on the usual Platonistic
grounds.
Since we must"
con-
ceive of the creation
as proportionate
to the power of an In-
finite Being, ...
it can have no limits at all. . ..
It would be
absurd
to represent
the Deity as bringing
into action only an
infinitely small part of his creative potency -
to think of that
reservoir of a true immensity of natures and of worlds as inactive
and shut up in an eternal
desuetude.
Is it not much
more
reasonable,
or, to express it better, is it not necessary, to repre-
sent the totality
of the creation
as it must be in order that it
may bear witness to that Power which is beyond all measure-
ment?"
67 And the philosopher
who was later to find -
as
others had done before him -
a supposedly clinching proof of
metaphysical
idealism
in the antinomies
of the spatial
and
temporal
infinite and continuum,
now disposes with a some-
what contemptuous
brevity
of such objections
to the logic of
the principle
of plenitude.
To"
the gentlemen
who, because
of the supposed impossibility
of an infinite aggregate,
without
number
and limit, find difficulty
in this idea,"
Kant
puts a
question which he seems to regard as conclusive.
The future is
admittedly
an infinite series 6f.-,changes,
The conception
of it
in its entirety must be present all at once to the divine under-
standing.
Such a concept,
therefore,
cannot
be logically im-
possible, that
is, self-contradictory.
But if the simultaneous
representation
of a successive infinity is not inherently
impos-
sible -
to a sufficiently
comprehensive
intelligence
-
how
can there
be any logical
impossibility
in the concept
of a
simultaneous
infinity,
i. e., of the
infinity
of the
world
in
space?
Since, then, the infinity of the world is possible, it is
also necessary.
Kant was here mindful of a logical dilemma which, when he
came to set forth the antinomies
in the Kritik der reinenVernunft,
he seems to have forgotten.
Even though future events, like all
others, are declared
by an idealistic
philosophy
to be purely
mental,
their number
must be either finite or infinite.
If it is
infinite,
and
if an infinite sum of particulars
is not merely
baffling to the human imagination
but "unrepresentable,"
in-

PLENITUDE
AND THE NEW COSMOGRAPHY
14 1
herently incapable of being thought together by any mind, it
follows that
there
is no cosmical intelligence
which
is ac-
quainted with all the facts that make up the total history of the
world.
Even a so-called divine mind would be incapable
of
grasping the future in its entirety; time would be too big for it.
The alternative
to this consequence of Kant's later doctrine of
the unthinkableness
and absurdity
of the numerical
infinite
would be the conception of the future arrival of a time" when
time shall be no more," the cessation, after a certain date, of all
change, process, succession, the winding-up
of the universe in
which things happen.
This would mean either an eventual
lapse of everything into sheer nonentity, or else -
what seems
a very odd and difficult conception -
the continuance,
after
that date, of an existence without dates or experienced dura-
tion, the contemplation,
by one or many timeless minds, of an
eternally
immutable
object of thought.
Kant
in his later
period ought to have been aware that this embarrassing choice
between alternative implications confronted him, since he had
himself once virtually pointed it out; but in his "solution"
of
the antinomies he appears wholly oblivious of it.
Yet Kant -
to return
to his cosmological
speculations
of the seventeen-fifties -
unlike many of his predecessors and
contemporaries
in this vein, did not feel constrained
by the
principle of plenitude
"to assert that all planets must be in-
habited"
-
though,
he hastens
to add,
"it
would
be an
absurdity to deny this with respect to all or, indeed, to most of
them."
In the abundance
of Nature, in which worlds and systems are, in com-
parison with the whole, mere motes, there may well be vacant and unin-
habited regions, which are not, strictly speaking, made serviceable to the
object of Nature, namely, the contemplation
of rational beings.
[To ques-
tion this] would be as if one were to make the wisdom of God a reason for
doubting the fact that sandy deserts occupy wide areas of the earth's sur-
face and that there are islands in the seas without human inhabitants;
for a
planet is a much smaller thing in comparison with the whole creation than
a desert or island in comparison with the earth's surface. . ..
Would it
not be rather a sign of poverty than of superabundance
in Nature, if she
were so careful to exhibit all her riches at every point in space? 68
It is, moreover, Kant observes, evident that the laws of nature
are such that life can exist only under certain physical con-

142
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
ditions; bodies on which these conditions
have not yet been
evolved will naturally
be uninhabited.
"The
excellence of the
creation loses nothing by this, since the infinite is a magnitude
which cannot be diminished
by the subtraction
of any finite
part."
Here, it will be observed, the paradoxes of the concept
of the quantitative
infinite are being turned
against an argu-
ment which for two centuries had been based upon the prin-
ciple of plenitude.
Kant, too, holding that the universe must
be infinite, and
still implying
that
the number of inhabited
worlds must be so, does not find that it follows from this that
all planets or solar systems must be the abodes of living beings,
since an infinite collection does not cease to be such when a
finite part is taken away from it.
There has been a somewhat curious paradox -in the history
of the relations
of cosmographical
ideas and moral and re-
ligious feeling in Western thought.
The habit of mind natu-
rally appropriate
to a finite and geocentric universe did not
much manifest itself in the age when the universe was actually
so conceived, but appeared
at its maximum
long after such a
conception had become, for science and philosophy, obsolete.
This incongruity
has two chief aspects.
(I)
The infinities,
spatial or temporal,
which baffle both the understanding
and
the imagination,
and to minds of a certain type, such as Pas-
cal's, make the natural
hopes and ambitions and endeavors of
men seem petty and futile, tend in themselves to breed other-
worldliness;
thought
and
will, seeking some finality
to fix
themselves upon, and finding none here, look for it elsewhere.
The profound otherworldliness
of most Indian
religious phi-
losophy is perhaps
not unrelated
to a certain
arithmetical
grandiosity
of that race's imagination,
to the tedious inter-
minableness of all the vistas which it confronts -
most of all
those in time.
But in European
thought we find the anomaly
that a metaphysical
and practical
otherworldliness
coexisted
for centuries
with a cosmological
finitism;
and that
on the
other hand, when the latter
began to be theoretically
aban-
doned, the preoccupation
of men's minds with supersensible
and supratemporal
realities also steadily diminished,
and re-
ligion itself became more and more this-worldly.

from this general difference in scale between the medieval and
the modern
cosmographies,
the medieval,
however low the
place it assigned to man in his unregenerate
state, at all events
attributed
a unique significance to terrestrial
history.
There
were no other stars upon which similar dramas, or more mo-
mentous ones, were conceivably being enacted, each in isola-
tion, and without influence upon another's
course.
The uni-
verse was at least not a many-ringed
circus.
Yet, once more,
the temper
which might have been expected to result from
such a preconception
was relatively little characteristic
of me-
dieval thought.
It was after the earth had lost its monopoly
that its inhabitants
began to find their greatest interest in the
general movement of terrestrial events, and presently came to
talk of their own actual and potential racial achievements -
though the whole of these admittedly
constituted
but a mo-
mentary episode in the endless vicissitudes of time, and had for
its scene but a tiny island in an immeasurable
and incompre-
hensible cosmos -
as if the general destiny of the universe
wholly depended upon them or should reach its consummation
in them.
It was not in the thirteenth
century but in the nine-
teenth
that homo sapiens bustled about
most self-importantly
and self-complacently
in his infinitesimal corner of the cosmic
stage.
The reasons for this paradox are, of course, to be found
in the fact that, in the later period as in the earlier, certain
associated ideas in large measure counteracted
the character-
istic tendency of the received cosmographical
presuppositions.
Into the nature of these counteracting
factors we need not here
further inquire; it is sufficient to note that certain consequences
which might naturally
have resulted from the introduction
of
the new spatio-temporal
scale and scheme of things actually
manifested themselves tardily and partially, though, as we have
seen, with some fluctuation,
and that their full repercussion is
perhaps still in the future.

v
PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
IN LEIBNIZ
AND SPINOZA
AMONG
the great philosophic systems of the seventeenth
cen-
tury, it is in that of Leibniz that the conception of the Chain of
Being is most conspicuous, most determinative,
and most per-
vasive. The essential characteristics of the universe are for him
plenitude,
continuity,
and linear gradation.
The chain con-
sists of the totality of monads, ranging in hierarchical
sequence
from God to the lowest grade of sentient life, no two alike, but
each differing from those just below and just above it in the
scale by the least possible difference.
Since the metaphysics of
Leibniz
is a form of idealism,
or, more precisely,
of pan-
psychism, the gradation
is defined primarily
in psychological
rather
than morphological
terms;
it is by the levels of con-
sciousness which severally characterize
them, the degrees of
adequacy
and clarity with which they "mirror"
or "repre-
sent"
the rest of the universe, that the monads are differenti-
ated.
Nevertheless,
the material
world also, as a phenomenon
benejundatum, the mode in which these incorporeal
entities
necessarily manifest themselves to one another, has a derivative
and
somewhat
equivocal,
but
essential,
place
in Leibniz's
scheme of things; and he habitually
employs without hesita-
tion the ordinary
language of physical realism, and discusses
the problems of physical science as genuine, not as fictitious,
problems.
And in the material world too the same three laws
hold good; and they should be used by the investigator of na-
ture as guiding
principles
in his empirical
researches.
The
best expression
of this is in a letter
of Leibniz's, usually
omitted in the editions of his collected writings, to the special
importance
of which several recent students of his philosophy
have drawn attention.'
He writes:
All the different classes of beings which taken together make up the uni-
verse are, in the ideas of God who knows distinctly their essential grad a-

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REi\SON
145
tions, only so many ordinates
of a single curve so closely united
that it
would be impossible to place others between any two of them, since that
would imply disorder
and imperfection.
Thus men are linked with the
animals, these with the plants and these with the fossils,which in turn merge
with those bodies which our senses and our imagination
represent to us as
absolutely inanimate.
And, since the law of continuity requires that when
the essential attributes
of one being approximate
those of another all the
properties of the one must likewise gradually approximate
those of the other,
it is necessary that all the orders of natural beings form but a single chain,
in which the various classes, like so many rings, are so closely linked one to
another that it is impossible for the senses or the imagination
to determine
precisely the point at which one ends and the next begins -
all the species
which, so to say, lie near to or upon the borderlands
being equivocal, and
endowed with characters which might equally well be assigned to either of
the neighboring
species. Thus there is nothing monstrous in the existence
of zoophytes, or plant-animals,
as Budaeus calls them;
on the contrary, it
is wholly in keeping with the order of nature that they should exist.
And
so great is the force of the principle of continuity,
to my thinking, that not
only should I not be surprised to hear that such beings had been discovered
-
creatures which in some of their properties, such as nutrition or reproduc-
tion, might pass equally well for animals or for plants, and which thus' over-
turn the current laws based upon the supposition of a perfect and absolute
separation of the different orders of coexistent beings which fill the universe;
-
not only, I say, should I not be surprised to hear that they had been dis-
covered, but, in fact, I am convinced that there must be such creatures, and
that natural history will perhaps some day become acquainted
with them,
when it has further studied that infinity of living things whose small size
conceals them from ordinary observation and which are hidden in the bowels
of the earth and the depths of the sea."
These,
however,
are familiar
aspects
of Leibniz's
system.
We shall in this lecture be concerned
with a more special and
somewhat
more difficult
group
of inter-connected
questions,
about
which
some differences
of interpretation
have
arisen
among those who have studied his doctrine.
These questions
are:
first, the relation
of the principle
of plenitude
to that
fundamental
theorem
in his philosophy
which
he calls the
principle
of sufficient reason;
second, the scope which he con-
sequently
gives to the principle
of plenitude;
and third -
a
question
involved
in both
the
others -
whether
he really
escapes that absolute
logical determinism
which is character-
istic of the philosophy
of Spinoza.
.
In
his formulations
of the
principle
of sufficient
reason
Leibniz is less precise and consistent than a philosopher
ought

146
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
to be, when he is dealing with a proposition
to which he as-
cribes such immense
importance
in natural
science and in
metaphysics.
Sometimes it seems to include, if not to reduce
to, the ordinary
scientific postulate of causal uniformity in na-
ture.
More frequently
it is expressed in terms which seem to
relate to final rather
than efficient causation;
and it has com-
monly been construed as an extreme assertion of a teleological
view of nature -
as equivalent
to the thesis that the existence
and properties and behavior of things are to be explained ulti-
mately by the values which they serve to realize, and that we
can discover factual truths of science by tracing
out the im-
plications of the fundamental
scheme of values which the uni-
verse expresses.
Thus Russell in his volume on Leibniz 'writes
that "the
law of sufficient reason, applied
to actual existents ..
reduces itself to the assertion of final causes."
Hence, "in order
to infer actual
existence,
whether
from another
existent,
or
from mere notions,
the notion of the good must always be
employed"
-
a doctrine which, as Russell adds, confers upon
the concept"
good"
a relation
to real existence such as no
other concept possesses."
While such a summary
of Leibniz's
meaning
can be supported
by fairly numerous
citations from
his text, it nevertheless fails to express his more fundamental
and characteristic
view on the matter, and tends to give an in-
verted conception
of the relations in his philosophy of the no-
tions of 'good'
and 'existence.'
The motive which can be
shown to have begotten
his faith in the principle
of sufficient
reason, as a cosmological generalization,
was not chiefly a de-
sire to find what is commonly meant by teleology in nature -
that
is, neat adjustments
to such ends as the comfort,
con-
venience, happiness, or edification
of man or other conscious
beings.
Leibniz was less concerned
(I do not say he was not at
all concerned)
to maintain
that
the reason for a thing is a
'good,'
in the common sense of conduciveness to the subjective
satisfaction of God or man or animal,
than to maintain
that
the thing
at all events has some reason,
that
it is logically
grounded
in something else which is logically ultimate.
For it still seemed to Leibniz, as to others of his time, highly
important,
and not necessarily impossible, to know whether or
not the existence of any world at all and the general constitu-

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
147
tion of the world that actually exists are anything
more than
colossal accidents;
whether
the universe might just as con-
ceivably never have been, or have been of quite another sort,
but simply happened
by some lucky or unlucky chance to find
itself' real and possessing the characters it has.
To all appear-
ance reality is full, not only in its minor details but also in its
more general features, of mere idiosyncrasies,
for which no
sort of explanation
can be given.
This is especially evident
when we consider the purely numerical
and quantitative
at-
tributes of the universe.
One number in the arithmetical
series
is no more sacred nor more obviously suited to existence than
another.
Is it nevertheless true that, out of all the possible
numbers
of, say, prime-atoms,
or planets, or suns, or germ-
cells, or minds, some one number, a wholly arbitrary
selection,
rose fortuitously into actual being?
Or again, are what we call
the laws of nature themselves mere whimsies of matter, which
(for a time at least) happens unaccountably
to behave with
apparent
regularity
in one manner,
out of a million others
that were, logically considered, equally open to it? There was,
of course, a familiar
element in the philosophic
heritage
of
Leibniz and his age which at once intensified this difficulty and
determined
the special form in which it presented itself. Most
non-materialistic
philosophers of the seventeenth
and eight-
eenth centuries still habitually
thought in terms of two realms
of being.
The world of essences, 'natures,'
or Platonic
Ideas,
was to 'them as indubitably
and objectively there to be reck-
oned with as the world of individual, temporal existents, physi-
calor spiritual.
The former, indeed, though it did not' exist,'
was the more fundamental
and the more solid reality of the
two." It is true that conceptualism
rather than strict Platonic
realism was the commonly accepted doctrine about the status
of the Ideas; Leibniz himself, for example, held that the realm
of essences would have no being at all, if it were not eternally
contemplated
by the mind of God.
"Every
reality must be
based upon something
existent;
if there were no God there
would be no objects of geometry."
5 Yet this did not, of course,
mean that, for the mind of man, the essences were any the less
independent
and substantial;
and even in the mind of God
every essence (including his own) had, by the prevalent though

148
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
not universal opinion, a certain logical priority over the exist-
ent or existents corresponding
to it. And in this eternal order
alone was the necessity which is identical
with complete ra-
tionality to be found; it was the locus of all ultimate reasons,
the region in which the only finally satisfying explanations
of
facts were to be sought.
An' explanation'
which simply re-
ferred one opaque fact to another -
even though the latter
were an event or existent prior in time, or one of those gen-
eralized facts which we call empirical
laws -
never touched
bottom; .6 and to assert that this was, not merely the situation
in which our limited understanding
frequently finds itself, but
also the situation
of the objective world, was, it seemed, to
proclaim the fundamental
fortuitousness of everything.
If, on
the other hand, the existence of an entity, or its properties
and behavior, could be seen to be rooted in "the
natures of
things"
-
i. e., to be implied in the very constitution
of some
essence or in the immutable
system of relations which obtains
between essences 7 -
a further quest for reasons became not
only superfluous but impossible.
The bare fact had been traced
back to a necessity, and was no longer opaque to the under-
standing;
a seeming accident of contingent existence had been
apprehended
under its eternal aspect -
that is, as consequent
upon some" eternal truth"
inherent in the Ideas, the opposite
to which would be a logical absurdity.
In the typical phraseol-
ogy of an eighteenth-century
writer:
,,'When it appears
that
an absolute necessity in the nature
of things themselves,"
as,
for example, in geometrical figures, "is the reason and ground
of their being what they are, we must necessarily stop at this
ground and reason; and to ask what is the reason of this reason
which is in the nature
of things the last of all reasons, is ab-
surd."
8
To a philosophy
which thus had constantly
before it two
planes of reality, in only one of which the reason-seeking intel-
lect of man could come to rest, the need for somehow and
somewhere finding in the realm of Ideas not merely necessary
connections
between
attributes
which
might
or might
not
'exist,'
but a determining
ground of concrete existence itself,
was naturally acute.
Unless the fact of existence could at some
point be exhibited
as a necessity subsisting in the world of

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
149
essences, the two worlds remained strangely unrelated;
there
was no bridge from one to the other; and the whole realm of
the existent appeared given over to blank unreason.
Such was
the issue in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
philosophy to
which Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason was one of several
answers.
And that principle was, we shall find, essentially a
development
and elaboration
of the theme sounded
in the
Timaeus. Leibniz himself, in a letter of 17I 5, described his own
philosophy as in part an attempt to systematize Platonism:
I have, ever since my youth, been greatly satisfied with the ethics of Plato,
and also, in a way, with his metaphysics;
these two, moreover, go together,
like mathematics and physics.
If someone should reduce Plato to a system,
he would render a great service to the human race; and it will be seen that
I have made some slight approximation
to this. 9
We shall, however, better understand
the meaning and his-
torical significance of Leibniz's answer to the question if we re-
call the nature of the others which were current in his time.
That
there must be a sufficient reason why somethingexists
rather
than nothing -
i. e., that somewhere existence is ex-
plicable as a necessity arising out of the logical system of es-
sences -
was accepted as axiomatic by many who rejected the
principle formulated
by Leibniz.
Thus Samuel Clarke, who
during the first three decades of the eighteenth century passed
for the foremost of living English philosophers, declared that
it is "an
express contradiction"
to suppose that
"of
two
equally possible things, viz. whether anythingor nothingshould
from eternity have existed, the one is determined,
rather than
the other, absolutely by nothing."
Whatever exists, in short,
must have some" cause";
and since" to have been produced
by some external cause cannot possibly be true of everything,"
there must be somewhere a being which" exists by an absolute
necessity originally in the nature of the thing itself."
And this
necessity or internal reason for being
must be antecedent;
not, indeed, in time, to the existence of the being it-
self, because that is Eternal;
but it must be antecedent in the natural order
of our ideas, to our supposition of its being; that is, this necessity must not
barely be consequentupon our supposition of the existence of such a being,
...
but it must antecedently force itself upon us, whether we will or no,
even when we are endeavoring to suppose that no such being exists....

150
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
(For) a necessity .... absolutely such in its own nature, is nothing else but its
being a plain impossibility, or implying
a contradiction,
to suppose the
contrary.P
The being whose nature
or essence is thus the necessitating
-
and therefore,
for our thought,
the explanatory
-
ground
of its existence, is, of course, God: "if anyone
asks, what sort
of Idea the Idea of that being is, the supposition
of whose non-
existence is thus an express contradiction,
I answer:
'Tis the
first and simplest idea we can possibly frame, or rather
which
(unless we forbear thinking at all) we cannot possibly extirpate
or remove out of our 'minds, of a most Simple Being, absolutely
EternalandInfinite,OriginalandIndependent." If there were not in
this case a reason determining
existence, all sorts of absurdities
would be possible;
the First Cause would be as likely to be
finite as infinite;
it might"
as possibly in other places without
any reason not exist, as it does without
any reason,
exist, in
those places where the phenomena
of nature prove that it does
exist."
11 Nay, worse; as a disciple of Clarke's
argued,
unless
there is in God's essence a sufficient reason for his existence, we
have no rational
assurance
that
he may not some day lapse
into nonentity.
It is plain and certain that any alteration of existence of a being may as
possibly be affected without a cause or reason, as the existence of that being
can either be supposed to be originally determined
without any cause or
reason, or to continue to exist without any cause or reason.
If therefore the
first cause existed originally without any cause or reason, it may be mutable
or corruptible in its nature, and so may carry within itself the cause, ground,
or reason of its ceasing to be."
These were theological
ways of saying ithat the position of a
universe in which existence was at no point grounded
in neces-
sity would be in the last degree precarious
-
such a position as
Victor Hugo long afterwards
described
with a more adequate
rhetoric:
"La
fin toujours imminente,
aucune transition
entre
etre et ne plus etre, la rentree au creuset, Ie glissement possible
a toute minute,
c'est ce precipice-lei qui est la creation."
In the case of one being,
then,
Clarke,
and
a numerous
company
of other
philosophers
and theologians
of the time,
were as averse as Spinoza or Leibniz from admitting
that exist-
ence has no determining
reason.
God's existence, at all events,

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
15 1
could not be supposed to be an accident.
It is true that many
of those who affirmed this -
and Clarke among them -
at
the
same
time
raised
somewhat
quibbling
demurrers
to
Anselm's ontological argument,
which involved the same dia-
lectic; yet there were, apparently,
only a small minority
13
who were prepared to deny that there is an ensnecessarium,i. e.,
an entity of which the essence is such that it would not be
what, qua essence, it is, if it did not also exist.
But was it sufficient to recognize only one such instance, and
to leave all the rest of the world of existents with no point of
support in the World of Ideas -
or, what was the theological
expression for the same conception, in the divine reason?
To
this question the philosophy of Spinoza (like that of Abelard
and of Bruno before him) had given an emphatic answer in the
negative.
Everyfact of existence must be held to have its roots
in the eternal
order, in the necessities belonging to essences
and their relations;
and every essence, likewise, must have its
flowering among existents.
That
the necessary actualization
of all possibles is affirmed by Spinoza also has not been evident
to all of his expositors.
With some logical implications, of his
system, and with a few of his express statements,
it seems to
conflict.
To suppose him to have accepted
the principle
of
plenitude would, it has been suggested, entail the contradiction
that all successive entities and events must exist simultaneously.
For the necessity of their existence would be a logical necessity;
and to it therefore time would be irrelevant.
We do not -
or
the mathematicians
of Spinoza's time did not -
say merely
that,
given a plane triangle,
it is necessary that its interior
angles should some day becomeequal to two right angles.
As
little could one who maintained
that the universe by logical
necessity contains all things capable
of existence admit that
some individual
things come into being after others.
But in-
dividual things do come into existence one after another;
and
we ought not to impute
to Spinoza without
clear warrant
a doctrine inconsistent with this truism.
Again, he sometimes
definitely says that we may have" ideas of non-existent modes"
i. e., of particular
objects which have no being apart from the
conceiving
intellect."
Furthermore,
he declares
that
"no
definition
involves' or expresses any particular
multitude
or

152
THE GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
definite
number
of individuals";
e. g., the definition
of a
triangle
tells us only the "nature"
of a triangle
and implies
nothing
as to the number
of triangles that exist.
Hence it is
argued that the actual particulars
which at any time make up
the universe are for Spinoza
a non-necessary,
and therefore
arbitrary,
selection from among the far more numerous things
which might have been.
But this way of interpreting
him is, I
think, quite impossible.
The principle
of sufficient reason, as
he lays it down, applies to non-existence as well as to existence:
" of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned,
alike for its existence or its non-existence."
15 And it is "the
intellect of God, in so far as it is conceived to constitute
the
divine essence," that"
is in reality the cause of all things."
16
Could there be any reason lying in the nature
of this funda-
mental
cause why some things that are capable
of existence
should not exist?
Manifestly not; there is nothing that can be
conceived, i. e., nothing
that is not self-contradictory,
which
does not"
fall under an infinite intellect."
Since, then, God
can conceive of all essences, since neither he nor the universe
would be rational if existence arbitrarily
accrued to some finite
essences while others lacked it, since" whatever we conceive to
be in the power of God necessarily exists,"
17 and since this
power is unlimited
(except by the impossibility of conceiving
or producing
the self-contradictory),
it follows that"
from the
necessity of the divine nature
must follow an infinite number
of things in infinite ways -
that is, all things which can fall
within the sphere of an infinite intellect."
18 Indeed,
Spinoza
in some passages infers the necessary existence of all possible
finite modes of each attribute
directly from the principle
of
sufficient reason, without
recourse to the argument
from the
existence of God as cause -- his existence being itself, in fact,
deduced
from the same principle.
While
the essence "tri-
angle," taken separately,
does not of itself imply the existence
of any triangles, their existence doesfollow" from the order of
the material
universe as a whole (ex ordineuniuersaenaturaecor-
poreae); for from this it must follow either that a triangle neces-
sarily exists, or else that it is impossible that it should now exist.
This is self-evident.
From which it follows that a thing neces-
sarily exists if no c.ause or reason can be given which prevents

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
153
its existence."
In other words, the class" triangles"
is one pos-
sible species of material
bodies (with respect to shape),
one
mode of" extension" ; and both the species, and any individual
of the species, will have actual existence, unless there is a "rea-
son" which renders this impossible; and such a reason would
consist solely in the fact that its existence in some manner in...
volved self-contradiction.
Similarly, God's necessary existence
can be proved simply from the fact that "no cause or reason
can be given which prevents
him from existing, or which
rules out his existence."
For it would be "absurd
to affirm of
an absolutely infinite and supremely perfect being"
that his
existence involves contradiction.P
There are thus in Spinoza
two distinct arguments
for the existence of God.
The first is
the ontological argument,
simply from the definition of causa
sui as that"
whose essence involves existence";
and this argu-
ment is applicable solely to God, since there can (it is assumed)
be only one such essence. The other is the argument from the
necessity of the existence of anythingwhose existence is not pre-
cluded by some logical impossibility; and that is applicable to
all essences, though the essence" God"
has with respect to it
one unique
advantage,
inasmuch
as (Spinoza assumes) it is
evident
that an essence defined as having the properties
of
"absolute ..infinity"
and
"perfection"
cannot
be debarred
from existence by any intrinsic or extrinsic logical impediment.
And to these two proofs correspond the two ways of deducing
the principle of plenitude:
the first indirectly, through the con-
ception
of God
whose existence
is already
independently
proved by the ontological argument,
the second directly, from
the same premise by which, in the second proof, God's own
existence is established.
It has, however, been suggested by at least one learned com-
mentator
that Spinoza affirms the principle of plenitude
only
in the sense that all conceivable things either have existed or
will hereafter exist.
But this interpretation
not only conflicts
with the truism that the logically necessary is no more so at one
time than another, but is also expressly repudiated
by Spinoza,
both in the Short Treatiseand the Ethics. Those, he declares, are
in error who contend that, "if God had created everything that
is in his intellect,"
so that there would now be nothing more

154
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
left for him to create, he could not now be said to be omnipo-
tent.
On the contrary, we must, Spinoza says, conceive"
that
God's omnipotence
has been displayed from all eternity and
will for all eternity remain in the same state of activity."
20 It
would be an absurdity to imagine that at some former time he
created a world different from that which he now creates; for
this would imply that his intellect and will were then different
from what they now are.
If his creation had at one time been
incomplete or imperfect, he would have been at some time in-
complete or imperfect -
which would be a contradiction
in
terms.
In short, there can at no time be any"
cause whereby
he could be moved to create one thing rather or more than an-
other."
Thus"
from the supreme power of God, or from his
infinite nature, an infinity of things in an infinity of modes -
that is, all things -
have necessarily flowed forth, or always
follow by the same necessity, just as from the nature of a tri-
angle it follows from all eternity
and to all eternity that the
sum of its three angles is equal to two right angles."
21 The
existence of all possible beings at all times is therefore an im-
plicate of the divine nature.
Our
principle
of plenitude -
in what
may be called its
static form -
is thus inherent
in the very substance
of Spi-
noza's
doctrine.
From
the
timeless
immutability
of the
World-Ground
he argues directly to the necessary"
fullness"
and also the necessary invariability
of the temporal
world's
contents.
But the paradox of that principle is more apparent
in his philosophy
than in others;
and it is, in part, this fact
which has led certain
expositors to the misinterpretation
to
which I have referred.
From the eternal logical necessity be-
longing to an essence there is, in truth,
no valid argument
to
any conclusion about existence in time.
For time itself is alien
to that necessity; it is an alogical character
of nature.
What-
ever is true of an essence is true of it all at once; but what is
true of the temporal world is not true of it all at once.
Becom-
ing and change, as such, simply do not fit into an eternal ra-
tionalorder.
The attempt to pass over from that order to one
in which some things have their being at one time, and quite
other things at a later time, is a non-sequitur,and worse; but
this was required
by the principle
of plenitude -
was most

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
155
clearly of all so required
when that principle was regarded
as
an implicate
of the principle
of sufficient reason.
If a literal
realization
of all genuine possibles is essential to a reasonable
world,
everything
and
everybody
should
have existed, and
every event should have occurred, from all eternity, in a totum
simul;but nature is not a totumsimul. What makes this paradox
more apparent
in Spinoza is the fact thatthe
notion of species
plays, as a rule, no such part in his system as it does in many
others
equally
committed
to the same
principle.
As fre-
quently interpreted,
the "fullness"
of the universe was suffi-
ciently realized if every kind of being was always exemplified
in the temporal
order; species, not individuals,
were the units
for which Nature
cared.
But Spinoza usually leaps at once
from the divine attributes
or the" infinite modes"
to individ-
uals existing at one time and. not at others, and in differing
numbers
at different times.
That,
in this sense, nature is not
constant,
nor constantly"
full,"
was evident;
and
Spinoza
therefore, while asserting the principle of plenitude, was driven
into inevitable and glaring inconsistencies in his application
of
it.
An increasing
realization
of this difficulty we shall find
giving rise in writers of the following century to a radical rein-
terpretation
of the principle.
Spinoza had thus expressed the principle of plenitude
in its
most uncompromising
form and had represented
it as neces-
sary in the strict logical sense. Everything
shared in the same
completely sufficient reason for being that the existence of God
was by most philosophers
conceived to possess. But Spinoza
(unlike Bruno) had not made a great deal of the aspect of the
principle
of plenitude
which was to be most fruitful of con-
sequences in the eighteenth century; what most interested him
in his own doctrine was not the consideration
that everything
that logically can be must and will be, but the consideration
that everything
that is must, by the eternal logical nature
of
things, have been, and have been precisely as it is. It was this
consequence of his dialectic, the sense of the utter inevitability
(amounting
to the ultimate inconceivability
of the opposite) of
every characteristic
and every vicissitude of human
life, that
was most congenial to his own moral temper and seemed to
him most fitted to free men from the torment
of the passions.

156
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
This universalization
of necessity rendered
teleological ways of
thinking
about things inadmissible;
since nothing
could con-
ceivably have been otherwise, nothing could be said to mani-
fest purpose or preference,
a choice of good where evil, or a
lesser good, might have been genuinely
possible; hence these
very distinctions
lost their meaning.
The alternative
view, that there is only one point at which a
reason for existence can be found in the realm of essence, was
represented
by a great body of philosophical
and theological
opinion,
both
before and after Spinoza.
According
to this
view, while there is, indeed, an ens necessarium,the being which
necessarily exists is itself a pure Will, a power to choose inde-
pendently
not only of external
causes but also of rational
mo-
tives. To make the divine will subject even to the constraint
of
reason would
be to deny its freedom and its sovereignty over
all lesser things.
Hence
the existence
of God involved
no
necessity that the world of finite beings should exist. The more
extreme and consistent form of this doctrine declared
that not
even a general tendency to create something,to share the privi-
lege of existence with other beings, could be held to belong to
the essence of deity.
This thesis had, indeed, a double historic
root.
It was primarily
a manifestation
of that apotheosis
of
irresponsible
will which constituted
one side, though only one
side, of the orthodox theology of Christendom.
It could also be
deduced from one of those two conflicting Platonic conceptions
of God which were the heritage
of what is called Christian
theology.
If the essence of deity was the same as the Idea of the
Good, if the differentiating
attribute
of the Absolute Reality
was self-sufficiency, God, even though
he did create a world,
could have no reason for doing so. Nothing in his essential na-
ture made it necessary or desirable for him to bring a universe
of imperfect beings into existence.
The creative act must there-
fore be conceived to be entirely groundless and arbitrary
in it-
self, and therefore
in its inclusions
and exclusions.
As Duns
Scotus, or a follower of his, declared,
"every
creature
has a
merely accidental
relation
to the goodness of God, since from
them
[the creatures]
nothing
is added
to his goodness,
any
more than the addition of point to a line lengthens the line."
22
Thus from medieval as well as Greek philosophy it had come

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
157
down as an axiom that nothing could be more contradictory
of
the very notion of deity than to admit
that anything
in the
existence of such a being is dependent
upon,
or in any de-
gree affected for better
or worse by, the existence
or action
of any being conceived as distinct from it.
Perhaps
the most
extraordinary
triumph of self-contradiction,
among many such
triumphs
in the history of human
thought,
was the fusion of
this conception
of a self-absorbed and self-contained
Perfection
-
of that Eternal
Introvert
who is the God of Aristotle -
at
once with the Jewish
conception
of a temporal
Creator
and
busy interposing
Power making for righteousness
through
the
hurly-burly
of history, and with primitive
Christianity's
con-
ception
of a God whose essence is forthgoing
love and who
shares in all the griefs of his creatures."
When applied to the
notion
of creation -
which
is the aspect of this syncretism
which here concerns us -
the doctrine
of the self-sufficiency
of deity implied, as we have already seen, that from the divine
-
that
is, from
the final and
absolute -
point
of view a
created world is a groundlesssuperfluity.
The existence of crea-
tures, as Augustine
had said, "is a good which could in no
way profit God";
and therefore,
he had added,
the question
why God chose to create is a self-contradictory
as well as im-
pious one, since it seeks for a cause for that
primary
act of
sheer will which is the cause of all other things
24 -
except cer-
tain other acts of sheer will permitted
certain of the creatures.
For Augustine,
and
a long line of successors, the Platonic-
Aristotelian
conception
of the self-sufficiency of deity thus be-
came an essential safeguard
against the doctrine
of universal
necessity.
If the world-generating
act had been determined
by
any motive, had had any ground even in the divine essence, it
would not have been free; but since any action of a being al-
ready self-sufficing must be absolutely
unmotivated,
its free-
dom could not be doubted.
The connection
of the two ideas
was summed up by Augustine in a neat sorites which played a
great part in European
thought
for many centuries:
ubi nulla
indigentia,nulla necessitas;ubi nullusdefeetus,nulla indigentia;nul/us
autem defectusin Deo; ergonulla necessitas.ts
Two potent elements in the philosophical
tradition,
then -
the Platonic
and Aristotelian
apotheosis of self-sufficiency and

I 58
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the Augustinian
insistence upon the primacy of will in the con-
stitution of reality -
both alike could be construed
as imply-
ing that the being which necessarily
exists, though
it has in
fact generated
other beings, did so by an essentially motiveless,
unaccountable,
and therefore
accidental
-
and, indeed,
in-
congruous -
exercise 'of its freedom.
Upon this theorem
the
changes are rung interminably
by seventeenth- and eighteenth-
century
philosophers
and divines.
Descartes
is especially in-
sistent upon it: God must have been tout-a-fait indifferentacrier
les ehosesqu'it a criies.
For if some reason, or some appearance
of good, had preceded his pre-
ordination of things, it would without doubt have determined him to create
what was best; but, on the contrary,
because he determined
to make the
things that are actually in the world, for this reason they are, as it is writ-
ten in Genesis, 'very good';
that is, the reason of their goodness depends
, upon the fact that he willed to make them. 26
For Descartes
this dependence
of things upon
the Absolute
Will extended,
not merely to their existence, but to their es-
sences or 'natures.'
There is nothing in the essence' triangle'
which makes it intrinsically
necessary that the sum of the in-
terior
angles of such a figure should
be equal
to two right
angles, nothing
in the nature
of number
which requires
that
two and two should make four.
What to us appear as "eternal
truths"
are in reality"
determined
solely by the will of God,
who, as sovereign legislator, has ordained
and established them
from all eternity."
27
So far, at least, as existence is concerned
this same conse-
quence is deduced from the Platonic premise in the chief classic
of orthodox
Anglican
divinity.
Bishop Pearson's Expositionof
the Creed(1659) declares that
God is in respect of all external actions absolutely free without the least
necessity. . ..
Those creatures
which are endued
with understanding,
and consequently with a will, may not only be necessitated in their actions
by a greater power, hut also as necessarilyhe determinedhy theproposaloj an in-
finite good; whereas neitherof these necessities can be acknowledged in God's
actions, without supposing a power beside and above Omnipotency,
or a
real happiness beside and above All-Sufficiency.
Indeed,
if God were a
necessary agent in the works of creation, the creatures would be of as neces-
sary being as he is; whereas the necessity of being is the undoubted
prerog-
ative of the First Cause. 28

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
159
This was equivalent
to saying that the only way of escape
from such a philosophy as Spinoza's -
then still to be pub-
lished -
lay in holding that God had no reason in his creative
activity and could not possibly derive any satisfaction from it.
The expressions of this theme in philosophic
or religious
poetry sometimes sound like echoes of classical passages setting
forth the Epicurean
conception of the"
careless gods";
when
Ronsard,
for example,
hymns the"
goddess Eternity"
in a
strange mixture
of pagan and Christian
imagery,
one is re-
minded as much of Lucretius as of Aristotle.
La premiere des Dieux, ou bien loin de souci
Et de l'humain
travail qui nous tourmente
ici,
Par toi-meme contente et par toi bienheureuse,
Tu regnes immortelle en tout bien plantureuse.P
But when Drummond
of Hawthornden
rewrote
Ronsard's
hymn in English and converted it into a finer and more con-
sistent piece of Christian
Platonism, he retained
this passage,
but elaborated it and gave it further point, by bringing the no-
tion of self-sufficiency into conjunction with that of creation:
No joy, no, nor perfection to Thee came
By the contriving of this world's great frame;
Ere sun, moon, stars, began their restless race,
Ere paint'd with purple clouds. was Heaven's round face,
Ere air had clouds, ere clouds weept down their showers,
Ere Sea embraced Earth, ere Earth bore flowers,
Thou happy lived; World nought to Thee supplied.
All in Thy self Thy self Thou satisfied."
The question, disapproved by Augustine, to which such a con-
ception nevertheless perennially gave rise," was pointedly ex-
pressed by a late seventeenth-century
Platonist, John Norris:
since God is
...
In himself compendiously blest, ...
. . . Is one unmov'd self-center'd Point of Rest,
Why, then, if full of bliss that ne'er could cloy,
Would he do ought but still enjoy?
Why not indulge his self-sufficing state,
Live to Himself at large, calm and secure,
A wise eternal Epicure?

160
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Why six days work, to frame
A monument of praise and fame
To him whose bliss is still the same?
What need the wealthy coin, or he that's blest, create?32
Milton in this matter,
as in others, is an interesting
example
of a mind beset by cross-currents;
but in the main it was to-
wards the assertion of the arbitrariness
of the deity's
action
that the poet-theologian
tended.
He rejects at times the ex-
treme
nominalistic
doctrine
of Descartes;
the
essences
of
things,
and
the truths
concerning
the intrinsic
relations
of
essences, are logically prior to any will, so that
not even God
could alter them;
thus he declared
in the Treatiseoj Christian
Doctrinethat"
a certain
immutable
and internal
necessity of
acting right, independently
of all extraneous
influence what-
ever, may exist in God conjointly with the most perfect liberty,
both which principles
in the divine nature
tend to the same
point."
Yet this, Milton evidently felt, inclined
too much to
determinism;
for a little later he asserted virtually the opposite:
it cannot be " admitted
that the actions of God are themselves
necessary, but only that he has a necessary existence, for Scrip-
ture itself testifies that his decrees and therefore his actions, of
what kind soever they be, are perfectly free."
33 And the con-
sideration
of the divine self-sufficiency leads Milton
to give
especial emphasis to the motivelessness of the deity's exercise of
his creative power.
God is not inherently'
good,' in the theo-
logical sense in which goodness consists in the actual conferring
of existence upon other beings.
His" goodness was free to act
or not."
34 "Questionless,"
we are told in the ChristianDoc-
trine,
it was in God's power consistently with the perfection of his own essence not
to have begotten the Son, inasmuch as generation does not pertain to the
essence of Deity, who stands in no need of propagationr"
-
an observation
repeated
in ParadiseLost:
No need that Thou
Shouldst propagate, already infinite,
And through all numbers absolute, though One.
The implication
of this, that there appeared
to be in the na-
ture of things not only no reason why any world of imperfect

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
161
creatures should exist, but every reason why it should not exist,
Adam almost makes explicit, when briefly expounding
some
poin ts of theology to his Maker:
Thou in Thyself art perfect and in Thee
Is no deficience found;
. . .
Thou in Thy secrecy although alone,
Best with Thyself accompanied, seek'st not
Social communication."
Though this may seem a somewhat odd thing for Adam to say
under the circumstances,
it proves to have, in the poem, some
dramatic
motivation;
for this proleptic
quotation
from Aris-
totle 37 serves the human interlocutor
as a polite opening for a
reminder
that he is not himself self-sufficient, and therefore
needs a companion
in Eden.
But what is clearest about the
passage is that Milton the theologian saw in this juncture
of his
narrative
an opportunity
to affirm once again
that
a self-
absorbed and unproductive
God would be not less, but, if pos-
sible, more divine, and that there is no necessity and, indeed,
no reason for the existence of any creature.
Milton's zeal for
this. thesis is the more curious because his theology here seems
out of harmony
with his ethical creed and moral ternper.i"
As recent writers have pointed out, he was no Puritan rigorist,
but in many respects a typical mind of the humanistic Renais-
sance, delighting in the splendor and diversity of the sensible
world; and the excellence of man did not for him consist in the
imitation of God in respect of the most distinctive of the divine
attributes.
It is not by an attempt
to approximate
or to be-
come absorbed into the divine sufficiency through ascetic self-
discipline, the cultivation of a contemptusmundi,or a withdrawal
from those
Rela tions dear and all the charities
Of father, son, and brother,
that man attains his good.
"Propagation,"
indeed, was the
first of duties imposed upon man by a deity himself repre-
sented as only tardily, unessentially, and (relatively to his pos-
sibilities) meagrely propagative:
OUf Maker bids increase, who bids abstain
But our Destroyer, foe to God and man?

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
. . . . . Man by number is to manifest
His single imperfection,
and beget
Like of his like, his image multiplied,
In unity defective, which requires
Collateral love and dearest amity.P
There were thus in the thought of Milton some significant and
instructive
internal
strains, characteristic
not only of the man
but of the historic juncture
in which he lived.
But our present
concern is only with one element in this complex of mutually
counter-working
ideas.
A generation
later Fenelon was with equal zeal elaborating
upon the same ancient theme -
now with Spinoza definitely
in mind as the chief representative
of the error to be attacked.
No doubt, the Archbishop
of Cambrai
grants, it may be said to
be "plus parfait aun etre d'etre fecond que de ne l'etre pas";
but it does not follow that the divine perfection
requires "an
actual
production."
The possession of a power is sufficient
without
the exercise of it -
a strange proposition,
but one to
which Fenelon was driven as the only escape from Spinoza's
argument
that an omnipotent
being must also of necessity be
omnificent.
This
theological
paradox
was apparently
ren-
dered more plausible to Fenelon by the undeniable
truth that,
though
the gift of speech presumably
makes human
beings
"more perfect,"
their perfection is not necessarily proportional
to their use of that faculty: "il arrive me me souvent que je sois
plus parfait de me taire que de parler."
There is, then, nothing
on the side of the divine essence which necessitates the genera-
tion of everything,
or even of anything:
"nothing
is more false
than to say that God was obliged by that order which is himself
to produce all that he could that is most perfect."
As little can
it be said that there is anything on the side of the finite essences
which could constitute
a reason for their being:
If God considers the essences of things, he finds therein no determination
to existence;
he finds only that they are not impossible to his power ....
Thus it is in his positive will that he finds their existence;
for as to their
essence, it contains in itself no reason or cause of existing; on the contrary,
it necessarily contains in itself non-existence.t?
Any other view than this would make" the creature essential to
the Creator,"
an indispensable
part or aspect of his being.
He

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
163
would" produce eternally and of necessity," and so would have
no freedom -
and no long ante-mundane
sabbath;
and the
ensperfectissimumwould be, not a God above the world in his
eternal and absolute self-sufficiency, but the total collection of
finite beings conceived as the expression of this fundamental
generative
necessity."
These reasonings of a priori theology were doubtless some-
what elusive to many minds even in the seventeenth and the
early eighteenth century; but the same conclusion could be de-
fended on more empirical grounds.
It could be argued that -
whether
or not there be any inherent
disposition to create in
the divine essence -
at all events the actual scope and specific
contents of the created world give evidence of the arbitrariness
of the choice of its Author.
Samuel Clarke, for example, de-
velops at some length the contention that the universe is full of
facts which cannot
be reconciled
with Spinoza's
doctrine -
i. e., which are not' necessary'
in the sense required.
All things in the world appear plainly to be the most arbitrary
that can
be imagined.
. . .
Motion itself, and all its quantities and directions, with
the laws of gravitation,
are entirely arbitrary,
and might possibly have been
altogether different from what they are now.
The number and motion of
the heavenly bodies have no manner of necessity in the nature of the things
themselves. . . .
Everything
upon the Earth is still more evidently arbi-
trary, and plainly the product,
not of necessity but will.
What absolute
necessity for just such a num-ber of species of animals or plants? 42
In such a doctrine, obviously, the principle of plenitude had
no proper place (though sometimes, asby Archbishop
King,
the two were inconsistently combined).
That principle ostensi-
bly gave certain important
a prioriknowledge about the con-
stitution of the world of existents, though it was supposed to be
also capable of empirical confirmation.
But the anti-rational-
istic theology which insisted upon the arbitrariness
of the di-
vine decrees had affinities rather
with scientific empiricism.
Since such matters as the number of species, the continuity
or
discontinuity of the differences between them, the quantity and
original distribution
of matter,
the existence or non-existence
of vacua, are purely arbitrary,
the facts respecting them must
be ascertained
through experience or remain unknown.
It was therefore
natural
that
the philosophic
poets who

164
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
dwelt with predilection upon the divine absoluteness and free-
dom from even rational constraint
should reject the principle
of plenitude
and its implications.
Drummond
of Hawthorn-
den, for example, is at pains to declare explicitly that there is
an Infinite number of Ideas which never are actualized,
since
God does not so choose; in the Hymn to theFairestFair Truth is
pictured
as standing
before the throne of Heaven
holding a
mirror
Where shineth all that was,
That is, or shall be; here, ere ought was wrought,
Thou knew all that Thy pow'r with Time forth-brought,
And more, things numberless that Thou couldst make,
That actually shall never being take.
Milton likewise seems to have been as antipathetic
to the
principle of plenitude as to that of sufficient reason, and makes
no use of it for his theodicy, either in ParadiseLost or in the
Treatiseof ChristianDoctrine. The notion of a hierarchical
scale
of nature is, indeed, not lacking, and the law of continuity
is
clearly expressed.
All things are composed of
One first matter all,
Indu'd with various forms, various degrees
Of substance, and in things that live, of life;
But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure,
As nearer to him plac'd, or nearer tending,
Each in their several active spheres assign'd,
Till body up to spirit work in bounds
Proportion'd
to each kind ....
43
. . . . Flowers and their fruit,
Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,
To vital spirits aspire, to animal,
To intellectual, give both life and sense,
Fancy and understanding,
whence the soul
Reason receives.v'
There are passages in which the poet dilates upon the magni-
tude and variety of the sensible world; and in the prose treatise
he repeats without qualification
the pregnant scholastic maxim
that"
entity is good, non-entity
not good."
46 But the general
view which he adopted forbade him to suppose that all possible
forms necessarily exist or even tend to exist.
On the contrary,
the original act of creation was not merely belated but also ex-

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
165
tremely restricted.
How little the dialectic
of the idea of
plenitude determined Milton's scheme of things is most clearly
shown by his adoption of the doctrine of Jerome and of Origen
-
which Thomas Aquinas and Dante had expressly rejected
46
-
according
to which the creation was at first confined to
"heavenly
essences," spiritual or ethereal natures.
It was only
after the disappointing
behavior of many of this highest order
of possible creatures that the Supreme Being (whose self-suf-
ficiency here seems quite completely forgotten),
by second in-
tention, bethought himself of the possibility of" repairing that
detriment"
by the creation of" another world," including the
earth and man and its other inhabitants
-
in other words, by
calling into being a certain number
of possibles of a lower
order;"
In the next generation the principle of plenitude was more
explicitly assailed in stodgy verse by Blackmore in his Creation
(1712):
Might not other animals arise
Of diff'rent figure and of diff'rent size?
In the wide womb of possibility
Lie many things which ne'er may actual be:
And more productions of a various kind
Will cause no contradiction in the mind ....
These shifting scenes, these quick rotations show
Things from necessity could never flow,
But must to mind and choice precarious beings owe.48
It is, then, chiefly in its connection with these preoccupa-
tions of Leibniz's predecessors and contemporaries,
and with
their conflicting doctrines concerning the relation of the world
of finite existents to the logical order of essences constituting
the primary object of the divine intellect, that his principle of
sufficient reason is historically to be understood.
The principle
was, first of all, an affirmation of the fundamental
proposition
common to Spinoza and to most of those who in nearly all
other respects were in complete disagreement
with that phi-
losopher -
the proposition
that there is at least one being
whose essence necessarily and directly implies existence. The
ontological argument, in short, is for Leibniz a part of the law
of sufficient reason -
a fact well recognized in the eighteenth

166
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
century.
It is because that law is valid that we are entitled
to
ask, as the first question
in metaphysics
(in distinction
from
physical
science):
"Why
does something
exist rather
than
nothing?
For' nothing'
is simpler and easier than something."
Now this sufficient reason of the existence of the universe cannot be
found in the series of contingent truths.
. . .
The sufficient reason which
has no need of any other reason must be outside the sequence of contingent
things, and must be a necessary being, else we should not have a sufficient
reason with which we could stop.49
Here, then, the" sufficient reason"
is nothing less than a logi-
cal necessity believed to be inherent in an essence; it is specifi-
cally in this sense that Leibniz
speaks of God as the ultima
ratiorerum.
But the principle further
means for Leibniz that the exist-
ence of all finite things
must
likewise in some manner
be
grounded
in the rational
order
of Ideas and their implica-
tions -
in the world of possibles which, as it was commonly
phrased, God had present to him"
before the creation."
Here
Leibniz is still at one with Spinoza, who, he observes, was en-
tirely right in opposing those philosophers who" declared that
God is indifferent and that he decrees things by an absolute act
of will."
60
If there were so much as a single fact in nature
which had its cause in a fiat not wholly determined
by ra-
tional grounds, the world would eo ipso be an affair of " blind
chance."
51 And chance becomes no more satisfactory to the
philosopher
as a category for describing the ultimate constitu-
tion of reality by being piously called God.
The supposition,
exemplified in so many of Leibniz's
contemporaries,
that the
number of existents in general, or of the members of any given
class of them -
of atoms, or of monads,
or (what was the
purely theological form of the same difficulty) of the elect -
constitutes a small selection from among the possibles, is not,
to Leibniz,
rendered
less obnoxious
by the supposition
of a
Selector, if his foible for that particular
numeral is assumed to
be itself fortuitous,
a reasonless eccentricity
of Omnipotence.
If the will of God did not have for a rule the principle of the best, it would
either tend towards evil, which would be worst of all; or else it would be in
some fashion indifferent to good and evil and guided by chance.
But a will
which always allowed itself to act by chance would scarcely be of more

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
167
value for the government of the universe than a fortuitous concourse of atoms,
with no God at all. And even if God should abandon himself to chance only
in some cases and some respects, ...
he would be imperfect, as would the
object of his choice; he would not deserve to be wholly trusted;
he would
act withou t reason in those cases, and the government of the universe would
be like certain games, half a matter of chance, half of reason. 62
In all this Leibniz was continuing
the tradition
of Platonistic
rationalism in theology which during the previous half-century
had been best represented
by the Cambridge
Platonists,
to
whose doctrine
his own is also in many
other
points very
similar.
Henry More, for example, had written in 1647:
If God do all things simply at his pleasure,
Because he will, and not because it's good,
So that his actions will have no set measure,
Is 't possible it should be understood
What he intends? . . .
Nor of well-being, nor of subsistency
Of our poor souls when they do hence depart,
Can any be assur'd, if liberty
We give to such odd thoughts, that thus pervert
The laws of God, and rashly do assert
That will rules God, but Good rules not God's will. 63
Why anyone should think it an enhancement
of the dignity
of either God or man to act, or even to be capable of acting,
without
a determining
reason, is to Leibniz;: as it was to his
Platonistic precursors, wholly incomprehensible;
"it is a para-
dox to represent as a perfection the least reasonable thing in all
the world,
of which the advantage
would consist in being
privileged
against reason."
Such a character
as Clarke and
King had ascribed to the First Cause might perhaps be attrib-
uted by a poet to "some imaginary
Don Juan,"
or, conceiv-
ably, some" hommeromanesquemight affect the appearance
of it
and even persuade
himself that he actually
possesses it; but
there never will be found in nature any choice to which one is
not brought by an antecedent
representation
of good and bad,
by inclinations or by reasons."
54 The freedom of indifference,
in short,
"is impossible,
but if there were such a thing,
it
would be harmful."
If we leave for a moment the question of the meaning of this
aspect of the principle of sufficient reason for Leibniz, and con-

168
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
sider the grounds of his faith in it, they appear,
as in the pas-
sage last cited, to be chiefly two.
Partly, he presents it as a sort
of axiomatic
proposition
in psychology:
just as all physical
events must have efficient causes, so all conscious choices must
have motivating
reasons; and these reasons must lie in the ap-
parent values inherent in the objects chosen.
This proposition,
then, is for Leibniz an "eternal
truth"
; " a power of determin-
ing oneself without any cause, or any source of determination,
implies contradiction.
. ..
It is metaphysically
necessary that
there be some such cause."
66
But at bottom
Leibniz,
like
More, adopts
the principle,
it is evident,
for reasons which
may, in one sense of a highly ambiguous term, be called prag-
matic.
The conception of the world we live in which would fol-
low from the rejection of the principle was intolerable to such a
mind as his.
It meant placing Caprice on the throne of the
universe -
under however venerable
a title.
It implied that
Nature,
having no determining
reason in it, flouts and baffles
the reason that is in man.
A world where chance-happening
had so much as a foothold would have no stability or trust-
worthiness; uncertainty
would infect the whole; anything
(ex-
cept, perhaps, the self-contradictory)
might exist and anything
might happen,
and no one thing would be in itself even more
probable than any other.
Such a hypothesis was not one which
Leibniz could entertain
if any alternative
was available;
and
the principle
of sufficient reason would unquestionably
have
seemed to him a practically
indispensable
postulate if he had
not believed it to be a logically necessary truth. 66
There was, however, it may be noted in passing, one rather
awkward
consequence
of the proposition
that .God can do
nothing without a reason.
This difficulty Samuel Clarke effec-
tively pressed home in his controversy
with Leibniz.
The
celebrated
ass of Buridan,
being, by hypothesis,
a perfectly
rational
ass, was unable to choose between two equally large
and equally appetizing
bales of hay equidistant
from his nose;
having no sufficient reason for preferring one to the other, the
sagacious
animal
starved
to death
in the midst
of plenty.
Clarke pointed out, in substance, that Leibniz attributed
to his
Maker precisely such an irrational
excess of rationality.
There
presumably
confront
even
omnipotence,
Clarke
suggested,

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
169
some situations in which it is desirable to choose one or the
other of two alternatives, though there is no reason why one
should be chosen rather than the other.
In these situations,
then, such a deity as Leibniz had set up would never be able to
act at all.
Leibniz was unable to deny that, if there are any
such situations, this consequence must follow from his premises,
'Tis a thing indifferent to place three bodies, equal and perfectly alike,
in any order whatsoever; and consequently they neverwill heplacedin any
orderby Him who does nothing without wisdom.
But Leibniz adds that there cannot be, in any possible world,
such a perfect balance of values between any two alternatives. 57
This assertion was manifestly difficult to prove and, on the face
of it, highly improbable.
Leibniz was involved in this em-
barrassment
by that excessively simple and quasi-mechanical
conception of volition, which, as we have seen, was one of the
senses which the principle of sufficient reason had for him.
Where there was no preponderance
of value in one contem-
plated object rather than another, an intelligent agent would
be as powerless to move as a piece of matter in an equilibrium
of forces. But this was not the significant essence of the prin-
ciple.
Leibniz might with advantage
have limited it to the
proposition that where there is an actual difference between
possibles, that which by its own nature has the greater reason
for existing must necessarily be created by God.
Thus far Leibniz's argument seems to place him on the side
of Spinoza, as against the critics of that philosopher.
The
primary being exists by a logical necessity; it is also necessary
that all the things derivative from it should have" reasons" for
existence lying in its nature and in their own; and this might
seem to mean that all things follow ex necessitatedivinaenaturae,
and that the existent universe isjust 'such a system as Spinoza
had represented -
logically inevitable in its least detail, so
that no alternative could ever have been so much as conceived
by an infinite intellect.
From this consequence,
however,
Leibniz professed to have found a way of escape.
Tempera-
mentally wishful, like many other philosophers, to eat his cake
and have it too, he conceived that his position was as effectu-
ally differentiated from Spinoza's cosmic determinism as from

170
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the theory -
whether in its theological or in its naturalistic
or
Epicurean
form -
of a chance-world;
and the original and.
distinctive thing in his formulation
of the principle of sufficient
reason seemed to him to consist precisely in its indication of a
third possible view opposed to both these extremes.
His attempted
differentiation
of his position from Spinoza's
rested upon
two points.
(a) In Spinoza,
the divine reason
allowed the divine will no option, and, indeed, there was no
distinction
between
them.
Such a view seemed to Leibniz
objectionable,
partly for reasons similar to those indicated
in
passages already cited from other writers.
He too, at least at
times, desired a God who might be said to possess a will, and
not merely an intellect consisting in an infinity of automatically
self-realizing essences; and to him too Spinoza's
metaphysics
appeared
to exclude the possibility of any moral philosophy.
But he had also a special reason of his own for rejecting this
feature of Spinozism -
a reason which at the same time, as he
thought,
showed the solution of the difficulty.
Spinoza had,
Leibniz observes, failed to see that existence must be limited
not only to the possible, in the logical sense, but also to the
compossible; i. e., that any actual world must be made up of
entities which, besides being consistent with themselves, are
also compatible with one another.
And although, in the world
of essences, all simple, positive' natures'
find a place without
conflict, when the world of concrete existents is considered not
all combinations
are possible.
Essences, therefore, conceived
as materials for translation into existence, come in sets, each set
excluding some essences, but including all that form one com-
possible group.
When this is borne in mind, Leibniz argues, it
becomes apparent
that there not only may but must have been
a selection, namely, of one of those sets, and therewith the ex-
clusion of all that did not belong to it, before any world of con-
crete existents could arise at all; in theological terms, that the
divine Reason before the creation was confronted with a multi-
tude -
in fact, as Leibniz tells us, with an infinite number -
of models of worlds, anyone,
but only one, of which could con-
ceivably be created.
An act of choice is thus seen to be a logi-
cally necessary implicate of the very idea of an existent world.
It seems to follow that the principle of plenitude does not hold

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
171
for Leibniz in the same absolute sense as for Spinoza:
"the
question utrum detur vacuumformarum, i. e., whether
there are
species which are possible but nevertheless do not exist" must
be answered (subject to a large qualification
presently to be
noted) in the affirmative; " there necessarily are species which
never have existed and never will exist, since they are not com-
patible with the series of creatures which God has chosen."
68
In his discovery of this notion of compossibility Leibniz took
great pride, but it has no definite meaning until we know what
the criterion of compossibility is supposed to be; and about this
he has little to say, and that little by no means clear.
Once, at
least, he admits that no statement
of that criterion
can be
given:
It is not yet known to men from what the incompossibility of different
things arises or how it comes about that different essences are opposed
to one another,
since all purely positive terms appear
to be compatible
interse.69
.
Some hints of an explanation, however, are elsewhere discover-
able; and there is some, if not altogether
conclusive, textual
justification for Russell's suggestion that the criterion of com-
possibility for Leibniz lay in an assumed necessity that any pos-
sible world should be subject to uniform laws. If a world, for
example, is to contain motion, then there must. also be for it
invariable laws of motion.
In some possible world, the law of
inverse squares will be one of these laws; and for that world,
though not for other possible ones, any arrangement
or move-
ment of matter not in accordance with the Newtonian formula
will be incompossible.
Thus, in Russell's phrase,
"what
is
called the' reign of law' is metaphysically
necessary in Leib-
niz's philosophy."
60
Yet if this be Leibniz's
meaning,
he
neither states it unequivocally
nor gives it any detailed appli-
cation or illustration.
What,however,
seems plain is that
compossibility does not differ in principle from possibility, in
the traditional
philosophical
sense of the latter
term;
it is
merely a special case of it.
No truths concerning
compossi-
bility are contingent, but all inhere in the logical natures of the
essences concerned.
In short, both the make-up of each world
and the limitation of the possibility of actualization
to someone

I 72
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
of them were among the necessities subsisting eternally in the
realm of Ideas, antecedently
to the choice of a particular
one
among the worlds to be the recipient
of the privilege of exist-
ence.
(b) Consequently,
Leibniz's
introduction
of the notion
of
compossibility did not of itself, as he sometimes seems to have
supposed,
essentially
differentiate
his principle
of sufficient
reason from Spinoza's
universal
necessity.
It was merely a
refinement
or elaboration
upon
the familiar
conception
of
"possibility,"
which Spinoza could without inconsistency have
accepted.
61 The original question remained,
namely, whether
anything,
and if anything,
what,
necessitated
the choice of
the actually existent world from among the possibles. But here
Leibniz
propounded
a further
distinction
by which he pro-
fessed to escape decisively from the deadly reproach
of Spino-
zism.
In maintaining
that the divine will must necessarily be
determined
by the most sufficient reason, and must therefore
infallibly choose the one best out of the many possible worlds,
he is not, he explains,
asserting
the "brutal,
metaphysical
necessity" of Spinoza, but a "moral
necessity."
For the oppo-
site, i. e., the choice of one of the other worlds, would not be
impossible in the metaphysical
sense; it would not imply con-
tradiction.
The will, according
to the principle
of sufficient
reason,
is "always
more inclinedto the alternative
which it
takes, but it is not under the necessity of taking it. It is certain
that it will take it without its being necessary for it to do so."
Thus a residuum
of contingency
is supposed to be left in the
universe and therewith
room is found for the freedom of the
will of the First Cause. 62
The distinction
which Leibniz
here .attempts
to set up is
manifestly without
logical substance;
the fact is so apparent
that it is impossible to believe that a thinker of his powers can
have been altogether unaware of it himself. Without abandon-
ing all that is most essential in the principle of sufficient reason
he could not possibly admit that a sufficient reason"
inclines"
the will without necessitating its choice, and least of all in the
case of a will supposed to be enlightened
by an infinite intelli-
gence. The choice of any world other than the best would,
according
to
propositions
which
Leibniz
frequently
and

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
173
plainly lays down, be as inconsistent with the essence of deity
as non-existence would be; as Leibniz admits even in one of the
passages in which he is endeavoring
to persuade his readers
that his universe contains a real margin of contingency, "chez
le sage necessaire et du sont des choses equivalentes."
63 "The
author of the world is free" only in a sense which is perfectly
consistent with his" doing all things determinately."
When
Leibniz says that, upon his principles,
the opposite to the
actual choice would not involve self-contradiction he confuses
two things.
The mere conceptof the existence of any of the in-
ferior and non-existent worlds is, by the hypothesis, free from
contradiction,
if taken by itself, in abstraction from the prin-
ciple of sufficient reason; but it was absolutely impossible that
it should be selectedfor existence, since this would contradict
both the perfection of God and the very notion of voluntary
choice, of which the principle of sufficient reason is an expres-
sion.
Nor, of course, could it be consistently maintained by Leib-
niz that, though the divine will was necessitated to choose the
best world, the bestness of that world was conferred upon it by
some spontaneous preference, some free act of valuation, on the
part of the chooser. To no doctrine was Leibniz more bitterly
opposed than to this.
For him value was purely objective,
and valuing a strictly logical process. The existence-justifying
good which may be predicable of any essence or collection of
essences is one of its inherent
properties, known, indeed, by
the divine reason, but belonging to the realm of essential or
metaphysical
necessity which is prior to will and regulative
of it. The worth of an object is involved in its Idea in pre-
cisely the same way in which divisibility by other whole num-
bers without a remainder
is involved in the Ideas of certain
whole numbers. 64
If, then, God had pronounced
any other
world best, he would have contradicted himself as absolutely as
if he had asserted that four is not a multiple of two; in other
words, both were equally impossible to him, and therefore the
existence of any other scheme of things than the one which
actually exists was from all eternity impossible.
An absolute logical determinism, then, is as characteristic of
the metaphysics of Leibniz as of that of Spinoza, though the

174
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
reasons why it is are somewhat more complicated in the former
case, and though Leibniz lacked the candor and courage to
express the certain, and almost obvious, outcome of his reason-
ings, in his more popular
writings, without
obscuring
it by
misleading if edifying phraseology -
especially by the verbal
distinction,
absolutely
meaningless
in the light of his other
doctrines, between"
necessitating"
and"
infallibly inclining"
reasons.
The real meaning,
in his system, of the principle of
sufficient reason thus resolves itself into the proposition
that
the existence of everything
that does exist, and also its attri-
butes, behavior, and relations, are determined
by a necessary
truth, or a system of such truths.
The reasonableness
of the
universe which the formula affirms is, as with Spinoza, of the
same type as the reasonableness of a geometrical system -
as
geometrical
systems were conceived
by seventeenth-century
logic.
This could hardly
be more plainly and emphatically
declared than it is by Leibniz himself in one of the most im-
portant
of his shorter
writings,
On the Primary Originationof
Things (De rerumoriginationsradicali, 1697).
In reality we find that all things in the world take place (fieri)according
to the laws of eternal truths, not only geometrical
but also metaphysical,
that is, not only according to material but also to formal necessities; and this
is true not merely generally, with respect to the reason, already explained,
why the world exists rather than does not exist and why it exists thus rather
than otherwise;
but even when we descend to the details we see that meta-
physical laws hold good in a wonderful manner in the entire universe.
. . .
Thus, then, we have the ultimate reason of the reality both of essences and
existences in one being, which is necessarily greater than the world itself,
and superior and antecedent
to it. 66
The same cosmical determinism
is manifest
in a logical
thesis of Leibniz most plainly expressed in certain writings of
his published only within the past fifty years. This thesis is that
all contingent
truths
are ultimately
reducible
to a priori or
necessary truths.
We, no doubt, because of the limitations
of
our human understanding,
cannot, in many cases, accomplish
this reduction;
the distinction
between the necessary and the
contingent
expresses a genuine and persistent
difference
be-
tween the ways in which certain specific truths present them-
selves to our minds.
A judgment
which appears to us as con-

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
175
tingent could by itself be shown to be necessary -
i. e., to be
simply the expression of the essential meaning or "nature"
of
the notions
contained
in it -
only through
an analysis
of
those notions which would proceed in infinitumand is therefore
impossible to a finite mind.
But though we are unable to at-
tain an intuitive
apprehension
of the necessity, in the specific
instance, we can nevertheless be sure that the necessity is there,
and is recognized by the mind of God, who sees all the natures
and their relations
through
and through
in a single perfect
intuition oxscientia uisionis. Unless thus ultimately
reducible to
necessity no proposition
can, according
to Leibniz, be true at
all; for the truth
of a proposition
can mean
only "the
in-
herence of its predicate
in its subject"
directly or indirectly, so
that the subject would not be itself without
that predicate.
66
In other words, no judgment
is true unless its opposite is -
to a sufficiently analytic
and sufficiently comprehensive
intel-
ligence -
a self-contradiction.
And the equivalence
of this
proposition
to the principle
of sufficient reason is explicitly
stated:
the ver£teprimitiae que rien n'est sans raisonis said to be
synoriymous
with
the proposition
that
"every
truth
has a
proof apriori drawn from the notion of its terms, though it is not
always in our power to carry through
this analysis."
67 Not
only by its clear implications,
then, but by some of the formal
definitions of it, the principle of sufficient reason is with Leib-
niz equivalent
to the Spinozistic doctrine of the eternal, quasi-
geometrical
necessity of all things. 68
The fact that Leibniz
had failed to establish any essential
difference
between
his
"sufficient
reason"
and
Spinoza's
"necessity"
was by no means unrecognized
in the eighteenth
century.
It was pointed
out at length,
with perfectly sound
arguments,
by the Halle
theologian
Joachim
Lange
in his
Modesta disquisitio, 1723, and
in numerous
other
writings
against
the philosophy
of Wolff, the systematizer
and popu-
larizer of the Leibnitian
doctrines.
Both Wolff and Leibniz,
Lange observes, "derive
creation
from the nature
of God as
light is derived from the sun, and make it strictly essential to
him and a part of his nature
or necessary."
The only way in
which, on Leibnitian
principles, anything
could, without con-
tradiction,
be other than what it is, would be as a possibility in

I 76
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
some other world which does not exist; in the actual world,
which is also, by the hypothesis,
the only world which God
could conceivably have willed, everything
is determined
with
the same "fatal
necessity"
as in the system of the Jewish phi-
losopher.j"
A similar observation
-
not, perhaps, in this case,
implying
real disapproval
-
later found a place in the less
orthodox pages of the Encyclopidie.To the immense reputation
which Leibniz had in the middle of the century that work bears
conclusive
testimony;
it remarks
that"
he alone confers as
much honor upon Germany
as Plato, Aristotle,
and Archi-
medes together conferred upon Greece."
70 But, it asks:
How can Messieurs Leibnits and Wolf bring their principle of sufficient
reason into accord with the contingency of the universe?
Contingency im-
plies an equal balance of possibilities.
But what is more opposed to such a
balance than the principle of sufficient reason?
It is, then, necessary to say
that the world exists, not contingently, but by virtue of a sufficient reason;
and this might lead us to the verge of Spinozism.
These philosophers at-
tempt, to be sure, to escape this; . . . but it remains true that the sufficient
reason does not leave contingency
unimpaired.
The more a plan has
reasons which require its existence, the less are alternative plans possible-
i.e., the less can they set up claims to existence. . . .
God is the source of
all created monads, which have emanated from him by continual fulgura-
tions. . . .
Things cannot be other than they are. 71
The passage shows clearly that one, and perhaps the principal,
tendency of Leibniz's insistence upon his principle of sufficient
reason -
commonly esteemed in the eighteenth
century one
of the great achievements of philosophy -
was to promote the
doctrine
of universal necessity and to diminish the horror of
that hobgoblin which had so terrified even Leibniz himself, the
metaphysics of Spinoza.
But it may perhaps be suggested that, even though logical
necessity is as absolute and pervasive in Leibniz's universe as
in Spinoza's,
there is still an essential difference between the
two, in that for Leibniz the thing that is necessary is the realiza-
tion of value; in other words, that the principle of sufficient
reason, though it declares that only one world could ever con-
ceivably exist, adds that this one must be the best conceivable
-
an addition
not to be found in Spinoza.
If, however, we
observe what the " good" is that Leibniz regards as the ground
of the existence of any particular
thing, or of the actual world

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
I 77
as a whole, we shall see that even this difference is both less and
other than it at first sight appears to be. We shall at the same
time see the principle of sufficient reason in the act of passing
over explicitly
into the principle
of plenitude.
There
can,
Leibniz often says plainly enough, be only one ultimate reason
why anything
exists, namely, that its essence demands
exist-
ence, and will inevitably
attain it unless interfered with by a
similar demand
on the part of some other essence; and the
superiority of the actual world to all the other abstractly con-
ceivable ones consists in the fact that in it this tendency of es-
sences to exist is realized in a greater measure than in any of
the others.
An exigentia existentiae72 is inherent in every es-
sence; nisi in ipsa essentiaenaturaquaedamad existenduminclinatio
esset,nihil existeret, A mere" possible" is a thing frustrate, un-
completed;
and therefore"
every possible is characterized
by a
striving (conatus)towards existence," and"
may be said to be
destined to exist, provided,
that is, it is grounded
in a neces-
sary being actually existing."
True, as we have seen, not all
possibles do attain
existence, since the requirements
of com-
possibility exclude some of them.
But, with this restriction,
Leibniz comes very near to applying to every essence the prin-
ciple of the ontological argument.
He comes even nearer than
Spinoza to doing so. Spinoza's principal (though not his only)
argument,
it will be remembered,
ran thus: given the Idea of
one directlynecessary being as a point d'appui, the existence of
beings corresponding
to all the other Ideas (within the limits
of possibility) is equally necessary. 73 With Leibniz the point
d'appui seems superfluous.
While he is usually careful to speak
of the other existents as logically dependent upon the existence
of G.od, his emphasis upon the inherency
of the propensioad
existendumin each essence separately is frequently
so unquali-
fied that it becomes difficult to see wherein the dependence
consists. The necessity with which God exists would seem to be
merely one instance -
though the extreme instance -
of this
generic attribute
of essence. The certainty of the realization of
the propension in the case of the divine essence is, perhaps, due
only to its exemption
from the requirements
of compossi-
bility; it is an essence horsconcours,so to say, and does not need
to struggle for a place in the real world. 74 The issue of that

178
THE GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
struggle in the case of the other essences seems to be deter-
mined wholly by theirproperties, not by the attributes of God.
Leibniz does not hesitate to represent
the emergence
of the
actual
from
among
the possible worlds as the result of a
quasi-mechanical
process in which
the world
carrying
the
greatest weight of potential
being inevitably pushed
through
to actuality:
75
From the conflict of all the possibles demanding
existence, this at once
follows, that there exists that series of things by which as many of them as
possible exist; in other words, the maximal series of possibles. . . .
And
as we see liquids spontaneously and by their own nature gather into spherical
drops, so in the nature of the universe the series which has the greatest ca-
pacity (maximecapax)exists.?"
Leibniz
wavers, it is true,
between
two possible ways of
taking this notion of" maximal capacity."
He necessarily ad-
mitted a gradation
among the essences, of which the graded
scale of monads, with God at the summit of the scale, was the
expression.
And he not infrequently
seems to imply that, be-
cause of their differing "degrees
of perfection,"
some essences
may have a greater claim, or a more potent tendency, to exist-
ence than others.
Thus the fullness of the actual world would
be rather
intensive than extensive; it would be measured
by
the rank, or degrees of excellence, of its component
members,
and not merely by their number.
The following passage illus-
trates this way of construing the notion:
The sufficient reason for God's choice can be found only in the fitness
(convenance)or in the degrees of perfection that the several worlds possess,
since each possible thing has the right to aspire to existence in proportion to
the amount of perfection it contains in germ. 77
But though Leibniz, undeniably,
often inclines to this sort of
phraseology
in the popular
writings with which eighteenth-
century readers were most familiar,
the view it suggests was
not logically open to him, and is not in fact carried out in his
account of the actual constitution
of the world.
If it be as-
sumed that the essence man"
contained in germ"
many times
the" amount of perfection"
attaching
to the essence crocodile,
and if it be further assumed (as by Leibniz it is) that the rules
of compossibility
forbid that
two bodies should occupy the
same space, then it would seem, according to the passage last

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
179
cited, that a world containing
only men and no crocodiles
would be better than one containing both, since the crocodiles
would certainly require matter and occupy space which might
be devoted to the uses of human beings. But this is precisely the
conclusion which Leibniz does not draw.
As the author of a
theodicy he is concerned to justify crocodiles; he must show
that the principle
of sufficient reason requires that -
once
more, within the limits of compossibility -
these creatures
and all the other possible links in the Chain of Being, down to
the lowest, shall really exist. What may, then, be called his
actual working theory on the subject is that of equal rights
among essences as claimants for existence.
"To say that some
essences have an inclination to exist and others do not, is to say
something without
reason, since existence seems to be uni-
versally related to every essence in the same manner."
78 And
the superiority of the actual world consists in the numberof dif-
ferent essences -
in other words, in the variety of types -
realized in it, not in their metaphysical
rank or qualitative
excellence.
"Perfection
is to be placed in form [i. e., as the
context shows, in quantityof forms], or variety; whence it fol-
lows that matter is not everywhere uniform, but is diversified
by assuming different forms; otherwise, as much variety as
possible would not be realized. . ..
It follows likewise that
that series prevailed through which there could arise the great-
est possibility of thinking of things as distinct (distinctacogita-
bilitas)." 79 "The
actual universe is the collection of the pos-
sibles qui forment le plus riche compose."80
"We
must say,"
writes Leibniz to Malebranche,
"that
God makes the greatest
number of things that he can";
and it is precisely for this rea-
son that the laws of nature are as simple as possible; by means
of such laws God was able" to find room for as many things as
it is possible to place together.
If God had made use of other
laws, it would be as if one should construct
a building
of
round stones, which leave more space unoccupied
than that
which they fill."
81 Thus even the scientific assumption that
the simplest explanatory
hypothesis is always to be preferred
appeared to Leibniz -
though the connection is hard to fol-
low -
as a corollary of the principle of plenitude.
The"
good," then, for the sake of which, and by reason of

180
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
which, things exist, is simply existence itself -
the actualiza-
tion of essence; and the world that in the eternal
nature
of
things was necessitated
to be, was the world in which "the
quantity
of existence is as great as possible."
82 Thus the dif-
ference
between
Leibniz's
nominal
assertion
and
Spinoza's
denial of final causes approaches
the vanishing
point.
There
are, of course, in Leibniz plenty of passages dilating in the con-
ventional
way upon
the evidences
of design in nature,
the
"fitness"
of everything
to everything
else, and to man's
ad-
vantage, in particular.P
But his fundamental
view, expressed
in his most methodical
and comprehensive
summaries
of his
doctrine, was that each thing exists, not primarily for the sake
of other things, not as an instrument
to an ulterior good, but
because its essence, like every essence, had its own underiva-
tive right to existence.
And since this is realized (so far as it is
possible) by logical necessity, and since its realization
differs
from what Spinoza had represented
as following ex necessitate
dioinaenaturaeonly by the limitations inherent in the rule of in-
compossibility,
the metaphysical
outcome
of the two argu-
ments is still essentially the same.
Nevertheless,
the difference
between
the Leibnitian
and
Spinozistic ways of putting what was, in logical substance, the
same fundamental
metaphysics,
was historically
important.
Where Spinoza had (ostensibly) asserted that the realization
of the principle of plenitude,
being necessary, cannot properly
be called
either
good or bad, Leibniz
declared
that,
while
necessary, it is also supremely
good; he thereby gave to that
principle (without qualification)
the status of a doctrine about
value as well as (with a qualification)
that of a doctrine about
the constitution
of reality.
Spinoza, as we have seen, appears
more interested in the thought of the necessity of the universe
than in the thought
of its plenitude.
Leibniz was genuinely
interested
in both aspects of this dialectic;
but he was also
somewhat
afraid of the cosmic determinism
to which it led
him, while in the notion of the cosmic "fullness"
he took, and
he tended to impart
to his readers,
a lively imaginative
and
emotional satisfaction.
The qualification
to which the principle
of plenitude
was
subject when taken as a generalization
about reality did not,

PLENITUDE
AND SUFFICIENT
REASON
181
in the concrete application
of Leibniz's metaphysics to ques-
tions lying within the purview of natural science, prove to be
of much consequence.
Though he had affirmed the reality of
a vacuumformarum,i. e., of the non-existence of some possibles,
it was a vacuum lying wholly outside the particular
series of
forms which defines the world that actually exists.
Within
this world no gaps of any sort could be admitted;
Leibniz had
a horrorvacuiwhich he was certain that Nature shared.
In its
internal structure the universe is a plenum, and the law of con-
tinuity, the assumption
that"
nature
makes no leaps,"
can
with absolute confidence be applied in all the sciences, from
geometry to biology and psychology.
"If one denied it, the
world would contain
hiatuses, which would overthrow
the
great principle of sufficient reason and compel lIS to have re-
course to miracles or pure chance in the explanation
of phe-
nomena."
What this means, of course, is that since the general
types of entity actually found in the world must obviously be
possible and compossible, and since (as Leibniz somewhat un-
critically assumes) all species of those types must be equally
possible, then the absence from reality of any such species
would amount to an arbitrary,
which is to say a fortuitous,
exclusion of a possible from existence -
the inconceivability
of which to Leibniz needs no further exposition. 84
The principle of plenitude, and that of continuity as a spe-
cial form of it, involve him in some embarrassment
when he
comes to consider the two questions of the existence of matter
and of the possibility of physical vacua, the latter a topic still
much debated among physicists during his lifetime.
In some
passages he comes near to deducing from these principles, as
Archbishop
King had done, a proof of physical realism. 85
God must have created real matter, since if he had not, there
would be not only an unrealized possibility of existence, but
also a lack of coherency in things: "if there were only minds,
they would be without the necessary connection with one an-
other (liaison), without the order of times and places."
This
order"
demands matter and motion and the laws of motion."
And if there is to be any matter at all, then it must be con-
tinuous;
there can be no empty spaces where matter might
have been but is not.
Leibniz therefore vehemently attacked

182
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the physical vacuists.
But on the other hand,
he found rea-
sons, which it is not needful to set forth here,86 for concluding
that
space is merely
the "order
of coexistences,"
a form in
which entities not really extended
appear
sensibly to one an-
other;
and with this the material
world, as conceived
by or-
dinary
physical
realism,
goes by the
board,
and
material
bodies are reduced
to the equivocal
status already mentioned.
The principle
of plenitude,
in short, here comes into conflict
with certain
other
dialectical
motives which
played
an im-
portant
part
in Leibniz's
thought,
and,
at this particular
point, gets the worst of it. 87 When, from this point of view, he
still continues to criticize the believers in the vacuum,
it is not
because
they hold that
empty
spaces exist somewhere,
but
because they hold that real spaces exist at all. 88 Meanwhile,
of the reality of which matter
is the manifestation,
the denial
of the possibility of any vacuum
holds good literally;
nature is
everywhere
teeming with life, all of it accompanied
with some
degree of sentiency.
"There
is," Leibniz writes in the Mona-
dology, "nothing
fallow, nothing
sterile, nothing
dead in the
universe"
; and again elsewhere: " If there were a vacuum, it is
evident
that
there would be left sterile and fallow places in
which,
nevertheless,
without
prejudice
to any other
things,
something
might have been produced.
But it is not consistent
with wisdom
that
any such places should
be left." 89
" In
every particle of the universe a world composed of an infinity
of creatures
is contained.t'P"
But, as the metaphysical
argument
already outlined implies,
it is not of mere quantity
or numbers
that Nature is thus in-
satiably
avid;
it is essentially
the maximization
of diversity
that she seeks, the multiplication
of species and sub-species and
differing individuals
to the limit of logical possibility.
"Just
as there is no vacuum in the varieties of the corporeal world, so
there is no less variety among intelligent
creatures."
91 Some
notable
consequences
drawn from this aspect of the principle
of plenitude
in the eighteenth
century we shall observe in later
lectures.

VI
THE CHAIN OF BEING IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT,
AND MAN '8 PLACE AND
ROLE IN NATURE
IT WAS in the eighteenth
century
that the conception
of the
universe as a Chain of Being, and the principles which under-
lay
this
conception -
plenitude,
continuity,
gradation-
attained
their widest diffusion and acceptance.
This at first
seems somewhat strange.
That a group of ideas which owed
its genesis to Plato and Aristotle and its systematization
to the
Neoplatonists
should have had so belated a fruition may well
appear
surprising -
especially as there was much in the in-
tellectual
fashions of (roughly)
the first three quarters
of the
century which seemed inimical to these assumptions. Aristotle's
authority
had, of course, long since been lost.
Scholasticism
and its methods were, among those who plumed themselves on
their "'enlightenment,"
usually objects of contempt
and ridi-
cule. The faith in speculative apriorimetaphysics was waning,
and the Baconian
temper
(if not precisely the Baconian
pro-
cedure),
the spirit of patient
empirical
inquiry,
continued
its
triumphant
march
in science, and was an object of fervent
enthusiasm among a large part of the general educated public.
And the notion of the Chain of Being, with the assumptions on
which it rested,
was obviously not a generalization
derived
from experience, nor was it, in truth, easy to reconcile with the
known facts of nature.
Nevertheless there has been no period in which writers of all
sorts -
men of science and philosophers,
poets and popular
essayists, deists and orthodox divines -
talked so much about
the Chain of Being, or accepted
more implicitly
the general
scheme of ideas connected
with it, or more boldly drew from
these
their
latent
implications,
or
apparent
implications.
Addison, King, Bolingbroke,
Pope, Haller,
Thomson,
Aken-
side, Buffon, Bonnet,
Goldsmith,
Diderot,
Kant,
Lambert,

184
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Herder,
Schiller -
all these and a host of lesser writers not
only expatiated
upon the theme but drew from it new, or pre-
viously evaded,
consequences;
while Voltaire
and Dr. John-
son, a strange pair of companions
in arms, led an attack upon
the whole conception.
Next to the word'
Nature,'
'the Great
Chain of Being' was the sacred phrase of the eighteenth
cen-
tury, playing a part somewhat analogous to that of the blessed
word'
evolution'
in the late nineteenth.
It was, probably,
not chiefly to any direct influence of Greek
or medieval philosophy
that the conception
owed its vogue in
the eighteenth
century.
For it had been insisted upon by both
of the two philosophers
of the late seventeenth
whose reputa-
tion
and influence
were greatest
in the ensuing
fifty years.
Locke was not less explicit, though he was less exuberant,
than
Leibniz in repeating
the ancient theses:
In all the visible corporeal world we see no chasms or gaps.
All quite
down from us the descent is by easy steps, and a continued series that in
each remove differ very little one from the other.
There are fishes that have
wings and are not strangers to the airy region; and there are some birds that
are inhabitants of the water, whose blood is as cold as fishes....
There are
animals so near of kin both to birds and beasts that they are in the middle
between both.
Amphibious animals link the terrestrial
and aquatic to-
gether;
. . • not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids or
sea-men.
There are some brutes that seem to have as much reason and
knowledge as some that are called men; and the animal and vegetable
kingdoms are so nearly joined, that if you will take the lowest of one and the
highest of the other, there will scarce be perceived
any great difference
between them;
and so on until we come to the lowest and the most unor-
ganical parts of matter, we shall find everywhere that the several species are
linked together, and differ but in almost insensible degrees.
And when we
consider the infinite power and wisdom of the Maker, we have reason to
think, that it is suitable to the magnificent harmony of the universe, and the
great design and infinite goodness of the architect, that the species of crea-
tures should also, by gentle degrees, ascend upwards from us towards his
infinite perfection, as we see they gradually descend from us downwards.'
Addison
made
this aspect
of the Platonistic
metaphysics
familiar even to that part of the public which left the works of
philosophers and theologians unread,
by repeated references to
it in the Spectator-
for example,
in No. 519.
Infinite Goodness is of so communicative
a Nature, that it seems to de-
light in the conferring of Existence upon every degree of Perceptive Being.

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
185
As this is a Speculation which I have often pursued with great Pleasure to
myself, I shall enlarge farther upon it by considering that part of the Scale
of Beings which comes within our own Knowledge.
There are many other
creatures
. . . which have no other sense beside that of feeling and taste.
. . .
It is wonderful to observe, by what a gradual progress the World of
Life advances through a prodigious variety of species, before a creature is
formed that is compleat in all its Senses. . ..
If after this we look into
the several inward Perfections of Cunning and Sagacity, or what we gener-
ally call Instinct, we find them rising after the same manner, imperceptibly
one above another, and receiving additional
Improvements,
according to
the Species in which they are implanted.
This progress in Nature is so very
gradual, that the most perfect of an Inferior Species comes very near to the
most imperfect of that which is immediately above it. . . .
Nor is [the]
goodness [of the Supream Being] less seen in the Diversity than in the Mul-
titude of living Creatures.
Had he made only one Species of Animals, none
of the rest would have enjoyed the Happiness of Existence; he has, there-
fore, specifiedin his Creation every degree of Life, every Capacity of Being.
The whole Chasm in Nature, from a Plant to a Man, is filled up with di-
verse Kinds of Creatures, rising one over another by such a gentle and easie
Ascent, that the little Transitions and Deviations from one Species to an-
other, are almost insensible.
This intermediate
Space is so well husbanded
and managed, that there is scarce a degree of Perception which does not ap-
pear in some part of the World of Life.2
Another writer, the Anglican divine Edmund Law, was ~ot
content even with this picture of the' fullness' of creation, out,
after quoting Addison, added that within each species as many
individuals as are capable of existing together must have been
generated:
From the ...
observation that there is no manner of chasmor void, no
link deficient in this great chain of beings, and the reason of it, it will appear
extremely probable that every distinct order, every class or species of them,
is as full as the nature of it would admit, or God saw proper.
There are
perhaps so many in each class as could exist together without some incon-
venienceor uneasinessto each other.
This we are sure of, that nothing but
an impossibilityin the nature of the thing, or some greater (sic) inconven-
ience, can restrain the exercise of the power of God, or hinder him from
producing still more and more beings capable of felicity. . ..
We have
the highest reason to conclude that everything is as perfect as possible in its
own kind, and that every system is in itself full and complete."
Out of the many special turns given to these general ideas,
we shall in the present lecture consider certain of the deduc-
tions made from them with respect to man -
his status in the

186
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
scale, his nature,
and the ethical consequences
to be drawn
from these.
A.
The Chain ofBeing and Man's Place in Nature.
We have
already considered the effects-of the belief in the infinity of the
world and the plurality of inhabited
globes -
itself chiefly an
inference from the principle of plenitude
-
upon man's con-
ception of his place and consequence
in the cosmic system.
This belief, we have seen, did less to abate the self-esteem of our
race than might have been expected and has often been sup-
posed.
But there were four other implications of the notion of
the full and infinitesimally
graduated
Scale of Being which
tended definitely to lower man's estimate of his cosmic impor-
tance and uniqueness;
and these were much dwelt upon by
eighteenth-century
philosophers
and
popularizers
of philo-
sophical ideas.
I.
It was implied by the principle of plenitude
that every
link in the Chain of Being exists, not merely and not primarily
for the benefit of any other link, but for its own sake, or more
precisely, for the sake of the completeness of the series of forms,
the realization of which was the chief object of God in creating
the world.
We have already seen that, though essences were
conceived to be unequal in dignity, they all had an equal claim
to existence, within the limits of rational possibility; and there-
fore the true raison d'etre of one species of being was never to be
sought in its utility to any other.
But this implication
was in
conflict with an old assumption,
highly flattering
to man,
which still persisted in the seventeenth
and eighteenth
cen-
turies.
The' physico-theology'
so much beloved by the writers
of works of edification, deistic as well as orthodox, was in intent
a proof of the existence of God; but it was in effect a glorifica-
tion of man.
For it rested in great part upon the supposition
that all other created beings exist for man's sake.
Tout est cree
pour l'homme is at once the tacit premise and the triumphant
conclusion of that long series of teleological arguments which
constitutes so large a fraction of the' philosophical'
output of
the
eighteenth
century -
and
is one of the
most curious
monuments
of human imbecility.
This later age, in this, but
repeats
a strain heard frequently
in the Middle
Ages.
The
principal
textbook of Scholastic philosophy had declared:

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
187
As man is made for the sake of God, namely, that he may serve him, so
is the world made for the sake of man, that it may serve him.t
Bacon had elaborated
upon the theme:
Man, if we look to final causes, may be regarded
as the centre of the
world; insomuch that if man were taken away from the world, the rest
would seem to be all astray, without aim or purpose, ...
and leading to noth-
ing.
For the whole world works together in the service or man;
and there
is nothing from which he does not derive use and fruit ...
insomuch that
all things seem to be going about man's business and not their own.!
In a Protestant
theological work of the late seventeenth century
which was much admired
in the eighteenth
it is written:
If we consider closely what constitutes the excellence of the fairest parts
of the Universe, we shall find that they have value only in their relation to
us, only in so far as our soul attaches value to them;
that the esteem of men
is what constitutes the chief dignity of rocks and metals, that man's use and
pleasure gives their value to plants, trees and fruits. 6
" In nature not only the plants but the animals,"
says Fenelon,
"are made for our use."
Predatory
animals may seem an ex-
ception; but"
if all countries were peopled and made subject
to law and order as they should be, there would be no animals
that
would
attack
man."
Yet the wilder
beasts also serve
man, partly
as means to the cultivation
of physical
address
and courage, partly as aids to the preservation
of international
peace.
For Fenelon
tQOhad some sense of man's need of a
"moral
substitute for war";
he proposed to meet it by main-
taining preserves of "ferocious animals"
in remote regions, to
which those men whose fighting
propensities
needed
outlet
might repair.
And "the beneficence
of nature
was not least
shown in thus providing
fighting creatures
of other species to
kill, so that men might be relieved of the necessity of killing
one another.
7 The Creator has aimed, said Bernardin
de St-
Pierre -
whose Etudes de /a Nature, 1784, was looked upon
as one of the masterpieces
in this genre-
"only at the happi-
ness of man.
All the laws of nature are designed to serve our
needs."
8
Not only against this assumption that the rest of the creation
is instrumental
to man's good but -
though less obviously -
against the premises of the teleological argument
in general,

188
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the logic of the conception
of the Chain of Being worked po-
tently, though the protest against this form of human vanity
was prompted
also by other considerations.
Galileo had writ-
ten: "We arrogate too much to ourselves if we suppose that the
care of us is the adequate
work of God, the end beyond which
the divine wisdom and power
does not extend."
9
Henry
More, clearly under the influence of the principle of plenitude,
declared that:
We are not to be scandalized
. . . that there is such careful provision
made for such contemptiblevermine
as we conceive them [the lower animals]
to be.
For this only comes out of Pride and Ignorance,
or a haughty Pre-
sumption, that because we are encouraged to believe that in some Sense all
things are made for Man, therefore they are not at all made for themselves.
But he that pronounces
this is ignorant
of the Nature
of God, and the
Knowledge of things.
For if a good Man be merciful to his Beast; then
surely a good God is bountiful and benign, and takes Pleasure that all his
Creatures enjoy themselves that have Life and Sense, and are capable of
any enjoyment.!"
Descartes was, however, the foremost opponent
in the seven-
teenth century not only of an anthropocentric
teleology but of
all forms of teleological reasoning in science.
Aside from other
objections, he found the theory in conflict with obvious facts.
It is not at all probable that all things have been created for us in such a
manner that God has no other end in creating them. . ..
Such a supposi-
tion would, I think, be very inept in reasoning about physical questions;
for
we cannot doubt that an infinitude of things exist, or did exist though they
have now ceased to do so, which have never been beheld or comprehended
by man, and have never been of any use to him.P
Most, indeed, of the greater
philosophers
of the seventeenth
century
repeat
the same remark.
Leibniz expressly concurs
with Spinoza in the theorem non omniahominumcausafieriP
It
is not surprising, he observes, that"
we find in the world things
that are not pleasing to us," since" we know that it was not
made for us alone."
It is, in fact, "absurd,"
said Archbishop
King, to imagine that "the
earth was made for the sake of
mankind, and not of the universe" ; no one" who is not blinded
by pride
and ignorance"
could ever suppose it.
The same
proposition
is the principal
burden
of Bolingbroke's
polemic
against all" divines" except King, in the Fragments,orMinutes

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
18g
oj Essays,from which Pope probably
got most of the ideas for
the First Epistle of the Essay on Man.
The agreement
of the
deist with the orthodox
apologist is here complete.
Boling-
broke professes, it is true, to scorn all theosophic speculation,
all the pretensions of theologians
to an acquaintance
with the
secret counsels of the Most High;
and for Plato and his fol-
lowers, ancient
and modern,
he has an especially lively con-
tempt.
Yet he too, in the end, quietly assumes that he is not
entirely ignorant
of "the
design of the Author
of all nature."
The completeness of the cosmic scheme as a whole is, Boling-
broke is sure, the true raisond'etreof the universe.
We have no
reason to think that "Infinite
Wisdom had no other end in
making
man"
-
or, indeed,
any other link in the chain -
"than
that of making a happy creature."
13
The sensitive inhabitants
of our globe, like the dramatispersonae,have
different
characters,
and are applied
to different
purposes of action in
every scene. The several parts of the material world, like the machines of
a theatre, were contrived, not for the actors, but for the action;
and the
whole order and system of the drama would be disordered and spoiled, if
any alteration was made in either.P
The universe,
in short, was made in order
that all possible
forms of being might
manifest
themselves
after their
kinds.
Thus what a writer of our own time has called the point de vue
spectaculaire-
the cosmical
piety and the sort of Romantic
delight in the world which can arise, not from any belief in its
adaptation
to man's needs or hopes, but from its infinite rich-
ness and diversity as a spectacle, the prodigious
sweep of the
complex and often tragic drama which it exhibits -
was by
no means unfamiliar
in the early eighteenth
century."
This
favorite thesis of so many eighteenth-century
writers was most
tersely summed
up by Goethe in his poem Athroismos(1819):
"every
animal is an end in itself":
Zweck sein selbst ist jegliches Tier.
2.
A second consequence
of the same sort was often drawn
from the accepted
view as to man's relative
position in the
Chain of Being.
The customary thing to say about this was, as
we have seen, that he is the"
middle link" in the chain.
This
did not necessarily or (I think) usually mean that the kinds

I go
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
above him and below him are equal in number.
On the con-
trary, Locke thought
that "we have reason to be persuaded
that there are far more species of creatures above us, than there
are beneath;
we being in degrees of perfection much more re-
mote from the infinite Being of God, than we are from the low-
est state of being, and that which approaches nearest to noth-
ing."
16
Addison puts the argument
still more sharply;
the
"space and room"
upwards is infinite, and must all be filled;
but the number of grades below is finite.F
Man was thus not
midway in the series, but well down towards the lower end of
it.
He was the "middle
link" in the sense that he was at the
point of transition from the merely sentient to the intellectual
forms of being.
Did this suggest a flattering
or a humbling
view of man?
To the poet Young, who construed the notion of
the middle position literally, it appeared to permit man to hold
a rather high opinion of himself; he is a
Distinguished link in being's endless chain,
Midway from nothing to the deity.
But to most of those who reflected upon the position in the uni-
verse which the theory assigned to man, it was an added reason
for humility.
Even though he had been made but a little lower
than the angels, he was lower than the lowest of the angels, or
other spiritual
beings;
and the successive hierarchies
above
him were so numerous that when his mind dwelt upon them a
sort of racial
inferiority-complex
naturally
resulted.
"The
principall
use of considering these scales of Creatures,"
wrote
Sir William
Petty
(1677), "is to lett man see that beneath
God there may be millions of creatures
superior
unto man.
Wheras
Hee generally
taketh
himself to be the chiefe and
next to God."
For it shows him that"
there are beings within
...
the orb of the fixed Starrs ...
which do [more] incom-
parablyexcell
man in the sense of dignity and infirmity then
man doth excell the vilest insect."
18 If, wrote a lady of qual-
ity in 1710 -
the authorship
of the passage shows how com-
pletely a commonplace
this way of thinking then was -
· . . if . . . we farther consider, that there being a Scale of Beings, which
reaches from the first Cause to the most imperceptible
Effect, from the in-
finite Creator to the smallest of his Productions, we have reason to believe,

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
191
that as we see an innumerable
Company
of Beings below us, and each
Species to be less perfect in its Kind, till they end in a Point, an indivisible
Solid: so there are almost an infinite Number of Beings above us, who as
much exceed us, as we do the minutest Insect, or the smallest Plant, and, in
comparison of whom, the most elevated Genius's, the greatest Masters of
Reason, the most illuminated
and unweary'd
Enquirers after Knowledge,
are but Children, such as hardly deserve to be of the lowest Form in the
School of Wisdom, we cannot
but have contemptible
Thoughts
of our
selves, cannot but blush at our own Arrogance, and look back with Shame
on the several Instances of our Folly.
Methinks I see those bright Intelligences ...
who by the Dignity of their
Nature
are raised to sublime Stations, to the most intimate
Union that
created Minds can have with the Supream Good, viewing us with a scornful
Smile, but with a scorn that is mix'd with Pity .19
Addison
merely condensed
this a few years later:
"If
the
notion of a gradual rise in Beings from the meanest to the most
High be not a vain imagination,
it is not improbable
that an
Angel looks down upon a Man, as a Man doth upon a Crea-
ture which approaches
the nearest to the rational
Nature."
20
The philosopher
Formey reports the similar impression made
UpOI)him when he first became acquainted
with the concep-
tion of the Scale of Being:
How little cause have I to exalt myself above others, and whence can I
derive motives for pride? Heretofore I used to conceit myself one of the most
excellent of God's creatures,
but I now perceive how great my delusion
was. I find myself towards the lowest part of the Scale, and all I can boast
of is, that I have a small pre-eminence above irrational creatures;
and this
is not always so, there being many things in which they possess advantages
which I have not.
On the contrary I see above me a multitude of superior
intelligences."
There
was, of course, nothing
new in this belief in many
ranks of "intelligences"
superior
to man;
the passages cited
thus far merely illustrate
its persistence,
its recognized
philo-
sophical basis in the general scheme of the Chain of Being, and
its effect upon man's conception
of himself.
But in the eight-
eenth century the belief began to take on a more naturalistic
form.
This
is illustrated
in some passages of Bolingbroke.
That there is an unbroken
Chain of Being "almost
from non-
entity up to man"
he supposed to be established
by observa-
tion; and like the Schoolmen whom he ridiculed, he found that,
though
empirical
evidence here fails us, "we
have the most

192
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
probable reasons to persuade us, that it continues up to natures
infinitely below the divine, but vastly superior to the human."
But these superior natures were not for him the angelic hier-
archies,. but simply the inhabitants
of some of the other globes
in this or other solar systems.
For this faith in the existence of
higher links in the chain he gives an interesting
reason, sup-
plementary
to the general postulate of plenitude:
the fact that
man's
intellectual
powers so obviously
fall far short of the
maximal possibilities even of finite intelligence.
We cannot doubt that numberless worlds and systems of worlds compose
this amazing whole, the universe;
and as little, I think, that the planets
which roll about the sun, or those which roll about a multitude of others,
are inhabited by living creatures, fit to be inhabitants
of them.
When we
have this view before our eyes, can we be stupid or vain or impertinent
enough to imagine that we stand alone or foremost among rational created
beings? We who must be conscious, unless we are mad, and have lost the use
of our reason, of the imperfection of our reason? Shall we not be persuaded
rather that as there is a gradation of sense and intelligence here from animal
beings imperceptible
to us for their minuteness, without the aid of micro-
scopes and even with them, up to man, in whom, though this be their
highest stage, [they] remain very imperfect; so there is a gradation from man,
through various forms of sense, intelligence, and reason, up to beings who
cannot be known by us, because of their distance from us, and whose rank
in the intellectual system is above even our conceptions?
This system, as
well as the corporeal,
.•.
must have been alike present to the Divine
Mind before he made them to exist.22
Bolingbroke too, in short, in spite of his ostentation, of agnosti-
cism, wanted to have faith in the universe; .and this seemed to
him impossible without
the postulate
that
nature
has some-
where
produced
better
specimens
of rationality
than homo
sapiens. But of the defects of his intelligence it is unreasonable
in man to complain;
only a segment of the scale exists on this
planet, and he happens
to be the not altogether
non-rational
yet on the whole very stupid creature
who occupies a certain
point in the series -
a little higher, indeed, than any other on
the globe which he inhabits, yet incalculably
below the highest.
If he, with his limitations,
were wanting,
the scheme would
be incomplete,
and therefore imperfect.
Pope puts the same
disparagement'
of man into four pungent
lines:

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
193
Superior beings when of late they saw
A mortal man unfold all Nature's law,
Admir'd such wisdom in an earthly shape,
And shew'd a NEWTON
as we shew an Ape.23
The same notion was afterwards more cheerfully elaborated
by Kant:
Human nature occupies as it were the middle rung of the Scale of Being,
...
equally removed from the two extremes.
If the contemplation of the
most sublime classes of rational creatures, which inhabit Jupiter or Saturn,
arouses his envy and humiliates him with a sense of his own inferiority, he
may again find contentment
and satisfaction by turning his gaze upon
those lower grades which, in the planets Venus and Mercury, are far below
the perfection of human nature."
Kant,
however, had discovered, as he supposed, a physical
reason for this unequal
distribution
of degrees of rationality
amongst the planets.
Mental
functions, he did not, in this
early phase of his philosophical development, doubt, are
con~
ditioned by the constitution of the material bodies with which
they are associated.
"It is certain that man derives all his con-
cepts and representations from the impressions which the uni-
verse makes upon him through his body";
even" the power of
comparing and combiI).ing" these impressions, "which may be
called the faculty of thought, is wholly dependent upon the con-
stitution of the matter with which the Creator has conjoined
him."
25 Now the greater the distance of a planet from the sun,
the less it receives of the solar heat and energy; and in order
that life and intelligence
may subsist on the more remote
planets, the matter
of which living bodies thereon are con-
stituted
must be "lighter
and finer"
and the physiological
structure of organisms, both animal and vegetal, must be more
delicately and intricately organized.
Hence, Kant concludes,
there is a law, "of which the degree of probability falls little
short of complete certainty,"
that
the excellence of thinking natures, their quickness of apprehension,
the
clarity and vividness of their concepts, which come to them from the im-
pressions of the external world, their capacity to combine these concepts,
and finally, their practical efficiency, in short the entire extent of their per-
fection, becomes higher and more complete in proportion to the remoteness
of their dwelling-place from the sun. 26

I 94
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Thus"
the dullness of man's wits," the confusion (Verwirrung)
of his ideas, his extreme liability to error, and the depravity
of
his moral nature -
of all of which Kant is no less sensible than
Bolingbroke -
are the necessary consequences of the depend-
ence of his mind upon a "coarse
and inert matter."
But from
these physical obstructions
to mental activity the happier
in-
habitants
of the outer planets are comparatively
free.
To what advances in knowledge will the insight of those fortunate
be-
ings in the higher celestial spheres not attain!
What fair effects will this
clarification of their understandings
not have upon their moral condition!
. ..
What a noble imprint of its nature will not divinity itself . . . form
in those thinking natures which, like a quiet sea untroubled
by the storms
of passion, receive and reflect back its image! 27
Comment
on this wild but pleasing speculation
would be
superfluous.
But it would be hard to find a better illustration
of the hold which the principles
of the Platonistic
tradition
whose history we are examining had upon even the best minds
of the eighteenth
century.
The illustration
is the more note-
worthy because, as we have seen, Kant was not prepared
to
maintain
that all globes must have conscious inhabitants.
He
was nevertheless
quite certain
that,
in a reasonably
ordered
universe,
most of them must have, that life and intelligence
cannot possibly be confined to one small planet, and that the
Scale of Being must extend far above man.
He too finds con-
solation in the thought
that so poor a creature
as man is far
from the best that
nature
produces.
Upon
even the most
boasted achievements
of our kind, on its necessarily inferior
globe, the Jovians and Saturnians can but look down with con-
descending pity; Kant concludes with a paraphrase
of Pope's
lines: the higher beings of these other spheres must "view
a
Newton"
as we view a Hottentot
or an ape.
Bonnet in 1764 similarly derives from the postulate
of the
completeness of the Chain of Being light upon the inhabitants
of other globes.
Since it is a law of nature that no two leaves,
or animals,
or men, are completely
alike, the same must be
true of planets and solar systems.
The assortment of beings which is characteristic
of our world is probably
not to be found in any other.
Each globe has its distinctive economy and
laws and products.
There are perhaps
worlds so imperfect
relatively
to

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
195
ours, that there are to be found in them only ...
[inanimate]
beings.
Other worlds, on the contrary, may be so perfect that there are in them only
beings of the superior classes. In these latter worlds, the rocks are organic
bodies, the plants have sensation, the animals reason, the men are angels."
3. This, however, was a motive for humility which had long
been insisted upon by the traditional
theology. The Church
had always bidden the individual
man walk humbly with his
God and be sensible of his inferiority
to countless creatures
above
him in the
cosmic hierarchy.
But it had often en-
couraged him to walk proudly among the creatures below him
in that scale.
Was he not infinitely removed in dignity from
even the highest animals by his participation
in the intellectual
light of the divine Reason?
Yet when one began to consider
seriously
the implications
of the principle
of continuity-
which great theologians of the Church had taught -
it seemed
to follow that man can be supposed to differ psychologically or
physically from the nearest so-called non-human
species only
infinitesimally.
The
curious
thing is that
this consequence
was, for the most part, so tardily drawn.
Addison, while he
finds matter
for pride in man's position as the nexus utriusque
mundi, the link between
the animal
and the intellectual
na-
tures,
nevertheless
concludes
his reflections
on the subject
thus:
So that he who, in 'one respect, is associated with angels and archangels,
and may look upon a being of Infinite Perfection as his Father, and the high-
est order of Spirits as his brethren, may, in another respect, say to Corrup-
tion, Thou art my Father, and to the worm, Thou art my Sister.
Arguing specifically from the principle of continuity, Boling-
broke also was diligent in the effort to lower man's too high
conceit of himself -
though he thought
that. some had gone
too far in racial
self-disparagement.
Man
is, indeed,
"the
principal
inhabitant
of this planet, a being superior to all the
rest."
But his superiority
is only one of degree, and of a very
slight degree.
The whole chorus of theistical philosophers and divines boast it [reason]
to be the distinguishing gift of God to man, that which gives him a pre-
eminence and a right of command over his fellow ereatures. . . .
There
have been those who have thought, that the human is a portion of the divine
soul. Others have been more modest, and have allowed that the former is

196
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
a created being, ...
but a being of so high an order, that there is none
superior, except the Supreme Being....
There is a middle point between these extremes, where the truth lies;
and he who seeks it may find it. . ..
He will find . . . many such de-
grees of comparison between the human
intelligence and that of various
animals.
He may be induced, perhaps, to think that intellectual faculties
and corporeal senses, of the same and of different kinds, are communicated
in some proportion or other to the whole race of animals ....
29
Man is connected by his nature,
and therefore, by the design of the
Author of all Nature, with the whole tribe of animals, and so closely with
some of them, that the distance between his intellectual facuIties and theirs,
which constitutes as really, though not so sensibly as figure, the difference of
species, appears, in many instances, small, and would probably appear still
less, if we had the means of knowing their motives, as we have of observing
their actions."
Pope,
when
he
translated
these
reflections
into
verse,
heightened the emphasis on the more edifying aspect of Boling-
broke's via media:
Far as Creation's ample range extends,
The scale of sensual, mental powers ascends:
Mark how it mounts to man's imperial race,
From the green myriads in the peopled grass. .
How instinct varies in the grovelling swine,
Compar'd,
half-reasoning elephant, with thine!
'Twixt that, and reason, what a nice barrier,
Forever sep'rate, yet forever near!
Remembrance
and reflection how ally'd!
What thin partitions sense from thought divide!
And middle natures, how they long to join,
Yet never pass th' insuperable line!
Without this just gradation could they be
Subjected, these to those, or all to thee!
The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone,
Is not thy reason all these pow'rs in one? 31
In spite of Pope's reversion to a more conventional
strain in
these last lines, he elsewhere attributes
man's lapse from the
"state of Nature, " which was" the reign of God," to the sin of
pride -
not that which caused man's fall in the biblical narra-
tive, but a pride which led him to separate
himself unduly
from the other animals:
Pride then was not, nor arts that pride to aid;
Man walk'd with beast, joint tenant of the shade;

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
197
The same his table, and the same his bed;
No murder cloath'd him and no murder fed.
In the same temple, the resounding wood,
All vocal beings hymn'd their equal God! 32
Soame Jenyns
seeks to alleviate this consequence
of the
principle of continuity by dwelling upon the many degrees of
intelligence found within the human species; while the psycho-
logical difference between the highest animals and the lowest
men is scarcely appreciable,
between either of these and the
most highly endowed of civilized mankind the gradations are
many and the distance wide.
The farther we inquire into the works of our great Creator,
the more
evident marks we shall discover of his infinite wisdom and power, and
perhaps none more remarkable,
than in that wonderful chain of beings,
with which this terrestrial globe is furnished;
rising above each other from
the senselessclod, to the brightest genius of human kind, in which, though the
chain itself is sufficiently visible, the links, which compose it, are so minute,
and so finely wrought, that they are quite imperceptible to our eyes. The
various qualities with which these various beings are endued, we perceive
without difficulty, but the boundaries of those qualities which form this
chain of subordination,
are so mixed, that where one ends, and the next
begins, we are unable to discover. • .•
The manner by which the consum-
mate wisdom of the divine artificer has formed this gradation, so extensive
in the whole, and so imperceptible
in the parts, is this: -
He constantly
unites the highest degree of the qualities of each inferior order to the lowest
degree of the same qualities belonging to the order next above it; by which
means, like the colours of a skilful painter, they are so blended together, and
shaded off into each other, that no line of distinction is anywhere to be seen.
. . .
Animal life rises from this low beginning in the shell-fish, through
innumerable
species of insects, fishes, birds, and! beasts, to the confines of '
reason, where, in the dog, the monkey, and chimpanze, it unites so closely
with the lowest degree of that quality in man, that they cannot easily be
distinguished from each other.
From this lowest degree in the brutal Hot-
tentot, reason, with the assistance of learning and science, advances, through
the various stages of human understanding,
which rise above each other,
till in a Bacon or a Newton it attains the summit.P
Yet, Jenyns adds,
The superiority of man to other terrestrial animals is as inconsiderable,
in proportion to the immense plan of universal existence, as the difference of
climate between the north and south end of the paper I now write upon,
with regard to the heat and distance of the sun.34

Ig8
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
This sort of utterance
did not, for its authors
or contem-
porary
readers,
in the first half of the eighteenth
century,
usually imply the consanguinity
of man and the animals next
to him in the scale.
But the belief in such consanguinity
is
significant, for man's evaluation
of himself, only in so far as it
minimizes the distinctiveness
of man's nature
and denies the
existence of a wide chasm between him and all other terrestrial
creatures.
And that
chasm the principle
of continuity
had
bridged
for many
eighteenth-century
minds
by whom
the
hypothesis of the transformation
of species, then already
be-
ginning to emerge, was not accepted.
Thus one of the effects
often attributed
to the influence of biological evolutionism had
in fact come about long before the establishment
and general
diffusion of that doctrine,
and quite independently
of it.
4. But it was not merely that man's
separation
from the
lower orders of living things was thus reduced
to an almost
inappreciable
degree of difference.
The definition
of him as
the"
middle link," in the sense usually given to it, especially
emphasized
the peculiar
duality
of his constitution
and the
tragi-comic
inner discord in him which results from this.
The
recognition
of the fact that man is a creature
not in harmony
with himself was not, of course, due primarily
to the influence
of the notion of the Chain of Being.
Other
elements of Pla-
tonism, and in Christianity
the radical
Pauline opposition
of
"flesh"
and"
spirit," had made this dualistic theory of human
nature one of the ruling conceptions in Western thought;
and
the moral experience of countless generations
indoctrinated
in
it had seemed to give it poignant
confirmation.
But the place'
assigned to man in the graded scale which constitutes the uni-
verse lent to this conception
still greater sharpness and an air
of metaphysical
necessity.
Somewhere in that scale there must
exist a creature
in which the merely animal series terminates
and the"
intellectual"
series has its dim and rudimentary
be-
ginning;
and man is that creature.
He is therefore -
not in
consequence
of any accidental
fall from innocence nor of any
perverse machinations
of evil spirits, but because of the re-
quirements
of the universal scheme of things -
torn by con-
flicting desires and propensities;
as a member of two orders of
being at once, he wavers between both, and is not quite at home

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
199
in either.
He thus has, after all, a kind of uniqueness in nature;
but it is an unhappy
uniqueness.
He is, in a sense in which no
other link in the chain is, a strange hybrid monster; and if this
gives him a certain pathetic sublimity, it also results in incon-
gruities of feeling, inconsistencies of behavior,
and disparities
between
his aspirations
and his powers, which render
him
ridiculous.
It is this aspect of man's status as the link uniting
the two great segments of the scale which Pope presents, in
lines almost too familiar to quote, but too perfectly illustrative
of the conception -
and too superb
an example
of Pope's
poetic style at its best -
to leave unquoted.
Plac'd in this isthmus of a middle state,
A being darkly wise and rudely great,
With too much knowledge for the sceptic side,
With too much weakness for the stoic pride,
He hangs between;
in doubt to act or rest;
In doubt to deem himself a god or beast;
In doubt his Mind or Body to prefer;
Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err;
.
Chaos of Thought and Passion all confus'd,
Still by himself abus'd, or disabus'd;
Created half to rise, and half to fall,
Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;
Sole judge of Truth,
in endless error hurl'd;
The glory, jest and riddle of the world."
Haller,
apostrophizing
his
kind
as
"unselig
Mittel-Ding
von Engeln und von Vieh," exhibits man as the same cosmic
paradox:
Du pralst mit der Vernunft, und du gebrauchst sie nie.
Was helfen dir zuletzt der Weisheit hohe Lehren?
Zu schwach sie zu verstehn, zu stolz sie zu entbehren.
Dein schwindelnder
Verstand, zum irren abgericht,
Sieht oft die Wahrheit
ein, und wahlt sie dennoch nicht ...
Du urteilst iiberall, und weist doch nie warum;
Der Irrthum
ist dein Rath, und du sein Eigenthum."
Yet the Swiss poet adds the two complementary
and consoling
reflections upon which we have already seen other writers of
the century
dwelling;
there are other globes than ours with
happier inhabitants,
and in any case the imperfection
of man
is indispensable
to the fullness of the hierarchy
of being:

200
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Perhaps this world of ours, which like a grain of sand
Floats in the vast of heaven, is Evil's fatherland;
While in the stars perhaps dwell spirits far more fair,
Vice reigning ever here, Virtue triumphant
there.
And yet this point, this world, whose worth appears so small,
Serves in its place to make complete the mighty All.37
There were in the thought
of the eighteenth
century,
espe-
cially after the middle of it, other strains, not pertinent
to our
present subject,
which worked
against
this fashion of racial
self-disparagement
and prepared
the way for those disastrous
illusions of man about himself which were to be so characteris-
tic of the century that followed, and against which our own age
has, scarcely less disastrously,
revolted.
But the immense in-
fluence of the complex of ideas which was summed
up in the
cosmological conception
of the Chain of Being tended chiefly,
in the period with which we are now concerned,
to make man
not unbecomingly
sensible of his littleness in the scheme of
things, and to promote a not wholly unsalutary
modesty and
self-distrust.
B. Some Ethical and Political Consequences. From
this and
from other aspects of the conception
diverse practical
morals
could be, or, at all events, in the eighteenth
century
were,
deduced.
I . In the earlier part of the century, the most significant of
these, and the most characteristic,
may be described as a coun-
sel of imperfection
-
an ethics of prudent
mediocrity.
Since
every place in the scale must be filled, and since each is what it
is by virtue
of the special limitations
which differentiate
it
from any other, man's duty was to keep his place, and not to
seek to transcend
it -
which, nevertheless,
he was character-
istically prone to do.
The good for a being of a given grade, it
seemed evident, must consist in conformity
to its type, in the
expression ofjust that Idea which defines its position, or that of
its species, in the series.
There
must, then, be a specifically
human excellence which it is man's vocation to achieve -
an
excellence as little to be confused with that of angels or of God
as with that of the beasts; and to covet the attributes
or imitate
the characteristic
activities of beings above one in the cosmic
order is as immoral as to sink to a lower level of it. The method

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
201
of such an ethics would consist in taking stock of man's actual
constitution
-
his distinguishing instincts, desires, and natural
capacities -
and in formulating his good in terms of some bal-
anced and practicable
fulfilment of these.
And since man's
place is not a very high one, since he is a mixture of the animal
and the intellectual
elements, and since the latter is present in
him only in a meagre measure and in its lowest, or almost
lowest, form, the beginning of wisdom for him was to remem-
ber and to hold fast to his limitations.
Of this ethics of the middle link Pope, again, was the chief,
though not the first, apostle.
The bliss of man (could pride that blessing find)
Is not to act or think beyond mankind:
No pow'rs of body or of soul to share,
But what his nature and his state can bear."
Rousseau in Emile echoes Pope's preaching:
OMan!
confine thine existence within thyself, and thou wilt no longer
be miserable.
Remain in the place which Nature has assigned to thee in
the chain of beings, and nothing can compel thee to depart from it....
Man is strong when he contents himself with being what he is; he is weak
when he desires to raise himself above humanity.
This moral temper oftenest expressed itself in that constant
invective against"
pride," so characteristic
of Pope and many
another
writer of the period."
Pride is the sin" against the
laws of Order,"
i. e." of g-radation; it is an attempt"
to counter-
work the Universal Cause," to disturb the very system of the
universe.
In pride, in reas'ning pride, our error lies;
All quit their sphere and rush into the skies.
Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,
Men would be angels, angels would be gods.
Man should, accordingly,
eschew all the vaster enterprises of
the mind;
he was not meant and is not equipped
for them.
"Trace
Science then with modesty thy guide";
and when all
the vanities, errors, and excrescences of learning are expunged,
Then see how little the remaining sum,
Which serv'd the past, and must the times to-come!

202
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Here the conception
of the Chain of Being -
and of man
as its" middle link" -
resulted in a species of rationalistic anti-
intellectualism.
But it also -
when
made
the basis of an
ethics -
led to a disparagement
of all the more pretentious
and exacting moral ideals -
for example, of that of Stoicism.
Above all, the same conception led to the open and unqualified
rejection
of that
otherworldliness
which
had
always
been
characteristic
of the
Christian
and
the
Platonic
tradition.
"Go, wondrous creature!"
writes Pope contemptuously,
Go soar with Plato to the empyreal sphere,
To the first good, first perfect, and first fair,
Or tread the mazy round his follow'rs trod,
And quitting sense call imitating God;
As Eastern priests in giddy circles run,
And turn their heads to imitate the SUD.
Here the two strains in Platonism,
which we distinguished
at
the outset of these lectures, have become completely sundered;
and one of them has overcome the other.
The idea of the
"way up," of the ascensiomentis ad Deum per sealascreaturarum,
has been abandoned.
Yet the main philosophic reason, if not,
perhaps,
the most potent motive, for its abandonment
lay in
the principle
of plenitude,
which had always been equally
characteristic.of
the Platonic
tradition.
And this deduction
from the principle
was, as I have already
intimated,
at the
least a consistent and plausible one.
If all the possihle links in
the chain
must be perpetually
represented
in the universe,
and if this consideration
was to be turned from a cosmological
generalization
into a moral imperative,
it naturally
seemed to
follow that the imitatio dei could be no business of man's, and
that any effort to ascend the scale must be an act of rebellion
against the divine purpose -
a crime against Nature.
The
doubt which might well have occurred -
but apparently
did
not
occur -
to those
who
reasoned
in
this manner
was
whether the completeness of the world might not be presumed
to be sufficiently assured by the Eternal Cause -
whether, if it
is necessary in the nature of things that the world should be an
unbroken
chain of being, it was likely that any link in the
chain couldleave its place, and thereby

in the full creation leave a void,
Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroyed.
2. The assumption of the mediocrity of man's position in the
universe, when thus applied
to his mental endowments,
con-
tained,
or might plausibly be construed
as containing,
a fur-
ther implication
which some of the gloomier or more tough-
minded spirits of the agedid
not fail to see: that a creature so
limited and so near to the other animals, in kind if not in kin-
ship, must necessarily be incapable
of attaining
any very high
level of political wisdom or virtue, and that consequently
no
great improvement
in men's political
behavior
or in the or-
ganization
of society could be hoped
for.
There
are, said
Soame Jenyns,
"numberless
imperfections
inherent
in all hu-
man governments,"
and these are"
imputable
only to the in-
feriority of man's
station
in the universe,
which necessarily
exposes him to natural and moral evils, and must, for the same
reason, to political
and religious;
which are indeed
but the
consequences
of the other.
Superior
beings may probably
form to themselves, or receive from their Creator, government
without
tyranny
and corruption;
...
but man cannot:
God
indeed may remove him into so exalted a Society, but whilst
he continues
to be man, he must be subject to innumerable
evils" -
such as "those grievous burdens of tyranny
and op-
pression, of violence and corruption,
of war and desolation,
under which all nations have ever groaned on account of gov-
ernment;
...
but which are so woven into the very essence of
all human governments
from the depravity
of man, that with-
out them none can be either established,
maintained
or ad-
ministered,
nor consequently
can they be prevented
without
changing
that
depravity
into perfection;
that
is, without
a
complete alteration
of human nature."
40 Hence, Jenyns con-
cludes, there never has been and never will be anygood form of
government.
Some, doubtless, are less bad than others; but
those who bitterly
indict
the existing order
and
dream
of
radically transforming
it forget this fundamental
truth -
that
"all these evils arise from the nature of things and the nature
of man, and not from the weakness or wickedness of particular
men,
or their
accidental
ascendency
in particular

ments: the degrees of them may indeed be owing to these, but
their existence is immutable."
41
An analogous inference from the conception
of the Chain of
Being, and of man's
place therein,
was drawn
by the same
writer with respect to religion.
Neither
by the light of nature
nor by revelation
can man expect to attain much clarity or cer-
tainty in religious knowledge:
God cannot impart knowledge to creatures, of which he himself has made
them incapable by their nature and formation:
he cannot instruct a mole
in astronomy or an oyster in music, because he has not given them members
or faculties necessary for the acquisition of those sciences: . . . a religion
therefore from God can never be such as we might expect from infinite
Power, Wisdom and Goodness, but must condescend to the ignorance and
infirmities of man:
was the wisest Legislator in the world to compose laws
for a nursery they must be childish laws: so was God to reveal a religion to
mankind,
tho' the Revealer was divine the Religion must be human,
and therefore liable to numberless imperfections."
The
principles
of plenitude
and
gradation
could,
in this
way, among their many uses, be made to serve the purposes of
a species of pessimistic
and backhanded
apologetic
both for
the political status quoand for the accepted religion.
They pro-
vided a damper for the zeal of the reformer.
Since men are not
and were not meant to be angels, let us cease to expect them to
behave as if they were; and let us avoid the error of imagining
that
by an alteration
of the form or mechanism
of govern-
ment we shall put an end to those limitations
of human nature
which are essentially unalterable,
because they are inherent
in
the scheme of the universe which required just such a creature,
as well as all other kinds, to make it "complete."
One of Jenyns's
critics, however, without denying the prem-
ises, detected,
as he thought,
a nonsequitur in the conclusion;
the argument,
he declared,
was" a mere quibble upon terms."
Doubtless
man could not expect"
a government
or religion
calculated
for the first order of created
beings";
and in that
sense any human
government
or religion
must be imperfect.
But there was no reason why man should not attain
a relative
perfection
in these respects -
"such
a government
and re-
ligion as shall be most expedient
for the purposes of that set of
beings for whose use they were instituted."
43

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
205
The critic unwittingly
put his finger here upon a significant
tacit assumption
in this and certain other applications
of the
principle.
It is the peculiarity
of man, these arguments
im-
plied, that while his powers and achievements
are limited by
the position which he occupies in the Scale of Being, he is ca-
pable of seeing beyond them and -
for better or worse -
of
feeling dissatisfaction
with them and therefore
with himself.
He is constitutionally
discontented
with his own nature
and
his place in the universal
nature;
and of this the saint, the
mystic, the Platonic or the Stoic moralist, and the reformer, in
their several ways gave evidence.
But here again the principle
of plenitude was subtly at war with itself. This perpetual
dis-
content of man with his present constitution
and status must
after all be one of the differentiae of his species, a characteristic
appropriate
to his place in the scale.
If it were not required by
that place, how could he have come to possess it?
But if it
were required,
it could not in consistency be condemned;
and
its existence at just this point in the best of possible worlds
might even be taken as an indication
that man, at least, was
not intended
to occupy forever the same place, that the scale
is literally a ladder to be ascended, not only by the imagina-
tion but in fact.
We shall presently see the argument
taking
this turn.
But the less cheerful interpreter
of the principle of
plenitude
could, no doubt, have replied that the specific and
defining defect of man consists precisely in his being the crea-
ture whose destiny it is to have visions of perfections which he
cannot
possess and of virtues which he is nevertheless
con-
stitutionally
incapable
of attaining.
For this too is one of the
possible kinds of creature;
must not, then, a full universe con-
tain even this tragic breed of Icarus?
Is not this, indeed, the
natural
and immutable
consequence of just that middle place
which was traditionally
assigned him -
a being at once of
flesh and spirit, an intermediate
species between
the purely
animal and the rational
kind?
3. There was more than one way, however, in which the prin-
ciples embodied in the cosmological conception of the Chain of
Being could be used as weapons against social discontent
and
especially against all equalitarian
movements.
The universe,
it was assumed, is the best of systems; any other system is good

206
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
only in so far as it is constructed upon the same principles; and
the object of the Infinite Wisdom which had fashioned it was
to attain
the maximum
of variety
by means of inequality.
Clearly, then, human society is well constituted only if, within
its own limits, it tends to the.realization of the same desiderata.
This was, of course, the point of the famous dictum of Pope's
which has so often been misapplied for the annoyance of little
boys and girls:
Order is Heav'n's first law; and this confest,
Some are, and must be, greater than the rest,
More rich, more wise.44
This was no casual piece of Toryism
on Pope's part;
that
"Order,"
that is, hierarchic gradation,
is everywhere required
by the divine Reason, is a fundamental
premise of the argu-
ment for optimism in the Essay on Man.
The doctrine of the
Chain of Being thus gave a metaphysical
sanction to the in-
junction
of the Anglican catechism:
each should labor truly
" to do his duty in that state of life" -
whether in the cosmical
or the social scale -
"to which it shall please God to call
him."
To seek to leave one's place in society is also" to invert
the laws of Order."
"Cease,
then, nor Order
imperfection
name."
Any demand
for equality, in short, is "contrary
to
nature."
Nor was Pope at all original in suggesting this politico-social
moral.
Leibniz had similarly pointed out the parallel between
the best of possible worlds and the best of possible societies:
Inequality of conditions is not to be counted among evils (disordres),and
M. Jacquelot rightly
ask~~hose who would have all things equally perfect,
why rocks are not crowned with leaves or why ants are not peacocks.
If
equality were everywhere requisite, the poor man would set up his claim to
it against the rich man, the valet against his master."
The argument
could, it is true, be worked from either end;
to those who needed no persuasion to believe that there must
be higher and lower ranks in society, this premise could be in-
voked to justify to man God's plan in the creation.
It was in
this latter way that Edmund
Law reasoned:
'Tis impossible all should be rulers and none subjects. From this example
we see how the relations which creatures have to one another may put a
restraint even on infinite Power, so that it will be a contradiction for them,

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
THOUGHT
207
while they keep the nature which they have at present, to be in some re-
spects otherwise disposed than they are now, nor can all of the same order
be gratified with the same conveniences.P
The analogy between the macrocosm and the social microcosm
was put still more fully and naively by Soame Jenyns:
The universe resembles a large and well-regulated
family, in which all
the officers and servants, and even the domestic animals, are subservient to
each other in a proper subordination;
each enjoys the privileges and per-
quisites peculiar
to his place, and at the same time contributes,
by that
just subordination,
to the magnificence and happiness of the whole.:"
While this analogy thus served to justify the complacency
of
those to whom the existing order of society was a very com-
fortable
one, it was, doubtless,
a relatively
small factor
in
political
thought
in the eighteenth
century.
And it is to be
remembered
that there was another implication of the accepted
scheme of the universe which qualified, though it did not con-
tradict,
this mode of conservative
apologetics.
Subordination,
indeed, was essential; but it was a subordination
without sub-
servience.
No creature's
existence, as we have seen, was merely
instrumental
to the well-being of those above it in the scale.
Each had its own independent
reason for being; in the final
account, none was more important
than any other; and each,
therefore, had its own claim to respect and consideration
from
its superiors, its own right to live its own life and to possess all
that might be needful to enable it to fulfill the functions and
enjoy" the privileges and perquisites"
of its station.
This dual
aspect of the conception
-
which still, it must be confessed,
remained
more gratifying
to the higher than consoling to the
lower ranks -
was duly set forth in verse of an appropriate
quality:
Wise Providence
Doesvarious
parts for various minds dispense;
The meanest slaves or they who hedge and ditch,
Are useful, by their sweat, to feed the rich;
The rich, in due return, impart their store,
Which comfortably feeds the lab'ring poor.
Nor let the rich the lowest slave disdain,
He's equally a link of nature's
chain;
Labours to the same end, joins in one view,
And both alike the will divine pursue.w

VII
THE PRINCIPLE
OF PLENITUDE
AND EIGHTEENTH-
CENTURY
OPTIMISM
THE
common
thesis of eighteenth-century
optimists
was, as is
notorious,
the
proposition
that
this is the
best of possible
worlds; and this fact, together
with the connotation
which the
term "optimism"
has come to assume in popular
usage, has
given rise to the belief that the adherents
of this doctrine
must
have been exuberantly
cheerful persons, fatuously blind to the
realities
of human
experience
and
of human
nature,
or in-
sensible to all the pain and frustration
and conflict which are
manifest
through
the entire
range
of sentient
life.
Yet there
was in fact nothing
in the optimist's
creed which logically re-
quired
him either to blink or to belittle the facts which we or-
dinarily
call evil.
So far from asserting
the unreality
of evils,
the
philosophical
optimist
in
the
eighteenth
century
was
chiefly occupied
in demonstrating
their
necessity.
To assert
that this is the best of possible worlds implies nothing
as to the
absolute goodness of this world;
it implies only that any other
world which is metaphysically
capable
of existence would be
worse.
The reasoning of the optimist was directed less to show-
ing how much of what men commonly
reckon good there is in
the world of reality than to showing how little of it there is in
the world of possibility -
in that eternal
logical order which
contains the Ideas of all things possible and compossible, which
the mind of God was conceived
to have contemplated
"before
the creation,"
and by the necessities of which, ineluctable
even
by Omnipotence,
his creative
power was restricted.
At bottom,
indeed,
optimism
had much
in common
with
that Manichaean
dualism, against Bayle's defence of which so
many of the theodicies were directed.
Optimism
too, as Leib-
niz acknowledged,
had its two antagonistic"
principles."
The
role of the"
evil principle"
was simply assigned to the divine
reason, which imposed singular impediments
upon the benevo-

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
209
lent intentions of the divine will. The very ills which Bayle had
argued must be attributed
to the interference
of a species of ex-
traneous
Anti-God,
for whose existence
and hostility
to the
good no rational
explanation
could
be given, were by the
optimist
attributed
to a necessity inhering
in the nature
of
things; and it was questionable
whether
this was not the less
cheerful view of the two.
For it was possible to hope that in the
fullness of time the Devil might be put under
foot, and be-
lievers in revealed religion were assured that he would be; but
logical necessities are eternal,
and the evils which arise from
them must therefore
be perpetual.
Thus
eighteenth-century
optimism not only had affinities with the dualism to which it
was supposed to be antithetic,
but the arguments
of its advo-
cates at times sounded strangely like those of the pessimist -
a
type by no means unknown
in the period.'
The moral was
different,
but the view of the concrete facts of experience was
sometimes very much the same; since it was the optimist's con-
tention that evil -
and a great deal of it -
is involved in the
general
constitution
of things, he found it to his purpose
to
dilate, on occasion, upon the magnitude
of the sum of evil and
upon the depth and breadth
of its penetration
into life.
It is
thus, for example,
that Soame Jenyns,
in one of the typical
theodicies of the middle of the century, seeks to persuade us of
the admirable
rationality
of the cosmic plan:
I am persuaded
that there is something in the abstract
nature of pain
conducive
to pleasure;
that
the sufferings of individuals
are
absolutely
necessary to universal happiness.
. ..
Scarce one instance, I believe, can
be produced of the acquisition of pleasure or convenience by any creatures,
which is not purchased by the previous or consequential sufferings of them-
selves or others.
Over what mountains of slain is every mighty empire rolled
up to the summit of prosperity and luxury, and what new scenes of desolation
attend its fall? To what infinite toil of men, and other animals, is every flour-
ishing city indebted for all the conveniences and enjoyments of life, and
what vice and misery do those veryequipments
introduce?
. . . The pleas-
ures annexed to the preservation of ourselves are both preceded and followed
by numberless sufferings;
preceded
by massacres and tortures of various
animals preparatory
to a feast, and followed by as many diseases lying wait
in every dish to pour forth vengeance on their destroyers.P
This gloomy rhetoric was perfectly consistent in principle with
optimism,
and it manifested
at least one natural
tendency
of

210
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
the champions
of that doctrine;
for the more numerous
and
monstrous
the evils to be explained,
the greater
was the tri-
umph when the author of a theodicy explained
them.
The argument,
indeed, in some of its more naive expressions
tends to beget in the reader a certain pity for an embarrassed
Creator,
infinitely well-meaning,
but tragically
hampered
by
"necessities
in the nature
of things"
in his efforts to make a
good world.
What could be more pathetic
than the position
in which -
as Soame
Jenyns
authoritatively
informs us -
Omnipotence
found itself when contemplating
the creation of
mankind?
Our difficulties arise from our forgetting how many difficulties Omnip-
otence has to contend with:
in the present instance it is obliged either to
afflict innocence or be the cause of wickedness; it has plainly no other option.!
In short the writings
of the optimists
afforded
abundant
ground for Voltaire's
exclamation:
Vous criez "Tout est bien" d'une voix lamentable!
Voltaire's
chief complaint
of these philosophers
in the Poemon
the Lisbon Disaster was not, as has often been supposed,
that
they were too indecently cheerful, that their view of the reality
of evil was superficial;
his complaint
was that they were too
depressing, that they made the actual evils we experience ap-
pear yet worse by representing
them as inevitable and inherent
in the permanent
structure
of the universe.
Non, ne presentez plus amon coeur agite
Ces immuables lois de la necessite l
An evil unexplained
seemed to Voltaire more endurable
than
the same evil explained,
when the explanation
consisted in
showing that from all eternity
the avoidance
of just that evil
had been, and through all eternity the avoidance of others like
it would be, logically inconceivable.'
In this his own feeling,
and his assumption
about
the psychology of the emotions in
other men, were precisely opposite to Spinoza's, who believed
that everything
becomes endurable
to us when we once see
clearly that it never could have been otherwise:
quatenusmens
res omnesut necessariesintelligit, eatenusminus ab affectibuspetitur, 5
Though
most of the optimistic
writers of the eighteenth
cen-

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
2 I I
tury were less thorough-going
or less frank in their cosmical
determinism
than
Spinoza,
such philosophic
consolation
as
they offered was at bottom the same as his.
It was an essen-
tially intellectual
consolation;
the mood that it was usually
designed' to produce was that of reasoned acquiescence
in the
inevitable,
based upon a conviction that its inevitableness
was
absolute and due to no arbitrary
caprice; or, at a higher pitch,
a devout willingness to be damned -
that is, to be as much
damned
as one was -
for the better
demonstration
of the
reasonableness
of the general scheme of things.
Whether
con-
fronted with physical or with moral evils, wrote Pope, "to rea-
son well is to submi t";
and again:
Know thy own point;
this kind, this due degree,
Of blindness, weakness, Heaven bestows on thee.
Submit!
It is, of course, true that the optimistic
writers were eager to
show that good comes out of evil; but what it was indispen-
sable for them to establish was that it could come in no other
way.
It is true, also, that they were wont, when they reached
the height of their argument,
to discourse with eloquence
on
the perfection
of the Universal
System as a whole;
but that
perfection in no way implied either the happiness or the excel-
lence of the finite parts of the system.
On the contrary,
the
fundamental
and characteristic
premise of the usual proof of
optimism was the proposition
that the perfection of the whole
depends upon, indeed consists in, the existence of every pos-
sible degree of imperfection
in the parts.
Voltaire, once more,
summarized
the argument
not altogether
unjustly
when he
wrote:
Vous composerez dans ce chaos fatal
Des malheurs de chaque etre un bonheur general.
The essence of the optimist's enterprise was to find the evidence
of the" goodness" of the universe not in the paucity but rather
in the multiplicity
of what to the unphilosophic
mind appeared
to be evils.
All this can best be shown by an analysis of the argument
in
its logical sequence, as it is set forth in the earliest and, perhaps,

2 I 2
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
when both its direct and indirect influence are considered,
the
most influential,
of eighteenth-century
theodicies -
the De
origins mali (1702) of William
King,
then
Bishop of Derry,
afterwards
Archbishop
of Dublin.
The original
Latin
work
does not appear
to have had wide currency;
but in
I 73 I an
English version appeared,"
with copious additions,
partly ex-
tracts from King's
posthumous
papers,
partly
original
notes
"tending
to vindicate
the author's
principles
against
the ob-
jections
of Bayle, Leibnitz,
the author
of a Philosophical
In-
quiry concerning
Human
Liberty, and others,"
by the transla-
tor,
Edmund
Law,
subsequently
Bishop
of Carlisle.
The
translation
went through five editions during Law's lifetime;
7
and it seems to have been much read and discussed.
Law was
a figure of importance
in his day, being the spokesman of" the
most latitudinarian
position"
in the Anglican
theology of the
time; and his academic
dignities as Master of Peterhouse
and
Knightbridge
Professor of Moral Philosophy
at Cambridge
in
the 1750'8 and 60'S doubtless
increased
the range
of his in-
fluence." There can hardly be much doubt that it was largely
from the original work of King that Pope derived, directly or
through
Bolingbroke,
the conceptions
which, rearranged
with
curious ineoherency,
served for his vindication
of optimism in
the First Epistle of the Essay on Man;
9 for it is unlikely that
Pope derived
them from their fountain-head,
the Enneads of
Plotinus.
It can by no means be said that King begins his reflection on
the subject by putting on rose-tinted
spectacles.
He recognizes
from the outset all the facts which seem most incompatible
with an optimistic view: the "perpetual
war between the ele-
ments, between animals, between men";
"the
errors, miseries
and vices" which are"
the constant companions
of human life
from its infancy";
the prosperity
of the wicked and the suffer-
ing of the righteous.
There are "troops
of miseries marching
through
human
life."
And King is innocent
of the- amazing
superficiality
of Milton's
theodicy;
while he, too, assumes the
freedom of the will, he sees clearly that this assumption
can
touch only a fraction of the problem.
Not all evils are" exter-
nal, or acquired
by our choice";
many of them proceed from
the constitution
of Nature
itself.!?
The dualistic
doctrine
of

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
2 13
Bayle, while it, too, has the advantage
of " acquitting
God of
all manner
of blame,"
is philosophically
an "absurd
hypothe-
sis."
King,
in short, is to attribute
evil, not -
at least not
primarily
nor chiefly -
either to the mysterious perversity
of
man's will or to the machinations
of the Devil; he is to show
its necessity from a consideration
of the nature
of deity itself.
His undertaking
is nothing less than that of facing all the evils
of existence and showing them to be "not only consistent with
infinite wisdom, goodness and power, but necessarily resulting
from them."
11
The traditional
division of evils into three classes -
evils of
limitation
or imperfection,
"natural"
evils, and moral evils -
provides
the general
scheme of the argument,
which
is, in
brief, that there could not conceivably have been any creation
at all without
the first sort of evil; and that all of the second
sort, at least, follow with strict logical necessity from the first.
Even Omnipotence
could not create
its own double;
if any
beings other than God were to exist they must in the nature of
the case be differentiated
from him through
the "evil of de-
fect" -
and,
as is assumed,
be differentiated
from one an-
other by the diversity of their defects.
Evil, in short, is prima-
rily privation;
and privation
is involved
in the very concept
of all beings except one.
This Law puts in the terms of Aris-
totelian
and Scholastic philosophy
in his summary
of King's
" scheme" :
All creatures
are necessarily imperfect, and at infinite distance from
the perfection of the Deity, and if a negative principle were admitted, such
as the Privation of the Peripatetics, it might be said.that every created being
consists of existence and non-existence;
for it is nothing in respect both of
those perfections which it wants, and of those which others have.
And this
...
mixture of non-entity in the constitution of created beings is the neces-
sary principle of all natural evils, and of a possibility of moral ones."
In other words, in King's own phrase, "a creature is descended
from God,
a most perfect
Father;
but from Nothing
as its
Mother,
which is Imperfection."
And the virtually
dualistic
character
of this conception
is shown by the fact that the in-
ferior parent,
in spite of the purely
negative
role which ap-
peared
to be implied
by her name,
was conceived
to be re-
sponsible for many seemingly highly positive peculiarities
of

2 14
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the offspring.
This, however, was felt to be an unobjectionable
dualism, partly because the second or evil principle
was called
"Nothing,"
and partly because its existence as a factor in the
world,
and
the effects of it, could
be regarded
as logically
necessary and not as a mysterious accident.
But the significant
issue did not lie in this simple, almost
tautological
piece of reasoning.
Doubtless,
if the Absolute
Being was not to remain forever in the solitude of his own per-
fection, the prime evil of limitation
or imperfection
must char-
acterize whatever other beings he brought forth.
But that evil
was not thereby justified unless it were shown, or assumed, that
the creation of such other, necessarily defective beings is itself a
good.
This crucial Plotinian
assumption
King unhesitatingly
makes, as well as a further
assumption
which seems far from
self-evident.
Even if it were granted
that it is good that some
beings other
than
God,
some finite and
imperfect
natures,
should exist, would it not (some might
ask) have been less
irrational
that only the highest grade of imperfection
should be
generated
-
as had, indeed, been originally the case, accord-
ing to an account of the creation
supported
by a considerable
weight of authority
in the theological tradition
of Christianity,
and comparatively
recently revived by Milton?
13 If God could
be supposed to need company
-
which it seemed philosophi-
cally a paradox
and was theologically
a heresy to admit -
should it not at least have been good company,
a civitas dei
composed wholly of pure spirits?
King saw no way of achiev-
ing a satisfactory
theodicy
unless this latter
question
were
answered
(again with the support
of/many
ancient
and me-
dieval writers) in the negative.
It was requisite
to show that
not only imperfection
in general, but everyone
of the observ-
able concrete imperfections
of the actual world, ought to have
been created;
and this could not be shown unless it were laid
down as a premise that it is inherently
and absolutely
good
that everykind of thing (however far down in the scale of pos-
sibles) should actually be, so far as its existence is logically con-
ceivable, i.e.,
involves no contradiction.
This proposition
then -
expressed in theological
terminol-
ogy -
was the essential thesis in the argument
for optimism
propounded
by King and Law.
There is inherent in the divine

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
2 I 5
essence, as an element in God's perfection,
a special attribute
of" goodness," which makes it necessary that all other and less
excellent essences down to the very lowest -
so far as they are
severally
and jointly
possible -
shall have
actual
existence
after their kind.
God might, indeed, have refrained
from creating,
and continued
alone,
self-sufficien t and perfect to all eterni ty; but his infinite Goodness would
by no means allow it; this obliged him to produce external things;
which
things, since they could not possibly be perfect, the Divine Goodness pre-
ferred imperfect
ones to none at all.
Imperfection,
then, arose from the
infinity of Divine Goodness."
And, thus committed
by his own nature
to the impartation
of
actual being to some imperfect essences, God could not refuse
the boon of existence to any:
If you say, God might have omitted the more imperfect beings, I grant it,
and if that had been best, he would undoubtedly
have done it.
But it is the
part of infinite Goodness to choose the very best; from thence it proceeds,
therefore,
that the more imperfect beings have existence;
for it was agree-
able to that, not to omit the very least good that could be produced.
Finite
goodness might possibly have been exhausted in creating the greater beings,
but infinite extends
to all. . . .
There
must then be many,
perhaps
in-
finite, degrees of perfection in the divine works. . ..
It was better not to
give some so great a degree of happiness as their natures might receive, than
that a whole species of being should be wanting to the world.P
Not only must all possible species enjoy existence, but, adds
King's editor, "from
the observation
that there is no manner
of chasm or void, no link deficient in this great Chain of Being,
and the reason of it, it will appear
extremely
probable
also
that every distinct order, every class or species, is as full as the
nature of it would permit, or [Law devoutly but, upon his own
principles,
tautologically
adds] as God saw proper."
The foundation,
then, of the usual eighteenth-century
argu-
ment for optimism
was the principle
of plenitude.
Since the
principle had received expression from hundreds
of writers be-
fore King, and had been the basis of both the Neoplatonic
and
the Scholastic theodicy,
its utilization
by later optimists is no
evidence that they derived it from him.
Nevertheless,
for rea-
sons already indicated,
the probability
remains that it was be-
cause of the reiteration
and elaboration
of the principle
in the

216
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
De origins mali that Pope gave the fundamental
place, in his
own argument
for the thesis that whatever
is is right, to the
premise that, in the"
best of systems possible,"
All must full or not coherent be,
And all that rises, rise in due degree.
For the purposes of a theodicy,
the principle
of plenitude
served most directly and obviously as an "explanation"
of the
"evil of defect."
The limitations
of each species of creature,
which define its place in the scale, are indispensable to that in-
finite differentiation
of things in which the "fullness"
of the
universe consists, and are therefore necessary to the realization
of the greatest
of goods.
Man,
therefore,
cannot
rationally
complain
because he lacks many endowments
and means of
enjoyment
which might conceivably have been granted
him.
In Law's words:
From the supposition of a Scale of Beings, gradually descending from per-
fection to nonentity, and complete in every intermediate rank and degree,
we shall soon see the absurdity of such questions as these, Why was not man
made more perfect?
Why are not his faculties equal to those of angels?
Since this is only asking why he was not placed in a different class of beings,
when at, the same time all other classes are supposed to be full.!"
It was, in short, "necessary
that the creature should fill the
station wherein it was, or none at all."
If he were anywhere
else, he would not be the same entity; and if he did not exist at
all, there would be a gap in the series, and the perfection of the
creation would thereby be destroyed.
Undeniably
these dis-
tinguishing
deficiencies "bring
many inconveniences
on the
persons whose lot it is to fill that part of the universe which
requires a creature of such an imperfect nature."
For example,
a man has no wings, a perfection granted
to birds.
'Tis plain that in his present circumstances he cannot have them, and
that the use of them would be very mischievous to society; and yet the want
of them necessarily exposes us to many inconveniences.
. . . A thousand
instances may be given where the evil of imperfection necessarily subjects
us to disappointment
of appetite, and several other natural evils, which yet
are all necessary for the common good."
To this particular
form of purely
logical consolation
Pope
recurs repeatedly,
with fairly evident dependence
upon King.

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
2 17
In a "full"
system "there
must be, somewhere, such a rank as
Man";
and the occupant
of that rank cannot rationally
desire
the distinctive attributes
of those below or those above him in
the scale."
Why has not man a microscopic eye?
For this plain reason, man is not a fly.
And (to repeat lines already quoted):
On superior powers
Were we to press, inferior might on ours;
Or in the full creation leave a void,
Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroyed."
But if the principle of plenitude had been applicable only for
the explanation
of the "metaphysical"
evil of limitation
or
particularity,
it would not have carried
the optimist
far to-
wards his goal.
Most of the things we call evil hardly appear
to be adequately
describable
as mere deficiencies.
Even a
Platonistic
philosopher
with a toothache
will probably
find it
difficult to persuade himself that his pain is a wholly negative
thing,
a metaphysical
vacuum
consisting
merely
in the ab-
sence of some conceivable
positive good.
King was therefore
forced to use some ingenuity -
or rather,
to utilize the in-
genuity
of his many
precursors -
in order
to exhibit
the
numerous
train of "natural"
evils as equally necessary impli-
cations of the same fundamental
principle.
He seeks to do this,
in the first place, on the ground
that in a really "full"
uni-
verse there must be opposition.
Creatures
necessarily crowd
upon, restrict,
and therefore come into conflict with, one an-
other.
This necessity appears in its primary
form in the mo-
tion of matter.
It was theoretically
possible for God to have so
disposed matter
that
it would move "uniformly
and all to-
gether, either in a direct line or in a circle, and the contrariety
of motions by that means be prevented."
But a material
sys-
tem so simple and harmonious
must also, we are assured, have
been barren
and useless.
Such a motion therefore was to be excited in it as would separate it into
parts, make it fluid, and render it an habitation for animals.
But that could
not be without contrariety
of motion, as anyone
that thinks of it at all will
perceive.
And if this be once admitted in matter, there necessarily follows

218
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
a division and disparity of parts, clashing and opposition,
comminution,
concretion and repulsion, and all those evils which we behold in generation
and corruption.
. . .
The mutual clashing of these concretions could there-
fore not be avoided, and as they strike upon oneanother
a concussion of the
parts and a separation
from each other would be necessarily produced,
. . . [i. e.] corruption.
20
And since man's place in the Scale of Being is that of a crea-
ture partly material, partly spiritual, he is necessarily involved
in, and unhappily
affected by, these collisions of matter.
The
preoccupation
of the optimists with the notion of the"
full-
ness" of the organic world sometimes led them (by a natural
confusion of ideas) to draw
an almost Darwinian
or Mal-
thusian
picture
of a Nature
overcrowded
with aspirants
for
life and consequently
given over to a ubiquitous
struggle for
existence.
King assures us that there is something like a hous-
ing problem even in Heaven.
If you ask why God does not immediately
transplant
men into heaven,
since 'tis plain they are capable of that happier state;
or why he confines
them so long . . . on the earth as in a darksome prison,
. . . I answer,
Because the Heavens are already
furnished with inhabitants,
and cannot
with convenience admit of new ones, till some of the presentpossessors
de-
part to a better state, or make room some other way for these to change
their condition. 21
Into the further naive reasonings by which King seeks to de-
duce the genesis of" pain, uneasiness and dread of death,"
and
indirectly of the other emotions by which man is tormented,
we need not enter.
It suffices to quote the concise genealogy
of woes in which he sums up his reasons for holding this to be
the best of possible worlds:
Behold how evils spring from and multiply upon each other, while infinite
Goodness still urges the Deity to do the very best.
This moved him to give
existence to creatures, which cannot exist without imperfections and inequal-
ity.
This excited him to create matter,
and to put it in motion, which is
necessarily attended
with separation
and dissolution, generation
and cor-
ruption.
This persuaded him to couple souls with bodies, and to give them
mutual
affections, whence proceeded
pain and sorrow, hatred
and fear,
with the rest of the passions, yet all of them ...
are necessary."
Such an argument for optimism closely resembles, and might
easily be substituted [or, some of the formulas in which primi-
tive Buddhism summed up the creed of pessimism.

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
219
"fhe author of the most popular English theodicy of the mid-
nineteenth
century
found,
as everyone
remembers,
peculiar
difficulty in the spectacle of "Nature
red in tooth and claw
with ravin"
-
in the universal conflict, the daily and hourly
cruelties and little, dumb tragedies which are hidden
behind
the surface beauty of every field and wood.
But to the typical
eighteenth-century
writer of a theodicy, even these aspects of
Nature gave little trouble.
He was no more blind to them than
Tennyson;
but his universal solvent, the principle of plenitude,
served him here as elsewhere.
Doubtless, King granted,
God
could have made a world free from these horrors, simply by
refraining from creating carnivorous
and predacious
animals.
But this, again, would have meant a world less full of life.
A being that has life is (caeterisparibus) preferable to one that has not;
God, therefore, animated
that machine which furnishes out provision for
the more perfect animals;
which was both graciously and providently
done: for by this means he gained so much life to the world as there is in
those animals which are food for others; for by this means they themselves
enjoy some kind of life, and are of service also to the rest. . ..
Matter
which is fit for the nourishment of man, is also capable of life; if therefore
God had denied it life, he had omitted a degree of good which might have
been produced without any impediment to his principal design, which does
not seem very agreeable to infinite goodness.
'Tis better, therefore, that
it should be endowed with life for a time, though 'tis to be devoured after-
wards, than to continue totally stupid and unactive.
. . .
Let us not be
surprised, then, at the universal war as it were among animals, or that the
stronger devour the weaker. 23
The application
of this to the special case of domesticated
ani-
mals reared
for slaughter,
which
furnished
Pope with
the
theme for some characteristic
and detestable
lines, was also
made by King.
Man
Feasts the animal he dooms his feast,
And, till he ends the being.makes
it blest.
Undeniably
the carnivora
were among
the antecedently
possible kinds of creatures;
and if the excellence of Nature or
its Author
consists quite simply in having as many kinds as
possible, nothing more need be said in justification
of the exist-
ence of such animals;
in the words of another
contemporary
divine, quoted with admiration
by Law, "it is evident that by
this means there is room for more whole species of creatures

220
THE
GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
than there otherwise would be, and that the variety of the crea-
tion is thereby
very much
enlarged
and
the goodness of its
Author
displayed."
24 The tendency
of the theodicies to pro-
mote belief in the blessedness of sheer multitude,
the all-im-
portance
of having an abundance
of" different natures"
in the
world, at whatever
cost, could hardly be better illustrated.
But even if the criterion of the goodness of the universe were
assumed to consist, not solely in the diversity of creatures,
but
in the quantity
of the joie de vivre it contains,
the creation
of
beasts of prey could still, according
to a further
argument
of
King's,
be justified.
"Animals
are of such a nature
as to de-
light in action, or in the exercise of their faculties, nor can we
have
any other
notion
of happiness
even in God himself."
But among
the pleasurable
activities
conceivable
before the
creation
were those which might
attach
to the procuring
of
food by predatory
creatures.
Why, then, should these intense
and positive pleasures
be lacking,
merely
that
feebler kinds
might
be spared
the transitory'
pains of being pursued
and
eaten?
Clearly, since"
the infinite Power of God was able to
produce
animals of such capacities,"
his" infinite Goodness"
may"
be conceived to have almost compelled him not to refuse
or envy (them)
the benefit of life."
"If you insist,"
says the
archbishop
genially
to a supposititious
critic,
"that
a lion
might have been made without
teeth or claws, a viper with-
out venom;
I grant
it, as a knife without
an edge; but then
they would
have
been of quite
another
species [i. e., there
would have been a missing link in the Chain of Being], and
have had neither
the nature,
nor use, nor genius, which they
now enjoy."
As for the lion's victim, if it were a rational
ani-
mal it doubtless would, or at all events should, rejoice as does
its Maker
in the thought
of the agreeable
exercise which it is
affording
the "genius"
of the lion.
If the victim be not en-
dowed
with reason,
or be too mean-spirited
to take a large
philosophical
view of the matter,
the consoling insight into the
higher meaning of its sufferings is still, through
the happy or-
dering
of things,
left to be enjoyed
vicariously
by optimistic
archbishops.
25
Plainly
this amiable
and
devout
ecclesiastic
had,
in the
course
of his endeavor
to justify
God's
ways to men,
been

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTI~1ISM
221
driven not only to a conception
of God but also to a concep-
tion of ultimate values which came somewhat strangely from a
Christian
teacher.
Though
King would, of course, have said
that his God was a God of love, the term must necessarily have
had for him an unusual sense. The God of the De originemali
loved abundance
and variety of life more than he loved peace
and concord among his creatures
and more than he desired
their exemption from pain.
He loved lions, in short, as well as
lambs; and loving lions, he wished them to behave in accord-
ance with the" nature,"
or Platonic Idea, of a lion, which im-
plies devouring lambs and not lying down with them.
And in
these preferences the "goodness"
of God was assumed to be
most clearly manifested -
"goodness"
thus meaning chiefly a
delight in fullness and diversity of finite being, rather than in
harmony and happiness.
King and his editor seem only occa-
sionally and confusedly aware how deeply their argument
has
involved them in such a radical transvaluation
of values; they
waver between this and the more conventional
conception
of
"divine
goodness,"
and for the most part touch but lightly
upon
the more
paradoxical
implications
of their
premises.
Yet they at times betray
some uneasy feeling of the incon-
gruity between these premises and certain traditional
elements
of Christian
belief.
It was, for example,
a part of that belief
that in the earthly
paradise
before the Fall, and also in the
celestial paradise
which
awaits the elect, most of the evils
which these theologians were zealously proving to be "neces-
sary," because required by the" divine goodness," were in fact
absent.
It seemed, therefore, difficult to avoid the awkward
dilemma that either the paradisaical
state is not good, or else a
good"
system"
does not, after all, require quite so much evil
and so many degrees of imperfection
as the authors
of the
theodicies
conceived.
King meets this difficulty but lamely;
he is, in fact, driven to suggest that the felicity of our first
parents in Eden has probably
been somewhat
exaggerated:
"it
doth not appear
that
Adam in Paradise
was altogether
without pain or passion," but rather"
that he was only secured
from such pains as might cause his death, and that for a time,
till removed to a better place."
26
The outcome of King's reasoning (so far as it was consist-

222
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
ently carried
through)
is not, of course, surprising.
He who
attempts
a theodicy without
first shutting
his eyes to a large
range of the facts of experience,
must necessarily take for the
object of his piety the God of Things as They Are; and since
things as they are include the whole countless troop of natural
ills, it became
necessary
so to transform
the conception
of
good as to make it possible to argue that these ills are -
not,
indeed,
goods, considered
by themselves,
but implicates
of
some supreme good, in the realization
of which the essential
nature
of deity is most truly
manifested.
The principle
of
plenitude,
taken as a species of value-theory,
was a natural,
if
not the necessary, result of this enforced revision of the notion
of good.
Certainly
that which the author
of Nature
as it is
chiefly values could not, on empirical grounds, be supposed to
be identical with those things which men have commonly set
their hearts upon
and have pictured
to themselves in their
dreams of paradise.
Stated in its most general terms, the para-
dox underlying
all these singular implications
of the optimist's
reasoning is the assumption which is of the essence of the prin-
ciple of plenitude
itself -
that the desirabilityof a thing's exist-
encebearsno relationto its excellence.
King's further reflections upon the problem
of evil do not
concern us here, since the conception
of the Chain of Being
does not much figure in them.
It might,
indeed,
and with
more consistency, have done so. For the sort of evil not dealt
with by King upon the principles already indicated,
namely,
moral evil, might naturally
have been regarded
as a special
case of the" evil of defect."
A creature having the specific de-
gree of blindness and weakness appropriate
to man's place in
the scale, and at the same time subject to the passions which
King had represented
as necessarily inseparable
from our psy-
chophysical
constitution,
could hardly fail, it would seem, to
make frequent"
wrong elections."
So much, indeed, King is
constrained
to admit;
there are many errors of conduct which
are due to our ignorance
and
necessary
imperfection,
and
these are to be classed among
the "natural
evils"
and ex-
plained in the same manner
as others of that class. But there
remains a residuum of" moral evil" not so explicable, but due
to a "depraved
will."
On this theme King for the most part

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
223
repeats the familiar arguments.
Bolingbroke did not follow the
archbishop
in this, but derived
the necessity of moral
evil
directly from the principle of plenitude.
If men had been so
constituted
as to follow always the ethical"
law of nature,
...
the moral state of mankind would have been paradisaical,
but
it would not have been human.
We should not have been the
creatures we were designed to be, and a gap would have been
left in the order of created intelligences."
27 In this application
of the principle,
the antinomian
implications
of which
are
sufficiently obvious, Bolingbroke
had been anticipated
by so
saintly a philosopher
as Spinoza:
To those who ask, Why has not God created all men such as to be di-
rected solely by the guidance of reason, I reply only that it is because he
had no lack of material wherewith to create all things, from the very high-
est to the very lowest grade
of perfection,
or, more properly
speaking,
because the laws of his nature were so ample as to suffice for the produc-
tion of everything that can be conceived by an infinite intellect.V
This was carrying a step farther the argument
which Pope was
to versify: since the best of systems must be as "full"
as pos-
sible,
Then in the scale of reasoning life, 'tis plain,
There must be somewhere such a rank as -
not man only, but also, among men, the fool and the evil-doer.
The theodicy of Leibniz was in most essentials the same as
that
of his English
precursor;
29 and in summarizing
with
approval
the main argument
of the archbishop's
bel ouorage,
plein de savoiret d'elegance,Leibniz significantly accentuated
the
theological paradox
contained
in it:
.
Why, someone asks, did not God refrain from creating
things altogether?
The author well replies that the abundance
of God's goodness is the reason.
He wished to communicate
himself, even at the expense of that delicacy
which our imaginations ascribe to him, when we assume that imperfections
shock him.
Thus he preferred that the imperfect should exist, rather than
nothing.t?
In this emphasis upon the implication
that the Creator of the
actual
world
cannot
be supposed
to be a "delicate"
or
squeamish
God,
caring
only for perfection -
and
that,
in

224
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
fact, he would, if more nicely selective in his act of creation,
have thereby shown himself the less divine -
the consequence
latent from the first in the principle of plenitude
is put with
unusual
vividness and candor;
and in general,
the German
philosopher, in developing the theory of value thus implicit in
optimism, is franker, more ardent, and more cheerful than the
Anglican
theologian.
Some analogies in human
life to the
standards of valuation
which the optimists had applied in ex-
plaining the supposed purpose of the deity in the creation are
not obscurely suggested by Leibniz.
Wisdom requires variety (la sagessedoit varier). To multiply exclusively
the same thing, however noble it be, would be a superfluity;
it would be
a kind of poverty.
To have a thousand well-bound copies of Vergil in your
library;
to sing only airs from the opera of Cadmus and Hermione;
to
break all your porcelain in order to have only golden cups; to have all
your buttons made of diamonds;
to eat only partridges and to drink only
the wine of Hungary or of Shiraz -
could anyone
call this reasonabler"
Something very similar to this had, in point of fact, been re-
garded as the essence of reasonableness
both by neo-classical
aesthetic theorists and by a multitude
of influential moralists.
It would scarcely have seemed evident to the former that two
copies of Vergil are of less value than one copy plus a copy of
the worst epic ever written -
still less that a reading
of the
first followed by a reading of the second is preferable
to two
readings of Vergil.
And the apparent
object of the endeavor
of most ethical teaching had been to produce a close approach
to uniformity in human character
and behavior, and in men's
political and social institutions.
The desire for variety -
or
for change, the temporal
form of it -
had rather
commonly
been conceived to be a non-rational,
indeed a pathological,
idiosyncrasy of human creatures.
But Leibniz not only gave it
a sort of cosmic dignity by attributing
it to God himself, but
also represented
it as the very summit of rationality.
The ethically significant consequence which is most plainly
drawn from, this by Leibniz is that neither what is commonly
called moral goodness, nor pleasure,
is the most important
thing in the world.
Both hedonism, in short, and an abstract
moralism (such, for example, as Kant and Fichte were after-
wards to express) were equally contrary
to the value-theory

EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
OPTIMISM
225
implicit in the principle of plenitude.
Virtue and happiness
both, of course, have their place in the scale of values; but if it
were the highest place, it is inconceivable
that God would
have made the kind of world he has made.
The moral or physical good or evil of rational creatures does not infinitely
transcend the good or evil which is purely metaphysical, that is to say, the
good which consists in the perfection of the other creatures.
. . .
No sub-
stance is either absolutely precious or absolutely contemptible
in the sight
of God.
It is certain that God attaches more importance to a man than to
a lion, but I do not know that we can be sure that he prefers one man to the
entire species of Iions.P
To this thesis Leibniz reverts again and again In the Thlo-
dicee:
[It is] a false maxim that the happiness of rational creatures is the sole
purpose of God.
If that had been so, there would, perhaps,
have been
neither sin nor unhappiness,
not even as concomitants.
God would have
chosen a set of possibles from which all evils were excluded.
But he would
in that case have fallen short of what is due to the universe, that is, what is
due to himself. . . .
It is true that one can imagine possible worlds with-
out sin and without suffering,just as one can invent romances about Utopias
or about the Sevarambes ; but these worlds would be much inferior to
ours.
I cannot show this in detail;
you must infer it, as I do, ab effectu,
since this world, as it is, is the world God chose. . . .
Virtue is the noblest
quality of created things, but it is not the only good quality of creatures.
There is an infinite variety of others that attract the inclination of God; it
is from all these inclinations taken together that the greatest possible sum
of good results; and there would be less good than there is if there were
nothing but virtue, if only rational creatures existed. . . .
Midas was less
rich when he possessed only gold."
Leibniz adds the trite aesthetic argument for the indispensa-
bility of contrasts in the production of beauty in a work of art,
and, indeed, in the mere physical pleasure of the gustatory
sense:
Sweet things become insipid if we eat nothing else; sharp, tart and even
bitter things must be combined with them so as to stimulate the taste.
He
who has not tasted bitter things does not deserve sweet, and, indeed, will
not appreciate them.
Thus these subtle philosophers and grave divines, and the
poets like Pope and Haller who popularized
their reasonings,

226
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
rested their assertion of the goodness of the universe ultimately
upon the same ground as Stevenson's child in the nursery:
The world is so full of a number of things.
This did not, it is true, necessarily make them"
as happy as
kings."
That was a matter of individual temperament;
and in
point of fact most of them had not the child's robust delight in
the sheer diversity and multiplicity
of things.
They were often
men whose natural
taste or training would have inclined them
rather
to prefer a somewhat
thin, simple, and exclusive uni-
verse.
The philosophers
of optimism were not, in short, as a
rule of a Romantic
disposition;
and what they were desirous
of proving was that reality is rational
through
and through,
that every fact of existence, however unpleasant,
is grounded
in some reason as clear and evident
as an axiom of mathe-
matics.
But in the exigencies of their argument
to this am-
bitious
conclusion,
they
found
themselves
constrained
to
attribute
to the Divine Reason a conception
of the good ex-
tremely
different
from that
which
had
been
most current
among men, and frequently
among philosophers;
and they
were thus led, often against their original temper and inten-
tion, to impress upon the minds of their generation
a revolu-
tionary and paradoxical
theory of the criterion
of all value,
which may be summed up in the words of a highly Romantic
and optimistic lover of paradox
in our own day:
One thing alone is needful: Everything.
The rest is vanity of vanities.
The results did not become fully apparent
until the closing
decade of the century.
34 Before we turn to them, we must note
certain other new developments
which had been taking place
in the meantime
in the history of our three principles.

THE CHAIN OF BEING AND SOME ASPECTS OF
EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
No HISTOR\'
of the biological sciences in the eighteenth century
can be adequate which fails to keep in view the fact that, for
most men of science throughout
that period, the theorems im-
plicit in the conception of the Chain of Being continued to con-
stitute
essential presuppositions
in the framing
of scientific
hypotheses.
But in those sciences, as in other provinces of
thought, certain implications which had always been latent in
these ancient assumptions now came to be more clearly recog-
nized and more rigorously applied.
In the present lecture we
shall briefly note three aspects of eighteenth-century
biological
theory in which it was either affected by the general accept-
ance of the principles of continuity and plenitude, or in its turn
tended to bring about a new interpretation
of those principles.
A still more important
connection between the two will come
before us in the following lecture.'
I.
We have seen that there were present in the logic and the
natural history of Aristotle, and therefore of the later Middle
Ages, two opposite modes of thought.
The first made for sharp
divisions, clear-cut
differentiations,
among
natural
objects,
and especially among living beings.
To range animals and
plants in well-defined species, presumably
(since the Platonic
dualism of realms of being was also still influential) correspond-
ing to the distinctness of the Eternal Ideas, was the first busi-
ness of the student of the organic world.
The other tended to
make the whole notion of species appear
a convenient
but
artificial setting-up of divisions having no counterpart
in na-
ture.
It was, on the whole, the former tendency that prevailed
in early modern biology.
In spite of the violent reaction of the
astronomy, physics, and metaphysics of the Renaissance against
the Aristotelian
influence, in biology the doctrine of natural
species continued to be potent -
largely, no doubt, because it

228
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
seemed to be supported
by observation.
"It
is principally
from Aristotle,"
observes Daudin,
"that
are derived the tra-
ditional notions to which natural
history was to give applica-
tion, beginning
with the Renaissance.
. ..
Thus it was that
from the end of the sixteenth to the end of the eighteenth
cen-
tury, the project
of distributing
all living beings, animal
or
vegetable,
into a hierarchy
of collective
units enclosed one
within another,
gained
such a hold upon naturalists,
that it
finally
seemed
to them
the
formulation
of their
scientific
task."
The first of the great modern
systematists,
Cesalpino,
was a sixteenth-century
enthusiast
for the Peripatetic
phi-
losophy, and it seems to have been largely a fresh study of
Aristotle's logical and scientific writings that set him upon the
undertaking
which he executed in his De Plantis (1583).
It is
true that most of the elaborate"
systems" (as they were called)
which
were
the
most
monumental
products
of biological
science in the seventeenth
and early eighteenth
centuries, were
avowedly,
in great part,
"artificial"
classifications.
But the
assumption
that there really are"
natural
species, established
by the Author of Nature"
continued
to be generally held; and
natural
species were, of course, fixed species.
And even the
artificial systems tended to give the notion of species a peculiar
prominence
in scientific thought,
to encourage
the habit
of
thinking of organisms, and of other natural
objects, as falling
into well-differentiated
classes, rather
than as members
of a
qualitative
continuum.
There
were, nevertheless,
at work in the thought
of both
these centuries
two ideas which
tended
increasingly
to dis-
credit
the whole notion
of species.
The first, which is less
closely related to our general subject, was the semi-nominalis-
tic strain in the philosophy of Locke.
In the Sixth Chapter
of
Book III
of the Essay concerning Human Understanding he had
granted that there are "real essences" -
by which he chiefly
meant"
natures"
or attributes
of which the" ideas" imply the
ideas of other attributes necessarily and apriori, so that one such
"nature"
is intrinsically incapable of separation
from another.
In so far as this is the case, there arise class-concepts of which
the definitions are inherent
in the nature
of things, not arbi-
trary and contingent.f
With these real essences Locke believed

ASPECTS OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
229
that
the Creator
certainly
must be, and the angels possibly
may be, acquainted;
but to us mortals knowledge of them has
(with the exception of the essences of mathematical
figures and
perhaps of moral properties)
not been imparted;
and our con-
ceptions of species are therefore
merely"
nominal
essences,"
combinations
of ideas of attributes
put together
by the mind
and corresponding
to no fixed objective and inherent
division
between natural
things.
"Our
distinguishing
substances into
species by names is not at all founded on their real essences;
nor can we pretend
to range and determine
them exactly into
species, according
to essential internal
differences."
3
"I
do
not deny,"
says Locke, "but
nature,
in the constant
produc-
tion of particular
beings, makes them
not always new and
various, but very much alike and of kin to one another;
but I
< think it nevertheless true that the boundaries
of species, where-
by men sort them, are made by men."
And thus biological
classifications
are but
verbal,
and
relative
to varying
con-
siderations
of convenience
in the use of language.
Locke is
unable
to see "why
a shock [a breed of shaggy dog] and a
hound are not as distinct species as a spaniel and an elephant,"
. . . "so uncertain
are the boundaries
of species of animals to
us."
4 Even the nominal
essence "man"
is a term of vague
and fluctuating
import,
which cannot
be supposed
to corre-
spond to "precise
and unmovable
boundaries
set by nature."
It is, in fact, "plain
that there is no such thing made by na-
ture, and established by her amongst men."
5 It is, then, only
by virtue of some arbitrary
definition framed by us "that
we
can say: This is a man, this is a drill,"
6 i. e., a baboon;
"and
in this, I think, consists the whole business of genusand species."
But it is evident from much that has been already said that
the principle of continuity
tended equally directly to the same
conclusion;
and it did so even more potently because it had a
still greater
body of tradition
behind it, and because both of
the philosophers who exercised most influence in the early and
middle eighteenth
century,
Leibniz and Locke, had made so
much of it. The result was a rejection of the concept of species
by some of the greatest naturalists
of that age.
Buffon in the
opening discourse of the HistoireNaturelle (1749) attacked
the
entire
enterprise
of the systematists.
There
is, he declared,

230
THE GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
"an
error in metaphysics"
underlying
all attempts
to find a
"natural"
definition
of species and
thereby
to arrive
at a
"natural"
system of classification.
"The
error consists in a
failure to understand
nature's
processes (marche),which always
take place by gradations
(nuances).. ..
It is possible to de-
scend by almost insensible degrees from the most perfect crea-
ture
to the most formless matter.
. ..
These
imperceptible
shadings are the great work of nature;
they are to be found not
only in the sizes and the forms, but also in the movements,
the
generations
and the successions of every species. . ..
[Thus]
nature,
proceeding
by unknown
gradations,
cannot
wholly
lend herself to these divisions
[into genera
and species] ....
There
will be found a great number
of intermediate
species,
and of objects belonging
half in one class and half in another.
Objects of this sort, to which it is impossible to assign a place,
necessarily
render
vain the attempt
at a universal
system."
The notion of species, then, Buffon concludes,
is an artificial
and for the biologist a mischievous
one:
In general, the more one increases the number of one's divisions, in the
case of the products of nature,
the nearer one comes to the truth;
since in
reality individuals
alone exist in nature."
Buffon, it is true, soon abandoned
this position.
In the in-
fertility of hybrids he imagined
that he had found a proof that
species are objective and fundamental
realities -
are, indeed,
"les seuls ctres de la Nature, as ancient
and
as permanent
as
Nature
herself,"
while"
an individual,
of whatever
species, is
nothing
in the universe."
A species is "a whole independent
of number,
independent
of time; a whole always living, always
the same; a whole which was counted as one among the works
of the creation,
and therefore
constitutes
a single unit in the
creation."
8 Though
he subsequently
wavered
somewhat
on
this matter,
his supposed discovery of a scientific test of differ-
ence of " real"
species did much for a time to counteract
the
tendency
to which he had at first given his powerful support.
9
But Bonnet took up the strain which Buffon had abandoned.
Repeating
the customary
phraseology
about the continuity
of
the chain, Bonnet unequivocally
draws the consequence
that
there are no such things as species:

ASPECTS OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
231
If there are no cleavages in nature, it is evident that our classifications
are not hers.
Those which we form are purely nominal, and we should
regard them as means relative to our needs and to the limitations of our
knowledge.
Intelligences higher than ours perhaps recognize between two
individuals which we place in the same species more varieties than we
discover between two individuals of widely separate genera.
Thus these
intelligences see in the scale of our world as many steps as there are in-
dividuals.l''
Goldsmith, who, it will be remembered,
was the author of a
popular compendium
of natural
history, adopted
and helped
to diffuse this doctrine of the scientific inadmissibility
of the
concept of species: all" divisions" among the objects of nature
" are perfectly arbitrary.
The gradation from one order of be-
ings to another, is so imperceptible,
that it is impossible to lay
the line that shall distinctly mark the boundaries of each.
All
such divisions as are made among the inhabitants
of this globe,
like the circles drawn by astronomers
on its surface, are the
work, not of nature,
but of ourselves."
11
Numerous
other
illustrations
might be given, but it would be tedious to mul-
tiply them.
Thus the general habit of thinking
in terms of species, as
well as,the sense of the separation of man from the rest of the
animal creation,
was beginning
to break down in the eight-
eenth century.
In an age in which, more than in any preced-
ing period, the principle of continuity was reckoned among the
first and fundamental
truths,
it could not have been other-
wise. And the change was a pregnant
one for science and for
other provinces of thought.
2.
Even for those biologists who did not explicitly reject the
belief in natural
species, the principle
of continuity
was not
barren of significant consequences.
It set naturalists
to look-
ing for forms which would fill up the apparently
"missing
links" in the chain.
Critics of the biological form of this as-
sumption
attacked
it largely on the ground
that many links
which the hypothesis required weremissing.
But the more ac-
cepted view was that these gaps are only apparent;
they were
due, as Leibniz had declared, only to the incompleteness of the
knowledge of nature
then attained,
or to the minute size of
many of the -
presumably
lower -
members
of the series.
The metaphysical
assumption
thus furnished
a program
for

232
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
scientific research.
It was therefore highly stimulating
to the
work of the zoologist and the botanist, and especially to that of
the microscopist, in the eighteenth
century.
Every discovery of
a new form could be regarded, not as the disclosure of an addi-
tional unrelated
fact in nature, but as a step towards the com-
pletion of a systematic structure of which the general plan was
known in advance,
an additional
bit of empirical
evidence of
the truth
of the generally
accepted
and cherished
scheme of
things.
Thus the theory of the Chain of Being, purely specula-
tive and traditional
though it was, had upon natural
history in
this period an effect somewhat similar to that which the table
of the elements and their atomic weights has had upon chemi-
cal research in the past half-century.
The general program
of
the Royal
Society, wrote its first historian
(1667), in an in-
teresting
passage in which Platonistic
and Baconian
motives
are conjoined, was to discover unknown facts of nature in order
to range them properly in their places in the Chain of Being,
and at the same time to make this knowledge useful to man.
Such is the dependence
amongst all the orders of creatures;
the animate,
the sensitive, the rational,
the natural,
the artificial;
that the apprehension
of one of them, is a good step towards the understanding
of the rest.
And
this is the highest pitch of humane
reason:
to follow all the links of this
chain, till all their secrets are open to our minds;
and their works advanc'd
or imitated
by our hands.
This is truly to command
the world;
to rank all
the varieties and degrees of things so orderly upon one another;
that stand-
ing on the top of them, we may perfectly behold all that are below, and make
them all serviceable to the quiet and peace and plenty of Man's life. And
to this happiness
there can be nothing
else added:
but that
we make a
second advantage
of this rising ground,
thereby
to look the nearer
into
heaven ....
12
The Encyclopidie in the middle
of the eighteenth
century
also, though in a less devout tone, dwelt upon this as the pro-
gram of the advancement
of knowledge:
Since"
everything in
nature
is linked together,"
since"
beings are connected
with
one another by a chain of which we perceive some parts as con-
tinuous, though in the greater number of points the continuity
escapes us," the" art of the philosopher consists in adding new
links to the separated parts, in order to reduce the distance be-
tween them as much as possible.
But we must not flatter our-
selves that gaps will not still remain
in many places."
13 It

ASPECTS OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
233
was, in the eyes of the eighteenth
century,
a great moment
in
the history of science when Trembley
in 1739 rediscovered
the
fresh-water
polyp
Hydra (it had
already
been observed
by
Leeuwenhoek),
this creature
being at once hailed as the long-
sought missing link between plants and animals -
for which
Aristotle's
vague zoophytes
were no longer considered
quite
sufficient.
This
and
similar
discoveries
in turn
served
to
strengthen
the faith
in plenitude
and
continuity
as a priori
rational
laws of nature;
and the greater
credit,
it was some-
times remarked,
was due to those who, not having seen, yet
had believed in these principles.
The chief glory, said a Ger-
man
popularizer
of science, aproposof Trembley's
work, is
that "of the German
Plato [Leibniz], who did not live to know
of the actual observation"
of this organism,
"yet through
his
just confidence
in the fundamental
principles
which
he had
learned
from
nature
herself,
had
predicted
it
before
his
death."
14
The
quest
of organisms
not yet actually
observed
which
would fill these lacunae was prosecuted with especial zeal at two
points in the scale: near the bottom of it, and in the interval
between man and the higher apes.
"Nature,"
remarked
Bon-
net, "seems to make a great leap in passing from the vegetable
to the fossil [i, e., rock]; there are no bonds, no links known to
us, which unite the vegetable
and the mineral kingdoms.
But
shall we judge
of the chain of beings by our present
knowl-
edge?
Because we discover some interruptions,
some gaps in it
here and there, shall we conclude that these gaps are real? ...
The gap that we find between the vegetable
and the mineral
will apparently
some day be filled up.
There
was a similar
gap between the animal and the vegetable;
the polyp has come
to fill it and to demonstrate
the admirable
gradation
there is
between all beings,"
But the program
of discovering
the hitherto
unobserved
links in the chain played a part of especial importance
in the
beginnings
of the science of anthropology.
The
close simi-
larity in skeletal structure
between the apes and man had early
been made familiar;
yet careful zoologists recognized apparent
solutions of continuity,
anatomical
as well as psychological,
in
this region of the series.
Leibniz
and Locke had asserted
a

234
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
greater
degree of continuity
than could yet be actually
ex-
hibited at this important
point.
It therefore became the task
of science at least to increase the rapprochementof man and ape.
"In
the first phase of this quest,"
as a German
historian
of
eighteenth-century
anthropology
has pointed
out, "the
miss-
ing link was sought at the lower limits of humanity
itself.
It
was held to be not impossible that among the more remote
peoples semi-human
beings might be found such as had now
and then been described in traveller's
narratives.
Some voy-
agers testified to having seen with their own eyes men with
tails; others had encountered
tribes incapable
of speech."
15
Linnaeus mentions a homotroglodytesconcerning
whom it was
not established
with certainty
whether
he was more nearly
related to the pygmy or the orang-outang;
and a writing of his,
not published until long after his death, is entitled
The Cousins
of Man and speaks of the apes as the" nearest relations of the
human
race."
16
This
preoccupation
with
the question
of
man's
relation
to the anthropoids
gave an especial "philo-
sophical"
interest to the rather
numerous
descriptions of the
Hottentots
by late seventeenth-
and early eighteenth-century
voyagers.
They were probably
the "lowest"
savage races
thus far known; and more than one writer of the period saw in
them a connecting
link between
the anthropoids
and homo
sapiens. An. English essayist of
I 7I 3, observing, in the usual
fashion, how"
surprising
and delightful
it is" to trace"
the
scale or gradual ascent from minerals to man,"
adds:
'Tis easy to distinguish these Kinds, till you come to the highest one, and
the lowest of that next above it; and then the Difference is so nice, that the
Limits and Boundaries of their Species seem left unsettled by Nature
to
perplex the curious, and to humble the proud Philosopher.
. . .
The Ape
or the Monkey that bears the greatest Similitude to Man, is the next Order
of Animals below him.
Nor is the Disagreement
between the basest In-
dividuals of our species and the Ape or Monkey so great, but that, were the
latter endow'd with the Faculty of Speech, they might perhaps as justly
claim the Rank and Dignity of the human Race, as the savage Hotentot,or
stupid native of Nova Zembla.
. . .
The most perfect of this Order
of
Beings, the Orang-Outang,as he is called by the natives of Angola, that is the
Wild Man, or the Man of the Woods, has the Honour of Bearing the greatest
Resemblance
to Human Nature.
Tho' all that Species have some Agree-
ment with us in our Features, many instances being found of Men of Monkey
Faces; yet this has the greatest Likeness, not only in his Countenance,
but

ASPECTS OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
235
in the Structure of his Body, his Ability to walk upright, as well as on all
fours, his Organs of Speech, his ready Apprehension,
and his gentle and
tender Passions, which are not found in any of the Ape Kind, and in various
other respects. 17
Later
Rousseau
(1753) and
after
him
Lord
Monboddo
(1770) took the further
step of asserting
that
man
and the
higher apes (the orang-outang
or chimpanzee)
are of the same
species, language
being not originally"
natural
to man,"
but
an art which
one variety
of this species has gradually
de-
veloped.'"
Thus at this point, at least, the continuity
of the
series was already
being construed
genetically.
Bonnet, too,
though a devout theologian
as well as a great naturalist,
did
not hesitate to intimate
a doubt whether man and ape are dis-
tinct species.
The wide interval which separates man from the true quadrupeds
is
filled by the apes and the animals which most nearly approximate
them,
of which the species are minutely graduated (tres-nuancees).. . • We ascend
as it were by so many steps to a superior or principal species which so closely
resembles man that he has received' the name of orang-outang,or savage man.
It is here above all that it is impossible to fail to recognize the graduated
progression of beings; it is here above all that is verified the famous axiom
of the German
Plato, Nature makes no leaps. . • .
The contemplator
of
Nature arrives with surprise at a being resembling man so nearly, that the
characters which distinguish them seem less the characters of species than
of mere varieties.
For, as Bonnet goes on to observe, the orang-outang
has the
size, the members,
the carriage,
the upright
posture, of man;
he is "entirely
destitute
of a tail,"
but has"
a regular
face,"
un vrai visage; is intelligent
enough to use sticks and stones as
weapons;
is even "susceptible
of education,
to the point of
acquitting
himself creditably
of the functions
of a valet de
chambre"; and can acquire many other modes of behavior
-
including
even a sort of politeness -
which have been sup-
posed to be peculiar
to man.
Whether,
in short, we compare
his mind or his body with ours, "we are astonished to see how
slight and how few are the differences, and how manifold and
how marked
are the resemblances."
19
By 1760 the triumphs
of the missing-link hunters were being
celebrated
in verse:

THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
Tous les corps sont lies dans la chaine de
l'~tre.
La Nature partou t se precede et se suit.
. .
Dans un ordre constant ses pas developpes
Ne s'emportent jamais a des bonds escarpes.
De l'homme aux animaux rapprochant
la distance,
Voyez l'Homme
des Bois lier leur existence.
Du corail incertain, ne plante et mineral,
Revenez au Polype, insecte vegeta1.20
From at least the middle of the eighteenth
century
to the
time of Darwin this hunt for missing links continued
to engage
not only the interest of specialists in natural
history but also
the curiosity of the general public.
On the last point a piece of
conclusive evidence may be cited.
No one was ever a better
judge of what the public wanted
than that eminent practical
psychologist,
P. T. Barnum;
and it appears
that one of the
things that the public wanted in the early eighteen-forties
-
that
is, nearly
two decades
before
the publication
of The
Origin of Species-
was missing links.
For we are told that the
great showman in 1842advertised among the attractions
of his
Museum, in addition
to the" preserved body of a Feejee Mer-
maid,"
other scientific specimens, such as "the
Ornithorhin-
cus, or the connecting link between the seal and the duck; two
distinct species of flying fish, which undoubtedly
connect the
bird and the fish; the Siren, or Mud Iguana,
a connecting link
between the reptiles and fish, ...
with other animals forming
connecting
links in the great chain of Animated
Nature."
21
We may be pretty sure that if Aristotle had been permitted
to
return to the sublunary
scene in the eighteen-forties,
he would
have made haste to visit Barnum's
Museum.
3. We must now turn back to the beginning
of that great
advance in observational
science which began with the inven-
tion of efficient microscopes.
With the history of the develop-
ment of this device we are not concerned;
for our purpose it
suffices to recall that the microscope began to figure as an im-
portant instrument
of biological discovery in the second half of
the seventeenth
century,
above all through
the work of An-
tony van Leeuwenhoek.
The story of his achievements
has
often been told;"
and its details need not be repeated
here.
What, however, we must not forget is that these disclosures of
microbiology
-
like the earlier discoveries of the non-biologi-

ASPECTS OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
237
cal microscopists -
seemed at once to give fresh empirical
corroboration
to the principles
of plenitude
and continuity,
and
in turn -
for minds
with whom
these still passed as
virtually axiomatic -
received theoretical
confirmation
from
them.
The world of micro-organisms
was after all nothing
more than might have been expected, if those principles were
valid;
it might have been deduced a priori even though it had
never become sensibly observable.
The existence of units of
matter, both organic and inorganic, far more minute than the
microscope had yet revealed had, in fact, been conjectured
a
priori before Leeuwenhoek.
In a scientific treatise of 1664 the
writer, Henry Power, observes:
It hath often seem'd to me beyond an ordinary
probability,
and some-
thing more than fancy, (however paradoxical
the conjecture may seem) to
think that the least bodies we are able to see with our naked eyes, are but
middle proportionals
(as it were) 'twixt the greatest and smallest bodies in
nature, which two extremes lye equally beyond the reach of humane sen-
sation:
For as on the one side they are but narrow souls, and not worthy
the name of Philosophers, that think any Body can be too great or too vast
in its dimensions;
so likewise are they as inapprehensive,
and of the same
litter as the former, that on the other side think the particles of matter may
be too little, and that nature is stinted at an Atom, and must have a non-
ultra of her subdivisions.
Such, I am sure, our Modern Engine (the Micro-
scope) will ocularly
evince and unlearn
them
their opinions again:
for
herein you may see what a subtil divider of matter Nature is.
Thus, "if the Dioptricks further prevail," its past achievements
will be vastly surpassed; and though the author, in the sequel,
deals chiefly with inanimate
bodies, his inference seems clearly
to imply a parallel extension of the world of organisms into the
region of the infinitely
small, in which
the "incomparable
Stenography
of Providence"
has produced
"the
Insectile
Automata
(those Living-exiguities)."
23
The same logic required
this extension of the realm of life
downwards
which required
the hypotheses of the"
infinity of
worlds"
and of inhabited
globes within
those worlds.
The
"two infinites"
-
the infinitely great and the infinitely little
-
both were implicates of the same premises.
We have seen
Fontenelle
in the Entretiens sur la pluraliti
des mondes arguing
from already known facts of microbiology to the conclusion -

238
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
itself not susceptible of observational
proof -
which he was
seeking to establish.
Every drop of water
is crowded
with
"petits
poissons OU petits serpents que l'on
n'aurait
jamais
soupconnes
d'y habiter,"
etc.
Since, then, "Nature
has so
liberally disseminated
animals upon the earth,"
is it to be be-
lieved that"
after having pushed her fecundity here to excess,
she has, in the other planets, been so sterile as to produce upon
them no living things?"
24 And to those who found edification
in the common premises of both conclusions, any concrete evi-
dence which tended to confirm either was a welcome verifica-
tion of supposed metaphysical
truths.
Observational
science,
however, played a much greater
part in making the general
public sensible of this biological implication
of the principle of
plenitude
than it did in persuading
them of the truth
of the
new cosmography.
This
second
enlargement
of nature
had
two conflicting
effects upon men's imaginations
and their feeling about the
world they lived in.
On the one hand, there was something
highly sinister about it; it presented the ghastly spectacle of a
universal parasitism, of life everywhere preying upon life, and
of the human body itself as infested with myriads of tiny preda-
tory creatures which made of it their food and sometimes -
as soon began to be conjectured
-
their eventual
victim;"
On the other hand, it seemed to afford additional
and very
striking illustrations of the prodigious fecundity of Nature and
at the same time of her admirable
thrift.
Life, it seemed, was
ubiquitous.
No bit of matter was so small that it could not
afford lodging and nutriment
for living beings still smaller;
and animate
matter
itself was everywhere
turned
to use to
sustain yet more animate
matter,
and this in turn yet more,
and so on without
ascertainable
limit.
The
microbiologist
merely confirmed and illustrated Pope's description of Nature's
most impressive characteristic:
See, thro' this air, this ocean, and this earth,
All matter quick, and bursting into birth.
Above, how high, progressive life may go!
Around, how wide! How deep extend below!
It was upon
the unpleasant
side of the picture
that
the
gloomier minds preferred to dwell.
It served well Pascal's pur-

ASPECTS OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
239
pose of " lowering"
and terrifying man, of making him vividly
sensible of his small place in the cosmic scheme and the limita-
tions of his powers of understanding.
Swift's lines on the sup-
posed infinite regress of parasitism
are too familiar
to quote.
This peculiarity
of nature was to his mind, no doubt, an illus-
tration
of that
general
nastiness of things on which he was
prone to dwell.
It was, in the main, on the alarming
aspect
of the conception
of "the
two infinites"
that
Ecouchard-Le
Brun poetically dilated:
Entre deux infinis l'Homme en naissant place,
Se voit de tous les deux egalement presse. . . .
Pour confondre ses yeux qu'effraya
I'Elephant,
Le Ciron l'attendait
aux confins du Neant. 26
But the other imaginative
reaction was apparently
much more
common
in
eighteenth-century
philosophy
and
literature.
The discoveries of the microscopists,
and the assumed exist-
ence of micro-organisms
far smaller and more numerous
than
had actually
been discovered,
provided
delightful
new evi-
dence of that insatiable
generativeness
in which the"
good-
ness of God" had, in all the Platonistic philosophies, been held
peculiarly
to consist; and there was thus furnished
a new in-
citement to those types of cosmic emotion and piety which had
always been associated with the principle
of plenitude.
The
following, for example, which might be supposed to have been
written by a late nineteenth-
or a twentieth-century
bacteriolo-
gist in a rhetorical
moment,
is in fact to be found in one of
Addison's Spectators(No.5
I 9) :
Every part of Matter is peopled; every green Leaf swarms with Inhab-
itants.
There is scarce a single Humour in the Body of a Man, or of any
other Animal, in which our Glasses do not discover Myriads of living Crea-
tures.
The Surface of Animals is also covered with other Animals, which
are in the same manner the Basis of other animals that live upon it; nay,
we find in the most solid Bodies, as in Marble itself, innumerable
Cells and
Cavities that are crouded with such imperceptible
inhabitants,
as are too
little for the naked eye to discover.
And all of this, for Addison, was a part of that"
wonderful and
surprising
contemplation"
which is afforded
by the spectacle
of the Chain of Being, and a further evidence of "the
exuber-
ant and overflowing
goodness of the Supream
Being, whose

240
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Mercy extends to all his Works."
Addison even finds in the
microbes
an argument
for the existence
of angels or other
beings above man in the scale, "since
there is an infinitely
greater
Space and Room
for. different
Degrees of Perfection
between the Supreme Being and Man, than between Man and
the most despicable Insect."
James Thomson's
emotions were
more mixed.
On the one hand -
referring
as usual to "the
mighty
chain
of beings"
-
he is sure that micro-organisms
have
their
necessary
and
"useful"
place
in the scheme
of
things, and he rhapsodizes over the way in which, as the exist-
ence of such creatures
shows, "full Nature
swarms with life."
For him, too, this is a reason to praise
that Power
Whose wisdom shines as lovely on our minds,
As on our smiling eyes his servant Sun.
On the other hand, the poet cannot but think it fortunate
that
most of the minuter
animals,
conceal'd
By the kind art of forming Heaven, escape
The grosser eye of man;
for if the worlds
On worlds enclosed should on his senses burst,
From cates ambrosial, and the nectar'd
bowl,
He would abhorrent
turn;
and in dead night,
When silence sleeps o'er all, be stunn'd with noise."
Thus, even in those who accepted the premise of the optimists
that
the rationality
and
excellence
of nature
consist in its
"fullness,"
there
sometimes
broke through
a feeling that
it
would be pleasanter
if it were not quite so full.
Even at the end of the century
the principle
of plenitude
and especially that of continuity
are still recognized
by Kant
in the Kritik der reinen Vernunft as sound guiding principles for
the biological and other sciences, though with the special and
important
qualifications
which
followed
from
the
impossi-
bility, implied by the Critical Philosophy, of the detailed com-
pletion
by our
understanding
of any
such
comprehensive
synthesis.
The former principle is called "the law of specifica-
tion ...
which requires manifoldness
and diversity in things"
and
"might
be expressed
by entium uarietatesnon temere esse

ASPECTS OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
BIOLOGY
241
minuendas";
the latter is "the principle of the affinity of all con-
cepts, which requires a continuous
transition
from every species
to every
other
species by a gradual
increase
of diversity."
From
it "springs
its immediate
consequence
datur continuum
jormarum:
that
is, that
the diversities
of species touch
each
other and admit
of no transition
from one to another
per sal-
tum."
This, however, does not" rest upon empirical
grounds,"
and" no object corresponding
to it can be pointed out in experi-
ence," since such a continuum
would be infinite, and since the
principle
does not tell us the"
criterion
of degrees of affinity"
between adjacent
species, but"
only that we ought to seek for
them."
Kant's
conclusion,
then, concerning"
the famous law
of the continuous scale of created
beings,"
which
he ignorantly
supposes
to have
been
"brought
into vogue
by Leibniz,"
is that,
while"
neither
observation
nor insight into the con-
stitution
of nature
could ever establish it as an objective affir-
mation,"
nevertheless
"the
method
of looking
for order
in
nature
according
to such a principle,
and the maxim
of ad-
mitting
such order
(though
it may be uncertain
just where
and how far) as existing in nature,
certainly
constitute
a legiti-
mate and excellent regulative
principle
of reason."
It "points
the way which leads towards a systematic unity of knowledge."
It follows, in short, from the Kantian
analysis of the general
conditions
of the possibility of knowledge
that the conception
of the Chain of Being, in its fullness and strict continuity,
is a
controlling"
ideal of the reason"
which can never be actually
satisfied,
though
science may hope,
and
should
seek, in its
gradual
advance
to exhibit more and more the empirical
evi-
dence of its approximate
truth.

IX
THE TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
WHEN
the principle
of plenitude
was construed
either
re-
ligiously, as an expression of the faith in the divine goodness,
or philosophically,
as an implicate of the principle of sufficient
reason, it was, as usually understood,
inconsistent with any be-
lief in progress, or, indeed, in any sort of significant change in
the universe as a whole.
The Chain of Being, in so far as its
continuity
and completeness
were affirmed on the customary
grounds,
was a perfect example
of an absolutely
rigid and
static scheme of things.
Rationality
has nothing
to do with
dates.
If the non-existence
of one of the links in the chain
would be proof of the arbitrariness
of the constitution
of the
world today, it would have been so yesterday, and would be so
tomorrow.
As an early eighteenth-century
English
philoso-
pher put the point:
[God] always acts upon some ground or Reason, and from thence it fol-
lows that he had some Reason for Creation, otherwise he never would have
created at all.
If then he had any Reason, that Reason certainly was the
same from all Eternity that it was at any particular time: For instance, sup-
pose Goodness was the Ground of his Creation, it follows that if it was good
at any particular
time, it was equally so from all Eternity.'
This, a contemporary
pointed
out, if true, must be true not
only of the creation
in general,
but of every kind of being: it
implies that, "not only Angels and Men, but everyotherspeciesof
creatures,every Planetwith all its Inhabitants,were eternal,"
and,
what is more, "that
God cannothereaftercreate any new Species
of Beings; because, whatever
it is good for him to create in
time, it was equally good from all Eternity."
2
The same implication
of optimism
was remarked
by the
poet Henry
Brooke, in a prose note to The Universal Beauty
(1735):
Either there is a present absolute fitness in things;
or a fitness in futuro,
that is, in prospect and tendency, and only relative here to what must be
absolute hereafter.
But if there were an absolute fitness in the present state

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
243
of things, there could then be no change in anything;
since what is best can
never change to better.
To many
eighteenth-century
minds
this conception
of a
world in which, from the beginning,
no emergence
of novelty
had been or would hereafter
be possible seems to have been
wholly satisfying.
The AbbePluche, for example, in a widely
read popularization
of the astronomical
knowledge of the time,
described
the essential immutability
of nature
as one of the
definitive
conclusions
of philosophy;
and he apparently
re-
garded it as an eminently
edifying conclusion.
No doubt,
he
grants,
the work of creation
was in a sense progressive until
man was produced.
But with him the consummation
to which
all the earlier phases had been preparatory
was reached.
Nothing more, therefore, will be produced in all the ages to follow. All
the philosophers have deliberated
and come to agreement upon this point.
Consult the evidence of experience;
elements always the same, species that
never vary, seeds and germs prepared
in advance for the perpetuation
of
everything,
...
so that one can say, Nothing new underthesun, no new pro-
duction, no species which has not been since the beginning."
This assumption
sometimes was used early in the century
against the then incipient
science of paleontology.
The view
that fossils are the remains of actual organisms now extinct was
combated
on the ground
that, in a well-conducted
universe,
every species must be constantly
represented;
so wrote
the
great English botanist John Ray in 1703:
It would follow, That many species of Shell-Fish are lost out of the World,
which Philosophers hitherto
have been unwilling to admit, esteeming the
Destruction of anyone Species a dismembring of the Universe, and rendring
it imperfect;
whereas they think the Divine Providence
is especially con-
cerned to secure and preserve the Works of the Creation,"
This conclusion
was both supported
and extended
by the
reigning
embryological
theory of preformation
or emboltement
which declared
that not only all species but all individual
or-
ganisms have existed from the beginning.
The individuals,
no
doubt, unlike the species, seem to increase in numbers
and to
undergo change, but in reality this is a mere expansion or 'un-
folding'
(evolutio) of structures
and characters
that were al-
ready pre-delineated,
on a minute scale of magnitude,
in the
primeval
germs which lay encased one within another
like a

244
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
nest of boxes.
As Brooke poetically phrased
it, the Creative
Omnipotence
could infinitude confine,
And dwell Immensewithin the minim shrine:
The eternal species in an instant mould
And endless worlds in seeming atoms hold,
Plan t within plant, and seed. enfolding seed. 6
Thus 'an important
group of the ruling ideas of the early
eighteenth
century -
the conception
of the Chain of Being,
the principles of plenitude
and continuity
on which it rested,
the optimism which it served to justify, the generally accepted
biology -
all were in accord with the supposedly. Solomonic
dictum, which many others besides Pluche were wont to cite as
an inspired confirmation
of the conclusions of philosophy and
science.
There not only is not, but there never will be, any-
thing new under the sun.
The process of time brings no en-
richment of the world's diversity; in a world which is the mani-
festation of eternal rationality,
it could not conceivably do so.
Yet it was in precisely the period when this implication
of the
old conceptions became most apparent
that there began a re-
action against it.
For one of the principal
happenings
in eighteenth-century
thought
was the temporalizing
of the Chain of Being.
The
plenumformarum came to be conceived by some, not as the in-
ventory but as the program
of nature,
which is being carried
out gradually
and exceedingly
slowly in the cosmic history.
While all the possibles demand
realization,
they are not ac-
corded it all at once.
Some have attained
it in the past and
have apparently
since lost it; many are embodied in the kind
of creatures which now exist; doubtless infinitely many more
are destined to receive the gift of actual existence in the ages
that are to come.
It is only of the universe in its entire tem-
poral span that the principle
of plenitude
holds good.
The
Demiurgus
is not in a hurry;
and his goodness is sufficiently
exhibited if, soon or late, every Idea finds its manifestation
in
the sensible order.
The causes of this change were of several sorts; but the one
which is most pertinent
to our subject lay in the difficulties to
which the principle of plenitude
itself, as it had traditionally

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
245
been interpreted,
gave rise, when its implications
were fully
drawn out and seriously considered.
Those implications
were,
on the one hand, intolerable
to the religious feelings of many
minds; and, on the other hand, it became increasingly
appar-
ent that they were hard to reconcile with the facts known about
nature.
The static and permanently
complete Chain of Being
broke down largely from its own weight.
Let us note the religious and moral difficulties first.
The
fatal defect of optimism -
and of the principle
of plenitude
upon which its dialectic chiefly depended
-
was that which
we have seen Voltaire pointing out: it left no room for hope, at
least for the world in general or for mankind
as a whole.
If all
partial evils are required
by the universal good, and if the uni-
verse is and always has been perfectly good, we cannot expect
that any of the partial
evils will disappear.
Logically
thor-
ough-going optimism is equivalent
to the doctrine of the Con-
servation of Evil, metaphysical,
moral, and physical;
the sum
of imperfection
in the parts must remain constant, since it is in
the realization
ofjust that sum that the perfection of the whole
consists.
But to minds whose sense of the reality of the con-
crete evils of existence was too profound
to be alleviated
by a
syllogism, this optimistic
paradox
was a grotesque
mockery.
It was better to admit the world to be not at present entirely
rational,
and retain some hope of its amendment,
than to con-
ceive of it as perfectly rational
-
and utterly hopeless.
For the individual,
it is true, the principle
of plenitude
did
not necessarily exclude a prospect of attaining
a higher state of
being in another life. Though
the permanent
structure
of the
world consisted of a fixed set of ideal pigeon-holes, and though
every hole must be occupied,
it was not impossible
for the
inmate of one hole to transfer to a better one.
But to this pos-
sibility there was attached -
according
to the interpretation
given the principle
by some of its most approved
expositors-
a strange
condition.
Those of "the
inferior orders"
in the
universe,
Edmund
Law pointed
out, "could
not aspire to a
higher
station
without
detriment
to the superior
which pos-
sesses that station;
for he must quit his place before another
can ascend to it."
Hence, though a man by the right exercise
of his moral freedom
might "become
fit and qualified
for a

246
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
superior state," he could not be promoted to it until a vacancy
occurred
through
the "degradation"
of one of those above
him, as a consequence
of wrong-doing.
This was a strictly
consistent deduction
from the theory, if it was assumed that
each degree of possible difference
can have only one repre-
sentative
at a time;
and this assumption was required
by the
principle
of the identity
of indiscernibles.
Two creatures
oc-
cupying
precisely the same place in the scale would be the
same creature.
But the consequence that no one can ever rise
in the world except at the cost of another's
fall was, it is evi-
dent, a morally monstrous
one.
The optimist's
proof of the
rationality
of the general constitution
of things turned out to
be a proof of its essential immorality.
A revolt against these two implications
of the scheme, then,
was inevitable,
as soon as they became
fully apparent.
The
Chain of Being must perforce be reinterpreted
so as to admit
of progress in general, and of a progress of the individual
not
counterbalanced
by deterioration
elsewhere.
And on the other
hand, the traditional
conception,
when so reinterpreted,
sug-
gested a new eschatology, or rather
the revival of an old one.
Since the scale was still assumed to be minutely
graduated,
since nature makes no leaps, the future life must be conceived
to be -
at least for those who use their freedom rightly -
a
gradual
ascent, stage after stage, through
all the levels above
that
reached
by man
here;
and since the number
of these
levels between man and the one Perfect Being must be infinite,
that ascent can have no final term.
The conception
of the
destiny of man as an unending
progress thus emerges as a con-
sequence
of reflection
upon
the principles
of plenitude
and
continuity.
This revision of the traditional
eschatology
had been fore-
shadowed in the previous century by Henry More.
Inasmuch
as natura nonfacit saltus, the dead, he inferred, do not leap im-
mediately from their terrestrial
imperfection
to .celestial beati-
tude; nor need the plenitude
of being be supposed to be rea-
lized simultaneously.
A Musician strikes not all strings at once; neither is it to be expected
that everything in Nature at every time should act; but when it is its turn,
then touched upon it will give the sound; in the interim it lies silent. 8

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
247
Addison, whom we have already found descanting
with a kind
of poetic rapture upon the notion of the Chain of Being, was led
by it to reject even more sharply than More the orthodox Prot-
estant conception
of life after death
as an eternal
fixation in
changeless bliss or changeless misery.
He wrote in the Spectator
in
171 I :
Among ...
other excellent arguments for the immortality
of the soul,
there is one drawn from the perpetual progress of the soul to its perfection,
without a possibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not
remember
to have seen opened and improved by others who have written
on this subject, though it seems to me to carry a great weight with it.?
We must believe, Addison declares,
that the several generations of rational creatures, which rise up and disap-
pear in such 'quick successions, are only to receive their first rudiments of
existence here, and afterwards to be transplanted
into a more friendly cli-
mate, where they may spread and flourish to all eternity.
There is not, in
my opinion, a more pleasing and triumphant
consideration in religion than
this of the perpetual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection
of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the soul
as going on from strength to strength, to consider that she is to shine forever
with new accessions of glory, and brighten to all eternity, that she will be
still adding virtue to virtue and knowledge to knowledge;
carries with it
something that is wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural
to the mind of man.
Nay, it must be a prospect pleasing to God himself,
to see his Creation ever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to him,
by greater degrees of resemblance.
This conception
of an endless prospect
of bettering
one's
position in the universe, a prospect equally open to all rational
beings, evidently
attracted
Addison partly
because it rid the
picture
of the Scale of Being of that look of irremediable
in-
equality which it had in its usual form.
Methinks
this single consideration,
of the progress of a finite spirit to
perfection, will be sufficient to extinguish all envy in inferior natures, and
all contempt in superior.
That Cherubim, which now appears as a God to
a human soul, knows very well that the period will come about in eternity,
when the human soul shall be as perfect as he himself now is; nay, when
she shall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as she now falls
short of it.
The Scale of Being thus becomes literally a ladder, with an
infinite
number
of rungs, up which individual
souls forever

248
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
climb.
In so far as all do so at an equal pace, the hierarchical
order remains and the relative positions do not alter:
It is true, the higher nature still advances, and by that means preserves
his distance and superiority in the Scale of Being; but he knows that how
high soever the position is of which he stands possess'd at present, the in-
ferior nature will at length mount up to it and shine forth in the same de-
gree of glory.
Leibniz, a few years later, concludes his PrinciplesofNatureand
ofGrace(17 I 8) with the assurance that no man is destined ever
fully to attain the beatific vision:
Our happiness will never consist, and ought not to consist, in a full en-
joyment, in which there is nothing more to desire, and which would make
our mind dull, but in a perpetual progress to new pleasures and new per-
fections."
This reconstruction
of the doctrine of immortality
is mani-
fest also in the same writing in which the melancholy conse-
quences of the argument for optimism had been so frankly de-
duced.
Edmund Law, a divine sufficiently orthodox to attain
a bishopric in his own subsequent ascent of the Scale of Being,
finds himself unable
to accept the conclusion which Arch-
bishop King's logic and his own required.
For he appends
to the seemingly triumphant
conclusion of the argument-
namely, that "the present state of the world is the very best
that could be" -
a footnote, in which he raises the question
"whether
God may be supposed to have placed any order of
beings in such a fixed, unalterable condition as not to admit of
advancement;
to have made any creatures as perfect at first
as the nature of a created being is capable of."
The answer,
Law thinks, is not altogether"
easy to be determined."
Those
who answer the question in the affirmative "argue
from our
notion of infinite or absolute goodness, which must excite the
Deity always to communicate
all manner of happiness in the
very highest degree for the same reason that it prompts him to
communicate it ever in any degree.
But this, they say, he had
not done, except he at first endowed some creatures with all
the perfection a creature could possibly receive and gave to
every subordinate
class of beings the utmost happiness their
several natures were capable of."
Law himself, however, in-

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
249
clines to the contrary view: "though
it may appear something
like a paradox,"
he thinks it "will perhaps upon further con-
sideration,
be judged not improbable."
For a creature
. . . to meet with a perpetual accession of new, unknown
pleasure: ...
and to be always approaching nearer and nearer to perfection
-
this must certainly advance the sum of its happiness even above that of
others whose condition is supposed to have begun and to have ended in
that degree of perfection where this will end (if there be any end in either),
and which never knew defect, variety, or increase.
A finite being fixed in
the same state, however excellent, must according
to all our conceptions
(if we be allowed to judge from our present faculties, and we can judge from
nothing else) contract a kind of indolence or insensibility
...
which noth-
ing but alteration and variety can cure.
It does not, therefore, seem prob-
able that God has actually fixed any created beings whatsoever in the very
highest degree of perfection next to himself.
Nay, it is impossible to con-
ceive of such a highest degree, and the supposition is absurd, since that
which admits of a continual
addibility
can have no highest. . ..
[God
will, then,] we believe never produce any beings in such a state as shall not
have room enough for them to be still growing in felicity and forever ac-
quiring new happiness, together with new perfection. 9
This change in the form of the belief in a future life was
closely associated -
as the last citation
illustrates -
with a
psychological
observation,
a generalization
about
human
nature, which was a favorite one with just those philosophers
who loved most to dilate
upon
the principle
of plenitude.
Man, it was remarked,
is capable of happiness only through
perpetual
alteration.
At the opening of Bruno's Spacciodella
bestia trionfante, which had been englished in 1713 and was
much read and admired in the eighteenth century, "Wisdom"
appears and utters these words:
If there was no change in bodies, no variety in matter, and no vicissitude
in beings, there would be nothing agreeable, nothing good, nothing pleasant.
. . .
Pleasure and satisfaction consists in nothing else but a certain passage,
progress, or motion from one state to another.
. . .
We can have no de-
light in anything present till we have been first weary of what is past ....
The change from one extreme to another, with all the intervals, moving
from one contrary to another by all the intermediate
spaces, is sure to bring
satisfaction.l''
The same psychological remark occurs repeatedly
in Leib-
niz; e. g., "This
is the very law of enjoyment,
that pleasure

250
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
does not have an even tenor, for this begets loathing, and makes
us dull, not happy."
11
The principal historical significance of all this lies in the fact
that it exhibits the emergence and diffusion of a way of think-
ing about the nature of the good which was to unite with that
which we have already seen resulting from the logic of optim-
ism.
The new eschatology was the manifestation
of a second
new conception
of value.
The Platonic
identification
of the
consummate
good with aVTapKEt,aand cessation of desire -
"he
who possesses it has always the most perfect sufficiency
and is never in need of anything else" -
was giving place to its
opposite:
no finality, no ultimate
perfection,
no arrest of the
outreach
of the will.
Such passages as those which I have
quoted from Leibniz and Addison and Law were plainly fore-
shadowings of the Faust-ideal.
Man is by nature
insatiable,
and it is the will of his Maker that he should be so; to no mo-
ment of his experience can he, if true to his nature and his vo-
cation,
ever say: "Verweile
doch, du bist so schon !"
The
tendency to substitute the ideal of a StrebennachdemUnendlichen,
an interminable
pursuit of an unattainable
goal, for that of a
final rest of the soul in the contemplation
of Perfection,
an
assimilation to "the
peace which makes quiet the centre"
of
heaven
in Dante's
vision of the
Celestial
Paradise -
this
tendency' has usually been post-dated by historians.
It was no
invention of Goethe, nor of the German Romanticists, nor even
of Lessing, but had been expressed repeatedly
throughout
the
century,
both by eminent
philosophers
and universally
read
men of letters; and it was closely associated in their minds with
the accepted idea of the Scale of Being, which had long been
more
vaguely
described
by theologians
of unimpeachable
orthodoxy as the course of the mind's ascent to God.
In Lenz's essay on the First Principlesof Morals (1772) may
be heard sounded again, somewhat mildly, this prelude to the
Romantic
strain, then soon to burst forth in full volume.
He
has been defining the nature of the "urge
towards complete-
ness" (Volkommenheit),which he declares to be one of the funda-
mental impulses in human nature.
This completeness consists
in the full development of all" the powers and capacities which
Nature has implanted
in us."
But two qualifications,
both of

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
251
them connected in Lenz's mind with the principles of plenitude
and continuity, are attached to this ethical ideal of self-realiza-
tion.
(I)" We have learned in our Age of Enlightenment
that
among our faculties some are superior -
those of the mind -
and that to these so-called higher faculties of the soul the others
should be subordinated.
In this proportionality,
therefore,
should we seek to cultivate and develop them.
But since all of
them stand in an inseparable,
infinitely minute connection
with one another.P the others [i. e., the' lower'] are no more
to be neglected than the higher -
and this in accord with the
different tendencies of each individual."
(2) But for both the
race and the individual
the same principle demands a per-
petual rejection of the statusquo,an endless ascent of the Scale
of Being.
Take heed that I am speaking here of a human perfection.
I hope that
the reproach will not here be brought against me that, since God created
the first men good, they must, on my view, have required no morality, i. e.,
conscious moral effort.
'Good,' in the case of the earliest men, meant per-
fectible, not perfect, for otherwise there would have been no fall. All crea-
tures from the worm to the seraph must be capable of perfecting them-
selves, else they would cease to be finite creatures, and would lose themselves,
in accordance with the Platonic conception, in the infinite and perfect
Being.13
This is one of the numerous eighteenth-century
anticipations of
Emerson's familiar couplet:
Striving to be man, the worm
Mounts through all the spires of form.
While, in an age in which many men of science were also
theologians, this change in the religious and ethical application
of the conception tended, of itself, to promote a kindred change
in scientific ideas, the latter was enforced also by reasons of a
less speculative kind. One of these was the difficulty, not to say
the impossibility, of seeing in extant organic types the degree
of continuity which the theory required.
Nature as now ob-
servable did not appear to present even a segment of the chain
which was complete and unbroken.
This objection was made
much of by those few writers who were bold enough to attack
the whole assumption of the plenitude of the creation.
In the

25 2
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
second half of the century
Voltaire
and Dr. Johnson
and the
pioneer anthropologist
Blumenbach
were the most notable of
these critics.
Voltaire had once, indeed, he tells us, been fasci-
nated by the idea of the Scale of Being.
When I first read Plato and came upon this gradation of beings which
rises from the lightest atom to the Supreme Being, I was struck with ad-
miration.
i But when I looked at it closely, the great phantom vanished, as
in former times all apparitions were wont to vanish at cock-crow.
At first
the imagination takes a pleasure in seeing the imperceptible transition from
inanimate to organic matter, from plants to zoophytes, from these to animals,
from these to genii,from these geniiendued with asmall
aerial body to im-
material substances;
and finally angels, and different orders of such sub-
stances, ascending in beauties and perfections up to God himself.
This
hierarchy
pleases those good folk who fancy they see in it the Pope and
his cardinals followed by archbishops and bishops; after whom come the
curates, the vicars, the simple priests, the deacons, the subdeacons;
then
the monks appear, and the line is ended by the Capuchins.P
But Voltaire argues on three grounds that the continuous series
is non-existent
in the organic world.
First, some species which
once existed have disappeared;
others are in process of extinc-
tion; and yet others might be or may yet be destroyed by man,
if he should so desire.
"If the rest of the world had imitated
the English there would be no more wolves on the Earth."
It
is probable
also that there have been races of men which have
vanished.
Secondly, the obvious fact that we can conceive of
imaginary
species intermediate
between the actual ones shows
at once that the sequence of forms is broken:
Is there not visibly a gap between the ape and man?
Is it not easy to
imagine a featherless biped possessing intelligence but having neither speech
nor the human shape, who would answer to our gestures and serve us? And
between this new species and that of man can we not imagine others?
Finally,
the supposition
of the completeness
of the chain re-
quires the existence of a vast hierarchy
of immaterial
beings
above man.
Doubtless a Christian will believe in some of these
beings, paraequelafoi nousPenseigne. But what reason is there
apart from revelation for believing in them -
in other words,
what reason had Plato to do so? As for the inanimate
world,
there is plainly no gradation
in its component
members -
for
example,
in the magnitudes
of the planets or of their orbits.
In sum, then, Voltaire's
criticism is that any man who will give

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
253
the slightest attention
to the known facts will see at once the
falsity of the supposition
that"
nature
makes no leaps."
He
concludes, then, with an apostrophe
to Plato, source, as Vol-
taire supposes, of the entire delusion:
o Plato, so much admired!
I fear that you have told us only fables, and
have never spoken except in sophisms. 0 Plato! you have done more harm
than you know. -How
so? I shall be asked; but I shall not answer.P
Voltaire
also argued elsewhere, though with no too meticu-
lous consistency, against the a priori assumptions
upon which
the principle of the cosmic plenum rested.
"Why
should, and
how can,
existence
be infinite?
Newton
demonstrated
the
reality of a vacuum.
If in nature there can be a void beyond
nature,
wherein
lies the necessity that entities should extend
to infinity?
What would an infinite extension be?
It could no
more exist than an infinite number."
Yet in the same para-
graph
in which he denies the infinity of the world in space
Voltaire
asserts its infinity in time, and therefore
attacks the
traditional
doctrine
of creation
on grounds
equally
tradi-
tional.
"The
great
principle
nothing comesfrom nothing is as
true as that two and two make four."
The universe,
there-
fore, must be "eternal."
It is an absurd contradiction to say that the Active Being passed an eter-
nity without acting, that the Creative Being existed through
infinite time
without creating anything, that the Necessary Being was through an eternity
a useless being.P
Dr. Johnson's
attack
upon
the
theory
was based
upon
similar grounds; but, of the two, it was, somewhat surprisingly,
the more profound
and more dialectical.l?
Not only did the
principle
of plenitude
contradict
observable
facts;
it also
seemed to him to contradict
itself. The Chain of Being must be
a genuine continuum,
if that principle has any validity at all;
but in a continuum
there must be an infinity of intermediate
members between any two members,
however "near"
to one
another.
Johnson
thus applied to the accepted
conception
of
the universe some of the reasonings which, as applied
to the
line, were as old as Zeno of Elea.
The Scale of Existence from Infinity to Nothing cannot possibly have
Being. The highest Being not infinite must be, as has been often observed,

254
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
at an infinite Distance below Infinity.
. . .
And in this Distance between
finite and infinite, there will be Room for ever for an infinite Series of in-
definable Existence.
Between the lowest positive existence and Nothing,
wherever
we suppose positive Existence
to cease, is another
chasm in-
finitely deep; where there is Room again for endless Orders of subordinate
Nature, continued for ever and for ever, and yet infinitely superior to Non-
Existence.
. . .
Nor is this all.
In the Scale, wherever it begins or ends,
are infinite Vacuities.
At whatever Distance we suppose the next Order of
Beings to be above Man, there is room for an intermediate
Order of Beings
between them;
and if for one order, then for infinite Orders;
since every
Thing that admits of more or less, and consequently
all the Parts of that
which admits them, may be infinitely divided.
So that, as far as we can
judge, there may be Room in the Vacuity between any two Steps of the
Scale, or between any two Points of the cone of Being, for infinite Exertion
of Infinite Power.
The principle of plenitude,
moreover, Johnson
observes, has
implications which should be susceptible of empirical verifica-
tion but are in fact false.
Every Reason which can be brought to prove, that there are Beings of
every possible sort, will prove that there is the greatest Number possible of
every Sort of beings; but this, with respect to Man we know, if we 'know
anything, not to be true.
In short, Johnson
concludes, "this
Scale of Being I have
demonstrated
to be raised by presumptuous
Imagination,
to
rest on Nothing at the Bottom, to lean on Nothing at the Top,
and to have Vacuities from step to step through
which any
Order
of Being may sink into Nihility without
any Incon-
venience, so far as we can Judge,
to the next Rank above or
below it."
Thus
it appears how little Reason those who repose their Reason upon the Scale
of' Being have to triumph
over them who recur to any other Expedient of
Solution, and what difficulties arise on every Side to repress the Rebellions
of presumptuous
Decision.
Qui paucaconsiderat,facile pronunciatF"
Johnson's
criticism reached very nearly to the root of the
matter.
If it had been duly considered by his contemporaries,
the late eighteenth
century might have been marked by the
breakdown of the principle of continuity and of the traditional
argument
for optimism, which he also vigorously assailed in
the same writing.
But it does not appear that either his or Vol-
taire's criticisms produced
much effect.
Throughout
the cen-

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
255
tury the assumptions
of plenitude,
continuity,
and gradation
continued,
as we have seen, to operate powerfully upon men's
minds, especially in the biological sciences.
Nevertheless,
it was becoming increasingly
evident -
as it
had, indeed, been to some medieval writers -
that something
had to be done to fit the postulate of the necessary complete
realization
of all the possibles with the fact that the concrete
world is temporal.
The assumed necessity was an eternalneces-
sity; but its execution, so to say, manifestly was not eternal.
If
individuals are the links in the chain, they plainly do not exist
all at once; and even if the links -
by a departure
from the
rigor of the principle
of continuity
-
were assumed
to be
species, the simple factual difficulty of the occurrence
of gaps
in the known organic series had long troubled the believers in
the"
fullness" and continuity
of the creation.
One device for
meeting this embarrassment,
to which so great a mind as Leib-
niz at times resorted, consisted, as we have seen, in assigning
members of the series consecutive in kind to spatially distrib-
uted planets or solar systems.
To find the links missing here
you might need to fly to Mars or the Pleiades.P
Maupertuis,
who ranked as a great man of science in his time, proposed an-
other equally far-fetched conjecture to save the doctrine of the
original completeness of the sequence of forms.
Many species
once existing must, he suggested,
have been eliminated
by
some accident, such as the approach of a comet.
Nature as we
now see it is like a once regular edifice after it has been struck
by lightning:
"it presents to our eyes only ruins in which we
can no longer discern the symmetry of the parts nor the design
of the architect."
20 But to those whose faith in the plenitude
and continuity
of the universe was tenacious a less unsatisfac-
tory and less arbitrary
hypothesis naturally
suggested itself:
that the Chain of Being, though not observably complete now,
would be seen to be so, or to be tending to become ever more
nearly so, if we could know the entire. sequence of forms in
time, past, present, and future.
It has been maintained
by several recent writers on Leib-
niz that this solution was not adopted by him, that he still ad-
hered to the conception of a static universe.
A number of pas-
sages tending to support this interpretation
can be cited; but

256
THE
GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
the evidence is, on the whole, against it. 21 There is a famous
letter, probably
of 1707, part of which I have already cited, in
which he expatiates
with even more than his usual enthusiasm
upon the scientific importance
of the principle
of continuity;
it concludes as follows: that principle
is therefore to me beyond the reach of doubt;
and it might serve to estab-
lish a number of important
matters in veritable philosophy, which, rising
above the senses and the imagination,
seeks the origin of phenomena in the
intellectual regions.
I flatter myself that I have some ideas of these truths;
but this age is not prepared
to receive them.
What, then, were these further implications
of the principle,
so strange
that
Leibniz
hesitated
to make
them
explicit?
There is reason to think that one of them, at least, was the con-
clusion that the world is as yet incomplete,
that the Chain of
Being must be construed
as a process in which all forms are
gradually
realized in the order of time.
In the Protogaea(1693)
Leibniz
points
out
that
many
species
of organisms
which
existed in earlier periods of geological time have now become
extinct and that many known to us were then apparently
non-
existent, and adds that it is a hypothesis"
worthy of belief that
in the course of the vast changes"
which have taken place in
the condition
of the earth's
crust "even
the species of animals
have many times been transformed."
22
"It
is possible,"
he
writes again, that at some previous time"
many species which
have in them something
of the cat, such as the lion, the tiger,
the lynx, may have been of the same race, and may now be re-
garded
as new sub-varieties
of the original cat-species."
23 In
another
writing
(1710) he suggests that it is probable
that the
earliest
animals
were marine
forms, and
that
the amphibia
and land-animals
are descended
from these."
And elsewhere
Leibniz
on metaphysical
grounds
extends
this conception
of
gradual
development
to the entire universe.
The significanceof
time and change, he declares, the reason why le changementesta
propos,is that there may thereby"
be more species or forms of
perfection,
even
though
they
may
be equal
in degree."
25
There
are, he elsewhere observes, two possible hypotheses
on
this
matter:
"first,
that
nature
is always
equally
perfect,
second, that it is always increasing
in perfection,
...
suppos-
ing that it was not possible to give it its full perfection
all at

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
257
once."
If the latter is true, the fact might be explained in
either of two ways: "either
that there was no beginning, and
the moments or states of the world have been increasing in per-
fection from all eternity, or that there was a beginning of the
process."
26 And in one of the most interesting of his shorter
writings he pronounces with all possible definiteness in favor of
the hypothesis of continual
advance.
The plenum of possi-
bility is now, and will forever be, like a partially tilled field,
out of which new and finer growths must spring without end,
since a continuum can never be exhausted.
A cumulative increase of the beauty and universal perfection of the works
of God, a perpetual and unrestricted progress of the universe as a whole
must be recognized, such that it advances to a higher state of cultivation,
just as a great part of our earth is already subject to cultivation and will
hereafter be so more and more. . . .
As for the objection which may be
raised, that if this is true the world will at some time already have become
paradise, the answer is not far to seek: even though many substances shall
have attained to a great degree of perfection, there will always, on account
of the infinite divisibility of the continuum,
remain over in the abyss of
things parts hitherto dormant, to be aroused and raised to a greater and
higher condition and, so to say, to a better cultivation.
And for this reason
progress will never come to an end. 27
This general thesis of the creative advance of nature,
and
also the occasional more concrete assertions of the transforma-
tion of species, Leibniz was under the necessity of reconciling
with certain other features of his system with which they might
at first sight have appeared
incongruous.
Both his theory of
monads and his preformationist
embryology affirmed that, in
a certain sense, every being which ever exists in nature has al-
ways existed in it.
The number of individual
"substances"
i. e., monads, is constant.
It can (he wrote in 1715) be de-
clared with certainty, not only that"
the soul of every animal
has pre-existed"
since the creation, but also that it has pre-
existed" in an organic body" of its own.
"Every birth of an
animal
is only the
transformation
of an
animal
already
alive."
28 An individual organism living today existed as an
animalcule
in the germ-plasm
of a primeval ancestor.
But
this, for Leibniz, did not necessarily mean that the ancestor
was morphologically
similar to the descendant,
a creature of
the same species (in the usual sense of the term);
nor that

258
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the "preformed"
body of the present organism was a precise
"predelineation"
of its present, or its foetal, form; nor yet,
apparently,
that, throughout
the intervening time, the soul of
the organism
has always been of the same "grade"
and its
body of the same type. It is through a vast series of " changes,
evolutions and involutions,"
29that is, of new developments and
(in some cases) of retrogressions, that the original animalcule
"has become the present animal."
In particular,
at the con-
ception of an individual
a radical
change may take place.
"Not only the organic body, but also a soul in this body, and,
in a word, the animal itself, was already there before concep--
tion; and by means of conception the animal was merely pre-
pared for a great transformation,
in order to become an animal
of another species.
Even apart from generation
we may see
something approximating
this when worms become flies and
caterpillars
become butterflies."
30
This elevation of the in-
dividual germ to a higher species is, Leibniz in this passage
observes, the exception
rather
than
the rule;
"most
of the
spermatic animals remain in their own species," and" there is
only a small number
of the elect that pass on to a greater
theatre."
31 But the pre-existent souls of men were not, Leib-
niz thinks, strictly speaking, human souls.
I should suppose that souls which will some day become human have,
like those of the other species, been in the seeds, and in the ancestors, up to
Adam, and have consequently existed since the beginning of things, always
in a sort of organized body. . . .
But it seems proper, for several reasons,
that they should have existed then only as sensitive or animal souls .. , and
that they should remain in that state until the time of the generation of the
man to whom they were to belong, but that they then received reason -
whether there be a natural method of elevating a sensitive soul to the grade
of a reasonable soul (which I have difficulty in believing) or whether God
gave reason to this soul by a special operation, or (if you will) by a kind of
transcreation.
32
Once generated,
rational souls not only are exempt from re--
lapse to a lower grade, but (according
to Leibniz's
progres-
sivist eschatology already set forth), "they advance and ripen
continually,
like the world itself, of which they are but im-
ages."
33
Though
the souls of other individual
animals are
also indestructible"
so long as the world endures,"
they are
not, Leibniz at times, and apparently
usually, supposed, thus

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
259
assured of indefinite and continuous progress to higher grades
of being; their bodies are subject to "involutions"
as well as
"evolutions,"
and, the status of a soul corresponding
to that of
its body, the former may, through various natural vicissitudes,
sink in the scale. 34 Yet he also pronounces
it "a certain truth
that every substance must arrive at all the perfection of which
it is capable,
and which is already found in it, though in an
undeveloped
form (commeenveloppee)";35 and he sometimes
intimates that the possibility of an unlimited
advance lies be-
fore all monads:
'~The eternity which is reserved in the future
for all souls, or rather
for all animate
beings, is a vast field,
designed to give, though by degrees, the greatest perfection to
the universe."
36 Since Leibniz held that this belief was con-
firmed by "the
gradual
progress of physical observation,"
he
probably had in mind, interalia, such paleontological
and other
evidences as were then available of organic evolution -
evi-
dences which he had himself cited in the Protogaeaand other
writings
already
mentioned.
Phylogenetic
advance
was for
him, in consequence of his preformationist
embryology, always
the manifestation
of ontogenetic advance;
and any observable
fact which pointed to the probability
of the one pointed also to
the probability
of the other.
Thus with the increase of empiri-
cal knowledge "we attain
to the most sublime and most im-
portant
truths of metaphysics and of natural
theology"
-
the
truth here in question being that of the general progressiveness
of the universe.
But the "physical
observations"
which could
be invoked in support of such a theory were, it need hardly be
said, in the early eighteenth
century
very scanty;
the con-
siderations
which led Leibniz
and a number
of his contem-
poraries and immediate successors to adopt such a theory must
have chiefly consisted in those arguments"
of metaphysics and
natural
theology"
already
indicated
which,
intelligibly
enough, were converting
the once immutable
Chain of Being
into the program
of an endless Becoming.
Yet this introduction
of the doctrine of universal progress, at
once an individual,
biological, and cosmical evolution, into the
philosophy
of Leibniz split his system -
as the historians of
philosophy
have seldom, if ever, observed -
completely
in
two.
It conflicted, in the first place, with the principle of suffi-

260
THE
GREAT
CHAIN
OF BEING
cient reason, which he had so often declared
to be the first and
fundamental
truth of metaphysics.
That principle,
as we have
seen in an earlier
lecture,
required
the actualization
in the
created
world of all the ideal 'possibles'
in so far as they are
compossible.
But if, as we have also seen, it required
this at
one time, it required
it at all times; a 'necessary
and eternal
truth'
cannot
be in process of gradually
becoming
approxi-
mately true.
And -
another
aspect of the same consequence
-
the evolutionistic
version of the system played havoc with
the logic of the principle of plenitude
itself and with the theory
of monads.
It was an essential part
of that
theory
that
the
whole of reality
always consists of the same individuals
in a
fixed number.
The number
is fixed by the number
of degrees
of difference which the Eternal
Reason recognizes as possibly
subsisting between monads with respect to the function which
is characteristic
of them -
that of "mirroring"
or represent-
ing the universe
with greater
or less clarity
and distinctness.
There will be one thinking substance corresponding
to each of
these nuances;if it were not so, the universe would be an utterly
haphazard
thing, having no reason determining
its numerical
range.
The idea of monads as advancing
to higher grades did
not, as has been shown, formally contradict
the assumption
of
the constancy of their number;but it did conflict by implication
with
the doctrine
of the
immutable
identity
of the
"sub-
stances"
making
up that
number.
For -
by virtue
of the
principle
of the identity
of indiscernibles
-
what defines the
individuality
of a monad is the unique degree in which it real-
izes this function,
its place in the Scale of Being -
which, in
final analysis,
consists for Leibniz
simply
of the continuous
series of monads thus minutely differen tia ted from one another.
But if a monad
changes its place in the scale by becoming ca-
pable of a more adequate
representation
of the rest of the uni-
verse, it loses its identity.
In the case of rational
souls endowed
with memory
it was possible for Leibniz
to escape this diffi-
culty by resorting
to another
way of defining
the principium
individuationis:a being which recalls its past experiences
as its
own experience
has a continuing
sense of personal
identity
which may persist through
any number
of changes of any de-
gree.
But there are "sensitive"
and " animal"
souls as well as

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
26 I
rational,
and to these this psychological basis of individuality
is not attributed;
nor, indeed,
do human
minds remember
much of their past.
We are not able to identify ourselves as
having once been animalcules of such and such a kind on the
first morning
of creation.
Consequently,
the progress of all
monads
of lower grades, and of the monads which are now
human souls, during the earlier phases of their existence, im-
plied that the universe is not at all times composed of the same
individuals;
and the constancy of the number
could be main-
tained only if it were assumed that the advance of some, or all,
of the monads left gaps somewhere in the scale.
If they all ad-
vanced,
the lower rungs of the ladder would
be left vacant.
But this was irreconcilable
with the principle of plenitude -
and
consequently
with
the
principle
of sufficient
reason.
Either the number of existing monads was increased with the
course of time, or else there was -
what
Leibniz
virtually
denied -
a oacuumformarum, and the Creator, by failing to fill
up the grades which the progressive monads had vacated, was
guilty of at sometimedenying to some possible and compossible
essences in the series the grace of existence, the satisfaction of
their exigentiaexistendi. Finally, Leibniz's doctrine of universal
and perpetual
progress was obviously
an abandonment
of
optimism
(in the proper
philosophical
sense of the term) in
favor of meliorism.
This world is not"now, and, indeed, never
will be, "the best of possible worlds" ; it is only a world which
is in process of growing better.
It is true, however, that, for
Leibniz, a world thus forever falling short of perfection was
better than the optimist's"
best," becaUise a finite good inca-
pable of being transcended
lacks the first essential of value.
There are, then, two Leibnitian systems of philosophy, quite
irreconcilable
with one another -
though
their author
was
seemingly unaware of the fact.
If we are, as Professor Mon-
tague has suggested,
to classify philosophers
by their
char-
acteristic "visions"
of the universe, Leibniz had two visions:
one of them that outlined in Lecture V, the other that which
we have just seen. The first is the vision of a world which is
through and through rational,
fashioned completely, so far as
the nature of a created world permits, after the model of the
eternal order of the Ideas in the Divine Reason.
It was, there-

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
fore, in its essential structure,
an immutable
world.
Temporal
change, it could not be denied, is characteristic
of it, but it is
not a significant
characteristic;
in such a vision -
so close
akin to Spinoza's -
time is not "taken
seriously."
In the
other vision, the time-process,
conceived as a continuous
aug-
mentation
of realized
values, is the most significant
aspect of
reality -
and
change
is the
most
indispensable
mark
of
excellence."
From the labyrinth
of the Leibnitian
metaphysics,
cosmol-
ogy, and embryology
I turn to two poetic expressions of evolu-
tionism in the first half of the century.
Young in the Night
Thoughts(1742-44) gives it an astronomical
application.
Each
planet, or rather each solar system, Young supposes, has passed
through
a long gradual
series of stages of what we should now
call stellar evolution;
has risen
From obscure to bright,
By due gradation,
nature's sacred law.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . All the stars,
Those bright temptations to idolatry,
From darkness and confusion took their birth;
Sons of deformity:
from fluid dregs
Tartarean,first
they rose to masses rude;
And then, to spheres opaque;
then dimly shone;
Then brightened;
then blazed out in perfect day.
Nature delights in progress; in advance
From worse to better. 38
Young was presumably
constructing
this account of the normal
history of a star chiefly from his imagination,
It happens to be
not so widely divergent
from some recent
astronomical
hy-
potheses as might be expected;
but that, of course, was mainly
a lucky chance.
What
is of interest
in the passage is, once
more, the illustration
which it affords of the fact that the ap-
pearance
of the general
notion of our own and other stellar
systems as the scenes of an evolutionary
advance
long ante-
dated the discovery of most of the scientific evidence for that
hypothesis;
that it was becoming familiar in very widely read
writings before the middle of the eighteent ..h century;
and that
the development
of it seems to have been chiefly due to the in-
fluence of the principles of plenitude
and continuity,
conceived

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
263
as expressed in a succession and not in a ready-made
cosmical
order.
Young characteristically
turns this conception
also to
the uses of moral edification.
His youthful Lorenzo is bidden
to imitate the stars.
But it is not the usual sort of moral teach-
ing drawn
by so many other edifying writers from the con-
templation
of the heavens.
It is not in the regularity
or
changelessness
of behavior
of the stars in their courses that
man is to find a model for his own conduct,
but in their pro-
gressiveness,
their
continuous
passage
from
"low
to lofty,
from obscure to bright."
The moral imitation
of nature
in
this case consists in a conscious and deliberate
effort at per-
petual self-improvement.
When minds ascend,
Progress, in part, depends upon themselves.
o be a man!
and thou shalt be a god!
And half self-made!
Ambition how divine!
This, it will be noted,
was precisely opposite
to the moral
which Pope had, shortly before, drawn from the conception of
the static Chain of Being.
At almost the same time another and a better English poet
was elaborating
the theme much more fully, and -
naturally,
since he was also a physician -
with an emphasis upon its
biological rather
than its astronomical
bearings.
Akenside's
PleasuresoftheImaginationwas, as an authority
on the poetry of
this period has remarked, "aside from the EssayonMan and the
Night Thoughts, the greatest and most admired
philosophical
poem of the century";
39 and its most striking passages are a
vaguely evolutionistic version, in an eighteenth-century
poetic
style, of the cosmogony' of the
Timaeus. Akenside
was ac-
quainted
with Leibniz's
Theodicyand with some of his other
then published writings; but the chief inspiration
of his poem
is clearly Platonic.
He too begins with the World of Ideas;
before Nature was formed,
The Almighty One, then deep retir'd
In his unfathom'd
essence, view'd the forms,
The forms eternal of created things.
. . . . . . . . From the first
Of days, on them his love divine he fix'd,
His admiration:
till in time complete

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
What he admir'd and lov'd, his vital smile
Unfolded into being.
Hence the breath
Of life informing each organic frame,
Hence the green earth, and wild resounding waves;
Hence light and shade alternate;
warmth and cold;
And clear autumnal skies and vernal showers,
And all the fair variety of things.t?
The Sovereign Spirit of the world,
Though, self-collected from eternal time,
Within his own deep essence he beheld
The bounds of true felicity complete;
Yet by immense benignity inclin'd
To spread around him that primeval joy
Which fill'd himself, he raised his plastic arm,
And sounded through the hollow depths of space
The strong creative mandate."
Thus" from the wide complex of coexistent orders" there arose
one temporal world, "all involving and entire."
But here the
poet departs
from his Platonic
original.
He cannot
believe
that the process of time brings no enrichment
to reality, that
the world was as perfect and complete at its birth as it will
ever be.
No: its Author
beholding in the sacred light
Of his essential reason, all the shapes
Of swift contingence, all successive ties
Of action propagated
through the sum
Of possible existence, he at once,
Down the long series of eventful time,
So fix'd the dates of being, so dispos'd
To every living soul of every kind
The field of motion and the hour of rest,
Tha t all conspir'd to his supreme design,
To universal good: with full accord
Answering the mighty model he had chose,
The best and fairest of unnumber'd
worlds,
That lay from everlasting in the store
Of his divine conceptions.
Not content
By one exertion of creative power
His goodness to reveal to every age,
Through every moment up the tract of time
His parent hand with ever new increase
Of happiness and virtue has adorn'd
The vast harmonious frame:
his parent hand,

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
26 5
From the mute shell-fish gasping on the shore,
To men, to angels, to celestial minds,
Forever leads the generations on
To' higher scenes of being . . .
So all things which have life aspire to God,
The sun of being, boundless, unimpair'd
Cen tre of souls!
Each creature receives from Nature the means of participat-
ing in this universal progress, so that
in their stations all may persevere
To climb the ascent of being, and approach
For ever nearer to the life divine.P
Yet Akenside, it is interesting
to observe, is apparently
still in-
fluenced by the assumption
that the series of possible forms, if
it is to be rational,
must be kept" full";
for he assures us that
as this progress goes on,
Inferior orders in succession rise
To fill the void below.
On the other hand, in a later revision of the poem, while still
retaining
these lines, Akenside declares that not even in an in-
finite time will all the Ideas be realized in the created world:
the Forms of being, eternally"
plac'd in the essential Reason"
of the Deity, constitute
That vast ideal host which all his works
Through
endless ages never will reveal. 43
That Kant in the following decade propounded
a theory of
cosmic evolution is well known; what is less familiar is the fact
that in doing so he too was simply giving a temporalized
ver-
sion of the principle of plenitude.
That this principle was for
him a fundamental
maxim of philosophical cosmology we have
already seen.
The creative potentiality
of the world-ground
is
infinite;
and "the
number
and excellence of the systems of
worlds"
which swarm in the infinity of space must be "com-
mensurate
with
the immensity
of their
Creator."
44
"The
fruitfulness of Nature
is without limits, since it is nothing but
the exercise of the divine omnipotence."
45 But this conversion
of an infinite ideal possibility into concrete actuality
does not
take place all at once.
The universe began its history in a state

266
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
of relative simplicity;
it has grown increasingly larger, more
various, more complex, with the lapse of ages; and the inex-
haustibility of its source is the ground of our assurance that it
must continue to do so in the future.
In the application
of these postulates in the AllgemeineNa-
turgeschichteKant is concerned chiefly with pre-organic evolu-
tion -
the formation of stellar systems and systems of systems.
His cosmogony is an attempt
to combine the implications
of
the principle of plenitude with the astronomical knowledge of
his time;
the details he professes to work out upon purely
mechanical principles, but these are in fact constantly supple-
mented by the metaphysical
assumptions with which we are
familiar.
The
existence of matter
is presupposed.
In the
"original
condition of nature"
all the material
of which the
future stellar systems were to be composed existed in the form
of particles diffused through infinite space.
But even in deter-
mining the presumable character of this initial phase of cosmi-
cal history Kant is influenced by a combination of the principle
of plenitude
with mechanical
considerations.
"Even
in the
essential properties of the elements"
that constituted
this pri-
meval chaos, "there
could be traced the mark of that com-
pleteness [Vollkommenheit]which they derive from their origin,
inasmuch as their nature
is but a consequence of the eternal
Idea of the divine. Intelligence.
The matter which appears to
be merely passive and without form and arrangement
has even
in its simplest state an urge [Bestrebung]to fashion itself by a
natural
evolution into a more perfect constitution."
46 What
Kant means by this, in concrete terms, is that the elementary
particles were not all alike; "the kinds of this primary matter"
were" without doubt infinitely diverse, in accordance with the
immensity which nature manifests on all sides."
This is not,
however, to be taken literally.
The differences in question are
not definitely declared to be qualitative, nor are the laws of the
behavior of the original bits of matter various; Kant did not
anticipate
Peirce's tychism.
But the prime particles at least
differed"
as much as possible" in specific density and" attrac-
tive force," and -
in consequence
of this -
they were un-
equally
diffused through
space.
Kant
apparently
reasoned
that if this were not the case no sort of mechanical explanation

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
267
of the beginning of the process which he is to describe could be
given: the totality of matter, without such initial inequalities in
density and distribution, would have remained in an eternal
equilibrium.
But, given these, there must have taken place a
condensation of the heaviest particles at a certain point.
From
this centre the diffusion progressively thinned out in proportion
to the levity of the particles."
But the" primary activation"
of nature which was due to this local condensation led to the
formation there of a "world,"
that is, of a system of planets and
satellites revolving around
a central mass.
Kant
attributes
this, in general,
to the action of gravitational
and inertial
forces, but the mechanics of it remains, if I am not mistaken,
somewhat obscure. From this nucleus" the creation, or rather
the development
(Ausbildung), of Nature spreads by degrees
...
with a continuous advance to an ever greater breadth, in
order that, in the process of eternity, the infinity of space may
be filled with worlds and systems of worlds."
Since the forma-
tion of a solar system requires many millions of years, different
stages of stellar evolution
are always simultaneously
repre-
sented, verging from the highest stage thus far reached, which
is of course at the centre, to the bare beginnings in the outlying
regions -
beyond which cosmical frontiers, in his view, lies
matter in a merely "confused and chaotic condition,"
the raw
material of worlds yet to be born.
Though this process had a
beginning, it will never end; die Schopfungist niemalsoollendet.
"It
is forever busy achieving new ascents of nature, bringing
into existence new things and new worlds."
48
No doubt each of these separate worlds, and congeries of
worlds, after it has at the end of vast aeons reached "the ma-
turity of its development,"
will be subject to a reverse process
of dissolution and eventual destruction;
but the infinite fe-
cundity of Nature warrants us in believing that the losses sus-
tained by the universe in one region will be compensated, and
more than compensated, by the production of new worlds else-
where."
Between the law which dooms every part in its turn
to final dissolution and the law that the universe as a whole
makes incessantly for greater
fullness and variety of being
there is no conflict; on the contrary, Kant finds that the one is
a corollary of the other.
"Nothing
is more congruous with the

268
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
abundance
(Reichtum) of Nature"
than the transiency
of all
that it produces.
"For if a system has, in the long period of its
existence, exhausted all the diversity of which its constitution is
capable,
and has thus become a superfluous
member
of the
Chain of Beings, nothing
is more fitting than that it should
then play its final role in the cosmic spectacle of ever-lapsing
change -
the role which becomes every finite thing, that of
paying its tribute to mortality."
Thus to Kant at this time continuous development
and pro-
gressive diversification
is the supreme law of nature,
not only
for the universe as a whole but for every component
of it, from
solar systems to individual
living beings.
But in any part the
latent
potentialities
of development
have a fixed limit;
and
when all the"
manifoldness"
of which it is capable
has been
realized, it no longer fits into the cosmic scheme.
Nature
has
no more use for that which has ceased to grow, and, sometimes
slowly, sometimes speedily and catastrophically,
eliminates it.
Not only is the Chain
of Being as a whole perpetually
self-
expansive, but it will tolerate no links which do not conform
to the same law.
Yet Kant
thinks it reasonable
to assume that even the la-
cunae caused by the death of worlds will not be permitted
by
Nature to remain unfilled; this is " an idea which is as probable
as it is conformable
to the general plan of the divine works."
50
When a solar system, through the slowing down of the motions
of its component
parts, collapses and the planets fall into the
central mass, the whole process starts over again, and so on in
saeculasaeculorur.n.
In, roughly, the third quarter
of the century theories which
may, in a broad sense, be called evolutionistic multiplied.
The
general hypothesis of the derivation
of all present species from
a small number,
or perhaps a single pair, of original ancestors
was propounded
by the President
of the Berlin Academy
of
Sciences, Maupertuis,
in 1745 and 175 I, and by the principal
editor of the Encyclopidie,Diderot,
in 1749 and
1754-51 The
assumption
of continuity
played some part in Diderot's
argu-
ment in his suggestion of this theory in the Penseessur l'interpri-
tationdela Nature (1754); but in the main these two expressions
of transformism were independent
of the group of ideas which

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
269
concern
us here.
The evolutionist
tendency
was manifesting
itself in diverse quarters,
and under the influence of differing
considerations.
Yet, even when the principles of plenitude and
continuity,
and the difficulties in maintaining
the conception of
the immutable
Chain of Being, were not important
factors in
promoting
this tendency,
the result was, nevertheless,
to in-
crease the pressure towards the transformation
of those prin-
ciples into what I have called their temporalized
form. In some
cases the growth of the philosophy of change led, by a natural
consequence,
to the explicit rejection of the assumption that all
species must always exist -
as in a passage of d'Holbach's
Systemede la Nature (1770):
Of those who ask, why does not nature produce new beings, we inquire
in turn how they know that she does not do so. What authorizes them to
believe this sterility in nature?
Do they know whether, in the combinations
she is at every instant forming, nature is not occupied in prod ueing new
beings without the cognizance of these observers?
Who told them whether
nature be not now assembling in her vast laboratory
the elements fitted to
give rise to wholly new generations, that will have nothing in common with
the species at present existing.
What absurdity, then, would there be in sup-
posing that man, the horse, the fish, the bird, will be no more?
Are these
animals so indispensable to Nature that without them she cannot continue
her eternal course?
Does not all change around us? Do we not ourselves
change? . . .
Nature contains no constant forms. 62
But the most interesting
and curious example of the trans-
formation
which the Chain of Being was undergoing
in this
period is to be found in the writings, late in the third quarter of
the century, of the FrenchphilosopheJ.
B. Robinet.
He did not,
it is true, have a high repute in his own time, and the historians
of eighteenth-century
thought
have usually done him some-
thing less than justice.
This has been chiefly due to the fact
that, in his excursions into the field of natural
history, he fell
into some absurdities
by which he became
better
known to
posterity than l>xhis more creditable
performances.
Yet even
in these absurdities he is illustrative of certain aspects of the his-
toric phenomenon
which we are concerned
with.
The con-
sequences of the pressure upon Occidental
thought of the prin-
ciples of plenitude
and continuity
range, as you have already
had opportunity
to judge, from the sublime to the ridiculous;
and if in Robinet
we find, among other things, some. of the

270
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
chapters of comedy in this history, an examination
of his ideas
is hardly on that account the less to our purpose.
And on the
other hand, he sometimes shows a good deal of philosophical
acumen
as well as originality
in penetrating
to new implica-
tions, or possible new interpretations,
of old assumptions.
His
merit lay in the characteristic
which Grimm
found to be his
principal
defect; he had in a high degree the esprit de systeme,
and insisted on carrying out to what he conceived, sometimes
rightly, to be their full consequences
premises which his pre-
decessors had left undeveloped.
And he was, in any case, an
early representative
of conceptions which were to be taken up
by certain
more eminent
writers,
poets, and philosophers
of
the following decades, were to enjoy in the Romantic
period
great vogue and influence, and were to be revived in our own.
In the earlier volumes of his magnum opus, De la Nature
53
(1761-68) Robinet dwells rather upon the static than the tem-
poralized
form of the conception
of the Chain of Being.
The
third volume was in the main an especially full and methodical
restatement
and defence of the principle
of plenitude
and of
all the familiar deductions
which had, for the most part sepa-
rately,
been drawn
from it by various
earlier
writers -
the
temporal
infinity of the creation,
both in past and future, its
spatial
infinity,
the numberlessness
of inhabited
worlds, and
the fullness of the series of beings.
The activity of the Sale Cause is complete;
in the product of this activity
is everything that could exist. . . .
The work of the Creator would have
been incomplete if aught could be added to it. . . .
He has filled the fossil
kingdom with all possible combinations -
earths and salts and oils and
rock-forming substances and metals.
He has made all vegetable species
which could exist.
All the minute gradations of animality are filled with
as many beings as they can contain.
The animal mind exists under all the
forms fitted to receive it. M
And since the same logic which requires us to suppose that the
Infinite Cause was never inactive
also requires us to suppose
that its activity has always been exercised to the full, it follows
that there have always been present in the universe as many
kinds of creature
as there are now.
"Can
God, then, no more
make anything
new?"
asks Robinet,
and answers flatly that
he cannot, "for he has already made everything
-
all possible

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
271
extension, all possible matter, all possible intelligences, all pos-
sible beings."
55 It may not seem so to us; but "we must be
very careful not to judge of the system of the world by the
small sample of it with which we are acquainted."
Besides the
innumerable
multitude
of organisms which we.can see, "how
many more are hidden in the depths of the sea, on the summits
of mountains, and in deserts!
How many others ...
elude the
powers of even our best instruments!"
And those kinds that
are missing here are doubtless to be found on other globes;
"and who can count the number of globes that form the total
system? . . . But we are sure that there are as many of them as
can be, and that each possesses all that it can in all possible
respects, in such wise that the Creator could not have made
more in any class. Otherwise, he would have acted with parti-
ality, would have exercised but a portion of his power;
and
this cannot be supposed without contradiction."
56
Unfortunately
for his reputation,
Robinet
pushed his faith
in the fullness of nature to somewhat startling lengths.
He is
perhaps best known to fame, not for his place in the history of
biological evolutionism, nor for his frequently acute and scep-
tical philosophical reasonings, but for his belief in the reality of
l'hommemarin. "There
is," he writes, "so much authentic testi-
mony to the existence of fish-men and fish-women
(human
with respect to the upper part of their bodies) that it would be
obstinacy to doubt it."
For example,---"several persons worthy
of credence"
had, as recorded by Thomas Bartholin, testified
that "in
I 669 a siren appeared
in the port of Copenhagen."
Though the witnesses were unhappily
not in accord as to the
color of her hair, " all agreed that she had the visage of a beard-
less man and a forked tail."
The Histoiregeneraledesvoyageshad
told how in 1560 some Cingalese fishermen
had caught
as
many as seven mermen
in their net.
A living female of the
species had even been exhibited in Paris in 1758, doubtless by
some ingenious precursor of Mr. Barnum.
Again, one could
read in the Dilices de la Hollandeof a femme marinestranded
in
that country
after an inundation,
who was taken to Edam,
"permitted
herself to be clothed,"
and was taught to sew, but
could never learn to speak, "and
always retained
an instinct
which led her towards the water."
Nor were these interesting

27 2
THE GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
creatures
peculiar
to the Old World;
a ship's captain
who,
oddly,
was nomme Schmidt, though
Anglais de nation, "saw
in
1614 in New England
a siren of great beauty, in no respect in-
ferior to the most beautiful women."
Robinet
cites more than
a score of other witnesses who had enjoyed similar privileges;
and the fifth volume of his De la Nature is embellished with sev-
eral agreeable
representations
of these less familiar links in the
Chain of Being.
This sort of credulity
is not to be set down
wholly to the personal
discredit
of Robinet.
It was a suffi-
ciently natural
result of the belief that nature
is capablede tout;
even so sober a mind as Locke had, it will be remembered,
in-
cluded "what
is confidently reported
of mermaids or sea-men"
among
the possible examples
of the infinite variety
and the
continuity
of the series of natural
forms. 57 Given the principle
of plenitude,
which most well-instructed
persons then accepted
in theory, it followed that the existence of aquatic
anthropoids
was more probable
than their non-existence.
As Robinet
him-
self put it -
very much
as Descartes
had done -
"I
have
formed so vast an idea of the work of the Creator that from the
fact that a thing can exist I infer readily
enough that it does
exist."
There
was thus no reason
for an attitude
of harsh
scepticism towards the worthy seafaring
men and others who
had
reported
having
actually
seen such animals.
As Lord
Monboddo
observed
in 1774 (a propos of stories of "tailed
men"):
"A
modest
inquirer
into
nature
will set no other
bound
to the variety
of her
productions,
than
that
which
Aristotle has set, in that famous maxim of his, adopted,
I see,
by Mr. Buffon, quicquidfieri potest,fit, and everything
can exist
that does not imply a contradiction.
We ought, therefore,
to
listen to credible evidence concerning
the existence of any ani-
mal,
however
strange,
unless we can take upon
us to pro-
nounce decisively, that it is impossible by nature
that such an
animal should exist."
58 The notion of the Chain of Being, in
short, though favorable
to certain new hypotheses which were
destined to playa
part of the utmost importance
in the scien-
tific thought
of the subsequent
century,
was certainly
not con-
ducive
to the cautious
and sceptical
temper
requisite
in the
verification
of hypotheses.
Even
in his first volume
Robinet
adopted
Turgot's
and

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE
CHAIN OF BEING
273
Rousseau's notion of perfectibility and applied it to all living
beings, though with the assumption of limits fixed by the pre-
ordained potentialities of each species. "Every being cherishes
its own existence and seeks to expand it, and little by little at-
tains the perfection of its species."
59
Thus from the outset
Robinet was an opponent of the still influential primitivism.
The human
mind must be subject to the general law.
We cannot see
what could arrest the progress of its knowledge, or oppose its development,
or stifle the activity of this spirit, all of fire as it is, which has certainly a
destiny, since nothing has been made in vain.
Its destiny can be nothing
other than to exercise imagination,
to invent,
and to perfect.
No; men
were not made to wander in the forests after the manner of bears and tigers. 60
"The true State of Nature is," then, "not that in which beings
find themselves at their birth, apart from the additions which
they are able to give to themselves by virtue of an internal
energy or to receive from the action of external objects upon
them."
"Society, therefore, is the work of Nature, since it is a
natural
product of human perfectibility,
equally fertile of evil
and of good.
Arts and sciences, laws, the diversity of the forms
of government,
war and commerce -
everything,
in short, is
only a development.
The seeds of all were latent in Nature;
they have unfolded, each in its own time.
Perhaps she still re-
tains in her womb other germs, of slower growth,
of which
future races will reap the fruits.
Then genius will expand and
take on a still greater form.
The tree of science will acquire
new branches.
As the catalogue of the arts is extended, their
scope will become more ample.
Thus new vices and other
virtues will manifest themselves."
But let it not be supposed
that any creatures"
have the power to transcend their natural
state; they are held within it by bonds not to be broken.
If
some have the power to modify their existence, this liberty
does not pass beyond the limits of their species."
61
Robinet,
however, at this point, characteristically,
becomes
sensible of a difficulty.
If perfectibility is an attribute
of man,
why has so great a part of the species failed to manifest it? Why
do many races remain in the state of savagery?
The explana-
tion Robinet, amusingly enough, finds in the universal solvent
-
the principle
of plenitude:
"it

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the classes of animality -
must make both domesticable
ani-
mals and animals incapable
of being tamed, savage man and
men capable of social life."
62 In short, a full universe must
contain unprogressive
as well as progressive creatures.
But perfectibility is soon extended
by Robinet from a tend-
ency to progress within
the limits of specific characters
to a
universal cosmicallaw.
Doubtless, as Leibniz and Bonnet had
maintained,
the "germs"
of all things have always existed;
but these all contain within themselves an internal principle of
development
which drives them on through
a vast series of
metamorphoses
through
which
they ascend
the "universal
scale."
And, as in Leibniz, the assurance of the infinite prog-
ress of the whole universe is curiously connected
with
the
mathematical
principle of the infinite divisibility of the con-
tinuum.
All germs have individual differences;
that is to say, their life, organiza-
tion, animality,
have nuanceswhich distinguish
each of them from all the
others.
There are no elements except the germs;
all the elemen ts are there-
fore heterogeneous.
These elements are not simple beings; simplicity is
not an attribute
compatible
with matter.
Elements are composed of other
elements;
or germs are composed of other germs.
There is no natural nor
artificial process which can bring an element, or germ, to the last degree of
possible division.
Germs, as germs, are indestructible.
They can be dis-
solved into other germs only after the completion or the beginning of their
development;
in the state of germ they admit of no division.
In the resolu-
tion of a developed
germ into a multiplicity
of other germs, there is no
matter
that dies.
All of it remains alive; only its form and combinations
change.
The germs considered
as forms or moulds pass;
considered
as
organized
and living matter,
they do not pass.
This is to say that there is
no destruction of anything in nature, but a continuous transformation.
The
idea of succession enters necessarily into the definition of Nature.
Nature
is the successive sum of phenomena
which result from the development
of
the germs. . . .
The series [of germs] is inexhaustible,
whether read back-
ward into the past or forward into the future.
A germ which has begun to
develop and has encountered
an insurmountable
obstacle to the continu-
ance of this development,
does net retrogress to its original state.
It strug-
gles against this obstacle until its useless efforts bring about its dissolution,
as its complete development
would also naturally
have done.P
Robinet accordingly makes his own a proposition which had
been suggested by Diderot some two decades earlier. 64
The existence of Nature
is necessarily successive. . . .
A state of per-
manence does not befit it.
Germs created all together do not all develop

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
275
together.
The law of their generations,
or manifestations,
brings about
these developments one after another.
. ..
In this continual vicissitude,
there are no two points in the existence of Nature precisely similar in whole
or in part.
Though always the same, it is always different.
I answer, there-
fore, that it is true that Nature never has been, and will never again be, pre-
cisely what she is at the moment at which I am speaking. . . . I doubt
not that there was a time when there were not yet either minerals or any of
the beings that we call animals;
that is to say, a time when all these individ-
uals existed only in germ, and not one of them had come to birth.
. . .
At
least it appears certain that Nature has never been, is not, and never will be
stationary, or in a state of permanence;
its form is necessarily transitory.
. . .
Nature is always at work, always in travail, in the sense that she is
always fashioning new developments, new generations. 65
Both before and after this apparently
evolutionistic
trans-
formation
of the principle
of plenitude,
Robinet
is equally
zealous in developing and illustrating
the implications
of the
loi de continuite. That principle itself, he observed, needs no de-
fence; it is one which" the philosophers have long affirmed and
reiterated."
It is "the first axiom of natural philosophy"
that
the Scale of Beings constitutes a whole infinitely graduated,
with no real
lines of separation;
that there are only individuals, and no kingdoms or
classes or genera or species. . . .
This great and important truth, the key
to the universal system, and the basis of all true philosophy, will day by
day become more evident, as we progress in the study of Nature. 66
Yet Robinet complains that some naturalists "whom its im-
perious force had constrained
to render homage to it" in gen-
eral terms, nevertheless failed to carry out this law rigorously.
Thus Bonnet, "grand
amateur de la loi de continuite " though
he was, had still thought
it possible to "divide
the different
orders which constitute
the scale of being into four general
classes: (I) inorganic, (2) organic but inanimate
(i. e., plants),
(3) organic and animate, but without reason, (4) organic, ani-
mate, and rational."
Such a classification, Robinet contends,
is a plain denial of continuity, because it credits some classes of
beings with the possession of certain positive attributes
which
others absolutely lack.
"The
negative is always at an infinite
distance from the positive," hence distinctions between mem-
bers of the series should always be in terms, not of positive and
negative,
but of more and less of some common
character.
And when this consideration
is borne in mind, the principle of

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
continuity is seen to have sweeping philosophical consequences
usually overlooked.
Every purely qualitativedifference between
two things -
whatever be true of differences of position, quan-
tity, or degree -
is necessarily a discontinuity.
The only way
to save the principle,
therefore,
is by supposing all things to
have some degree or measure of any quality which is possessed
by anything.
Thus to the lowest orders of being must be as-
cribed
some rudiments
of the attributes
conspicuous
in the
highest, and to the highest some vestiges of the characteristics
of the lowest.
What continuity
can there be between the organic and the inorganic,
between the animate and the inanimate, between the rational and the non-
rational?
It is evident that there is no mean between' the positive and the
negative, and consequently, that there are no intermediate
beings which
link the two together.
If there were such beings, it would be necessary that
their constitution
should simultaneously
participate
in two mutually
ex-
clusive contraries;
. . . e. g., that the passage from inorganic
to organic
should be filled up by a middle sort of beings which are both organic and
inorganic.
But such beings are self-contradictory
(repugnent). If we wish
to 'leave the law of continuity
standing,
. . . if we wish to allow Nature
to pass insensibly from one of her productions to another, without compelling
her to make leaps, we must not admit the existence of any inorganic beings,
or any inanimate,
or any non-rational.
. . .
Where there is a single es-
sential quality (an essentialone, I say) characteristic
of a certain number of
beings to the exclusion of others, ...
the chain is broken, the law of con-
tinuity becomes a chimera, and the idea of a whole an absurdity. 67
This was an acute and important
observation upon the con-
cept of the qualitative
continuum.
It made explicit, and gen·
eralized, the logic which was to be more vaguely and less con-
sistently followed by many
later
philosophers.
One of the
principal motives, for example, of panpsychism in the philoso-
phy of our own time is the desire to avoid the discontinuity
which is manifestly implied' by the supposition that conscious-
ness or sentiency is an "emergent"
property or function, which
abruptly supervenes at a certain level of the integration of mat-
ter, and at a certain stage in planetary
evolution.
Underlying
all such reasoning is the assumption
of the necessity of what
may be called the "retrotensive
method"
68 -
the rule that
whatever is empirically found in or associated with the more
.complex and highly evolved natural entities must inferentially

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
277
be read back into the simpler and earlier ones.
But where
later writers have, as a rule, applied this method only spas-
modically and without full realization of its general import,
Robinet saw that it must either be applied universally or be
admitted to have no cogency at all. The result, it will perhaps
seem to the judicious reader, was simply a reductioad absurdum
of the principle of continuity.
But to Robinet it was the estab-
lishment, by a single stroke of logic, of a whole group of im-
portant philosophical conclusions -
among them, hylozoism,
panpsychism, and a peculiar sort of panlogism, a doctrine of
the ubiquity
of the rudiments
of rationality
in all natural
things.
For myself I would rather give even intelligence to the least atom of
matter -
provided it were in a degree and of a quality suitable to it -
than refuse organization
to the fossils and make of them isolated beings,
having no connection with others.
It is to no purpose to tell me that this
is a bizarre opinion, and that it is not possible that a stone thinks.
I should
deem it a sufficient reply to say that I am not responsible for consequences
correctly deduced, that I have not measured the extent of what is possible,
and that, if the law of continuity is admitted, we ought likewise to admit
all that follows from it; while it is inexcusable to abandon so general a
principle without
a sufficient reason. 69
Though the non-existence of mere "brute
matter"
is thus
inferrible from the principle of continuity alone, Robinet does
not fail to offer further argument
for the conclusion, with a
prolixity which I shall not emulate .. But a further (for him) im-
portant consequence of the same observation upon the logical
meaning of the lex continuimust be noted; for it involves a re-
striction by that principle of the scope of the principle of pleni-
tude, of which it was nevertheless conceived to be a corollary.
Since there is no continuous series unless all members of the
series have something in common, though in differing degrees,
it follows, Robinet finds, that there must be a single anatomical
type-form common to all living things -
which is to say, to all
things. And this must, of course, be a particular form, distinct
from all other possible forms; so that the" fullness" of nature
is limited to the realization of all possible variations
upon a
single "prototype."

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
There was only one possible plan of organic or animal existence, but
this plan could be, and must be, varied in an infinity of ways. The unity
of model or plan maintained
in the prodigious diversity of its forms is the
basis of the continuity or graduated sequence of beings. All differ from one
another,
but all these differences are natural
variations of the prototype,
which must be regarded as the element generative of all beings. . . .
When
I compare the stone with the plant, the plant with the insect, the insect
with the reptile, the reptile with the quadruped,
I perceive, through all the
differences which characterize
each of them, relations of analogy which
persuade me that they have all been conceived and formed in accordance
with a single model (dessein), of which they are variations
graduated
ad
infinitum. They exhibit all the salient traits ...
of this original exemplar,
which in realizing itself has taken on successively the infinitely numerous
and diverse forms under which Being manifests itself to our eyes.??
But a pattern
exemplified
equally
in so great a variety of
shapes IrIUSt,it is evident, be itself simple and meagre in the last
degree.
The prototype
is nothing
more than an "elongated
tube or hollow cylinder,
naturally
active."
But in asserting
that this is the "model"
of which all organic forms are vari-
ants, Robinet
often seems really to mean that it is the unit of
which all organic structures
are integrations;
in other words,
his" prototype,"
in the concrete, is equivalent
to what he calls
an "organe,"
which is in turn equivalent
to a protoplasmic
cell.
71 His quest of continuity
here, in short, has led him to the
conclusion that all living things are built up of ultimate
units
of the same general shape and homogeneous
in their proper-
ties.
But why they should unite into structures
so various in
form, the law of continuity
can hardly be invoked to explain;
nor is it evident that the grosser structures
are a continuous
series in the sense required.
Robinet
thus seems to have es-
caped some of the difficulties of his thesis here by conveniently
confusing the idea of a community
of form between gross struc-
tures with the idea of a community
of form (and function)
between the component
units of gross structures.
Here too Robinet
was merely elaborating
and extending
a
suggestion
of Diderot's,
similarly
connected
with the postu-
lates of plenitude
and continuity.
Diderot
had
written
in
1754:
It seems that Nature has taken pleasure in varying the same mechanism
in an infinity of different ways. She abandons one type (genre)of products
only after having multiplied individuals in all possible modes.
When one

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
279
considers the animal kingdom, and observes that, among the quadrupeds,
there is not one of which the functions and the parts, above all the internal
parts, are not entirely similar to those of another quadruped,
would not
one readily believe that Nature has done no more than lengthen, shorten,
transform, multiply, or obliterate, certain organs?
Imagine the fingers of
the hand united, and the substance of the nails so abundant
that, swelling
and spreadingv.it envelops the whole, and instead of the hand of a man you
have the foot of a horse.
When one sees the successive metamorphoses of
the envelope of the prototype, whatever it may have been, approximate one
another, from one to another kingdom, by insensible degrees, and people
the confines of the two regions (if it is permissible to speak of confines where
there is no real division) with beings of uncertain
and ambiguous kinds,
divested in great part of the forms, qualities, functions of the one, and en-
dowed with the forms, qualities and functions of the other -
who would
not feel persuaded
to believe that there has never been but one primary
being, prototype of all beings?
But whether this philosophic conjecture be
admitted
with Doctor
Baumann
[Maupertuis]
or rejected with M. de
Buffon, it will not be denied that it is necessary to adopt it as a hypoth-
esis essential to the progress of experimental
physical science, to the dis-
covery and
the explanation
of those phenomena
which depend
upon
organiza tion, 72
By "prototype"
Robinet
usually
meant,
however,
not
sirnplya primordial germ of all organisms, but an ideal model
or pattern
embodied in countless differing particulars:
lepro-
totypeestunprincipeintellectuelquines'alterequ'enserialisantdansla
matiere.73 It is thus a model which represents the living being
"reduced
to its lowest terms; it is an inexhaustible
ground of
variations.
Each variation
realized constitutes
a being, and
may be called a metamorphosis
of the prototype,
or rather of
its original envelope, which was its first realization."
A great
number of accumulated
variations"
may so disguise the orig-
inal that it escapes us"; yet we may be sure that in every case
the underlying unity is there.
If Robinet had limited the ap-
plication of this notion to the vertebrates he would have been
expressing a definite scientific fact, already abundantly
estab-
lished by the anatomical
knowledge of his time; but the prin-
ciple of continuity,
as construed
by him, compelled
him to
postulate a single model for all animate
and even inanimate
natural
individuals."
Thus Robinet, though not the origina-
tor, was (so far as I know) the first elaborator
and enthusiastic
champion of that notion of an Urbild, upon which all organic
and perhaps all natural forms are variations, which was to be

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
taken up by Herder
75 and to become almost an obsession of
Goethe at one period.
Alle Glieder bilden sich aus nach ew'gen Gesetzen,
Vnd die seltenste Form bewahrt im geheimen das Urbild.I"
Robinet
wavers, however, between two ways of conceiving
of what Nature is about in her incessant travail.
Sometimes he
sees in it merely an illustration
of what, in our terminology,
we
have called the temporalized
form of the principle
of pleni-
tude: it is an effort to multiply variety to the greatest possible
degree.
If the march of Nature seems to us sometimes uncertain and ill-assured,
if she seems sometimes to operate in a fumbling, devious, equivocal manner,
it is a false appearance, due only to our ignorance and our prejudices.
We
forget that she should not and cannot let any nuance,any variation, go un-
realized;
we fail to see the too subtle differences of contiguous forms. . . .
Nature does nothing useless, her course is minutely graded
inuancie), and
each nuanceis necessary in the total plan.
The forms which we so ineptly
take for irregularities, redundancies, inutilities, belong to the infinite order
of beings and fill a place which would be empty without them.??
But in other passages Robinet,
under
the influence
of the
idea of the universal
prototype,
sees in the past history of the
formation of new species something more than an urge towards
promiscuous
variation;
a movement
of Nature
in one general
direction is discernible,
a striving towards a particular
goal -
though
the movement
is stumbling
and full of deviations,
a
progress, as we should now say, by trial-and-error.
Thus the
multiplicity
of forms is, in part,
a consequence
of Nature's
tending
towards
a consummation
not clearly foreseen.
Her
workshop contains many unsuccessful and discarded
models.
In the prodigiously varied sequence of the animals below man, I see
Nature in labor advancing fumblingly towards that excellent being who
crowns her work.
However imperceptible
the progress which she makes
in one step, that is, in each new production,
in each variation upon the
original design which she achieves, nevertheless the advance becomes clearly
sensible after a certain number of metamorphoses.
. . .
All the varieties
intermediate
between the prototype and man I regard as so many essays
of Nature, aiming at the most perfect, yet unable to attain it except through
this innumerable sequence of sketches.
I think we may call the collection
of the preliminary studies the apprenticeship of Nature in learning to make
a man.P

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
28 I
When man is thus viewed as the objective of the slow proc-
esses of creation,
up to its present phase, the unity and spec-
ificity which
is the characteristic
of the successive series of
forms can -
Robinet now suggests -
be better recognized by
considering the goal rather than the start; i. e., by seeing in the
other forms adumbrations
of man's,
rather
than
in man or
other relatively high types variations
upon a primitive
simple
model.
This is the theme of the Parallele, in which (if it is his
own) his zeal again got the better of his discretion:
Envisaging the sequence of individuals as so many steps in the progress
of being towards humanity,
we shall compare each of these with man, first
with respect to his higher faculties, that is, his reason.
This new way of
contemplating
Nature and her productions, which refers them all to a single
idea generative of the world, is founded upon the law of continuity which
links together all the parts of this great whole,
Each [organic] mechanism
tends immediately
and of itself to produce only that which we see it in fact
engendering;
but the sum of these mechanisms tends towards the final out-
come; and we here take man as the final outcome, in order to limit our-
selves to terrestrial beings, which alone are within our knowledge,
In the quest of these adumbrations
of the human
form in the
lower orders of creation,
Robinet
was unhappily
led to find
similitudes of faces, as well as of arms and legs, in the radish
and other plants, and to publish drawings
of these vegetable
anthropoids.. 79
But the curiously mixed historic role of Robinet may be fur-
ther seen in the fact that the type of biological evolutionism
which he adopted
was developed
by him into a general phi-
losbphy of nature
of an essentially'
Romantic'
sort; it antici-
pated some of the most characteristic
conceptions
both of the
Naturphilosophieof Schelling and of Bergson's in our own time."
Robinet
was one of the earlier prophets
of the elan vital. The
fundamental
reality in nature
for him is not matter
but l'ac-
tioiti ; and the pageant
of evolution is the manifestation
of the
expansive, self-differentiating
energy, the creative urge, of this
puissanceactive. Yet (as his final volume admits) inert matter,
in some sense, also must be recognized;
and between it and the
active principle
there is an age-long struggle.
At the begin-
ning, and in the lower grades of the Scale of Being, brute mat-
ter is dominant;
the tendency
to spontaneous
action is wholly
clogged by it; but little by little the force that makes for life

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
gains strength, and finally, in man, establishes its dominance so
completely that matter
becomes less an obstacle than the in-
strument whereby that force achieves its ends.
(The principle
of continuity
seems here to have disappeared.)
In the inferior beings, such as minerals and vegetables, we refer all the
phenomena
that
occur to matter,
as the principal
constituent
(ie fond
principal) of these beings. . . .
A Iittle higher in the scale, we begin to
doubt;
we are undecided.
We remark a spontaneity
of movements and
operations
which
discloses an
active
principle
which
we cannot
but
attribute to them.
Nevertheless, this activity may still be seen to be dragged
along and invincibly determined by matter, so that, in such systems, matter
and activity appear to dominate by turns, being alternately
principal and
accessory, according to circumstances.
The active power seems to be mak-
ing efforts to raise itself above the extended, solid, impenetrable
mass to
which it is chained, but of which it is often compelled to submit to the yoke.
In man, on the contrary, it is evident that matter is only the organ through
which the active principle brings its faculties into play.
The former is an
envelope which modifies the action of the latter, one without which it would
perhaps act more freely, but also without which, perhaps, it could not act
at all, and without which it assuredly could not render its activities sensible.
Does it not, once more, seem that the active power grows and perfects itself
in being, in proportion as it raises itself above matter?
. ..
Such, according
to this hypothesis, would be the progression of the active force inherent in
matter.
At first it would be but the smallest portion of being.
By a multi-
plication of efforts and progressive developments,
it would succeed in be-
coming the principal part.
I am strongly inclined to believe that this force
is the most essential and the most universal attribute
of being (iefond de
['etre)-
and that
matter
is the organ whereby
this force manifests its
operations.
If I am asked to define my conception of such a force, I shall
answer, with a number of philosophers, that I represent it to myself as a
tendency to change for the better;
since every change is the proximate pre-
disposition to another and better one. 81
And the end of the process is not yet, Robinet adds:
La progressionn'estpasfinie. There may be forms more subtle, potencies
more active, than those which compose man.
The force may, indeed, be
able to rid itself insensibly of all materiality, and so to begin a new world -
but we must not let ourselves go astray in the boundless regions of the pos-
sible. 82
Here, manifestly, is a philosophy of I'evolutioncriatricein out-
line; and its resemblance
to its twentieth-century
counterpart
is heightened
by the fact that it too is, in the end, puzzlingly
combined with a species of phenomenalism;
the matter which

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
283
hampers
the active principle
is nevertheless
its product
and
exists only as an appearance,
while the active principle
is in
itself non-spatial.
Accustomed as we are to judge of the reality of things by the appearances
which strike our senses, we are unwilling to admit that anything exists in the
world except matter, since we see only matter.
And, to borrow the words
of a modern author, since all the modifications which our senses observe in
Nature consist simply in the variation of the limits of extension, as soon as
we are compelled to give up this extension we seem to be confronted with
mere nothingness;
we come to a stop as if there is naught beyond.
We do
not give heed to the fact that the material or visible world is an assemblage
of phenomena and nothing more -
that there must necessarily be an in-
visible world, which is the foundation, the subject, of the visible world, and
into which we ought to resolve all that is real and substantial in Nature.
This invisible world is the collection of all the forces which tend to ameliorate
themselves, and which do so in fact, by incessantly extending and perfecting
their activity, in the proportion suitable to each of them.
There is a grada-
tion of forces in the invisible world. as there is a progression of forms in the
extended or visible world. 83
Bonnet, in his Palinglnisiephilosophique,ouIdeessurl'etatpasse
et surI'etatfutur desctresvivans(1770) presented one of the most
extraordinary
speculative
compounds
to be found in the his-
tory of either science or philosophy -
an interweaving,
even
more elaborate
than
Leibniz's, of geology, embryology,
psy-
chology, eschatology, and metaphysics
into a' general view of
the history, past and to come, of our planet
and the living
beings thereon -
a history which may be presumed to have its
counterpart
on other globes.
It was another attempt, differing
in some details, to work out in somewhat concrete terms, and
with the utilization
of the scientific knowledge
or generally
accepted hypotheses of the time, the Leibnitian
conception of a
universe essentially and infinitely self-differentiating
and pro-
gressive. Whether
it can properly be called a form of ' evolu-
tionism'
is a question of terminology.
Bonnet, following Leibniz, is not prepared
to abandon
for-
mally the traditional
'implication of the principle of plenitude
that everything was created at the outset.
"All the component
parts (Pieces)of the universe are contemporary.
The Effica-
cious Will created by a single act all that could be created."
84
But on the other hand, the fact of the universal mutability
of

284
THE GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
nature is too evident to need argument;
and the indications of
a progressive differentiation
and augmentation
of the forms of
life on our globe appear to Bonnet to be conclusive.
But how
can this be reconciled with the doctrine of the completeness of
the original creation?
Obviously the latter cannot be taken
literally.
The sense in which it is to be taken is to be found in
the embryologico-metaphysical
theory of which Bonnet takes
over the fundamentals
from Leibniz.
All the individualsmaking
up the universe
are as old as it is, and are indestructible.
These individuals are primarily"
souls."
Every organism has
a soul; it has also, adds Bonnet, a body, a "germ"
or petit
corpsorganique,equally indestructible,
and permanently
asso-
ciated with that individual
soul.
But at any given time the
body of an individual
organism
is made up of a number
of
these minute organic corpuscles, which have as yet to develop
organized bodies of their own, capable of the functions of as-
similation, growth, and reproduction.
The dissolution of the
organized body may permit the contained corpuscles to set up
in business, so to say, on their own.
Since the" soul" of, for
example, a polyp is "indivisible,
this soul is not broken up into
parts when the polyp is broken up; but by this means oppor-
tunity is given for certain germs" -
i. e., subsidiary and re-
pressed germs previously contained within the creature's
body
-
"to develop; and the soul which I have supposed to be resi-
dent in these germs will then begin to experience
sensations
related to the conservation
of the individual.
There will thus
be formed so many new persons,new egos."
85
During· most
of their existence, therefore, many, or most, of the souls are
merely potentialities
of sensibility, rather than actually senti-
ent; and their germs remain small unchanged
units of animate
matter,
until the appropriate
hour for the beginning of their
active life as individuals arrives.
Nevertheless Bonnet ascribes
to each soul a sort of organic or subconscious memory, of which
the germ is the material vehicle, carrying along a permanent
record of the effects of its past experiences.
Now it is clear from the evidence of geology and astronomy,
says Bonnet, that our globe has passed through a long series of
epochs, each terminated
by a "revolution,"
i. e., a cataclysm
in which all the then existing organic structures were destroyed

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
285
-
but not the germs nor, of course, their associated souls. But
as the external conditions of each epoch differ materially
from
those in the preceding
eras, and the form, organs, and senses
of any species must be adapted
to the physical conditions of the
epoch in which it lives, the kind of gross body which a given
germ takes on when it comes to life again in a new epoch will
differ from its preceding
embodiments.
All these later trans-
formations
had
been provided
for -
whether
literally
pre-
delineated
or not -
in the constitution
of the germ at the
creation:
"I
conceive,"
says Bonnet,
"that
the germs of all
organized
beings
were originally
constructed
or calculated
with a determinate
correlation
with the diverse revolutions
which our globe was to undergo."
86 Thus the first morning of
creation,
after all, in some sense wrote what all later dawns
should disclose -
but wrote only in a kind of prophetic
short-
hand.
Bonnet, on scientific, not to speak of religious, grounds,
is
sure that the sequence of epochs, and accordingly
of organic
types, constitutes
a progress from lower to higher.
The em-
bryological stages of ontogenesis show the forms through which
the animal has successively passed in the previous epochs of the
globe.
(This is one of the early foreshadowings of the recapitu-
lation theory.)
The"
revolutions of the globe," however, can-
not be supposed to have an end.
In the future, therefore,
as
in the past, every germ will reappear
in a succession of ever
higher embodiments.
Our present species will somehow un-
fold into forms" as different from their present ones as the state
of our globe will be different from its present state.
If it were
permitted
us to contemplate
the scene of this ravishing meta-
morphosis, we should probably not be able to recognize any of
the species of animals with which we are now most familiar .
. ..
We should behold a world completely
new, a system of
things of which we have now no idea."
87 This progression of
types, however,
does not seem to be, for Bonnet,
a progress
from generation
to generation.
The"
perfectibility"
of the
oyster does not mean that oysters will be gradually transformed
in the course of heredity,
in the present epoch, until their re-
mote posterity become elephants or men or cherubim;
it means
that the corpsorganiqueof each individual
oyster will, after its

286
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
death, be conserved without alteration
until the right state of
the globe supervenes to call forth its next and higher unfolding.
In the case of the germs which actually developed into full-
fledged individual
animals in this or a preceding
age of the
world, there will also be a conservation
of a sort of personal
identity through memory; of those germs that did not come to
birth"
in the present economy of our world," there will also be
a resurrection,
but without
memory.
"The
same gradation
which we observe today between the different
orders of or-
ganized beings will doubtless be found also in the future state
of our globe [i. e., the series will still be continuous] ; but it will
follow proportions which will be determined
by the degree of
perfectibility
of each species.
Man -
who will then have
been transported
to another dwelling-place,
more suitable to
the superiority
of his faculties -
will leave to the monkey or
the elephant that primacy which he, at present, holds among
the animals
of our planet.
In this universal
restoration
of
animals, there may be found a Leibniz or a Newton among the
monkeys or the elephants, a Perrault
or a Vauban
among the
beavers."
88 Every present species, to be sure, will, as Bonnet
conceived, progress towards "perfection";
but only because
every individual of it will rise again in improved form, through
the future"
revolutions of the globe."
It would seem, there-
fore, that it is only in a rather dubious sense that Bonnet can
be called, as he sometimes has been called, a "forerunner
of
evolutionism."
The
progressive
sequence
of organic
forms
which he asserted was not conceived as resulting by the ordi-
nary processes of generation within our present, or any single,
world-epoch;
it consisted in extreme and discontinuous
muta-
tions occurring, apparently,
only at vast intervals of time, and
after great cataclysms in which, with the exception of the in-
destructible and imperceptible"
germs" of individual animals,
the entire organic life of the globe is destroyed.
As compared
with the evolutionary
hypotheses which had already been put
forward by Maupertuis,
Diderot, and Robinet,
these specula-
tions of Bonnet's were obviously crude and retrogressive.
We have now, in the roughly chronological
order of our re-
view of the history of an idea, already reached the beginning of

TEMPORALIZING
OF THE CHAIN OF BEING
287
that profound
and momentous, but complex and confused,
change in preconceptions and valuations which is commonly,
though somewhat unfortunately,
called Romanticism.
With
the relation to our general theme of two of the most character-
istic and significant tendencies of thought in the Romantic
period the following lectures will deal.

x
ROMANTICISM
AND THE
PRINCIPLE
OF PLENITUDE
IT IS one of the instructive
ironies of the history of ideas that a
principle
introduced
by one generation
in the service of a
tendency
or philosophic
mood congenial
to it often proves to
contain,
unsuspected,
the germ of a contrary
tendency -
to
be, by virtue of its hidden implications,
the destroyer of that
Zeitgeist to which it was meant
to minister.
There
are few
more striking examples of this irony than that which may be
found in the history of the principles
of plenitude
and con-
tinuity.
As we have seen, they were invoked in the seventeenth
and early eighteenth
century
primarily
as a support
for the
doctrine
of the essential logicality
of the world.
They were
designed to justify the belief in the rationality,
the perfection,
the
static
completeness,
the
orderliness
and
coherency
of
reality.
Yet they were at heart ideas profoundly
antipathetic
to the simple rationalism
of the Enlightenment;
the ultimate
effect of their vogue was to introduce subtly and gradually into
the European
mind
several of those tastes and those 'philo-
sophical presuppositions
which at the end of the century took
formin
a conscious and aggressive revolutionary
movement in
thought,
that to which the name of Romanticism
is commonly
applied.
The
conception
of the
complete
and
continuous
Scale of Being came into the circle of accredited
eighteenth-
century ideas with a letter of recommendation
from that ven-
erated
figure, the Principle of Sufficient Reason;
it ended by
helping to make intellectual
outcasts of not a few of that circle,
including
its own sponsor.
For in nearly all the provinces of thought
in the Enlighten-
ment the ruling assumption
was that Reason -
usually con-
ceived as summed
up in the knowledge
of a few simple and
self-evident truths -
is the same in all men and equally pos-
sessed by all; that this common reason should be the guide of
life; and therefore that universal and equal intelligibility,
uni-

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
289
versal acceptability,
and even universal familiarity,
to all nor-
mal members of the human species, regardless of differences of
time, place, race, and individual propensities and endowments,
constitute
the decisive criterion of validity or of worth in all
matters of vital human concernment;
that (the German words
sum it up rather more neatly) Giiltigkeitmeans Allgemeingidtig-
keit and is, indeed, to be tested by actual (or supposed) Gemein-
heit, Let the individual,
when a creed is presented
for his
belief or a work of art for his admiration
and enjoyment, con-
sider whether there beanything
in it which he cannot suppose
to be accessible and obvious to every rational mind through the
"unaided
light of natu~e" or through those modes of experi-
ence which are everywhere the same.
If such a non-u niver-
salizable element be found in it, let him reject it as a false
religion or as unsound ethics or as bad art, as the case may be.
Thus the deist objected to revealed religion chiefly because, in
two ways, it lacked universality:
(a) it was "historical"
and
therefore its doctrines could not be known to those who lived
before its disclosure or to whom convincing
historical
evi-
dences of it had not come; (b)it was, as embodied in the creeds,
complicated
and "mysterious,"
and therefore not the sort of
thing that all men, savage and civilized, simple and learned,
could instantaneously
understand
and intuitively
perceive to
be true.
"La
religion naturelle,"
to recall one of Voltaire's
definitions
of it, can include
only "les principes
de morale
communs
au genre humain."
1 That
truculent
defender
of
orthodoxy,
Dr. Samuel
Clarke, declared
truly enough
that
"all
the deniers of revelation"
agreed
in the premise
that
"what
is not universally made· known to all men is not need-
ful for any."
As Swift satirically but not altogether
unfairly
put it, the assumption was that unless a proposition"
can be
presently comprehended
by the weakest noddle, it is no part of
religion. "
The same connotation
of universality,
obviousness to every
rational mind as such, and uniformity of content, was oftenest
carried by the protean term" nature"
in its ethical application
-
i. e., in the conception of the" law of nature"
in moral and
political philosophy.
Cicero had already set up a formal equa-
tion of "the
universally accepted"
with the lex naturae; 2 and

290
THE GREAT
CHAIN OF BEING
the Roman jurists had similarly identified jus naturalewith jus
gentium -
with those principles
of right quae apud omnesgentes
peraeque servantur, divina quadam providentia constituta, semper
firma atque immutabiliapermanent.' And this was the one thing
upon which most schools of eighteenth-century
moralists were
agreed and upon which they were never weary of discoursing.
"The
tables of natural
law," said Bolingbroke,
"are so obvious
that no man who is able to read the plainest character
can mis-
take them, and therefore no political society ever framed a sys-
tem of law in direct
and
avowed
contradiction
of them."
"The
law of nature
is too obvious and too important
not to
have been always the law of laws."
4 It was to this same uni-
versal and
unvarying
code -
exceedingly
simple in its pro-
visions -
that Voltaire
reduced
the whole duty of man:
La morale uniforme en tout temps, en tout lieu.
C'est la loi de Platon, de Socrate, et la votre.
De ce culte eternel Ia Nature est 1apotre.
Cette loi souveraine en Europe, au Japon,
Inspira Zoroastre, illumina Solon.
But the same assumption
was manifestly
the root from which
grew most of the principles of neo-classical criticism.
Here, too,
high ancient authority
could be (and was) cited: Longinus had
written:
You may pronounce
that sublime, beautiful, and genuine which always
pleases and takes equally with all sorts of men.
For when persons of different
humours, ages, professions, and inclinations, agree in the same joint appro-
bation of any performance,-this
combination of so many different judgments,
stamps a high and indisputable
value on that performance,
which meets
with such general applause. 6
The principal
eighteenth-century
examples of this limitation
of aesthetic
value
to that
which
makes a universal
appeal
scarcely
need
to be recalled:
e. g., the familiar
passage
in
Pope's Essay on Criticism in which
the word "nature"
is vir-
tually synonymous
with the obvious -
i. e., with"
what oft
was thought":
Something whose truth convinced at sight we find,
That gives us back the image of our mind."
Dr. Johnson's
expressions of this universalism
and uniformi-
tarianism
in aesthetic
theory
are equally
familiar;
but it is

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
29 I
worth while to observe how he brings out the logical connec-
tion between the demand for universality of appeal in a work
of art and the neo-classical requirement
that art shall restrict
its "imitation
of nature"
to generic types and avoid the por-
trayal of the individual -
with the consequent deliberate
ex-
clusion of local color and the deliberate
preference in poetry
for the conventional
and generalized
epithet.
The
precise
reason, it will be remembered,
why it was held to be "a gen-
eral rule of poetry that all appropriated
terms of art should be
sunk in general expressions"
was that "poetry
is to speak a
universal
language."
7
It will also be recalled
how prepos-
terously Dr. Johnson, under the influence of this principle, mis-
praised Shakespeare,
on the ground that his Romans are not
particularly
Roman
nor his kings especially kinglike -
that,
in short, "his characters
are not modified by the peculiarities
of studies or professions which can operate
upon but small
numbers,"
but exhibit only the traits of "common
humanity,
such as the world will always supply, and observation will al-
ways find."
Dr. Johnson detested the deists; but in his famous
dictum in Rasselasabout the streaks of the tulip he demanded
in the poetic description
of a flower or a landscape
precisely
what the deist demanded in a religion -
and did so, in the last
analysis, under the influence of the same preconception.!
Aes-
thetic orthodoxy
and religious heterodoxy
in that age grew
from a common root.
The classic exposition of all this in Eng-
lish, however, is to be found in Reynolds's Discourses;of these
there is neither time nor need to speak here.
I content myself
with recalling a single example of the effect of Reynolds's in-
fluence.
When Thomas Warton in 1782recanted his youthful
deviation
into a taste for Gothic architecture,
he exclaimed,
apostrophizing
Reynolds:
Thy powerful hand has broke the Gothic chain,
And brought my bosom back to truth again.
To truth, by no peculiar taste confined,
Whose universal pattern strikes mankind.
This aesthetic conversion was, according to the poet, brought
about merely by gazing upon Sir Joshua's
painted window in
the chapel of New College, Oxford; but we may be tolerably
sure that that example of supposedly"
classic" qualities in art

29 2
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
would have had no such effect unassisted by the reasonings of
the Discourses.
As for the doctrine of the superiority of the ancients and of
that art which followed the example of the ancients, it was ob-
viously a corollary of the same universalism.
For the ancients
alone had, so to say, had time for the test of (supposed) univer-
sal acceptance to be applied to them.
As a minor but typical
writer put it:
It is not because Aristotle and Horace have given us the rules of criticism
that we submit to their authority, but because those rules have been derived
from works that have been distinguished by the uninterrupted
admiration
of all the more improved part of mankind from their earliest appearance to
the present hour.
For whatsoever, through long ages, has been universally
esteemed beautiful, cannot but be conformable
to our just and natural
ideas of beauty.?
The scales were thus heavily weighted
against any modern
innovator, since in the nature of the case he could not claim to
have been"
universally esteemed through long ages."
More-
over, no quality,
no effect, essentially foreign to ancient
art
could be permitted,
since it eo ipso must lack universality.
Aesthetic or other universalism,
so far as it was consistently
carried out, had thus an obvious affinity for a kind of prim i-
tivism -
inasmuch
as anything
which
was not within
the
reach of the earliest men, or at least of the earliest practitioners
of a given art, plainly was not common to the race.
By a simi-
lar logic the deists were obliged to declare their creed "as old
as the creation."
Thus for two centuries
the efforts made for improvement
and correction in beliefs, in institutions, and in art had been, in
the main, controlled by the assumption that, in each phase of
his activity, man should
conform as nearly as possible to a
standard
conceived as universal,
uncomplicated,
immutable,
uniform for every rational being.
The Enlightenment
was, in
short, an age devoted, at least in its dominant
tendency, to the
simplification
and the standardization
of thought
and life -
to their
standardization
by means
of their
simplification.
Spinoza summed it up in a remark reported by one of his early
biographers:
"The purpose of Nature is to make men uniform,
as children of a common mother."
10 The struggle to realize

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
293
this supposed purpose of nature,
the general attack upon the
differentnessof men and their opinions and valuations
and in-
stitutions -
this, with the resistances to it and the eventual
revulsion against it, was the central
and dominating
fact in
the intellectual history of Europe from the late sixteenth to the
late eighteenth
century."
There
have,
in the entire
history
of thought,
been few
changes in standards
of value more profound
and more mo-
mentous than that which took place when the contrary
prin-
ciple began widely to prevail -
when it came to be believed
not only that in many, or in all, phases of human life there are
diverse excellences, but that diversity itself is of the essence of
excellence;
and
that
of art,
in particular,
the objective
is
neither the attainment
of some single ideal perfection of form
in a small number
of fixed genresnor the gratification
of that
least common denominator
of aesthetic susceptibility which is
shared by all mankind
in all ages, but rather
the fullest pos-
sible expression of the abundance
of differentness that there is,
actually or potentially,
in nature and human
nature,
and -
for the function
of the artist in relation
to his public -
the
evocation
of capacities
for understanding,
sympathy,
enjoy-
ment, which are as yet latent in most men, and perhaps never
capable
of universalization.
And these assumptions,
though
assuredly not the only important,
are the one common,factor in
a number of otherwise diverse tendencies which, by one or an-
other critic or historian,
have been termed"
Romantic":
the
immense multiplication
of genres and of verse-forms; the ad-
mission of the aesthetic legitimacy of the genremixte; the gout de
la nuance; the naturalization
in art of the "grotesque";
the
quest for local color; the endeavor to reconstruct
in imagina-
tion the distinctive
inner
life of peoples remote
in time or
space or in cultural
condition;
the etalagedu moi; the demand
for particularized
fidelity in landscape-description;
the revul-
sion against simplicity;
the distrust of universal
formulas in
politics; the aesthetic antipathy
to standardization;
the identi-
fication
of the Absolute
with
the "concrete
universal"
in
metaphysics;
the feeling of "the
glory of the imperfect";
the
cultivation of individual,
national, and racial peculiarities;
the
depreciation
of the obvious and the general
high valuation

294
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
(wholly foreign to most earlier periods) of originality, and the
usually futile and absurd self-conscious pursuit of that attri-
bute.
It is, however, of no great consequence whether or not
we apply to this transformation
of current assumptions about
value the name of " Romanticism";
what it is essential to re-
member is that the transformation
has taken place and that it,
perhaps, more than any other onething has distinguished, both
for better and worse, the prevailing assumptions of the mind
of the nineteenth and of our own century from those of the pre-
ceding period in the intellectual
history of the West.
That
change, in short, has consisted in the substitution of what may
be called diversitarianism
for uniformitarianism
as the ruling
preconception
in most of the normative provinces of thought.
Now the relation of this change to the ideas of which we are
reviewing
the historic
influence
and vicissitudes is what
I
chiefly wish to point out in this lecture.
La natureestpartout la
mime was the premise from which, explicitly or implicitly, the
neo-classic aesthetic
theorists had deduced
the consequence
that
art should be the same among
all peoples and at all
times;
12 but the writers on the Chain of Being -
who were in
many cases the same writers -
had endlessly reiterated
the
contrary of this premise: that"
Nature diversifies its art in as
many
ways as possible."
13
The
rationality
of the World-
Ground,
according to the philosophy of Leibniz, had, as we
have seen, manifested itself in the maximal differentiation
of
the creatures.
Every monad mirrors the world from its own
unique point of view and therefore in its own unique way, and
it is by this means that the fullness of diversity which con-
stitutes the perfection of the universe is attained:
"the glory of
God is multiplied by so many wholly different representations
of his world."
14
As a city viewed from various sides appears wholly different, and receives
as it were a perspective multiplication,
in like manner, through the infinite
multiplicity
of the simple substances [monads], there is a corresponding
multiplicity of different universes, which, nevertheless, are only the perspec-
tives of one and the same universe according to the different points of view
of each monad.
And this is the means whereby the greatest variety possible
is obtained, that is to say, the means whereby is obtained the greatest possi-
ble perfection.P

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
295
Any endeavor
by man
to diminish
this differentness
would
therefore
be contrary
to the cosmic plan.
We have already
seen Addison finding the "goodness
of God"
not less "in the
diversity than in the multitude
of living creatures"
; in the fact
that"
he has specifiedin his creation every degree of life, every
capacity
of being,"
and filled "the
whole chasm of nature,
from a plant to a man, with diverse kinds of creatures,
rising
one above another.
. ..
The
intermediate
space is so well
husbanded
and managed,
that there is scarce a degree of per-
ception which does not appear
in some part of the world of
life."
16 Haller had explicitly drawn the moral for man: "Das
Gluck der Sterblichen
will die Verschiedenheit."
These are
but a few examples
out of a long series of early eighteenth-
century
expressions of this creed;
and back of these was the
whole continuous
tradition
from Plato through
the Neopla-
tonists, the Schoolmen, Bruno, and other writers of the Renais-
sance.
And it is to be remembered
that it was equally a part of
the orthodox
tradition
in religion and morals that man is to
imitate God, to seek, so far as he may, even in this life, to reflect
the divine attributes;
and that it was not less a part of the
classical tradition
in aesthetics that art should imitate nature,
not merely in the sense of copying natural
objects or portray-
ing faithfully the characters of men, but also in the sense of con-
forming
to the general
characteristics
of nature
and to the
ways of working of its Author.
The human
artist must copy
not only the products
but, in so far as he can, the methods
of the Master
Craftsman.
The vocation
of the sculptor, the
musician, the painter,
said Akenside, is "to strive to display to
all the world, by forms, or sounds, or colors," the whole range
of the essences present to the divine mind,
Even as in Nature's frame (if such a word,
If such a word, so bold, may from the lips
Of man proceed) as in this outward frame
Of things, the great Artificer portrays
His own immense idea . . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . But the chief
Are poets; eloquent men, who dwell on earth
To clothe whate'er the soul admires or loves
With language and with numbers.
Hence to these
A field is open'd wide as Nature's sphere;

296
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
Nay, wider: various as the sudden acts
Of human wit, and vast as the demands
Of human will.
The bard nor length, nor depth,
Nor place, nor form controls.l?
And by the late eighteenth
century, we must also recall, the
cosmical order was coming to be conceived not as an infinite
static diversity, but as a process of increasing
diversification.
The Chain of Being having been temporalized,
the God whose
attributes
it disclosed had been declared
by not a few great
writers to be one who manifests himself through
change and
becoming;
nature's
incessant tendency was to the production
of new kinds; and the destiny of the individual
was to mount
through
all the spires of form, in a continual
self-transcend-
ence.
Since the strain in Western thought
summed up in the
doctrine of the Chain of Being thus consisted in an increasing
emphasis upon the conception of God as insatiably creative, it
followed that the man who, as moral agent or as artist, would
imitate
God,must
do so by being himself"
creative."
The,
word, which through
much repetition
has in our own day be-
come a sort of tiresome cant, could still in the late eighteenth
century express a very exciting, and for the arts a very stimu-
lating, idea.
Man's high calling was to add something
of his
own to the creation, to enrich the sum of things, and thus, in his
finite fashion, consciously to collaborate
in the fulfilment of the
Universal Design.
Not only diversity and perpetual
innovation,
but sometimes
also a measure of discord and especially of conflict, had been
found by the most esteemed
philosophers
of the earlyeight-
eenth century to be implicit in the nature
of the good, when
the good was construed
in conformity
with the principle
of
plenitude.
And in this also they were but repeating
what Plo-
tinus and the Schoolmen
and the Renaissance
Platonists and
the theologians
and metaphysicians
of the seventeenth century
had said before them.
The traditional
argument
for optimism
in all ages, as has been made sufficiently evident, represented
the Cosmic Artist as cramming
his canvas with diversified de-
tail to the last infinitesimal
fraction of an inch; as caring far
more for fullness and variety of content than for simplicity and
perfection of form; and as seeking this richness of coloring and

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
297
abundance
of contrast even at the cost of disharmony,
irregu-
larity, and what to us appears confusion.
For there is much
truth,
said Leibniz,
in "the
fine principle
of St. Bernard:
ordinatissimumest, minus interdumordinatefieri aliquid." As Black-
more, in one of the most conventional
of early eighteenth-cen-
tury poems, had said, when speaking not of the human artist
but of the Creator:
If all perfection were in all things shown,
All beauty, all variety, were gone.
If, then, we recognize in the shift from the uniformitarian
to
the diversitarian
preconception
the most significant and dis-
tinctive single feature of the Romantic
revolution, it is evident
that there had always been present in the Platonic tradition
a
principle
tending
towards
Romanticism,
and that
this had
been enunciated
with especial clarity
and insistence by the
philosophers
and moralists
and philosophic
poets of the so-
called Age of Reason.
And in the ideas of these philosophers
and poets the young men, especially in Germany, who were, in
the later decades of the eighteenth century, to be the leaders of
that revolution
had been reared.
By Leibniz and Locke and
Kant, by Buffon and Bonnet, by Addison and Pope and Aken-
side and Haller,
and by a hundred
minor writers, they had
been taught that the best of possible worlds is the most varie-
gated, that it was the divine purpose that no possibility of being
should be left unrealized.
Most of all had these diversitarian
preconceptions
been impressed upon the eighteenth-century
mind by the controversy
over optimism,
in which so great a
part of the intellectual
energy of that age had been engrossed.
These presuppositions
had, it is true, usually been associated
with other conceptions
with which they were fundamentally
inconsistent
and
with
a temper
with which they were not
in accord;
their
full implications
could
become
apparent
only when they were more
sharply
disengaged
from these
other
ideas which
had
tended
to counteract
and
partially
neutralize
them.
But in the
minds
of a new
generation
they came
into
their
own.
It is to be remembered,
also,
that
a revival of the direct
influence
of Neoplatonism
was
one of the conspicuous
phenomena
in German
thought
of

2g8
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
the nineties.
A special student of this period has gone so far
as to declare that
if we are to speak of a 'key' to early Romanticism, it is to be found in one of
the thinkers of antiquity, Plotinus.
For this Neoplatonic philosopher not
only inspired the entire system of Novalis, scattered through innumerable
fragments, and many of the ideas of Schelling in his middle period; his
arm reached farther:
through Novalis and Schelling he exercised an in-
fluence, though an indirect one, upon both the Schlegels, and without a
knowledge of this fact many a passage in the 'Dialogue concerning Poetry'
and in the Berlin lectures [of Wilhelm Schlegel] remains an enigma. IS
There were, indeed, several other powerful forces at work
upon these minds which helped to produce a fresh intellectual
ferment and tended, in some degree, to suggest the same con-
clusions.
But the pressure of the principle of plenitude can be
shown to be a major factor in the great change in presupposi-
tions which becomes most clearly manifest
in the religious
ideas and the moral and aesthetic ideals and enthusiasms
of
the generation
of German
writers who came to maturity
be-
tween the seventies and the nineties, and which were (chiefly)
by them to be communicated
to the rest of the world.
It may,
indeed, be suggested, with some plausibility,
that these ideas
are but the expression of some constant propensities of human
nature,
which became, for some reason, peculiarly
potent at
this time, and that the invocation
of these ancient principles
was but a device for "rationalizing"
desires and aesthetic
susceptibilities previously restrained.
The general psychologi-
cal issue raised by such a suggestion -
the question how far
men's philosophies are generated,
not by the logical, or sup-
posedly logical, working
out of accepted
premises,
but
by
emotional
cravings,
by idiosyncrasies
of personal
tempera-
ment, or by the social and other practical
problems of a par-
ticular historic juncture
-
I shall not attempt
to discuss here.
It remains the fact that, throughout
the Enlightenment,
the
uniformitarian
creed had in practice been effectively dominant
-
while the theoretical
premises of diversitarianism
had, in
the same period,
been constantly
and with increasing
fre-
quency dilated upon, and that their practical implications did
eventually
find acceptance
and application.
It also, I think,
remains the fact that, even though it be assumed -
as I am

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
299
not prepared to assume without a good deal of qualification -
that the reasons which men give for their beliefs, their stand-
ards, and their tastes are but the "rationalization"
of their
desires and their spontaneous likings and dislikes, the possi-
bility of giving reasons, or what appear to be such, is not less
indispensable.
And it was in the principle of plenitude
that
the protagonists of the revolution with which we are here con-
cerned found one of the two most fundamental
and, for their
generation, most effective of their reasons.
In the youthful
philosophy
of Schiller, set forth
in the
PhilosophischeBriefs, these anti-rationalistic
and diversitarian
consequences of that principle are deduced with the utmost
boldness.
From Platonic and Leibnitian
premises emerges a
justification of the temper of the Sturm und Drang,
Every kind of perfection must attain existence in the fullness of the world.
. . . Every offspring of the brain, everything that wit can fashion, has an
unchallengeable
right of citizenship in this larger understanding
of the
creation.
In the infinite chasm of nature no activity could be omitted, no
grade of enjoyment be wanting in the universal happiness. . . .
That great Householder of his world who suffers not even a straw to
fall to the ground uselessly, who leaves no crevice uninhabited
where life
may be enjoyed, who hospitably grants even that little flowering of pleasure
which finds its root in madness, . . . this great Inventor could not permit
even error to remain unutilized in his great design, could not allow this
wide region of thought to lie empty and joyless in the mind of man. . . •
It is a genuine gain for the completeness of the universe, it is a provision of
the supreme wisdom, that erring reason should people even the chaotic land
ofdreams and should cultivate even the barren ground of contradiction.P
From all which the young philosopher-poet
romantically
concludes that neither he, nor the friend to whom he imparts
his musings, need be greatly concerned lest he have sometimes
"mistaken
the ebullitions of his blood, the hopes and desires of
his heart, for sober wisdom."
Perhaps the entire structure of
his conclusions is but the baseless fabric of a dream; no matter;
the world is the richer for the illusion, and the purposes of the
Creator are the more fully realized.
In the work of the Divine Artist, the unique value of each part is respected,
and the sustaining gaze with which he honors every spark of energy in even
the lowliest creature manifests his glory not less than the harmony of the
immeasurable whole. Life and libertyto the greatest possible extent are the

300
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
glory of the divine creation;
nowhere is it more sublime than where it
seems to have departed
most widely from its ideal.
The aesthetic implication
also is evident, and is not left by
Schiller unexpressed.
The human artist must, like the divine,
make fullness in the expression of all possible modes of being
and of experience the purpose of his activity.
For him, indeed,
this can only be a program to be realized gradually, as the con-
tent of art is progressively enriched
and diversified through
generation
after generation.
This higher completeness cannot be grasped by us, with our present limi-
ta tions.
Our vision covers too small a part of the universe;
and the har-
monious fusion of the vast multiplicity
of discords cannot reach our ears.
Every step which we mount in the Scale of Being makes us more capable
of this aesthetic enjoyment;
but such enjoyment has value, certainly, only
in so far as it rouses us to a similar activity.
To wonder idly at a greatness
not our own can never highly profit us.
To the man of noble character
there is lacking neither matter to act upon nor the power to be, in his own
sphere, himself a creator. 20
And the human artist who takes this for his program is bidden
to remember that he will not be following the cosmic model in
his small creative
efforts if he allows too much concern for
"form"
to lead him to sacrifice richness of content:
der Fleiss
in den Formenkann euuieilendie massive Wahrheit des StoJlesverges-
sen lassen. Here, plainly, the fundamental
principles of neo-
classical criticism are undergoing
reversal.
In the same writing the young theologian
formally rejects
the notion of the divine self-sufficiency, the Aristotelian
prin-
ciple that a God "can
have no need of friends."
The pious
Klopstock, not long before, had once more apostrophized
the
deity with the ancient question:
Warum, da allein du .dir genug warst, Erster, schaffst du? ...
Wurdest dadurch du Seliger, dass du Seligkeit gabst? 21
But the Absolute gave no reply.
The mystery Klopstock pro-
nounced
insoluble;
the finite mind
here reaches
its limit.
Schiller
answers
the question
in terms
which
would
have
scandalized
most of the great
speculative
theologians
since
Aristotle:

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
301
Freundlos war der grosse Weltenmeister,
Fiihlte Mangel, darum schuf er Geister,
Sel'ge Spiegel seiner Seligkeit.
Fand das hochste Wesen schon keine Gleiches,
Aus dem Kelch des ganzen Wesenreiches
Schaumt ihm die Unendlichkeit.
The direct relation of the thought here to that of the Timaeus
is evident; these famous lines, too, are a sort of commentary on
that dialogue,
and a highly pertinent
one, though
Schiller
himself may have been unaware
of the connection.
For we
here see the definite separation
of those two conceptions
of
deity which
had
been joined
together
in hopeless discord
throughout
most of the history of European religious thought.
The Platonic Demiurgus
has been recognized
to be incon-
sistent with the Platonic Absolute, the God identified with the
Idea of the Good as perfection or self-sufficiency; and the latter
has been sacrificed in order that the former may be retained.
A God who creates a world of finite spirits must be a God who
is notsufficient unto himself.
In consequence,
chiefly, of the belated wave of classicism
which swept over the younger German generation
in the late
seventeen-eighties
and
early nineties, these exuberances
of
Schiller's youth presently came to seem to him, not, indeed,
false, but one-sided.
His attempt to provide the needed com-
plement to them still took the form of a new synthesis of the
two strains in the Platonistic tradition -
the synthesis being
facilitated
for him by some conceptions which he had lately
learned from Kant and Fichte.
The result is set forth in his
LettersontheAestheticEducationof Mankind (1795), which have a
wider bearing than their title suggests. The constructive part
of them begins with an analogy between the two fundamental
attributes
of the Platonic, or Neoplatonic,
Absolute, and two
corresponding elements in the constitution of man.
On the one
hand, "a divine being cannot be subject to becoming,"
since
it is, by its essence, "infinite,"
i. e., it is eternally
complete,
and can gain no increment
through any process in time.
But
on the other hand,
a tendency ought to be named divine which has for its infinite program the
most distinctive attribute
of the divinity -
the absolute manifestation of

302
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
potency,
the actuality
of all that is possible -
and the absolute unity of
the manifestation
-
the necessity of all that is actual.P
Schiller
thus
brings
back again
the
two
Gods of Plato-
the immutable
and self-contained
Perfection and the Creative
Urge which makes for the unlimited
realization
in time of all
the possibles.
In these two characteristics
of the divine nature
man shares;
and there are therefore
two forever conflicting
tendencies
in him, the "two
fundamental
laws"
of a being
which
is at
once
rational
and
sensuous -
which
has,
in
Kantian
terms, both a noumenal
and a temporal
Ego.
The
one is the demand for pure unity, for" form " in the abstract
-
the Formtrieb,as Schiller calls it; and since it is alien to time,
it is adverse to change.
"It
can never exact at one time any-
thing but what it exacts and requires forever."
The other, the
Sto.fftrieb,is the demand
for diversity, for fullness of concrete,
particularized
content;
and it necessarily manifests itself in the
life of an incomplete
and temporal
being as a perpetual
im-
pulsion towards change, towards the enrichment
of experience
through
innovation.
The object of this "sensuous
impulse"
(as Schiller
also, less adequately,
names
it), of that
which
makes man a part of the natural world of becoming, is " life, in
the widest sense of the term, in which it embraces all material
existence and all that is immediately
present to the senses."
23
Since the worldis spread out in time, since it is change, the complete reali-
zation of that potentiality
which relates man to the world must consist in
the greatest possible variability and extension.
Since the personis that which
is permanent
through change, the complete realization
of that potentiality
which is antithetic
to change
must consist in the greatest
possible self-
sufficiency and intension.P
Though these two elements in man are forever at war, they are
equally indispensable
to the attainment
of excellence, in char-
acter and in art.
Beauty, the objective of art, requires always
definiteness of form (Bestimmtheit);but those aestheticians
and
critics who dwell upon this truth are prone to forget that that
objective is to be attained,
not"
through
the exclusion of cer-
tain realities,"
but through
"the
absolute inclusion of all."
25
Thus the temporalized
principle
of plenitude
and the op-
posite idea of the restriction
of content
by the imposition
of
immutable
rules of formal perfection are made by Schiller the

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
303
joint dictators of the program of life and of art.
Since they are
essentially antithetic, in any actual juncture
in experience one
of them must in .some degree be sacrificed to the other.
Be-
tween them Schiller himself constantly wavers; sometimes the
primacy seems to be given to the one, sometimes to its opposite.
Yet he conceived that he had discovered in a third tendency of
man, the Spieltriebor play-impulse,
the harmonious
union of
both.
Into this confused effort of Schiller to reconcile the ulti-
mately irreconcilable
we need not enter.
In the end he him-
self admits that no definitive reconciliation
can be achieved.
The "equilibrium
of form and of content remains always an
idea"
that reality can never completely reach.
"In
reality
there will always remain
a preponderance
of one of these
elements over the other;
and the highest point to which ex-
perience can attain consists in an oscillation between two prin-
ciples," in which now the one and now the other will be pre-
ponderant."
Thus there must be, in the life of the individual,
the development of the race, and the history of art, an unend-
ing alternation of contrary phases. Now the insatiable quest of
more "life,"
of greater variety and fullness of content,
will
break down the forms which have been imposed upon art or
upon other modes of man's self-expression; and now the de-
mand for "form,"
for fixed "principles"
and
stable order,
will arrest the expansive process of life. Thus humanity in all
of its activities will -
and should -
forever swing between
opposite exaggerations.
But on the whole -
it is implied,
though
not
acknowledged,
by Schiller -
the
principle
of
plenitude has the last word.
Since he holds that every unifica-
tion must be incomplete, every aesthetic form or moral code
prove in the end too narrow to contain
the potentialities
of
humanity,
it follows that the tendency to increasing diversifi-
cation through perennial
change will be, and should be, the
dominant force in man's existence.
In the writings (after 1796) of the German poets, critics, and
moralists who adapted
the word "romantic"
to their own
uses and introduced
it into the vocabulary
of literary history
and of philosophy, the diversitarian
assumption is pervasively
present; and here too it is closely connected with the concep-
tion that the artist's task is to imitate,
not simply Nature's

304
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
works, but her way of working, to enter into the spirit of the
universe by aiming, as it does, at fullness and variety without
end.
"All the sacred play of art," said Friedrich
Schlegel, "is
only a distant copying of the infinite play of the world, that
work of art which is eternally
fashioning itself."
27 A special
student of the German
Romantiker has recently observed that
"just as God's purpose in 'the things that are made' is nothing
less than to reveal 'the
invisible things of him, ...
even his
eternal power and Godhead,'
thus Schlegel thought it was the
purpose of the romantic
poet likewise to show in his equally
objective creation his own artistic power, glory, wisdom, and
love for the product of his literary genius" ; and the same writer
has pointed out how crucial in the history of the development
of the younger
Schlegel's
aesthetic
ideas was the suggestion
which"
came to him from the field of religion,"
that"
as God
is to his creation,
so is the artist to his own."
28 But the most
significant element for the young Romanticist
in this ancient
parallel was that the God whose artistic practice was to be both
imitated
and complemented
by the human
artist was a God
who valued diversity above all else.
But there was a radical
and perilous ambiguity
in this as-
sumption when it was applied as a rule of art or of conduct.
It
could be construed in two ways; and they tended in practiceto
be antithetic
ways, though they were not wholly so in essence.
On the one hand, it suggested, as both an aesthetic and a moral
aim for the individual,
the effort to enter as fully as possible
into the immensely
various range of thought
and feeling in
other men.
It thus made for the cultivation,
not merely of
tolerance,
but of imaginative
insight into the points of view,
the valuations, the tastes, the subjective experiences, of others;
and this not only as a means to the enrichment
of one's own
inner life, but also as a recognition
of the objective validity of
diversities of valuation.
The Romantic
imperative,
so con-
strued, was: 'Respect
and
delight in -
not merely, as with
Kant, the universal reason in which all men uniformly partici-
pate -
but the qualities by which men, and all creatures, are
unlike one another
and,
in particular,
are unlike yourself.'
"I
almost
believe"
-
wrote
Friedrich
Schlegel -
"that
a
wise self-limitation
and moderation
of the mind is not more

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
305
necessary to man than
the inward, ever restless, almost vo-
racious, participation
in all life, and a certain feeling of the
sanctity (Heiligkeit) of an abounding fullness."
29 And his own
usual tendency, and that of the school whose ideas he so largely
formulated,
was to regard it as more necessary.
The earlier
Romantic
writers accordingly
became
zealous preachers
of
catholicity in aesthetic appreciation.
It is thus that Wackenroder
praises Allgemeinheit,
Tolerane;
und Menschenliebe in der Kunst:
The Eternal Spirit knows that each man speaks the language which He
has provided for him, that everyone expresses what is within him as he can
and should ....
[God] looks with satisfaction upon each and all, and re-
joices in the variety of the mixture.
. . .
To him the Gothic church is as
well-pleasing as the Grecian temple;
and the rude war-music of the savage
is a sound as dear to him as religious anthems and choruses composed with
richest art.
Yet when I turn my gaze back from Him, the Infinite, to earth,
and look about upon my brothers -
ah! how loudly must I lament that
they so little strive to become like their great model in Heaven.
[Men]
always think of the point at which they stand as the centre of gravity of the
universe;
and similarly they regard their own feeling as the centre of all
that is beautiful in art, pronouncing,
as from the judge's seat, the final ver-
dict upon all things, without remembering
that no one has appointed them
to be judges.
. . .
Why do you not condemn the Indian because he speaks
his own language and not ours?
And yet you would condemn the Middle
Ages because they did not build the same kind of temples as Greece ....
If you are unable to enter directly into the feelings of so many beings dif-
ferent from yourself and, by penetrating
to their hearts, feel their works,
strive at least, by using the intellect as a connecting bond, to attain to such
an understanding
of them indirectly. 30
A. W. Schlegel, more than a decade later, was inculcating the
same exacting and salutary aesthetic self-discipline.
One cannot become a connoisseur without universality of mind, that is,
without the flexibility which enables us, through the renunciation
of per-
sonal likings and blind preference for what we are accustomed to, to trans-
pose ourselves into that which is peculiar to other peoples and times, and,
so to say, to feel this from its centre outwards.
Thus the despotism of good
taste, by which [some critics] seek to enforce certain perhaps wholly arbi-
trary rules which they have set up, is always an unwarranted
presumption.
And, recalling the disparagement
both of Gothic architecture
and of Shakespeare
in the preceding
period, Schlegel based
upon this principle a condemnation
of the narrowness of neo-
classicism:

THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
The Pantheon
is not more different from Westminster Abbey than the
structure of a tragedy of Sophocles from that of a play of Shakespeare ....
But does admiration for one of these really require of us depreciation of the
other?
Can we not grant that each is in its own way great and admirable,
even though the one is utterly unlike the other? . . .
The world is wide,
and many things can coexist in it side by side."
For the artist, as distinct from the appreciator
of art, this ideal
led to the program
expressed in Friedrich
Schlegel's famous
definition
of Romantic
poetry:
"die
romantische
Poesie ist
eine progressive Universalpoesie."
It must be universal, not in
the restrictive sense of seeking uniformity
of norms and uni-
versality of appeal, but in the expansive sense of aiming at the
apprehension
and expression of every mode of human experi-
ence.
Nothing should be too strange or too remote, nothing
too lofty or too low, to be included in its scope; no nuanceof
character
or emotion
can be so delicate
and elusive, or so
peculiar, that the poet or novelist ought not to attempt to seize
it and to convey its unique
quale to his readers.
"From
the
romantic
point
of view,"
wrote
Schlegel,
"the
abnormal
species (Abarten) of literature
also have their value -
even the
eccentric
and
monstrous -
as materials
and
preparatory
exercises for universality -
provided
only that there is some-
thing in them, that they are really original."
32
It was this strain in Romanticism
which was the more har-
monious with that note in it of which we observed some illus-
trations in a previous lecture -
the demand
for a perpetual
transcendence
of the already-attained,
for unceasing
expan-
sion.
Romantic
art must be progressive as well as universal
because the universality
of comprehension
at which it aimed
was assumed to be never fully attainable
by any individual or
any generation.
The Fiille des Lebenswas inexhaustible;
how-
ever much of it might have been at any given time expressed
through
the medium of one or another
art, there was always
more beyond.
The early Romanticists did not suffer from that
fear which obsessed the young John
Stuart
Mill, during his
phase of somewhat
belated adolescent melancholy -
itself a
fear which derived its poignancy from the same Romantic pre-
conception -
the fear lest all the possible modes and combina-
tions in, for example, music had already been realized, that

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
307
there could be nothing really new in this art to look forward to.
(This was, it need hardly be recalled incidentally,
a rather
comic cause for alarm in the third decade of the nineteenth
century.)
Nature and man, for the Romanticist,
were various
enough to afford the artist ever new material; and his task was
indefatigably to appropriate
and to embody it in equally vari-
ous and changing aesthetic forms. And the moral consequence
was the same; the good man, for the Romantic as for Goethe's
God, was the man der immerstrebendsich bemiiht.
But the idealization of diversity, the program of consciously
emulating and even adding to the plenitude of nature, could,
as I have said, be quite otherwise interpreted.
And this alter-
native interpretation
is apparent in the same group of writers,
and even in the same individuals.
If the world is the better
the more variety it contains, the more adequately it manifests
the possibilities of differentness in human nature, the duty of
the individual, it would seem, was to cherish and intensify his
own differentness from other men.
Diversitarianism
thus led
also to a conscious pursuit of idiosyncrasy, personal, racial, na-
tional, and, so to say, chronological.
"It is precisely individ-
uality,"
wrote Friedrich Schlegel in the Athenaeum,33"that
is
the original and eternal thing in men. . ..
The cultivation
and development
of this individuality,
as one's highest voca-
tion, would be a divine egoism."
"The more personal, local,
peculiar
(eigentilmlicher), of its own time (temporeller), a poem
is, the nearer
it stands to the centre of poetry,"
declared
Novalis."
This, obviously, was the polar opposite of the funda-
mental principle
of the neo-classic aesthetic doctrine.
This
interpretation
of the Romantic
ideal suggested that the first
and great commandment
is: 'Be yourself, which is to say, be
unique !'
Both of these highly dissimilar morals drawn from the prin-
ciple of plenitude
are especially well illustrated
by Schleier-
macher,
in two of the chief manifestos of early
German
Romanticism,
his Reden(1799) and M onologen(1800).
The
Redenmay be called the first serious and deliberate attempt to
formulate
a distinctively
"Romantic"
ethics, to carryover
into moral philosophy
the same principle
which had been
given aesthetic application
in the writings of the Schlegels,

308
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
especially in their contributions
to the Athenaeum. Schleier-
macher
was obviously merely repeating
the deduction
from
the principles of plenitude and continuity-
as these had been
expressed in the argument
for optimism -
which we have
already, in a previous lecture, seen drawn by Leibniz:
What would the uniform repetition of even the highest ideal be? Man-
kind -
time
and
external
circumstances
excepted -
would
be every-
where identical.
They would be the same formula with a different co-
efficient. What would this be in comparison with the endless variety which
humanity
doesmanifest? Take any element of humanity
and you will find
it in almost every possible condition.
You will not find it quite isolated, ...
nor quite combined with all other elements, ...
but you will find all possible
mixtures between, in every odd and unusual
combination.
And if you
could think of combinations
you do not see, this gap would be a negative
revelation of the universe, an indication
that in the present temperature
of the world this mixture is not possible."
Schleiermacher
does not find this assumption overthrown by
"the
often bewailed
superfluity
of the commonest
forms of
humanity,
ever returning
unchanged
in a thousand
copies."
The explanation
is found in the principle of continuity:
"the
Eternal Mind commands that the forms in which individuality
is most difficult to discern should stand closest together."
Yet
it is still true that"
each has something of its own and no two
are identical."
From
this, then,
both
in
the Reden and
the
M onologen,
Schleiermacher
draws the ethical corollary that"
uniformity"
in thought and character
is the evil which it is man's first duty
to avoid.
Why, in the province of morals, does this pitiable uniformity
prevail,
which seeks to bring the highest human life within the compass of a single
lifeless formula?
How can this ever have come into vogue, except in conse-
quence of a radical lack of feeling for the fundamental
characteristic
of
living Nature, which everywhere aims at diversity and individuality
(Man-
nigjaltigkeit und Eigentumlichkeit)?36
But here again the moral takes on two shapes: the first, that
the aim of the individual
should
be an all-comprehending
understanding
and sympathy,
an increasing
absorption
into
oneself, through the imagination,
of the full range of diversity
in nature,
and especially of the modes of experience and the

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
309
types of character and of culture to be found among mankind
in all periods of history and in all branches of the race.
How can I help but rejoice in novelty and variety, which but confirms
in new and ever different ways the truth of which I am possessed? . ..
Am
I so complete as not to welcome joy and sorrow alike, indeed whatever the
world calls weal or woe, seeing that everything in its own way serves this
purpose and further reveals to me the relationships of my own nature?
If
but this be accomplished, of what importance
is it that I be happy? . . •
My powers have long been striving to draw nearer to the All; when shall
I embrace it in action and in contemplation,
and achieve an inner union
with the All which is within me? There are sciences without the knowledge
of which my outlook on the world will never be complete.
There are still
many forms of humanity,
ages and peoples, which I know no better than
the average man does -
ages and peoples into whose nature and manner of
thought my imagination
has not in its own way entered, which occupy no
.definite place of their own in my picture of the development
of the race.
Many activities which have no place in my own nature I do not compre-
hend, and I often lack an understanding
of my own of their relations to that
All which shows its greatness and beauty in humanity as a whole.
Of that
whole I shall, part by part and part with part, gain possession; the fairest of
prospects spreads before me.
How many noble natures, wholly different
from mine, which humanity
has fashioned as elements of itself, do I see
close at hand!
how many men rich in knowledge who generously or proudly
hold out to me in noble vessels the golden fruits of their lives, and how many
growths of distant times and regions have been transplanted to the fatherland
through their faithful efforts!
Can fate so enchain me that I shall not be
able to draw nearer to this goal of mine?
Can it refuse the means of self-
development, withhold from me easy entrance
into a fellowship with
the
activity of mankind as it is at present, and with the monuments of the past -
cast me out of the fair world in which I live into those barren wastes where it
is vain to seek acquaintance
with the rest of mankind, where what is merely
common in Nature surrounds me on all sides with everlasting uniformity,
and nothing fine, nothing distinctive, stands out in the thick and sodden
atmospherei"?
. . .
For me imagination
supplies what reality withholds;
through it I can put myself in any situation in which I observe another to
be placed;
his experience moves in my mind, changes it to accord with its
own nature,
and represents in my thought how he would act.
Upon the
common judgment
of mankind about other men's existence and activity -
a judgment
framed out of the dead letter of empty formulas -
no reliance
can, indeed, be placed.
. . .
But if -
as must be the case where life is
really present -
an inner activity accompanies the play of the imagination,
and the judgment
is an explicit consciousness of this inner activity -
then
that which is apprehended
as external to the mind of the beholder gives
form to his mind, as if it were really his own, as if he had himself performed
the outward action which he contemplates.
Thus, in the future as in the
past, by the power of this inner activity I shall take possession of the whole

3 10
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
world, and shall make better use of it all in quiet contemplation
than if I
had to accompany each quickly changing image with some outward action. 38
Such a grim determination,
as Emerson said of Margaret
Ful-
ler, to eat this huge universe!
But the other interpretation
of the diversitarian
ideal is not
less -
on the whole, it is rather
more -
ardently
insisted
upon by Schleiermacher;
he presents it in the Monologenas the
chief outcome of the course of reflection through which he had
arrived at a new ethics.
So there came to me what is now my highest insight.
It became clear
to me that every man should exemplify humanity in his own way, in a unique
mixture of elements, so that humanity may be manifested in all ways and
everything become actual which in the fullness of infinity can proceed from
its womb. . . . Yet only slowly and with difficulty does a man attain full con-
sciousness of his uniqueness.
Often does he lack courage to look upon it,
turning his gaze rather upon that which isthe common possessionofmankind,
to which he so fondly and gratefully holds fast; often he is in doubt whether
he should set himself apart,
as a distinctive
being, from that common
character.
. .•
The most characteristic urge of Nature often goes unnoted,
and even where her outlines show themselves most clearly, man's eye all
too easily passes over their sharp-cut edges, and fixes itself firmly only upon
the universal.P
By "individuals,"
Schleiermacher
elsewhere explains,
he
does not mean solely persons; there are also collective individ-
uals, such as races, nations, families, and sexes; each of these,
also, may and should have its distinctive character.
And in the
Reden-
applying both of the two interpretations
of diversi-
tarianism -
he reverses the fundamental
assumption common
to the Church and to the deists, and declares that variety even
in religious beliefs is desirable and essential:
The different manifestations of religion cannot be mere subdivisions, dif-
fering only in numbers and size, and forming, when united,
a uniform
whole.
In that case every one by a natural progress would come to be like
his neighbor.
. . .
I therefore
find the multiplicity
of religions to be
grounded
in the nature
of religion. . . .
This multiplicity
is necessary
for the complete manifestation
of religion.
It must seek for distinctive
character, not only in the individual but in society.
He admonishes with especial severity those who seek for a
universal creed expressing the uniform reason of man.
" You
must," he says to the deists:

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
31 1
You must abandon the vain and foolish wish that there should be only
one religion; you must lay aside all repugnance to its multiplicity; as can-
didly as possible, you must approach everything that has ever, in the chang-
ing forms of humanity,
been developed in its advancing career from the
ever fruitful bosom of the spiritual life. . . .
You are wrong, therefore, with
your universal religion that is supposed to be natural to all; for no one will
have his own true and right religion if it is the same for all. As long as we
each of us occupy a separate place, there must be in these relations of man
to the universe a nearer and a farther, which will determine such feeling
differently in every life. . . .
Nur in der Totalitiit aller solchermoglichenFor-
menkann diegan.(,tReligiontoirklichgegebenwerden.40
Christianity
is, indeed,
for Schleiermacher,
the highest of
the positive religions; but its superiority lies only in its freedom
from exclusiveness.
It does not claim"
to be universal and to
rule alone over mankind
as the sole religion.
It scorns such
autocracy.
. ..
Not enly would it produce
within
itself va-
riety to infinity, but it would willingly see realized even out-
side of itself all that it is unable to produce from itself....
As
nothing is more irreligious than to demand general uniformity
in mankind,
so nothing
is more unchristian
than
to seek uni-
formity
in religion."
41
Any man,
in short,
Schleiermacher
concludes, may, and it is well that every man should, have a
religion of his own -
one, that is, which has somethingunique
in it which corresponds
to what is unique in his own personal-
ity and to his unduplicated
position in the universe.
If we should attempt,
in the light of subsequent
history, an
appraisal of these two strains in the Romantic
ideal, most of us
would
perhaps
agree that
both contributed
to bring
about
some happy
and
some unhappy
consequences
in the next
dozen
decades.
The first strain was the promulgation
and
the prophecy
of an immense increase in the range -
though
not always in the excellence -
of most of the arts, and of an
unprecedented
widening of men's gusto in the recognition
and
the enjoyment
of what Akenside had called "the
fair variety
of things."
The program
of the early Romantic
school was
to be the deliberate
program
of the drama,
much of the non-
dramatic
poetry, the novel, music, and painting
in the nine-
teenth century;
and it is mere blindness not to see in this a vast
enrichment
of the sources of delight in life. And this was not
merely an aesthetic gain.
It tended -
in so far as it was not

312
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
offset by an opposing tendency -
to nothing less than an en-
largement
of human
nature
itself -
to an increase of men's,
and nations',
understanding
and appreciation
of one another,
not as a multitude
of samples of an identical
model, but as
representatives
of a legitimate
and welcome diversity of cul-
tures and of individual
reactions to the world which we have
in common.
Yet all this had its dangers.
The Sto.fftrieh-
one
comes back to Schiller's dualism -
has tended to overwhelm
the Formtrieh. The revolt against
the standardization
of life
easily becomes a revolt against the whole conception
of stand-
ards.
The
God whose attribute
of reasonableness
was ex-
pressed in the principle of plenitude
was not selective; he gave
reality to all the essences.
But there is in man a reason which
demands selection, preference, and negation,
in conduct and in
art.
To say ,Yes' to everything
and everybody is manifestly to
have no character
at all.
The delicate and difficult art of life
is to find, in each new turn of experience,
the viamediabetween
two extremes:
to be catholic
without being characterless;
to
have and apply standards,
and yet to be on guard against their
desensitizing
and stupefying influence, their tendency to blind
us to the diversities of concrete situations and to previously un-
recognized 'values; to know when to tolerate, when to embrace,
and when to fight.
And in that art, since no fixed and com-
prehensive
rule can be laid down for it, we shall doubtless
never attain perfection.
All this has now, no doubt, become a
truism;
but it is also a paradox,
since it demands
a synthesis
of opposites.
And to Schiller and
some of the Romanticists
its paradoxical
aspect made it seem not less but more evidently
true.
A similar bifurcation
of tendencies may be seen in the other
of the two elements in the Romantic
ideal, as an influence in
the subsequent
century.
It served to promote,
in individuals
and in peoples, a resistance
to those forces, resultant
largely
from the spread of democracy
and from technological
prog-
ress, which tend to obliterate
the differences
that make men,
and groups of men, interesting
and therefore valuable
to one
another.
It was the perpetual
enemy of das Gemeine. But it has
also (being in this precisely opposite
to the other Romantic
tendency)
promoted
a great deal of sickly and sterile introver-

ROMANTICISM
AND PLENITUDE
313
sion in literature
-
a tiresome exhibition of the eccentricities
of the individual
Ego, these eccentricities
being often, as is
now notorious, merely conventions painfully turned inside out,
since a man cannot by taking thought become more original or
'unique'
than Nature has made him.
It has lent itself all too
easily to the service of man's egotism, and especially -
in the
political and social sphere -
of the kind of collective vanity
which is nationalism
or racialism.
The belief in the sanctity of
one's idiosyncrasy -
especially if it be a group idiosyncrasy,
and therefore sustained and intensified by mutual
flattery -
is rapidly converted into a belief in its superiority.
More than
one great people, in the course of the past century and a half,
having first made a god of its own peculiarities,
good or bad or
both, presently began to suspect that there was no other god.
A type of national
culture valued at first because it was one's
own, and because the conservation
of differentness was recog-
nized as a good for humanity
as a whole, came in time to be
conceived of as a thing which one had a mission to impose upon
others, or to diffuse over as large a part of the surface of the
planet as possible.
Thus the wheel came full circle; what may
be called a particularistic
uniformitarianism,
a tendency
to
seek to universalize things originally valued because they were
not universal,
found expression in poetry,
in a sort of phi-
losophy, in the policies of great states and the enthusiasms of
their populations.
The tragic outcome has been seen, and ex-
perienced,
by all of us in our own time.
But -
corruptiooptimipessima. The discovery of the intrinsic
worth of diversity was, in both of its aspects, and with all of the
perils latent in it, one of the great discoveries of the human
mind; and the fact that it, like so many other of his discoveries,
has been turned by man to ruinous uses, is no evidence that it
is in itself without value.
In so far as it was historically due to
the age-long influence, culminating
in the eighteenth
century,
of the principle of plenitude,
we may set it down among the
most important
and potentially
the most benign of the mani-
fold consequences of that influence.
I cannot forbear to add
that there is perhaps
a certain appositeness in this theme, at
least, to the memory of the man whose name this lectureship
bears.
WilliamJames,
whatever the verdict of the future upon

314
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
some of his more technical philosophic theses, was in himself an
embodiment,
in a just and sane balance, of the two elements in
the ideal of which I have been speaking.
In him were united,
as in few men of our time, or perhaps of any time, distinctive-
ness of mind, the gift of seeing familiar facts and old problems
in fresh and highly personal ways, and a rare degree of the sort
of universality
of mind which the Romantics,
in their more
happily
inspired
utterances,
praised.
Temperamentally
in-
capable
of holding his own convictions
lightly or of any easy
eclecticism, he nevertheless took delight in the rich diversity of
the characters,
the mental
processes, and -
within limits -
of the opinions of others.
This was no superficial
toleration
arising, as most toleration
arises, from indifference.
He had -
what
is one of the least common
of qualities -
a constant
sense that other people have, as he put it, "insides
of their
own," often quite different from his; and he had an eager de-
sire and an extraordinary
power to get outside of what was
peculiar
to himself and to understand,
"from
the centre out-
wards,"
what was peculiar
to any of his fellows.
To intoler-
ance, conventionality,
and pedantry
this imaginative
sympathy
did not, indeed, extend.
But any spark, or even seeming spark,
of originality
or uniqueness
in his students,
or in any man or
writing,
however
little regarded
by most of the professional
philosophers,
aroused
his instant
interest,
his sometimes
too
generous admiration,
and a hope that there might be here the
disclosure of one of the many aspects of a happily very various
universe which an adequate
philosophy
could not neglect.

XI
THE OUTCOME
OF THE HISTORY AND ITS MORAL
WE BEGANour history with the formation of those conceptions
of metaphysical
theology which were to remain dominant
-
though not without rivals -
in Western thought for two mil-
lennia: the conceptions which first clearly manifest themselves
in the Republicand the Timaeusof Plato and were developed
and systematized
by the Neoplatonists.
And with a phase of
the history' of metaphysical
theology we may conclude.
The
most noteworthy
consequence
of the persistent
influence of
Platonism was, we have seen, that throughout
the greater part
of its history Western religion, in its more philosophic forms, has
had two Gods (as, in its less philosophic forms, it has had more
than two).
The two were, indeed, identified as one being with
two aspects.
But the ideas corresponding
to the' aspects' were
ideas of two antithetic
kinds of being.
The one was the Abso-
lute of otherworldliness-self-sufficient,
out of time, alien to the
categories of ordinary human
thought
and experience, need-
ing no world of lesser beings to supplement or enhance his own
eternal self-contained
perfection.
The other was, a God who
emphatically
was not self-sufficient nor, in any philosophical
sense, 'absolute':
one whose essential nature required the exist-
ence of other beings, and not of one kind of these only, but of all
kinds which could find a place in the descending scale of the
possibilities of reality -
a God whose prime
attribute
was
generativeness,
whose manifestation
was to be found in the
diversity of creatures and therefore in the temporal order and
the
manifold
spectacle
of nature's
processes.
The
device
which, for centuries, served to mask the incongruity of the two
conceptions was the simple dictum of Plato in the Timaeus,
elaborated
into the fundamental
axiom of emanationism-
that a "good"
being must be free from "envy,"
that that
which is more perfect necessarily engenders, or overflows into,
that which is less perfect, and cannot"
remain within itself."

3I 6
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
The device, though it served its purpose, did not in fact over-
come the contradiction
of the two ideas; but its effectiveness
was increased by its seeming, congruence with an assumption
about
the causal relation which, however gratuitous,
seems
natural to the human mind -
that the' lower' must be deriva-
tive from the' higher,' the cause be, at the least, not less than
its effects. With this theological dualism -
since the idea of
God was taken to be also the definition of the highest good -
there ran, as we have likewise seen, a dualism of values, the one
otherworldly
(though often in a half-hearted
way), the other
this-worldly.
If the good for man was the contemplation or the
imitation of God, this required, on the one hand, a transcend-
ence and suppression of the merely' natural'
interests and de-
sires, a withdrawal
of the soul from 'the world' the better to
prepare it for the beatific vision of the divine perfection; and it
required, on the other hand, a piety towards the God of things
as they are, an adoring delight in the sensible universe in all its
variety, an endeavor on man's part to know and understand
it
ever more fully, and a conscious participation
in the divine
activity of creation.
Of the breaking apart of the two elements of this dualism we
have already observed some examples in the eighteenth cen-
tury.
The logic of the principle of plenitude itself seemed to
entail the conclusion that the imitation
of an otherworldly
God, even assuming such a God, could not be the good for
man, or for any creature, since the reason or the goodness of
God demanded
that each grade of imperfect
being should
exist after its distinctive kind. And meanwhile the idea of God
was itself becoming predominantly
this-worldly,
tending to-
wards a fusion with the conception of' Nature'
infinitely vari-
ous in its manifestations and endlessly active in the production
of differing kinds of beings.
Our present concern is with the
culmination of this latter tendency.
When the Chain of Being
-
in other words, the entire created universe -
came to be
explicitly conceived, no longer as complete once for all. and
everlastingly the same in the kinds of its components, but as
gradually evolving from a less to a greater degree of fullness
and excellence, the question inevitably arose whether a God
eternally complete and immutable
could be supposed to be

OUTCOME
OF THE HISTORY
AND ITS MORAL
3I 7
manifested in such a universe.
The question was not always,
or at first, answered in the negative;
there were numerous
eighteenth-century
attempts, some of which we have noted, to
combine the belief in a Creator who, being always the same
and always acting in accordance with the same necessities of
absolute reason, could not generate a creation different at one
time from what it is at another, with the conviction that the
world, being expansive and progressive, is essentially different
at one time from what it is at another, and that the general
order of events in time is not a negligible feature of finite exist-
ence, irrelevant to those eternal aspects of things with which
metaphysics has to do, but is an aspect of reality of profound
significance for philosophy.
So long as the two beliefs were
held together, the seeming axiom to which I have referred -
that the antecedent in a causal process cannot contain less than
the consequent, or a higher type of being come from a lower-
could still be precariously maintained.
But with the end of that
century and the opening decades of the nineteenth
these as-
sumptions of the traditional
theology and metaphysics began
to be reversed.
God himself was temporalized -
was, indeed,
identified with the process by which the whole creation slowly
and painfully ascends the scale of possibility; or, if the name is
to be reserved for the summit of the scale, God was conceived
as the not yet realized final term of the process.
Thus for
emanationism
and creationism came to be substituted
what
may best be called radical or absolute evolutionism -
the
typically Romantic evolutionism of which Bergson's L'Evolution
criatriceis in great part a re-editing.
The lower precedes the
higher, not merely in the history of organic forms and func-
tions, but universally; there is more in the effect than was con-
tained, except as an abstract unrealized
potentiality,
in the
cause.
This development can best be seen in Schelling.
In much of
his philosophizing between
1800
and
1812,
it is true, he has
still two Gods and therefore two religions -
the religion of
a
time-transcending
and
eternally
complete
Absolute,
an
" Identity of Identities,"
the One of Neoplatonism -
and the
religion of a struggling,
temporally
limited, gradually
self-
realizing World-Spirit
or Life-Force.
The latter is the aspect

3 I 8
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
under which the former manifests itself to us. In its manifesta-
tion the principles of plenitude
and continuity
rule.
The tem-
poral order is, as it were, a projection,
a spread-out
image, of
the Absolute Intelligence,
and its concrete content consists of
the succession of organisms
and their states.
And any such
succession must, says Schelling, constitute a progressive graded
series, for the following reason:
Succession itself is gradual, i. e., it cannot in any single.moment be given
in its entirety.
But the farther succession proceeds, the more fully the uni-
verse is unfolded.
Consequently, the organic world also, in proportion
as
succession advances, will attain to a fuller extension and represent a greater
part of the universe. . . .
And on the other hand the farther we go back
in the world of organisms, the smaller becomes the part of the universe
which the organism embraces within itself. The plant-world
is the most
limited of all, since in it a great number of natural processes are lacking
altogether .1
But the new conception
is set forth still more boldly-and
clearly in the treatise
Ueber das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit
(I 80g). Even here vestiges of the Neoplatonic Absolute, remain;
but Schelling dwells with predilection upon the thesis that God
never is, but is only coming to be, through nature and history.
Has creation a final goal? And if so, why was it not reached at once?
Why was the consummation
not realized from the beginning?
To these
questions there is but one answer: Because God is Life, and not merely
being.
All life has e fate, and is subject to suffering and to becoming.
To
this, then, God has of his own free will subjected himself. . . .
Being is
sensibleonly in becoming.
In being as such, it is true, there is no becoming;
in the latter, rather, it is itself posited as eternity.
But in the actualization
(of being) through opposition there is necessarily a becoming.
Without the
conception
of a .humanly
suffering God -
a conception common to all
the mysteries and spiritual religions of the past -
history remains wholly
unin telligible.2
Yet the principle of plenitude,
with some qualification,
and
with
it the
cosmical
determinism
of Abelard,
Bruno,
and
Spinoza,
is once
more
affirmed
by Schelling.
It
is, says
Schelling -
still
using
the
phrases
of Dionysius
and
the
Schoolmen -
because
"the
act of self-revelation
in God is
related
to his Goodness and Love"
that it is necessary.
But
none the less, or rather, all the more, "the proposition is abso-
lutely undeniable
that from the divine nature
everything
fol-

OUTCOME
OF THE HISTORY
AND ITS MORAL
319
lows with absolute necessity, that everything
which is possible
by means of it must also be actual, and what is not actual must
also be morally impossible.
The error of Spinozism did not at
all consist in the assertion of such an inexorable
necessity in
God, but only in conceiving of this necessity as something life-
less and impersonal."
It recognizes only"
a blind and me-
chanical necessity."
But" if God is essentially Love and Good-
ness, then that which is morally necessary in him follows with a
truly metaphysical
necessity."
Leibniz, on the other hand, was
wholly wrong in attributing
to God a choice between possible
worlds, a sort of "consultation
of God with himself"
at the
conclusion of which he decided upon the actualization
of only
one among a multitude
of possibilities.!
To assume such a free
choice would be to imply"
that God has chosen a less perfect
world than, when all conditions
are taken into account,
was
possible, and -
as some, in fact, assert, since there is no ab-
surdity
which
does not
find some spokesmen -
that
God
could, if he had wished, have created a world better than this
one."
(This, it will be remembered,
had long since been de-
clared by Abelard to be an absurdity.)
There thus is not, and
never was, a plurality
of possible worlds.
True, at the begin-
ning of the world-process
there was a chaotic condition,
con-
stituting the first movement
of the Primal Ground
(Grund), as
"a matter still unformed,
but capable of receiving all forms";
and there was therefore then "an infinity of possibilities"
not
yet realized.
"But this Primal Ground is not to be assimilated
to God; and God, given his perfection,
could will only one
thing."
"There
is only one possible world, because there is
only one God."
4 But this one possible world cannot contain
less than all that was really possible.
The"
God"
even of this passage, it will be seen, still retains
some otherworldly
attributes,
and the necessity of the produc-
tion of all possible creatures is still deduced by arguments which
are closelyakin
to the dialectic of emanationism.
God is not
the Urgrund,nor is he the final consummation
of the process
in which the Urgrund gives rise to increasingly various forms
and eventually to self-consciousness in man; he remains, here,
a perfection
prior to the. world and yet generative
of it as a
necessary logical consequence
of his essential nature.
Yet the

320
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
generation
is a gradual
and successive one; and if Schelling
meant seriously his emphatic thesis that God is "a life" and
therefore "subject
to suffering and becoming,"
he could not
consistently hold to this conception of a transcendent Absolute
who does not genuinely participate
in the world-process in
which his self-revelation consists. The two theologies still sub-
sist side by side; but one of them is a survival, the other is an
innovating idea which is on the point of destroying the former.
Schelling's friend and disciple, the naturalist
Oken, simul-
taneously set forth much the same conceptions, with some ad-
ditions and variations, in his LehrbuckderNaturphilosophie,1810.
"The philosophy of Nature is the science of the eternal trans-
formation of God into the world."
It has the task of showing the phases of the world's evolution from the
primal nothingness: how the heavenly bodies and the elements arose) how
these advanced to higher forms, how finally organisms appeared
and in
man attained to reason. These phases constitute the history of the genera-
tion of the universe. . . .
The philosophy of nature is in the most com-
prehensive sense cosmogony, or, as Moses called it, Genesis."
Oken, it will be observed, here speaks of a God in some sense
antecedent to the world, of an Absolute which metamorphoses
itself into a universe.
There are, in fact, in his metaphysical
terminology also, residual traces of the language of emanation-
ism. But in Oken they are even more recessive than in Schel-
ling.
For this antecedent
Absolute is described in the most
unequivocally negative terms.
Except as self-evolving in time,
says Oken, God = zero, or pure nothingness.
All numbers
may, no doubt, be said to be contained in zero, since they may
all be described as determinations
of zero; and so all beings
may be said to pre-exist in God.
But they so exist, "not in a
real but only in an ideal manner, not actubut only potentia." 8
The realization (Realwerden)of God, then, takes place only
gradually,
through
the history of the cosmos.
Its primary
manifestation and universal condition is time.
"Time is noth-
ing but the Absolute itself."
"The Absolute is not in time, nor
before time, but is time."
Again,"
time is simply the active
thinking of God."
It is "the universal that includes all par-
ticulars, hence all particular
things are in time, and created
Time and creation are one."
7 This temporal Realuierdungof

OUTCOME

the Absolute
reaches its highest point in man, a being ca-
pable of self-consciousness.
"Man
is the creation
in which
God fully becomes an object to himself.
Man is God repre-
sented by God.
God is a man representing
God in self-con-
sciousness. . . . Man
is God wholly
manifested,
der ganz
erschieneneGott." 8
These early manifestations
of an approximation
to radical
evolutionism
in theology were not permitted
to pass unchal-
lenged.
And the challenge
came from the man who, two
decades before, had been regarded with special admiration and
piety by nearly all the young leaders of the German Romantic
movement.
F. H. Jacobi published in 1812 an essay, Von den
giittlichenDingenundihrerOffenbarung,which was chiefly devoted
to a vehement and (as Schelling afterwards described it) tear-
ful attack upon this new way of thinking.
In the issue which
Schelling
had
raised, Jacobi
saw the deepest-reaching
an-
tithesis in the entire philosophy of religion.
"There
can," he
wrote, "be only two principal
classes of philosophers:
those
who regard the more perfect (Vollkommnere)as derived from,
as gradually developed out of, the less perfect, and those who
affirm that the most perfect being was first, and that all things
have their source in him; that the first principle of all things
was a moral being, an intelligence
willing and acting with
wisdom -
a Creator -
God."
Jacobi's reply is rambling and
dogmatic;
but he takes his stand finally upon what he regards
as a self-evident and fundamental
axiom of metaphysics:
that
something cannot"
come from nothing"
nor the superior be
"produced
by" the inferior.
Such a philosophy as Schelling's,
in fact, is, Jacobi
asserts, a direct contradiction
of a law of
formal logic. For, as he observes ~ the observation is a com-
monplace of Platonistic theology -
the relation of God to the
world may, among other things, be conceived as the relation of
a logical prius, a Beuieisgrundor reason, to its consequences, the
implications deducible from it. But" always and necessarily a
Betoeisgrundmust be abovethat which is to be proved by means
of it, and must subsume the latter
under
it; it is from the
Betoeisgrundthat
truth
and certitude
are imparted
to those
things which are demonstrated
by means of it; from it they
borrow their reality."

322
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
To this attack
Schelling replied in a piece of controversial
writing celebrated
for its ferocity and for the damage which it
did, at least in the eyes of his contemporaries,
to the philo-
sophical reputation
of his critic."
What is pertinent
here is the
fact that
the attack
caused Schelling,
not to tone down his
theological evolutionism,
but to give it more radical and more
nearly unqualified
expression than before.
He might conceiv-
ably have met the criticism by pointing out the passages in his
previous writings in which the infinity, timelessness, and self-
sufficiency of the Absolute Identity
had been recognized.
So
far is he from doing this that
he now almost unequivocally
repudiates
such a conception,
and quite expressly denies that
such an Absolute can be the God of religion.
From Jacobi's
formulation
of the issue, and his estimate of its philosophical
significance, Schelling does not dissent; nor does he repudiate
his critic's account
of the essentials of his doctrine.
It is, in-
deed, Schelling observes, needful to make some distinctions,
if
the meaning
of the doctrine
is properly
to be understood.
Those who held it did not, for example,
maintain
that
the
"more
perfect sprang from a less perfect being independentof
and different from itself," but simply that"
the more perfect
has risen from its own less perfect condition."
Nor, accord-
ingly, did they deny that, in a sense, "the
all-perfect being -
that which has the perfections
of all other things in itself-
must be beforeall things."
But they did deny that it thus pre-
existed as perfect actu and not merely potentia. "To
believe
that it did," says Schelling, "is difficult for many reasons, but
first of all for the very simple one that, if it were in actual pos-
session of the highest
perfection
[or completeness],
it would
have had no reason (Grund)for the creation and production
of
so many other
things, through
which it -
being incapable
of
attaining
a higher degree of perfection -
could only fall to a
lower one."
10 Here the central contradiction
inherent
in the
logic of emanation ism -
but for so many
centuries
persist-
ently disregarded
-
was pointed
out with the utmost sharp-
ness.
The promise
and potency,
then, of all that evolution
should unfold might, if one cared to insist on this, be said to
pre-exist from the beginning;
but it was a promise unfulfilled
and a potency unrealized:

OUTCOME
OF THE HISTORY AND ITS MORAL
323
I posit God [says Schelling] as the first and the last, as the Alpha and the
Omega; but as Alpha he is not what he is as Omega, and in so far as he is
only the one -
God 'in an eminent sense' -
he can not be the other God,
in the same sense, or, in strictness, be called God.
For in that case, let it
be expressly said, the unevolved (unentfaltete)God, Deus implicitus,would
already be what, as Omega, the Deusexplicitusis.ll
Upon what grounds, in the face of Jacobi's objections, does
Schelling justify this evolutionary theology?
First of all on the
ground that it accords with the actual character
of the world
of our experience, as that character
is disclosed to our every-
day observation
and
to the more comprehensive
vision of
natural science. On the face of it, the world is, precisely, a sys-
tem in which the higher habitually develops out of the lower,
fuller existence out of emptier.
The child grows into a man,
the ignorant
become learned;
"not
to mention
that nature
itself, as all know who have the requisite acquaintance
with the
subject,
has gradually
risen from the production
of more
meagre
and inchoate
creatures
to the production
of more
perfect and more finely formed ones." 12 A process which is con-
stantly going on before our eyes can hardly be the inconceiv-
ability which Jacobi had made it out to be. The new philoso-
phy had simply interpreted
the general or 'ultimate'
nature of
things, and their order in being, in the light of the known na-
ture and sequences of all particular
things with which we are
acquainted.
The" ordinary theism," defended by Jacobi, had,
on the contrary, given us "a God who is alien to nature and a
nature
that is devoid of God -
ein unnatiirlicherGott und eine
gottloseNatur," 13
Again, Schelling observes, the fact of evil, the imperfection
of the world, is irreconcilable
with the belief that the universe
proceeds from a being perfect and intelligent ab initio. Those
who hold this belief "have
no answer when they are asked
how, from an intelligence so clear and lucid, a whole so singu-
larly confused
(even when brought
into some order)
as the
world can have arisen."
In every way, then, Schelling finds
the picture of reality which accords with the facts is that of a
more or less confused and troubled ascent towards fuller and
higher life; and the only admissible conception of God is that
which is in harmony with. this picture.
Nor has the contrary

324
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
view, he declares, the religiously edifying and consoling char-
acter to which it pretends.
For it "derives the not-good from
the Good, and makes God, not the source and potentiality
of
the good, but the source and potentiality
of the not-good."
Conceived -
as in the theology of absolute
becoming
it is
conceived -
as a good in the making,
als ein ins Cute Ver-
wandelbares, evil or imperfection
itself is not the hopeless and
senseless piece of reality which it must be if conceived as good
in the unmaking, as a lapse from a perfection already realized.
The God of all the older theology, moreover, had been a God
eternally
complete,
"ready-made
once for all," as Schelling
puts it. But no conception could be more barren and unprofit-
able than this; for it is really the conception of " a dead God,"
not of the God that lives and strives in nature and in man.
It is
inconceivable, Jacobi had declared, that life should arise out of
death, being out of non-being, higher existences out of lower.
Is it, then, asked Schelling, easier to conceive that death should
arise out of life? "What
could move the God who is not a God
of the dead but of the living, to produce death.
Infinitely more
conceivable is it that out of death -
which cannot be an abso-
lute death, but only the death which has life concealed within
it -
life should arise, than
that life should pass over into,
should lose itself in, death."
14
Jacobi's error, however -
Schelling observes -
is a natural
consequence of the logical doctrine of the older philosophy from
which he never fully emancipated
himself; it is, indeed, the
crowning example of the pernicious results in metaphysics of
the acceptance
of the Wolffian theory of knowledge,
which
based everything upon the logical Principle of Identity,
and
regarded all certain judgments
as " analytical."
According to
this view, says Schelling -
not with entire historical accuracy
-
"all
demonstration
is merely
a progression
in identical
propositions, there is no advance from one truth to a different
one, but only from the same to the same.
The tree of knowl-
edge never comes to bloom or to fruitage; there is nowhere any
development." But true philosophy and truly objective science
are not a chanting of tautologies.
Their object is always a con-
crete and living thing;
and their progress and evolution is a
progress and evolution of the object itself. "The right method

OUTCOME

AND ITS MORAL
325
of philosophy is an ascending, not a descending, one";
and its
true axiom is precisely opposite to that pseudo-axiom
which
Jacobi had enunciated:
Always and necessarily that
from which development
proceeds
(der
Entwicklungsgrund)is lower than that which is developed;
the former raises
the latter above itself and subjects itself to it, inasmuch as it serves as the
matter, the organ, the condition, for the other's development.
It is -
as has too little been noted by historians -
in this
introduction
of a radical
evolutionism
into metaphysics
and
theology, and in the attempt
to revise even the principles of
logic to make them harmonize with an evolutional conception
of reality, that the historical significance of Schelling chiefly
consists. The question at issue in his controversy with Jacobi is,
indeed, as he clearly recognized
and emphatically
declared,
one of the most fundamental
and momentous
of all philo-
sophical questions, both by its relation to many other theoreti-
cal problems,
and also by its consequences
for the religious
consciousness.
Schelling's thesis meant not only the discarding
of a venerable
and almost universally
accepted
axiom of ra-
tional theology and metaphysics,
but also theemergence
of a
new mood and temper of religious feeling.
For Schelling himself, however, the implication
of this doc-
trine of a God-in-the-making
could not be simply a blandly
cheerful evolutionary
meliorism.
The progress of the world,
the gradual manifestation
or self-realization of God, is a strug-
gle against opposition;
since the full possibilities of being were
not realized all at once, and are not yet realized, there must in
the original nature of things be some impediment,
some prin-
ciple of retardation,
destined
to be triumphed
over, indeed,
but not without
suffering and temporary
defeats.
The Life-
Force advances -
as Robinet had said -
fumblingly, by trial
and error.
·There is a tragic element in cosmic and in human
history; the world-process is ein WechselspielvonHemmen und von
Streben.This conception Schelling had already expressed in his
youthful poem Das epikureischeGlaubensbekenntnisHeinz Wieder-
porstens,well known through the felicitous translation
of part of
it by Royce in The Spirit of Modern Philosophy.t"
Thus, at last, the Platonistic scheme of the universe is turned
upside down.
Not only had the originally complete and immu-

326
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
table
Chain
of Being been converted
into a Becoming,
in
which all genuine possibles are, indeed, destined to realization
grade after grade, yet only through
a vast, slow unfolding in
time; but now God himself is placed in, or identified with, this
Becoming.
The World of Ideas which defines the range of
diversity of possible existence has definitely been transformed
into a realm of mere possibility awaiting actualization,
empty
and without value until it attains it; and even the Idea of Ideas
is no longer exempted from this status.
The world-generating
process starts not at the top but at the bottom, in those ultime
potenee(in Dante's
phrase)
in which the infinite productive
power had been supposed to reach the limit of its capacity.
There is no longer a 'way down,' but there is still a 'way up.'
But the inversion of the Platonistic scheme of things, and espe-
cially of the genetic order assumed in the Timaeus and by Plo-
tinus, while it converts the Scale of Being into an abstract ideal
schema, does not alter its essential character.
The elements of
the ancient complex of ideas whose history we have reviewed
remain potent in Schelling's evolutionistic metaphysics.
The
insatiable
generativeness,
the tendency
to produce
diversity,
the necessity of the realization of the greatest possible' fullness'
of being -
these attributes of the Platonistic world are still the
attributes
of the world of the Romantic
philosopher.
But the
generativeness
is now that of an insufficiency striving uncon-
sciously for richer and more various being; and the fullness is
not the permanent
character but the flying goal of the whole of
things.
This historic outcome
of the long series of 'footnotes
to
Plato' which we have been observing was also, so far as it went,
the logically inevitable
outcome.
Whatever
else be said of
Schelling's reasoning in this phase of his philosophy, he at least
showed the ineluctability
of a choice between the two strains in
Platonism,
by making explicit their essential incompatibility.
He put before the metaphysics
of the succeeding
century
a
forced option -
though many of his successors have failed to
recognize it or have ingeniously sought to evade it.
The two
Gods of Plato and of Plotinus cannot both be believed in; and
the two schemes of values associated with these theological

OUTCOME
OF THE HISTORY
AND ITS MORAL
327
conceptions cannot be reconciled, either in theory or in prac-
tice. The otherworldly
Idea of the Good must be the idea of a
spurious good, if the existence of this world of temporal
and
imperfect creatures be assumed to be itself a genuine good; and
an Absolute which is self-sufficient and forever perfect and
complete cannot be identified with a God related to and mani-
fested in a world of temporal
becoming
and alteration
and
creative advance.
These propositions will seem to some in our
own day evident and perhaps truistic, to others paradoxical
and groundless.
The reasons for their acceptance
have not,
assuredly, been completely set forth in these lectures, though
some of them have repeatedly
suggested themselves in our
analysis of the phases of the history of thought which we have
passed in review.
But with these historical intimations
of the
argument I must here be content; one philosophic moral of the
story which I have been relating is, I think, plainly suggested
by the very course of the tale.
It is not, however, the only moral suggested by our history of
the fortunes of an idea.
There is another which should not be
left wholly unexpressed.
The principles of plenitude and con-
tinuity,
as that history has shown, usually rested at bottom
upon a faith, implicit or explicit, that the universe is a rational
order, in the sense that there is nothing arbitrary,
fortuitous,
haphazard
in its constitution.
The first of these principles (to
restate it once more and finally) presupposed that, not only for
the existence of this world, but for everyone
of its character-
istics, for every kind of beings which it contains -
in strictness,
indeed, for each particular
being -
there must be an ultimate
reason, self-explanatory and' sufficient.'
And the second prin-
ciple followed from the first and was like unto it: there areno
sudden "leaps'.' in nature;
infinitely various as things are, they
form an absolutely smooth sequence, in which no break appears,
to baffle the craving of our reason for continuity everywhere.
Plato's question 'Why?'
could, then, be legitimately asked and
be satisfactorily answered; for though our intelligence is doubt-
less too limited to give a specific answer to it with respect to
every detail of existence, it is capable of recognizing the broad
principles essential to any consistent answer.
By this sort of
faith in the rationality
of the world we live in, a great part -

328
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
probably, in spite of the recurrent and powerful opposing tend-
encies, the greater part -
of Western philosophy and science
was, for a score of centuries, animated and guided, though the
implications of such a faith were seldom fully apprehended
and
came only slowly to general recognition.
The culmination of
it we have observed in the two great rationalistic ontologies of
the seventeenth century and, in a more popular form, in the
usual eighteenth-century
argument for optimism.. A rigorously
rational
world, as these made
clear, must be, in William
James's term, a "block-world"
in the strictest sense, a scheme
of things determined
throughout
and once for all by 'neces-
sary truths';
in final analysis there are no contingent
facts,
there are not and never have been any open options; every-
thing is so rigorously tied up with the existence of the neces-
sarily existent Being, and that Being, in turn, is so rigorously
implicative of the existence of everything else, that the whole
admits of no conceivable additions or omissions or alterations.
In sofar as the world was conceived in this fashion, it seemed
a coherent,
luminous, intellectually
secure and dependable
world, in which the mind of man could go about its business of
seeking an understanding
of things in full confidence;
and
empirical science, since it was acquainted in advance with the
fundamental
principles with which the facts must, in the end,
accord, and was provided with a sort of diagram of the general
pattern of the universe, could know in outline what to expect,
and even anticipate
particular
disclosures of actual observa-
tion.
And with no less sweeping hypothesis could a belief in
the complete rationality of what is have been reconciled.
The
principles of plenitude
and continuity
were legitimate
con-
sequences of that belief.
If, of two kinds of creature which
were logically equally possible, and possible together, one had
been left out, or if the spatial and numerical extent of nature
was fixed at some one finite magnitude or number, then there
clearly was some arbitrary
and fortuitous factor in the ulti-
mate constitution
of being -
even though
this factor were
described as the will of God, since such a will would be one, as
Leibniz said, not completely controlled by reason.
And if it
were admitted to be not completely so controlled, the extent
of such arbitrariness
and
contingency
was unpredictable.

OUTCOME
OF THE HISTORY
AND ITS MORAL
329
Doubtless
some existences are in some sense of more worth
than others, as the principle of gradation
implied; but, below
the level of the one perfect being, a stoppage of the series at one
point rather than another would be an act of caprice.
And the
same is true of the continuumformarum; if nature"
made leaps,"
they must be groundless leaps; if there were gaps, or reallymiss-
ing links, in a sequence of existing forms, such that, for ex-
ample, one kind of animal existed, but was separated from its
most nearly similar actual species by a blank stretch of un-
.realized possibilities of intermediate
kinds, the cosmos must be
admitted to be lacking in orderliness, to be characterized
by a
kind of incoherency
and whimsicality.
But the history of the idea of the Chain of Being -
in so far
as that idea presupposed
such a complete rational
intelligi-
bility of the world -
is the history of a failure; more precisely
and more justly, it is the record of an experiment
in thought
carried on for many centuries by many great and lesser minds,
which can now be seen to have had an instructive
negative
outcome.
The experiment,
taken as a whole, constitutes one
of the most grandiose enterprises of the human intellect.
But
as the consequences of this most persistent and most compre-
hensive of hypotheses
became more and more explicit,
the
more apparent
became its difficulties; and when they are fully
drawn out, they show the hypothesis of the absolute rationality
of the cosmos to be unbelievable.
It conflicts, in the first place,
with one immense fact, besides many particular
facts, in the
natural
order -
the fact that existence as we experience it is
temporal.
A world of time and change -
this, at least, our
history has shown -
is a world which can neither be deduced
from nor reconciled with the postulate that existence is the ex-
pression and consequence of a system of' eternal'
and 'neces-
sary' truths inherent in the very logic of being.
Since such a
system could manifest itself only in a static and constant world,
and since empirical
reality
is not static and constant,
the
'image'
(as Plato called it) does not correspond with the sup-
posed 'model'
and cannot
be explained
by it.
Any change
whereby
nature
at one time contains other things or more
things than it contains at another time is fatal to the principle
of sufficient reason, in the sense which we have seen it to have

330
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
had for those philosophers who understood it best and believed
in it most devoutly.
A temporal succession, moreover, has a
beginning or it has no beginning.
If the process be supposed to
have had a beginning, the date of its beginning and its temporal
span aparteanteare arbitrary facts; there could be no conceiv-
able rational ground for the world's having popped into exist-
ence -
in however
rudimentary
a form -
at
one instant
rather than at an earlier one, or for its having one durational
magnitude
rather than another.
In its theological form, this
was the difficulty wrestled with by Augustine, and many an-
other metaphysician and divine: if it is God's nature or essence
to be generative,
to create a world, such an eternal essence
could not beginto be, by commencing
to create on a certain
day in time -
whether the date were 4004 B.C. or vastly more
remote.
Even if that essence could be supposed to express itself
in a temporal succession at all, only an infinite succession could
be its temporal
counterpart.
The struggles of the more ra-
tionalistic philosophers and theologians who were committed,
for dogmatic or other reasons, to the doctrine of a beginning of
the creation, to deal with this problem provide extraordinary
examples of the ingenuity of the human mind; but they were
struggles to reconcile two patently irreconcilable
propositions.
Perhaps the world maysuddenly have burst into being one fine
day; but if so, it is a world which just as logically might not
have been, and it is in that sense a colossal accident, with no
necessity of reason behind it.
If the alternative,
Aristotelian
doctrine of the' eternity of the world,' i. e., of the infinity of
the past temporal process, was adopted, difficulties of another
sort arose: the paradox
of a completed
and told-off infinite
sequence of events, and either the supposition -
plainly con-
trary to experience -
of an infinity of moments in which noth-
ing ever changes, or else of an infinite number
of changes
through
which no commensurate
realization
of values seems
to have been attained.
The latter difficulty was precisely and
wittily expressed in a parable
by Royce many years since:
"If
you found a man shoveling sand on the sea-shore, and
wheeling it away to make an embankment,
and if you began
to admire his industry, seeing how considerable a mass of sand
he had wheeled away, ...
you might still check yourself to

OUTCOME
OF THE HISTORY AND ITS MORAL
33 I
ask him: 'how long, 0 friend, hast thou been at work?'
And if
he answered that he had been wheeling away there from all
eternity,
and was in fact an essential feature of the universe,
you would not only inwardly marvel at his mendacity, but you
would be moved to say: 'So be it, 0 friend, but thou must
then have been from all eternity an infinitely lazy fellow.'"
16
Those whom we have seen expressly temporalizing
the con-
ception of the Chain of Being and converting it into a program
of cosmic progress through the gradual increase of the fullness
and diversity of being, thus have naturally
-
being doubtless
more or less mindful of this difficulty -
assumed, as a rule,
an absolute beginning of the world's history.
By doing so they
could conceive of that history as having another sort of reason-
ableness, since reality could then be supposed to be struggling,
and to have already in an appreciable
degree moved, towardsa
rational goal, to make for an enrichment of the total excellence
or value of existence.
But they at the same time tacitly denied
its essential logicality in the sense in which it had so long been
supposed to possess that attribute.
Its getting started only a
certain number of centuries or of millions of millennia ago, and
the direction which its march was assumed to have taken, were
by implication chance-happenings,
even though the chance be
considered a fortunate one.
Yet this is only half of the second moral which our history
suggests. The other half is that rationality,
when conceived as
complete, as excluding all arbitrariness,
becomes itself a kind
of irrationality .. For, since it means the complete realization of
all the possibles, in so far as they are compossible, it excludes
any limiting and selective principle.
The realm of possibles is
infinite;
and the principle
of plenitude,
as the implicate
of
the principle
of sufficient. reason, when its implications
were
thought
through,
ran on, in every province in which it was
applied, into infinities -
infinite space, infinite time, infinite
worlds, an infinity of existent species, an infinity of individual
existences, an infinity of kinds of beings between any two kinds
of beings, however similar.
When its consequences were thus
fully drawn, it confronted the reason of man with a world by
which it was not merely baffled but negated; for it was a world
of impossible contradictions.
Thus -
to give only a single

332
THE GREAT CHAIN OF BEING
illustration -
the assumption of the continuity
of forms, im-
plicit though it was in the rationalistic
premises, was at vari-
ance with itself. Aside from the paradoxes of the concept of the
mathematical
continuum,
which contemporary
mathematics
purports
(unconvincingly,
as I can't
but think) to have re-
solved, a qualitative
continuum,
at all events, is a contradic-
tion in terms.
Wherever,
in any series, there appears a new
quale,a different kind of thing, and not merely a different mag-
nitude and degree of something common to the whole series,
there is eoipsoa breach of continuity.
And it follows that the
principles of plenitude and continuity -
though the latter was
supposed to be implied by the former -
were also at variance
with one another.
A universe that is "full,"
in the sense of ex-
hibiting the maximal diversity of kinds, must be chiefly full of
" leaps."
There is at every point an abrupt
passage to some-
thing different, and there is no purely logical principle deter-
mining -
out of all the infinitely various"
possible" kinds of
differentness -
which shall come next.
The world of concrete existence, then, is no impartial
tran-
script of the realm of essence; and it is no translation
of pure
logic into temporal
terms -
such terms
being themselves,
indeed, the negation of pure logic. It has the character and the
range of content and of diversity which it happens to have.
No
rational ground predetermined
from all eternity of what sort it
should be or how much of the world of possibility should be in-
cluded in it. It is,in short, a contingent world; 17 its magnitude,
its pattern,
its habits, which we call laws, have something
arbitrary
and idiosyncratic
about them.
But if this were not
the case, it would be a world without
a character,
without
power of preference or choice among the infinity of possibles.
If we may employ the traditional
anthropomorphic
language
of the theologians, we may say that in it Will is prior to In-
tellect.
On this issue the late-medieval opponents of the strict
rationalists in theology, the seventeenth-
and eighteenth-cen-
tury adversaries of Leibniz and Spinoza, and Voltaire and Dr.
Johnson in their polemic against the whole conception of the
Chain of Being, must be admitted to have had the better of the
argument.
It is to this conclusion thatthe
history of the prin-
ciples of plenitude
and continuity,
as metaphysical
theorems,

OUTCOME

333
and of the principle
of sufficient reason from which they de-
rived much of their persuasiveness, leads.
In the course of the
century
of reflection since the period at which our historical
survey has ended,
that
conclusion
has become
increasingly
current, explicitly or tacitly -
so much so that the sense of the
significance of the issue, and of the historic role and motiva-
tions of the contrary assumption, has been in great degree lost.
One aspect of the outcome is well illustrated
in a passage of
Professor Whitehead's,
which would, no doubt, have horrified
Plotinus and Bruno andSpinoza
and even Leibniz,
since it
gives the name of God, not to the Infinite Fecundity of emana-
tionism, but to the" principle of limitation."
"An element in
the metaphysical
situation,"
Mr. Whitehead
writes, "is that
such a principle is required."
"Some particular
how is neces-
sary, and some particularization
in the what of matter of fact is
necessary";
otherwise the"
apparent
irrational
limitation " of
the actual world can only be taken as a proof of its pure illusori-
ness.
"If
we. reject this alternative,
...
we must provide
a
ground for the limitation
which stands among the attributes
of the substantial
activity.
This attribute
provides the limita-
tion for which no reason can be given, for all reason flows from
it.
God is the ultimate limitation, and His existence is the ulti-
mate irrationality."
18
In its contrast with, and yet its unin-
tended confirmation
of, such an assertion of the primacy of the
non-rational,
the history of the complex of ideas with which we
have been occupied has at once its most pathetic interest, as a
manifestation
of a certain persistent craving of the philosophic
mind, and its permanent
instructiveness
for the philosophical
reflection of our own and later times.
Yet -
as many
historic
examples
show -
the utility of a
belief and its validity are independent
variables;
and errone-
ous hypotheses are often avenues to truth.
I may, therefore,
perhaps best bring these lectures to a close by a reminder
that
the idea of the Chain of Being, with its presuppositions
and im-
plications, has had many curiously happy consequences in the
history of Western
thought.
This at least, I hope, is suffi-
ciently evident from our long, yet inadequate,
review of the
part it has played in that history.

Socrates, that they are therefore essentially Platonic -
on this there
exists hardly any difference of opinion."

agreement between [Timaeus's] doctrine and things which are taught
in the dialogues, or even things which we know Plato to have main-

Plato-interpretation
is the tendency of scholars who do not reject the
Seventh Epistle to present accounts of the Platonic doctrines which are
utterly irreconcilable with it.
8. Ep. VII, 341c-344d.
Against the thesis that the Theory of Ideas is
abandoned or minimized even in the latest dialogues, the principal ob-
jection is well put by Shorey: "The challenge to find the ideas in dia-
logues later than the Parmenidesis easily met. Nothing can be more ex-

plicit than the Timaeus. The alternative is explicitly put: are the objects
of sense the only realities, and is the supposition of ideas mere talk?
(SIC) And it is affirmed that their reality is as certain as the distinction
between opinion and science....
They are characterized in terms ap-
plicable only to pure Being, and the familiar terminology is freely em-
ployed (52a, 27d, 2gb, 30, 37b)"
(The Unity of Plato's Thought, 1904,
p. 37).
And of the assertion that"
souls take the place of ideas in
Plato's later period,"
Shorey observes (equally justly, I think) that
"this is a complete misconception of Plato's thought and style.
It is
quite true that he did not confine the predicates of true and absolute
Being to the ideas; God is, of course, true Being, and in religious and
metaphysical passages need not always be distinguished from the ideas
taken collectively."
But" that the ideas still take precedence of souls
appears distinctly" in several of the later dialogues, e. g., the Statesman,
Timaeus, and Philebus (ibid., 39). Cf. Ritter, Kerngedanken, 174: "While
the original Theory of Ideas passes gradually quite into the background,
we may nevertheless affirm that not a single proposition is ever formally
retracted or even tacitly abandoned."
That the exegesis of Plato is far
from an exact science is further illustrated by the fact that Sir J. G.
Frazer -
in an early work recently republished -
defends the view
that Plato in his early writings did hold the Theory of Ideas, admitting,
however, ideal subsisting counterparts only of" good" things; but that
later in life he abandoned
the theory probably because" he saw that
logic compelled him to make an Idea of every common notion, and
hence of bad things as well as good."

On the repu tation and influence of the Timaeus, cf. Christ, Griechische
Literaturgeschichte(1912), I, 701. It was translated into Latin by Cicero,
but was known to the Middle Ages chiefly through the fourth-century
Latin version of Chalcidius,
Over forty ancient or medieval commen-
taries on it are known.
It is the Timaeusthat Plato holds in his hand in
Raphael's"
School of Athens."
In the eighteenth century the ideas it
contained exercised influence, not only through
the text of Plato, but
also through the vogue of the supposed treatise De animamundi,believed
to be an older writing of the Pythagorean Timaeus himself which was
utilized and"
embellished"
by Plato.
It is in fact a poor abridgment
or precisof part of the dialogue, of much later date.
There were at least
three seventeenth-century editions of it; and editions with French trans-
lations by d' Argens (1763) and by Batteux (1768) show the interest
still taken in this dull rehash of Plato's argument.

p,OpLa.The former interpretation was,
as Taylor has noted, "definitely held by some Neoplatonists (Amelius,
Theodorus of Asine)."
That it offers some difficulties cannot be denied;
and the second way of construing these words is therefore, perhaps cor-
rectly, preferred by Taylor, i. e., that"
Ka()' ~v refers to infimaespecies,
such as horse, man, KaTa 'YEVrjto larger groups, such as mammals, quad-
rupeds, and the like"
(Commentaryon Plato's Timaeus, 82).
Aristotle
testifies that Plato and his followers asserted the numerical equivalence
of the Ideas and the kinds of things that are their sensible counterparts:
"those who assumed the Ideas as causes . . . introduced
the notion
of a Second Class of entities equally numerous with them"
(Metaph.,
9gob 2). For further expressions of the thesis that all the Forms must be
realized in the cosmos, cf. Timaeus,3ge, 42e, 51a, g2C. Though clearly
fundamental
in Plato's reasoning here, the principle received full de-
velopment only from his successors. Of the rale of " Place" as the re-
ceptacle and therefore the "Mother"
of the embodied Forms I have
not spoken, since I am not attempting
a general exposition of Plato's
cosmology.

lowing an occasional usage of Leibniz himself, as the" principle of per-
fection," but the designation is not happily chosen, since" perfection"
and "fullness"
are primarily antithetic rather than equivalent terms.
It is only by a logical tour deforce that the latter is derived from the
former.
The principle of plenitude is rather the principle of the neces-
sity of imperfection in all its possible degrees.
37. This is substantially
true, in spite of a very few not altogether clear
obiterdictaof Aristotle's in which he seems to ascribe efficient causality
to the deity.
The question has been carefully examined, in the light of
all the pertinent passages, by Eisler in his monograph
(1893); cf, also
W. D. Ross, Aristotle'sMetaphysics(1924), Introd., clio
38. Metaphysics,II, rooga 2, and XI, 1071b 13. Book IX, 1047b 3, ff. seems
at first to contradict
this: "it cannot be true to say that this thing is
possible, and yet will not be."
But the context here shows that there is
no conflict between the two passages. Aristotle is simply remarking that
if a thing is not logically incapable of existing, i. e., does not involve con-
tradiction, we are not entitled to assertthat it will never exist in fact.
For if it were possible to assert this, the distinction between that which
is and that which is not capable of existing would disappear.
To be
exempt from logical impossibility is to be a potential existent; only of
that which is logically impossible can we know that it will never exist in
fact.
But the passage does not say that whatever is logically possible
must at some time exist in fact. Nevertheless, it has been construed by
some medieval and modern writers as an expression of the principle of
plenitude; cf., e. g., Wolfson, Crescas'Critiqueof Aristotle, 249 and 55 1,
and Monboddo, Originand Progressof Language,2d ed., I (1772), 269.

The passage was accessible to writers from about 1230 A.D. in
the Arabic-Latin version of Michael Scott. A version directly from 'the
Greek by William of Moerbeke was apparently completed in 126o. Cf.
also Metaphysics,XI, 107Sa 10: "We must consider in what way the
nature of the universe is related to the good and the most excellent:
whether things exist separately, each by itself, or whether they consti-
tute an ordered arrangement, or whether they have both characteristics,
like an army ....
All things are arranged in order in a certain manner,
but not in the same manner -
birds and beasts and plants.
They are
not disposed in such a way that there is nothing which relates one to
another."

Pure privation is 'matter'
in one of its Aristotelian
senses, that of UTEPl1ULS or negation (Phys. I, 190b 27, 191b 13). Thus
matter, as "in itself non-being"
defines the lower limit of the scale of
being.

all from all, and to nothing from none." -
Joh. ScotusErig., III, 19: God
as" nothing." -
Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theol., I, q.13, a. I 2. Thomas
endeavors, it is true, to show that positive affirmations which we can
make about God can be true, but it can only be sensueminentiori;the
predicates which we use have for us only the meaning whereby they are
applicable to creatures;
but no predicate can be applied univocally to
God and any other subject of discourse, since all the " perfections which
in created things are distinct and multiple pre-exist in God indivisibly
and simply."
No distinctions between predicates are really pertinent to
such a subject; though Thomas elsewhere seeks to reconcile this with the
proposition
that the divine attributes
are not all synonymous.
The
notion that terms may, without ceasing to have any meaning, be em-
ployed in a sensuseminentior,and the whole device of reasoning by a de-
liberate attribution
to God of contradictory
predicates, whose contra-
dictions are masked by that notion, still (as is usually overlooked)
survives in Spinoza; cf. Eth., I, 17, sch.: Intellectuset uoluntas,qui Dei

admi ts that there are no strictly" astronomical"

view; but there are two good" metaphysical"
reasons for it. The first
is that the sphere is "the most capacious"
of all figures, and therefore
the most suitable shape for the whole of things sensible; second, that the
archetype of the physical world is God himself, to whom, if any such

A Perfit Descriptionof the Caelestiall Orbes, ...
, 1576, appended
to his
edition of the PrognosticationEverlasting . . . of his father, Leonard Digges.
This, perhaps the most important
sixteenth-century
English defence of
Copernicanism,
which had been"
almost completely
neglected by all
writers on the history of science in the Elizabethan
period,"
was re-
cently rediscovered in the Huntington
Library by Francis R. Johnson
and Sanford V. Larkey and has been published by them in The Hunting-
ton Library Bulletin, NO.5, April, 1934, with a study of its background
and influence; it was unknown to me when the present lecture was orally
delivered.
That Digges expressed the theories of the infinity of worlds
and the diffusion of the stars throughout
infinite space in English before
Brunohad
propounded
them (in Italian and Latin) Johnson and Larkey
conclusively
show, but, as we have seen, this was not without
pre-
Copernican
precedents;
the novelty lay in its combination
with Coper-
nicanism.
Digges's discoverers declare
that, unlike the generality
of
sixteenth-century
astronomers,
"in approaching
this problem, he con-
sistently kept to the scientific point ofYiew"; but there is no evidence in
Digges's text to show this.
While he is "scientific"
enough in his de-
fence of the heliocentric theory, the only ground which he actually sug-
gests -
that
cited above -
for affirming
the numerical
and
spatial
infinity of the celestial system is of the usual a priori type.
That"
the
infinity of the universe was an ever recurring
subject of metaphysical
discussion throughout
the Middle
Ages and the Renaissance"
is re-
marked by Johnson
and Larkey, with further illustrations
(1°4-1°5).

In all this the affinity between Pascal and Cusanus is close, and one
may, I think, see in the De doctaignorantiaone probable source, direct or
indirect, of the sceptical side of the Pensles, It will be observed that in
one passage cited Pascal virtually quotes the famous phrase of Cusanus,
applying it as did the latter to the infinity of the physical world.
The
fifteenth-century philosopher had also made much of the argument that
"there is no proportionality
between the finite and the infinite" in his
contention that all our knowledge reduces to a deeper assurance of our
ignorance: quantain hac ignorantiaprofundiusdoctifuerimus, tanto magisad
ipsamaccedimusueritatem.Cusanus also (as Long has expressed it) found
"not merely a definite number of antinomies, such as Kant was to set
up, but as many of them as there were things that exist."
The concep-
tion of the nature of every part of the universe as organically involved
in the nature of every other part (quodlibetin quolibet),so that none can
be truly known unless all are known, was especially characteristic of the
philosophy of the Cusano Pascal's use of it in the interest 'of a similar
devout agnosticism is indicated above.
57. The earliest translation was by Mrs. Aphra Behn (1688, other editions,
1700, 1715), the second by the Platonist Glanvillf r688, 1695,third eel.by

(17 15, 1728,1757,

waste and useless those great bodies which are at such a distance from
us should not be waste and useless, but rather that they should be fur-
nished with beings adapted to their respective stations" (Spectator,519).

This was published in 1753 by Koenig in the course of the celebrated
controversy with Maupertuis in which Voltaire took the most conspicu-
ous part.
The authenticity of the letter was denied by Maupertuis and
by the Berlin Academy, of which he was President, but its genuineness
is sufficiently established by both external and internal evidence, and is
not questioned by contemporary
Leibniz specialists.
The letter was
quoted at length by Flourens in his AnalyseraisonniedestrauauxdeCuoier,
1841.
The text may be found in Buchenau and Cassirer's Leibniz:

For the derivation of the principle of continuity from that of plenitude,

nature, ...

4. For a typical expression of this, cf. Fenelon, De l'existencedeDieu (I 718) :
"Mes idees sont superieures amon esprit, puisqu'elles Ie redressent et Ie
corrigent.
Elles ont le caractere de la Divinite, car elles sont universelles
et immuables, comme Dieu ....
Si ce qui est changeant, passager et
emprunte
existe veritablement, a plus forte raison ce qui ne peut
changer et qui est necessaire."
(Pt. II, ch. iv).
5. The conception of the essencesof things as contained in the mind of God
goes back at least to Philo, and had been imposed upon most medieval
thought by the influence of Augustine; hence the transition from the
Platonic to the modern sense of the term" idea."

reasons of the world lie in something extramundane, different from the
chain of states or series of things, of which the aggregate constitutes the
world. We must therefore pass from physical or hypothetical necessity,
which determines posterior states of the world by prior, to something
which is of absolute or metaphysical necessity, the reason for which
cannot be given."
7. I have put the conception in these two alternative ways because there is

much wavering in Leibniz and his contemporaries
on the question
whether necessary judgments are ultimately"
analytic" or "synthetic."
Usually Leibniz himself called them analytic; but he certainly did not
mean by this that they were mere tautologies.
Such a judgment, as he
somewhere says, is not a coccysmusinutilis. It does not fall within the pur-
pose of the present historical study to discuss the fundamental
logical
questions involved in this distinction.

Yet it is in the thought of the divine self-sufficiency -
with some weak-
ening of its meaning and a happily confused logic -
that Milton finds
religious comfort, and the theme for some famous though in part rather
feeble lines, in the sonnet" When I consider how my light is spent."
It
is because" God doth not need either man's work or his own gifts" that
all service is equal, and"
they also serve who only stand and wait."
The notion of self-sufficiency, which properly implied the complete im-
passibility and indifference of deity, naturally tended to be transformed
into the essentially different but religiously much more satisfying notion
of the disinterestedness
of the divine activity.
Thus (1) Henry More
argues that, since God could not conceivably be benefited by anything
that man is, does, or suffers, he must be supposed to aim only at man's
good; this, of course, tended to destroy the conception, still potent in
popular religion, of the jealous celestial autocrat,
insistent upon sub-
servience and compliments from his creatures.
All what he doth is for the creature's gain,
Nought seeking from us for his own content:
What is a drop unto the Ocean's main?
(P.>.vchathanasia,
III, iv, 22.)
This made for a sort of ethical utilitarianism
upon theological grounds.
The same argument
occurs in Bruno's Spaccio,II.
(2) For the same
reason another Platonist, Norris of Bemerton, points out that religious

exercises are for man's benefit, not to afford any gratification
to the
object of worship.
(A Collectionof Miscellanies, 2 I I.)
(3) Henry More
finds a curious argument for immortality
in the idea of a self-sufficient
God.
If the eternal spectator of human life could be supposed to derive
any satisfaction from beholding that moving scene, there would be (to
use the phrase of a philosopher of our own time) a certain conservation
of the values of each life, and the extinction of the individual would not
be an absolute loss.
"But alas!
What doth the perpetual
repetition
of the same life or
deiform-image
throughout
all ages add unto him that is at once infi-
nitely himself, viz: good and happy?
So that there is nothing consider-
able in the creation, if the rational creature bernortal.
For neither is
God at all profited by it, nor man considerably."
(CompletePoems,ed.
Grosart, 165.)
It should be borne in mind that More and Norris (with some incon-
sistency) denied that the creation was arbitrary,
while asserting it to be
motiveless.

Clarke, Demonstration,etc. (1706), 7th ed., 65 ff. Clarke, it is true, speaks
of a "necessity of fitness," which means that" things could not have been
otherwise than they are without
diminishing
the beauty,
order, and
well-being of the whole -
which would have been impossible, since it
is impossible for a wise being to resolve to act foolishly."
Clarke here
seems to approximate
Leibniz's position, but in the later controversy
between them he is a long way from it.

could
hardly have made an epic out of a theodicy if he had not adopted this
theory; there would have been no stirring tale of the wars in heaven to
relate.
But it is difficult to believe that John Milton framed his the-
ological creed to suit the exigencies of his Iiterary ambitions.
We have, however, noted elsewhere some slight trace of the influence of
the principle of plenitude upon Milton, when he is dealing with certain
questions of cosmography.

Ptincipesde Lanatureet de la grace(1714), §§ 7-8; in Philos. Schriften,VI,
599-602; the same connection of ideas in Wolff (173 I). At this point, it
will be seen, the principle of sufficient reason and Leibniz's other" great
principle,"
that of contradiction,
come to the same result.
A necessary
being must exist because there would otherwise be no sufficientreason for
anything;
but also, a necessary being must exist because its essence in-

volves existence, so that to conceive of it as non-existent would be self-
contradictory;
and again, unless the opposite were thus self-contradic-
tory, it would not meet the requirements
of a sufficient reason.
The
second proposition is simply the ontological argument.
Some writers on
Leibniz have made too much of his criticism of that argument.
He ac-
cepts it absolutely, but adds that, as usually stated, it omits a needful
logical precaution.
The"
possibility"
of the idea of God -
i, e., its
non-contradictoriness,
should be shown before the necessity of existence
is, through the principle of contradiction,
inferred from it.
Leibniz,
however, had in fact no doubts about the" possibility"
of the idea of
God; so that the distinction does not affect his conclusions in any way,
and remains only a logical refinement upon the Anselmic reasoning.

in substance points out, the principle of sufficient reason is equivalent to
the proposition"
accepted by everybody except some doctors too much
wrapped up in their own subtleties," and approved by the greatest of
the Schoolmen, that all volition is sub specieboni,a choice of what either
is, or is by the chooser believed to be, a good.

on pragmatic grounds -
for those who will accept none other.
Reason-
ing with a correspondent who had evinced a leaning towards" the seep-
ticism of the Academics," he points out that that principle can be suffi-
ciently justified on the ground of its needfulness if we are to reason at all.

In this passage, however, Leibniz, pre-
sumably to avert the charge of determinism,
gives an unusual meaning
to "mecessary," making it equivalent
to "demonstrative,"
i. e., capa-
ble of reduction
to an intuited
necessity by us. That it is an intuited
necessity to the perfect understanding,
however, the passage plainly
affirms.

1686).
68. This has been recognized and well expressed by
COlI tura t (Logiquede
Leibnir, 1901, p. 214).
Russell, on the other hand,
has denied that
Leibniz held the view" that the difference between the necessary and
the contingent has an essential reference to our human limitations, and
does not subsist for God."
"Everything
that is characteristic of Leibniz
depended upon the ultimately irreducible nature of the opposition be-
tween existential and necessary propositions"
(op. cit., 1901, 61-62).
Leibniz, however, as will be seen, enunciated categorically and repeat-
edly the opinion which Russell thinks he cannot have held.
It is true
that he often said things which sound, and taken literally are, incon-
sistent with it; and these are more" characteristic"
in one sense, namely,
that they make his system look more different from that of Spinoza.
But he had obvious non-philosophical
reasons for employing such ex-
pressions; and they are capable
of being construed in a Pickwickian
sense which would harmonize
them with the thesis cited above.
The
latter, on the contrary, Leibniz had no conceivable motive for asserting
unless he believed it; it is, in fact, plain that he thought it both true and
fundamental;
and his expression of it cannot possibly be given any sense
which would admit the" ultimately irreducible nature of the opposition
between existential and necessary propositions."
Russell is also in error,
I think, in asserting an ultimate
distinction
in Leibniz between the
necessary and the apriori (op. cit., 231) . Cf. Opuscules,etc. (1903),518.

Cf. also the Latin
essays of D. Straehler
(1727) and Chr. Langhansen (1727), both of which criticize Leibniz and
Wolff as" pseudo-defensores contingentiae."
That the principle of suffi-
cient reason itselfmeant
for Leibniz that every true proposition is, and
by a perfect intelligence is apprehended
as, reducible to "primitive"
or
"identical"
truths, is noted by Straehler
(p, 37).

An earlier seventeenth-century
writer, Matthew
Barker, had, indeed,
reversed the usual reasoning, deducing
the existence of God from the
necessity of a full Chain of Being, rather than the Chain of Being from
the necessary existence of God: "These degrees in nature are by learned
men called the Scale of Nature;
and we must come to some top in the
Scale or Ladder,
and not ascend ad infinitum, though we must into in-
finity, which is the Infinite God ...
where there are degrees of per-
fection, there must needs be some greatest perfection, and what can that
be but God, who is Optimuset Maximus, who is the most Excellent Being
and the first Perfection"
(}t{aturalTheology(1674), 27). Substantially
the
same argument
has recently been independently
advanced
by Profes-
sor w. H. Sheldon, Phi/os. Reel.(1923),

Russell seems curiously to miss the point when he writes: "Why Leibniz
holds that substances form a continuous series it is difficult to say. He
never, so far as I know, offers the shadow of a reason, except that such
a world seems to him pleasanter
than one with gaps."
(1901, p. 65.)
The reason, as indicated above, is the same as the reason for believing
that there is a reason for anything -
namely, that the alternative would
be a world of chance.
Leibniz's aversion from the latter supposition is,
no doubt, as I have suggested, at bottom pragmatic,
but it is not unin-
telligible nor merely whimsical,
Let a single gap be supposed in the
Chain of Being, and, according to his logic, the universe would by that
alone be shown to be non-rational,
and therefore utterly untrustworthy.

A FreeInquiryinto theNature and Origin of Evil (1757), 60-62. Jenyns for
the most part merely puts into clear and concise form the arguments of
King, Leibniz, and Pope; but he differs from these in unequivocally and
emphatically rejecting the freedomist solution of the problem of moral
evil. His book had a considerable vogue, went into numerous editions,
and was translated into French.

was" necessary," and how" Infinite Wisdom" made the best of it.
4. Voltaire, however, is arguing in the poem against two distinct and essen-

type, which endeavored to explain such a thing as the Lisbon earth-
quake as
l'effet des eternell~s lois
Qui d'un Dieu libre et bon necessitent Ie choix,
and the theological and indeterminist type, which saw in such catastro-
phes special interpositions of deity in punishment of men's free choice of
moral evil. The reasonings aimed at these two opposite objectives Vol-
taire confusingly runs together.

9. Bolingbroke in the Fragmentsquotes King frequently and with respect.
I can see no sufficient reason for doubting
that in the Fragmentsas
printed
we have, as Bolingbroke asserted, in a somewhat expanded
form" the notes which were communicated
to Mr. Pope in scraps, as
they were written,"
and utilized by the latter in writing the Essay on
Man; the numerous and exact verbal parallels between passages in the
Fragmentsand the Essayare not susceptible of any other probable expla-
nation (see Bolingbroke's Works, 1809 ed., VII, 278, and VIII,
356).
Law wrote in the preface to the 1781 edition of the Essayonthe Originof
Evil: "I had the satisfaction of seeing that those very principles which
had been maintained
by Archbishop King were adopted by Mr. Pope
in the Essay onMan."
When this was challenged by a brother-bishop,
Pope's truculent theological champion Warburton,
Law replied by re-
ferring to the testimony of Lord Bathurst, "who saw the very same sys-
tem in Lord Bolingbroke's own hand, lying before Mr. Pope while he
composed his Essay"; and added: "The
point may also be cleared-ef-
fectually whenever any reader shall think it worth his while to compare
the two pieces together, and observe how exactly they tally with one
another"
(op. cit., p. xvii).
Such a comparison seems to me to give
reason to believe that Pope made use of King's work directly, as well as
of Bolingbroke's adaptation
of a part of it.
Since
~t was in 1730 that
Pope and Bolingbroke were" deep in metaphysics," and since by 1731
the first three Epistles seem to have been completed (cf. Courthope, V,
242), it must have been from the Latin original, not Law's translation,
that the poet and his philosophic mentor drew.
Thus essentially the
same theodicy appeared almost simultaneously in Law's English prose
rendering and in Pope's verse. On the relation of King's work to Hal-
ler's UeberdenUrsprungdesUebels(1734) cf. L. M. Price in Publicationsof

we can extend our Enquiries; and how every Being in the Scale of Life
within our Observation rises in due degree: Let him then consider how
necessary the Existence of such a Species as Man is to the ascending
Plenitude of Nature; to its FullnessandCoherence;and let him impartially
examine our Constitution,

that though there be good reason to think that there are various Orders

It is only fair to add that King is equally ready to view as "necessary,"
and consequently to approve and justify, specific evils less remote from
archiepiscopal
experience, such as "gout,
one of the most tormenting
diseases that attend us" -
by which, in fact, this resolute optimist was
cruelly harassed for nearly half a century, and from an attack of which,
according to his biographer, he died (see Sir C. S. King's life of William
King,
1906, 14 and passim). Gout,
the archbishop
observes, in a
sportsmanlike if not wholly edifying vein, has compensations which, on
the whole, outweigh its pains: "Who would not rather endure it than
lose the pleasure of feeling?
Most men are sensible that eating certain
meats, and indulging ourselves in the use of several drinks, will bring it;
and yet we see this doth not deter us from them, and we think it more
tolerable to endure the gout, than lose the pleasure that plentiful eating
and drinking yields us" (I, 177). Why it was" necessary" apriori that
these pleasures should be purchasable only at that price remains, in the
end, somewhat obscure.

struggles with the same
difficulty in the preface to A Free Inquiry, etc., in Works (1790), II, 6:
against the argument"
but one material
objection has been urged;
which is this, that, in order to make room for this necessity of evil, the
real existence of a paradisaical
state is represented as at all times im-
possible; and consequently the Mosaic account of that state is utterly
exploded."
Jenyns's
reply consists, first, in intimating
some doubt
whether"
a literal belief in that account is essential to the true faith of
a Christian";
and, second, in maintaining that the Mosaic history does
not offer a description of a "primitive
state of absolute perfection, void
of all evil," since" the parent of all evil is one of the principal characters
of that history."
Jenyns elsewhere rejects the whole primitivistic as-
sumption on the ground that it is inconsistent with the doctrine of the
eternal necessity of all the evils we know.
"That
man came perfect,
that is, endued with all possible perfections, out of the hands of his Cre-
ator, is a false notion," possible only to men who were ignorant of the
origin of evil, i. e., who did not understand that" in the scale of beings
there must be," at all times, "such a creature as man, with all his in-
firmities about him"
(ibid., p. 71).

There is no question of any influence of King upon Leibniz or of Leibniz
upon King.
Though the Thlodicle was not published until 1710, eight
years after the De originsmali, the greater part of it was written between
1697 and the beginning of 1705; and the ideas it contains had long been
familiar to Leibniz.

Leibniz observes that he is in agreement with King"
only in respect to
half of the subject";
the disagreement relates chiefly to King's chapter
on liberty and necessity, which (quite inconsistently with the implica-

LECTURE
VIII
I.
Several of the topics of this and the following lecture have been inter-
estingly dealt with in an article by A. Thienemann,
"Die Stufenfolge
der Dinge, der Versuch eines natiirlichen Systems der Naturkorper
aus
dem achtzehnten jahrhundert,"
in ZoologischeAnnalen,III (1910), 185-
275.
It includes the text of a previously unpublished
and anonymous
German
writing
of 1780, "Entwurf
einer nach der mutmasslichen
Stufen-Folge eingerichteten
allgemeinen
Naturgeschichte,"
in which
the mineralogy,
botany, zoology, and theology of the period are em-
ployed in the construction of a detailed Scale of Nature from the" ele-
men t earth '.' to the Trinity.
2.
Opecit., III, Ch. 6, §§ 3, 6. "By this real essence I mean that real con-
stitution of any thing, which is the foundation of all those properties that
are combined in, and are constantly found to coexist with, the nominal
essence; and that particular
constitution which everything has within
itself, without any relation to anything without it....
As to the real
essences of substances, we only suppose their being, without precisely
knowing what they are; but that which annexes them still to the species,
is the nominal essence, of which they are the supposed foundation and
cause" (§ 6).. The passage is one of those which bring out the fact about
Locke which the historians of philosophy have in great part missed -
that in his epistemology he was essentially a Platonist.
In the case of
material things, however, Locke confuses the logical distinction between
the necessary and the merely contingent coinherence of attributes with
the meta physical distinction of primary and secondary qualities and the
physical distinction of perceptible gross matter and the insensible mi-
nute components of matter (Ibid., § 2).

All the other resemblances

other are neither so real nor so certain; these intervals, therefore, are the
only lines of demarcation which will be found in our work."

not with certainty be taken as an assertion of identity of descent, but
that is the most natural meaning of Linnaeus's language.
17. The Lay Monastery,by Blackmore and Hughes (sd edt of The Lay Monk)
(1714), 28. Cf. the remark of Sir John Ovington, VoyagetoSurat (I 6g6),
cited by R. W. Frantz in ModernPhilology(1931) , 55-57: the Hottentots
are" the very Reverse of Human kind, ...
so that if there's any medium
between a Rational Animal and a Beast, the Hottentot
lays the fairest
claim to that species."
Sir William Petty had still earlier remarked, in
treating of the" Scale of Creatures,"
that" of man itself there seems to
bee severall species," and refers to the" Negros who live about the Cape
of Good .Hope as the most beastlike of all the Sorts of Men with whom
our travellers are well acquainted"
(The Petty Papers, I 927, II, 3I).
Soame Jenyns in the middle of the century also cites, among the evi-
dences of the continuity of the chain of beings, the way in which the
attribute of reason" in the dog, the monkey and the chimpanze unites
so closely with the lowest degree of that quality in man" -
exemplified
here also by "the brutal Hottentot"
-
"that
they cannot easily be dis-
tinguished one from another."

gressof Language,sd ed., I (1774), 26g ff.
I g. Contemplationde la Nature, III, chi 30. As the passage was added as a
footnote to the edition of 178I, Bonnet may have been reading Rousseau
or Monboddo; the latter had ascribed similar mental and moral qual-
ities to the orang-outang.

Fusil in his La poisi«scieniifiquesees in these lines an ex-

here" for the first
time poetry attempts to sing the epic of life as modern science conceives
it."
But, as is so often the case in writings of the period, it is impossible
to be sure whether the poet is speaking of a temporal sequence of stages
of evolution or merely of the consecutive"
steps," i. e., grades, in the
Scale of Beings; the latter seems here the more probable.
Even if the
French poet be credited with the former conception, he had been antici-
pated by Akenside (v. below, Lect, IX).

Experimental Philosophy, in Three Books. . ..
By Henry
Power, D. of
Physick. London, 1664. I am indebted for this passage to Dr. Marjorie
Nicolson of Smith College, whose comprehensive study of this phase of
the history of science and of its repercussions in literature will, it is to be
hoped, soon become available to all students of these subjects.
An ear-
lier foreshadowing
of microscopic discoveries not yet made, in all the
"three
kingdoms of the universal spirit (the Vegetable,
Animal and
Mineral),"
is to be found in T. Mayerne's
preface to The Theater of In-
sects or Lesser Living Creaturesby Thos. Moufett, 1634. The creatures not
visible to the naked eye" all testifie the infinite Power of the Supreme
Creator of all things."

It is, of course, beyond the scope of this history to deal with the relation
of all this to the modern beginning, or renewal, and development of the
germ-theory
of disease.
(It had been suggested; in antiquity
as an ex-
plana tion of malaria by Varro, De re rustica, I, 12, 2.) But it is of some
relevance to note that the theory was propounded
by Sir William Petty
in 1677 to explain the manner of diffusion of the plague: "There
is no
better hypothesis whereby to make out the destructions of so many thou-
sand men in a season by the disease called the plague, than by imagining
the same to be done by Millions of invisible Animals, that travell from
Country to Country, even out of Africa into England"
(The Petty Papers,
II, 29). To such a hypothesis Petty was naturally
predisposed by his
belief in the fullness of the "chain
of creatures."

Voltaire raises the same objections more briefly in a note to his Poemon
the Lisbon Disaster, 1755, in which he partly confuses -
as Pope had
done before him -
the conception of the chain of causality (chainedes
evenements)with the chain of beings.
But with respect to the latter he
observes, in his note of 1756:
"The
chain is not an absolute plenum.
It is demonstrated
that the
heavenly bodies perform their revolutions in a non-resistant space. Not
all space is filled. There is not, therefore, a series (suite) of bodies from
an atom to the most remote of the stars; there can therefore be immense
intervals between sensible beings, as well as between insensible ones.
We cannot, then, be sure that man is necessarily placed in one of the
links which are attached one to another in an unbroken sequence."

Here, however,
Leibniz still admits the possibility of" natural species," but insists that
our determination
of them can"be" only provisional and in correspond-
ence with our [limited] knowledge."
Nevertheless, the number of such
species was obviously vastly reduced, and the descent of most forms com-
monly regarded as of different species from common ancestors differing
very greatly from most of their descendants
is implied.

This had already been more briefly said by Leibniz in a letter to the
Electress Sophia
(Nov. 4, 1696): "Since
there is nothing
outside the
universe which could prevent it from doing so, it must necessarily be the
case that the universe develops and advances continually"
(Werke, ed.
Kopp, 1873, VIII,
16). It must be added that there are other passages
in Leibniz which it is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with these,
and that his views on the matter wereprobably
not unwavering.

that this law of alternate cycles of evolution and dissolution applies also
to the entire cosmical system: "the time will finally come when even the
great system of which the fixed stars are the members will similarly,
through the cessation of its motions, collapse into chaos."
But it is prob-
able that he is referring to the fixed stars that already exist and are visi-
ble to us; before the systems which these compose reach their term, at
the further limits of the creation, in the region occupied by unformed
rnatter, "Nature
with a continuous advance proceeds to extend further
the plan of the revelation of deity and to fill eternity, as well as all
space, with its wonders"
(ibid.).

104 ff.) had included homomarinusamong the recognized denizens of the
deep, upon the testimony of trustworthy
observers, and had presented
woodcuts of these creatures, including an episcopusmarinus; and the be-
lief in them, supported as it seemed to be both by the principle of pleni-
tude and the supposed testimony of many witnesses, could claim a cer-
tain respectability down to the late eighteenth century.

For Goethe's elaboration
of the con-
ception cf. his Versuchiiberdie Gestaltder Tiere (I 790) and Erster Entururf
einerallgemeinenEinleitungin dieuergleichendeAnatomie(1795).
In the latter
work, for example, Goethe insists upon the all-importance
for the zoolo-
gist of recognizing
"eine
allgemeine
Bilde, worin die Gestalten
sarnt-
licher Tiere, die Moglichkeit nach, enthalten
waren, und wonach man
jedes Tier in einer gewissen Ordnung
beschriebe
...
Schon aus der
allgemeinen
Idee eines Typus folgt, dass kein einzelnes Tier, als ein
solcher Vergleichungsform
ausgestellt
werden
konne:
kein Einzelnes
kann Muster des Ganzen sein ...
Betrachten
wir nach jenem, erst im
allgemeinsten
aufgestellten Typus die verschiedenen
Teile der vollkom-
mensten,
die wir Saugetiere
nennen, so finden wir, dass der Bildungs-
kreis der Natur zwar eingeschrankt
ist dabei,jedoch,
wegen der Menge
der Teile und wegen der vielfachen Modificabilitat,
die Veranderungen
der Gestalt
in's Unendliche
moglich werden."
Goethe's
excitement
over the discovery of this idea, during his Itali an journey,
may be seen
in his letter to Frau von Stein, July
10, 1786: he wishes that he could
"impart
to everyone"
his" vision"
and his joy, but it is impossible.
And it is no dream, no phantasy.
"It is a discovery of the essential form
with which Nature
always plays, and in playing
brings forth all the
manifoldness
of life.
Had
I time in the short span of a single life, I
would devote myself to extending it to all the kingdoms of Nature -
to
her entire domain."

Rotten,

PlatonischeIdee, 1913.

of the" fumbling"

However, he adds, this is but"
a bold conjecture, which he gives only
for what it is worth."
This idea was adopted by Lord Monboddo
in his
Antient M etaphysics(I 779-99), and it is not altogether

of any animal whatever:
"it
may be that there will be a
con tinual, more or less slow progress of all species towards a higher per-
fection; so that all the grades of the scale will be continuously variable
in a determinate
and constant ratio: I mean that the mutability of each
grade will always have its reason in the grade which immediately pre-
cedes it"

De Sublimitate, § VII; tr. by 'V.Smith, 1770.
I have thought it more
pertinent here to cite an eighteenth-century
version, but add Professor
Rhys Roberts' more literal rendering of the last sentence: "When
men
of different pursuits, lives, ambitions,
ages, languages,
hold identical
views on one and the same subject, then that verdict which results, so to
speak, from a concert of discordant
elements makes our faith in the
object of admiration
strong and unassailable"
(Longinus on the Sublime,
1899, p. 57).
Longinus, says a typical (because commonplace)
writer
of the middle of the century, "might
with equal justice have extended
the same criterion
to all the inferior excellencies of elegant composi-
tion."
W. Melmoth, the younger, Fitzosbome's Letters (1746),
130.

Mr. Saintsbury has, I think, stopped just short of the main point, when,
aproposof the Essay on Criticism,he writes. " What [Pope] meant by' fol-
lowing nature'
and what we mean by it, are two quite different things.
He, usually at least, means' stick to the usual, the ordinary,
the com-
monplace'"
(Hist. ofCriticism, II (1902), 456).
This is true; but Pope

enjoins ccsticking to the usual" only because the poet cannot otherwise
expect to reach all mankind.

ccThe poet does not number the streaks of the tulip, or describe the dif-
ferent shades in the verdure of the forest; he is to exhibit in his portraits
of nature such prominent and striking features as recall the original to
every mind; and must neglect the minuter discriminations; which one
may have remarked and another have neglected, for those characteris-
tics which are alike obvious to vigilance and carelessness."

18. P. Reiff in Euphorion(1912), 591 ff. In a letter to F. Schlegel in
I 798
Novalis wrote:
cc I do not know if I have already spoken to you of my
beloved Plotinus.
Through Tiedemann
I have been initiated into this
philosopher, born expressly for me, and I have been almost frightened
by his resemblance to Kant and Fichte. He pleases me more than either
of them"
(cited in Spenle, Nooalis, 188 fr., where the nature of the
Plotinian influence upon that writer is analyzed).
19. OPt cit., Cotta ed., XII,
189, 188. The Letterswere first published in
1786 and (the last) 1789; but the TheosophiedesJulius, from which most
of the citations here are taken, was certainly in part, and probably as a
whole, written in 1781 or 1782. On the dates and probable sources of
the PhilosophischeBriefe,cf. Ueberweg, Schillerals Historikerund als Philo-
soph (1884), 72-96; and on the significance of this early work for the
understanding
of Schiller's philosophical biography,
V. J. Goebel in
Jour. of English and GermanicPhilology,XXIII
(1924), 161-172.
That
Schiller was at this time acquainted with the works of Leibniz at first
hand appears improbable;
but, as a pupil in the Karlsschule, he had
early become familiar with the general principles of the Leibnitio-
Wolffian system. On this cf. W. Iffert, Derjunge Schiller(1926), 34-57.
