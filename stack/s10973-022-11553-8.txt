Abstract
2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105), one of the typical representatives of insensitive energetic materials 
with excellent thermal stability and high energy output, has potential applications in insensitive boosters, detonators, and 
main charges in specialty munitions. As the environment temperature inevitably varies during the entire life cycle, it is of 
great significance to study the thermal behavior of LLM-105 for its reliability and safety in packaging, transportation, stor-
age, and use. This contribution aims to give a comprehensive overview of the thermal behavior of LLM-105 over a wide 
temperature range. We summarize the variations of temperature-dependent physical properties and phase behavior with a 
particular focus on the thermal decomposition of LLM-105. This review of these achievements, which have already been 
made, is expected to have a better guide of the practical use of LLM-105 as the key ingredient in explosive compositions.

Introduction
The typical characteristic that releases the stored chemical 
energy in a short time upon external stimuli makes ener-
getic materials (EMs) widely applied in civilian and military 
fields [1]. However, this characteristic also represents that 
unexpected reactions might occur for EMs under accidental 
stimuli and result in immeasurable losses [2]. The insen-
sitiveness to external stimuli is essential for the safety of 
EMs during the whole lifespan. EMs with high energy, low 
sensitivity, and excellent thermal stability are the demands 
of the current development of modern engineering projects 
and space exploration.
2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) 
is one typical insensitive high explosive with excellent 
thermal stability. Its mechanical and thermal sensitivi-
ties are between those of 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitroben-
zene (TATB, an extremely insensitive explosive) and 
octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazine (HMX, a 
widely used powerful explosive), while its calculated energy 
content was 20% more than that of TATB and 85% of HMX 
[3]. Since it was synthesized in 1995 at Lawrence Livermore 
National Lab (LLNL), LLM-105 has attracted much atten-
tion due to its potential applications in insensitive boosters, 
detonators, and main charges in specialty munitions [4–7]. 
For example, Wang et al. found that the explosive formu-
lation (95% LLM-105 and 5% ethylene propylene diene 
monomer) was a very promising insensitive and high energy 
booster [8]. LLNL has developed a variety of formulations 
by varying the type and amount of binders and found LX-21 
(94% LLM-105 and 6% Viton-A) can be used as an excellent 
booster [9, 10].
When used as a main explosive ingredient, LLM-105 
would suffer from ambient temperature fluctuations dur-
ing processing, transportation, storage, and use. Material 
properties, including chemical properties, thermal proper-
ties, mechanical properties, electrical properties, acoustic 
properties, and optical properties, would vary with the tem-
perature. Among all these temperature-dependent proper-
ties, thermal properties and chemical properties of LLM-
105 crystals, including thermal expansion, thermal capacity, 
phase transition, and thermal decomposition, are of most 
concerned (Table 1). Thermal expansion is strongly associ-
ated with the dimensional stability of explosive charges at

service temperature. Explosives with a high thermal expan-
sion coefficient can hardly be applied reliably in a wide tem-
perature range. The specific heat of explosives reflects the 
temperature rise under certain thermal stimuli, which is vital 
for the macroscopic assessment of the safety performance. 
The phase transition of explosives might change the sensi-
tivities against friction and impact and affect the detonation 
performance. Thermal decomposition, which occurs across 
the entire life span of explosives, not only determines the 
storage life of explosives, but also is a key factor influencing 
the safety in the process of machining and transportation. 
Therefore, thermal behaviors of LLM-105 are closely related 
to the reliability and safety performance, and possess great 
significance on evaluating its performance.
Understanding the diverse physical and chemical response 
behavior under thermal stimuli is critical to the practical 
use of LLM-105. There have been considerable articles 
that focus on the thermal behaviors of LLM-105 in certain 
temperature ranges in the early years. Here we present a 
comprehensive review of the thermal behaviors of LLM-105 
based on these research results. The temperature-dependent 
physical properties of LLM-105, including thermal expan-
sion and specific heat capacity, are systematically described. 
Furthermore, the phase state of LLM-105 under different 
ambient conditions is discussed. The thermal decomposition 
process of LLM-105, including the decomposition kinetics, 
decomposition mechanism, and the influencing factors, are 
carefully investigated. Finally, the remaining challenges that 
require more effort are highlighted.
Temperature‑dependent physical properties
Thermal expansion
LLM-105 explosives typically expand when heated 
and contract when cooled. The rate at which LLM-105 
expands with increase in temperature at constant pressure 
is referred as the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). 
The CTE of LLM-105 has been measured based on the 
change in lattice parameters with temperature by using 
X-ray diffraction (Table 2). The CTE of LLM-105 cell 
volume αV at 300–500 K that measured by Gump et al. 
using synchrotron angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction was 
found to be (2.09 ± 0.09) × ­10−4 ­K−1 [11]. In comparison, 
the average CTE of volume obtained with powder X-ray 
diffraction (PXRD) was 12.98 × ­10−5 ­K−1 in a similar tem-
perature range (303 K–473 K) and 1.49 × ­10−4 ­K−1 from 
160 to 360 K [12, 13]. As these CTE values were obtained 
based on the calculation of the crystal lattice parameter 
measurements, the measurement accuracy of different 
X-ray diffraction devices resulted in discrepancies in these 
CTE results.
The thermal expansion of LLM-105, with the b-axis of the 
LLM-105 crystal cell showing greater expansion than the a 
or c-axes, exhibits highly anisotropic (Table 2). The average 
CTEs in different lattice directions are αa = 3.31 × ­10−5 ­K−1, 
αb = 6.82 × ­10−5 ­K−1, and αc = 3.06 × ­10−5 ­K−1 from 303 to 
473 K, while αa = 3.44 × ­10−5 ­K−1, αb = 8.47 × ­10−5 ­K−1, 
and αc = 3.44 × ­10−5  ­K−1 between 160 and 360  K 
and αa = 1.33 × ­10−5  ­K−1, αb = 5.95 × ­10−5  ­K−1, and 
αc = 1.89 × ­10−5 ­K−1 below 160 K. Besides, the CTEs of 
LLM-105 were not constant, but varied with temperature. 
This temperature dependence of thermal expansion of 
LLM-105 was assumed to be affected by the relaxation of 
the intermolecular hydrogen bond network with increasing 
temperature [12].

Thermal behaviors of LLM‑105: a brief review﻿	
1 3
Most explosives, including LLM-105 crystals, are very 
brittle [14]. The uneven temperature would cause imbal-
anced expansion of explosives which again causes thermal 
stress and this might lead to fracture. Thus, the expansion 
and contraction of LLM-105 must be considered when 
designing molds for casting,  designing specific structures, 
and in other situations that large temperature changes are 
expected. It is worth noting that the measurements of the 
expansion of the lattice parameter do not necessarily cor-
respond to the macroscopic expansion of the bulk mate-
rial [15]. When more than one phase is present, typically 
LLM-105 crystals containing voids, impurities or residual 
solvents and LLM-105 based explosive formulations, the 
macroscopic expansion would be affected by the expansion 
of all phases and can hardly be calculated directly from the 
crystal lattice measurement recorded by the X-ray pattern. 
The LLM-105 crystals are typically randomly oriented in 
the bulk material, resulting in isotropic macroscopic expan-
sion of LLM-105 based explosive formulations. Although 
the expansion can be affected by micro-structural properties, 
such as the size of the crystallites, porosity, polymer molecu-
lar mass distribution, density, and material purity, its thermal 
expansion coefficient should be theoretically no higher than 
the maximum expansion coefficient of LLM-105 in differ-
ent lattice directions. For the RX-55-AA formulation (95% 
LLM-105, 5% Viton by mass), its average thermal expansion 
coefficient was 6.6 × ­10−5 ­K−1 over 298–423 K, while the 
CTE of RX-55-AE-5 formulation (97.5% LLM-105, 2.5% 
Viton by mass) was 6.1 × ­10−5 ­K−1 at 294 K [7, 16]. The 
CTEs of both formulations are different from the crystal 
lattice expansion of LLM-105 and lower than the reported 
αb values in the same temperature range.
Specific heat capacity
Specific heat capacity is a physical property of matter that 
reflects the amount of heat to be supplied to heat the matter. 
The heat capacity plays a major role in the hazard assess-
ment of explosives during storage or when exposed to exter-
nal thermal stimuli.
Heat capacity behaves very similar to thermal expansion, 
and there is a proportionality between thermal expansion and 
heat capacity [17]. The previously reported values of heat 
capacity of LLM-105 are summarized and shown in Fig. 1. 
With modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), 
Weese et al. measured the specific heat capacity, Cp, at a 
linear heating rate of 3 °C ­min−1 and obtained that the aver-
age Cp between about 233 K and 373 K was 0.931 J ­g−1 ­K−1 
[7]7. Ma et al. also determined the specific heat capacity of 
LLM-105 by using MDSC with a much lower heating rate 
(0.15 K ­min−1) and found that the specific heat capacity of 
LLM-105 present a good linear relationship (Eq. 1) with 
temperature in the range of 283 K to 353 K [18].
Tarver et al. gave the Cp values of LLM-105 in a very wide 
temperature range (298–1273 K) for the calculation of the 
times to thermal explosion, however, the method used to obtain 
these values was absent [5]. The heat capacity values used by 
Tarver et al. were 1.005 J ­g−1 ­K−1 at 298 K, 1.256 J ­g−1 ­K−1 
at 373 K, 1.423 J ­g−1 ­K−1 at 433 K, 1.674 J ­g−1 ­K−1 at 563 K, 
1.926 J ­g−1 ­K−1 at 623 K, 2.302 J ­g−1 ­K−1 at 773 K, and 
2.302 J ­g−1 ­K−1 when it is higher than 1273 K.
Through quantum chemical calculation, Wang et al. 
found the relationship between temperature and the stand-
ard molar specific heat capacity of LLM-105 from 273 to 
1000 K conformed to a quadratic equation (Eq. 2) [19]. 
Although the theoretical calculation result has a large 
deviation from experimental values, it predicts the trend 
of the heat capacity changing with temperature, that is, 
the growth of specific heat capacity slows down with the 
increase in temperature.
For an LLM-105 based explosive formulation, its specific 
capacity is the sum of the products of mass fraction times the 
specific heat capacity of each ingredient. Therefore, compar-
ing the heat capacity values of RX-55-AE-5 (0.950 J ­g−1 ­K−1) 
and LLM-105 (0.931 J ­g−1 ­K−1) measured by Weese et al., 
the proportion of components and the specific heat capacity 
of the other ingredient (Viton) can be inferred [7].

the intermediate liquid phase. For EMs, it occurs at tem-
peratures and pressures below the triple point in the phase 
diagram. The sublimation process of EMs may be used 
advantageously (sample purification, trace detection of 
EMs) or as a nuisance (vapor inhalation poisoning). The 
sublimation rates, enthalpies of sublimation, and vapor 
pressures of EMs are the parameters of vital importance 
for better utilizing the sublimation process.
Obvious sublimation process with high sublimation rate 
would occur for LLM-105 when the temperature is higher 
than 493 K, which has been confirmed by the Infrared 
spectrum of the evolved gaseous products  before decom-
position [20]. The sublimation process of LLM-105 has 
been used for its purification, and thin-film and nanosheet 
preparation [21–23].
As an important parameter to describe the sublimation 
process, the vapor pressure of LLM-105 is rarely reported. 
ChemSpider exhibits a vapor pressure value of 0.3 Torr 
at 298 K, which is too high (~ 55,000 times as high as 
the vapor pressure of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene at 298 K) to be 
unreliable [24, 25]. Pesce-Rodriguez et al. predicted the 
vapor pressure values based on the correlation between 
the reliable experimental vapor pressure measurement of 
known materials and the temperature at which mass loss 
begins in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and found 
that the vapor pressure of LLM-105 at 298, 343, and 373 K 
were 8.50 × ­10−16, 9.15 × ­10−13, and 50.4 × ­10−10 Torr, 
respectively[26, 27]. Since the indirect method for estimat-
ing vapor pressures was not widely accepted, the experi-
mental results of vapor pressure of LLM-105 reported by 
Pesce-Rodriguez et al. seem to be less reliable. To date, an 
accurate measurement of the vapor pressure of LLM-105 
is still lacking.
The enthalpy of sublimation of LLM-105 has been esti-
mated by using density functional theory (DFT) calcula-
tions and experimental measurements. Hu et al. present a 
predictive model that combined the empirical relations of 
Politzer with first-principles density-functional calcula-
tions of the electronic properties of the molecular surfaces 
and obtained the heats of sublimation of LLM-105 was 
114.7 kJ ­mol−1, while Manaa et al. provided an estimate for 
the enthalpy of sublimation of 135.6 kJ ­mol−1 through DFT 
calculations of the crystal and the gas phases of LLM-105 
[28, 29]. ChemSpider reported the calculated the enthalpy 
value of sublimation of 129.6 kJ ­mol−1 for LLM-105 [24]. 
Through a Clausius-Clapeyron plot of predicted vapor 
pressures, Pesce-Rodriguez et al. estimated the enthalpy 
of sublimation of LLM-105 to be 163.8 kJ ­mol−1 [27]. In 
comparison, the experimental result 163.8 kJ ­mol−1 for the 
enthalpy of sublimation is higher than those theoretical 
predictions (114.7–135.6 kJ ­mol−1).
Uncovering the kinetics of sublimation is crucial in both 
shelf life-time estimation and advanced manufacturing 
technologies, however, few experimental studies on the sub-
limation kinetics of LLM-105 have been reported. Assuming 
that the mass loss before the exothermic reaction of LLM-
105 at low heating rates (0.1, 0.35, and 1.0 °C ­min−1) is 
primarily caused by sublimation, the kinetic parameters of 
sublimation, apparent activation energy Ea and preexponen-
tial factor A, calculated from TG measurements by Weese 
et al. were 173.5 kJ ­mol−1 and 2.19 × ­1013 ­s−1, respectively 
[7]. Nevertheless, remarkably, due to the high purge gas flow 
rate (100 ­cm3 ­min−1) used in the experiment, which affects 
the sublimation rate, this activation energy value would be 
slightly lower than the sublimation kinetic value of LLM-
105 stored in a closed cavity [30].
There is a gap between the existing results and the 
accepted values for the parameters, including vapor pres-
sures, enthalpies of sublimation, and sublimation kinetics, 
of LLM-105. Since the accuracy of the above parameters is 
doubtful, accurate methods, such as the effusion method, are 
recommended for the measurement of the low vapor pres-
sures of LLM-105, and further investigations are required to 
gain insight into the sublimation process of LLM-105 [31].
Phase transition
An explosive that has more than one kind of crystal struc-
tures might change its phase into another along with the 
change in ambient environments. Most of these transitions 
are induced by changing temperature and/or loading com-
pressions. Understanding the phase transition process is 
useful from the viewpoint of the safety and performance of 
explosives and their formulations.
The relationship between temperature/pressure and phase 
transition of LLM-105 is shown in Fig. 2. At ambient pres-
sure, there is no phase transition behavior for LLM-105 
from 5 to 513 K [11, 13]. However, under high pressure, 
the structural transformation of LLM-105 has not yet been 
clearly understood.
Contradictory conclusions of the structural transformation 
of LLM-105 under high pressure existed in different theoreti-
cal calculations. Periodic first-principles calculations by Wu 
et al. showed that crystalline LLM-105 undergoes four struc-
tural transformations at 8, 17, 25, and 42 GPa, respectively 
[32]. Zong et al. also predicted a sudden change in the lattice 
parameters at ~ 30 GPa with a first-principles method based 
on DFT, which means a phase transition of LLM-105 at the 
hydrostatic pressure of ~ 30 GPa [33]. However, Manaa et al. 
did not find evidence for structural phase transitions of LLM-
105 under hydrostatic compression of up to 45 GPa during 
the accurate determination of the unreacted equation of state 
(EOS) [29].
By using hydrothermal diamond anvil cells, Gump et al. 
investigated the isothermal equations of state of LLM-105 at 
static high-pressure and temperature, and the experimental

results showed that no phase change was evident up to the ~ 5 
GPa at ambient temperature, 373 K, and 453 K [11]. Besides, 
Stavrou et al.also found that the ambient pressure phase of 
LLM-105 remained stable up to 20 GPa through refinements 
of measured synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction patterns, 
which was consistent with the ambient temperature isothermal 
equation of state that was determined by ambient temperature 
isobaric-isothermal atomistic molecular dynamics simulations 
[34]. As the pressure increased, there was experimental evi-
dence for a new phase of LLM-105, the band gap of LLM-
105 crystal showed a sudden attenuation at 26.5 GPa, which 
indicated a first-order phase transition occurred [35]. The 
pressure-dependent Raman and infrared spectra under room 
temperature also proved that one structural phase transition of 
LLM-105 occurred at about 30 GPa, and this pressure value 
agreed with the predicted phase transition point in Zong’s 
work [13, 33]. Accurate determination of the high-pressure 
phase transition is necessary for the macroscopic simulations 
of the shock wave initiation of explosive materials. Although 
the high-pressure phase transition is evidenced, the detailed 
information about the phase behavior, including the phase 
structure and phase transition kinetics, is far from being clear.
Thermal decomposition
Thermal decomposition kinetics
As a typical thermal stable explosive, LLM-105 has an 
onset temperature of 615 K for decomposition at a lin-
ear heating rate of 10 K ­min−1 [3]. Its kinetic parameters, 
including the activation energy, the pre-exponential fac-
tor, and the reaction model have been repeatedly reported. 
As the thermal decomposition of LLM-105 exhibited a 
complex global kinetic behavior and was affected by many 
factors, such as crystal size, morphology, and the sublima-
tion process, the kinetic analyses in these reports produced 
dissimilar results.
The apparent activation energy of the thermal decompo-
sition of LLM-105 varied widely in different reports. The 
activation energy of LLM-105 thermal decomposition that 
was first reported by Weese et al. was 250 kJ ­mol−1[7]. Iso-
conversional method and differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) data at linear heating rates were used for this acti-
vation energy estimation. The isoconversional method was 
also employed by Zhao et al.for the analysis of the TG data 
at different heating rates (2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 K ­min−1), 
and the apparent activation energy Ea and the pre-exponen-
tial factor A were 154.41 kJ ­mol−1 and ­1011.22 ­s−1, respec-
tively; besides, the kinetic model for the decomposition 
reaction of LLM-105 was f(α) = (1-α)0.71 [36]. In addition, 
the kinetic parameters of LLM-105 obtained by Dong et al.
were Ea = 305.60 kJ ­mol−1, A = 1.99 × ­1022 ­s−1, and the 
kinetic model function in differential form was f(α) = 2(1-
α)1/2 [37]. The apparent activation energy calculated by 
Wang et al.was Ea = 257.5 kJ ­mol−1, and the pre-exponen-
tial factor was A = 3.3 × ­1019 ­s−1 [38]. The Ea value that 
determined by Zhou et al.was 287.2 kJ ­mol−1 [39].
The appearance of two peaks (or a peak with one shoul-
der) in the DSC curve at a slow heating rate signals that 
the decomposition process of LLM-105 is not a single step 
but comprises at least two steps. As almost all the kinetic 
parameters reported in the literature were determined 
based on the single-step reaction hypothesis, the deviation 
between these calculated parameters and the “true” kinetic 
parameters was inevitable. Thus, a two-step kinetic model 
should be used as a starting point in an analysis of the 
overall kinetics of the decomposition process of LLM-105. 
In our previous work, the thermal decomposition process 
of LLM-105 was first successfully deconvoluted into two 
reaction steps using simultaneously recorded TG–DSC 
curves by considering the different physical meanings of 
the kinetic data derived from TG and DSC by P value 
analysis [40]. The kinetic parameters of the two individual 
reaction steps were then characterized through isoconver-
sional and combined kinetic analysis methods. The results 
showed that the activation energy of the first reaction step 
was 222.2 ± 0.5 kJ ­mol−1, whereas that of the second reac-
tion step was 244.5 ± 0.5 kJ ­mol−1. The validity of the 
obtained kinetic parameters was tested by the successful 
reconstruction of the original experimental curves. Both 
steps mostly obeyed the nucleation and growth models 
(Avrami − Erofeev (A3)), which was confirmed through 
the observations of LLM-105 particle morphology evo-
lution at different decomposition depths. These two-step 
kinetic parameters are considered more appropriate to 
describe the thermal decomposition process of LLM-105.

Due to its structure and stability, the thermal decomposition 
of LLM-105 would be likely to undergo several steps to 
break down its ring and hydrogen bonding. Several path-
ways to initiate the primary molecular fission, including the 
H transfer from amino group to acyl O, the H transfer from 
amino group to nitro O, the C-NO2 partition, the O parti-
tion from N-oxide, the O partition from -NO2, and the nitro-
nitrite rearrangement, have been proposed based on quantum 
chemical computations (Fig. 3) [18, 41–43]. Although both 
intra- and intermolecular H transfer were referred in these 
reports, intermolecular H transfer is ignored in Fig. 3 for 
simplification. Among these pathways, the H transfer and 
the C-NO2 partition are the dominant steps that govern the 
initial reaction process, which is also evidenced by the evo-
lution monitoring of the molecular structure of LLM-105 
in real-time by using a multi-channel in-situ infrared spec-
troscopy [44]. Besides, the proportion of these pathways is 
strongly temperature-dependent. The hydrogen transfer was 
considered as the primary initial step at relatively low tem-
peratures, while the C-NO2 bond homolysis was the domi-
nant step that triggered the decomposition of LLM-105 at 
high temperatures [41–43].
With the bond breaking and rearrangement, small volatile 
compounds and solid products were generated during the 
thermal decomposition process of LLM-105. Infrared and 
mass spectral analysis of the volatile compounds revealed 
that the main gaseous products were ­CO2, HCN, ­C2N2, ­H2O, 
­N2, NO, and ­NO2 [46]. Similar to the DSC curves, the evolu-
tion of the volatile products showed two stages during the 
entire decomposition process. NO and ­C2N2 were mainly 
generated in the second stage of thermal decomposition, 
whereas the other gases were produced during the whole 
decomposition process. Besides, the generation of ­NH3 and 
­N2O was also identified by Xiao et al. with two-dimensional 
correlation infrared spectroscopy [46, 47].
The thermal decomposition process of LLM-105 can be 
treated as a two-step consecutive reaction based on the analy-
sis of the decomposition products. Through the Raman spec-
tra of LLM-105 at different decomposition degrees, it can 
be found that the group intensities of C–NO2, C–NH2, and 
N-oxide gradually decreased to zero in the first reaction step, 
followed by the fission of the pyrazine ring, which implies 
that the initial bond breaking of LLM-105 molecules mainly 
occurred in the first step throughout the whole reaction pro-
cess [46]. Clusters with different structures were formed 
during the thermal decomposition process through diverse 
linkages, such as C–O–N–C and C–N–N–C. The larger the 
cluster, the more likely it is to have a broken carbon–nitrogen 
ring [45]. Ingredient analysis using liquid chromatography 
coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry showed the 
production of 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine (ANPZ) as an 
intermediate at the beginning of the decomposition, which 
indicated the occurrence of consecutive reaction[48]. The 
first-step reaction dominated the early stage of the LLM-
105 decomposition, and its products were involved in the 
reaction of the second step. Since some products in the first

stage were only converted into the final products after the 
reactions in the second stage, the reactants of the first reac-
tion stage decreased as the decomposition degree increased, 
while the products (i.e., the reactants of the second reaction 
stage) were unaffected by the early decomposition reaction 
of LLM-105. Therefore, the DSC exothermic peak in the 
first stage gradually weakened and disappeared completely 
as the decomposition depth increased, with only one exo-
thermic peak presented for LLM-105 at high decomposition 
degree.
With the bond breaking and the generation of volatile 
compounds, the constituent elements in LLM-105 are con-
stantly being depleted. The consumption rate of these ele-
ments exhibited two stages accordingly. In the first decom-
position stage, O elements had the highest consumption 
rate, followed by N elements, while the C elements showed 
the slowest consumption rate. In the second decomposi-
tion stage, the orders of elemental consumption rate were 
C > O > N. The intermediate products usually had a low 
oxygen content due to the element consumption rate, while 
the amorphous residue was mainly composed of C and N 
elements. Because of the low oxygen content of the interme-
diates, it could not provide sufficient oxidative ability in the 
second stages of decomposition, resulting in the production 
of NO and ­C2N2 and the consumption of oxygen in the sur-
rounding environment. The insufficient oxidation of reac-
tants also led to the lower exothermicity in the second stage 
owing to the lack of sufficient oxygen to participate in the 
reaction. The difference in the ability to oxidize the carbon 
backbone of the two reaction steps resulted in the overlap-
ping exothermic peaks in the DSC curve of LLM-105.
Factors affecting the thermal decomposition
The thermal decomposition of LLM-105 is affected by 
many factors that can be divided into three categories. The 
first is environmental factors. Temperature, pressure, heat-
ing rate, and atmosphere are always the factors affecting 
the decomposition of solid explosives. Besides, the shape, 
size, sealing ability, as well as the materials of the crucible 
also have an influence on the decomposition process, which 
has been confirmed many times on a variety of systems and 
samples. So far, the effects of temperature, heating rate, and 
sealing ability on the thermal decomposition of LLM-105 
have been presented in different reports [7, 40, 48]. Other 
environmental factors, despite no experimental basis, can 
also be inferred to affect its decomposition process to some 
extent according to the decomposition kinetics and mecha-
nism of LLM-105.
The second type of influencing factor is directly related to 
the LLM-105 crystals, including the crystal size, the crystal 
morphology, and the crystal defects. The smaller grains usu-
ally have lower thermal decomposition temperatures, and the 
crystal defects would also make LLM-105 more prone to 
decompose. For example, compared with the raw materials 
of hundreds of microns, the sub-micron LLM-105 particles 
fabricated by electrospray deposition and green ball milling 
have lower onset degradation temperature and exothermic 
peak [49–52]. Low-dimensional defects randomly distrib-
uted in crystals would result in the premature decomposition 
of LLM-105 [48]. The change of crystal morphology may 
also affect the thermal decomposition of LLM-105. It was 
found that the exothermic peak of LLM-105 nanotubes pre-
pared by Chen et al. shifted to a lower temperature by about 
22 K in comparison with the irregular LLM-105 raw mate-
rial [53]. In the report of Pu et al., the rectangular micro-
rod crystal exhibits better thermal stability than the X-like 
and plate-like LLM-105 crystals [54]. The effect of crystal 
size on thermal decomposition is attributed to the change of 
crystal surface energy. And the crystal defects would reduce 
the reaction energy barrier by increasing the internal energy 
and then facilitate the decomposition. However, till now, it is 
still a challenging task to understand the regularity between 
crystal morphology and thermal decomposition.
The contact materials, such as the formulation ingredients 
and unexpected impurities, constitute the third type of fac-
tor that affects the thermal decomposition of LLM-105.The 
contact materials would affect the decomposition process of 
LLM-105 in a variety of ways. For example, the exothermic 
process of HMX, 3,4-dinitrofurazanfuroxan (DNTF), hex-
anitrohexazaisowurtzitane (CL-20), nitrocellulose/glycidyl 
azide polymer (NC/GAP), and graphene oxide can result in 
the lower decomposition temperature of LLM-105 [55–57]; 
the catalysis effect of nano-aluminum particles can also 
promote the decomposition of LLM-105 [58]. However, it 
should be noted that not all contact materials would signifi-
cantly change the decomposition temperature of LLM-105. 
For instance, the Tp change (− 0.52 °C) between LLM-105 
and its mixture with 1,1-diamino-2,2-dinitroethene (FOX-7) 
was negligible; the thermal behavior of LLM-105 after mod-
ifying by polydopamine (PDA) and hyperbranched polymers 
(HBP) also hardly changed [59, 60]. As the peak temperature 
change (∆Tp) of LLM-105 is one of the indicators to evaluate 
the compatibility between LLM-105 and the contact mate-
rial, the negligible Tp change indicates that FOX-7 has little 
effect on the decomposition process of LLM-105 and the 
binary system LLM-105/FOX-7 is compatible.
These three kinds of influencing factors have a super-
imposition effect on the thermal decomposition process of 
LLM-105. For example, under adiabatic heating conditions, 
LLM-105 showed an exothermic behavior different from 
that under linear heating conditions. After coating with a 
small amount of PDA, the thermal decomposition process of 
LLM-105 under adiabatic conditions further changed [61]. 
Since it may vary with environmental conditions, LLM-
105 crystals, and contact materials, the effect of influencing 

12972

factors should be considered when studying or predicting the 
thermal decomposition process of LLM-105.
Summary and prospect
LLM-105 possesses an excellent equilibrium between high 
energy and low sensitivity. Many efforts have been made 
to investigate its physical and chemical response to ther-
mal stimuli to promote its practical application, and fruitful 
results have been reported. It was found that the thermal 
expansion of LLM-105 crystal shows highly anisotropic 
with an average CTE αV of 1.49 × ­10−4 ­K−1 from 160 to 
360 K, and the specific heat capacity Cp of LLM-105, 
which increases with temperature, is about 1.005 J ­g−1 ­K−1 
at 298 K. At ambient pressure, LLM-105 shows obvious 
sublimation at temperatures higher than 493 K but under-
goes no structural transformations from 5 K to its thermal 
decomposition temperature (533 K). The thermal decom-
position process of LLM-105, which can be deconvoluted 
into two consecutive reaction steps, obeys the nucleation 
and growth models. And the C–NO2 bond homolysis is the 
dominant step that triggered the decomposition of LLM-105. 
The above cognition is very meaningful for the safety predic-
tion and reliable applications of LLM-105 during process-
ing, transportation, storage, and use. Nevertheless, there are 
still some gaps in our present understanding of the thermo-
physical and thermochemical characteristics of LLM-105 
in response to thermal stimuli. Some challenging problems 
that should be addressed in future research are listed below:
(1)	 There is short of unified measurement parameters 
for the temperature-dependent physical properties of 
LLM-105. Not only the measurement results of thermal 
expansion coefficient and specific heat capacity dem-
onstrated minor differences between reports, but also 
the literature coverage on the thermal conductivity of 
LLM-105 explosive is lacking, which would have an 
adverse impact on the formulation design and safety 
evaluation of LLM-105.
(2)	 High-pressure phase behavior of LLM-105, which is 
important for the prediction of detonation pressure, 
requires further study. Future research on the high-
pressure phase behavior of LLM-105 in a wide tem-
perature range need be carried out to enrich the phase 
change knowledge. Besides, it is necessary to confirm 
the high-pressure phase structure of LLM-105 as well 
as its high-pressure phase performance.
(3)	 A more detailed study of the effect of crystal charac-
teristics on the thermal decomposition of LLM-105 
should be conducted. Similar to the relationships 
between the crystal characteristics and the sensitivity, 
which are complex and show some abnormal phenom-
ena [62], the correlation between the crystal charac-
teristics and thermal decomposition of LLM-105 has 
long puzzled researchers. Strengthening the research on 
the thermal decomposition characteristics of different 
crystal faces and defect types of LLM-105 would be the 
key to reveal the potential mechanism.
