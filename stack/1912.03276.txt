Abstract
We study the real time formation of the ground state of two coupled SYK models. This is
a highly entangled state which is close to the thermoﬁeld double state and can be viewed as a
wormhole. We start from a high temperature state, we let it cool by coupling to a cold bath.
We numerically solve for the large N dynamics. Our main result is that the system forms a
wormhole by going through a region with negative speciﬁc heat, taking time that is independent
of N. The dynamics is smooth everywhere and it seems to follow the equilibrium thermodynamic
conﬁgurations of the microcanonical ensemble. Also we comment on the relation between this
coupled SYK model and Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity theory with bulk ﬁelds.

Introduction and Summary
1.1
Motivation
The Sachdev–Ye–Kitaev (SYK) model [1, 2, 3, 4] is a strongly interacting but yet solvable model
in the large N limit. At low energies, it displays an approximate conformal symmetry. In this
region, the model has many features in common with nearly AdS2 gravity, or Jackiw-Teitelboim
(JT) gravity [5, 6, 7], coupled to matter ﬁelds. This is a simple two dimensional theory of gravity
which describes some aspects of nearly extremal black holes in various dimensions.
An interesting variant is to consider a pair of identical SYK models coupled through a simple
bilinear interaction [8], see also [9, 10, 11].
The ground state of this model has a gap, but
its excitation spectrum also displays an approximate conformal symmetry. Furthermore, this
ground state is close to the thermoﬁeld double state of two decoupled models. For reasons we
explain below, we call the ground state of this coupled model “the SYK wormhole”.
A conceptually similar state also arises when one considers two nearly extremal black holes
that are relatively close, so that they are coupled. In this case, a traversable wormhole can
connect the near extremal throats [12].
This can be eﬀectively modeled by a nearly AdS2
gravity theory where we have direct interactions between the values of the bulk ﬁelds near the
two boundaries [13, 8]. In other words, thinking of the Penrose diagram of AdS2 as a strip, we put
boundary conditions for the bulk ﬁelds that connect the two boundaries. The two boundaries
are causally connected through the bulk, so that this spacetime describes a wormhole. This
wormhole is the lowest energy conﬁguration of the system and it also displays the approximate
SL(2, R) isometries of nearly AdS2.
Given that this is a remarkable state, we are interested in knowing whether it is easy to get
to it. In other words, if we start out from a general excited state of the coupled model, can
we easily get to the ground state by cooling the system down? Or will the system get stuck in
some other state? At ﬁrst sight the answer seems straightforward, if it is the ground state, the
system will surely ﬁnd it if it can shed its excess energy to the bath. On the other hand, from
the gravity perspective, the process involves a topology change. Such topology change might
happen via a tunneling solution, but it would be exponentially suppressed in N (or the entropy
of each separate black hole).
1.2
Wormhole formation in SYK
With this motivation in mind, we study this problem for the two coupled SYK models. We
start with a relatively high temperature state of the coupled model which looks like two thermal
density matrices, one for each SYK factor. Then we couple the system to a bath and study
the evolution in real time by solving the large N Schwinger-Dyson equations. We ﬁnd that
the system indeed ﬁnds the “SYK wormhole” ground state in a time that is independent of
N. In particular, there is no exponential suppression. Notice that the ability to eﬃciently ﬁnd
this ground state also makes it possible to prepare the thermoﬁeld double (TFD) state of the
decoupled model, by simply switching oﬀthe interaction between the two sides [8], after we have
found the ground state.
The approach we used is the following. The large N Dyson–Schwinger equations form a closed
system for the two-point function [1, 2, 3, 4]. In the out-of-equilibrium situation that we are
considering, these equations are commonly referred to as the Kadanoﬀ–Baym (KB) equations.
We couple the system of two interacting SYK models to a large bath and ﬁnd the real time
dynamics using KB equations. The problem of coupling SYK to a bath was recently studied in
[14] and we borrow some results from there. Also, the KB equations for a single SYK was recently
studied numerically in [15, 16]. Here we study this problem solving the dynamical equations at
q = 4. The problem has many time scales and due to numerical limitations we could not separate
them all by large amounts. However, our numerical results seem to conﬁrm the picture where
the system follows the microcanonical equilibrium curve. We now brieﬂy review this equilibrium
thermodynamics.

1.3
Equilibrium thermodynamics
In the canonical ensemble the system has two phases: the low temperature one corresponding
to the ground state, the SYK wormhole, and its excitations; and a higher temperature phase
which is closer to two separate thermal SYK systems. The two phases are separated by a ﬁrst
order phase transition. In the large q limit, the black hole phase and the wormhole phase are
smoothly connected by a canonically unstable phase with negative speciﬁc heat [8]. However,
in the microcanonical ensemble, we expect that the system smoothly interpolates between these
two phases. In other words, in the microcanonical ensemble we expect no phase transition as we
lower the energy.

Figure 1: Dots: energy vs beta obtained by numerically solving DS equations for two
coupled SYK models with J = 0.5, µ = 0.0053. Blue dots correspond to the “two black
holes phase”, whereas green dots correspond to the “cold wormhole phase”. Red dashed
line: curve for the “hot wormhole” phase expected from a low energy analytic analysis. The
question mark “?” reminds us that we were not able to ﬁnd it as a solution of the euclidean
DS equations.
Figure 1 shows energy vs inverse temperature β for q = 4. We use energy instead of free
energy or entropy because we will be dealing mostly with Lorentzian non-equilibrium correlators
numerically and it is easier to ﬁnd the temperature and the energy from them. There are three
diﬀerent regions. At high temperatures T > T2BH we have the phase we name the “two black
holes phase”. At low temperatures T < TWH we have the phase we call “cold wormhole” phase,
which can be viewed a as a wormhole with few thermal excitations. The two phases overlap,
since T2BH < TWH. In the intermediate temperatures regime T2BH < T < TWH we also expect a
canonically unstable, but microcanonically stable, phase that we call “the hot wormhole phase”.
As we mentioned above, this phase can be found analytically in the large q limit. It has positive
entropy but negative speciﬁc heat. However, at ﬁnite q we do not known much about this phase,
since we have been unable to ﬁnd it by solving the Euclidean Schwinger Dyson equations. We
interpret this failure as resulting from its canonical instability. This is why we put a question
mark in Figure 1. We will ﬁnd evidence for this phase through the real time evolution, since
we will ﬁnd that the temperature goes up as the energy monotonically goes down. There is
4

also analytic evidence from a low energy analysis, as we will review later. The names “hot”
or “cold” wormhole refer to how these would feel to an observer who is inside the wormhole,
at its center, in a gravity picture for these conﬁgurations. As is clear from Figure 1, there are
outside temperatures where we can have both a “cold” and “hot” wormhole. When we talk
about temperatures in this paper, we are always referring to the physical temperature as seen
from the outside.
Figure 1 also displays the critical temperature, Tc, when two stable phases switch dominance
in the canonical ensemble. For T2BH < T < Tc two black hole phase is thermodynamically
metastable but is not a global minimum for the free energy. Similarly for Tc < T < TWH and
the cold wormhole phase. For our problem the microcanonical ensemble is more relevant. Notice
that the diﬀerent “phases” are continuously connected in the microcanonical ensemble, so they
are not really sharply separated phases.
For small values of µ, the coupling between the two SYK models, we can make diﬀerent
analytic approximations for the diﬀerent parts of the curve. For the two black hole region we
can start with two separate thermal SYK models and use perturbation theory in µ. In this
regime, the left-right correlator GLR is small and of order µ. The gravity picture is that we have
two separate hyperbolic disks with a boundary perturbation that connects the bulk ﬁelds on the
two disks. We ﬁnd that T2BH is in the region where this perturbation theory breaks down. For
low temperatures the left-right correlator is of order one. We can access this regime by assuming
that the system is close to the thermoﬁeld double state. The relevant part of the dynamics is
captured by the Schwarzian mode. This aspect of the dynamics is the same for the SYK model
and the nearly-AdS2 gravity theory [17, 18, 19]. This describes both the cold wormhole and
hot wormhole phases. In particular, we can see the existence of the hot wormhole phase in this
approximation [8]. In particular, the temperature TWH can be found within this approximation.
We review this description in Section 2.3.
1.4
Gravity picture
One of our motivations was to understand whether a similar wormhole formation process occurs
in more general theories of nearly-AdS2 gravity with matter.
With this goal in mind we will present a gravity picture for the transition we have in the
SYK model. We do not know the precise gravity dual of the SYK model. But we consider a
nearly-AdS2 gravity theory that has some of the same features. For questions that mainly involve
the Schwarzian mode, the SYK and nearly-AdS2 answers match precisely [17, 18, 19]. However,
wormhole formation goes slightly beyond this approximation, and we need to incorporate one
important feature that is related to the origin of the ground state entropy, or “zero temperature”
entropy, S0, of the SYK model. If we start from a phase consisting of two thermal states, then
the entropy will have a large contribution of size 2S0 (plus thermal corrections). As the wormhole
forms, the system should be able to shed this large entropy into the bath. In gravity this involves
topology change, which would naively be exponentially suppressed. On the other hand, as we
discussed above, this happens without any such suppression in SYK.
We can reproduce this from a gravity picture as follows.
First we view the two coupled
systems as a nearly-AdS2 gravity theory with N bulk fermion ﬁelds with Neumann boundary
conditions. The two black hole phase consists of two hyperbolic disks with an interaction between
the boundary values of the bulk ﬁelds. As we lower the temperature, this interaction eﬀectively
becomes strong and the theory ﬂows to a new IR ﬁxed point. The new ﬁxed point is simply a
theory with diﬀerent boundary conditions, namely Dirichlet boundary conditions. This change
in boundary conditions is similar to the one discussed in [20]. The two disks decouple again
but the boundary conditions are eﬀectively changed from Neumann to Dirichlet. Now we use
the observation in [21], that eS0 is equal to the ratio of the Neumann vs Dirichlet disk partition
functions for N fermions. This means that the eﬀective theory in the IR, with Dirichlet boundary
condition has now Seff
0
= 0. This means that topology change “costs us nothing”, and we can
easily transition into the wormhole phase. In fact, by a similar argument we can say that the
end of the hot wormhole phase also corresponds to the region where the interactions between
5

the two sides of the global AdS2 strip produce a ﬂow that change the boundary conditions of
the fermions from Neumann to Dirichlet.
In summary, we provide a qualitative gravity mechanism for the formation of the SYK worm-
hole. The purpose of this explanation was to contrast SYK with what we expect in a generic
gravity theory. A generic gravity theory can have a number of ﬁelds much smaller than S0. In
this case, the change in boundary conditions would not signiﬁcantly change S0 and it would still
be diﬃcult to change the topology. For this reason we could not answer the question of whether
there is an “easy way” of forming the wormhole for more general gravity theories, such as the
case of four dimensional magnetically charged wormholes in the Standard Model [12].
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the two coupled SYK model [8].
We describe the perturbative approach at high temperatures, for the “two black hole phase”.
We also review the Schwarzian description of the low energy dynamics that describes the hot
and cold wormhole phases. Section 3 contains our real time analysis of the formation of the
wormhole. We set up the coupling to the bath, we write the Kadanoﬀ-Baym equations (the real
time Schwinger Dyson equations), and we present the result of a numerical analysis for some
particular values of the parameters. In section 4, we discuss diﬀerences and similarities between
SYK and nearly-AdS2 (or JT) gravity and also provide the qualitative picture of the transition.
Various computational details are discussed in the appendices.

The two coupled SYK model and its thermodynamics
2.1
Deﬁnition and properties of the ground state
Here we review properties of the two coupled SYK models introduced in [8]. The Hamiltonian
of the model consists of two SYK terms coupled by an interaction

There is also a generalization where we consider a q fermion interaction term, instead of four.
The interaction term has the form

In the large N limit, µ and J stay ﬁxed. We will mostly consider the case µ/J ≪1 and also
consider temperatures T/J ≪1. This will be true even for what we call “high” temperatures.
As an aside, let us mention that we can couple the two systems by an operator of dimension
∆
H∆
int = iF µ(O∆)L(O∆)R
(5)
where F is the fermion number of O∆. We will mostly consider the case of (4) which corresponds
to ∆= 1/4 at low energies. However, we will give certain estimates for generic ∆.
Like a single SYK, this model, (1), is solvable in the large N limit. We have four types of
correlators: GLL, GRR, GLR, GRL, each deﬁned in Euclidean space as
Gab(τ) = ⟨Tψa(τ)ψb(0)⟩,
with
a, b = L, R
(6)
6

Since we are dealing with Majorana fermions we have
GLL(0+) = GRR(0+) = 1

(7)
We have a closed system of Dyson–Schwinger equations for the two point functions [8]

(10)
The system has a Z4 symmetry ψL →−ψR, ψR →ψL. Throughout our numerical computation
we do not assume that this symmetry in unbroken.
We ﬁnd that it is unbroken, since the
(Euclidean) correlators we obtained obey the following relations:
GLL = GRR pure real ,
GLR = −GRL pure imaginary

(12)
The interaction term (4) is a relevant perturbation, since for a single SYK model the fermion
ψ has dimension ∆= 1/4. Therefore at relatively high temperatures we expect that we have
two weakly coupled SYK models, whereas at low temperatures the system ﬂows into a gapped
phase with a gap that scales as [8]
Egap ∝µ2/3J1/3 ,
for
µ
J ≪1, and q = 4, ∆= 1

(13)
Moreover the ground state is close to the TFD of the two models with eﬀective (inverse) tem-

The energy of the ground state, relative to the energy of the two decoupled SYK models, scales
as

(15)
And for general ∆, EG −2E0,SYK ∝−µ

Since there is a gap and the ground state is unique, the entropy is small in the “cold wormhole
phase”. Whereas in the two black hole phase, we have a big entropy 2S0, where S0 ≈N × 0.23
is the “zero temperature” entropy of a single SYK model. The transition temperature Tc is

For arbitrary temperatures the Dyson-Schwinger equations can be solved numerically by
starting from GLR = GRL = 0, GLL = GRR = 1
2 and then using an iteration procedure similar
to one described in [3]. After obtaining the solution for some value of temperature, we can use
it as a seed for the iteration procedure at higher/lower temperature. Figure 1 shows energy as
a function of beta for particular values of parameters J = 0.5, µ = 0.0053.

2.2
Perturbation theory at high temperature
Here we use the term “high” temperatures for temperatures for the two black hole branch of the
diagram T ≫T2BH, but still T/J ≪1.
For µ = 0 we have two copies of the conventional SYK correlators [1, 2]
G(τ)LL = G(τ)RR = b sgn(τ)

GLR = 0
(17)
with b4 = 1/(4π).
Now we turn on a small value of µ (4). If we are at suﬃciently high temperature then the
coupled system is still in the phase with two separate black holes [8]. Nonetheless, the correlation
between left- and right- SYK is not zero. We can try to use the conformal perturbation theory
to study the system.
To linear order in µ, only GLR Green functions receive a correction:
∆GLR(τ1 −τ2) = iµ
Z β
0
dτ GLL(τ1 −τ)GRR(τ −τ2)
(18)
This integral is computed analytically in Appendix A. We can compare this leading order approx-
imation against exact numerical solution of the Dyson–Schwinger equation for J = 0.5, µ = 0.05
and diﬀerent βs, see Figure 2.

Also in Appendix A we computed the µ2 correction to the energy. So that at low temperatures

where ESYK is the low-temperature result for a single SYK [3] and ∆E is the leading µ2 correction

6(b).

This approximation works better for high temperatures and then deteriorates close to T2BH,
where the phase is supposed to connect with the hot wormhole phase.
Let us ﬁnd out until what temperature we can trust the perturbation series in µ, (4). The
ﬁrst point is that only even terms are non-zero. The term of order µ2n contains a 2n-point func-
tion on the left and 2n-point function on the right, each of these now computed in a single SYK
model. We are only interested in connected correlators for computing the corrections to the free
energy. Higher point functions in SYK have two contributions: a purely conformal piece which
is independent of β, up to an overall factor of
 1/√Jβ
4n as in (17), plus contributions from the
Schwarzian which are enhanced by an extra factor of βJ. We claim that the Schwarzian contri-
butions are in fact zero, see Appendix B. The reason behind this cancellation is the following.
When we work at large N we are solving the classical equations. The reparametrization mode
has a solution that is time translation invariant. The two sides are coupled by convolutions of
Green’s functions but this translation symmetry remains unbroken. This means that there is
no source for higher Fourier components of the reparametrization mode, so that the standard
thermal solution continues to be a solution.
The integrals over time give β2n. In total, we have µ2nβ2n
(Jβ)n . So the expansion parameter is
µβ
√Jβ ,
for q = 4 ,
or
µβ
(Jβ)2∆,
for general q
(22)
So we can trust the above perturbative answer until temperature
Tpert ∝J
µ

(23)
For ∆= 1/4 this scales as µ2, whereas Tc ∝µ4/3 is much larger.
We conjecture that the transition temperature T2BH, when the two black holes phase cease
to exist, in fact coincides with Tpert, when the perturbation theory in µ breaks down
T2BH ∼Tpert ∝J
µ

We check this prediction for ∆= 1/4 against the numerical phase diagram obtained in [8]. See
Figures 3, 5.
One last comment on the leading result (18). In Appendix B, we studied the gravitational
dressing of this term, searched for instabilities that would spontaneously break the U(1) time
translation symmetry, but did not ﬁnd any.
2.3
Low temperature thermodynamics using the Schwarzian
In this section we review the results of [8] on the Schwarzian description of the wormhole. We
will see that the Schwarzian indeed admits a wormhole solution at low temperatures. Moreover,
by including the matter contribution to the partition function one is able to see two phases
which join at (inverse) temperature βWH. One phase has positive heat capacity and almost zero
entropy. This is a cold and mostly empty wormhole. The second phase has higher energy longer
throat and negative heat capacity. This is wormhole with extra matter excitations inside. We
will see shortly that at small enough µ this approximation predicts βWH with good accuracy.
As we have mentioned before, the ground state of the system is close to the TFD state. Since
we have global AdS2 we have the following GLR correlator in Euclidean signature:

This equation has a solution with very small t′ which we can not trust, because we were
assuming that the temperatures are low. For large enough β two additional solutions emerge.
One of them correspond to what we call the cold wormhole and the other to the hot wormhole.
The latter has negative heat capacity and can be viewed as a wormhole with more excitations in
the throat. Figure 6 shows the two branches for two diﬀerent values of µ/J and their comparison
to the numerical solution to the DS equations.
We can calculate TWH from this equation. We simply need to ﬁnd when these two solutions
merge. To keep the discussion general, we consider general ∆, which corresponds to the case
when the two sides are coupled through the product of two operators of dimension ∆. The

solution of the DS equation. For the value µ = 0.05, which is the one we will use for the real
time numerical computation, the agreement is not very good, but the qualitative form of the

Real time results
3.1
Coupling to a bath
In order to study the real-time formation of the wormhole, we need to cool down the system.
Before considering real-time dynamics, ﬁrst we need to understand how to couple our system to
a thermal bath. Ideally we want the bath to be a large system in order to avoid back-reaction.
bWhen computing the derivatives one has to keep in mind that t′ is a function of β. And use (32).
12

Generally, we can couple a system’s operator OS to a bath operator OB:
∆S = iF V
Z
dτ OSOB
(39)
where F is the fermionic number of OS.
If V is small and the bath is large we can study this interaction in the Lindblandian approxi-
mation by considering the 1-loop result and assuming that there is no back reaction on the bath,
such that we can substitute the product OB(t1)OB(t2) by VEV ⟨OB(t1)OB(t2)⟩B:
∆S = −V 2
Z
dτ1dτ2 OS(τ1)OS(τ2)⟨OB(τ1)OB(τ2)⟩B
(40)
For our problem we have a varying temperature that sets an energy scale for the model.
Specially for our numerical analysis, it is convenient to choose an interaction that is scale invariant
(at least approximately), so that the eﬀects of coupling to the bath are independent of the
temperature. Otherwise the bath might be eﬀectively decoupling in some temperature range
and the system would take long to cool down.
A natural model for the bath is another SYK, possibly with larger number of fermions.
We can consider the bath to be another single-SYK model with q = qB with large number of
fermions M, much larger than the number of fermions in our system N. Recently this problem
was studied in [14], we refer to this paper for details. If we denote the bath fermions by χα, then
the coupling can involve an arbitrary number s of system fermions and p bath fermions.
Again, to warm-up, let us ﬁrst consider the case when the system consists of a single-SYK
model. The coupling between the bath and the system has the form:
Lbath-system = V α1...αp
i1...is
ψi1 . . . ψisχα1 . . . χαp
(41)
where V is a random Gaussian-distibuted coupling. By choosing its variance appropriatly, the
back reaction can be made of order N/M ≪1. The Euclidean Dyson–Schwinger equations for
the system stay the same except for a correction to the self-energy: the self-energy acquires an
additional term,
∆Σ = ΣB = ηGp
BGs−1
(42)
where GB is bath two-point function and η is proportional to the variance of V .
We can get a marginal interaction with s = 1, p = 3, when the bath consists of q = 4 SYK
models (with, say JB = JS). This is the bath we will use. More precisely, we introduce two
separate baths, one for each SYK factor
Lbath-system = V α1α2α3
i
ψL,iχα1χα2χα3 + ˜V α1α2α3
i
ψR,i ˜χα1 ˜χα2 ˜χα3
(43)
where V and ˜V are independent Gaussian-distributed variables. This interaction leaves ΣLR
unperturbed, but the other two self-energies have additional terms now:
∆ΣLL = ∆ΣRR = ΣB = ηG3
B
(44)
The above equations are written in Euclidean signature. We now turn to Lorentzian equations.
3.2
Kadanoﬀ–Baym equations
We now write down the Lorentzian time version of the DS equations. For details see Appendix
C.
Here we will discuss the non-equilibrum situation following [3] and [15]. It is convenient to
work right away on the Keldysh time contour, see [22] for a comprehensive introduction. We
will need Lorentzian time correlators which are not time ordered.
This can be achieved by
introducing a Keldysh time contour which runs from −∞to +∞and then back from +∞to
+∞. First, one introduces a Wightman function
G>
ab(t−
1 , t+
2 ) = −i⟨ψa(t−
1 )ψb(t+
2 )⟩,
(45)
13

where t1, t2 lie on diﬀerent sides of the contour. This simply means that ψb(t2) is always located
to the right of ψa(t1) in the correlator, regardless of time-ordering. This is why the Keldysh
contour consists of two parts. Note the overall i in front of the correlator. Since we are dealing
with simple Majorana fermions the “lesser” function G<
ab is given by:
G<
ab(t1, t2) = −G>
ba(t2, t1)
(46)
Also we will need retarded and advanced Green functions:
GR
ab(t1, t2) = θ(t1 −t2)
 G>
ab(t1, t2) −G<
ab(t1, t2)

(47)
GA
ab(t1, t2) = θ(t2 −t1)
 G<
ab(t1, t2) −G>
ab(t1, t2)

Dyson–Schwinger equations written on the Keldysh contour are known as Kadanoﬀ–Baym equa-
tions, and are useful for non-equilibrium situations. Let us write them down explicitly for a
single SYK:
i∂t1G>(t1, t2) = Σ ∗G =
Z +∞
−∞
dt
 ΣR(t1, t)G>(t, t2) + Σ>(t1, t)GA(t, t2)

 GR(t1, t)Σ>(t, t2) + G>(t1, t)ΣA(t, t2)

(48)
where the self-energy Σ> is given by
Σ>(t1, t2) = −J2  G>(t1, t2)
3
(49)
These equations for the complete system of two interacting SYKs and a bath are derived using
the path integral in Appendix D.
Remember that the “greater” Green function G>(t−
1 , t+
2 ) has time arguments lying on diﬀer-
ent sides of the Keldysh contour, this is why we do not have a delta-function on the right hand
side of (48). The integral in the right hand side of (48), which involves diﬀerent Green functions,
is just a simple convolution Σ ∗G along the Keldysh contour [23]. We can show it by writing
the anti-time ordered Σ = Σ> −ΣR and the time ordered G = GA + G>. One can easily see
that equations (48) are casual.
Let us mention one subtlety. Strictly speaking, if one starts from a thermal state, then the
precise Keldysh contour involves imaginary time stip at the end of the lower branch, at t = 0.
This time strip has length β and prepares the thermal state. One can bypass this as follows.
First we set the coupling to the bath to zero. Then we ﬁnd the real time correlators at thermal
equilibrium by solving the real time equations imposing the appropriate relations between the
Green’s functions, see e.g. (100). We then evolve the system for some time t ≫β and then we
turn on the coupling to the bath. For more details see Appendix E.
For two coupled SYK models one has to be very careful with the µ term. To understand its
form on the Keldysh contour we can go back to G, Σ eﬀective action derived in Appendix D

We see that the µ contribution to Σ(t1, t2) is
∆Σab(t1, t2) = iµabδC(t1 −t2)
(51)
In this expression t1, t2 can be on either side of the Keldysh contour, this is why Σ does not have
an additional index, like >, R, A. Notice that the delta-function δC is deﬁned on the Keldysh
contour as well. It yields non-zero answer if and only if t1 = t2 and t1, t2 are on the same side

3.3
Forming the wormhole
Our numerical setup for solving KB equation (53),(54) is presented in Appendix E. We prepare
initial Lorentz Green’s functions using Lorentz-time Dyson–Schwinger equations described in
Appendix C. Our initial Green’s functions correspond to two interacting SYK models with non-
zero µ at thermal equilibrium. In order to save computational time, the initial temperature is
chosen close to (and slightly higher than) the transition temperature T2BH.
We extract the temperature using the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem(FDT) for the two-
point functions. Precisely, our numerical setup gives us the G> and G< Green’s functions. At
thermal equilibrium a certain combination of these Green’s functions (eq. (119)) must be equal
to tanh(βω/2) in the frequency domain. So we take the numerically obtained G> and G<, make
a discrete Fourier transform and ﬁt eq. (119) with the tanh. We refer to Appendix E for details
about the precise choice of the Green’s functions and the frequency domain for ﬁt.
Our benchmark parameters are J = JB = 0.5 (the system and the bath have the same
coupling strength), µ = 0.05. In this case, from Figure 3 we expect β2BH ∼61, βc ∼54, βWH ∼
49.
We considered a few values for the system-bath coupling, η = 0.04, 0.02, 0.01. Figure 7
shows the results for βbath = 80, η = 0.04, βinitial = 40 for diﬀerent time steps. The energy is
computed using eq. (118).
We can perform another check, this time taking η much smaller, namely η = 0.01. The result
is shown on Figure 8. A few comments are in order. As is explained in detail in [14] the marginal
system-bath interaction we will renormalize J, making it bigger. This is why expect that the
actual transition will happen at higher β. This is indeed what we see. Moreover, the interaction
with the bath will shift the ground state energy. To compensate for this we have shifted the
energy vs beta curve in Figure 8 to match the ﬁnal energy.
The red curve in Figure 8 has wild oscillations in temperature near the equilibrium for small
η, see also Figures 7(b). The reason is the following. Because of the numerical error there is an
additional ﬂux of energy which pushes the system out of equilibrium. From the phase diagram
(blue points) we see that the derivative dβ/dE is very large. If η is not big enough, the relaxation
time is not small enough to smooth out these ﬂuctuations.
The crucial question is whether we indeed have reached the wormhole phase or not.
In
principle, we might have ended up in some other phase. To verify that we have reached the
wormhole we can make a precise check of the system’s energy.
In the real-simulation the ﬁnal value of the energy is(in units where J = 0.5):
EKB = −0.05282(2)
(55)
where the uncertainty comes from changing the size of the diagonal strip and changing the
timestep. Also we can ask ourselves how carefully is the initial state prepared. For an exact

(a) The energy as a function of time. The initial rise is due to the fact that we are coupling
the bath to the system, and this changes the energy [14]. We then see the energy decreasing
monotonicallly. (b) The inverse temperature as a function of time. We also see an initial

two-point function we know that Gaa(0) = −0.5i. However, the iterations of the real-time DS
equations have Gaa(0) = −0.5002i. The error coming from this is esentially the same as in the
above number.
How do we compare this result with the equilibrium phase diagram? In fact, we can solve
Euclidean Dyson–Schwinger equation for the coupled system+bath and compare the equilibrium
energy. We start from the Euclidean correlators in the wormhole phase, add coupling to the bath
and solve the DS equations again. The value of the energy we obtained this way is(again in units
where J = 0.5):
EDS = −0.05276(3)
(56)
It is represented as green dot in Figure 8. The uncertainty is estimated by changing the number
of discretization points and imposing diﬀerent cutoﬀs for the iteration procedure. We see an
agreement with (55) within one standard deviation. This suggests that we indeed reached the
wormhole.
To understand what happens near the transition we can look at the maximum value of GLR,
see Figure 9 (lower part). We can notice that, during the transition through the unstable phase,
the imaginary value of the correlator (which is proportional to the anticommutator) rapidly
grows, indicating the growth in the information transmission rate.
Another thing we can see is that coupling to a bath generically thwarts the information
transmission between the sides; for larger bath coupling η the ratio Im GLR/ Re GLR is smaller.
Figure 8 shows that the system is more or less following the thermodynamic curve. We see
that the temperature and energy are smooth everywhere and the transition goes through a phase
with negative heat capacity, where the energy decreases and the temperature increases.
To check whether the system remains thermal at all times we performed an additional check.
Using the ﬂuctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) we can ﬁnd the temperature two ways: from LL

Figure 8: The comparison between E(β) in equilibrium(blue points) and the real-time

the coupling with the bath linearly in time. The dashed red line is the same as the solid

correlator and the LR correlator, using (119). The result is shown on Figure 9 (upper part). We
see that LL correlator is very close to thermal and the curve shows a clear period of temperature
increase. In contrast, the temperature extracted from the LR correlator has big errorbars. This
means that the LR correlator has larger deviations from precise thermality, and larger violations
to the relation (119). We think that this happens for the following reason. We couple each SYK
system to its own bath, so we have two uncorrelated baths. This introduces incoherence to the
system, which can be seen on Figure 9: GLR is decreases when we increase η. Moreover we are
in the regime of small µ, which means that the two sides interact weakly, so the equilibration
time for GLR is much bigger than for GLL. Therefore we expect that the error bars for LR
temperature are big because our system-bath coupling is too big. And, if we managed to cool
the system down more slowly, then the LR correlators would remain thermal. Unfortunately,
with our limited computer resources we could not go below η = 0.01. So we do not have a clear
evidence for this interpretation.
3.4
Time to form the wormhole
In this subsection we provide analytic estimates for the time it takes to form the wormhole. We
will ﬁrst estimate the time it takes to reach T2BH and then the time it takes to reach from there
to TWH. At this point we basically have a cold wormhole, so we will consider it to be already
formed. We could also consider it formed once we reach T2BH and we start moving on the hot
wormhole region.
In order to estimate these times we need an expression for the rate of energy emission into
the bath. For a general coupling between a system and a large bath the energy loss rate can be

where factor of 2 comes from having both sides of coupled to a bath. In the above integral, we
can replace the system two point function by the thermal one at the instantaneous temperature,
assuming that the temperature varies slowly. Moreover, for SYK at low temperatures we can
simply use conformal approximations for two-point functions.

Reaching TWH
Now let us calculate time ∆tWH which is needed to go through the hot wormhole phase and reach
TWH. To this end we will employ some results from the end of Section 2.3 about Schwarzian.
This Schwarzian approximation breaks for very hot wormholes with temperature of order T2BH,
but holds for lower temperatures.
Suppressing the numerical coeﬃcients, GLL in this regime is given by:
GLL(t) ∝

(63)
where t′(t) is determined by the solution of eq. (32). The hot wormhole(unstable branch) is
characterized by having t′ ≪1, so eq. (32) can be simpliﬁed by neglecting Schwarzian kinetic
term (the ﬁrst term in eq. (32))
exp (−t′β/4) ∼

t′1/2
(64)
This approximation breaks down near T ∼TWH, so we further assume that we use this approx-
imation for temperatures which are slightly below or of order TWH.
From this equation, up to a logarithmic term in µ, t′ and β are related by t′ ∼1/β. Using
(64), the energy (37) can be written as

This ratio is much bigger than 1 for β ≫1/(J1/3µ2/3) ∼βWH. So apart from the region close
to TWH the hot wormhole has a large negative heat capacity, compared to a single SYK model
at the same temperature.
The energy ﬂux can be computed using the expression (63) for GLL. The result is again
determined by scale symmetry and it is again proportional to t′2 ∼1/β2 as in (60). However,
because of the big negative heat capacity, the time it takes to go through this region is much
longer than (62). Solving for β(t) we get

(69)
This timescale is much larger than ∆tWH, (62), which scaled only logarithmically in µ.
Moreover, it is mostly determined by the region near T2BH, which is where the approximation is
breaking down. So (69) should only be viewed as an order of magnitude estimate.
Our numerical results for β(t) on Figures 7 and 9 seem to qualitatively support these conclu-
sions. Notice that, as expected, the times are inversely proportional to the coupling to the bath
η.

Two coupled black holes in gravity
The low energy description of the SYK model has some features in common with certain two
dimensional theories of gravity. In this section, we study a similar problem in a gravitational
theory in order to compare to the answers we found above.
We consider a Jackiw-Teitelboim theory of gravity coupled to matter, see [17, 18, 19] for
details. This gravity theory describes a two dimensional black hole with an AdS2 geometry.
The AdS2 space has a boundary. We consider a system containing two such black hole exteriors
and we introduce a coupling for the two dimensional matter ﬁelds propagating in the bulk. We
assume that have N such matter ﬁelds. Let us say that χ is a matter ﬁeld with a certain mass m
in the bulk and quantized with Neumann boundary conditions so that its dimension is ∆, with
∆< 1/2. We couple their boundary values through a term, for each ﬁeld,
S = i˜µ
Z

˜µ =

J2∆
(70)
were we imagine that J−1 is related to a cutoﬀin the radial AdS2 directiond and u is the physical
boundary time.
4.1
High temperature phase
We now consider the high temperature phase where in Euclidean space we have two separate
disks that are connected through the interaction (70). Concentrating on the matter system, this
interaction is easy to analyze because the full matter theory is just quadratic. In principle, we
dWith the AdS metric ds2 = (dx2 + dz2)/z2, this is the cutoﬀat z = ϵ, and we are deﬁning J = 1/ϵ.
20

also need to consider the eﬀects of gravity, and we will discuss them later. This interaction, (70),
leads to the Feynman diagrams in Figure 10(a), which can be easily summed, as we explain below.
Since the interaction is relevant, it becomes important at low temperatures. For suﬃciently low
temperatures, the net eﬀect is to change the boundary conditions for the bulk fermions χ from
Neumann to Dirichlet. Namely, at low temperatures we get two decoupled disks with Dirichlet
boundary conditions for bulk fermions. We now discuss this more explicitly.
When ˜µ = 0 we have two separate disks and the matter partition function is just given by Z2
N,
namely the square of the partition function of a fermion with Neumann boundary conditions.
Starting from this state we can now sum the diagrams in Figure (10)(a). For each fermion ﬁeld,
we get

For large ˜µ we ﬁnd that the partition function gets an additional factor of the determinant
of G∆. It turns out that this produces the Dirichlet partition function [21, 24]

two coupled SYK model that reproduce the ﬁeld theory diagrams in (a). (c) An example

The conclusion is that if we start out with two disks with Neumann boundary conditions,
after we turn on the relevant perturbation (70), for very low temperatures we get two decoupled
disks again but with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This implies that for very low temperatures,
the bulk fermion would be dual to an operator of dimension 1 −∆.

For q = 4 this reproduces (24).
This is not surprising because we were summing the same
type of diagrams. However, in the gravity case these are all the diagrams, so we can study the
whole ﬂow. The new IR ﬁxed point simply corresponds to ﬂipping the boundary conditions to
Dirichlet. So nothing too dramatic happens in the gravity solution when we go to temperatures
21

lower than the temperature T2BH in (73), except that the change in the boundary conditions will
change the value of the ground state entropy.
In this discussion, we have ignored the dynamics of gravity. In principle, we could wonder
whether we should consider non-trivial solutions of the Schwarzian theory. If we assume that
the solution is invariant under translations for each disk, then, up to gauge symmetries of the
Schwarzian theory, the only solution is the usual one. In Appendix B, we examine whether
non-constant Schwarzian modes could lower the action. We ﬁnd that they do not, at least in
the approximation we considered. In our analysis we assumed that gravity is classical, which is
correct if φr/β ≫1. Here φr is the JT gravity analog of the coeﬃcient of the Schwarzian, the
analog of NαS/J . We have also assumed that we have a relatively low number of bulk quantum
ﬁelds so that the eﬀects of integrating them out does not signiﬁcantly change the value of S0,
the ground state entropy. This is the regime where the gravity theory is simplest. As we will
discuss below, the SYK model is diﬀerent in this respect.
4.2
Low temperature phase
At very low temperatures the coupling (70) leads to the formation of a wormhole [8]. This is
identical to the small µ coupled SYK model analysis of section 2.3, since the eﬀects of gravity
can also be described in terms of the Schwarzian mode.
When we decrease the temperature along the negative speciﬁc heat region (the hot wormhole
phase), the wormhole is getting longer and longer. Or, more precisely, there is a larger redshift
factor between the boundary and the center of the wormhole. Then, the interaction, which is a
relevant deformation, becomes stronger. When we considered the problem for the disks, we found
that for strong interactions we get an eﬀective change in boundary conditions from Neumann to
Dirichlet. Here we expect the same phenomenon when t′ is becomes
t′ ∝T2BH ∝
 µ
J2∆

1
1−2∆
(74)
where t′ is the variable in (32), which is proportional to the value of the redshift factor at the
center of the wormhole. In other words, t′ becomes of the order of the temperature T2BH in
(73). We refer to Appendix F for details. At this value of t′ the wormhole is so long that the
approximations used in deriving (33) are no longer valid. Interestingly, due to (35), this happens
also at a temperature of the order of T2BH, which is the temperature where the two disk solutions
starts being corrected. This might appear as a coincidence, but it is not. In the hot wormhole
phase we ﬁnd that the temperature sets the value of t′ and thus the amount of RG ﬂow that
the relevant left-right interaction undergoes. Therefore, this interaction becomes relevant at the
same place.
This statement can be further veriﬁed by checking whether the hot wormhole thermodynamic
curve (red curve in ﬁgure 6) will join with the two black hole phase (blue curve in ﬁgure 6) at
T = T2BH. In the hot wormhole phase the energy is given by (65) and in the two black hole
phase by (19). Indeed, the two curves join at T ∼T2BH.
In a gravity theory with a relatively low number of ﬁelds, we expect that after T2BH the
wormhole phase might not exist any longer.
One conclusion is that, in a general JT gravity theory plus matter, we do not seem to be able
to easily join the high temperature phase and the hot wormhole phase. This is mysterious in
the gravity theory because it involves a topology change. Of course, the low temperature phase
and the hot wormhole phase are connected smoothly at TWH in a region where we can trust the
wormhole analysis in the Schwarzian approximation, as discussed near (33).
4.3
Comparison with the SYK model
In the SYK model, the addition of the interaction corrects the original diagrams by inserting µ
terms in the propagators. If we insert them outside the self energy correction (the Σ bubble),
then we get diagrams which are identical to the ones we discussed in gravity, see Figure 10(b).
22

However, in the SYK model we can also insert µ inside the self energy corrections, these are new
diagrams that are not present in the gravity discussion, see Figure (10)(c).
As we mentioned above the region of the phase diagram near temperatures T ∼T2BH is
diﬀerent in a generic JT gravity theory plus matter than in SYK. However, we can consider the
folloing gravitations model that would look more qualitatively similar to the SYK model.
First we note that the SYK ground state entropy is given by S0 = Ns0, where s0 is given by
[2, 21]
es0 = (det G∆)−1
2 = ZN
ZD
,
for one Majorana fermion
(75)
where the ﬁrst equality follows from the usual G, Σ action at low energies. The second equality
was mentioned in (72). This implies that if we want to describe the SYK model in terms of
JT gravity, we should think that when the fermions have Dirichlet boundary conditions, the net
entropy, or value of the topological terms in the action should be zero, φ0 = 0. Then the actual
value of the ground state entropy of the usual, single boundary SYK model, (75), is simply given
by the contribution of changing the boundary condition for the bulk ﬁelds from Dirichlet to
Neumann [21].
Returning now to the coupled model and starting from the high temperature phase, we see
that when we reach the temperature T2BH we are changing to a Dirichlet boundary condition.
This means that the total S0 now becomes zero, which implies that the topology change is easy.
Similarly, if we start from the canonically unstable wormhole phase and approach T2BH, we also
see a change in the boundary conditions so that S0 again becomes zero and topology change is
easy. So we can join the two phases with a change in topology at T2BH. In this way we can
qualitatively understand the transition. We have given evidence that this is a smooth transition
in the coupled SYK model. What we are discussing here is just a cartoon for a gravity picture
of what is happening.
We also see why SYK is diﬀerent than a generic JT gravity theory with a smaller number of
ﬁelds. In such gravity theories the ﬂow from Neuman to Dirichlet would not change S0 by too
much and the topology change remains suppressed. For this reason we have not been able to see
a general mechanism for the transition that would also work in more general gravity theories,
such as the Standard Model in the presence of magnetically charged black holes as discussed in
[12].

Conclusion
In this paper we studied the approach to the ground state of the two coupled SYK models [8].
We ﬁrst discussed the equilibrium thermodynamics picture. In the microcannonical ensemble we
expect a continuous picture with no phase transition. As the energy decreases, the temperature
decreases up to a value T2BH where the system looks like two separate thermal SYK models with
a small coupling. At T2BH this coupling becomes strong and the system transitions to a “hot
wormhole” phase with negative speciﬁc heat. Now the temperature increases up to TWH and then
the wormhole becomes cooler and shorter, and the speciﬁc heat becomes positive again. This
whole picture can be understood using simple analytic approximations, except for the transition
region at T ∼T2BH.
We found that the real time evolution looked as if the system is following the above equi-
librium phase diagram. Unfortunately, for the parameters we could use in our numerical com-
putation, we could not trust quantitatively the simple analytic approximations. However, these
gave a qualitatively correct answer. The system remained near thermal equilibrium as it cooled
down, except for some deviations in the GLR correlator, which we think should disappear if we
were to cool more slowly.
The conclusion is that, starting with a generic state of the two coupled SYK model, we can
ﬁnd the ground state by coupling the system to the bath and cooling it down. In particular, the
system does not get stuck in a metastable state. This provides a feasible way to produce a state
close to the TFD.
23

We also computed the time to form the wormhole. Most of the time is spent near the region
with T ∼T2BH.
One of our goals was to extract some general lessons for wormhole formation in gravity.
Unfortunately, the SYK model seems to be special, and its special features becomes manifest in
the ease by which we can connect the two black hole phase with the hot wormhole phase near
T ∼T2BH. These two phases do not seem to be so easy to connect in more general theories of
gravity. We qualitatively explained why topology is simpler in a gravity theory that is similar
to the SYK model, but harder in a more general theory of gravity.
Nevertheless we cannot say how hard forming a wormhole would be in a more general theory
of gravity, such as the one describing the wormholes in [12]. It seems hard, but maybe there is
an “easy” pathway to form it. It would be interesting to answer this question.
We expect that this article would be relevant for eﬀorts that try to do it using the SYK
model, see the proposal in [25], for example.

Also notice that the constant −c1 −2 is not simply a correction to the ground state energy. As

we can not take the limit β →∞in this expression. This is signalled by the presence of the
logarithm. This divergence has IR nature, and it is not caused by using the conformal answer
in the integral (80).
To extract c1 we can compute integral (80) using the numerically obtained GLL. We ﬁnd
that c1 = 1.66(1). This agrees very well with the actual numerical result for the energy - Figure

Checking whether Schwarzian ﬂuctuations are stable
Let us start from doing a 1-loop calculation for Schwarzian ﬁrst. We again assume that we in
the phase with two separate black holes. Then the action will involve two Schwarzian terms
plus the interaction piece. For a moment we can imagine that instead of a simple interaction
µψLψR we have a term involving composite operators iF µOLOR with zero expectation values:
⟨OL(R)⟩= 0. F is the OL(R) fermionic number. The Schwarzians interact because Schwarzians
gravitationally dress OL(R) by time reparametrizations.

For simplicity we can put β = π and expand ϵ in Fourier modes:

(90)
Before doing an actual computation, let us stop and explain why Schwarzian does not con-
tribute classicaly here and at higher loops.
By classically we mean that its contribution is
suppressed by 1/N. Since we are in a thermal state (87) is the a translation symmetry along
the Euclidean time u. This is why after expanding in Fourier modes (90) we will not have terms
linear in ϵn. It means that the thermal solution (87) is still a classical solution of Schwarzian
equations of motion even with complicated non-local interaction induced by loops. Since we
have an overall N in front of the action, integrating out ϵn will lead to a subleading correction.
Let us return to the actual 1-loop calculation. The only subtlety is that one has to be careful
with the time ordering, since the denominator involves

Lorentz time Dyson–Schwinger equation

Single SYK
Let us ﬁrst consider a single SYK in Euclidean time. Then the DS equations have the form:
Σ(τ) = J2G(τ)3
(−iω −Σ(ω))G(ω) = 1
(96)
Now we want to switch to Lorentzian time. We deﬁne the Wightman function with an extra
−i:
−i⟨ψi(t)ψi(0)⟩= G>(t)
(97)
As is well-known, upon the analytical continuation in time domain, the time-ordered Eu-
clidean two-point function becomes the Wightman function, thereforee:

The other DS equation is written in the frequency space, this is why after the analytic continu-
ation it will involve the retarded components:

So far we have not used any information about the state we are considering. This informa-
tion is needed to connect G> and GR. In thermal state we can use Fluctuation-Dissipation

Now we have 4 Green’s functions. The self-energies have similar expressions:

(101)
eThe minus sign is subtle: one can recover it either from the eﬀective action (50) on the Keldysh contour or doing
a careful analytic continuation through the frequency space as was done in [3]
27

and the equation (99) should be understood as a matrix equation. For the diagonal Green’s
functions the FDT has the same form:
G>(ω)aa = 2i Im GR
aa(ω)
e−βω + 1
(102)
However the imaginary part of the oﬀ-diagonal components is skew-symmetric in time, so we
have:
G>(ω)LR = Re GR
LR(ω)
e−βω + 1
(103)
This system of equations can be solved numerically by the iteration procedure used for a
single SYK model [3]. To ensure that the iteration procedure converges to an actual solution we
monitor the discrepancies of eqs. (8):
dab =
1
Npoints
∥∂τGab(τ) −Σac ∗Gcb(τ) −δabδ(τ)∥2
(104)
and make sure that dab < 10−10. The typical number of discretization points is Npoints ∼217.
Before the transition the diagonal Green’s function look similar to single SYK ones - Figure

Derivation of the eﬀective action
Let us write down explicitly the total action for the system on the Keldysh contour C. We will
suppress the bath action. Bath fermions χα and ˜χα, α = 1, . . . , M belong to independend q = 4
SYK systems with coupling JB. We denote their two-point functions by GB:

The total action consists of four terms:
Stot = Skin + SJ + Sµ + Sbath

˜χ. Couplings V and ˜V are Gaussing with the variance [14]:

is integrated over along the imaginary axis:

Numerical method
Now let us describe the numerical method for solving Kadanoﬀ–Baym equations. Numerical
solution of Kadanoﬀ–Baym equations for SYK model was described previously in [15, 16] and
our approach is essentially the same.
We will use two-dimensional grid with uniform timestep to discretize (t1, t2) plane.
The
timestep dt should be much smaller than the characteristic time-scales in SYK 1/J, 1/µ. Since
µ ≪J, the 1/J constraint is much stricter. We will work with J = 0.5 this is just a choice to ﬁx
energy units. Our time steps will be 0.2, 0.1, 0.05. The main numerical limitation comes from
the fact that the Green functions have spread ∼β, so we can not go to very big β, since we
29

will have to use a huge grid. At ﬁnite temperature the Green functions decay exponentially, so
to greatly speed up the computation we will concentrate on the strip |t1 −t2| ≲cβmax on the
(t1, t2) plane - Figure 13. We will assume that outside this strip all the Green functions are zero.
The constant βmax is the maximal β in the problem at hand. In our case βmax = βB - bath’s
beta. One can verify that one c is big enough the result of the computation does not change.
With the computation power avaliable to us, in order to keep the computation time to be of
order of dozens of hours, β should be less than 100. This limits us to µ ≳0.05. For µ = 0.05 the
transition beta is ∼61 - see Figure 6.
The system-bath coupling η should be much smaller than J2 = 0.25 so that the system
remain thermal. We will use η in the range 0.01 −0.04. Moreover to avoid large gradients we
will switch on the coupling linearly, with the switch-on time Tswitch = 20.
Initial Green function is found by numerically solving Lorentz-time equilibrium Dyson–
Schwinger equation as described in Appendix C. The bath Green function is obtained in a
similar fashion. In order to avoid large speads in the bath’s Green function, βB will be in the
range 70 −100.
To compute the integral in KB equations we will use trapezoid method and for the time
propagation we use predictor-corrector scheme. The same techniques have been used in [15, 16].
For KB equations one has to be careful with propagating the Green function along the diagonal.
Fortunately, for Majorana fermions there is a simple relation:
G>
aa(t, t) = −i
2
(114)
However, for the Green function obtained by numerically solving the DS equation the diagonal
value is not exactly −i/2, so on a discrete lattice we will just propagate this value:
G>
aa(j, j) = G>
aa(0, 0)
(115)
For the mixed GLR we do not have a simple relation like that. So we will use again the predictor-
corrector scheme. The value on the diagonal can be found by either propagating along t1 or t2.
We will take the avarge of these results.
Let us deﬁne the “corner slice” Green functions as G>
T,ab(x):
G>
T,ab(x) = θ(x)G>
ab(T −x, T) + θ(−x)G>
ab(T, T + x)
(116)

Then the energy at time t = T can be computed analogously to eq. (12):

(118)
Along the time evolution the system cools down, so formally the temperature is not well
deﬁned. However, if the cooling process is slow we might expect that at each point in time the
short-time correlators will be thermal. In order to extract the temperature we need to choose
the 1D slice of the Green function G>
S,ab to use the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem(FDT). For
the same side correlators and diﬀerent side correlators it looks slightly diﬀerent. For the same
side case we have:
Im

, a ̸= b
(120)
To the extent that the system is in thermal equilibrium, it is time translation invariant and
it does not matter what the value of t1 + t2 is. We will actually choose the corner slice Green
function G>
T,ab in (116). This choice is motivated by the fact that exactly these Greens function
enter in the deﬁnition of energy (118).
Then one can ﬁt it the left hand side of (119) with the tanh function to extract the tempera-
ture. We need to select a frequency range of at least a couple of temperatures in order to really
probe the thermalization. On the other hand, for very large frequencies the numerical data has
a lot of noise coming from discrete timestep, see Figure 14. Typically we will ﬁt eq. (119) up to
frequencies of order 10 temperatures, i.e. βn/L ∼10. Although the results do not depend much
of this choice.

Change of boundary conditions
First we need derive an analogue of (72) for the case of global AdS2. We start from fermions
having Dirichlet boundary conditions on both boundaries and add an extra fermion χL,R on the
boundary to initiate the ﬂow from Dirichlet to Neumann boundary conditions. Essentially this
way we perform a Legendre transformation [20]. This way we obtain the relation:

We expect
that they should match for frequencies much less than the inverse discretization timestep:
n/L ≪1/dt. In on this graph this UV cutoﬀis at βnmax/L ∼400. The region used for
the ﬁt, β|n|/L ≤10, is within the dashed lines.
Now let us return to our problem with the µ term. So now we have Neumann fermions plus
the interaction term µψLψR coupling the two boundaries. The partition function can be easily
found:
Zµ = Zµ=0

where the matrix ˆµ is given by eq. (10). For large µ we have

(126)
To conclude that Zµ≫1 ∝ZD we need the matrix relation
ˆG1−∆(ω) ˆG∆(ω) = id
(127)
In fact this relation coincides with the conformal(i.e. neglecting the time derivative) Dyson–
Schwinger equation (8).
