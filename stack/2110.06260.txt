Abstract. For a totally positive deﬁnite quadratic form over the ring of integers of a totally real
number ﬁeld K, we show that there are only ﬁnitely many totally real ﬁeld extensions of K of a ﬁxed
degree over which the form is universal (namely, those that have a short basis in a suitable sense).
Along the way we give a general construction of a universal form of rank bounded by D(log D)d−1,
where d is the degree of K over Q and D is its discriminant. Furthermore, for any ﬁxed degree we
prove (weak) Kitaoka’s conjecture that there are only ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds with a
universal ternary quadratic form.
1. Introduction
Let F be a totally real number ﬁeld with the ring of integers OF . A classical question asks when
an algebraic integer α ∈OF can be written as the sum of squares of elements of OF ; an obvious
necessary condition is that α is totally positive (i.e., all its conjugates are positive). This condition is
also suﬃcient in the basic case F = Q by the four square theorem, and when F = Q(
√
5). However,
Siegel [Si2] proved that these are the only such totally real number ﬁelds, motivating the study of two
natural generalizations.
The ﬁrst one asks how many squares are required, provided that α is indeed representable as the
sum of squares. This leads to the Pythagoras number, a constant well-studied also in other settings
(see, e.g., [Le]). Yet, in the case of the ring of integers of a totally real number ﬁeld, all that is known
in general is that the Pythagoras number is ﬁnite [Sc] and bounded by the degree of the ﬁeld [KY],
but can grow arbitrarily large [Sc] (in the non-totally real case, the Pythagoras number ≤5 [Pe2]; for
some small degree cases see [Pe1, Ti, KRS]). Furthermore, Siegel [Si1] proved that for each number
ﬁeld F there exists m ∈N such that all totally positive integers divisible by m can be represented as
the sum of squares.
The second generalization is to universal forms over F, i.e., quadratic forms that represent all the
totally positive elements of OF . The smallest possible rank of a universal form is three, and this can
happen only in number ﬁelds of even degree [EK]. Even for them, Kitaoka formulated his inﬂuential
conjecture that there are only ﬁnitely many number ﬁelds F admitting a ternary universal form. The
only known examples are in real quadratic ﬁelds [CKR] and Kitaoka’s conjecture remains unproven,
even though it seems that universal forms typically must have large ranks [BK, Ka, KKP, KT, Ya].
Indecomposable algebraic integers turned out to be one of the key tools in the recent advances
on this topic. In this short paper, we ﬁrst prove in Theorem 5 that each indecomposable has norm
smaller or equal to the discriminant of F, signiﬁcantly extending previous results in the quadratic and
cubic cases [DS, KT, TV], as well as improving the previous general bound [Br], which is typically
much worse than ours, as it depends on the regulator. Our result is also a substantial step towards
answering [Nar, Problem 53].
Theorem 5 directly implies a construction of a universal quadratic form – giving the ﬁrst completely
general result in the train of thought started by B. M. Kim [Ki1]. The following theorem is more
precisely formulated and proved as Theorem 6.

Theorem 1. Let F be a totally real number ﬁeld of degree d = [F : Q] and discriminant ∆. Then
there is a universal quadratic form over OF of rank ≪∆(log ∆)d−1.
In the case when the number ﬁeld F is monogenic (i.e., has integral power basis), contains no proper
subﬁelds, and has units of all signatures, there is also a lower bound [Ya, Theorem 1.4] on the rank of
universal quadratic forms that depends on ∆. In particular, for such real quadratic number ﬁelds [Ya,
Theorem 5.4], and for the simplest cubic ﬁelds [KT, Theorem 1.1], the rank of the universal quadratic
form is ≫∆1/2 or ≫∆1/4, depending on whether the quadratic form is classical or not, respectively.
Then we move on to the main goal of this note, namely, to proving several ﬁniteness results con-
cerning the (non-)universality of certain quadratic forms (and, slightly more generally, OF -lattices).
Theorem 2. Let F be a totally real number ﬁeld, L an OF -lattice, and d, m ∈N. There are at most
ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds K ⊃F of degree d = [K : Q] such that L ⊗OK represents all
elements of mO+
K.
This theorem includes, as a signiﬁcant special case, a new result on the sum of squares, for one
can take F = Q and L = Zr equipped with the quadratic form Q = x2
1 + · · · + x2
r. It also extends
the previous results on the lifting problem (i.e., whether a form can be universal over a larger number
ﬁeld, see [KY] and potentially universal quadratic forms in [XZ]), and partly resolves an open question
formulated in [KY]: As Corollary 9 we show that a given quadratic form is universal only over ﬁnitely
many totally real number ﬁelds of degree d.
We further apply these results to prove a weak version of Kitaoka’s conjecture:
Theorem 3. For each d ∈N, there are only ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds K of degree
d = [K : Q] over which there is a ternary universal OK-lattice.
For classical lattices, this theorem was previously proved by B. M. Kim in an unpublished manu-
script [Ki2].
We begin the article by introducing notation and basic tools in the next section. Section 3 considers
indecomposables and contains the proofs of Theorems 5 and 6. Theorem 2 is then proved in Section
4 as Theorem 7. There we also cover the cases of representations of mO+
F by the sums of squares
(Corollary 8) and the lifting problem for positive deﬁnite quadratic forms over Z (Corollary 9). Finally,
Theorem 3 is proved in the last section as Theorem 12. There we use the existence of “universality
criterion sets” (as introduced in [EKK]), which was a folklore result [Km], whose full proof appeared
in the work of Chan and Oh [CO].

2. Preliminaries
Let F be a totally real number ﬁeld of degree d over Q and let OF denote its ring of integers. Let
σ1, σ2, . . . , σd : K ,→R be the distinct real embeddings of F and let σ = (σ1, σ2, . . . , σd) : F ,→Rd be
the corresponding embedding of F into the Minkowski space.
The norm and trace are NF/Q, TrF/Q : F →R, NF/Q(α) = σ1(α) · · · σd(α) and TrF/Q(α) = σ1(α) +
· · · + σd(α).
As a height function on F, we will primarily work with the house (also called the maximum modulus
of conjugates), deﬁned as α F = α = maxi(|σi(α)|). For v = (v1, . . . , vn)t ∈F n, we further let
v F = v = maxj vj F . We have α ≥1 for all α ∈OF \ {0}.
An element α ∈F is totally positive if σi(α) > 0 for all i. The set of all totally positive elements of
F is denoted F +. For α, β ∈F, α is totally greater than β (denoted α ≻β) if α −β ∈F +. If E is a
subset of F, then E+ = E ∩F +.
An element α ∈O+
F is indecomposable if there does not exist β ∈O+
F such that α ≻β.

F .
We follow the lattice-related terminologies and notations from [OM]. Speciﬁcally, let V be r-ary
quadratic space over F with its symmetric bilinear form B : V × V −→F and the corresponding
quadratic form Q, i.e., B(v, v) = Q(v). The Gram matrix of vectors v1, . . . , vk ∈V is the k × k
symmetric matrix (B(vi, vj)).
A (quadratic) OF -lattice L on V is a ﬁnitely generated OF -submodule of V such that FL = V ,
which we view equipped with the restrictions of B and Q; we often denote this by saying that (L, Q)
is an OF -lattice. The rank of L is r.
The scale of L is sL = {B(v, w) : v, w ∈L}, while the OF -module generated by Q(L) = {Q(v) :
v ∈L}, denoted by nL, is called the norm of L. Throughout the work we assume that nL ⊂OF (i.e.,
Q(v) ∈OF for all v ∈L); then sL ⊂1
2OF and 2B(v, w) ∈OF for all v, w ∈L. We say that the
scale is integral if sL ⊂OF , in this case we say that the lattice is classical. By [OM, 81:3] there is a
basis v1, . . . , vr of V and fractional ideals ai ⊂F such that L = a1v1 + · · · + arvr. The volume of L is
vL = a2
1 · · · a2
r det(B(vi, vj)).
The quadratic form Q (or, the lattice L) is totally positive deﬁnite if Q(v) ≻0 for all non-zero
v ∈V . In that case we have the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality Q(v)Q(w) ⪰B(v, w)2 for all v, w ∈V
(that easily follows from the usual Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for quadratic forms over R). We say
that L (or Q) represents an algebraic integer α if there exists v ∈L such that Q(v) = α. We say that
a totally positive lattice is universal (over OF or over F) if it represents all the elements of O+
F .
Given a ﬁeld extension K ⊃F and an OF -lattice (L, Q), we have the tensor product OK-lattice
L ⊗OK deﬁned as L ⊗OK = OKa1v1 + · · · + OKarvr equipped with the natural extensions of B
and Q, e.g., if x = P xivi ∈L ⊗OK, then Q(x) = xtMx where we identify x with the column
vector (x1, . . . , xr)t and M = (B(vi, vj)) is the Gram matrix. If we moreover identify V = F r, then
L ⊗OK ⊂Kr.
For a quadratic form Q : Or
F →OF , we apply all the preceding terminology when it applies to the
free OF -lattice (Or
F , Q).
Convention. Whenever we talk about an OF -lattice throughout the paper, we always mean a totally
positive deﬁnite quadratic OF -lattice satisfying nL ⊂OF .
We shall also use the common asymptotic notations: If f(x), g(x) are two positive real functions,
then f ≪g (and g ≫f) if there is a constant C > 0 such that f(x) < Cg(x) for all x (that lie in the
domains of f, g), and f ≍g if f ≪g and g ≪f.
Let us now begin with the following lemma:
Lemma 4. Let K ⊃F be totally real number ﬁelds and (L, Q) an OF -lattice. There is C = CL,F ∈R+
such that for all v ∈L ⊗OK we have v 2
K ≤C Q(v) K.
Note that the constant C = CL,F above depends on L, Q, F, and the choice of pseudo-basis L =
a1u1 + · · · + arur, but not on K.
Proof. This follows from Rayleigh–Ritz Theorem (Rayleigh quotient) [HJ, Theorem 4.2.2], that says:
If M is a symmetric matrix with entries in R and λ1(M) is its smallest eigenvalue, then
(1)
λ1(M)
X
v2
k ≤vtMv
for any vector v = (v1, . . . , vd)t ∈Rd. Let L = a1u1 + · · · + arur and let M = (B(ui, uj)) be the
corresponding Gram matrix. Deﬁne Mi = σi(M) for each embeddings of F in R. In particular, Mi is
a symmetric matrix with coeﬃcients in F. For each embedding σi : F ,→R, let σij : K ,→R be all its
extensions.
It now suﬃces to consider the inequality (1) with C = 1
λ, where λ = mini λ1(Mi) (note that λ > 0,
for L is totally positive deﬁnite, which implies that each matrix Mi is positive deﬁnite). That is,

3. Indecomposables
Let us start by proving a general bound on the norm of indecomposables.
Theorem 5. Let K be a totally real number ﬁeld with discriminant ∆. For every element α ∈O+
K with
NK/Q(α) > ∆there is β ∈OK such that α ≻β2. In particular, no such element α is indecomposable.
Proof. Let K be of degree d over Q. In the Minkowski space associated to K, consider the box deﬁned
by |xi| ≤
p
σi(α) −ε, where σi are the embeddings of K into R and ε > 0 is small enough that
d
Y
i=1
(
p
σi(α) −ε) >
√
∆.
This is possible because Qd
i=1
p
σi(α) =
q
NK/Q(α) >
√
∆. Thus the volume of the box is bigger
than 2d√
∆.
By Minkowski theorem (e.g., see Theorem III in Chapter III in [Ca]) there exists a
non-zero lattice point in this box, which corresponds to an algebraic integer β ∈OK. We have that
p
σi(α) > σi(β), and thus σi(α) > σi(β2) for all i. Therefore α ≻β2, as was required to show.
□
As an important corollary, we get the following general construction of a universal quadratic form.
Theorem 6. Let K be a totally real number ﬁeld of degree d = [K : Q] whose discriminant is ∆
and Pythagoras number of the ring of integers OK is P(OK) = P. Fix a set of representatives S for
classes of elements α ∈O+
K, NK/Q(α) ≤∆, up to multiplication by squares of units in OK. Then the
diagonal quadratic form
Q =
X
α∈S
αx2
α + y2
1 + · · · + y2
P
is universal and has rank #S + P ≪∆(log ∆)d−1 (where the implied constant depends only on d).
Proof. Let γ ∈O+
K.
If NK/Q(γ) > ∆, then we can repeatedly use Theorem 5 to ﬁnd elements
γ0 ∈O+
K, β1, . . . , βt ∈OK such that γ = γ0 + β2
1 + · · · + β2
t and NK/Q(γ0) ≤∆. Then γ0 = αx2 for
some α ∈S and x ∈O×
K, and the sum of squares β2
1 + · · · + β2
t is represented as y2
1 + · · · + y2
P by the
deﬁnition of the Pythagoras number P.
Now it remains to estimate #S + P: The size of S is at most 2d-times the number of principal
ideals of norm ≤∆(for in S, we are considering elements up to squares of units). Counting all ideals
I of norm N(I) ≤∆, it is quite easy to see that their number is ≪∆(log ∆)d−1:
Let an be the number of ideals in OK of norm n and let bn be deﬁned by ζ(s)d = P
n≥1 bnn−s
(where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta-function). For each rational prime p, there are at most d prime
ideals that divide p (and whose norm is a power of p), and so by comparing the Euler products of
ζK(s) = P
n≥1 ann−s and ζ(s)d, we see that an ≤bn for all n. Thus it suﬃces to obtain an upper
bound for P
1≤n≤∆bn, which by the Tauberian theorem is easily seen to be ≪∆(log ∆)d−1 as ∆→∞
(where the implied constant depends only on d), as we wanted. (For the required background in
analytic number theory, see, e.g., [Nar, Chapter 7 and Appendix II]).
As for the Pythagoras number P, in [KY, Corollary 3.3] we proved that P is bounded from above
by a bound that depends only on the degree d = [K : Q]. Speciﬁcally, the proof of [KY, Corollary 3.3]
established that P ≤g(d), where g(d) is the g-invariant, i.e., the smallest rational integer such that any
quadratic form with Z-coeﬃcients of rank d that is represented by the sum of any number of squares
is represented by the sum of g(d) squares. Recently Beli, Chan, Icaza, and Liu [BC+, Theorem 1.1]
showed an upper bound for the g-invariant that is exponential in
√
d, i.e., g(d) ≤c1 exp(c2
√
d). In
any case, as our implied constant depends on d, we have P ≪1.
□
Note that the number of ideals in OK of norm ≤X grows as ≍X as X →∞(and an analogue
of this is known even for principal ideals). But here the constants do depend on K, and in fact, even
using ﬁner versions of this asymptotics, it seems that for X = ∆, the error term is often larger than
the main term. Therefore in Theorem 6 we had to use the weaker bound ≪∆(log ∆)d−1.

4. Weak Lifting Problem
We are now ready to prove our ﬁrst main theorem concerning the general lifting problem.
Theorem 7. Let F be a totally real number ﬁeld, L an OF -lattice, and d, m ∈N. There are at most
ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds K ⊃F of degree d = [K : Q] such that L ⊗OK represents all
elements of mO+
K.
Proof. Let C be the constant (for F and L) from Lemma 4 and take a totally real number ﬁeld K ⊃F
of degree d = [K : Q]. Let X > 1 be such that
• X > αi F = αi K for all elements αi in a ﬁxed integral basis of F, and
• X > 3Cm.
Consider the subﬁeld E ⊂K generated (as a ﬁeld) by all the elements α ∈OK such that α K < X.
By our choice of X, we have F ⊂E. There are only ﬁnitely many algebraic integers of bounded
degree and house (in particular, of degree ≤d and house < X), and so they generate only ﬁnitely
many possible number ﬁelds E. In particular, there are (at most) ﬁnitely many possible ﬁelds K for
which E = K can happen. Excluding these Ks, we can assume that E is a proper subﬁeld of K.
Let Y ≥X be the minimum of α = α K for α ∈OK \ OE (the minimum exists, as the set of
algebraic integers of bounded degree and α is ﬁnite). Let α ∈OK \ OE be such that α = Y , and let
k ∈Z be the smallest rational integer such that k + α ≻0. We have k + α < 2 α + 1 ≤3 α .
If L ⊗OK represents all elements from mO+
K, then there exists v ∈L ⊗OK ⊂Kr such that
Q(v) = m(k + α). If v = (vj) ∈Er ⊂Kr, then Q(v) ∈E (as (L, Q) is an OF -lattice and F ⊂E), and
so also α ∈E, a contradiction. Thus there is j such that vj ̸∈E, and so v ≥vj ≥Y .
By Lemma 4 we then have
Y 2 ≤v 2 ≤C Q(v) = Cm k + α < 3Cm α = 3Y Cm.
Thus X ≤Y < 3Cm, which is a contradiction with our choice of X.
□
Note that one could also consider the natural extension of Theorem 7 to representations of βO+
K for
ﬁxed β ∈O+
F . The corresponding statement follows immediately from the theorem, as βO+
K ⊂mO+
K
for m = NF/Q(β).
Corollary 8. For each m, d ∈N, there are only ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds K of degree
d = [K : Q] such that all elements in mO+
K are sums of squares.
Proof. The Pythagoras number of the ring of integers is bounded in terms of degree of the ﬁeld
extension [KY, Corollary 3.3], i.e., there is a function g(d) such that P(OF ) ≤g(d) whenever [F :
Q] = d. Thus, it suﬃces to consider the sum of a bounded number of squares Q = x2
1 + · · · + x2
g(d).
Then the corollary is immediate from the previous theorem applied to the free OF -lattice (Og(d)
F
, Q).
(See the end of the proof of Theorem 6 for more information on g(d).)
□
We get the subsequent strong addendum to Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 in [KY]:
Corollary 9. For each d, r ∈N, there are only ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds K of degree
d = [K : Q] such that there is a positive deﬁnite quadratic form over Z of rank r that is universal over
K.
Proof. Let Q be a positive deﬁnite quadratic form over Z of rank r. By Theorem 1 in [CS] (possibly
ﬁrst taking 2Q to make the form classical), there exists m ∈Z (depending on r) such that mQ is the
sum of squares of linear forms with Z-coeﬃcients. Thus, if Q is universal over K, then every element
of mO+
K is the sum of squares. By Corollary 8 there are only ﬁnitely many such ﬁelds of given degree
d.
□
5. Weak Kitaoka’s conjecture
Let us use the results obtained in the previous section to prove our Theorem 3. However, ﬁrst we
need to recall a (mostly well-known) fact concerning sublattices.
Lemma 10. Let F be a totally real number ﬁeld. Let d, r ∈N and let ℓbe an OF -lattice of rank r.
There exists a positive integer m such that for every totally real extension K ⊃F of degree d and
OK-lattice M of rank r satisfying ℓ⊗OK ⊂M we have mM ⊂ℓ⊗OK.

6
V´ITˇEZSLAV KALA AND PAVLO YATSYNA
Proof. Let LK = ℓ⊗OK. By deﬁnition, we have (vℓ)OK = vLK, and [OM, 82:11] gives
(2)
(vℓ)OK = vLK = a2vM,
where a is an integral ideal (equal to the product of the invariant factors of LK in M [OM, §81D]). As
we assume that all lattices satisfy nM ⊂OK, we can use [OM, 82:19] to obtain v(2M) = 2r(vM) ⊂OK.
By (2), the integral ideal v(2M) divides 2r(vℓ)OK, and so there are only ﬁnitely many possibilities
for it. [OM, 103:4] says that there are only ﬁnitely many OK-lattices of given volume and integral
scale. As the OK-lattice 2M has integral scale and bounded volume, there are also only ﬁnitely many
possibilities for M.
Thus there are only ﬁnitely many possibilities for the (subgroup) index (M : LK); taking m to
be the least common divisor of all the possible indices, we get mM ⊂(M : LK)M ⊂LK as we
wanted.
□
Our ﬁnal tool will be the notion of a “universality criterion set”:
Deﬁnition 11. Let K be a totally real number ﬁeld. A universality criterion set in K is a ﬁnite set
SK ⊂O+
K such that if an OK-lattice represents all elements of SK, then it is universal.
Note that in the deﬁnition, SK is not required to be minimal or unique. As an example, let us
mention that by the 290-Theorem by Bhargava and Hanke [BH] we can take SQ = {1, . . . , 290}.
The existence of a universality criterion set in any totally real number ﬁeld was probably ﬁrst
mentioned by Kim, Kim, and Oh [KKO] (see also [Km, Section 6]), with the name coming from
[EKK]. The existence was recently proved by Chan and Oh [CO, Corollary 5.8].
For a matrix M, let K(M) be the number ﬁeld extension of K generated by all the entries of M.
Theorem 12. For each d ∈N, there are only ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds K of degree
d = [K : Q] over which there is a ternary universal OK-lattice.
Proof. Most of the proof will consist of inductively deﬁning ﬁnite sets Ai, Fi, Hi (throughout the proof,
we view also the empty set as ﬁnite) of number ﬁelds of degree ≤d with the following property:
If K is a number ﬁeld of degree ≤d that admits a ternary universal OK-lattice L, then
(1) K ∈Ai, or
(2) there is F ∈Hi, F ⊊K with a ternary universal OF -lattice ℓsuch that ℓ⊗OK ⊂L, or
(3) there are kj ∈Fj, j = 0, . . . , i, such that k0 ⊊k1 ⊊· · · ⊊ki ⊊K.
Let us denote the set of number ﬁelds K satisfying item (2) (item (3), resp.) by Bi (Ci, resp.). We
do not claim (yet) that Bi or Ci is necessarily ﬁnite.
Let us start the construction with A0 = H0 = ∅and F0 = {Q}. Note that if K is a number ﬁeld
with a ternary universal OK-lattice, then K ̸= Q, and so K satisﬁes item (3) for i = 0, as Q = k0 ⊊K.
Let further K ̸∈Ai admit a ternary universal OK-lattice L. We do not need to consider ﬁelds
K ∈Bi (i.e., satisfying item (2) above), for we will have Hi+1 ⊃Hi by our construction, and so
Bi ⊂Bi+1.
Thus consider K ∈Ci and accordingly take some k = ki ∈Fi such that k ⊊K. Let Sk be the
corresponding universality criterion set. The universal OK-lattice L represents all elements s ∈Sk,
i.e., there are vs ∈L such that Q(vs) = s. Let M = (B(vs, vt)) be the corresponding Gram matrix.
Further let B(vs, vt) = mst/2 for s ̸= t and mss = s ∈Sk so that mst ∈OK for all s, t.
As L is totally positive deﬁnite, for each s, t ∈Sk we have the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality m2
st ⪯4st,
and so TrK/Q(m2
st) ≤maxs,t∈Sk 4 TrK/Q(st) ≤maxs,t∈Sk 4d Trk/Q(st) is bounded.
Since mst is an
algebraic integer of degree ≤d, there are only ﬁnitely many possibilities for it (that do not depend on
K). Thus there are also only ﬁnitely many possibilities for the ﬁeld k(M) ⊂K.
Let us next distinguish three cases according to whether we have equality in any of the inclusions
k ⊂k(M) ⊂K:
a) To deal with the case k(M) = K, let Ai+1 be the union of Ai with all these ﬁelds k(M) as k
runs through Fi. Therefore if moreover K ̸∈Ai+1, then k(M) is a proper subﬁeld of K.
b) Assume now that k(M) = k and consider the Ok-span ℓof all vectors vs for s ∈Sk (as a subset
of L). Then ℓ(equipped with the restrictions of B, Q) is an Ok-lattice (for all entries of the Gram
matrix M lie in k) that represents all elements of Sk. By the assumption that Sk is a universality
criterion set for k, the Ok-lattice ℓis universal over k.

Then ℓ⊗OK is a sublattice of the ternary lattice L, and so the rank of ℓis also 3 (no universal
lattice has rank ≤2, and rank of ℓ≤rank of L = 3). Thus we can let Hi+1 be the union of Hi with
all these ﬁelds k(M) = k as k runs through Fi.
c) Finally, we are left with the case k ⊊k(M) ⊊K.
Then let Fi+1 be the set of these ﬁelds
ki+1 = k(M), i.e., k ⊊ki+1 = k(M) ⊊K.
Thus we have deﬁned all the needed sets for i + 1. As there were only ﬁnitely many possibilities for
k(M) (which did not depend on K but only on k ∈Fi), each of the new sets Ai+1, Fi+1, Hi+1 is still
ﬁnite, as we wanted.
Having constructed the desired sets Ai, Fi, Hi, let us now consider them when i = d. Note that no
ﬁeld K satisﬁes (3) for i = d (i.e., Cd = ∅), for otherwise we would have d = [K : Q] ≥[kd : Q] + 1 ≥
[kd−1 : Q] + 2 ≥· · · ≥[k0 : Q] + d + 1, which is impossible.
There are ﬁnitely many ﬁelds K in the ﬁnite set Ad, and so it remains to consider ﬁelds K ∈Bd.
We will prove that there are also ﬁnitely many of them.
The set Hd is ﬁnite, and by Corollary 1 in [Ea], there are only ﬁnitely many ternary universal lattices
over a ﬁxed ﬁeld F ∈Hd. Thus there are ﬁnitely many pairs (F, ℓ) that can appear in item (2).
By Lemma 10 there is m ∈N depending on (F, ℓ) and d, but not on the speciﬁc ﬁeld K or lattice
L, such that if ℓ⊗OK ⊂L (which is true by (2)), then mL ⊂ℓ⊗OK.
As L is universal, ℓ⊗OK represents all elements of mO+
K. But by Theorem 7, there are only ﬁnitely
many such ﬁelds K (and for each of them, there are again at most ﬁnitely many ternary universal
lattices L). Thus, for a ﬁxed pair (F, ℓ), there are at most ﬁnitely many extensions (K, L) (of given
degree d). Thus also item (2) gives only ﬁnitely many ﬁelds K, concluding the proof.
□
Finally, note that essentially the same proof yields the following corollary for ﬁelds of odd degree
(over which there never exists a ternary universal lattice). For classical lattices, this result was proved
by Kim [Ki2].
Corollary 13. For each odd d ∈N, there are only ﬁnitely many totally real number ﬁelds K of degree
d = [K : Q] over which there is a quaternary universal OK-lattice.
Proof. The proof is almost verbatim the same as the proof of Theorem 12, replacing “ternary” by
“quaternary” everywhere in the proof (and adding the requirement that all number ﬁelds considered
have odd degree). As K is assumed to have odd degree, all its subﬁelds also have odd degree, and so
do not admit a ternary universal lattice [EK, Lemma 3]. Thus the lattice ℓconsidered in part b) of
the preceding proof must have rank 4. Finally, towards the end of the proof one uses [EK, Theorem 1]
instead of [Ea, Corollary 1].
