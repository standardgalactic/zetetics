Abstract: This paper explains the Random Field Ising Model simulations of a two-
dimensional ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interface, inﬂuenced by the exchange-bias
interaction.
Exchange-biased shifts, coercivity ﬁelds, the number of unreversed spins
as well as the numerical errors are provided. These were tested for diﬀerent structure
dimensions and boundary conditions in order to ﬁnd limitations of the method.
The
algorithm developed is simple, very eﬀective, and provides deeper insight into the nature
of the exchange-bias phenomenon.

Introduction
The phenomenon of exchange-bias (EB) was discovered a relatively long time ago by W.
H. Meiklejohn and C. P. Bean in 1956 [1-2]. However, it still attracts special attention due
to its application in the high-tech magneto-electronic industry, for example, in reading
heads of hard disks, spin valves and magnetic ﬁeld sensors [3-7]. Importantly, the EB
eﬀect which takes place at a ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic interface, was established as
a standard component for low-dimensional devices like magnetic memories and magnetic
tunnel junctions, although some of them are still at a prototype level in development. The
exchange-bias can be deﬁned as a ferromagnetic material hysteresis-loop shift along the

external ﬁeld axis, with an associated enhancement of a coercive ﬁeld, in a set of coupled
ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ﬁlms [8-9]. This can be accessed after
the deposition of layers in the presence of an externally applied magnetic ﬁeld, or during
layers cooling below the N´eel temperature of AFM in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.
Studies of exchange-bias, despite intense experimental work, are supported by nume-
rical simulation, which can be subdivided into three main areas: calculations from ﬁrst
principles on the basis of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation supported by the
ﬁnite-element method [10-11], the Monte-Carlo simulation with a heat-bath algorithm
and a single-spin ﬂip dynamics [12-15], and approaches that are based on the Random
Field Ising Model (RFIM) [16-19]. The second of the just mentioned approaches eﬀec-
tively supported the Domain State Model (DSM) of the exchange-bias [14-15]. In this
model an antiferromagnetic bulk region, and its magnetic domain structure, inﬂuences
the FM/AFM interface. Recently, the DSM was veriﬁed in experiments in the diluted
Co/CoO structures [20-21].
The most striking feature of exchange-bias is that it can take place on both compensa-
ted and uncompensated interfaces, as well as, on both smooth and rough interfaces. For
example, on a compensated interface, there is no net magnetisation of an antiferromagne-
tic side and consequently no magnetisation to bias a hysteresis loop. Some explanations to
this eﬀect come from diﬀerent models describing not perfect interface, or antiferromagne-
tic domains with walls parallel to an interface, or ﬁnally, with domain walls perpendicular
to an interface. Some of these models assume existence of some kind disorder within bulk
of an antiferromagnetic region. The most advanced and well working DSM model assu-
mes basically existence of domain walls passing through diluted, non-magnetic sites, and
not perfect interface. The DSM model not only explains the inﬂuence of a bulk on the
FM/AFM interface, but also proves that bulk AFM disorder reduces the system’s energy
to its minimum thus maintaining a stable structure.
This paper presents those results derived from the simplest approach, the RFIM me-
thod. This method was applied to a single layer of ferromagnetic spins which where atta-
ched to the static, antiferromagnetic region demonstrating no deﬁned internal structure.
However, its inﬂuence on the FM layer is represented by enhanced coupling constants
between FM spins. This is accomplished from a whole structure at randomly selected
locations using an assumed ratio. In general, such an approach to the RFIM in exchange-
bias simulations was developed for the ﬁrst time by X. Illa et al. [19].
The derived similarities and diﬀerences as well as additional results, especially in
reference to DSM, will be discussed.
Physical conclusions describing the relationship
between simulated exchange-bias and the FM/AFM interface will be provided at the
end of this paper. The main purpose of this paper is to provide information regarding
possible errors that may occur for given boundary conditions and structure dimensions.
Error identiﬁcation is important for proper interpretation of results.
In practice, the
established parameters determine additionally the time of calculation. It should be also
clearly stated that provided algorithm doesn’t simulate a training eﬀect, which is a natural
feature of exchange-bias – conﬁgurations chosen randomly at the beginning are kept to

the end of simulation. This is the limit of this model.

Description of the applied algorithm
The dynamic behavior of the FM layer was inﬂuenced by two assumed factors. First of all,
at random positions, an exchange constant between neighboring FM spins was enhanced
from its normal 1 value to a larger value, for example 6 or so, but no larger than 25. This
limit was quite arbitrary, but for larger values, the spins at these random positions were
completely irreversible and the probability of a reversal during changes of an externally
simulated magnetic ﬁeld fell to zero. It was checked that for values of coupling constants
larger than about 12, spins are blocked and the eﬀect is saturated. In other words, the
spin-reversal was blocked and the spin was unreversed. The external ﬁeld was changed
from +3 to -3 (in arbitrary units) and back, to produce hysteresis loops. To visualize
this type of dynamic, a section of the spins within the 1% - 10% range was tested and
labeled as the global dilution level p. The enhanced coupling constant is labeled as the
local dilution eﬃciency JE. Fig. 1a provides examples of simulated loops for the local
dilution eﬃciencies equal to 1, 6, 12 and 25. Fig. 1b shows results for diﬀerent levels
of a global dilution, here equal to 1%, 2%, 4% and 10% (or 0.01, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.10)
for the constant local dilution eﬃciency equal to 10. The second factor inﬂuencing FM
layer was an atomic roughness at the FM/AFM interface. This was represented by values
of a local magnetic ﬁeld expressed by random numbers with Gaussian distribution with
the mean equal to zero, and with an assumed standard deviation. Finally, the complete
magnetic ﬁeld, at a given point of a structure, was a superposition of these two above
factors, random and Gaussian, and an externally applied magnetic ﬁeld value.
Thus, the ﬁeld at an arbitrary structure position (i) was equal to
Hi =
j=4
X
j=1
JijSj + hG
ij + Hext,
(1)
where Jij is the exchange constant (coupling constant) randomly enhanced to the JE >
Jij = 1 value, Sj is the spin with its +1 or –1 value, hG
ij is the Gaussian distributed ﬁeld
value representing atomic roughness at the FM/AFM interface, and Hext is the externally
applied magnetic ﬁeld. A spin reversal, at a given point, was possible, when the total ﬁeld
changed its algebraic sign. Thus from (1) results the following Hamiltonian of a system
H =

i, j
JijSiSj −

During simulations, the exchange-bias ﬁeld was calculated using the following formula
HEB = 0.5 · (Hleft + Hright),
(3)
where Hleft and Hright are the points, at which FM magnetisation is equal to zero. A
distance between these points also indicates the hysteresis-loop coercivity. The whole

150

magnetisation of system was calculated as the algebraic sum of spins divided by the
structure square-dimension.
For clariﬁcation, for large external ﬁelds, a system of FM spins can be reversed almost
completely. Fig. 1c provides a case where this ﬁeld was changed within the (+10, -10)
range: for JE=1, where saturation regions are very wide, and for JE=10, where bias
is expected. It means that for large enough ﬁelds, in a real E-B device, a loop will be
symmetrical, will have a larger coercivity, but will no longer have a functional E-B device.

Numerical limits. Structure dimensions and boundary con-
ditions
A basic question that is posed at the initial attemt of such simulations containing a two-
dimensional set of spins, is how structure dimension inﬂuence the accuracy of numerical
results and subsequently physical conclusions. These thoughts lead to how a choice of
boundary conditions superimposed on the structure can inﬂuence possible uncertainties
and results.
To answer the ﬁrst question, a set of structure edge-lengths from 20 to 60, with a step
equal to 5, was tested. Additionally, dimensions of 70 and those equal to 100 were then
evaluated. For each dimension the following quantities were calculated: the exchange-
biased shift of a hysteresis-loop, the coercivity ﬁeld, and the number of unreversed spins
during changes of an applied magnetic ﬁeld from its maximum value – when all spins
were in the saturated +1 position - to its minimum. Numerical experiments, such as the
ones described above, were repeated 20 times for a given set of input parameters. Next,
the standard deviation at a level of conﬁdence equal to 0.7 was calculated for a shift, a
coercivity, and unreversed spins.
To answer the second question, three types of periodic boundary conditions super-
imposed on ferromagnetic layer edges, were selected. They were: the one-dimensional
condition of the Born-Karman type, the two-dimensional condition valid for the two pa-
irs of parallel-edges, and ﬁnally, calculations without any periodic conditions. In each
described case, a spin at a corner interacted with two neighbors, a spin located at an
edge interacted with three neighbors, and a spin inside the structure interacted with four
directly neighboring spins.
Simulated hysteresis-loops are described in Fig. 2 for the speciﬁed structure dimen-
sions and for all three types of boundary conditions. Next, results are depicted in Fig.
3a for the exchange-bias, in Fig. 3b for its error, in Fig. 4a for the coercivity ﬁeld, in
Fig. 4b for its error, in Fig. 5a for number of unreversed spins, and in Fig. 5b for errors
in this irreversibility. Finally, Tab. 1 provides, complementing Fig. 2, numerical values
along with appropriate errors. A ﬁrst look at Fig. 2 can suggest that simulations con-
ducted in the 20x20 structure are very rough. It is surprising, the 100x100 results were
in general less accurate than those made in the 50x50 structure. As these conclusions
are approximated, they can not be acknowledged as accurate calculated results. The
averaged numerical results are provided in the next ﬁgures (Fig. 3 – Fig. 5). Looking

151
at these results, there is a tendency for errors to decrease with a weak saturation. This
saturation is obvious for the exchange-bias and coercivity ﬁeld results. For the results
of the number of unreversed spins, the saturation in errors is diﬃcult to estimate. In
summary, the stabilization of results for larger structures is obvious for the exchange-bias
(Fig. 3a), the coercivity ﬁeld (Fig. 4a), and the number of unreversed spins (Fig. 5a).
The 50x50 structure seems to be a reasonable choice in order to achieve accurate physical
results. Looking at numerical values, provided in Table 1, we see no striking diﬀerences
seem to be evident within the estimated errors. However, the one-dimensional periodic
condition of the Born-Karman type possesses important and strict physical meaning in
solid state physics. This is why this was applied in simulations and subsequent discussion
of the physical meaning of the results.

Conclusions and discussion of the physical meaning of the
results
For the above described assumptions, especially for that of locally enhanced coupling
constants, the starting phase of simulations can be presented in Fig. 6a, and Fig. 6b with
initial distribution of randomly enhanced constants, and associated places of enhanced
exchange energy, respectively. There is an obvious correlation between both quantities.
Similar information is depicted in Fig. 7a and in Fig. 7b, but for a larger global dilution.
Next, there exists another clear equivalence between initial exchange energy distributions

152
T. B lachowicz / Central European Journal of Physics 3(2) 2005 147–162
(Fig. 6b, Fig. 7b) and spin conﬁgurations at an externally applied ﬁeld minimum (Fig.
6c, Fig. 7c). This means that spins were blocked at places correlated with the enhanced
coupling constants.
Additionally, what is especially interesting, during the reverse increase of an external
magnetic ﬁeld, is that another set of spins was blocked at their –1 orientation. Such spins
are located in neighbors of previously blocked spins at a +1 orientation. From a numerical
point of view this phenomenon seems natural, because enhanced coupling constants and
an atomic roughness were set up at the beginning of the simulation and were kept during
the duration.
The present results seem to correlate with the Domain State Model. In this model
there exists a distinction between AFM interfacial spins and those located in the bulk
region of the AFM. It was proven there that the interface magnetization carries the
irreversible part leading to exchange-bias. This eﬀect possess authentic counterparts not
only in single crystal layers but even in polycrystalline structures in which some grains are
stable, which gave rise to exchange-bias as well as other part which are reversible under
external ﬁeld changes [22]. Simple calculations of a bias ﬁeld, under the assumption of
irreversibility of some interfacial AFM spins, lead to following estimation of the EB eﬀect
[8, 14-15]
tF MBEB = JINTmINT,
(4)
where tF M is the number of FM layers, BEB is the exchange-bias shift, JINT is the
FM/AFM interface coupling, and mINT is the stable part of an interface magnetisation.
This result shows that the exchange-bias ﬁeld is linearly proportional to the irreversible
part of an interface magnetisation. It is known, however, that this estimate leads to a
much too high EB at the fully uncompensated interface, and to an entirely too low value
of EB for ideally compensated surfaces.
In contrast, what was simulated within the current method is that exchange-bias
at the interface correlates not quite linearly with the number of unreversed spins and
with a structure dilution. It can be modiﬁed by two factors: the global dilution, which
is equivalent to the DSM dilution, and the local dilution eﬃciency.
The local factor
describes a situation, when a perfect AFM structure can be diluted by various atomic
substitutions: Mg, Cu or others. This suggests that it is possible to make the AFM
structure magnetically more or less stable. This is a novel approach. However, biasing
depends on both factors mentioned above. Fig. 8 summarizes these results. It provides a
relationship between interface exchange-bias, number of unreversed spins, global dilution
and the locally enhanced exchange constant.
Within the scope of the current paper some numerical limits for a relatively simple
RFIM approach were tested. It was proven that for large enough structure dimensions,
errors are saturated, and boundary conditions are not so important for obtained physical
conclusions. It was a presentation of the two-dimensional FM/AFM behaviors, where
stable disorder at the interface blocked a part of FM spins and resulted in exchange-bias.
