Abstract
Continuing previous work, a model independent analysis of the solar neutrino anomaly is
performed in terms of neutrino oscillations, allowing a comparison with the predictions
of the Standard Solar Model. SMA and LMA solutions emerge also in this case, although
somewhat diﬀerent from the standard ones. The signiﬁcance of the NC/CC double ratio
measurable in SNO is illustrated in this context.

Introduction and motivations
Flavour neutrino oscillations continue to be a pretty con-
troversial matter. It is fair to recall that, so far, no direct
signal of them, like neutrino appearance or explicit os-
cillation patterns, have been observed either in solar or
in atmospheric neutrinos. The up/down asymmetry of
the ﬂux of the atmospheric νµ and ¯νµ neutrinos gives,
however, an indisputable evidence for the presence of
an atmospheric neutrino anomaly. No equally clear ev-
idence has been found, on the other hand, for the solar
neutrino anomaly [1, 2, 3, 4], since its standard interpre-
tation relies on a combination of many diﬀerent exper-
imental and theoretical ingredients. Furthermore, the
LNSD result still awaits for an independent conﬁrma-
tion.
On the solar neutrinos, which are the subject of this
paper, quite diﬀerent attitudes can be taken, depending
on the weight one gives to the input of the Standard
Solar Model (SSM) [5]. On one side, it does not look
reasonable to consider the solar neutrino anomaly as an
artifact due to a large unknown error in solar models or
in solar neutrino experiments. The other extreme atti-
tude is to assume that all the ingredients of the analy-
sis are correct, thus obtaining a rather precise determi-
nation of the neutrino oscillation parameters. As well
known, the best ﬁts of the solar neutrino deﬁcit in this
framework are given by few peculiar energy-dependent
survival probabilities.
The truth is that unfortunately, so far, SuperKamio-
kande (SK) has not found any evidence for a distortion
of the energy spectrum, nor for Earth regeneration ef-
fects, nor for seasonal variations of the neutrino ﬂux.
Furthermore, the most recent SK data [2, 4] worsen the
quality of the best ﬁt, with the net result that the new
best ﬁt regions now include values of the oscillation pa-

rameters previously discarded on the basis of the sole
neutrino rates. Recent analyses found that all the dis-
tinct best ﬁt solutions have a high goodness-of-ﬁt prob-
ability [6]. However, at least in part, this is just a re-
ﬂection of having ﬁtted the few really problematic data
together with many other ‘degrees of freedom’ that have
not much to do with the problem. To really judge the
quality of the ﬁt one should perform a more complete
statistical analysis or rewrite the data in terms of a min-
imal set of ‘optimal’ observables∗.
In view of this situation, we ﬁnd it useful to come
back to an analysis which has minimal dependence upon
the SSM inputs.
This is the purpose of this paper,
continuing previous work along similar lines. From an
experimental point of view, the main new information
comes from the SK measurements, mentioned above, of
the energy spectrum and of day/night or seasonal varia-
tions of the neutrino ﬂux. Their interpretation has little
to do with the theoretical input of the SSM.
The SSM independent analysis is performed in sec-
tion 2. In section 3 we discuss its implications for new
solar experiments. Conclusions are drawn in section 4.
In appendix A we describe the details of the computa-
tion. In appendix B we discuss how KamLand and neu-
trino factories can test a high value of ∆m2
12 >∼10−4 eV2,
allowed by solar data in presence of an undetected sys-
tematic error in the Chlorine experiment.
Fitting the solar, atmospheric and LSND anomalies
with neutrino oscillations consistently with all bounds
would require more than 3 neutrinos and peculiar mod-
els. We limit ourselves to oscillations between the 3 SM
active neutrinos and we await for a conﬁrmation of the
LSND result [7], disregarded in the following. We use
∗A similar comment can be done for atmospheric neutrinos.
It is hard to judge if the ντ →νsterile interpretation gives an
acceptable ﬁt by looking only at the minimal χ2 of a global ﬁt
that includes electron data, low energy data and too many zenith
angle bins.

atmospheric neutrinos.

SSM independent analysis
One can perform a useful almost SSM independent anal-
ysis [9, 8] by just treating the overall 8B and 7Be ﬂuxes
as unknown quantities, to be extracted from the data.
Here we brieﬂy recall how this procedure is justiﬁed
(see [8] for explanations and references). First, it is safe
to use the standard spectral functions for the energy
distributions of the single components
i = {pp,
pep,
7Be,
13N,
15O,
17F,
8B,
hep}
of the solar neutrino ﬂux, while the total ﬂux Φi of each
component is regarded as unknown. Second, it is safe
to set to their standard values the ratios Φ13N/Φ15O and
Φpep/Φpp, to neglect 17F neutrinos and to consider hep
neutrinos only when computing the upper tail of the en-
ergy spectrum of recoil electrons in SK. Although to a
somewhat lesser extent, it is also safe to set Φ13N/Φ7Be
to its standard value. Finally the solar luminosity con-
straint allows to express the pp ﬂux in terms of the re-
maining free parameters Φ7Be and Φ8B.
This kind of analysis is useful because solar neu-
trino rates have been measured by three diﬀerent kinds
of experiments. For any given oscillation pattern, each
measured rate gives an allowed band in the (Φ8B, Φ7Be)
plane (few examples are shown in ﬁg. 2).
Requiring
a crossing of all the three experimental bands selects
speciﬁc oscillation patterns. In this way one converts
experimental data into informations on the oscillation
parameters and on the neutrino ﬂuxes Φ8B and Φ7Be.
This kind of analysis will become more powerful when
the SNO and Borexino experiments will present their
data. Already now the results are much more restric-
tive than two years ago [8]. SK and Gallium experiments
have measured more precisely their ﬂuxes and the new
SK data now exclude in a SSM independent way a large
part of the oscillation parameter space where MSW ef-
fects are large.
Furthermore, the CHOOZ bound on ¯νe disappear-
ance [10] now holds for all values of the mass splitting
∆m2
13 allowed by the SK atmospheric data. This was
not the case one year ago, and implies that θ13 is small,
θ13 < 15◦at 95% C.L. Therefore θ13 can only have a mi-
nor impact on solar neutrino experiments. Unless oth-
erwise indicated we will assume that θ13 = 0.
The best-ﬁt values of the neutrino ﬂuxes Φ8B and
Φ7Be are shown in ﬁg. 1. The regions delimited by con-
tinuous (dashed) lines give the best ﬁt at 90% (99%)
C.L.† The ellipses represent the 90% and 99% C.L. SSM
prediction for these ﬂuxes [5]:
Φ8B|SSM
=
5.15 (1+0.19
−0.14) · 106/ cm2s,
(2a)
Φ7Be|SSM
=
4.8(1 ± 0.09) · 109/ cm2s
(2b)
A standard analysis would include these theoretical con-
straints in the χ2, forcing Φ8B and Φ7Be to be close to
the SSM predictions.
Fig. 1 shows that the best ﬁt regions are neither far
from the SSM predictions of eq. (2) nor peaked around
them.
This reﬂects the fact that oscillation patterns
that gave the best standard ﬁts of the measured neutrino
rates are now disfavoured by the SK SSM-independent
data. Basically there are two distinct best-ﬁt regions in
ﬁg. 1:
• A region with Φ8B > 5 · 106/ cm2s and Φ7Be <
5 · 109/ cm2s produced by values of the mixing pa-
rameters around the LMA solution. Fig. 2b shows
how a perfect crossing of the three experimental
bands occur around Φ8B ≈7.5 · 106/ cm2s and
Φ7Be ≈3 · 109/ cm2s. This crossing is obtained for
∆m2
12 = 4 · 10−5 eV2 and θ12 = 0.42. The stan-
dard analysis requires a crossing centered around
the SSM prediction: the best ﬁt is obtained for
†The contour lines are drawn at ∆χ2 levels that correspond to
90% and 99% C.L., if one converts values of ∆χ2 into “best ﬁt
probabilities” p using the standard expressions valid for a gaussian
probability distribution. This is not a good approximation since,
as frequently happens in solar neutrino ﬁts, one ﬁnds few separate
best-ﬁt solutions, while a gaussian would have only one peak. A
proper treatment would shift the values of 1 −p by relative O(1)
factors. A comparable shift would arise if we performed an exact
marginalization of the joint probability distribution with respect
to the oscillation parameters. We neglect such corrections, since
they are comparable to the uncertainties of Bayesian inference
arising from the need of choosing some prior distribution function.

a slightly larger values of θ12 and gives the worse
crossing shown in ﬁg. 2a.
• A region with Φ8B ∈[2.5 . . . 4] · 106/ cm2s pro-
duced by values of the mixing parameters around
the SMA solution. The best crossing, obtained for
θ12 = 0.025 and ∆m2
12 = 0.5 · 10−5 eV2 is shown
in ﬁg. 2c. It also gives the best standard ﬁt. The
previous best standard ﬁt had larger θ12 = 0.04
and gave a crossing perfectly centered on the SSM
prediction (see ﬁg. 1c in [8]), but is incompatible
with the day/night and spectral SK data.
Oscillation patterns around the LOW region (i.e. the
one with large θ12 and ∆m2 <∼10−7 eV2) give a modest
ﬁt with Φ8B ≈(4 ÷ 5) · 106/ cm2s (see ﬁg. 2d).
Before going on, it is useful to consider the region
around Φ8B ≈3 · 106/ cm2s and Φ7Be ≈0.
This re-
gion appears due to a unfortunate weakness of our SSM-
independent analysis: assuming no oscillations, the three
bands perfectly cross at Φ8B ≈3 · 106/ cm2s and Φ7Be
slightly negative. Therefore the no-oscillation case can-
not be excluded at a high conﬁdence level and vari-
ous oscillations patterns not much diﬀerent from the
no-oscillation case provide acceptable ﬁts. We consider
such crossings as unfortunate accidents. Before ﬁtting
the mixing angles, we exclude by hand such cases by im-
posing Φ8B > 0 and Φ7Be > 1.5 109/cm2 s rather than
Φ7Be > 0. This does not conﬂict much with our purpose
of performing a SSM-independent analysis, since very
low values of the 7Be ﬂux are unphysical, as the Boron
neutrinos, seen in SK, originate from the Berillium ones
to a large extent.
Fig. 3 shows the ﬁt in the usual plane of the mixing
parameters θ12 and ∆m2
12: the standard ﬁt is shown
in ﬁg. 3a and the the solar-model independent ﬁt in
ﬁg. 3b. The best ﬁt regions are not entirely restricted
to θ12 < π/4 [11].
Concerning the standard ﬁt, we mention an impor-
tant detail not immediately apparent from the ﬁgure.
Like other standard ﬁts [6], our ﬁt still contains a SMA
region, even if the SK spectrum and day/night data have
excluded the ‘old SMA’ region with larger θ12. The ‘old
SMA’ gave such a good standard ﬁt of solar rates that
values of θ12 previously regarded as ‘too small’ now give
an acceptable standard ﬁt of solar rates. This is why we
obtain a new best-ﬁt SMA region, more SMA than the
old one (see ﬁg. 4a). Fig. 2c explains why such smaller
values of θ12 were discarded in old standard ﬁts but not
in old SSM-independent ﬁts: they give a good crossing
of the three experimental bands, but at a value of the
Boron ﬂux smaller than the one predicted by the SSM.
This means that the SK spectrum and day/night data
are not a problem for the solar-model independent SMA
region.‡. Non-zero values of θ13 just below the CHOOZ
bound slightly shift the crossing point towards higher
Boron ﬂuxes, and therefore slightly improve the quality
of the standard ﬁt in the SMA region.
Presently the LOW solution gives a better standard
ﬁt than the SMA solution [6]. Fig. 2d shows how the
three experimental bands cross in the case of the ‘best
standard ﬁt’ LOW solution, θ12 = 0.66 and ∆m2
12 =
0.8 10−7 eV2.
The crossing is not good, but roughly
centered on the SSM prediction. A solar-model inde-
pendent analysis does not reward this property.
The
best SSM-independent ﬁt in the LOW region has larger
θ12 and lower Φ7Be than in the standard ﬁt.
The band corresponding to the Ga experiment in
ﬁg. 2d (the almost horizontal one) is not unacceptably
high because Earth-regeneration eﬀects strongly aﬀect
neutrinos with energies Eν ≈MeV(∆m2/4 10−7 eV2).
Unfortunately radiochemical experiments, which detect
such neutrinos, cannot study day/night eﬀects. Earth-
regeneration gives a <∼10% seasonal variation of the
capture rate in GNO, since at Gran Sasso nights are
longer in winter than in summer [12]. Gallex does not
see such an eﬀect. Present data from all Gallium exper-
iments could be sensitive to a 10% seasonal variation.
‡This discussion implies that the sterile neutrino interpretation
of the solar neutrino anomaly is disfavoured by SK only if one
imposes the SSM value of the Boron ﬂux.

Expectations for SNO
The fact that the SMA solution has migrated toward
smaller values of θ12, previously considered only in SSM-
independent analyses [8], has signiﬁcant implications for
the SNO experiment.
Previous studies of the signiﬁ-
cance of the SNO experiment [13] found that only a
global ﬁt of various SNO precision observables could
eventually discriminate between the SMA and the LMA
solutions.
On the contrary, we think that it is quite possible at
SNO to discriminate between the new LMA and the new
SMA solution§ or even ﬁnd evidence for oscillation pat-
terns suggested by our solar-model independent analysis
by making use of the NC/CC double ratio
r ≡
(NC rate)/(CC rate)
(NC rate)/(CC rate)no oscillation
.
r is an interesting observable because dominant theo-
retical uncertainties cancel out when taking the double
ratio, and because expected oscillation eﬀects can be
very large so that one does not need a very precise de-
termination.
In order to perform a quantitative analysis, we com-
pute the values of r and of the χ2-probability
p ≡exp(−∆χ2/2)
for a grid of oscillation patterns in the SMA and in the
LMA regions. The ∆χ2 is computed with respect to the
local LMA or SMA minimal χ2, so that p = 1 in the
best-ﬁt SMA point and in the best-ﬁt LMA point. We
assume an energy threshold Te > 5 MeV on the recoil
electrons originating from CC interactions νed →ppe,
but our ﬁnal results do not depend on this choice.
§This observation was also made in a recent paper [14].
In ﬁg. 4b,c we plot p(r), the maximal value of p at
which any value of r can be reached in the LMA and
in the SMA region. The χ2 is computed performing a
standard analysis. In ﬁg. 4b we have included the most
recent SK data, while in ﬁg. 4c we have not included
them. Fig. 4b shows that there is now a neat separation
between SMA and LMA predictions: measuring r < 2
or r > 2 would have clear implications. A measurement
of r can also provide a signal for non standard solutions.
Dividing the possible values of r in 5 distinct ranges, we
can summarize the situation in the following way:
1. values of r very close to 1 are allowed in the non
standard part of the SSM-independent SMA re-
gion (with smaller θ12 and low 8B ﬂux). Oscilla-
tions into sterile neutrinos would also give r = 1.
2. 1 < r < 2 is allowed in the standard or SSM-
independent SMA region.
3. r very close to 2 is the value predicted by the
non standard solution with high ∆m2
12 and θ12 ≈
π/4 [8, 15], allowed in presence of an undetected
systematic error in the Chlorine experiment.
4. 2 < r < 4 is allowed in the standard or SSM-
independent LMA region;
5. 4 < r < 5 is still allowed in the non standard part
of the LMA region;
For completeness it should be said that values of r be-
tween 1.5 and 3 are expected also in the standard LOW
region.
The SNO experiment will improve also the experi-
mental knowledge of the solar neutrino ﬂuxes. The NC
rate is not aﬀected by oscillations between active neutri-
nos, and therefore provides a measurement of the Boron
ﬂux. It is expected to have a <∼10% systematic error,

mainly due to the uncertainty in the detection cross sec-
tion [13]. Due to the large spread between the values of
the Boron ﬂux required by the diﬀerent oscillation pat-
terns (see ﬁg. 1) this measurement will also have a sig-
niﬁcant impact. In particular the SMA solution requires
low values of the Boron ﬂux.
The Borexino experiment will be mainly sensitive
to the Berillium component of the solar neutrino ﬂux.
Therefore its data will be represented by one quasi-
horizontal band in ﬁg.s 2, at a level dependent on the ac-
tual oscillation pattern. Although the main features can
be seen already from ﬁg.s 1 and 2, a true understanding
of the impact of Borexino data on a SSM-independent
analysis will require a combined ﬁt of the oscillation pa-
rameters and of the neutrino ﬂuxes.
The KamLand reactor experiment [21] will measure
accurately the oscillation parameters, if they lie in the
LMA region (see ﬁg. 8). In this case, the solar neutrino
data will give the 8B and 7Be solar ﬂuxes. In partic-
ular, the Borexino data will be crucial for an accurate
determination of the 7Be ﬂux.

Conclusions
The SK measurements of the energy spectrum and of
day/night and seasonal variations of the neutrino ﬂux
have not realized, so far, any “smoking gun” in the study
of the solar neutrino problem. Nevertheless these mea-
surements provide signiﬁcant information, since inde-
pendent from theoretical models. Their use, combined
with a proper treatment of all the diﬀerent rate mea-
surements allows an almost direct determination of the
preferred values of the 8B and 7Be solar neutrino ﬂuxes.
In turn these values can be compared with the SSM ex-
pectations.
This comparison at present is encouraging but far
from conclusive, as illustrated in ﬁg 1. In particular,
also in view of ﬁg. 2, it makes it clear how premature it
is to select one speciﬁc pattern of neutrino oscillations to
explain the solar neutrinos. Nevertheless, data expected
in the near future especially from SNO or from Borex-

Addendum: SNO results
In this addendum, we update our results by adding the
ﬁrst SNO [25] data. The SK collaboration published the
day + night spectral data [26] as 19 + 19 energy bins,
so that we can now include this information in the ﬁt.

12) plane: (a) standard ﬁt;
(b) solar model independent ﬁt; (c) standard ﬁt without including the uncalibrated Chlorine data.
We also explicitly included the CHOOZ data [10], that
disfavour values of ∆m2
12 above 0.7 10−3 eV2 for large
mixing θ12 ∼π/4. Finally, we improved the numerical
accuracy of our computation, and extended it to include
vacuum oscillations [27].
As pointed out in section 3, the measurement of the
NC/CC ratio alone was expected to discriminate be-
tween LMA and SMA. The measured value happens to
fall into case 4. (cases 3. and 5. are not signiﬁcantly dis-
favoured). Therefore the SMA region is now strongly
disfavoured, even from a solar-model-independent point
of view. Furthermore, the solar-model-independent LMA
region (case 5.) no longer gives a best χ2 signiﬁcantly
lower than the standard ﬁt. These results are conﬁrmed
by an updated analysis, as shown in ﬁg. 5 and 6.
In ﬁg. 5 we show the updated ﬁt of the solar neutrino
ﬂuxes. Values of the 8B ﬂux detectably diﬀerent from
the SSM prediction no longer give good ﬁts.
On the
contrary, a discrepancy between the 7Be ﬂux and its
SSM prediction could still have signiﬁcant eﬀects. The
best-ﬁt region at 90% CL in ﬁg. 5 is composed by two
disjoint regions. The one with smaller ﬂuxes is obtained
from vacuum oscillations (but can also be obtained with
LMA, LOW, SMA oscillations with a worse CL). The
one with larger ﬂuxes is obtained from LMA oscillations.
In ﬁg. 6 we show the updated global ﬁts for the os-
cillation parameters: ﬁg. 6a shows a standard ﬁt, while
ﬁg. 6b is the solar model independent ﬁt described in
section 2. In ﬁg. 6c we perform a standard ﬁt, but drop-
ping the uncalibrated Chlorine rate from the ﬁt. The
results of ﬁg.s 6a,b,c are quite similar: more or less ac-
ceptable ﬁts can be obtained for a large range of ∆m2
and large mixing angle, while the SMA solution is al-
ways disfavoured.
Finally, we mention another important aspect of so-
lar model independent analyses. It is sometimes said
that it is useless to measure the Gallium rate with an
error much smaller than the solar model uncertainty.
As explained in section 2 and illustrated in ﬁg.s 2, this
is not true. Fig.s 2 in fact shows that the amount of
information that can be extracted in a solar model in-
dependent way from the solar rates is today limited by
the accuracy of the Chlorine experiment. This limita-
tion will disappear when Borexino will measure the 7Be
ﬂux. Fig.s 6 show that solar model independent con-
siderations already now give useful informations on the
oscillation parameters.

A
Details of the computation
The energy spectra for the independent components of
the solar neutrino ﬂux have been obtained from [16].
The neutrino production has been averaged for each
ﬂux component over the position in the sun as predicted
in [5, 16]. This averaging does not give signiﬁcant correc-
tions. MSW oscillations inside the sun have been taken
into account in the following way. The 3×3 density ma-
trix ρS for neutrinos exiting from the sun is computed
using the Landau-Zener approximation with the level-
crossing probability appropriate for an exponential den-
sity proﬁle [17, 18]. The density proﬁle has been taken
from [16] and is quasi-exponential: small corrections to
ρS have been approximately included. Oscillation eﬀects
outside the sun are described by the evolution matrix U,
so that at the detection point ρE = UρSU †. In particu-
lar, earth regeneration eﬀects have been computed nu-
merically using the mantle-core approximation for the
earth density proﬁle. We have used the tree level Stan-
dard Model expression for the neutrino/electron cross
section at SK. The CC and NC cross sections at SNO
have been taken from [19]. The experimental resolution
at SK and SNO has been included as suggested in [19].
The total neutrino rates measured with the three
kind of experimental techniques are [1, 2, 3, 4]

having combined systematic errors in quadrature with
statistical errors. The SuperKamiokande experimental-
ists give directly the value of the ﬂux they measure.

The other experiments involve more uncertain neutrino
cross sections and prefer to give the frequency of events
measured per target atom in their detector.
The solar model independent SK data included in
the ﬁt are: the energy spectrum of the recoil electrons
(divided in 18 energy bins between 5.5 MeV and 15 MeV)
and the total ﬂux measured at SK during the day and
during ﬁve night bins (deﬁned according to the value of
the cosine of the zenith angle) [2, 4]. The SK collab-
oration can include in their ﬁt data about the zenith
angle variation of the recoil electron spectrum and ex-
clude the old SMA at 95% C.L. With these unpublished
data the standard and the SSM-independent SMA so-
lution would be less attractive and ﬁg. 1 would show a
more neat separation into two distrinct regions.
B
Large ∆m2
12 and nu-factories
The standard interpretation of the solar neutrino anomaly
is based on many experimental and theoretical ingredi-
ents. We have discussed how the SSM predictions can be
tested. There is one other ingredient that could be not
solidly founded and that has a signiﬁcant impact on the
ﬁnal result [8, 15]. Only a single experiment, the Homes-
take one, has detected neutrinos with the Chlorine tech-
nique (with the other techniques, data come from two
water Cerenkov and two Gallium experiments).
Fur-
thermore Homestake is the only experiment that ob-
serves a rate diﬀerent than one half of the SSM pre-
diction in absence of oscillations, therefore excluding an
energy-independent survival probability Pee(Eν) ≈1/2.
This important conclusion could be the result of an
under-estimation of the systematic error, that according
to the Chlorine collaboration [1] is equal to the statis-
tical error. It would be interesting to perform a direct
calibration of the Chlorine detector [20].
Pee(Eν) ≈1/2 can be obtained with θ12 ≈π/4 and
∆m2
12 >∼10−4 eV2. This oscillation pattern has no prob-
lems with the recent SuperKamiokande data so that,
even in a standard analysis, it is no longer signiﬁcantly
worse that the new best ﬁts.
The KamLand experiment [21] will test the LMA
region looking at disappearance of ¯νe reactor neutrinos.
If ∆m2
12 and θ12 lie inside the LMA region, KamLand
can accurately measure them [22]. If instead ∆m2
12 >∼2 ·
10−4 eV2, ¯νe oscillations are averaged so that a measure-
ment of ∆m2
12 needs a good energy resolution, a precise
knowdlege of the un-oscillated spectra, high statistics
and low background. Assuming that these conditions
can be satisﬁed, ﬁg. 8 shows the accuracy at which Kam-
Land can measure few values of ∆m2
12 and θ12 (repre-
sented by the dots) after three years of running (i.e. with
2400 events if no oscillation occur). If ∆m2
12 is too large
statistical ﬂuctuations often lead to discrete ambigui-
ties in its determination. A reactor experiment with a
shorter baseline would not have this problem.
Here, we study the impact of a large ∆m2
12 at a neu-
trino factory [23]. Due to the high beam purity, a neu-
trino factory will allow to study νe →νµ and ¯νe →¯νµ
oscillations down to small values of the oscillation prob-
ability. Extensive studies [23, 24] have determined the
optimal energy and pathlength that give the maximal
sensitivity to a small θ13. If θ13 = 0 ‘solar’ oscillations
give eﬀects ∝(∆m2
12)2 that can be seen at a neutrino

and even for values of ∆m2
12 inside the LMA region,
‘solar’ eﬀects ∝∆m2
12 have a signiﬁcant impact on θ13
measurements at a neutrino factory [24].
The most promising observable for discovering νe →
νµ oscillations is given by µ−appearance at a relatively
short baseline L ≈700 km. The number N(µ−) of µ−
events produced by both ‘solar’ and ‘atmospheric’ oscil-
lations can be approximated by treating θ13 and ∆m2
12
eﬀects as perturbations.

we clearly see in an analytical way how signiﬁcant ∆m2
12
oscillations can be. An analogous approximation holds
for ¯νe →¯νµ signals.
At baselines L >∼103 km matter eﬀects become signif-
icant. Using eq. (4), the number of events due to ∆m2
12
oscillations only can be written as its value at L = 0

which exact numerical value is plotted in ﬁg. 7. There-
fore a short baseline L ≈700 km is optimal for discov-
ering ∆m2
12 eﬀects.
By performing a global ﬁt of simulated nu-factory
data we ﬁnd that it will be diﬃcult to distinguish ∆m2
12
eﬀects from θ13 eﬀects at a good C.L. by comparing data
taken at diﬀerent pathlengths and/or diﬀerent neutrino
energies, as suggested in [24]. For certain values of the
CP violating phase a comparison between νe →νµ and
¯νe →¯νµ rates allows a better discrimination. Such ‘pre-
cision studies’ are statistically signiﬁcant only with a
suﬃcient number of events. For example, observing few
events only would not allow to say if they are due to a
θ13 ≈0.007 around its nominal sensitivity, or due to a
∆m2
12 ≈3 10−4 eV2. In conclusion, if ∆m2 >∼2 10−4 eV2
so that KamLand cannot measure it, an accurate mea-
surement of ∆m2 cannot even be obtained with a neu-
trino factory: a new reactor experiment with intermedi-
ate baseline ∼10 km would be necessary.
If KamLand will give a precise measurement of ∆m2
12
free from discrete ambiguities (this could not be the case
if ∆m2
12 >∼2 · 10−4 eV2), by combining KamLand data
with nu-factory data one can usually obtain a satisfac-
tory ﬁt of θ13 and of the CP violating phase.
