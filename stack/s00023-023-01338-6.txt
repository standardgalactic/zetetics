Abstract. Phase spaces as given by the Wigner distribution function pro-
vide a natural description of inﬁnite-dimensional quantum systems. They
are an important tool in quantum optics and have been widely applied
in the context of time–frequency analysis and pseudo-diﬀerential opera-
tors. Phase-space distribution functions are usually speciﬁed via integral
transformations or convolutions which can be averted and subsumed by
(displaced) parity operators proposed in this work. Building on earlier
work for Wigner distribution functions (Grossmann in Commun Math
Phys 48(3):191–194, 1976. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01617867), parity
operators give rise to a general class of distribution functions in the form
of quantum-mechanical expectation values. This enables us to precisely
characterize the mathematical existence of general phase-space distribu-
tion functions. We then relate these distribution functions to the so-called
Cohen class (Cohen in J Math Phys 7(5):781–786, 1966. https://doi.org/
10.1063/1.1931206) and recover various quantization schemes and distri-
bution functions from the literature. The parity operator approach is also
applied to the Born–Jordan distribution which originates from the Born–
Jordan quantization (Born and Jordan in Z Phys 34(1):858–888, 1925.
https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01328531). The corresponding parity opera-
tor is written as a weighted average of both displacements and squeezing
operators, and we determine its generalized spectral decomposition. This
leads to an eﬃcient computation of the Born–Jordan parity operator in
the number-state basis, and example quantum states reveal unique fea-
tures of the Born–Jordan distribution.

1. Introduction
There are at least three logically independent descriptions of quantum me-
chanics: the Hilbert space formalism [31], the path-integral method [49], and
the phase-space approach such as given by the Wigner function [24,32,52,69,
75,84,109,111,125]. The phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics was
initiated by Wigner in his ground-breaking work [123] from 1932, in which
the Wigner function of a spinless non-relativistic quantum particle was intro-
duced as a quasi-probability distribution. The Wigner function can be used to
express quantum-mechanical expectation values as classical phase-space aver-
ages. More than a decade later, Groenewold [63] and Moyal [99] formulated
quantum mechanics as a statistical theory on a classical phase space by map-
ping a quantum state to its Wigner function and they interpreted this corre-
spondence as the inverse of the Weyl quantization [119–121].
Coherent states have become a natural way to extend phase spaces to
more general physical systems [5,8–11,13,21,54,100]. In this regard, a new
focus on phase-space representations for coupled, ﬁnite-dimensional quantum
systems (as spin systems) [53,76–82,87,106,108,115] and their tomographic
reconstructions [81,85,86,107] has emerged recently. A spherical phase-space
representation of a single, ﬁnite-dimensional quantum system has been used to
naturally recover the inﬁnite-dimensional phase space in the large-spin limit
[78,81]. These spherical phase spaces have been deﬁned in terms of quantum-
mechanical expectation values of rotated parity operators [77,78,81,87,108,
115] (as discussed below) in analogy with displaced reﬂection operators in ﬂat
phase spaces. But in the current work, we exclusively focus on the (usual)
inﬁnite-dimensional case which has Heisenberg–Weyl symmetries [21,54,90,
100]. This case has been playing a crucial role in characterizing the quantum
theory of light [59] via coherent states and displacement operators [3,4,22,23]
and has also been widely used in the context of time–frequency analysis and
pseudo-diﬀerential operators [16–18,28,29,43,44,62]. Many particular phase
spaces have been uniﬁed under the concept of the so-called Cohen class [28,
29,44] (see Deﬁnition 2), i.e., all functions which are related to the Wigner
function via a convolution with a distribution (which is also known as the
Cohen kernel).
Phase-space distribution functions are mostly described by one of the
following three forms: (a) convolved derivatives of the Wigner function [43,44],
(b) integral transformations of a pure state (i.e., a rapidly decaying, complex-
valued function) [16–18,28,29,43,44,123], or (c) as integral transformations
of quantum-mechanical expectation values [3,4,22,23]. Also, Wigner functions
(and the corresponding Weyl quantization) are usually described by integral
transformations. But the seminal work of Grossmann [44,64] (refer also to
[102]) allowed for a direct interpretation of the Wigner function as a quantum-
mechanical expectation value of a displaced parity operator Π (which reﬂects
coordinates Π ψ(x) = ψ(−x) of a quantum state ψ). In particular, Grossmann
[64] showed that the Weyl quantization of the delta distribution determines

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
the parity operator Π. This approach has been widely adopted [15,25,33,36,
52,91,103,104].
However, parity operators similar to the one by Grossmann and Royer
[44,64,102] have still been lacking for general phase-space distribution func-
tions. (Note that such a form appeared implicitly for s-parametrized distri-
bution functions in [22,98].) In the current work, we generalize the previously
discussed parity operator Π [44,64,102] for the Wigner function by introducing
a family of parity operators Πθ (refer to Deﬁnition 3) which is parametrized
by a function or distribution θ. This enables us to specify general phase-space
distribution functions in the form of quantum-mechanical expectation values
(refer to Deﬁnition 4) as
Fρ(Ω, θ) := (πℏ)−1 Tr [ ρ D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω)].
We will refer to the above operator Πθ as a parity operator following the lead
of Grossmann and Royer [64,102] and given its resemblance and close analogy
to the reﬂection operator Π discussed in prior work [15,77,78,81,87,108,115].
Here, D(Ω) denotes the displacement operator and Ω describes suitable phase-
space coordinates (see Sect. 3.1). (Recall that ℏ= h/(2π) is deﬁned as the
Planck constant h divided by 2π.) The quantum-mechanical expectation val-
ues in the preceding equation give rise to a rich family of phase-space distri-
bution functions Fρ(Ω, θ) which represent arbitrary (mixed) quantum states
as given by their density operator ρ. In particular, this family of phase-space
representations contains all elements from the (above-mentioned) Cohen class
and naturally includes the pivotal Husimi Q and Born–Jordan distribution
functions.
We would like to emphasize that our approach to phase-space repre-
sentations averts the use of integral transformations, Fourier transforms, or
convolutions as these are subsumed in the parity operator Πθ which is inde-
pendent of the phase-space coordinate Ω. Although our deﬁnition also relies on
an integral transformation given by a Fourier transform, it is only applied once
and is completely absorbed into the deﬁnition of a parity operator, thereby
avoiding redundant applications of Fourier transforms. This leads to signiﬁcant
advantages as compared to earlier approaches:
• conceptual advantages (see also [76,81,98,108,115]):
– The phase-space distribution function is given as a quantum-mechanical
expectation value. This form nicely ﬁts with the experimental recon-
struction of quantum states [7,14,46,68,81,93,107].
– All the complexity from integral transformations (etc.) is condensed
into the parity operator Πθ.
– The dependence on the distribution θ and the particular phase space
is separated from the displacement D(Ω).
• computational advantages:
– The repeated and expensive computation of integral transformations
(etc.) in earlier approaches is avoided as Πθ has to be determined
only once. Also, the eﬀect of the displacement D(Ω) is relatively
easy to calculate.

In this regard, the current work can also be seen as a continuation of [81]
where the parity operator approach has been emphasized, but mostly for
ﬁnite-dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we connect results from quan-
tum optics [22,23,59,88], quantum harmonic analysis [30,37–40,43,44,74,118],
and group-theoretical approaches [21,54,90,100]. It is also our aim to narrow
the gap between diﬀerent communities where phase-space methods have been
successfully applied.
On the other hand, a major contribution of our work is the analysis of
existence properties of generalized phase-space distributions and their par-
ity operators. While the Wigner function has been known to exist for the
general class of tempered distributions (a class of generalized functions that
includes the pivotal L2 space), we further illuminate which classes of Cohen
kernels yield well-deﬁned generalized phase-space distribution functions. Such
existence questions are fully absorbed into the parity operators and precise
conditions are used to guarantee their mathematical existence.
Similar to the parity operator Π (which is the Weyl quantization of the
delta distribution), we show that its generalizations Πθ are Weyl quantizations
of the corresponding Cohen kernel θ (refer to Sect. 4.3 for the precise deﬁnition
of the Weyl quantization used in this work). We discuss how these general re-
sults reduce to well-known special cases, and discuss properties of phase-space
distributions in relation to their parity operators Πθ. In particular, we consider
the class of s-parametrized distribution functions [22,23,59,98], which include
the Wigner, Glauber P, and Husimi Q functions, as well as the τ-parametrized
family which has been proposed in the context of time–frequency analysis
and pseudo-diﬀerential operators [16–18,43]. We derive spectral decomposi-
tions of parity operators for all of these phase-space families, including the
Born–Jordan distribution. Relations of the form Πθ = Aθ ◦Π motivate the
name “parity operator” as they are in fact compositions of the usual parity
operator Π followed by some operator Aθ that usually corresponds to a geo-
metric or physical operation (which commutes with Π). In particular, Aθ is
a squeezing operator for the τ-parametrized family and corresponds to pho-
ton loss for the s-parametrized family (assuming s < 0). This structure of
the parity operators Πθ connects phase spaces to elementary geometric and
physical operations (such as reﬂection, squeezing operators, photon loss), and
these concepts are central to applications: The squeezing operator models a
nonlinear optical process which generates non-classical states of light in quan-
tum optics [60,88,94]. These squeezed states of light have been widely used
in precision interferometry [61,96,110,124] or for enhancing the performance
of imaging [92,116]; also, the gravitational-wave detector GEO600 has been
operating with squeezed light since 2010 [1,65].
The Born–Jordan distribution and its parity operator constitute a most
peculiar instance among the phase-space approaches. This distribution func-
tion has convenient properties, e.g., it satisﬁes the marginal conditions and

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
therefore allows for a probabilistic interpretation [43]. The Born–Jordan dis-
tribution is, however, diﬃcult to compute. But most importantly, the Born–
Jordan distribution and its corresponding quantization scheme have a fun-
damental importance in quantum mechanics. In particular, there have been
several attempts in the literature to ﬁnd the “right” quantization rule for ob-
servables using either algebraic or analytical techniques. In a recent paper [42],
one of us has analyzed the Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger pictures of quantum
mechanics, and it is shown that the equivalence of both theories requires that
one must use the Born–Jordan quantization rule (as proposed by Born and
Jordan [20])

for monomial observables. The Born–Jordan and Weyl rules yield the same
result only if m < 2 or ℓ< 2; for instance, in both cases the quantization of the
product xp is 1
2(ˆxˆp + ˆpˆx). It is, however, easy to ﬁnd physical examples which
give diﬀerent results. Consider, for instance, the square of the z component of
the angular momentum: It is given by

(Recall that the operators ˆxη and ˆpκ satisfy the canonical commutation re-
lations [ˆxη, ˆpκ] = iℏδηκ using the spatial coordinates η, κ ∈{x, y, z} and the
Kronecker delta δηκ.) One of us has shown in [45] that the use of (2) instead
of (1) solves the so-called angular momentum dilemma [34,35].
To a general observable a(x, p), the Weyl rule associates the operator
OpWeyl(a) = (2πℏ)−1

Fσa(x, p)D(x, p) dx dp
where Fσa is the symplectic Fourier transform of a and D(x, p) the displace-
ment operator (see Sect. 3.1); in the Born–Jordan case, this expression is re-
placed with
OpBJ(a) = (2πℏ)−1

Fσa(x, p)KBJ(x, p)D(x, p) dx dp

We obtain signiﬁcant, new results for the case of Born–Jordan distri-
butions and therefore substantially advance on previous characterizations. In
particular, we derive its parity operator ΠBJ in the form of a weighted average

where D(x, p) is the displacement operator and S(ξ) is the squeezing operator
(see Eq. (46)) with a real squeezing parameter ξ. We have used the sinus
cardinalis sinc(x) := sin(x)/x and the hyperbolic secant sech(x) := 1/cosh(x)
functions. The parity operator ΠBJ in Eq. (3) decomposes into a product
Πθ = Aθ◦Π containing the usual reﬂection operator Π. This is another example
of the above-discussed motivation for our terminology of parity operators. We
prove in Proposition 2 that ΠBJ is a bounded operator on the Hilbert space of
square-integrable functions and therefore gives rise to well-deﬁned phase-space
distribution functions of arbitrary quantum states. We derive a generalized
spectral decomposition of this parity operator based on a continuous family
of generalized eigenvectors that satisfy the following generalized eigenvalue
equation for every real E (see Theorem 5):
ΠBJ |ψE
±⟩= ±π/2 sech(πE) |ψE
±⟩.
Facilitating a more eﬃcient computation of the Born–Jordan distribution, we
ﬁnally derive explicit matrix representations in the so-called Fock or number-
state basis, which constitutes a natural representation for bosonic quantum
systems such as in quantum optics [60,88,94]. In this case, the parity opera-
tor ΠBJ of the Born–Jordan distribution is not diagonal in the Fock basis—as
compared to the diagonal parity operators of s-parametrized phase spaces
(cf. [81]) that enable the experimental reconstruction of distribution functions
from photon-count statistics [7,14,46,93] in quantum optics. We calculate the
matrix elements [ΠBJ]mn in the Fock or number-state basis and provide a
convenient formula for a direct recursion, for which we conjecture that the
matrix elements are completely determined by eight rational initial values.
This recursion scheme has signiﬁcant computational advantages for calculat-
ing Born–Jordan distribution functions as compared to previous approaches
and allows for an eﬃcient implementation. In particular, large matrix repre-
sentations of the parity operator ΠBJ can be well approximated using rank-9
matrices. We ﬁnally illustrate our results for simple quantum states by calculat-
ing their Born–Jordan distributions and comparing them to other phase-space
representations. Let us summarize the main results of the current work:
– quantum-mechanical expectation values of the parity operators Πθ from
Deﬁnition 3 deﬁne distribution functions (see Deﬁnition 4) and form the
Cohen class (Theorem 1);
– existence properties of parity operators and generalized phase-space func-
tions are clariﬁed in Sect. 4. We refer in particular to the crucial Lemma 2;
– the parity operators Πθ are Weyl quantizations of the corresponding Co-
hen convolution kernels θ (Sect. 4.3);

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
– parity operators for important distribution functions are summarized in
Sect. 4.4 along with their operator norms (Theorem 2) and generalized
spectral decompositions in Sect. 5.2;
– the Born–Jordan parity operator is a weighted average of displacements
(Theorem 3) or, equivalently, a weighted average of squeezing operators
(Theorem 4), and it is bounded (Proposition 2);
– the Born–Jordan parity operator admits a generalized spectral decompo-
sition (Theorem 5);
– its matrix representation is calculated in the number-state basis in Theo-
rem 6; and an eﬃcient, recursion-based computation scheme is proposed
in Conjecture 1.
Our work has signiﬁcant implications: General (inﬁnite-dimensional) phase-
space functions can now be conveniently and eﬀectively described as natural
expectation values. We provide a much more comprehensive understanding of
Born–Jordan phase spaces and means for eﬀectively computing the correspond-
ing phase-space functions. Working in a rigorous mathematical framework, we
also facilitate future discussions of phase spaces by connecting diﬀerent com-
munities in physics and mathematics.
We start by recalling precise deﬁnitions of distribution functions and
quantum states for inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3,
we discuss phase-space translations of quantum states using coherent states,
recall one known formulation of translated parity operators, and relate a gen-
eral class of phase spaces to Wigner distribution functions and their properties.
We note that an experienced reader can skip most of the introductory Sects. 2
and 3 and jump directly to our results. These preparations will, however, guide
our study of phase-space representations of quantum states as expectation val-
ues of displaced parity operators in Sect. 4. We present and discuss our results
for the case of the Born–Jordan distribution and its parity operator in Sect. 5.
Formulas for the matrix elements of the Born–Jordan parity operator are de-
rived in Sect. 6. Explicit examples for simple quantum systems are discussed
and visualized in Sect. 7, before we conclude. A larger part of the proofs are
relegated to “Appendices.”
2. Distributions and Quantum States
All of our discussion and results in this work will strongly rely on precise
notions of distributions and related descriptions of quantum states in inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert spaces. Although most (or all) of this material is quite
standard and well known [44,66,73,101], we ﬁnd it prudent to shortly sum-
marize this background material in order to ﬁx our notation and keep our
presentation self-contained. This will also help to clarify diﬀerences and con-
nections between divergent concepts and notations used in the literature. We
hope this will also contribute to narrowing the gap between diﬀerent physics
communities that are interested in this topic.

2.1. Schwartz Space and Fourier Transforms
We will now summarize function spaces that are central to this work, re-
fer also to [44, Ch. 1.1.3] and to [56,112]. The set of all smooth, complex-
valued functions on Rn that decrease faster (together with all of their par-
tial derivatives) than the reciprocal of any polynomial is called the Schwartz
space and is usually denoted by S(Rn), refer to [101, Ch. V.3] or [73, Ch. 6].
More precisely, a function ψ : Rn →C is called fast decreasing if the abso-
lute values |xβ∂α
x ψ(x)| are bounded for each multi-index of natural numbers
α := (α1, . . . , αn) and β := (β1, . . . , βn), where by deﬁnition xβ := xβ1
1 · · · xβn
n
and ∂α
x := ∂α1
x1 · · · ∂αn
xn , refer to [44, Ch. 1.1.3]. This gives rise to a family of
seminorms ∥ψ∥α,β := supx∈Rn |xβ∂α
x ψ(x)| which turn S(Rn) into a topological
space which is even a Fr´echet space [101, Thm. V.9].
The topological dual space S′(Rn) of S(Rn) is often referred to as the
space of tempered distributions, and we will denote the distributional pairing
for φ ∈S′(Rn) and ψ ∈S(Rn) as ⟨φ, ψ⟩:= φ(ψ) ∈C. In Sect. 2, we will
consistently use the symbol φ to denote distributions and ψ, ψ′ to denote
Schwartz or square-integrable functions. Also, note that S(Rn) is dense in
L2(Rn),1 and that tempered distributions naturally include the usual function
spaces S(Rn) ⊂L2(Rn) ⊂S′(Rn) via distributional pairings in the form of
an integral ⟨φ, ψ⟩=

Rn φ∗(x)ψ(x) dx, where φ∗(x) is the complex conjugate
of φ(x) ∈L2(Rn) or φ(x) ∈S(Rn). This inclusion is usually referred to as a
rigged Hilbert space [26,57] or the Gelfand triple.
Remarkably, every tempered distribution is the derivative of some poly-
nomially bounded continuous function, that is, given φ ∈S′(Rn) there exists
g : Rn →C continuous such that |g(x)| ≤C(1+x2)m for some C, m ≥0 and
all x ∈Rn, and a multi-index α such that ⟨φ, ψ⟩=(−1)|α| 
Rn g∗(x)(∂α
x ψ)(x) dx
for all ψ ∈S(Rn)—for short one can write φ = ∂α
x g [101, Thm. V.10].
In particular, one can construct tempered distributions by considering
smooth functions φ that (together with all of their partial derivatives) grow
slower than certain polynomials. More precisely, a smooth map φ : Rn →C
is said to be slowly increasing or of slow growth if for every α = (α1, . . . , αn)
there exist constants C, m, and A such that |∂α
x φ(x)| ≤C∥x∥m for all ∥x∥> A,
where ∥x∥is the Euclidean norm in Rn, refer to [73, Ch. 6.2]. A standard ex-
ample of such functions are polynomials. In particular, every slowly increasing
function φ(x) generates a tempered distribution ⟨φ, ψ⟩=

Rn φ∗(x)ψ(x) dx for
all ψ ∈S(Rn), and therefore, such functions are usually denoted as φ(x) ∈
S′(Rn) (refer to [73, Ch. 6.2]).
Example 1. This motivates the delta distribution ⟨δb, ψ⟩:= ψ(b) which is in
its integral representation commonly written as

Rn δ(x−b)ψ(x) dx = ψ(b). We
emphasize that the notation δ(x) is, however, only formal, cf. [101, Eq. (V.3)].
Moreover, this tempered distribution is generated by the second derivative of
1Recall that the Lebesgue spaces Lq(Rn) with 0 < q < ∞are subspaces of equivalence
classes of measurable functions f : Rn →C that diﬀer only on a set of measure zero such
that the qth power of their absolute value is Lebesgue integrable, i.e.,

Rn |f(x)|q dx < ∞
[101].

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
the polynomially bounded continuous function g(x) := x−b for x ≥b and
zero otherwise, i.e., ⟨δb, ψ⟩=

R g(x)ψ′′(x) dx for all ψ ∈S(R) [101, Ch. V,
Ex. 8]. This generating function is not unique as, for example, one also has
δb = (d2/dx2)|x−b|/2.
For the rest of our work, we will restrict the general space Rn to the case
of R which is most relevant for the applications we highlight. This simpliﬁes
our notation, even though many statements could be generalized.
Recall that for all a ∈S(R2) the symplectic Fourier transform [Fσa](x, p)
(see App. B in [44]) is related to the usual Fourier transform2
[Fa](x, p) := (2πℏ)−1

e−i
ℏ(x′x+p′p)a(x′, p′) dx′ dp′,
up to a coordinate transformation [Fσa](x, p) = [Fa](p, −x) where
[Fσa](x, p) := (2πℏ)−1

e−i
ℏ(x′p−xp′)a(x′, p′) dx′ dp′.
(4)
Note that the square [FσFσa](x, p) = a(x, p) is equal to the identity, and that
the Fourier transform of every function in S(Rn) is also in S(Rn), cf. [101,
Ch. IX.1]. The fact that Fσ is Hermitian, i.e., ⟨Fσφ, ψ⟩L2 = ⟨φ, Fσψ⟩L2 for
all φ, ψ ∈S(R2) (see Sect. 2.2) motivates us to deﬁne the symplectic Fourier
transform of tempered distributions via the distributional pairing ⟨Fσφ, ψ⟩:=
⟨φ, Fσψ⟩= φ(Fσψ) for φ ∈S′(R2) and ψ ∈S(R2). Thus, this is the extension
of Fσ with respect to the distributional pairing in our sense, cf. also “Appendix
A.” In particular, the symplectic Fourier transform generalizes to phase-space
distribution functions a(x, p) without further adjustment and all the properties
of Fσ on S(R2) transfer to S′(R2).
Let us come back to our previous example: the delta distribution can be
identiﬁed formally via the brackets ⟨δ0, Fσψ⟩= [Fσψ](0) = (2πℏ)−1⟨1, ψ⟩as
the Fourier transform δ(x) = (2πℏ)−1Fσ[1] of the constant function, refer to
[73, Ch. 6.4].
2.2. Quantum States and Expectation Values
Let us denote the abstract state vector of a quantum system by |ψ⟩which is an
element of an abstract, inﬁnite-dimensional, separable complex Hilbert space
(here and henceforth denoted by) H. The Hilbert space H is known as the
state space and it is equipped with a scalar product ⟨· | · ⟩[66]. Considering
projectors Pψ := |ψ⟩⟨ψ| deﬁned via the open scalar products Pψ = ⟨ψ| · ⟩|ψ⟩,
an orthonormal basis of H is given by {|φn⟩, n ∈N} if ⟨φn|φm⟩= δnm for all
m, n ∈N and 	∞
n=0 Pφn = 1 in the strong operator topology. For a broader
introduction to this topic we refer to [66].
Depending on the given quantum system, explicit representations of the
state space can be obtained by specifying its Hilbert space [58]. In the case
2A multitude of sign and normalization conventions are commonly used throughout various
ﬁelds as characterized by the two parameters q and r in the generic expression for the
one-dimensional Fourier transform F[a(·)](x) =

|r|(2π)q−1 
eirxx′a(x′) dx′. In this work,
q = 0 (because then F[F[a]](x) = a(−x) for all a ∈S(R)) and r = −ℏ−1.

of bosonic systems, the Fock (or number-state) representation is widely used.
There a quantum state |ψ⟩is an element of the Hilbert space ℓ2 of square-
summable sequences of complex numbers [66], and it is characterized by its
expansion |ψ⟩= 	∞
n=0 ψn|n⟩into the Fock basis {|n⟩, n = 0, 1, . . . } of number
states using the expansion coeﬃcients ψn = ⟨n|ψ⟩∈C, refer to, e.g., [23] and
[66, Ch. 11]. The scalar product ⟨ψ|ψ′⟩then corresponds to the usual scalar
product of vectors, i.e., to the absolutely convergent sum 	∞
n=0(ψn)∗ψ′
n =:
⟨ψ|ψ′⟩ℓ2. The corresponding norm of vectors is then given by ∥ψ∥ℓ2 = ∥(|ψ⟩)∥ℓ2
= [⟨ψ|ψ⟩ℓ2]1/2.
For a quantum state |ψ⟩, the coordinate representation ψ(x) ∈S(R)
and its Fourier transform (or momentum representation) ψ(p) ∈S(R) are
given by complex, square-integrable, and smooth functions that are also fast
decreasing. The quantum state |ψ⟩=

R ψ(x)|x⟩dx of ψ(x) = ⟨x|ψ⟩is then
deﬁned via coordinate eigenstates3 |x⟩. The coordinate representation of a
coordinate eigenstate is given by the distribution δ(x′−x) ∈S′(R), refer to
[58,66]. The scalar product ⟨ψ|ψ′⟩is then ﬁxed by the usual L2 scalar product,
i.e., by the convergent integral

R ψ∗(x)ψ′(x) dx =: ⟨ψ|ψ′⟩L2. This integral
induces the norm of square-integrable functions via ∥ψ(x)∥L2 = [⟨ψ|ψ⟩L2]1/2.
The two examples given above are particular representations of the state
space, which are convenient for speciﬁc physical systems; however, these rep-
resentations are well known to be equivalent via
H ≃ℓ2 ≃L2(R, dx) ≃L2(R, dp),
(5)
refer to Theorem 2 in [58]. In particular, any coordinate representation ψ(x) ∈
L2(R) of a quantum state |ψ⟩can be expanded in the number-state basis into

and it is independent of the chosen orthonormal basis as any two orthonor-

the
equivalence
L2(R, dx)
≃L2(R, dp).
Motivated by the invariance of the scalar product under the choice of
representation, in the following we will consistently use the notation ⟨· | · ⟩for
scalar products in Hilbert space, without specifying the type of representation.
However, in order to avoid confusion with diﬀerent types of operator or Eu-
clidean norms, we will use in the following the explicit norms ∥ψ(x)∥L2 and
∥|ψ⟩∥ℓ2, despite their equivalence.
3For the position operator ˆx : S(R) →S(R), ψ(x) →xψ(x), one can consider the dual
ˆx′ : S′(R) →S′(R), φ →φ ◦ˆx. This map satisﬁes the generalized eigenvalue equation
ˆx′|x0⟩= x0|x0⟩for all x0 ∈R where its generalized eigenvector |x0⟩∈S′(R) is the delta
distribution, which allows for the resolution of the position operator ˆx =

R x|x⟩⟨x| dx. For
more details, we refer to [57] or [58, p. 1906].

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
Finally, let us summarize some of the main concepts on operators on
inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, refer to [97, Ch. 15 & 16] for a compre-
hensive introduction. We start with the set of bounded linear operators B(H),
that is, the collection of all A : H →H linear for which the operator norm
∥A∥sup :=
sup
∥|ψ⟩∥H=1
∥A|ψ⟩∥H
(7)
is ﬁnite. As discussed previously—after translating A into an equivalent oper-
ator on L2 or ℓ2—this formalism encompasses ∥A∥sup = sup∥|ψ⟩∥ℓ2=1 ∥A|ψ⟩∥ℓ2
for the Hilbert space ℓ2 (number-state representation), as well as ∥A∥sup =
sup∥ψ(x)∥L2=1 ∥Aψ(x)∥L2 for square-integrable functions ψ(x) (coordinate rep-
resentation). Next one looks at the set of all compact operators4 K(H) ⊆B(H)
as every compact A can be written as 	
n∈N sn(A)|fn⟩⟨gn| where {|fn⟩}n∈N,
{|gn⟩}n∈N, N ⊆N are orthonormal systems and sn(A) > 0 are the unique
singular values of A [97, Prop. 16.3]. This lets one deﬁne the trace class
B1(H) := {A ∈K(H) : 	
n∈N sn(A) < ∞} and the Hilbert–Schmidt oper-
ators B2(H) := {A ∈K(H) : 	
n∈N sn(A)2 < ∞}.
For all A ∈B1(H), one then deﬁnes the trace via the absolutely con-
vergent sum Tr(A) := 	∞
n=1⟨ψn|Aψn⟩where the right-hand side is indepen-
dent of the chosen orthonormal basis {|ψn⟩, n ∈N} of H. The name “trace
class” is due to the fact that it is the largest subset of B(H) where the trace
can be reasonably deﬁned [97, Prop. 16.18]. Equipped with the trace norm
∥A∥1 := 	
n∈N sn(A), the trace class is a Banach space, and the Hilbert–
Schmidt operators even form a Hilbert space under the (well-deﬁned) in-
ner product ⟨A, B⟩HS := Tr(A†B); here, A† is the adjoint of A (which is
in ﬁnite dimensions given by the complex conjugated and transposed ma-
trix). Trace-class operators A ∈B1(H) have the important property that
their products with bounded operators B ∈B(H) are also in the trace class,
i.e., AB, BA ∈B1(H). With this, one ﬁnds that the trace is linear and con-
tinuous with respect to the trace norm, and one has the following important
trace inequality: |Tr(AB)| ≤∥A∥1∥B∥sup for all A ∈B1(H), B ∈B(H) [97,
Lemma 16.23].
Thus, one deﬁnes a density operator or state ρ ∈B1(H) to be positive
semi-deﬁnite5 with Tr(ρ) = 1. It therefore admits a spectral decomposition
[97, Prop. 16.2], i.e., there exists an orthonormal system {|ψn⟩, n ∈N} in H
such that
ρ =
∞

n=1
pn|ψn⟩⟨ψn|.
(8)
The probabilities {pn, n ∈N} satisfy p1 ≥p2 ≥. . . ≥0 and 	∞
n=1 pn = 1. As
expectation values of observables are computed via the trace ⟨O⟩ρ = Tr(ρ O) =
	∞
n=1 pn⟨ψn|Oψn⟩where O ∈B(H) is self-adjoint, as a simple consequence of
the trace inequality stated earlier one ﬁnds:
4A linear map A between normed spaces is called compact if the closure of the image of the
closed unit ball under A is compact.
5An operator A ∈B(H) is said to be positive semi-deﬁnite if A is self-adjoint and ⟨x|Ax⟩≥0
for all x ∈H.

is upper bounded by the operator norm |Tr(ρ O)| ≤∥O∥sup for arbitrary density
operators ρ.
3. Coherent States, Phase Spaces, and Parity Operators
We continue to ﬁx our notation by discussing an abstract deﬁnition of phase
spaces that relies on displaced parity operators. This usually appears con-
cretely in terms of coherent states [21,54,90,100], for which we consider two
equivalent but equally important parametrizations of the phase space using
the coordinates α or (x, p) (see below). This deﬁnition of phase spaces can
be also related to convolutions of Wigner functions which is usually known
as the Cohen class [28,29,44]. We also recall important postulates for Wigner
functions as given by Stratonovich [21,113], and these will be considered later
in the context of general phase spaces.
3.1. Phase-Space Translations of Quantum States
We will now recall a deﬁnition of the phase space for quantum-mechanical sys-
tems via coherent states, refer to [21,50,54,72,90,100]. We consider a quantum
system which has a speciﬁc dynamical symmetry group given by a Lie group G.
The Lie group G acts on the Hilbert space H using an irreducible unitary rep-
resentation D of G. By choosing a ﬁxed reference state as an element |0⟩∈H
of the Hilbert space, one can deﬁne a set of coherent states as |g⟩:= D(g)|0⟩
where g ∈G. Considering the subgroup H ⊆G of elements h ∈H that act on
the reference state only by multiplication D(h)|0⟩:= eiφ|0⟩with a phase factor
eiφ, any element g ∈G can be decomposed into g = Ωh with Ω ∈G/H. The
phase space is then identiﬁed with the set of coherent states |Ω⟩:= D(Ω)|0⟩.
In the following, we will consider the Heisenberg–Weyl group6 H3, for which
the phase space Ω ∈H3/R is a plane.
Next, we introduce the corresponding displacement operators that gen-
erate translations of the plane. These operators are also known as Heisenberg–
Weyl operators [44] or, in the physics literature, simply as Weyl operators
[6,41,70]. In particular, for harmonic oscillator systems, the phase space Ω ≡
α ∈C is usually parametrized by the complex eigenvalues α of the annihilation
operator ˆa and Glauber coherent states can be represented explicitly [23] in
the so-called Fock (or number-state) basis as
|α⟩= e−|α|2/2

n!|n⟩= eαˆa†−α∗ˆa|0⟩=: D(α)|0⟩.
(9)
Here, the second equality speciﬁes the displacement operator D(α) as a power
series of the usual bosonic annihilation ˆa and creation ˆa† operators, which

including but certainly not limited to harmonic analysis (e.g., relation to the displacement
operator)—we refer to [71].

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
satisfy the commutation relation [ˆa, ˆa†] = 1, refer to Eq. (2.11) in [23]. In
particular, the number-state representation of displacements is given by [23]
[D(α)]mn := ⟨m|D(α)|n⟩= ( n!

(x) are generalized Laguerre polynomials. This is
the usual formulation for bosonic systems (e.g., in quantum optics) [88], where
the optical phase space is the complex plane and the phase-space integration
measure is given by dΩ = 2ℏd2α = 2ℏdℜ(α) dℑ(α) (where one often sets
h = 2πℏ= 1, cf., [21–23]). The real and imaginary parts of α are denoted
by ℜ(α) and ℑ(α), respectively. The annihilation operator admits a simple
decomposition
ˆa = 2ℏ

α |α⟩⟨α| dℜ(α) dℑ(α)
with respect to its eigenvectors, see, e.g., [23, Eqs. (2.21)–(2.27)].
Let us now consider the coordinate representation ψ(x) ∈S(R) of a
quantum state. The phase space is parametrized by Ω ≡(x, p) ≡z ∈R2 and
the integration measure is dΩ = dz = dx dp. The displacement operator acts
via (see also [119–121])
D(x0, p0)ψ(x) := e
i
ℏ(p0x−1
2 p0x0)ψ(x−x0) = e−i
ℏ(x0 ˆp−p0ˆx)ψ(x),
(11)
where x, x0, p0 ∈R. The right-hand side of Eq. (11) speciﬁes the displacement
operator as a power series of the usual operators ˆx and ˆp, which satisfy the
commutation relation [ˆx, ˆp] = iℏ, refer to [44, Sec. 1.2.2., Def. 2].
The most common representations of these two unbounded operators are
ˆxψ(x) = xψ(x) and ˆpψ(x) = −iℏ∂ψ(x)/∂x. Displacements of tempered distri-
butions φ(x) ∈S′(R) are understood via the distribution pairings (D(Ω)φ)(ψ) :=
φ(D(−Ω)ψ) where −Ω = (−x0, −p0). This deﬁnition guarantees that8
D(Ω)[⟨φ, · ⟩](ψ) = ⟨D(Ω)φ, ψ⟩
as integrals from Sect. 2.1 (cf. Example 3(2), “Appendix A”) for all φ : R →C
such that ⟨φ, · ⟩∈S′(R), and all ψ ∈S(R), Ω ∈R2. In particular it does
not matter whether D(Ω) acts on a function φ : R →C or on the induced
functional ψ →⟨φ, ψ⟩.
The two (above mentioned) physically motivated examples are partic-
ular representations of the displacement operator for the Heisenberg–Weyl
group in diﬀerent Hilbert spaces that rely on diﬀerent parametrizations of
the phase space. Let us now highlight the equivalence of these two represen-
tations. In particular, we obtain the formulas ˆaλ = (λˆx + iλ−1ˆp)/
√
2ℏand
ˆa†
λ = (λˆx −iλ−1ˆp)/
√
2ℏfor any nonzero real conversion factor λ with phys-
ical dimension

ℏ/[x] (where [x] denotes the physical dimension of x), refer

8This diﬀers from other approaches where one considers the embedding ι : S(R) →S′(R),

and ˆp are the so-called optical quadratures [88]. The operators ˆaλ and ˆa†
λ
are now deﬁned on the Hilbert space L2(R), whereas ˆa and ˆa† act on ele-
ments of the Hilbert space ℓ2. For any λ ̸= 0, they reproduce the commutator
[ˆaλ, ˆa†
λ] = idL2, i.e., [ˆaλ, ˆa†
λ] ψ(x) = ψ(x) for all ψ(x) ∈L2(R), and they corre-
spond to raising and lowering operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator9

and ˆp = −i

yields

λ(x0λ + iλ−1p0)/
√
2ℏ−ˆaλ(x0λ −iλ−1p0)/

This then conﬁrms the equivalence
D(x0, p0)ψ(x) = e−i
ℏ(x0 ˆp−p0ˆx)ψ(x) = eˆa†
λα−ˆaλα∗ψ(x) = D(α)ψ(x),
(12)
where the phase-space coordinate α is deﬁned by α := (x0λ + iλ−1p0)/
√
2ℏ.
Note that the corresponding phase-space element is then dΩ = 2ℏdℜ(α) dℑ(α)
= dx dp which is independent of the choice of λ. Let us also recall two prop-
erties of the displacement operator [119–121] (see, e.g., [44, p. 7]):
D(x0, p0)D(x1, p1) = e
i
ℏ(p0x1−p1x0)D(x1, p1)D(x0, p0)
(13)
D(x0+x1, p0+p1) = e−i
2ℏ(p0x1−p1x0)D(x0, p0)D(x1, p1).
(14)
In the following, we will use both phase-space coordinates α and (x, p)
interchangeably. The displacement operator is obtained in both parametriza-
tions, and they are equivalent via (12). Motivated by the group deﬁnition, we
will also use the parametrization Ω for the phase space via D(Ω), where Ω
corresponds to any representation of the group, including the ones given by
the coordinates α and (x, p).
3.2. Phase-Space Reﬂections and the Grossmann–Royer Operator
Recall that the parity operator Π reﬂects wave functions via Πψ(x) := ψ(−x)
and Πψ(p) := ψ(−p) for coordinate-momentum representations [15,44,64,91,
102], and Π|Ω⟩:= |−Ω⟩for phase-space coordinates of coherent states [15,22,
91,102]. This parity operator is obtained as a phase-space average

or Π = 1
2{[FσD](Ω′)}|Ω′=0 for short. Thus, the parity operator equals eval-
uating the symplectic Fourier transform of the displacement operator at the
phase-space point Ω′ = 0. This is related to the Grossmann–Royer operator

2[FσD](−Ω) = D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω),
(16)
which is the parity operator transformed by the displacement operator [15,44,
64,91,102]. Here, we use in both (15) and (16) an abbreviated notation for
formal integral transformations of the displacement operator.
Remark 1. This abbreviation in Eq. (16) is justiﬁed as the existence of the cor-
responding integral (Πφ)(ψ) = (4πℏ)−1 
φ(D†(Ω)ψ) dΩ = (4πℏ)−1 
φ(D(Ω)
ψ) dΩ is guaranteed by, e.g., [44, Sec. 1.3., Prop. 8] for all φ ∈S′(R). In the
following, we will use this abbreviated notation for formal integral transfor-
mations of the displacement operator, i.e., by dropping φ. However, we might
need to restrict the domain of more general parity operators to ensure the
existence of the respective integrals.
3.3. Wigner Function and the Cohen Class
The Wigner function Wψ(x, p) of a pure quantum state |ψ⟩was originally
deﬁned by Wigner in 1932 [123], and it is (in modern terms) the integral
transformation of a pure state ψ ∈L2(R), i.e.,
Wψ(x, p) = (2πℏ)−1


2y) dy
= (πℏ)−1⟨ψ, D(x, p)ΠD†(x, p)ψ⟩= (πℏ)−1 Tr [ (|ψ⟩⟨ψ|) D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω)].
The second and third equalities specify the Wigner function using the
Grossmann–Royer operator [44,64] from (16), refer to [44, Sec. 2.1.1., Def. 12].
We use this latter form to extend the deﬁnition of the Wigner function to
mixed quantum states as in [4,15,22,102].
Deﬁnition 1. The Wigner function Wρ(Ω) ∈L2(R2) of an inﬁnite-dimensional
density operator (or quantum state) ρ = 	
n pn|ψn⟩⟨ψn| ∈B1(L2(R)) is pro-
portional to the quantum-mechanical expectation value
Wρ(Ω) := (πℏ)−1 Tr [ ρ D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω)] =

n
pnWψn(Ω)
(17)
of the Grossmann–Royer operator from (16), which is the parity operator Π
transformed by the displacement operator D(Ω), refer also to [4,15,22,44,91,
102].
The square-integrable cross-Wigner transform Wψ,ψ′(Ω) ∈L2(R2) of two
functions ψ, ψ′ ∈L2(R) used in time–frequency analysis [43,44] is obtained
via the ﬁnite-rank operator A = |ψ⟩⟨ψ′| in the form Wψ,ψ′(Ω) := WA(Ω).
Furthermore, as {D(Ω) : Ω ∈C} forms a subgroup of the unitary group, the
range of Wρ is a subset of the ρ-numerical range of (πℏ)−1Π [47].
The Wigner representation is in general a bijective, linear mapping be-
tween the set of density operators (or, more generally, the trace-class opera-
tors) and the phase-space distribution functions Wρ that satisfy the so-called

B. Koczor et al.
Ann. Henri Poincar´e
Stratonovich postulates [21,113]:
Postulate (i): ρ →Wρ is linear and injective,
Postulate (ii): Wρ† = W ∗
ρ (reality),
Postulate (iiia): Tr(ρ) =

Wρ dΩ (normalization),
Postulate (iiib): Tr(A†ρ) =

a∗Wρ dΩ (traciality),
Postulate (iv): WD(Ω′)ρ(Ω) = Wρ(Ω−Ω′) (covariance).
The not necessarily bounded10 operator A is the Weyl quantization of the
phase-space function (or distribution) a(Ω) ∈S′(R2), refer to Sect. 4.3. Based
on these postulates, the Wigner function was deﬁned for phase-spaces of quan-
tum systems with diﬀerent dynamical symmetry groups via coherent states
[21,54,79,81,100,115].
Before ﬁnally presenting the deﬁnition of the Cohen class for density
operators following [44, Sec. 8.1., Def. 93] or [29], let us ﬁrst recall the con-
cept of convolutions. Given Schwartz functions a, φ ∈S(R2), one deﬁnes their
convolution via
φ ∗a := 2πℏFσ[(Fσφ) (Fσa)]
(18)
which is again in S(R2). In principle, this formula extends to general func-
tions, although convergence may become an issue. These extensions are used
in Theorem 1 as well as Sect. 4.3. Now, Eq. (18) as well as the fact that
(φ ∗a)(Ω) =

φ(Ω′)a(Ω−Ω′) dΩ′ = ⟨φ∗, [T (Ω)a]∨⟩
are, for example, shown in [101, Thm. IX.3], where a∨(Ω) := a(−Ω) and T (Ω)
is the operator which translates a function by Ω [i.e., T (Ω)a(Ω′) := a(Ω′−Ω)].
With this in mind, one arrives at an extension of the convolution to tempered
distributions [62, Eq. (4.37) ﬀ.]: Given θ ∈S′(R2), a ∈S(R2) set
(θ ∗a)(Ω) := θ

[T (Ω)a]∨
(19)
for all Ω ∈R2. This deﬁnition extends in a natural way to general linear
functionals θ : Dθ →C on some subspace Dθ ⊆(R2 →C), and general
functions a : R2 →C as long as [T (Ω)a]∨∈Dθ for all Ω ∈R2.
Deﬁning the convolution via Eq. (19) is consistent with the distributional
pairing in the sense that ⟨φ∗| ∗a ≡φ ∗a, if ⟨φ∗|(ψ) := ⟨φ∗, ψ⟩on S(R2).
Moreover, one readily veriﬁes the identity ⟨(θ ∗a)∗, ψ⟩= θ(a∨∗ψ) for all θ ∈
S′(R2), a, ψ ∈S(R2). This shows that Eq. (19) is equivalent to other extensions
of convolutions commonly found in the literature, e.g., [101, p. 324]. Be aware
that θ ∗a is always a function of slow growth, that is, ⟨(θ ∗a)∗, ·⟩∈S′(R2) for
all θ ∈S′(R2), a ∈S(R2) [101, Thm. IX.4].
10For unbounded operators A, Postulate (iiib) still makes sense if ρ is has a ﬁnite repre-
sentation in the number-state basis, that is, ρ = 	N
m,n=1⟨m|ρn⟩|m⟩⟨n| for some N ∈N0.
Then, this postulate gets replaced by the well-deﬁned expression 	N
m,n=0⟨mρ|n⟩⟨m|An⟩∗=

a∗Wρ dΩ, see also “Appendix C.”

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
Deﬁnition 2. The Cohen class is the set of all linear mappings from density
operators to phase-space distributions that are related to the Wigner function
via a convolution. More precisely, a linear map F : B1(L2(R)) →(R2 →C),
ρ →Fρ maps to the phase-space distributions if ⟨Fρ, · ⟩∈S′(R2) for all ρ ∈
B1(L2(R)). Then, F belongs to the Cohen class if there exists11 θ ∈S′(R2)
(called “Cohen kernel”) such that
Fρ(Ω) = [θ ∗Wρ](Ω).
This is a generalization of the deﬁnition commonly found in the literature
[44, Def. 93]: There one restricts the domain of F from the full trace class to
only rank-one operators ρ = |φ⟩⟨ψ| for some φ, ψ ∈L2(R) or even ∈S(R). As
a simple example [44, p. 90], the Wigner function is in the Cohen class: To
see this, choose θ = δ in the above deﬁnition: [δ ∗Wρ](Ω) = δ([T (Ω)Wρ]∨) =
Wρ(Ω).
Remark 2. Given some θ ∈S′(R2) associated with an element F of the Cohen
class, one formally obtains Fσ[Fρ] = Fσ[θ ∗Wρ] = KθFσ[Wρ] if the symplec-
tic Fourier transform of θ is generated by a function Kθ : R2 →C via the
usual distributional pairing (we will call this “admissible” later, cf. Sect. 4.1).
The reason we make this observation is that this object always exists: It is
a product of two classical functions where Fσ[Wρ] is a bounded and square-
integrable function, i.e., |Fσ[Wρ](Ω)| = |Tr[D(Ω)ρ]| ≤∥D(Ω)∥sup∥ρ∥1 = 1 due
to unitarity of D(Ω), and Wρ ∈L2(R2) [44, Proposition 68] so the same holds
true for its Fourier transform. Thus—while the expression θ ∗Wρ may be ill
deﬁned for certain θ ∈S′(R2), ρ ∈B1(L2(R))—going to the Fourier domain
yields a well-deﬁned object which can be studied rather easily.
4. Theory of Parity Operators and Their Relation to
Quantization
4.1. Phase-Space Distribution Functions via Parity Operators
We propose a deﬁnition for phase-space distributions and the Cohen class
based on parity operators, the explicit form of which will be calculated in
Sect. 4.4. A similar form has already appeared in quantum optics for the so-
called s-parametrized distribution functions, see, e.g., [22,98]. In particular,
an explicit form of a parity operator that requires no integral transformation
appeared in (6.22) of [23], including its eigenvalue decomposition which was
later re-derived in the context of measurement probabilities in [98], refer also
to [91,102]. Apart from those results, mappings between density operators and
their phase-space distribution functions have been established only in terms
of integral transformations of expectation values, as in [3,4,22].
11More precisely, θ has to be a linear functional on a subspace Dθ of R2 →C such that
[T (Ω)Wρ]∨∈Dθ for all ρ ∈B1(L2(R)), Ω ∈R2. However, we will keep things informal
by assuming henceforth that all convolutions we encounter are well deﬁned in the sense of
Eq. (19).

For a convolution kernel θ ∈S′(R2), we introduce the corresponding ﬁlter
kernel
Kθ := 2πℏFσ(θ)
(20)
where Fσ denotes the symplectic Fourier transform (see Sect. 2.1). Henceforth,
we say θ ∈S′(R2) is admissible if its ﬁlter kernel is generated by a function
via the usual integral form of the distributional pairing ⟨φ, ψ⟩= φ(ψ) ∈C for
φ ∈S′(R) and ψ ∈S(R) (see Sect. 2.1): More precisely, θ is admissible if there
exists a function Kθ from R2 to C such that 2πℏFσ(θ)(ψ) = ⟨K∗
θ , ψ⟩for all
ψ ∈S(R). In this case, we call Kθ the ﬁlter function associated with θ.
Most importantly, if the convolution kernel is admissible and itself is
generated by a function, i.e., if we consider ⟨θ∗, · ⟩∈S′(R2) admissible, then
Eq. (20) simpliﬁes to
Kθ(Ω) = 2πℏ[Fσθ∨](Ω) = 2πℏ[Fσθ](−Ω)
(21)
for all Ω ∈R2. As before θ∨(Ω) = θ(−Ω). The technical condition of θ being
admissible is always satisﬁed in practice (cf. Tables 2 and 3). The advantage of
only considering admissible kernels is that the deﬁnition of the (generalized)
parity operator makes for an obvious generalization of the parity operator
from Sect. 3.2. For an even more general deﬁnition, we refer to Remark 12 in
“Appendix A.”
Deﬁnition 3. Given any admissible convolution kernel θ ∈S′(R2) with associ-
ated ﬁlter function Kθ, we deﬁne a parity operator Πθ on S(R) via
Πθ := (4πℏ)−1

Kθ(Ω)D(Ω) dΩ,
(22)
that is, [Πθψ](x) := (4πℏ)−1 
Kθ(Ω)[D(Ω)ψ](x) dΩ for all ψ ∈S(R), x ∈R.
This extends to a parity operator on the tempered distributions ⟨Πθ| : Dθ →
S′(R) via
⟨Πθ| := (4πℏ)−1

K∗
θ (Ω)D†(Ω) dΩ
(23)
(where the notation ⟨Πθ| is replaced below with Πθ) with domain
Dθ := {φ ∈S′(R) s.t.

K∗
θ (Ω)φ[D(−Ω)(·)] dΩ ∈S′(R)}.
(24)
We remark that the operator (22) has already appeared in Eq. (33) of [12]
for the special case Kθ(0) = 1. The latter, however, does not avoid potential
domain problems, cf. Example 2.
The derivation of the extension (23) of Πθ to tempered distributions is
detailed in “Appendix A.” Displacements of tempered distributions φ ∈S′(R)
are understood via the distributional pairing ⟨D(Ω)φ, ψ⟩= ⟨φ, D†(Ω)ψ⟩and
(23) gives rise to a well-deﬁned linear operator ⟨Πθ| from Dθ to S′(R) acting
on ψ ∈S(R) via
(⟨Πθ|φ)(ψ) = (4πℏ)−1

K∗
θ (Ω)⟨φ, e−i
ℏ(p0x+ 1
2 p0x0)ψ(x+x0)⟩dΩ.
(25)
The deﬁnition of Πθ is independent of the object it acts on (see “Ap-
pendix A”): ⟨Πθ|⟨φ, · ⟩= ⟨Πθφ, · ⟩for all φ ∈S(R) where ⟨φ, · ⟩denotes the

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
functional ψ →⟨φ, ψ⟩∈S′(R). All ﬁlter functions used in practice (refer to
Tables 2 and 3) obey K∗
θ (x0, p0) = Kθ(x0, −p0) for all x0, p0 ∈R. In this case,
⟨Πθ| is not only compatible with the inner product on L2(R), but also with
the embedding S(R) →S′(R) usually employed in mathematical physics (see
Lemma 3 in “Appendix A”). This motivates us to henceforth write Πθ in the
case of both (22) and (23) (instead of ⟨Πθ|).
While our deﬁnition above is pleasantly intuitive, we have to explicitly
consider the domain of the parity operator. For a general (admissible) kernel θ,
one needs to restrict the domain Dθ ⊆S′(R) of Πθ to tempered distributions
for which the integral in Eq. (22) exists, as done in Eq. (24) and already hinted
at in Remark 1.
Example 2. Domain considerations are illustrated using the standard ordering
with Kθ(Ω0) = exp[ip0x0/(2ℏ)] (see Table 2). Given any φ, ψ ∈S(R), we have
⟨φ, Πθψ⟩= (Πθ⟨ψ, ·⟩)(φ)∗= (4πℏ)−1

(26)
This reproduces known properties as in Eq. (5.39) of [30] (cf. Remark 3);
however, we emphasize that, although Eq. (26) exists for all functions φ, ψ as
long as [Fψ](0) exists, this expression is only equal to ⟨φ, Πθψ⟩if in addition
φ and Fφ are both in L1 (else the Fourier inversion formula used in the last
step cannot be applied). In other words, a function φ : R →R is in the domain
Dθ of Πθ if and only if its Fourier transform exists and is in L1(R) if and
only if (26) (resp. Eq. (5.39) of [30]) equals ⟨φ, Πθψ⟩for all suitable ψ. In
particular, Dθ contains all Schwartz functions conﬁrming that Πθ is densely
deﬁned. However, the functional ⟨φ, · ⟩∈S′(R) fails to be in Dθ for most
functions φ : R →C of slow growth including nonzero constant ones such as
φ := 1 ∈S′(R). In particular, Πθ does not extend to a well-deﬁned operator
on L2(R) as not all square-integrable functions will be contained in Dθ.
Following this line of thought, we investigate the well-deﬁnedness and
boundedness of Πθ on the Hilbert space L2(R). As in Example 2, we observe
that S(R) ⊆Dθ for all ﬁlter functions Kθ which is particularly relevant for ap-
plications. This follows by interpreting Πθ as a Weyl quantization (cf. Sect. 4.3)
whereby θ →Πθ is speciﬁed as a map from S′(R2) to the linear maps between
S(R) and S′(R) (cf. Chapter 6.3 in [43] or Lemma 14.3.1 in [62]). Consequently,
every parity operator has a well-deﬁned matrix representation in the number-
state basis (which is a subset of S(R), cf. Sect. 2.2). The following stronger
statement is shown in “Appendix B.1”:
Lemma 2. Given any convolution kernel θ ∈S′(R2), the following are equiva-
lent:

B. Koczor et al.
Ann. Henri Poincar´e
(i,a) Πθ : L2(R) →L2(R) is a well-deﬁned linear operator, that is, the mapping
x →1
2θ(Fσ[Dψ(x)]) (cf. Remark 12, “Appendix A”) is in L2(R) for all ψ ∈
L2(R).
(i,b) [θ ∗Wψ](0, 0) exists for all ψ ∈L2(R), i.e., [θ ∗Wψ](0, 0) < ∞.
Also, the following statements are equivalent:
(ii,a) supψ,φ∈L2(R),∥ψ∥=∥φ∥=1 |[θ ∗Wφ,ψ](0, 0)| < ∞.
(ii,b) (φ, ψ) →θ ∗Wφ,ψ is weakly continuous on L2(R) in the sense that there
exists C > 0 such that |[θ ∗Wφ,ψ](0, 0)| ≤C∥φ∥∥ψ∥for all φ, ψ ∈L2(R).
(ii,c) Πθ ∈B(L2(R)).
Moreover, if θ is admissible, then (i,a), (i,b) and (ii,a), (ii,b), (ii,c) are all
equivalent.
Recall from Sect. 3.3, Wφ,ψ is the usual cross-Wigner transform given by
Wφ,ψ(x, p) = (πℏ)−1⟨ψ, D(x, p)ΠD†(x, p)φ⟩
= (2πℏ)−1

2) dy.
Let us highlight that condition (ii,b) in Lemma 2 is a known suﬃcient condition
from time–frequency analysis to ensure that a tempered distribution θ is an
element of the Cohen class, cf. Theorem 4.5.1 in [62]. Now, the almost magical
result of Lemma 2 is that Πθ being well deﬁned on L2(R) automatically implies
boundedness as long as θ is admissible. This can also be attributed to the
folklore that unbounded operators “cannot be written down explicitly”: As
the operator Πθ for admissible kernels is deﬁned via an explicit integral, one
gets the boundedness of Πθ “for free.” Indeed, the proof that all ﬁve statements
from the above lemma are equivalent breaks down if one considers not only
admissible but arbitrary kernels.
We deﬁne a general class of phase-space distribution functions Fρ(Ω, θ)
via the (formal) expression (πℏ)−1 Tr [ ρ D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω)]. For general θ, how-
ever, this only makes sense if all displaced quantum states D†(Ω)ρD(Ω) are
supported on Dθ. We avoid these technicalities by restricting the deﬁnition
to those ﬁlter functions which give rise to operators Πθ that are bounded on
L2(R) and thereby allow for general ρ.
Deﬁnition 4. Given any θ ∈S′(R2) such that Πθ ∈B(L2(R)), we deﬁne a
linear mapping Fρ(·, θ) on the density operators ρ ∈B1(L2(R)) in the form of
the quantum-mechanical expectation value
Fρ(Ω, θ) := (πℏ)−1 Tr [ ρ D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω)].
(27)
While our deﬁnition considers the practically most important case of
bounded parity operators, in “Appendix C,” we give a detailed account of the
extension of Fρ(Ω, θ) to arbitrary θ ∈S′(R2) whereby the associated parity
operators may be unbounded. This is of importance for, e.g., the standard and
antistandard orderings as shown in Example 2. The prototypical case where
these extensions may not apply due to θ /∈S′(R2) is the case of the Glauber P
function which is well known to be singular except for classical thermal states.
However, most other convolution kernels appearing in practice are induced by

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
a tempered distribution and thus ﬁt into the framework of either Deﬁnition 4
or its extension in “Appendix C.”
Either way Deﬁnition 4 has many conceptual and computational advan-
tages as we have detailed in the introduction. To further clarify the scope of
said deﬁnition we now—similar to the proof of Lemma 2—relate the distribu-
tion functions Fρ(Ω, θ) from Eq. (27) to the Cohen class (see Deﬁnition 2 and
[44, Ch. 8]) by considering the ﬁlter function associated with any admissible
kernel.
Theorem 1. Given any θ ∈S′(R2) such that Πθ ∈B(L2(R)), the corresponding
phase-space distribution function Fρ(Ω, θ) ∈S′(R2) as deﬁned in Eq. (27) is
an element of the Cohen class. In particular, Fρ(Ω, θ) is related to the Wigner
function Wρ(Ω) via the convolution
Fρ(Ω, θ) = [θ ∗Wρ](Ω).
(28)
If the convolution kernel θ ∈S′(R2) is additionally admissible—meaning it
is the reﬂected symplectic Fourier transform θ = (2πℏ)−1⟨FσK∗
θ | of its ﬁlter
function Kθ—then in analogy to (16) one ﬁnds
D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω) = 1
2Fσ[Kθ(·)D(·)](−Ω).
(29)
The proof of Theorem 1 is given in “Appendix B.2.” The construction of a
particular class of phase-space distribution functions was detailed in [4], where
the term “ﬁlter function” also appeared in the context of mapping operators.
However, these ﬁlter functions were restricted to nonzero, analytic functions.
Deﬁnition 4 extends these cases to the Cohen class via Theorem 1 which allows
for more general phase spaces. For example, the ﬁlter function of the Born–
Jordan distribution has zeros (see Theorem 3), and is therefore not covered by
[4]. Most of the well-known distribution functions are elements of the Cohen
class. We calculate important special cases in Sect. 4.4. The Born–Jordan
distribution and its parity operator are detailed in Sect. 5.
Our approach to deﬁne phase-space distribution functions using displaced
parity operators also nicely ﬁts with the characteristic [22,29,88] or ambiguity
[44, Sec. 7.1.2, Prop. 5] function χ(Ω) ∈L2(R2) of a quantum state that is
deﬁned as the expectation value χ(Ω) := Tr[ρD(Ω)] = [FσWρ](Ω) or, equiv-
alently, as the symplectic Fourier transform of the Wigner function Wρ(Ω).
By multiplying the characteristic function χ(Ω) with a suitable ﬁlter function
Kθ(Ω) and applying the symplectic Fourier transform, one obtains the Cohen
class of phase-space distribution functions.
Remark 3. Deﬁnitions 3 and 4 for the parity operator and the phase-space
function can be compared to prior work where special cases or similar parity
operators have implicitly appeared and where similar restrictions on their exis-
tence must be observed. For example, the integral deﬁnition [28] of phase-space

(31)
as given12 in Eq. (5.2) of [30] translates into the deﬁnition (31) with the par-
ity operator. Both Eqs. (30) and (31) need to respect domain restrictions as
discussed in Example 2 and neither equation is well deﬁned for tempered distri-
butions in S′(R) or square-integrable functions in L2(R) that are not contained
in the domain Dθ.
4.2. Common Properties of Phase-Space Distribution Functions
We now detail important properties of Fρ(Ω, θ) and their relation to prop-
erties of Kθ(Ω) and Πθ. These properties will guide our discussion of parity
operators and this allows us to compare the Born–Jordan distribution to other
phase spaces. Table 1 provides a summary of these properties, and the proofs
are deferred to “Appendix D.” Recall that we are dealing exclusively with
convolution kernels θ ∈S′(R2) which give rise to bounded operators Πθ so the
induced phase-space distribution Fρ(Ω, θ) is well deﬁned everywhere.
Property 1. Boundedness of phase-space functions Fρ(Ω, θ): The phase-space
distribution
function
Fρ(Ω, θ)
is
bounded
in
its
absolute
value,
i.e., πℏ|Fρ(Ω, θ)| ≤∥Πθ∥sup for all quantum states ρ, refer to Lemma 1. In par-
ticular, then Fρ(Ω, θ) ∈S′(R2). Moreover, one ﬁnds that square-integrable ﬁl-
ter
functions
give
rise
to
bounded
parity
operators
due
to
∥Πθ∥sup
≤∥Kθ∥L2/
√
8πℏ. The proof of Property 1 in “Appendix D” implies the even
stronger statement that Πθ is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator if and only if Kθ is
square integrable.
Property 2. Square
integrability:
The
phase-space
distribution
function
Fρ(Ω, θ) is square integrable [i.e., Fρ(Ω, θ) ∈L2(R2)] for all ρ ∈B1(L2(R))
if the absolute value of the ﬁlter function is bounded [i.e., Kθ(Ω) ∈L∞(R2)].
In particular, this implies Fρ(Ω, θ) ∈S′(R2).
Property 3. Postulate (iv): The phase-space distribution function Fρ(Ω, θ) sat-
isﬁes, by deﬁnition, the covariance property. In particular, a displaced density
operator ρ′ := D(Ω′)ρD†(Ω′) is mapped to the inversely displaced distribution
function Fρ′(Ω, θ) = Fρ(Ω−Ω′, θ).
Property 4. Rotational covariance: Let us denote a rotated density operator
ρφ = UφρU †
φ, where the phase-space rotation operator is given by Uφ :=
exp (−iφˆa†ˆa) in terms of creation and annihilation operators. The phase-space
12The ﬁlter function in [30] agrees with our Kθ(−y, p′) up to substituting −y with y and
switching arguments, which is usually immaterial as Kθ(−y, p′) = Kθ(p′, y) for all ﬁlter
functions seen in practice.

distribution function is covariant under phase-space rotations,13 i.e., Fρφ(Ω, θ)
= Fρ(Ω−φ, θ), if the ﬁlter function Kθ(Ω) (or equivalently the parity operator
Πθ) is invariant under rotations. Here, Ω−φ is the inversely rotated phase-space
coordinate, e.g., α−φ = exp (iφ)α. As a consequence of this symmetry, the cor-
responding parity operators are diagonal in the number-state representation,
i.e., ⟨n|Πθ|m⟩∝δnm.
Property 5. Postulate (ii): The phase-space distribution function Fρ(Ω, θ) is
real if Πθ is self-adjoint. This condition translates to the symmetry K∗
θ (−Ω) =
Kθ(Ω) of the ﬁlter function.
Property 6. Postulate (iiia): The trace of a trace-class operator Tr [ρ] is mapped
to the phase-space integral

Fρ(Ω, θ) dΩ if the corresponding ﬁlter function
satisﬁes Kθ(0) = 1. Note that this property also implies that the trace exists,
i.e., Tr(Πθ) = Kθ(0)/2, in some particular basis, even though Πθ might not be
of trace class.

[Kθ(x, p)]|x=0 = 1. This follows, e.g., directly from Proposition 14 in Sec. 7.2.2
of [43].
4.3. Relation to Quantization
The Weyl quantization of a tempered distribution a ∈S′(R2) is obtained
from the Grossmann–Royer operator in Eq. (16) (cf. [43, Sec. 6.3., Def. 7 and
13Note that any physically motivated distribution function must be covariant under π/2
rotations in phase-space, which corresponds to the Fourier transform of pure states and
connects coordinate representations ψ(x) to momentum representations ψ(p).

Prop. 9]), i.e.,
OpWeyl(a) = (πℏ)−1a(DΠD†).
(32)
More precisely, OpWeyl(a) : S(R) →S′(R) is the well-deﬁned linear map
[OpWeyl(a)ψ](x) = (πℏ)−1a[(DΠD†ψ)(x)]
(33)
for all ψ ∈S(R), x ∈R, where the argument of a is the Schwartz function
Ω →(D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω)ψ)(x) on R2 [43, Sec. 6.3., Prop. 13]. If a is generated by a
phase-space function a : R2 →C, i.e., a ≡⟨a∗, ·⟩, then
OpWeyl(a) = (πℏ)−1

a(Ω) D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω) dΩ = (2πℏ)−1

aσ(Ω) D(Ω) dΩ,
(34)
where the symplectic Fourier transform aσ(Ω) = [Fσa(·)](Ω) is used for the
second equality. Thus, OpWeyl is similar to the generalized parity operator in
the sense that it maps a function (or tempered distribution) to a linear operator
which acts on real-valued functions. This is not by chance as these two objects
are very much related to each other: recall that quantizations associated with
the Cohen class Opθ(a) are essentially Weyl quantizations of convolved phase-
space functions up to coordinate reﬂection, i.e., Opθ(a) := OpWeyl(θ∨∗a)
where θ∨(ψ) := θ(ψ∨) for all ψ ∈S(R2). If θ is an admissible kernel in the
sense of Sect. 4.1, then formally
Opθ(a) = (πℏ)−1

(θ∨∗a)(Ω) D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω) dΩ
(35)
= (2πℏ)−1

aσ(Ω)Kθ(Ω) D(Ω) dΩ,
(36)
cf. [43, Sec. 7.2.4, Prop. 17]. The symplectic Fourier transform [Fσ(θ∨∗a)](Ω) =
aσ(Ω)Kθ(Ω) (as functionals on S(R2) so in particular ⟨θ∨∗a, ·⟩∈S′(R2)) from
Theorem 1 is used for the second equality, refer to §7.2.4 in [43].
Proposition 1. Let θ, a ∈S′(R2) be given such that θ is admissible and the
parity operator Πθ from Deﬁnition 3 is in B(L2(R)). If a is generated by a
phase-space function a : R2 →C (i.e., a ≡⟨a∗, ·⟩) and if ⟨θ∨∗a, ·⟩∈S′(R2),
then
Opθ(a) = (πℏ)−1

a(Ω) D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω) dΩ
in analogy to (34) as quadratic forms on S(R).
Proof. The Plancherel formula

a(Ω)b(Ω) dΩ =

aσ(Ω)bσ(−Ω) dΩ implies
that
Opθ(a) = (2πℏ)−1

aσ(Ω)Kθ(Ω) D(Ω) dΩ
= (2πℏ)−1

Fσ[aσ(·)](Ω) Fσ[Kθ(·) D(·)](−Ω) dΩ,
where the equality D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω) =

2Fσ[K(·)D(·)](−Ω) follows from (29)
(Theorem 1) and Fσ[aσ(·)](Ω) = a(Ω) is applied.

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
This result motivates the following extension of Eq. (32), special cases of
which have already appeared in [12, Eq. (36)] as well as [55, (3.24)]:
Deﬁnition 5. The quantization Opθ(a) of any a ∈S′(R2) is deﬁned to be
Opθ(a) = (πℏ)−1a(DΠθD†)
in the sense of Eq. (33).
One can consider single Fourier components ei(p0x−x0p)/ℏ=: fΩ0(Ω), for
which the Weyl quantization yields the displacement operator OpWeyl(fΩ0) =
D(Ω0) from Sect. 3.1, refer to Proposition 51 in [44] or Proposition 11 in
Sec. 6.3.2 of [43]. Let us now consider the θ-type quantization of a single Fourier
component, which results in the displacement operator being multiplied by the
corresponding ﬁlter function via (35)–(36). Substituting aσ(Ω) = Fσ[fΩ0](Ω)
into (35), one obtains
Opθ(fΩ0) = Kθ(Ω0)D(Ω0)
and
Πθ = (4πℏ)−1

Opθ(fΩ0) dΩ0.
The second equality follows from (22), and it speciﬁes the parity operator as
a phase-space average of quantizations of single Fourier components.
But it is even more instructive to consider the case of the delta distribu-
tion δ(2), the Weyl quantization of which yields the Grossmann–Royer parity
operator OpWeyl(δ(2)) = πℏΠ (as obtained in [64]). Applying (35), the Cohen
quantization of the delta distribution yields the parity operator from (22). In
particular, the operator Πθ from Deﬁnition 3 is a θ-type quantization of the
delta distribution as
Πθ = (πℏ)−1 Opθ(δ(2)) = (πℏ)−1 OpWeyl(θ∨),
(37)
or equivalently, the Weyl quantization of the Cohen kernel, up to coordinate
reﬂection. Since Πθ is the Weyl quantization of the tempered distribution θ∨∈
S′(R2), one can adapt results contained in [38] to precisely state conditions on
θ, for which bounded operators Πθ are obtained via their Weyl quantizations,
refer also to Property 1. For example, square-integrable θ ∈L2(R2) result
in Hilbert–Schmidt operators Πθ, absolutely integrable θ ∈L1(R2) result in
compact operators Πθ, and Schwartz functions θ ∈S(R2) result in trace-class
operators Πθ, refer to [38].
We consider now a class of explicit quantization schemes along the lines of
[3,22,23,43] which are motivated by diﬀerent (τ, s)-orderings of non-commuting
operators ˆx and ˆp or ˆa and ˆa† (−1 ≤s ≤1 and 0 ≤τ ≤1). This class is
obtained via the (τ, s)-parametrized ﬁlter function (where the relation α =

which admits the symmetries Kτs(Ω) = Kτs(−Ω) and K∗

the resulting parity operators are bounded as is readily veriﬁed; hence, the cor-
responding distribution functions are in the Cohen class with Kτs(Ω) ∈S′(R2)
due to Theorem 1. Important, well-known special cases are summarized in Ta-
ble 2, refer also to [3,4,22,43].

are obtained via the kernel function in (38) and recover well-known phase-space
distribution functions14 for particular cases of τ or s, which are motivated
by the ordering schemes Opτs(fΩ0) from Table 2. Important special cases of
these distribution functions and their corresponding ﬁlter functions and Cohen
kernels are summarized in Table 3.
In particular, the parameters τ = 1/2 and s = 0 identify the Wigner
function with K1/2,0(Ω) ≡1 and (39) reduces to (15). Note that the corre-
sponding Cohen kernel θ from Theorem 1 is the two-dimensional delta dis-
tribution δ(2)(Ω) and that convolving with δ(2)(Ω) is the identity operation,
i.e., δ(2) ∗Wρ = Wρ [see (28)].
The ﬁlter function Kτs from (38) for a ﬁxed parameter of τ = 1/2 results
in the Gaussian Ks(Ω) := K1/2,s(Ω) = exp [ s
2|α|2]. The corresponding parity
operators are diagonal in the number-state representation (refer to Property 4),
and they can be speciﬁed for −1 ≤s < 1 in terms of number-state projectors
14This family of phase-space representations is related to the one considered in [3,4] by
setting λ = s/2 and μ = −ν = 2τ −1/4.

We further discuss the representation of Πs in terms of creation and annihila-
tion operators in Remark 9 (Sect. 5.3). This form has implicitly appeared in,
e.g., [22,98,102]. We provide a more concise proof in “Appendix E.” Equation

Note that for s > 0 the corresponding ﬁlter functions lie outside of our frame-
work as then Ks ̸∈S′(R2) due to its superexponential growth. While one can
still formally write down their distribution functions, one runs into convergence
problems resulting in singularities. However, their symplectic Fourier trans-
form always exists and it is related to the Wigner function via Ks(Ω)Fσ[Wρ](Ω)
by multiplying with the ﬁlter function Ks(Ω) (cf. Remark 2). This class of s-
parametrized phase-space representations has gained widespread applications
in quantum optics and beyond [32,60,94,111,125], and they correspond to
Gaussian convolved Wigner functions
Fρ(Ω, s) = F|0⟩(Ω, s+1) ∗Wρ(Ω),
for s < 0 such as the Husimi Q function for s = −1. Note that the Cohen kernel
θs via Theorem 1 corresponds to the vacuum state F|0⟩(Ω, s+1) of a quantum
harmonic oscillator [22]. Gaussian deconvolutions of the Wigner function are
formally obtained for s > 0, which includes the Glauber P function for s =

1 [22]. Due to the rotational symmetry of its ﬁlter function Ks(Ω), the s-
parametrized distribution functions are covariant under phase-space rotations,
refer to Property 4.
Another important special case is obtained for the ﬁxed parameter s = 0
which results in Shubin’s τ-distribution, refer to [16–18,43]. Its ﬁlter function
from (38) reduces to the chirp function
Kτ0(Ω) =: Kτ(Ω) = exp [i(2τ−1)px/(2ℏ)]
while relying on the parametrization with x and p. The resulting distribution
functions Fρ(Ω, τ) are in the Cohen class due to Theorem 1, and they are square
integrable following Property 2 as the absolute value of Kτ(Ω) is bounded. We
calculate the explicit action of the corresponding parity operator Πτ.
Theorem 2. The action of the τ-parametrized parity operator Πτ := Πτ0 on
some coordinate representation ψ(x) ∈L2(R) is explicitly given for any τ ̸= 1
by
Πτψ(x) =
1
2|τ−1|ψ( τx
τ−1),
(41)
which for the special case τ = 1/2 reduces (as expected) to the usual parity
operator Π. It follows that Πτ is bounded for every 0 < τ < 1 (or in general
for every real τ that is not equal to 0 or 1) and its operator norm is given by
∥Πτ∥sup = 1/

4(τ−τ 2).
Proof. By (39), the parity operator Πτ acts on the coordinate representation
ψ(x) via
Πτψ(x) = (4πℏ)−1

Kτ0(Ω) D(Ω)ψ(x) dΩ.
This integral can be evaluated using the explicit form of Kτ0(Ω) from (38),
and the action of D on coordinate representations ψ(x) from (11) yields

This parity operator is bounded for every 0 < τ < 1, and its expectation
value gives rise to well-deﬁned distribution functions (Property 1) which are
also integrable as Kτ(0) = 1 (Property 6). Note that this family of distribution
functions Fρ(Ω, τ, 0) for τ ̸= 1/2 does not satisfy Property 5, i.e., self-adjoint
operators ρ are mapped to complex functions. In particular, the symmetry
K∗
τ (Ω) = K1−τ(Ω) implies that
Fρ†(Ω, τ) = F ∗
ρ (Ω, 1−τ).
In the following, we will rely on this τ-parametrized family to construct and
analyze the parity operator of the Born–Jordan distribution.
5. The Born–Jordan Distribution
5.1. Parity Operator Description of the Born–Jordan Distribution
The Born–Jordan distribution Fρ(Ω, BJ) is an element of the Cohen class
[17,28,43] and is obtained by averaging over the τ-distributions Fρ(Ω, τ) ∈
L2(R2):
Fρ(Ω, BJ) :=
 1
0
Fρ(Ω, τ) dτ.
(42)
As in Deﬁnition 4, this distribution function is also obtained via the expecta-
tion value of a parity operator.
Theorem 3. The Born–Jordan distribution Fρ(Ω, BJ) of a density operator
ρ ∈B1(L2(R)) is an element of the Cohen class, and it is obtained as the
expectation value
Fρ(Ω, BJ) = (πℏ)−1 Tr [ ρ D(Ω)ΠBJD†(Ω)]
(43)
of the (displaced) parity operator ΠBJ that is deﬁned by the relation
ΠBJ := (4πℏ)−1

KBJ(Ω)D(Ω) dΩ,
(44)
where KBJ(Ω) = sinc(a) = sin(a)/a is the cardinal sine function with the
argument a = (2ℏ)−1 px = i[(α∗)2−α2]/4. Here, one applies the substitution
α = (λx + ip/λ)/
√
2ℏfrom Sect. 3.1 and the expression for a is independent
of λ.

B. Koczor et al.
Ann. Henri Poincar´e
Proof. Combining Eqs. (42) and (27), the Born–Jordan distribution is the
expectation value
Fρ(Ω, BJ) = (πℏ)−1 Tr [ ρ D(Ω)(
 1

Πτ0 dτ)D†(Ω)],
and the corresponding parity operator can be expanded as
ΠBJ = (4πℏ)−1
  1

Kτ0(Ω) dτ

D(Ω) dΩ.
Using the explicit form of Kτ0(Ω) from (38), the evaluation of the integral

0
Kτ0(Ω) dτ =
 1

over τ concludes the proof.
□
This conﬁrms that the Born–Jordan distribution Fρ(Ω, BJ) ∈L2(R2) is
square integrable following Property 2 as the absolute value of its ﬁlter function
is bounded, i.e., |sinc[(2ℏ)−1 px] | ≤1 for all (x, p) ∈R2. The ﬁlter function KBJ
satisﬁes KBJ(x, 0) = KBJ(0, p) = 1, and the Born–Jordan distribution there-
fore gives rise to the correct marginals as quantum-mechanical probabilities
(Property 7). In particular, integrating over the Born–Jordan distribution re-
produces the quantum-mechanical probability densities, i.e.,

Fρ(x, p, BJ) dx =
|ψ(p)|2 and

Fρ(x, p, BJ) dp = |ψ(x)|2.
Most importantly the operator ΠBJ is bounded, meaning Born–Jordan
distributions are well deﬁned and bounded for all quantum states, refer to
Property 1. Also, the largest (generalized) eigenvalue of ΠBJ is exactly π/2 as
shown in Theorem 5.
Proposition 2. The Born–Jordan parity operator ΠBJ is bounded and an upper
bound of its operator norm is given by ∥ΠBJ∥sup ≤π/2.
Proof. Using the Πτ-representation of ΠBJ, we compute

for arbitrary ψ(x) ∈L2(R). In the second-to-last step, we used Theorem 2.
□
It is well known that the Born–Jordan distribution is related to the
Wigner function via a convolution with the Cohen kernel θBJ, refer to [43,44].
However, calculating this kernel, or the corresponding parity operator directly
might prove diﬃcult. In the following, we establish a more convenient repre-
sentation of the Born–Jordan parity operator which is an “average” of Πτ from
Theorem 2 via the formal integral transformation
ΠBJ =
 1

Πτ dτ,
(45)

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
which—as in Sect. 3.2—is interpreted as ΠBJψ(x) =
 1
0 Πτψ(x) dτ for all
ψ(x) ∈L2(R). Recall that the parity operator Πτ is well deﬁned and bounded
for every 0 < τ < 1.
Remark 4. Note that evaluating ΠBJψ(x) at x = 0 for some ψ(x) ∈L2(R)
with ψ(0) ̸= 0 leads to a divergent integral in (45). This comes from the
singularity at τ = 1 in (41). However, we will later see that this is harmless
as it only happens on a set of measure zero (so one can deﬁne ΠBJψ(x)|x=0 to
be 0 or ψ(0) or arbitrary) and, more importantly, that ψ(x) ∈L2(R) implies
ΠBJψ(x) ∈L2(R) (Proposition 2).
Following [27] and Chapter 2.3 in [88], the squeezing operator is deﬁned
to be
S(ξ) := exp[ iξ
2 (ˆpˆx+ˆxˆp)] = exp[ iξ
2 (ˆa2−(ˆa†)2)]
(46)
(where ξ ∈R), and it acts on a coordinate representation via S(ξ)ψ(x) =
eξ/2ψ(eξx).
Theorem 4. The Born–Jordan parity operator
ΠBJ = [ 1

−∞
sech(ξ/2)S(ξ) dξ ] Π
(47)
is a composition of the reﬂection operator Π followed by a squeezing opera-
tor (and the two operations commute), and this expression is integrated with
respect to a well-behaved weight function sech(ξ/2) = 2/(eξ/2+e−ξ/2). Note
that the function sech(ξ/2) ∈S(R) is fast decreasing and invariant under the
Fourier transform (e.g., as Hermite polynomials).
Proof. The explicit action of ΠBJ on a coordinate representation ψ(x) ∈L2(R)
is given by (see Theorem 2)
ΠBJψ(x) =
 1
0
Πτψ(x) dτ =
 1

2|τ−1|ψ( τx
τ−1) dτ.
Applying a change of variables eξ = τ/(1−τ) with ξ ∈R yields the substitu-
tions τ = 1/(1+e−ξ), 1/(2|τ−1|) = (1+eξ)/2, and dτ = eξ/(1+eξ)2 dξ. One
obtains
ΠBJψ(x) =
 ∞
−∞
eξ
2(1+eξ)ψ(−eξx) dξ.
Let us recognize that ψ(−eξx) = e−ξ/2S(ξ) Π ψ(x) is the composition of a
coordinate reﬂection and a squeezing of the pure state ψ(x); also, the two
operations commute. This results in the explicit action
ΠBJψ(x) =
 ∞
−∞
eξ/2
2(1+eξ)S(ξ) Π ψ(x) dξ,
where eξ/2/[2(1+eξ)] = [2(e−ξ/2+eξ/2)]−1 concludes the proof.
□
The expression for the parity operator in Theorem 4 is very instructive
when compared to Theorem 3, and this conﬁrms that the parity operator
ΠBJ decomposes into the usual parity operator Π followed by a geometric

transformation, refer also to Sect. 5.3. In the case of the Born–Jordan parity
operator this geometric transformation is an average of squeezing operators.
Remark 5. The Born–Jordan distribution is covariant under squeezing, which
means that the squeezed density operator ρ′ = S(ξ)ρS†(ξ) is mapped to the in-
versely squeezed phase-space representation Fρ′(x, p, BJ) = Fρ(e−ξx, eξp, BJ).
The form of ΠBJ given in (47) allows for an alternative proof of Proposi-
tion 2:
Remark 6. Recalling ∥ΠBJ∥sup = sup∥φ(x)∥L2=1 ∥ΠBJφ(x)∥L2, the norm of the
function ΠBJφ(x) for any φ(x) with ∥φ(x)∥L2 = 1 can be expressed as

and it was used that Π†Π = Π2 = 1 and S†(ξ)S(ξ′) = S(ξ′−ξ). Since S(ξ′−ξ)
is unitary, one obtains that |⟨φ|S(ξ′−ξ)φ⟩| ≤1. Finally,
∥ΠBJφ∥2
L2 ≤

sech(ξ/2)sech(ξ′/2) dξ dξ′ = π2/4.
5.2. Spectral Decomposition of the Born–Jordan Parity Operator
We will now adapt results for generalized spectral decompositions, refer to
[26,27,57,95]. This will allow us to solve the generalized eigenvalue equation
for parity operators and to determine their spectral decompositions.
Recall the following from Sect. 2.1: The distributional pairing for smooth,
well-behaved functions ψ(x) ∈S(R) in with respect to tempered distributions
a ∈S′(R) (such as functions of slow growth a(x)) extends to L2-scalar products
of the form ⟨a, ψ⟩=

R a∗(x)ψ(x) dx, which corresponds to a rigged Hilbert
space [26,57] or the Gelfand triple S(R) ⊂L2(R) ⊂S′(R). This rigged Hilbert
space allows us to specify the generalized spectral decomposition of the Born–
Jordan parity operator with generalized eigenvectors in S′(R) as functions of
slow growth.
It was shown in the previous section that the Born–Jordan parity operator
ΠBJ is a composition of a coordinate reﬂection and a squeezing operator. We
now recapitulate results on the spectral decomposition of the squeezing opera-
tor from [19,26,27], up to minor modiﬁcations. Recall that the squeezing oper-
ator forms a unitary, strongly continuous one-parameter group S(ξ) = e−iξH
with ξ ∈R that is generated by the (unbounded) self-adjoint Hamiltonian
H := −1
2(ˆxˆp+ˆpˆx) = −1
2[ˆa2−(ˆa†)2].
This Hamiltonian admits a purely continuous spectrum E ∈R and satisﬁes
generalized eigenvalue equations

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
for every ψ ∈S(R), where the last equation is equivalent to H|ψE
±⟩= E|ψE
±⟩.
The Gelfand–Maurin spectral theorem [26,57,95] results in a spectral resolu-
tion of
H =

−∞
E |ψE

±| dE.
Here, the generalized eigenvectors are speciﬁed in terms of their coordinate
representations as slowly increasing functions, i.e., ψE
±(x) := ⟨x|ψE
±⟩∈S′(R)
with
ψE
+(x) =
1
2√π|x|−(iE+ 1
2 ) and ψE
−(x) =
1
2√πsgn(x)|x|−(iE+ 1
2 ),
(48)
refer to [26,27,57,95] and “Appendix F” for more details. Note that ψE
±(x) are
generalized eigenfunctions: They are not square integrable, but the integral

R[ψE
±(x)]∗φ(x) dx exists as a distributional pairing for every φ ∈S(R). Also,
note that these generalized eigenvectors can be decomposed into the number-
state basis with ﬁnite expansion coeﬃcients that decrease to zero for large n,
refer to “Appendix F.” The spectral decomposition of the squeezing operator
is then given by
S(ξ) =
 ∞
−∞
e−iEξ[ |ψE

+| + |ψE
−⟩⟨ψE
−| ] dE,
refer to Eq. 6.12 in [26] and Eq. 2.14 in [27]. Note that these eigenvectors are
also invariant under the Fourier transform (e.g., as Hermite polynomials).
It immediately follows that the squeezing operator satisﬁes the general-
ized eigenvalue equation
S(ξ)|ψE
±⟩= e−iξE |ψE

Remark 7. Recall that ΠBJ is a bounded (by Proposition 2) and self-adjoint
operator. Consequently, the usual spectral theorem in multiplication operator
form [66, Thm. 7.20] yields a σ-ﬁnite measure space (X, μ), a bounded, mea-
surable, real-valued function h on X, and unitary U : L2(R) →L2(X, μ) such
that
[UΠBJU −1(ψ)](λ) = h(λ)ψ(λ)
for all ψ ∈L2(X, μ) and λ ∈X. While this undoubtedly is a nice represen-
tation, the spectral decomposition in Theorem 5 is more readily determined
with the help of the Gelfand–Maurin spectral theorem [26,57,95]. In particu-
lar, the said theorem lets us directly work with the generalized eigenfunctions
in Eq. (48), even though they are not square integrable.
5.3. Geometric Interpretation of Parity Operators
While, above, we have comprehensively explored analytic properties of the
Born–Jordan and other practically important parity operators, here we re-
late these mathematical objects to geometric transformations. Even the rather
complex Born–Jordan parity operator admits a surprisingly simple decompo-
sition into two elementary geometric transformations. Equation (47) decom-
poses the Born–Jordan parity operator into an ordinary reﬂection of the wave
function’s coordinate followed by a weighted average of squeezing operations
as ΠBJ = [ 1
4
 ∞
−∞sech(ξ/2)S(ξ) dξ ] Π. As such, the action on any wave func-
tion ψ(x) ∈L2(R) can be summarized as the reﬂected, squeezed function
S(ξ)Π ψ(x) = eξ/2ψ(−eξx) averaged over all parameters ξ ∈(−∞, ∞) with
respect to the rapidly decaying weight function sech(ξ/2).
It is not only the Born–Jordan parity operator that admits a simple
geometric interpretation; rather this seems to hint at a universal property, at
least in the classes of practically important phase-space representations. In
particular, we now state that both Πτ and the pivotal parity operator Πs—
which contains the most popular variants of Wigner, Husimi, and Glauber P
phase-space functions as special cases—can be decomposed into elementary
geometric transformations.
Remark 8. Applying the substitution eξ := τ/(1−τ), the parity operator Πτ
from (41) can be decomposed for 0 < τ < 1 into
Πτ = cosh(ξ/2)S(ξ) Π
which consists of a coordinate reﬂection and a squeezing.
Consequently, the parity operator Πτ admits a spectral decomposition
Πτ = cosh(ξ/2)

where ⟨ψE

Remark 9. The parity operator with κs := ln[(1+s)/(1−s)] and −1 < s < 1
is the composition
Πs = (1−s)−1eκsˆa†ˆa Π

Phase Spaces, Parity Operators
from (40) of the usual coordinate reﬂection Π followed by a positive semi-
deﬁnite operator. In particular, Π−1 = 1
2 |0⟩⟨0| Π. Note that the positive semi-

s < 0, refer to [89]. Of course domain restrictions might need to be considered
for s > 0 as discussed earlier.
6. Explicit Matrix Representation of the Born–Jordan Parity
Operator
Recall that the s-parametrized parity operators Πs are diagonal in the Fock
basis and their diagonal entries can be computed using the simple expression
in (40). This enables the experimental reconstruction of distribution functions
from photon-count statistics [7,14,46,93] in quantum optics.
Remark 10. The Born–Jordan parity operator ΠBJ is not diagonal in the
number-state basis, as its ﬁlter function KBJ(Ω) is not invariant under ar-
bitrary phase-space rotations, refer to Property 4. The ﬁlter function KBJ(Ω)
is, however, invariant under π/2 rotations in phase space, and therefore, only
every fourth oﬀ-diagonal is nonzero.
We now discuss the number-state representation of the parity operator
ΠBJ, which provides a convenient way to calculate (or, more precisely, approx-
imate) Born–Jordan distributions.
Theorem 6. The matrix elements [ΠBJ]mn := ⟨m|ΠBJ n⟩of the Born–Jordan
parity operator in the Fock basis can be calculated in the form of a ﬁnite sum

Figure 1a shows the ﬁrst 8×8 entries of [ΠBJ]. One observes the following
structure: Only every fourth oﬀ-diagonal is nonzero, the matrix is real and
symmetric, and the entries along every diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal decrease in
their absolute value. In particular, the diagonal elements of ΠBJ admit the
following special property.
Proposition 3. For every n ∈{0, 1, 2, . . .}, the diagonal entries of ΠBJ in the
Fock basis are

(54)
In particular, [ΠBJ]nn →0 as n →∞. For a proof, we refer to “Appendix I.”
Note that the sum of these decreasing diagonal entries results in a trace
Tr[ΠBJ] = 1/2 (Property 6) in the number-state basis. However, this trace
does not necessarily exist in an arbitrary basis, as ΠBJ is not a trace-class
operator.
Remark 11. Let us emphasize that boundedness of ΠBJ (Proposition 2) guar-
antees that using a (large enough) ﬁnite block of ΠBJ for computations yields
a good approximation of Fρ(Ω, BJ), refer to “Appendix C” for details.
In the following, we specify a more convenient form for the calculation
of these matrix elements, i.e., a direct recursion without summation, which is
based on the following conjecture (see “Appendix J”).
Conjecture 1. The nonzero matrix elements
[ΠBJ]k+4ℓ,k = [ΠBJ]k,k+4ℓ= Γkℓ[Mkℓ+ δℓ0 arcsinh(1)/
√
2],
(55)
of the Born–Jordan parity operator are determined by a set of rational numbers
Mkℓwhere Γkℓ= 2−2ℓ+1/2
k!/(k+4ℓ)! and k, ℓ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . }. The indexing
is speciﬁed relative to the diagonal (where ℓ= 0) and δℓm is the Kronecker
delta. The rational numbers Mkℓcan be calculated recursively using only 8
numbers as initial conditions, refer to “Appendix J” for details. Unlike (50),
this form does not require a summation.
Figure 1b shows the ﬁrst 6 × 6 elements of the recursive sequence of
rational numbers Mkℓ. The ﬁrst column of Mk0 corresponds to the diagonal of
the matrix [ΠBJ]mn from Fig. 1a. For example, for k = 5 one obtains M5,0 =
−43/60, which corresponds to [ΠBJ]5,5 = Γ5,0[M5,0 + δ0,0 arcsinh(1)/
√
2] and
Γ5,0 =
√
2, and therefore [ΠBJ]5,5 = −43
√
2/60 + arcsinh(1) as detailed in
Fig. 1a.

The direct recursion in Conjecture 1 enables us to conveniently and ef-
ﬁciently calculate the matrix elements [ΠBJ]mn, and we have veriﬁed the cor-
rectness of this approach for up to 6400 matrix elements, i.e., by calculating a
matrix representation of size 80×80. This facilitates an eﬃcient calculation and
plotting of Born–Jordan distributions for harmonic oscillator systems, such as
in quantum optics [60,88,94]. Note that a recursively calculated 80×80 matrix
representation, which we have veriﬁed with exact calculations, is suﬃcient for
most physical applications, i.e., Figs. 2 and 3 were calculated using 30 × 30
matrix representations. However, a matrix representation of size 2000 × 2000
can be easily calculated on a current notebook computer using the recursive
method. Numerical evidence shows that the matrix representation of ΠBJ can
be well-approximated by a low-rank matrix, i.e., diagonalizing the matrix ΠBJ
reveals only very few signiﬁcant eigenvalues. In particular, the sum of squares
of the ﬁrst 9 eigenvalues corresponds to approximately 99.97% of the sum of
squares of all the eigenvalues of a 2000 × 2000 matrix representation.

Matrix representations of parity operators are used to conveniently calculate
phase-space representations for bosonic quantum states via their associated

of the associated Laguerre polynomials from (10), which are weighted by their
parity operator elements. The corresponding phase-space functions are radi-
ally symmetric as |[D(Ω)]nμ|2 depends only on the radial distance x2 + p2.
The Wigner functions in Fig. 2a, b are radially symmetric and show strong
oscillations, which are sometimes regarded as a quantum-mechanical feature
[88].
In contrast, the Born–Jordan parity operator is not diagonal in the number-
state representation and it can be written in terms of projectors as ΠBJ =
	
μ=0[ΠBJ]μμ|μ⟩⟨μ|+	
μ=0
	
ν=1[ΠBJ]μ,4ν (|μ+4ν⟩⟨μ|+|μ⟩⟨μ+4ν|). The Born–

The Born–Jordan distribution of coherent states, i.e., the displaced vacuum
states, closely matches the Wigner functions, see Fig. 2a. The ﬁrst part in
Eq. (56) contains the diagonal elements of the parity operator which corre-
spond to the radially symmetric part of F|n⟩(Ω, BJ), see Fig. 3b (left). The

second part in Eq. (57) results in a radially non-symmetric function, see Fig. 3b
(right). The radially symmetric parts are quite similar to the Wigner function
and have n + 1 wave fronts enclosed by the Bohr–Sommerfeld band [48,88],
i.e., the ring with radius √2n+1. The radially non-symmetric functions have
n + 1 local maxima along the outer squares, i.e., along phase-space cuts at the
Bohr–Sommerfeld distance x, p ∝√2n+1. The sum of these two contributions
is the Born–Jordan distribution, and it is not radially symmetric for number
states, see Fig. 3a.
8. Conclusion
We have introduced parity operators Πθ which give rise to a rich family of
phase-space distribution functions of quantum states. These phase-space func-
tions have been previously deﬁned in terms of convolutions, integral trans-
formations, or Fourier transformations. Our approach using parity operators
is both conceptually and computationally advantageous and now allows for
a direct calculation of phase-space functions as quantum-mechanical expec-
tation values. This approach therefore averts the necessity for the repeated
and expensive computation of Fourier transformations. We motivate the name
“parity operator” by the fact that parity operators Πθ = Aθ ◦Π are com-
posed of the usual parity operator and some speciﬁc geometric or physical
transformation. We detailed the explicit form of parity operators for various
phase spaces and, in particular, for the Born–Jordan distribution. We have
also obtained a generalized spectral decomposition of the Born–Jordan parity
operator, proved its boundedness, and explicitly calculated its matrix repre-
sentation in the number-state basis. We conjecture that these matrix elements
are determined by a proposed recursive scheme which allows for an eﬃcient
computation of Born–Jordan distribution functions. Moreover, large matrix
representations of the Born–Jordan parity operator can be well approximated
using rank-9 matrices. All this will be useful to connect our results with appli-
cations in (e.g.,) quantum optics, where techniques such as squeezing operators
and the number-state representation are widely used.

A Extension of Operators from Schwartz Functions to
Distributions
Assume we have a linear operator T : S(R) →S(R) or, more generally, T :
S(R) →(R →C) and we want to extend its action to tempered distributions.
Usually, this is done by introducing some operator ˆT : S(R) →(R →C)
(which can—but does not have to—be the same as T) such that
(Tφ)(ψ) := φ( ˆTψ)
(58)

B. Koczor et al.
Ann. Henri Poincar´e
for all φ ∈DT := {φ ∈S′(R) : φ ◦ˆT ∈S′(R)} and all ψ ∈S(R). Usually, ˆT is
chosen such that (58) is consistent with the action of T on those distributions
which are generated by Schwartz functions. More precisely, one ﬁxes some
injective, usually linear or antilinear map e : S(R) →S′(R) and requires that
ˆT is chosen such that [T, e] ≡0, i.e.,
e(φ)( ˆTψ) =

T(e(φ))

(ψ) =

(T ◦e)(φ)

(ψ) =

(e ◦T)(φ)

(ψ) = e(Tφ)(ψ)
for all φ, ψ ∈S(R) with e(φ) ∈DT . Thus, by identifying φ ∈S(R) with the
tempered distribution e(φ) ∈S′(R) an extension is deﬁned such that there
is only a “formal” diﬀerence between the action of T on φ compared to the
action of T on e(φ). Let us illustrate this by means of a simple example:
Example 3. Consider the displacement operator from Eq. (11) which acts on
any function ψ : R →C—so in particular on any Schwartz function—via
[D(x0, p0)ψ](x) = exp[ip0(x−x0/2)/ℏ]ψ(x−x0) for all x, x0, p0 ∈R. Depending
on how one deﬁnes the distributional pairing of two classical functions, there
are two ways to extend D to S′(R):
(1) The usual way of embedding S(R) →S′(R) is done via the linear map
ι(ψ) :=

ψ(x)(·)(x) dx. Then for all φ, ψ ∈S(R) and all Ω ∈R2 one ﬁnds [44,
Eq. (1.11)]
ι(φ)

D(Ω)ψ

= ι

D∧x(Ω)φ

ψ or, equivalently ι

D(Ω)φ

ψ = ι(φ)

D∧x(Ω)ψ

where D∧x(x0, p0) := D(−x0, p0) for all x0, p0 ∈R. This suggests setting
ˆT := D∧x in (58) because this way one has [D(Ω), ι] ≡0, that is, D(Ω)(ι(φ)) ≡
ι(D(Ω)φ) for all Ω ∈R2 and all φ : R →C such that

φ(x)(·)(x) dx ∈S′(R).
In other words this extension of the displacement operator is consistent with
its action on S(R) by means of the embedding ι.
(2) One may also consider the canonical (antilinear, bijective) map from L2(R)
to its dual space (L2(R))∗from the Riesz representation theorem which acts via
⟨· | (ψ) := ⟨ψ| · ⟩:=

ψ(x)∗(·)(x) dx. One readily veriﬁes that ⟨φ|D(Ω)ψ⟩=
⟨D(−Ω)φ|ψ⟩for all φ, ψ ∈L2(R), i.e., D(Ω)† = D(−Ω) for all Ω ∈R2. Setting
ˆT := D(Ω)† in (58) thus yields an extension of D which is consistent with
respect to ⟨· | : one ﬁnds [D(Ω)⟨· | ] ≡0, that is, for all φ, ψ ∈S(R)
D(Ω)(⟨φ, · ⟩)(ψ)
(58)
= ⟨φ, D(−Ω)ψ⟩= ⟨D(Ω)φ, ψ⟩= ⟨D(Ω)φ, · ⟩(ψ).
Having introduced the concept of operator extensions, we may apply it to
generalized parity operators. But ﬁrst let us generalize Deﬁnition 3 to arbitrary
tempered distributions θ, even though this is beyond what we need in the main
sections of this article.
Remark 12. Formally (22) can be rewritten as Πθ = (4πℏ)−1⟨K∗
θ , D⟩. Because
admissible kernels by deﬁnition satisfy ⟨K∗
θ , ψ⟩= 2πℏ[Fσ(θ)]ψ for ψ ∈S(R),
this leads to an extension of Deﬁnition 3 to arbitrary θ ∈S′(R2) via the linear
operator Πθ : S(R) →(R →C), Πθ := 1
2[Fσ(θ) ◦D], i.e.,
(Πθψ)(x) = 1
2Fσ(θ)(Dψ(x)) = 1
2θ

Fσ(Dψ(x))

for all ψ ∈S(R), x ∈R. Here, Dψ(x) ∈S(R2) deﬁned via Ω →(D(Ω)ψ)(x)
is the displacement of ψ at x as a function of Ω. One readily veriﬁes that for
admissible kernels this deﬁnition reproduces (25) as well as the deﬁnition of
the parity operator in (15).
Similar to Example 3(1), let us extend Πθ with respect to the embedding
ι : S(R) →S′(R), that is, we have to ﬁnd an operator ˜Πθ : S(R) →(R →C)
such that ι(φ)(˜Πθψ) = ι(Πθφ)(ψ) for all ψ, φ ∈S(R). We claim that
˜Πθ := 1

2[Fσ( ∗◦θ ◦∗) ◦D] is indeed the extension

In general, these two extensions will be diﬀerent so one has to be careful
about which framework one uses. However, from the explicit form of ˜Πθ one
knows that for any θ ∈S′(R2) these extensions coincide if and only if θ∧p ≡
∗◦θ ◦∗. This translates to ﬁlter functions as follows:
Lemma 3. Consider any admissible θ ∈S′(R2) with associated ﬁlter function
Kθ : R2 →C. The extension of Πθ with respect to ι coincides with the extension
of Πθ with respect to ⟨· | if and only if K∗

B Proofs of Lemma 2 and Theorem 1
Before we dive into the proofs of the results in question, we ﬁrst need a lemma
which relates convolutions of the cross-Wigner transform with matrix elements
of the generalized Grossmann–Royer operator.
Lemma 4. Given any θ ∈S′(R2) one ﬁnds
⟨φ, D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω)ψ⟩= πℏ[θ ∗Wφ,ψ](Ω)
(61)
for all φ, ψ ∈S(R) and all Ω ∈R2. If Πθ ∈B(L2(R)), then Eq. (61) even
holds for all φ, ψ ∈L2(R).
Proof. Sums in the argument of the displacement operator decompose as (see
Eq. (14) and [44, Eq. (1.10)]):
D(Ω−Ω′) = e−i
2ℏ(xp′−x′p)D(Ω)D(−Ω′).
This connects the r.h.s. of (61) with the Grossmann–Royer operator (16):
⟨φ, [T (Ω)D]†(Ω′)Π[T (Ω)D](Ω′)ψ⟩= ⟨φ, D(Ω−Ω′)ΠD†(Ω−Ω′)ψ⟩
= ⟨φ, D(Ω)D(−Ω′)ΠD†(−Ω′)D†(Ω)ψ⟩= ⟨D(−Ω)φ, 1
2Fσ[D(·)D(−Ω)ψ](Ω′)⟩
Together with linearity and continuity of θ, this implies
πℏ[θ ∗Wφ,ψ](Ω) = θ

In the second-to-last step, we used the general deﬁnition of Πθ from Remark
12. Now, if Πθ is bounded then the l.h.s. of (61) extends to all square-integrable
functions by density of S(R) in L2(R).

Thus, we have the (formal) equality ⟨φ, Πθψ⟩= πℏ[θ ∗Wφ,ψ](0, 0) for all
φ, ψ : R →C where this expression is well deﬁned. Using this, we are ready
to prove Lemma 2, in particular the equivalence of (i,a), (i,b) as well as the
equivalence of (ii,a), (ii,b), (ii,c) for general θ ∈S′(R2).
B.1 Proof of Lemma 2
Proof of Lemma 2. “(i,a) ⇒(i,b)”: Because Πθ is well deﬁned, ψ →[θ ∗
Wψ](0, 0) = (πℏ)−1⟨ψ|Πθψ⟩is well deﬁned on L2(R) as well. “(i,b) ⇒(i,a)”:
Assume that ψ →[θ ∗Wψ](0, 0) is well deﬁned on L2(R). Then, ⟨ψ|Πθψ⟩=
πℏ[θ ∗Wψ,ψ](0, 0) = πℏ[θ ∗Wψ](0, 0) exists for all ψ ∈L2(R) and the same is
true for ⟨ψ|Πθφ⟩using the parallelogram law
4⟨ψ|Πθφ⟩= ⟨ψ+φ|Πθ(ψ+φ)⟩−⟨ψ−φ|Πθ(ψ−φ)⟩
+i⟨ψ−iφ|Πθ(ψ−iφ)⟩−i⟨ψ+iφ|Πθ(ψ+iφ)⟩.
Hence, ˜φ →
 ˜φ(x)(Πθφ)(x) dx is a well-deﬁned linear functional on L2(R)
meaning—because it is a functional “of integral pairing form”—it is automat-
ically continuous as we prove now: If ⟨f, · ⟩: L2(R) →C, g →

f(x)g(x) dx
is well deﬁned for some f : R →C, then (ℜ(fg))±, (ℑ(fg))± are inte-
grable by deﬁnition of the Lebesgue integral, where f+(x) := max(f(x), 0)
and f−:= −min(f(x), 0). But these can be expanded into (ℜ(f))±(ℜ(g))±,
(ℜ(f))±(ℑ(g))±, (ℑ(f))±(ℜ(g))±, (ℑ(f))±(ℑ(g))± meaning the linear func-
tionals g →

(ℜ(f))±g and g →

(ℑ(f))±g are also well deﬁned on L2(R).
Now, each of these is a positive functional on L2(R) which is well known to be
continuous (one can prove this similar to [41, Ch. 2, Lemma 2.1]). Therefore,
⟨f, · ⟩is continuous as it is the linear combination of four continuous function-
als.
Then, the Riesz representation theorem (cf., e.g., [101, Supplementary
Material, Thm. S.4]) yields f ∈L2(R) such that f ∗(x) = (Πθφ)(x) for almost
all x ∈R; in particular, Πθφ ∈L2(R). But φ ∈L2(R) was chosen arbitrarily
meaning Πθ is a well-deﬁned linear operator on L2(R). The equivalence “(ii,a)
⇔(ii,b)” is obvious and “(ii,a) ⇔(ii,c)” follows at once from (61) together
with
sup
∥ψ∥,∥φ∥=1
|[θ ∗Wφ,ψ](0, 0)| =
sup
∥ψ∥,∥φ∥=1
|⟨φ|Πθψ⟩| = sup
∥φ∥=1
∥Πθφ∥L2 = ∥Πθ∥sup.
Now, assume that θ is admissible. Because “(ii,c) ⇒(i,a)” is trivial,
all that remains to show is “(i,a) ⇒(ii,c)”: Our idea is to show that θ being
admissible implies that Πθ can be written as the linear combination of two well-
deﬁned symmetric operators on L2(R). This would conclude the proof because
every symmetric operator is bounded by the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem [101,
p. 84]; hence, Πθ is bounded as well. Set Kθ∗(Ω) := K∗
θ (−Ω) and deﬁne Πθ∗
to be the parity operator generated by Kθ∗. First, we have to see whether

Πθ being well deﬁned on L2(R) implies that the same holds for Πθ∗. Given
ψ, φ ∈L2(R), we formally compute

Thus, ⟨ψ|Πθ∗φ⟩exists for all ψ, φ ∈L2(R) so by the same argument we used
above, Πθ∗is well deﬁned on L2(R). This yields the decomposition Πθ =
(Πθ+Πθ∗)/2+i·(Πθ−Πθ∗)/(2i), meaning all that is left to show is that Πθ+Πθ∗,
i(Πθ−Πθ∗) are symmetric operators; indeed, given ψ, φ ∈L2(R) one computes
⟨ψ|(Πθ+Πθ∗)φ⟩= ⟨ψ|Πθφ⟩+

and analogously for i(Πθ−Πθ∗). As stated above Πθ+Πθ∗, i(Πθ−Πθ∗)∈B(L2(R))
by the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem so Πθ ∈B(L2(R)) as well.

B.2 Proof of Theorem 1
Moreover, Lemma 4 enables a simple proof of Theorem 1:
Proof of Theorem 1. Using the spectral decomposition ρ = 	∞

C Phase-Space Distributions for Arbitrary Convolution Kernels
Given arbitrary θ ∈S′(R2), one can make sense of the phase-space distribution
function by restricting the domain of ρ →Fρ(Ω, θ) to quantum states ρ which,
e.g., have a ﬁnite representation in the number-state basis. Indeed, let ρ ∈

B. Koczor et al.
Ann. Henri Poincar´e
B1(L2(R)) be given such that ρ = 	N
m,n=1⟨m|ρn⟩|m⟩⟨n| for some N ∈N0.
Then, (27) becomes
Fρ(Ω, θ) =
N

m,n=0
(πℏ)−1⟨mρ|n⟩⟨D†(Ω)n|ΠθD†(Ω)m⟩,
(62)
which is a well-deﬁned expression regardless of the chosen θ ∈S′(R2), cf. the
paragraph right before Lemma 2 together with the simple fact that D is an
automorphism on S(R). To see that (62) generalizes Deﬁnition 4 note that if
Πθ ∈B(L2(R)), then limN→∞FρN (Ω, θ) = Fρ(Ω, θ) uniformly in Ω ∈R2 for
all states ρ, where ρN := 	N
m,n=1⟨m|ρn⟩|m⟩⟨n| is just the “upper left N × N
block” of ρ. One sees this using Prop. 16.6.6 from [97] as
|FρN (Ω, θ) −Fρ(Ω, θ)| ≤∥ρ −ρN∥1∥D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω)∥sup ≤∥ρ−ρN∥1∥Πθ∥sup →0.
Here we used that D(Ω) is unitary so it has operator norm one, together with
the fact that ∥ρ−ρN∥1 →0 as N →∞which is a simple consequence of
Prop. 2.1 in [122]. This motivates the general deﬁnition
F(Ω, θ) : DF →(R2 →C)
ρ →Fρ(Ω, θ) :=

m,n=0

In particular, Equation (62) shows that for all θ ∈S′(R2) the domain DF
is dense in the full trace class. However, unlike in the bounded case, it may
happen that Ω →Fρ(Ω, θ) is not a function of slow growth so F(Ω, θ) may not
map to the phase-space distributions.
D Proofs of the Properties from Sect. 4.2
D.1 Proof of Property 1
Recall that the Hilbert–Schmidt norm of an operator A is deﬁned as ∥A∥2
HS :=
Tr(A†A). One obtains

HS = Tr(Π†

∥Πθ∥2
HS = (8πℏ)−1

The inequality ∥Πθ∥sup ≤∥Πθ∥HS = ∥Kθ(Ω)∥L2/
√
8πℏ[101, Thm. VI.22.(d)]
concludes the proof.

D.2 Proof of Property 2
Recall that the Wigner function is square integrable as Tr(ρ†
1 ρ2) =

W ∗
ρ1
Wρ2 dΩ and |⟨Wρ1|Wρ2⟩| ≤1 hold. Similarly, one obtains for elements Fρ(Ω, θ) =


F ∗
ρ1(Ω, θ) Fρ2(Ω, θ) dΩ =

[θ(Ω) ∗Wρ1(Ω)]∗[θ(Ω) ∗Wρ2(Ω)] dΩ
=

Fσ[θ(·) ∗Wρ1(·)]∗(Ω) Fσ[θ(·) ∗Wρ2(·)](Ω) dΩ
using the Plancherel formula

a(Ω)b∗(Ω) dΩ =

aσ(Ω)b∗
σ(Ω) dΩ. One can
simplify the integrands to
Fσ[θ(·) ∗Wρ2(·)](Ω) = 2πℏFσ[θ(·)](Ω) Fσ[Wρ2(·)](Ω)
by applying the convolution formula from (18). Theorem 1 implies Kθ(Ω) =
2πℏ[Fσθ(·)](−Ω) which yields the simpliﬁed integral

F ∗
ρ1(Ω, θ) Fρ2(Ω, θ) dΩ =

|Kθ(−Ω)|2 Fσ[Wρ1(·)]∗(Ω) Fσ[Wρ2(·)](Ω) dΩ.
(63)
By assumption, Kθ(Ω) ∈L∞(R2), i.e., there exists a constant C ∈R such that
|Kθ(Ω)| ≤C holds almost everywhere. Applying this bound to Eq. (63) after
setting ρ1 = ρ2 =: ρ yield

|Kθ(−Ω)|2 |Fσ[Wρ(·)](Ω)|2 dΩ ≤C2

|Fσ[Wρ(·)](Ω)|2 dΩ = C2

|Wρ(Ω) |2 dΩ
with the help of the Plancherel formula. The above-mentioned result for the
Wigner function implies the square integrability of Fρ(Ω, θ), which concludes
the proof.
D.3 Proof of Property 3
As in (8), one considers the density operators ρ = 	
n pn|ψn⟩⟨ψn| and ρ′ =
	
n pn|φn⟩⟨φn|. The orthonormality of |φn⟩= D(Ω′)|ψn⟩is used to evaluate
the trace and this yields

Computing the addition of products D(Ω)D(Ω′) of displacement operators [44,

concludes
the
proof
by
using
D†(Ω′)
=
D(−Ω′)
and
Tr [ ρ′ D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω)] = Tr [ ρ D(Ω−Ω′)ΠθD†(Ω−Ω′)].
D.4 Proof of Property 4
First, we prove that the displacement operator is covariant under rotations,
i.e., U †
φD(Ω)Uφ = D(Ω−φ). This is conveniently shown in the coherent-state
representation as detailed in Eq. (9). Note that

where the eigenvalue equation U †
φ|n⟩= exp (inφ)|n⟩was used together with
its special case Uφ|0⟩= |0⟩. It follows from (22) that
UφΠθU †
φ = (4πℏ)−1

Kθ(Ω)UφD(Ω)U †
φ dΩ = (4πℏ)−1

Kθ(Ω)D(Ωφ) dΩ = Πθ
and the last equation is a consequence of the invariance Kθ(Ω) = Kθ(Ωφ).
Now, considering the density operators ρ and ρφ = UφρU †
φ, the traces can be
evaluated as
Tr[ρφD(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω)] = Tr[ρφD(Ω)UφΠθU †
φD†(Ω)] = Tr[UφρU †
φD(Ω)UφΠθU †
φD†(Ω)]
= Tr[ρU †
φD(Ω)UφΠθ (U †
φD(Ω)Uφ)†] = Tr[ρD(Ω−φ)ΠθD†(Ω−φ)],
which veriﬁes that the displacement operator is covariant under rotations.
The diagonality of Πθ in the Fock basis can be shown as follows: If Kθ(Ω) is
invariant under rotations it must be a function of the polar radius in the phase
space, i.e., Kθ(Ω) = Kθ(|α|2). The matrix elements can be calculated via (10)
as
⟨n|Πθ m⟩= (4πℏ)−1

Kθ(|α|2) [D(α)]nm dΩ ∝

αm−nf(|α|2) dΩ ∝δnm
with f(|α|2) = Kθ(|α|2)e−|α|2/2L(m−n)

(|α|2), so the integral vanishes unless
n = m.
D.5 Proof of Property 5
The expectation value ⟨ψn|D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω) ψn⟩= ⟨φn|Πθ φn⟩is real if Πθ is self-
adjoint, where the orthonormal bases {|ψn⟩}n=0,1,... and {|φn⟩}n=0,1,... of the
considered Hilbert space have been applied. Assuming K∗


D(Ω)ΠθD†(Ω) dΩ]
= 2 Tr{ ρ Fσ[D(·)ΠθD†(·)](Ω)|Ω=0} = Tr [ ρ D(0)Kθ(0)] = Kθ(0)Tr(ρ)
is mapped to the trace of ρ if Kθ(0) = 1. The second equality applies the
symplectic Fourier transform of Eq. (29) at the point Ω = 0. Formally, the

trace of Πθ is given by
Tr[Πθ] = (4πℏ)−1

Kθ(Ω)Tr[D(Ω)] dΩ = (2)−1

Kθ(Ω)δ(Ω) dΩ,
where we used Tr[D†(Ω)D(Ω′)] = 2πℏδ(Ω−Ω′) [23]. Alternatively, this also
follows from (37) by formally computing the trace
Tr[Πθ] = (πℏ)−1Tr[OpWeyl(θ)] = (πℏ)−2

θ(Ω) Tr[D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω)] dΩ,
where the trace of the Grossmann–Royer operator from (16) evaluates to
Tr[D(Ω)ΠD†(Ω)] = Tr[Π] = 1/2, refer to (6.38) and the following text in
[23]. Substituting its deﬁnition from (22), the trace of Πθ is computed as
Tr[Πθ] = (2π2ℏ2)−1 
θ(Ω) dΩ = (πℏ)−1Fσ[θ(·)]|Ω=0 = K(0)/2.
E Proof of (40)
Due to Property 4, the parity operator is diagonal in the number-state repre-
sentation ⟨m|Πs|n⟩∝δnm. Its diagonal elements can be calculated


es|α|2/2 e−|α|2/2Ln(|α|2) dΩ
where (10) was used for [D(Ω)]nn. One applies the polar parametrization of
the complex plane via Ω = α = r exp (iφ) so that dΩ = 2ℏdℜ(α) dℑ(α) =
2ℏr dr dφ. Then,

and the integral in (64) vanishes for odd powers of x and p due to symmetry of
the integrand. Therefore, all non-vanishing matrix elements have even m −n
values and the summations can be restricted to ℓ∈{0, 2, 4, . . . , m−n}. The
integral is also invariant under a permutation of x and p and certain terms
in the sum cancel each other out: Every term xm−n−ℓ(ip)ℓin the sum has
a counterpart (ip)m−n−ℓxℓwhich results in the same integral and these two
terms therefore cancel each other out after the integration if the condition
(i)ℓ= −(i)m−n−ℓholds (which occurs unless m−n is a multiple of four). This
elementary argument shows that only matrix elements [ΠBJ]mn with m −n

scheme with m ≥n on account of the Laguerre polynomials in (10), but
matrix elements with m < n are trivially obtained as [ΠBJ]mn = [ΠBJ]nm.

f : (0, ∞) × (0, ∞) →R, (λ, μ) →arcsinh[1/

can be computed recursively. Note that, obviously, f is smooth. The inner
derivative of Φk
ab gives rise to the following lemma.
Lemma 5. Let any a, b ∈N0 := {0, 1, . . .} with a+b ≥1 (else we are not taking
any derivative). Then,

and have the symmetry cab

j .
Proof. Note that the symmetry of the cab
j
holds due to Schwarz’s theorem
[105, pp. 235–236] as f is smooth. Then, this statement is readily veriﬁed
via induction over n = a + b. First, n = 1 corresponds to a = 1, b = 0 so
∂μarcsinh[(λμ)−1/2] = 1/(−2μ√λμ+1) which reproduces (66). For n →n + 1
it is enough to consider (a, b) →(a+1, b) due to the stated symmetry. The key
result here is that
∂μ

(√λμ+1)2(a+b)−1 =
μj−a−1

which is readily veriﬁed. Straightforward calculations conclude the proof.

Now, the cab

for

now.

(69)
for any β, j ∈N which can be easily seen. We have to distinguish the cases
a + b = 0 and a + b ≥1. First, let a + b = 0 so a = 0, b = 0 and the expression
in question boils down to
∂k
μf(μ, μ) = ∂k
μarcsinh[μ−1] =
	k−1

j
μ2j−k

as can be shown via induction over k ∈N. Here, setting β = k in (69) yields

j
= ξ00k
j−1(2j −1 −3k) + ξ00k
j
(2j−k)
which recovers the recursion formula of ξabk
j
for a = 0 and b = 0. Now, assume
a+b ≥1 such that we can carry out the proof via induction over k ∈N0 (where
k = 0 is obvious as it is simply Lemma 5). Using (69) in the inductive step
for β = a + b + k recovers the recursion formula of the ξabk
j
by straightforward
computations.

Finally, evaluating (67) at μ = 1 for any a, b, k ∈N0 with a + b + k ≥1
readily implies Eq. (53).
I Proof of Proposition 3
The proof which is given below was informed by a discussion on MathOver-
ﬂow [117], and its idea was provided GH and M. Alekseyev. We consider the
generating function of the entries [ΠBJ]nn.

[2, 3.6.6] to φ(w) = 1 + w [so w/φ(w) = t for |t| < 1 has the unique solution

J Direct Recursive Calculation of the Matrix Elements
The nonzero matrix elements are deﬁned by a set of rational numbers
Mkℓ:= [ΠBJ]k+4ℓ,k/(Γkℓ) −δℓ0arcsinh(1)/
√
2,
(73)
where the indexing k, ℓ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . } is now relative to the diagonal (where
ℓ= 0) and Γkℓ:= γk+4ℓ,k = 2−4ℓ+1/2
k!/(k+4ℓ)!. Here, δnm is the Kronecker
delta and note the symmetry [ΠBJ]k,k+4ℓ= [ΠBJ]k+4ℓ,k. For example, the
values Mk0 deﬁne the diagonal of the Born–Jordan parity operator [ΠBJ]kk
up to the constants Γk0 =
√
2 and arcsinh(1)/
√
2, compare to Fig. 1. These
rational numbers appear to satisfy the following recursive relations
Mk+4,ℓ=
1
k+4Mk+3,ℓ+
4ℓ+2k+5
(k+3)(k+4)Mk+2,ℓ+
4ℓ+k+2
(k+3)(k+4)Mk+1,ℓ+ (4ℓ+k+1)(4ℓ+k+2)
(k+3)(k+4)
Mkℓ,
i.e., each element in a column is determined by the previous four values. Calcu-
lating a column requires, however, the ﬁrst four elements M0ℓ, M1ℓ, M2ℓ, M3ℓ
as initial conditions. Surprisingly, the ﬁrst four rows appear to satisfy the
following recursive relations
M0,ℓ+2 = 4[(27 + 56ℓ+ 32ℓ2)M0,ℓ+1 −16ℓ(1+4ℓ)(2+4ℓ)(3+4ℓ)M0ℓ]
M1,ℓ+2 = 4[(39 + 72ℓ+ 32ℓ2)M1,ℓ+1 −16ℓ(2+4ℓ)(3+4ℓ)(5+4ℓ)M1ℓ]
M2,ℓ+2 = 4[(55 + 88ℓ+ 32ℓ2)M2,ℓ+1 −16ℓ(3+4ℓ)(5+4ℓ)(6+4ℓ)M2ℓ]
M3,ℓ+2 = 4[(75 + 104ℓ+ 32ℓ2)M3,ℓ+1 −16ℓ(5+4ℓ)(6+4ℓ)(7+4ℓ)M3ℓ].
Ultimately, eight initial values M0,0 = 0, M0,1 = 4, M1,0 = −1, M1,1 = −8,
M2,0 = −1/2, M2,1 = 6, M3,0 = −2/3, and M3,1 = −4 appear to determine the
Born–Jordan parity operator via the above recursion relations for the elements
Mkℓ.
