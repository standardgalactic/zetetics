The Articulate Mammal
An established bestseller, The Articulate Mammal is a concise and highly
readable introduction to the main topics in psycholinguistics. This ﬁfth
edition brings the book up to date with recent theories, including
new material on:
•
The possibility of a ‘language gene’
•
Post-Chomskyan ideas
•
Language within an evolutionary framework
•
Spatial cognition and how this affects language
•
How children become acclimatized to speech rhythms before
birth
•
The acquisition of verbs
•
Construction and cognitive grammar
•
Aphasia and dementia.
Requiring no prior knowledge of the subject, chapter by chapter, The
Articulate Mammal tackles the basic questions central to the study of
psycholinguistics. Jean Aitchison investigates these issues with regard
to animal communication, child language and the language of adults,
and includes in the text full references and helpful suggestions for
further reading.
Jean Aitchison was Professor of Language and Communication at
the University of Oxford from 1993 to 2003, and is now an Emeritus
Professorial Fellow at Worcester College, Oxford. She is the author
of numerous books on Language and gave the 1996 BBC Reith
Lectures on the topic of ‘The Language Web’.

Preface to the ﬁrst edition
Some years ago, I gave an evening course entitled ‘Psycholinguistics’.
I was quite amazed at the response. A large, eager and intelligent group
of people arrived, many of them with a serious reason for wanting to
know about the subject. There were speech therapists, infant school
teachers, an advertising executive, a librarian, an educational psycholo-
gist – to name just a few of those whose jobs I noted. There were
also parents interested in understanding how children acquire language,
and one student who wanted to know how she might help a relative
who had lost her language as a result of a stroke. In addition, there
were a number of men and women who said they ‘just wanted to
ﬁnd out more about language’.
The Articulate Mammal was written for the members of that class,
and for others like them: people like me who would like to know
why we talk, how we acquire language, and what happens when we
produce or comprehend sentences. The book is also intended for
students at universities, polytechnics and colleges of education who
need an introduction to the subject. It cannot, of course, provide all
the answers. But I have tried to set out clearly and brieﬂy what seem
to me to have been the major topics of interest in psycholinguistics
in recent years, together with an assessment of the ‘state of play’ in
the ﬁeld at the moment. I hope it will be useful.
I am extremely grateful to a number of scholars who made helpful
comments on the manuscript. In particular, and in alphabetical order,
Michael Banks of the London School of Economics, David Bennett
of the School of Oriental and African Studies, Paul Fletcher of Reading
University, Jerry Fodor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Phil Johnson-Laird of the University of Sussex, Geoffrey Sampson of
Lancaster University, and Deirdre Wilson of University College, London.
The book would probably have been better if I had taken more
notice of their comments – but as the suggested improvements were

often contradictory, it was difﬁcult to decide whose opinion to accept.
In cases of doubt, I preferred my own, so I am wholly responsible
for any errors or over-simpliﬁcations that the text may still contain.
My thanks also go to Irene Fekete, the evening-course student (and
Hutchinson’s executive) who persuaded me to write this book.
Let me add a brief note on style. In English, the so-called ‘unmarked’
or ‘neutral between sexes’ pronoun is he. Had I used this all the way
through The Articulate Mammal, it might have given the misleading
impression that only male mammals are articulate. I have therefore
tried to use an equal number of he’s and she’s in passages where a
‘neutral between sexes’ pronoun is required.

Preface to the ﬁrst edition

Preface to the ﬁfth edition
In the thirty plus years since this book was first published, psy-
cholinguistics has increased considerably, both in popularity and in the
amount written about it. It has expanded like a young cuckoo, and
is in danger of pushing some more traditional interests out of the nest.
Or, to take another metaphor, it has behaved like an active volcano,
belching out an increasing lava-ﬂow of important ﬁndings which have
poured out over almost all areas of linguistics and psychology, and
have – to some extent – changed the shape of the landscape.
Luckily, many of the questions asked remain the same, though
many more answers have been proposed. It is clearly impossible to
include all the new developments in this revised edition. I have, how-
ever, attempted to outline those which seem most relevant to the
issues discussed in this book. No chapter remains unaltered, and some
have undergone substantial additions and/or changes. For example,
human ‘mind-reading’, the ability to understand the intentions of
others, is turning out to be a key property underlying language
(Chapters 2–3). Huge steps forward have been taken in understanding
the brain, largely due to the increased sophistication of modern brain
scans (Chapter 3). Chomsky’s ideas are still recognized as playing a
foundational role in modern psycholinguistics, but are these days being
pushed out of the limelight by the work of a younger generation of
scholars (Chapter 5). Verbs have continued to take centre stage in
children’s acquisition of language (Chapter 7) and in speech compre-
hension (Chapter 10). And so on, and so on. In addition, numerous
new references have been added. I hope this new edition will enable
readers to keep up with what is happening in the ﬁeld at the moment.
As before, I am grateful for the skill and help of those at Routledge,
especially (for this edition) Nadia Seemungal.

Introduction
Psycholinguistics is sometimes deﬁned as the study of language and
the mind. As the name suggests, it is a subject which links psychology
and linguistics. The common aim of all who call themselves psycholin-
guists is to ﬁnd out about the structures and processes which underlie
a human’s ability to speak and understand language.
Both psychologists and linguists are involved in studying psycholin-
guistics. As one group of researchers has noted:
The name says it all . . . it is simultaneously psychology and
linguistics. At the heart of the discipline, therefore, is the relation-
ship between these two ﬁelds, each of which can boast centuries
of research tradition . . . By contrast, psycholinguistics itself is
relatively young . . . psycholinguistics as we understand it today
and as a discipline with its own name has only been in existence
since the mid-twentieth century.
(Cutler et al. 2005: 1)
(A complete list of references quoted in the text is contained in the
References on pp. 269–92.)
Both psychologists and linguists can be classiﬁed as social scientists,
so in one way their approach has long been similar. All social scientists
work by forming and testing hypotheses. For example, a psycholinguist
might hypothesize that the speech of someone who is suffering from a
progressive disease of the nervous system will disintegrate in a certain
order, perhaps suggesting that the constructions the patient learned most
recently will be the ﬁrst to disappear. This hypothesis will then be tested
against data collected from the speech of someone who is brain-damaged.
This is where psychologists and linguists sometimes differ. Psychologists
test their hypotheses mainly by means of carefully controlled experiments.
Linguists, on the other hand, test their hypotheses mainly by checking

them against spontaneous utterances. They feel that the rigidity of
experimental situations sometimes falsiﬁes the results. Neither way is right
or wrong. Provided that each side is sympathetic to and interested in
the work of the other, it can be a great advantage to have two approaches
to the subject. And when the results of linguists and psychologists coincide,
this is a sure sign of progress.
Most introductory books published so far have been written by
psychologists. A few have even argued that the name ‘psycholinguistics’
should be restricted to psychological experiments on language. This
book is an attempt to provide an introduction to the subject from the
linguist’s point of view – although inevitably and rightly, it includes
accounts of work done by psychologists. It also covers some of the
work done by both linguists and psychologists under the broad umbrella
label ‘language and mind’, or (more recently) ‘cognitive linguistics’.
This book does not presuppose any knowledge of linguistics – though
for those who become interested in the subject, a number of elementary
books are suggested on pp. 263–8
Psycholinguistics is in many ways like the proverbial hydra – a
monster with an endless number of heads: there seems no limit to the
aspects of the subject which could be explored. This is a rather unsatis-
factory state of affairs. As one researcher expressed it: ‘When faced with
the inevitable question, “What do psycholinguists do?” it is somehow
quite unsatisfactory to have to reply, “Everything”’ (Maclay 1973: 574).
Or, as another psychologist put it: 
Trying to write a coherent view of psycholinguistics is a bit like
trying to assemble a face out of a police identikit. You can’t use
all of the pieces, and no matter which ones you choose it doesn’t
look quite right.
(Tanenhaus 1988: 1)
In this situation, it is necessary to specialize fairly rigidly. And amidst
the vast array of possible topics, three seem to be of particular interest:
1
The acquisition problem Do humans acquire language because they
are born equipped with some special linguistic ability? Or are they
able to learn language because they are highly intelligent animals
who are skilled at solving problems of various types? Or could it
be a mixture of these two possibilities?
2
The link between language knowledge and language usage Linguists 
often claim to be describing a person’s representation of language
(language knowledge), rather than how that knowledge is actually

used. How then does usage link up with knowledge? If we put
this another way, we can say that anybody who has learned a
language can do three things:
1
Understand sentences.
LANGUAGE
2
Produce sentences.
USAGE
3
Store linguistic knowledge.
LANGUAGE
KNOWLEDGE
Many pure linguists claim to be interested in (3) rather than (1)
or (2). What psycholinguists need to know is this: do the types
of grammar proposed by linguists really reﬂect a person’s inter-
nalized knowledge of their language? And how do people make
use of that knowledge in everyday speech?
3
Producing and comprehending speech What actually happens when a
person produces or comprehends a chunk of speech?
These are the three questions which this book examines. It does
so by considering four types of evidence:
1
animal communication;
2
child language;
3
the language of normal adults;
4
the speech of aphasics (people with speech disturbances).
As the diagram below shows, these are not watertight compartments.
Each type of evidence is connected to the next by an intermediate
link. Animal communication is linked to child language by the ‘talking
chimps’ – apes who have been taught a language-like system. The link
between child and adult language is seen in the speech of 8- to-14-
year-olds. The language of normal adults is linked to those with speech
disturbances by ‘speech errors’, which occur in the speech of all normal
people, yet show certain similarities with the speech of aphasics.

Introduction
3

Before moving on to the ﬁrst topic, the acquisition problem and
the question of linguistic knowledge, we must make a few comments
about the use of the word grammar.
We assume that, in order to speak, every person who knows a
language has the grammar of that language internalized in their head.
The linguist who writes a grammar is making a hypothesis about this
internalized system, and is in effect saying, ‘My guess as to the know-
ledge stored in the head of someone who knows a language is as
follows . . . .’ For this reason, the word grammar is used interchangeably
to mean both the internal representation of language within a person’s
head, and a linguist’s ‘model’ or guess of that representation.
Furthermore, when we talk about a person’s internalized grammar
the word grammar is being used in a much wider sense than that found
in some old textbooks. It refers to a person’s total knowledge of their
language. That is, it includes not just a knowledge of syntax (word
patterns) but also phonology (sound patterns), semantics (meaning patterns),
as well as the lexicon (the mental dictionary) which ties everything
together.

Introduction

Increasingly, linguists are finding that syntax and semantics are
intrinsically linked together, and cannot easily be separated. It is far
easier to split off phonology. Syntax and semantics together form the
essence of any language. They, alongside the lexicon, will therefore
be the basic concern of this book. Phonology will mostly be omitted,
and only referred to where it illuminates syntactic and semantic
problems.
Perhaps here we need to mention also a vast and woolly subject
which is not the concern of this book – the relationship of language
to thought. Although it is clear that thought is possible without langu-
age, it seems that people normally think in terms of their language. That 
is, a person’s thoughts are ‘pre-packaged’ into words and grammatical
categories. This means that when we are discussing production and
comprehension, we shall not spend time discussing an abstract layer of
‘concepts’ which some people have assumed to exist at a level ‘above’
language. When discussing, say, producing speech, we shall take it for
granted that the ﬁrst thing a person tells herself to do is, ‘Select the
relevant words and syntax’ rather than ‘Package together concepts and
see if they can be translated into language’. In other words, if it is
necessary to take sides in the controversy as to which came ﬁrst, language
or thought, we are more on the side of the nineteenth-century poet
Shelley, who said ‘He gave men speech, and speech created thought’
than that of the eighteenth-century lexicographer Samuel Johnson,
who claimed that ‘Language is the dress of thought.’ Consequently,
the vast and fascinating area known as ‘cognitive linguistics’, which
links language with thought, will only intermittently be mentioned –
though reading suggestions will be added in the Suggestions for Further
Reading on pp. 263–8.
Another voluminous topic which is not discussed in this book is
that of ‘communicative competence’. In recent years, a number of
psychologists have made the rather obvious point that children do not
merely acquire the structural patterns of their language, they also learn
to use them appropriately within various social settings. Therefore, it
is argued, psycholinguists should pay as much attention to social context
as to language structure itself, particularly as children in the early stages
of speech are heavily dependent on their surroundings. This work is
interesting and important, and most people nowadays agree whole-
heartedly that it is useless to consider child utterances in a vacuum.
However, humans, if they so wish, are able to rely on structure alone
when they communicate. They often manage to comprehend and
produce quite unexpected and inappropriate utterances. In fact, it
might even be claimed that the ultimate goal of language acquisition

is to lie effectively, since ‘real lying . . . is the deliberate use of language
as a tool . . . with the content of the message unsupported by context
to mislead the listener’ (De Villiers and De Villiers 1978: 165). This
book, therefore, takes more interest in the steps by which this mastery
of structure is attained, than in the ways in which utterances ﬁt into
the surrounding context.
Finally, I have tried not to repeat material from other books I have
written, though occasional references and outline notes are inevitable,
particularly from Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental
Lexicon and The Seeds of Speech: Language Origin and Evolution.

He reached up and pulled a switch on the panel. Immediately the room

Roald Dahl, The Great Automatic Grammatizator 
Every normal human being can talk. So the average person tends to
think that there is little or nothing mysterious about language. As the
linguist Noam Chomsky has pointed out:
We lose sight of the need for explanation when phenomena are
too familiar and ‘obvious’. We tend too easily to assume that
explanations must be transparent and close to the surface . . . As
native speakers, we have a vast amount of data available to us.
For just this reason it is easy to fall into the trap of believing that
there is nothing to be explained. Nothing could be further from
the truth . . . 
(Chomsky 1972a: 25–6)
But the mysterious nature of human language becomes more apparent
when one realizes that no one has yet managed to simulate the language

ability of a human being. Computers can play chess, sort bank state-
ments, and even talk about limited topics such as cubes, squares and
cones. But we are far from producing a ‘great automatic grammatizator’
which could unaided hold conversations on any topic. Why is this?
Perhaps we should think about language more carefully.
Nature or nurture?
When people start thinking about language, the ﬁrst question which
often occurs to them is this: is language natural to humans? – in the
same way that grunting is natural to pigs, and barking comes naturally
to dogs. Or is it just something we happen to have learned? – in the
same way that dogs may learn to beg, or elephants may learn to waltz,
or humans may learn to play the guitar.
Clearly, in one sense, children ‘learn’ whatever language they are
exposed to, be it Chinese, Nootka or English. So no one would deny
that ‘learning’ is very important. But the crucial question is whether
children are born with ‘blank sheets’ in their head as far as language
is concerned – or whether humans are ‘programmed’ with an outline
knowledge of the structure of languages in general.
This question of whether language is partly due to nature or wholly
due to learning or nurture is often referred to as the nature–nurture
controversy, and has been discussed for centuries. For example, it was
the topic of one of Plato’s dialogues, the Cratylus. Controversies which
have been going on for literally ages tend to behave in a characteristic
fashion. They lie dormant for a while, then break out ﬁercely. This
particular issue resurfaced in linguistics in 1959 when the linguist Noam
Chomsky wrote a devastating and witty review of Verbal Behavior, 
a book by the Harvard psychologist B.F. Skinner (Skinner 1957;
Chomsky 1959). This book claimed to ‘explain’ language as a set of
habits gradually built up over the years. According to Skinner, no
complicated innate or mental mechanisms are needed. All that is
necessary is the systematic observation of the events in the external
world which prompt the speaker to utter sounds.
Skinner’s claim to understand language was based on his work with
rats and pigeons. He had proved that, given time, rats and pigeons
could be trained to perform an amazing variety of seemingly complex
tasks, provided two basic principles were followed. First, the tasks
must be broken down into a number of carefully graduated steps.
Second, the animals must be repeatedly rewarded.
In a typical experiment, a rat was put in a box containing a bar. If
it pressed the bar, it was rewarded with a pellet of food. Nothing

forced it to press the bar. The ﬁrst time it possibly did so accidentally.
When the rat found that food arrived, it pressed the bar again.
Eventually it learned that if it was hungry, it could obtain food by
pressing the bar. Then the task was made more difﬁcult. The rat only
got rewarded if it pressed the bar while a light was ﬂashing. At ﬁrst
the rat was puzzled. Eventually it learned the trick. Then the task was
made more difﬁcult again. This time the rat only received food if it
pressed the bar a certain number of times. After initial confusion, it
learned to do this also. And so on, and so on.
This type of ‘trial-and-error’ learning was called operant conditioning
by Skinner, which can be translated as ‘training by means of voluntary
responses’ (the word ‘operant’ means a voluntary response rather than
an automatic one). Skinner suggested that it is by means of this mechan-
ism that the vast majority of human learning takes place, including
language learning:
The basic processes and relations which give verbal behaviour its
special characteristics are now fairly well understood. Much of the
experimental work responsible for this advance has been carried
out on other species, but the results have proved to be surprisingly
free of species restrictions. Recent work has shown that the methods
can be extended to human behaviour without serious modiﬁcation.
(Skinner 1957: 3)
All one needed to do in order to understand language, he said, was
to identify the ‘controlling variables’, which would enable us to predict
speciﬁc utterances. For example, in the same way as it was possible
to say that a rat’s bar-pressing behaviour was partly ‘under the control’
of a ﬂashing light, so a feeling of hunger might ‘control’ or predict a
human utterance such as ‘Please pass the bread and butter.’ Or the
presence of a beautiful painting might call forth the exclamation, ‘Oh
how beautiful.’ Or a bad smell might cause one to exclaim ‘Oh what
a terrible smell.’ A French notice, such as ‘Ne touchez pas’, might result
in one saying, ‘That means “Don’t touch”.’ And if a child said ‘Hickory
dickory dock’, you are likely to continue ‘The mouse ran up the
clock.’ In theory, Skinner saw no difﬁculty in linking up any particular
set of words which a human might wish to produce with an identiﬁable
external happening.
In practice, the matter is far from simple, as Chomsky pointed out.
Chomsky made two major criticisms of Skinner’s work. First, the
behaviour of rats in boxes is irrelevant to human language. Second,
Skinner fundamentally misunderstood the nature of language.

The irrelevance of rats
Chomsky pointed out that the simple and well-deﬁned sequence of
events observed in the boxes of rats is just not applicable to language.
And the terminology used in the rat experiments cannot be re-applied
to human language without becoming hopelessly vague.
For example, how do you know that someone is likely to say ‘Oh
what a beautiful picture’ when looking at a beautiful painting? They
might say instead, ‘It clashes with the wallpaper’, ‘It’s hanging too low’,
‘It’s hideous.’ Skinner would say that instead of the utterance being
‘controlled’ by the beauty of the picture, it was ‘controlled’ by its clash
with the wallpaper, its hanging too low, its hideousness. But this reduces
the idea of ‘control’ to being meaningless, because you have to wait
until you hear the utterance before you know what controlled it. This
is quite unlike the predictable behaviour of rats which could be relied
upon to respond to certain stimuli such as a ﬂashing light with a ﬁxed
response.
Another problem was that the rats were repeatedly rewarded. It is
quite clear that children do not receive pellets of food when they
make a correct utterance. However, the idea of reward or reinforcement
(since it reinforces the behaviour that is being learned) can in humans
be naturally extended to approval or disapproval. One might suppose
that a parent smiles and says ‘Yes dear, that’s right’ when a child makes
a correct utterance. Even if this were so, what happens to this idea
of approval when there is nobody around, since children are frequently
observed to talk to themselves? Skinner suggested that in these cases
children automatically ‘reinforce’ themselves because they know they
are producing sounds which they have heard in the speech of others.
Similarly, Skinner assumed that someone like a poet who is uttering
words aloud in an empty room will be ‘reinforced’ by the knowledge
that others will be inﬂuenced by the poetry in the future. So rein-
forcement seems a very woolly notion, since an actual reward need
not exist, it need only be imagined or hoped for. Such a notion is
certainly not comparable to the food pellets given to rats when they
make a correct response.
Studies by Roger Brown and his associates provided even more
problems for Skinner’s notion of reinforcement. After observing
mother–child interactions they pointed out that parents tend to approve
statements which are true rather than those which are grammatically
correct. So a boy who said ‘Teddy sock on’ and showed his mother
a teddy bear wearing a sock would probably meet with approval. But
if the child said the grammatically correct utterance ‘Look, Teddy is

wearing a sock’, and showed his mother a bear without a sock, he
would meet with disapproval. In other words, if approval and disap-
proval worked in the way Skinner suggested, you would expect children
to grow up telling the truth, but speaking ungrammatically. In fact
the opposite seems to happen (Brown et al. 1968).
Another example of a problem which crops up in trying to match
rat and human behaviour is that of deﬁning the notion of response
strength. When a rat has learned to respond to a particular external
happening, the extent to which it has learned the lesson can be measured
in terms of the speed, force and frequency of the bar-pressing. Skinner
suggested that similar measures of response strength might be found
in some human responses. For example, a person who was shown a
prized work of art might, much to the gratiﬁcation of the owner,
instantly exclaim ‘Beautiful!’ in a loud voice. Chomsky pointed out:
It does not appear totally obvious that in this case the way to
impress the owner is to shriek ‘Beautiful’ in a loud, high-pitched
voice, repeatedly, and with no delay (high response strength). It
may be equally effective to look at the picture silently (long delay),
and then to murmur ‘Beautiful’ in a soft low-pitched voice (by
deﬁnition, very low response strength).
(Chomsky 1959: 35)
Chomsky used these and similar arguments to show the irrelevance
of Skinner’s experiments to the problem of understanding language.
Perhaps ‘irrelevance’ is too strong a word, since there are areas of
language where habit forming works. For example, some people
invariably say ‘Damn’ if they drop a raw egg, or ‘Good night’ when
they are going to bed, or ‘London transport gets worse every day’
when standing at a bus-stop. And there is one sad character in a Beatles’
song who only ever says ‘Good morning’:
I’ve got nothing to say but it’s OK
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
But apart from trivial exceptions such as these, language is inﬁnitely
more complex and less predictable than Skinner’s theory would suggest.
Of course, just because Skinner’s ideas were over-simple does not
automatically mean that Chomksy’s ideas were right. Maybe both
Skinner’s and Chomsky’s views are outdated. Now, in the twenty-
ﬁrst century, we know a lot more about language and its special
qualities, partly because Chomsky in particular inspired so many to

take language seriously as a key to understanding the human mind,
and to work on it further.
The nature of language
What is there about language that makes it so special? There are a
large number of human activities such as learning to drive or learning
to knit which seem to be learnt in the same way as bar pressing by
rats. Why not language also?
Chomsky pointed out some of the special properties of language
in his review of Skinner’s book, where he suggested that Skinner was
not in a position to talk about the causation of verbal behaviour, since
he knew little about the character of such behaviour:
There is little point in speculating about the process of acquisition
without a much better understanding of what is acquired.
(Chomsky 1959: 55)
Chomsky has since discussed the nature of language in a number
of places (e.g. Chomsky 1972a, 1986, 1995b 2000, 2002). One point
which he stressed is that language makes use of structure-dependent
operations. By this he means that the composition and production of
utterances is not merely a question of stringing together sequences of
words. Every sentence has an inaudible internal structure which must
be understood by the hearer.
In order to see more clearly what is meant by a structure-dependent
operation, it is useful to look at structure-independent operations.
Suppose a Martian had landed on earth, and was trying to learn
English. She might hear the sentence:
AUNT JEMIMA HAS DROPPED HER FALSE TEETH DOWN THE DRAIN
as well as the related question:
HAS AUNT JEMIMA DROPPED HER FALSE TEETH DOWN THE DRAIN?
If she was an intelligent Martian, she would immediately start trying
to guess the rules for the formation of questions in English. Her ﬁrst
guess might be that English has a rule which says, ‘In order to form
a question, scan the sentence for the word has and bring it to the
front.’ Superﬁcially, this strategy might occasionally work. For example,
a sentence such as:

PETRONELLA HAS HURT HERSELF
would quite correctly become:
HAS PETRONELLA HURT HERSELF?
But it is clearly a wrong strategy, because it would also mean that the
Martian would turn a statement such as:
THE MAN WHO HAS RUN AWAY SHOUTING WAS ATTACKED BY A
WASP
Into:
*HAS THE MAN WHO RUN AWAY SHOUTING WAS ATTACKED BY A
WASP?
which is not English. (An asterisk denotes an impossible sentence.)
Looking at the Aunt Jemima sentence again, the Martian might
make a second guess, ‘In order to form a question, bring the third
word to the front.’ Once again, this might superﬁcially appear to work
because a sentence such as:
THE ALLIGATOR HAS ESCAPED
would correctly become:
HAS THE ALLIGATOR ESCAPED?
But it is obviously accidental that this type of rule gets the right result,
because it also produces a number of non-sentences:
SLUGS ARE SLIMY
would become:
*SLIMY SLUGS ARE?
And:
MARY HAS SWALLOWED A SAFETY PIN
turns into:
*SWALLOWED MARY HAS A SAFETY PIN?

The Martian went wrong in her guesses because she was trying out
structure-independent operations – manoeuvres which relied solely 
on mechanical counting or simple recognition procedures without
looking at the internal structure of the sentences concerned. In order
to grasp the principles of question formation, the Martian must ﬁrst
realize that:
AUNT JEMIMA, THE MAN WHO HAS RUN AWAY SHOUTING, SLUGS,
MARY
each behaves as a unit of structure. The number of words within each
unit is irrelevant, so no amount of counting will produce the right
result for question formation. In these sentences (though not in all
English sentences) the solution is to take the word which follows the
ﬁrst unit and bring it to the front:
AUNT JEMIMA
HAS
DROPPED HER FALSE TEETH
DOWN THE DRAIN
THE MAN WHO HAS 
WAS
ATTACKED BY A WASP
RUN AWAY SHOUTING
SLUGS
ARE
SLIMY
MARY
HAS
SWALLOWED A SAFETY PIN
This may seem an obvious solution to people who already know
English – but it is not at all clear why language should behave in this
way. As Chomsky pointed out:
The result is . . . surprising from a certain point of view. Notice
that the structure-dependent operation has no advantages from
the point of view of communicative efﬁciency or ‘simplicity’. If
we were, let us say, designing a language for formal manipulations
by a computer, we would certainly prefer structure-independent
operations. These are far simpler to carry out, since it is only
necessary to scan the words of the sentence, paying no attention
to the structures which they enter, structures that are not marked
physically in the sentence at all.
(Chomsky 1972b: 30)
Yet, amazingly, all children learning language seem to know auto-
matically that language involves structure-dependent operations. On

the face of it, one might expect them to go through a prolonged
phase of testing out Martian-like solutions – but they do not. This
leads Chomsky to suggest that humans may have an innate knowledge
of this phenomenon:
Given such facts, it is natural to postulate that the idea of ‘structure-
dependent operations’ is part of the innate schematism applied by
the mind to the data of experience.
(Chomsky 1972b: 30)
This knowledge, he argued (somewhat controversially), ‘is part of the
child’s biological endowment, part of the structure of the language
faculty’ (Chomsky 1988: 45).
The structure-dependent nature of the operations used in language
is all the more remarkable because there are often no overt clues to
the structure. Experiments carried out by psycholinguists have made
it clear that listeners do not have to rely on auditory clues for inter-
preting the main structural divisions. For example, Garrett et al. (1966)
constructed two sentences which each contained the words:
GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY TO THE STATION:
1
IN ORDER TO CATCH HIS TRAIN GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY TO
THE STATION.
2
THE REPORTERS ASSIGNED TO GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY TO
THE STATION.
In the ﬁrst sentence, it is GEORGE who is driving furiously. In the
second, it is the REPORTERS. In order to understand the sentence,
the listener must (mentally) put the structural break in the correct
place:
IN ORDER TO CATCH HIS TRAIN
GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY TO
THE STATION.
THE REPORTERS ASSIGNED TO
DROVE FURIOUSLY TO THE
GEORGE
STATION.
Just to check that the listeners were not using auditory clues, the experi-
menters recorded both these sentences on to tapes. Then they cut the
words GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY TO THE STATION off
each tape, and spliced them to the other sentence:

IN ORDER TO CATCH HIS

TO THE STATION.
THE REPORTERS ASSIGNED
GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY
TO
TO THE STATION.
They then played the newly spliced tapes to students – but into one
ear only. In the other ear the students heard a click, which was placed
in the middle of a word, for example, GEORGE. The students were
then asked whereabouts in the sentence the click had occurred. The
interesting result was that in their reports students tended to move
the location of the click in the direction of the structural break:
IN ORDER TO CATCH HIS TRAIN GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY TO
THE STATION
THE REPORTERS ASSIGNED TO GEORGE DROVE FURIOUSLY TO
THE STATION.
This indicates clearly that listeners impose a structure on what they
hear for which there is often no physical evidence.
Another point made by Chomsky (1959) and others is that simple
slot-ﬁlling operations are inadequate as explanations of language. It
has sometimes been suggested that anyone learning language allocates
to each sentence a number of ‘slots’ and then ﬁts units of structure
into each hole, for example:
1
2
3
BEES
LOVE
HONEY
I
WANT
MY TEA
MY BROTHER
HAS HIT
ME
No one would deny the existence of such substitutions and their value
in language learning. But the problem is that there is a lot more going
on besides, which cannot be accounted for by the ‘slot’ idea: ‘It is
evident that more is involved in sentence structure than insertion of
lexical items in grammatical frames’ (Chomsky 1959: 54). For example,
look at the following sentences:

As soon as we try to ﬁnd other words to ﬁt into the slot occupied by
can be, we run into problems. Are ﬁts in with the ﬁrst sentence but
not the second, whereas is ﬁts in with the second but not the ﬁrst:
PERFORMING FLEAS
ARE
AMUSING
*PERFORMING FLEAS
IS
AMUSING
*PLAYING TIDDLYWINKS
ARE
AMUSING
PLAYING TIDDLYWINKS
IS

If slot-ﬁlling was the sole principle on which language worked, one
would not expect this result. In fact, slot-ﬁlling makes it quite impos-
sible to explain how the listener knows, in the sentences where the
centre slot is ﬁlled by can be, that it is the ﬂeas who are performing,
but that it is not the tiddlywinks who are playing. But examples of
‘constructional homonymity’ (as Chomsky calls such superﬁcially similar
utterances) are by no means rare.
Even more inexplicable from a slot-ﬁlling point of view are sentences
which can be interpreted in two different ways:
CLEANING LADIES CAN BE DELIGHTFUL:
1
LADIES WHO CLEAN CAN BE DELIGHTFUL.
2
TO CLEAN LADIES CAN BE DELIGHTFUL.
THE MISSIONARY WAS READY TO EAT:
1
THE MISSIONARY WAS ABOUT TO EAT.
2
THE MISSIONARY WAS ABOUT TO BE EATEN.
Sentences such as these indicate that merely ﬁlling a grammatical frame
may be only part of what is happening when we speak. Such examples
led Chomsky in the 1960s to suggest that language might be organized
on two levels: a surface level, in which words are in the place where
they actually occur, and a deep level, in which words are located in
their ‘proper’ place in the slot structure.
Chomsky’s arguments that a ‘deeper’ level of syntax underlay the
surface level were interesting, but not necessarily right. Other expla-
nations are possible, as he himself later stressed (Chomsky 1995b). The
important point is that the differing interpretations of the ambiguous
sentences described above can not be explained by means of the bar-
pressing antics of rats, nor by means of simple slot-ﬁlling operations.
Some more complex procedure is involved.

So far, then, language can be said to be structure-dependent – and
the types of structure-dependent operations involved seem to be
complex.
Creativity is another fundamental aspect of language which is stressed
repeatedly by Chomsky. By this, he seems to mean two things. First,
and primarily he means the fact that humans have the ability to
understand and produce novel utterances. Even quite strange sentences,
which are unlikely to have been uttered before, cause no problems
for speakers and hearers:
THE ELEPHANT DRANK SEVENTEEN BOTTLES OF SHAMPOO, THEN
SKIPPED DRUNKENLY ROUND THE ROOM.
THE AARDVARK CLEANED ITS TEETH WITH A PURPLE
TOOTHBRUSH.
This means that it is quite impossible to assume that a person gradually
accumulates strings of utterances throughout their life and stores them
ready for use on an appropriate occasion. And as well as producing
new grammatical sequences, anyone who has mastered a language is
automatically able to discard deviant utterances which they may never
have met before. Sequences such as:
*HE WILL HAD BEEN SINGING
or:
*GIRAFFE UNDER IN WALKS GORILLA THE
will be rejected instantaneously by any normal speaker of English.
Chomsky also used ‘creativity’ in a second, subsidiary sense to mean
that utterances are not controlled by external happenings. The appear-
ance of a daffodil does not force humans to shriek ‘Daffodil’. They
can say whatever they like: ‘What a lovely colour’, ‘It’s spring, I must
remember to clean my car’, or ‘Why do ﬂowers always give me hay
fever?’
Most humans are so used to these properties of language that they
no longer seem odd – but they have not yet been fully explained.
Chomsky spoke of ‘this still mysterious ability’ when referring to the
creative nature of human speech:
Having mastered a language, one is able to understand an indeﬁnite
number of expressions that are new to one’s experience, that bear

no simple physical resemblance and are in no simple way analogous
to the expressions that constitute one’s linguistic experience; and
one is able with greater or less facility to produce such expressions
on an appropriate occasion, despite their novelty and independently
of detachable stimulus conﬁgurations, and to be understood by
others who share this still mysterious ability. The normal use of
language is, in this sense, a creative activity. This creative aspect
of normal language is one fundamental factor that distinguishes
human language from any known system of animal communication.
(Chomsky 1972a: 100)
Chomsky stressed that the creative aspect of language is normal.
Humans produce novel utterances all the time, and anybody who does
not is likely to be brain damaged:
It is important to bear in mind that the creation of linguistic
expressions that are novel but appropriate is the normal mode of
language use. If some individual were to restrict himself largely
to a deﬁnite set of linguistic patterns, to a set of habitual responses
to stimulus conﬁgurations . . . we would regard him as mentally
defective, as being less human than animal. He would immediately
be set apart from normal humans by his inability to understand
normal discourse, or to take part in it in the normal way – the
normal way being innovative, free from control by external stimuli,
and appropriate to a new and ever-changing situation.
(Chomsky 1972a: 100)
It becomes clear that there is much more to language than merely
stringing together words. In order to speak, a human possesses a highly
complex internalized set of instructions or ‘rules’ which enables him
or her to utter any of the permissible sequences of English – though
they are unlikely to have any conscious knowledge of these ‘rules’.
The rules are both complex and stringent, as Mr Knipe discovered (a
character in The Great Automatic Grammatizator by Roald Dahl):
Then suddenly he was struck by a powerful but simple little truth,
and it was this: that English grammar is governed by rules that
are almost mathematical in their strictness! . . . Therefore, it stands
to reason that an engine built along the lines of the electric
computer could be adjusted to arrange words in their right order
according to the rules of grammar . . . There was no stopping
Knipe now. He went to work immediately. After ﬁfteen days of

continuous labour, Knipe had finished building his ‘Great
Automatic Grammatizator’.
But Mr Knipe is a character in a science-ﬁction story. As already noted,
in real life no linguist, no computer expert has yet managed to build
an ‘automatic grammatizator’ – a device which will account for all
and only the permissible sequences of English.
Yet children do it all the time: in a remarkably short period, they
acquire a complex set of internalized rules. And children have con-
siderably less data to work from than the linguists who have failed to
produce ‘automatic grammatizators’. They are often restricted to hearing
their parents and relatives talking – and, according to Chomsky, this
speech is likely to be full of unﬁnished sentences, mistakes and slips
of the tongue. We must therefore ‘explain how we know so much,
given that the evidence available to us is so sparse’ (Chomsky 1986:
xxvii). Furthermore, according to him, the acquisition of one’s native
language seems to be largely independent of intelligence. The language
ability of dim children is not noticeably inferior to that of bright
children – yet in most other areas of human activity – such as roller-
skating or playing the piano – the gap between different children is
enormous.
Although Chomsky is now generally thought to exaggerate the
rapidity of acquisition, the substandard nature of the data, and the
uniformity of ability, the great mystery remains: how do children
construct ‘automatic grammatizators’ for themselves?
At the moment, the issue is still argued about. Two (main) possibilities
exist:
Possibility 1 Human infants ‘know’ in advance what languages are like.
This is the possibility preferred by Chomsky:
Given the richness and complexity of the system of grammar for
a human language and the uniformity of its acquisition on the
basis of limited and often degenerate evidence, there can be little
doubt that highly restrictive universal principles must exist deter-
mining the general framework of each human language and perhaps
much of its speciﬁc structure as well.
(Chomsky 1980: 232)
Possibility 2 No special advance knowledge is needed, because children
are highly efﬁcient puzzle-solvers in all areas of human behaviour.
Language is just one type of puzzle which their high level of general

intelligence enables them to solve fast and well. In the words of the
linguist Geoffrey Sampson:
Individual humans inherit no ‘knowledge of language’ . . . they
succeed in mastering the language spoken in their environment
only by applying the same general intelligence which they use to
grapple with all the other diverse and unpredictable problems that
come their way.
(Sampson 1980: 178)
It may not be necessary to choose between these possibilities. As
this book will suggest, the answer may well lie somewhere between
these two extremes. In this controversy, it is important to keep an
open mind, and not be swayed by the fashion of the moment. In the
1960s, it was fashionable to follow Chomsky. In the 1970s it was
equally fashionable to hold the view of his opponents. Both views
were found in the 1990s, and are still found in tht twenty-ﬁrst century.
Chomsky’s claim that children are pre-programmed to speak requires
serious attention. As the nineteenth-century American philosopher
C.S. Peirce pointed out: ‘If men had not come . . . with special aptitudes
for guessing right, it may well be doubted whether . . . the greatest
mind would have attained the amount of knowledge which is actually
possessed by the lowest idiot’ (Peirce 1932: 476). And as the psycholo-
gist Steven Pinker noted in his book The Language Instinct:
Some kinds of bats home in on ﬂying insects using Doppler sonar.
Some kinds of migratory birds navigate thousands of miles by
calibrating the positions of the constellations against the time of
day and year. In nature’s talent show we are simply a species 
of primate with our own act, a knack for communicating informa-
tion about who did what to whom by modulating the sounds we
make when we exhale.
(Pinker 1994: 19)
Chomsky’s belief that humans are genetically imprinted with know-
ledge about language is often referred to as ‘the innateness hypothesis’.
Unfortunately, the word ‘innate’ has given rise to a considerable amount
of confusion. Misunderstandings have arisen in two ways. First, to call
Chomsky an ‘innatist’ wrongly implies that those who disagree with
him are ‘non-innatists’. Yet his opponents have never asserted that
nothing is innate. All human skills, even apparently unnatural ones,
make use of innate predispositions. For example, driving a car is an

‘unnatural’ acquired skill, yet it makes use of innate propensities, such
as the ability to see, and to co-ordinate arm and leg movements. The
issue under discussion is whether an inbuilt language acquisition skill
exists independently of other innate inabilities. The point is expressed
well by two philosophers:
It is beyond dispute that some innate equipment ﬁgures in the
acquisition of language (otherwise the baby’s rattle would learn
language as well as the baby, since they have comparable linguistic
environments). The only question at issue is whether this innate
structure has signiﬁcant components that subserve the development
of no other faculty than language.
(Osherson and Wasow 1976: 208)
Chomsky claims that the mind is ‘constituted of “mental organs” just
as specialized and differentiated as those of the body’ (1979: 83), and
that ‘Language is a system . . . easy to isolate among the various mental
faculties’ (1979: 46). This is the claim which we are trying to evaluate.
The second misunderstanding involves a mistaken belief by some
people that ‘innate’ means ‘ready-made for use’. By innate, Chomsky
simply means ‘genetically programmed’. He does not literally think
that children are born with language in their heads ready to be spoken.
He merely claims that a ‘blueprint’ is there, which is brought into
use when the child reaches a certain point in her general development.
With the help of this blueprint, she analyses the language she hears
around her more readily than she would if she were totally unprepared
for the strange gabbling sounds which emerge from human mouths.
Or perhaps a better metaphor would be that of a seed, which
contains within itself the intrinsic ability to become a dahlia or rose,
provided it is planted and tended. Chomsky argues that ‘language
grows in the mind/brain’ (Chomsky 1988: 55). He explains the situation
by quoting the eighteenth-century thinker James Harris: ‘The growth
of knowledge . . . [rather resembles] . . . the growth of Fruit; however
external causes may in some degree cooperate, it is the internal vigour,
and virtue of the tree, that must ripen the juices to their maturity’
(Chomsky 1986: 2).
In this book, the suggestion that language is a special, pre-
programmed activity will be explored further. As Chomsky noted
(1979: 84):
No one finds it outlandish to ask the question: what genetic
information accounts for the growth of arms instead of wings?

Why should it be shocking to raise similar questions with regard
to the brain and mental facilities?
Or, as a more recent researcher pointed out (Anderson 2004: 307):
Language as we know it is a uniquely human capacity, determined
by our biological nature, just as the ability to detect prey on the
basis of radiated heat is a biological property of (some) snakes.
But we will also be looking at the alternative viewpoint, that humans
are intelligent animals, endowed with talented analytic abilities, which
enable them to sort out the puzzle of language via their general
intelligence.
In the next few chapters, the evidence in favour of each of these
viewpoints will be assessed. The next chapter will look at the ability
– or non-ability – of animals to communicate with one another in
language-like ways.

Animals that try to talk
Is language restricted to humans?
An ant who can speak 
French, Javanese and Greek
Doesn’t exist. 
Why ever not?
Robert Desnos
Judging by newspapers and popular books, there appear to be a vast
number of animals which ‘talk’ – talking budgerigars, talking dolphins
– even a talking ﬁsh:
Anne, Anne, come quick as you can
There’s a ﬁsh that talks in the frying pan.
Walter de la Mare
Clearly, the word ‘talk’ can be used in two totally different senses.
On the one hand, it can mean simply ‘to utter words’, as in ‘Archibald’s
got a talking parrot which says Damn if you poke it.’ On the other
hand, it can mean ‘to use language in a meaningful way’. We already
know that animals such as budgerigars can ‘talk’ in the ﬁrst sense of
the word. Psycholinguists would like to ﬁnd out whether animals can
‘talk’ in the second sense also. They are interested in this problem
because they want to know the answer to the following question: are
we the only species which possesses language? If so, are we the only
species capable of acquiring it?
These are the topics examined in this chapter. First, animal com-
munication systems are compared with human language to see if animals
can be said to ‘talk’ in any real sense. Second, various attempts to
teach language to animals are considered. The overall purpose behind
such inquiries is to ﬁnd out whether humans alone have the power of
speech. Are we biologically singled out as ‘articulate mammals’ or not?

Of course, if we discover that animals do talk, then we shall not
have learned anything useful, just as the fact that we can do the breast
stroke does not tell us anything about a frog’s innate swimming ability.
Or, as three prominent psychologists acidly noted, ‘The fact that a
dog can be trained to walk on its hind legs does not prejudice the
claim that bipedal gait is genetically coded in humans. The fact that
we can learn to whistle like a lark does not prejudice the species-
speciﬁcity of birdsong’ (Fodor et al. 1974: 451). If on the other hand,
we ﬁnd that animals do not talk, this will provide some support for
the claim that language is restricted to the human race. We are not
merely indulging in a neurotic desire to verify that humans are still
superior to other species, as has sometimes been suggested. The purpose
of this chapter is a more serious one. Some animals, such as dolphins
and chimpanzees, have a high level of intelligence. If, in spite of this,
we ﬁnd that language is beyond their capability, then we may have
found some indication that language is a genetically programmed activity
which is largely separate from general intelligence.
Do animals talk naturally?
A ﬁrst task is to ﬁnd out whether any animals naturally have a true
‘language’. In order to answer this question, we must compare human
language with animal communication. But such a comparison presents
a number of perhaps unsolvable problems. Two in particular need to
be discussed before we can give a coherent reply to the query, ‘Do
animals talk naturally?’
The ﬁrst problem is this: are we comparing systems which differ
quantitatively or qualitatively? On the one hand, human language may
have gradually evolved from a more primitive animal means of com-
munication in a continuous line of growth – a viewpoint sometimes
known as a ‘continuity’ theory. On the other hand, human language
may be something quite different from our basic animal heritage, and
superimposed on it. This is a ‘discontinuity’ theory.
Supporters of continuity theories suggest that language grew out of
a primate call system, like the ones used by apes today. They assume
that humans started out with a simple set of cries in which each one
meant something different, such as, ‘Danger!’ or ‘Follow me!’ or ‘Don’t
touch that female, she’s mine!’ These cries gradually became more
elaborate, and eventually evolved into language. A possible intermediate
stage is seen in the cries of the vervet monkey. This monkey has
several alarm calls which distinguish between different types of danger
(Struhsaker 1967). The chutter announces that a puff adder or cobra

is around. The rraup gives warning of an eagle. A chirp is used for
lions and leopards. A less panic-stricken utterance, the uh!, signals the
presence of a spotted hyena or Masai tribesman. According to some,
it is a very short step from an alarm call warning of a poisonous snake
to using the chutter as a ‘word’ symbolizing a poisonous snake.
Another interpretation of these signals is possible. The monkeys
could merely be distinguishing between the intensity of different types
of danger. They may be more frightened of puff adders than eagles
– or vice versa. This plausible explanation has been ruled out by an
experiment in which a concealed loudspeaker played recordings of
the various alarm calls. When they heard a chutter, the vervets stood
on their hind legs and looked around for a snake. At the sound of a
rraup they dived into the vegetation as if hiding from an eagle. And
at the lion-leopard chirp, they hastily climbed up a tree (Seyfarth et al.
1980a, 1980b; Cheney and Seyfarth 1990). So the monkeys clearly
have a special signal for each type of enemy.
Yet the danger cries of monkeys are still far from human language.
They are a mix of a shriek of fear and a warning to others, and are
only partly a symbol. The huge gulf between these calls and ‘real’
speech has led many people to argue for a discontinuity theory.
Proponents of discontinuity theories claim that humans still retain their
basic set of animal cries, which exist alongside language. Yelps of pain,
shrieks of fear, and the different types of crying observed in babies
may be closely related to the call systems of monkeys. If this view is
correct then it is fairly difﬁcult to compare human and animal means
of communication. It may be like comparing two things as different
as the Chinese language and a set of trafﬁc lights. But a continuity versus
discontinuity divide may be over-simple. Language is a complex mosaic
in which some features are continuous, and some discontinuous with
animal communication. Exactly which is which is still under discussion.
The second major problem we face is that it is not always easy to
decide what counts as communication in animals. As one researcher
notes:
Students of animal behaviour have often noted the extreme
difﬁculty of restricting the notion of communication to anything
less than every potential interaction between an organism and its
environment.
(Marshall 1970: 231)
So that, at the very least, sticklebacks mating, cats spitting and rabbits
thumping their back legs must be taken into consideration – and it

isn’t at all clear where to stop. It is sometimes suggested that this
problem could be solved by concentrating on examples where the
animal is intentionally trying to convey information. But such distinctions
are difﬁcult to draw, both in humans and animals. If a man smoothes
down his hair when an attractive woman walks into the room, is this
an unconscious response? Or is he doing it intentionally in the hope
of catching her attention? In the sea, so-called ‘snapping shrimps’ can
produce loud cracks by closing their claws sharply. Since the cracks
can upset naval sonar devices, marine biologists have attempted to
discover the circumstances which lead the shrimps to produce them.
But no one has yet discovered the signiﬁcance of the snaps. They
may be informative – but they may not. There is no way in which
we can be sure about making the right decision when it comes to
interpreting such a phenomenon.
Having outlined these fundamental problems – which show that
any conclusions we draw are only tentative – we can now return to
our main theme: a comparison of human language and animal com-
munication. How should we set about this?
A useful ﬁrst step might be to attempt to deﬁne ‘language’. This is
not as easy as it sounds. Many deﬁnitions found in elementary textbooks
are too wide. For example: ‘A language is a system of arbitrary vocal
symbols by means of which a social group cooperates’ (Bloch and
Trager 1942: 5). This deﬁnition might equally well apply to a pack
of wolves howling in chorus.
A superﬁcially promising approach was that suggested by the linguist
Charles Hockett in the 1960s. In a series of articles stretching over
ten years he attempted to itemize the various ‘design features’ which
characterize language. For example: ‘Interchangeability: Adult members
of any speech community are interchangeably transmitters and receivers
of linguistic signals’; ‘Complete Feedback: The transmitter of a linguistic
signal himself receives the message’ (Hockett 1963: 9). Of course, such
an approach is not perfect. A list of features may even be misleading,
since it represents a random set of observations which do not cohere
in any obvious way. To use this list to deﬁne language is like trying
to deﬁne a man by noting that he has two arms, two legs, a head, a
belly button, he bleeds if you scratch him and shrieks if you tread on
his toe. Or, as a more recent researcher noted: ‘Any checklist . . . is
almost certain to be superﬁcial. Consider the deﬁnition of humans as
“featherless bipeds”. Who would be content with that as an expression
of the nature of humanness . . . ?’ (Anderson 2004: 57). A major
problem is that such a list does not indicate which features are the
most important, or how they might be linked to one another. But in

spite of this, a deﬁnition of language based on design features or
‘essential characteristics’ may be a useful ﬁrst step.
But how many characteristics should be considered? Two? Ten? A
hundred? The number of design features Hockett considered important
changed over the years. His longest list contained sixteen (Hockett
and Altmann 1968). Perhaps most people would consider that maybe
eleven features capture the essential nature of language, not all of
which are mentioned by Hockett. These are: use of the vocal-auditory
channel, arbitrariness, semanticity, cultural transmission, spontaneous usage,
turn-taking, duality, displacement, structure-dependence, creativity, ability to
read intentions. Some of these features are fairly general and occur
widely in the animal world. Others are more specialized.
Let us discuss each of these features in turn, and see whether it is
present in animal communication. If any animal naturally possesses all
the design features of human language, then clearly that animal can
talk.
The use of the vocal-auditory channel is perhaps the most obvious
characteristic of language. Sounds are made with the vocal organs, and
a hearing mechanism receives them – a phenomenon which is neither
rare nor particularly surprising. The use of sound is widespread as 
a means of animal communication. One obvious advantage is that
messages can be sent or received in the dark or in a dense forest. Not
all sound signals are vocal – woodpeckers tap on wood, and rattlesnakes
have a rattle apparatus on their tail. But vocal-auditory signals are
common and are used by birds, cows, apes and foxes, to name just a
few. The advantages of this method of producing the sound are that
it leaves the body free to carry on other activities at the same time,
and also requires relatively little physical energy. But this design feature
is clearly neither unique to humans, nor all-important, since language
can be transferred without loss to visual symbols (as in sign language,
or writing) and to tactile symbols (as in Braille). Patients who have
had their vocal cords removed, and communicate mainly by writing,
have not lost their language ability. It follows that this characteristic
is of little use in an attempt to distinguish animal from human
communication. So let us proceed to the second feature, arbitrariness.
Arbitrariness means that human languages use neutral symbols. There
is no connection between the word DOG and the four-legged animal
it symbolizes. It can equally be called UN CHIEN (French), EIN
HUND (German), or CANIS (Latin). GÜL (Turkish) and RHODON
(Greek) are equally satisfactory names for a ‘rose’. As Juliet famously
noted:

Animals that try to talk

What’s in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet.
(Shakespeare)
Onomatopoeic words such as CUCKOO, POP, BANG, SLURP and
SQUISH are exceptions to this. But there are relatively few of these
in any language. On the other hand, it is normal for animals to have
a strong link between the message they are sending and the signal
they use to convey it. A crab that wishes to convey extreme aggression
will extend a large claw. A less angry crab will merely raise a leg:
‘Extending a major chaliped is more effective than raising a single
ambulatory leg in causing the second crab to retreat or duck back
into its shell’ (Marshall 1970: 231). However, arbitrary symbols are
not unique to humans. Gulls, for example, sometimes indicate aggres-
sion by turning away from their opponent and uprooting beakfuls of
grass. So we conclude that arbitrariness cannot be regarded as a critical
distinction between human and animal communication.
Semanticity, the third suggested test for language ability, is the use
of symbols to ‘mean’ or refer to objects and actions. To a human, a
CHAIR ‘means’ a four-legged contraption you can sit on. Humans
can generalize by applying this name to all types of chairs, not just
one in particular. Furthermore, semanticity applies to actions as well
as objects. For example, to JUMP ‘means’ the act of leaping in the
air. Some writers have claimed that semanticity is exclusively human.
Animals may be able to communicate only about a total situation. A
hen who utters ‘danger’ cries when a fox is nearby is possibly conveying
the message ‘Beware! Beware! There is terrible danger about!’ rather
than using the sound to ‘mean’ FOX. But, as was shown by the call
of the vervet monkey who might mean ‘snake’ when it chutters, it
is difﬁcult to be certain. We must remain agnostic about whether this
feature is present in animal communication.
Cultural transmission or tradition indicates that human beings hand
their languages down from one generation to another. The role played
by teaching in animal communication is unclear and varies from
animal to animal – and even with species. Among birds, it is claimed
that the song thrush’s song is largely innate, but can be slightly modiﬁed
by learning, whereas the skylark’s song is almost wholly learned. Birds
such as the chafﬁnch are particularly interesting: the basic pattern of
the song seems to be innate, but all the ﬁner detail and much of the
pitch and rhythm have to be acquired by learning (Thorpe 1961,
1963). However, although the distinction between humans and animals
is not clear-cut as regards this feature, it seems that a far greater

proportion of communication is genetically inbuilt in animals than in
humans. A child brought up in isolation away from human beings,
does not acquire language. In contrast, birds reared in isolation sing
songs that are sometimes recognizable, though almost always abnormal.
The ﬁfth and sixth features are social ones, in that they relate to
the way in which language is used. Spontaneous usage indicates that
humans initiate speech freely. Speaking is not something which they
do under duress, like a dog that will stand on its hind legs only when
a biscuit is held above its nose. This feature is certainly not restricted
to humans, and many animals use their natural communication systems
freely. The other social feature, turn-taking, means exactly what it says:
we take it in turns to speak. In the majority of conversations, we do
not talk while other people are talking, nor do we compete with
them. Instead, we politely wait our turn, as shown in a brief conversa-
tion between two characters in P.G. Wodehouse’s Carry on Jeeves:
‘What ho!’ I said.
‘What ho!’ said Motty.
‘What ho! What ho!’
‘What ho! What ho! What ho!’
As we can see, Motty and the narrator have no idea what to say to
one another. Nevertheless, they know that they have to take it in
turns to talk. Such turn-taking begins at a very early age. Even mothers
and babies alternate as they mouth nonsense syllables at each other.
Once again, this is not an exclusively human characteristic, since birds
sometimes sing duets together. One bird sings a few phrases, then
pauses while the other has its turn, a phenomenon known as antiphonal
singing.
The seventh property, duality or double-articulation, means that
language is organized into two ‘layers’: the basic sound units of speech,
such as P, I, G, are normally meaningless by themselves. They only
become meaningful when combined into sequences such as P-I-G
PIG. This property is sometimes claimed to be unique to humans.
But this is not so. Duality is also present in birdsong, where each
individual note is itself meaningless – it is the combinations of notes
which convey meaningful messages. So once again we have not found
a critical difference between animals and humans in their use of this
feature.
A more important characteristic of language is displacement, the ability
to refer to things far removed in time and place. Humans frequently
say things such as ‘My Aunt Matilda, who lives in Australia, cracked

her knee-cap last week.’ It may be impossible for an animal to convey
a similar item of information. However, as in the case of other design
features, it is sometimes difﬁcult to decide whether displacement is
present in an animal’s communication system. A bird frequently con-
tinues to give alarm cries long after the disappearance of a cat which
was stalking it. Is this displacement or not? The answer is unclear.
Deﬁnite examples of displacement are hard to ﬁnd. But it is undoubtedly
found in bee communication (von Frisch 1950, 1954, 1967). When a
worker bee ﬁnds a source of nectar it returns to the hive to perform
a complex dance which informs the other bees of its location. It does
a ‘round dance’, which involves turning round in circles if the nectar
is close to the hive, and a ‘waggle dance’ in which it wiggles its tail
from side to side if it is far away. The other bees work out the distance
by noting the tempo of its waggles, and discover what kind of ﬂower
to look for by smelling the scent on its body. Bees, incidentally, are
not deaf, as was once assumed. As a forager bee dances, it beats its
wings. The bees in a dark hive can hear and interpret the wing-beats
even when they cannot see the dance (Kirchner and Towne 1994).
This is an unusual ability – but even this degree of displacement is
considerably less than that found in human speech. The bee cannot
inform other bees about anything further removed than the nectar
patch it has just visited. It cannot say ‘The day before yesterday we
visited a lovely clump of ﬂowers, let’s go and see if they are still there’
– it can only say, ‘Come to the nectar I have just visited.’ Nor can
it communicate about anything further away in place. It could not
say ‘I wonder whether there’s good nectar in Siberia.’ So displacement
in bee communication is strictly limited to the number of miles a bee
can easily ﬂy, and the time it takes to do this. At last, it seems we
may have found a feature which seems to be of importance in human
language, and is only partially present in non-human communication.
The ninth feature, structure-dependence, was discussed in Chapter 1.
Humans do not just apply simple recognition or counting techniques
when they speak to one another. They automatically recognize the
patterned nature of language, and manipulate ‘structured chunks’. For
example, they understand that a group of words can sometimes be
the structural equivalent of one:
SHE
THE OLD LADY WHO WAS WEARING
GAVE THE DONKEY A 
A WHITE BONNET

And they can re-arrange these chunks according to conventional ‘rules’:

DONKEY
WEARING A WHITE BONNET
As far as we know, animals do not use structure-dependent operations.
We do not know enough about the communication of all animals to
be sure, but no deﬁnite example has yet been found.
The next feature, one that seems to be of overwhelming importance,
and possibly unique to humans, is the ability to produce and understand
an indeﬁnite number of novel utterances. This property of language
has several different names. Chomsky calls it creativity (Chapter 1),
others call it openness or productivity. Humans can talk about anything
they like – even a platypus falling backwards downstairs – without
causing any linguistic problems to themselves or the hearers. They
can say what they want when they want. If it thunders, they do not
automatically utter a set phrase, such as ‘It’s thundering, run for cover.’
They can say ‘Isn’t the lightning pretty’ or ‘Better get the dog in’ or
‘Thunder is two dragons colliding in tin tubs, according to a Chinese
legend.’
In contrast, most animals have a ﬁxed number of signals which
convey a set number of messages, sent in clearly deﬁnable circumstances.
A North American cicada can give four signals only. It emits a ‘distur-
bance squawk’ when it is seized, picked up or eaten. A ‘congregation
call’ seems to mean ‘Let’s all get together and sing in chorus!’ A
preliminary courtship call (an invitation?) is uttered when a female is
several inches away. An advanced courtship call (a buzz of triumph?)
occurs when the female is almost within grasp (McNeill 1970). Even
the impressive vervet monkey has only thirty-six distinct vocal sounds
in its repertoire. And as this includes sneezing and vomiting, the actual
number used for communication is several fewer. Within this range,
choice is limited, since circumstances generally dictate which call to
use. An infant separated from its mother gives the lost rrah cry. A
female who wishes to deter an amorous male gives the ‘anti-copulatory
squeal-scream’ (Struhsaker 1967).
But perhaps it is unfair to concentrate on cicadas and monkeys.
Compared with these, bees, dolphins and birds have extremely
sophisticated communication systems. Yet researchers have reluctantly
concluded that even they seem unable to say anything new. The bees

were investigated by the famous ‘bee-man’, Karl von Frisch. He noted
that worker bees normally give information about the horizontal distance
and direction of a source of nectar. If bee communication is in any
sense ‘open’, then a worker bee should be able to inform the other
bees about vertical distance and direction if necessary. He tested this
idea by placing a hive of bees at the foot of a radio beacon, and a
supply of sugar water at the top. But the bees who were shown the
sugar water were unable to tell the other bees where to ﬁnd it. They
duly performed a ‘round dance’, indicating that a source of nectar was
in the vicinity of the hive – and then for several hours their comrades
ﬂew in all directions except upwards looking for the honey source.
Eventually, they gave up the search. As von Frisch noted, ‘The bees
have no words for “up” in their language. There are no ﬂowers in
the clouds’ (von Frisch 1954: 139). Failure to communicate this extra
item of information means that bee communication cannot be regarded
as ‘open-ended’ in the same way that human language is open-ended.
The dolphin experiments carried out by Jarvis Bastian were consid-
erably more exciting – though in the long run equally disappointing.
Bastian tried to teach a male dolphin, Buzz, and a female, Doris, to
communicate across an opaque barrier.
First of all, while they were still together, Bastian taught the dolphins
to press paddles when they saw a light. If the light was kept steady,
they had to press the right-hand paddle ﬁrst. If it ﬂashed, the left-
hand one. When they did this correctly they were rewarded with ﬁsh.
As soon as they had learned this manoeuvre, he separated them.
They could now hear one another, but they could not see one another.
The paddles and light were set up in the same way, except that the
light that indicated which paddle to press ﬁrst was seen only by Doris.
But in order to get ﬁsh both dolphins had to press the levers in the
correct order. Doris had to tell Buzz which this was, as only she could
see the light. Amazingly, the dolphins ‘demonstrated essentially perfect
success over thousands of trials at this task’ (Evans and Bastian 1969:
432). It seemed that dolphins could talk! Doris was conveying novel
information through an opaque barrier!
But it later became clear that the achievement was considerably less
clever. Even while the dolphins were together Doris had become
accustomed to making certain sounds when the light was ﬂashing and
different sounds when it was continuous. When the dolphins were
separated she continued the habit. And Buzz had, of course, already
learnt which sounds of Doris’s to associate with which light. Doris
was therefore not ‘talking creatively’.

So not even dolphins have a ‘creative’ communication system in
the human sense – even though they make underwater ‘clicks’ which
are astonishingly sophisticated (Au 1993). Their so-called clicks are
intermittent bursts of sound, each of which lasts less than a thousandth
of a second, in frequencies beyond the range of human hearing. By
listening for their echoes, a dolphin can locate a tiny eel in a bed of
mud, or a ﬁsh the size of a ping-pong ball 70 metres away. The
dolphin ﬁrst sends out a very general click, then progressively modiﬁes
it as it gets echoes back, so allowing it to get more and more accurate
information. As far as we know, this is restricted to the size and location
of shapes – though one interesting recent proposal is that each individual
dolphin might have its own ‘signature whistle’ which could be regarded
as its ‘name’.
Finally, we come to birds. They also have failed to give any evidence
of creativity. We might expect them to communicate about a
multiplicity of situations, since the individual notes of a bird’s song
can be combined in an indefinite number of ways. But as far as
researchers can judge, birdsong deals above all with just two aspects
of life: courting a mate, and the marking of territory (Nottebohm
1975; Marler 1991). A bird who appears to humans to be indulging
in an operatic aria on the pleasures of life is more likely to be warning
other birds not to encroach on its own particular area of woodland.
It seems, then, that animals cannot send truly novel messages, and
that Ogden Nash encapsulates a modicum of truth in his comment:

Animals that try to talk

The song of canaries 
never varies. 
And so does Alice in her complaint about kittens:
It is a very inconvenient habit of kittens that, whatever you say
to them, they always purr. If they would only purr for ‘yes’ and
mew for ‘no’, or any rule of that sort, so that one could keep up
a conversation! But how can you talk with a person if they always
say the same thing?
(Lewis Carroll)
A ﬁnal, crucial feature of language has come to the forefront in
recent years. This is intention-reading (Tomasello 2003), or mind-reading
(Baron-Cohen 1999). Normal humans are able to understand the
intentions of other humans. If one saw a child shivering, one might
realize it was cold, and try to lend it a warm jersey. This ability to
empathize with another, to put oneself into another person’s shoes,
as it were, may be the key to language, and is not found fully in the
(non-human) animal world. Some limited awareness of it has been
detected among apes, especially chimps. But humans are the best 
at this skill: ‘Human beings are the world’s experts at mind reading.
As compared with other species, humans are much more skillful at
discerning what others are perceiving, intending, desiring, knowing,
and believing. Although the pinnacle of mind-reading is understanding
beliefs – as beliefs are indisputably mental and normative – the
foundational skill is understanding intentions.’ (Tomasello et al. 2005).
Animal researchers have suggested that mind-reading is revealed by
an ability to deceive one another (Byrne and Whiten 1992; Aitchison
1996/2000), since true deceit requires one to think about another
person’s mind-set. An infant chimp was observed to scream in order
to persuade its mother to comfort it. An older chimp led other chimps
away from a hidden store of bananas, then doubled back in order to
scoff his bananas alone. The possible brain adaptations which underlie
mind-reading will be discussed in Chapter 3, though a basic problem
is that intention reading is not an all or nothing skill, it can be partial
both in some humans (usually very young or sometimes mentally
handicapped people) and perhaps in some apes.
It is now possible to answer the question, can animals talk? If, in
order to qualify as ‘talkers’ they have to utilize all the design charac-
teristics of human language ‘naturally’, the answer is clearly ‘no’. Some
animals possess some of the features. Birdsong has duality, and bee

dancing has some degree of displacement. But, as far as we know, 
no animal communication system has duality and displacement. No
animal system can be proved to have semanticity or to use structure-
dependent operations. Above all, no animal can communicate creatively
with another animal, and no animal can mind-read with the ease and
efﬁciency of humans.
But although animals do not ‘naturally’ talk, this does not mean
that they are incapable of talking. Perhaps they have just never had the
chance to learn language. The next section examines the results obtained
with animals which have had this opportunity.
In discussing attempts to teach language to animals, mimicry must
be distinguished from ‘true’ language. Mynah birds can imitate humans
with uncanny accuracy, but like most talking birds, they are merely
‘parroting’ back what they hear. A budgerigar I knew heard a puppy
being trained with words such as ‘Sit!’ ‘Naughty boy!’ and used to
shriek ‘Sit!’ ‘Naughty boy!’ whenever anyone went near its cage,
whether or not the dog was present.
Yet some parrots might be capable of more. Nearly half a century
ago, a grey parrot could apparently say ‘Good morning’ and ‘Good
evening’ at the right times, and ‘Goodbye’ when guests left (Brown
1958). More recently, Alex, another grey parrot, has gone much further.
Alex was bought from a pet store in the Chicago area of America in
1977 when he was 13 months old. After careful training, he could
label more than thirty objects, such as grape, chair, key, carrot; seven
colours such as blue, yellow, purple; and ﬁve shapes such as triangle,
square. He could also respond to questions asking whether colours and
shapes were the same or different (Pepperberg 2000). This is far more
than ‘bird-brains’ were assumed to be capable of. But even Alex’s
achievements are low compared with those of apes, as will be outlined
below.
Teaching sign language to apes: Washoe and Nim
Over the past 50 or so years, several attempts have been made to
teach human language to chimpanzees. The ﬁrst experiment was a
failure. An animal named Gua was acquired by Luella and Winthrop
Kellogg in 1931, when she was 7 months old (Brown 1958; Kellogg
and Kellogg 1933). She was brought up as if she was a human baby,
and was fed with a spoon, bathed, pinned up in nappies, and
continuously exposed to speech. Although she eventually managed to
understand the meaning of over seventy single words, she never spoke.
Gua showed clearly that it was not just lack of opportunity which

prevents a chimp from learning language. The Kelloggs’ son Donald,
who was brought up alongside Gua, and was approximately the same
age, grew up speaking normally.
A second chimp acquired by Keith and Cathy Hayes in 1947 also
proved disappointing (Brown 1958; Hayes 1951). Viki was given
intensive coaching in English. She eventually learnt four words: PAPA,
MAMA, CUP, UP. But these were very unclearly articulated, and
remained the sum total of Viki’s utterances after three years of hard
training.
It is now clear why these attempts failed. Chimps are not physio-
logically capable of uttering human sounds. More recent experiments
have avoided this trap and used other media. Let us consider some of
this later research.
From the mid 1960s, teaching language to apes became a popular
pastime among American psychologists. A minor population explosion
of ‘talking chimps’ followed. Broadly, they can be divided into signers,
who were taught sign language, and pointers, who pressed symbols
on a keyboard. Our discussion will begin with two signers, Washoe
and Nim, then move on to two pointers, Lana and Kanzi.
Washoe’s exact age is unknown, but she is estimated to now be
over 40 years old. She is a female chimp acquired by Allen and Beatrix
Gardner in 1966, when she was thought to be approximately a year
old. She was taught to use modiﬁed American sign language (ASL).
In this system signs stand for words. For example, Washoe’s word 
for ‘sweet’ was made by putting her ﬁnger on the top of her tongue,
while wagging the tongue. Her word for ‘funny’ was signalled by
pressing the tip of her ﬁnger on to her nose, and uttering a snort.
Washoe acquired her language in a fairly ‘natural’ way. The Gardners
kept her continuously surrounded by humans who communicated
with her and each other by signs. They hoped that some of this would
‘rub off’ on her. Sometimes they asked her to imitate them, or tried
to correct her. But there were no rigorous training schedules.
Even so, teaching a wild chimpanzee was quite a problem: ‘Washoe
can become completely diverted from her original object, she may
ask for something entirely different, run away, go into a tantrum, or
even bite her tutor’ (Gardner and Gardner 1969: 666). But her progress
was impressive and, at least in the early stages, her language development
was not unlike that of a human child.
First, she acquired a number of single words, for example COME,
GIMME, HURRY, SWEET, TICKLE – which amounted to thirty-
four after 21 months, but later crept up to well over one hundred.
The number is accurate because a rota of students and researchers

made sure that Washoe, who lived in a caravan in the Gardners’
garden, was never alone when she was awake. And a sign was assumed
to be acquired only after Washoe had used it spontaneously and
appropriately on consecutive days.
Washoe’s speech clearly had ‘semanticity’. She had no difﬁculty in
understanding that a sign ‘meant’ a certain object or action, as was
shown by her acquisition of the word for ‘toothbrush’ (index ﬁnger
rubbed against teeth). She was forced, at ﬁrst against her will, to have
her teeth brushed after every meal. Consequently, she had seen the
sign for ‘toothbrush’ on numerous occasions, though she had never
used it herself. One day, when she was visiting the Gardners’ home
she found a mug of toothbrushes in the bathroom. Spontaneously, she
made the sign for ‘toothbrush’. She was not asking for a toothbrush,
as they were within reach. Nor was she asking to have her teeth
brushed, a procedure she hated. She appeared simply to be ‘naming’
the object. Similarly, Washoe made the sign for ‘ﬂower’ (holding the
ﬁngertips of one hand together and touching the nostrils with them)
when she was walking towards a ﬂower garden, and another time when
she was shown a picture of ﬂowers.
Washoe could also generalize from one situation to another, as was
clear from her use of the sign meaning ‘more’. Like all chimps, she
loved being tickled, and she would pester any companion to continue
tickling her by using the ‘more’ sign. At ﬁrst the sign was speciﬁc to
the tickling situation. Later she used it to request continuation of
another favourite activity, being pushed across the ﬂoor in a laundry
basket. Eventually, she extended the ‘more’ sign to feeding and other
activities. Similarly, the word for ‘key’ referred originally only to the
key used to unlock the doors and cupboards in her caravan. Later, she
used the sign spontaneously to refer to a wide variety of keys, including
car ignition keys. Her ‘speech’ also incorporated a limited amount of
displacement, since she could ask for absent objects and people.
But most impressive of all was Washoe’s creativity – her apparently
spontaneous use of combinations of signs. She produced two- and
three-word sequences of her own invention, such as GIMME TICKLE
‘Come and tickle me’, GO SWEET ‘Take me to the raspberry bushes’,
OPEN FOOD DRINK ‘Open the fridge’, LISTEN EAT ‘Listen to
the dinner gong’, HURRY GIMME TOOTHBRUSH, and ROGER
WASHOE TICKLE. Washoe’s signs were not just accidental juxta-
positions. During a sequence of signs Washoe kept her hands up in
the ‘signing area’. After each sequence she let them drop. This is
comparable to the use of intonation by humans to signal that words
are meant to be joined together in a construction. Does this mean

that Washoe could actually ‘talk’? At least superﬁcially, her sequences
seem parallel to the utterances of a human child. Washoe’s requests
for MORE SWEET, MORE TICKLE seem similar to requests for
MORE MILK or MORE SWING recorded from children. But there
is one important difference. Children normally preserve a ﬁxed word
order. English children put the subject or agent of a sentence before
the action word, as in MUMMY COME, EVE READ, ADAM PUT,
CAR GONE. But Washoe did not always seem to care in what order
she gave her signs. She was as likely to say SWEET GO as GO
SWEET to mean ‘Take me to the raspberry bushes’.
There are a number of possible explanations. First, the overeagerness
of the researchers who worked with Washoe may have been to blame.
They were so anxious to encourage her that they rushed to gratify
every whim. Since SWEET GO and GO SWEET have only one
possible interpretation – Washoe wanted some raspberries – they
immediately understood and took her there. The idea that word
ordering was necessary may never have occurred to her. Perhaps if
she had ever experienced difﬁculty in making herself understood she
might have been more careful about structuring her sequences.
Another possibility is that it may be easier to utter vocal sounds in
sequence than it is to maintain a ﬁxed order with signs. Some studies
have suggested that deaf adults are inconsistent in their ordering of
sign language.
A third possibility is that the ﬂuctuating order in Washoe’s signing
was merely a temporary intermediate stage which occurred before
Washoe eventually learnt to keep to a ﬁxed sequence. This is the
point of view supported by the Gardners. They claim that Washoe
eventually settled down to a standard sign order which was based on
the order of adult English (since, of course, Washoe’s companions had
used an English word order when they used sign language with her).
Yet another possible explanation of Washoe’s unreliable sign order
is that she did not, and could not, understand the essentially patterned
nature of language. In this case, she certainly did not understand or
use structure-dependent operations, one of the key tests for determining
whether she can ‘talk’. But it is difﬁcult to be sure. And we may
never know for certain as she is no longer in the situation where she
is continually surrounded by humans whose main task is to hold
conversations with her. She grew so large and potentially dangerous
that the Gardners were obliged to send her to live at a primate sanctuary.
But even when her period of intensive exposure to sign language was
over, research assistants still came to talk to her (Fouts 1997). After
leaving the Gardners, she continued to use signs creatively, as when

she spontaneously signed WATERBIRD to mean ‘swan’. However,
since she was beside a river when she produced this combination, it
is possible that she made two separate signs, one referring to the water,
the other to the swan.
In her new home, Washoe was given an infant chimp, Loulis, to
adopt, and tried to teach him some signs. On one occasion, Washoe
put a chair in front of Loulis, and then demonstrated the CHAIR-
SIT sign to him ﬁve times. And, both through imitating Washoe and
other signing chimps, Loulis developed his own repertoire of signs
(Fouts et al 1982; Fouts 1983). These days, Washoe, Loulis and two
other chimps, Tatu and Dar all live together. They interact with
humans and each other by means of signs, though of course also use
spontaneous chimp gestures and vocalizations.
Now the fact that Washoe spontaneously transmitted signs to another
chimp is interesting and important, but it does not magically turn
these signs into ‘language’. In brief, we have to conclude that although
Washoe’s speech is sometimes creative, and showed semanticity and
displacement, it has not been shown to be structure-dependent. We
cannot be sure, because Washoe’s ‘speech’ was only ever partly analysed
– recording it all was impossible, and any repeated signs were usually
ignored by the Gardners.
But Nim Chimpsky, a male chimpanzee, who was taught a sign
system some years later, was attended by a ﬂeet of graduate students
who recorded his every sign. He was for several years under the care
of Herbert Terrace at Columbia University, New York. Somewhat
ironically, Nim’s achievements began to interest psycholinguists mainly
after the project ran out of money, and Nim was returned to a
chimpanzee colony in Oklahoma. Without Nim around, Terrace found
that he had much more time to analyse the material he had collected
so far. The data from Project Nim, therefore, have been examined
much more carefully than those from any of the other animals. With
Nim out of the way, Herbert Terrace was able to sort out and classify
the data he had accumulated over the previous 4 years.
At ﬁrst sight, Nim’s sign sequences were impressive. Of the 20,000
recorded, approximately half were two-sign combinations, and 1,378
were different. A superﬁcial look at the signs suggested to Terrace
that they were structured (Terrace 1979a: 72). For example, of the
two-sign utterances which included the word MORE, 78 per cent
had MORE at the beginning as in MORE TICKLE, MORE DRINK,
and of the two-sign utterances involving a transitive verb (a verb
which takes an object), 83 per cent had the verb before the object,
as in TICKLE NIM, HUG NIM. But a closer analysis showed that

the appearance of structure was an illusion. Nim simply had a statistical
preference for putting certain words in certain places, while other
words showed no such preference. He preferred to put the word
MORE at the beginning of a sequence, the word NIM at the end,
and any foods he was requesting at the beginning also. But many
other words had a random distribution. Take the word EAT, a high
frequency item in his vocabulary. It occurred in the two-, three- and
four-sign sequences set out in the tables below.

It would require a considerable amount of imagination and wishful
thinking to detect a coherent structure in such a collection. Looking
at the two-sign sequences, we note that EAT NIM, NIM EAT and
ME EAT are all very common, making it impossible to claim that
there is a ﬁrm subject-verb, or verb-subject order. A similar pattern
occurs in the three-sign sequences, with EAT ME NIM, NIM ME
EAT, ME NIM EAT and EAT NIM ME all occurring a signiﬁcant
number of times. It is particularly noticeable that Nim’s longer
utterances were not in any way more interesting and sophisticated
than his shorter ones – they were simply more repetitive. Of the
thirteen four-sign sequences noted above, ten of them involved repeated
items, and five of them were simply a doubling up of two-sign
utterances: EAT DRINK EAT DRINK, EAT NIM EAT NIM,
DRINK EAT DRINK EAT, NIM EAT NIM EAT, ME EAT ME
EAT. Nim’s longest recorded utterance was a sixteen-sign sequence
which involved only ﬁve different signs: GIVE ORANGE ME GIVE
EAT ORANGE ME EAT ORANGE GIVE ME EAT ORANGE
GIVE ME YOU. On this evidence, it seems incontestable that ‘Repeti-
tive, inconsistently structured strings are in fact characteristic of ape
signing’ (Petitto and Seidenberg 1979: 186).
Terrace found a number of other differences between Nim’s signing
and true language. For example, when Nim was just over 2 years old,
38 per cent of his utterances were full or partial imitations. Almost 2
years later, the number of imitations had gone up to 54 per cent. Nim
was producing more imitations as he got older, the reverse of what
happens with human children. Nim was also unable to grasp the give-
and-take of conversation, and his signing showed no evidence of turn-
taking. Furthermore, he rarely initiated conversations. Only 12 per
cent of his utterances were truly spontaneous, and the remaining 88
per cent were in response to his teachers. We may conclude, therefore,
that Nim did not use his signs in the structured, creative, social way
that is characteristic of human children. It seems reasonable to agree
with Terrace that ‘It would be premature to conclude that a chim-
panzee’s combinations show the same structure evident in the sentences
of a child’ (1979a: 221) and that ‘Nim’s signing with his teachers bore
only a superﬁcial resemblance to a child’s conversations with his or
her parents’ (Terrace 1983: 57).
Somewhat surprisingly, this conclusion has been ﬁercely challenged.
Terrace’s critics point out that Nim was a highly disturbed young
chimp. Due to frequent changes in those who taught him, Nim was
insecure and maladjusted. They claim that his achievements are
considerably lower than one might expect from a ‘normal’ animal.

Others have argued that a computer analysis of chimp utterances that
takes no account of the actual situation is bound to give an odd result.
Negative results are to be expected if one chooses to simply:
lump together four years’ worth of recorded utterances, remove
all verbal and nonverbal context and grind the result through a
computer to look for statistical regularities.
(Gardner and Gardner 1980: 357)
The dispute is still unsettled, and perhaps will remain so, because
signing chimps are enormously labour-intensive: every sign has to be
observed or video-recorded. So alternative language-systems may be
easier to analyse, as will be discussed in the next section.
Conquerors of the keyboard: Lana and Kanzi
Lana, a female chimp, was the ﬁrst animal to use a keyboard with
visual symbols. She underwent rigorous training in a sophisticated
environment – as perhaps beﬁts an animal whose project was partly
funded by the Coca-Cola company. Lana’s ‘cage’ at the Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Centre in Atlanta, Georgia, was a room
of which one side was a huge keyboard linked up to a computer.
Beginning in 1971, she was taught to communicate by pressing the
keys, each one of which was marked with a symbol standing for a
word. A vending device was attached to the keyboard, so that if Lana
correctly requested some item of food or drink, she was able to obtain
it immediately (Rumbaugh 1977; Savage-Rumbaugh 1986).
Lana acquired over 100 symbols in her repertoire, which mainly
involved items and actions around her, such as ‘give’, ‘banana’, ‘Coke’,
and so on. She could cope well with arbitrary symbols, since the
symbols on her keyboard were formed by combinations of geometric
ﬁgures on different coloured backgrounds. For example, a small solid
circle inside a larger diamond on a purple background was the symbol
for ‘Lana’, the animal’s name. A diamond superimposed on a circle
inside a rectangle on a blue background was the symbol for ‘eat’.

Moreover, Lana’s ability to generalize showed that her system had
semanticity, that is, she understood that a symbol referred to a certain
type of object, or colour, not just one particular thing. For example,
she was taught the word MORE in connection with an extra ration
of fruitjuice. Within a few days, she was reliably attaching the symbol
for MORE to other types of food and drink whenever she wanted
an additional helping, as in MORE BREAD, MORE MILK. Lana
also showed some evidence of creativity. For example, she was taught
the words PUT and IN in connection with putting a ball into a bowl
or box. Soon after, Tim, one of her trainers, was late with her morning
drink of milk. Lana spontaneously made the request TIM PUT MILK
IN MACHINE. This shows not only creativity, but also displacement
– the ability to talk about absent objects and events. In addition, Lana
coined the descriptive phrases APPLE WHICH-IS ORANGE for
‘orange’, and BANANA WHICH-IS GREEN for cucumber.
So far, then, Lana’s language ability seems similar to that of Washoe
in that she showed semanticity, displacement and creativity. Let us
now look at the way in which she combined symbols. Was she able
to cope with structure-dependent operations? Clearly, Lana realized
that symbols could not be jumbled together randomly. She learned
to follow a set sequence in accordance with her trainer’s instructions.
She could carry out simple slot-ﬁlling exercises, helped by the fact
that in her symbol system, each type of word had a different background
colour.

LANA

It is possible, though unlikely, that she understood the notion of
hierarchical structure: the idea that a group of symbols could be
substituted for a single one without altering the basic sentence pattern.
Her colour-coding system probably hindered her from drawing such
conclusions, since in a phrase such as THIS BOWL each word would
be a different colour. Furthermore, there is no concrete evidence that
she manipulated slots in the way humans do.
To be fair to Lana, however, we perhaps need to consider a
conversation which she had with her trainer Tim one Christmas Day.

On that day, she produced two similar strings of symbols (Stahlke
1980):
QUERY YOU GIVE COKE TO LANA IN CUP.
QUERY YOU GIVE COKE IN CUP TO LANA.
This looks remarkably like the kind of structure-dependent operation
performed by humans, in which they manipulate groups of words 
to produce different effects. But a closer look at Lana’s behaviour on
that Christmas Day suggests that she was not as clever as one might
at ﬁrst suspect. She had begun by demanding Coke, using the ﬁrst of
the sentences listed above: QUERY YOU GIVE COKE TO LANA
IN CUP. She repeated this demand seven times, with no success.
Then in desperation, and once only, she tried another variant: QUERY
YOU GIVE COKE IN CUP TO LANA. It seems, then, that such
structural manipulations were not characteristic of Lana’s output, and
this one probably occurred by chance. Normally, she adhered rigidly
to the sequence she had been taught in order to get her reward, so
she had little scope for stylistic modiﬁcations. On the basis of this one
example, then, it would be premature to conclude that she could cope
with structure-dependent operations, which are a crucial characteristic
of human language.
Lana’s trainers, incidentally, conﬁdently claim that she had ‘language’,
but they deﬁne ‘language’ in a much broader way than we have done.
To them, a language is any communication system which refers
consistently to the outside world by means of a set of arbitrary symbols
which are combined together in accordance with conventional rules
(Rumbaugh 1977: 66), a deﬁnition which might bring even a set of
trafﬁc lights within its scope!
Austin and Sherman also deserve a mention. These two young male
chimpanzees have been taught the same system as Lana (Savage-
Rumbaugh 1986). They have surpassed her in one way, in that they
are able to communicate with one another. If Austin presses a symbol
for a banana, then Sherman can go into the next room, select the
banana from a tray of food, and take it back to Austin. This impressive
piece of cooperation does not, however, make the whole system any
more language-like.
Let us now move on to Kanzi. Kanzi is a bonobo, a separate ape
species, and one discovered only in the twentieth century. Bonobos
or ‘pygmy chimps’ are not very different in height from ordinary
chimps, but they have longer legs, narrower shoulders, a smaller head
and long black hair parted in the middle. Some of their gestures look

human-like: they beg by stretching out an open hand, for example.
According to some, they are a ‘living link’ between humans and
ordinary chimpanzees. Their most noteworthy features are the female-
dominated nature of their society, and the high level of sexual activity
they indulge in, apparently their preferred method of avoiding conﬂict.
They are also highly intelligent (de Waal 1996, 2006).
Kanzi, a male bonobo, was born in 1980, and taken to the same
research centre as Lana. By chance, Matata, an older female bonobo
who had already been selected for language training, took a strong
liking to him, and became his adopted ‘mother’. Kanzi became used
to seeing Matata’s keyboard, which was somewhat like Lana’s. Eventu-
ally, Kanzi started to use the keyboard himself.
In the ﬁrst 18 months of training, Kanzi learned around ﬁfty symbols,
and also started to combine them spontaneously, as in MATATA
GROUPROOM TICKLE – apparently a request that Matata should
be allowed to join in a game of tickle in the room where bonobos
met together (Savage-Rumbaugh and Lewin 1994).
Kanzi’s language was monitored continuously, but was analysed in
detail for a 5-month period when he was 51⁄2. Over 13,000 ‘utterances’
were recorded, of which just over 10 per cent comprised two or more
elements. Of these multiword sequences, 723 were spontaneous, in
that they were not produced in response to a caregiver, or in imitation.
During the ﬁrst month of those 5, Kanzi showed no particular
symbol ordering: he produced HIDE PEANUT as often as PEANUT
HIDE. But then he started to use a fairly ﬁxed ordering of putting
the action before the object, as HIDE PEANUT, BITE TOMATO,
a rule apparently picked up from his trainers.
But he also invented rules. If he wanted someone to chase or tickle
him, he would specify the action CHASE or TICKLE via a lexigram
(keyboard symbol), then make a pointing gesture to the person he
wanted to chase or tickle him.
Perhaps most impressive of all was Kanzi’s comprehension of spoken
language. On one occasion, he was asked to throw his ball in the river
– a novel request – which he promptly obeyed. On another occasion
he was asked to give an onion to Panbanisha, his half-sister. He looked
around for an onion patch, pulled up a bunch, and handed them to
Panbanisha. Overall, Kanzi’s trainers estimated that he correctly
responded to 74 per cent of spoken sentences.
Kanzi is therefore a highly intelligent, sociable creature. But his
‘language’ is not signiﬁcantly more advanced than that of the other
primates discussed in this chapter. And like them, he used symbols

primarily to obtain items he wanted, mainly food. The notion of
talking for the sake of talking is largely a human attribute.
Let us now summarize our conclusions on these primates. We need
to recognize, perhaps, that having language is not an ‘all or nothing’
matter. It is misleading to ‘treat language like virginity – you either
have it or you don’t’ (Miles 1983: 44). All the apes we have discussed
can cope with arbitrary symbols and semanticity, and display some
displacement and creativity in their ‘speech’. They therefore have a
grasp of some design characteristics of language which hitherto had
been regarded as speciﬁcally human. However, their ability does not
extend much further. The animals show little evidence of structure,
they merely display a preference for placing certain symbols ﬁrst or
last in a sequence.
We cannot therefore agree with Lana’s trainers, who assert that
‘neither tool-using skills nor language serve qualitatively to separate
man and beast any more’ (Rumbaugh 1977: 307), nor with the
researcher who has claimed that ‘The Berlin Wall is down, and so is
the wall that separates man from chimpanzee’ (Bates 1993: 178).
Chomsky may be right, therefore, when he points out that the higher
apes ‘apparently lack the capacity to develop even the rudiments of
the computational structure of human language’ (Chomsky 1980: 57).
Or, put more simply, ‘we have . . . presented evidence for the existence
[in child language] of certain general cognitive processes – falling under
two overall headings of intention reading and pattern-ﬁnding – that
account for the acquisition process.’ (Tomasello 2003: 295). These
cognitive skills seem to be either lacking or incomplete in non-humans.
Note ﬁnally that even though intelligent animals seem capable of
coping with some of the rudimentary characteristics of human language,
they do not seem predisposed to cope with them. As one commentator
noted: ‘As with watching a circus horse walk on its hind legs, I could
not escape the feeling that a species ill-adapted to symbolic communi-
cation was struggling with an unnatural task’ (Marshall 1987: 310).
The situation is parallel to that found among birds. Some birds are
able to learn the songs of a different species. But they ﬁnd the task a
difﬁcult one. When the birds are removed from the alien species, and
placed among their own kind, they learn their normal song with
extreme rapidity. They seem to have an innate predisposition towards
one kind of song rather than another (Thorpe 1963). Many animals
have special, biologically ordained skills: 
Alligators, for example, have a special set of sensors on the skin
of their faces that respond sensitively to the slightest disturbance

of the surface of a body of water in which the alligator is mostly
immersed. Catching (and eating) the sources of such disturbance
is one of the alligator’s most useful (and characteristic) skills, and
there is no serious doubt that this skill results from speciﬁc, inherited
aspects of the animal’s biology. Similarly, the use of language to
communicate is one of humankind’s most useful and characteristic
skills, for which a comparable account is no less plausible.
(Anderson 2004: 56)
The apparent ease with which humans acquire language, compared
with other apes, supports the suggestion that they are innately program-
med to do so. The next chapter examines whether there is any biological
evidence for this apparently unique adaptation to language.

Grandmama’s Teeth
Is there biological evidence for
innate language capacity?
‘O grandmama, what big teeth you have!’ said Little Red Riding Hood. 
‘All the better to eat you with, my dear,’ replied the wolf. 
If an animal is innately programmed for some type of behaviour, then
there are likely to be biological clues. It is no accident that ﬁsh have
bodies which are streamlined and smooth, with ﬁns and a powerful
tail. Their bodies are structurally adapted for moving fast through the
water. The same is true of whales and dolphins, even though they
evolved quite separately from ﬁsh. Similarly, if you found a dead bird
or mosquito, you could guess by looking at its wings that ﬂying was
its normal mode of transport.
However, we must not be over-optimistic. Biological clues are 
not essential. The extent to which they are found varies from animal
to animal and from activity to activity. For example, it is impossible
to guess from their bodies that birds make nests, and, sometimes,
animals behave in a way quite contrary to what might be expected
from their physical form: ghost spiders have tremendously long legs,
yet they weave webs out of very short strands. To a human observer,
their legs seem a great hindrance as they spin and move about the
web. On the other hand, the orb spider, which has short legs, makes
its web out of very long cables, and seems to put a disproportionate
amount of effort into walking from one side of the web to another
(Duncan 1949, quoted in Lenneberg 1967: 75). In addition, there are
often inexplicable divergences between species which do not correlate
with any obvious differences in behaviour. The visible sections of the
ear differ in chimps, baboons and men – but there is no discernible
reason behind this. However, such unpredictability is not universal,
and need not discourage us from looking for biological clues connected
with speech – though we must realize that we are unlikely to ﬁnd
the equivalent of a large box labelled ‘language’.

Changes in the form of the body or structural changes are the most
direct indications of innate programming. But we must also take into
consideration physiological adaptations – changes in the bodily functions,
such as rate of heartbeat and breathing. The ﬁrst part of this chapter
looks at parts of the human body where adaptations related to language
are likely to be found. The organs used to produce and plan it are
examined – the mouth, vocal cords, lungs and the brain.
The second part of the chapter is slightly different. It considers
aspects of language where complex neuromuscular sequencing is
involved. It becomes clear that the co-ordination required is perhaps
impossible without biological adaptations.
Mouth, lungs and grey matter
If we look at the organs used in speech, humans seem to be somewhere
in the middle between the obvious structural adaptation of birds to
ﬂying, and the apparent lack of correlation between birds and nest-
building. That is, the human brain and vocal tract have a number of
slightly unusual features. By themselves, these features are not sufﬁcient
to indicate that people can talk. But if we ﬁrst assume that all humans
speak a language, then a number of puzzling biological facts fall into
place. They can be viewed as partial adaptations of the body to the
production of language.
For example, human teeth are unusual compared with those of other
animals. They are even in height, and form an unbroken barrier. They
are upright, not slanting outwards, and the top and bottom set meet.
Such regularity is surprising – it is certainly not needed for eating. Yet
evenly spaced, equal-sized teeth which touch one another are valuable
for the articulation of a number of sounds, S, F, and V, for example,
as well as SH (as in shut), TH (as in thin) and several others. Human
lips have muscles which are considerably more developed and show
more intricate interlacing than those in the lips of other primates. The
mouth is relatively small, and can be opened and shut rapidly. This
makes it simple to pronounce sounds such as P and B, which require
a total stoppage of the airstream with the lips, followed by a sudden
release of pressure as the mouth is opened. The human tongue is thick,
muscular and mobile, as opposed to the long, thin tongues of monkeys.
The advantage of a thick tongue is that the size of the mouth cavity
can be varied allowing a range of vowels to be pronounced.
It seems, then, that humans are naturally geared to produce a number
of different sounds rapidly and in a controlled manner. Their mouths
possess features which either differ from or appear to be missing in

the great apes. In all, one cannot help agreeing with the comment of
a nineteenth-century writer:
What a curious thing speech is! The tongue is so serviceable a
member (taking all sorts of shapes just as it is wanted) – the teeth,
the lips, the roof of the mouth, all ready to help; and so heap up
the sound of the voice into the solid bits which we call consonants,
and make room for the curiously shaped breathings which we call
vowels!
(Oliver Wendell Holmes)
Another important difference between humans and monkeys
concerns the larynx, which contains the ‘voice box’ or ‘vocal cords’.
Strangely, it is simpler in structure than that of other primates. But
this is an advantage. Air can move freely past and then out through
the nose and mouth without being hindered by other appendages.
Biologically, streamlining and simpliﬁcation are often indications of
specialization for a given purpose. For example, hooved animals have
a reduced number of toes, and ﬁsh do not have limbs. So the stream-
lining of the human larynx may be a sign of adaptation to speech.
But we pay a price for our specialized larynx. A monkey can seal its
mouth off from its windpipe and breath while it is eating. Humans
cannot do this, so food can get lodged in the windpipe, sometimes
causing them to choke to death.
We now come to the lungs. Although there is no apparent peculiarity
in the structure of our lungs, our breathing seems to be remarkably
adapted to speech. In most animals the respiratory system is a very
ﬁnely balanced mechanism. A human submerged under water for more
than two minutes will possibly drown. Anyone who pants rapidly and
continuously for any length of time faints and sometimes dies. Yet
during speech the breathing rhythm is altered quite noticeably without
apparent discomfort to the speaker. The number of breaths per minute
is reduced. Breathing-in is considerably accelerated, breathing-out is
slowed down. Yet people frequently talk for an hour or more with
no ill-effects. A child learning to play the ﬂute or trumpet has to be
carefully instructed in breathing techniques – but no one has to
instruct a 2-year-old in the breathing adaptations required for talking.
It is impossible to tell which came ﬁrst – speech or breathing adaptations.
As the biologist Eric Lenneberg inquired (1967: 81), do donkeys say
hee-haw on inspired and expired air so efﬁciently because of the way
their breathing mechanisms were organized, or did the hee-haw come
ﬁrst? The answer is irrelevant. All that matters to us is that any child

born in the twentieth century has a breathing mechanism apparently
biologically organized for speech.
It seems, then, that there are clear indications in the mouth, larynx
and lungs that we speak ‘naturally’. However, let us now consider the
human brain. To what extent is this programmed for speech? The
answer is unclear. Our brain is very different in appearance from that
of other animals. It is heavier, with more surface folding of the cortex,
the outer layer of ‘grey matter’ which surrounds the inner core of
nerve ﬁbres – though grey matter is actually pink in live humans, it
goes grey after death. Of course, size alone is not particularly important.
Elephants and whales have bigger brains than humans, but they do
not talk. But elephants and whales also have bigger bodies, so some
people have suggested that it is the brain–body ratio which matters.
At ﬁrst sight, this seems a promising approach. It appears quite reason-
able to suggest that a high brain–body ratio means high intelligence,
which in turn might be a prerequisite for language, especially when
we ﬁnd that the brain of an adult human is more than 2 per cent of
his or her total weight, while that of an adult chimp is less than 
1 per cent. But such ratios can be very misleading. Some animals are
designed to carry around large reserves of energy which makes their
bodies enormously heavy. Camels, for example, are not necessarily
more stupid than horses just because they have huge humps.
But even apart from problems such as this, brain–body ratio cannot
be a decisive factor as far as language is concerned, since it is possible
to ﬁnd young chimpanzees and human children who have similar
brain–body ratios – yet the child can talk and the chimp cannot. Even
more convincing is a comparison between a 3-year-old chimp and a
12-year-old nanocephalic dwarf – a human who because of a genetic
defect grows to a height of around 760 mm (or 2 feet 6 inches).

Although the chimp and the dwarf have exactly the same brain and
body weights (and so, of course, the same brain–body ratio), the
dwarfs speak, in a somewhat limited fashion, but the chimps do not.

These ﬁgures show conclusively that the difference between human
and chimp brains is a qualitative, not a quantitative one.
Superﬁcially, the brains of a chimp and a human have certain simi-
larities. As in a number of animals, the human brain is divided into
a lower section, the brain stem, and a higher section, the cerebrum. The
brain stem keeps the body alive by controlling breathing, heartbeats
and so on. A cat with the upper section of its brain removed but with
the brain stem intact could still swallow milk, purr, and pull its paw
away from a thorn when pricked. The higher section, the cerebrum,
is not essential for life. Its purpose seems to be to integrate an animal
with its environment. This is the part of the brain where language is
likely to be organized.
The cerebrum is divided into two halves, the cerebral hemispheres, which
are linked to one another by a series of bridges. The left hemisphere
controls the right side of the body, and the right hemisphere the left
side.
But the two hemispheres do not function identically. This was ﬁrst
discovered over a hundred years ago. A Frenchman, Marc Dax, read
a paper at Montpellier in 1836, pointing out that paralysis of the right
side of the body was often associated with loss of speech, while patients
whose left side was paralysed could usually talk normally. This suggested
that the left hemisphere controlled not only the right side of the body,

but speech also. Dax’s hypothesis turned out to be correct. Speech in
the majority of humans is the concern of the left, not the right
hemisphere. But it was a long time before this was reliably conﬁrmed.
Until relatively recently, statistics could only be drawn up by chance
observations, when researchers managed to note cases of people in
whom loss of speech was associated with right-side paralysis. But in
the twentieth century more sophisticated methods were adopted. One
is the sodium amytal test developed by Wada in the 1940s. In this
test the patient was asked to count out loud while a barbiturate (sodium
amytal) was injected into an artery carrying blood to one side of the
brain. If this was the hemisphere used in speech, the patient lost all
track of his counting and experienced severe language difﬁculties for
several minutes. If it was not, the patient could resume normal counting
almost immediately after the injection. Although this test was effective,
it also carried an element of risk. So it was only used when brain
surgery was advisable (as in severe epilepsy) and the surgeon wished
to know whether he was likely to disturb vital speech areas. If so, he
was unlikely to operate.

Simpler and less invasive methods for discovering which hemisphere
controls language are now the norm. The ﬁrst was the use of dichotic
listening tests (Kimura 1967; Obler and Gjerlow 1999). The subject
wears headphones, and is played two different words simultaneously,
one into each ear. For example, he or she might hear six in one ear,
and two in the other. Most people can report the word played to the
right ear (which is directly linked to the left hemisphere) more
accurately than the word played to the left ear (linked to the right
hemisphere). It is clear that this is not simply due to an overall preference
for sounds heard in the right ear, because for non-linguistic sounds
the left ear is better. If different tunes are played simultaneously into
each ear, subjects will identify the tune played into the left ear better
than the one directed into the right ear. We conclude that the left
hemisphere is better at processing linguistic signals – and so is normally
the dominant one for speech.
A further technique is tachistoscopic (fast-view) presentation. An
image is presented very fast to either the left or right visual ﬁeld (the
area that can be seen to left or right without moving the head or
eyes). A linguistic stimulus will normally be processed faster if it is
presented to the right visual ﬁeld, which is then transferred to the left
(usually language dominant) hemisphere.
In another twentieth-century technique, electrodes are attached to
the skull in order to measure the amount of electrical activity in the
area beneath (as will be discussed later). Spoken words produce a
greater response in the left hemisphere, whereas noises such as mechan-
ical clicks arouse a greater response in the right (Rosenﬁeld 1978).

The results of the observations and tests described above are
surprisingly consistent. The majority of normal human beings – perhaps
as many as 90 per cent – have speech located primarily in the left
hemisphere. This cannot be due to chance.
A further related discovery is that the location of speech centres in
the left hemisphere seems to be linked to right-handedness. That is,
most humans are right-handed, and most people’s speech is controlled
by the left hemisphere. In the nineteenth century it was commonly
assumed that left-handers must have speech located in the right hemi-
sphere, and this seemed to be conﬁrmed by a report in 1868 by the
inﬂuential neurologist John Hughlings Jackson that he had discovered
loss of speech in a left-hander who had sustained injury to the right
side of the brain. But this viewpoint turns out to be false. Surprisingly,
most left-handers also have language controlled predominantly by the
left hemisphere, though the picture is not completely straightforward.
Of the relatively few people who do not have their speech centres
located in the right hemisphere, more are left-handed than right-
handed.

Right-handers 
Left-handers

Right hemisphere
10% or less
10–30%
(Figures averaged from Penﬁeld and Roberts 1959; Zangwill 1973;
Milner, et al. 1964.)
These ﬁgures indicate two things: ﬁrst, it is normal for speech and
handedness to be controlled by the same hemisphere, and it has been
suggested that speech and writing problems are found more frequently
in children where the two are not linked. Second, there is a strong
tendency for speech to be located in the left hemisphere even when
this appears to disrupt the standard linking of speech and handedness.
Some work has been directed at ﬁnding out if all speech processing
must be located in one hemisphere or whether subsidiary linguistic
abilities remain in the non-dominant hemisphere. One group of
researchers at Montreal, Canada, found ten patients who had speech
abilities in both halves of the brain. The sodium amytal test disturbed
speech whichever side of the brain it was injected. Interestingly enough,

all these patients were either left-handed or ambidextrous (Milner, 
et al. 1964).
Other studies suggest that the right hemisphere contains a limited
potential for language which is normally latent, but which can be acti-
vated if needed. Patients who have had the whole of the left hemisphere
removed are at ﬁrst without speech. But after a while, they are likely
to acquire a limited vocabulary, and be able to comprehend a certain
amount, though they always have difficulty in producing speech
(Kinsbourne 1975). The right hemisphere is not useless, however.
Patients with right hemisphere damage have difﬁculty with intonation,
and in understanding jokes and metaphors (Caplan 1987).
Perhaps the most widely reported experiments on this topic are those
involving ‘split brain’ patients (Gazzaniga 1970, 1983). In cases of severe
epilepsy it is sometimes necessary to sever the major links between the
two hemispheres. This means that a patient has virtually two separate
brains, each coping with one half of the body independently. A patient’s
language can be tested by dealing with each hemisphere separately. An
object shown to the left visual ﬁeld is relayed only to the right (non-
language hemisphere). Yet sometimes the patient is able to name such
an object. This indicates that the right hemisphere may be able to cope
with simple naming problems – but it seems unable to cope with syntax.
However, the results of these experiments are disputed. Some people
have suggested that the information is being transferred from one
hemisphere to the other by a ‘back route’ after the major links have
been severed.
This lateralization or localization of language in one half of the brain,
then, is a deﬁnite, biological characteristic of the human race. At one
time, it was thought to develop gradually. But later research indicated
that it may be present at birth (Kinsbourne and Hiscock 1987). Even
foetuses have been claimed to show traces of it, with some areas of
the left hemisphere being bigger than the right (Buffery 1978). The
issue is an important one for psycholinguists, since it has sometimes
been argued that the period of lateralization coincides with a ‘critical
period’ for language acquisition (to be discussed in Chapter 4).
Although most neurologists agree that language is mainly restricted
to one hemisphere, further localization of speech is still controversial.
A basic difﬁculty is that until recently all the evidence available was
derived from brain-damaged patients. And injured brains may not 
be representative of normal ones. After a stroke or other injury the
damage is rarely localized. A wound usually creates a blockage, causing

a shortage of blood in the area beyond it, and a build-up of pressure
behind it. So detailed correlations of wounds with speech defects
cannot often be made, especially as a wound in one place may trigger
off severe speech problems in one person, but only marginally affect
the speech of another. This suggests to some neurologists that speech
can be ‘re-located’ away from the damaged area – it has (controversially)
been suggested that there are ‘reserve’ speech areas which are kept
for use in emergencies. This creates an extremely complex picture.
Like a ghost, speech drifts away to another area just as you think you
have located it. But these problems have not deterred neurologists –
and some progress has been made.
Until fairly recently, observation and experiment were the two 
main methods of investigation. Observation depended on unfortunate
accidents and post-mortems. A man called Phineas Gage had an accident
in 1847 in which a four-foot (over a metre long) iron bar struck and
entered the front left-hand section of his head, then exited through
the top. Gage kept the bar as a souvenir, until his death, twenty years
later. The bar and skull are now preserved in a museum at the Harvard
Medical School. Although Gage’s personality changed for the worse
– he became unreliable and unpredictable – his language was unaffected.
This suggests that the front part of the brain is not crucially involved
in language. Conversely, a French surgeon named Broca noted at a
post-mortem in 1861 that two patients who had had severe speech
defects (one could only say tan and sacré nom de Dieu) had signiﬁcant
damage to an area just in front of, and slightly above, the left ear –
which suggested that this area, now named ‘Broca’s area’, is important
for speech.
The experimental method was pioneered in the 1950s by two
Canadian surgeons, Penﬁeld and Roberts (1959). They were primarily
concerned with removing abnormally functioning cells from the brains
of epileptics. But before doing this they had to check that they were
not destroying cells involved in speech. So, with the patients fully
conscious, they carefully opened the skull, and applied a minute electric
current to different parts of the exposed brain. Electrical stimulation
of this type normally causes temporary interference. So if the area
which controls leg movement is stimulated, the patient is unable to
move his or her leg. If the area controlling speech production is
involved, the patient is brieﬂy unable to speak.

There are obvious disadvantages in this method. Only the surface
of the brain was examined, and no attempt was made to probe what
was happening at a deeper level. The brain is not normally exposed
to air or electric shocks, so the results may be quite unrepresentative.
But in spite of the problems involved, certain outline facts became
clear long ago.
First of all, it was possible to distinguish the area of the brain which
is involved in the actual articulation of speech. The so-called ‘primary
somatic motor area’ controls all voluntary bodily movements and is
situated just in front of a deep crack or ‘ﬁssure’ running down from
the top of the brain. The control for different parts of the body works
upside down: control of the feet and legs is near the top of the head,
and control of the face and mouth is further down.
The bodily control system in animals works in much the same way
– but there is one major difference. In humans, a disproportionate
amount of space is allotted to the area controlling the hands and mouth.
But the sections of the brain involved in the actual articulation of
speech seem to be partly distinct from those involved in its planning
and comprehension. Where are these planning and comprehension
areas? Experts disagree. Nevertheless, perhaps the majority of neurolo-
gists agree that some areas of the brain are statistically likely to be

involved in speech planning and comprehension. Two areas seem to
be particularly relevant: the neighbourhood of Broca’s area (in front of
and just above the left ear); and the region around and under the left
ear, which is sometimes called Wernicke’s area after the neurologist
who first suggested this area was important for speech (in 1874).
Damage to Wernicke’s area often destroys speech comprehension, and
damage to Broca’s frequently hinders speech production – though this
is something of an over-simpliﬁcation, since serious damage to either
area usually harms all aspects of speech (Mackay et al. 1987).
Particularly puzzling are cases of damage to Broca’s or Wernicke’s
area where the patient suffers no language disorder. Conversely,
someone’s speech may be badly affected by a brain injury, even though
this does not apparently involve the ‘language areas’. There may
simply be more variation in the location of brain areas than in the
position of the heart or liver. A particular function may be:

narrowly localized in an individual in a particular area . . . localized
equally narrowly in another area in another individual, and carried
out in a much larger area . . . in the third. The only constraint
seems to be that core language processes are accomplished in this
area of neocortex.
(Caplan 1988: 248)
A further problem is that neurologists do not necessarily agree on the
exact location of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, though the boundaries
are more contentious than the central regions (Stowe et al. 2005). In
addition there are deeper brain interconnections about which little is
known.
Comparisons with the brains of other primates, incidentally, show
that humans have a disproportionately large area at the front of the
brain, sometimes referred to as the ‘prefrontal cortex’, though it is
unclear how much of this involves language, and how much more
general interconnections.
Luckily, brain scans can now supplement our information. From
the 1970s onward, these have moved forward in leaps and bounds.
First, and prior to ‘proper’ scans was the EEG (electroencephalograph)
which showed the numerous electrical impulses in the brain, and the
general state of alertness of a patient, but was unable to provide precise
mappings. Then came so-called CT or CAT scans, short for ‘X-ray
computed tomography’. The tissues within the brain (and the body)
differ in density, so a tumour (for example) might appear as an extra
dense portion, and these differing densities showed up on the X-rays.
Next PET scans were developed, short for ‘positron emission
tomography’. These recorded blood ﬂow. Blood surges in the brain
when someone uses language, just as extra blood is pumped into the
arms and hands when someone plays the piano. Radioactive water
was injected into a vein in the arm. In just over a minute, the water
accumulated in the brain, and could show an image of the blood ﬂow
in progressively more difﬁcult tasks. In one experiment, subjects were
ﬁrst asked to look at something simple, such as a small cross on a
screen, and the blood ﬂow was measured. Then, some English nouns
were shown or spoken. As a next stage, the subjects were asked to
speak the word they saw or heard. Finally, they were asked to say
out loud a verb suitable to the noun: for example, if they had heard
the word HAMMER, then HIT might be appropriate (Posner and
Raichle 1994).

physical movement. But both Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas became
active when subjects consciously accessed word meaning and chose a
response. In short, comprehension and production cannot be split
apart in the way it was once assumed. In production, selecting a verb
was the most complex task, and involved several areas – though with
practice, the activity grew less, and became more like that of nouns.
So practice not only makes it all easier, but actually changes the way
the brain organizes itself. In another experiment, subjects were presented
with lists of verbs, and asked to provide the past tense. Regular past
tenses such as CLIMBED, WISHED showed different blood ﬂow
patterns from irregular ones such as CAUGHT, HID (Jaeger et al.
1996).
The brain, it appears, relies on tactics similar to those used by a
sprinter’s muscles, with an increase in oxygen in any area where neurons
show extra activity – though a basic problem is the tremendous amount
happening at any one moment. Pinpointing only the activity relevant
to speech is difﬁcult, especially as deeper connections are turning out
to be as important as those near the surface. However, techniques are
improving all the time. These enable the ebb and ﬂow in blood vessels
to be monitored continuously.
More recently, attention has been directed particularly towards ERPs
‘event related potentials’, and MRI ‘magnetic resonance imaging’.
These techniques are non-invasive, in that nothing needs to be injected
into the body, which can simply be scanned. They are therefore
potentially safer, and can be used with a wider range of people.
ERPs monitor electrical activity in the brain, following some stimulus
(an ‘event’) such as reading a sentence. Electrodes are placed on the
scalp, and the reaction, the ERP (‘event related potential’) is measured.
The brain responds differently to syntactic and semantic ill-formedness,
for example, showing that a division between the two has some type
of ‘reality’ for speakers of English (Kutas and van Petten 1994).
MRI (‘magnetic resonance imaging’) exploits the ﬁnding that human
heads and bodies contain hydrogen atoms which can be (temporarily
and safely) re-aligned by means of the MRI machine’s magnetic ﬁeld.
Images of the brain are produced by taking photos of cross-sectional
‘slices’. These are far clearer and more precise than any previous
attempts at picturing the brain. They conﬁrm that a huge amount of
activity takes place continuously.
The brain is therefore like an ever-bubbling cauldron, seething
non-stop. Neurons are organized into complex networks: ‘The language
areas may be understood as zones in which neurons participating in
language-related cell assemblies cluster to a much higher degree than

in other areas’ (Müller 1996: 629). But connections matter quite as
much as locations, with far more buzzing between areas than was
previously realized. So connectionism is the general name for this type
of theory about how the mind works, largely inspired by all this work
on the brain. Multiple parallel links are turning out to be the norm
in any mental activity, and especially in language. ‘Mental operations
appear to be localized, but performance of a complex task requires an
integrated ensemble of brain regions’ (Fiez et al. 1992: 169).
Patting one’s head and rubbing the stomach
As all this new work conﬁrms, a type of biological adaptation which
is not so immediately obvious – but which is on second sight quite
amazing – is the ‘multiplicity of integrative processes’ (Lashley 1951)
which take place in speech production and comprehension.
In some areas of activity it is extremely difﬁcult to do more than
one thing at once. As schoolchildren discover, it is extraordinarily hard
to pat one’s head and rub one’s stomach at the same time. If you also
try to swing your tongue from side to side, and cross and uncross your
legs, as well as patting your head and rubbing your stomach, the whole
exercise becomes impossible. The occasional juggler might be able to
balance a beer bottle on his nose, twizzle a hoop on his ankle and
keep seven plates aloft with his hands – but he is likely to have spent
a lifetime practising such antics. And the exceptional nature of these
activities is shown by the fact that he can earn vast sums of money
displaying his skills.
Yet speech depends on the simultaneous integration of a remarkable
number of processes, and in many respects what is going on is con-
siderably more complex than the juggler’s manoeuvres with his beer
bottle, plates and hoop.
In speech, three processes, at the very least, are taking place
simultaneously: ﬁrst, sounds are actually being uttered; second, phrases
are being activated in their phonetic form ready for use; third, the
rest of the sentence is being planned. And each of these processes is
possibly more complicated than appears at ﬁrst sight. The complexities
involved in actually pronouncing words are not immediately apparent.
One might assume that in uttering a word such as GEESE one ﬁrst
utters a G-sound, then an EE-sound, then an S–sound in that order.
But the process is much more involved.
First, the G-sound in GEESE differs quite considerably from the G
in GOOSE. This is because of the difference in the following vowel.
The speaker appears to anticipate (subconsciously) the EE or OO and

alter the G accordingly. Second, the vowel in GEESE is shorter than
in a word such as GEEZER. The speaker is anticipating the voiceless
hissing sound of S in GOOSE rather than the voiced, buzzing sound
of Z in GEEZER, since in English (and some other languages) vowels
are shortened before voiceless sounds (sounds which do not involve
vibration of the vocal cords).
Therefore a speaker does not just utter a sequence of separate
elements:
1
2
3
G.
EE.
SE.
Instead he executes a series of overlapping actions in which the
preceding sound is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the sound which follows
it:
G . . .
EE . . .
SE . . .

Such overlapping requires considerable neuromuscular co-ordination,
particularly as the rate of speech is often quite fast. A normal person
often utters over 200 syllables a minute. Meanwhile, simultaneously
with actually uttering the sounds, a speaker is activating phrases of
two or three words in advance in their phonetic form. This is shown
by slips of the tongue, in which a sound several words away is some-
times accidentally activated before it is needed. The linguist who once
said PISS AND STRETCH in a lecture for ‘pitch and stress’ was
already thinking of the ﬁnal -SS of ‘stress’ when he started to say the
first word. And the person who said ON THE NERVE OF A
VERGEOUS BREAKDOWN had also activated the syllable ‘nerve’
before she needed it.
If humans only spoke in three or four word bursts, perhaps the
prior activation of phrases would not be very surprising. What is
surprising is that this activation is going on at the same time as the
planning of much longer utterances. Lenneberg (1967: 107) likens the
planning of an utterance to laying down a mosaic:
The sequence of speech sounds that constitute a string of words
is a sound pattern somewhat analogous to a mosaic; the latter is
put together stone after stone, yet the picture as a whole must
have come into being in the artist’s mind before he began to lay
down the pieces.
Sometimes, sentences are structurally quite easy to process as in
THE BABY FELL DOWNSTAIRS, THE CAT WAS SICK, AND
I’VE RESIGNED. At other times they are considerably more complex,
requiring the speaker and the hearer to remember quite intricate inter-
dependencies between clauses. Take the sentence IF EITHER THE
BABY FALLS DOWNSTAIRS OR THE CAT IS SICK, THEN I
SHALL EITHER RESIGN OR GO MAD. Here, IF requires a
dependent THEN, EITHER requires a partner OR. In addition,
FALLS must have the right ending to go with BABY, and IS must
‘agree’ with CAT – otherwise we would get *IF EITHER THE BABY

FALL DOWNSTAIRS OR THE CAT ARE SICK . . . This whole
sentence with its ‘mirror-image’ properties must have been planned
considerably in advance.
These examples show that in most human utterances, the amount
of simultaneous planning and activity is so great that it seems likely
that humans are specially constructed to deal with this type of co-
ordination. But what type of mechanism is involved? In particular,
how do humans manage to keep utterances in the right order, and
not utter them in an incoherent jumble, as they think of them? How
do most people manage to say RABBIT quite coherently, instead of
BARIT or TIRAB – examples of misordering found in the speech
of brain-damaged patients?
Lenneberg (1967) suggests that correct sequencing is based on an
underlying rhythmic principle. Everybody knows that poetry is much
easier to remember than prose because of the underlying ‘pulse’ which
keeps going like the ticking of a clock:
I WANDERED LONELY AS A CLOUD
(ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum)
THAT FLOATS ON HIGH O’ER VALES AND HILLS
(ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum)
Wordsworth
There may be some underlying biological ‘beat’ which enables
humans to organize language into a temporal sequence. Breakdown
of this beat might also account for the uncontrollable acceleration of
speech found in some illnesses such as Parkinson’s disease. Lenneberg
suggests that one-sixth of a second may be a basic time unit in speech
production. He bases his proposals on a number of highly technical

experiments, and partly on the fact that around six syllables per second
seems to be the normal rate of uttering syllables. However, some
people have queried the notion of a ﬁxed ‘pace-maker’, and suggested
that the internal beat can be re-set at different speeds (Keele 1987).
This may be correct, since with practice speech can be speeded up,
though the relative length of the various words remains the same
(Mackay 1987).
Intelligence, sex and heredity
Can studies of the brain clarify how language relates to intelligence?
A bit, but not very much. Intelligence is a complex fabric of interwoven
skills. Exactly where (if anywhere) each is located is highly controversial.
The most we can say is that certain aspects of intelligence, such as
judgements of space and time, are largely independent of language.
Sufferers of a strange disorder known as Williams Syndrome lack
spatial awareness, and ﬁnd it hard to draw a picture of an elephant or
a bicycle. Instead, they draw bits and pieces which they cannot assemble.
In contrast, their speech is ﬂuent: ‘What would you do if you were
a bird?’ one sufferer was asked. ‘I would ﬂy where my parents could
never ﬁnd me. Birds want to be independent’ was the answer (Bellugi,
et al. 1991: 387).
Sex differences in the brain are also important for language. Women,
on average, have greater verbal ﬂuency, and can more easily ﬁnd
words that begin with a particular letter. Men are better at spatial tasks
and mathematical reasoning. These variations probably reﬂect different
hormonal inﬂuences on developing brains (Kimura 1992).
Heredity is another topical issue (Gopnik 1997; Stromswolo 2001;
Fisher 2006). Can language defects be handed down from generation
to generation? Dyslexia, or ‘word blindness’, often runs in families.
So does another puzzling language problem. Several families have been
found of whom a proportion of their members cannot put endings
on words, the most famous of whom are known as the ‘KE family’
(Gopnik 1994; Gopnik et al. 1997). ZACKO was given as the plural
of the nonsense word ZAT by one sufferer, and ZOOPES as the
plural of the nonsense word ZOOP. Those affected have to learn
each plural separately, and they ﬁnd it impossible to learn a general
rule such as ‘Add-S’. They also ﬁnd it hard to use pronouns, and tend
to repeat full nouns, as: ‘The neighbours phone the ambulance because
the man fall off the tree. The ambulance come along and put the man
into the ambulance’ (Gopnik and Crago 1991). At ﬁrst, optimistic
researchers hoped that they had found a gene for language, and even

provisionally labelled it the SPCH1 gene. Later, it was realized that
the affected members in the KE family (and some other families) had
a cluster of language problems, as well as some non-linguistic ones.
The defective gene, eventually labelled FOXP2, is still being investi-
gated by researchers, and the details are proving complex (Lal et al.
2001). As well as difficulties with inflections, the affected family
members are unable to break down words into their constituent sounds,
and they also have problems with the sequencing of mouth movements.
Mind-reading and mirror neurons
As researchers puzzle over exactly why humans are such competent
language users, new ﬁndings have emerged, which may turn out to
be of vital importance. Humans have an ability to ‘mind-read’, to put
themselves into another person’s shoes, as it were, and envisage their
mental state (p. 35). Mind-reading is an awareness that develops with
age: 3-year-olds are typically unable to achieve it, but 4-year-olds can
normally do so without difﬁculty. This trait is lacking in those who
suffer from the mental disorder of autism, a condition some-
times known as ‘mindblindness’ (Baron-Cohen 1999; Ramachandran
and Oberman 2006). There seem to be layers of mind-blindness.
Chimps have some inkling of mind-reading (Chapter 2), though not
the same level of awareness as normal humans. This has led researchers
to probe into the neurological background behind this ability
An intriguing discovery is that of so-called ‘mirror neurons’, which
according to some researchers, may underlie the ability to understand
another person’s intentions, and also the ability to imitate. Mirror
neurons have been found both in humans and monkeys. An Italian
neuroscientist, Giacomo Rizzolatti, is credited with their discovery
(Rizzolatti and Arbib 1998). He noticed that a section of the frontal
lobe of a monkey’s brain ﬁred when it performed certain actions, such
as reaching for an object or putting food in its mouth. But bizarrely,
the same neurons would fire when it watched another monkey
performing the same actions. Rizzolatti labelled these ‘mirror neurons’
and speculated that he may have identiﬁed the neurological basis of
mind-reading. Later work has emphasized the importance of mirror
neurons in imitation, a skill at which humans seem to be better than
apes, and may be crucial in language learning. (Rizzolatti et al. 2006),
and also their possible role in the evolution of language (Stamenov
2002).
We do not yet know all the details, but the overall picture is clear.
Humans are physically adapted to language in a way that snails, sheep

and even apes are not. Their vocal organs, lungs and brains are ‘pre-
set’ to cope with the intricacies of speech in much the same way that
monkeys are pre-set to climb trees, or bats to squeak. Chapter 4 gives
further evidence of this biological programming by showing that
language follows an inner ‘time-clock’ as it emerges and develops.

Predestinate grooves
Is there a pre-ordained language
‘programme’?
There once was a man who said, ‘Damn!’
It is born in upon me I am 
An engine that moves 
In predestinate grooves, 
I’m not even a bus, I’m a tram.
Maurice Evan Hare
Language emerges at about the same time in children all over the
world. ‘Why do children normally begin to speak between their
eighteenth and twenty-eighth month?’ asks one researcher:
Surely it is not because all mothers on earth initiate language
training at that time. There is, in fact, no evidence that any
conscious and systematic teaching of language takes place, just as
there is no special training for stance or gait.
(Lenneberg 1967: 125).
This regularity of onset suggests that language may be set in motion
by a biological clock, similar to the one which causes kittens to open
their eyes when they are a few days old, chrysalises to change into
butterﬂies after several weeks, and humans to become sexually mature
at around 13 years of age. However, until relatively recently, few
people had considered language within the framework of biological
maturation. But in 1967 Eric Lenneberg, then a biologist at the Harvard
Medical School, published an important book, entitled The Biological
Foundations of Language. Much of what is said in this chapter is based
on his pioneering work.

The characteristics of biologically triggered
behaviour
Behaviour that is triggered off biologically has a number of special
characteristics. In the following pages we shall list these features, and
see to what extent they are present in language. If it can be shown
that speech, like sexual activities and the ability to walk, falls into the
category of biologically scheduled behaviour, then we shall be rather
clearer about what is meant by the claim that language is ‘innate’.
Exactly how many ‘hallmarks’ of biologically controlled behaviour
we should itemize is not clear. Lenneberg lists four. The six listed
below were obtained mainly by subdividing Lenneberg’s four:
1
The behaviour emerges before it is necessary.
2
Its appearance is not the result of a conscious decision.
3
Its emergence is not triggered by external events (though the
surrounding environment must be sufficiently ‘rich’ for it to develop
adequately).
4
Direct teaching and intensive practice have relatively little effect.
5
There is a regular sequence of ‘milestones’ as the behaviour develops,
and these can usually be correlated with age and other aspects of
development.
6
There may be a ‘critical period’ for the acquisition of the behaviour.
Let us discuss these features in turn. Some of them seem fairly
obvious. We hardly need to set about testing the ﬁrst one, that ‘the
behaviour emerges before it is necessary’ – a phenomenon sometimes
pompously labelled the ‘law of anticipatory maturation’. Language
develops long before children need to communicate in order to survive.
Their parents still feed them, clothe them and look after them. Without
some type of inborn mechanism, language might develop only when
parents left children to fend for themselves. It would emerge at different
times in different cultures, and this would lead to vastly different levels
of language skills. Although children differ enormously in their ability
to knit or play the violin, their language proﬁciency varies to a much
lesser extent.
Again, little explanation is needed for the second characteristic of
biologically triggered behaviour: ‘Its appearance is not the result of a
conscious decision.’ Clearly, a child does not suddenly think to herself,
‘Tomorrow I am going to start to learn to talk.’ Children acquire
language without making any conscious decision about it. This is quite
unlike a decision to learn to jump a 4-foot height, or hit a tennis ball,

when a child sets herself a target, then organizes strenuous practice
sessions as she strives towards her goal.
The ﬁrst part of feature (3) also seems straightforward: ‘The emer-
gence of the behaviour is not triggered by external events.’ Children
begin to talk even when their surroundings remain unchanged. Most
of them live in the same house, eat the same food, have the same
parents, and follow the same routine. No speciﬁc event or feature in
their surroundings suddenly starts them off talking. An inner biological
clock is ticking away, set for the right time.
We know for certain that language cannot emerge before it is
programmed to emerge. Nobody has ever made a young baby talk –
though it seems that there is nothing much wrong with the vocal cords
of a newborn infant, and from 5 or 6 months onwards it can ‘babble’
a number of the sounds needed in speech. Yet children utter few 
words before the age of 18 months. They have to wait for some bio-
logical trigger. The ‘trigger’ appears to be connected with brain growth.
Two-word utterances, which are usually regarded as the beginning of
‘true language’, begin just as a massive spurt in brain growth slows
down. Children do not manufacture any new brain cells after birth.
They are born with millions, perhaps billions. At ﬁrst the cells are not
all interconnected, and the brain is relatively light (about 300g). From
birth to around 2 years, many more cells interconnect, and brain weight
increases rapidly. By the age of 2, it weighs nearly 1000g (Lenneberg
1967).
However, there is one aspect of biologically scheduled behaviour
that is sometimes misunderstood: although no external event causes 
the behaviour, the surrounding environment must be sufﬁciently ‘rich’
for it to develop adequately. Biologically programmed behaviour 
does not develop properly in impoverished or unnatural surroundings.
We have the apparent paradox that some types of ‘natural’ behaviour
require careful ‘nurturing’. Just as Chris and Susie, two gorillas reared
away from other gorillas in Sacramento Zoo, were unable to mate
satisfactorily, according to an item in the London Evening Standard –
so an impoverished linguistic environment is likely to retard language
acquisition. Children brought up in institutions, for example, tend to
be backward in speech development. Lenneberg noted that children
raised in an orphanage will begin to talk at the same time as other
non-institutionalized children. But their speech will gradually lag behind
the norm, being less intelligible, and showing less variety of construc-
tion. A less obvious example of linguistic impoverishment was suggested
by Basil Bernstein, then a sociologist at London University’s Institute
of Education. He claimed controversially that children from certain

types of family may be language deprived (Bernstein 1972). They may
be unable to learn language adequately because they do not have
sufﬁcient data at their disposal. He claimed that such families use
informal and elliptical speech, in contrast to the more formal and
explicit language of households where children learn more quickly.
For example, ‘Hop it’ in one family may correspond to ‘Go outside
and play, and stop worrying me, I’m busy’ in another. As one man
described it:
The words may be limited in number . . . there is a perpetual
exchange of pebbled phrases: ‘Ah well, some folk are like that;
she’s nowt but mutton dressed as lamb.’ For most of what is said
is not said by words but by tone of voice, by silences, by look,
gesture and most keenly by touching.
The same man describes the cultural shock of school, where he was
faced with ‘an unending rush of words, multitudinous, fresh, and
ordered in different ways’ (Brian Jackson in the Daily Telegraph colour
supplement). Children seem to need this ‘unending rush of words’,
and those who are deprived of it may lag behind in their development.
Luckily the problem is usually only temporary. Language-impoverished
children tend to catch up quickly once their verbal environment is
enriched: the biological factor takes over as soon as the environment
enables it to do so.
In fact, relatively few children are truly deprived, according to more
recent research. In many cases, the supposedly ‘language impoverished’
children were just puzzled for a time when they were exposed to a
dialect or accent unlike their own.
Let us now turn to the fourth characteristic of biologically triggered
behaviour, ‘Direct teaching and intensive practice have relatively 
little effect.’ In activities such as typing or playing tennis, a person’s
achievement is often directly related to the amount of teaching they
receive and the hours of practice they put in. Even people who are
not ‘naturally’ superb athletes can sometimes win tennis tournaments
through sheer hard work and good coaching. But the same is not true
of language, where direct teaching seems to be a failure. Let us consider
the evidence for this.
When one says that ‘direct teaching is a failure’, people smile and
say, ‘Of course – whoever tries to teach a child to speak?’ Yet many
parents, often without realizing it, try to persuade their children to
imitate them. They do this in two ways: ﬁrst, by means of overt correc-
tion, second, by means of unconscious ‘expansions’.

Overt correction is not necessarily successful. One psychologist
attempted over a period of several weeks to persuade his daughter to
say OTHER + noun instead of OTHER ONE + noun. The inter-
changes went somewhat as follows:
Child:
WANT OTHER ONE SPOON, DADDY.
Father: YOU MEAN, YOU WANT THE OTHER SPOON.
Child:
YES, I WANT OTHER ONE SPOON, PLEASE
DADDY.
Father: CAN YOU SAY ‘THE OTHER SPOON’?
Child:
OTHER . . . ONE . . . SPOON.
Father: SAY ‘OTHER’.
Child:
OTHER.
Father: ‘SPOON’.
Child:
SPOON.
Father: ‘OTHER SPOON’.
Child:
OTHER . . . SPOON. NOW GIVE ME OTHER ONE
SPOON?
(Braine 1971: 161)
Another researcher tried vainly to coax a child into saying the past
tense form HELD:
Child:
MY TEACHER HOLDED THE BABY RABBITS
AND WE PATTED THEM
Adult:
DID YOU SAY YOUR TEACHER HELD THE BABY
RABBITS?
Child:
YES.
Adult:
WHAT DID YOU SAY SHE DID?
Child:
SHE HOLDED THE BABY RABBITS AND WE
PATTED THEM.
Adult:
DID YOU SAY SHE HELD THEM TIGHTLY?
Child:
NO, SHE HOLDED THEM LOOSELY.
(Cazden 1972: 92)
So forcing children to imitate is likely to be a dismal failure. Children
cannot be trained like parrots. And repeated nagging corrections may
even hinder a child’s progress. The mother of 17-month-old Paul had
high expectations, and repeatedly corrected his attempts at speech. He
lacked conﬁdence, and his progress was slow. But the mother of 14-
month-old Jane was an accepting person who responded uncritically
to everything Jane said. Jane made exceptionally fast progress, and
knew eighty words by the age of 15 months (Nelson 1973: 105).

Yet the matter is not quite as simple as at ﬁrst sight. The now
famous ‘other one spoon’ and ‘holded the baby rabbits’ dialogues 
show that corrections are unhelpful if the child’s attention is at the
time focused strongly on matters other than the language. Later work
has shown that kindly made corrections from a sensitive caregiver 
can enable a child to learn language faster. This will be discussed in
Chapter 7.
Equally unsuccessful is the second type of coaching often uncon-
sciously adopted by parents – the use of ‘expansions’. When talking
to a child an adult continuously ‘expands’ the youngster’s utterances.
If the child says, THERE GO ONE, a mother is likely to expand
this to ‘Yes, there goes one.’ MOMMY EGGNOG becomes ‘Mommy
had her eggnog’, and THROW DADDY is expanded to ‘Throw it
to Daddy.’ Children are exposed to an enormous number of these
expansions. They account for perhaps a third of parental responses.
Two researchers note:
The mothers of Adam and Eve responded to the speech of their
children with expansions about 30 per cent of the time. We did
it ourselves when we talked with the children. Indeed, we found
it very difﬁcult to withhold expansions. A reduced or incomplete
English sentence seems to constrain the English-speaking adult to
expand it into the nearest properly formed complete sentence.
(Brown and Bellugi 1964: 144)
At ﬁrst researchers were uncertain about the role of expansions.
Then Courtney Cazden carried out an ingenious experiment using
two groups of children, all under 31⁄2 (Cazden 1972). She exposed one
group to intensive and deliberate expansions, and the other group to
well-formed sentences which were not expansions. For example, if a
child said, DOG BARK, an expanding adult would say, ‘Yes, the dog
is barking.’ An adult who replied with a nonexpanded sentence might
say ‘Yes, he’s trying to frighten the cat’ or ‘Yes, but he won’t bite’,
or ‘Yes, tell him to be quiet.’ After 3 months the rate of progress of
each group was measured. Amazingly, the expansion group were less
advanced than the other group, both in average length of utterance
and grammatical complexity.
Several explanations of this unexpected result have been put forward.
Perhaps adults misinterpret the child’s intended meaning when they
expand. Erroneous expansions could hinder his learning. Several
‘wrong’ expansions have been noted. For example:

Child:
WHAT TIME IT IS?
Adult:
UH HUH, IT TELLS WHAT TIME IT IS.
Alternatively, a certain degree of novelty may be needed in order to
capture children’s attention, since they may not listen to apparent
repetitions of their own utterances. Or it may be that expansions over-
restrict the data children hear. Their speech may be impoverished
because of an insufﬁciently rich verbal environment. As we noted
earlier, a child needs copious and varied samples of speech.
The last two explanations seem to be supported by a Russian
experiment (Slobin 1966a: 144). One group of infants was shown a
doll, and three phrases were repeatedly uttered, ‘Here is a doll . . .
Take the doll . . . Give me the doll.’ Another group of infants was
shown the doll, but instead, thirty different phrases were uttered, such
as ‘Rock the doll . . . Look for the doll.’ The total number of words
heard by both groups was the same, only the composition differed.
Then the experimenters showed the children a selection of toys, and
asked them to pick out the dolls. To their surprise, the children in
the second group, the ones who had heard a richer variety of speech,
were considerably better at this task.
We may conclude then that parents who consciously try to ‘coach’
their children by simplifying and repeating may be actually interfering
with their progress. It does not pay to talk to children as if one was
telling a foreign tourist how to get to the zoo. Language that is
impoverished is harder to learn, not simpler. Children appear to be
naturally ‘set’ to extract a grammar for themselves, provided they have
sufﬁcient data at their disposal. Those who get on best are those who
are exposed to a rich variety of language – in other words, those
whose parents talk to them in a normal way.
But what does ‘talk in a normal way’ mean? Here we need to clear
up a misunderstanding which seems to have originated with Chomsky.
He has claimed that what children hear ‘consists to a large extent of
utterances that break rules, since a good deal of normal speech consists
of false starts, disconnected phrases and other deviations’ (Chomsky
1967: 441). Certainly, children are likely to hear some deviant sentences.
But later research indicated that the speech children are exposed to
is not particularly substandard. Adults tend to speak in shorter sentences
and make fewer mistakes when they address children. There is a consid-
erable difference between the way a mother talks to another adult,
and the way she talks to her child. One researcher recorded a mother
talking to an adult friend. Her sentences were on average fourteen to
ﬁfteen words long, and she used several polysyllabic medical terms:

‘I was on a inhalation series routine. We wen’ aroun’ from ward to
ward. People, are, y’know, that get all this mucus in their chest, and
it’s very important to breathe properly an’ to be able to cough this
mucus up and out an’ through your chest, y’know as soon as possible.
And we couldn’t sterilize the instruments ’cause they were plastic.’
But when she spoke to her child the same mother used ﬁve-or six-
word sentences. The words were shorter, and referred to things the
child could see or do:
COME LOOK AT MOMMA’S COLORIN’ BOOK.
YOU WANNA SEE MY COLORING BOOK?
LOOK AT MY COLORING BOOK.
LOOKIT, THAT’S AN INDIAN, HUH?
IS THAT AN INDIAN?
CAN YOU SAY INDIAN?
TALK TO ME.
(Drach, quoted in Ervin Tripp – 1971)
Most parents automatically simplify both the content and syntax
when they talk to children. This is not particularly surprising – after
all, we do not address bus conductors and boyfriends in the same way.
The use of language appropriate to the circumstances is a normal part
of a human’s language ability.
Speech to children in different cultures is so similar that it might
even ‘have an innate basis in pan-human child-care behavior’ according
to the controversial claim of one researcher (Ferguson 1978: 215).
‘Motherese’, as it is sometimes called, tends to consist of short, well-
formed sentences spoken slowly and clearly. We shall discuss the
relationship between the structure of adult speech and children’s progress
in Chapter 7. Here we have simply pointed out that direct teaching
does not accelerate the speed of learning and might even be a hindrance.
But this is perhaps an over-simpliﬁcation. Correction can help, if
the young learner is currently thinking through the problem corrected.
Youngsters ‘tune in’ to different aspects of their language as they
progress. If a child is tussling with so-called ‘reﬂexives’, and its parents
are sensitive enough to notice this, then correction may be worthwhile,
as in the following dialogue:
Child:
HE WIPED HIM
Adult:
HE WIPED HIMSELF
Child:
YES, HE WIPED HIMSELF
(Saxton 2000: 229)

In short, correction which ties in with a child’s linguistic level may
be more useful than was once assumed.
Let us now return to the question of practice. What is being claimed
here is that practice alone cannot account for language acquisition.
Children do not learn language simply by repetition and imitation.
Two types of evidence support this view.
The ﬁrst concerns the development of ‘inﬂections’ or word endings.
English has a number of very common verbs which have an ‘irregular’
past tense form (e.g. CAME, SAW, WENT) as opposed to the ‘regular’
forms such as LOVED, WORKED, PLAYED. It also has a number
of irregular plurals such as FEET and MICE, as well as the far more
numerous plurals ending in -S such as CATS, GIRAFFES and
PYTHONS. Quite early on, children learn correct past tense and plural
forms for common words such as CAME, SAW and FEET. Later, they
abandon these correct forms and replace them with over-generalized
‘regular’ forms such as COMED, SEED and FOOTS (Ervin 1964).
The signiﬁcance of this apparent regression is immense. It means that
language acquisition cannot possibly be a straightforward case of ‘practice
makes perfect’ or of simple imitation. If it were, children would never
replace common forms such as CAME and SAW, which they hear and
use all the time, with odd forms such as COMED, SEED and FOOTS,
which they are unlikely to have come across.
The second type of practice which turns out to be unimportant for
language acquisition is spontaneous imitation. Just as adults sub-
consciously imitate and expand their children’s utterances, so children
appear to imitate and ‘reduce’ sentences uttered by their parents. If
an adult says ‘I shall take an umbrella’, a child is likely to say TAKE
’RELLA. Or ‘Put the strap under her chin’ is likely to be repeated
and reduced to STRAP CHIN. At ﬁrst sight, it looks as if this might
be an important mechanism in the development of language. But Susan
Ervin of the University of California at Berkeley came to the opposite
conclusion when she recorded the spontaneous utterances of a small
group of toddlers (Ervin 1964). To her surprise she found that when
a child spontaneously imitates an adult, her imitations are not any
more advanced than her normal speech. She shortens the adult utterance
to ﬁt in with her current average length of sentence and includes the
same number of endings and ‘little’ words as in her non-imitated
utterances. Not a single child produced imitations which were more
advanced. And one child, Holly, actually produced imitations that
were less complex than her spontaneous sentences!
We may conclude, then, that mere practice – in the sense of direct
repetition and imitation – does not affect the acquisition of language

in a signiﬁcant way. However, we must be careful that such a statement
does not lead to misunderstandings. What is being said is that practice
alone cannot account for language acquisition: children do not learn
merely by constant repetition of items. In another sense, they do need
to ‘practise’ talking but even this requirement is not as extensive as
might be expected. They can learn a surprising amount by just listening.
The amount of talking a child needs to do in order to learn language
varies considerably. Some children seem to speak very little. Others
are constantly chattering, and playing with words. One researcher
wrote a whole book on the pre-sleep monologues of her ﬁrst child
Anthony, who murmured paradigms to himself as he prepared for
sleep:
GO FOR GLASSES
GO FOR THEM
GO TO THE TOP
GO THROW
GO FOR BLOUSE
PANTS
GO FOR SHOES
(Weir 1962)
To her disappointment, her second child David was nowhere near as
talkative although he eventually learned to speak just as well. These
repetitious murmurs do not seem to be essential. Children vary
enormously in the amount of ‘language drills’ they engage in (Kuczaj
II 1983).
So far, then, we have considered four of the six characteristics of
biologically triggered behaviour which were listed at the beginning
of this chapter. All these features seem to be present in language. 
We now come to the ﬁfth feature, ‘There is a regular sequence of
“milestones” as the behaviour develops, and these can usually be
correlated with age and other aspects of development.’ We shall deal
with this in a section by itself.
The pre-ordained programme
All children seem to pass through a series of similar ‘stages’ as they
acquire language. The age at which different children reach each stage
or ‘milestone’ varies considerably, but the relative chronology remains
the same. The milestones are normally reached in the same order,

though they may be nearer together for some children and farther
apart for others.
Consequently, we can divide language development into a number
of approximate phases. The chart below is highly over-simpliﬁed. The
stages overlap, and the ages given are only a very rough guide – but
it does give some idea of a child’s likely progress.

In order to illustrate this progression we shall describe the successive
phases which a typical (and non-existent) English child is likely to go
through as she learns to speak. Let us call this child Barbara – a name
derived from the Greek word for ‘foreigner’ and meaning literally
‘someone who says bar-bar, who talks gibberish’.
Barbara’s ﬁrst recognizable vocal activity was crying. ‘The newborn
baby comes into the world crying. Unless interrupted by sickness, the
production of sounds is constant in human beings, from the ﬁrst cry
to the last breath’ (Boysson-Bardies 1999: 37). During the ﬁrst four
weeks of her life, Barbara was truly:
An infant crying in the night:
An infant crying for the light:
And with no language but a cry.
Tennyson
A number of different types of cry could be detected. She cried with
hunger when she wanted to be fed. She cried with pain when she
had a tummy ache, and she cried with pleasure when she was fed,
comfortable and lying in her mother’s arms. However, strictly speaking,

it is perhaps inaccurate to speak of crying as a ‘language phase’, because
crying seems to be instinctive communication and may be more like
an animal call system than a true language. Babies’ pain cries are
distinguishable from hunger cries everywhere in the world (Lester and
Boukydis 1991). So although crying may help to strengthen the lungs
and vocal cords (both of which are needed for speech), crying itself
perhaps should not be regarded as part of true language development.
Barbara then passed through two reasonably distinct pre-language
phases, a cooing phase and a babbling phase. Early researchers confused
these stages and sometimes likened them to birdsong. The nineteenth-
century scholar Hippolyte Taine noted of his daughter:
She takes delight in her twitter like a bird, she seems to smile
with joy over it, but as yet it is only the twittering of a bird for
she attaches no meaning to the sounds she utters.
(Taine 1877, in Bar-Adon and Leopold 1971: 21)
The first of these two phases, cooing, began when Barbara was
approximately 6 weeks old. To a casual observer, she sounded as if
she was saying GOO GOO. But cooing is difﬁcult to describe. Some
textbooks call it ‘gurgling’ or ‘mewing’. The sound is superﬁcially
vowel-like, but the tracings produced on a sound spectrogram show
that it is quite unlike the vowels produced by adults. Cooing seems
to be universal. It may be the vocal equivalent of arm and leg waving.
That is, just as babies automatically strengthen their muscles by kicking
their legs and moving their arms about, so cooing may help them to
gain control over their vocal apparatus.
Gradually, consonant-type sounds become interspersed in the cooing.
By around 6 months, Barbara had reached the babbling stage. She gave
the impression of uttering consonants and vowels together, at ﬁrst as
single syllables – but later strung together. The consonants were often
made with the lips, or the teeth, so that the sequences sounded like
MAMA, DIDIDI, or PAPAPA. On hearing these sounds, Barbara’s
parents conﬁdently but wrongly assumed that she was addressing them.
Such wishful thinking accounts for the fact that MAMA, PAPA and
DADA are found as nursery words for mother and father all over the
world (Jakobson 1962). Barbara soon learned that a cry of MAMA
meant immediate attention – though she often used it to mean ‘I am
hungry’ rather than to refer to a parent. This phenomenon has been
noted by numerous researchers. Charles Darwin, for example, remarked
that at the age of 1 year his son ‘made the great step forward of
inventing a word for food, namely, mum but what led him to it I did

not discover’ (Darwin 1877, in Bar-Adon and Leopold 1971: 28).
Another investigator observed that his child called MAMA as a request
for a piece of bread being buttered by himself, the father.
Throughout the babbling period Barbara seemed to enjoy experi-
menting with her mouth and tongue. She not only babbled, she blew
bubbles, gurgled and spluttered. Superficially, she appeared to be
uttering an enormous variety of exotic sounds. At one time, researchers
wrongly assumed that children are naturally capable of producing
every possible speech sound. A Canadian psychologist once commented:
During this period, that peculiarly charming infantile babble 
begins, which, though only an ‘awkward twittering’, yet contains
in rudimentary form nearly all the sounds which afterwards, by
combination, yield the potent instrument of speech. A wonderful
variety of sounds, some of which afterwards give the child difﬁculty
when he tries to produce them, are now produced automatically,
by purely impulsive exercise of the vocal muscles.
(Tracy 1909, in Bar-Adon and Leopold 1971: 32)
More recent investigators have noted that the variety of sounds used
in babbling is not particularly great. But because the child does not
yet have complete control over his vocal organs, the noises are often
unlike adult sounds, and seem exotic to an untrained observer. In
general, babbling seems to be a period when a child experiments and
gradually gains muscular control over his vocal organs. Many people
claim that babbling is universal. But there are a few puzzling records
of children who did not babble, which provide problems for this point
of view. All we can say at the moment is that babbling is sufﬁciently
widespread to be regarded as a normal stage of development.
Some investigators have tried to compare babbling babies who have
been exposed to different languages. For example, Chinese babbles
seem to be easily distinguishable from American, Russian and Arabic
ones (Weir 1966). Because Chinese is a language which distinguishes
words by means of a change in ‘tone’ or ‘pitch’, Chinese babies tend
to produce monosyllabic utterances with much tonal variation.
American babies produce polysyllabic babbles with intonation spread
over the whole sequence. The non-tone babies sound superﬁcially
similar – though American mothers could often pick out the American
baby, Russians the Russian baby, and Arabs the Arab baby. But the
mothers could not distinguish between the babies babbling the other
two languages. This research indicates that there may be a ‘babbling
drift’, in which children’s babbling gradually moves in the direction

of the sounds they hear around them. These findings have been
conﬁrmed by several later studies (e.g. Cruttenden 1970; Vihman 
et al. 1985; Vihman 1996; Boysson-Bardies 1999). For example, French
adults can pick out French baby babbles from non-French ones
(Boysson-Bardies et al. 1984). In this respect babbling is clearly distinct
from crying, which has no discernible relationship with any one
language. As one researcher commented:
The voices of children all over the world do, of course, have
much in common; but listening to their babbling and ﬁrst words,
we see that the young language learners have already captured the
characteristic colour and tone of their native languages.
(Boysson-Bardies 1999: 68)
A question which perhaps should be asked at this stage is the
following: how much can children actually distinguish of their parents’
speech? It is sometimes assumed that babies hear merely a general
mish-mash of sound, and only gradually notice details. However, infants
may be capable of discriminating a lot more than we realize. They
seem to be specially pre-set to notice the rhythms and sounds of
speech, and probably begin to ‘tune in’ before birth. French infants
as young as four days old can distinguish French from other languages,
according to one group of researchers (Mehler et al. 1988). They
found this out by giving babies paciﬁers (dummies) to suck. It is well
known that infants suck more strongly when they are aroused and
interested in what they hear. These French newborns sucked at signiﬁ-
cantly higher rates when exposed to French, than to English or Italian.
So they had possibly become acclimatized to the rhythm and intonation
of French while still in the womb.
Using the same sucking technique, other investigators (Eimas et al.
1971; Eimas 1985) had already shown that babies between 1 and 4
months old can distinguish between P and B. The investigators started
by playing a repeated B sound, then they switched to P. The babies
suddenly increased their sucking rate, showing that they had noticed
the alteration. So even though infants may not listen carefully to
everything their parents say, they may well be capable of hearing a
considerable amount from a very young age. Somewhat surprisingly,
these results have been replicated with rhesus monkeys and chinchillas
(Kuhl and Miller 1974, 1975; Morse 1976), and so may be due to the
hearing mechanisms in certain types of mammals, and not just humans
alone. In brief, a child’s perception may be much sharper than had
previously been supposed, even though it may not be equivalent to
an adult’s for some time (Fourcin 1978).

Simultaneously with babbling, and from around 8 or 9 months,
Barbara began to imitate intonation patterns. These made her output
sound so like speech that her mother sometimes said ‘I’m sure she’s
talking, I just can’t catch what she’s saying.’ An eighteenth-century
German researcher observed of this stage: ‘He attempted to imitate
conversations, to which end he produced a profusion of incomprehen-
sible sounds’ (Tiedemann 1782, in Bar-Adon and Leopold 1971: 15).
English mothers have noted that their children often use a ‘question’
intonation, with a rise in tone at the end of the sentence. This may
be due to a normal parent’s tendency to bend over the child, asking,
‘What are you trying to say then?’ ‘Do you want some milk?’ ‘Do
you know who this is?’ and so on.
Somewhere between 1 year and 18 months Barbara began to utter
single words. She continued to babble as well, though her babbling
gradually diminished as true language developed (Stoel-Gammon and
Cooper 1984). The number of single words acquired at around this
time varies from child to child. Some have only four or ﬁve, others
have around ﬁfty. As an average child Barbara acquired about ﬁfteen.
Many of them were names of people and things, such as UF (woof)
‘dog’, DABA ‘grandma’, DA ‘doll’.
Then as she neared her second birthday, she reached the more
impressive two-word stage. From the time Barbara started to put words
together she seemed to be in a state of ‘language readiness’, and mopped
up language like a sponge. The most noticeable feature of this process
was a dramatic increase in her vocabulary. By the time she was 21⁄2
years old, she knew several hundred words. Meanwhile, there was a
gradual but steady increase in her average or mean length of utterance
– usually abbreviated to MLU. MLU is calculated in terms of gram-
matical items or ‘morphemes’: plural -S and past tense -D, for example,
each count as one item and so do ordinary words such as MUMMY
and BATH. Compound words such as BIRTHDAY and QUACK-
QUACK also count as a single item (Brown 1973: 54). Many, but
not all, researchers accept this as a useful gauge of progress – though
the child with the longest utterances does not necessarily have the
most grammatically advanced, or even the most grammatically correct
utterances (Bates et al. 1988; Bennett-Kastor 1988).
The fact that a steady increase in MLU occurs from the age of
around 2 onwards has been shown by Roger Brown of Harvard
University, who carried out a detailed study of the speech development
of three unacquainted children, Adam, Eve and Sarah – though he
found that the chronological age at which different children reached
an MLU stage differed considerably (Brown et al. 1968; Brown 1973).

A comparison of Adam and Eve showed that Eve outstripped Adam
by far. Eve’s MLU was two items at around 20 months, three at 22
months and four at 28 months. Adam was over 26 months old before
he achieved an MLU of two items. He was nearly 3 years old before
his MLU reached three items and 31⁄2 before it reached four items –
a whole year behind Eve.
If we assume that Barbara is not as advanced as Eve, but ahead of
Adam, she possibly had an MLU of two items a little before her
second birthday, an MLU of three items at 21⁄2, and four items around
her third birthday.
In the early part of the two-word stage, when she was around 2
years old, Barbara’s speech was ‘telegraphic’. She sounded as if she
was sending urgent telegrams to her mother: WANT MILK, WHERE
DUCK? As in a real telegram, she tended to preserve the nouns and
verbs in the correct order, but omitted the ‘little’ words such as THE,
A, HAS, HIS, AND. She also left out word endings, such as the plural
-S or past tense -D, as in TWO SHOE and MILK SPILL.
How much do children understand at this time? Most parents
conﬁdently claim that children understand much more language than
they can produce. But dog-owners sometimes make the same assump-
tion about their pets, so how can anyone know for sure? Psychologists
have discovered that children prefer pictures that match what they are
hearing. This has inspired an ingenious experiment. A child is read
out a sentence which corresponds to one of two pictures being shown

on two television screens in front of him (Hirsh-Pasek and Golinkoff
1996). For example, the youngster might be shown a popular TV
character, such as Cookie Monster, one of a family of ‘Muppets’ who
feature in the American children’s programme Sesame Street. Cookie
Monster is a large ﬂuffy creature who is covered in blue fur, has big
bulging eyes and a voracious appetite for chocolate cookies. On one
screen, Cookie Monster would be made to tickle Big Bird, another
character from the same show. On the other screen, Big Bird would
be tickling Cookie Monster. Then a sentence would be played, either
‘Look! Cookie Monster is tickling Big Bird!’ or ‘Look! Big Bird is
tickling Cookie Monster!’ If the child understands the difference
between the sentences, he or she tends to show a preference for the
screen which matches the picture, and the time taken to focus on this
can be measured. Such experiments have confirmed parental and
researchers’ intuitions, that children’s comprehension is normally ahead
of their production.
To return to Barbara, once the two-word stage is ﬁrmly in place,
then, gradually, the ‘little’ words and inﬂections are added. ‘All these,
like an intricate work of ivy, begin to grow up between and upon the
major construction blocks, the nouns and verbs’ (Brown 1973: 249).
In this aspect of language, Barbara is following the same path of
development as the Harvard child Adam, but at a slightly earlier age
(Brown 1973: 271). Between the ages of 2 and 31⁄2, Barbara acquired
the following grammatical forms:
Age 2 
Progressive -ING
I SINGING
Plural -S
BLUE SHOES
Copula AM, IS, ARE
HE IS ASLEEP
Articles A, THE
HE IS A DOCTOR
Age 3 
3rd person singular -S
HE WANTS AN APPLE
Past tense -D
I HELPED MUMMY
Full progressive AM, IS, ARE + -ING
I AM SINGING
Shortened copula
HE’S A DOCTOR
Shortened progressive
I’M SINGING
It is important to distinguish between the emergence, or ﬁrst appearance
of an ending, and its acquisition, its reliable use in the places where an
adult would expect to ﬁnd it. An ending can be considered acquired
if it occurs in at least 90 per cent of the contexts where it is needed
(Brown 1973: 258).

The actual age at which Barbara acquired each form is not signiﬁcant
because it varies widely from child to child. What is important and
interesting is the order of acquisition. The sequence seems surprisingly
similar among English-speaking children. Roger Brown noted that in
the unacquainted Harvard children, the developmental order of these
grammatical forms was ‘amazingly consistent’. There were one or two
minor variations: Sarah, for example, acquired the progressive -ING
after the plural, whereas Adam and Eve acquired it before. But in all
the children, both the progressive -ING and the plural -S occurred
before the past tense, the third person singular -S, and the copula AM,
IS, ARE.
Perhaps even more surprising, is the fact that in all the Harvard
children the copula AM, IS, ARE as in I AM A DOCTOR developed
before AM, IS, ARE when it was part of the progressive construction,
for example, I AM SINGING. And the shortened copula as in HE’S
A BEAR came before the shortened progressive, for example HE’S
WALKING. This is quite an astonishing discovery. Although we might
expect children to go through similar general lines of development,
there seems to be no obvious reason why a variety of English children
should correspond so closely in their acquisition of speciﬁc items.
Possible reasons for this phenomenon will be discussed in Chapter 7.
A similar consistency of order is found in the acquisition of more
complicated constructions, such as questions and negatives. For example,
in the acquisition of WH- questions (questions beginning with WHAT,
WHY, WHERE, WHO, etc.), we can safely assume that Barbara,
like Adam, Eve and Sarah, went through three intermediate stages
before she acquired them perfectly (Klima and Bellugi 1966). First of
all, soon after her second birthday, she placed the WH-word in front
of the rest of the sentence:
WHAT
MUMMY DOING?
WHY
YOU SINGING?
WHERE
DADDY GO?
A second stage occurred three or four months later when she added
an auxiliary verb such as CAN or WILL to the main verb:
WHERE
YOU
WILL GO?
WHY
KITTY
CAN’T SEE?
WHY
YOU
DON’T KNOW?

Finally, before she was 3, she realized that the subject noun must
change places with the auxiliary and produced correct sentences such
as:
WHERE
WILL YOU
GO?
WHY
CAN’T KITTY
SEE?
WHY
DON’T YOU
KNOW?
Once again, the rather surprising ﬁnding that all English children
tend to follow a similar pattern will be discussed later. As already
noted, the actual age at which each stage is reached is irrelevant. It is
the order which matters.
By the age of 31⁄2, Barbara, like most children, was able to form
most grammatical constructions – and her speech was reasonably
intelligible to strangers. Her constructions were, however, less varied
than those of an adult. For example, she tended not to use the ‘full’
passive such as THE MAN WAS HIT BY A BUS. But she was able
to converse quite adequately on most topics.
By 5, she gave the superﬁcial impression of having acquired language
more or less perfectly. But this was an illusion. Language acquisition
was still continuing, though more slowly. The grammar of a child of
5 differs to a perhaps surprising degree from adult grammar. But the
5-year-old is not usually aware of his shortcomings. In comprehension
tests, children readily assign interpretations to the structures presented
to them – but they are often the wrong ones. ‘They do not, as they
see it, fail to understand our sentences. They understand them, but
they understand them wrongly’ (Carol Chomsky 1969: 2). To demon-
strate this point, the researcher showed a group of 5- to 8-year-olds
a blindfolded doll and said: ‘Is this doll hard to see or easy to see?’
All the 5- and 6-year-olds said HARD TO SEE, and so did some of
the 7- and 8-year-olds. The response of 6-year-old Lisa was typical:
Chomsky:
IS THIS DOLL EASY TO SEE OR HARD TO
SEE?
Lisa:
HARD TO SEE.
Chomsky:
WILL YOU MAKE HER EASY TO SEE?
Lisa:
IF I CAN GET THIS UNTIED?
Chomsky:
WILL YOU EXPLAIN WHY SHE WAS HARD
TO SEE?
Lisa: (to doll)
BECAUSE YOU HAD A BLINDFOLD OVER
YOUR EYES.

Some psychologists have criticized this particular test. A child some-
times believes, ostrich-fashion, that if his own eyes are covered, others
will not be able to see him. And he may be partly switching to the
doll’s viewpoint when he says a blindfolded doll is hard to see. But
a re-run of this experiment using wolf and duck puppets, and sentences
such as:
THE WOLF IS HARD TO BITE .
THE DUCK IS ANXIOUS TO BITE.
conﬁrmed the original results (Cromer 1970). Children of 5 and 6 just
do not realize that pairs of sentences such as THE RABBIT IS NICE
TO EAT and THE RABBIT IS EAGER TO EAT have completely
different underlying meanings.
In fact, the gap between child and adult speech lasts longer than
was once realized. Detailed experiments on French children’s under-
standing and use of the articles LE/LA ‘the’ and UN/UNE ‘a’ have
shown quite surprising differences between child and adult usage,
which remained in some cases up till the age of 12 (Karmiloff-Smith
1979).
But the discrepancies between Barbara’s speech and that of the adults
around her gradually disappeared over the next few years. By the age
of about 11, Barbara exhibited a command of the structure of her
language comparable to that of an adult. At the age of puberty, her
language development was essentially complete, apart from vocabulary.
She would continue to accumulate lexical items throughout her life.
The language milestones we have outlined tend to run parallel with
physical development. Clearly, there is no essential correlation between
language and motor development, since there are numerous examples
of children who learn to talk, but never walk, and vice versa. However,
researchers are agreed that in normal children the two often go together.
Language stages are often loosely linked to physical milestones. The
gradual change of cooing to babbling occurs around the time an infant
begins to sit up. Children utter single words just before they start to
walk. Grammar becomes complex as hand and ﬁnger co-ordination
develops.
We now need to discuss one ﬁnal point. Is it crucial for children
to develop language at the age they normally do? According to the
sixth and ﬁnal characteristic of maturationally controlled behaviour,
there may be a ‘critical period’ for its acquisition, though this is not
essential. Is this true of language? Let us consider this matter.

Is there a ‘critical period’?
Are humans like chafﬁnches? Or like canaries? Both these birds have
to partially learn their songs. But a chafﬁnch’s song becomes ﬁxed
and unalterable when it is around 15-months old. If the young bird
has not heard any chafﬁnch song before that time, it never learns to
sing normally (Thorpe 1972). But canaries can continue to alter their
song for years (Nottebohm 1984; Marler 1988). Lenneberg argued
that humans, like chafﬁnches, have a narrow ‘critical period’ set aside
by nature for the acquisition of language. In his view, it lasts from
toddler time to adolescence:
Between the ages of two and three years language emerges by an
interaction of maturation and self-programmed learning. Between
the ages of three and the early teens the possibility for primary
language acquisition continues to be good . . . After puberty, the
ability for self-organization and adjustment to the physiological
demands of verbal behaviour quickly declines. The brain behaves
as if it had become set in its ways and primary, basic skills not
acquired by that time usually remain deﬁcient for life.
(Lenneberg 1967: 158)
At one time, Lenneberg’s views were widely accepted. Children
clearly start talking at about the age of 2. And it seemed plausible that
language ability ceased at around 13. Almost everybody can remember
how difﬁcult it was to learn French at school. Even the best pupils
had a slightly odd accent, and made numerous grammatical mistakes.
It was comforting to believe that there was a biological explanation
for this. On closer inspection, however, the matter is not so clear cut.
Lenneberg appears to be right in outline, but wrong in some details.
The early part of life is indeed important for language, though it all
starts earlier than he assumed. Lenneberg argued for a link between
a critical period and lateralization, the specialization of language to
one side of the brain (Chapter 3). This process, in his view, happened
slowly, between the ages of 2 and 14. He was probably wrong about
this. Lateralization is established much earlier than he suggests. Even
babies under a year old show some evidence of it. In one experiment,
5- and 6-month-old infants were presented with sounds and lip
movements which were sometimes synchronized, sometimes not. They
seemed to notice the synchrony only when the direction of their gaze
showed that they were using their left hemisphere (MacKain et al.
1983). So lateralization is evident in the ﬁrst few months of life. And

as soon as young children can be tested with dichotic listening (Chapter
3), around age 21⁄2 or 3, they seem to be using their left hemisphere
for language (Kinsbourne and Hiscock 1987).
Lenneberg also claimed that if a child under the age of 2 sustained
severe damage to the left (language) hemisphere of the brain, speech
would develop normally, though it would be controlled by the right
hemisphere. The ‘critical period’ had in his view not yet begun. But
he was wrong to assume that children under 2 would not be affected
by left hemisphere damage. On the contrary, babies who have had
this half of their brain removed in the ﬁrst year of life have considerable
language problems (Dennis 1983; Vargha-Khadem and Polkey 1992).
Severe left hemisphere injury usually results in permanent linguistic
impairment, whatever the age of the patient.
But Lenneberg is right that a huge language surge occurs at around
the age of 2. And his claim that the language of younger children is
less severely impaired by brain damage than the speech of older ones
appears to be true (Vargha-Khadem et al. 1985). This is not surprising.
Young brains have greater powers of recovery. Infant monkeys with
brain damage recover faster than older ones (Goldman-Rakic 1982).
But does language come to a shuddering halt around adolescence,
as Lenneberg believed? The cases of three socially isolated children,
Isabelle, Genie and Chelsea, provide superﬁcial support for this view.
All three were cut off from language until long after the time they
would have acquired it, had they been brought up in normal
circumstances.
Isabelle was the illegitimate child of a deaf mute. She had no speech,
and made only a croaking sound when she was found in Ohio in the
1930s at the age of 61⁄2. Mother and child had spent most of the time
alone in a darkened room. But once found, Isabelle’s progress was
remarkable:
Isabelle passed through the usual stages of linguistic development
at a greatly accelerated rate. She covered in two years the learning
that ordinarily occupies six years. By the age of eight and a half,
Isabelle was not easily distinguishable from ordinary children of
her age
(Brown 1958: 192)
Genie, however, was not so lucky. She was not found until she
was nearly 14. Born in April 1957, she had lived most of her life in
bizarre and inhuman conditions:

From the age of twenty months, Genie had been conﬁned to a
small room . . . She was physically punished by her father if she
made any sounds. Most of the time she was kept harnessed into
an infant’s potty chair; otherwise she was conﬁned in a homemade
sleeping bag in an infant’s crib covered with wire mesh.
(Curtiss et al. 1974: 529)
When found, she was totally without language. She began acquiring
speech well after the onset of adolescence – after the proposed ‘critical
period’.
Although she learnt to speak in a rudimentary fashion, she progressed
more slowly than normal children (Curtiss 1977). For example, ordinary
children go through a stage in which they utter two words at a time
(WANT MILK, MUMMY PLAY), which normally lasts a matter of
weeks.
Genie’s two-word stage lasted for more than ﬁve months. Again,
ordinary children brieﬂy pass through a phase in which they form
negative sentences by putting the word NO in front of the rest of the
utterance, as in NO MUMMY GO, NO WANT APPLE. Genie used
this primitive form of negation for over two years. Normal children
start asking questions beginning with words such as WHERE, WHAT,
at the two-word stage (WHERE TEDDY?). Genie found this kind of
question impossible to grasp, occasionally making inappropriate attempts
such as WHERE IS STOP SPITTING? The only aspect of speech in
which Genie outstripped normal children was her ability to learn
vocabulary. She knew many more words than ordinary children at a
comparable stage of grammatical development. However, the ability
to memorize lists of items is not evidence of full language capacity,
even the chimps Washoe and Sarah found this relatively easy. The
rules of grammar are crucially important, and this is what Genie found
difﬁcult. Her slow progress compared with that of Isabelle seemed to
provide evidence in favour of a ‘cut-off’ point for language acquisition.
We must be cautious, however. Two individual cases cannot provide
ﬁrm proof, especially as each is problematical. Isabelle was not studied
by linguists, so her speech may have been more deﬁcient than was
reported. Genie, on the other hand, showed some evidence of brain
damage. Tests suggested that her left hemisphere was atrophied, which
meant that she was functioning with only one half of her brain, the
half not usually associated with language. The ﬁnal chapter of Genie’s
story is depressing. Her mother removed her from the care of those
who conversed with her. Left hospitalized and alone, she stopped
talking. ‘It’s a fated case’, commented one of her psychiatrists. ‘You

have a second chance in a situation like that – a chance to rescue the
child. But you don’t get a third chance, and that’s the situation now’
(Rymer 1993: 223).
Chelsea was another late starter (Curtiss 1988). She is an adult with
hearing problems who started learning language in her early thirties.
Like Genie, her vocabulary is good, but her syntax is poor. She says
things such as: THE WOMAN IS BUS THE GOING, ORANGE
TIM CAR IN, BANANA THE EAT. Chelsea’s strange syntax could
be due to her late start. But it might also be because of her defective
hearing. So neither Genie nor Chelsea provides convincing proof of
a ‘cut-off’ point for language acquisition. Each of them has severe
non-linguistic problems, which could account for their rudimentary
language.
According to Lenneberg, further evidence in favour of a critical
period is provided by mentally handicapped children, in particular,
Down’s syndrome cases (Lenneberg 1967). These follow the same
general path of development as normal children, but much more
slowly. Lenneberg claimed that they never catch up because their
ability to learn language slows down dramatically at puberty. But some
researchers have disputed this claim, arguing that the children’s language
ceases to develop through lack of stimulation. Moreover, further work
suggests that Down’s syndrome children have a built-in endpoint to
their ability. They may reach this ceiling at any age, though often
quite a long time before adolescence (Gleitman 1984).
To summarize so far, all the arguments for a sudden onset or ﬁnal
endpoint of the supposed critical period are unconvincing. It may be
better to speak of a ‘sensitive period’ – a time early in life when
acquiring language is easiest, and which tails off gradually, though never
entirely.
Early exposure to language is therefore important. Most of us envy
the linguistic ability of young children exposed to two or more
languages. They grow up ﬂuent in all of them. Older children hardly
ever sound like native-born speakers, even when they are talking the
same language. Six Canadians whose families moved to Britain demon-
strate this. The youngest, age 7 when he arrived, was eventually almost
indistinguishable from his English peers. But those over the age of 14
‘appear to be heading for life-times with non-native accents’ (Chambers
1995: 163).
Sign language also shows the need for an early start. Deaf children
who have deaf parents start signing earlier, and end up more proﬁcient
than deaf youngsters with hearing parents. Nicaragua’s deaf community
dramatically demonstrates the advantage of starting young. Here, young

deaf signers have developed a partial sign language into a ‘full’ one in
under 20 years (Kegl 1994). Before 1980, signing in Nicaragua was
minimal, a hotchpotch of different signs. Some 15 or so years later,
a whole language had emerged. An outline system learned by the ﬁrst
generation was picked up and elaborated by the next generation. A
7-year-old deaf boy called Santos, for example, learned rudimentary
signing from his deaf aunt and uncle. He soon progressed beyond
them: ‘His signing was the most ﬂuid and ﬂuent signing I have seen
in Nicaragua’ commented one researcher (Senghas 1994: 38), adding
that ‘older signers can look to younger children like Santos who lead
the way’. These Nicaraguan signers show how fast humans can acquire
and even devise a language system for themselves when they are young.
Ildefonso, a deaf languageless adult from rural Mexico had far more
trouble acquiring signs (Schaller 1995).
But some questions remain. First, is the sensitive period a speciﬁcally
linguistic one, as Lenneberg suggested, or a more general one? This
is unclear, though several neurologists favour the latter: ‘The period
between age two and the onset of puberty is one of extreme neural
plasticity. There is, however, little . . . that suggests a specifically
linguistic type of mechanism’ is a typical comment (Müller 1996).
Further work needs to be done on this.
A second question is this: how does child sensitivity to language
work, given how difﬁcult language learning seems to be for most
adults? A ‘natural sieve’ hypothesis is one idea. Very young children
may be able to extract only certain limited features from what they
hear, and may automatically ﬁlter out many complexities (Newport
1991). Later learners may have lost this inbuilt ﬁlter, and be less able
to cope as everything pours over them simultaneously. A ‘tuning-in’
hypothesis is another, overlapping possibility. At each age, a child may
be attuned to some particular aspect of language (Locke 1997). Infants
may be tuned in to the sounds, older children to the syntax, and after
age ten, the vocabulary remains a major concern (Aitchison 1997).
Selective attention of this type ﬁts in well with what we know
about biologically programmed behaviour. Children are innately guided
to pick out certain features from the sound-stream (or sign-stream),
just as bees are instinctively guided to pick out ﬂowers. Some learning
is involved for bees, because ﬂowers are so different from one another.
But bees end up ﬂying to clover and roses, rather than to postboxes
or lamp posts, just as children acquire language, rather than donkey
hee-haws or the twitter of blackbirds (Gould and Marler 1987).
In this chapter, therefore, we have shown that language seems to
have the characteristics of biologically programmed behaviour. It emerges

before it is necessary, and its emergence cannot be accounted for either
by an external event, or by a sudden decision taken by the child. Direct
teaching and intensive practice have relatively little effect. Acquisition
follows a regular sequence of milestones which can be loosely correlated
with other aspects of the child’s development. In other words, there
is an internal mechanism both to trigger it off and to regulate it. There
is a sensitive period for acquiring it, with early exposure a strong
advantage, since younger brains have more plasticity.
However, it would be wrong to think of language as something
which is governed only by internal mechanisms. These mechanisms
require external stimulation in order to work properly. The child needs
a rich verbal environment during the acquisition period.
This suggests that the so-called nature–nurture controversy men-
tioned in Chapter 1 may be misconceived. Both sides are right: nature
triggers off the behaviour, and lays down the framework, but careful
nurture is needed for it to reach its full potential. The dividing line
between ‘natural’ and ‘nurtured’ behaviour is by no means as clear
cut as was once thought. In other words, language is ‘natural’ behaviour
– but it still has to be carefully ‘nurtured’ in order to reach its full
potential. In modern terminology, the behaviour is innately guided. Or,
as another writer expressed it in the title of his book, we should be
talking about Nature via Nurture (Ridley 2003).
But, although we have now shed considerable light on the general
problem of innateness, and the difﬁculty of separating natural from
nurtured behaviour, we have not yet tried to answer the crucial
question, exactly what, if anything, could be innate? We noted in
Chapter 1 that Chomsky argued in favour of postulating a ‘rich
internal structure’. What in his opinion does this structure consist of?
And what do Chomsky’s opponents say? This is the topic considered
in the next chapter.

A blueprint in the brain?
Could any linguistic information
conceivably be innate?
There are very deep and restrictive principles that determine the nature
of human language and are rooted in the speciﬁc character of the
human mind.
Chomsky, Language and Mind
Young children must learn . . . the set of linguistic conventions used
by those around them . . . for any given language . . . The human
species is biologically prepared for this prodigious task . . . , but this
preparation cannot be too speciﬁc, as human children must be ﬂexible
enough to learn not only all of the different words and conventional
expressions of any language but also all the different types of abstract
constructional patterns . . . It thus takes many years.
Tomasello, Constructing a Language
It is relatively easy to show that humans are innately predisposed to
acquire language. The hard part is ﬁnding out exactly what is innate.
People have indulged in speculation about this for centuries. Over
two thousand years ago the Egyptian king Psammetichus had a theory
that if a child was isolated from human speech, the ﬁrst word he
spontaneously uttered would come from the world’s oldest inhabitants.
Naturally he hoped this would be Egyptian. He gave instructions for
two newborn children to be brought up in total isolation. When
eventually the children uttered the word BEKOS, Psammetichus
discovered to his dismay that this was the Phrygian word for ‘bread’.
He reluctantly concluded that the Phrygians were more ancient than
the Egyptians.
Nobody takes Psammetichus’s theory seriously today – especially as
the few reliable accounts we have of children brought up without
human contact indicate that they were totally without speech when

they were found. The famous French boy, Victor of Aveyron, who
was discovered naked rooting for acorns in the Caune woods in 1797,
did not speak Phrygian or any other language. He merely grunted
like an animal.
Although the speculations of Psammetichus can safely be ignored,
the ideas of Noam Chomsky on the topic of innateness were for a
long time taken seriously. He claimed that for language acquisition to
be possible, a child must be endowed with a ‘rich internal structure’,
and the biological evidence examined in the last two chapters suggest
that his ideas cannot be summarily dismissed. Chomsky’s notion of a
rich innate schema contrasted strongly with the point of view popularly
held earlier in the century that children are born with ‘blank sheets’
as far as language is concerned. Consequently, some people considered
Chomsky as someone who had set out to shock the world with
outrageous and novel proposals. But Chomsky denied this. He pointed
out that he was following in the footsteps of eighteenth-century
‘rationalist’ philosophers, who believed in the existence of ‘innate
ideas’. Such philosophers held that ‘beyond the peripheral processing
mechanisms, there are innate ideas and principles of various kinds that
determine the form of the acquired knowledge in what may be a
rather restricted and highly organized way’ (Chomsky 1965: 48).
Descartes, for example, suggested that when a child sees a triangle,
the imperfect triangle before his eyes immediately reminds him of a
true triangle, since we already possess within us the idea of a true
triangle.
But leaving philosophical predecessors aside, what exactly does (or
did) Chomsky regard as innate? In his words: ‘What are the initial
assumptions concerning the nature of language that the child brings
to language learning, and how detailed and specific is the innate
scheme?’ (Chomsky 1965: 27).
Chomsky gave an explicit account of his early views in his (now
outdated) linguistic classic Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965), though
he has repeated them in a number of other places with minor varia-
tions. But in recent years he has changed his mind on various points,
sometimes quite fundamentally. His later views were set out in
Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use (1986), later ones still
in The Minimalist Program (1995) and further views in On Nature and
Language (2002). The following account begins with his 1965 state-
ments. It then explains why he came to regard these as unsatisfactory,
and outlines his more recent ideas. It then discusses why Chomsky’s
ideas are gradually fading from the forefront of research, and those of
later scholars, such as Michael Tomasello, are taking over.

Chomsky’s early ideas: LAD and LAS
Chomsky has never regarded his proposals on the matter of innateness
as deﬁnitive: ‘For the present we cannot come at all close to making
a hypothesis that is rich, detailed and speciﬁc enough to account for
the fact of language acquisition’ (1965: 27). Nevertheless, his ideas
were speciﬁc enough to be interesting.
Chomsky started out with the basic assumption that anybody who
acquires a language is not just learning an accumulation of random
utterances but a set of ‘rules’ or underlying principles for forming
speech patterns: ‘The person who has acquired knowledge of a language
has internalized a system of rules that relate sound and meaning in a
particular way’ (Chomsky 1972b: 26). These ‘rules’ enable a speaker
to produce an indefinite number of novel utterances, rather than
straight repetitions of old ones. As we saw in Chapters 1 and 2, an
essential characteristic of language is its creativity. People do not just
run through a repertoire of stereotyped phrases when they speak.
Instead, they are continually producing novel utterances such as ‘My
baby swallowed four ladybirds’, or ‘Serendipity upsets me’. But where
do the rules come from? How do speakers discover them? Somehow,
children have to construct their own set of rules from the jumble of
speech they hear going on around them. This is a formidable task.
Chomsky pointed out that children are to some extent in the same
situation as a linguist faced with an unknown language. Both child
and linguist are surrounded by a superﬁcially unintelligible confusion
of sound which they must somehow sort out.
So let us ﬁrst consider how a linguist deals with this unknown
language situation. She possibly starts by ﬁnding simple sound sequences
which refer to single objects, such as TREE, NOSE, CONGER EEL.
But this stage is not particularly interesting from a syntactic point of
view. Learning a few dozen vocabulary items is a relatively simple
task, as is clear from the ease with which the chimps Washoe managed
to do this. In addition, Genie, the Californian teenager discussed in
Chapter 4, found the acquisition of vocabulary easy – it was the
grammatical rules that slowed her down. For a linguist working on
an exotic language, the interesting stage is likely to come when she
starts to notice recurring syntactic patterns among the data. As soon
as she has found some, she begins to make guesses or hypotheses
concerning the principles which underlie the patterns. For example,
suppose she repeatedly ﬁnds the utterances WOKKI SNIZZIT,
WOKKI UGGIT and WOKKI SNIFFIT. She might hazard, as a ﬁrst
guess that the sequence WOKKI always has to be followed by a

sequence which ends in -IT. But if, later, she ﬁnds utterances such
as LUKKIT WOKKI and UKKING WOKKI, she would have to
abandon her original, over-simple theory, and form a new, more
complex hypothesis to account for the fresh data. She continues this
process of forming hypotheses, testing them, then abandoning them
when they prove inadequate until, ideally, she has compiled a set of
rules which can account for all the possible sequences of the language
she is studying.
Children, according to Chomsky (1965), construct an internalized
grammar in the same way. They look for regularities in the speech
they hear going on around them, then make guesses as to the rules
which underlie the patterns. Their ﬁrst guess will be a simple one.
The second amended hypothesis will be more complex, the third,
more elaborate still. Gradually their mental grammar will become
more sophisticated. Eventually their internalized rules will cover all
the possible utterances of the language. Fodor (1966: 109) described
the situation clearly:
Like the scientist, the child ﬁnds himself with a ﬁnite body of
observations, some of which are almost certain to be unsystematic.
His problem is to discover regularities in these data that, at the
very least, can be relied upon to hold however much additional
data is added. Characteristically the extrapolation takes the form
of the construction of a theory that simultaneously marks the
systematic similarities among the data at various levels of abstraction,
permits the rejection of some of the observational data as
unsystematic, and automatically provides a general characterization
of the possible future observations.
If this hypothesis-testing view of language acquisition is correct,
children must be endowed with an innate hypothesis-making device which
enables them, like miniature scientists, to construct increasingly complex
hypotheses.
However, there are a number of differences between a linguist
working on an unknown language, and a child acquiring language for
the ﬁrst time. The linguist has always had considerably more help at
his disposal. He could say to a native speaker of the language he is
working on, ‘Does LEGLESS DADDY-LONG-LEGS make sense?’
‘Is ATE UP IT grammatical?’ ‘Is PLAYING CARDS ambiguous?’
and so on. The child cannot do this. Yet the amazing fact remains:
it is the child who acquires the complete grammar. No linguist has
ever written a perfect grammar of any language. This suggests that by

itself, an internal hypothesis-making device is not sufﬁcient to account
for the acquisition of language. The child must have some extra
knowledge at his disposal. It cannot be knowledge about any particular
language because babies learn all languages with equal ease. A Chinese
baby brought up in England will learn English as easily as an English
baby in China will learn Chinese. The wired-in knowledge must,
therefore, said Chomsky, consist of language universals. Children learn
language so fast and efﬁciently because they ‘know’ in outline what
languages look like. They know what is, and what is not, a possible
language. All they have to discover is which language they are being
exposed to. In Chomsky’s words, his theory:
attributes tacit knowledge of linguistic universals to the child. It
proposes that the child approaches the data with the presumption
that they are drawn from a language of a certain antecedently
well-deﬁned type, his problem being to determine which of the
(humanly) possible languages is that of the community in which
he is placed.

The child is perhaps like a pianist waiting to sight-read a piece of
music. The pianist will know in advance that the piece will have a
rhythmic beat, but she will not know whether it is in two, three or
four time until she sees it. She will know that the notes are within 
a certain range – but she will not know in what order or combinations
they come. But it is not very satisfactory to speak airily of ‘innate
linguistic universals’. What are these shadowy phenomena?
Language universals, Chomsky suggested (1965), are of two basic
types, substantive and formal. Substantive universals represent the
fundamental ‘building blocks’ of language, the substance out of which
it is made, while formal universals are concerned with the form or
shape of a grammar. An analogy might make this distinction clearer.
If, hypothetically, Eskimos were born with an innate knowledge of
igloo-building they would have two kinds of knowledge. On the one
hand, they would know in advance that the substance out of which
igloos are made is ice and snow, just as thrushes automatically know
that their nests are made of twigs, not bricks or worms or glass. On
the other hand, their innate knowledge of igloo-building would 
include the information that igloos are round in shape, not square or
diamond-shaped or sausage-like, just as thrushes instinctively build
round nests, not ones shaped like bathtubs.

To return to the substantive universals of human language, a child
might know instinctively the possible set of sounds to be found in
speech. She would automatically reject sneezes, belches, hand-clapping
and foot-stamping as possible sounds, but accept B, O, G, L, and so
on. She would dismiss PGPGPG as a possible word, but accept POG,
PIG, PEG or PAG.
But the idea of substantive universals was not particularly new. For
a long time linguists had assumed that all languages have nouns, verbs
and sentences even though the exact deﬁnitions of these terms is in
dispute. And for a long time linguists have been trying to identify a
‘universal phonetic alphabet’ which ‘deﬁnes the set of possible signals
from which signals of a particular language are drawn’ (Chomsky 1972b:
121). Such a notion is not very surprising, since humans all possess
similar vocal organs. More revolutionary were the formal universals
proposed by Chomsky. These were concerned with the form or shape
of a grammar, including the way in which the different parts relate to
one another.
According to Chomsky, children would ‘know’ in advance how
their internalized grammar must be organized. It must have a set of
phonological rules for characterizing sound patterns and a set of semantic
rules for dealing with meaning, linked by a set of syntactic rules dealing
with word arrangement.
SEMANTIC RULES
SYNTACTIC RULES
PHONOLOGICAL RULES
Furthermore, children would instinctively realize that in its rules
language makes use of structure-dependent operations. This, as noted in
Chapter 1 involves at least two types of knowledge: ﬁrst, an under-
standing of hierarchical structure – the notion that several words can
ﬁll the same slot as one:
COWS
EAT
GRASS
LARGE BROWN COWS
HAVE EATEN UP
THE GRASS
Second, it involves a realization that each slot functions as a unit that
can be moved around (though with minor extra adjustments):

Furthermore (as outlined in Chapter 1) Chomsky at one time assumed
that every sentence had an ‘inner’ hidden deep structure and an outer
manifest surface structure. The two levels of structure were linked by rules
known as transformations. As he explained:
The grammar of English will generate, for each sentence, a deep
structure, and will contain rules showing how this deep structure
is related to a surface structure. The rules expressing the relation
of deep and surface structure are called ‘grammatical transforma-
tions’.
(Chomsky 1972b: 166)
According to this view, several sentences that were quite different
on the surface could be related to one deep structure. The four sentences:
CHARLES CAPTURED A HEFFALUMP.
A HEFFALUMP WAS CAPTURED BY CHARLES.
IT WAS A HEFFALUMP WHICH CHARLES CAPTURED.
WHAT CHARLES CAPTURED WAS A HEFFALUMP.
were all related to a similar underlying structure.
Alternatively, different deep structures could undergo transformations
which made them similar on the surface, as in:
THE RABBIT IS READY TO EAT.

which could either mean that the rabbit was hungry, or that it was
about to be eaten.
Chomsky assumed that children would somehow ‘know’ about deep
structures, surface structures and transformations. They would realize
that they had to reconstruct for themselves deep structures which were
never visible on the surface.
To summarize so far, we have been outlining Chomsky’s ‘classic’
(1965) viewpoint. He assumed that children were endowed with an
innate hypothesis-making device, which enabled them to make increas-
ingly complex theories about the rules which would account for the
language they heard going on around them. In making these hypotheses,
children were guided by an inbuilt knowledge of language universals.
These provided a ‘blueprint’ for language, so that the child would
know in outline what a possible language looked like. This involved,
ﬁrst, information about the ‘building blocks’ of language, such as the
set of possible sounds. Second, it entailed information about the way
in which the components of a grammar were related to one another,
and restrictions on the form of the rules. In particular, Chomsky argued
that children automatically knew that language involved two levels of
syntax – a deep and a surface level, linked by ‘transformations’. And
(as he later argued) children also knew about some innately inbuilt
constraints on the form sentences could take. With this help a child
could speedily sift through the babble of speech he heard around him,
and hypothesize plausible rules which would account for it.
Children needed to be equipped with this information, he claimed,
because the ‘primary linguistic data’ (the data children are exposed to)
was likely to be ‘deﬁcient in various respects’ (1965: 201). It consisted
(he controversially assumed) ‘of a ﬁnite amount of information about
sentences, which, furthermore, must be rather restricted in scope . . .
and fairly degenerate in quality’ (1965: 31).

But another problem arose. There may be more than one possible
set of rules which will ﬁt the data. How does a child choose between
them? At one time, Chomsky suggested that children must in addition
be equipped with an evaluation procedure which would allow them to
choose between a number of possible grammars, that is, some kind of
measure which would enable them to weigh up one grammar against
another, and discard the less efﬁcient. This was perhaps the least satis-
factory of Chomsky’s proposals, and many psycholinguists regarded it
as wishful thinking. There were no plausible suggestions as to how this
evaluation procedure might work, beyond a vague notion that a child
might prefer short grammars to long ones. But even this was disputed,
since it is equally possible that children have very messy, complicated
grammars, which only gradually become simple and streamlined (e.g.
Schlesinger 1967). So the problem of narrowing down the range of
possible grammars was left unsolved.
According to Chomsky (1965 version), then, a hypothesis-making
device, linguistic universals and (perhaps) an evaluation procedure
constituted an innately endowed Language Acquisition Device (LAD)
or Language Acquisition System (LAS), (LAD for boys and LAS for
girls, as one linguist facetiously remarked). With the aid of LAD any
child could learn any language with relative ease – and without such
an endowment language acquisition would be impossible.

Over the years, Chomsky realized that he needed to specify further
restrictions on his grammar, of which (he assumed) children were
‘naturally’ aware. Youngsters would know that there were constraints
on the ways in which deep structures could be altered by the trans-
formational rules. They would be automatically aware of some quite
complex constraints on rearrangement possibilities. For example,
consider the sentence:
IGNATIUS HAS STOLEN A PIG.
If we wanted to ask which pig was involved, we would normally
bring the phrase about the pig to the front:
WHICH PIG HAS IGNATIUS STOLEN?
But supposing the original sentence had been:
ANGELA KNOWS WHO HAS STOLEN A PIG.
It would then be impossible to bring the ‘pig’ phrase to the front.
We could not say:
*WHICH PIG ANGELA KNOWS WHO HAS STOLEN?
According to Chomsky ‘some general principle of language determines
which phrases can be questioned’ (1980: 44), and children would
somehow ‘know’ this.
However, this relatively straightforward system disappeared from
Chomsky’s later writings. What made him change his mind, and what
did he propose instead?
Chomsky’s later views: setting switches
Suppose children knew in advance that the world contained two
hemispheres, a northern and a southern. In order to decide which
they were in, they simply needed to watch water swirling down the
plughole of a bath, since they were pre-wired with the information
that it swirled one way in the north, and another way in the south.
Once they had observed a bath plughole, then they would automatically
know a whole lot of further information: an English child who
discovered bathwater swirling clockwise would know that it had been
placed in the northern hemisphere. It could then predict that the sun

would be in the south at the hottest part of the day, and that it would
get hotter as one travelled southwards. An Australian child who noticed
water rotating anticlockwise would immediately realize the opposite.
This scenario is clearly science ﬁction. But it is the sort of situation
Chomsky then envisaged for children acquiring language. They were
pre-wired with a number of possible options which language might
choose. They would need to be exposed to relatively little language,
merely some crucial trigger, in order to ﬁnd out which route their
own language had chosen. Once they had discovered this, they would
automatically know, through pre-programming, a considerable amount
about how languages of this type work.
Let us consider how Chomsky hit on such an apparently bizarre
idea.
Learnability remained Chomsky’s major concern. How is language
learnable, when the crumbs and snippets of speech heard by children
could not possibly (in Chomsky’s view) provide sufﬁcient clues to the
ﬁnal system which is acquired? There seemed no way in which the
child could narrow down its guesses sufﬁciently to arrive at the grammar
of a human language. The learnability problem has also been called
the ‘logical problem of language acquisition’: how, logically, do children
acquire language when they do not have enough information at their
disposal to do so?
The logical answer is that they have an enormous amount of infor-
mation pre-wired into them: the innate component must be consider-
ably more extensive than was previously envisaged. Children, therefore,
are born equipped with Universal Grammar, or UG for short: ‘UG is
a characterization of these innate, biologically determined principles,
which constitute one component of the human mind – the language
faculty’ (Chomsky 1986: 24). This is ‘a distinct system of the mind/
brain’ (1986: 25), separate from general intelligence.
UG was envisaged as more structured than the old and somewhat
vaguer notion of innate universals. It was ‘a computational system that
is rich and narrowly constrained in structure and rigid in its essential
operations’ (1986: 43). Let us see how it differed.
Imagine an orchestra, playing a symphony. The overall effect is of
a luscious tropical jungle, a forest of intertwined melodies. Yet, if one
looks at the score, and contemplates the various musical instruments,
one gets a surprise. Each instrument has its own limitations, such as
being conﬁned to a certain range of notes. Most of the instruments
are playing a relatively simple tune. The overall, intricate Turkish
carpet effect is due to the skilled interaction of numerous simple
components.

In 1986, then, Chomsky viewed UG and language as something
like an orchestra playing a symphony. It consisted of a number of
separate components or modules, a term borrowed from computers.
Chomsky noted: ‘UG . . . has the modular structure that we regularly
discover in investigation of cognitive systems’ (1986: 146). Within
each module, there were sets of principles. Each principle was fairly
straightforward when considered in isolation. The principles became
complex when they interacted with those from other modules.
The general framework was not at that time entirely new. He still
retained the notion of deep and surface structure (or D-structure and
S-structure as he started to call them). But the number of transformations
was drastically reduced – possibly to only one! But this one, which
moved structures about, was subject to very severe constraints. Innate
principles speciﬁed what could or could not happen, and these were
quite rigid. Chomsky’s major concern, therefore, was in specifying
the principles operating within each module, and showing how they
interacted.
How many modules were involved, and what they all did, was
never fully speciﬁed. But the general idea behind the grammar was
reasonably clear. For example, one module might specify which items
could be moved, and how far, as with the word WHO, which can
be moved to the front of the sentence:
WHO DID SEBASTIAN SAY OSBERT BIT?
Another might contain information as to how to interpret a sentence
such as:
SEBASTIAN SAID OSBERT BIT HIM INSTEAD OF HIMSELF.
This would contain principles showing why SEBASTIAN had to 
be linked to the word HIM, and OSBERT attached to the word
HIMSELF. These two types of principles would interact in a sentence
such as:
WHO DID SEBASTIAN SAY OSBERT BIT INSTEAD OF HIMSELF?
Most of the principles, and the way they interleaved, were innately
speciﬁed and fairly rigid.
However, a narrowly constrained rigid UG presented another
dilemma. Why are not all languages far more similar? Chomsky argued
that UG was only partially ‘wired-up’. There were option points within

the modules, with switches that could be set to a ﬁxed number of
positions, most probably two. Children would know in advance what
the available options are. This would be pre-programmed and part 
of a human’s genetic endowment. A child would therefore scan the
data available to him or her, and on the basis of a limited amount of
evidence would know which way to throw the switch. In Chomsky’s
words:
We may think of UG as an intricately structured system, but one
that is only partially ‘wired-up’. The system is associated with a
ﬁnite set of switches, each of which has a ﬁnite number of positions
(perhaps two). Experience is required to set the switches. When
they are set the system functions.
(Chomsky 1986: 146)
Chomsky supposed that the switches must be set on the basis of
quite simple evidence, and that a switch, once set in a particular direc-
tion, would have quite complex consequences throughout the language.
These consequences would automatically be known by the child.
As an example, Chomsky suggested that children might know in
advance that language structures have one key word, or head. They
then had to ﬁnd out the position of the subsidiary words (or modiﬁers).
These could be placed either before or after the head. In English,
heads are generally placed before modiﬁers:
Head
Modiﬁer
DROP
THAT SLIPPER!
DOWN
THE DRAIN
So we get sentences such as:
THE DOG DROPPED THE SLIPPER DOWN THE DRAIN.
A language such as Turkish would reverse this order, and say the
equivalent of THAT SLIPPER DROP, THE DRAIN DOWN. The
end result is that Turkish looks quite different on the surface. It would
say, as it were:
THE DOG THE DRAIN DOWN THE SLIPPER DROPPED.

However, this superﬁcial strangeness is to a large extent the result of
one simple option, choosing to place modiﬁers on a different side of
the head.
UG, then, was envisaged as a two-tier system: a hard-wired basic
layer of universal principles, applicable to all languages, and a second
layer which was only partially wired in. This contained a ﬁnite set of
options which had to be decided between on the basis of observation.
These option possibilities were known as parameters, and Chomsky
spoke of the need ‘to ﬁx the parameters of UG’ (Chomsky 1981: 4).
The term parameter is a fairly old mathematical one, which is also used
in the natural sciences. In general, it refers to a ﬁxed property which
can vary in certain ways. For example, one might talk of ‘temperature’
and ‘air pressure’ as being ‘parameters’ of the atmosphere. So in
language, a parameter is a property of language (such as head position,
discussed above) whose values could vary from language to language.
We were therefore dealing with ‘a system of unifying principles
that is fairly rich in deductive structure but with parameters to be
ﬁxed by experience’ (Chomsky 1980: 66). The interlocking nature of

the system would ensure that minor alterations would have multiple
consequences: ‘In a tightly integrated theory with a fairly rich internal
structure, change in a single parameter may have complex effects, with
proliferating consequences in various parts of the grammar’ (Chomsky
1981: 6). In particular, ‘a few changes in parameters yield typologically
different languages’ (Chomsky 1986: 152). This whole idea has become
known as the ‘principles and parameters’ or ‘P and P’ approach.
Once the values of the parameters are set, ‘the whole system is
operative’ (Chomsky 1986: 146), and a child has acquired its core
language. Only minor peripheral elements now remain to be learned:
Suppose we distinguish core language from periphery, where a core
language is a system determined by ﬁxing values for the parameters
of UG, and the periphery is whatever is added on in the system
actually represented in the mind/brain of a speaker-hearer.
(Chomsky 1986: 147)
In this system ‘what we “know innately” are the principles of the
various subsystems . . . and the manner of their interaction, and the
parameters associated with these principles. What we learn are the values
of the parameters and the elements of the periphery’ (Chomsky 
1986: 150).
Children had relatively little to do in this type of system: ‘We view
the problem of language acquisition as . . . one of ﬁxing parameters
in a largely determined system’ (Chomsky 1986: 151). Indeed, many
of the old rules which children had to learn just appeared automatically,
because the principles underlying them were there already. Take the
‘rule’ that objects follow verbs, as in THROW THE BALL, EAT
YOUR CAKE. The child might ‘know’ that languages behave
consistently as far as heads and modiﬁers are concerned (as discussed
above). Once the ‘head’ parameter is set, then the rule appears without
any tedious learning, as does the rule that prepositions precede nouns,
as in IN THE BATH, ON THE TABLE. As Chomsky noted: ‘There
has been a gradual shift of focus from the study of rule systems . . .
to the study of systems of principles, which appear to occupy a much
more central position in determining the character and variety of
possible human languages’ (Chomsky 1982: 7–8). If this minimal effort
by the child is correct, then it makes sense to think of the language
system as a ‘mental organ’, which grows mainly by itself, in the same
way that the heart grows in the body. Chomsky became increasingly
concerned to understand the principles which underlay this growth.

Paring it down still further
Chomsky tried to become like a biologist who no longer looks in
turn at a human heart, then at a human elbow, but instead aims to
understand the body as a whole. Or, as he suggested, he was like
someone trying to go beyond the simple observation that apples fall
to the ground because that is where apples inevitably end up, and
instead, tries to understand the principle of gravity. In his words:
If we are satisﬁed that an apple falls to the ground because that
is its natural place, there will be no serious science of mechanics.
The same is true if one is satisﬁed with traditional rules for forming
questions, or with the entries in the most elaborate dictionaries,
none of which come close to describing simple properties of these
linguistic objects.
(Chomksy 1995a: 387)
Increasingly, then, he tried to ﬁnd the basic principles behind the
tangled jungle of individual linguistic rules: ‘The task is to show that
the apparent richness and diversity of linguistic phenomena is illusory
. . . the result of interaction of ﬁxed principles under slightly varying
conditions’ (Chomsky 1995a: 389).
He therefore pared his proposals down to what he called a Minimalist
Program, which contained hypotheses about the bare bones of langu-
age. This pared-down version retained basic switch-setting (p. 109),
with its ‘principles’ and ‘parameters’, but two levels of structure were
abolished. D-structure (once deep structure) and S-structure (once
surface structure) no longer appeared as separate strata. The wordstore
(lexicon) fed into a ‘computational system’, which checked that word
combinations ﬁtted in with basic principles. The wordstore also fed
into a ‘spell-out’ which sifted through anything likely to affect the
pronunciation. The endpoint was meaning on the one hand, and
pronunciation on the other.
This bare-bones system remained in its preliminary stages. But the
principles which guided the system were perhaps the most interesting
part, though they remained sketchy. They were basically principles of
‘economy’ or simplicity. For example, one of these was ‘Shortest
Move’. If one of two chunks of structure needed to be moved, then
the one which moved least far must be selected. Take the sentence:
FENELLA PERSUADED ALPHONSE TO BUY A GREEN PARROT.

Suppose you wanted to check who was persuaded, and what was
bought:
FENELLA PERSUADED WHO TO BUY WHAT?
Normally, any WH-word (word beginning with WH- such as WHO,
WHAT) has to be brought to the front of the sentence. But only one
can be moved. So here you have to choose. Should it be WHO or
WHAT? Or doesn’t it matter? In fact, it matters very much. You can
say:
WHO DID FENELLA PERSUADE TO BUY WHAT?
But not:
*WHAT DID FENELLA PERSUADE WHO TO BUY?
Only the WH-word nearest to the front can be moved, which ties
in with Chomsky’s ‘Shortest Move’ principle.
This, then, was the type of principle which Chomsky hoped to
identify – though his goal remained elusive. As he admitted:
Current formulation of such ideas still leaves substantial gaps. It
is, furthermore, far from obvious that language should have
anything like the character postulated in the minimalist program,
which is just that: a research program concerned with ﬁlling the
gaps and asking how positive an answer we can give to the question
how ‘perfect’ is language?
(Chomsky 1995a: 390)
But if Chomsky is so unsure, does anybody else know? Chomsky’s
increasingly broad and general claims about language brought him
closer to people he originally disagreed with, those who argued that
the broad general principles of language are indistinguishable from the
broad general principles of human cognition in general. So where do
we go from here?
Maybe the answer is to turn back from such huge abstract ideas,
and to look again at the nitty-gritty of how humans actually use
language. According to Michael Tomasello, ‘how children learn
language is not a logical problem but an empirical problem.’ (Tomasello
2003: 328). In his opinion, we need to turn to a usage-based approach,
one which explores how human children combine inherited talents

and learned skills as they acquire language. He explains: ‘The human
capacity for language is best seen as a conspiracy of many different
cognitive, social-cognitive, information-processing, and learning skills,
some of which humans share with primates and some of which are
unique products of human evolution’ (Tomasello 2003: 321).
The next step is perhaps to look at child language, and see what
can be gleaned from the way children learn to talk. This will be the
topic of the next two chapters.

How do children get started on
learning to speak?
They can’t talk straight 
Any more than they can walk straight.
Their pronunciation is awful 
And their grammar is ﬂawful. 
Ogden Nash, It must be the milk 
According to Ogden Nash, the behaviour of children and drunks is
equally confusing. Linguists would perhaps agree with him. Listening
to infants speaking is like being in topsy-turvy land. The problems of
children faced with adult language sometimes seem trivial to a linguist
who is trying to decipher infant burbles. But far worse than the problem
of decipherment is the difﬁculty of interpreting the utterances. One
writer remarked that writing about the acquisition of language:
is somewhat like the problem of reconstructing a dinosaur while
the bones are still being excavated. It can happen that after you
have connected what you earnestly believe are the hind legs you
ﬁnd that they are the jaw bones.
(McNeill 1970: vii)
Consequently, before we consider the main topic of this chapter –
how children get started on learning to speak – we must outline some
of the problems of interpretation which arise when linguists attempt
to analyse child language. We shall do this by considering one-word
utterances.
Ba, qua, ha and other one-word utterances
One-word utterances present a microcosm of the difﬁculties faced by
linguists examining child language. Consider the following situation.

Suppose a child says BA when she is in the bath, again says BA when
given a mug of milk, and also says BA to the kitchen taps. How are
we to interpret this? There are at least four possible explanations.
The ﬁrst possibility is that the child is simply naming the objects
to prove she knows them, but has overgeneralized the word BA. That
is, she has learnt the name BA for ‘bath’ and has wrongly assumed
that it can apply to anything which contains liquid. A typical example
of this type of overgeneralization was noted by one harassed mother
in a letter to the London Evening Standard:
My baby is Moon-struck. She saw the moon in the sky at six
o’clock last week and ever since she’s gaped at the sky shouting
for the moon. Now she thinks anything that shines is the moon;
street lamps, headlights, even the reﬂected light bulb in the window.
All I hear is yells about the moon all day. I love my baby but
I’m so ashamed. How does one get patience?
However, this plain overgeneralization interpretation may be too
simple a view of what is happening when the child says BA. A second,
and alternative, explanation has been proposed by the famous Russian
psychologist Vygotsky (1893–1934). He suggested that when children
overgeneralize they do so in a quite confusing way. They appear to
focus attention on one aspect of an object at a time. One much quoted
example concerns a child who used the word QUA to refer to a duck,
milk, a coin and a teddy bear’s eye (Vygotsky 1962: 70). QUA ‘quack’
was, originally, a duck on a pond. Then the child incorporated the
pond into the meaning, and by focusing attention on the liquid ele-
ment, QUA was generalized to milk. But the duck was not forgotten,
since QUA was used to refer to a coin with an eagle on it. Then,
with the coin in mind, the child applied QUA to any round coin-
like object, such as a teddy bear’s eye. Vygotsky called this phenomenon
a ‘chain complex’ because a chain of items is formed, all linked by
the same name. If he is correct, then in the case of BA, we can suggest
that the child originally meant ‘bath’. Then, by focusing her attention
on the liquid elements she generalized the word to ‘milk’. Meanwhile,
remembering the bath taps, she used BA to mean ‘kitchen taps’ (see
diagram on p. 117).
Yet even Vygotsky’s ‘chain complex’ interpretation seems over-
simple in the view of some researchers. A third, and less obvious, point
of view is that of David McNeill, a psychologist at the University of
Chicago. He argued that one-word utterances show a linguistic
sophistication which goes far beyond the actual sound spoken. He

claimed that the child is not merely involved in naming exercises, but
is uttering holophrases, single words which stand for whole sentences.
For example, BA might mean ‘I am in my bath’ or ‘Mummy’s fallen
in the bath’. He justiﬁes his viewpoint by claiming that misuse of words
shows evidence of grammatical relationships which the child understands,
but cannot yet express. For example, a 1-year-old child said HA when
something hot was in front of her. A month later she said HA to an
empty coffee cup and a turned-off stove. Why did she do this? McNeill
suggested that:
by misusing the word the child showed that ‘hot’ was not merely
the label of hot objects but was also something said of objects
that could be hot. It asserted a property.
(McNeill 1970: 24)
He also claimed that the same child understood the notion of location
because she pointed to the empty top of the refrigerator, where bananas
were normally kept, and said NANA. He concluded that ‘there is a
constant emergence of new grammatical relations, even though no
utterance is ever longer than one word’ (McNeill 1970: 23). So,
McNeill might perhaps suggest that BA, when applied to kitchen taps
and milk, showed an understanding of location: ‘There are taps like
this on the bath tub’, ‘There is liquid like this in the bath.’
McNeill claimed that children understand a wide variety of gram-
matical relationships and that one-word utterances are sentences in
embryo. This seems over-imaginative to many researchers. However,

the idea that single-word utterances may be more than mere labels
has also been examined by Lois Bloom, a researcher at Columbia
University, who put forward a fourth possibility (Bloom 1973).
After a careful analysis of the single words spoken by her daughter,
Allison, she suggested that there is no simple answer to the problem
of interpretation because the meaning of a one-word utterance varies
according to the age of the child. For example, when Allison said
MUMMY at the age of 16 months, she seemed to mean, simply,
‘That’s Mummy’. But at the age of 19 months she appeared to be
trying to express some kind of interaction between Mummy and the
surrounding environment, as when she pointed to her mother’s cup
and said, MUMMY.
However, Bloom was unable to tell exactly what kind of interaction
was intended. Did Allison mean ‘That’s Mummy’s cup’, or was she
saying ‘Mummy’s drinking from a cup too’? Because of this intrinsic
ambiguity, Bloom was cautious about assigning speciﬁc meanings to
BA-type words which relate either to objects, or to interaction between
objects. She was more optimistic about the interpretation of words
such as NO, MORE and A’GONE in which ‘conceptual notions are
so conveniently tied to the actual words in the child’s speech’ (Bloom
1973: 140). For example, Allison showed by her use of the words NO
and A’GONE that she could cope with the notion of non-existence.
Bloom, therefore, concluded (perhaps not surprisingly) that single words
are grammatically fairly uninteresting. Their importance lies in the
light they throw on a child’s conceptual representation of experience.
Other researchers have tried to analyse what the child is trying to
do with one-word utterances (e.g. Wells 1974; Halliday 1975; Grifﬁths
1986). If a child says GA, is she simply naming an object such as a
cat? Is she asking for the cat? Or is she trying to control the actions
of her parents by telling them to let the cat in? All of these are possible.
The probable ‘translation’ may even depend on the temperament of
the child. Some children simply enjoy naming things, others prefer
to use words to get the attention of the adults around them.
An extra reason for caution is that some youngsters may not even
realize that they are ‘naming’ things when they first utter words
(McShane 1979, 1980). They may simply be taking part in a ritual
game. Many middle-class parents sit down with their children and leaf
through picture books, naming the objects which appear on each
page, such as ‘apple’, ‘ball’, ‘cat’, ‘duck’, and so on. The child may
shriek BA delightedly when she reaches the page with the round blue
blob in the middle, but may not for some weeks realize that this
sequence of sounds is actually the ‘name’ of a certain type of round

object, a ball. As McShane put it: ‘The child ﬁrst learns the words
and later learns that these words are names’ (1979: 890). The sudden
realization that things have names appears to lead to a surge of ‘labelling’
everyday objects such as CAR, MILK, BALL, APPLE, followed by
a surge of ‘describing’, with the use of words such as BLUE, GONE,
BROKE, HIT. This in turn, he suggested, leads to the beginning of
structured speech. His suggestion is supported by others: ‘This
burgeoning store of comprehended words triggers or reinforces the
activation of analytical mechanisms’ (Locke 1997: 276).
But the situation is by no means clear cut. Some children go through
this sudden ‘naming insight’ stage, others seem to know that things
have names before they start to utter any words (Harris et al. 1988).
And occasionally, the ‘single word’ stage may even be missed out.
There are reports of a working-class black community in Pennsylvania
where it is considered odd to talk to babies, and parents make no
attempt to interpret children’s early babbles as labels. These children
often begin to communicate by picking up whole phrases, which they
use with a wide range of intonations and meanings. One toddler,
Teegie, used ‘You shut up’ to mean ‘No’, ‘Leave me alone’, ‘Give
me that’, and ‘Take it, I don’t want it’ (Heath 1983). But these children
learned language perfectly well via this route. A young child is ‘faced
with having to discover what talking is all about’ (Grifﬁths 1986: 281),
and there seems to be no one way in which this realization comes
about.
This brief excursus has by no means exhausted the views on one-
word utterances found in the literature. It does, however, illustrate
one important point: when the data are so confusing, it is no wonder
that differences of opinion abound in child language studies. All
researchers, to some extent, see what they want to see. This accounts
for the extraordinarily diverse viewpoints which arise over apparently
simple issues.
Having pointed out the type of problem that is likely to arise, we
must now return to the main topic of this chapter, which is the
following: how do children get started on learning to speak? We shall
consider this question by looking ﬁrst at children’s two-word utterances.
We shall then go on to examine how children acquire more complicated
aspects of language such as word endings and negation.
Two-by-two
There are basically two ways of analysing two-word utterances. We
may choose either the ‘Let’s pretend they’re talking Martian’ technique

or the ‘Let’s guess what they’re trying to say’ method. In the ﬁrst,
linguists approach the child’s speech as if it were an unknown exotic
language. Having freed their minds of preconceived notions connected
with their knowledge of English, they write a grammar based entirely
on the word patterns they discern in the child’s speech. In the second
method, linguists try to provide an interpretation of what the child is
saying by using their knowledge of the language and by observing the
situation in which the words were uttered.
In their earliest attempts at analysing two-word utterances, linguists
followed the ‘Let’s pretend they’re talking Martian’ technique. Martin
Braine (1963), of the University of California at Santa Barbara, listed
all the two-word utterances produced by three 2-year-olds, Steven,
Gregory and Andrew. The results were superﬁcially puzzling. There
were a number of inexplicable sequences such as MORE TAXI,
ALLGONE SHOE, NO BED, BUNNY DO, IT DOGGIE. Such
utterances could not be straight imitations, as it is unlikely that any
adult ever said MORE TAXI, ALLGONE SHOE or BUNNY DO.
Anyway, straight imitation would put too great a strain on the child’s
memory. Braine counted over 2,500 different combinations uttered by
one child. Are these then just accidental juxtapositions? Apparently not.
To his surprise, Braine noted that the combinations did not seem to
be random. Certain words always occurred in a ﬁxed place, and other
words never occurred alone. Andrew, Steven and Gregory all seemed
to have adopted a simple though genuine pattern when they put two
words together. They had two distinct classes of word in their speech.
One class contained a small number of words such as ALLGONE,
MORE, THIS, NO. These words occurred frequently, never alone,
and in a ﬁxed position. They were labelled pivots, because the utterance
appeared to pivot round them. The other class contained many more
words which occurred less frequently, but in any position and sometimes
alone. These words often coincided with adult nouns such as MILK,
SHOE, BUNNY and so on. They are sometimes called open class
words, since an ‘open’ class is a set of words which can be added to
indeﬁnitely.
For example, Steven always used WANT, GET, THERE, IT as
pivots in ﬁrst position, and DO as a pivot in second position. His open
class words included a wide variety of names such as BABY, CAR,
MAMA, DADA, BALL, DOLL, BUNNY, HORSIE. Steven seemed
to have adopted a pattern which said, ‘A sentence consists of either a
type 1 pivot followed by an open class word (P1 + O), or an open
class word followed by a type 2 pivot (O + P2)’:

Several other researchers who independently tried the exotic language
technique conﬁrmed this phenomenon by ﬁnding other children who
formed word combinations in the same way as Andrew, Steven and
Gregory (Brown and Fraser 1964; Miller and Ervin 1964). For a time,
linguists were quite excited. They thought they might have discovered
a universal ﬁrst grammar, a so-called pivot grammar. But, alas, disillusion
gradually crept in. One by one, researchers noted that a number of
children did not ﬁt into this simple pattern. Although all children
showed strong preferences for placing certain words in a particular
position in an utterance, these preferences were not always strong
enough to be regarded as genuine ‘rules’. In addition, some children
used so-called pivots such as MORE, NO, by themselves, which
disagreed with Braine’s ﬁnding that pivot words do not occur alone.
And other children confused the picture by having pivot constructions
as only a small portion of their total utterances.
Perhaps the biggest difﬁculty for pivot grammar was the appearance
of utterances such as MUMMY SOCK, DADDY CAR, KITTY
BALL, which occur in the speech of many children. Here two open
class words seem to be juxtaposed, with no pivot in sight! Braine
dismissed this problem by saying that O + O constructions were a
second stage, which occurred only after the P + O and O + P phase.
But this does not seem to be true of all children. Of course, there is
nothing wrong with stating that some youngsters make sentences which
can be P + O, O + P or O + O. It just does not tell us very much
to say that ‘As well as pivot constructions, almost any other two words
can occur together.’ But even if such empty statements were acceptable,
it is not necessarily correct to assume that O + O utterances are
random juxtapositions. There may be more reason behind them than
appears at ﬁrst sight, and the words may be related to one another in
a highly structured way. It is quite inadequate to characterize a sentence
such as DADDY CAR as O + O, since such a description cannot
distinguish between several possible interpretations:

‘That’s Daddy’s car.’

‘Daddy is under the car.’
Pivot grammars, therefore, were not as much use as was once hoped.
They only described the rules used by a small number of children –
or perhaps, more accurately, they characterized only a small portion
of the output of most children. If one used pivot grammars in order
to answer the question ‘Are two-word utterances structured?’, the
answer would be: ‘Partially – children use pivot constructions but
supplement them by apparently combining open class words at random.’
Disillusioned by the pivot grammars which resulted from the 
‘Let’s pretend he’s talking Martian’ technique, later linguists tended
to favour the second ‘Let’s guess what they’re trying to say’ approach.
This is more time-consuming, since researchers must note not just 
the utterances themselves, but also the accompanying actions. Luckily,
what young children say usually relates directly to what they do and
see:
If an adult or an older child mounts a bicycle, there is no need
for him to inform anyone who has seen him do it that he has
done it. But a young child who mounts a tricycle will often
‘announce’ the fact: I ride trike!
(Bloom 1970: 9)
One of the ﬁrst linguists to make a careful study of two-word
utterances following this method was again Lois Bloom (1970, 1991;
Bloom et al. 1975). She kept a careful account of the actions accom-
panying the utterances of three children, Kathryn, Eric and Gia, and
provided convincing interpretations of what they were trying to say.
For example, it was quite clear what 21-month-old Kathryn meant
on the two occasions when she uttered the words MOMMY SOCK.
The ﬁrst time, she said it as she picked up her mother’s sock, indicating
that she meant ‘This is Mummy’s sock’. The second time was when
her mother was putting Kathryn’s sock on Kathryn, so Kathryn was
saying ‘Mummy is putting on my sock for me.’ Two-year-old Gia
said LAMB EAR apparently meaning ‘That’s the lamb’s ear’ when
her mother pointed to the ear on a toy lamb, and said, ‘What’s this?’
She said GIRL BALL when looking at a picture of a girl bouncing
a ball, and presumably meant ‘The girl is bouncing a ball.’ She said
FLY BLANKET when a ﬂy settled on her blanket, probably meaning
‘There is a ﬂy on my blanket.’

There is a possible objection to these interpretations. Is Bloom not
reading too much into these utterances? Perhaps Gia was just saying
‘That is a lamb and an ear’, ‘That is a girl and a ball.’ ‘That is a ﬂy
and a blanket.’ Or perhaps she was just bringing up a ‘topic’ of
conversation, and then making a ‘comment’ about it: ‘I’m talking
about a ﬂy, and it has involved itself with my blanket’, ‘I’m referring
to a girl who is connected with a ball.’ This type of suggestion was
ﬁrst put forward in the mid-1960s to explain two-word utterances
(Gruber 1967).
How can one eliminate these possibilities? The answer is that the
highly consistent word order made it unlikely that the sequences were
random juxtapositions. Whenever Gia seemed to be expressing location
she put the object she was locating ﬁrst, and the location second: FLY
BLANKET ‘The ﬂy is on the blanket’, FLY BLOCK ‘The ﬂy is on
the block’, BLOCK BAG ‘The block is in the bag.’ When she referred
to subjects and objects, she put the subject ﬁrst, and the object second:
GIRL BALL ‘The girl is bouncing the ball’, GIRL FISH ‘The girl is
playing with a ﬁsh.’ And she expressed possession by putting the
possessor ﬁrst, the possession second: LAMB EAR ‘That’s the lamb’s
ear’, GIA BLUEYES ‘That’s Gia’s doll, Blueyes.’ If Gia was accidentally
juxtaposing the words we would expect BLANKET FLY or EAR
LAMB as often as FLY BLANKET or LAMB EAR. And the possessive
sentences make it highly unlikely that Gia was using a ‘topic’ and
‘comment’ construction. It would be most odd in the case of GIA
BLUEYES to interpret it as ‘I am talking about myself, Gia, and what
I want to comment on is that I have a doll Blueyes.’
Of course, Gia was expressing these relationships of location,
possession, and subject–object in the same order as they are found in
adult speech. But the important point is that she seemed to realize
automatically that it was necessary to express relationships consistently
in a way Washoe the chimp perhaps did not. She seemed to expect
language to consist of recurring patterns, and seemed naturally disposed
to look for regularities. But before stating conclusively that Gia’s
utterances were patterned, we must consider one puzzling excep-
tion. Why did Gia say BALLOON THROW as well as THROW
BALLOON when she dropped a balloon as if throwing it? Why 
did she say BOOK READ as well as READ BOOK when she was
looking at a book? Surely this is random juxtaposition of the type we
have just claimed to be non-existent? A closer look at Gia’s early
utterances solves the mystery.
In her earliest two-word sequences, Gia always said BALLOON
THROW and BOOK READ. She had deduced wrongly that the

names of people and objects precede action words. This accounts for
‘correct’ utterances such as GIRL WRITE and MUMMY COME as
well as ‘mistakes’ such as BALLOON THROW and SLIDE GO,
when she placed some keys on a slide. Soon she began to have doubts
about her original rule, and experimented, using ﬁrst one form, then
the other. Utterances produced at a time when the child is trying to
make up her mind have aptly been labelled ‘groping patterns’ by one
linguist (Braine 1976). Eventually, after a period of ﬂuctuation, Gia
acquired the verb–object relationship permanently with the correct
order THROW BALLOON, READ BOOK.
The consistency which Bloom found in the speech of Kathryn, Eric
and Gia, has been confirmed by numerous researchers who have
worked independently on other children. In conclusion, then, our
answer to the question ‘Are two-word utterances patterned?’ must be
‘Yes’. From the moment they place two words together (and possibly
even before) children seem to realize that language is not just a random
conglomeration of words. They express each relationship consistently,
so that, for example, in the actor–action relationship, the actor comes
ﬁrst, the action second as in MAMA COME, KITTY PLAY, KATHY
GO. Exceptions occur when a wrong rule has been deduced, or when
a child is groping towards a rule. And even at the two-word stage,
children are creative in their speech. They use combinations of words
they have not heard before.
However, we have talked so far only about children who are learning
English, which has a ﬁxed word order. But some languages have a
variable order, and mark grammatical relationships with other devices,
such as word endings. How do children cope in these circumstances?
The answer varies from language to language (Slobin 1986a). Turkish
is a language in which the endings are particularly clear and easy to
identify, and Turkish children are reported to adopt consistent endings
with variable word order. But in Serbo-Croatian, where word endings
are confusing and inconsistent, children prefer to disregard the end-
ings and use a ﬁxed word order to begin with, even though there is
variation in the word order used by the adults around them.
In brief, the evidence suggests that children express relationships
between words in a consistent way, whether they use word order or
devices such as word endings. This raises a further question: do children
from different parts of the world express the same relationships?
Apparently, children everywhere say much the same things at the two-
word stage. Roger Brown noted that ‘a rather small set of operations
and relations describe all the meanings expressed . . . whatever the
language they are learning’ (Brown 1973: 198). Because of this

similarity, psycholinguists at one time hoped that they might be able
to make a deﬁnitive list of the concepts expressed at this stage, and
predict their order of emergence. But it soon became apparent that
there was considerable variation between different children, even when
they spoke the same language. Every researcher produced a slightly
different list, organized in a slightly different order.
Perhaps the best-known list was that of Brown (1973: 173). He
suggested a set of eight ‘minimal two-term relations’, supplemented
by three ‘basic operations of reference’, as set out in the chart below.

The examples here show clearly that young children can cope with
different types of meaning relationships. But to what extent do these
two-word utterances embody speciﬁcally linguistic knowledge? At
one time, certain psycholinguists thought that children were born with
an inbuilt understanding of some basic grammatical relations. For
example, it was claimed that the child who said DRINK MILK showed
an innate knowledge of the verb–object relationship (McNeill 1966,
1970). However, most people have now shifted away from this view-
point. As one researcher noted, the assumption that children understand
grammatical relationships in a way comparable to adults is ‘an act of
faith based only on our knowledge of the adult language’ (Bowerman
1973: 187). We must admit that these early utterances do not show
any ﬁrm evidence of speciﬁc linguistic knowledge. They merely reveal
an awareness that meaning relationships need to be expressed con-
sistently.
This leaves us with a considerable problem. If we assume that two-
word utterances show linguistic knowledge (which would be fanciful)

then we have to specify exactly what kind of linguistic grammar we
are dealing with. If, on the other hand, we do not regard them as
showing evidence of grammar, then we have to ﬁnd out when children
start having a primitive syntax. In this case, we have to assume that
language learning is a discontinuous process. Children start with one
kind of system, and then shift over to another, syntactic one. We may
be dealing with a tadpole-to-frog phenomenon (Gleitman and Wanner
1982), in which the immature tadpole behaves rather differently from
the mature frog.
A number of researchers support the notion of discontinuity. Perhaps
children initially use their general cognitive ability to express meaning
relationships in a consistent way. When they have acquired a certain
number, they start to sort them out in their mind. This possibly triggers
an inbuilt syntactic capacity. We shall discuss this possible switch-over
to syntax in Chapter 7.
Getting started
We need to ask a further question. How do children set about acquiring
these early utterances? Do they discover how to express one concept
at a time? Or do they deal with several simultaneously? A psycholinguist
who examined this question was Martin Braine, of pivot grammar
fame. Braine found that children coped with several concepts at the
same time, but used each one in a very restricted set of circumstances
(Braine 1976). For example, just prior to his second birthday, his own
son, Jonathan, could express possession, (MUMMY SHOE), recurrence
(MORE JUICE) and attribution (BIG DOG), but only with a narrow
range of words. In the case of possession, the only possessors were
MOMMY and DADDY. Jonathan had apparently acquired a formula
for dealing with possession, but a formula of very limited scope,
MOMMY or DADDY + object, as in MOMMY SHOE ‘Mummy’s
shoe’, DADDY PIPE ‘Daddy’s pipe.’ Jonathan’s formula for deal-
ing with recurrence was even more limited, consisting of the word
MORE + object. He used this whenever he wanted more food, as
in MORE JUICE, or when he noticed more than one of something,
as in MORE BEE. His attribution formula consisted of the words
BIG or LITTLE + object, as in BIG PLANE, BIG DOG, LITTLE
LAMB, LITTLE DUCK.
Gradually, Jonathan expanded the range of words he used in each
formula. Approximately one month later, he had added extra names
to his possession formula, as in ELLIOT COOKIE ‘Elliot’s cookie’,
ANDREW BOOK ‘Andrew’s book’. He extended his recurrence

formula with the words TWO and OTHER, as in TWO SPOON,
OTHER BALL ‘There’s another ball’. He also attributed the colours
RED, GREEN, BLUE to objects as in RED BALLOON, as well as
the properties OLD and HOT, as in OLD COOKIE, HOT TEA.
Somewhat unexpectedly, he also included the word HURT in his
attribution formula, producing phrases such as HURT KNEE, HURT
HAND, HURT FLY. At around this time he started to express a
new concept, that of location, though he restricted the object located
mainly to the word SAND, as in SAND EYE ‘sand in my eye’, SAND
TOE ‘sand on my toe’. He also began to produce actor–action phrases,
in which he usually chose the word DADDY as actor, as in DADDY
WORK, DADDY SLEEP. The emergence of Jonathan’s limited scope
formulae is set out in the diagram below.

Do all children acquiring language behave like Jonathan? Braine
examined the early utterances of a number of other children, and
concluded that each one had adopted a ‘limited scope formulae’
approach at the two-word stage, though the actual formulae varied
from child to child. Numerous children seem to go about learning
language in a roughly similar fashion, even though there is considerable
individual variation in the precise track they follow.
However, there may be more variation than Braine realized at the
time. It is possible that most of the children studied in the 1960s were
subconsciously picked out because they were easy to understand. And
they were easy to understand because they ﬁtted in with our pre-
conceptions about what happens as children learn to talk – that they

learn single words, then put these words together. But reports then
came in of children who do not behave like this. Some learn whole
sequences of sounds, then only gradually break them down into words,
as with a child called Minh (Peters 1977, 1983). Minh’s words were
often fuzzy and indistinct, but he paid considerable attention to
intonation patterns. Over time, his words became separate and distinct,
but he did not go through the gradual building-up process found in
the speech of many children. As one researcher noted: ‘There is no
one way to learn language. Language learning poses a problem for the
child, and, as with other complex problems, there is no single path
to a solution’ (Nelson 1973: 114).
Where does all this leave us? There is no rigid universal mould into
which all early utterances will ﬁt, even though children express the
same kind of things at the two-word stage. Moreover, these two-
word utterances are patterned in the sense that children express meaning
relationships such as actor–action, location and possession consistently.
But we have not been able to show that these are essentially grammatical
relationships that are being expressed. Consequently, in order to assess
the claim that children’s language is patterned in a strictly linguistic
sense, we must look at later aspects of language acquisition – at the
development of word endings and more complex constructions such
as the rules for negation in English.

‘Wugs’ you should say, if you understand the rules which underlie
English plurals. And that is the reply given almost unanimously by a
group of children who were shown this picture. The researcher wanted
to prove that they hadn’t just memorized each plural as they heard
it, but had an internalized ‘rule’ which could apply even to words
they had never heard (Berko 1958).
And it wasn’t just wugs the children coped with correctly, so no
one could argue that they misunderstood the word as ‘bugs’. Another
picture showed a man standing on the ceiling, with the words: ‘This
is a man who knows how to bing. He is binging. He did the same
thing yesterday. Yesterday he – ?’ ‘Binged’ said nearly all the children
tested. Admittedly, they had higher results for words they already
knew. More children got the plural of GLASS right than the plural of
a nonsense word TASS (TASS and GLASS rhyme in American English,
having the same vowel as the word MASS). But no one can doubt
that they were applying ‘rules’ (linguistic patterns) which they had
worked out for themselves.
An even more striking example of the child’s ability to generalize
patterns is the development of irregular verbs such as COME and
CAME, GO and WENT, BREAK and BROKE. As noted in Chapter
4, children start by acquiring the correct irregular forms for the past
tense, CAME, WENT, BROKE. Some of these are acquired fairly
early, since they are very common words (Ervin 1964; Slobin 1971a).
One might suppose that practice makes perfect, and that these words
would remain correctly formed. But not at all. As soon as children
learn the regular past tense for words such as HELPED, PLAYED,
WALKED and WASHED, they give up using the correct irregular
form, and start using the overgeneralized forms COMED, GOED,
BREAKED. And when they re-acquire the irregular verbs, they ﬁrst
produce semi-regular forms which have a normal ending, as in LOST,
LEFT (Slobin 1971a). All this indicates that children have a strong
tendency to look for and apply ‘rules’ (linguistic patterns), at least as
far as English noun and verb endings are concerned.
This mastery of past tenses has been simulated on a computer,
which went through the same stages as young children. A ‘learning
network’ was presented with sets of verbs, some regular, some irregular.
It connected together verbs and endings by picking up on the frequency
of the forms it was exposed to. First, it learned the irregular verbs,
then it started to over-regularize them, with forms such as GO-ED
and HIT-ED. Finally, it correctly mastered the past tenses of almost
all the verbs fed into it (Plunkett 1995; Elman et al. 1996).

Two opposing conclusions could be drawn from this: either language
learning is straightforward, graspable even by a well-programmed com-
puter; or word endings are a small and not very difﬁcult part of language:
even Genie, the deprived teenager could handle them (Chapter 3). It
is perhaps not surprising that children are able to generalize plurals and
past tenses. After all, word endings tend to rhyme. Children are known
to have a fascination for rhymes, and they frequently make up little
poems such as ‘I am a bug, sitting on a rug, warm and snug, with my
mug.’ So the extension of an -S from BUGS, MUGS and RUGS to
WUGS is not particularly startling.
Incidentally, not all children add on endings straightforwardly. A
partially blind child, Seth, acquired his word endings via ‘phonological
toeholds’. He reproduced the rhythm of the words, and often placed
an indistinct ‘ﬁller’ sound where a syllable should be. But these became
accurate endings only gradually (Peters and Menn 1993).
What further evidence of linguistic patterns can we ﬁnd? We can
note that from the moment children place three or more words together,
they seem to show an instinctive awareness of hierarchical structure, the
realization that several words can ﬁll the same structural ‘slot’ as one:
THAT
FLOWER
THAT
A BLUE FLOWER
PUT
HAT
ON
PUT
THE RED HAT
ON
However, the sentences just quoted look like ordinary adult ones
with a few words left out. This means that we need more evidence
to test the claim that children are operating with an internalized set
of ‘rules’ which do not correspond to the adult ones. Several researchers
have hunted for this evidence, and claim to have found it. Ursula
Bellugi of Harvard University noted: ‘We have found several periods
where the child’s sentences show systematic deviations from adult
language, as if they were constructed according to a different set of
rules’ (Bellugi 1971: 95). She and Edward Klima analysed the develop-
ment of negatives and interrogatives by studying the utterances pro-
duced by the now famous Harvard trio Adam, Eve and Sarah (Klima
and Bellugi 1966). As already noted in Chapter 4, the families of these
children were totally unacquainted and independent of one another,
and each child heard a different set of sentences as ‘input’. Nevertheless,

the children passed through surprisingly similar stages in their progress
towards adult constructions. Each phase was characterized by identiﬁable
patterns and the utterances could not be regarded merely as bad
imitations of adult speech. The children seemed to be devising
hypotheses to account for the regularities in the speech they heard
around them. The development of negative sentences, outlined below,
shows this clearly.
At ﬁrst, Adam, Eve and Sarah seemed to be using a primitive self-
instruction, ‘Put NO or NOT in front of the whole sentence.’
Neg 
Sentence 
NO
WANT STAND HEAD
NO
FRASER DRINK ALL TEA
NO
PLAY THAT
But this phase did not last long. Next came the realization that the
negative goes inside rather than in front of the sentence. The children
devised a new ‘rule’ which said, ‘Put the negative after the ﬁrst noun
phrase and before the rest of the sentence.’
NP 
Neg 
Rest of sentence 
HE
NO
BITE YOU
THAT
NO
MUMMY
I
CAN’T
CATCH YOU
I
DON’T
SIT ON CROMER COFFEE
At this stage, CAN’T and DON’T seemed to be treated as alternatives
to NO. The children had not yet realized that they consisted of two
elements. To them, CAN’T and DON’T were single negative units
which could be substituted for NO or NOT. However, this substitution
was not completely free. Just as in correct adult speech you never ﬁnd
CAN -ING (e.g. *I CAN SINGING) or DON’T -ING (e.g. *I DON’T
SMOKING) – so the children never said *I CAN’T CATCHING
YOU or *I DON’T CRYING. They had grasped the fact that CAN’T
and DON’T do not occur before verbs ending in -ING.

The next stage came when the children realized that CAN’T and
DON’T contained two separate elements, CAN + NOT, DO +
NOT. This was guaranteed by the fact that CAN and DO began to
occur in the children’s speech in non-negative sentences. This led 
to a more sophisticated negative rule in which the negative was placed
in the third slot in a sentence, after the noun and auxiliary or copula
and before the rest of the sentence.
The difference between this and the standard adult rule was that
the children had not yet realized that the tense need only be included
once.
NP 
Aux (or Cop) 
Neg 
Rest of the sentence

WANT SOME SUPPER
I
DID
N’T
SPILLED IT
YOU
DID
N’T
CAUGHT ME
I
AM
NOT
A DOCTOR
THAT
WAS
NOT
ME
A ﬁnal stage occurred when the children amended sentences such as
YOU DIDN’T CAUGHT ME to YOU DIDN’T CATCH ME.
So, independently, Adam, Eve and Sarah each went through similar
intermediate stages in their acquisition of the negative:
1
Neg + Sentence
NO WANT STAND HEAD
2
NP + Neg + VP
HE NO BITE YOU
3
NP + Aux + Neg + Rest of Sentence
I DID N’T CAUGHT IT
Each of these can be regarded as a hypothesis to account for the rules
of negation in English. The ﬁrst is a simple hypothesis. The second
is slightly less simple, and the third is almost the same rule as that
used by adults. Klima and Bellugi are justiﬁed in their remark that ‘It

has seemed to us that the language of children has its own systemacity,
and that the sentences are not just an imperfect copy of those of an
adult’ (Klima and Bellugi 1966: 191).
So Chomsky (1965) may be superﬁcially right to regard the child
as a miniature scientist who makes successive hypotheses to account
for the data. But there is one major difference. When a scientist discards
a hypothesis, he abandons it totally, and works only with the new
one he is testing. Children do not behave like this. The stages do not
follow one another cleanly and suddenly – they overlap quite con-
siderably. As Klima and Bellugi note: ‘A characteristic of child language
is the residue of elements of previous systems’ (Klima and Bellugi
1966: 194). For example, beside I AM NOT A DOCTOR, IT’S
NOT COLD, and THAT WAS NOT ME, the children still produced
sentences such as THIS NOT ICE CREAM, I NOT CRYING,
PAUL NOT TIRED.
This type of ﬂuctuation is noticeable in all aspects of child language.
For example, Roger Brown noted, in the case of word endings, that
children do not ‘abruptly pass from total absence to reliable presence.
There is always a considerable period, varying in length, in which
production-where-required is probabilistic’ (Brown 1973: 257). When
he analysed the speech of the child Sarah, he found extraordinary
swings in her use of the sufﬁx -ING. At the age of 2 years she used
it correctly 50 per cent of the time in sentences such as I (AM)
PLAYING. But 6 months later this had dropped to 20 per cent. One
month after this it shot up to 80 per cent, then went down again to
around 45 per cent. She was over 3 years old before -ING occurred
steadily and correctly in all her utterances.

And it is not only production of speech which fluctuates, but
comprehension also. Richard Cromer tested children’s understanding
of constructions such as THE WOLF IS TASTY TO BITE, THE
WOLF IS HAPPY TO BITE, THE DUCK IS HORRIBLE TO
BITE. Using glove puppets of a wolf and a duck, he asked the subjects
to show him who was biting whom. To his surprise he concluded
that ‘children may be very inconsistent in their answers from one day
to the next’ (Cromer 1970: 405).
What causes this bafﬂing inconsistency? There may be more than
one reason. First, children make mistakes. Just as adults make grammati-
cal errors such as DIDN’T YOU SAW BILL? instead of ‘Didn’t you
see Bill?’ or ‘Didn’t you say you saw Bill?’, so do children. But this
does not mean the utterances are random jumbles of words. The
patterns are there, despite lapses. A second reason for inconsistency
may be selective attention. Children may choose to concentrate on
one aspect of speech at a time. If Sarah was working out rules for
plurals one month, she may have ignored the -ING ending temporarily.
As a schoolboy learning Latin said, ‘If I get the verb endings right,
you can’t expect me to get the nouns right as well!’
However, mistakes and selective attention cannot account completely
for the extreme ﬂuctuations in Sarah’s use of -ING. Linguists have
realized that inconsistency is a normal transitional stage as children
move from one hypothesis to the next. It seems to occur when a
child has realized that her ‘old’ pattern is wrong or partially wrong,
and has formulated a new one, but remains confused as to the precise
instances in which she should abandon her older primitive rule (Cromer
1970). For example, Cromer suggested that when they hear sentences
such as THE DUCK IS READY TO BITE, children start out with
a rule which says ‘The ﬁrst noun in the sentence is doing the biting.’
As they get older, they become aware that this simple assumption
does not always work. But they are not quite sure why or when their
rule fails. So they experiment with a second rule, ‘Sometimes it is the
ﬁrst noun in the sentence which is doing the biting, but not always.’
When a child has made an inference that is only partially right, he
can get very bewildered. Partially correct rules often produce right
results for the wrong reasons, as in sentences such as I DON’T WANT
IT, where DON’T is treated as a single negative element. A further
example of the confusion caused by a partially effective rule was seen
in the Harvard child Adam’s use of the pronoun IT. He produced
‘odd’ sentences such as MUMMY GET IT LADDER, SAW IT BALL,
alongside correct ones such as GET IT, PUT IT THERE. He appeared
to be treating IT as parallel in behaviour to THAT which can occur

either by itself, or attached to a noun: BRING ME THAT, BRING
ME THAT BALL. 
BRING ME
IT (BALL)
BRING ME
THAT (BALL)
( ) Parentheses denote optional items.
But this was not the only wrong conclusion Adam reached. He also
wrongly assumed that IT had an obligatory -S when it occurred at
the beginning of a sentence, so he produced IT’S FELL, IT’S HAS
WHEELS, as well as superﬁcially correct utterances such as IT’S BIG.
Presumably this error arose because Adam’s mother used a large number
of sentences starting with IT’S . . .: IT’S RAINING, IT’S COLD and
so on. When Adam’s ‘funny’ rules produced correct results half the
time, it is not surprising that he took time to abandon them.
Perhaps the situation will become clearer if we look in detail at the
emergence of one particular wrong word ending in the speech of one
child.
Consider the following utterances produced by a child named Sally
when she was nearly 3:
ME MADEN THAT
ME TIPPEN THAT OVER
ME HADEN STAWBERRIES AT LUNCHTIME
ME JUST BUYEN IT
SOMETHING MAKEN A FUNNY NOISE.
Sally seemed to have decided that one way to deal with the past was
to add -EN on to the ends of verbs. How did this strange personal
‘rule’ emerge? Did Sally just wake up one morning and start saying
TIPPEN OVER, BUYEN, MADEN, or what happened? Fletcher
(1983) examined Sally’s verbs ending in -EN in some detail (her
progress was also recorded in Fletcher (1985), where she was called
Sophie). He started recording her speech one November when she
was almost 21⁄2 years old. She began producing verbs ending in -EN
in December. That month, there were three of them: BROKEN
(which occurred thirteen times), then FALLEN (once) and TAKEN
(once). Note that these three are all forms which actually occur in
adult speech, even though Sally used them in her own idiosyncratic
way, to denote a simple past tense. In the middle of January a new

form, PUTTEN, emerged, alongside the existing three. This was 
the ﬁrst non-existent form which she produced. In February, Sally
used two more existing forms, GIVEN and EATEN, and eight more
invented forms: BOUGHTEN, BUILDEN, RIDEN, GETTEN,
CUTTEN, MADEN, WANTEN, TOUGHEN. The peak of Sally’s
inventiveness came in March when she added on one actual word,
WAKEN, and eighteen made-up ones: HADEN, STEPPEN,
HURTEN, LEAVEN, BRINGEN, COMEN, DRAWNEN,
HITTEN, LETTEN, RUNNEN, WASEN, SEE-EN, ROCKEN,
HELPEN, SPOILEN, MAKEN, TIPPEN, HAVEN. In April, there
were no new forms noted, but in May nine new invented ones
appeared: LETTEN, WRAPPEN, SHOULDEN, HIDEN, WALKEN,
BUYEN, CLOSEN, PLAYEN and a strange verb CAVEN, whatever
Sally meant by that. In June the real form BITTEN was added. In
July, a mere three invented forms emerged, WEAREN, LEAVEN,
LIKEN, then in August just one, STAYEN. This was the last of the
invented forms. Finally, an actual one, FORGOTTEN, appeared in
December. The rise and fall of forms in -EN took just 9 months. This
is represented on the graph below.
What can we learn from this? Of course, Sally’s speech was not
recorded every moment of the day, so there may be some element
of chance in the data. But she was probably recorded often enough
(two or three times a week) for the sequence of events presented here
to be reasonably reliable.
First, Sally seems to have picked out from adult speech several
words ending in -EN which actually occur. She may well have heard

them in sentences such as YOU’VE BROKEN IT, I’VE TAKEN
YOUR DOLL upstairs, and failing to take notice of the shortened
form ‘VE (HAVE), she perhaps believed that she was dealing with a
simple past tense – though this is speculation. What we do know is
that she spent over a month using a small number of actual forms,
and one in particular, BROKEN, which kept recurring. She then
perhaps experimentally brought in a new one, PUTTEN. Her
hypothesis that -EN was a correct ending was probably conﬁrmed by
hearing more actual -EN forms, since her next new form was GIVEN.
She then became conﬁdent in her -EN endings, and had a surge of
them in February and March. Soon after, she began to have doubts,
and forms in -EN started to tail off, while Fletcher noted that her
verbs ending in -ED were gradually increasing at this time, occurring
in sentences such as:
ME CALLED IT PEANUT BUTTER.
SOME MILK DRIPPED, DROPPED ON THE FLOOR.
Eventually, the overgeneralized forms in -EN faded away completely.
(Sally’s overall progress was discussed in Fletcher 1985.)
This scenario suggests that a new construction works its way into
a child’s speech in a manner similar to that found in language change.
In language change, ﬁrst of all a few words get the new pronunciation,
though not every time they occur. Then, when these few have acquired
a ﬁrm hold, the change spreads rapidly to a large number of other
words. Then finally, the change slowly rounds up the stragglers
(Aitchison 2001). The word by word progress of a change through
the vocabulary is known as lexical diffusion. In the case of Sally, the
situation started off normally. The new ending got a ﬁrm footing in
a few words, then spread rapidly to a large number. But as Sally had
made a false hypothesis, the overgeneralized forms gradually decreased
in number, then disappeared.
But how did Sally ever discover that her MAKEN, PUTTEN,
BUILDEN forms were wrong? Children are not often receptive to
correction, as we saw earlier (Chapter 4). So how do they discover
their errors? This is a complex problem, which we shall return to in
the next chapter. In this case, however, there may be a simple answer.
Children seem to expect different words to mean different things, an
expectation which has been called ‘the principle of contrast’ (Clark
1987). When she heard someone say, perhaps, DADDY BUILT THAT
SNOWMAN, Sally may have realized that this was equivalent to her

own DADDY BUILDEN THAT SNOWMAN. This may have led
her to reassess her own ‘rule’, and eventually emend it.
We must conclude, then, that children are not just copying adult
utterances when they speak. They seem to be following rules they
devise themselves, and which produce systematic divergences from
the adult output. Chomsky (1965) may have been partly on the right
track in attributing to children an innate hypothesis-forming device
which enables them to form increasingly complex theories about the
rules which underlie the patterns of the language they are exposed to.
Like scientists, children are constantly testing new hypotheses. But, as
we have seen, the scientist metaphor falls down in one vital respect.
Scientists, once they have discarded a hypothesis, forget about it and
concentrate on a new one. Children, on the other hand, appear to
go through periods of experimentation and indecision in which two
or more hypotheses overlap and ﬂuctuate: each rule wavers for a long
time, perhaps months, before it is ﬁnally adopted or ﬁnally abandoned.
Also, children’s hypotheses often apply only to rather small corners
of language at a time. Occasionally one ﬁnds a broad sweeping ‘rule’
such as ‘Put NO in front of the sentence to negate it.’ But this type
of across-the-board generalization is quite rare, and mostly children
concentrate on much smaller pieces of structure. Language acquisition
is turning out to be a much messier process than was once assumed.
One further point needs to be stressed. Children make the right
kind of guesses about language. Their hypotheses are within a rather
narrow range of possibilities. They are naturally equipped to have
sensible linguistic hunches. This is a great feat, considering how bafﬂed
humans are by the vocal communication of other species:
There were three little owls in a wood,
Who sang hymns whenever they could.
What the words were about
One could never make out,
But one felt it was doing them good.
(Anon.)
Or, as a psychologist expressed human linguistic ability using some-
what more elegant phrases:
The fact that the brain can tolerate variation in language trans-
mission and reception, despite different environmental inputs and
still achieve the target capacity (being a native speaker of a natural
language, perhaps several) provides support for a genetic component

underlying language acquisition that is nevertheless biologically
‘ﬂexible’ (neurologically plastic).
(Petitto 2005: 100)
We can now summarize the main conclusions of this chapter. In
spite of difﬁculties connected with interpreting the data, we have
come to some ﬁrm conclusions. Children automatically ‘know’ that
language is patterned, and they seem to make a succession of hypotheses
about the rules underlying the speech they hear around them. However,
these hypotheses overlap and ﬂuctuate in a way that the hypotheses
of scientists do not.
We also considered whether there is a universal framework under-
lying early speech. We noted that children everywhere seem to produce
roughly comparable utterances at the two-word stage. However, it
would be an exaggeration to claim that this represents a ‘universal
framework’. All we can say is that children at this stage tend to express
similar meaning relationships in a consistent way.
Therefore, in order to assess whether Chomsky was right in his
assumption that children learning language make use of fairly speciﬁc
outline facts which could be inbuilt, we must look in more detail at
the way children cope with acquiring speech beyond the two-word
stage. We also need to consider whether there are other plausible ways
of explaining language development. This will be the topic of the
next chapter.

Exactly how do children learn
language?
Teach your child to hold his tongue, he’ll learn fast enough to speak. 
Benjamin Franklin
Children learn language so efﬁciently and so fast because they know
in outline how languages behave. So far, it has not been very difﬁcult
to show that children have some inkling of what languages are like.
They seem to realise that language is rule-governed – that a ﬁnite
number of principles govern the enormous number of utterances they
hear going on around them. They also have an instinctive awareness
that languages are hierarchically structured – the knowledge that several
words can go in the same structural slot as one. A child might say:
I LOVE
TEDDY
or
I LOVE
MY TEDDY
or
I LOVE
MY OLD BLUE TEDDY
Furthermore, children realize that language makes use of operations
which are structure-dependent, so that each ‘slot’ in a sentence functions
as a unit which can be moved around, as in:
WHERE
MY TEDDY?
DON’T TAKE
MY TEDDY
AWAY
MY TEDDY
HERE
However, an inbuilt knowledge that language is rule-governed, that
it has a hierarchical structure, and that it makes use of structure-

dependent operations by no means explains the whole of language
acquisition. We still need to know exactly how children develop
language ability so efﬁciently. We would also like to ﬁnd out why
many English children follow similar paths in the development of their
language. These are mysteries which cannot just be swept aside with
vague assumptions of ‘innate programming’. We must investigate the
matter more fully.
Content Cuthbert or Process Peggy?
Over the past half century, two types of explanation have been put
forward to account for the seemingly mysterious nature of language
acquisition. First of all, there was Chomsky’s content approach. Second,
an alternative, and possibly more plausible, process approach has been
proposed. What is the difference between these two? Brieﬂy, a content
approach postulates that a child’s brain naturally contains a considerable
amount of speciﬁc information about language. A process approach,
on the other hand, suggests that children have inbuilt puzzle-solving
equipment which enables them to process the linguistic data they come
across. Each of these approaches has inspired a considerable amount
of research. Both therefore need to be looked at carefully.
A content approach, such as Chomsky’s, claimed that children come
to language learning with certain expectations. They are pre-wired
with some quite speciﬁc information about language, and so approach
the data they hear with advance knowledge. Of course Chomsky has
never assumed that this knowledge is ready waiting, the moment the
child is born. It takes time to mature. But when the time is right, it
requires relatively little exposure to language for the knowledge to
emerge. It may be like the growth of teeth or breasts. Given normal
surroundings, these appear without any great effort on the part of the
acquirer.
However, Chomsky’s theory that children innately contain large
chunks of speciﬁc information about language always was, and still is
disputed. Other researchers claim that, instead of possessing advance
information, children are born with some sort of processing mechanism
which enables them to analyse linguistic data. They suggest that:
the child’s mind is somehow ‘set’ in a predetermined way to
process the sorts of structures which characterize human language
. . . That is not to say that the grammatical system itself is given
as innate knowledge, but that the child has innate means of
processing information and forming internal structures, and that

when these capacities are applied to the speech he hears he succeeds
in constructing a grammar of his native language.
(Slobin 1971b: 56)
The crucial point is this: are children wired with prior knowledge
about language, as Chomsky has suggested? Or do they come equipped
with special techniques for performing linguistic analysis? Are children’s
heads loaded with information? Or with puzzle-solving equipment?
Are we dealing with a ‘Content Cuthbert’ or a ‘Process Peggy’?
In both the content and process approaches the child may end up
with the same type of grammar. But in the second case it is the result
of analytic procedures. Information was not there at the beginning.
Because the end result may be the same in both cases, it is sometimes
claimed that the two points of view are virtually indistinguishable, and
should be regarded as two sides of one coin. But there is a crucial
difference. Chomsky’s content approach presupposes that the pre-
wired knowledge is speciﬁc to language, and is independent of general
intelligence. But the process approach comes in two versions, an
intelligent Peggy and a linguistic Peggy. In the intelligent version,
Peggy makes use of the same general cognitive abilities as she would
to cope with everything else she comes across in the world. In the
linguistic version, her processing mechanisms are geared speciﬁcally

to language. So are we dealing with a Content Cuthbert? an intelligent
Process Peggy? or a linguistic Process Peggy? We shall consider each
of these possibilities in turn.
Does Content Cuthbert exist?
If Chomsky was correct, then we would expect to ﬁnd evidence for
Content Cuthbert displayed in at least two ways. First, children would
be aware of universal constraints. They could never utter a sentence
that would be an impossible one for human languages. Second, they
would take dramatic steps forward as they ‘set switches’ (Chapter 5).
Let us see if either of these things happen.
Let us begin with universal constraints. If children are aware of
these, then anything quite weird will be ruled out by ‘a biological
mandate against wild grammars’ (Goodluck 1986: 55). This ensures
that ‘each developing grammar will fall within the bounds of adult
language systems as characterized by linguistic theory’ (Goodluck 
1986: 64).
So do children always obey universal constraints? This might seem
a strange question to ask. After all, adults don’t produce strange sentences
such as:
*WHICH PIG ANGELA KNOWS WHO HAS STOLEN? (p. 106.)
Surely, therefore, we are quite unlikely to ﬁnd equally odd sentences
in child language?
Surprisingly, perhaps, a 3-year old boy called Seth has produced a
series of ‘forbidden’ utterances (Wilson and Peters 1988). Consider
the following:
Seth:
WE’RE GONNA LOOK AT SOME HOUSES WITH
JOHNNIE.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA LOOK FOR SOME?
WHAT ARE WE GONNA LOOK FOR SOME WITH
JOHNNIE?
Seth appears to have picked on the phrase SOME HOUSES. He has
then replaced HOUSES with the word WHAT, and brought this
WH-word to the front, but left the word SOME behind. Supposedly,
(according to Chomsky) children should know automatically that it
is impossible to split up a phrase such as SOME HOUSES, and move
half of it away. And this was not an isolated example, so cannot be

attributed to a chance mistake. This ‘prohibited’ construction occurred
several times, as when Seth was sorting through magnetic letters:
Seth:
IS THIS A FUNNY T?
Father:
NO, THAT’S A FUNNY I.
Seth (holding up another): WHAT IS THIS A FUNNY, DAD?
A possible reason for Seth’s extraordinary behaviour is that he is
partially blind. Because of this, his father often asked him to ﬁnish off
sentences, as when playing with the magnetic letters:
Father:
THAT’S A . . .
Seth:
ALEPH
Father:
THAT’S A NICE . . .
Seth:
OTHER KAF.
So Seth may have assumed that it was necessary to have a word
following the verb at the end of a sentence. At the same time, he
knew that WH-words had to go to the front. When he combined
these two ‘rules of thumb’, he produced the ‘impossible’ sentences.
Seth ended up chopping the strange sentences out of his speech,
so they were only a small detour on the way to ﬂuent English. But
Seth’s case suggests that children are not pre-wired with absolute
information about language universals from the beginning. They may
need to get there gradually, especially if they are in any way disadvan-
taged, as Seth was.
The gradual acquisition of (presumed) universal constraints is
supported by another study, which looked at them from the point of
view of comprehension.
One American linguist set out to discover how children understand
sentences involving the phrase EACH OTHER (Matthei 1981). Now
if you have a sentence such as:
THE BOYS WANTED THE GIRLS TO LIKE EACH OTHER.
the only possible interpretation is that each girl should like all the
other girls. Any other interpretation, according to Chomsky, would
go against universal constraints. So a number of children between the
ages of 4 and 6 were presented with sentences such as:
THE CHICKENS SAID THAT THE PIGS TICKLED EACH OTHER.
They were asked to perform the actions described with farmyard
animals. Unfortunately for Chomsky, most of them seemed quite
unaware of the proposed constraints. The majority interpreted the

sentence as if the chickens and pigs were tickling one another, though
a few made the chickens tickle one another. In fact, it has been
repeatedly shown that young children often do not pay attention to
the syntax, and either answer at random, or utilize a ‘probable world
strategy’, that is, interpret sentences by arranging the words to give
the most plausible meaning (Cromer 1976).
Of course, one can always argue that the child really ‘knew’ about
the constraint, but failed to reveal this knowledge. Perhaps the
experiment was badly designed, or the youngsters did not fully
understand what they had been asked to do. Or perhaps the children
were simply ‘overloaded’, in that they had been asked to cope with
too many things at once. A child forced to deal simultaneously with
language and non-verbal responses might appear less competent than
he or she really is (Hamburger and Crain 1984).
But the most plausible conclusion is that children do not have any
ﬁrm, ﬁxed beliefs about language as they acquire it. So far, they do
not seem to know what to look for, or what to avoid – though some
of this knowledge clearly develops over the course of time. Let us
now consider Chomsky’s later ‘switch-setting’ views.
Do children ‘set switches’?
Universal Grammar (UG) is partly like a switchboard with its switches
in neutral position, according to Chomsky (Chapter 5). Children know
in advance about the possible routes which languages can take. But
they have to ﬁnd out which particular option has been selected by
the language they are learning. Once they discover this, they ﬂick
each switch, and ‘the system functions’. Is this true?
Chomsky himself is somewhat vague about how many switches
there are, and what they switch. But one possible switch, he has
suggested, is ‘head position’ (Chapter 5). Children might know in
advance that linguistic structures have a head (key word), and that
languages tend to put the modifiers (words relating to the head)
consistently either before or after it. So, to repeat the English example
given on p. 109, English children might say:
THE DOG DROPPED(H) THAT SLIPPER(M) DOWN(H) THE DRAIN(M)
with heads (H) preceding modiﬁers (M), while Turkish children would
reverse this order, and say the equivalent of:
THE DOG THE DRAIN(M) DOWN(H) THE SLIPPER(M) DROPPED(H)
with modiﬁers preceding heads. Does this suggestion work?

At ﬁrst sight, this is a plausible idea. Children are on the whole
consistent in their treatment of heads and modiﬁers. But on second
thoughts, this may be because youngsters are sensitive to the order of
the words they hear. There is no need to assume an English child has
‘set a parameter’ when it says WANT MILK, rather than *MILK
WANT. It just listened to its mother saying: ‘Do you want some
milk?’ and remembered the word order. Furthermore, if a switch had
been set, we would expect children to iron out various inconsistencies.
They should say *AGO TWO WEEKS instead of TWO WEEKS
AGO, where the modiﬁer occurs (exceptionally) after the words it
modiﬁes. But they show no real signs of behaving like this.
Perhaps the biggest weakness of the switch-setting theory is that no
one can agree how many switches there are, nor how exactly they are
set (Roeper and Williams 1987). This may be because language acquisi-
tion is just too messy a process to be explained by the ﬂick of a switch.
Let us now summarize our conclusions about Content Cuthbert.
This approach does not seem to be borne out by the evidence. Children
do not appear to have ﬁrm advance expectations about language. They
do not necessarily steer clear of sentences which are prohibited by
language universals. They do not acquire chunks of language by ﬂicking
a switch. Of course, Chomskyan language universals may still exist.
But they are not there ‘ready to go’ at a relatively early stage, triggered
by simple data, and requiring very little effort on the child’s part, as
Chomsky has suggested. Let us now consider whether Process Peggy
provides a better explanation for language acquisition.
Is Process Peggy a general problem solver?
The most general process approach proposes that Process Peggy simply
makes use of a wider set of puzzle-solving abilities which she brings
to bear on the world as a whole. Proponents of this viewpoint put
forward various non-linguistic factors which they consider to be critical
for guiding the child forward through the thickets of language. We
shall consider two of these: children’s needs and their general mental
development.
According to an ‘everyday needs’ approach, children are by nature
sociable little animals who need to interact with other humans. They
also have certain material needs, such as MILK or JUICE. They are
therefore concerned primarily with interacting with other people, and
with getting what they want. They acquire speech in order to help
them in this quest (e.g. Donaldson 1978). Within a particular culture,
there is relatively little variation in the interests and requirements of

different children. Therefore, it is not surprising that children develop
language in a parallel fashion, even though they have never met one
another.
This viewpoint is certainly borne out by children in the very early
stages of development. As we noted in Chapter 6, children all over
the world seem to talk about very similar things at the two-word
stage. We ﬁnd requests such as WANT MILK, rejections such as NO
WASH, questions such as WHERE DADDY?, and so on, in widely
separated children. Some researchers have suggested that this state of
affairs lasts throughout the language learning period. They argue that
children are concerned primarily with the external world, both with
ﬁnding out about it, and with getting what they want. As youngsters
attempt to learn about and manipulate some aspect of their environ-
ment, they look for ways to talk about it. Language, therefore, mirrors
the preoccupations of the child at each stage.
In a trivial way, this is undoubtedly true, in that children talk about
the things which concern them. But it cannot explain why children
proceed to further stages of language development when their own
primitive structures have the desired effect. For example, if a child says
WHERE KITTY? She is likely to be told what she wants to know –
where the cat is. Why, therefore, should she, and most other children,
proceed to (probably) WHERE KITTY GO?, then some weeks or
months later to WHERE KITTY HAS GONE? and ﬁnally to WHERE
HAS KITTY GONE? In brief, the argument that the child learns
language in order to help her to manipulate the world does not explain
why she does not stop learning as soon as she starts obtaining what
she wants, nor why we ﬁnd similar structural developments in different
children.
A child called John provides further problems for the notion that
children develop language in order to cope with everyday needs
(Blank et al. 1979). John used language creatively, and had a ﬁrm grasp
of linguistic structures – but he did not use language to communicate.
He disliked interacting with others so much that he never spoke
directly to anyone, even his parents. He simply talked to himself as
he played with his toys: ‘Let’s go shopping. Where’s the money? OK
here’s the change. Open the door. Pretend it’s a shopping centre. OK
get elevator. Push button.’ John provides evidence against the view
that children are sociable beings who cater for their needs by communi-
cating with others.
Let us, therefore, look at another factor, which may be important
in understanding the stages by which children acquire language. This
is general mental development, or rather, general cognitive development

as it is more usually expressed. Some people have suggested that
language acquisition is both dependent on it, and caused by it. Like
the ‘everyday needs’ view, such a belief is obviously justiﬁed to a
limited extent, since ‘It is tautological that linguistic development
presupposes cognitive development in the uninteresting sense that one
cannot express a concept that one doesn’t have’ (Fodor et al. 1974:
463). Certain concepts seem to be easier for children to grasp than
others. For example, English, Italian, Turkish and Serbo-Croatian
children were asked to describe where an object such as a nut was
placed in relation to one or more other items, such as plates or glasses
(Johnston and Slobin 1979; Slobin 1982). They could all cope with
the nut being IN, ON, BESIDE or UNDER a plate before they
could describe it as being BETWEEN two plates.
It is also true that certain cognitive abilities and language structures
tend to emerge at similar times. For example, one researcher claimed
that the development of comparative constructions (I AM BIGGER
THAN YOU) occurs at a time when the child can recognize that a
pint of milk remains the same whether it is poured into a long thin
container or a short fat one (Sinclair-de-Zwart 1969). However, the
simultaneous development of different abilities does not prove that
one is dependent on the other, since in the normal child, many aspects
of growth take place at around the same time. As one researcher noted
‘Hair growth and language development might be positively correlated,
but few psycholinguists would wish to posit interesting links between
the two’ (Curtiss 1981).
Perhaps the best way to test whether language acquisition and
cognitive development are inextricably linked is to search for children
who show some discrepancy between cognitive and linguistic abilities.
If such a discrepancy can be found, then clearly the link is not an
inevitable one. And there are reports of several children whose general
cognitive development is unrelated to their grasp of language structure.
Consider Laura, earlier known under the pseudonym Marta (Yamada
1988, 1990). Laura had been a limp, ﬂoppy infant. In spite of coming
from a loving, supportive home, her general development was delayed.
She could not sit alone until she was 15 months old. She was also
severely mentally retarded, and as a teenager was unable to perform
tasks which even normal 2-year-olds can carry out successfully. When
she was given a stack of pictures to sort, she did not separate humans
from objects, as normal children tend to do. She did not understand
numbers, and did not know her age. Her short-term memory was
limited, and she could not repeat back sequences of more than three
unrelated items.

In contrast, her speech was ﬂuent and sometimes richly structured,
and had apparently been so since around the age of 9. When her
speech was studied in her teens, she produced sentences such as:
SHE DOES PAINTINGS, THIS REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF THE KIDS
WHO I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH LAST YEAR, AND REALLY LOVED.
She used syntactic structures which are acquired relatively late in
normal development, such as ‘full’ passives as in:
I GOT IT CUT ALREADY BY A MAID (when talking about her hair).
I DON’T WANT TO GET EATEN BY ONE (about crocodiles at the zoo).
Laura was not just repeating back sentences she’d heard, as shown
by occasional errors, as in:
WHEN I FIRST WENT THERE THREE TICKETS WERE GAVE OUT BY A
POLICE LAST YEAR.
She could also repeat back correctly a sentence such as:
AN APPLE WAS EATEN BY JENI.
This construction is difﬁcult for children who have not acquired the
passive.
But the passive was not the only advanced construction she had
acquired. Consider:
I SHOULD’VE BROUGHT IT BACK.
I DON’T LIKE HIM PUTTIN’ PAPER TOWELS IN MY MOUTH.
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT ME NOT GOING TO THIS SCHOOL?
HE WAS SAYING THAT I LOST MY BATTERY-POWERED WATCH
THAT I LOVED.
These all show a considerable degree of linguistic sophistication as far
as syntax is concerned.
But Laura’s speech was by no means ‘normal’. Her utterances were
often semantically odd, or inappropriate, as in:
I WAS 16 LAST YEAR AND NOW I’M 19 THIS YEAR .
I WAS LIKE 15 OR 19 WHEN I STARTED MOVING OUT O’ HOME.

SHE WAS THINKING THAT IT’S NO REGULAR SCHOOL, IT’S JUST
PLAIN OLD NO BUSES.
WELL, WE WERE TAKING A WALK, MY MOM, AND THERE WAS THIS
GIANT, LIKE MY MOTHER THREW A STICK.
In brief, she was able to deal with the structure of language to a
perhaps surprising extent, but found it difﬁcult to cope with the type
of concepts which language normally expresses.
Genie, the Californian girl whose development was outlined in
Chapter 4, illustrates the reverse situation (Curtiss 1977). Genie was
able to cope with complex feelings and concepts, but her ability to
deal with language structure was minimal. She expressed herself mainly
by means of content words strung together with little syntactic struc-
ture as in: THINK ABOUT MAMA LOVE GENIE, or DENTIST
SAY DRINK WATER. Her utterances were appropriate, and often
conceptually sophisticated, even though telegraphic, as in:
Adult:
HOW MANY SIDES DOES A TRIANGLE HAVE?
Genie:
THREE.
Adult:
HOW MANY SIDES DOES A CIRCLE HAVE?
Genie:
ROUND.
As Curtiss noted: ‘Genie’s semantic sophistication suggests a conceptual
level far surpassing what one would imagine from her otherwise rather
primitive utterances’ (1981: 21) – an impression borne out by her
relatively good performance in a wide range of intelligence tests.
Laura, therefore, showed that severe conceptual deﬁcits can exist
alongside a surprisingly developed language ability, while Genie
illustrated the opposite – that conceptual ability can outstrip language
structure. These case studies suggest that cognitive development cannot
provide the deﬁnitive key to the acquisition of language structure –
even though it is clearly important for meaningful communication.
But Laura and Genie are not the only ones who showed a bizarre
mismatch between linguistic and general cognitive abilities. Christopher,
a multilingual savant, and Kate, a savant poet, are two gifted but dis-
advantaged individuals whose use of language massively outweighs
their other mental abilities. A savant, incidentally, is someone who
has exceptional skills in one particular area (Treffert 1989/1990).
Judging from the literature, most savants have either musical or
mathematical skills. But Christopher and Kate are both savant linguists.

Christopher is a man, now over 40, who is unable to look after
himself. Yet he can speak English perfectly well. In addition, he is
obsessed by languages other than his own, and can translate ﬂuently
from over a dozen. Here is a translation by Christopher from Polish,
followed by an accurate version (Smith and Tsimpli 1995: 15):
Christopher’s translation:
‘I had to take him out of the car strongly
and put – he put himself on the ﬂoor and
opened his eyes – and shut his eyes, not
wishing to see what was waiting for him.’
Accurate version:
‘I had to throw him into the car with force.
He lay down on the ﬂoor and closed his
eyes, not wishing to see what awaited him.’
Kate is over 40, but her case is equally strange. Her mental age has
been assessed at around that of a 7-year-old. She cannot solve even
the simplest verbal intelligence test problems, and has huge difﬁculties
using language in everyday situations. Yet she is judged by professionals
in English literature to be a highly gifted poet. Over half her poems
describe her own problems (Dowker et al. 1996):
I got it;
my disability;
not never to walk from it.
It shares my space,
breathes the same air.
I cannot have a day off.
Or, as she said in another poem:
I lost the me
It got under everything
that was not poems.
Christopher and Kate show that language can not only be spared,
but even enriched, when other cognitive abilities are impaired. So far,
then, we have argued that language seems to be a special skill. In
occasional cases, it can be partially separated from general cognitive
ability.
But normal children do not just acquire language by lucky chance.
They exploit the helpfulness of those around, and (mostly) pay attention
to what they say.

Caregiver language
NO, YOU SHOULDN’T MAKE A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM.
NO, LET DADDY DO IT FIRST.
NO, I DON’T THINK YOU’LL BE ABLE TO CUT STRAIGHT.
NO, DON’T CUT TOO MUCH ON THE FRONT.
NO, I DON’T THINK YOU SHOULD PUT MORE HOLES IN IT.
NO, DON’T CUT TWO HOLES.
These six examples of NO placed in front of the sentence occurred
in a 15-minute recording session in which 2-year-old Nicholas was
‘helping’ his father to carve a pumpkin (De Villiers and De Villiers
1979). This construction seemed to be a favourite one for Nicholas’s
father. Not surprisingly, the majority of Nicholas’s early negatives (76
per cent) involved opposition to some suggestion proposed by his
parents, and his means of expressing this was by placing NO in front
of the sentence, as in NO DADDY DRESS ME.
Faced with such examples, a number of people have suggested that
motherese, caretaker language, or caregiver language (speech addressed to
children) can solve the mystery of how children acquire language so
efﬁciently. Children, according to this view, absorb and copy the
speech they hear around them. They learn so fast, it is claimed, because
speech addressed to children is rather different from that to adults
(Chapter 4), and so grabs their attention. In many communities, this
special way of talking to children begins as soon as the baby is born:
Wha’s a matter, Bobby, yo’ widdle tum-tum all empty? Here you
are, a growin’ boy, and dese folks won’t feed you. You tell ’em,
they can’t just let you cry, not while Aunt Sue is ‘round . . .
You’re a-gonna be a big boy, just like your daddy. Mamma gonna
hafta get some new rompers soon . . . Okay, okay, look, look,
there’s mamma, she’s comin’, she gonna get dat bottle right now
and get it ready for you. It’s a hungry boy, it is.
(Heath 1983: 118)
This stream of speech was addressed to Bobby by a helpful neighbour
when he was only a month or so old. It contains many of the
characteristics found repeatedly in child-directed speech (Ferguson
1978). It tends to be slower, spoken with higher pitch, and with
exaggerated intonation contours. The utterances are shorter, with the
average length being approximately one-third of that found in speech

addressed to adults (Newport, Gleitman and Gleitman 1977). The
sentences are well-formed, simple in structure and repetitious, in that
the same lexical items recur, though in slightly different combinations.
Special ‘baby’ words are sometimes used, such as DOGGIE, BIRDIE,
GEE-GEE, CHUFF-CHUFF, TUM-TUM.The topic is usually related
to the ‘here and now’ – things that are present both in place and
time.
Yet the link between caregiver speech and child language is not
always straightforward. And ‘repairs’ – cases in which caregivers try
to ‘mend’ a communication which has been ignored or misinterpreted
– turn out to be too infrequent to be of consistent use. Meanwhile,
reformulations such as:
OPEN YOUR MOUTH. OPEN IT.
SPIT OUT THE SNAIL, SPIT THE SNAIL OUT. SPIT IT OUT.
GIVE MUMMY THE SNAIL. GIVE THE SNAIL TO MUMMY.
account for only around 4 per cent of maternal speech, it has been
claimed (Shatz 1982).
So is Chomsky right in his belief (outlined in Chapter 5) that what
children hear is ‘fairly degenerate in quality’ (1965: 31)? Or has he
never listened to parent-child conversation? Let us consider the matter
more carefully.
For a start, it seems reasonable to expect that words and constructions
which occur frequently in adult speech will be produced early by
children. And this certainly seems to be borne out in some studies.
For example, in the development of verbal auxiliaries (words such as
can, will, might, have, etc.) the order of acquisition roughly follows the
frequency of these words in adult speech (Wells 1979).
Statistically, therefore, there is a link between items produced
frequently by parents, and those acquired early by the child. But the
problem with statistical correlations is that they do not hold for every
construction, nor for every child. Furthermore, correlations which are
valid for groups of people can sometimes disappear when each individual
child and its parents are examined separately (Wells 1979, 1986). We
must conclude, therefore, that overall frequency of use is only a rough
guide to the order of acquisition, and is by no means a deﬁnitive map.
Since simple frequency counts have not proved entirely helpful,
some researchers have suggested that motherese directs child language
in a more subtle way. They have proposed that parents have an inbuilt
sensitivity to their children. According to this view, parents gradually

increase the complexity of their speech as the child becomes ready
for each new stage. This has sometimes been called the ‘ﬁne-tuning’
hypothesis (Cross 1977), in the sense that parents subconsciously
attune their output to their child’s needs. And a few people have
claimed that, far from children possessing an innate language learning
device, mothers possess an innate language teaching device! Those
who support this viewpoint assume that there will be a close correlation
between the structure of the mother’s speech and that of the child at
every stage of development. Is this true?
Research conﬁrms that parents attune their speech to their children’s
needs, but suggests they attune them to a child’s interests, more than
to his or her language structure. That is, parents talk about topics
which are relevant to the child such as picking up blocks or drinking
juice, but show no evidence that they are grading their syntax, or
introducing constructions one at a time, as one might expect if they
were subconsciously guiding their children from one stage of language
to another. There is no sign of a step-by-step programme, except in
the broad general sense that as the child gets older, the parents’ speech
tends to become less repetitious, with longer sentences and more
complex subject matter. Moreover, researchers who examined the
speech of fifteen mothers interacting with their young daughters,
concluded that if one was designing a curriculum for language teaching,
motherese was highly unsuitable! (Newport et al. 1977). In a good
language teaching programme, you would expect teachers to introduce
constructions one at a time and to concentrate ﬁrst on simple active
declarative sentences (TOBY WANTS A BATH, or MARION IS
EATING A BUN), then move on to constructions in which words
are omitted or the order shifted round as in imperatives (TURN OFF
THE TAP! COME HOME!) or questions (WHAT IS TONY
EATING? WHY ARE YOU CRYING?). Instead, they found mothers
did the reverse. That is, they used all these constructions jumbled
together with more questions and imperatives (62 per cent) than
declaratives (30 per cent)! Oddly enough, there were more declaratives
in the second session, six months later, than in the ﬁrst, and even more
in the speech addressed to other adults! These researchers, therefore,
assert that ‘Motherese is not a syntax-teaching language.’
Children, therefore, have an inbuilt ﬁlter which allows them to
choose what they pay attention to: ‘The child is selective in WHAT
he uses from the environment provided; he is selective about WHEN
in the course of acquisition he chooses to use it’ (Gleitman et al. 1984).
Child ‘uptake’ is not matched in any straightforward way with adult
input.

A further piece of evidence that uptake matters more than input,
is the existence of communities where parents do not modify their
speech when talking to infants. In ‘Trackton’, a working-class black
community in the southeast of the USA, adults do not regard babies
as suitable partners for regular conversation (Heath 1983). They rarely
address speech speciﬁcally to very young children. Moreover, Trackton
inhabitants ﬁnd it odd when they hear white people gurgling over
infants: ‘White folks uh hear dey kids say sump’n, dey say it back to
’em’ (Heath 1983: 84). Trackton children are an integral part of family
life, so they hear plenty of speech around them. Somehow, they acquire
language as efﬁciently as anyone else.
Adults can, however, help their children by talking about things
that interest them, and engaging in joint enterprises (Wells 1979):
‘Now, then, Shirley, are you going to help mummy peel the potatoes?
Can you get me six out of that basket?’ The tendency of girls to be
mildly ahead of boys in their language may be due to the different
treatment meted out by parents. Girls are often kept in to help with
the chores in many families, but boys are sent out to play games.
Mothers, rather than footballs, aid progress in language. And sensitive
fathers can help their sons too.
Some researchers have queried why the role of caregivers arouses
such controversy among those who study it. One ﬁnding is that the
various types of interaction have been classiﬁed in overlapping and
confusing ways. Researchers may, as a preliminary step, need to
distinguish negative feedback from negative evidence (Saxton 2000).
Negative feedback is a signal to the child that something is wrong
with their utterance, though exactly what is unspeciﬁed:
Alex:
A PIRATE HITTED HIM ON THE HEAD.
Father: WHAT?
This query prompted Alex to reassess what he had said, and amend
this too: ‘The pirate hit him on the head’ (Saxton 2000: 228) – though
Alex must already have known the correct form, because no extra
information was provided by his father. Negative evidence, on the
other hand, provides the child with the information needed to put
the utterance right:
Alex:
I SAY IT GOODER.
Father: BETTER.
Alex:
BETTER, YEAH. (Saxton 2000: 224).

Where does all this lead us? We now realize that caregiver speech
is an important factor which must be taken into consideration when
we study child language, and that it is often considerably more coherent
and more useful than Chomsky suggests. Yet as Cromer (1981: 65)
notes:
To show that the input signal to many children is far clearer than
had been assumed in no way explains how the grammatical
structures that the child uses are developed.
Or, in the words of the nineteenth-century German philosopher-
linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt: ‘Language cannot really be taught 
. . . One can only offer the thread along which language develops on
its own’ (quoted in Slobin 1975: 283).
A linguistic Process Peggy
Process Peggy, then, is not a general problem-solver. Neither everyday
needs nor general intelligence nor caregiver speech can fully account
for her special language abilities – though all these factors are important
if she is to develop normally. She must be innately programmed to
tackle language. In this section, we shall discuss how she might set
about her linguistic puzzle-solving.
In the beginning, she possibly uses her general intelligence to get
going (Chapter 6). She may behave like a computer, which often needs
a fairly general program to start up before it can use a more speciﬁc
one. Computer operators talk about ‘booting up’ or ‘boot-strapping’ a
computer – giving it some preliminary commands, which will then
allow it to cope with more detailed programs. So some linguists talk
about a ‘bootstrapping’ approach to language (Pinker 1984, 1987).
Linguistic bootstrapping might work as follows. Children learn words
such as DOGGY, KITTY, BITE, DRINK, BALL, MILK, which
correlate well with actors, actions and objects. They therefore build
these up in various semantic relationships (Chapter 6):
KITTY DRINK (ACTOR + ACTION).
DRINK MILK (ACTION + OBJECT).
And they may combine these into longer sequences:
KITTY DRINK MILK (ACTOR + ACTION + OBJECT).

Up to this point, general intelligence may be at work, rather than
linguistic ability. The basic scaffolding relies on meaning.
Then they switch over to syntax. Exactly how they do this is dis-
puted. According to one suggestion, syntax begins when children
discover some discrepancy in their semantic scaffolding. They may
discover that words describing actions such as BITE or DRINK can
sometimes be replaced by words such as WANT, GOT, LIKE, which
do not involve any kind of deed:
KITTY WANT MILK.
KITTY LIKE MILK.
The child may therefore realize that the ‘slot’ a word occupies in the
sentence matters more than its strict correlation with an action or
event in the external world. At this point, the child has acquired a
linguistic category, that of verb.
To take a slightly different example, children may notice that different
semantic relationships have some underlying structural similarity:
BLUE SOCK ‘It’s a blue sock’ (ATTRIBUTE + OBJECT).
MUMMY SOCK ‘It’s mummy’s sock’ (POSSESSOR + OBJECT).
They may notice that both BLUE and MUMMY fall into the same
slot, the one in front of SOCK, and combine them in their minds.
Once two different types of word have been combined under one
heading, this is syntax, not meaning.
To summarize, a possible way of moving from a semantic grammar
to a syntactic (linguistic) one is to discover that there is not necessarily
a direct correlation between types of word and the world. The child
therefore discovers abstract relationships underlying the semantic ones.
This is the beginning of syntax. Just as some children have a ‘naming-
insight’ which triggers a surge forward in vocabulary (Chapter 6), so
some children may acquire a syntactic insight, which triggers an innate
processing device.
Children cannot persist in using meaning to guide them, because
language just does not correlate sufﬁciently with the world around.
If children carried on classifying verbs as actions, they would probably
make strange overgeneralizations such as:
SHE IS NOISYING.
SHE IS BUSYING.

They would wrongly assume that NOISY and BUSY were verbs,
because they describe actions. Similarly, they would fail to recognize
words such as LIKE, HATE, GOT as verbs, because they do not
involve an action. But children do not seem to have this type of
problem (Maratsos 1982).
Somehow, children are specially pre-programmed to notice linguistic
regularities, and to give them priority over semantic ones, as shown
by children learning French or German (Maratsos 1982). A language
such as French has a somewhat odd gender system (by English
standards), since every word has to be labelled as masculine or feminine.
Sometimes this correlates with natural gender: UN GARÇON ‘a boy’
(m.), UNE DAME ‘a lady’ (f.), but at other times it does not, as in
UN CANIF ‘a knife’ (m.), UNE FOURCHETTE ‘a fork’ (f.). Certain
word endings (such as -IEN) are typically masculine, while others
(such as -IENNE) are typically feminine. Children pay more attention
to this type of information than to matching up gender with the
external world. This was demonstrated by an ingenious experiment
(Karmiloff-Smith 1979).
The researcher showed children a picture of two little boys, and
told them: ‘Here are two FORSIENNES.’ She then showed them
another picture, which had just one of the little boys in it, and asked:
‘What’s this?’ The children replied: ‘It’s UNE FORSIENNE.’ They
automatically used the feminine UNE ‘a’ because this goes with the
ending -IENNE. They did not seem bothered that a boy seemed to
be assigned to the feminine gender. If they had required language to
correlate closely with the world, they should have been puzzled. But
they were not. We conclude that linguistic consistency matters more
than language–world matching.
Operating principles
Children are wired, the linguist Noam Chomsky has argued, with a
substantial amount of innate knowledge (Chapter 5). Others have
argued that children are simply efﬁcient at sorting out and learning
the patterns of any language to which they are exposed. (Tomasello
2003). Let us explore the matter further.
Dan Slobin of the University of California at Berkeley worked on
this problem for a number of years, and is regarded as a pioneer in
this ﬁeld. (Slobin 1973, 1982, 1986a–1997b). He started by claiming
to have isolated a number of ‘operating principles’ used by children
as they process language. Children ﬁnd certain types of constructions
easier to cope with than others. They begin by acquiring ‘easy’

constructions, and will then move on to more difﬁcult ones. This
commonsense assumption underlies Slobin’s pioneering work. We
need therefore to ﬁnd out what constitutes ‘difﬁculty’ for a child in
linguistic terms. We can learn a certain amount by simply looking at
constructions which are acquired early, and seeing what they have in
common, after, of course, checking that the frequency of use by adults
is not a major factor for the construction in question. For example,
children acquire relative clauses (clauses introduced by relative pronouns
such as WHO, WHICH, THAT) in a certain order. They produce
relative clauses which follow the main clause such as:
MUNGO SAW AN OCTOPUS [WHICH HAD 20 LEGS]
before ones which are placed inside the main clause:
THE OCTOPUS [WHICH HAD 20 LEGS] ESCAPED
even though there seems to be little difference in the frequency with
which adults produce these two types. We can also draw certain con-
clusions from looking at children’s errors: why, for example, do children
so often leave out the auxiliary verb, as in DADDY (IS) SWIMMING,
MUMMY (IS) COOKING? However, the best way of discover-
ing which constructions children ﬁnd easy, and which difﬁcult, he
suggested, may be the study of children speaking different languages,
and in particular, bilingual children
Slobin pointed out that children who grow up learning two languages
do not normally acquire a particular construction simultaneously in
both languages. For example, children who are acquiring Hungarian
and Serbo-Croatian as twin native languages use Hungarian locatives
(INTO THE BOX, ON THE TABLE) long before they produce
the equivalent Serbo-Croatian ones. Clearly, there cannot be any
conceptual difﬁculty connected with the notion of locative, because
the Hungarian ones are used in the correct circumstances. We conclude
that there must be something intrinsically difﬁcult about Serbo-Croatian
locatives from the linguistic point of view.
Let us examine the locatives in these two languages, and then go
on to consider Slobin’s conclusions (which were based on far more
evidence than can be considered here).
The Hungarian locative, on the one hand, is formed by means of
a sufﬁx attached to a noun. Each locative expression, INTO, ON,
and so on, is a single unambiguous syllable, placed after a noun:

HAJÓBAN ‘Boat-in, in the boat’
HAJÓBÓL ‘Boat-out-of, (getting) out of the boat’.
The Serbo-Croatian locatives, on the other hand, are not nearly as
clear cut. The Serbo-Croatian word U can mean either ‘into’ or ‘in’.
You can tell the difference between the two uses of Serbo-Croatian
U by looking at the end of the following noun:
U KUCU ‘into the house’
U KUCI ‘in the house’.
But the situation is further complicated because the noun endings are
not used only in conjunction with this preposition, but have other
uses as well. Worse still, another preposition, K ‘towards’, which you
might expect to be followed by the same sufﬁx as U ‘into’, in fact
takes a quite different noun ending. So in Serbo-Croatian we ﬁnd the
same prepositional form with more than one meaning, and followed
by more than one noun ending. And we ﬁnd prepositions with similar
meanings followed by different noun endings, as well as the same
noun endings used for a variety of purposes. No wonder the children
get confused!
Slobin concluded that children ﬁnd some constructions easy to learn
and others difficult because they have certain expectations about
language. They expect language to be consistent, and assume that
there will be one unit of form to match each unit of meaning. They
expect words to be systematically modiﬁed, especially by means of
endings. They assume that word-order is important. They are puzzled
by interruptions and rearrangements of linguistic units.
Slobin expresses these expectations as a set of ‘operating principles’
– self instructions which the child might subconsciously give himself
as he attempts to analyse linguistic data. For example:
1
allot one form only to each unit of meaning;
2
pay attention to the ends of words;
3
pay attention to the order of words;
4
avoid interruptions.
Of course, Slobin’s list contains many more principles than the four
listed above (which appear in a slightly different form in his more
recent work). But there is considerable evidence to support his point
of view, particularly in respect of the four principles mentioned here.
Let us brieﬂy comment on each, giving some examples.

The principle of one form per unit of meaning seems to persist
right through the acquisition period. It lies behind children’s over-
generalizations. Once a child has correctly identiﬁed the plural ending
on words such as DUCKS, COWS, HORSES, he naturally assumes
that this ending can be extended to other words, as in SHEEPS,
MOUSES, GOOSES. Children conﬁdently expect the same plural
ending to be applicable everywhere (with minor phonetic variations).
Several researchers have noted that children show an inbuilt resistance
to using two different forms to mean the same thing (e.g. MacWhinney
1978; Clark 1987). Conversely, children do not like to allot more
than one meaning to any word or word-ending. Karmiloff-Smith
(1979) has shown that this principle is still at work in children between
the ages of 5 and 8. In a study of the acquisition of the articles LE/LA
‘the’ and UN/UNE ‘a’ in French, she noted that until around the
age of 8 ‘the child does not place on one word the burden of conveying
more than one meaning’ (Karmiloff-Smith 1979: 224). For example,
French UN/UNE can either mean ‘a’ or ‘one’. When children ﬁrst
became aware of the double meaning, several of them in her experi-
ments tried to invent ways of distinguishing between the two meanings,
by altering the syntax. In the following conversation, an 8-year-old
correctly says UNE BROSSE for ‘a brush’, but incorrectly uses the
phrase UNE DE BROSSE for ‘one brush’. The experimenter had
shown the child a picture of a boy in a room with three brushes, and
a girl in a room with one brush, and had asked: ‘To whom would I
say, lend me a brush?’ The child replied:
. . . it’s the boy because he’s got a brush (UNE BROSSE), no
it’s the girl because she has one brush (UNE DE BROSSE) . . .
no, the boy because he could give you any of his brushes.
(Karmiloff-Smith 1979)
The second operating principle mentioned above, ‘Pay attention to
the ends of words’ seems to be subconsciously followed even when
children are not dealing with specific inflectional endings. When English
children confuse two different words, they often get the last part right:
THE LION AND THE LEPRECHAUN instead of ‘the lion and
the unicorn’, ICE CREAM TOILET, for ‘ice cream cornet’ (Aitchison
and Straf 1981). And it is well known that children tend to omit or
confuse the ﬁrst syllable of a word, particularly if it is unstressed, as
in RITTACK, RIDUCTOR, RIFECTION for ‘attack’, ‘conductor’,
‘infection’ (Smith 1973: 12). But this is not only because the syllable
is unstressed. It is also because the syllable occurs at the beginning of

the word. In Czech, where initial syllables are stressed, it is the unstressed
ﬁnal syllables which are better remembered by children, according to
one researcher (Pascˇová 1968, reported in Slobin 1973). And further
evidence that sufﬁxes are more salient than preﬁxes or items placed
in front of a word comes from the observataion that English children
omit prepositions that are essential to the sentence (e.g. MUMMY
GARDEN) at a time when they have already started using the correct
endings on words (e.g. DADDY SINGING).
The third operating principle ‘Pay attention to the order of words’
is illustrated by the consistency with which children preserve the adult
word order in English (Chapter 6), while their resistance to alterations
in the ‘normal’ order is shown by their tendency to acquire the process
of noun-auxiliary inversion relatively late. As we noted, children
produce sentences such as WHERE DADDY HAS GONE? before
the correct, inverted form WHERE HAS DADDY GONE?
Finally, the principle ‘Avoid interruptions’ is shown by the
development of the verbal construction known as the progressive.
This describes an ongoing action:
POLLY IS SNORING.
ARTHUR IS WHISTLING.
It is a discontinuous sandwich-like construction because the progressive
sequence IS . . . ING is interrupted by the verb:
POLLY
IS
SNOR
ING
ARTHUR
IS
WHISTL
ING
It is clear that IS . . . ING functions as a single unit, because when
an ongoing action is described we do not ﬁnd one without the other.
English does not have sentences such as:
*POLLY IS SNORE.
*ARTHUR WHISTLING.
The Harvard children, Adam, Eve and Sarah all used the -ING part
of the progressive early (Brown 1973). Both Adam and Eve acquired
it earlier than any other ending. But they all omitted the IS (AM,
ARE, etc.) part:

WHAT COWBOY DOING?
WHY YOU SMILING?
The full IS . . . ING construction appeared only after a long delay.
In both Adam’s and Sarah’s speech, the gap was longer than 12 months.
For a year, it seems, they just did not fully recognize the connection
between the IS and the ING. And there appears to be nothing
inherently difﬁcult about the phonetic forms AM, IS, ARE. This is
shown by the fact that for all three children AM, IS, ARE occurred
with nouns, as in:
HE IS A COWBOY.
some time before AM, IS, ARE, in progressive constructions.
It seems that all three children were puzzled by the discontinuity
involved. They assigned -ING to the progressive early, but were bafﬂed
by the preceding IS. In other words, discontinuities seem to go against
children’s natural intuitions about what language is like. This point is
again illustrated by the development of relative clauses. As we noted
earlier, those which do not interrupt the main clause such as:
THE FARMER WAS ANGRY WITH THE PIG [WHICH ATE THE TURNIPS].
develop before those which do:
THE PIG [WHICH ATE THE TURNIPS] ESCAPED.
Moreover, if children are asked to repeat a sentence in which a main
clause is interrupted by a relative clause, they tend to alter the sentence
in order to avoid this happening. A child asked to repeat the sentence.
THE OWL [WHO EATS CANDY] RUNS FAST.
repeated it as:
THE OWL EAT A CANDY AND HE RUN FAST (Slobin and Welsh 1973).
Operating principles are not the whole answer, however. The 
four described above cannot account for the whole of acquisition. But
as soon as we start adding to them – Slobin eventually listed about
forty – then they start to clash with one another. Every time we ﬁnd
one which doesn’t work, we can claim it is because another one is
in operation, cancelling out the ﬁrst. This leads to the whole idea

being vacuous (Bowerman 1986). Unless we can ﬁnd out which have
precedence, and how children cope in cases of conﬂict, then we are
back at square one – looking for some basic principles which guide
children through the morass of possibilities.
Some people have suggested that the principles interact with particular
languages. If one operating principle works well, due to the structure
of the language concerned, then it is given priority over others (Bates
and MacWhinney 1987; MacWhinney 1987, MacWhinney and Bates
1989). For example, English has a fairly rigid word order. Children
will repeatedly come across the same order for (say) verb + adverb
(WALK SLOWLY, HOLD IT CAREFULLY, SHUT IT QUIETLY).
Counter-evidence such as SOFTLY FALLS THE LIGHT OF DAY
is rare. Evidence of word order is thus both easily available and reliable,
so English children will pay particular attention to the order of words.
In another language, such as Turkish, the ends of words may get extra
scrutiny. According to this view, then, the various operating principles
compete with one another, and the structure of the language determines
which ones will win out over others.
In short, children are enormously good at sussing out how their
own language works. But perhaps we need more than the vague notion
of competing strategies. Let us try to be more precise.
Advancing and retreating
How do children advance? And how do they retreat? Being endowed
with processing mechanisms which involve certain outline expectations
about language does not tell us exactly how a child acquires any particular
construction. Nor does it tell us how children manage to abandon
their mistakes. Let us consider these matters.
A construction does not pop up suddenly, like a chicken out of an
egg. There may be quite a gap between its emergence (ﬁrst appearance)
and its acquisition (reliable use). A typical proﬁle of a developing structure
was outlined earlier, when we discussed Sally’s past tenses (Chapter
6). Judging from Sally’s behaviour, children learn the ﬁrst examples
of a construction by rote, without fully analysing them. In this way,
a structure gets a ﬁrm hold in a few places. The child then tentatively
experiments by extending it to new examples. If she gets reinforcement
for these experiments, the construction is likely to proliferate, affecting
more and more vocabulary items. As an end result, a rule is acquired.
This general pattern of ‘lexical diffusion’ (Chapter 6) occurs in more
complex constructions also, such as sentences which contain the
sequence TO + verb (Bloom et al. 1984):

FELIX TRIED TO REACH THE APPLE.
I WANT THAT DOG TO STAY OUTSIDE.
The earliest examples of this construction occurred without any
overt appearance of TO, as in:
I WANNA PEE-PEE.
I WANNA TAKE KITTY.
where the child had no realization that TO is a separate item. When
a distinct TO did appear, children behaved as if it was fastened to the
end of the previous verb, each of which was one of a small group of
newly acquired verbs, such as TRY TO, LIKE TO, SUPPOSED TO,
as in:
I LIKE TO
SEE GRANDMA.
I TRY TO
STAY CLEAN.
Gradually, they added in more and more verbs. They also re-analysed
their old WANNA sequences, and produced utterances such as:
I WANT TO
HOLD THE KITTY.
Finally, they began to acquire sentences in which a noun occurred
between the ﬁrst verb and TO:
I’LL HELP YOU TO FIND THE BUTTONS.
I WANT THIS DOLL TO STAY HERE.
They therefore realized that TO was more closely associated with the
second verb.
As the move from WANNA to WANT TO suggests, verbs may
be the key to understanding how children move forwards. Let us
consider this.
Verbs as maypoles
Verbs are the maypole around which a sentence revolves. This may
seem odd, since verbs vary so much. If an adult describes, say, an egg
being dropped, he or she will use the word EGG, but the verb will
vary from person to person: ‘Mildred dropped the egg’, ‘The egg slipped

through her ﬁngers’, ‘The egg smashed on the ground’, ‘The egg broke’,
and so on. In one experiment, adults who were shown a videoclip
agreed on the verb less than 10 per cent of the time (Gleitman and
Gillette 1995).
But on reﬂection, verbs are not so strange. They describe straight-
forward events or linked ones. To ‘boil potatoes’ covers several different
actions, but all are causally related. No verb means ‘Simultaneously,
John yawned and the cat fell off the roof.’ No verb SUBNOUGATE
exists for ‘To eat the bottom caramels in a candy box and carefully
replace the top level, hoping no one will notice’ (Pinker 1989: 196).
Verb structure ties in with the verb’s meaning. Take the sentences
PENELOPE SNEEZED and PETE KICKED THE CAT. English
speakers know that only Penelope is involved in the action in the
ﬁrst, and that Pete is doing something to something else in the second.
And children pay careful attention to the words round the verb, as
shown by Kelli, a blind child (Landau and Gleitman 1985).
Kelli couldn’t see, but she learned to speak with only a marginal
delay, compared with sighted children. She, like other children, focused
on verbs and the words accompanying them. For example, she dis-
tinguished LOOK and SEE by paying attention to the different ways
in which her mother used these words:
LOOK, HERE’S HOW YOU WIND UP THE CLOCK.
YOU LOOK LIKE A KANGAROO.
SEE IF YOU CAN PUT THE SLIPPER ON.
LET’S SEE IF GRANNY’S HOME.
These structural differences were important – though some of the
clues also related to meaning. Kelli’s mother tended to use LOOK
when an object was near at hand:
LET’S LOOK AT THIS (where LOOK meant ‘feel’).
and SEE when it was further away:
COME AND SEE THE KITTY.
As Kelli shows, syntax and meaning are intertwined in a way that is
not always easy to tease out.
The realization that verbs are the key to children’s speech has led
to considerable further work, and the way youngsters acquire them is

slowly becoming clearer (Tomasello 1992, 2003, Tomasello and Brooks
1998). Michael Tomasello noted that his daughter Travis was young
when she learned a wide array of verbs and relational words – 162
before her second birthday. Change of state verbs came early, for
example, FALL-DOWN when she fell in a pool, and so did activity
verbs, as with TRAVIS LICK-IT, as she licked a popsicle (iced lolly).
Each of these verb uses seemed to be independent of others. Travis’s
earliest three or more word sentences, produced between the ages of
18–21 months, were almost all structured by verbs, and they typically
involved building on word combinations that were already in use,
such as FALL-DOWN WEEZER which she announced as she dropped
the cat, whose name was Weezer, and WEEZER LICK-IT ARMS,
as Weezer licked her arms.
In these early stages, Travis showed very few signs of having broad,
general grammatical rules. Mostly, she worked on a verb-by-verb
basis, with speciﬁc people performing the verb’s actions, somewhat
like the ‘limited scope formulae’ identiﬁed by Martin Braine (Chapter
6). Tomasello has labelled his verb ﬁndings the ‘Verb Island hypothesis’,
which stresses the idea that the known verbs are isolated islands of
knowledge, not yet linked up into broader rules.
Backtracking
According to the view outlined above, children listen carefully to
what people say, and add on verbs one by one. But youngsters do
more than this: they sometimes generalize their knowledge to new
verbs. The puzzle of why children do not go ahead and produce
enormously overgeneralized grammars ‘constitutes one of the most
intriguing and difﬁcult challenges for all students of language acquisition’
(Bowerman 1988: 73). Researchers are still trying to discover how
children acquire subtle verb distinctions, both in English and other
languages, especially in cases where a verb behaves in an unpredictable
way. A child needs to notice that you can say either:
MARION BAKED A CAKE FOR PETER.
or:
MARION BAKED PETER A CAKE.
But this double possibility isn’t always available. You can say:
DONALD OPENED THE DOOR FOR PAMELA.

but not:
*DONALD OPENED PAMELA THE DOOR.
The recipient has to be able to possess the object in order to come
in front of it. The problem is clear, but the answer is not: ‘The essential
challenge thus becomes that of developing a theory that allows just
the appropriate degree of productivity . . . avoiding the opposing pitfalls
of overgeneralization on the one hand and undergeneralization on the
other’ (Baker 1992). Similarly, you can say:
KEITH GAVE HELEN A BUNCH OF ROSES.
or:
KEITH GAVE A BUNCH OF ROSES TO HELEN.
You could also say:
KEITH GAVE HELEN A HEADACHE.
but not:
*KEITH GAVE A HEADACHE TO HELEN.
You can only give something to someone if a change of location is
involved. Apparently, children notice these subtle meaning distinctions
and tie them in with the syntax (Pinker 1989) – though how they
do this is still unclear.
Yet overgeneralizations are less frequent than is sometimes assumed.
They appear common because people tend to notice odd sentences
such as:
MOMMY, OPEN HADWEN THE DOOR (Mazurkewich and White 1984).
But how do children retreat from these erroneous forms? It’s not
yet clear. Perhaps they are just experimenting, so do not have these
wrong rules truly ﬁxed in their minds. Or perhaps at this stage children
are ultra-sensitive to constructions they are working on (Chapter 4).
In this chapter, then, we have tried to see exactly how children
extract grammar from the data they hear around them. Chomsky
appears to be wrong when he suggests that children are born with

detailed linguistic knowledge which is triggered by only minimal
exposure to language. In place of a Content Cuthbert, a child whose
mind contains chunks of information about language, we should
substitute a Process Peggy, a child whose mind is set up with puzzle-
solving equipment.
Process Peggy seems to be geared speciﬁcally to language. Her
achievements cannot be explained solely by her daily needs, her general
cognitive ability, or her parents’ speech, though these undoubtedly
help her as she struggles to solve linguistic puzzles.
We now have some general idea of the kinds of linguistic expecta-
tions which Process Peggy brings to language, and how she advances
as she acquires each new construction though we are less clear about
how she backtracks, when she discovers she has made a mistake. The
exact proportion of speciﬁc language mechanisms to other aspects of
intelligence is also unclear. It may be that the two are so inextricably
mixed, that perhaps we never shall succeed in fully untangling them.
This is another question for the future.
We have now completed our discussion of language acquisition.
But one point remains quite open. What kind of internal grammar
does someone who has completed the acquisition of language have?
In other words what does the internalized grammar of an adult look
like? This is the next question to be considered. But before that, we
have a brief excursus in which we discuss the following topic: how
did Chomsky conceive the idea of a transformational grammar in the
ﬁrst place? And why has he, and most other linguists, changed their
mind so much in recent years?

Celestial unintelligibility
Why do linguists propose such
bizarre grammars?
‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, ‘I’ll give him sixpence.
I don’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.’ 
‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to ﬁnd any. And yet I don’t
know,’ he went on, ‘I seem to see some meaning after all.’ 
Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland 
Linguists are sometimes accused of being ‘too abstract’ and ‘removed
from reality’. For example, one reviewer has condemned ‘that celestial
unintelligibility which is the element where the true student of linguis-
tics normally ﬂoats and dances’ (Philip Toynbee, The Observer). Yet
almost all linguists, not just psycholinguists, are trying to ﬁnd out
about a speaker’s mental ‘grammar’ – the internalized set of ruleswhich
enables someone to speak and understand their language. As Chomsky
noted:
The linguist constructing a grammar of his language is in effect
proposing a hypothesis concerning this internalized system.
(Chomsky 1972a: 26)
So the question which naturally arises is this: if linguists are really
trying to form theories about an internalized system, why did Chomsky
hit on something as complex and abstract as transformational grammar?
Surely there are other types of grammar which do not seem as odd?
Some of the reasons for setting up a transformational grammar were
mentioned in Chapter 1. But the question will be considered again
from a different angle here, including some of the reasons why Chomsky
has shifted his ideas so radically. Indeed, to some people Chomsky has
played a ‘Duke of York’ trick on us all, as in the old nursery rhyme:

The grand old Duke of York,
He had ten thousand men,
He marched them up to the top of the hill,
Then he marched them down again.
Why did Chomsky march us to the top of the transformational hill,
then march us all down again? And post-Chomsky, where is everybody
trying to go now? Let’s start at the beginning.
Jupiter’s stick insects
Suppose . . . a spaceship full of English speakers had landed on Jupiter.
They found the planet inhabited by a race of green stick insects who
communicated by sitting down and wiggling their stick-like toes. The
English speakers learned the Jupiter toe-wiggle language easily. It was
a sign language like Washoe’s in which signs stood for words, with
no obvious structure. So communication was not a serious problem.
But the Emperor of Jupiter became highly envious of these foreigners
who were able to walk about and communicate at the same time.
They did not have to stop, sit down, and wiggle their toes. He decided
to learn English.
At ﬁrst, he assumed the task was easy. He ordered his servants to
record all the sentences uttered by the English speakers, together with
their meanings. Each morning he locked himself into his study and
memorized the sentences recorded on the previous day. He carried
out this routine unswervingly for about a year, dutifully learning every
single sentence spoken by the foreigners. As he was an inhabitant of
Jupiter, he had no natural ability for understanding the way a language
worked. So he did not detect any patterns in the words, he simply
memorized them. Eventually, he decided he knew enough to start
testing his knowledge in conversation with the Englishmen.
But the result was a disaster. He didn’t seem to have learnt the
sentences he needed to use. When he wanted to ask the Englishmen
if they liked sea-urchin soup, the nearest sentence he could remember
having learnt was ‘This is funny-tasting soup. What kind is it?’ When
it rained, and he wanted to know if rain was likely to harm the
foreigners, the most relevant sentence was ‘It’s raining, can we buy
gumboots and umbrellas here?’
He began to have doubts about the task he had set himself of
memorizing all English sentences. Would it ever come to an end? He
understood that each sentence was composed of units called words,
such as JAM, SIX, HELP, BUBBLE which kept recurring. But although
he now recognized many of the words which cropped up, they kept

appearing in new combinations, so the number of new sentences did
not seem to be decreasing. Worse still, some of the sentences were
extremely long. He recalled one in which an English speaker had been
discussing a greedy boy: ‘Alexander ate ten sausages, four jam tarts,
two bananas, a Swiss roll, seven meringues, fourteen oranges, eight
pieces of toast, fourteen apples, two ice-creams, three triﬂes and then
he was sick.’ The Emperor wondered despairingly what would have
happened to the sentence if Alexander hadn’t been sick. Would it
have gone on for ever? Another sentence worried him, which an
English speaker had read out of a magazine. It was a summary of
previous episodes in a serial story: ‘Virginia, who is employed as a
governess at an old castle in Cornwall, falls in love with her employer’s
son Charles who is himself in love with a local beauty queen called
Linda who has eyes only for the ﬁsherman’s nephew Philip who is
obsessed with his half-sister Phyllis who loves the handsome young
farmer Tom who cares only for his pigs.’ Presumably the writer ran
out of characters to describe, the Emperor reasoned. Otherwise, the
sentence could have gone on even further.
The Emperor had therefore deduced for himself two fundamental
facts about language. There are a ﬁnite number of elements which
can be combined in a mathematically enormous number of ways. And
it is in principle impossible to memorize every sentence because there
is no linguistic bound on the length of a sentence. Innumerable ‘sub’-
sentences can be joined on to the original one, a process known as
conjoining:
ALEXANDER ATE 10 SAUSAGES
+
(ALEXANDER ATE) 4 JAM TARTS
+
(ALEXANDER ATE) 2 BANANAS
+
(ALEXANDER ATE) A SWISS ROLL
+ . . .
Alternatively, sub-sentences can be inserted or embedded inside the
original one:

Celestial unintelligibility

This property of language is known as recursiveness from the Latin to
‘run through again’ – you can repeatedly apply the same rule to one
sentence, a process which could (in theory) go on for ever. Of course,
in practice you would fall asleep, or get bored or get a sore throat.
But these are not linguistic reasons for stopping. This means that no
deﬁnite set of utterances can ever be assembled for any language.
The Emperor of Jupiter eventually concluded that memorization
of all English sentences was impossible. He realized it was the patterns
behind the utterances which mattered.
How should he discover what these were? One way would be to
make a list of all the English words he had collected, and to note
whereabouts in the sentence each one occurred. He started to do this.
But he hit on problems almost immediately. He had a feeling that
some of his sentences had mistakes in them, but he was not sure which
ones. Was ‘I hic have hic o dear hic hiccups’ a well-formed English
sentence or not? And what about ‘I mean that what I wanted I think
to say was this’?
His other problem was that he found gaps in the patterns, and he
didn’t know which ones were accidental, and which not. For example,
he found four sentences containing the word ELEPHANT:
THE ELEPHANT CARRIED TEN PEOPLE.
THE ELEPHANT SWALLOWED TEN BUNS.
THE ELEPHANT WEIGHED TEN TONS.
TEN PEOPLE WERE CARRIED BY THE ELEPHANT.
But he did not ﬁnd:
TEN BUNS WERE SWALLOWED BY THE ELEPHANT.
TEN TONS WERE WEIGHED BY THE ELEPHANT.
Why not? Were these gaps accidental? Or were the sentences ungram-
matical? The Emperor did not know, and grew very depressed. He had
discovered another important fact about language: collections of utterances
must be treated with caution. They are full of false starts and slips of
the tongue. And they constitute only a small subset of all possible
utterances. In linguistic terms, a speaker’s performance or E-language
(externalized language) is likely to be a random sample bespattered with
errors, and does not necessarily provide a very good guide to his or her
competence or I-language (internalized language), the internal set of rules
which underlie them.

The Emperor of Jupiter realized that he needed the help of the
foreigners themselves. He arrested the spaceship captain, a man called
Noam, and told him that he would free him as soon as he had written
down the rules of English. Noam plainly knew them, since he could
talk.
Noam was astounded. He pleaded with the Emperor, pointing out
that speaking a language was an ability like walking which involved
knowing how to do something. Such knowledge was not necessarily
conscious. He tried to explain that philosophers on earth made a
distinction between two kinds of knowing: knowing that and knowing
how. Noam knew that Jupiter was a planet, and factual knowledge of
this type was conscious knowledge. On the other hand, he knew how
to talk and how to walk, though he had no idea how to convey this
knowledge to others, since he carried out the actions required without
being aware of how he actually managed to do them.
But the Emperor was adamant. Noam would not be freed until he
had written down an explicit set of rules, parallel to the system
internalized in his head.
Noam pondered. Where could he begin? After much thought he
made a list of all the English words he could think of, then fed them
into a computer with the instructions that it could combine them in
any way whatsoever. First it was to print out all the words one by
one, then all possible combinations of two words, then three words,
then four words, and so on. The computer began churning out the
words as programmed, and spewed out (in the four-word cycle)
sequences such as:
DOG INTO INTO OF
UP UP UP UP
GOLDFISH MAY EAT CATS
THE ELEPHANT LOVED BUNS
DOWN OVER FROM THE
SKYLARKS KISS SNAILS BADLY.
Sooner or later, Noam reasoned, the computer would produce every
English sentence.
Noam announced to the Emperor that the computer was pro-
grammed with rules which made it potentially capable of producing
all possible sentences of English. The Emperor was suspicious that the
task had been completed so quickly. And when he checked with the
other foreigners, his fears were conﬁrmed. The others pointed out
that although Noam’s computer program could in theory generate all

English sentences, it certainly did not generate only the sentences 
of English. Since the Emperor was looking for a device which paralleled
a human’s internalized grammar, Noam’s programme must be rejected,
because humans did not accept sentences such as:
DOG INTO INTO OF.
It was also unlikely that they would accept:
GOLDFISH MAY EAT CATS.
or:
SKYLARKS KISS SNAILS BADLY.
But there was nothing really wrong with these grammatically: these
were accidental facts about the diet of goldfish and the amatory
preferences of skylarks which need not be included in the grammar.
So Noam went away again and thought hard. It dawned on him
that all sentences were straightforward word ‘strings’: they were
composed of words strung together, one after the other. And the order
in which they occurred was partially predictable. For example, THE
had to be followed either by an adjective such as GOOD, LITTLE
or by a noun such as FLOWER, CHEESE, or occasionally an adverb
such as CAREFULLY as in:
THE CAREFULLY NURTURED CHILD SCRIBBLED OBSCENE GRAFFITI
ON THE WALLS.
Perhaps, he pondered, one’s head contained a network of associations
such that each word was in some way attached to the words which
could follow it in a sentence. He started to devise a grammar which
started with one word, which triggered off a choice between several
others, which in turn moved to another choice, until the sentence
was complete:

This simple device could account for quite a number of different
sentences:
A LION ATE A KANGAROO.
THE TIGRESS CHASED THE GIRAFFE.
and so on. If he continued to elaborate it, perhaps it could eventually
include all possible sentences of English.
He presented it to the Emperor, who in turn showed it to the
other Englishmen. They pointed out a fatal ﬂaw. Such a device could
not possibly account for a speaker’s internalized rules for English,
because English (and all other languages) has sentences in which non-
adjacent words are dependent on one another. For example, you can
have a sentence:
THE LIONESS HURT HERSELF.
If each word triggered off the next only, then you would not be able
to link the word following HURT with LIONESS, you would be
just as likely to have
*THE LIONESS HURT HIMSELF.
Similarly, a sentence starting with EITHER, as in
EITHER BILL STOPS SINGING OR YOU FIND ME EAR-PLUGS.
would not ﬁt into this system, since there would be no means of
triggering the OR. Furthermore, in this left-to-right model, all the
words had equal status, and were linked to one another like beads on
a necklace. But in language, speakers treat ‘chunks’ of words as
belonging together:
THE LITTLE RED HEN / WALKED SLOWLY / ALONG THE PATH /
SCRATCHING FOR WORMS.
Any grammar which claimed to mirror a speaker’s internalized rules
must recognize this fact.
Noam, therefore, realized that an adequate grammar must fulﬁl at
the very least two requirements. First, it must account for all and only
the sentences of English. In linguistic terminology, it must be observa-
tionally adequate. Second, it must do so in a way which coincides with

the intuitions of a native speaker. Such a grammar is spoken of as
being descriptively adequate.
Noam decided, as a third attempt, to concentrate on a system which
would capture the fact that sentences are split up into chunks of words
which go together. He decided that a multi-layered, ‘downward
branching’ system was the answer. At the top of the page he wrote
the letter S to represent ‘sentence’. Then he drew two branches forking
from it, representing the shortest possible English sentence (not counting
commands).
Then each branch was expanded into a longer phrase which could
optionally replace it:
This tree diagram clearly captured the hierarchical structure of language,
the fact that whole phrases can be the structural equivalent of one
word. It diagrammed the fact that HUNGRY LIONS functions as a
single unit in a way that KILL STAMPEDING does not.
The Emperor of Jupiter was delighted. For the ﬁrst time he began
to have an inkling of the way language worked. ‘I want some soup
. . . some seaweed soup . . . some hot seaweed soup . . . some steaming
hot seaweed soup,’ he murmured to himself, realizing the importance
of Noam’s new system.
The other Englishmen praised the system, but grudgingly. They
admitted that the tree diagram worked well for sentences such as:
HUNGRY LIONS MAY KILL STAMPEDING BUFFALOES.
But they had one major objection. Did Noam realize just how many
trees might be required for the whole language? And did he realize

that sentences which speakers felt to be closely related would have
quite different trees? For example:
HUNGRY LIONS MAY KILL STAMPEDING BUFFALOES.
would have a tree quite different from:
STAMPEDING BUFFALOES MAY BE KILLED BY HUNGRY LIONS.
And a sentence such as:
TO CHOP DOWN LAMP POSTS IS A DREADFUL CRIME.
would have a different tree from:
IT IS A DREADFUL CRIME TO CHOP DOWN LAMP POSTS.
Worse still, had Noam noticed that sentences which were felt to be
quite different by the speakers of the language had the same trees?
THE BOY WAS LOATH TO WASH.
had exactly the same tree as:
THE BOY WAS DIFFICULT TO WASH.
Surely Noam could devise a system in which sentences felt by speakers
to be similar could be linked up, and dissimilar ones separated?
After much contemplation, Noam realized he could economize on
the number of trees needed, and he could also capture the intuitions
of speakers that certain sentences were similar if he regarded similar
sentences as belonging to the same basic tree! Actives and passives for
example, could be related to an underlying tree:

Then this ‘deep structure’ tree could be ‘transformed’ by operations
known as transformations into different surface structures. It provided
the basis for both ‘the lions have eaten a buffalo’ and ‘a buffalo has
been eaten by the lions’.
Using the same principle, Noam realized that he could explain the
similarity of
TO CHOP DOWN LAMP POSTS IS A DREADFUL CRIME
IT IS A DREADFUL CRIME TO CHOP DOWN LAMP POSTS.
Conversely, the difference between
THE BOY WAS LOATH TO WASH.
THE BOY WAS DIFFICULT TO WASH.
could be explained by suggesting that the sentences are connected to
different deep structure strings.
The Emperor of Jupiter was delighted with Noam’s latest attempt,
and the other Englishmen agreed that Noam seemed to have hit on
a very good solution. He appeared to have devised a clear, economical
system which was able to account for all and only the sentences of
English, and which also captured the intuitions of the speakers about
the way their language worked. A further important bonus was that
the system could possibly be used for French, Chinese, Turkish, Arawak
or any other language in the strange human world.
However, the Emperor was still somewhat puzzled. Had Noam
explained to him how to actually produce English sentences? Or had
he merely drawn him a map of the way in which related sentences
were stored in an Englishman’s head? Noam was rather vague when
asked about this. He said that although the map idea seemed nearer
the truth, the map nevertheless had important implications for the
way in which sentences were produced and recognized. The Emperor
was extremely puzzled by this statement. However, he decided that
Noam had done some splendid work, and so should be set free and
rewarded handsomely. Meanwhile, the Emperor made a mental note
that when he had some more spare time, he would have to contemplate
more thoroughly the question of how Noam’s proposals related to
the way humans produced and recognized sentences.
Let us summarize what the Emperor of Jupiter had discovered about
the nature of human language and the type of ‘grammar’ which can
account for it. First, he discovered that it is in principle impossible to
memorize every sentence of a language, because there is no linguistic
limit on the length of a sentence.

Second, he found that any collection of utterances must be treated
with the utmost care. It contains slips of the tongue, and represents
only a random sample of all possible utterances. For this reason it is
important to focus attention on a speaker’s underlying system of rules,
his ‘competence’ rather than on an arbitrary collection of his utterances,
or his ‘performance’. Third, the Emperor realized that a good grammar
of a language will not only be observationally adequate – one which
can account for all the possible sentences of a language. It will also
be descriptively adequate – that is, it will reﬂect the intuitions of the
native speaker about his language. This meant that a simple, left-to-
right model of language, in which each word was triggered by the
one before it, was unworkable. It was observationally inadequate
because it did not allow for non-adjacent words to be dependent on
one another. And it was descriptively inadequate because it wrongly
treated all words as being of equal value and linked together like beads
on a string, when in practice language is hierarchically structured with
‘chunks’ of words going together.
Fourth, the Emperor of Jupiter noted that a hierarchically structured,
top-to-bottom model of language was a reasonable proposal – but it
did not link up sentences which were felt by the speakers to be closely
related, such as:
TO CHOP DOWN LAMP POSTS IS A DREADFUL CRIME.
and:
IT IS A DREADFUL CRIME TO CHOP DOWN LAMP POSTS.
On the other hand it wrongly linked up sentences such as:
THE BOY WAS LOATH TO WASH.
and
THE BOY WAS DIFFICULT TO WASH.
which seemed to be quite different. So ﬁnally, he became convinced
that the most satisfactory system was a transformational model of
language, in which sentences felt to be similar share the same deep
structure. He came to believe that all sentences had both a hidden,
deep structure and an obvious surface structure which might look
quite different, and he accepted that these two levels were linked by
processes known as transformations.

However, the Emperor remained puzzled about how this model of
an internalized grammar might tie in with the way humans produce
and comprehend sentences. He felt that Noam had been quite unclear
on the topic.
Several of the things discovered by the mythical Emperor of Jupiter
are points made by Noam Chomsky in his early, slim, but extremely
inﬂuential work, Syntactic Structures (1957). In this, he explains why a
left-to-right or ‘ﬁnite-state’ model of language is deﬁcient, and also why
a top-to-bottom or ‘phrase structure’ model is inadequate. He then
justiﬁes the need for a transformational grammar. He elaborated this
basic model in his ‘classic’ work Aspects of the Theory of Syntax (1965).
Within 20 years, however, his views had radically changed. Let us see
how this alteration might be justiﬁed to the Emperor of Jupiter.
Return to Jupiter
Many years later, after he had orbited the universe several times, and
been acclaimed as one of the pioneers of his century, Noam decided
to return to Jupiter. He wanted to see how the Emperor was coping
with his old transformational system. More importantly, he wanted to
explain his new ideas on language.
Noam found the Emperor full of complaints. After Noam’s departure
from Jupiter, the Emperor had continued to work on Noam’s system.
He had been helped by some of Noam’s spaceship colleagues who
had stayed behind on Jupiter to do some research on the climate. But
things just hadn’t worked out as he had hoped.
The Emperor had two types of grumble. There were general
grumbles about the whole system, and speciﬁc grumbles about particular
transformations.
His main complaint was that the system just didn’t work properly.
He had hoped that by now he would have found a set of rules which
could account for all the possible sentences of English, and no others.
But in spite of working long hours, there were dozens of sentences
which he’d heard Noam’s colleagues speak, for which he hadn’t been
able to specify the full set of rules. And the very best set of rules he’d
come up with still included numerous sentences which apparently
weren’t English.
Furthermore, he had considerable doubts about his transformational
rules. As long as he got the right outcome, it didn’t seem to matter
very much how he got there. Almost anything could be transformed
into anything! There seemed to be too much latitude. Surely the
whole thing ought to be tightened up a bit?

Noam agreed with these general points. The Emperor had discovered
for himself the same problems as Noam had noticed. It seemed almost
impossible to ﬁnd a deﬁnitive set of rules which could specify what
was, and what was not, a permissible sentence of English. The second,
and more serious problem, was the enormous ‘power’ of the system:
transformations appeared to be able to do almost anything. There 
were not enough constraints keeping them in check. A system which
can do anything, as if with the wave of a magic wand, is not very
informative.
Noam explained that he had been working very hard on the question
of constraints. It was far more important, he had decided, to specify
the general bounds within which human language worked, than to
spend hours and hours ﬁddling with the exact rules which would
account for any one particular language.
Encouraged by this, the Emperor started on his detailed complaints,
which were mostly about transformations. First, he grumbled, some
transformations were quite arbitrary, because they were linked to
particular lexical items. You simply had to know which words were
involved. For example, you could say:
FRED GAVE A GIRAFFE TO THE ZOO.
FRED DONATED A GIRAFFE TO THE ZOO.
Then, a transformation supposedly speciﬁed that with GIVE, you could
also say:
FRED GAVE THE ZOO A GIRAFFE.
But this transformation did not work with DONATE. You could 
not say:
*FRED DONATED THE ZOO A GIRAFFE.
Wasn’t this odd? he asked.
Noam agreed that any transformation which was restricted to
particular lexical items was not a proper transformation. Instead, it was
part of the dictionary or ‘lexicon’ which existed in any speaker’s mind.
In his more recent system, he had moved information about the
structures which could follow GIVE and DONATE into this dictionary.
The Emperor continued grumbling. Some transformations seemed
to him pointless. Why did a sentence such as:

FENELLA THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS ILL.
have a deep structure which included the word FENELLA twice,
saying in effect:
FENELLA THOUGHT THAT FENELLA WAS ILL?
Wasn’t this rather pointless? Couldn’t one leave SHE in the deep
structure, and add a note saying SHE referred to FENELLA?
Noam agreed that a transformation which changed FENELLA into
SHE was quite unnecessary, and that the matter could be dealt with
in the way the Emperor suggested. In any case, the linking up of a
pronoun SHE to other words should be dealt with by the semantic
component, not by a transformation.
The Emperor continued moaning. Why were there so many different
transformations which all had more or less the same effect? Consider:
IT SEEMED THAT THE DUCHESS WAS DRUNK.
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PLEASE THE DUCHESS.
These two sentences were fairly like their deep structures, compared
to two others, which involved bringing THE DUCHESS to the front:
THE DUCHESS SEEMED TO BE DRUNK.
THE DUCHESS WAS DIFFICULT TO PLEASE.
Yet each of these two sentences involved a different transformation!
Supposedly, they had to be different, because the deep structures were
different. Wasn’t this unnecessary proliferation of transformations?
Noam agreed with this criticism. It was foolish to have different
transformations which performed the same manoeuvre. In his recent
system, they had been combined.
The Emperor in his moans and groans had outlined many of the
problems which eventually surrounded old-style transformations. They
were too powerful, there were too many of them, they were too
disparate. Gradually, they were reduced in number. Some were handed
over to other components of the grammar, others were combined. In
the end, only one transformation survived. This moved items about,
though within strict limits.
The Emperor was amazed! Fancy having a transformational grammar
with hardly any transformations! How on Jupiter did such a system
work?

Noam started waving his arms about in excitement as he propounded
his new system. He was on the verge of specifying a genetic blueprint
for language, he announced. There were a number of ﬁxed principles,
which worked for all languages. There were also others which allowed
a limited amount of variation. If you speciﬁed these properly, you
hardly needed any rules at all!
The Emperor looked doubtful. Perhaps Noam had contracted space-
sickness, which had sent him mad. How could one do without rules?
Noam tried to explain. Suppose you were designing a human being,
he suggested. You had to give him or her a head. That would be a
ﬁxed principle. But the colour of the skin could vary in certain speciﬁed
ways. As for doing away with rules, one might have a general principle
saying: ‘Limbs come in pairs.’ Then one need not have separate rules
which said: ‘Humans have two arms’ and ‘Humans have two legs.’
This sort of a system was applicable to language, he was convinced.
The Emperor was suspicious. Surely language was much too compli-
cated to be dealt with in this simple way?
Not at all, argued Noam. On the contrary, language possibly con-
sisted of a number of rather simple components. Each of the compo-
nents worked in accordance with some quite straightforward principles,
and they only appeared complex because of the way they interacted
with principles from other components.
The Emperor seemed puzzled. So Noam used another analogy.
‘Think of a human mouth,’ he suggested. ‘There’s a mobile tongue
which pushes food about. There are salivary glands which moisten it.
And there are fixed teeth which grind it down. Each of these
components is quite simple. Yet when they are working together the
interaction is quite complex, and the effect powerful!’ (Matthei and
Roeper 1983).
The Emperor was partially persuaded. He begged Noam to hand
over his genetic blueprint for language. But Noam stalled. He hadn’t
yet worked out how many components were involved, he admitted,
nor what the basic principles were. He was fairly conﬁdent only that
‘economy’ or simplicity played a major role. Matters would be clearer
in a hundred or so years’ time, he predicted.
The Emperor felt quite frustrated. And he was even more puzzled
as to how Noam’s new system might link up with how humans
understand and produce speech.
In this ﬁctitious account, we have outlined several of the problems
which caused disillusionment with transformations as they were formu-
lated in the ‘classic’ (1965) version of transformational grammar. And

we have put forward the general aims expressed by Chomsky ﬁrst of
all in Lectures on Government and Binding (1981), but expressed most
clearly in Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use (1986) and
later in the The Minimalist Program (1995b). Chomsky became more
concerned with specifying the nature of the human language system
than with formulating a complete picture of any one language. He
believed that a ‘principles and parameters’ approach (with parameter
referring to a factor which can be set variably) would largely do away
with rules. And he became convinced that the overall system is modular,
in that it is composed of a set of modules (components) which are
simple in themselves, but become complex when they interact with
other modules.
But this left many, including the fictional Emperor of Jupiter,
deeply disappointed, as will be outlined below.
The Emperor’s disillusion
The Emperor of Jupiter felt let down. But was he angry with Noam,
or angry with himself? He wasn’t sure. He had, he felt, spent far too
many years chasing moonbeams, exciting, glistening ideas that always
just eluded him. Maybe he should have realized long ago that Noam
and his earthling mates were born with abilities which were not
available to people from Jupiter, just as Noam didn’t take easily to
the toe-wiggling that came so easily to the Jupiter inhabitants.
But what exactly was it that the earthlings could do? What under-
pinned their ability to talk to each other? Even before they started
chatting, they seemed to have some hidden understanding of others.
It wasn’t just that they had formulaic ways of greeting each other,
and (mostly) took it in turns to talk. Astonishingly, they seemed to
be able to look into the other person’s mind, and to guess (correctly)
whether he or she needed to be helped or left alone. This type of
mind-reading seemed truly amazing! And, judging from talking to
Noam’s crew, it was an ability which earthling babies developed early
on in their lives. They not only had an enviable facility for combining
sounds into words, and words into longer sequences, but they were
also able to ﬁnd the words they wanted remarkably fast, even though
there seemed to be tens of thousands of them!
Eventually, the Emperor of Jupiter decided that he was profoundly
grateful to Noam, because without Noam’s inspiration he and his
fellow Jupiterians might never have realized how interesting, and how
important, human language was. But the time had now come to move
on to other areas of interest. In particular, he wanted to think about

the relationship between a grammar and the way that grammar is used
in actual speech. Noam had been most unclear on this point.
To conclude, the Emperor of Jupiter felt, as eventually did earth-
bound linguists, that Noam Chomsky had usefully highlighted the
importance of language, and drawn attention to some of its key
properties. But he had not explained clearly the link between the
grammar of a language, and the way that grammar could be used in
actual speech.
This will be the topic of the next chapter.

The white elephant problem
Do we need a grammar in
order to speak?
‘I have answered three questions, and that is enough,’
Said his father; ‘don’t give yourself airs! 
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff? 
Be off, or I’ll kick you downstairs!’ 
Lewis Carroll, Old Father William 
Chomsky, for around half a century, tried to ‘capture’ a speaker’s
abstract knowledge of language. But it remained unclear how know-
ledge related to usage. According to Chomsky, the two were rather
distant, since he denied that linguistic knowledge is directly related to
the way we understand and produce utterances. This leads to a crucial
and rather startling question: can a grammar actually be irrelevant to
the problem of understanding and producing speech?
If we had put this question to a hardcore linguist, at a time when
Chomsky’s views were dominant, he would probably have answered:
‘Of course language knowledge and language usage are not totally
separate, they just have to be studied separately, because the relationship
between them is indirect.’
If we persisted, and said, ‘What exactly do you mean by an indirect
relationship?’ he would probably have said: ‘Look, please stop bothering
me with silly questions. The relationship between language usage and
language knowledge is not my concern. Let me put you straight. All
normal people seem to have a tacit knowledge of their language. If
that knowledge is there, it is my duty as a linguist to describe it. But
it is not my job to tell you how that knowledge is used. I leave that
to the psychologists.’
This, to a psycholinguist, seemed an extremely unhappy state of
affairs. She is just as much interested in language usage as language
knowledge. In fact, she ﬁnds it quite odd that anybody is able to

concentrate on one rather than the other of these factors, since they
seem to her to go together rather closely. Consequently, in this chapter,
we shall be brieﬂy examining both Chomsky’s views and attempts
made by psycholinguists to assess the relationship between a linguist’s
grammar and the way someone produces and comprehends sentences.
Linguistic knowledge
Chomsky (1965) claimed that the grammar he proposed ‘expresses the
speaker-hearer’s knowledge of the language’. This knowledge was
latent or ‘tacit’, and ‘may well not be immediately available to the
user of the language’ (Chomsky 1965: 21).
The notion of tacit or latent knowledge is a rather vague one, and
may cover more than Chomsky intended. It seems to cover two types
of knowledge. On the one hand, it consists of knowing how to produce
and comprehend utterances. This involves using a rule system, but it
does not necessarily involve any awareness of the rules – just as a
spider can spin a web successfully without any awareness of the
principles it is following. On the other hand, knowledge of a language
also covers the ability to make various kinds of judgements about the
language. The speaker not only knows the rules, but in addition,
knows something about that knowledge. For example, speakers can
quickly distinguish between well-formed and deviant sentences. An
English-speaker would unhesitatingly accept:
HANK MUCH PREFERS CAVIARE TO SARDINES.
but would quickly reject:
*HANK CAVIARE TO SARDINES MUCH PREFERS.
In addition, mature speakers of a language can recognize sentence
relatedness. They ‘know’ that a sentence:
FADING FLOWERS LOOK SAD.
is closely related to:
FLOWERS WHICH ARE FADING LOOK SAD.
and that:
IT ASTONISHED US THAT BUZZ SWALLOWED THE OCTOPUS WHOLE.

is related to:
THAT BUZZ SWALLOWED THE OCTOPUS WHOLE ASTONISHED US.
Moreover, they can distinguish between sentences which look superﬁ-
cially alike but in fact are quite different, as in:
EATING APPLES CAN BE GOOD FOR YOU.
(Is it good to eat a type of apple called an eating apple, or is any type
of apple good to eat?), or:
SHOOTING STARS CAN BE FRIGHTENING.
SHOOTING BUFFALOES CAN BE FRIGHTENING.
(How do you know who is doing the shooting?)
There seems to be no doubt whatsoever that a ‘classic’ (1965)
transformational grammar encapsulated this second type of knowledge,
the speaker’s awareness of language structure. People do have intuitions
or knowledge of the type speciﬁed above, and a transformational
grammar did seem to describe this.
However, it is by no means clear how a ‘classic’ transformational
grammar or the later ‘minimalist program’ related to the ﬁrst type of
knowledge – the knowledge of how to actually use language. Chomsky
claimed that a speaker’s internal grammar has an important bearing
on the production and comprehension of utterances, but he made it
quite clear that this grammar ‘does not, in itself, prescribe the character
or functioning of a perceptual model or a model of speech production’
(Chomsky 1965: 9). And at one point he even labelled as ‘absurd’
any attempt to link the grammar directly to processes of production
and comprehension (Chomsky 1967: 399).
This viewpoint persisted in his later work, where he denied that
knowledge had anything to do with ability to use a language: ‘Ability
is one thing, knowledge something quite different’ (Chomsky 1986:
12), commenting that ‘we should follow normal usage in distinguishing
clearly between knowledge and ability to use that knowledge’. And
as we have seen, the type of knowledge outlined in his later theories
is considerably more abstract and deep-seated than that involved in a
‘classic’ transformational grammar.
In short, Chomsky is interested primarily in ‘the system of knowledge
that underlies the use and understanding of language’ rather than in
‘actual or potential behaviour’ (Chomsky 1986: 24).

Let us put the matter in another way. Anyone who knows a language
can do three things:
1
Produce sentences.
LANGUAGE
2
Comprehend sentences.
USAGE
3
Store linguistic knowledge.
LANGUAGE
KNOWLEDGE
We are saying that Chomsky’s proposals seem undoubtedly to cover
(3), but appear to be separate from, or only indirectly related to (1)
and (2).
LANGUAGE
LANGUAGE
USAGE
KNOWLEDGE
This is a rather puzzling state of affairs. Is it possible for linguistic
knowledge to be completely separate from language usage? This is the
topic of the rest of the chapter. We shall start by looking at the earliest
psycholinguistic experiments on the topic, which were carried out in
the early 1960s.
The years of illusion
When Chomsky’s ideas spread across into the ﬁeld of psychology in
the early 1960s they made an immediate impact. Psychologists at once
started to test the relevance of a transformational grammar to the way
we process sentences. Predictably, their ﬁrst instinct was to test whether
there was a direct relationship between the two.
At this time, two different but similar viewpoints were put forward.
The ﬁrst was a strong and fairly implausible theory, sometimes known
as the ‘correspondence hypothesis’, and the second was a weaker and
(slightly) more plausible idea known as the ‘derivational theory of
complexity’ or DTC for short.
Supporters of the correspondence hypothesis postulated a close corre-
spondence between the form of a transformational grammar, and the
operations employed by someone when they produce or comprehend
speech. Supposedly ‘the sequence of rules used in the grammatical
derivation of a sentence . . . corresponds step by step to the sequence
of psychological processes that are executed when a person processes
the sentence’ (Hayes 1970: 5). This was soon found to be unlikely.

The white elephant problem

Supporters of DTC put forward a weaker hypothesis. They suggested
that the more complex the transformational derivation of a sentence
– that is, the more transformations were involved – the more difﬁcult
it would be to produce or comprehend. They did not, however,
assume a one-to-one correspondence between the speaker’s mental
processes and grammatical operations.
A number of now famous experiments were devised to test these
claims. Perhaps the best-known was a sentence-matching experiment
by George Miller of Harvard University (Miller 1962; Miller and
McKean 1964).
Miller reasoned that if the number of transformations signiﬁcantly
affected processing difﬁculty, then this difﬁculty should be measurable
in terms of time. In other words, the more transformations a sentence
had, the longer it should take to cope with. For example, a passive
sentence such as:
THE OLD WOMAN WAS WARNED BY JOE.
should be harder to handle than a simple active afﬁrmative declarative
(or SAAD for short) such as:
JOE WARNED THE OLD WOMAN.
since the passive sentence required an additional transformation.
However, this passive should be easier to handle than a passive negative
such as:
THE OLD WOMAN WASN’T WARNED BY JOE.
which required one more transformation still.
In order to test this hypothesis, Miller gave his subjects two columns
of jumbled sentences, and asked them to ﬁnd pairs which went together.
The sentences to be paired differed from one another in a speciﬁed
way. For example, in one section of the experiment actives and passives
were jumbled, so that a passive such as:
THE SMALL BOY WAS LIKED BY JANE.
had to be matched with its ‘partner’:
JANE LIKED THE SMALL BOY.

And:
JOE WARNED THE OLD WOMAN.
had to be paired with:
THE OLD WOMAN WAS WARNED BY JOE.
Miller assumed that the subjects had to strip the sentences of their
transformations in order to match them up. The more they differed
from each other, the longer the matching would take, he predicted.
Miller carried out this experiment twice, the second time with strict
electronic time-controls (a so-called ‘tachistoscopic’ method). His results
delighted him. Just as he had hoped, it took nearly twice as long to
match sentences which differed by two transformations as it took 
to match sentences which differed by only one transformation. When
he added the time needed to match actives with passives (approximately
1.65 seconds) to the time taken to pair afﬁrmatives with negatives
(approximately 1.40 seconds), the total added up to almost the same
as that required for matching active with passive negative sentences
(approximately 3.12 seconds).
Miller seemed to have proved that transformations were ‘psychologically
real’, since each transformation took up a measurable processing time.
But this period of illusion was shortlived. A time of disappointment
and disillusion followed. Fodor and Garrett (1966) gave a crushing
paper at the Edinburgh University conference on psycholinguistics 
in March 1966, in which they clearly showed the emptiness of the
‘correspondence hypothesis’ and DTC. They gave detailed theoretical

reasons why hearers do not ‘unwind’ transformations when they
comprehend speech. For example, the correspondence hypothesis
entailed the consequence that people do not begin to decode what
they are hearing until a sentence was complete. It assumed that, after
waiting until they had heard all of it, hearers then undressed the
sentence transformation by transformation. But this was clearly wrong,
it would take much too long. In fact, it can be shown that hearers
start processing what they hear as soon as a speaker begins talking.
In addition, Fodor and Garrett pointed out ﬂaws in the experiments
carried out by Miller and others. The transformations, such as passive
and negative, on which their results crucially depended, were atypical.
Negatives changed the meaning, and passives moved the actor away
from its normal place at the beginning of an English sentence. Passives
and negatives are also longer than SAADs, so it was not surprising
that they took longer to match and were more difﬁcult to memorize.
The difﬁculty of these sentences need not have anything to do with
transformational complexity. Fodor and Garrett pointed out that some
other transformations made no difference to processing difﬁculty. There
was no detectable difference in the time taken to comprehend:
JOHN PHONES UP THE GIRL.
and
JOHN PHONES THE GIRL UP.
If the correspondence hypothesis or DTC was correct, the second
should be more difﬁcult, according to the ‘classic’ version of trans-
formational grammar, because a ‘particle separation’ transformation had
been applied, separating PHONES and UP. Worse still for the theory
were sentences such as:
BILL RUNS FASTER THAN JOHN RUNS .
BILL RUNS FASTER THAN JOHN.
The second sentence had one more transformation than the ﬁrst,
because the word RUNS had been deleted. In theory it should be
more difﬁcult to comprehend, but in practice it was easier.
Fodor and Garrett followed their 1966 conference paper with another
article in 1967 where they pointed out more problem constructions
(Fodor and Garrett 1967). For example, DTC counter-intuitively
treated ‘truncated’ passives such as:

THE BOY WAS HIT.
as more complex than full passives such as:
THE BOY WAS HIT BY SOMEONE.
After this, researcher after researcher came up with similar difﬁculties.
According to DTC:
THERE’S A DRAGON IN THE STREET.
should have been more difﬁcult to process than:
A DRAGON IS IN THE STREET.
Yet the opposite is true (Watt 1970). And so on.
Both the correspondence hypothesis and DTC had to be abandoned.
Transformational grammar in its ‘classic’ form was not a model of the
production and comprehension of speech, and derivational complexity
as measured in terms of transformations did not correlate with processing
complexity. Clearly, Chomsky was right when he denied that there
was a direct relationship between language knowledge, as encapsulated
in a 1965 version of transformational grammar, and language usage.
The deep structure hypothesis
By the mid-1960s, the majority of psycholinguists had realized quite
clearly that transformations as then formulated had no direct relevance
to the way a person produces and understands a sentence. However,
the irrelevance of transformations did not mean that other aspects of
transformational grammar were also irrelevant. So in the late 1960s
another hypothesis was put forward – the suggestion that when people
process sentences, they mentally set up a Chomsky-like deep structure.
In other words, when someone produces, comprehends or recalls a
sentence, ‘the speaker-hearer’s internal representation of grammatical
relations is mediated by structures that are isomorphic to those that
the grammatical formalism employs’ (Fodor et al. 1974: 262). Some
‘click’ experiments were superﬁcially encouraging (Bever, et al. 1969).
The aim of the ‘click’ experiments was to test whether a person
recovers a Chomsky-like deep structure (1965 version) when she
decodes. The experimenters took pairs of sentences which had similar
surface structures, but different deep structures. For example:

THE CORRUPT POLICE CAN’T BEAR CRIMINALS TO CONFESS
QUICKLY.
THE CORRUPT POLICE CAN’T FORCE CRIMINALS TO CONFESS
QUICKLY.
In the ﬁrst sentence, the word criminals occurred once only in the
deep structure, but in the second sentence it occurred twice according
to a ‘classic’ transformational model. If anyone doubts that these
sentences have a different deep structure, try turning them round into
the passive, and the difference becomes clear: the first sentence
immediately becomes quite ungrammatical, though there is nothing
wrong with the second:
*CRIMINALS CANNOT BE BORNE BY THE POLICE TO CONFESS
QUICKLY.
CRIMINALS CANNOT BE FORCED BY THE POLICE TO CONFESS
QUICKLY.
In the experiment, the subjects were asked to wear headphones.
Then the sentences were played into one ear, and a ‘click’ which
occurred during the word CRIMINALS was played into the other.

Subjects were asked to report whereabouts in the sentence they heard
the click. In the ﬁrst sentence, subjects tended to hear the click before
the word CRIMINALS, where a Chomskyan deep structure suggests
a structural break:
THE CORRUPT POLICE CAN’T BEAR / CRIMINALS TO CONFESS
QUICKLY.
But in the second sentence, the click stayed still, as if the hearers could
not decide where the structural break occurred. They behaved as if
CRIMINALS straddled the gap between the two sections of the
sentence. Since CRIMINALS occurred twice in the deep structure,
with the structural break between the two occurrences, this was an
encouraging result:
THE CORRUPT POLICE CAN’T FORCE CRIMINALS/CRIMINALS TO
CONFESS QUICKLY.
This suggested that people might recover a ‘classic’ deep structure
when they decoded a sentence.
But one swallow does not make a summer, and one experiment
could not maintain the validity of deep structure. Both the design and
interpretation of this particular experiment have been challenged. The
results might have been due to the unusual experimental situation, or
they could have been connected with meaning rather than with an
underlying deep structure syntax (Fillenbaum 1971; Johnson-Laird 1974).
The use of clicks and the ‘muddled history of clickology’ (Johnson-
Laird 1974: 138) was, and still is a source of considerable controversy.
To summarize, a few early experiments were consistent with the
suggestion that people recover a Chomsky-like deep structure when
they recalled or understood sentences. But they were consistent with
other hypotheses also. All that we could be sure about was that under-
lying every sentence was a set of internal relations which may well
not be obvious on the surface. As Bever noted (1970: 286):
The fact that every sentence has an internal and external structure
is maintained by all linguistic theories – although the theories may
differ as to the role the internal structure plays within the linguistic
description. Thus talking involves actively mapping internal struc-

tures on to external sequences, and understanding others involves
mapping external sequences on to internal structures.
In other words, it is very unlikely that we recover a Chomskyan (1965)
deep structure when we understand sentences, though no one ever
totally disproved this possibility.
The key point is, science proceeds by disproving hypotheses, not by
proving them. Suppose you were interested in ﬂowers. You might
formulate a hypothesis, ‘All roses are white, red, pink, orange or
yellow.’ There would be absolutely no point at all in collecting
hundreds, thousands or even millions of white, red, pink, orange and
yellow roses. You would merely be collecting additional evidence
consistent with your hypothesis. If you were genuinely interested in
making a botanical advance, you would send people in all directions
hunting for black, blue, mauve or green roses. Your hypothesis would
stand until somebody found a blue rose. Then, in theory, you should
be delighted that botany had made progress, and found out about blue
roses. Naturally, when you formulate a hypothesis it has to be one
which is capable of disproof. A hypothesis such as ‘Henry VIII would
have disliked spaceships’ cannot be disproved, and consequently is
useless. A hypothesis such as ‘The planet Neptune is made of chalk’
would have been useless in the year AD 100, when there was no hope
of getting to Neptune – but it is a perfectly legitimate, if implau-
sible, one in the twenty-ﬁrst century when planet probes and space
travel are becoming routine.
This leads us back to Chomsky. Some people have claimed that
because deep structures could not be disproved, they were useless as
a scientiﬁc hypothesis. It is true that, at the moment, it is difﬁcult to
see how they might have been tested. But psycholinguistic experimen-
tation takes steps forward all the time. Perhaps with the development
of further new techniques, ways will be found of deﬁnitively disproving
theories about the ‘inner structure’ of a language. At the moment, as
one psycholinguist noted ‘Presently available evidence on almost any
psycholinguistic point is so scanty as to blunt any claim that this or
that hypothesis has truly been disconﬁrmed’ (Watt 1970: 138). The
same is true today.
To sum up, the suggestion that people utilize a Chomskyan deep
structure (1965 version) when they comprehend or produce sentences
seems increasingly unlikely, but the hypothesis has not been truly
disconﬁrmed. So was this work all wasted? Probably not. At the very
least, it has enabled us to think more clearly about language and what
it involves.

The linguistic archive
We have now come to the conclusion that 1965-style transformations
are irrelevant to sentence processing, and that deep structure is quite
unlikely to be relevant. But some steps forward have been made.
We are coming round to the view that a classic (1965) trans-
formational grammar represents metaphorically a kind of archive which
sits in the brain ready for consultation, but is possibly only partially
consulted in the course of a conversation. Perhaps it could be likened
to other types of knowledge, such as the knowledge that four times
three is the same as six times two. This information is mentally stored,
but is not necessarily directly used when checking to see if the milk
bill is correct.
The information is probably represented in the brain in a rather
different way from that suggested in a 1965-style transformational
grammar. But such a grammar might provide a useful way of encapsu-
lating speakers’ latent knowledge of their language.
We are not assuming a clean break between language knowledge
and language usage. In practice the two overlap to a quite considerable
extent, and the extent of the overlap varies from sentence to sentence.
Let us take a simple example:
AUNT AGATHA WAS RUN OVER LAST THURSDAY.
A short passive of this type is generally simpler and quicker to compre-
hend than a full passive such as:
AUNT AGATHA WAS RUN DOWN BY SOMEONE (OR SOMETHING)
LAST THURSDAY.

It therefore seems quite unnecessary to suppose that, in order to
understand the sentence, hearers have to recover a Chomsky-like deep
structure which includes the agent SOMEONE (or SOMETHING):
SOMEONE (OR SOMETHING) RAN OVER AUNT AGATHA LAST
THURSDAY.
Instead, they may not pay attention to the agent, they may be too
busy thinking about Aunt Agatha. However, if they did spend rather
longer pondering about the sentence, they could recover not only the
agent SOMEONE (or SOMETHING) which the ‘classic’ deep struc-
ture suggests, but much more information in addition (Watt 1970).
They could suggest that Aunt Agatha was run over by SOMETHING,
rather than SOMEONE, and that this something was probably a
MOVING VEHICLE. They obtained all this information from their
knowledge of the lexical item RUN OVER – but it is optional
whether they use it or not when they comprehend the sentence.
And RUN OVER is not an isolated example. Another verb from
which a person could also extract a considerable amount of information
if necessary is GORE (Watt 1970). In the sentence:
CHARLIE WAS GORED.
the hearer can assume that the gorer was male and bovine. In other
words, a bull. This information is potentially recoverable, though it
need not be recovered.
In short, someone who knows a language has an enormous amount
of knowledge which she could use when she understands or produces
a sentence, but she does not have to. Or rather, she usually has to
use some of it, but often only a rather small proportion.
Another example is the sentence:
DROWNING HEFFALUMPS CAN CAUSE A TERRIBLE COMMOTION.
Here, the hearer might well subconsciously have to query, ‘Are we
dealing with heffalumps which are drowning, or someone who is
drowning heffalumps?’ And he might even put his query into words.
This again suggests that a ‘classic’ transformational grammar repre-
sented a linguistic archive whose contents are available for use when
a person processes a sentence. In principle, someone could, if he wanted
to, recover all the knowledge stored in connection with a sentence
when he understands or produces it. This may be what Chomsky
meant when he wrote that:

the generative grammar represents the information concerning
sentence structure that is available, in principle, to one who has
acquired a language. It indicates how, ideally . . . he would
understand a sentence.
(Chomsky 1963: 326)
The word ‘ideally’ may mean perfect understanding of the sentence
as far as is possible within the limits of grammatical and lexical
knowledge. Of course, in practice, no one has the time or the need
to unravel every sentence in this way. Most people make a quick
decision about the sentences they hear, and do not consider all the
ramiﬁcations. In Bever’s words, they rely on ‘perceptual strategies’ or
short cuts, rather than on full utilization of ‘epistemological structures’
or beliefs about language structure (Bever 1970: 281).
But it would be a mistake to assume that ‘epistemological structures’
are an optional extra. A person who could not detect ambiguities,
who could not make judgements of grammaticality and who could
not link up related sentences would only ‘know’ their language in a
very limited way. There is no clear-cut line between knowing how
to utter and comprehend sentences, and knowing that these sentences
are grammatical and how they are related to other sentences. Humans
do not behave like spiders, who can weave webs without any conscious
knowledge about their skill. Humans need knowledge about their
language in order to function properly as articulate mammals. As far
as language is concerned, the distinction between knowing how (as in
knowing how to walk) and knowing that (as in knowing that the
world is round) is a fuzzy one, because the two types of knowledge
overlap.
Let us summarize what we have just said. We have concluded that
a transformational grammar, in its classic form, incorporates mainly
‘archival knowledge’ or ‘epistemological structures’ – a set of beliefs
or intuitions about one’s language which may not necessarily be
recoverable at a conscious level. These beliefs are not merely optional
extras, they are an essential part of anyone’s ability to speak and
understand a language.
How are these ‘epistemological structures’ acquired? Do children
learn how to use language, then later build up full knowledge about
it? Or do the two learning processes go on simultaneously? This
question was studied by three psychologists from the University of
Pennsylvania (Gleitman et al. 1972). They concluded that the process
of learning how to speak was intertwined with that of acquiring beliefs
about one’s language. Both types of knowledge progress simultaneously,

though the latter develops rather more slowly. Even 2-year-olds have
some notion of grammaticality, though this is rather shaky. And
children’s judgements about their language remain shaky even when
they can speak ﬂuently. But between the ages of 5 and 8 children
start to have intuitions about their language that parallel those of an
adult. Let us illustrate these points.
Even quite young children have some beliefs about their language,
as shown by 2-year-old Allison, who judged the sequence:
*BALL ME THE THROW.
to be ‘silly’, and corrected it to:
THROW ME THE BALL.
Similarly, 2-year-old Sarah amended:
*SONG ME A SING.
to:
SING ME A SONG.
However, Sarah’s judgements were not consistently reliable, since she
found:
WASH THE DISHES.
an odd sentence, and corrected it to:
WASH THE DISHES(!)
It was easier to elicit responses from the older children, and the
results were more clear-cut. For example, when seven children between
the ages of 5 and 8 were asked whether the sentence:
I AM KNOWING YOUR SISTER.
sounded ‘sensible’ or ‘silly’, the 5- and 6-year-olds found nothing
wrong with it, but the 7- and 8-year-olds disapproved of it, though
they could not always say why it was odd. The following is the response
given by 7-year-old Claire:

R (Researcher):
How about this one: I AM KNOWING YOUR
SISTER.
C (Claire):
No. I KNOW YOUR SISTER.
R:
Why not I AM KNOWING YOUR SISTER? You
can say I AM EATING YOUR DINNER.
C:
It’s different! (shouting) You say different sentences
in different ways. Otherwise it doesn’t make sense!
But for other sentences, Claire not only gave adult judgements
concerning grammaticality, she also gave an adult-type reason:
R:
How about this one: BOY IS AT THE DOOR.
C:
If his name is BOY. You should – the kid is named John, see?
JOHN IS AT THE DOOR or A BOY IS AT THE DOOR.
The researchers noted:
The ability to reﬂect upon language dramatically increases with
age. The older children were better not only in noting deviance
but also in explaining where the deviance lies.
(Gleitman et al. 1972: 160)
Spontaneous repairs – cases in which a child corrects himself or
herself without prompting – provide another way of looking at
children’s awareness of language structure (Karmiloff-Smith 1986).
Younger children often provide unnecessary repairs, as in:
YOU PUT THE CHURCH – THE TINY LITTLE CHURCH INTO THE TIN.
Since only one church was involved, this alteration by a 4-year-old
was not essential. Slightly older children tend to correct themselves if
their original speech could lead to misunderstanding:
LEND ME THE BALL – THE GREEN BALL.
This repair by a 5-year-old was important, because there were several
different coloured balls around. However, the most sophisticated repairs
are those which are inessential for getting across the right message,
yet show a deep understanding of the linguistic system:
AND THEN FORTUNATELY THE GIRL – A GIRL OFFERS THE DOG A
BONE.

Since there was only one girl in the story, this 6-year-old need not
have changed the to a. But since no girl had yet appeared in the story,
the change reﬂected a realization that it would have been correct to
use the only if a girl had previously been mentioned.
Repairs, then, reﬂect a deepening awareness of the linguistic system.
First, children can correctly use constructions, but cannot repair their
mistakes. At a later stage, they begin to use repairs, sometimes sophisti-
cated ones. Finally, they are able to explain various linguistic points.
Psycholinguistics without linguistics?
We can now summarize the conclusions reached in this chapter. We
have been examining the relationship between language knowledge
(as ‘captured’ by the classic version of transformational grammar) and
the way in which we handle sentences. In the ﬁrst section we noted
that transformations were irrelevant to the way in which we produce
and comprehend language. In the second section, we saw that the
hypothesis that we recover a classic Chomsky-like deep structure
when we comprehend a sentence was unlikely. In the ﬁnal section
we concluded that a 1965 transformational grammar represented a
person’s linguistic archive – a store of knowledge about language that
is only partially utilized in the course of conversations. This archive
develops simultaneously with, though rather more slowly than, the
ability to speak and comprehend sentences.
Chomsky’s latest ideas, however, have not been discussed. This is
largely because they have not been tested by psychologists, for two
reasons. First, many of them turned away from transformational gram-
mar in disappointment. As one noted: ‘By the mid 1970s there remained
no unequivocal evidence that transformational grammars provided a
model of either the rules or representations that listeners and speakers
use during comprehension. As a result, psycholinguistics largely severed
its ties with linguistics’ (Tanenhaus 1988: 11). Second, Chomsky’s
more recent ideas are mostly too imprecise and abstract to test.
Does this mean that psycholinguists can safely ignore abstract linguists
such as Chomsky in the future? Should they turn to other linguistic
theories, or give up linguistics altogether?
In order to answer this point, let us brieﬂy consider the relationship
of language knowledge to usage in Chomsky’s changing systems.
Perhaps a cooking analogy might make this clearer, since it can illustrate
the various levels of knowledge that might be involved.
Take chocolate mousse. Even a child might make a perfect mousse
by following instructions, without any understanding of what she was

doing, or what a mousse should look like. In language, this is equivalent
to a young child who can talk, but has as yet little awareness of
linguistic structure. Chomsky, as we have seen, has never regarded
this ‘how to do it’ level as being his concern.
The next level involves a notion of what a proper mousse should
look like, as well as a growing understanding of how a chocolate
mousse relates in its composition to other mousses, such as salmon
mousse or lemon mousse. In language, this is the level at which a
person can reliably judge what is, and what is not a well-formed
sentence. It is also the level at which sentences such as IT IS HARD
TO HANDLE FLAMINGOS and FLAMINGOS ARE HARD TO
HANDLE can be judged to be paraphrases of one another. This is
the type of knowledge encapsulated in the classic (1965) version of a
transformational grammar.
But there is a ﬁnal, more basic level. This is the discovery that only
a few fundamental principles underlie the whole of cooking. For
example, trapping gas particles within food is the way to make it large
in volume and light, a process found in mousse and buns. Or heating
causes liquid to evaporate, and the remaining molecules to cling
together, as in fried eggs or fudge. These principles are so general,
and apply to such a wide range of foods, that they are unlikely to
become apparent to the average cook, although she may underlyingly
‘know’ them, as she prepares food. In relation to language, this basic
level is the one Chomsky and his followers ﬁnally aimed at: a few
simple principles which would show how the whole thing works
Such a grandiose aim, if achieved, would be of great importance
to psycholinguists. At the moment, it is unclear how one might test
Chomsky’s ﬂuctuating and somewhat vague proposals (as we have
already noted). He himself has likened linguistic theories to those put
forward by physicists to account for why the sun’s light gets converted
into heat (Chomsky 1978: 202). Scientists cannot send a probe into
the sun, so they have to make the best guess they can from the light
emitted at the sun’s outermost layers. Linguists cannot as yet reliably
identify grammar in the brain, so similar guesses have to be made.
Such theory-building is a valid enterprise. Speculation has led to
great steps forward in some areas of science. It would therefore be
foolish of psycholinguists to ignore it. Meanwhile, it makes sense for
them to push ahead, ﬁnding out independently how humans understand
and produce speech. These are the topics of the next two chapters.

10 The case of the missing
ﬁngerprint
How do we understand speech?
‘It seems very pretty,’ Alice said, ‘but it’s rather hard to understand.’
You see, she didn’t like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn’t
make it out at all. ‘Somehow it seems to ﬁll my head with ideas – only
I don’t know exactly what they are!’ 
Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass 
‘Sentence comprehension is like riding a bicycle – a feat far easier
performed than described’ (Cutler 1976: 134). This feat is the topic
of this chapter.
First, however, we should consider whether there might be a link
between speech comprehension and production. It would be simpler
for psycholinguists if they were directly related. However, there is no
reason to assume this is so, any more than we should presume that
the same muscles are used in sucking and blowing. We must therefore
allow for four possibilities:
1
Comprehension and production are totally different.
2
Comprehension is production in reverse.
3
Comprehension is the same as production: that is, comprehenders
reconstruct the message for themselves in the same way as they
would construct it if they were speakers.
4
Comprehension and production are partially the same and partially
different.
This range of options means that we must deal with comprehension
and production separately. We shall begin with speech understanding,
because this has been more intensively studied.

Hearing what we expect to hear
At the beginning of the twentieth century, psycholinguists assumed
that the process of understanding speech was a simple one. The hearer
was envisaged, metaphorically, as a secretary taking down a dictation.
She mentally wrote down the sounds she heard one by one, then read
off the words formed by them. Or, taking another metaphor, the
hearer was envisaged as a detective solving a crime by matching
ﬁngerprints to known criminals. All the detective had to do was match
a ﬁngerprint found on the scene of the crime against one on his ﬁles,
and see who it belonged to. Just as no two people’s ﬁngerprints are
the same, so each sound was regarded as having a unique acoustic
pattern.
Unfortunately, this simple picture turns out to be wrong. A series
of experiments conducted by phoneticians and psycholinguists disproved
the ‘passive secretary’ or ‘ﬁngerprints’ approach. There are a number
of problems.
First of all, it is clear that hearers cannot ‘take down’ or ‘match’
sounds one by one. Apart from anything else, the speed of utterance
makes this an impossible task. If we assume an average of four sounds
per English word, and a speed of ﬁve words a second, we are expecting
the ear and brain to cope with around twenty sounds a second. But
humans cannot process this number of separate signals in that time –
it is just too many (Liberman et al. 1967).
A second reason why the ‘passive secretary’ or ‘ﬁngerprint’ approach
does not work is that there is no ﬁxed acoustic representation of, say,
a T, parallel to the ﬁxed typewriter symbol T. The acoustic traces left
by sounds are quite unlike the ﬁngerprints left by criminals. In actual
speech, each sound varies considerably depending on what comes
before and after it. The T in TOP differs from the T in STOP or
the T in BOTTLE. In addition, a sound varies from speaker to speaker
to a quite surprising extent. So direct matching of each sound is
impossible.
A third, related problem is that sounds are acoustically on a
continuum: B gradually shades into D which in turn shades into G.
There is no deﬁnite borderline between acoustically similar sounds,
just as it is not always possible to distinguish between a ﬂower vase
and a mug, or a bush and a tree (Liberman et al. 1967).
These ﬁndings indicate that there is no sure way in which a human
can ‘ﬁngerprint’ a sound or match it to a single mental symbol, because
the acoustic patterns of sounds are not ﬁxed and distinct. And even
if they were, people would not have time to identify each one positively.

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

The information extracted from the sound waves forms ‘no more 
than a rough guide to the sense of the message, a kind of scaffolding
upon which the listener constructs or reconstructs the sentences’ (Fry
1970: 31).
In interpreting speech sounds, hearers are like detectives who ﬁnd
that solving a crime is not a simple case of matching ﬁngerprints to
criminals. Instead, they ﬁnd a situation where ‘a given type of clue
might have been left by any of a number of criminals or where a
given criminal might have left any of a number of different types of
clue’ (Fodor et al. 1974: 301). What they are faced with is ‘more like
the array of disparate data from which Sherlock Holmes deduces the
identity of the criminal.’ In such cases, the detectives’ background
information must come into play.
In other words, deciphering the sounds of speech is an active not a
passive process. Hearers have to compute actively the possible phonetic
message by using their background knowledge of the language. This
is perhaps not so astonishing. We have plenty of other evidence for
the active nature of this process. We all know how difﬁcult it is to
hear the exact sounds of a foreign word. This is because we are so
busy imposing on it what we expect to hear, in terms of our own
language habits, that we fail to notice certain novel features.
Identifying words
Listeners try ﬁrst of all to identify words. They are ‘constrained by
the sounds of language, on the one hand, and by the desire to make
sense of what they hear on the other’ (Bond 1999: xvii). Consequently,
we can ﬁnd out quite a lot by looking both at English word structure,
and at mishearings or ‘slips of the ear’. English words contain some
useful clues about their beginnings and endings. For example, T at
the beginning of a word has a puff of breath (aspiration) after it, and
–ING often comes at the end of a word. As a result, when someone
mishears a word, it is typically a whole word: 85 per cent of mishearings
involved single words in one study (Browman 1980). And this has
been conﬁrmed by later studies, as with RACING for RAISING in
the sentence: ‘He’s in the turkey-raising businesss’, GRANDMA for
GRAMMAR in the phrase ‘Grammar Workshop’, and CHAMELEON
heard as COMEDIAN (Bond 1999).
As soon as a hearer comes across the beginning of a word, he or
she starts making preliminary guesses as to what it might be. It would
take far too long to check out each guess one by one, and numerous
words are considered at the same time: ‘There is now considerable

evidence that, during spoken-word recognition, listeners evaluate
multiple lexical hypotheses in parallel’ (McQueen 2005: 230).
Exactly how this is done is disputed. One suggestion is that as 
soon as the beginning of a word is detected, the hearer immediately
ﬂashes up onto his or her mental screen a whole army of words with
a similar beginning. The hearer hears maybe ‘HAVE YOU SEEN
MY P . . . ?’ At this point her mind conjures up a whole list of words
which start in a similar way, maybe ‘PACK, PAD, PADLOCK, PAN,
PANDA, PANSY’. This idea is known as the ‘cohort’ model. Words
beginning with the same sounds were envisaged as lining up like
soldiers in a cohort, a division of the Roman army (Marslen-Wilson
and Tyler 1980). The hearer then eliminates those that do not ﬁt in
with the sound or meaning of the rest of the sentence. But the cohort
model, in its original form, did not allow for the fact that even if a
hearer missed the ﬁrst sound, it was still possible to make a plausible
guess about the word being heard. If someone heard BLEASANT
then the degree of overlap with PLEASANT, and the lack of any
word BLEASANT, together with the context, allowed the hearer 
to make a good guess. So the model was amended to allow for 
more than just the initial sound, even though it was widely recognized
that initial sounds, if heard properly, are very important for word
identiﬁcation.
But this widening of the information accessed meant that the revised
cohort model was similar to another, more powerful type of framework,
known as ‘spreading activation’ or ‘interactive activation’ models, which
can be envisaged as working somewhat like electric circuitry, in which
the current ﬂows backwards and forwards, rushing between the initial
sounds heard, and the words aroused. The sounds will activate multiple
meanings, then the other meanings triggered will arouse further sounds.
BLEASANT would eventually fade away, but PLEASANT might
trigger, say, PHEASANT, PLEASURE, and others. Those which ﬁtted
in with other aspects of the sentence, the meaning and the syntax,
would get more and more activated, and those which seemed unlikely
would fade away. These network models, in which everything is
(ultimately) connected to everything else, are sometimes referred to
by the general label ‘connectionism’ (McClelland and Elman 1986).
Inevitably, controversy exists as to how such models work, and
several variants have been proposed. A model that is currently being
assessed is labelled ‘Shortlist’ (Norris 1994, 2005), which proposes that
‘a lexical lookup process . . . identiﬁes all the words that correspond
to sequences of phonemes in the input. So, for example, the input
CATALOG would match the words CAT, CATTLE, A, LOG, and

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

CATALOG.’ (Norris 2005: 336). Here, CATALOG would emerge
as the winner, as shown in the following diagram.
Hearers are not aware of these multiple word choices, just as they
are unaware that when they hear an ambiguous word (such as BANK
which could be a ﬁnancial institution or the edge of a river) they
mentally consider more than one meaning. This somewhat suprising
discovery was made well over a quarter of a century ago, when
psycholinguists were first seriously interested in ambiguity. They
discovered that hearers consider multiple meanings, though often
subconsciously. When subjects were asked to check for the presence
of a given sound in a sentence (‘Press a button if you come to a word
starting with B’), a procedure known as ‘phoneme monitoring’, an
ambiguous word slowed them down even when they claimed not to
have noticed the ambiguity (Foss 1970). For example, they responded
more slowly to the B in a sentence such as:
THE SEAMEN STARTED TO DRILL BEFORE THEY WERE ORDERED
TO DO SO.
(drill holes or take part in a life-boat drill?), than in:
THE SEAMEN STARTED TO MARCH BEFORE THEY WERE ORDERED
TO DO SO.
Furthermore, even irrelevant meanings are apparently considered.
In one now famous experiment (Swinney 1979), passages containing
homonyms (words with more than one meaning) were read out to
subjects. For example:
THE MAN FOUND SEVERAL SPIDERS, ROACHES AND OTHER BUGS
IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.

Here BUGS clearly referred to insects, though in another context,
BUGS could be electronic listening devices. Just after the ambiguous
word, the experimenter ﬂashed a sequence of letters up on to a screen,
and asked if they formed a word or not (a so-called ‘lexical decision
task’). He found that subjects responded fastest to words which were
related to either meaning of the ambiguous word. They said ‘Yes’ faster
to ANT and SPY than they did to SEW. And this was not just due
to some accidental experimental effect, because other psycholinguists
came to the same conclusion (e.g. Tanenhaus et al. 1979; Seidenberg
et al. 1982; Kinoshita 1986).
More surprising still, perhaps, subjects reacted similarly even with a
homonym such as ROSE which involves two different parts of speech,
a noun (the ﬂower) and a verb (past tense of RISE). They were played
four sentences, which included the words:
THEY BOUGHT A ROSE.
THEY BOUGHT A SHIRT.
THEY ALL ROSE.
THEY ALL STOOD.
The subjects responded fastest to a lexical decision about the word
FLOWER following either type of ROSE, both the noun and the
verb (Seidenberg et al. 1982).
This may be a ‘veiled controlled process’, in that it is neither auto-
matic, nor consciously carried out. ‘Veiled controlled processes are
opaque to consciousness, faster than conscious controlled processes, and
they make fewer demands on limited processing resources’ (Tanenhaus
et al. 1985: 368).
Much more is going on than we consciously realize. Any human
is like a powerful computer in that the limited amount of information
appearing on his or her mental screen at any one time gives no indi-
cation of the multiple processes which have whizzed through in the
computer’s inner workings. And these human processes are happening
in parallel, rather than one after the other, and are more impressive
even than those found in the world’s most powerful computers.
Computers which can deal with the multiple computations routinely
carried out by humans are still a future dream.
But exactly how much parallel processing is going on in humans?
Verbs are a particular area of controversy. Do humans activate in
parallel all structures that can occur with them? Let us consider this
matter.

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

Versatile verbs
‘They’ve a temper some of them – particularly verbs, they’re the
proudest – adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs.’ This
comment by Humpty Dumpty to Alice in Lewis Carroll’s Through the
Looking Glass reﬂects a feeling shared by many psycholinguists that
verbs are more complicated than other parts of speech. They may
provide the ‘key’ to the sentence by imposing a structure on it.
The effect of verbs has been a major issue for around half a century.
Fodor et al. (1968) suggested that when someone hears a sentence,
they pay particular attention to the verb. The moment they hear it,
they look up the entry for this verb in a mental dictionary. The
dictionary will contain a list of the possible constructions associated
with that verb. For example:
KICK
+
NP
HE KICKED THE BALL
EXPECT
+
NP
HE EXPECTED A LETTER
+
TO
HE EXPECTED TO ARRIVE AT SIX O’CLOCK
+
THAT
HE EXPECTED THAT HE WOULD BE LATE.
If these psychologists are correct in their claim, then sentences
containing verbs which give no choice of construction should be
easier to process than those which contain ‘versatile verbs’ – verbs
associated with multiple constructions. In the case of a verb such as
KICK, the hearer only has a simple lexical entry to check. But in the
case of a verb such as EXPECT, they mentally activate each of the
possible constructions before picking on the correct one. This suggestion
was known as the ‘verbal complexity hypothesis’.
Several psycholinguists tried to test this theory, including Fodor,
Garrett and Bever themselves. In one experiment, they gave under-
graduates pairs of sentences which were identical except for the verb.
A single-construction verb was placed in one sentence (e.g. MAIL),
and a multiple-construction verb in the other (e.g. EXPECT):
THE LETTER WHICH THE SECRETARY MAILED WAS LATE.
THE LETTER WHICH THE SECRETARY EXPECTED WAS LATE.
They jumbled up the words in each, and then asked the students to
unscramble them. They found what they had hoped to ﬁnd – that it
was much easier to sort out the single-construction verb sentences.
But this experiment has been criticized. The problem is that it did

not test comprehension directly: it assessed the difﬁculty of a task
which occurred after the sentence had been originally processed.
Later researchers checked on the difﬁculty of versatile verbs via a
lexical decision task – asking subjects to decide whether a sequence
of letters such as DOG or GLIT ﬂashed up on a screen is a word or
not. Supposedly, reaction times to this task will be slower if the letter
sequence is presented just after subjects have heard a versatile verb.
One group of researchers who tried this did not ﬁnd the predicted
effect (Clifton et al. 1984). They concluded that hearers had no extra
difficulty provided that the verb was followed by its preferred
construction. For example, I THINK THAT . . . (e.g. I THINK
THAT MAVIS IS A FOOL) would cause less trouble than I THINK
AS . . . (e.g. I THINK AS I WALK TO WORK). In other words,
hearers may activate in advance one favoured construction for a given
verb, but there is no need for them to activate mentally all possible
constructions associated with it. If only one favoured construction is
activated per verb, then ‘versatile verbs’ are no more difﬁcult to deal
with than non-versatile ones, except when an odd or unexpected
option is chosen.
This conclusion is supported by the work of some other researchers
(e.g. Ford et al. 1982). Consider the sentence:
THE PERSON WHO COOKS DUCKS OUT OF WASHING THE DISHES.
At ﬁrst, we expect the word DUCKS to be the object of the word
COOKS. But since we need a main verb, we are forced to revise our
interpretation to:
THE PERSON [WHO COOKS] DUCKS OUT OF WASHING THE
DISHES.
Our knowledge of the verb COOKS led us astray, since it is often,
though not necessarily, followed by the thing which is cooked.
However, another group of researchers did ﬁnd that a versatile verb
caused problems, though in a somewhat unexpected way. The number
of different constructions following a verb did not matter particularly.
Instead, difﬁculties arose with verbs where it was not immediately
obvious who did what to whom (Shapiro et al. 1987). Consider the
sentence:
SHELDON SENT DEBBIE THE LETTER.

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

This type of sentence took up extra processing time because people
were not at ﬁrst sure whether Debbie or something else was being
sent.
On balance, versatile verbs do not cause the problems they were
once expected to cause. Listeners may be mentally prepared for a
variety of constructions, but this does not seem to delay processing,
unless there is some additional difﬁculty, such as an unusual construction,
or problems in deciding who did what to whom. Perhaps a hearer is
like a car-driver, driving behind a bus. She has certain expectations
about what the bus in front is likely to do. It can go straight on, turn
left or turn right, and she is ready to respond appropriately to any of
these. But she might be taken by surprise if the bus reversed. Similarly,
perhaps versatile verbs are a problem only if they spring a surprise on
the hearer.
Informed guesses
A key question which puzzled researchers for a number of years is
whether listeners take a ‘top-down’ or ‘bottom-up’ approach when
they process sentences. That is, do they impose their expectations on
what they are hearing, and get puzzled if these expectations are not
fulﬁlled? This is a top-down approach. On the other hand, do they
listen to the words said to them, and then try to assemble them in
some type of order? This is a bottom-up approach. As we learn more
about the way human speech comprehension works, it now seems
that both viewpoints combine together. But some of the earlier work
on the subject explored a top-down approach, and this can still explain
a lot about how humans understand chunks of words.
When someone hears a sentence, she often latches on to outline
clues, and ‘jumps to conclusions’ about what she is hearing. An analogy
might make this clearer. Suppose someone found a large foot sticking
out from under her bed one night. She would be likely to shriek
‘There’s a man under my bed’, because past experience has led her
to believe that large feet are usually attached to male human beings.
Instead of just reporting the actual situation ‘There is a foot sticking
out from under the bed’, she has jumped to the conclusion that this
foot belongs to a man, and this man is lying under the bed.
The evidence suggests that we make similar ‘informed guesses’
about the material we hear. One of the ﬁrst people to work on listeners’
expectations was Tom Bever, a psychologist at Columbia University,
New York. The next few pages are based to a large extent on sugges-
tions made by him.

Hearers approach the sentences of English with at least four basic
assumptions, according to a key paper by Bever, published over a
quarter of a century ago (1970). Guided by their expectations, they
devise rules of thumb or ‘strategies’ for dealing with what they hear.
Let us brieﬂy consider these assumptions and linked strategies. Although
we shall be labelling them ‘ﬁrst’, ‘second’, ‘third’ and ‘fourth’, this is
not meant to refer to the order in which they are used, since all four
may be working simultaneously.
Assumption 1 ‘Every sentence consists of one or more sentoids or
sentence-like chunks, and each sentoid normally includes a noun-
phrase followed by a verb, optionally followed by another noun-
phrase.’ That is, every sentence will either be a simple one such as:
DO YOU LIKE CURRY?
TADPOLES TURN INTO FROGS.
DON’T TOUCH THAT WIRE.
or it will be a ‘complex’ one containing more than one sentence-like
structure or sentoid. For example, the sentence:
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE FACT THAT PETER SINGS IN HIS
BATH UPSETS THE LANDLADY.
contains three sentoids:
IT IS NOT SURPRISING
THAT THE FACT UPSETS THE LANDLADY
THAT PETER SINGS IN HIS BATH.
Within a sentence, each sentoid normally contains either a noun
phrase–verb sequence such as:
THE LARGE GORILLA GROWLED.
or a noun phrase–verb–noun phrase sequence such as:
COWS CHEW THE CUD.
The strategy or working principle which follows from assumption
1 seems to be: ‘Divide each sentence up into sentoids by looking for
noun phrase–verb (–noun phrase) sequences.’ This is sometimes referred
to as the canonical sentoid strategy, since noun phrase–verb–noun phrase

is the ‘canonical’ or standard form of an English sentence. It is clear
that we need such a strategy when we distinguish sentoids, since there
are often no acoustic clues to help us divide a sentence up (Chapter 1).
A clear conﬁrmation of this strategy comes when people are presented
with a sentence such as:
LLOYD KICKED THE BALL KICKED IT.
which was said in a football commentary. Most people deny that it
is possible, claiming it must be:
LLOYD KICKED THE BALL THEN KICKED IT AGAIN.
But it is a well-formed English sentence, as shown by the similar
one:
LLOYD THROWN THE BALL KICKED IT.
People just cannot think of the interpretation ‘to whom the ball was
kicked’, the canonical sentoid strategy is too strong. And similar
examples abound in the literature, perhaps the most famous being:
THE HORSE RACED PAST THE BARN FELL.
A common comment about this one is: ‘I can’t understand it because
I don’t know the word BARNFELL.’ The alternative interpretation
of RACED as ‘which was raced’ is rarely considered.
Further conﬁrmation of this strategy comes from so-called ‘centre
embeddings’ – sentences which have a Chinese box-like structure,
one lying inside the other. The following is a double centre embedding
– one sentence is inside another which is inside yet another.
(The man laughed: the girl believed the man; the boy met the girl.)

Blumenthal (1966) tested to see what happened when sentences of
this type were memorized. He noted that subjects tended to recall
them as noun–verb sequences:
THE MAN, THE GIRL AND THE BOY MET, BELIEVED AND LAUGHED.
Their immediate reaction to being presented with such an unusual
sentence was to utilize the canonical sentoid strategy even though it
was, strictly speaking, irrelevant. In a later experiment, Bever found
to his surprise that subjects imposed an NP–V–NP sequence on
sentences of this type even after practice. He comments, ‘the NVN
sequence is so compelling that it may be described as a “linguistic
illusion” which training cannot readily overcome’ (Bever 1970: 295).
The canonical sentoid strategy seems to start young. Bever noted
that by around the age of 2, children are already looking out for
noun–verb sequences – though they tend to assume that the ﬁrst noun
goes with the ﬁrst verb, and interpret:
THE DOG THAT JUMPED FELL.
as:
THE DOG JUMPED.
Assumption 2 ‘In a noun phrase–verb–noun phrase sequence, the
ﬁrst noun is usually the actor and the second the object.’ That is, an
English sentence normally has the word order actor–action–object with
the person doing the action coming ﬁrst as in:
GIRAFFES EAT LEAVES.
DIOGENES BOUGHT A BARREL.
The strategy which stems from assumption 2, seems to be as follows:
‘Interpret an NP–V–NP sequence as actor – action – object unless
you have strong indications to the contrary.’

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

A number of experiments have shown that sentences which do not
have the actor ﬁrst take longer to comprehend if there are no semantic
clues. The best known of these may be Slobin’s ‘picture veriﬁcation’
experiment (1966b). He showed subjects pictures, and also read them
out a sentence. Then he timed how long it took them to say whether
the two matched. He found that passives such as:
THE CAT WAS CHASED BY THE DOG.
took longer to verify than the corresponding active:
THE DOG CHASED THE CAT.
Another picture veriﬁcation experiment showed that actor–action–
object structures are comprehended more quickly than other structures
which would ﬁt the NP–V–NP sequence (Mehler and Carey 1968):
THEY
ARE KIDNAPPING
BABIES
actor
action
object
was veriﬁed more quickly than:
THEY
ARE
NOURISHING LUNCHES
subject
copula
complement
Assumption 3 ‘When a complex sentence is composed of a main
clause and one or more subordinate clauses, the main clause usually
comes ﬁrst.’ That is, it is more usual to ﬁnd a sentence such as:
NERO FIDDLED [WHILE ROME BURNED].
than:
[WHILE ROME BURNED] NERO FIDDLED.
Similarly:
PETRONELLA EXPECTED [THAT PERICLES WOULD SCRUB THE
FLOOR].

is considerably more likely than:
*[THAT PERICLES WOULD SCRUB THE FLOOR] PETRONELLA
EXPECTED.
The strategy which follows from assumption 3 seems to be ‘Interpret
the ﬁrst clause as the main clause unless you have clear indications to
the contrary.’ The existence of this strategy accounts for the correct
interpretation of:
IT WAS OBVIOUS HE WAS DRUNK FROM THE WAY HE STAGGERED
ACROSS THE ROAD.
Here, the subordinate clause is not marked in any way, but the hearer
automatically assumes that it comes after the main clause. This strategy
also partly accounts for the difﬁculty of:
THE ELEPHANT SQUEEZED INTO A TELEPHONE BOOTH COLLAPSED.
Until coming across the unexpected word COLLAPSED at the end
of the sentence the hearer probably assumes that THE ELEPHANT
SQUEEZED . . . was the beginning of the main clause.
Assumption 4 ‘Sentences usually make sense.’ That is, people generally
say things that are sensible. They utter sequences such as:
HAVE YOU DONE THE WASHING UP?
THE TRAIN GOES AT EIGHT O’CLOCK.
rather than:
HAPPINESS SHOOTS LLAMAS.
THE HONEY SPREAD MOTHER WITH A KNIFE.
The strategy attached to this assumption is the most powerful of all
– though from the linguistic point of view, it is the least satisfactory
because it is so vague. It says: ‘Use your knowledge of the world to
pick the most likely interpretation of the sentence you are hearing.’
In certain circumstances this can override all other strategies, and
reverse well-attested aspects of language behaviour. For example, under
normal circumstances people ﬁnd it much easier to remember sentences
that are superﬁcially grammatical than random strings of words. It is
considerably easier to learn the apparently grammatical:

THE YIGS WUR VUMLY RIXING HUM IN JEGEST MIV.
than the shorter string:
THE YIG WUR VUM RIX HUM IN JEG MIV. (Epstein 1961)
But this well-attested result can be reversed if the subjects are presented
with semantically strange grammatical sentences and ungrammatical
strings of words which appear to make sense. Subjects remember more
words from strings such as:
NEIGHBOURS SLEEPING NOISY WAKE PARTIES
DETER DRIVERS ACCIDENTS FATAL CARELESS
than they do from sentences such as:
RAPID BOUQUETS DETER SUDDEN NEIGHBOURS.
PINK ACCIDENTS CAUSE SLEEPING STORMS. (Marks and Miller 1964)
So far, then, we have listed a number of assumptions which hearers
have about English, and suggested a number of linked ‘perceptual
strategies’:
1
Divide each sentence up into sentoids by looking for NP–V
(–NP) sequences (‘canonical sentoid strategy’).
2
Interpret an NP–V–NP sequence as actor–action–object.
3
Interpret the ﬁrst clause as the main clause.
4
Use your knowledge of the world to pick the most likely
interpretation.
Even quite odd sentences seem easy to understand if they ﬁt in
with the ‘strategies’ listed above:
THE KANGAROO SQUEEZED THE ORANGE AND THE KOOKABURRA
ATE THE PIPS.
But sentences which do not fulﬁl the hearer’s expectations are more
difﬁcult to comprehend. Each of the following goes against one of
the four basic strategies. The sentences can be understood reasonably
easily, but they need marginally more attention from the hearer:

AFTER RUSHING ACROSS THE FIELD THE BULL TOSSED HARRY.
THE VAN WAS HIT BY THE BUS, AND THE CAR WAS RAMMED BY A
TAXI.
THE POSTMAN BIT THE DOG, AND THE BABY SCRATCHED THE CAT.
When a sentence goes against more than one strategy the effect is
rather worse:
THE SHARK PUSHED THROUGH THE SEAWEED WAS ATTACKED BY
A TADPOLE.
The sentence is neither ungrammatical, nor incomprehensible. It just
seems clumsy and strange, and would possibly cause a hearer to say:
‘I’m sorry, I didn’t get that. Could you repeat it?’
It is an interesting fact that speakers tend to avoid sentences which
go against perceptual strategies to too great an extent. People just do
not say things such as:
THE POODLE WALKED RAPIDLY UP THE MOUNTAIN COLLAPSED.
JOAN GAVE JUNE A PRESENT ON SATURDAY AND JANE ON SUNDAY.
Strictly speaking, these sentences are not ungrammatical, just odd and
unacceptable. Compare the syntactically similar sentences:
THE RAG DOLL WASHED IN THE WASHING MACHINE FELL TO PIECES.
MAX GAVE HIS DOG A BATH YESTERDAY AND HIS CAT LAST WEEK.
However, since the ‘sensible’ sentences above are interpretable only
because the speaker is able to use the imprecise strategy 4 (‘Use your
knowledge of the world to pick the most likely interpretation’), sen-
tences of this type may be in the process of being eliminated from the
English language – since perceptual needs can often inﬂuence linguistic
rules. To quote Bever: ‘The syntax of a language is partly moulded
by grammatical responses to behavioural constraints’ (1970: 321).
Obviously, the four strategies noted so far are not the only ones
we use when we comprehend sentences. Bever’s paper triggered a
search for others, particularly ones which might apply to a wider range
of languages than his ﬁrst three (e.g. Kimball 1973; Gruber et al. 1978).
Let us therefore outline two which might have a broader application,
and partially encapsulate the ‘canonical sentoid’ strategy (Frazier and
Rayner 1982, 1988).

The ﬁrst of these says: ‘Assume you are dealing with a simple
structure, unless you have evidence to the contrary.’ This has been
called the ‘Principle of Minimal Attachment’, because each word is
attached to the existing structure with the minimum amount of extra
elaboration. On hearing the word PARADED in a sentence such as:
THE LION PARADED THROUGH THE TOWN ESCAPED.
it is far simpler to set up a simple NP–VP structure, than one which
involves the added complexity of an extra sentence inserted after THE
LION.
The second says: ‘Try and associate any new item with the phrase
currently being processed.’ This has been called the ‘Principle of Late
Closure’, because the previous phrase is held open, waiting for new
additions, until there is strong evidence that it is complete. In a sentence
such as:
FIONA DISCOVERED ON MONDAY THE PENGUIN HAD HURT ITS FOOT.
it is more natural to assume that ON MONDAY goes with the previous
verb DISCOVERED, even though it would be equally plausible from
the meaning point of view to assume that Monday was the day on
which the penguin injured itself.

Both these strategies would explain why:
THE MAN THE GIRL THE BOY MET BELIEVED LAUGHED
was so readily interpreted as ‘The man, the boy, and the girl, all met,
believed and laughed’ (p. 216). This interpretation involves a much
simpler structure than the ‘correct’ centre-embedded version, and
tacking each new person introduced onto the previous one ﬁts in
with Late Closure.
As we have seen, the notion of strategies works well. There is
plenty of proof that we impose our expectations on to what we hear,
so at ﬁrst sight there is no more to be said. All we need to do, it
might seem, is to continue adding to our list of strategies until we
have enough to cover the whole of language, and then try to divide
them up into strategies that relate only to a single language, such as
English; strategies that apply to a whole group of languages, such as
those which have the basic word order subject–verb–object; and third,
strategies that are universal.
However, when we consider the situation in detail, the notion of
strategies raises some problems. Above all, language is enormously
complex. Hardly any sentences are as straightforward as:
MARY LIKES STRAWBERRIES.
or even:
SEBASTIAN DISCOVERED THAT THE GORILLA HAD ESCAPED.
Many of them are considerably more complicated. For example,
anyone who listens to a serious discussion is likely to hear sequences
such as the following, in which a doctor is giving his opinion on a
controversial illness (ME ‘myalgic encephalomyelitis’):

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

I was very sceptical initially, I have to say, for a while it seemed
to be y’know this decade’s thing, and went along the same sort
of lines as Total Allergy Syndrome, and things like that, which
ultimately became pretty well discredited as diagnoses and so I
think initially, I think it was seen as this year’s trendy illness to
have.
(Wetherell et al. 2001: 156)
How many strategies are involved in a sentence like this? Obviously,
many more than the few we have discussed. Perhaps twenty? Or a
hundred? And supposing there are a hundred, what order do people
apply them in? When faced with the problem of organizing dozens
of strategies into a coherent model of comprehension some psycholin-
guists have argued ﬁrst, that the task is impossible. Second, that the
whole notion of strategy is meaningless in relation to these longer
sentences. Strategies become vague devices of immense power which
provide very little concrete information about sentence processing. As
one psycholinguist commented: ‘One wonders what couldn’t be
accomplished with an armful of strategies’ (Gough 1971: 269).
The notion of strategies therefore solves some problems, but raises
others. Strategies cannot be totally replaced, but they need to be held
in check and supplemented by more precise procedures. Let us go on
to consider how researchers have tried to instill more orderliness into
models of comprehension.
Word-by-word
As a reaction against the chaos of strategies, a number of researchers
turned towards the neatness and orderly behaviour of computers.
Perhaps they could program a computer so that it would be an
‘automatic parser’, that is, a machine which could unaided identify
the syntactic role of each word, and show how they all ﬁt together.
Such machines move from one end of the sentence to the other,
dealing with each group of words in turn, checking them against an
internal grammar which contains information about the structure of
English sentences. This is sometimes called a ‘left-to-right’ model, or
in more fashionable terminology, an ‘incremental parser’, since the
parser moves onwards by adding extra information word by word, in
so far as this is possible.
Of course, when faced with a simple sentence such as:
PETRONELLA SAW A GHOST.

there is hardly any difference between a model which says ‘Assume
you are dealing with an NP–V–NP structure’ (strategy model), and
one which says ‘Work your way through the sentence word-by-word
looking ﬁrst for a noun phrase, then for a verb, then another noun
phrase’ (left-to-right model). But the difference becomes apparent
when we look at how to deal with questions.
Suppose we have a sentence which begins with the words:
WHICH ELEPHANT . . . ?
This sentence could end in a number of different ways. We could
say:
WHICH ELEPHANT CAN DANCE THE POLKA?
WHICH ELEPHANT SHALL I BUY?
WHICH ELEPHANT SHALL I GIVE BUNS TO?
In the ﬁrst sentence, the elephant is the subject of the verb, the one
who is dancing the polka; in the second, the elephant is the object,
the thing being bought; in the third, it is the indirect object, the
animal to whom something is being given.
A dedicated strategy model would suggest that hearers start guessing
immediately about the role of the word elephant, based on their
expectations of the role elephants usually play in sentences. A left-to-
right model, on the other hand, suggests that if hearers encounter a
group of words which does not immediately ﬁt into the straightforward
NP–V–NP pattern, they do not make any rash guesses, they wait and
see. They mentally store the words WHICH ELEPHANT in their
memory until they have heard enough of the rest of the sentence to
enable them to interpret it reliably. For example, in the case of WHICH
ELEPHANT SHALL I BUY? they would wait until after the word
BUY, since they know that the verb BUY usually has an object, the
thing which is bought. They then mentally insert the stored phrase
WHICH ELEPHANT into the gap where the object is usually found:
Similarly, in the sentence WHICH ELEPHANT SHALL I GIVE
THESE BUNS TO? the hearers would store the words WHICH

ELEPHANT until after the word TO. They would know that the
word TO must normally be accompanied by a noun, so they would
insert the stored phrase into the gap after TO:
But this type of decision making may be unnecessary. Early work
on comprehension suggested that psycholinguists needed to make
decisions about whether strategies or gap-ﬁlling models were preferable.
Later work has led to the realization that the human language processor
is likely to be more powerful, and more commonsensical than was
once assumed (e.g. Townsend and Bever 2001). And far more may
be happening simultaneously than we previously realized. As a hearer
works through a sentence, he or she may encounter temporary
ambiguity quite often, but is often able to make a provisional decision,
while still keeping other possibilities in mind. One interpretation is
‘foregrounded’, though others are kept in the background, ready to
be moved forward if necessary. Hearers probably avoid making a
deﬁnitive decision, if they are at all uncertain: having to go back and
make a totally new analysis would be time-consuming and inefﬁcient.
A solution which involves two layers of processing has also been
proposed (Frazier and Clifton 1996). Primary parsing principles could
ﬁrst cut up any sentence into broad chunks. The ‘canonical sentoid’
strategy is possibly one of these, so are the more recently proposed
principles which overlap with it, the Principles of Minimal Attachment
and Late Closure (p. 221-2). These primary decisions may be followed
by a second set of decisions, which look at smaller chunks and take
individual lexical items into account.
Let us now assess the comprehension process. Left-to-right models
may be right in assuming that speakers work through sentences in a
principled way. But such models also present problems. A critical
weakness is that they cannot cope with ill-formed, but comprehensible
sentences, such as:
I HAVE MUCH PROBLEM IN MAKING TO WORK YOUR TELEPHONE.
They therefore need to be integrated with strategy models which can
make guesses about imperfect utterances. A further possibility is that
humans make a provisional decision, but keep likely alternatives in

their mind, so that they can switch over to these if necessary. This
compromise solution may be the correct one. The human mind is
capable of much more simultaneous computation than was once
assumed.
Further difﬁculties
So far, the factors we have discussed which affect comprehension have
been mainly linguistic ones. But understanding speech may use abilities
which relate to other aspects of human behaviour. In the next few
pages we will discuss some aspects of sentence processing which involve
other speciﬁc linguistic abilities, though we must bear in mind that
it is not always easy to separate linguistic factors out from general
cognitive ones, and researchers frequently disagree about which is
which. Broadly speaking, a hearer is likely to ﬁnd a sentence hard to
comprehend if it goes beyond certain ‘psychological’ limits.
Let us begin by considering the amount of material which can be
processed at any one time. Clearly, there is a limit on this. We know
from numerous other areas of human behaviour that there is only a
certain amount that human beings can cope with simultaneously,
whether they are trying to remember things or are solving a problem.
So a sentence that is long or involved will be difﬁcult. Take length.
It is often hard on a journey to follow the route directions of a passer-
by. People tend to say things like: ‘Take the third turning on the left
past the fourth pub just before the supermarket next door to the
church.’ Apart from anything else, this sentence is just too long to be
retained in the memory. Before the speaker gets to the end, the hearer
is likely to have forgotten the ﬁrst part.
However, length alone is not particularly important. What matters
is the interaction of length with structure. Early research suggested
that listeners prefer to deal with the speech they hear sentoid by
sentoid. As soon as one sentoid has been decoded, hearers possibly
forget the syntax, and remove the gist of what has been said to another
memory space (Fodor et al. 1974: 339). The hearer ‘wipes the slate
clean’, and starts afresh.
Subsequent research suggested that this view is somewhat over-
simpliﬁed (e.g Flores d’Arcais 1988). Sentoids are cleared away only
if their contents appear to be no longer needed. Speakers are able to
retain sentoids in their memory to a greater or lesser extent, if they
sense that this will help future processing.
But the overall conclusion is clear. Humans have limited immediate
memory space and processing ability. Therefore they clear away sections

of speech as soon as they have dealt with them, preferably sentoid by
sentoid. This would explain not only why unusually long sentoids are
difﬁcult (as in the direction-ﬁnding example given earlier), but also,
perhaps, why sentences which cannot easily be divided into sentoids
are a problem. For example:
THIS IS THE BUS THAT THE CAR THAT THE PROFESSOR THAT THE
GIRL KISSED DROVE HIT.
is more difﬁcult than:
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT KISSED THE PROFESSOR THAT DROVE THE
CAR THAT HIT THE BUS.
even though the second sentence has exactly the same number of
words and almost the same meaning. Part of the trouble with the ﬁrst
is that you have to carry almost all of it unanalysed in your head. You
have to wait until the end of the verb HIT that goes with CAR
before you can divide it into sentoids:
However, in dealing with sentences which cannot easily be divided
into sentoids like the one above, it is not only the memory load, but
also the difﬁculty of processing three sentoids simultaneously which
cause problems. Three are not impossible (as some people have sug-
gested, e.g. Kimball 1973) because we can, after some thought, compose
sentences such as:
THE NEWBORN CROCODILE [WHICH THE KEEPER [YOU WERE
TALKING TO THIS AFTERNOON] LOOKS AFTER] IS BEING MOVED TO
ANOTHER ZOO.

But in general it is unusual to ﬁnd more than two sentoids being
coped with easily, and two are more difﬁcult than one. It is a fact
about human nature that a person can deal only with a limited number
of things at one time.
This leads us on to another difﬁculty, which overlaps with the
simultaneous processing problem – that of interruptions. An interrupted
structure is only slightly more difﬁcult to process than an uninterrupted
one, providing there are clear indications that you are dealing with
an interruption. For example, the following sentence has a seventeen-
word interruption:
THE GIRL [WHOM CUTHBERT KISSED SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY AT
THE PARTY LAST NIGHT WHEN HE THOUGHT NO ONE WAS
LOOKING] IS MY SISTER.
It is not particularly difﬁcult to understand because the hearer knows
(from the opening sequence THE GIRL WHOM . . . ) that he is still
waiting for the main verb. However, if there are no indications that
an interruption is in progress, the sentence immediately increases in
difﬁculty and oddness:
CUTHBERT PHONED THE GIRL [WHOM HE KISSED SO
ENTHUSIASTICALLY AT THE PARTY LAST NIGHT WHEN HE
THOUGHT NO ONE WAS LOOKING] UP.
Here UP goes with PHONED, but the hearer has already ‘closed off’
that branch on his mental tree. He has not left it ‘open’ and ready
for additional material:

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

A fourth general difﬁculty concerns compression of information.
Humans need thinking space to let information ‘sink in’, and they
comprehend best if they are presented only with a small amount of
new information at one time. This is why Longfellow’s poem The
Song of Hiawatha is so easy to follow. Each line repeats some information
from the previous one, so there is only a small amount of new material
in each one:
By the shores of Gitche Gumee,
By the shining Big-Sea-Water,
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis,
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.
Dark behind it rose the forest,
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees,
Rose the ﬁrs with cones upon them;
Bright before it beat the water,
Beat the clear and sunny water,
Beat the shining Big-Sea-Water.
This slow dropping of information contrasts strikingly with the over-
compressed:
THIS IS THE BUS THAT THE CAR THAT THE PROFESSOR THAT THE
GIRL KISSED DROVE HIT.
A further difﬁculty involves the repetition of items and structures.
It is difﬁcult to process a sentence which contains the same word
twice, or more than one instance of the same type of structure, especially
if the similar constructions are one inside the other. Take the sentence:
THIS IS THE BUS [THAT THE VAN [THAT THE CAR HIT] HIT].
This sentence with the repeated word HIT is more difﬁcult than:
THIS IS THE BUS [THAT THE VAN [THAT THE CAR HIT] COLLIDED
WITH].
And the sentence above, which has a so-called relative clause inside
another relative clause, is more difﬁcult than a relative clause inside a
different type of clause:
I EXPECT [THAT THE BUS [WHICH HIT THE VAN] IS DAMAGED].

In fact, it is so difﬁcult to process one type of clause inside another
similar one, that at least one linguist has suggested excluding such sen-
tences from a grammar altogether. But this is not a workable suggestion,
because it would also exclude perfectly good sentences such as:
THE OCTOPUS [WHICH THE FISHERMAN [YOU WERE TALKING TO]
HAD CAUGHT] LOOKED QUITE REVOLTING.
This is a relative clause inside another relative clause.
Another difﬁculty, which seems to be partly a general psychological
one, and partly a linguistic one, is the difﬁculty of backward processing
(Grosu 1974). In English we normally move forwards when we process
sentences. For example, it is easy to comprehend:
MARY, PETER AND PRISCILLA PLAY THE FLUTE, THE PIANO AND
THE GUITAR RESPECTIVELY.
In this, the order of the people and the instruments they play moves
from left to right:
1
2
3
1
2
3
MARY
PETER
PRISCILLA
–
FLUTE
PIANO
GUITAR.
It is considerably more difﬁcult to understand:
MARY, PETER AND PRISCILLA PLAY THE GUITAR, THE PIANO AND
THE FLUTE REVERSELY.
Here, the instruments are given backwards, and you have to reverse
the order in which they occur before you can sort out who is playing
what:
1
2
3

MARY

–

The same kind of reversal occurs in the sentence:

The case of the missing ﬁngerprint

Backward processing (and compression) may also be why it is difﬁcult
to understand:
MY AUNT’S EMPLOYER’S SON’S UMBRELLA’S COLOUR IS YELLOW.
compared with the left-to-right uncompressed sentence:
THE COLOUR OF THE UMBRELLA OF THE SON OF THE EMPLOYER
OF MY AUNT IS YELLOW.
though alternative explanations are possible (Yngve 1961/1972; Miller
and Chomsky 1963; Frazier and Rayner 1988).
Another partly linguistic, partly psychological factor which increases
comprehension difﬁculty is the omission of surface ‘markers’. These
are items which help to identify the various constructions. The fewer
clues available for recognizing a structure, the more difﬁcult it will be
to identify. This is true whether we are dealing with a sentence in a
language, or a partly hidden object in front of our eyes. Just as a picture
of a face which lacks a nose may take longer to recognize than one
with eyes, nose and mouth all complete, so a sentence with a word
seemingly missing will take longer to comprehend (Fodor et al. 1968;
Hakes 1971; Fodor et al. 1974). For example:
THE CROW THE FOX FLATTERED LOST ITS CHEESE.
is more difﬁcult than:
THE CROW WHICH THE FOX FLATTERED LOST ITS CHEESE.
In the second sentence WHICH is retained, enabling speakers to note
more quickly that they are dealing with a relative clause. Similarly:
SEBASTIAN NOTICED THE BURGLAR HAD LEFT FOOTPRINTS.
takes longer to comprehend than:
SEBASTIAN NOTICED THAT THE BURGLAR HAD LEFT FOOTPRINTS.
Here, the word THAT gives an immediate indication to the hearer
that he is dealing with a so-called ‘complement structure’.
Yet another factor which straddles the gap between psychological
and linguistic difﬁculties is the presence of a negative. In general,

negative sentences take longer to comprehend than afﬁrmative ones.
However, within negative sentences there are some strange discrepan-
cies which relate to the hearer’s expectations about his world. For
example, it is easier and quicker to negate an expected fact than an
unexpected one: it takes less time to comprehend the sentence:
THE TRAIN WAS NOT LATE THIS MORNING
if you had expected the train to be late. If the train was normally on
time, the same sentence would take longer to process. Similarly:
A WHALE IS NOT A FISH and A SPIDER IS NOT AN INSECT.
are simpler, and take less time to understand, than:
A WHALE IS NOT A BIRD and A SPIDER IS NOT A MAMMAL.
because hearers had expected the whale to be a ﬁsh and the spider an
insect (Wason 1965).
Let us now summarize this section. We have listed a number of
general factors which can make a sentence more difﬁcult to understand.
We noted that short-term memory space is limited, that there seems
to be a constraint on the number of sentoids that can be processed
simultaneously, that unmarked interruptions are difﬁcult to deal with,
and so is a sentence which contains too much compressed information.
We saw that repetition of items and structures causes problems, and
so does backward processing. The deletion of surface clues slows down
syntax recognition, and negatives delay sentence processing.
The story so far
A great deal of work still needs to be done before we fully understand
what is happening when we comprehend speech. But, as we have
seen, there are a number of ways in which we can usefully approach
the problem. First, we can explore the lexicon, looking in particular
at how words are identiﬁed, at the treatment of ambiguous words,
and at the role of verbs. Second, we can build up a list of basic assump-
tions that hearers make about their language, and note the strategies
which they utilize when they understand sentences. Third, we can
explore both the step-by-step stages and the multiple actions which
are taking place as a human tries to interpret what they hear. Fourth,
we can assess the general psychological difﬁculties which affect speech

processing. A ﬁnal step, still in the future, is to integrate all these
various strands into a coherent model of speech comprehension.
A further issue is how general background information is combined
with the linguistic facets of a sentence. The tricky and voluminous
question of how humans represent the world they live in has not been
examined in this book.
Resolving these problems might seem impossible, considering the
conﬂicting views of psycholinguists. But certain facts are becoming
clear. Above all, the human mind is an amazingly powerful machine,
capable of multiple parallel processing. The major question for the
future is how it manages to amalgamate everything together into a
manageable whole, instead of getting lost in the umpteen possibilities
which are inherent in the data.
Let us now turn to the topic of speech production. As we shall
see, this presents us with even more problems than comprehension.

11 The Cheshire Cat’s grin
How do we plan and produce
speech?
‘I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly,’ said
Alice. ‘You make one quite giddy.’ 
‘All right,’ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone. 
‘Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,’ thought Alice; ‘but a
grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in all my
life!’ 
Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland 
It is tantalizingly difﬁcult to observe how anyone actually plans and
produces speech. When somebody utters a sentence, we have very
little idea how long it actually took to plan it, and what processes
were involved. It is equally hard to devise experiments to test what
is going on. There are relatively few reported in psycholinguistic
journals, compared with the thousands available on speech comprehen-
sion. Consequently, we shall be very tentative over any conclusions
we draw. As Fodor et al. commented over a quarter-century ago:
‘Practically anything that one can say about speech production must
be considered speculative, even by the standards current in psycho-
linguistics’ (1974: 434). Almost the same is true in the twenty-ﬁrst
century: ‘There has been less research on language production than
on language comprehension . . . The investigation of production is
perceived to be more difﬁcult than the investigation of comprehension’
(Harley 2001: 349).
Clues to what is happening are infuriatingly elusive. In fact, there
seems to be only one situation in which we can actually catch a
speaker as he mentally prepares an utterance, and that is when someone
is trying to recall a forgotten name. The name is often on ‘the tip of
their tongue’, but they cannot quite remember it. Their mind is not

completely blank as far as the word is concerned. A teasing and
seemingly uncatchable wraith of it remains. He is left with a ‘kind 
of disembodied presence, a grin without the Cheshire Cat’ (Brown
1970: 234). This ‘tip of the tongue’ phenomenon will be discussed
on pp. 248–9.
‘Repairs’ – situations when speakers correct themselves – are
sometimes proposed as an extra source of information, as in:
FERDINAND CRASHED THE CAR ON MONDAY, SORRY, ON TUESDAY.
But in repairs there is a relatively long time-lag between making a
mistake and correcting it (Blackmer and Mitton 1991). Mostly, speakers
behave as if they are listening to another speaker: ‘Controlling one’s
own speech is like attending to somebody else’s talk’ (Levelt 1983:
96–7). So repairs do not shed as much light as we might hope on the
original planning process.
We therefore have to rely on indirect evidence. This is of two main
types. First of all, we can look at the pauses in spontaneous speech.
The object of this is to try to detect pause patterns – gaps in utterances
– which may give clues about when speech is planned. Second, we
can examine speech errors, both the slips of the tongue found in the
conversation of normal people (e.g. HAP-SLAPPY for ‘slap-happy’,
CANTANKEROUS for ‘contentious’), as well as the more severe
disturbances of aphasics – people whose speech is impaired due to
some type of brain damage (e.g. TARIB for ‘rabbit’, RABBIT for
‘apple’). Breakdown of the normal patterns may give us vital information
about the way we plan and produce what we say, especially as:
‘Natural speech is full of mismatches between intention and output.’
(Harley 2006).
Pauses
It may seem rather paradoxical to investigate speech by studying non-
speech. But the idea is not as irrelevant as it appears at ﬁrst sight.
Around 40 to 50 per cent of an average spontaneous utterance consists
of silence, although to hearers the proportion does not seem as high
because they are too busy listening to what is being said.
The pauses in speech are of two main types: breathing pauses and
hesitation pauses, sometimes with er . . . um vocalizations, known as
ﬁlled pauses. The ﬁrst type are relatively easy to cope with. There are
relatively few of them, partly because we slow down our rate of
breathing when we speak, and they account for only about 5 per cent

of the gaps in speech. They tend to come at grammatical boundaries,
although they do not necessarily do so (Henderson et al. 1965).
Hesitation pauses are more promising. There are more of them and
they do not have any obvious physical purpose comparable to that of
ﬁlling one’s lungs with air. Normally they account for one-third to
one-half of the time taken up in talking. Speech in which such pausing
does not occur is sometimes referred to as ‘inferior’ speech (Jackson
1932). Either it has been rehearsed beforehand, or the speaker is
merely stringing together a number of standard phrases she habitually
repeats, as when the mother of the 7-year-old who threw a stone
through my window rattled off at top speed, ‘I do apologize, he’s
never done anything like that before, I can’t think what came over
him, he’s such a good quiet little boy usually, I’m quite ﬂabbergasted.’
Unfortunately, we tend to over-value ﬂuent, glib speakers who may
not be thinking what they are saying, and often condemn a hesitant
or stammering speaker who may be thinking very hard.
Hesitation pauses are rather difﬁcult to measure, because a long-
drawn-out word such as WE . . . ELL, IN FA . . . ACT may be
substituted for a pause. This type of measurement problem may account
for the huge differences of view found among psycholinguists who
have done research on this topic. The basic argument is about where
exactly the pauses occur. One researcher claims that hesitations occur
mainly after the ﬁrst word in the clause or sentoid (Boomer 1965).
But other psycholinguists, whose experiments seem equally convincing,
have found pauses mainly before important lexical items (Goldman-
Eisler 1964; Butterworth 1980). It seems impossible, from just reading
about their experiments, to judge who is right.
But in spite of this seemingly radical disagreement we can glean
one important piece of information. All researchers agree that speakers
do not normally pause between clauses, they pause inside them. This
means that there is overlapping in the planning and production of
clauses. That is, instead of a simple sequence:
Plan 
Utter 
Plan 
Utter 
clause A
clause A
clause B
clause B
we must set up a more complicated model:
Plan clause A
Plan clause B
Utter clause A
Utter clause B

In other words, it is quite clear that we do not cope with speech
one clause at a time. We begin to plan the next clause while still
uttering the present one.
Armed with this vital piece of information, we can now attempt
to elaborate the picture by looking at the evidence from speech errors.
Speech errors: the nature of the evidence
Linguists are interested in speech errors because they hope that language
in a broken-down state may be more revealing than language which
is working perfectly. It is possible that speech is like an ordinary
household electrical system, which is composed of several relatively
independent circuits. We cannot discover very much about these
circuits when all the lamps and sockets are working perfectly. But if
a mouse gnaws through a cable in the kitchen and fuses one circuit,
then we can immediately discover which lamps and sockets are linked
together under normal working conditions. In the same way, it might
be possible to ﬁnd selective impairment of different aspects of speech.
The errors we shall be dealing with are, ﬁrst, slips of the tongue
and, second, the speech of aphasics – people with some more serious
type of speech disturbance. Let us consider the nature of this evidence.
Everybody’s tongue slips now and again, most often when the
tongue’s owner is tired, a bit drunk or rather nervous. So errors of
this type are common enough to be called normal. However, if you
mention the topic of slips of the tongue to a group of people at least
one of them is likely to smirk knowingly and say ‘Ah yes, tongue
slips are sexual in origin, aren’t they?’ This fairly popular misconception
has arisen because Sigmund Freud, the great Viennese psychologist,
wrote a paper suggesting that words sometimes slipped out from a
person’s subconscious thoughts, which in his view were often concerned
with sex. For example, he quotes the case of a woman who said her
cottage was situated ON THE HILL-THIGH (BERGLENDE) instead
of ‘on the hillside’ (Berglehne), after she had been trying to recall a
childhood incident in which ‘part of her body had been grasped by
a prying and lascivious hand’ (Freud 1901). In fact, this type of example
occurs only in a relatively small number of tongue slips (Ellis 1980).
It is true, possibly, that a percentage of girls have the embarrassing
experience of sinking rapturously into, say, Archibald’s arms while
inadvertently murmuring ‘Darling Algernon’. It is also perhaps true
that anyone talking about a sex-linked subject may get embarrassed
and stumble over his words, like the anthropology professor, who,
red to the ears with confusion, talked about a PLENIS-BEEDING

CEREMONY (penis-bleeding ceremony) in Papua New Guinea. But
otherwise there seems little to support the sexual origin myth. Perhaps
one might add that people tend to notice and remember sexual 
slips more than any other type. During the anthropology lecture
mentioned above, almost everybody heard and memorized the
PLENIS-BEEDING example. But few people afterwards, when
questioned, had heard the lecturer say, YAM’S BOOK ON YOUNG-
GROWING (Young’s book on yam-growing). So laying aside the
sex myth, we may say that slips of the tongue tell us more about the
way a person plans and produces speech than about his or her sexual
fantasies.
Aphasia is rather different from slips of the tongue, in that it is far
from ‘normal’. The name aphasia comes from a Greek word which
means literally ‘without speech’, though is widely used in both the UK
and USA to mean ‘impaired speech’ (the more accurate term dysphasia
is now rarely found).
Aphasia covers an enormous range of speech problems. At one end
of the range we ﬁnd people who can only say a single word such as
O DEAR, O DEAR, O DEAR, or more usually, a swear word such
as DAMN, DAMN, DAMN. One unproved theory is that people
who have had a severe stroke sometimes ﬁnd their speech ‘petriﬁed’
into the word they were uttering as the stroke occurred. At the other
end of the scale are people with only occasional word-ﬁnding difﬁculties
– it is not always clear where true aphasia ends and normal slips of
the tongue begin. The fact that one merges into the other means that
we can examine both types of error together in our search for clues
about the planning and production of speech.
The typology of aphasia (attempts to classify aphasia into different
kinds of disturbance) is a confused and controversial topic, and is beyond
the scope of this book. Here we shall look at examples of name-ﬁnding
difficulties, which is perhaps the most widespread of all aphasic
symptoms. It affects some patients more than others, but it is usually
present to some degree in most types of speech disturbance. A vivid
description of this problem occurs in Kingsley Amis’s novel Ending Up
(1974). The ﬁctional aphasic is a retired university teacher, Professor
George Zeyer, who had a stroke 5 months previously:
‘Well, anyway, to start with he must have a, a, thing, you know,
you go about in it, it’s got, er, they turn round. A very expensive
one, you can be sure. You drive it, or someone else does in his
case. Probably gold, gold on the outside. Like that other chap. A
bar – no. And probably a gold, er, going to sleep on it. And the

same in his . . . When he washes himself. If he ever does, of
course. And eating off a gold – eating off it, you know. Not to
speak of a private, um, uses it whenever he wants to go anywhere
special, to one of those other places down there to see his pals.
Engine. No. With a fellow to ﬂy it for him. A plate. No, but
you know what I mean. And the point is it’s all because of us.
Without us he’d be nothing, would he? But for us he’d still be
living in his, ooh, made out of . . . with a black woman bringing
him, off the – growing there, you know. And the swine’s supposed
to be some sort of hero. Father of his people and all that. A plane,
a private plane, that’s it.’
It was not that George was out of his mind, merely that his
stroke had afﬂicted him, not only with hemiplegia, but also with
that condition in which the sufferer ﬁnds it difﬁcult to remember
nouns, common terms, the names of familiar objects. George was
otherwise ﬂuent and accurate and responded normally to other’s
speech. His ﬂuency was especially notable; he was very good at
not pausing at moments when a sympathetic hearer could have
supplied the elusive word. Doctors, including Dr Mainwaring, had
stated that the defect might clear up altogether in time, or might
stay as it was, and that there was nothing to be done about it.
Of course, not every aphasic is as ﬂuent as George. And sometimes
a patient is in the disquieting situation of thinking she has found the
right word – only to discover to her dismay, when she utters it, that
it is the wrong one. A description of this unnerving experience occurs
in Nabokov’s Pale Fire:
She still could speak. She paused and groped and found
What seemed at ﬁrst a serviceable sound,
But from adjacent cells imposters took
The place of words she needed, and her look
Spelt imploration as she sought in vain
To reason with the monsters in her brain.
Perhaps the following two extracts will give a clearer picture of the
problem. They are taken from tape-recordings of a severely aphasic
patient in her seventies who had had a stroke 2 months earlier.
The patient (P) has been uttering the word RHUBARB, apparently
because she is worried about her garden which is going to rack and
ruin while she is in hospital. The therapist (T) tries to comfort her
then says:

T:

P:

In the second extract, the same type of phenomenon occurs, but
in a different context.
T:

swimming)
P:
O HE’S IN THE SEA.
T:
YES.
P:

DRIVING WITH HIS FEET, HIS LEGS. DRIVING. WELL

T:

P:

T:

a boy climbing over a wall)
P:
DRIVING, ON A . . . ON A WALL.
T:
HE’S WHAT?
P:
DR . . . DRIVING, HE’S CLIMBING ON A WALL.
Some of the mistakes in these passages represent an extension of
the selection problems seen in ordinary slips of the tongue. That is,
some of the same kinds of mistakes occur as in normal speech, but
they occur more often. But there is often one major difference: aphasics
tend to perseverate, they perpetually repeat the same words, again and
again, as in the ﬁrst dialogue above where the patient kept repeating

the word RHUBARB. Or, to take another example from the same
patient, she was shown a picture of an apple. After some prompting,
she said the word APPLE. She was then shown a picture of a blue
ball. When asked what it was, she replied without hesitation APPLE.
The therapist pointed out that she was confusing the new object with
the previous one. ‘Of course, how stupid of me’, replied the patient.
‘This one’s an APPLE. No, no, I didn’t mean that, I mean APPLE!’
Meanwhile, repetitions are relatively unusual among normal people,
because they mostly have a very effective ‘wipe the slate clean’
mechanism. As soon as they have uttered a word, the phonetic form
no longer remains to clutter up the mind. But aphasics, often to their
frustration and despair, keep repeating sounds and words from the
sentence before.
Types of tongue slip
Broadly speaking, we may categorize the speech errors of normal
speakers into two basic types. First, we have those in which a wrong
item is chosen, where something has gone wrong with the selection
process. For example:
DID YOU REMEMBER TO BUY SOME TOOTHACHE? (Did you
remember to buy some toothpaste?)
Such errors are perhaps more accurately labelled ‘slips of the brain’.
Second, we ﬁnd errors in which the correct choice of word has
been made, but the utterance has been faultily assembled as in:
SOMEONE’S BEEN WRITENING THREAT LETTERS (Someone’s been
writing threatening letters).
Let us look at these two categories, selection errors and assemblage
errors more carefully, and attempt to subdivide them.
Errors in which wrong items have been chosen are most commonly
whole word errors. There are three main types: semantic errors (or similar
meaning errors), malapropisms (or similar sound errors) and blends. 
So-called semantic or similar meaning errors are fairly common. In
fact, they are so usual that they often pass unnoticed. We are talking
about naming errors in which the speaker gets the general ‘semantic
ﬁeld’ right, but uses the wrong word, as in:
DO YOU HAVE ANY ARTICHOKES? I’M SORRY, I MEAN AUBERGINES.

This kind of mistake often affects pairs of words. People say LEFT
when they mean ‘right’, UP when they mean ‘down’, and EARLY
instead of ‘late’, as in:
IT’S SIX O’CLOCK. WON’T THAT BE TOO EARLY TO BUY BREAD?
Mistakes like this occur repeatedly in the speech of some aphasics, and
in its extreme form the general condition is sometimes rather pompously
labelled ‘conceptual agrammatism’ (Goodglass 1968). Such patients
confuse words like YESTERDAY, TODAY and TOMORROW.
They seem able to ﬁnd names connected with the general area they
are talking about, but unable to pinpoint particular words within it,
so that a ‘garden roller’ could be called a LAWN MOWER, a ‘spade’
may be called a FORK, and a ‘rake’ may be called a HOE. A mistake
like this occurred in one of the aphasic passages quoted above, when
the patient said DIVING instead of ‘swimming’.
The second type of word selection error, so-called malapropisms
occur when a person confuses a word with another, similar sounding
one. The name comes from Mrs Malaprop, a character in Richard
Sheridan’s play The Rivals, who continually confused words which
sounded alike, as in:
SHE’S AS HEADSTRONG AS AN ALLEGORY ON THE BANKS OF THE
NILE (She’s as headstrong as an alligator on the banks of the Nile).
A NICE DERANGEMENT OF EPITAPHS (A nice arrangement of epithets).
Not only in Sheridan’s play, but in real life also, the results are sometimes
hilarious, as when an angry woman demanded:
WHAT ARE YOU INCINERATING? (insinuating)
Equally funny was a man’s statement that he had NUBILE TOES
meaning ‘mobile’ ones – though it is of course impossible to tell
sometimes, as in this case, whether he was genuinely confused about
the meaning of NUBILE.
So far, we have mentioned selection errors connected with meaning,
and selection errors connected with the sound of the word. But it
would be a mistake to assume that we can easily place mistakes into
one or the other category. Often the two overlap. Although children’s
mistakes are usually purely phonetic ones, as in:
MUSSOLINI PUDDING (semolina pudding)

NAUGHTY STORY CAR PARK (multi-storey car park),
the majority of adult ones have some type of semantic as well as
phonetic link as when a lady lecturer claimed that:
YOU KEEP NEWBORN CHICKS WARM IN AN INCINERATOR (You
keep newborn chicks warm in an incubator).
In addition to the phonetic similarity, both words are connected with
the idea of heat. Another example is the statement:
YOU GO UNDER A RUNWAY BRIDGE (You go under a railway bridge).
Here, in addition to the similar sounds, both words describe a track
for a means of transport. Yet another example is the error:
COMPENSATION PRIZE (consolation prize).
However, the semantic connection does not always have to be
between the two words that are being confused. Sometimes the
intruding idea comes in from the surrounding context, as in the
statement:
LEARNING TO SPEAK IS NOT THE SAME THING AS LEARNING TO
TALK (Learning to speak is not the same thing as learning to walk).
Another example of this type of confusion was uttered by a nervous
male involved in a discussion on BBC’s Woman’s Hour about a cat
who never seemed to sleep, because it was perpetually chasing mice.
He said:
HOW MANY SHEEP DOES THE CAT HAVE IN ITS HOUSE THEN? I’M
SORRY, I MEAN MICE, NOT SHEEP.
The speaker correctly remembered that he was talking about an animal
of some kind, but the animal had somehow become contaminated by
the sound of the word SLEEP, resulting in SHEEP! He may also have
been inﬂuenced by the fact that humans reputedly count sheep jumping
over fences in order to get to sleep.
The third type of selection error, so-called blends, are an extension
and variation of semantic errors. They are fairly rare, and occur when
two words are ‘blended’ together to form one new one. For example:

NOT IN THE SLEAST
is a mixture of ‘slightest and least’. And:
PLEASE EXPLAND THAT
is a mixture of ‘explain and expand’. A rather more bizarre example
of a blend occurs in the ﬁrst passage of aphasic speech quoted on 
p. 240. The patient had been talking about RHUBARB, and was
trying to think of the word APPLE. What came out was a mixture
of the two, RABBIT! Such mixes are also known as contaminations
since the two words involved ‘contaminate’ one another. Often, if
the speaker is quite well, both the items chosen are equally appropriate.
The speaker seems to have accidentally picked two together – or
rather failed to choose between two equally appropriate words in time.
She has not so much picked the wrong word, as not decided which
of the right ones she needed.
Sometimes two items are intentionally blended together in order to
create a new word. Lewis Carroll makes Humpty Dumpty explain in
Alice Through the Looking Glass that SLITHY means ‘lithe and slimy’,
commenting, ‘You see, it’s like a portmanteau – there are two meanings
packed up into one word’ – though Lewis Carroll’s made-up words
may not be as intentional as they appear. Apparently, he suffered from
severe migraine attacks, and many of his strange neologisms are uncannily
like the kind of temporary aphasia produced by some migraine sufferers
(Livesley 1972). Perhaps better examples of intentional blends are SMOG
from ‘smoke and fog’, and BRUNCH from ‘breakfast and lunch’.
Occasional parallels of this type can be spotted between slips of the
tongue and language change (Aitchison 2001).
Let us now turn to assemblage errors – errors in which the correct
word choice has been made, but the items chosen have been faultily
assembled. There are three main types: transpositions, anticipations
and repetitions, which may affect words, syllables or sounds.
Transpositions are not, on the whole, very common (Cohen 1966;
Nooteboom 1969). Whole words can switch places, as in:
DON’T BUY A CAR WITH ITS TAIL IN THE ENGINE (Don’t buy a car
with its engine in the tail).
I CAN’T HELP THE CAT IF IT’S DELUDED (I can’t help it if the cat’s
deluded).
and so can syllables:

I’D LIKE A VIENEL SCHNITZER (I’d like a Viener schnitzel).
But perhaps the best known are the sound transpositions known as
spoonerisms. These are named after a real-life person, the Reverend
William A. Spooner, who was Dean and Warden of New College,
Oxford, around the turn of the century. Reputedly, he often transposed
the initial sounds of words, resulting in preposterous sentences, such
as:
THE CAT POPPED ON ITS DRAWERS (The cat dropped on its paws).
YOU HAVE HISSED ALL MY MYSTERY LECTURES (You have missed
all my history lectures).
YOU HAVE TASTED THE WHOLE WORM (You have wasted the whole
term).
However, there is something distinctly odd about these old spoonerisms.
One suspects that the utterances of the Reverend Spooner were
carefully prepared for posterity, probably by his students. The odd
features are that they always make sense, they affect only initial sounds,
and there is no discernible phonetic reason for the transposed sounds.
In real life, spoonerisms do not usually make sense, as in:
TILVER SILLER (silver tiller).
They can affect non-initial sounds, as in:
A COP OF CUFFEE (a cup of coffee).
And they frequently occur between phonetically similar sounds, as
LEAK WINK (weak link).
Anticipations, particularly sound anticipations, are the most widespread
type of assemblage error. Here, a speaker anticipates what he is going
to say by bringing in an item too early. It is not always possible to
distinguish between anticipations and potential transpositions if the
speaker stops himself half-way through, after realizing his error. This
may partially account for the high recorded proportion of anticipations
compared with transpositions. For example, the following could be a
prematurely cut off transposition:
I WANT YOU TO TELL MILLICENT . . . I MEAN, I WANT YOU TO TELL
MARY WHAT MILLICENT SAID.

But the following sound anticipations are clearly just simple
anticipations. A participant in a television discussion referred, much
to his embarrassment, to:
THE WORST GERMAN CHANCELLOR (The West German Chancellor).
Here he had anticipated the vowel in GERMAN. The same thing
happened to the man who, interrupting over-eagerly, begged to make:
AN IMPOITANT POINT (an important point).
Repetitions (or perseverations) are rather rarer than anticipations, though
commoner than transpositions. We ﬁnd repeated words, as in:
A:
ISN’T IT COLD? MORE LIKE A SUNDAY IN FEBRUARY.
B:
IT’S NOT TOO BAD – MORE LIKE A FEBRUARY IN
MARCH I’D SAY (It’s not too bad – more like a Sunday in
March).
An example of a repeated sound occurred when someone referred
to:
THE BOOK BY CHOMSKY AND CHALLE (Chomsky and Halle).
perhaps an indication of the mesmerizing effect of Chomsky on a
number of linguists!
We have now outlined the main types of selection and assemblage
errors:
Selection Errors 
Assemblage Errors 
Semantic errors
Transpositions
Malapropisms
Anticipations
Blends
Repetitions
The most slippable units, incidentally, are words and phonemes
(signiﬁcant sounds), after these come morphemes (meaningful chunks
of word) (Bock 1991).
What (if anything) can we learn from this seemingly strange array
of errors? In fact, quite a lot. First, we can suggest what the units of
planning are – in other words, the size of chunk we prepare in advance

ready for utterance. Second, we can look at the process of word
selection. Third, we can make hypotheses as to how words and syntax
are planned and assembled.
The unit of planning
The unit of planning appears to be what is sometimes called a tone
group, or phonemic clause – a short stretch of speech spoken with a
single intonation contour. For example:
WHAT TIME IS IT?
DEBORAH BOUGHT SOME SNAILS.
MAX TOOK A BATH.
Note, by the way, that a so-called phonemic clause (or tone group)
must not be confused with a syntactic clause (or sentoid). The two
quite often coincide, but do not necessarily do so. For example:
I WANT TO BUY SOME BUNS.
is a single phonemic clause, though is usually regarded as containing
two underlying syntactic clauses. In this chapter the word clause refers
to a phonemic clause, unless otherwise stated.
The main reason for conﬁdently asserting that the tone group is
the unit of planning is that slips of the tongue usually occur within
a single tone group. For example:
WE’LL GO TO TAXI IN A CHOMSKY (We’ll go to Chomsky in a taxi).
WE FORGED THIS CONGRESS . . . CONTRACT IN OUR OWN
CONGRESSES (We forged this contract in our own congresses).
This strongly suggests that each tone group is planned and executed
as a whole. If larger units were prepared, we would expect to ﬁnd
frequent contamination between clauses. As it is, such interference is
rare, so much so that Boomer and Laver (1968) regard it as a tongue
slip ‘law’ that ‘The target and the origin of a tongue-slip are both
located in the same tone-group’ (with ‘law’ to be understood in a
statistical rather than in an absolute sense).
On the rare occasions when this ‘law’ is broken, whole words can
slip into the preceding clause. That is, words can cross clause boundaries,
whereas sounds generally do not. For example:

WHEN YOU BUY THE LAUNDRY . . . (When you take the laundry,
please buy me some cigarettes).
WHEN YOU TAKE THE ROSES OUT, ADMIRE . . . (When you take the
garbage out, admire the roses).
EXTINGUISH YOUR SEATBELTS . . . (Extinguish your cigarettes and
fasten your seatbelts).
Compare these with the following sound transpositions and anticipa-
tions, which all occur within the same clause:
SHE WROTE ME A YETTER . . . (letter yesterday).
TWAPTER CHELVE (chapter twelve).
A COP OF CUFFEE (a cup of coffee).
DOG WAS . . . (Doug was a doctor).
This phenomenon indicates that key words are thought out while the
preceding clause is being uttered – whereas the detailed organization
of a tone group is probably left till later.
Word selection
Moving on therefore to word selection, our most direct information
comes from a famous ‘tip of the tongue’ (TOT) experiment (Brown
and McNeill 1966). Less direct evidence comes from selection errors.
The TOT experiment was a simple one. The researchers assembled
a group of students, and read them out deﬁnitions of relatively un-
common words. For example, when the ‘target’ word was SEXTANT,
the students heard the deﬁnition: ‘A navigational instrument used in
measuring angular distances, especially the altitude of sun, moon and
stars at sea.’ Some of the students recognized the right word imme-
diately. But others went into a TOT (‘tip of the tongue’) state. They
felt they were on the verge of getting the word, but not quite there.
In this state the researchers asked them to ﬁll in a questionnaire about
their mental search. To their surprise, they found that the students
could provide quite a lot of information about the elusive missing
name. Sometimes the information was semantic, and sometimes it was
phonetic. For example, in response to the deﬁnition of SEXTANT,
several students provided the similar meaning words ASTROLABE,
COMPASS and PROTRACTOR. Others remembered that it had
two syllables and began with an S, and made guesses such as SECANT,
SEXTON or SEXTET.

Semantically, this suggests that similar meaning words are linked
together in the mind. We probably activate a number of them, before
pinpointing one in particular. When errors occur, we have been
insufficiently precise in locating the exact one needed – as with
YESTERDAY instead of ‘tomorrow,’ SHIRT instead of ‘blouse,’ and
(another example from the TOT experiment) BARGE, HOUSE-
BOAT, JUNK instead of ‘sampan’.
Phonetically, we ﬁnd a similar picture. People seem to activate
several similar-sounding words, before narrowing down the ﬁeld to
one. Malapropisms such as COMPETENCE for ‘confidence’ and
NATIVE APE for ‘naked ape’ suggest that people look for words
with certain outline characteristics, such as similar initial consonant
and number of syllables before they ﬁnally select one. Adults give
higher priority to the initial consonant than to the number of syllables,
so that they often produce malapropisms such as CONDESCENDING
for ‘condensing’, and SEGREGATED for ‘serrated’. Children, on the
other hand, seem to pay extra attention to the number of syllables,
and produce comparatively more malapropisms with a wrong initial
consonant, as in ICE CREAM TOILET for ‘ice cream cornet’ (cornet
= cone), MISTAKE CAR for ‘estate car’, LEPRECHAUN for
‘unicorn’ (Aitchison and Straf 1981). The situation is not quite as
straightforward as suggested above, because a number of other factors
play a role in memory, such as the presence of a rhyming sufﬁx, as
in PERISCOPE for ‘stethoscope’, PORCUPINE for ‘concubine’.
And sometimes a word can get ‘blocked’ by a similar-sounding one:
‘His name begins’ with an R. I know it’s not Rupert, but that’s the
name I keep thinking of.’ The target was Robert. As with all psycho-
linguistic phenomena, a large number of intertwined variables need
to be considered (Aitchison 2003a).
The mechanism involved when words are selected is becoming
clearer. We probably start with the ‘idea of a word’, then only later
ﬁt it to a phonetic form. This is shown by cases when we cannot
remember a key word, even though it is clearly ‘there’ in some sense:
HE TOOK A LOT OF . . . WHAT’S THE WORD I WANT? ER . . .
PERSUASION.
But in ﬂuent speech, selecting the meaning and ﬁtting on the sounds
are processes which overlap. People probably begin to ﬁnd possible
phonetic forms while they are still ﬁnalizing their choice of word.
This is shown by slips in which the word uttered has some meaning
and some sound similarity to the target, as in HE WAS IN THE
NEXT TRAIN COMPONENT (compartment).

A ‘spreading activation’ or ‘interactive activation’ model is a plausible
explanation (Roelofs 1992; Aitchison 2003a). In this model, activation
of similar words spreads out and diffuses in a chain reaction. If someone
was trying to say MONDAY, all the days of the week would be
strongly activated, which would in turn activate the months of the
year, though less strongly. Each meaning would stimulate a sound
pattern which in turn would rouse further sound patterns. So the ‘idea’
of MONDAY might trigger MONDAY, MAYDAY or MIDDAY,
SATURDAY and SUNDAY would trigger each other, and so on.
The task of the speaker is not only to select the word she wants, but
to suppress the ones she does not require, though sometimes this
process goes wrong:
IT’S AN EXOTIC PLANT, AN ASPIDISTRA NO, AN AMARYLLIS, ER,
GLADIOLI, AH – CHAMELEON (CAMELLIA).
Such word-searches are normal. They usually take place fast and
privately, but occasionally slowly and openly, as here. The speaker
has activated various polysyllabic plant names, homed in on those with
a stressed syllable before L, then at the last moment substituted an
animal, CHAMELEON, for the shrub ‘camellia’.
Aphasics in particular have problems over suppression. They let
through a far wider range of inappropriate words than normal speakers,
though there is usually some link with the target, as in DRIVING
for ‘swimming’, caused by DRIVING for ‘diving’ and DIVING for
‘swimming’. Sufferers from Alzheimer’s disease have even greater
problems (Astell and Harley 1996; Blanken 1998).

The general picture is clear. Words which are relevant both in
sound and meaning get more and more excited. Finally, one wins out
over the others – though a TOT state may occur if the word has
been only partially activated (Harley and Bown 1998).
Planning and assemblage
Let us now consider how the words and syntax are planned and
assembled. We can divide this into two main stages: first, outline planning,
which begins while the previous clause is being uttered. Second, detailed
planning, which takes place while the clause is actually in progress.
Outline planning means the choice of key words, syntax and intonation
pattern, whereas detailed planning involves the ﬁtting together of
previously chosen words and syntax.
We know that outline planning includes the choice of intonation
pattern, because errors which occur within the tone group (the unit
of planning) do not normally disrupt the intonation pattern, as in:
TAKE THE FREEZES OUT OF THE STEAKER.
We are now faced with a tricky and once much disputed question:
which comes ﬁrst, the words or the syntactic pattern? Those who
argued that the words come ﬁrst pointed out quite simply that ‘key’
words determine the choice of syntax, and by ‘key’ words they mean
above all nouns, verbs and sometimes adjectives. Clearly, verbs inﬂuence
the choice of syntax more than the nouns – but the noun may, in
some cases, inﬂuence the choice of verb.
Those who suggest that the syntax comes ﬁrst note that when a
speaker makes a word selection error, she almost always picks a wrong
word belonging to the same word class as the target word. That is,
nouns are confused with other nouns, verbs with other verbs, and
adjectives with other adjectives. Even aphasic speech, which is often
quite garbled, tends to follow this pattern (though exceptions do occur).
People say UP instead of ‘down’, JELLY instead of ‘blancmange’,
TRANSLATION instead of ‘transformation’. But there is no reason
for parts of speech to cling together like this. Why shouldn’t verbs
and nouns get confused? The ﬁctional Mrs Malaprop gets her word
classes confused much of the time, which is why many of her
malapropisms are implausible. She says things such as:
YOU WILL PROMISE TO FORGET THIS FELLOW – TO ILLITERATE
HIM, I SAY, QUITE FROM YOUR MEMORY (You will promise . . . to
obliterate him . . . from your memory).

But in real life, it is extremely unusual to ﬁnd adjective–verb confusions
of the ILLITERATE for ‘obliterate’ type uttered by Mrs Malaprop.
Even malapropisms uttered by children generally follow this similar
word-class pattern:
YOU TAKE AN ANTELOPE IF YOU SWALLOW POISON (You take an
antidote if you swallow poison).
I’M LEARNING TO PLAY THE ELBOW (I’m learning to play the oboe).
According to the ‘syntax ﬁrst’ supporters, the most likely explanation
for this phenomenon is that the syntax has already been chosen, and
the words are then slotted in: ‘Unless the syntactic structure is already
constructed, word selection would not be constrained to proper word
classes’ (Fromkin 1973: 30).
How are we to solve this controversy between the ‘words ﬁrst’ and
‘syntax ﬁrst’ supporters? Who is right? Possibly both sides, to some
extent, and the controversy seems fairly old-fashioned. We now know
that the human brain is capable of complex parallel processing, so
possibly, the speaker is thinking up both at the same time. On the
one hand, it is unlikely that the key-word advocates are entirely correct.
There is no evidence that we assemble all the key words, and then
bind them together with joining words. On the other hand, it is quite
impossible to plan the syntax with no idea of the lexical items which
are going to be used. For example, the syntax of:
JOHN CLAIMED TO BE ABLE TO EAT A LIVE FROG.
must depend to some extent on the word CLAIM since other words
with a similar meaning take a different construction. We cannot say:
*JOHN ASSERTED TO BE ABLE TO EAT A LIVE FROG.
or
*JOHN DECLARED TO BE ABLE TO EAT A LIVE FROG.
We possibly start by picking one key verb or noun, and then build the
syntax around it. Later we slot other words into the remaining gaps.
If one key word triggers off the syntax, then we must assume that
words in storage are clearly marked with their word class or part of
speech (e.g. noun, verb) as well as with information about the con-
structions they can enter into. For example:

EAT

NP–EAT–NP
We are, therefore, hypothesizing that when people plan utterances
they mentally set up syntactic trees which are built around selected
key words:
A key word can be used in planning before it has acquired its
phonetic form. This is indicated by slips of the tongue such as:
WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE RECOVERED BY?
In this sentence the syntax was picked for ‘mend’, but the phonetic
form activated was RECOVERED. The ‘word idea’ or lemma here
is not just an intangible ‘concept’, but a deﬁnite and ﬁrmly packaged
lexical item. The useful, and now widely used term lemma has been
borrowed from lexicographers (dictionary writers) who have for a long
time used it for a ‘dictionary entry’. It includes both an understanding
of what is being referred to and a ﬁrm word class label (verb), as well
as (perhaps) information about the syntactic conﬁgurations it can enter
into. Throughout this outline stage, sentence plans are ﬂexible and
can be altered (Ferreira 1996). Outline and detailed planning partly
overlap.
By the detailed planning stage, at least some major lexical and syntactic
choices have been ﬁrmly made. The items already chosen now have
to be correctly assembled. Lexical items have to be put into their
correct slots in the sentence. This has been wrongly carried out in:
IT’S BAD TO HAVE TOO MUCH BLOOD IN THE ALCOHOL STREAM
(It’s bad to have too much alcohol in the blood stream).
A FIFTY-POUND DOG OF BAG FOOD (A ﬁfty-pound bag of dog food).

253

The slotting in of lexical items must also include ﬁtting in negatives,
since these can get disturbed, as in:
IT’S THE KIND OF FURNITURE I NEVER SAID I’D HAVE (It’s the kind of
furniture I said I’d never have).
I DISREGARD THIS AS PRECISE (I regard this as imprecise).
Another type of detailed planning involves adding on word endings
in the appropriate place (Garrett 1988). This has been done incorrectly
in:
SHE WASH UPPED THE DISHES (She washed up the dishes).
SHE COME BACKS TOMORROW (She comes back tomorrow).
HE BECAME MENTALIER UNHEALTHY (He became mentally unhealthier).
However, we can say rather more about the assemblage of words
and endings than the vague comment that they are ‘slotted together’.
We noted in Chapter 3 that speakers seem to have an internal neural
‘pacemaker’ – a biological ‘beat’ which helps them to integrate and
organize their utterances, and that this pacemaker may utilize the
syllable as a basic unit. If we look more carefully, we ﬁnd that syllables
are organized into feet – a foot being a unit which includes a ‘strong’
or stressed syllable. And feet are organized into tone groups. In other
words, we have a hierarchy of rhythmic units: tone groups made up
of feet, and feet made up of syllables:

So within each tone group an utterance is planned foot by foot.
This is indicated by the fact that transposed words are normally similarly
stressed, and occupy similar places in their respective feet. For example:
HE FOUND A WÍFE FOR HIS JÓB (He found a job for his wife).
THE QUÁKE CAUSED EXTENSIVE VÁLLEY IN THE DÁMAGE (The
quake caused extensive damage in the valley).
Within each foot, the stressed or ‘tonic’ word may be activated ﬁrst,
since tonic words are statistically more likely to be involved in tongue
slips than unstressed ones (Boomer and Laver 1968). Moreover, the
importance of the syllable as a ‘psychologically real’ unit is shown by
the fact that tongue slips ‘obey a structural law with regard to syllable
place’. That is, the initial sound of a syllable will affect another initial
sound, a ﬁnal sound will affect another ﬁnal, and vowels affect vowels,
as in:
JAWFULLY LOINED (lawfully joined).
HASS OR GRASH (hash or grass).
BUD BEGS (bed bugs).
According to one theory, sound misplacements like those above
occur because a ‘scan-copying’ mechanism has gone wrong (Shattuck-
Hufnagel 1979). Supposedly, words already selected for utterance are
kept chalked up on a mental blackboard, waiting to be used. A scanning
device copies each word segment across into its correct place, then
wipes it off the blackboard. In an error such as LOWING THE
MORN (mowing the lawn) the L in LAWN was mistakenly copied
across to the beginning of the wrong word, and wiped away. The
remaining M was then copied on to the only available word-beginning.
In a repetition error, such as CHEW CHEW (two) TABLETS, the
speaker forgot to wipe CH off the board after copying it.
As in CHEW CHEW, misplaced segments end up forming real
though inappropriate words more often than one would expect from
chance (Motley 1985). HOLED AND SEALED (soled and heeled),
BEEF NEEDLE (noodle) SOUP, MORE THAN YOUR WIFE’S
(life’s) WORTH are further examples of this tendency. This is possible
evidence of the existence of a monitoring device which double-checks
the ﬁnal result to see if it is plausible. An overhasty check has perhaps
allowed these real words through.
The general picture of speech production is of practised behaviour
performed in a great hurry, such a hurry that the speaker does not

have time to check the details in full. Just as in the comprehension
of speech, listeners employ perceptual strategies (short cuts which
enable them to jump to conclusions about what they are hearing), so
in the production of speech, production strategies are possibly utilized.
A speaker does not have time to check each segment of the word in
detail, but may make use of a monitoring device to stop the utterance
of too many inappropriate words. If, however, a word happens to be
superﬁcially plausible, it is likely to pass the monitoring device and
be uttered.
Let us recapitulate: at the outline planning stage, the key words,
syntax, and intonation of the tone group as a whole are set up. At
the detailed planning stage, words and endings are slotted in foot by
foot, with the stressed word in each foot possibly activated ﬁrst. Finally,
the remaining unstressed syllables are assembled – though all these
stages overlap partially. The next stage starts before the previous one
is ﬁnished.
Where does all this leave us? We are gradually assembling infor-
mation, and testing hypotheses. More importantly, psycholinguists have
realized the need for a model which ties everything together. Such
models are under continuous development, and these days computers
are an essential tool. They allow one to specify components precisely,
and to test their interactions. A promising model is one known as
WEAVER, which is an acronym (word formed from initial letters)
of ‘Word-form Encoding by Activation and VERiﬁcation’ (Roelofs
1997, 2005). There are still gaps in our knowledge, and much of what
we have said is hypothetical. We have realized that, for every clause
uttered, a human speaker must be carrying out a number of complex
overlapping tasks. The question of how all this is ﬁtted together still
needs further clariﬁcation. Perhaps, as an epilogue to the problems of
speech planning and production, we can quote the words of a character
in Oscar Wilde’s play The Importance of Being Earnest, who commented
that ‘Truth is never pure, and rarely simple.’

12 Banker’s clerk or
hippopotamus?
The future
He thought he saw a Banker’s Clerk
Descending from a bus: 
He looked again, and found it was 
A Hippopotamus. 
Lewis Carroll, Sylvie and Bruno 
Psycholinguistics is, as this book has shown, a ﬁeld of study riddled
with controversies. Frequently, apparently simple data can be interpreted
in totally different ways. Psycholinguists often ﬁnd themselves in the
same situation as the Lewis Carroll character who is not sure whether
he is looking at a banker’s clerk or a hippopotamus.
In this general situation, it would be over-optimistic to predict the
future with any conﬁdence. However, certain lines of inquiry have
emerged as important. Perhaps a useful way to summarize them is to
outline brieﬂy the conclusions we have reached so far, and show the
issues which arise from them.
General conclusions
Three psycholinguistic topics were singled out in the Introduction as
particularly important: the acquisition question, the relationship of
linguistic knowledge to language usage, and the comprehension and
production of speech – and these areas were the principal concerns
of this book.
In Chapter 1, the age-old nurture versus nature controversy was
outlined. Is language a skill which humans learn, such as knitting? Or
is it natural phenomenon, such as walking or sexual activity? Skinner’s
(1957) attempt to explain language as similar to the bar-pressing antics
of rats was a dismal failure, as Chomsky showed. Chomsky proposed

instead that the human species is pre-programmed for language. This
claim was examined in the next few chapters.
In Chapter 2, human language and animal communication were
compared. Some features of human language were found to be shared
with some animal communication systems, but no animal system
possessed them all. Attempts to teach sign and symbol systems to non-
human apes were described: after a lot of effort, these apes could cope
with some of the rudimentary characteristics of human language, but
their achievements were far inferior to those of human children. Above
all, intention reading and pattern ﬁnding seemed to be beyond the
ability range of non-humans.
In Chapter 3, the hard biological evidence was discussed: the human
brain, teeth, tongue and vocal cords have been adapted to the needs
of speech. In addition, talking requires the synchronization of so many
different operations, humans seem to be ‘set’ to cope with this task.
In Chapter 4, Lenneberg’s claim (1967) that language is biologically
controlled behaviour was examined. Language ﬁts into this category
of behaviour: it emerges when the individual reaches a certain level
of maturation, then develops at its own natural pace, following a pre-
dictable sequence of milestones. In modern terminology, the behaviour
is innately guided. This makes the nature versus nurture debate
unnecessary: nature triggers the behaviour, and lays down the frame-
work, but careful nurturing is required for it to reach its full potential.
In Chapter 5, Chomsky’s changing views on innateness were
outlined. His ideas became increasingly abstract, and difﬁcult to test.
Consequently, some younger scholars have proposed that careful
attention now needs to be paid to the actual step-by-step stages by
which children acquire language.
Chapter 6 looked at children’s early speech. Their output is not
just a random amalgam of badly copied adult utterances. Instead, they
are instinctively aware that language is ‘rule-governed’, in that it follows
consistent patterns. However, in the early stages, the rules are not
necessarily linguistic ones: children might just be applying their general
intelligence.
In Chapter 7, three different views on child language were con-
sidered. First, Chomsky’s proposal that children contain specific
linguistic information which requires minimal exposure to activate was
not borne out by the evidence. Second, the claim that children solve
the puzzle of language by using their general intelligence, aided by
helpful parents and a desire to satisfy their everyday needs, was not
supported either: several individuals had been found who displayed a
huge discrepancy between their linguistic and general cognitive abilities.

Third, the suggestion that children make use of an inbuilt linguistic
puzzle-solving device seemed nearest the truth, though the interaction
between inherited principles, caretaker input, and changing mental
organization is still unclear.
In Chapter 8, the reasons behind Chomsky’s changing ideas about
language were outlined: why he proposed a transformational grammar
in his early work, and why he has now moved on to trying to specify
deeper, more abstract linguistic knowledge.
In Chapter 9, we described attempts by psycholinguists in the 1960s
and 1970s to test whether a transformational grammar was used in the
comprehension and production of speech. We concluded that it
represents a linguistic archive which is not directly used, but is available
for consultation if necessary. This archive was of interest to anyone
trying to understand language, but was not speciﬁcally linked to either
comprehension or production.
Chapter 10 explored comprehension. The role of the lexicon, or
mental dictionary, is crucial. Numerous possible candidate words are
automatically activated as a sentence is heard, then unwanted ones 
are suppressed. Verbs, and the structure associated with them, are of
particular importance. These linguistic factors interact with general
psychological ones, such as memory limitations.
Chapter 11 looked at speech production. ‘Slips of the tongue’
provide useful clues. They indicate that each clause is partially planned
while the previous one is being uttered. Some key words, outline
syntax and the intonation pattern are possibly planned ﬁrst, then the
remaining words and endings are slotted into place.
Future prospects
Let us now summarize our broad conclusions concerning the three
topics we investigated, and look at future prospects.
The acquisition question 
Language cannot be explained simply as an offshoot of general intel-
ligence, even though humans obviously use general cognitive abilities
when they speak. Equally, infants do not have ﬁxed chunks of pre-
information about language. Instead, they are naturally geared to
processing linguistic data.
At each stage, children can handle only a certain amount: their
mind is a natural ﬁlter, like a ﬁshing net with a particular size mesh,

which catches some ﬁsh, but lets others slip away. A child’s mind
therefore never gets overloaded. Once a certain amount of language
is in place, this forms the basis for another trawl with another net,
probably one with a slightly different-sized mesh. And so on and so
on. Children move forward partly because each stage reached forms
the basis for tackling the next. This general process is known as epigenesis
(e.g. Carey and Gelman 1991). Psychologists and linguists need to
combine in order to tease out the details of the epigenetic sequence
associated with language.
But what about the perennial nature versus nurture problem with
which this book started? Current research suggests that children classify
the world in accordance with the categories within their own language
to a far greater extent than had previously been realized. At one time,
it was assumed that children had some basic inbuilt spatial concepts
such as up versus down, in versus out, front versus back, and so on. But
this is turning out to be unlikely. Instead, children quickly learn about
the spatial categories adopted by their own language (e.g. Bowerman
and Levinson 2001; Bowerman and Choi 2003; Gentner and Goldin-
Meadow 2003). Research on languages such as Korean and Tzotzil
(a Mayan language) has led to a renewed interest in language diversity,
and is revealing the ﬂexibility of young minds. Children’s ability to
cope with unpredictable variation is pre-ordained, but language-speciﬁc
principles have to be learned from experience: ‘One thing . . . is
becoming clear: just as infants are geared from the beginning to discover
umderlying phonological regularities in the speech stream, so too they
are born to zero in on language-speciﬁc patterns in the organization
of meaning’ (Bowerman and Choi 2003: 418).
Renewed interest in acquisition has led to further exploration into
the origin of language and general principles of linguistic evolution
(e.g. Aitchison 1996/2000; Jackendoff 2002), as well as the similarities
and differences between child language and language development in
the species.
The relationship of language knowledge to language usage 
Chomsky has always denied that his views have any direct connection
to language usage, and as already pointed out, his latest work explores
ever more abstract constraints on language, in the hope of enabling
linguists to gain a better idea of the bounds within which language
operates.
However, Chomsky is not the only linguist whose ideas are worth
attention. Several more recent proposals about human grammars are

currently being explored, and almost all of them propose a fairly close
relationship between language knowledge and language usage. Michael
Tomasello’s usage-based theory was introduced in Chapter 5 (Tomasello
2003). Adele Goldberg (1995) was a major attempt to bridge the gap
between verb structure and semantics. (Verb structures were discussed
in Aitchison (2003a): this topic has therefore not been a major concern
in the current book.) Culicover and Jackendoff have written a book
titled Simpler Syntax (2005) which, they claim, ‘leads to a vision of
the language faculty that better facilitates the integration of linguistic
theory with concerns of processing, acquisition and biological evolution’
(2005: xiv).
Within psychology, connectionist approaches have revolutionized
psycholinguistics, it is sometimes claimed (e.g. Harley 2001: 22). The
physiological ﬂavour of such models exerts a great appeal (Chapter 3),
in that they use the brain as a metaphor for the mind: they manipulate
units which are somewhat like neurons, and their interactions can be
observed. Connectionist models do not ‘wave their arms about’. Instead,
they explicitly predict how humans are likely to behave, even though,
so far, they have handled only small parts of language. How far they
will succeed with bigger chunks and more complex constructions is
of great interest.
However, the links between humans and machines is by no means
straightforward (e.g. Zock 1997; Fitch 2005). Humans are not very
logical, and have a limited working memory. They recognize complex
patterns, and are good pattern matchers. But they are also intuitive
and creative, and often jump to premature conclusions. They are good
at solving some types of problems, and not others: if their self-interest
is involved, their performance increases dramatically (Cosmides and
Tooby 1995). The similarities and differences between humans and
machines will undoubtedly continue to attract considerable attention.
Speech comprehension and production 
Comprehending and producing speech are far more complex processes
than was once assumed. Parallel processing is the norm, and the
suppression of unwanted alternatives is as important as the selection
of particular words and structures.
A major existing strand of research which will increasingly supple-
ment experimental and naturalistic studies is brain monitoring as words
are comprehended or uttered (Chapter 3).
An expanding body of work is exploring general cognitive develop-
ment, looking at why and how humans have won out over other

species. A paper, aptly called ‘Why We’re so Smart’ (Gentner 2003)
attempts to list the cognitive skills we possess, and the list is impressive.
It includes an ability to reason analogically (Gentner et al. 2001), to
think abstractly, to compare representations, to reason about different
possible worlds, and so on, and so on. Current thinking suggests that
language and thought interact productively: ‘Language can act as a
lens through which we see the world; it can provide us with tools
through which we enlarge our capabilities; it can help us appreciate
groupings in the world that we might not have otherwise grasped’
(Gentner and Goldin-Meadow 2003: 12).
The growing interest in language and other aspects of cognition has
led to a huge interest in the encoding of spatial information and how
this interacts with language (e.g. Bloom et al. 1996; Levinson 2003).
However, psycholinguistics is like a railway, with numerous branch-
ing tracks. Many other topics have already attracted the attention of
psycholinguists, and will in all likelihood continue to do so, as, for
example, the origin of language (Aitchison 1996/2000), language
change (Aitchison 2001) and the mental lexicon (Aitchison 2003a). A
broad approach known as ‘cognitive linguistics’ is expanding (e.g.
Ungerer and Schmid 1996; Taylor 2002;). Note also discourse analysis
and language use (Chafe 1994; Brown 1995; Clark 1996) as well as
capacities other than language, such as music (Jackendoff 1994.)
Half a century ago, psycholinguistics was a new, fringe discipline,
like a small spring or a seedling compared to the more mature areas
of linguistics and psychology. Now, it can be viewed as a wide river,
which is gathering increasing momentum as other streams feed into
it. Or we can perhaps envisage it as a ﬂourishing tree, whose branches
shoot out in all directions, and which is likely to get taller and stronger
still. Exactly how the subject will develop is uncertain. Psycholinguistics
is a ﬁeld of study likely to spring surprises on researchers. A seemingly
dead and forgotten area may suddenly spring into life. The words of
the folklorist A.L. Lloyd are as applicable to psycholinguistics as they
are to traditional music. Like the local song tradition, it has:
proved robust enough to receive all kinds of new nourishment
and to digest it satisfactorily. Only a moribund tradition is dominated
by the past; a living tradition is constantly sprouting new leaves
on old wood and sometimes quite suddenly the bush is ablaze
with blossom of a novel shade.
(Lloyd 1967: 71)

Suggestions for further reading
This section contains suggestions for further reading. I have kept these
fairly sparse, since the books recommended all provide further refer-
ences. Also, many other books and papers are mentioned in the text.
Introduction
This book does not require any background reading. Everything is (I
hope) explained in the text. But for those who would like to acquaint
themselves with linguistics, there are numerous elementary textbooks.
The following are straightforward, fairly easy-to-read introductions:
Akmajian et al. (2001); Aitchison (2003b); Fromkin et al. (2007).
Aitchison (1996/2000) explores the origin of language, but includes
quite a lot of basic linguistic information; Aitchison (1997) deals with
several key language topics; Clark et al. (1994) is a book of elementary
readings, which cover a wide range.
Altmann (1997) is a shortish introduction written by a psychologist,
and so is the more extensive introduction to psycholinguistics by Harley
(2001). Jackendoff (2002) explores language within a broad cognitive
and evolutionary framework.
Aitchison (2003c) provides a concise glossary of terms relating to
language and the mind, and Field (2004) explores some of these terms
in greater depth. Field (2005) is a workbook on topics relating to
psycholinguistics.
Chapter 1
This chapter is based to a large extent on Chomsky’s review of Skinner’s
book Verbal Behavior (Chomsky 1959). This article, now a linguistic
‘classic’, is still a useful starting point for understanding the direction
taken by language acquisition studies in the 1960s and early 1970s.

Note that Chomsky sometimes in his writings wrongly implied that
Skinner typiﬁed the mainstream of psychological thought, a misleading
fallacy (as Sampson 1975, explains).
The viewpoint that language is entirely dependent on general
cognitive abilities gained popularity in the 1970s, when it was christened
‘the cognitive revolution’ by some of its supporters. This movement
is well represented by Donaldson (1978), Sampson (1980), Bates et al.
(1988) and MacWhinney and Bates (1989). More recently, the pendu-
lum has swung back the other way, towards the viewpoint that humans
are pre-wired for language, e.g. Pinker (1994), though mostly in an
increasingly milder form, which accepts that language is a nature-
nurture mix (e.g. Tomasello 2003).
Chapter 2
Animal and human communication is looked at in a wider, evolutionary
perspective in Anderson (2004), Hauser (1996, 2000). In addition to
the books referenced in the course of Chapter 2, the Web contains
further information about several of the animals discussed, e.g. for
Alex (grey parrot), see http://alexfoundation.org/alex.htm, for Washoe,
Loulis, and other chimps, see www.friendsofwashoe.org/.
Wallman (1992) provides an overview of earlier ape-language
projects, which includes other famous animals, such as Sarah (a chimp),
Koko (a gorilla) and Chantek (an orang-utan) whose achievements
have been omitted here due to lack of space.
The linguistic abilities of children and chimps are compared in
Greenﬁeld and Savage-Rumbaugh (1993) and Savage-Rumbaugh et
al. (1993). For further discussion, see Rumbaugh and Washburn (2004),
Savage-Rumbaugh et al. (1998) and Shanker et al. (1999).
Chapter 3
This chapter took its inspiration from Lenneberg’s pioneering (1967)
work, which is still worth reading, though certain sections are now
out of date.
Springer and Deutsch (1998), Greenﬁeld (1997) and Firlik (2006)
are brief readable introductions to the brain as a whole. Cotterill (1998)
ranges more widely.
Obler and Gjerlow (1999) is a user-friendly discussion of language
in the brain, Hugdahl and Davidson (2003) and also Pulvermüller
(2002) provide more detailed accounts.

Further reading

Deacon (1997) looks at brain evolution, and discusses differences
between the brains of humans and other primates. Müller (1996)
discusses linguistic specializations within the brain, and how they come
about. Kempen (2000) discusses a recent controversy.
Techniques for studying the brain are outlined in Blumstein (1995),
Posner and Raichle (1994) and Raichle (1994).
Chapter 4
The early part of this chapter is based on Lenneberg (1967), who is
now regarded as an insightful pioneer.
The section on the stages of child language is based on Brown
(1973) which contains a comprehensive summary of his own work
with the ‘Harvard children’, Adam, Eve and Sarah, in the early stages
of language acquisition. Lust and Foley (2004) also contains some key
articles about these children. For further information on child language,
see the reading suggestions for Chapter 6.
Scovel (1988) and Newport (1991) discuss the ‘critical period’ issue.
The Nicaraguan language project is reported in Kegl (1994), Senghas
(1994) and Kegl et al. (1999).
Chapter 5
This chapter is based on Chomsky (1965) for his ‘classical’ transfor-
mational grammar, and Chomsky (1986) for his later views. His more
recent ideas are taken from Chomsky (1995a, 1995b, 2000, 2002).
McGilvray (2005) contains a variety of views in a book assessing
Chomsky’s legacy. Tomasello’s views are from Tomasello (2003).
Chapter 6
Numerous books now exist on child language: O’Grady (2005) is a
concise introduction, and Chiat (2000) outlines problems which may
arise.
A number of useful books of readings are available. See Berko-
Gleason (1993), Bloom (1994), Fletcher and MacWhinney (1995) and
especially Lust and Foley (2004).
Boysson-Bardies (1999) explores the early stages of speech; Jusczyk
(1997) looks at the capacity for speech perception; Vihman (1996)
discusses the overlap of babbling with speech; Hirsch-Pasek and
Golinkoff (1996) explore early language comprehension; Barrett (1985)
analyses one-word utterances.

Brown (1973) and Braine (1976) are ‘classics’ on the beginnings of
syntax; Bloom (1991) summarizes her earlier work with Kathryn, Eric
and Gia.
O’Grady (1997) explores syntactic development in general.
Past tenses and learning network (connectionist) approaches to them
are discussed in Pinker and Prince (1988), Marcus et al. (1992), Kim
et al. (1994), Plunkett (1995) and Elman et al. (1996). Shirai and
Andersen (1995) present an alternative account. Bybee (1995) compares
various views.
Vocabulary learning is not dealt with in this book: Aitchison (2003a)
outlines what is involved. More extensive coverage can be found in
Anglin (1993), Clark (1993), Gleitman and Landau (1994) and Bloom
(2000).
Chapter 7
The books of readings suggested for Chapter 6 also contain work
relevant to this chapter.
Cognitive development in general and its relation to language is
outlined in McShane (1991) and Gopnik et al. (1999).
Of the linguistic ‘savants’, Laura (Marta) is discussed in Yamada
(1988, 1990), Christopher in Smith and Tsimpli (1995), and Kate in
Dowker et al. (1996). Children with exceptional linguistic ability in
general are dealt with in Boucher (1998) and Rondal (1994).
Child-directed speech is examined in Gallaway and Richards (1994),
which views itself as a sequel to the widely read earlier work by Snow
and Ferguson (1977). On language understanding, see Bishop (1997).
The ‘bootstrapping’ question is explored in Pinker (1989). Comments
on his views and further work on the topic are found widely, e.g.
Baker (1992), Braine (1992, 1994), Tomasello (1992) and Lieven and
Pine (1995).
Slobin (1986a, 1986b, 1986c, 1992, 1997a, 1997b) documents the
acquisition of a wide range of languages.
Methods of analysing children’s language are discussed in Bennett-
Kastor (1988) and McDaniel et al. (1996).

Chapter 9
Fodor, Bever and Garrett (1974) is now outdated, but provides a
reliable account of much early work on the attempts by psycholinguists
to test the plausibility of a transformational grammar. Watt (1970) was
the ﬁrst person to propose the archival nature of a classic transfor-
mational grammar.
Chapter 10
Altmann and Shillcock (1993) Berko-Gleason and Bernstein-Ratner
(1998), McQueen (2004), and Miller and Eimas (1995) are books of
readings which contain information on a range of comprehension
issues. Altmann (1997), Harley (2001), Jackendoff (2002) and Pinker
(1994) deal readably with some controversial topics.
Handel (1989) discusses how humans deal with sound in general.
Nygaard and Pisoni (1995) give an outline of speech perception.
Tanenhaus and Trueswell (1995) provide a historical overview of
the changing views on sentence comprehension over the last quarter
century. Bever (1970) was the original ‘classic’ paper on perceptual
strategies; Frazier and Clifton (1996) provide an updated view of syntactic
strategies. Tanenhaus et al. (1993) discuss the integration of lexical and
grammatical information.
Comprehending words is dealt with more fully in Aitchison (2003a).
Further information on the lexicon is available in Bard and Shillcock
(1993), Cutler (1995) and Marslen-Wilson (1989, 1993). Seidenberg
(1995) examines visual word recognition.
The relationship between perception and production is explored in
Cutler (2005).
Chapter 11
Levelt (1989) presents a wide-ranging overview of speech production.
Bock (1995), Fowler (1995) and Harley (2001) also provide overviews.
Boomer and Laver (1968) was the ‘classic’ article that started serious
work on ‘slips of the tongue’. It is reprinted in Fromkin (1973) and
Laver (1991). The slips of the tongue in this chapter are mainly from
my own collection, supplemented by examples from Fromkin (1973,
1980) and Cutler (1982). Dell (1995) and Dell et al. (1993) discuss
tongue slips and speech production within a connectionist framework.
On the lexicon, see Aitchison (2003a), Levelt (1993), Levelt et al.
(1999), Marslen-Wilson (1989) and Miller (1991).

Gathercole and Baddeley (1993) explore the role of short term
memory. Caplan (1987) looks at aphasia. Shenk (2001/2002) is a highly
readable introduction to Alzheimer’s disease.
Chapter 12
Altmann (1997) provides a non-technical introduction to connec-
tionism. Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) and McClelland and
Rumelhart (1986) are early ‘classics’ on the topic. See also McClelland
(1988) for a brief overview of this approach.
References have been provided in the text for other future prospects
in psycholinguistics.
