About the Author

INTRODUCTION
My journey to natural beauty has been a long one. However, I wouldn’t have it
any other way. Over the years, I’ve learned so much and debunked many
detrimental myths. I think many of us are in the same boat, reading beauty
magazines then spending gobs of money on products that don’t really work or
benefit us in any way.
Now, at 35, I realize that beauty goes hand in hand with mind, body, and spirit.
That’s why, when I decided to write this book, I wanted to include how natural
bath salt soaks affect our overall health.
Let’s go back to the beginning. At 19, I was your typical teenager eating fast
food, barely working out, and basically doing nothing to improve my overall
health. Soon after starting my freshman year of college, I had to drop out after
getting sick and being bedridden for over a month. My cholesterol was charted at
270! My doctor could not figure out what was wrong with me, but today I can
tell you that my body just gave up on me because I treated it so badly. I had no
idea my illness was due to a poor diet, because I hadn’t gained any weight. At
that young age, I thought I was somehow immune to severe illnesses and could
live my life without consequences. Before getting sick, I wasn’t paying attention
to my body’s warning signs: bad skin, fatigue, and catching colds frequently.
It wasn’t until I was 27 that I truly became serious about health and natural
beauty. I had begun to eat healthier than I had when I was a teenager; however, I
still didn’t understand what being healthy really meant. I still drank and ate fast
food on a semi-regular basis. A drugstore beauty junkie, I was always on the
lookout for the next best product that could fix my skin. By my mid-twenties,
my acne was gone, but my skin was either very oily or very dry, never balanced.
I spent way too much money on products, hoping I could find one I could stick
with in the long run that actually lived up to its advertised potential. It never
happened.

Then one day, and I can’t remember why I did this, I began to look at the
ingredients on the back of the bottle. The thought crossed my mind that all of
those incomprehensible technical terms couldn’t be good for my skin. It was a
gut reaction to do a little research.
This was back in 2007, when there wasn’t much on the Internet except for the
Environmental Working Group’s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database, a site
dedicated to safe beauty products. And there definitely wasn’t a homemade
natural beauty movement like there is today. But what I did find in my research
is that next to no regulations exist in regard to the ingredients used in beauty
products in the United States. And that scared me.
Almost immediately, I decided to ditch my constant search for the magical
drugstore product and look into pure natural ingredients from nature. I think
there had always been a side to me that wanted to look toward what Mother
Earth provides, but before 2007, I would always get sidetracked along the way,
distracted by marketing and wanting to fit in. Now my gut was telling me it was
time to take the plunge.
The first thing I started was to wash my face with honey. I had read in various
places that honey has been used as a beauty product since ancient times, and that
it is antiviral and antibacterial, yet extremely gentle. I tried it and it worked!
After that, I dove deeper into natural beauty and eventually made my own beauty
products. I noticed that my skin began to balance itself out. Now, I can look back
and see that it’s no coincidence this happened. In addition to completely
converting to organic beauty ingredients, I became obsessed with eating as
naturally as possible and trying to live an overall healthy lifestyle. Today, I’m a
million light-years away from how I lived my life as a teenager, or even in my
early 20s. I look better at 35 than I did at 19, and I feel a gazillion times better
too.
You may be wondering what this has to do with bath salt soaks. Well, to me it
all goes hand in hand. Bath salt soaks are a way to cherish your body. It’s almost
a sacred practice. When you treat your body as a temple, it will reward you,
hands down. Our bodies work extremely hard for us, and relaxing in a natural
bath salt soak is a way of giving back.
In this book you will find personalized recipes catered to you and what your

body needs physically, emotionally, and mentally. The “Ailments” chapter (page
16) features bath recipes to help relieve everything from flu symptoms to sore
muscles. “Skin and Beauty” (page 45) is broken up into baths according to skin
types and problem areas, as well as antiaging soaks. Then we’ll focus on
meditative baths (page 60), baths to open your chakras (page 68), baths based on
your astrology sign (page 76), and aphrodisiac baths (page 89). “Bath Recipes
for Pregnancy” (page 92), “Bath Blends for Him” (page 95), “Seasonal Baths”
(page 99), “Floral Baths” (page 111), and “Baths from Around the World” (page
117) follow.
While you soak delightedly in one of these handcrafted recipes, remember that
you’re not only easing your muscles and pampering your skin, but allowing your
mind to relax and flow in meditation, something that we truly need in today’s
busy age. I hope you find this helpful in your daily life to keep you grounded,
relaxed, content, and happy.

CHAPTER 1
THE BENEFITS OF BATH SALTS
In this book, we will uncover the various reasons for taking baths, from healing
and relaxation to beautifying and enjoyment. While we cover a lot of ground, a
common theme with every recipe is to promote feeling better in some way or
another.
These recipes are one part of a bigger equation. I truly believe that in order to
feel our best, we must be balanced in all parts of our lives. Our lifestyles, from
the way we eat to our mental attitude, combined with healing rituals like bathing,
lead to the results we seek. A healing bath with salts and essential oils is one
more piece to completing the puzzle of well-being.
One thing that I’ve learned is the power of intention. I was already studying how
intention works (and watching it work magic in my own life) when I read in
Patricia Davis’s book, Subtle Aromatherapy, about the use of intention when
using essential oils. I truly believe setting an intention, especially when it comes
to healing, is very powerful.
So, what is the best way to take a bath? It may seem like a funny question, but
there is an art to getting the most out of your healing bath. Luckily, it’s very
simple.
Take your bath at a time when you won’t be bothered. There is almost nothing
more enjoyable than a luxurious bath at the end of a stressful day. Dim the lights
and light a candle. Take the bath in silence or with music that speaks to you.
Draw a medium-hot bath and fill the tub, then add your salt soak or bath bomb.
Once you’re comfortable in the bath, close your eyes and set your intention
(details on page 60). Be grateful that you have the luxury of taking a healing
bath. Then relax and let the salts and oils do their magic.
Baths Promote Well-Being

Throughout history, salt soaks have been used as a way to heal. Starting in
Ancient China and then spreading west to Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome,
bath salts have been used not only to heal ailments, but also to stay and look
youthful. There have even been recent studies that show Dead Sea salts are
beneficial in reducing wrinkles.
Because of the high density of minerals in bath salts, such as bromide, calcium,
magnesium, potassium, and sodium, soaking in them detoxifies your body while
softening and plumping up your skin. Salt soaks have been proven to reduce
common skin conditions such as itching, psoriasis, and eczema. Another major
benefit of salt soaks is easing sore muscles and tendinitis.
The relaxation of soaking in a tub of hot water and salts reduces stress, which is
linked to most diseases and ailments, including the skin conditions listed above.
When we are stressed, the immune system is lowered in order for the body to
deal with the stress. In other words, we go into fight-or-flight mode, which cuts
off our ability to heal ourselves.
These days, stress is a massive part of daily life. Even little things can set it off:
checking email, traffic, and everyday busyness. Most of us live in a state of
being overwhelmed, especially with the constant use of technology. I’d go as far
as to say that in some ways, we are addicted to the feeling of being in fight-or-
flight mode. The constant need to be in the know, to be connected, and to be
updated leaves us feeling completely exhausted. In fact, there is an actual term
for this: adrenal fatigue.
We all deal with adrenal fatigue, whether it is stress from work or the excitement
and enthusiasm behind new projects. Adrenal fatigue is not something that
should be taken lightly. It ages us and leaves us susceptible to disease. Reducing
adrenal overload depends on how we react to the stressors of daily life. Habits
we create, such as good nutrition and exercise are key, but meditation is just as
important when it comes to overall health. We can’t go full throttle all the time.
There need to be moments throughout the day where we can turn it off. Slowing
things down, being in the moment, and being grounded has done wonders for
reducing my own adrenal fatigue. However, this habit takes practice and isn’t
accomplished overnight.
With a meditative bath (page 60), you can ease your mind and just be, and that is

very powerful. Think back to when you had your last relaxing bath. How did you
feel before you got in? What was on your mind? Were you stressed thinking
about all of the things you needed to do or didn’t get done that day? Now how
did you feel when you got out? I bet you felt completely at ease and were no
longer thinking about your to-do list. The benefits of bath soaks would have
worked their magic, and your body would have thanked you for the healing and
rejuvenation.
My frame of mind is to treat your body as a temple every day. Healing baths are
special, and yes, they feel like a luxury. Baths alone, without an emphasis on
well-being through nutrition and lifestyle, are not nearly as powerful. I urge you
to use this book as either an addition to your healthy lifestyle or a starting point
for an overall balanced way of life. Trust me, it works!
To help make bath salt soaks a regular part of your routine, here are four
categories of salts used in the recipes of this book, along with their cleansing
qualities:
Coarse Sea Salts Sea salts have been used for thousands of years for
therapeutic baths. Filled with minerals, these salts are used to detoxify the skin
and increase circulation while leaving skin soft. Sea salts can come in either fine
or coarse grinds. I added coarse sea salts in recipes throughout the books for
more texture; however, feel free to switch them out for the fine grind if you
prefer.
Dead Sea Salts Dead Sea salts come directly from the Dead Sea and have a
higher salt content than other salts. They are abundant with minerals as well. The
healing properties of Dead Sea salts reduce insomnia and anxiety, soothe the
skin, relieve muscle ailments, regulate water retention, and detoxify the skin,
along with many other therapeutic benefits.
Himalayan Salts With over 84 minerals, Himalayan salts are among the purest
around, known for their beautifying benefits such as combating dry skin, skin
ailments, and aging. They also contain some of the same benefits as Dead Sea
salts, such as regulating water retention, reducing sleep disorders, and calming
nerves.
Epsom Salts Containing mainly magnesium sulfate, Epsom salts are known for

easing muscle soreness and joint pain. Their cleansing properties combat oily
skin. If you’re on a budget, switch the Dead Sea or Himalayan varieties for
Epsom salts, the most reasonably priced of the three.

CHAPTER 2
THE BENEFITS OF ESSENTIAL OILS
Essential oils are magical. Their scents and properties link us back to what
Mother Earth intended to nurture us with: plants. As you make the recipes in this
book, you’ll find each oil and its corresponding scent evokes something
different. This could be memories, feelings, or a sense of well-being.
One of the most enjoyable aspects of creating these recipes was coming up with
combinations based on the scents I was drawn to and figuring out what they
reminded me of. Benzoin is like warm chocolate. Bergamot is a walk through
Rome. Eucalyptus feels like clarity and rejuvenation. Rose is romance. Jasmine
is femininity. The list goes on and on.
As a self-declared health nut, learning about different properties of essential oils
and which work well for certain ailments is fascinating. I love learning about
home remedies and ways to heal myself.
As with bath salts, essential oils are more powerful when combined with a
healthy lifestyle. That’s when the real transformation begins and you will find
that a little bit of these special oils goes a long way.
When it comes to buying oils, use discretion. Many companies sell low-quality,
diluted oils. Be picky. There is no point spending money on oil that doesn’t
contain the properties you’re looking for. I bought most of my oils from
Mountain Rose Herbs at MountainRoseHerbs.com. I absolutely love this
company and have been using them for years. Buy organic if you can; however,
not all oils are available organic. If that is the case, be sure to buy pesticide-free
or wild-grown oils. All oils at Mountain Rose Herbs are pesticide-free, even if
they’re not organic.
Baths are almost the perfect way to utilize the benefits of essential oils,
especially when combined with salts. The salts ease sore muscles, soften the

skin, and detoxify, while each essential oil has different healing properties for
specific ailments, skin issues, and even emotional stress, as you will see in the
following chapters.

Take Precautions
Essential oils are very strong and powerful. Pregnant women should check
with their doctor before using essential oils because some can be quite
dangerous. That also goes for babies, children, and the elderly. For any of
these age groups, the amount of oils in these recipes should be cut in half to
be on the safe side.
Here is a list of essential oils that are okay to use during pregnancy:
• Neroli • Mandarin • Rose (after the first trimester) • Lavender (after
the first trimester) • Roman Chamomile (after the first trimester)

CHAPTER 3
ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS
In addition to salts and essential oils, there are some other ingredients that are
needed mainly for making salt scrubs, salt soaks, and bath bombs.

Carrier Oils
Organic vegetable carrier oils are a must-have for any homemade skincare
regimen. In this book they are used mainly for salt scrubs, but I also love to use
them instead of lotion after a bath or shower. Store in a dark, cool, and dry area
when not in use.
Almond Oil Almond oil is a great base for salt scrubs because of its sweet
smell and lighter consistency. It is commonly used in beauty products because of
its ability to moisturize skin.
Avocado Oil Avocado oil is perfect for those with dry or mature skin because
of its extremely rich consistency and blend of vitamins.
Coconut Oil One of the most widely used oils today for beauty products and
cooking, coconut oil is extremely rich with a light coconut scent. One of my go-
to oils for everyday use.
Jojoba Oil This is a great oil for those with acne and oily skin because of its
light and easily absorbable consistency.
Kukui Nut Oil The kukui nut, hailing from the Hawaiian islands, creates a
luxurious and rich oil that easily absorbs into the skin.
Olive Oil Olive oil is one of the most widely used oils for skincare products
because of its moisturizing ability.
Rosehip Oil Considered one of the best carrier oils for antiaging, rosehip oil is
used for reducing wrinkles and scars. Rosehip seed oil is rich in essential fatty
acids yet very easily absorbed into the skin.
Sesame Oil An all-around versatile oil used in cooking and skincare products,
sesame oil is rich and moisturizing. It is widely used in Ayurveda for its
antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.
Sunflower Oil Great oil for beauty products because of its vitamin A, D, and E
content and rich consistency, sunflower oil also has next to no scent, perfect for
mixing with essential oils.

Clays
Clays are used in salt soaks to draw out impurities and soften the skin. They’re
great for all skin types, but those who are oily or acne-prone may benefit the
most since the clays soak up excessive oil from the skin. I purchase my clays
from Mountain Rose Herbs, although they’re rather easy to find online from
other vendors as well.
French Green Clay French green clay tones and revitalizes skin by drawing
out impurities and tightening pores.
Fuller’s Earth Clay This is considered the best clay for oily and acne-prone
skin because of its oil-drawing capabilities.
Rhassoul Clay This Moroccan clay is filled with minerals such as calcium,
iron, magnesium, and potassium.

Additional Ingredients
Both baking soda and citric acid are must-have ingredients for bath bombs.
Baking Soda This is used in bath bombs for its cleansing and deodorizing
properties.
Citric Acid Found mainly in lemons and limes, citric acid is used in bath
bombs to create the fizzing effect.

CHAPTER 4
HOW TO MAKE THEM
The best things are the simplest things, especially when it comes to health and
beauty. In this book you will find an array of recipes for salts soaks, salt scrubs,
and bath bombs. Making these simple creations brings together all aspects of our
life: health, beauty, love, travel, and spirituality.
Salt Soaks
Salt soaks are a simple way to give your body the extra love and attention it
needs. Salt soaks are a combination of salt, essential oils, and sometimes
beautifying and detoxifying clays. They are extremely therapeutic and can be
used to heal a number of different ailments or skin issues. They are probably
best known as being used for relaxation after a long day or used to reduce stress.
As you will see with the array of different types of salt soaks, their uses are
almost endless.
SUPPLIES
• Mixing bowl • Measuring cups • Measuring spoons • 26-ounce to 32-
ounce glass jar for storage (depending on recipe) • Whisk (optional)
STORAGE
As far as storing the bath salts, it’s entirely up to you to decide how fancy you
would like to get. I do recommend storing the salts in a glass container or jar.
Glass mason jars work great, plus their pricing is extremely reasonable. You can
find more decorative jars at a local craft store or my favorite place to buy most
of my online ingredients, Mountain Rose Herbs.

Sterilize Your Storage Jar Be sure to always sterilize any jar or
container you use for a homemade beauty recipe. The process is
very easy. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and then let the
glass jar or container simmer in the boiling water for about five
minutes. Remove and place on a clean towel to dry and cool off.
This will ensure that you’re putting your salt soak into a clean
container and will help it stay fresh longer.
DIRECTIONS
For all the salt soak recipes in this book, follow these directions. You’ll find that
creating different salt soaks is just a matter of switching up the ingredients for
the desired outcome.
1. Measure out and add the dry ingredients to a mixing bowl.
2. Mix your dry ingredients with clean hands or a whisk if you prefer.
3. Add oils and mix again.
4. Pour mixture (you may want to use a spoon for this) into a jar.
5. Store in a cool, dry, and dark area when not in use.
Salt Scrubs
Salt scrubs are mainly used to remove dead and dry skin. You will find your skin
literally glowing after using them! They are also great for reenergizing and leave
you feeling invigorated. You can use salt scrubs in a shower or before soaking in
a bath.
SUPPLIES
• Measuring cups • Measuring spoons • Small spoon for mixing • 250-ml
mason jar for storage
STORAGE

STORAGE
I usually use smaller mason jars for scrubs. Scrubs can last up to a month or so,
but longer than that is not recommended. Vitamin E oil can be added to the
recipes as a preservative.
DIRECTIONS
As with the salt soaks, making a scrub is one of the easiest things you will ever
do. So worth the reward it hardly seems possible that something this simple
works wonders when it comes to your overall health and beauty. Scrubs will
leave your skin glowing and help reduce stress, vital for overall wellness.
Follow this set of directions for all of the salt scrub recipes, switching out the
ingredients depending on the recipe.
1. Sterilize your storage jar (page 13).
2. After the jar has dried and cooled, add salt to the jar.
3. Add vegetable/nut carrier oil and mix.
4. Add essential oils and mix thoroughly.
5. Store in a dark, cool, and dry area when not in use.
Bath Bombs
Unlike salt soaks, bath bombs are actually dry, molded mixtures of salts, clays,
baking soda, citric acid, and essential oils that fizz when you drop them in water.
Here is where we get scientific. Where measuring for salt soaks and scrubs is not
exactly crucial, it is for bath bombs. It took me some experimenting to get my
first bath bombs to work, but then they were buzzing and fizzing like no other. It
was really exciting! These make great gifts, as there’s something really playful
about them. They also have similar benefits to salt soaks. They’re extremely
relaxing after the fizzing has subsided; many are included as alternative options
to the soaks in this book.
Because these are natural bath bombs, there is no added food coloring in these

recipes. If you’re trying to switch over to natural beauty, the last thing you want
to do is soak in a bath full of toxins. So instead, I added floral powders to some
of the recipes for coloring. These powders also contain benefits similar to
essential oils.
SUPPLIES
• Mold for bath bomb (molds can be found on Amazon, eBay, and Etsy, or
use a cookie mold from your local kitchen supply) • Two bowls • Whisk
STORAGE
As far as storage goes, the same mason jars you would use for the salt soaks
work well. Choose a larger size for the bath bombs.
DIRECTIONS
For all of the bath bomb recipes in this book, follow this set of directions and
switch out the ingredients depending on the recipe.
1. Mix dry ingredients together.
2. In a separate bowl, mix water, coconut or carrier oil, and essential oil.
3. Pour the liquid a little bit at a time into the dry ingredients and mix.
4. After the mixture begins to clump together, fill the mold as much as
possible, as this will help hold it together. (You may not need to use all of
the liquid if the mixture is already clumping.) 5. Once the mold is formed,
just tap out the bath bomb and let it dry for 12 to 24 hours (avoid leaving it
in a room with humidity).

CHAPTER 5
AILMENTS
Soaking in a bath can help you forget about your aches and pains. Many of these
ailments are caused by stress, for which an aromatherapy salt soak is the perfect
medicine. Reduce stress and you reduce the likelihood for disease.
In this section you may find two to three recipes for one ailment. This is because
there is a wider variety of essential oils that have healing properties for that
particular ailment. I grouped the essential oils in each recipe based on how well
the scents went together, but feel free to mix and match to your choosing.
Also, be sure to switch out essential oils every three weeks or so. Using the same
essential oil every day can be toxic for your body. For those ailments that only
have one recipe, take some time off between baths or take a relaxing bath with
different essential oils in between.
For more information about using essential oils to combat ailments, I highly
recommend the book Aromatherapy: An A-Z by Patricia Davis. Packed with
great detailed information, it’s my go-to handbook for any time I’m feeling
under the weather.

CHAPTER 7
MEDITATIVE BATHS
Later in this chapter, I will introduce the concept of setting intentions with
healing baths (page 60). A meditative bath is the perfect place for this. While the
other sections in this book are more focused on healing specific mental,
emotional, or physical ailments, this section is more inspirational and intuitive,
with blends designed to take you to a calm state where you can let go of your
thoughts and be in the moment.
Practicing meditation every day can make you feel more grounded and happier
overall. These meditative baths aren’t meant to replace your everyday meditation
practice if you have one, but they are a delightful addition to it.
These recipes are a guide for grouping scents in a manner that stimulates your
creativity. They might remind you of something you’d like to focus on in your
meditation. Either way, this is your chance to be inspired; use your intuition as to
which scents speak to you and connect to your intention.
How to Set an Intention for Your Bath
If you’re familiar with meditation or yoga, you may already be aware of setting
intentions before settling into your meditative state. For those of you who have
never done this before, don’t fret, it’s very easy!
First, draw the bath, toss in the salt soak or bath bomb, dim the lights and light
candles, or do whatever it is you need to do to create a peaceful setting for the
bath. After everything is set up and you’re settled in the tub, start your
meditative bath by taking a couple of deep belly breaths. Breathe in through your
nose down into your tummy and then breathe out through your nose or mouth.
This does two things. First, it relaxes you. Second, breathing in the scents of the
essential oils will evoke a certain feeling depending on which ones you are
using. While you are doing this, set an intention for the bath in your mind. It

could be one word or a phrase. For instance, if I’m feeling anxious for some
reason, I may choose for my intention the word “acceptance” or “letting go” to
bring me to a calmer state and reduce anxiety. Or, if I’m feeling pretty content,
then I may choose “gratefulness” as my intention. You see, how you set your
intention is completely up to you, and it could literally be anything. I would just
recommend listening to your intuition to see if there’s anything that is bothering
you, something you may need to let go of, or something you would like to focus
on.
Once you state your intention in your mind, focus on it for a deep breath or two,
then let it go and clear your mind. Continue to focus on breathing to stay in the
present, leaving you in a peaceful and meditative state.

Salt Soaks
When I think of meditative baths, the first thing that comes to mind is a deeply
relaxing salt soak with essential oils that set a certain tone or mood.

Patchouli Deep Relaxation Salt Soak
This can be used as a grounding meditation to release anxiety. The combination
of patchouli, sweet marjoram, and carrot seed create a deep resonating scent for
extreme relaxation and letting go.

extremely relaxing, especially before a bath. Scrub first, then deep meditative
relaxation.

CHAPTER 8
CHAKRAS
The subject of chakras is complex and fascinating. There are seven main chakras
in our bodies, each connected to different organs and each aligned along the
spine. Every chakra is an energy center representing different areas in our life.
The word chakra means “wheel” in Sanskrit, which is basically how the energy
moves within each chakra. Since chakras are energy vortexes, when we feel low
energy or off it can mean one or more of our chakras are imbalanced. The
essential oils associated with the baths below are meant to restore each chakra
back to balance. I’ve also found that setting intentions (page 60) work well here
too.
Educating yourself about chakras will help you identify where you may be
feeling blocks or imbalances in your life. We’re only able to touch on the basics
of each chakra in this book, but three books that I highly recommend if you want
to learn more are The Chakra Bible by Patricia Mercier, Chakras for Beginners
by David Pond, and Subtle Aromatherapy by Patricia Davis.

The Base Chakra
The base chakra is located at the root of the spine and is the color red. It
represents our basic necessities such as food, sex, shelter, and security. When
your base chakra is unbalanced you may feel physically fatigued or spacey or
experience sexual dysfunction from suppression or lust. Other symptoms include
overeating and feeling the need to hoard material things such as money. Those
with balanced base chakras will feel a deep connection with the earth.

Base Chakra Salt Soak

1 cup of Epsom salts
1/2 cup of baking soda

Scrub

3 tablespoons of citric acid
2 tablespoons of baking soda
2 tablespoons of cornstarch
2 tablespoons of Epsom salts
1 tablespoon of water
1/4 tablespoon of coconut oil
10 drops of rosewood essential oil

The Sacral Chakra
The sacral chakra is located at the sacrum and is the color orange. It represents
our sexual energy. When your sacral chakra is unbalanced you may feel a lack of
sexual energy, anger or fear in romantic relationships, jealousy, and empty
sexual encounters. Balanced sacral chakras will feel fulfilled sexual energy,
creativity, joy, unconditional love, and deep connections with others.

Sacral Chakra Salt Soak

1 cup of Himalayan salts
1/2 cup of baking soda
1 cup of French green clay

The Solar Plexus Chakra
The solar plexus chakra is located between the navel and sternum, and is the
color yellow. It represents our personal identity, power, and self-acceptance.
When your solar plexus chakra is out of balance you may experience anger,
competitiveness, conflicts, feelings of guilt or shame due to others’ expectations,
and negative reactions to stress. When balanced, the solar plexus gives us self-
assertiveness, discipline, willpower, and the ability to create healthy boundaries
and express our individuality.

The Heart Chakra
The heart chakra is located in the heart and is the color green. It represents love
of nature, creation, and the world around us. When unbalanced you may
experience codependency, attachment, insecurity, or suffering in love. When
balanced the heart chakra creates unconditional love and acceptance.

The Throat Chakra
The throat chakra is located at the throat and is the color blue. It represents the
transition from the physical body to the spiritual realm, as well as our
communication with the world. When the throat chakra is unbalanced you may
experience difficulties in communicating, defensiveness, anxiety, depression,
and the need to seek approval. When balanced, the throat chakra allows you to
be authentic and creative in your communication and self-expression.

The Brow Chakra
The brow chakra is located in the forehead and is the color indigo. It represents
emotional clarity and intuition. When your brow chakra is out of balance, you
may experience headaches, sleep disorders, fear, addiction to drugs and alcohol,
and excessive fantasizing. When the brow chakra is balanced it stimulates
creative visualization, transcendence, intuition, and the ability to reach higher
realms.

The Crown Chakra
The crown chakra is located at the top of the head and is the color violet. It
represents pure consciousness. When the crown chakra is unbalanced, the ego
dominates and directs your life instead of surrendering to the magic of flow.
When balanced you experience full awareness, as well as the ability to meditate
and surrender to your spirituality.

CHAPTER 9
ASTROLOGY
To many people, astrology is nothing more than your monthly horoscope. But it
is so much more than that! I recently had my natal chart done and was shocked
at not only how accurate it was, but also how it answered questions about myself
that I’ve had all my life. And lo and behold, there are essential oils associated
with each sign and planet! Astrology can become pretty complicated, so if you
can, I recommend having your natal chart done by an astrologist.
For now we’ll just stick with talking about the sun signs, which most everyone is
familiar with. You can find your sun sign simply by the date of your birth. Each
sign has plants or essential oils that can help restore them back to their true
states. There are a few recipes for each sign, based on corresponding
personalities and tendencies, as well as positive and negative traits. These
recipes are meant to keep each sign balanced.

Aries
(March 21 to April 19)
Aries (the ram) is the feisty, determined go-getter and leader. As innovative
pioneers, rams love to start projects and thrive on living in the moment. Because
they are very physical and athletic beings, they tend to overexhaust themselves
and need to be both restored and soothed.

Taurus
(April 20 to May 20)
Taurus (the bull) loves luxury and the sensual things in life: delicious food, good
sex, and owning nice material things. On the other hand, Taurus signs are
extremely hard workers. Maybe it’s because of this that the bull seems to
overindulge in their delights. A little cleanse now and then is key.

their constant need for communication and feeding their mind, anxiety and
insomnia can often plague them.

Aquarius
(January 20 to February 18)
The Aquarius (the water bearer) is the eccentric, forward-thinking humanitarian
of the zodiac. Water bearers are offbeat, individualistic, and sometimes
unpredictable. Aloof and nonconformist, at extremes Aquarians can sometimes
turn negative and reclusive when things don’t go their way.

Aquarius Meditating Salt Soak

1 cup of Epsom salts
1/2 cup of baking soda

Pisces
(February 19 to March 20)
Pisces (the fish) are dreamy, creative, and deeply emotional souls. They are
artistic and intuitive, relying more on their feelings than other signs. Sensitive,
they can sometimes stay in their fantasy world instead of dealing with reality.
They also are big givers and lovers, yet because of this they have a tendency to
be self-sacrificing.

Pisces Centering Salt Soak
2 cups of Dead Sea salts
1 cup of Epsom salts
1/2 cup of baking soda
5 drops of melissa essential oil 5 drops of rose essential oil

CHAPTER 10
APHRODISIAC BATHS
I couldn’t write a book about bath salt soaks without including a section on
aphrodisiac soaks. Sex, whether we like it or not, plays a huge role in our lives.
Sadly, there are so many negative connotations to sex. Growing up, many of us
we’re taught that sex is essentially bad by focusing on all the negative
consequences that can come from it. And while those consequences may be true,
sex can also be a very beautiful experience. Mother earth can enhance that
experience…with aphrodisiac scents. It doesn’t matter where you are in your
life. Whether you’re in a relationship or not, these particular soaks are about
allowing you to be you and to feel good about who you are.

Rose
Rose might be the scent most often associated with love and sex. The scent of
the heart chakra, it appeals to both women and men and seems to get people in
the mood. It is a very gentle scent, evoking feelings of acceptance and love
rather than lust.

Rose Salt Soak
1 cup of dried rose petals
2 cups of Dead Sea salts
2 cups of Himalayan salts
1/2 cup of baking soda
1 cup of French green clay
10 drops of rose essential oil

Jasmine
Jasmine is rose’s exotic sister scent. They are both very feminine, but jasmine
always conjures feelings of the East. I love the smell of jasmine. It’s considered
the ultimate aphrodisiac oil, along with rose. Very delicate, it puts one at ease,
almost like a good glass of wine.

Delicate Jasmine Salt Soak
1/2 cup of dried jasmine flowers 2 cups of Himalayan salts
1 cup of coarse sea salts
1/2 cup of baking soda
1 cup of rhassoul clay
10 drops of jasmine essential oil

Patchouli
Patchouli gets a bad rap. Ask around and you’ll find that most people in the Gen
X and millennial generations associate patchouli as a pungent oil that Dad used
to wear back in the ’60s and ’70s. Or that it’s only for hippies. I take offense to
that! Yes, it was a popular oil among hippies and yes, it has a very strong scent,
but if people took away their preconceived notions regarding patchouli, they
would be surprised at how much they enjoyed it. It has a dark, earthy sexuality
to it. It may appeal more to men, but women can enjoy it too.

Patchouli Salt Soak
2 cups of Dead Sea salts
1 cup of coarse sea salts
1/2 cup of baking soda
10 drops of patchouli essential oil

Bergamot
Bergamot isn’t one of the more popular aphrodisiac oils, but it should be. It’s a
very romantic oil, reminiscent of Rome, an ancient city that is all about romance,
the senses, and, on an understated level, sex. It evokes the charming, romantic
side of sex—dating, candlelit dinners, and getting to know someone.

Bergamot Salt Soak
1 cup of Dead Sea salts
1 cup of Epsom salts
1 cup of coarse sea salts
1/2 cup of baking soda
10 drops of bergamot essential oil

CHAPTER 11
BATH RECIPES FOR PREGNANCY
Baths are a gentle way for pregnant women to give their bodies a well-deserved
break and take time to themselves before the baby comes. As I stated earlier in
the book, it’s important for pregnant women to be extremely careful with
essential oils, as some can be downright dangerous. For that reason, I’ve
included a few recipes that are safe for them to use. By no means are these the
only essential oils available to pregnant women, but they are the ones that are
considered safe. If you are pregnant and want to learn more about other essential
oils, I recommend booking an appointment with an aromatherapist so they can
cater specific oils to your specific needs.
These recipes are safe for pregnant women to use any time throughout their
pregnancy.

BATH BLENDS FOR HIM
Men need pampering too. Some may not like to admit it, but deep down they
can’t resist a relaxing bath, especially if it’s filled with scents that are outdoorsy
and grounding. So if you’re a man, this section is especially for you. And ladies,

CHAPTER 13
SEASONAL BATHS
Just as the seasons change, so do our needs for comfort and wellness. Baths can
be added to your wellness routine as a preventative measure against typical
seasonal ailments such as the flu, allergies, and even sunburns. Or, a relaxing
bath can be the perfect way to take advantage of the scents and serenities each
season has to offer.

Winter
The cold months make for the most rewarding bath season. Who doesn’t want to
soak in a hot tub while it’s freezing outside? Winter salt soaks are also beneficial
as a remedy for flu and cold season. In the Ailments chapter (page 16), we
covered various baths that protect against viral infections that are typical this
time of year.
Here are some additional soaks to help prevent a cold or flu from progressing.
Intoxicating scents like eucalyptus and peppermint have a warming quality.
Combining these baths with exercise and good nutrition should keep you in good
health and able to bypass the normal illnesses that seem to run rampant during
the winter. Make sure to get plenty of sleep after bathing and, most importantly,
stay warm.

Winter Flu Prevention Salt Soak

Spring
Spring baths are filled with rejuvenating floral scents of rose and jasmine and
chamomile. Check the Floral Baths chapter (page 111), for additional
quintessential spring soaks. Spring is also the time for allergies. In many
instances, allergies (or any ailment, for that matter) can be brought on by stress.
Relaxing in a bath is ideal for reducing a stress-induced allergy flare-up.
Chamomile is also beneficial for combating hay fever. You’ll find a chamomile
blend here, and more allergy-prevention soaks in the Ailments chapter (page 16).
Also, if you do have a major bout of allergies, stay clear of anything with
artificial fragrances, including perfume and candles. I had a horrible allergy
season years ago and it was due to being exposed to an array of candles that
were burning daily in a store I worked in.

Summer
Summer is my favorite time of year. I love the sun. I love going to the beach. I
love being warm. While a hot bath isn’t exactly on my mind in the summer, a
nice lukewarm bath with summer scents is always a pleasant way to end the day.
And if you do happen to get a little too much sun, a cool to lukewarm bath with
healing salts and oils will soothe your skin.

Fall
Toward the end of summer, I think most of us lust after crisp fall days, a break
from the heat, and a transition into the holiday season. What comes to mind
when I think of fall? Hot tea, warm blankets, soft sweaters, and warm spicy
scents reminiscent of November and early December.

CHAPTER 14
FLORAL BATHS
Spring and summer are the best times to utilize floral baths as the floral energies
are more aligned with these two seasons. Of course, feel free to do them any
time of year. An intoxicating rose or jasmine bath could be a great way to
combat the dreariness of winter.

Salt Soaks
These floral salt soaks are the ultimate luxury with actual flowers and petals
added. They make lovely gifts, party favors, or wedding favors as well, when
divided into small decorative muslin bags.
Note: Because there are a good amount of flowers in these soaks, it’s advisable
to put a portion of the soak in a small muslin bag and then drop it into the bath.
This way, the flowers don’t get stuck in the drain and in the tub.

Rose Salt Soak
2 cups of Dead Sea salts
2 cups of Himalayan salts

Salt Scrubs
These floral salt scrubs will make your day and bring a smile to your face. I
honestly can’t think of anything more luxurious than treating yourself to the
Rose Restoring Salt Scrub and then topping it off with the Delicate Floral Blend
Salt Soak. Plus, the carrier oils in these scrubs are very lightly scented, letting
the scents of the floral essential oils shine.

Bath Bombs
These bath bombs use minimal amounts of flowers and make adorable gifts. If
you’re concerned about cleanup, consider leaving the flowers out (the flower
powder will be fine). However, with the small amount used in each recipe, it
shouldn’t be an issue.

CHAPTER 15
BATHS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
I’ve always been fascinated by ancient cultures and how they used natural
elements for health and beauty. Now natural beauty is making a comeback, and
much of it has been derived from cultures of the past.
There’s also something very enticing about scents that evoke a sense of place.
Isn’t it amazing how you can travel across the world, and when you smell the
scent of that destination at home, it brings you suddenly back?

CONCLUSION
My hope with this book is that you use it as your go-to guide when you need a
little pick-me-up. We all have those days, don’t we? Some of my most cherished
books are the ones I’ve had for years that I always come back to when the need
calls. So if you have a little ache or pain, or just need to de-stress, hopefully this
will be your own cherished well-worn guide for years to come.
I’ve learned so much while doing research for this book, even beyond the
properties of salts, oils, and scents. The most interesting aspect I’ve found is the
effect these things have on our minds, which I’m finding more and more is the
secret to good health! That’s why baths are so powerful and healing. They not
only nurture the body directly, but put your mind at ease, allowing it to
regenerate.
While writing this book, an author who I’ve found extremely helpful in learning
about the amazing healing capacities of essential oils is Patricia Davis. I have to
thank her for the immense amount of information she provides in her books. If
you are interested in learning more on how to use essential oils for healing and
spiritual awareness, I highly Davis’s Aromatherapy: An A-Z, Subtle
Aromatherapy, and Astrological Aromatherapy.
Lastly, I truly believe this life is meant to be enjoyed. So most importantly, take
time for yourself and be kind to your body.

For my parents, who raised me to be independent and go for my dreams rather
than play it safe. Thanks for your support and guidance—it seems to be working.
