Keywords: human augmentation, human observer, biological physics, quantum physics, speed of light, information
processing
Einstein special relativity theory (SRT) suggests that (i) no signal can cause an eﬀect outside the
source light cone, the space-time surface on which light rays emanate from the source, and (ii) no
signal can move faster than light through a vacuum (Garrison et al., 1998).
There have been some claims that if information processing in the brain relies on nerve
pulse conditions alone, the conduction velocities must be relativistic or even super-luminal. This,
however, looks highly non-feasible.
Based on a rough estimation, it had been estimated that velocity of neural integration in the
cortical paths in the human brain may be close to the speed of light, i.e., to reach 2.28 ×108 ms−1
that is ∼0.76 of light speed (0.76 × c) (Ghaderi, 2015). However, equation 7 in that paper (Ghaderi,
2015) extremely over-inﬂates the numerator (and therefore the velocity) by assuming that neural
signals travel sequentially from neuron to neuron. This overestimates the path length by many
orders of magnitude.
Theoretically, if by a given selective enhancement it becomes possible to increase the velocity
of neural information transfer, i.e., to reach or exceed the speed of light; then some basic laws of
physics including the limitations imposed by the speed of light may be violated. Below, using the
most updated physiologic and neurophysiologic evidence we will show that the current physics is
still right in the view that no signal can cause an eﬀect outside the source light cone.
The brain was claimed to be partially relativistic and obey relativistic principles of general
relativity theory (GRT) (Ghaderi, 2015; Le Bihan, 2019). This sparked an enthusiasm that correction
of time perception and increasing information exchange velocity by means of selective human
augmentation technologies, may—at least in theory—increase the capacity to change the space-
time metric perception, and consequently might inﬂuence the past-future relationship in the light
cone, giving a higher perception and or conception or consciousness to human observers (Migliore
et al., 2000).
The velocity of the neural transfer is equal to the distance traveled divided by the time elapsed.
So, we should either shorten the distance (i.e., ﬁnd a shortcut path) or shorten the time elapsed.
Remember that implicit to the above-mentioned calculation (Ghaderi, 2015) is that the brain is
in a “default mode” with a given activity and information processing which is not 100% of its
maximum capacity (Mak et al., 2017; Vatansever et al., 2017), i.e., if, and only if, the activity of
cortex is increased, the velocity of information exchange and integration will theoretically increase
near to the order of speed of light levels (Ghaderi, 2015).
Studies attempting to map the connectome—the brain’s wiring diagram aiming to elucidate
the structural and functional connections of the human brain—is suggestive that due to several
opportunities including the (i) hyperbolic nature of human brain connectome, i.e., eﬀective
hyperbolic geometry in which similar neurons possibly distant in the real geometry are near to
each other (Indow, 1997; Cacciola et al., 2017; Seguin et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018; Sharpee,
2019; Allard and Serrano, 2020), such as eﬀective hyperbolic geometry in olfactory (Zhou et al.,
2018) and visual (Indow, 1997) space, which oﬀers brilliant computational opportunities to
ﬁnd shortcut paths for nanodrugs; and (ii) possibility to increase the speed of information
transfer and accurate responses through enhancement of cortex activity via pharmacological drugs
(such as Tolcapone which improves cognition and cortical information processing in normal

human subjects) (Apud et al., 2007), and (iii) myelinated
nature of nerve ﬁbers and existence of Ranvier nodes, which
allows an increased rate of action potential transmission due to
“jumping” between them, tempts us to theorize that obtaining
selective enhancement in sensory systems (visual system
acuity, temporal resolution, spatial resolution/acuity, memory
acquisition, memory reconsolidation, memory formation, or
memory remembrance) may synergically accelerate neural
integration, and information transfer velocity. However, the
point is that even such a synergism never approaches to the speed
of light (Cariani, 2001; He et al., 2014; Sole et al., 2016).
For instance, we know that myelinated axon nerve impulses
travel 100 times more rapidly than impulses in non-myelinated
axons (Kier and Tombes, 2013). However, due to the nodes of
Ranvier, nerve impulses travel as much as 300-fold faster (Kier
et al., 2015). This is substantially higher than the default mode,
but is still extremely insuﬃcient to reach the speed of light.
It has been proposed that the enhanced action potential
passage and ﬂow of information along myelinated axons through
the Ranvier node of myelinated axons is carried out via a
process of proton hopping (Kier et al., 2015). Ford et al.
(2015) reported unexpected structural specializations in the
Ranvier nodes and internodes of auditory brainstem axons
involved in sound localization. Myelination properties deviated
signiﬁcantly from the traditionally assumed structure. Axons
responding best to low-frequency sounds had a larger diameter
than high-frequency axons but, surprisingly, shorter internodes.
Simulations predicted that this geometry helps to adjust the
conduction velocity and timing of action potentials within
the circuit. Electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in
vivo conﬁrmed higher conduction velocities in low-frequency
axons. Moreover, internode length decreased and Ranvier node
diameter increased progressively along the distal axon segments,
which simulations show was essential to ensure precisely timed
depolarization of the giant calyx of Held presynaptic terminal.
Authors (Ford et al., 2015) conclude individual anatomical
parameters of myelinated axons can be tuned to optimize
pathways involved in temporal processing.
Some may use above-mentioned ﬁndings as a support for their
claim. However, even if such a possibility comes true, there is
again a huge gap to reach relativistic speeds if purely classical
communications by nerve pulses are assumed.
There
is
also
some
evidence
in
support
of
sensory enhancement:
We ﬁrst present and then brieﬂy discuss them:
1. It is said that stimulation of a given sensory modality
synergizes discrimination of another sensory modality. For
instance, visual stimuli signiﬁcantly inﬂuences auditory
loudness discrimination (Desantis et al., 2014), auditory
sensory positively inﬂuences visual temporal rate perception
(Recanzone, 2003), olfaction modulates visual perception in
a synergistic manner (Zhou et al., 2010) among others. If
quantum coherence in brain scale is possible, these eﬀects
could be due to the increase of the quantum coherence scale.
2. There
is
evidence
from
experimental
and
clinical
trials
demonstrating
the
selective
enhancing
eﬀect
of
pharmacological drugs on speciﬁc brain areas, suggestive that
that every neuron (or group of neurons) embodies diﬀerent
molecular information that hands an operational eﬀect on
neuronal computation (Erskine et al., 2004; Rose et al., 2010;
Tozzi, 2015; Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2017). For
example, in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled,
and crossover design, Apud et al. (2007) evaluated the eﬀects
of tolcapone, a central nervous system penetrant speciﬁc
catecholamine-O-methyltransferase
(COMT)
inhibitor,
on measures of cognitive function and prefrontal cortical
information processing in normal subjects stratiﬁed by
COMT (val158met) genotype. They found signiﬁcant drug
eﬀects on measures of executive function and verbal episodic
memory and a signiﬁcant drug by genotype interaction on the
latter, such that individuals with val/val genotypes improved,
whereas individuals with met/met genotypes worsened on
tolcapone. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
revealed a signiﬁcant tolcapone-induced improvement in the
eﬃciency of information processing in the prefrontal cortex
during a working memory test. Their study demonstrated
enhancement of prefrontal cortical function in normal human
subjects with a non-stimulant drug having COMT inhibitory
activity. Since participants were healthy subjects with no
family history of psychiatric disorders, with brains at a normal
default mode, this study ignited a keen interest that even
in normal subjects it is possible to signiﬁcantly increase
information processing capacity and velocity. The above
comment about quantum coherence applies here as well.
3. There is also experimental evidence that time cells respond
selectively to diﬀerent stimuli (Kraus et al., 2013; Howard et al.,
2014; Mau et al., 2018), and space cells respond selectively both
in an allocentric and egocentric manner (i.e., independent and
dependent of reference frames, respectively), in human spatial
memory (Woodin and Allport, 1998; Holmes and Sholl, 2005)
depending the situation and position. For example, in the
absence of vision, decentred egocentric condition involves a
frame of reference which seems to be neither allocentric nor
totally egocentric (Coluccia et al., 2007). These conjunctive
codes for what, when and where are analogous to neurons in
the visual system that show a conjunctive code for what, where
(Howard, 2018) (and arguably) when.
Apart from technical diﬃculties, sensory modality synergy is
highly implausible to ﬁll huge gap between the neural integration
velocity in the cortical paths and speed of light. However,
concerning the explanation of the sensory enhancement one may
propose several alternative explanations:
a) The increase in nerve pulse conduction velocity could be
partially responsible for sensory and cognitive enhancements.
Physicists would however argue that it is very implausible
that the conduction velocity could approach relativistic speeds.
Furthermore, in classical GRT it is in principle impossible to
formulate the idea about the increase of light-velocity since
there is only single space-time and no reference space-time
(Minkowski space-time) with which to compare. In GRT one can
however consider wormholes along which the distance would be
much shorter than otherwise. The problem of wormholes is that

they are not stable. They have been also proposed as correlates
of quantum entanglement (ER-EPR correspondence [ER-EPR])
(Maldacena and Susskind, 2013).
b) There is evidence that bio-photons (Bischof, 2005) are
relevant for both biology and neuroscience. Popp et al. (1988)
and Popp (2003) is one of the pioneers in the study of bio-
photons. There is evidence that bio-photon emission from plant
leaves is coherent (Bajpai, 1999) and that both DNA (Popp
et al., 1984) and cell membrane (Dotta et al., 2011) can act
as a source of bio-photons. There is also evidence that bio-
photon emission correlates with neural activity (Rahnama et al.,
2011), that bio-photon emission correlates with EEG (Sun et al.,
2010) and ﬁndings suggesting that bio-photons could act as
neural communication signals (Persinger et al., 2013). Hence
one may argue that bio-photons—or whatever is behind them—
propagating along pathways parallel to axons analogous to
wave guides could serve as carriers of neuronal and biological
information. This would force the views about the role of nerve
pulses to be challenged.
Could
the
neural
transmitters
in
synaptic
contacts
connect communications lines assignable to axons to longer
communications for photons to propagate? There would be
analogy with radio communications. Keeping them open all the
time could mean too high metabolic energy costs. We remain
neutral with regard to claims about bio-photons.
This would also allow feedback to sensory organs as virtual
sensory input and hallucinations and rapid eye movement (REM)
dreams could be understood in terms of virtual sensory input.
The assumption that sensory organs serve as seats of sensory
qualia, would allow to get rid of the mystery why essentially
identical brain areas can give rise to so diﬀerent sensory qualia.
The basic objection provided by phantom leg could be avoided if
the pain in the phantom leg is a sensory memory.
c) If the arrow of time is not universal and could change,
apparent superluminal velocities may become possible. The
photon traveling to, say, the past and reﬂected back in the
direction of time could return back to the time when it was
sent. Could memories be identiﬁed as communications with the
geometric past of brain: seeing in time direction?
d) Macroscopic quantum coherence and entanglement
could
make
apparent
violation
of

barrier
possible. Whether standard quantum theory is enough to
allow macroscopic quantum coherence and cognitive and
sensory enhancement is however far from clear. Biosystems are
coherent systems, which is extremely diﬃcult to understand
in standard quantum theory. Could biology teach something
important to physicists?
ER-EPR correspondence claims that wormholes serve as
correlates for quantum entanglement in GRT. Could this picture
generalize so that the analogs of wormholes (unstable in GRT)
would be everyday life in biology?
e) The generation of quantum coherence in brain scale could
explain sensory enhancement in a given sensory modality by a
stimulus in diﬀerent modality. The binding of pharmacological
drugs to the synaptic contacts could build “bridges” between
neurons making quantum coherence in longer scales possible.
This coherence would reﬂect itself as synchronous neuronal
ﬁring in larger brain regions.
As can be seen, there are diﬀerent bottlenecks, wherein
the velocity of brain information exchange can be enhanced.
However, the sum of these separate enhancements could never
reach the speed of light, even if these synergisms are combined.
The brain cannot be relativistic.
New physics involving macroscopic quantum coherence
and possibly both arrows of time could however allow even
instantaneous integration of neuronal information.
