Topology is central to phenomena that arise in a variety of ﬁelds, ranging from
quantum ﬁeld theory to quantum information science to condensed matter
physics. Recently, the study of topology has been extended to open systems,
leading to a plethora of intriguing effects such as topological lasing, excep-
tional surfaces, as well as non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence.
Here, we show that Bloch eigenstates associated with lattices with dissipatively
coupled elements exhibit geometric properties that cannot be described via
scalar Berry phases, in sharp contrast to conservative Hamiltonians with non-
degenerate energy levels. This unusual behavior can be attributed to the sig-
niﬁcant population exchanges among the corresponding dissipation bands of
such lattices. Using a one-dimensional example, we show both theoretically
and experimentally that such population exchanges can manifest themselves
via matrix-valued operators in the corresponding Bloch dynamics. In two-
dimensional lattices, such matrix-valued operators can form non-commuting
pairs and lead to non-Abelian dynamics, as conﬁrmed by our numerical
simulations. Our results point to new ways in which the combined effect of
topology and engineered dissipation can lead to non-Abelian topological
phenomena.
According to quantum mechanics, the dynamics of a closed system are
governed by a set of unitary operators. On most occasions, however, a
real physical arrangement inevitably exchanges energy with its sur-
rounding environment—something that has traditionally been con-
sidered an adverse effect, as it produces decoherence and energy
decay1. Yet, recent studies have shown that dissipative interactions,
which occur when the elements of a system exchange information
through the surrounding environment, may be used as valuable tools
for shaping the responses of open systems2–4. Such engineered dis-
sipation has been successfully implemented in various settings, ran-
ging from quantum computing5,6 and information processing7–10 to
active optical platforms to electronic and mechanical arrangements11.
Recent years have witnessed a ﬂurry of interest in the emerging
ﬁeld of topological physics12,13. One of the most prominent examples of
topological behavior is a set of materials exhibiting nonzero topological
invariants which are endowed with inherent robustness against local
disorders14. This type of topological protection also occurs in physical
settings beyond condensed matter physics and has led to unidirectional
transport and robust features in optics15–19, cold atoms20,21, mechanics22,
and acoustics23,24. While topological phenomena were originally studied
in closed systems, recent works on topology in open systems have led to
a host of intriguing effects25–30. For instance, the interplay between
topology and dissipation/gain has been utilized to develop robust and
efﬁcient coherent light sources26,31–36. Other studies include the emer-
gence of topological phases from purely dissipative interactions in the
absence of Hamiltonian couplings37–39, as well as extending the bulk-
edge correspondence and topological band theory to open and non-
Hermitian settings40–45.

Gauge ﬁelds are pivotal to the understanding of topological phe-
nomena that arise, for instance, in the Pancharatnam-Berry phases ﬁrst
introduced in polarization optics. On many occasions, these gauge ﬁelds
belong to the Abelian class which give rise to closed-loop evolution
operators in the parameter space that commute with each other. This
simple picture changes drastically in more complex scenarios which
involve non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds where the corresponding operators
along different paths are no longer commutative and can be utilized to
obtain universal gates for topological quantum computing46. Although
Abelian gauge ﬁelds have been widely used for characterizing topolo-
gical states47–51, their non-Abelian counterparts have largely remained
unexplored. This is mainly due to the strict requirements, such as the
existence of degenerate states in the underlying Hilbert space that are
necessary in a conservative system to host non-commutative evolution
operators52,53. Quite recently, non-Abelian effects and topological char-
ges have been observed in a variety of photonic systems54–57 involving
coupled waveguide arrays58,59 and nonreciprocal elements60. Despite
intense research efforts in this area, studies have exclusively focused on
systems with conservative couplings. In contrast, we show how the
synergy between topology and dissipation can give rise to non-Abelian
dynamics in the reciprocal space.
Here, we show that Lindbladians involving dissipative couplings
can be governed by matrix-valued modiﬁed Wilson lines52, leading to
non-Abelian effects56,59–61. To do so, we experimentally measure non-
trivial geometric phases and demonstrate signatures of non-Abelian
effects in a dissipatively-coupled network of time-multiplexed photo-
nic resonators. In contrast to conservative systems possessing non-
degenerate energy levels wherein the geometric properties of the
Bloch eigenstates are typically predicted by scalar Berry phases, here,
signiﬁcant population exchange can occur among the ensuing dis-
sipation bands. Our simulations involving a two-dimensional honey-
comb lattice illustrate how such dynamics lead to non-Abelian
operators acting on the reciprocal space.

j ^Lj,^ρg is the dissipator
resulting from the nonlocal jump operators ^Lj acting upon the lattice
site j. When ^H = 0, the lattice sites only exchange energy via the
dissipators D½^Lj. Such purely dissipative couplings can be engi-
neered to map the energy spectra of arbitrary tight-binding
Hamiltonians into the decay rates of the corresponding open
system38,62. In particular, by properly choosing D½^Lj, the Lindbladian
of Eq. (1) supports Bloch eigenstates characterized by bands of
dissipation rates in the reciprocal space (see Supplementary Part 1).
For our experiments, we use a time-multiplexed photonic reso-
nator network depicted schematically in Fig. 1. This time-multiplexed
network consists of a main ﬁber loop (the “Main Cavity”), which sup-
ports N = 64 resonant pulses separated by a repetition period, TR. Each
pulse represents an individual resonator associated with the annihila-
tion (creation) operators ^cðyÞ
j
in Eq. (1). In addition, in order to realize
the jump operators ^Lj, we construct delay lines to dissipatively couple
the individual pulses. Each delay line is equipped with intensity mod-
ulators that control the strengths of these couplings (see Fig. 1). It
should be emphasized that the setup used here has two important
distinctions compared to the one used in38 that enables us to experi-
mentally investigate geometric properties and non-Abelian signatures
associated with topological dissipative bands. First, the present work
uses a homodyne detection scheme to resolve the phase information
encoded in the optical ﬁelds, as necessary to measure geometric
phases. Second, to probe the geometric properties of the dissipation
bands, we apply a constant force in the reciprocal space which trans-
lates into a closed-loop evolution deﬁned on the Brillouin zone in the
Bloch-momentum space. This type of evolution results in periodic
revivals in the dynamics of the optical ﬁelds across the lattice which are
known as Bloch oscillations (BO). To achieve this, we implement the
Hamiltonian ^HBO = F  ^r, where F represents a constant effective force
along the reciprocal lattice direction r. In Supplementary Part 2 we
show that this Hamiltonian can be approximated by a pulse-to-pulse
linear phase gradient implemented by a phase modulator in the main
cavity of our network.
To experimentally demonstrate BOs, we ﬁrst construct a 1D lattice
(see Supplementary Part 3) with uniform, nearest-neighbor dissipative
couplings (Fig. 2a). The jump operators in the master equation
describing this lattice are given by ^Lj =
ﬃﬃﬃ
Γ
p
ð^cj + ^cj + 1Þ (see Supplemen-
tary Part 1). We excite a single lattice site in the network and observe its
evolution under different pulse-to-pulse phase gradients, which cor-
respond to different BO Hamiltonians HBO. We ﬁrst investigate the
dynamics in the absence of a phase gradient (i.e., ^HBO = 0). In this case,
the excitation undergoes dissipative discrete diffraction (Fig. 2b). We
emphasize that the shape of the diffraction pattern in this ﬁgure is
qualitatively different from its conservative counterparts63 due to the
dissipative couplings involved (see Supplementary Part 7). Next, we
turn on the linear gradient potential associated with ^HBO. Figure 2c, d
shows experimental pulse propagation measurements associated with
ϕ0 = 2π/8 and ϕ0 = 2π/4, which correspond to Bloch periods of 8 and 4
network roundtrips, respectively. As evident from these ﬁgures, the
presence of pulse-to-pulse phase gradients causes the excitation to
undergo periodic diffraction and refocusing, which is the hallmark of
Bloch oscillations.

intensity modulator (IM) and a phase modulator (PM) are used in the input of the
optical ﬁber to generate arbitrary wavefunctions deﬁned by injected femtosecond
pulses from a mode-locked laser with a repetition rate of TR. An Erbium-doped ﬁber
ampliﬁer (EDFA) is used in the main cavity to compensate for the losses and
increase the number of measurement roundtrips. Two delay lines with smaller and
larger lengths than the main cavity (corresponding to delays of −TR and + TR,
respectively) are used to dissipatively couple the pulses. b Schematic of a resonant

Typically, in a Hamiltonian lattice with multiple energy bands, the
associated Bloch states tend to remain in a single band when subject to
a sufﬁciently weak external force F. Under such adiabatic conditions,
the state undergoes Bloch oscillations and merely acquires a phase
factor comprised of a dynamical part in addition to the geometric
Berry phase associated with its energy band64,65. This is in sharp con-
trast to Lindbladian lattices exhibiting dissipation bands which in
general may not be considered in isolation. In this sense, the two-band
open systems studied here exhibit reciprocal-space dynamics and
band topologies similar to those of Hamiltonian systems possessing
quasi-degenerate
energy
levels53,66.

corresponding to the non-Hermitian Bloch Hamiltonian associated
with the system Lindbladian52 (see Supplementary Parts 5 and 6). Here,
p, q represent two arbitrary bands of the system.
In order to show how the modiﬁed Wilson line in Eq. (2) can be
used to experimentally characterize gauge ﬁelds and topological
invariants within dissipative bands, we ﬁrst consider a one-dimensional
Su-Scrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattice (Fig. 3a). To implement this, the
intensity modulators within the network are programmed to realize the
staggered couplings of the SSH model. These couplings correspond to
the jump operators ^LA,j =

(Supplementary Part 1), where A and B represent the two sublattices in
the structure. With these jump operators, the resulting Lindbladian
exhibits a dissipative band structure that can host a topologically
nontrivial bandgap (Fig. 3a). We ﬁrst examine the upper-band geo-
metric Berry phase θ+ resulting from the A1,1 component of the Wilczek-
Zee connection. To do so, we initially excite the upper-band Bloch
eigenstate at k = 0. Meanwhile, the phase modulator in the cavity is
programmed to impart a pulse-to-pulse phase gradient of ϕ0 = 2π/8 to
initiate Bloch oscillations in the dissipatively coupled SSH lattice. After
a complete Bloch period, we measure the output of the network using
homodyne detection (see Fig. 1a). As expected from Eq. (2), at this
point, the observed state is in a superposition of the upper- and lower-
band Bloch eigenstates (see Supplementary Part 6). Consequently, to
measure the Zak phase associated with the upper band, we project the
observed state into the upper-band eigenstate. Because the dissipative
dynamics of our system does not impart a dynamical phase, the relative
phase difference between this state and that of the originally launched
pulses provides a direct measurement of the upper-band Zak phase.
Figure 3b–d presents our experimentally measured values of this
geometric phase in different coupling regimes of the SSH model. For
ΓA = ΓB, we measure a Zakphase value of θ+ = ϕZ0 ≈−0.02π, as expected
from theory (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, when ΓA ≠ΓB, our measure-
ments show θ+ = ϕZ1 ≈0.47π and θ+ = ϕZ2 ≈−0.51π for the dimeriza-
tions D1 and D2 depicted in Fig. 3c, d, respectively. Based on these
results, the absolute value of the Zak phase in this open topological
system is measured to be ϕZ = ϕZ1 −ϕZ2 ≈0.98π, in agreement with the

undergoes dissipative discrete diffraction in the lattice. In contrast, when a nonzero
phase gradient is established among the pulses, optical power exhibits an oscilla-
tory pattern with a Bloch period equal to NB = 8, 4 in c, d, respectively. In all cases,
the optical power across the lattice sites is normalized in every round trip to pro-
vide a more distinct visualization of the ﬁeld intensities.

theoretically expected value of ϕZ = π for a topologically nontrivial SSH
lattice.
As discussed earlier, Eq. (2) describes different dynamics than that
occurring in conservative Hamiltonian systems, since the gauge ﬁelds
involved in Eq. (2) are no longer characterized by the scalar-valued
Berry phases. To show this contrast, we consider a scenario wherein
the Bloch eigenstate associated with the lower band of our dissipative
SSH model ∣ψð0Þi is initially excited. Under such conditions, the off-
diagonal Wilczek-Zee connections (Apq) result in a nonzero population
of the upper band in addition to the lower one. The effective force
applied via ^HBO will then transport both of these eigenstates along
their corresponding bands in the reciprocal space (Fig. 4a, b). As k
varies between 0 and 2π, each of the Bloch eigenstates ∣ψ ± i are mul-
tiplied by a Zak phase of ϕZ1 = π/2 for the D1 conﬁguration shown in
Fig. 3c. Meanwhile, due to the dissipative nature of the bands, the
upper-band eigenstate is relatively ampliﬁed while the lower one is
attenuated more. Hence, at the end of the Brillouin zone when k = 2π,
the contribution from the upper-band eigenstate that interferes with
that associated with the lower one dominates the total population in
this level due to its much higher amplitude. The combined effect of
these inter-band transitions and parallel transports along the two
bands of the dissipative SSH system is thus expected to impart a total
phase of θ−= −π/2 to the original Eigenstate ∣ψð0Þi launched in the
input. We note that this behavior is in stark contrast to that expected
from the SSH model implemented conservatively, where both the
upper and lower bands display equal geometric phase values deter-
mined by their associated Zak phases (Fig. 4a). Figure 4c presents the
experimentally measured lower-band geometric phases with a mean
value of θ−= −0.49π, conﬁrming our theoretical predictions based on
Eq. (2) (see Supplementary Part 6).
So far, we showed that the geometric properties of dissipative
bands in one-dimensional lattices involve the full matrix-valued
Wilczek-Zee connections associated with the Bloch eigenstates in such
systems. In this respect, our experimentally measured geometric
phases provide signatures of non-Abelian effects in dissipative topo-
logical lattices. However, to deﬁne intersecting closed loops in the
reciprocal space that are necessary for non-Abelian operators, one
needs to consider lattices extending over more than one dimension.
For this purpose, we choose a dissipative honeycomb lattice as shown
in Fig. 5a. Such a lattice exhibits two distinct bands of dissipation, as
shown in Fig. 5b. Starting from an arbitrary Bloch momentum in the
reciprocal space k = k(0), we consider two different closed loops
depicted as C1 and C2 in Fig. 5c. By applying a force F parallel to Ci
(i = 1, 2) an initial state ∣ψðk0Þi is transformed in the reciprocal space to
a new state ^
W 0ðCiÞ∣ψðk0Þi. Given that these evolutions involve time-
ordered integrals with matrices that in general do not commute, we
expect the ﬁnal state of the system to depend on the order of such
operators. Figure 5d presents our simulations using Eq. (2) for two
different scenarios, where the normalized initial and ﬁnal states are
displayed on a Bloch sphere. These results demonstrate the non-
Abelian nature of the dynamics that arise in the photonic dissipative
lattices considered here. For more detailed simulations, please see
Supplementary Part 10.
Discussion
In conclusion, we have shown that non-Abelian effects can arise in a
dissipatively coupled network of time-multiplexed photonic resona-
tors. In contrast to conservative Hamiltonian systems with non-
degenerate energy levels where the geometric properties are typically
predicted by scalar Berry phases, here, the emerging gauge ﬁelds are in
general governed by matrix-valued modiﬁed Wilson lines which may
not commute for different Bloch momenta. Our measurements on the
geometric Zak phases in a one-dimensional SSH model corroborate
our theoretical predictions. In two dimensions, the non-Abelian nature

different couplings ΓA = 2ΓB together with its associated dissipation bands. Since
the interactions among the constituent elements are arising from the corre-
sponding dissipators, these bands represent relative gain/decay rates, with the
upper-band Bloch eigenstates experiencing relative gain while the ones associated
with the lower band decay faster. b–d Experimentally measured Zak phases under
various coupling conditions. A trivial coupling between the lattice sites ΓA = ΓB leads
to a zero Zak phase b. On the other hand, when the intercell and intracell
dissipators differ, our measurements show ϕZ1 ≈0.47π and ϕZ2 ≈−0.51π for the two
possible dimerizations D1 and D2 shown in c, d, respectively. These nontrivial
phases are geometrically equivalent to the counter-clockwise and clockwise
windings of the upper-band Bloch eigenstates on the associated Bloch sphere, as
depicted in the insets c, d, respectively. Each data set represents various unit cells
(shown in dashed lines) within a single measurement, except for the two ﬁrst and
last units to avoid edge effects. In all cases the error bars indicate standard
deviations.

of the underlying dynamics can be manifested in non-commutative
operators acting on the Bloch eigenstates. Our ﬁndings unveil new
ways in which topology and engineered dissipation can interact and
lead to non-Abelian topological phenomena.
Methods
Experimental procedure
As discussed above, our time-multiplexed photonic resonator network
consists of a main ﬁber loop ("Main Cavity”), which supports 64 reso-
nant pulses separated by TR ≈4 ns, as well as two optical delay lines,
which introduce nearest neighbor dissipative couplings between the
pulses in the network. A detailed schematic of this network is shown in
Supplementary Fig. 1. To realize dissipative BOs and to measure the Zak
phases of the SSH bands, we insert intensity modulators (IMs) into the
delay lines, a phase modulator (PM) and an IM into the main cavity. The
IMs in the delay lines control the pulse-to-pulse coupling strengths,
while the intra-cavity PM in the main cavity produces a linear phase
ramp that induces Bloch oscillations. During the experiment, we use
intra-cavity IM to “Q-switch” the cavity, so that the pulses in the network
see less loss as they undergo Bloch oscillations. This allows us to operate
the system close to threshold for a brief time during the experiment and
helps to extend the number of roundtrips that we are able to observe.
Before and after the experiment, we operate the network well below the
threshold, where it is easier to actively stabilize the system.

a Geometric winding of the lower-band Bloch eigenstates associated with a con-
servative SSH Hamiltonian illustrated on the Bloch sphere. In this representation,
the upper and lower Bloch eigenstates are located on the equatorial plane, shown in
red and blue colors, respectively. Here, ∣Ai and ∣Bi represent the uniformly dis-
tributed states residing on the A and B sublattices, corresponding to the points
located on the south and the north poles of the Bloch sphere, respectively. The
magenta and light blue arrows represent the upper- and lower-band Bloch eigen-
states associated with the Bloch momentum k = 0, respectively. The lower panel
indicates reciprocal-space dynamics associated with the lower band, which in the
adiabatic regime is independent of the upper band. b Similar results for a dis-
sipative SSH Lindbladian are obtained from the corresponding modiﬁed Wilson line
operator (Eq. (2)). Unlike the conservative case a, the lower-band of a dissipative
SSH lattice is expected to exhibit a different geometric phase than that of the upper
one. This is because the dissipation bands emerging in the latter are coupled via the
off-diagonal Wilczek-Zee connections (Apq), as illustrated in the lower panel b.
Hence, during a Bloch period, the upper-band eigenstates (represented by green
dots) are relatively ampliﬁed while those associated with the lower one (shown as
orange dots) experience a higher attenuation. Eventually, the state of the system at
the end of this cycle is determined by the interference between the eigenstates
associated with these two bands, which is dominated by the upper-band con-
tribution. This results in a π phase shift in the lower-band geometric phase. The left
and right black dotted arrows represent the transfer of Bloch eigenstate popula-
tions from the lower band to the upper one and vice versa, respectively.
c Experimentally measured values (to be compared with Fig. 3c) indeed corrobo-
rate these theoretical predictions. In all cases the error bars indicate standard
deviations.

To measure dissipative BOs, we adjust the throughput of the delay
lines to equalize the coupling strengths of the nearest neighbor cou-
plings. We calibrate the phase modulator to implement a phase ramp
with the desired pulse-to-pulse phase difference. Then, using IMs at the
input of the main cavity, we excite a single time-slot (lattice site) in our
time-multiplexed network with pulses from a mode-locked laser. With
the delayline couplings and the linear phase ramp turned off, we excite
this site over several roundtrips of the cavity to build up power in the
network. We then stop the excitation and turn on the phase ramp and
the delay line couplings. We record a time trace of the network over
~32 roundtrips with a fast photodetector and average over 10 inde-
pendent time traces to generate the colormaps displayed in Fig. 2.
While the signatures of Bloch oscillations are clear in this ﬁgure, we
observe that asymmetry in the delay line couplings and imperfections
in the linear phase ramp degrade the ﬁdelity of the dissipative Bloch
oscillations over many roundtrips.
For our geometric phase measurements, we reconstruct the
roundtrip-to-roundtrip phase evolution of the network by detecting
the pulses in the system with an optical hybrid coupler and two
balanced detectors (see Supplementary Part 3). To detect roundtrip-
to-roundtrip phase drift during our experiments, we populate 32 of the
64 time slots within the cavity with reference pulses. Coupling between
these reference pulses is suppressed with the delay line IMs, and we
use the mean phase of the reference pulses as a reference on each
roundtrip of the experiments. These 32 reference pulses are also
decoupled from the 32 remaining experiment time slots, which are
used to measure the geometric phases.
To measure the Zak phase associated with the dissipative SSH
model, we apply a linear phase ramp to the experiment time slots with
the intra-cavity PM, and we program the delay line IMs to couple the
experiment time slots with the staggered couplings of the SSH model.
Using the IMs atthe input to the main cavity, we populate the reference
time slots with a uniform stream of pulses and inject a Bloch state from
either the upper or lower bands into the experiment time slots. We
monitor the evolution of the pulses over a full Bloch period so that we
can compare the initial excitation with the state of the network after
one Bloch cycle.
Data analysis
Bloch oscillations. For the three phase gradients used in our BO
experiments, Δϕ = 0, Δϕ = 2π/4, Δϕ = 2π/8, we average the response of
the network over 10 recorded traces. To better visualize the roundtrip-
to-roundtrip dynamics of the system, we normalize the power in the
network during each roundtrip such that the sum of the peak powers
of the pulses is unity. Normalizing the power in this manner elucidates
the oscillatory dynamics produced by the presence of a phase gradient
because it clearly reveals the spreading and relocalization of
the power.
Geometric phase measurements. To determine the geometric phase
acquired in each band, we record the in-phase and quadrature com-
ponents of the pulses as the system undergoes dissipative BOs.
Because the 32-site chain used for our measurements has open
boundary conditions, we neglect the dynamics experienced by the
pulses at the edges. After a full Bloch period, we project the observed
state into the upper and lower bands of the SSH model. For an initial
excitation in the upper (lower) band, the phase acquired by the pro-
jection of this state into the upper (lower) band indicates the

geometric phase acquired within the corresponding band. We perform
this procedure for an ensemble of independent measurements, and in
Figs. 3 and 4, we plot the means and sample standard deviations of
each measurement. From these measurements, we construct estima-
tors for the means of the measured geometric phases, and we state
these values in the main text.
