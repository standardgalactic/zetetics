Introduction 
The ideals behind open sourcing stipulate that everyone benefits when we share and work together. Any 
open source project is designed to promote collaborative sharing of design elements with peers and to 
help each other learn from, adopt, or enhance shared contributions in a professional and inclusive 
manner. The Open Compute Project Foundation (OCP) operates within these ideals, and therefore 
requires that terminology that could be considered offensive be eliminated from any material. 
 
Scope 
 
Deprecated Terminology should be removed from all material contributed or shared with the Open 
Compute Project Community. This includes all material or presentations shared during project calls, 
workshops and  Summit events. The preferred terminology shall be applied to all documentation, 
specifications, white papers and presentations. Specifically examples include: 
  
●
Schematics: Change pins on devices to the appropriate preferred name. Use net and signal 
names that avoid the use of terminology listed in the deprecated terminology column below.  
●
Hardware: Replace deprecated terminology with preferred terminology silkscreen labels.  
●
Software / Firmware: Add new function names using the preferred terminology. Maintaining 
reverse compatibility with deprecated names is allowed. 
●
Datasheets / Documentation: Use preferred terminology for general documentation and any pin 
and signal names listed within the documentation.
