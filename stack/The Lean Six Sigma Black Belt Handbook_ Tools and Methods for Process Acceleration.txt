This book is dedicated to the thousands of Lean Six Sigma Belts that Jim 
Harrington and I have had the privilege of mentoring and certifying 
over the past 10 years. And to the Four Horsemen of the Quality 
Movement—Deming, Juran, Crosby, and Feigenbaum. Thank you for 
teaching us how to teach, and for encouraging us to find a better way.
Frank Voehl
I dedicate this book to the person who created me and gave me 
her love—my mother, Carrie, and to the person who helped mold 
my life and made me what I am—my wife, Marguerite.
H. James Harrington
This book is dedicated to two people who have had 
the most profound impacts on my life—
my dad and my daughter. To my late dad, Edmund J. Charron, who 
in my formative years provided a steady stream of learning exercises 
through quotations, principles, and actions. Unbeknownst to me 
at the time, these gems of his essence would intermittently emerge 
throughout my life and guide me just when I needed them the most. 
To my precious daughter Hali, who as a child taught me that love is 
the most powerful force in the universe. Like my father before me, 
may I provide to you through word and deed values to live by.
Richard Charron

Acknowledgments
I thank Candy Rogers, who invested endless hours to edit and transform my 
rough draft into a finished product. I couldn’t have done it without her help.
I would be remiss not to acknowledge the contributions made by my 
many clients to the broadening of my experience base and to the many new 
concepts that they introduced to me. Every engagement I worked on has 
been a learning experience that could not be duplicated in any university.
I also recognize my many good friends who have freely shared their 
ideas with me, helping me to grow and look at things in a new light. I 
would particularly like to point out the many contributions I received 
from Chuck Mignosa, Frank Voehl, and Armand Feigenbaum.

In the book Tech Trending, Dr. Harrington was referred to as “the quint­
essential tech trender.” The New York Times noted his “knack for synthe­
sis and an open mind about packaging his knowledge and experience in 
new ways—characteristics that may matter more as prerequisites for new-
economy success than technical wizardry.” The author Tom Peters stated, 
“I fervently hope that Harrington’s readers will not only benefit from the 
thoroughness of his effort but will also ‘smell’ the fundamental nature of 
the challenge for change that he mounts.” William Clinton, past president

Overview of Lean Six Sigma
ABOUT THIS BOOK
What are the prerequisite knowledge and skills required to using this 
book? What kind of tools and methodologies are included in this Lean 
Six Sigma Black Belt (LSSBB) handbook? How is the book organized? 
Why did we choose to organize the book as we did? The following are our 
answers to these questions.
The LSSBB methodology has been designed to provide a growth path 
for the people using it. The following outlines this growth path along 
with the prerequisites for each step in the path, starting at the begin­
ning level:
• Six Sigma White Belt—No prerequisite
• Six Sigma Yellow Belt—No prerequisite
• Six Sigma Green Belt—Yellow Belt prerequisite
• Lean Green Belt—No prerequisite
• Six Sigma Black Belt—Six Sigma Green Belt or equivalent
• Lean Six Sigma Black Belt—Six Sigma Green Belt and Lean Green 
Belt or equivalent
• Master Black Belt—Lean Six Sigma Black Belt or equivalent

2  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
This book is written on the assumption that the reader has already 
gained experience in using all the tools and methods required to be certi­
fied as a Six Sigma Green Belt (SSGB), or at the least, he or she has been 
trained in these tools and methodologies. As a result, the tools and meth­
ods taught in Six Sigma Green Belt classes, as outlined in our Six Sigma 
Green Belt Handbook (Harrington, Voehl, and Gupta; Paton Press, Chico, 
CA), will not be repeated in this book. (A list of the tools and methods 
that the reader should already have mastered before using this handbook 
can be found in Appendix C.) A list of the additional tools and methods 
presented in this book and which are required to be classified as a LSSBB 
includes the following:
Nonstatistical tools:
• 5S
• Benchmarking
• Bureaucracy elimination
• Conflict resolution
• Critical to quality
• Cycle time analysis and reduction
• Fast action solution technique
• Foundation of Six Sigma
• Just-in-time
• Matrix diagrams/decision matrix
• Measurement in Six Sigma
• Organizational change management
• Pareto diagrams
• Project management
• Quality function deployment
• Reliability management systems
• Root cause analysis
• Scatter diagrams
• Selection matrix/decision matrix
• SIPOC (Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Output, and Customers)
• SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats)
• Takt time
• Theory of constraints
• Tree diagram
• Value stream mapping

Statistical tools:
• ANOVA—one-way
• ANOVA—two-way
• Box plots
• Confidence intervals
• Data transformation
• Design of experiments
• Measurement system analysis
• Method of least squares
• Multivari charts
• Nonparametric statistical tests
• Population and samples

In developing the content for this handbook, we relied heavily upon the 
core content that we developed for our Six Sigma Yellow Belt Handbook 
(Harrington and Voehl; Paton Press, Chico, CA) and Six Sigma Green Belt 
Handbook (Harrington, Voehl, and Gupta; Paton Press, Chico, CA). Both 
of these have a core introduction and brief history of the Six Sigma move­
ment. Our primary goal in preparing this book was to develop a com­
prehensive framework for organizing large amounts of useful knowledge 
about Lean, quality management, and continuous improvement process 
applications so that only the tools that the reader will use to solve 90% of 
the problems are the focus of the books.
The book begins with an overview and brief history of Six Sigma, fol­
lowed by some tips for using Lean Six Sigma (LSS), along with a look at 
the LSS quality system, its supporting organization, and the different 
roles involved. In Section 2 we discuss in detail the theories and concepts 
required to support a Lean system. It is pointed out that Lean is more a 
way of managing than a set of tools. Lean focuses on the elimination of all 
waste. In Section 3 the book presents the new additional skills and tech­
nologies that an individual is required to master in order to be certified 
at the LSSBB level. Next, in Sections 4 and 5, the advanced nonstatistical 
and statistical tools that are new to the LSSBB body of knowledge are pre­
sented in detail.

4  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
An LSSBB is an experienced individual who has the capabilities to solve 
complex problems as well as the capabilities of training Six Sigma Green 
and Yellow Belts. They also are capable of managing a number of improve­
ment projects simultaneously while giving guidance to Six Sigma Green 
Belts who are working on improvement projects. The combination of the 
skills and techniques presented in this handbook are designed to prepare 
an individual to be certified as an LSSBB. Those individuals who are clas­
sified as LSSBBs are required to have mastered both the Lean and Six 
Sigma methodologies and techniques, making them an extremely valu­
able resource for any organization.
The format used is that of a handbook; it contains descriptions and dia­
grams of the tools that a team has practiced or will consider. The Lean Six 
Sigma Black Belt Handbook is an easy read and is designed to be used by 
readers at every level of the organization hierarchy and any industry. The 
handbook discussions will cover the following five areas:
• Alignment of individuals and organizational performance
• Implementation of results-oriented process improvement
• Institution of the human capital management function
• Need for sustained management attention for addressing key organi­
zation responsibilities in an integrated manner
• Facilitation of the transformation process within the organization
You may have experienced problem solving as a one-step process—just 
solve it! But there is more to it than that. For starters, you have to know 
what the problem or waste area really is, what’s causing the problem, and 
then look at new creative ways to make things better. These are covered 
in the following sections by providing a step-by-step roadmap you can 
use in your organization. The DMADV roadmap that is presented can 
be used to find the right solutions and avoid some of the pitfalls you have 
experienced in the past. The roadmap is set up to be followed one step or 
“tollgate” at a time, but you may not need to follow each step in every situ­
ation. For example, if your need is gathering, you can proceed directly to 
tollgate 5, or maybe if the root causes are already obvious, you can breeze 
through that step of analyzing the causes. In other words, each one of you 
may have a different story to tell based on the tollgate sequences that you 
decide to use. The process starts where the priority is the strongest.

Overview of Lean Six Sigma  •  5
This book is divided into five sections:
• Section 1: Overview of Lean Six Sigma
• Section 2: The Lean Journey into Process Improvement
• Section 3: SSBB Overview
• Section 4: LSSBB Advanced Nonstatistical Tools
• Section 5: LSSBB Advanced Statistical Tools
It is our hope that this book will serve as the basic reference for your 
training to become an LSSBB and as an ongoing reference book as you 
use the LSS methodology. But it is important to realize that the assign­
ment as a LSSBB is a stepping stone, not a career. LSSBBs are needed to 
solve major problems that have a significant impact on the organization’s 
performance and to help install a new culture where waste is not toler­
ated. In all well-managed organizations these major problems should have 
been addressed, solved, and the cultural change implemented within 1 to 
3 years. As a result, after a short period of time, there will be no need for 
full-time LSSBBs, but there will always be a need for the knowledge and 
skills that the LSSBBs bring to the table. As such, the tools and methodol­
ogy used by the LSSBBs should become part of the organization’s assets. 
The skills and experience that the LSSBBs acquire provide a logical base for 
promoting them to a higher level and more responsible positions once the 
major problems have been addressed. These are exactly the conditions that 
we have seen in organizations like IBM, Motorola, and GE. Individuals 
who have tried to make being an LSSBB a career have often received addi­
tional training to become a Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt (LSSMBB) 
and moved on to another company that had major problems and wanted 
to install an LSS system, or to become a consultant.

Introduction to Lean Six 
Sigma Methodology
Lean Six Sigma increases the focus on Lean approaches with less empha­
sis on the statistical rigor included in the Six Sigma methodology alone.
—H. J. Harrington
Lean Six Sigma is a synergistic process that creates a value stream 
map of the process identifying value add and non-value add costs, and 
captures the Voice of the customer to define the customer Critical To 
Quality issues. Projects within the process are then prioritized based 
on the delay time they inject. This prioritization process inevitably 
pinpoints activities with high defect rates (Six Sigma tools) or long 
setups, downtime (Lean tools), with the result often yielding savings 
of $250,000 and a payback ratio between 4−1 and 20−1.
—Michael George
Lean Six Sigma expert and one of the founding fathers*
*	 Source: An interview with Michael George (Chairman and CEO of George Group) by Frank Voehl, February 
2008. During the course of the interview, George went on to state that while classical projects involving Six 
Sigma are most closely associated with defects and quality, Lean itself is linked to speed, while eliminating all 
forms of waste and inefficiency. George has written extensively that Lean provides tools to reduce lead time of 
any process and eliminate no-value-added cost, and he explained that Six Sigma did not contain any tools to 
control lead time (e.g., pull systems), or tools specific to the reduction of lead time (e.g., setup reduction). Since 
companies “must become more responsive to changing customer needs, faster lead times are essential in all 
endeavors.” Lean is an important complement to Six Sigma, George insisted, and fits well within the Six Sigma 
DMAIC and even the DMADV processes. Finally, George points to the Lean Kaizen approach, which he extols 
as a great methodology that can be used to accelerate the rate of improvement and even breakthrough. In our 
writings in other books, the authors advocate both the need to improve quality so you can achieve maximum 
speed and the need to do the things at the same time that allow maximum speed in order to reach the highest 
Sigma levels of quality. In other words, George concluded, you need both Lean (speed) and Six Sigma (quality) 
principles and tools to drive improvements and gain and maintain competitive advantage.

IN A NUTSHELL
As with most new concepts, each has evolved from a previous concept. 
Total Quality Control is an expansion of the quality assurance concept. 
Total Quality Management (TQM) is an expansion of the Total Quality 
Control concept. Process redesign is an enlargement and expanded use 
of some of the key Total Quality Management concepts, applying them to 
the service and support processes. The Six Sigma methodology just set a 
new performance standard using tools that were part of the Total Quality 
Management concepts. The metaphor of “standing on the shoulders of 
giants” is often used to illustrate the notion of building upon the systems 
and programs that are already in place, as opposed to “reinventing the 
wheel.” While it is considered by most experts essential for a company to 
create familiarity with both Lean and Six Sigma disciplines by training 
employees, it is even more important to incorporate an integrated Lean 
Six Sigma philosophy into the company in order to change the culture.
The Lean concepts were based upon Henry Ford’s production pro­
cess that was refined in the early 1900s and which became part of Total 
Quality Management and the Six Sigma methodologies. The Lean Six 
Sigma (LSS) methodology increases the focus on Lean approaches, with 
less emphasis on the statistical analysis requirements normally included 
in the Six Sigma methodology. The Six Sigma approach was directed at 
reducing variation, but most of the real contributions were made related 
to the elimination of no-value-added activities (elimination of wastes). 
The LSS methodology focuses on waste reduction with less emphasis 
on reducing variation. It recognizes nine forms of waste, which are an 
expansion of Taiichi Ohno’s original seven wastes. The nine forms of 
waste are:
	
1.	Overproduction
	
2.	Overprocessing
	
3.	Motion
	
4.	Transportation
	
5.	Inventory
	
6.	Waiting
	
7.	Underutilized employees
	
8.	Defects
	
9.	Behavior

Taiichi Ohno was the father of the Toyota Production System and the 
creator of the original “seven deadly wastes.” Ohno’s training and insight 
led him to the conclusion that Toyota’s productivity should not be any 
lower in any way than that in the Detroit and European automobile manu­
facturers’ shops. As a worker and supervisor, he set out to eliminate the 
waste and inefficiencies in the part of the production process that he could 
control the results for, and these efforts ultimately led to the core beliefs of 
the Toyota Production System (TPS). Over the past 30 years, several ele­
ments of the TPS system have become adapted and adopted in the Western 
world, like muda (the elimination of waste), jidoka (the injection of qual­
ity), and Kanban (the pull system of just-in-time inventory stock control). 
For more information, see Guide to Management Ideas and Gurus, by Tim 
Hindle (Economist Books; Profile Books, London, UK). This guide has 
the lowdown on more than 50 of the world’s most influential management 
thinkers, past and present, and over 100 of the most influential business-
management ideas in one volume.
Often just giving new terms or new names to already established 
approaches rekindles interest in that approach. This is evident in the recent 
enthusiasm of using Japanese terms for American established terms. For 
example, using the word muda (the Japanese word for waste) or Kaizen 
(the Japanese term for continuous improvement) can revive the executive 
team’s interest because it is not viewed as the same old thing.
INTRODUCTION
To avoid any confusion, let’s start out by offering our basic operational 
definitions of Lean, Six Sigma, and Lean Six Sigma.
• Lean: The Lean methodology is an operational philosophy with a 
focus on identifying and eliminating all waste in an organization. 
Lean principles include zero inventory, batch to flow, cutting batch 
size, line balancing, zero wait time, pull instead of push production 
control systems, work area layout, time and motion studies, and 
cutting cycle time. The concepts are applied to production, support, 
and service applications. Lean focuses on eliminating waste from 
processes and increasing process speed by focusing on what cus­
tomers actually consider quality, and working backwards from that.

10  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Six Sigma: The Six Sigma methodology is a business-management 
strategy designed to improve the quality of process outputs by mini­
mizing variation and causes of defects in processes. It is a subset of 
the TQM methodology with a heavy focus on statistical applications 
used to reduce costs and improve quality. It sets up a special infra­
structure within the organization that is specifically trained in sta­
tistical methods and problem solution approaches that serve as the 
experts in these approaches. The two approaches that these experts 
use in their problem analysis and solution activities are Define, 
Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) and Define, 
Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV).
	
	
Six Sigma aims to eliminate process variation and make process 
improvements based on the customer definition of quality, and by 
measuring process performance and process change effects.
• Lean Six Sigma (LSS): The LSS methodology is an organization-
wide operational philosophy that combines two of today’s most 
popular performance improvement methodologies: Lean methods 
and the Six Sigma approach. The objective of these approaches is 
to eliminate nine kinds of wastes (classified as defects, overpro­
duction, transportation, waiting, inventory, motion, overprocess­
ing, underutilized employees, and behavior waste) and provide 
goods and services at a rate of 3.4 defects per million opportunities 
(DPMO).
Note:  Six Sigma, Lean, and LSS are all methodologies that contain a 
number of tools, techniques, and concepts that are designed to improve 
organizational performance.
Throughout this book, in keeping with common practice, the Six Sigma 
methodology, the Lean methodology, and the LSS methodology will also 
be referred to as just Six Sigma, Lean, and/or LSS.
It is important to note that Six Sigma, Lean, and LSS methodologies are all 
organization-wide operational philosophies/strategies with accountability 
and strategic focus. The real value of LSS starts to show when it is integrated 
with the organization’s strategic plan, helping to implement that plan with 
a focus on the end-use customers. In order to achieve the true benefits of 
LSS, projects will cross organizational boundaries and be focused on busi­
ness processes. Sustained strategic results can be achieved when this is done. 
When applied to a business process, the benefits obtained move the organi­
zation toward world-class performance in that business process.

Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methodology  •  11
At the heart of all successful LSS programs is an effective infrastructure 
that translates the strategic goals and activity areas of the organization into 
specific short-term action plans that maximize value and provide proper 
governance and management, along with the monitoring of results.
The Notion of Standing upon the Shoulders of Giants
A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a 
giant himself.
—Didacus Stella
This saying reminds us that for growth to occur, you grow from what has 
already been learned and/or created. If you ignore what has already been 
learned, at best you will get what has already been learned/created. On 
the other hand, if you learn from and start from what has already been 
done, then you can go farther. In our LSS leadership training that means 
we want clients to learn as much as possible from others’ experiences. We 
encourage them to study leadership through reading lots of books, audio 
books, book summaries, and through personal discussions with other 
leaders that they know. For our business ventures, that means we gather 
mentors (giants) that have already been successful in the LSS project ven­
ture that we are getting into, and to learn from what they have done—
learn from what is working or has worked for them, and learn from what 
did not work for them. This allows us to skip ahead in our own learning 
process and gives us a better chance for success.
LSS Cultural Building Blocks
All too often these methodologies are treated as a group of tools to be applied 
rather than a new cultural behavioral pattern that starts with the executive 
team. Too much focus has been applied to teaching the tools related to these 
methodologies in a two-level focus on embedding the Lean and Six Sigma 
cultures into the organization. As a result, these initiatives are often treated 
as projects where people are trained, problems are solved, and the immedi­
ate problem is put to bed while the organization goes back to business as 
usual. When this occurs, savings are short-lived and the problems that were 
put to bed soon wake up and have to be addressed again and again.
The person who makes the LSS methodology a success within an orga­
nization is not an LSS Black Belt (LSSBB) or even an LSS Master Black Belt 

12  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
(LSSMBB). The people who make LSS a success are the executives who 
will not be satisfied with any waste within the organization and who won’t 
allow anything but exceptionally good products and services to be pro­
vided within or as output from the organization he/she is responsible for. 
It is the executive who doesn’t have excellence as a goal, but as a standard 
of today’s performance for himself/herself and everyone within his/her 
organization, who is the ideal role model for the organization.
These are hard requirements to meet, but it’s what is required to be success­
ful in today’s highly competitive environment. LSS Green Belts (LSSGBs) 
and LSSBB can bring about significant changes and improvement in orga­
nizational performance, but these gains often last for only a short period of 
time unless there is a significant change in the fundamental culture within 
the organization. Business excellence in an organization encompasses the 
areas of strategic focus or intent, customer loyalty/advocacy, employee 
delight, and seamless process integration. All the business excellence mod­
els like Malcolm Baldrige, EFQM, etc., have these areas incorporated in 
their models in different ways. This handbook clearly shows how these 
tools, along with the analysis/reduction of constraints, inventive problem 
solving, and the importance of human behavior modifications like applied 
behavior analysis, among others, can be used effectively to build upon the 
shoulders of the TQM and quality management programs of the past.
Connecting the Tools with Engineering Goals
Each of the LSS tools has been often connected with well-known engineer­
ing goals, including cause-effect analysis, variability reduction, bottleneck 
reduction, waste reduction, and the theory of inventive problem solv­
ing, which has its roots in TRIZ. In fact, many of the tools have had their 
beginnings in the TQM programs of 20 years ago, which was adopted by 
a majority of the Fortune 1000 companies, a statistic that was validated by 
our 2002 survey, which showed that over 80% of the Six Sigma approaches 
were carryovers from the TQM methodology.
WHAT CAME FIRST—SIX SIGMA OR LEAN?
It may surprise you to learn that Lean came before Six Sigma. Since the 
very earliest production systems management has fought to eliminate 
waste. Near perfection, on the other hand, was not a requirement for most

consumers. Functionality for most consumers was the meet requirements 
quality standard that provided the maximum value (cost versus quality) 
to the consumer. The father of the Lean Production Systems, as we know 
them today, was Henry Ford Sr. There are very few of our products and 
methodologies that are truly breakthrough approaches. Almost all of our 
approaches are evolutionary rather than revolutionary. The Lean approach 
was born in the early 1990s with F.B. Gilbreth’s time and motion studies, 
where he believed that there was one best way of doing everything. This, 
in conjunction with Henry Ford Sr.’s Lean Production System, started the 
Lean focus. Toyota made use of this as a foundation and improved upon it 
to develop Toyota’s manufacturing system. Today’s approaches to Lean are 
based upon Toyota’s very successful manufacturing system.
In 1974 Motorola sold its TV production and design facilities to 
Matsushita, a Japanese manufacturer. Motorola had been one of the early 
developers of the TV concepts and one of the leading manufacturers under 
the brand name of Quasar Electronics, Inc. It promoted its TV as a TV 
with the work-center drawer for easy repair. Matsushita restructured the 
manufacturing process, applying Total Quality Control to it. As a result, 
internal and external defect rates and cost were decreased significantly. 
(See Figure 1.1.)
This major turnaround in the Quasar brand name reflected poorly on 
Motorola’s reputation. In addition, Motorola’s other operations were los­
ing market share at a very rapid rate. In 1981, William J. Weisz, Motorola’s 
COO, directed that all processes within the company should show a 
10-fold improvement within 5 years. To do this, Motorola embraced the 
TQM concept. In 1986 Weisz required all measurements to improve by

a factor of 10, this time in just 3 years. This called for a radical change in 
the way Motorola’s processes functioned. To bring about such a drastic 
change, Motorola implemented what it called the Six Sigma Program. The 
program set an objective for all processes to statistically perform at an 
error rate no greater than 3.4 errors per defect per million opportunities. 
Six Sigma Quality became popular in the United States immediately fol­
lowing Motorola winning the 1988 Malcolm Baldrige National Quality 
Award. The information package that Motorola distributed to explain its 
achievements stated: “To accomplish its quality and total customer sat­
isfaction goals, Motorola concentrated on several key operational initia­
tives. At the top of the list is Six Sigma Quality, a statistical measure of 
variance from a desired result. In concrete terms, Six Sigma translates 
into a target of no more than 3.4 defects per million opportunities. At the 
manufacturing end, this requires robust designs that accommodate rea­
sonable variation in component parts while providing consistently uni­
form final products. Motorola employees record the defects found in every 
function of the business and statistical technologies are made part of each 
and every employee’s job.”
Also during the early 1990s Motorola’s Six Sigma methodology was 
gaining momentum, as GE was promoting it as one of its major improve­
ment drivers. Although Six Sigma was originally designed as an approach 
to reduce variability, quality professionals and consultants added to the 
basic statistical approaches a number of additional techniques that focus 
on process improvement. (See Appendix C for a list of Six Sigma Green 
Belt tools.)
Motorola’s initial focus was on reducing variation in a single measure­
ment. (See Figure  1.2.) Although the concept of focusing on reducing

variation was a sound one, Motorola continued to lose a major portion of 
its market share. By the time GE embraced Six Sigma, it realized that the 
major gains from a performance improvement initiative would be reached 
by focusing on streamlining the processes by reducing cost and cycle time. 
As a result, the Six Sigma program was expanded to focus on setting new 
levels of performance. (See Figure 1.3.)
Along with this new emphasis came a new set of measurements focusing 
on cost reduction, decreased cycle time, inventory turns, etc. As a result, 
the basic Six Sigma approach of Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and 
Control (DMAIC) was modified with the addition of an approach of 
Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV). With Six Sigma 
roots based upon variation reduction and the manufacturing environment, 
many of the Lean tools became part of the Six Sigma body of knowledge.
With the economy in the United States changing from a production to 
a service economy, the focus on performance improvement transferred 
from the manufacturing process to the service and support areas in the 
early 1980s. This resulted in a great deal of focus on reviewing the sup­
port and service processes and redesigning them to make them more effi­
cient, effective, and adaptable. Process redesign methodologies roots stem 
from the poor-quality cost studies that IBM conducted in the indirect 
(support) areas during the 1970s. This evolved into the business process 
improvement methodologies that they developed during the early part 
of the 1980s. These approaches were further defined and developed by 
Ernst & Young and published in the 1991 book entitled Business Process 
Improvement—The Breakthrough Strategy for Total Quality Productivity 
and Competitiveness, published by McGraw-Hill, New York.

16  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Additional depth was added to the process improvement focus when 
Michael Hammer and James Champy published their 1993 book entitled 
Reengineering the Corporation, published by Harper Business, New York. 
The basis of these methodologies was the elimination of no-value-added 
(NVA) activities from these critical business processes. These approaches, 
which were developed to redesign or re-engineer processes, became key 
building blocks in the Six Sigma methodology during the 1990s.
The end result is that over the years Lean and Six Sigma have been viewed 
and utilized as distinctly separate methodologies to analyze and improve 
processes. Rather than employing them separately, however, many pro­
cess gurus now advocate a merger of the two for more dramatic process 
improvement. While we agree that this merger or marriage is valid, proj­
ect leaders of process improvement efforts that forcibly combine the two 
methodologies without understanding what they are trying to improve 
will achieve limited success. In the final analysis, process professionals 
must first understand their level of process maturity to choose the appro­
priate blend of Lean and Six Sigma methods and tools, and employ some 
type of hierarchy or Belt System to help make the marriage last.
TECHNICAL COMPETENCY LEVELS
Due to the heavy focus on statistical applications and extensive amount 
of time and training that was required to prepare individuals to use these 
tools, a unique organizational structure was established that allowed dif­
ferent titles to be used in support of the successful deployment at GE. It 
created an innovative recognition system called Black Belt Program to 
support its Six Sigma Quality Program. Individuals progressed through 
various expertise levels as follows:
• Blue Belts: Individuals who are trained in basic problem solving and 
team tools, thereby establishing a common improvement approach 
throughout the organization. All employees should be at a minimum 
at the Blue Belt level.
• Yellow Belts: Individuals who have been trained to perform as mem­
bers of Six Sigma Teams. They are used to collect data, participate in 
problem solving, and assist in the implementation of the individual 
improvement activities.

Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methodology  •  17
	
(Note: The Yellow Belt level was added on later to account for those 
who would become members of the Six Sigma Teams and assist with 
the process mapping, data gathering, brainstorming, communica­
tions, and implementation of solutions.)
• Green Belts: Individuals who have completed Six Sigma training, 
are capable of serving on Six Sigma project teams, and managing 
simple Six Sigma projects.
• Black Belts: Individuals who have had advanced training with 
specific emphasis on statistical applications and problem-solving 
approaches. These individuals are highly competent to serve as on-site 
consultants and trainers for application of Six Sigma methodologies.
• Master Black Belts: Individuals who have had extensive experience 
in applying Six Sigma and who have mastered the Six Sigma meth­
odology. In addition, these individuals should be capable of teaching 
the Six Sigma methodology to all levels of personnel and to deal with 
executive management in coaching them on culture change within 
the organization.
These definitions have changed over time. It’s now accepted that 
Green Belt training is different and less complex than Black Belt train­
ing. The same levels of expertise are used to distinguish background 
levels for LSS methodologies. Although the basic theory behind Six 
Sigma involved everyone in the organization, in many organizations 
that was not the case. In these organizations the Six Sigma initiative 
was made up of a few highly trained Green Belts or Black Belts whose 
total objective was to solve problems that would result in large savings 
to the organization. In many cases the Black Belts were expected to save 
the organization a minimum of $1 million a year or they would be re-
assigned. In these cases big improvement opportunities were acted upon 
and solved within 2 to 3 years and there was no need for the Black Belts’ 
service anymore. As these major problems were solved, many execu­
tives began to realize that everyone needed to focus on the elimination 
of waste, not just in the production areas, but also in the support areas. 
This has resulted in LSSGB and LSSBB becoming facilitators of waste 
reduction as well as problem solvers. It also focuses the organization on 
waste reduction versus reducing variation. (Note: LSS does not ignore 
measurement where it is required, but does not rely upon it absolutely 
as Six Sigma does.)

18  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Blue Belts keep the Six Sigma culture alive in the organization year after year.
LSS BELT LEVELS
LSS builds upon the technical competency structure that was developed 
for Six Sigma. The following are the competency titles and requirements 
related to the LSS methodology.
Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt (LSSMBB)
The standard practice is one Lean Six Sigma Master Black Belt (LSSMBB) 
for every 15 to 20 Lean Six Sigma Black Belts (LSSBBs) or one for the total 
organization, if the organization is less than 200 employees. The LSSMBB 
is a highly skilled project manager, who should be Project Management 
Institute certified. LSSMBBs are the heart of the organization’s LSS pro­
cess. They must be more skilled and experienced than regular LSSBBs. 
They should be experienced teachers and mentors who have mastered the 
LSS tools.
The LSSMBB is responsible for:
• Certifying LSSBB and Lean Six Sigma Green Belts (LSSGBs)
• Training LSSBBs and LSSGBs
• Developing new approaches
• Communicating best practices
• Taking action on projects that the LSSBB is having problems in 
defining the root causes and implementing the change
• Conducting long-term LSS projects
• Identifying LSS opportunities
• Reviewing and approving LSSBB and LSSGB project justifications 
and project plans
• Working with the executive team to establish new behavioral pat­
terns that reflect a Lean culture throughout the organization

Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methodology  •  19
Typically, an LSSMBB will interface with 15 to 20 LSSBBs to provide 
mentoring and development service in support of their problem-solving 
knowledge. When most organizations start an LSS process, they don’t 
have people who are experienced enough to take on the role of an LSSMBB 
even when they have completed the LSSBB and LSSMBB training.
Training alone does not provide the required experience that is needed 
to function as an LSSMBB. As a result, organizations normally hire a con­
sultant to serve as the LSSMBB for the first 6 to 12 months, and then they 
select one of the organization’s LSSBBs to undergo the additional LSSMBB 
training and experience for the subsequent projects. No LSSMBB can be 
successful unless he or she is able to influence the executive team to embrace 
Lean concepts resulting in a cultural change throughout the organization.
Lean Six Sigma Black Belt (LSSBB)
Lean Six Sigma Black Belts are the workhorses of the Lean Six Sigma System.
One LSSBB for every 100 employees is the standard practice. (Example: A 
small organization with only 100 employees needs only one LSSBB or two 
part-time LSSBBs.)
LSSBBs are highly skilled individuals who are effective problem solv­
ers and who have a very good understanding of the most frequently 
used statistical tools that are required to support the LSS system. Their 
responsibilities are to lead Lean Six Sigma Teams (LSSTs) and to define 
and develop the right people to coordinate and lead the LSS projects. 
Candidates for LSSBB should be experienced professionals who are 
already highly respected throughout the organization. They should have 
experience as a change agent and be very creative. LSSBBs should generate 
a minimum of US$1 million in savings per year as a result of their direct 
activities. LSSBBs are not coaches. They are specialists who solve problems 
and support the LSSGBs and LSSYBs. They are used as LSST managers/
leaders of complex, simple, and important projects. The position of LSSBB 
is a full-time job; he/she is assigned to train, lead, and support the LSST. 
They serve as internal consultants and instructors. They normally will 
work with two to four LSSTs at a time. The average LSSBB will complete a 

20  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
minimum of eight projects per year, which are led by the LSSBB himself/
herself or by the LSSGBs that they are supporting. The LSSBB assignment 
usually lasts for 2 years.
A typical LSSBB spends his/her time as follows:
• 35% running projects that he/she is assigned to lead
• 20% helping LSSGBs who are assigned to lead projects
• 20% teaching either formally or informally
• 15% doing analytical work
• 10% defining additional projects
The LSSBB must be skilled in the following six areas:
• Project management
• Leadership
• Analytical thinking
• Adult learning
• Organizational change management
• Statistical analysis
Most of LSSBB training focuses on analytical skills, so selecting the 
LSSBB often is based solely upon the candidate’s analytical interests. This 
is all wrong. Other traits to look for in selecting an LSSBB are:
• Trusted leader
• Self-starter
• Good listener
• Excellent communicator
• Politically savvy
• Has a detailed knowledge of the business
• Highly respected
• Understands processes
• Customer focused
• Passionate
• Excellent planner
• Holds to schedules
• Motivating
• Gets projects done on schedule and at cost
• Understands the organization’s strategy

Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methodology  •  21
• Excellent negotiation skills
• Embraces change
LSSBBs should be specialists, not coaches. It’s important to build a cadre 
of highly skilled LSSBBs. However, they shouldn’t be placed in charge of 
the managing and improvement process. LSSBBs are sometimes respon­
sible for managing individual projects, but not directing the overall 
improvement process; that should be the job of management.
For organizations that do not have an LSSMBB, the LSSBB is responsible 
for working with the executive team to bring about a cultural change in 
the organization where waste is not accepted and excellence is the stan­
dard for everyday operations.
The American Society for Quality (ASQ) recommends a 4-week class to 
train LSSBBs. Typical subjects that are covered are:
	
1.	Define and measure phase tools

	 43.	Mistake proofing
	 44.	Developing control plans
Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (LSSGB)
One Lean Six Sigma Green Belt (LSSGB) for every 20 employees and 5 
LSSGBs per every LSSBB is the standard practice. (Example: A small orga­
nization with 100 employees needs 1 LSSBB and 5 LSSGBs.)
Being an LSSGB is a part-time job. An LSSGB is assigned to manage a 
project or work as a member of an LSST by the LSS champion and his/
her manager. Sometimes an LSSGB is the manager of the area that is most 
involved in the problem. However, it is very difficult for managers to lead or 
even serve on an LSST unless they are relieved of their management duties. 
They will need to spend as much as 50% of their time working on the LSS 
project. In most cases, it is preferable that the LSSGB is a highly skilled 
professional who has a detailed understanding of the area that is involved 
in the problem. LSSGBs work as members of LSSTs that are led by LSSBBs 
or other LSSGBs. They also will form LSSTs when projects are assigned to 
them. When that happens, the LSSGB’s primary responsibility is to manage 
(coordinate) the project LSST’s activities during the entire product cycle. 

Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methodology  •  23
The LSSBB will support the LSSGB by providing just-in-time training to 
the project team when the LSSGB feels it is necessary. Normal LSST mem­
bers will receive some basic problem-solving and team orientation training 
before they are assigned to a LSST. When LSSGBs are leading a LSST, they 
should have at least 50% of their workload assigned to another individual.
A typical annual cycle for an LSSGB would be as follows:
• Six months as an LSST team member on two different LSSTs spend­
ing 25% of his/her time on the LSST projects
• Three months as an LSST team leader spending 50% of his/her time 
on the LSST project
• Three months not working on any Lean Six Sigma projects
LSSGBs are also expected to identify other LSS opportunities and bring 
them to management’s attention.
ASQ conducts a 2-week course on LSS for Green Belts. Typical subjects 
that are covered during this class include:
	
1.	Process mapping
	
2.	Introduction to Minitab
	
3.	Probability and basic statistics
	
4.	Rolled throughput yield
	
5.	Process capability
	
6.	Failure mode and effects analysis
	
7.	Basic tools
	
8.	Confidence intervals
	
9.	Measurement system analysis (gauge R&R)
	 10.	Hypothesis testing
	 11.	Project management
	 12.	Correlation and regression
	 13.	Analysis of variance
	 14.	Randomized blocks
	 15.	Design of experiments
	 16.	Full factorial experiments
	 17.	Acceptance sampling plans
	 18.	Statistical process control
	 19.	Control planning and application
	 20.	Mistake proofing

24  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt (LSSYB)
One Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt (LSSYB) for every five employees and four 
LSSYBs for every LSSGB is the standard practice. (Example: A small organi­
zation with 100 employees needs only 1 LSSBB, 5 LSSGBs, and 20 LSSYBs.)
LSSYBs will have a practical understanding of many of the basic 
problem-solving tools and the DMAIC methodology. Team members are 
usually classified as LSSYBs when they have completed the 2 or 3 days 
of LSSYB training and passed an LSSYB exam. They will work part-time 
on the project and still remain responsible for their normal work assign­
ments. However, they should have some of their workload re-assigned to 
give them time to work on the LSST. They usually serve as the expert and 
coordinator on the project for the area they are assigned to.
Lean Six Sigma Blue Belt
Blue Belts keep the Six Sigma culture alive in the organization year after year.
All employees should be trained as LSS Blue Belts as a standard practice. 
LSS Blue Belts are the normal workforce and may never be assigned to a 
LSST. However, they need to be part of the LSS culture and know how to 
apply LSS concepts to their day-to-day activities. They will receive 2 to 3 
days of training covering the following subjects:
• How teams function
• What the Six Sigma processes are about
• How Six Sigma applies to them
• How to define who their customers are
• The seven basic problem-solving tools
• How to flowchart their process
• Area activity analysis
• How to participate in the suggestion program
• How to participate in “quick and easy Kaizen”
It is very important to note that once the major problems and opportu­
nities have been addressed by the LSSTs, the organization’s LSS culture is 

Introduction to Lean Six Sigma Methodology  •  25
sustained through the LSS Blue Belts using area activity analysis, sugges­
tion programs, and quick and easy Kaizen.
LSS Blue Belt activities drive continuous improvement throughout the 
organization. Their efforts should result in a 5 to 15% improvement in all 
the organization’s measurements.
FIVE PHASES OF AN LSS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
There are five phases that an LSS improvement project must go through:
• Phase I: The selling phase
• Phase II: The planning and training phase
• Phase III: The rollout phase
• Phase IV: The measurement of results phase
• Phase V: Sustaining the concept and holding the gain phase
Phase V is a very difficult, but the most important, phase, and the one 
that has been the least successfully completed. With methodologies like 
TQM, Six Sigma, and LSS to have a lasting effect within any organization, 
it needs to change the habit patterns for the employees and management. 
It is easy for an individual to do the in thing. During the rollout phase the 
changes are very visible. Big successes are celebrated. Everyone is getting 
credit for helping to implement the project. But with time (i.e., 1 to 3 years) 
the excitement wears off. Management stops following up to see that the 
changes are still working. Disruption in the status quo forces everyone’s 
attention on other things, and the gains that were made through the LSS 
initiative begin to disappear. For example, we once visited a client to check 
on how the LSS initiative was still working 2 years after implementation. 
We were shocked to see that much of the effort that was put in to making 
the transformation was wasted. The in-boxes in the support area that were 
completely empty at the end of the day 2 years ago are now piled high with 
paper. The production area that was spotlessly clean is now in disarray and 
dirty. And this was just a superficial view that any observer would notice. 
Without continuous focus on the elimination of waste it is awfully easy for 
management and the employees to slip back into their old bad habits.
This handbook focuses on the tools and techniques that make up the 
tools of the trade for LSSGBs and LSSBBs. But the most difficult part of 

26  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
the job for these highly trained technical people is mastering the organi­
zational change management methodology that is required to transform 
the culture within the organization to one where waste of any kind is not 
tolerated and excellence is accepted as meets requirements. Success for an 
LSSBB or an LSSMBB is not measured by the dollars saved—that is only a 
temporary measurement. The real measurement of the success of the LSS 
program is a permanent change in the culture within the organization.
SUMMARY
Lean Six Sigma is a lifetime commitment. If you are not ready to make this 
commitment, don’t waste the organization’s money by trying to implement 
Lean Six Sigma.
—H. James Harrington
The process of incorporating LSS as a key component of an organiza­
tion’s change infrastructure requires more than just training, for it takes 
a strong infrastructure built to support all projects and change initiatives 
from the ground up. LSS programs, when all is said and done, are a path 
to business excellence.
As we have discussed in this chapter covering the marriage of Lean 
and Six Sigma, both approaches have a few shortcomings that were espe­
cially evident a few years ago, before so many previous programs merged 
into the LSS program as we know it today. As a result, LSS evolved, get­
ting stronger than some of the “giants” that had come before it.
Lean Six Sigma is like a river of change, with the bridge being a change in 
attitude rather than a change in the way something is done.

It is no secret that the 21st-century business environment is changing rap­
idly. The present environment is more competitive than it was in the past, 
with competition coming from both domestic and international global 
sources. In addition, there is increased emphasis on the quality of the 

28  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
products and services that businesses provide to their customers. Because 
of these changes, many businesses are discovering that the old ways of 
doing business no longer work so well. Many businesses have found it nec­
essary to re-evaluate their corporate goals, procedures, and support struc­
ture. In one such corporate re-evaluation, the discovery that the support 
structure was not keeping pace with the changes led to the development of 
a management approach known as process improvement (PI). PI empha­
sizes both quality and excellence. It looks at the function of business man­
agement on the basis of processes rather than organizational structure.
AN LSS QUALITY FOCUS ON THE BUSINESS PROCESS
In 1978 many large manufacturers had relatively stable product lines that 
were offered through two or maybe three marketing channels, and usually 
shipped through one distribution channel. By 1994, however, manufactur­
ers had almost tripled their number of products, offering them through 
seven or more marketing channels and shipping them through four to 
five distribution channels. Such rapid growth is not unusual in many 
organizations.
Due in large part to such growth, many corporations found that their 
sales representatives were spending far more time on administrative details 
and paperwork. In fact, the productive sales time of the corporation’s mar­
keting staff had dropped from an average of 40% in 1978–1980 to only 5% 
in 1994! Why? What could have caused this change? Compared to simi­
lar periods in the past, the corporation’s growth rate was unprecedented. 
Moreover, systems and procedures that were adequate in 1978 were clearly 
out-of-date by 1994. More products meant more procedures, more com­
plexity, and more internal competition for limited resources—human and 
other. In turn, this meant an even greater workload for an already strained 
support structure.
In addition, the company’s various operating units were struggling to 
meet their own objectives, with little or no attention to the relationship 
of their work product to that of any other operating unit in the business. 
Driven partly by the resulting problems and partly by a re-emphasis on 
quality, corporate management decided to act. It provided the leadership 
and set the tone for making the needed changes by introducing the con­
cept of process management in the corporate-wide instruction. Figure 2.1 
shows the first page of a sample corporate instruction with an LSS focus.

SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS
A corporate instruction like that in Figure 2.1 is important because it 
demonstrates top management commitment to LSS and provides basic 
guidelines for implementation. This philosophy is based primarily on 
SUBJECT:  Lean Six Sigma Quality Focus on the Business Process
OBJECTIVE:
The objective of a Lean Six Sigma Quality Focus on the process is to improve the 
operational effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability of corporate business processes.
BACKGROUND:
A key requirement for the achievement of our corporate goals is the ability of our busi­
ness processes to meet the changing needs of the business. The traditional approach 
of managing through key business indicators has proven valuable, as has the focus on 
functional productivity. However, the rate of change created by growth and diversity 
now calls for increased attention to the effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability of the 
business processes. This is to be accomplished through quality management. 
CONCEPT:
Quality Management Lean Six Sigma consists of methodical approach to remove 
defects from an organization’s processes and to improve its efficiency. It includes 
an understanding of supplier and customer requirements, process definition, defect 
measurement, root cause removal, and adapting the process to assure relevancy to 
business needs. It has been successfully applied in our corporation to improve both 
product and non-product processes.
Our Lean business operations can be characterized as a set of interrelated processes 
(e.g. Billing, Distribution, Accounting, etc.). Most business processes consist of sub-
processes (e.g. Purchase Billing within Billing, Ship-to-Plan Distribution within 
Distribution, Inventory, Accounting within Accounting, etc.).
Each corporate operating unit will apply quality management to its key functional 
and cross-functional processes. Line management will define and own these pro­
cesses. They will have responsibility for and authority over the process results. An 
executive is named as the single process owner and must operate at a level high enough 
in the organization to:
• Identify the impact of new business direction on the process.
• Influence change in policy/procedures affecting the process.
• Commit a plan and implement change for process improvement.
• Monitor business process effectiveness and efficiency.
FIGURE 2.1

30  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
the following statement in the corporate instruction: “Our business 
operations can be characterized as a set of interrelated processes.”
LSS seeks to focus management attention on the fundamental processes 
that, when taken together, actually drive the organization. Figure 2.1 also 
introduces several important terms that are key to the LSS process improve­
ment approach. Among these are customer, requirements, and quality.
Definition: A customer is any user of the business process’s output. 
Although we usually think of customers as those to whom the cor­
poration sells a product or service, most customers of business pro­
cesses actually work within the same corporation and do not actually 
buy the corporation’s products or services.
Definition: Requirements are the statement of customer needs and 
expectations that a product or service must satisfy.
Definition: Quality means conformance to customer requirements. In 
other words, since requirements represent the customer’s needs and 
expectations, a quality focus on the business process asks that every 
business process meet the needs of its customers.
Definition: A business process is the organization of people, equipment, 
energy, procedures, and material into the work activities needed 
to produce a specified end result (work product). It is a sequence 
of repeatable activities that have measurable inputs, value-added 
activities, and measurable outputs. Some major business processes 
are the same in almost all businesses and similar organizations. 
Some typical business processes are listed in Table 2.1. Of course, 
some business processes are unique to a particular business and may 
be industry related. For example, steelmaking obviously has some 
processes, such as the foundry or slag disposal, not found in other 
industries.
OBJECTIVES OF PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
Process improvement is a disciplined management approach. It applies 
prevention methodologies to implement and improve business processes 
in order to achieve the process management objectives of effectiveness, 

Process Improvement and Lean Six Sigma  •  31
efficiency, and adaptability. These are three more key LSS terms intro­
duced in Figure 2.1.
• An effective process produces output that conforms to customer 
requirements (the basic definition of quality). The lack of process 
effectiveness is measured by the degree to which the process output 
does not conform to customer requirements (that is, by the output’s 
degree of defect). This is LSS’s first aim—to develop processes that 
are effective.
• An efficient process produces the required output at the lowest pos­
sible (minimum) cost. That is, the process avoids waste or loss of 
resources in producing the required output. Process efficiency is 
measured by the ratio of required output to the cost of producing 
that output. This cost is expressed in units of applied resources (dol­
lars, hours, energy, etc.). This is LSS’s second aim—to increase pro­
cess efficiency without loss of effectiveness.
• An adaptable process is designed to maintain effectiveness and effi­
ciency as customer requirements and the environment change. The 
process is deemed adaptable when there is agreement among the 
suppliers, owners, and customers that the process will meet require­
ments throughout the strategic (3- to 5-year outlook) period. This 
is LSS’s third aim—to develop processes that can adapt to change 
without loss of effectiveness and efficiency.

CROSS-FUNCTIONAL FOCUS
Essential to the success of the process management approach is the con­
cept of cross-functional focus, one of the few truly unique concepts of 
the LSS approach. Cross-functional focus is the effort to define the flow 
of work products according to their sequence of activities, independent 
of functional or operating-unit boundaries. In other words, LSS recog­
nizes that a department or similar operating unit is normally respon­
sible for only a part of a business process. A cross-functional focus 
permits you to view and manage a process as a single entity, or as the 
sum of its parts.
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
While not altogether unique, the concept of critical success factors also 
plays an important role in the LSS approach. Critical success factors are 
those few key areas of activity in which favorable results are absolutely 
necessary for the process to achieve its objectives. In other words, criti­
cal success factors are the things that must go right or the entire process 
will fail. For example, payroll as a process has numerous objectives and 
performs many activities, but certainly its primary objective is to deliver 
paychecks on time. If payroll fails to deliver checks on time, it has failed 
in its major purpose, even if all its other objectives are met. Therefore, on-
time check delivery is the most critical success factor for payroll. Payroll 
has other critical success factors, but these are invariably less important. 
In implementing LSS, it is important to identify and prioritize the criti­
cal success factors of the process and then to use the LSS methodology to 
analyze and improve them in sequence.
NATURE OF LSS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT
In addition to the key concepts just introduced, LSS uses many accepted 
standards of management and professional excellence. Among these stan­
dards are:

Process Improvement and Lean Six Sigma  •  33
• Management leadership
• Professionalism
• Attention to detail
• Excellence
• Basics of quality improvement
• Measurement and control
• Customer satisfaction
What is new in process management is the way LSS applies these stan­
dards to the core concepts of ownership and cross-functional focus. In the 
following chapters the key elements of managing a process are introduced 
and topics already introduced are elaborated. However, it should be noted 
that identifying and defining a business process almost always precedes 
the selection of the process owner. That is, you first identify the process, 
and then you identify the right person to own it. This seemingly out-of-
sequence approach is taken in order to firmly establish and reinforce the 
key concepts of LSS before getting into how-to-do-it details.
Advantages of LSS Process Improvement
Management styles and philosophies abound within the framework 
of LSS. There are some similarities to such approaches as value stream 
management, participative management, excellence teams, and manage­
ment by objectives. That is not unusual, since all of these approaches are 
based on the management standards mentioned earlier. However, LSS has 
advantages that make it both useful and relatively easy to implement:
• LSS, through its cross-functional focus, identifies true business pro­
cesses. It bypasses functional and operating-unit boundaries that 
may have little to do with the actual process or that may obscure the 
view of the overall process.
• LSS, through its emphasis on critical success factors, gives early 
and consistent attention to the essential activities of the process. It 
provides a means of prioritizing so that less important activities are 
identified, but action on them is delayed until the more important 
ones have been addressed.
• LSS improves process flow by requiring the total involvement of sup­
pliers, owners, and customers, and by assuring that they all have the 
same understanding of process requirements.

34  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• LSS is more efficient than other methods in that it can be implemented 
process by process. It does not require simultaneous examination 
and analysis of all of a corporation’s processes. With management 
leadership and guidance, workers implement LSS within their pro­
cess while continuing their regular duties.
DETERMINING PROCESS OWNERSHIP
As previously described, the nature of business processes is how they 
often cross organizational boundaries. It is important to describe pro­
cess ownership, show how the process owner is selected, and describe the 
responsibilities and authority of the process owner. LSS stresses a cross-
functional focus instead of the traditional hierarchy-of-management 
approach. LSS requires a process owner with authority to cross func­
tional or operating-unit boundaries in order to ensure the overall success 
of the process.
Because the role of the process owner is at the heart of LSS, it is extremely 
important that top management understand and accept the principles 
presented in this chapter. Without the active support of top management, 
the process owner cannot function properly, and thus LSS will fail.
Selection of a process owner follows the identification and definition 
of the process, which is covered later. The purpose in discussing process 
ownership first is to give a broad portrayal of the environment over which 
the owner must have authority and responsibility. This, in turn, will pro­
vide an understanding of process improvement that is far more compre­
hensive than any simple definition of the term.
The Nature of Business Processes
By definition, LSS emphasizes the management of organizational processes, 
not business operating units (departments, divisions, etc.). Although a set 
of activities that comprise a process may exist entirely within one operat­
ing unit, a process more commonly crosses operating-unit boundaries. In 
LSS, a process is always defined independently of operating units.
Management’s Traditional Focus
The traditional management of a business process has been portrayed in 
the form of an organization (pyramid) chart. This “chain of command” 

Process Improvement and Lean Six Sigma  •  35
management hierarchy has worked very well for many corporations over 
the years. So why does LSS seem to question this traditional approach? 
Actually, the traditional approach is not being questioned so much as it 
is being redirected. Process ownership is intended not as a replacement 
of the traditional organizational structure, but as a complement to it, a 
complement with a specific goal. The goal is to address the fact that the 
traditional structure often fosters a somewhat narrow approach to manag­
ing the whole business.
Typically, a manager’s objectives are developed around those of some 
operating unit of the business in which he or she is working at the moment. 
This emphasis on operating-unit objectives may create competition rather 
than cooperation within the business as a whole as managers vie for the 
resources to accomplish those objectives. With rare exceptions, these 
managers are responsible for only a small portion of the larger processes 
that, collectively, define a particular business in its entirety. Examples of 
these major business processes are shown in Table 2.1. In addition, the rec­
ognition and rewards system is almost always tied directly to the degree 
of success achieved in the pursuit of those operational objectives. So there 
is no particular motivation for managers to tie their personal goals to the 
larger—and more important—process goals. LSS seeks to address these 
common deficiencies through the concept of process ownership.
Cross-Functional Focus
In one large manufacturing corporation an internal review of its special/
custom features (S/CF) process disclosed some serious control weaknesses 
and identified the lack of ownership as the major contributing cause. 
(S/CFs are devices that can be either plant or field installed to modify 
other equipment for some specialized task.) The S/CF process was a multi-
million-dollar business in its own right and touched almost every other 
department in the corporation—order entry, manufacturing, inventory 
control, distribution, billing, service, and so on. Yet the review found that 
the process had no central owner—no one person who was responsible for 
the process from initial order to final disposition, no one who provided 
overall direction and a cohesive strategy for this cross-functional process.
Because business processes such as S/CF cross operating-unit lines, the 
management of these processes cannot be left entirely to the managers 
of the various departments within the process. With no one in overall 
charge of the S/CF process, the disruption caused by lost orders, incorrect 

36  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
shipping, and wrong billings is difficult to eliminate. Each manager can 
pass the buck, saying someone else is responsible. No one manager has the 
authority to solve process-wide problems.
If no one person is in charge of the S/CF process flow shown in Figure 2.2, the 
success of the process depends on the four managers of the four departments, 
for whom S/CF may be only a minor task in their departments. However, if 
one person is in charge, he or she can view the process with a cross-functional 
focus, emphasizing the process rather than the departments. The figure shows 
an owner’s cross-functional perspective of the S/CF process.
PROCESS OWNERSHIP
As shown above, process management requires an understanding of the 
fundamental importance of cross-functional focus. Clearly, there is a need 
to have someone in charge of the entire process—a process owner. While 
this chapter deals primarily with ownership of the major processes and 
sub-processes of a business, the concept of ownership applies at every level 
of the business. For example, the purchasing process can be broken down 
into various levels of components, such as competitive bidding and the 
verification of goods and services received. The components of a process 
are examined further in Section 2.
Because business processes often cross functional or operating-unit 
boundaries, it is generally true that no one manager is responsible for the 
entire process. LSS addresses this point through another unique concept—
process ownership.

The Process Owner
The process owner is the manager within the process who has responsibil­
ity and authority for the overall process results. The process owner assumes 
these duties in addition to his or her ongoing functional or operating-unit 
duties, and is supported by a PMC, described below. The process owner is 
responsible for the entire process, but does not replace managers of depart­
ments containing one or more process components. Each component con­
tinues to exist within its own function or operating unit and continues to 
be managed by the managers of that function or operating unit.
Normally, the term process owner is used in connection with major business 
processes, either corporate-wide (for example, the general manager of a plant 
owns the process of manufacturing a particular product). On a practical level, 
however, an executive is often somewhat removed from the day-to-day opera­
tion of the process. Consequently, it has been found useful to implement a 
two-tier approach, in which the executive (vice president of finance) is referred 
to as the focus owner, and a subordinate, but still high-level, manager (for 
example, the controller) is referred to as the functional owner. In general, the 
functional owner has all the authority and responsibility of the focus owner 
except for the ultimate responsibility for the success of the process.
The Process Management Committee
Headed by the focus owner, the PMC is a group of managers who col­
lectively share the responsibilities related to the committee’s mission. The 
committee has the following characteristics:
• All process activities are represented.
• The senior/top manager of the parent function for each activity is 
a member.
• The members are peer level, to the degree possible.
In practice, an owner should never be a lower-level manager than other 
members of the committee. When differences of opinion arise, a lower-
level owner would have difficulty exercising his or her authority.
The mission of the PMC is to:
• Steer and direct the process toward quality objectives
• Support and commit the assignment of resources
• Ensure that requirements and measurements are established
• Resolve conflicts over objectives, priorities, and resources

38  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
The PMC mission can be expanded to accommodate unique process 
conditions. Issues related to the PMC mission are raised by the functional 
owner when, as often happens, he or she has been unable to resolve the 
issue with the Process Quality Team, discussed below. It is important for 
the credibility and effectiveness of the functional owner that issues raised 
to the focus owner and PMC be addressed and resolved promptly.
The Process Quality Team
Headed by the functional owner, the Process Improvement Team (PIT) is 
made up of lower-level managers. Preferably, they are peers of the func­
tional owner and work for members of the PMC. The members of the PIT 
are the designated implementers of process management actions, which 
are to:
• Establish the basics of process quality management
• Conduct ongoing activities to ensure process effectiveness, efficiency, 
and adaptability
The functional owner and the PIT may be unable to resolve some issue, such 
as resource allocation, expense reductions, or process change. In that case, the 
issue should be brought to the focus owner for resolution through the PMC.
SELECTION, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND 
AUTHORITY OF THE PROCESS OWNER
The rest of this chapter covers process owner selection, responsibilities, 
and authority. It concentrates on the role of the focus owner, but adds 
perspective on the PMC and the functional owner as well. But first, it is 
important to remember that all three elements—selection, responsibilities, 
and authority—are needed. A process owner, with detailed and specific 
responsibilities (which will be described shortly), cannot function without 
commensurate authority. Just as important, all of the concerned parties 
within the process must be made aware of both the owner’s role and their 
own. And once ownership is established, in all its elements, the owner must 
get ongoing and visible support from both executive and peer managers.

Process Improvement and Lean Six Sigma  •  39
Selection of the Process Owner
As mentioned earlier, process ownership is not intended to override the 
existing management structure. The process owner is defined, in part, 
as a manager within the process. The process owner continues in his or 
her current position, and simply takes on additional duties as head of the 
overall process. The other managers within the process become members 
of the PMC. Top management normally appoints the process owner. The 
question of which manager to choose as the process owner can often be 
answered by applying two words: most and best. That is, which manager in 
the process has the most resources invested, does the most work, feels the 
most pain when things go wrong, gets the most benefit/gain/credit when 
things go right? Which manager has the best chance of affecting or influ­
encing positive change—perhaps because he or she is in the best position 
to do so?
For the most part, answers to these questions should clearly iden­
tify the best candidate for the ownership role. At the very least, the 
answers should narrow the field, in which case, the concept of critical 
success factors comes into play once again. That is, of the remaining 
candidates, which one currently manages the activities most critical 
to the success of the overall process? In addition, the process owner 
should be acknowledged as having the personal and professional quali­
ties necessary for the job and a track record to accompany them. He or 
she should be comfortable dealing at high levels, be able to create and 
execute a plan, be a skilled negotiator successful at gaining consensus, 
and be a team player.
Responsibilities of the Process Owner
In general, the process owner is responsible for making sure that the process 
is effective, efficient, and adaptable, and as discussed in later chapters, for 
getting it certified. More specifically, Figure 2.3 lists the 12 responsibilities of 
a process owner, above and beyond that person’s normal job responsibilities.
It is also important for the process owner to create an environment in 
which defect prevention is the most highly regarded “quality” attribute. 
In many enterprises it is all too common to find that the most visible 
rewards go to the “troubleshooters” or “problem fixers.” Those individuals 
who consistently strive for defect-free results often go unrecognized and 
unrewarded.

40  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Authority of the Process Owner
Given the key elements of ownership selection, it is obvious that the pro­
cess owner already has a great deal of inherent authority within the pro­
cess. That is, if a manager meets all or most of the selection criteria, he or 
she is probably already in a fairly authoritative position in the process. 
Nevertheless, the issue of authority cannot be taken for granted. The pro­
cess owner must have the right combination of peer and top management 
support to get the job done. Top management provides the greatest contri­
bution by validating the owner’s authority through various forms of direct 
and indirect concurrence and support, including the following six areas:
	
1.	Approving resource allocation
	
2.	Financing the process
	
3.	Providing recognition for the owner
	
4.	Running interference
	
5.	Cutting the red tape
	
6.	Backing the focus owner or functional owner when issues have to 
be escalated
	
1.	 Determine and document process requirements and secure customer concurrence.
	
2.	 Define the sub-process, including information used by the process.
	
3.	 Designate line management ownership over each sub-process.
	
4.	 Identify implementers and assure application of quality management principles.
	
5.	 Ensure documentation of task-level procedures.
	
6.	 Identify critical success factors and key dependencies in order to meet the needs 
of the business during the tactical and strategic timeframe.
	
7.	 Establish measurements and set targets to monitor and continuously improve 
process effectiveness and efficiency.
	
8.	 Rate the process/sub-process against defined quality standards and control 
criteria.
	
9.	 Report process status and results.
	
10.	 Identify and implement changes to the process to meet the needs of the business.
	
11.	 Ensure that information integrity exists throughout the process, including integ­
rity of measurements at all levels.
	 12.	 Resolve or escalate cross-functional issues.
FIGURE 2.3
Ownership responsibilities.

Process Improvement and Lean Six Sigma  •  41
It is not enough for the process owner to have the necessary authority, 
however. All concerned parties within the process must clearly under­
stand the authority being vested in the process owner. The process owner 
can first be told of his or her responsibilities and authority through a per­
formance plan or job description. The next step is a formal announcement 
or, at the very least, an announcement to all managers throughout the pro­
cess. If necessary, or if considered helpful, the PMC can create a written 
agreement defining and clarifying the various relationships. However it is 
done, there must be clear communication to all concerned parties regard­
ing who has been selected, what authority is being vested in that manager, 
and what that manager’s responsibilities are. And top management must 
continue to support the process owner by doing whatever necessary to 
show that the owner’s authority is real. Only with this sort of strong, con­
tinuing support from senior management can LSS work.
PROCESS DEFINITION AND THE PROCESS MODEL
Once the focus owners of major business processes are identified, the existing 
managers within the process would begin to define and model the lower-
level processes and sub-processes. This is accompanied by meeting in logical 
work groups from within the major process. For example, within the major 
process of finance, logical groups may include accounting managers for the 
lower-level accounting process and payroll managers for the lower-level pay­
roll process.
A process model is a detailed representation of the process as it currently 
exists. When preparing the model, it is important to avoid the tempta­
tion to describe the process as it should be, or as one would like it to be. 
The model may be written, graphic, or mathematical. The model can take 
several forms, but the preferable, recommended form is a process flow­
chart, described in Section 2. Whatever form is used, the model must con­
tain supporting textual documentation, such as a manual or a set of job 
descriptions.
The definition of a business process must clearly identify the following:
	
1.	The boundaries of the process and all of its components
	
2.	All of the suppliers and customers of the process and the inputs and 
outputs for each

42  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
	
3.	The requirements for the process suppliers and from the process 
customers
	
4.	The measurements and controls used to insure conformance to 
require­ments
The model and supporting documentation are used as the base tools for 
analyzing how the process can be simplified, improved, or changed.
Definition of Process Mission and Scope
The first thing to be done, once ownership has been established, is to define 
the mission, or purpose, of the process, and to identify the process scope. But 
defining the mission and identifying the scope are not as easy as they sound. 
The mission of a process is its purpose—what the process is in existence to 
do. The mission clearly identifies exactly what the process does, from begin­
ning to end, especially for someone not working within the process; the mis­
sion also describes how the process helps to attain the corporate goals.
The mission statement does not have to be lengthy or elaborate. It should 
be concise and to the point. Figure 2.4 shows a mission statement for a 
procurement process.
The scope of a business process is defined by identifying where the process 
begins and ends. These are the boundaries of the process. By identifying the 
boundaries, you identify the scope, just as boundaries tell you how much land 
a piece of property covers. There may be disagreements over the exact scope 
of a process. Such a disagreement might occur, for example, over whether a 
particular activity is the last activity of one process or the first activity of the 
next process. In settling disagreements about the scope of a process, it helps 
to identify the process whose mission is most clearly related to the activity in 
question. It may also require the help of some of the customers and suppliers 
of the process. Most importantly, you should concentrate on how the activity 
in question affects, or is affected by, the critical success factors of the process. 
As you remember, critical success factors are those few, key areas of activity 
that must succeed in order for the entire process to achieve its goals.
MISSION OF THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS
The procurement process covers how “off the shelf” parts, equipment, or supplies 
are purchased from external suppliers.
FIGURE 2.4
Mission statement: Procurement process.

Process Improvement and Lean Six Sigma  •  43
To define the scope of a process, then, all parties must agree on the 
answers to four questions:
	
1.	Where does the process start?
	
2.	What does the process include?
	
3.	What does the process not include?
	
4.	Where does the process end?
The question of what a process does not include should be addressed 
even if there appears to be complete agreement on what it does include. 
Often, when discussing what the process includes, people make assump­
tions. (For example, if the process includes X, it must include Y and cannot 
include Z.) Only by agreeing on what the process does not include can you 
be sure that you have avoided making any such assumptions.
Even in well-established processes, there often is disagreement on answers 
to these four questions. Moreover, the questions deal only with a broad 
overview of the scope. The task of a process definition gets more complex 
later on as you detail all of the activities and tasks that go on within the 
process. That is another reason for beginning the definition of mission and 
scope by focusing on critical success factors. The mission and scope should 
both be written by the owner and the team. Neither has to be elaborate.

written by an accounts receivable group. Figure 2.6 shows the mission

The accounts receivable process includes the following:
• Collection or other settlement of customer accounts.
• Accurate maintenance of customer accounts.
• Assessment of the credit worthiness of customers.
• Initiation and/or processing of credit notes.
• Preparation of regular reports for staff action.
• Notification to management of out-of-line situations.
• Monitoring resolution of management directives.
The accounts receivable process ends when the invoice is cleared and the accounts 
receivable system is appropriately updated.

SUMMARY
This chapter has given you a general introduction to LSS and its connec­
tion to process improvement. Process improvement has been the focus of 
quality initiatives since the 1970s. Initially the focus was on manufactur­
ing processes, but as the service industry became a major driver of the 
nation’s revenue stream and the overhead costs in any production organi­
zation exceeded the direct labor costs, emphasis shifted to business pro­
cess improvement. In the 1980s organizations like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, 
Boeing, and AT&T developed programs to make step function improve­
ments in their business processes, resulting in decreasing costs of the busi­
ness processes as much as 90%, while decreasing cycle time from months 
to days or even hours. Methodologies like benchmarking, business pro­
cess improvement, process redesign, and process re-engineering became 
the tools of the trade for the process improvement engineer during the 
1990s. This focus on process improvement was driven by the realization 
MISSION AND SCOPE OF THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS
• The procurement process covers how “off the shelf” parts, equipment, or supplies 
are purchased from external suppliers.
• The process begins when a requestor submits a purchase requisition.
• The process then includes part requisition, requisition processing, vendor build, 
Information Systems support, and receiving/shipping.
• The process does not include inspection for concealed damage, shortages, or 
shipment errors, nor does it include payment of the vendor invoice.
• The process ends when the requested part is delivered to the requestor.

that most of the major processes within an organization run across func­
tions, and that optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of an individual 
function’s part of these processes often resulted in sub-optimizing the 
process as a whole.
The designers of the LSS methodology recognized early in the cycle the 
importance of focusing upon process improvement and, as a result, incor­
porated the best parts of the methodologies that were so effectively used 
in the 1980s and 1990s. Throughout this chapter we pointed out how LSS 
has built upon the business process improvement techniques used in the 
1980s and 1990s, modifying them to meet the high-tech, rapid changing 
environments facing organizations in the 21st century.
In most organizations there is a bigger opportunity for improvement in 
streamlining their processes than there is in solving their problems.

The Lean Journey into 
Process Improvement
INTRODUCTION
Every accomplishment starts with a decision to try.
—Gail Devers
Three-time Olympic champion, track and field
Understanding and implementing Lean and LSS is often referred to as 
a journey. The word journey has been aptly chosen since it implies that 
this transformation is neither quick nor easy. It can also describe changes 
that occur in individuals, departments, functional areas, divisions, and 
the entire organization during the LSS learning experience. First, for the 
individual, it can be described as an evolution in your way of learning and 
thinking. We learn to better understand our processes. We learn about 
our fellow employees. Ultimately, we learn about ourselves and how we 
approach our job. For departments or functional areas, the journey has 
more to do with getting a collective group of individuals to arrive at a com­
mon understanding of the improvement process and working together to 

52  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
achieve it. Finally, for organizations, the journey has to do with promot­
ing a culture where individuals, departments, divisions, and suppliers can 
come together with a common set of beliefs and behaviors that are focused 
on improving performance for customers.
This journey starts with the individual—you. It can take on an exciting 
and almost mystical meaning. What will we encounter on the way? What 
new things will we learn and experiences will we have? What unknowns 
will we encounter and how will we face those? All of these are present dur­
ing the change management that occurs when we commit to adopting a 
LSS philosophy. Let the journey begin!
This section includes three chapters that will become the fundamen­
tal building blocks for what you will experience and learn. In Chapter 3, 
“Waste Identification,” you will be introduced to a new meaning of what 
waste is and how to identify it. In Chapter 4, “Lean Concepts, Tools, and 
Methods” you will be introduced to new ways of thinking about your pro­
cesses and the activities required to complete those value-added processes. 
In Chapter 5, “Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin,” 
you will be introduced to the process of change plus improve. In this chap­
ter we tie it all together by defining three specific improvement approaches 
to show you how to focus on the identified wastes with newly learned ways 
of thinking and apply the concepts and tools to achieve new levels of per­
sonal and organization performance. Think of each of these chapters as 
companions in your daily work life. The true LSS practitioner carries these 
companions wherever he/she goes. With each new experience you become 
more proficient at recognizing waste. With every use of the concepts or 
tools, you become more familiar with their use. With every change in your 
processes, you become more open to change and more comfortable and 
confident in your ability to produce positive change with LSS. You begin 
to apply the sequence of see the waste, understand the LSS concepts, and 
apply the tools, so effortlessly; it becomes second nature.
Together these chapters are about learning, changing, and improving. 
They describe concepts, tools, and activities that will allow us to change 
how we think and how we act. Once completed, our hope is that your 
point of view will be irreversibly changed. Oliver Wendell Holmes once 
said, “Man’s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its origi­
nal dimension.” He was telling us that every experience we have expands 
our understanding of our surroundings. Once our mind entertains a 
new idea, it cannot remain the same. This is the essence of becoming an 
LSS organization—a learning organization that (1) observes processes

differently, (2) identifies weaknesses in these processes, (3) conducts bet­
ter measurements to quantify where we are, and (4) constantly improves, 
adapts, and changes processes to better meet customer needs. These three 
chapters define a learning and improvement cycle that can be adopted by 
employees at all levels of the organization.
OVERVIEW
In Section 2 we undertake a significant challenge—to blend Lean and Six 
Sigma into an integrated synergistic approach to process improvement. 
This approach can be readily understood and applied regardless of com­
pany size or industry type. One of the primary challenges for organiza­
tions is how do we integrate Lean with Six Sigma. How do the concepts 
and tools of each process improvement philosophy mesh? In a rudimentary 
definition, Lean is identifying and eliminating waste, while Six Sigma is 
identifying and eliminating variation. Lean uses predominantly Kaizen as 
an instrument of improvement. Six Sigma uses the DMAIC and DMADV 
methodologies.
The concepts and tools in Section 2 are presented in the sequential order 
of the learning and change management process. Most of these tools are 
first defined, then you are instructed on how to use them, and next you are 
provided with examples of how they have been used before. The contents 
of Section 2 are:
• Chapter 3, which describes the nature of waste, is dependent on our 
reference point. One person may consider something wasteful, while 
the next may consider the very same thing essential to complete the 
job. So which is correct? How do we identify what is truly waste? To 
understand this, we need a new understanding of how to classify 
waste and what activities produce waste in our organization.
	
	
In Chapter 3 we present several topics:
• What is waste?
• What is variation?
• Value-added activities
• No-value-added activities
• The power of observation
• Nine wastes

• Chapter 4 describes a fundamental understanding of Lean concepts 
and tools. This new understanding is critical to successfully apply 
Kaizen improvement and change management philosophies (cov­
ered in Chapter 5). When I was growing up, my dad attempted to 
teach me some concepts to live by, using familiar quotations. One 
of his favorites was, “Knowing where you are going is all you need 
to get there.” The Lean concepts presented in the chapter are “where 
you are going.” Learn them well!
	
	
In Chapter 4 the topics include:
• Lean concepts
• Waste identification
• Waste elimination
• Value-add
• No-value-add
• Business-value-add
• Standard work
• Value stream
• Value stream management
• Continuous flow
• Point of use storage

• Chapter 5 describes the three fundamental approaches of Kaizen, 
providing a comprehensive look at applying this concept on a daily 
basis across your organization. Through Kaizen and You we learn 
to identify waste and apply the Lean concepts in our individual and 
immediate sphere of influence. With Kaizen Teams we focus on 
larger areas with group improvement activities. With Kaizen and 
Process Troubleshooting we learn how to apply the concepts and tools 
and improve a process while it is operating.
	
	
In Chapter 5 we present:
• Kaizen and You method
• Kaizen and Project Teams
• Kaizen and Process Troubleshooting
• Kaikaku—Transformation of Mind
• Kakushin—Innovation
INTEGRATING LEAN WITH SIX SIGMA
Integrating Lean and Six Sigma concepts is not only beneficial, but it can 
often be a critical first-step requirement of process improvement proj­
ects. For example, one of the first steps of many Six Sigma projects is pro­
cess assessment to understand if the process is “stable and in control” (a 
requirement to complete much of the statistical analysis described in later 
sections of this handbook). Typically processes that are unstable or out of 
control have many “special causes” associated with process variation. In 
these instances, the use of Lean concepts and tools is invaluable in stan­
dardizing a process prior to embarking on statistical projects. This is a 
fundamental reason why our Standardize-Do-Check-Act (SDCA) cycle is 
a precursor to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle that is prominent in 
process improvement.
In Table S2.1 we show how to integrate Lean concepts and tools into 
typical phases of Six Sigma projects using the DMAIC and DMADV

methodologies. There are no hard-and-fast rules. The table gives a basic 
reference of where these may fit into your LSS projects, that is, what phase 
in the two Six Sigma methodologies that each Lean concept or tool is most 
apt to be used. This does not mean that the tool should be used each time a 
project goes through the indicated phase, but rather what could be used in 
that phase. In Appendix B we give a complete LSS body of knowledge that 
identifies which concepts and tools are used in typical Green Belt, Black 
Belt, and Master Black Belt programs.
In Table S2.1 many of these Lean concepts are used in the early phases 
of a project—Define, Measure, and Analyze. They are a natural fit in these 
phases for improving your understanding of the current state of your pro­
cess. Many of the Lean tools are predominantly used in the Improve and 
Control phases where you are taking action to improve a process. Taken 
together, these Lean concepts and tools are an invaluable component of 
defining your improvement plan and the future state improved process.
As you proceed through Section 2, refer back to this table for a clearer 
understanding of applying Lean concepts and tools. As you move further 
through later sections of the handbook and ultimately embark on LSS 
projects, this table will serve as a reference check for integrating important 
Lean concepts and tools into DMAIC or DMADV projects.

Waste Identification
There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not 
be done at all.
Peter F. Drucker
IN A NUTSHELL
Waste is generally composed of unnecessary activities that can be described 
either qualitatively or quantitatively. In its most basic form, LSS encom­
passes both these descriptors. Waste identification is also called learning 
to see muda, which is a traditional Japanese term for an activity that is 
wasteful and doesn’t add value or is unproductive, value-none, trivial, or 
unuseful.* It is also one of three key concepts in the Toyota Production 
System (TPS). The other two are mura, which means irregularity, uneven­
ness, or variability, and muri, which refers to overburden or strenuous 
work.† These three terms describe the waste that infiltrates organizations 
and allows us to begin “learning to see” waste.
Waste identification and reduction is an effective way to increase profit­
ability. Toyota merely picked up these three words beginning with the pre­
fix mu-, which in Japan are widely recognized as a reference to a product 
improvement program or campaign.
In this chapter, we present fundamentals on how to recognize muda, 
mura, and muri in the workplace. The chapter discusses the importance

of looking at your organization in new ways, developing an inquisitive 
approach that encourages questioning of current beliefs and practices, 
and taking a look at everything you do from the customer viewpoint. One 
approach is to start at the end; that is, walk backward through your orga­
nization assessing process steps in reverse and asking questions. To this 
end, we include a series of checklists to get the LSS practitioner thinking 
in new ways.
OVERVIEW
Until recently, when we talk about learning to see waste, we are consid­
ering organizational wastes, not behavioral wastes. However, behavioral 
wastes can severely hinder Lean initiatives. This chapter describes what 
waste is and how to identify waste. It also discusses the mindsets that are 
the root causes of waste. These mindsets or belief systems are put into 
context here and described with terms like just-in-case logic. Almost all 
organizational wastes or process wastes are related to an employee in the 
organization that holds a traditional belief system.
Learning to see variation (mura) or waste (muda) requires a shift in 
how we view our organization. How do we view our processes? How do 
we measure our processes? What questions we ask about process perfor­
mance, people performance, and equipment performance all indicate how 
we look at variation and waste. Throughout this chapter we present check­
lists that help you to begin to question everything you do in an effort to 
learn to see variation and waste in a new light.
WHAT IS VARIATION?
The way in which numbers differ is called variation.* Virtually every­
thing that is measured is subject to variation. Our equipment is subject to 
variation. Our employees are subject to variation. The instrumentation that

Hill, New York, 1998.

Waste Identification  •  61
we often use to measure a process is subject to variation. How we measure 
our measures can be a key source of variation. There is variability inherent 
in many methods completed in our value-adding processes. For example, 
one of the most critical and prevalent tools used in every organization 
today is the computer and its software packages. How we gather informa­
tion, analyze information, and report information can be subject to tre­
mendous variation. Based upon the simple observations, one can see why 
the study and understanding of variation is a critical component to an LSS 
organization.
Variation can also be described as “a measure of the changes in the 
output from the process over a period of time.”* As you collect data over 
time, you can measure and view the variation of process input variables, 
process methods, or process output variables. Understanding, control­
ling, and limiting process variation is a primary goal of any LSS practitio­
ner. As we begin our journey toward being an LSS organization, we must 
become proficient at measuring variation, analyzing root causes of this 
variation, and taking corrective actions to eliminate variation from all of 
our processes.
The entire study of variation is an endeavor to quantify and chart process 
behavior. At the beginning of our value-added processes, we can quantify 
and chart our process input variables. These include the 5M’s: materials, 
machines, manpower, methods, and measurements. The objective here is 
to minimize variation in our supply chain inputs to our value-added pro­
cesses. For example, by measuring variation in material specifications, we 
are able to better control our value-adding process steps, thereby assuring 
a predictable outcome for product performance.
How Do We Chart Variation?
One of the most common process output variables in an LSS environ­
ment is process lead time. In many instances, customers are sensitive to 
the amount of time it takes us to add value for them. How we organize 
our materials, deploy our human resources, set up our equipment, and 
sequence our value-added steps has a tremendous influence on our pro­
cess output lead time. The average lead time chart in Figure 3.1 shows 
*	 H. James Harrington, Praveen Gupta, Frank Voehl, The Six-Sigma Greenbelt Handbook, Paton 
Press, New York, 2009.

62  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
how the lead time varies over time, specifically, how month-to-month lead 
time varies during the year. It also shows the upper control limit (UCL) 
and lower control limit (LCL) for the data set.
Why Is Understanding and Controlling Variation So Important?
Simple charting like this can help us to understand, control, and improve 
lead time for our customers. The importance of understanding, charting, 
and controlling process variation cannot be overstated. Understanding 
variation and decreasing variation is the fundamental underlying foun­
dation of all LSS organizations. First, it allows us to understand, control, 
and improve our entire supply chain, which includes many activities that 
are conducted outside of our physical facilities. Second, it allows us to 
uncover valuable insight concerning the interactions between materials 
and our processing equipment. Perhaps, more importantly, it provides a 
fundamental foundation for assessing our performance output behavior 
that is critical for customer satisfaction. Virtually all of our outputs are 
key performance indicators and subject to variation. As a consequence,

our ability to understand and chart variation is paramount for improved 
performance from a customer viewpoint. The remainder of this chapter 
and several chapters that follow in this handbook are dedicated to under­
standing waste identification and process variation and applying LSS tools 
for process improvement.
WHAT IS WASTE?
Describing waste is not as easy as one might think. Waste appears 
throughout organizations and is often mixed with nonwaste. There are 
times and conditions within our organizations where deciding what is 
waste versus nonwaste can be somewhat of a moving target. For example, 
in today’s organization, e-mail is virtually impossible to live without as 
a communication tool. In and of itself, it has great capacity to assist with 
many processes. Yet it can also be a significant source of extra process­
ing waste. The telephone can produce a similar waste, but are all tele­
phone calls wasteful? There are times when some organizations consider 
inventory an asset, that is, right up until the customer no longer wants to 
purchase the inventory. Clearly, one or more definitions describing just 
what is waste (all no-value-added activities) and what is not waste (value-
added activities) are needed.
Defining the Value-Added Work Components
LSS organizations are constantly searching for more effective ways to 
deliver value for the customer. How do we define value and distinguish it 
from activities that produce no value?
To better understand this term, we have provided you with a prac­
tical definition of value-added (VA), no-value-added (NVA), and no-
value-added but necessary. (See Figure 3.2.) Value-added is an activity 
that transforms or shapes raw material or information to meet cus­
tomer requirements.
Organizations that strive to eliminate NVA work while increasing their 
VA work are the ones that will be the most successful.* There are a number 
*	 As a management technique, companies seek to provide additional value-added in their products 
as a way of distinguishing them from competitors; value-added in this sense is a means of avoiding 
commoditization and maintaining profit margins.

64  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
of ways to accomplish this. One of the most effective ways is to first evalu­
ate the practices used, so you can recognize any NVA work and then take 
steps to reduce it and be more efficient in your work. The basic character­
istics include VA components such as customer VA and operational VA, 
as well as NVA components such as idle time, rework, and bureaucracy. 
Detailed analysis of these factors is a fundamental part of waste identifica­
tion and the foundation of LSS initiatives.
In the case of a manufacturing operation, VA means all those activi­
ties that turn raw materials into value (the product) for your customer. 
In the case of a service organization, VVA means all those activities that 
are required to deliver the intended service. In essence, the service is your 
product. Your VA product or service is what you end up with, or what 
the customer wanted. Conversely, NVA is anything that the customer in 
not willing to pay for. NVA entities can be employee activities, materials, 
information exchanges, and equipment. The difficulty comes in separating 
NVA from VA activities and still providing what the customer wanted. The 
remainder of this section is about identifying anything that is NVA in your 
organization.*
*	 Many of the TPS/Lean techniques work in a similar way. By planning to reduce manpower, or 
reduce changeover times, or reduce campaign lengths, or reduce lot sizes, the question of waste 
comes immediately into focus upon those elements that prevent the plan being implemented. 
Often it is in the operations area rather than the process area that muda can be eliminated and 
remove the blockage to the plan. Tools of many types and methodologies can then be employed on 
these wastes to reduce or eliminate them.
• Value-added is an activity that transforms or shapes raw material or information 
to meet customer requirements.
• No-value-added is an activity that takes time, resources, or space, but does not 
add to the value of the product or service itself from the customer perspective.
• No-value-added but necessary is an activity that does not add value to the prod­
uct or service but is required (e.g., accounting, health and safety, governmental 
regulations, etc.). In the business process management methodology this is called 
business value-added.

HOW DOES WASTE CREEP INTO A PROCESS?
Waste can creep into any process over time and usually does.* In the 
1980s there was a popular story about a tire manufacturing plant in the 
Midwest. The story goes that they were conducting a continuous improve­
ment effort when one of the observers posed a simple question to an oper­
ator. “Why are we wrapping these tires in protective white plastic?” The 
operator was not sure; his reply was that they had done it for the 3 years 
that he had been with the company. So they went to the shift supervisor 
and posed the same question. His response was that the machine was 
there since he joined the company 7 years earlier. He said that Charlie 
in maintenance may know: “He’s been here for 25 years.” So they headed 
off to maintenance to find Charlie. When they posed the question to 
him, he replied that it is to protect the whitewall tires in shipping. They 
hadn’t made whitewall tires in the plant for years; however, they contin­
ued to wrap the newer all-black tires as if they had whitewalls. This is one 
example where a product change without a process change allows waste 
to creep in to your process.
THE POWER OF OBSERVATION
From the Renaissance period in the 1500s to the emergence of many of 
the pure and applied sciences in the 1700s to 1800s, there were limited 
technical tools compared to today. There were no computers, no Internet 
with instant information, no instant communication, no telephone, and 
no mass transportation. The sharing of knowledge was slow and difficult. 
In relative isolation, science was advanced by disciplined individuals com­
mitted to observation and experimentation.
*	 Shigeo Shingo divides process-related activity into process and operation. He distinguishes pro­
cess, the course of material that is transformed into product, from operation, which are the actions 
performed on the material by workers and machines. This distinction is not generally recognized 
because most people would view the operations performed on the raw materials of a product by 
workers and machines as the process by which those raw materials are transformed into the final 
product. He makes this distinction because value is added to the product by the process but not 
by most of the operations. He states that whereas many see process and operations in parallel, he 
sees them at right angles (orthogonal); this throws most of operations into the waste category. See 
value stream mapping for a further explanation.

66  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
It was during these times that the power of observation was the domi­
nant tool for improvement. As mechanical scientific instruments were 
developed, these highly trained and skilled observers applied these 
tools, coupled with keen observation capabilities, to make astounding 
discoveries. However, in almost every organization that we go into, the 
power of observation is almost nonexistent. Employees at all levels wan­
der through the organization focused on their individual worlds and 
completely ignoring the blatantly obvious signs of waste that engulf their 
organization.
Some have called these organizational cataracts. These cataracts can 
grow and hinder our vision and render the power of observation an obso­
lete tool. Managers fail to see the waste of rework associated with the 
poor scheduling or haste with which they initially produced a product. 
Employees focused exclusively on a daily production deadline completely 
miss a multitude of opportunities to improve their environment in favor 
of producing the daily production quantity.
The range of what we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. And, 
because we fail to notice that we fail to notice, there is little we can do to 
change until we notice how our failing to notice shapes our thought and 
deeds.
—R.D. Laing
This approach (observation and experimentation), which has been used 
by science for hundreds of years, is the key to advancing knowledge and 
improving our understanding of our surroundings. We must be able to 
accurately observe our surroundings, document what we see, investigate 
and analyze our observations to find out what is causing what we see, and 
ultimately take effective action to improve our environment.
Science is “the desire to know causes.”
—William Hazlitt (1778–1830), English essayist
This emergence of the power of observation is a key ingredient in the 
formation of a learning environment. The remainder of this chapter is 
about igniting the power of observation in our employees. More impor­
tantly, it’s about learning to see waste and variation with new eyes, eyes 
that know what to look for.

Waste Identification  •  67
SEEING WITH NEW EYES
Traditionally, Lean has classified waste into eight major categories. These 
categories were developed based upon visual symptoms in the organiza­
tion. We have added a ninth waste, behavior waste, which revolves around 
individual and collective belief systems and how they influence daily 
behavior. The remainder of this chapter discusses each category in detail.
What types of waste are present? What are typical causes of each waste? 
How can waste be identified? Checklists are included to assist you with 
learning to see waste and variation. However, you are encouraged to 
expand these checklists by looking at each process step in your organiza­
tion and developing your own questions. The nine waste categories are:
	
1.	Overproduction
	
2.	Excess inventory
	
3.	Defects
	
4.	Extra processing
	
5.	Waiting
	
6.	Motion
	
7.	Transportation
	
8.	Underutilized people
	
9.	Employee behavior
Waste 1: Overproduction
Overproduction means making more of a product than is needed by the 
next process or the end customer.* It can also be described as making the 
product earlier in time than is needed or making a product at a faster rate 
than is needed. Overproduction has been labeled by some as the worst 
waste because typically it creates many of the other wastes. For example, 
overproduction leads to excess inventory, which in turn leads to the wastes 
of motion and transportation. In addition, excess inventory requires more 
*	 Overproduction happens each time you engage more resources than needed to deliver to your 
customer. For instance, large batch production, because of long changeover time, exceeds the 
strict quantity ordered by the customer. For productivity improvement, operators are required to 
produce more than the customer needs. Extra parts will be stored and not sold. Overproduction 
is a critical muda because it hides or generates all others, especially inventory. Overproduction 
increases the amount of space needed for storing raw material as well as finished goods. It also 
requires a preservation system.

68  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
people, equipment, and facility space, all of which reduce company pro­
ductivity and profitability. This is shown in Figure 3.3.
What Causes Overproduction?
Overproduction can be traced to many management and employee behav­
iors. Some of the most common causes are:
• Just-in-case logic
• Unleveled scheduling
• Unbalanced workloads
• Misuse of automation
• Long process setup times
The Just-in-Case Logic Trap
Just-in-case logic is exactly what it sounds like. You make more product 
just-in-case—you fill in the blank. For example, just-in-case the machine 
breaks down, just-in-case our suppliers don’t send enough raw materials, 
just-in-case our customer orders more than we can make or deliver on 
time, etc. There are many reasons for using just-in-case logic, and they are 
all bad!
Just-in-case logic is one of the most common non-Lean employee 
behaviors present in companies today. It is responsible for productivity

losses in any type of organization by robbing employee time when work­
ing on NVA overproduction. It is commonly found in other waste cat­
egories, such as the waste of motion, transportation, inventory, waiting, 
and defects. Most importantly, it reveals an inherent weakness in your 
current process capability and reliability. Managers that practice just-in-
case logic invariably have poorly understood processes and poor process 
control. Instead of fixing the process, they prefer to mask the system with 
just-in-case overproduction. They have fallen into the just-in-case logic 
trap. Don’t do it!
Unleveled Scheduling and Unbalanced Workloads
Unleveled scheduling and unbalanced workloads can both lead to over­
production. When these conditions occur and employees continue to pro­
duce, even when there is no customer demand, overproduction occurs. In 
forecast-driven environments unleveled scheduling frequently occurs. In 
areas where the workload is not balanced properly between two or more 
process steps, one step will have excess capacity while the next may have 
excess demand.
Misuse of Automation
Another common mistake is that owners, senior managers, and/or depart­
ment managers want to see expensive equipment running, not sitting idle. 
This misuse of automation can cause severe overproduction. Not very 
often does customer demand exactly meet machine capacity. One of the 
most difficult challenges for LSS practitioners is to change the misconcep­
tion that the machine must always be running. In environments where 
there is a combination of automated and manual production, the misuse 
of automation at one process step creates the unleveled scheduling and 
unbalanced workloads at downstream process steps. In this case we have 
one cause of overproduction (misuse of automation) forcing overproduc­
tion at another process step.
Long Process Setup Times
The length of time required to set up equipment has long been a primary 
justification for overproducing and carrying excess inventory. The tradi­
tional thought is that if your setup times are long, then you must build 
larger batches than are required. One traditional approach is to define an 

70  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
economic order quantity (EOQ) where the changeover cost + the inven­
tory carrying cost are the lowest, and then you build a batch this size. 
This concept is shown in Figure 3.4. Do these assumptions on batch size 
selection make sense if changeover time can be significantly reduced? The 
answer is no. As you reduce changeover time, you reduce both changeover 
cost and the inventory carrying cost, and the EOQ moves toward the left 
on the chart. In this case, instead of using EOQ, target your processes to 
build just what the customer wants. The most cost effective EOQ is always 
what the customer wanted.
This is a classic example of bad measures driving bad behavior. The pri­
mary assumption that you have to live with long changeovers and high 
inventory levels and inventory carrying costs, rather than try to eliminate 
them, was made based upon these two measures. In an LSS environment 
we focus on the process (long changeover time), identify the waste, and 
eliminate the waste by simplifying the setup process.

Waste 2: Excess Inventories
Excess inventory is “any supply in excess of a one-piece flow through your 
manufacturing process.”* One-piece flow is often referred to as a make 
one–move one environment. Excess inventory could also refer to any 
finished goods inventory. Most organizations today run a mixed model 
of both “build to order” and “build to stock” products. Although some 
amount of raw materials and finished goods is required, many organiza­
tions use inventory to cover up poor process performance. They keep rais­
ing the level of inventory until they cover process problems.
Like all of the nine wastes, living with excess inventory creates the 
“more syndrome.” For example, in an excess inventory environment, your 
company requires more people, more equipment, and more facility space. 
All the while you’re making more products (that you may or may not have 
customers for), more defects, more write-offs, etc. The “more syndrome” 
robs your company of productivity and profitability. In an LSS environ­
ment we reduce the sea of inventory and use the Lean or Six Sigma tools to 
identify the root causes of why the inventory was needed and then elimi­
nate the root causes once and for all.
What Causes Excess Inventory?
• Poor market forecast
• Product complexity
• Unleveled scheduling
• Unbalanced workloads
• Unreliable or poor-quality shipments by suppliers
• Misunderstood communications
• Reward system
Poor Market Forecast
Many organizations decide what they will build based upon a market 
forecast. Basically they take a sales and marketing forecast and convert 
it to a manufacturing forecast and then in turn set up a build schedule. 
Unfortunately, the only thing we can say about a forecast with a high 
*	 Inventory, be it in the form of raw materials, work-in-process (WIP), or finished goods, represents 
a capital outlay that has not yet produced an income either by the producer or for the consumer. 
Any of these three items not being actively processed to add value is waste.

Waste Identification  •  73
degree of certainty is that it will be wrong. When this occurs, organiza­
tions are typically left with large amounts of inventory, much of which 
may be unsaleable.
Product Complexity
In a rush to get to market, many products are moved from the product 
development to full production before sufficient design for manufactur­
ability has been completed. When product complexity is high, there are 
several issues that lead to excess inventory. These include raw materials 
performance issues, engineering changes that lead to supplier changes, 
production issues, and in-service performance, to name a few. In a com­
petitive product cost environment, product complexity and high qual­
ity are often at odds with each other and are another source of excess 
inventory.
Unleveled Scheduling and Unbalanced Workloads
Similarly with overproduction, unleveled scheduling and unbalanced 
workloads can both lead to excess inventory. These conditions typically 
occur in forecast-driven environments. In areas where the workload is not 
balanced properly between two or more process steps, one step will have 
excess capacity while the next may have excess demand. In the end, you 
wind up with excess inventory.
Unreliable or Poor-Quality Shipments by Suppliers
LSS organizations can only be sustained with an LSS supply chain. 
Inferior materials can, and often do, produce myriad troubles during 
your VA activities. Unreliable suppliers that deliver materials of poor 
quality or insufficient quantities only serve to help your competitors. To 
achieve LSS performance, focus on developing relationships with LSS 
suppliers.
Misunderstood Communications
Poor communication invariably leads to excess inventory. In the age of 
information overload, it is staggering how much bad information our 
employees are using and how much good information is being unused or 
misused. There are basically three fundamental areas in all organizations. 
(See Figure 3.6.) These are product development or service delivery, opera­
tions management, and information management. Most companies are 

74  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
good performers in one or two of these categories, but rarely all three. 
Depending on the nature and structure of the senior management team, 
more emphasis usually goes to one area. For example, companies with a 
perceived technology advantage tend to pay more attention to product or 
service development at the expense of the other two areas. When commu­
nication breakdowns occur, inventory increases, quality decreases, and 
profitability is hurt. These are signs that you are in a poor communication 
environment:
• Poorly understood customer requirements
• Product or service is frequently delivered late
• Poor customer satisfaction
• Incomplete or inaccurate documentation
• Poor work instructions
• Inadequate information management system
• Barriers between departments
• Conflicting measurements system
Rewards System
There are several factors of company-wide rewards systems that can con­
tribute to excess inventory. These factors can originate from senior man­
agement or from most departments. Since we know that measures drive

behavior, poorly defined measures tied to rewards often result in excess 
inventory and many other wastes.
One example could be if an operations group has a measure of “on-time 
delivery” without regard for inventory levels. Another may be how the 
sales group gets compensation. Still another may arise from inadequate 
knowledge of the true cost of carrying inventory. Regardless of the rea­
sons, if a large level of inventory exists in your facility, review the rewards 
program for an inadequate measurements system.
How to Identify Excess Inventory
The learning to see excess inventory checklist presents several questions 
designed to expose inventory waste. (See Figure 3.7.)

Waste 3: Defects
Definition
A defect can be described as anything that the customer did not want. 
Defects include product or service attributes that require manual 
inspection and repair or rework at any point in the value stream. Defects 
can be detected and identified before your product or service reaches 
the customer or post-consumer in the form of warranty returns.*
What Causes Defects?
Defects can result from myriad causes. These causes can be classified into 
a few basic areas listed below. Each is followed by a brief description.
• Customer needs not understood
• Poor purchasing practices or quality materials
• Inadequate education/training/work instructions
• Poor product design
• Weak process control
• Deficient planned maintenance
Customer Needs Not Understood
Establishing comprehensive customer requirements is essential to defect-
free products. More often than not we think we know what the customer 
wants or we make many assumptions about how he or she will use our 
product or service or what’s important to him or her in terms of product 
or service performance. The more we can know in this area, the better we 
can develop our processes to respond to customer requirements.
Poor Purchasing Practices or Quality Materials
In the global marketplace, controlling the supply chain is an ever-
increasing challenge. Purchasing departments typically have their own 
stand-alone measures based upon dead materials costs. Material costs 
*	 Whenever defects occur, extra costs are incurred reworking the part, rescheduling production, 
etc. Defects cause scrap, repair, rework, backflow, and warranty/replacements; consume resources 
for inspection, correction, and replacement; cause opportunity loss (capacity and resources used 
to fix problems); cost 5% of sales for Six Sigma and 40% of sales for One Sigma processes; and 
reduce variability, lock gains, implement controls, and error proofing.

Waste Identification  •  77
are typically very visible in financial statements and a common target for 
cost reductions. This never-ending pressure for cost reduction frequently 
pushes product quality below levels expected by customers.
What’s not present on most financial statements is the cost of quality, 
which includes repair and rework. Oh, it’s present on the bottom line; how­
ever, there is no individual expense line item that can be targeted. Many 
defects can be traced to inferior quality materials. Repair and rework costs 
for these defective materials increase dramatically the further into the 
value stream your product gets before the defect is discovered. Numbers 
for how much this costs vary greatly across industries. Some of the com­
ponents of this cost may include:
• Cost of communication with supplier
• Cost of storage until a disposition can be made
• Cost of employee time for physical moves or quarantine
• Cost of employee doing this NVA activity instead of a VA activity
• Cost of repair if required
• Cost of returns to suppliers
• Cost of re-engineering
• Cost of re-inspection
• Cost of productivity losses on new products due to staff re-assignment 
to complete rework
Inadequate Education/Training/Work Instructions
Here is an important rule of thumb: At any given point in time, you should 
have cross-training capacity at 150% of full production at each process 
step. To accomplish this, there needs to be a well-defined and executed 
cross-training program and effective work instructions to carry out the 
program. Often employees are asked to produce a quality product without 
adequate education, training, or visual work instructions to complete the 
task. One of the most effective means of defect reduction is the prepara­
tion of visual work instructions.
Poor Product Design
Many defects can be traced to poor product design. In examining prod­
uct design failures, look for cost restrictions, poorly understood in-service 
product performance requirements, poor materials’ selection, little or no 
product performance testing, and poor supplier performance. Regardless 
of the root cause of poor product design, the cost for a part design change 

78  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
increases dramatically the further into the value stream the product is 
before the defect is detected. The relative cost to mitigate a defect detected 
along the value stream using design engineering as a baseline of $1 is:
• $1 product design engineering
• $2 product manufacturing engineering
• $4 production
• $5 to $10 if the product reaches the customer
In some industries the cost could be significantly more. Many pharma­
ceuticals, for example, have limited shelf lives. If defect detection occurs 
at the customer, there may be insufficient time for return and repair or 
rework, requiring a complete write-off of the shipment. In this case, mate­
rial/labor/facilities’ costs plus profit are lost, not to mention the bad will 
created with the customer.
Weak Process Control
In all process environments either you control the process or the process 
controls you. Weak process control can stem from several sources, includ­
ing deficiencies in materials, machines, manpower, methods, or measure­
ments. It is easy for weak process control to creep into your processes. 
The three telltale signs you need to work on process control are defects, 
rework, and high scrap rates.
Deficient Planned Maintenance
Poor equipment maintenance is often a cause for defective products. The 
justification for not completing planned maintenance can range from not 
enough time to do Total Productive Maintenance or autonomous mainte­
nance, to can’t afford to have production down, to equipment repairs are too 
expensive, to name a few. In the long run, effective equipment maintenance 
is always less expensive than equipment breakdowns due to poor mainte­
nance, the cost of scrapping defective parts, or the added cost of rework.
How to Identify Defects
Defects are often only defined as something that an employee can tangibly 
see in the product. However, a defect is better described as anything that 
contributes to a product not meeting exactly what the customer wants. 
The list of questions in Figure 3.8 should help you begin to expose a num­
ber of possible defects. This list could be greatly expanded; however, it

should give you an idea of how to begin your search for anything that may 
possibly affect your product or service and be considered a defect. 
Waste 4: Extra Processing
Processing waste is described as any effort that adds no value to the product 
or service from the customers’ viewpoint. These are steps that may not be 
necessary. Many examples of processing waste are present in any product 
or service delivery. For example, let’s consider a product with 15 steps. If 
a sub-assembly at process step 3 is not assembled correctly, the product 
moves through the facility and the problem is initially detected at assembly 
step 13. Unfortunately, steps 5, 7, 9, and 11 may need to be disassembled and 
the correction made before step 13 can proceed. These repeated steps are 
rework and take valuable time away from employees who could be working 
on new products. This extra effort is called processing waste.
What Causes Processing Waste?
Processing waste can stem from many sources and is often present 
regardless of the activity type. Processing waste is predominantly waste 
that is found in front-office areas, such as order processing, information 
gathering and dissemination, and all accounting functions. It is also 
dominant in service industries where service-delivery requirements 
may be ill-defined or difficult to achieve. Industries like the medical 
field, janitorial, or food-service industries may have extensive process­
ing waste from several apparent causes. These causes can be classified 
into a few basic areas listed below. Each is followed by a brief description.
• Product changes without process changes
• Just-in-case logic
• True customer requirements undefined
• Overprocessing to accommodate downtime
• Poor communication
• Redundant approvals
• Extra copies/excessive information
Product Changes without Process Changes
When a product or service is changed, production staff or service person­
nel need to be properly informed. For example, visual work instructions or 
service-delivery instructions need to be modified and training conducted 

Waste Identification  •  81
for the new process. In many growing companies, products or services are 
changed frequently, often with little or cursory regard for production or 
service-delivery personnel. This can be a major source of processing waste 
for a range of product or service quality issues.
Just-in-Case Logic
Just-in-case logic is exactly what it sounds like. You make more product 
just-in-case—you fill in the blank, for example, just-in-case the machine 
breaks down, just-in-case your suppliers don’t send enough raw materials, 
just-in-case your customer orders more than you can make or deliver on 
time, etc. There are many reasons for using just-in-case logic, and they all 
contribute to decreased company profitability! Just-in-case logic is a pri­
mary cause for overprocessing waste.
True Customer Requirements Undefined
When customer requirements are poorly understood or not documented 
properly and employees are not adequately trained on requirements, extra 
processing is bound to occur. AN LSS process starts with a clear funda­
mental understanding of customer requirements. This typically involves a 
critical to quality (CTQ) assessment and definition of all product or ser­
vice requirements from the customer standpoint.
Overprocessing to Accommodate Downtime
In traditional organizations, one belief is that people must be busy on 
production at all times. Consequently, managers order people to produce 
products even when none are required by a downstream customer. This 
results in overprocessing and creates overproduction and excess inven­
tory. Alternatively, this time should be used for additional LSS training, 
cross-training programs, or other continuous improvement activities.
Poor Communication
Poor communication is typically one of the top reasons that organiza­
tions lose effectiveness. Communicating information along the entire 
value stream is critical for a great customer experience. The earlier in any 
process that the communication breaks down, the worse is the resulting 
waste. A typical communication cycle includes:
• Identifying critical to quality (CTQ) customer requirements
• Transitioning customer requirements into product or service 
specifications

82  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Engineering the product or service
• Creating instructions for producing the product or service
• Product or service delivery to the customer
Redundant Approvals
Although there is a need to have some cost and quality control approv­
als in any process, it is easy to stifle the process by requiring redundant 
approvals that can dramatically increase lead time and increase total 
product cost. After reviewing many approval procedures over the years, 
this has been identified as a significant example of extra processing.
Extra Copies/Excessive Information
Information sharing can be a significant source waste. How many reports 
are printed and not read? If they are read, how many items are actions 
taken on? Then there are charts, graphs, memorandums, e-mail distribu­
tions, etc., leading to information overload for employees. One example 
is what can essentially be described as the e-mail soap opera. The saga 
begins with one controversial statement or aspect that was sent to too 
many employees. It quickly evolves into long series of clarifications and 
reclarification e-mails, with each e-mail raising more questions than it 
answers. These types of e-mail dialogues rapidly consume significant 
employee time and energy of everyone involved.
How to Identify Processing Waste
The learning to see processing waste checklist presents some basic ques­
tions to uncover process waste.* (See Figure 3.9.)
*	 Having a direct impact to the bottom line, quality defects resulting in rework or scrap are a 
tremendous cost to most organizations. Associated costs include quarantining inventory, re-
inspecting, rescheduling, and capacity loss. In many organizations the total cost of defects is often 
a significant percentage of total manufacturing cost. Through employee involvement and continu­
ous process improvement (CPI), there is a huge opportunity to reduce defects at many facilities. In 
the latest edition of the Lean Manufacturing classic Lean Thinking, underutilization of employees 
has been added as an eighth waste to Ohno’s original seven wastes. Organizations employ their 
staff for their nimble fingers and strong muscles but forget they come to work every day with a 
free brain. It is only by capitalizing on employees’ creativity that organizations can eliminate the 
other seven wastes and continuously improve their performance. Many changes over recent years 
have driven organizations to become world-class organizations or Lean enterprises. The first step 
in achieving that goal is to identify and attack the nine wastes. As many world-class organizations 
have come to realize, customers will pay for value-added work, but will never knowingly or will­
ingly pay for waste.

Waste 5: Waiting
Waiting waste is often described as time waiting for something to happen 
or occur. This could be human waiting time, machine waiting, or materi­
als waiting to be processed. When this waste occurs, ultimately it is the 
customer who is left waiting as lead times expand to accommodate the 
numerous waiting steps in your processes.
What Causes Waiting Waste?
Waiting time waste may be caused by several sources. Some examples 
include materials conveyance delays, machinery or equipment breakdowns,

operators working too fast or too slow, and an insufficient number of 
employees, to name a few. Causes of waiting waste include:
• Raw material outages
• Unbalanced scheduling or workloads
• Unplanned downtime for maintenance
• Poor equipment or facility layout
• Long process setup times
• Misuses of automation
• Upstream quality (flow) problems
Raw Material Outages
A prevalent root cause of waiting waste is raw material outages. Poor 
purchasing practices or purchasing measures can often lead to inade­
quate raw materials’ inventories. Without raw materials you cannot add 
value for your customers and you bear all the material-related liability. 
For example, if you make a product that has 25 components and you are 
out of 2, you cannot build your product. However, you have the inven­
tory carrying costs for the 23 components in stock. In addition, allow­
ing outages to occur almost guarantees some of the other wastes, such 
as overproduction and extra processing. You cannot build the entire 
product, so you start building parts, and soon mountains of incomplete 
sub-assemblies begin to appear around the facility as work-in-process 
(WIP). Raw materials outages and management can be an LSS project 
focus topic.
Unleveled Scheduling and Unbalanced Workloads
Similarly with overproduction, unleveled scheduling and unbalanced 
workloads can both lead to the waste of waiting. These conditions typi­
cally occur in forecast-driven environments. In areas where the workload 
is not balanced properly between two or more process steps, one step will 
have excess capacity while the next may have excess demand. In the end, 
you wind up with equipment, materials, and/or manpower waiting.
Unplanned Downtime for Maintenance
When a machine breaks down unexpectedly, there is a significant opening for 
the waste of waiting. In addition, during the waiting period overproduction 

Waste Identification  •  85
or extra processing can follow when management decides the result of find­
ing things for employees to do until the equipment is back on-line. These 
extra activities are often viewed as steps that would be necessary to complete 
and not as waste. However, as shown in overproduction and extra processing, 
these are truly wastes and should be measured and subsequently eliminated.
Poor Equipment or Facility Layout
Equipment placement and facility layout are primary sources of the 
waste of waiting. The position of equipment within a facility is frequently 
decided based upon (1) shortest run from electrical service, (2) currently 
open floor space, and (3) a position near similar equipment, or in an 
expansion location. None of these criteria are based upon a proper man­
ufacturing sequence or limiting any of the nine wastes. Poor equipment 
and facility layout can result in significant motion, transportation, and 
waiting wastes.
Long Process Setup Times
When the time to change equipment over to a different product is long, 
this can be a contributor to the waste of waiting. Although long process 
setup times can vary depending on the equipment and complexity of the 
transition, process setups are necessary for most equipment. Every min­
ute, hour, or day consumed by setup is time permanently lost to waiting 
and contributes to lower productivity and profitability.
Misuse of Automation
A common mistake that owners or managers often make is that they 
want to see expensive equipment running, not sitting idle. This misuse 
of automation can cause the waste of waiting. Not very often does cus­
tomer demand exactly meet machine capacity. One of the most difficult 
challenges for LSS practitioners is to change the misconception that the 
machine must always be running. In environments where there is a com­
bination of automated and manual production, the misuse of automa­
tion at one process step creates the unleveled scheduling and unbalanced 
workloads at downstream process steps.
Upstream Quality (Flow) Problems
Product quality issues can lead to a number of wastes. Two prominent wastes 
are extra processing and waiting. In the case of many complex products that 
contain sub-assemblies, as soon as quality issues are uncovered upstream, 

86  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
remaining downstream steps are caught in a waiting game for completed qual­
ity sub-assemblies. Every process step should target 100% first-pass quality.
How to Identify Waiting Waste
Waiting waste can be present across the entire value stream. Regardless 
of the reason for the waste of waiting, the objective of learning to see is to 
identify where and when in the process waiting waste occurs. The check­
list in Figure 3.10 is an effective tool to identify where, when, and how the 
waiting waste is occurring in a process.

Waste 6: Motion
Waste of motion occurs when there is any movement of people or informa­
tion that does not add value to the product or service.* The ultimate objec­
tive in an LSS organization is to properly connect materials, machines, man/
woman power, and methods. When this is achieved, there is a state of contin­
uous flow. Continuous flow is often credited with the highest levels of quality, 
productivity, and profitability. Wherever there are disconnects between two 
entities, for example, materials and people, the waste of motion is inevitable.
What Causes Motion Waste?
There are many possible causes for the waste of motion. Some of the major 
sources are:
• Poor people, materials, and machine effectiveness
• Inconsistent work methods
• Poor information management
• Unfavorable facility or cell layout
• Poor workplace organization and housekeeping
Poor People or Machine Effectiveness
Employee interactions with materials and machinery may result in the 
waste of motion. This happens when employees have to walk distances to 
pick up or deliver materials by hand. It can also occur when information 
must be hand delivered from one process step to another. One example 
may be delivering a completed order back to accounting to complete the 
billing cycle. Another example may be delivering a completed order to 
shipping for scheduled delivery.
Inconsistent Work Methods
Whenever work methods are not documented properly, a number of 
inconsistent and poor practices slip into any process. The best counter 
to inconsistent work methods is the creation of standard operating pro­
cedures or visual work instructions. These become the foundation of all 
*	 This waste is related to ergonomics and is seen in all instances of bending, stretching, walking, 
lifting, and reaching. These are also health and safety issues, which in today’s litigious society are 
becoming more of a problem for organizations. Jobs with excessive motion should be analyzed 
and redesigned for improvement with the involvement of plant personnel.

88  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
effective employee training programs. In their absence employee learning 
occurs through the passing down of “tribal knowledge” known only to 
“experts” in your organization. Learning that occurs under these condi­
tions is open to interpretation by the employee on “what to do next” or 
“how to do” specific activities in the process. This frequently results in sev­
eral employees doing the exact same activity differently. Inconsistent work 
methods not only result in the waste of motion, but also are frequently the 
root cause of product- or service-delivery quality issues.
Poor Information Management
The transition of information between employees, departments, and 
customers often leads to the waste of motion. Information management 
systems that are not set up to make required information available to 
employees when and where it’s needed often results in employees doing 
printouts and manual document transfers around the organization. As 
with many wastes, the waste of motion can also cause several other wastes. 
For example, when shipping instructions for a specific customer are not 
completely defined in the information management system, an employee 
in shipping must stop to track down the proper information, which can 
require going to order processing or customer service to obtain the infor­
mation. This initial waste of motion produces the waste of waiting and the 
waste of extra processing before the order can be properly shipped.
Unfavorable Facility or Cell Layout
If the facility layout is weak, the waste of motion will be present. By facility 
we mean any department in an organization, wherever value is created for 
the customer. The layouts of administrative areas, such as order processing, 
customer service, accounting, and warranty claims departments, are seldom 
considered as areas where waste can occur, but often are significant sources 
for the waste of motion. This is due to the frequent manual transportation 
of documents necessary in these areas, as well as an inordinate amount of 
information exchange required to produce your product or service.
In a production environment poor facility layout results in excess waste 
of motion regarding moving raw materials in a position to add value, secur­
ing tools and fixtures, or delivering materials to the “next process step.”
Poor Workplace Organization and Housekeeping
It never ceases to amaze me how little attention is paid to workplace organi­
zation and housekeeping. Managers would rather employees spend hours 

Waste Identification  •  89
searching for tools, materials, documentation, etc., than allow 30 minutes/
day to maintain an organized work area. This philosophical fixation that 
every employee activity must be producing product is responsible for many 
of the wastes observed in organizations today. Every day managers can walk 
by piles of obsolete materials, in-process rework, and mountains of defec­
tive warranty returns, while continuing to allow no time for employees to 
correct the conditions that produced these results. All process improve­
ment programs begin with workplace organization and housekeeping.
How to Identify Motion Waste
Motion waste can be present across the entire value stream. Regardless 
of the reason for the waste of motion, the objective of learning to see is to 
identify where and when in the process motion waste occurs. The check­
list in Figure 3.11 is an effective tool to identify where, when, and how the 
motion waste is occurring in the process.
Waste 7: Transportation
Transportation waste is any activity that requires transporting parts and 
materials around the facility. Unlike motion waste that typically involves 
only people, transportation waste is usually reserved for action involving 
equipment to move materials or parts.* This equipment comes in many 
forms, such as carts, rolling racks, forklifts, golf carts, and bicycles, to 
name a few.
What Causes Transportation Waste?
Transportation waste can be caused by a number of factors. The major 
causes are:
• Poor purchasing practices
• Large batch sizes and storage areas
*	 Transporting product between processes is a cost incursion that adds no value to the product. 
Excessive movement and handling cause damage and are an opportunity for quality to deteri­
orate. Material handlers must be used to transport the materials, resulting in another organi­
zational cost that adds no customer value. Transportation can be difficult to reduce due to the 
perceived costs of moving equipment and processes closer together. Furthermore, it is often hard 
to determine which processes should be next to each other. Mapping product flows can make this 
easier to visualize.

90  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Inadequate facility layout
• Limited understanding of the process flow
Poor Purchasing Practices
The largest contributor to transportation waste is poor purchasing prac­
tices. Many organizations measure their purchasing effectiveness on the 
dead cost/piece for raw materials purchased. This can lead to incredible 
waste throughout the organization, not just transportation waste but also 
the waste of overproduction, inventory, extra processing, and defects.

Let’s consider a real-world example to demonstrate how non-Lean mea­
sures can drive non-Lean behavior within an organization. Let’s say your 
organization has a program in place to drive the cost of raw materials 
down and John’s, the purchasing department manager, bonus is depen­
dent on a 10% reduction in raw materials costs. He has his heart set on that 
60-inch plasma TV with surround sound installed before football season, 
so consequently he sees little else except achieving the dead materials cost 
reduction.
John begins to think: How can he achieve this predefined material cost 
reduction? Two actions immediately come to mind; both are non-Lean. 
First, he can go to current suppliers and try to get price decreases. These 
decreases usually require that the organization buy in larger volumes, 
which he does immediately. In fact, at the next manager’s meeting John is 
eager to get a pat on the back from the boss and reports that he has secured 
a 3% material cost reduction in the first month of the program; the unnec­
essary raw materials, along with the corresponding inventory and trans­
portation waste, begin to show up in receiving the very next week.
Second, he can search for secondary suppliers that are willing to provide 
supposedly equal raw materials. At first glance they appear to be equal 
in every way—specification, function, and quality. He begins to substi­
tute some of these raw materials and again achieves more raw materials 
cost reductions that are, of course, well received by management. John 
achieves his bonus and spends Sunday afternoons in bliss with his favorite 
beverage and gridiron action—an apparent happy ending. Not so fast. In 
the next few weeks during production, some inconveniences arise because 
the new materials aren’t exactly like the original parts. This leads to some 
in-process defects that require rework or the waste of extra processing. 
In addition, weeks later returns begin from customers for poor product 
service in the field.
Because the sales price is based upon typical labor standards, these extra 
production costs and warranty return costs don’t appear on management’s 
radar and consequently don’t exist. Only after months, when management 
realizes the shrinking profit margins, does another costly search for the 
reasons begin. This is a classic non-Lean example of how non-Lean tradi­
tional measures can drive non-Lean behavior. In this case, what did John 
learn to see? Certainly not the waste! His behavior was being completely 
driven by his measurement system.

92  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Large Batch Sizes and Storage Areas
The waste of transportation can also occur when you process large batches 
of product or set up large storage areas. Both of these decisions require that 
the materials be moved at some time. These moves invariably require people 
(materials handlers) and equipment (forklifts, carts, pallet jacks, flatbeds, 
etc.). This situation is almost always the symptom of a poor purchasing 
decision that was based upon a non-Lean traditional management belief 
that organizations save money when they buy large batches of materials.
Inadequate Facility Layout
One of the primary causes of transportation waste is poor facility layout. 
Where you place equipment, how and where your materials storage areas 
are set up and regularly accessed, and your organization’s purchasing phi­
losophy all affect productivity and profitability. Proper facility layout can 
reduce lead time by up to 40%, and dramatically reduce the waste of wait­
ing, transportation, and motion.
Limited Understanding of Process Flow
In every process there needs to be a thorough understanding of the materi­
als, machines, man/woman power, or methods required to add value for 
the customer. A primary component of Lean—and a constant goal for LSS 
practitioners—is continued process development and deeper understanding 
of process knowledge. It is important to understand the best sequence of pro­
cess steps to meet customer demand, such as: How are activities conducted? 
How fast is product needed? Where do materials get consumed? What are 
the fluctuations in manpower requirements? Is the correct type of equip­
ment available? Is the equipment in working order? Having well-defined 
answers for these factors contributes to improved process understanding.

cific questions that can help you uncover transportation waste. (See

skills or abilities. This is present to some extent in almost every company, 
even organizations that have been practicing Lean behaviors for some 
time. Much of this employee misuse stems from the management con­
cepts previously discussed regarding traditional organization belief sys­
tems. Although many Western managers pay lip service to “our employees 
are our most valuable asset,” they are the first to philosophically look at 
employees as a liability, not an asset. Many are often quick to practice man­
agement by head count—this is the practice of stating that we will operate 
with a specific number of employees regardless of the number required to 
provide good performance for the customer.
What Causes Underutilized Employees Waste?
There are a number of causes of underutilized employees or people waste. 
Each of these stems from some aspect of traditional belief systems.

• Old guard thinking, politics, the business culture
• Poor hiring practices
• Low or no investment in training
• Low-pay, high-turnover strategy
Old Guard Thinking, Politics, and Business Culture
Old guard thinking, politics, and general business culture often stifle using 
employees’ creative skills or producing innovative assignments that could 
result in significant process improvements. Unfortunately, in many orga­
nizations an employee’s perceived importance to the organization is gener­
ally directly proportional to his or her salary or directly linked to his or 
her title. This is common in the United States and seldom seen in Japanese 
companies.
Poor Hiring Practices
Most human resource departments are faced with the difficult task of how 
to attract and retain skilled employees. Poor hiring practices usually stem 
from the structure of the department and management’s mandate for crit­
ical components of the hiring process, such as pay level, required skills, or 
required experience. All of these could hinder getting the best candidate 
for the position.
There are many factors that can go into poor hiring practices. A few 
common mistakes include:
• Inadequate job advertisements
• Position definition
• Nepotism
• Not matching skills to position requirements
• Not understanding the technical aspects of job requirements
• Inability to identify the skills necessary to add value to a position
Low or No Investment in Training
Good data on training time, although readily available from many sources, 
is often difficult to translate to an organization. The American Society for 
Training and Development (ASTD) puts the dollars per year per employee 
at about $1,400. For a $40,000/year employee, this equates to about 3.5% 
of annual salary. It has been cited in the literature that top-performing 

Waste Identification  •  95
companies spend approximately 4 to 6% of annual salary on training. It 
has also been reported that average American companies spend less than 
5% on employee training. LSS organizations often approach 10%, with 3 
to 4% of annual salary direct spending on new training and 6% employee 
time committed to improvement activities.
All companies tend to view training differently. One observation is 
unavoidable—poor-performing companies tend to invest little or nothing 
in training, while higher-performing organizations invest in training and 
focus on process improvement.
Low-Pay, High-Turnover Strategy
Another common trait of traditional organizations is the “low-pay, high-
turnover rate” philosophy. This is characterized by hiring to a specific 
hourly or salary level regardless of skills, and living with the performance 
that pay rate returns. Because the conditions are poor, employees either 
leave to pursue a better opportunity or are let go by the company for 
myriad reasons. This is an internally focused philosophy and completely 
ignores the voice of the customer.
How to Identify Underutilized Employees Waste
The learning to see underutilized people checklist in Figure 3.13 points 
out some questions you can use to assess your current employee utiliza­
tion and expose some apparent causes for lack of effective employee use.
Waste 9: Behavior
Behavior waste is any waste that results from human interactions. It is 
present to some extent in all organizations. It can be minimal in truly 
LSS organizations; however, it can be pervasive and devastating in tradi­
tional organizations. Behavior waste naturally flows from an individual’s 
or a company’s inherent beliefs. “The concept of waste has not yet been 
effectively extended to the self-defeating behaviors of individuals and 
groups of people in the workplace.”*
Behavior waste is a root cause of the other eight common wastes. Many of 
the previously described wastes alluded to employee beliefs and behaviors 
*	 M. L. Emiliani, “Lean Behaviors,” Management Decision 36/9 (1998) 615–631.

as causes for waste generation. The identification and elimination of behav­
ior waste is critical to any successful LSS initiative.
How to Identify Behavior Waste
Behavior waste is classified as either personal (yourself) or people (between 
two or more employees). Identifying these behavior wastes in your organi­
zation is the first step to elimination of this disruptive waste.

Personal Behavior Waste
Personal waste is waste that comes from within oneself. It stems from the 
way you view yourself, your goals and objectives, or possibly your position 
in the organization. Oftentimes personnel who prefer a Theory Y organi­
zation (empowered-employee environment) and are working in a Theory 
X organization (command and control environment) feel underappreci­
ated. As a consequence, they become an underutilized employee and can 
exhibit low morale. The personal waste they generate comes directly from 
their individual belief system. Gossip, self-imposed barriers, deceptions, 
and ego are a few of the many examples of personal waste.
Personal waste has been described as the little voice inside your head 
that provides constant running (negative) commentary. It can control an 
employee’s inability to suspend judgment and projects unresolved internal 
conflicts of the employee. It does not take much personal waste to bring 
continuous improvement to a screeching halt. In fact, personal waste will 
restrict process improvement and Lean deployment at any process step 
that touches this employee, which is basically your entire value stream.
People Behavior Waste
People waste has to do with relationships between fellow employees. This 
includes between department managers and senior managers, as well 
as the manager-employee relationship. Some categories of people waste 
include turf wars, fiefdoms, or politics. Some specific examples of what 
people say when they are exhibiting people waste are:
• “Bill’s initiative is so stupid!”
• “Forget about what Jane says!”
• “John is impossible to work with!”
One can see how personal waste, when coupled with people waste, can 
stifle all process improvement.
SUMMARY
Learning to see variation and waste is a critical first step to improving 
quality, productivity, and profitability. Only after employees begin to learn 
to see waste and variation with new eyes can they identify previously 

98  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
unnoticed waste in the organization and effectively begin to eliminate the 
sources of waste and variation.
Processes add either value or waste to the creation of goods or services. 
The seven wastes originated in Japan, where waste is known as muda. The 
eighth waste is a concept tool to further categorize muda and was originally 
developed by Toyota’s chief engineer Taiichi Ohno as the core of the Toyota 
Production System, which also became known as Lean Manufacturing. 
The ninth waste—behavior waste—is by far the most damaging of all the 
wastes. The reason is simple: Everything we think, everything we say, and 
everything we do shape the behavior of all employees in our organization 
and gets them going in a direction of either creating value for the customer 
or creating waste.
To eliminate variation or waste in a process, it is important to under­
stand exactly what waste is and where it exists, and to clearly view, mea­
sure, and limit variation. While activities can significantly differ between 
factories and the office workplace may seem to be a different world, or in 
service organizations where the product is actually a service, the typical 
wastes found in all these environments, and in fact in all business envi­
ronments, are actually quite similar.
All forms of the nine wastes are highly costly to an organization because 
waste prohibits the smooth flow of materials and actually degrades quality 
and productivity. The Toyota Production System mentioned in this chap­
ter is also referred to as just-in-time (JIT) because every item is made just 
as it is needed. Conversely, overproduction is referred to as just-in-case. 
This creates excessive lead times, results in high storage costs, and makes 
it difficult to detect defects. The simple solution to overproduction is turn­
ing off the tap; this requires a lot of courage because the problems that 
overproduction or behavior wastes are hiding will be revealed. The con­
cept is to schedule and produce only what can be immediately sold and 
shipped and improve machine changeover/setup capability.
For each waste, there is a strategy to reduce or eliminate its effect on an 
organization, thereby improving overall performance and quality, while 
at the same time lowering costs. Learning to see is all about learning to use 
these strategies and tools in a productive manner.

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods
Management’s reliance solely on Lean Six-Sigma Tools for organi­
zational performance improvement is fool’s gold! Lean Six-Sigma 
Tools are not the answer; they are the instrument used to apply Lean 
Six Sigma Concepts.
Learn the Concepts…. Apply the Tools…. Get the Results.
—Richard Charron
OVERVIEW
Both Lean concepts and Lean tools are an integral part of LSS process 
improvement projects. Contrary to popular belief, Lean tools alone will 
not provide the results that are often attributed to Lean implementation 
programs. Several Lean concepts, when taken together, form a Lean oper­
ational philosophy, which is a primary requirement for successful Lean 
programs. In this chapter we present some basic Lean management con­
cepts and then the most common Lean tools. (See Table 4.1.) When we 
apply Lean tools in pursuit of these concepts, a Lean organization emerges. 
If we endeavor to apply Lean tools in the absence of these Lean manage­
ment concepts, process improvement projects often fall short of desired 
improvement expectations.

Lean Concepts
Just the Facts
Waste
Anything in your processes that your customer is unwilling to 
pay for: extra space, time, materials quality issues, etc.
Value-added
All activities that create value for the external customer.
No-value-added
All activities that create no value for the external customer.
Business-value-added
Activities that do not create value to the external customer, but 
are required to maintain your business operations.
Waste identification
The primary fundamental Lean concept is the ability to see waste 
in your organization. This encompasses being able to readily 
identify the nine wastes and consistently manage to avoid these 
occurrences. More importantly, from a management standpoint, 
it means possessing the ability to proactively lead and mentor 
employees to conduct waste-free activities daily. To do this the 
Lean manager must master the concept of waste identification 
by understanding waste creation in all its forms.
Waste elimination
The ability to apply Lean Six Sigma concepts and tools to 
eliminate identified wastes. This entails continuous learning of 
how to apply concepts and tools either independently or in 
groups to achieve process improvement results.
Standard work 
Standard work is a systematic way to complete value-added 
activities. Having standard work activities is a fundamental 
requirement of Lean Six Sigma organizations.
Value stream
A conceptual path horizontally across your organization that 
encompasses the entire breadth of your external customer 
response activities. That is, anything that transpires from the time 
your organization realizes you have an external customer request 
until that external customer receives its product or service.
Value stream 
management
A systematic and standardized management approach utilizing 
Lean Six Sigma concepts and tools. Value stream management 
results in an external customer-focused response to managing 
value-added activities.
Continuous flow
The Holy Grail of manufacturing, often referred to as make 
one–move one. One-piece flow or continuous flow processing is a 
concept that means items are processed and moved directly from 
one processing step to the next, one piece at a time. One-piece flow 
helps to maximum utilization of resources, shorten lead times, and 
identify problems and communication between operations. 
During any process improvement activity, the first thing on your 
mind should be: “Is what I’m about to do going to increase flow?” 
Achieving continuous flow typically requires the least amount of 
resources (materials, labor, facilities, and time) to add value for the 
customer. Achieving continuous flow has been credited with the 
highest levels of quality, productivity, and profitability.

TABLE 4.1 (CONTINUED)
Glossary of Lean Concepts and Tools
Lean Concepts
Just the Facts
Pull systems
Systems that only replenish materials consumed by external 
customer demand. These systems naturally guide purchasing 
and production activities, directing employees to only produce 
what the external customer is buying. The Kanban tool is used 
to achieve this Lean concept.
Point-of-use storage 
(POUS)
Locating materials at the point of value-adding activities.
Quality @ source
Building quality into value-adding processes as they are completed. 
This is in contrast to trying to “inspect in quality,” which only 
catches mistakes after they have been made. An effective quality 
@ source campaign can minimize or eliminate much of the 
expense associated with traditional quality control or quality 
assurance programs.
Takt time 
Takt time is the demand rate of your external customer for your 
products. It signifies how fast you have to make products to 
meet your customer demand. Once you calculate Takt time, 
you can effectively set your value-added processes to meet this 
customer demand. In essence, Takt time is used to pace lines in 
the production environments. Takt time is an essential 
component of cellular manufacturing.
Just-in-time (JIT)
A concept that espouses materials sourcing and consumption to 
meet external customer demand. Properly executed, it helps to 
eliminate several wastes, including excess inventory, waiting, 
motion, and transportation.
Kaizen
The Japanese term for improvement; continuing improvement 
involving everyone—managers and workers. In manufacturing 
Kaizen relates to finding and eliminating waste in machinery, 
labor, or production methods. Kaizen is a versatile and systematic 
approach to change + improve all processes. In virtually all Lean 
Six Sigma organizations the concept of Kaizen is practiced by all 
employees at all levels of the organization.
Materials, machines, 
manpower, methods, 
and measurements 
(5M’s)
The five key process inputs. The pursuit of Lean Six Sigma is an 
exercise in the effective use of the 5M’s to achieve customer 
requirements and overall organization performance.
Lean accounting
A method of accounting that is aligned horizontally across your 
organization with the value stream. Traditional costing 
structures can be a significant obstacle to Lean Six Sigma 
deployment. A value stream costing methodology simplifies 
the accounting process to give everyone real information in a

basic understandable format. By isolating all fixed costs along 
with direct labor we can easily apply manufacturing resources 
as a value per square footage utilized by a particular cell or 
value stream. This methodology of factoring gives a true 
picture of cellular consumption to value-added throughput for 
each value stream company-wide. Now you can easily focus 
improvement Kaizen events where actual problems exist for 
faster calculated benefits and sustainability.
Lean supply chain
The process of extending your Lean Six Sigma activities to your 
supply chain by partnering with suppliers to adopt one or more 
of the Lean concepts or tools.
Lean metric 
Lean metrics allow companies to measure, evaluate, and 
respond to their performance in a balanced way, without 
sacrificing the quality to meet quantity objectives, or increasing 
inventory levels to achieve machine efficiencies. The type of 
lean metric depends on the organization and can be of the 
following categories: financial performance, behavioral 
performance, and core process performance.
Toyota Production 
System 
The Toyota Production System is a technology of comprehensive 
production management. The basic idea of this system is to 
maintain a continuous flow of products in factories in order to 
flexibly adapt to demand changes. The realization of such 
production flow is called just-in-time production, which means 
producing only necessary units in a necessary quantity at a 
necessary time. As a result, the excess inventories and the 
excess workforce will be naturally diminished, thereby 
achieving the purposes of increased productivity and cost 
reduction.
Lean Tools
Just the Facts
5S
A methodology for organizing, cleaning, developing, and 
sustaining a productive work environment. Improved safety, 
ownership of work space, improved productivity, and improved 
maintenance are some of the benefits of the 5S program.
Overall equipment 
effectiveness (OEE)
An effective tool to assess, control, and improve equipment 
availability, performance, and quality. This is especially 
important if there is a constraining piece of equipment.
Mistake (error) 
proofing
Mistake proofing is a structured approach to ensure a quality 
and error-free manufacturing environment. Error proofing 
assures that defects will never be passed to the next operation. 
This tool drives the organization toward the concept of quality 
@ source.

Lean Tools
Just the Facts
Cellular 
manufacturing
A tool used to produce your product in the least amount of time 
using the least amount of resources. When applying the cellular 
manufacturing tool, you group products by value-adding 
process steps, assess the customer demand rate (Takt time), and 
then configure the cell using Lean Six Sigma concepts and 
tools. This is a powerful tool to allow the use of many Lean 
concepts and tools together to achieve dramatic process 
improvements. (See cell example at the end of this chapter.)
Kanban
A Kanban is a “signal” for employees to take action. It can be a 
card with instructions of what product to make in what 
quantity, a cart that needs to be moved to a new location, or the 
absence of a cart that indicates that an action needs to be taken 
to replenish a product. This is a fundamental tool used to 
establish a “more continuous flow.” Kanban is a simple 
parts-movement system that depends on cards and boxes/
containers to take parts from one workstation to another on a 
production line. The essence of the Kanban concept is that a 
supplier or the warehouse should only deliver components to 
the production line as and when they are needed, so that there 
is no storage in the production area. Kanban can also be 
effective in Lean supply chain management.
In document intensive environments (e.g., medical devices, 
bio-pharma, healthcare, aviation industries, etc.) with 
government document management regulations such as Food 
& Drug Administration (FDA) or other federal agency, Kanban 
can be an effective tool to improve document flow by 
establishing which document to review or approve next.
Value stream mapping
 A process mapping technique that consists of a current state 
map describing initial conditions of a process and a future state 
map that defines an improved process. The current state map 
typically includes some descriptions of the 5M’s that will be 
targets for modifications in the future state.
Visual controls
Visual controls are tools that tell employees “what to do next,” 
what actions are required. These often eliminate the need for 
complex standard operating procedures and promote 
continuous flow by eliminating conditions that would interrupt 
flow before it happens.

104  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
In the early stages of your Lean journey, you should try to understand 
where you currently stand as an organization. Does the company have a stra­
tegic plan with high-level Lean measures that department and process-level 
measures roll up to? Does the organization have a Lean operational philoso­
phy, starting at the executive management group, which flows down to the 
senior management group, department managers, and ultimately to associ­
ate employees? Does the organization understand the difference between the 
traditional organization and what it means to operate as a Lean organization?
In today’s business world, Lean is for everyone. It is a true operational 
philosophy that, to produce real sustainable results, must be adopted by 
employees at all levels of the organization. Also, a Lean operational philos­
ophy can be used in just about any organization. Although Lean was orig­
inally defined and developed for the manufacturing community, today 
Lean or LSS initiatives can be found in almost every organization and 
every industry. For example, LSS is prominent in service organizations, 
manufacturing industries, government agencies, health care, and non­
profit organizations. Of course, each of these industries requires that we 
take a different look at how we apply the tools—not that we will be using 
tools differently, but how we will be applying those tools differently given 
the type of industry that we’re in and what it is we’re trying to achieve in 
terms of process improvement.
Basically, there are two management philosophies used in most organi­
zations today. The first uses a traditional approach, while the second uses 
a Lean, LSS, or world-class approach. Understanding your organization’s 
current management philosophy goes a long way to helping you identify­
ing which Lean concepts you may be lacking in and which Lean tools you

SMED is an approach to reduce output and quality losses due to 
changeovers. Quick changeover is a technique to analyze and 
reduce resources needed for equipment setup, including 
exchange of tools and dies.
Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM) 
TPM is a maintenance program concept that brings 
maintenance into focus in order to minimize downtimes and 
maximize equipment usage. The goal of TPM is to avoid 
emergency repairs and keep unscheduled maintenance to a 
minimum. TPM programs are typically coupled with OEE 
activities, which identify where to focus your TPM activities.

want to apply within your organization. The remainder of this chapter 
presents an overview of both Lean concepts and Lean tools.
TRADITIONAL ORGANIZATION 
OPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY
The term traditional organization is a term we use to describe a set of oper­
ational philosophies, policies, and behaviors that drive all daily activities 
that occur within your organization. We use the term traditional orga­
nization as a reference point to more clearly define what it means to be a 
Lean organization. By describing both traditional (non-Lean) and Lean 
philosophy and beliefs, you will develop some idea of where your organi­
zation currently stands. What is your current organizational operational 
philosophy? What are your collective beliefs as both individuals and the 
organization as a whole?
Table 4.2 depicts some of the basic operational philosophies and beliefs of 
both traditional and Lean organizations. We present this in a point-coun­
terpoint format to try and give readers a good description of where it is they 
currently stand and where it is they’re trying to drive their organization to be.
Table 4.2 identifies a number of traditional organizational beliefs and 
their corresponding Lean organizational beliefs. During the organizational 
transformation from traditional organization to a Lean organization, one 
of the primary objectives of the LSS practitioner is to identify these tradi­
tional operational beliefs, next use the tools and techniques described in 
this handbook to remove those beliefs from the organization, and finally 
replace those beliefs with the Lean beliefs also shown in this table.
For example, let’s discuss one of the traditional beliefs and then present the 
corresponding Lean belief. In this example, we will compare and contrast 
the concepts of “management by head count” and “employees as needed.” 
Often in traditional organizations, managers use a concept called manage­
ment by head count. In this environment the traditional manager only uses 
a very specific number of employees to complete certain components of the 
process that he/she is working with. What this means is that regardless of 
how many employees are needed to meet customer demand, the manager 
fixes the number of employees based upon another measure, usually labor 
dollars. This is done regardless of its impact on customer satisfaction or per­
formance of the customer. Conversely, the Lean manager adds employees as 

106  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
needed to achieve the level of performance that the organization defined for 
the customer. In this environment, the Lean manager puts the voice of the 
customer first, and subsequently builds all of the required internal value-
added activities to meet customer performance expectations.
The difference between these two concepts illustrates how easy it is for waste 
to be introduced into your operational processes when a management by head 
count philosophy is used. By using less than the number of employees that are 
required to meet customer performance, some or all of the traditional nine

wastes are manifested in your organization. It is these operational wastes that 
drag down product quality, diminish employee productivity, and ultimately 
hinder company profitability. The impact that operational philosophy has on 
performance cannot be overstated. Everything we think, say, or do either cre­
ates value for the customer or creates waste.
LEAN OPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY
A Lean operational philosophy is one that flows from an employee’s basic 
fundamental understanding of Lean concepts and beliefs, and should be 
spread across your organization until it becomes a living, breathing, daily 
method of operation for all your employees. The Lean operational philoso­
phy is literally for everyone. In many organizations today trying to imple­
ment Lean, it is often viewed as a set of tools for process improvement.
However, Lean is a true operational philosophy, and in order for your 
organization to become a Lean organization, the philosophy needs to be 
embraced at the highest levels of your company. C-level employees need to 
have an equal and thorough understanding of what it means to be a Lean 
organization in order for your company to effectively become one. Lean 
beliefs and behaviors need to be exhibited on a daily basis by executive 
management, department management, supervisors, and associates alike.
Lean is certainly for everyone. An organization aspiring to become a 
Lean organization must therefore have a master plan to involve 100% of 
their employees in the transformation process. The concept is discussed in 
further detail in Chapter 5.
LEAN MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS
In order to effectively select and apply LSS tools to any process, the man­
agement team must have a basic understanding of Lean concepts as the 
driving force for a Lean operational philosophy. In the absence of this Lean 
operational philosophy, the random selection of process improvement 
tools will not yield the desired results that management hopes to achieve 
from its process improvement programs. In the remainder of this section, 
we discuss the dominant Lean management concepts that fundamentally 
guide effective LSS process improvement programs in your organization.

108  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Waste
What is waste? Waste is typically defined as any activity that your cus­
tomer is unwilling to pay for. It’s usually described in terms of value-added 
(VA) activities versus no-value-added (NVA) activities (discussed below). 
Throughout the literature you’ll find waste defined in terms of eight cat­
egories. These categories are overproduction, excess inventory, waiting, 
defects, extra processing, underutilized employees, motion, and trans­
portation. All of our daily actions either add value from an external cus­
tomer’s standpoint or create one or more of these wastes in our operation.
The primary objective of the LSS practitioner is to learn how to identify 
where these wastes occur, how they occur, and what root causes led to the 
waste being manifested in your operation. Once we understand what these 
wastes are and how to identify them, we can use very specific Lean con­
cepts and tools to eliminate these wastes permanently from our operations.
Value-Added Activities
A value-added (VA) activity is basically any activity that the employee 
conducts that the external customer is willing to pay for. These activities 
are usually comprised as the process steps required to convert some raw 
materials into a modified and useful product for the customer. VA activi­
ties in service industries typically refer to any series of events that enhance 
an external customer experience or assist them with things that they could 
not ordinarily do alone. In order to decide whether an activity is value-
added or not, try putting yourself in the shoes of your external customer. 
If you can effectively say that your external customer would want to pay for 
the activity that you’re about to conduct, then it’s probably a VA activity.
No-Value-Added Activities
No-value-added (NVA) activities are activities that do not contribute to 
meeting external customer requirements and could be eliminated without 
degrading the product or service function or the business, i.e., inspect­
ing parts, checking the accuracy of reports, reworking a unit, rewriting a 
report, etc. There are two kinds of NVA activities:
	
1.	Activities that exist because the process is inadequately designed or 
the process is not functioning as designed. This includes movement, 
waiting, setting up for an activity, storing, and doing work over. 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  109
These activities would be unnecessary to produce the output of the 
process, but occur because of poor-process design. Such activities are 
often referred to as part of poor-quality cost.
	
2.	Activities not required by the external customer or the process and 
activities that could be eliminated without affecting the output to the 
external customer, such as logging in a document.
It has been estimated that as much as 65% of all organizational activities and 
95% of all lead time are consumed by employee NVA activities. This time and 
energy is consumed by an almost endless series of things that we build into 
our processes that the external customer has no use for. If what you’re about 
to do does not appear to be something that you would be willing to pay for as 
an external customer, then the activity should be questioned. Ultimately, all 
NVA activities should be targeted for elimination from your processes.
Business-Value-Added Activities
Since the 1980s there has been dialogue concerning numerous activities 
that are NVA, but which are often required in order to deliver your prod­
uct or service to your customer. We classify these as business-value-added 
(BVA). These could include a range of internal activities, such as account­
ing or order processing to external requirements that could include gov­
ernment regulations (e.g., Food and Drug Administration) or third-party 
stakeholders. In a pure Lean environment it could be argued that there are 
only two possible options for all activities: (1) value-added activities (i.e., 
anything that is required to deliver your product or service for the cus­
tomer) or (2) no-value-added activities (anything that is not required to 
deliver your product or service for the customer). Introducing terms such 
as business-value-added (BVA) only serves to cloud the issue by promoting 
the concept that “some waste is allowable.” How you choose to catego­
rize and quantify VA and NVA activities is up to your organization. In 
most organizations it would be a major mistake to classify certain activi­
ties as NVA, such as activities related to the following: safety, personnel, 
accounts receivable, accounts payable, processing, payroll, environmental, 
legal, taxes, marketing, and many more of the activities required to run 
the business. Communicating to the people in these key processes within 
the organization that their work is NVA would destroy morale through­
out the organization. We agree that the amount of effort and money spent 
in these areas should be minimized and waste should be removed from 

110  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
these important business-required processes, but the organization has to 
be aware of the legal requirements that are imposed upon the organization 
and of the commitments it has to its internal customers and its other stake­
holders. Without living up to these commitments, the organization would 
not be able to meet its external customer requirements and expectations.
Waste Identification
Waste identification is the ability to see something that others cannot. 
In Lean we call this learning to see, a topic that was covered in detail in 
Chapter 3. It’s not that Lean practitioners see any better or worse than we 
do; it’s that they see differently and are viewing the organization with a 
different set of beliefs and preconditions. Waste identification is an ongo­
ing process in an LSS organization. We are constantly learning to see 
waste and understand how waste is manifested. Our view of how waste 
negatively impacts our product quality or performance from a customer 
standpoint changes forever once we begin learning to see.
This process of waste identification using both Lean concepts and 
Lean tools can be used in two ways. First, waste can be identified using 
qualitative techniques, which means using a technique that doesn’t 
necessarily require that we measure anything. This is the primary fun­
damental strength of the Lean portion of LSS. An example of this quali­
tative method is identifying the waste from a Lean management concept, 
such as point of use storage (POUS) or quality of the source. For example, 
once we understand the Lean concept of POUS, we can readily see areas 
in our organization where the concept may be applied for materials, tools, 
instrumentation, paperwork, or other necessary components used in the 
VA process. More importantly, you begin to see the management philoso­
phy that resulted in poor-material storage to begin with.
Second, waste can be identified using quantitative data techniques. 
Quantitative techniques require that we use some form of measurement 
on a particular process to identify where the waste is occurring. This 
approach can be used on many waste identification activities, and it is a 
fundamental strength of the Six Sigma portion of LSS.
Waste Elimination
Once we have identified one or more of the wastes, we are in a position to 
begin to select Lean concepts or Lean tools to apply to that waste in order to 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  111
eliminate it from our processes. At first glance, waste elimination appears 
to be a simple application of Lean tools in a given situation. However, it’s not 
quite that easy. Much of the waste introduced into our organizational pro­
cesses stems not from a simple flaw in the process itself; however, it stems 
from a management belief or operational philosophy regarding the con­
trol of all of our process inputs. As we will discuss later in this handbook, 
the key process inputs are materials, machinery, manpower, methods, and 
measurements. Our operational beliefs on managing these controlling-pro­
cess inputs ultimately define how much waste there will be in our operation, 
where it will be located, what needs to be done to eliminate this waste, and 
what tools we will need to use to eliminate the wastes.
Developing a successful plan for waste elimination encompasses effec­
tive waste identification coupled with a Lean concept or tool selection 
and deployment. These activities are continuously conducted within the 
structure of a Lean management system where managers both support 
and encourage Lean practitioners to take the improvement actions.
There are three fundamental steps that must be followed in order to con­
duct a successful program using an LSS philosophy. These steps are so fun­
damental that each has been given its own chapter in this LSS handbook. 
Value Stream
The value stream refers collectively to all those things required for your 
organization to produce perceived value for the customer. It includes mate­
rials, manpower, facilities, suppliers, or vendors; in essence, it includes 
everything that goes into creating an effective product or service that your 
customers are willing to pay for. The value stream contains all VA and 
NVA waste activities. A central activity for the Lean practitioner is to bet­
ter understand all value stream components, both VA and NVA alike.
Visualizing the value stream is an integral complement of conducting 
any LSS process improvement program. There are several ways that a Lean 
practitioner can attempt to visualize the value stream. For example, to 
visualize a facility layout, the Lean practitioner can prepare a value stream 
map that identifies all the process steps, materials, equipment, facilities, 
employees, and activities required to add value for the customer. It can 
also include the measurements of time or output on those activities.
In a service industry environment defining the value stream is equally 
important. For example, the value stream in a service industry is probably 
composed of a series of steps that need to be effectively taken by employees. 

112  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
They may or may not contain materials and equipment as is traditional with 
manufacturing operations. Much of the value stream can be composed of 
information management, documentation management, or activity man­
agement. Therefore, when trying to identify VA and NVA activities in the 
service environment, our challenge is to identify what activities need to be 
conducted, who needs to conduct those activities, and what accessories are 
required in order to provide a good service that the customer has defined.
When trying to define the value stream of a government agency or nonprofit 
organization, it can be even more complex than with the service industry 
organization or with the manufacturer. For example, nonprofit organiza­
tions are typically restricted by what kind of activities they can conduct, and 
rarely have the resources associated with the service industry organization or 
a manufacturing facility. As a consequence, the identification process of the 
value stream may be more cumbersome and not quite as defined.
Government agencies can have even more complex value streams. 
Whether it is a county, state, or federal government agency, there can often 
be a significant number of stakeholders that all have an influence on the 
operation of the value stream. Each of these stakeholders may have a com­
pletely different view of what value is from their perspective. As a conse­
quence, the challenge for the Lean practitioner in identifying the value 
stream, of which the activities are VA and NVA, and defining the process 
improvement projects to improve the value stream becomes more complex.
In these types of situations it’s often required that you break the value 
stream down into a number of connecting processes. In complex situations 
like this, whether at the service industry, government industry, or government 
agency, value stream management becomes a critical complement of any pro­
cess improvement activity. Having said this, value stream identification and 
management have been effectively applied over the last several years in gov­
ernment agencies. For example, the Navy, Air Force, and Army LSS programs 
have been underway for the past 10 years. Having witnessed some of the sig­
nificant cost reductions in these government agencies, the federal government 
is now considering trying to apply LSS to other federal government agencies.
Value Stream Management
Value stream management consists of a comprehensive approach to man­
aging all aspects of value creation for the customer. A visual representation 
(value stream map(s)) of your entire value stream is created by identifying all 
activities required from the point that the customer initiates contact with your 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  113
organization until the customer finally receives your product or service. This 
visual representation typically includes all the activities required for you to pro­
duce value from a customer standpoint. Throughout the visual representation 
the Lean practitioner endeavors to quantify how those activities are currently 
conducted in an effort to devise a methodology to improve those activities.
Consequently, how your organization defines your value stream is how 
you elect to develop partnerships and relationships with your vendors, 
the operational philosophy you have within your facility, and the meth­
ods with which you go about transferring your VA product or service to 
your customer, and how you measure performance; these are all defined 
as value stream management. An effective value stream management pro­
gram, particularly for complex service industry organizations and govern­
ment agencies or even simple manufacturing processes, typically requires 
the use of visual value stream mapping.
Continuous Flow
Establishing continuous flow is often not as easy as it might sound. The 
ultimate objective of establishing continuous flow is to link all of your VA 
steps seamlessly together, allowing no opportunities for downtime between 
steps. These steps could be automated manufacturing, manual assembly, 
general administrative tasks, warehousing, or shipping and distribution. 
In a service industry environment, the steps could include order process­
ing, service delivery, interaction with the customer, or other VA activities.
Continuous flow has been referred to as the “Holy Grail” in manufac­
turing or service delivery. This is primarily because continuous flow refers 
to the state in which the VA entity flows from the point of inception to 
delivery to the customer. It is commonly accepted that once the organiza­
tion achieves continuous flow, it achieves the highest level of product qual­
ity, productivity, and ultimately company profitability.
Continuous flow is important because once it has been established, it 
eliminates one of the primary wastes—the waste of waiting. Since up to 
95% of all lead time can be waste, the importance of the concept of flow 
to reduce time to the customer cannot be overstated. The creation of flow 
eliminates the waste of waiting and ultimately decreases product cost.
Pull Systems
A pull system is one that is set up to respond directly to customer demand. 
The concept is that your organization will not expend any resources until a

customer has placed demand on one or more of your VA products or ser­
vices. For example, in a build-to-stock environment of a company that pro­
duces products A, B, and C, as the customer places orders and these products 
are consumed from your finished goods inventory, your production facility 
begins to replenish these orders based upon this external customer demand.
Similarly, within your organization sequential process steps can be described 
as “suppliers” and “customers.” As one process step (customer) consumes 
materials from the previous process step (supplier) this signals the supplier to 
replenish those materials that have been consumed. This process flows back 
through your organization to your incoming raw materials. In a true pull sys­
tem all raw material purchases would be tied directly to customer demand. 
Pull systems work in conjunction with continuous flow to help organizations 
align all of their internal VA activities with customer expectations. Because 
this is such a powerful concept, some organizations start with focusing on 
only one thing—“making the product flow” at the demand of the customer.
Point of Use Storage
Point of use storage (POUS) is a term that we use to describe how we deal 
with our materials and tools that we use to add value for our custom­
ers. It is a concept that is exactly as it’s described—POUS means putting 
those materials or tools where they are used by your value-adding employ­
ees. Applying this concept, we can eliminate a number of wastes or NVA 
activities. For example, if we have materials that we need for a particular 
step in a process located in a warehouse several hundred feet from where 
they are used, we need to use resources in order to move those materials 
to the point at which they are used. This adds cost to your product or ser­
vice but no value from a customer standpoint. Moreover, in this example, 
a material that is located a great distance away from where it is actually 
used introduces the wastes of waiting, motion, transportation, and extra 
processing into our process, just to retrieve it and move it to the point at 
which we choose to create value for our customer. The concept of POUS 
is a very powerful waste identification and elimination concept. It can be 
used in almost every environment in some shape or form.
Quality at the Source
Most every organization today uses some form of quality program to 
assure acceptable product quality for the customer. Typically this requires 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  115
inspections or reviews of product or service quality. Unfortunately, one 
cannot inspect in quality; you can only identify that which you failed to 
make up to customer requirements. In the application of Lean concepts 
we strive to achieve “quality of the source,” which is a term that’s used to 
refer to producing quality at each individual VA step. The primary focus 
of quality at the source is to assure that we do not pass along a defect to 
the next step in a process. Similarly to the concept of POUS, quality of the 
source can be used at virtually every step in a process.
It is particularly important to use quality at the source when dealing 
with information management. Poor quality of information is a signifi­
cant source of waste in many organizations today. Inaccurate information 
passed across an organization introduces virtually all nine wastes to vary­
ing degrees. Here are a few simple examples. Has order processing entered 
all of the specific information required to process an order effectively for 
your customer? Can your order be processed defect-free and delivered in 
100% compliance with your customer specifications? If not, you could 
benefit from quality at the source in this process.
When considering a new process, process revision, or revised facility 
layout, quality at the source should be an integral part of that process. As 
with other Lean concepts, there is a Lean tool, mistake proofing, that sup­
ports this effort and is often used to achieve quality at the source.
Just-in-Time
Just-in-time (JIT) is a concept that’s used to describe the just-in-time 
delivery of all services or materials to the next process in your VA pro­
cess. The objective of JIT is to make sure that we minimize the amount of 
materials that we have in our possession at any point in time. Many orga­
nizations have business measures based upon inventory dollars or inven­
tory turns. The concept of JIT was instituted to minimize the waste of 
excess inventory and the negative cash flows of inventory carrying costs.
In a JIT environment the universe of inventory is examined in detail 
with the ultimate target on minimizing inventory costs. Non-Lean orga­
nizations carry significant amounts of raw materials inventory, often 
measured in days’, weeks’, or even months’ supplies. Typical world-class 
organizations carry much less inventory, with some inventory supplies 
being delivered to their operations in 2- to 4-hour increments.
How much inventory we have, how we purchased this inventory, how 
we receive and store this inventory, how we move our inventory around a 

116  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
facility—these all impact whether or not we are using JIT philosophy. All 
inventory represents cost for your organization. The greater your inventory 
levels, the greater your inventory carrying cost will be, and as a consequence, 
this cost will have to be reflected either in your product price or in decreased 
profitability.
Kaizen
The term Kaizen has been described several ways. Kai means “change,” 
while zen means “for the better.’ Another translation would be “change” 
plus “improve.” Kaizen is most commonly described as continuous 
improvement. Kaizen is the foundation of all Lean or LSS process improve­
ment initiatives. Kaizen can be conducted individually, as a part of a pro­
cess improvement team, or as a response to process troubleshooting. These 
three fundamental applications of Kaizen are present and readily observ­
able in all LSS organizations. A detailed description of the application of 
Kaizen concepts is presented and discussed in Chapter 5.
Regardless of whether you conduct Kaizen individually, as a team, or 
in process troubleshooting, applying Kaizen for process improvement 
requires several activities. First, one must be able to look at and take apart 
the current process. Second, you must be able to analyze all the elements of 
that process. Finally, based upon this analysis, you must be able to define 
an improved set of steps in the process that you were investigating.
While much of the literature today refers to Kaizen as a tool (and many 
organizations use Kaizen events as a sole tool for improvement activi­
ties), Kaizen is the single most important LSS operational philosophy. It is 
clearly the most underlying fundamental concept required for successful 
and sustainable process improvement. The ability to deploy Kaizen in any 
of its forms is a primary requisite to becoming an LSS manager. To this 
end, Lean practitioners actively engage all employees at all levels of the 
organization to practice Kaizen on a daily basis.
5M’s—Materials, Machines, Manpower, 
Methods, and Measurements
The 5M’s—materials, machines, manpower, methods, and measure­
ments—represent categories of process input variables. In every organi­
zation each category is composed of several key process input variables. 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  117
The sum of all the key process input variables contained in each of these 
categories can be used to provide an accurate description of your value 
stream. Understanding the nature of each of these categories allows the 
Lean practitioner to accurately describe the component of your organiza­
tional processes and how each component influences the quality of prod­
uct or service delivery for your customer.
Key Process Input Variables (KPIVs)
Fundamental key process input variables (KPIVs) are in essence com­
posed of all the resources required to add value for your customers. More 
effective use of resources is typically a target of organizational process 
improvement programs. For example, under the category of materials, 
one can identify a series of questions that may require analysis in any pro­
cess improvement project. Some of these questions may include:
• Which raw materials are needed?
• How much of each of these raw materials is needed?
• When were these materials purchased?
• How much of each material is purchased?
• How would these materials be packaged by my supplier?
• How often do I take delivery of each material?
• How are the materials transported to my facility?
• Where will the materials be stored within my facility?
• When and how will the materials be transported to the VA location?
• How are they consumed in our value-adding processes?
Key Process Output Variables (KPOVs)
Key process output variables (KPOVs) is basically another term used to 
describe output measures that you want from your processes. Usually 
KPOVs are measures or specifications that your customer has placed upon 
you for service or product delivery. For example, one customer may want a 
certain or specific on-time delivery of your product or service, say, within 
two business days of order. Another KPOV could be defined as some 
aspect of product specification.
KPOV can be either internally focused (designed to achieve an inter­
nal organizational measure) or externally focused (designed to meet some 

118  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
functional requirements set for you by the customer). LSS organizations 
attempt to focus KPOVs on attributes that are defined by the customer. 
Although a few internally focused measures may be desirable, great care 
must be taken not to have too many of these in your internal processes. 
Internally focused measures tend to drive organizations to take their eye 
off customer requirements. This is a common mistake of traditional orga­
nizations that typically develop a large number of KPOVs that are inter­
nally focused, and as a consequence, leads them to situations where they 
produce poor-quality product for their customers.
LEAN TOOLS
In this section we describe the most common Lean tools used in industry 
today and the fundamental nature of each tool. We discuss the purpose 
of the tool, when it is used, and some of the important aspects of why this 
tool is an essential component of your Lean transformation process. These 
sections are not meant to be comprehensive in nature. There are many 
Lean tool books that provide both in-depth descriptions and the methods 
of applying these tools.
As stated earlier, Lean is an operational philosophy, and in reality, there 
are a relatively small number of Lean tools. The real power in applying Lean 
tools is in coupling this effort with one of the previously described Lean con­
cepts. One of the largest misconceptions in American management today 
is that Lean tools in and of themselves will produce significant productiv­
ity improvements. Applying Lean tools solely as tools does not yield the 
process improvement that many organizations are attempting to achieve or 
that are typically associated with true Lean initiatives. An overview of the 
prominent Lean tools is presented in the remainder of this section.
5S Workplace Organization and Standardization
Definition
5S Workplace Organization and Standardization is an LSS tool used to 
organize basic housekeeping activities and standardize materials, machin­
ery, manpower, and methodologies used in your value-adding activities.

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  119
Just the Facts
The most fundamental of all the Lean tools is 5S Workplace Organization 
and Standardization. The concept of 5S Workplace Organization and 
Standardization was presented in the book entitled Five Pillars of the 
Visual Workplace, by Hiroyuki Hirano.* Workplace Organization and 
Standardization is a fundamental building block of any LSS organization. 
As described in the Lean concepts section, the Holy Grail in any process is 
continuous flow. If a process is poorly organized or not standardized, it is 
very difficult to establish continuous flow. This is one reason most organi­
zations begin an implementation of Lean with the fundamental introduc­
tion to 5S Workplace Organization and Standardization. There are many 
case studies in the literature that cite the importance of 5S to their Lean 
initiatives. Moreover, an effective 5S program is a prerequisite to applying 
Lean tools, and achieving sustainable meaningful results.
The purpose of 5S is to arrive at a safe, neat, orderly workplace where 
everything required to perform for your customer is readily acces­
sible by your employees. Implementing 5S Workplace Organization and 
Standardization results in a commonsense work area with an organized 
sequence of activities required in your value-added processes.
5S Means Action
5S Workplace Organization and Standardization programs are comprised 
of five phases of activities. Each of these five phases is required if your 
organization is to successfully implement a 5S program.
• Sort: The first S is sort. Sort means just that; you select a target area 
and sort through everything that is in that area. The objective is to 
eliminate anything that is not needed. That means you are trying to 
leave only the bare essentials that are required for the VA steps in 
that area.
	
	
At first glance this may seem like a very easy thing to do. However, 
once you begin this process of sorting, you will quickly find that 
there are a large number of things in any given area that are wanted 
but probably not needed. Because this is common in most organi­
zations, a procedure has been established to help with the sorting 
process. This procedure is referred to as red tagging.
*	 Hiroyuki Hirano, Five Pillars of the Visual Workplace, Productivity, Inc. Portland, OR, 1995.

120  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Note:  It is very important that the red tag is used to indicate that the 
item is “wanted but not needed” and is readily differentiated (size, 
shape, and shade of red) from the red tag used on rejected parts.
	
	
Red tagging is a concept whereby employees sort through every­
thing that is located in the target area. When conducting red tagging, 
a few simple questions are used to decide whether or not what you’ve 
identified is needed or not. Is this item needed? If so, where should 
it be located? Also, what quantity of this item is needed? During this 
process you will run across a large number of items that you’re not 
sure what to do with. These items should be “red tagged.” A red tag 
is nothing more than a tag that identifies critical information about 
the item, such as what the item is, where it was found, what date you 
found it, reason it was tagged, and possible disposition for the item. 
Once red tagged, the item is moved to the red tag area, where it is 
reviewed by a supervisor or manager for proper disposition.
• Set-in-order: Once the sorting is completed, you are ready for set-
in-order. The process of setting items in order of use is very simple 
in concept; however, it requires discipline on the part of the user to 
identify exactly where all VA materials should be stored and how they 
should be prepared for use in everyday activities. The act of setting 
items in order by its very nature requires that the Lean practitioner 
standardize the work area. Care should be taken during this pro­
cess to consider all employee interactions. For example, one should 
consider the workforce, such as: Are the employees right-handed or 
left-handed? Are there possible disabled or handicapped employees, 
and how do we set-in-order for the employee that may be color blind? 
These are critical factors for set-in-order.
	
	
Once completed, it should be visibly obvious to all where every 
tool, material, fixture, or other items used in the VA process are to be 
stored. This process of standardizing the workplace makes it easier 
for multiple employees to use the same work area and complete VA 
activities in a standardized fashion.
• Shine: With sort and set-in-order completed, the next objective is to 
make sure that the entire area is completely clean. Shine is another sim­
ple activity; it just requires that you clean an area and make it ready for 
use. Typically, there are two valuable components of the shine activity. 
First, make sure that the entire area is clean and swept; this includes 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  121
floors, aisles, and any areas in or around where VA activities need to be 
conducted. Second, owner’s shine has to do with the removal of dust 
or dirt or grime from any of the floors, workbenches, tables, computer 
areas, and office equipment that are in use on a daily basis. Adding the 
discipline of shine to your 5S program requires that you really take a 
close look at everything that is used in the VA process. The result of 
this is that once completed, everything in or around the work area is 
in a state of readiness for use whenever it’s needed.
	
	
The importance of shine cannot be overstated. Organizations 
that fail to do a thorough shine process inevitably regress to a less 
organized, less productive work space. The planning process should 
become a fundamental component of our everyday activities. In 
order to make the shine activity a standard part of your operational 
procedures, one may choose to look at it similarly to that of personal 
hygiene. Few, if any of us, would consider leaving for work in the 
morning without performing any one of a number of various activi­
ties required to make ourselves personally ready for our day, i.e., tak­
ing a shower, brushing our teeth, and fixing our hair. This kind of 
philosophy needs to be adopted during the shine campaign in your 
organization. It must be daily. It must be routine. It must be a part of 
who the organization is.
	
	
Another reason that the shine campaign is so important is that defects 
are often hidden in a clumsy, dirty, dusty, dark, or otherwise unclean 
environment. Many of the defects that we produce are often tied to an 
unclean work area. The cleaning process also affords the employee time 
to take a closer look at all of those items—materials, tools, computers 
etc.—that we use during the VA process. This type of inspection allows 
us to identify potential problems before they become too serious and 
result in poor-quality products or services for our customers.
• Standardize: The concept of standardize is a little different from 
the concepts of sort, set-in-order, and shine. Standardize requires 
a different thought process and is a technique that is used to define 
the consistent application of sort, set-in-order, and shine activi­
ties. Standardize is the difference between a sporadic, once-in-
a-while approach to workplace organization and a systematic, 
continuous, and routine approach to maintaining your work space. 
Organizations that do not put the fourth S—standardize—in place 

122  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
and do not make standardize a daily habit revert back to old habits, 
and as a consequence, the workplace is never maintained in a state 
of readiness.
	
	
Standardize is the phase where companies begin to falter. The 
reason for this is that we have many activities that happen on a 
daily basis that we would consider not standard in our workplace. 
That means there are many things that happened only once in a 
while or only today or only this week. The result is that materials 
that are often used or excess supplies required for a one-time event 
begin to creep into our work spaces. When we apply standardize 
on a daily basis, it forces us to take action on these one-time events, 
that is, to change the uncontrolled “happen” event into the con­
trolled or standardized “occur” event. How often have you heard 
yourself say: “I’ll just put this here” or “This is just for today” or 
“We never really do this, but I have to do it this way this after­
noon.” Each of these thought processes results in the breakdown of 
standardize and the circumvention of sort, set-in-order, and shine 
philosophies.
	
	
Ultimately, the essence of standardize is to prevent any work area 
from returning to its original disorganized state. This is typically 
accomplished by using standardized tools, such as checklists or check 
sheets, cleaning schedules, and a visual map of what the area should 
look like. These tools typically identify all the activities required to 
effectively complete sort, set-in-order, shine, and standardize on a daily 
basis.
• Sustain: The fifth S is sustain. If your organization is to be success­
ful at maintaining an effective 5S program, you must develop the 
discipline to keep sustain alive in your organization on a daily basis. 
This means allowing the time, energy, effort, and resources required 
to maintain your 5S program. Sustain is nothing more than mak­
ing a habit of sort, set-in-order, shine, and standardize activities. It 
is basically demonstrating that your organization is committed to 
a company culture that accepts nothing less than a daily active 5S 
Workplace Organization and Standardization program. Many orga­
nizations make it through the first four S’s, yet lack the commitment 
to make it a part of their core daily activities. As soon as the sustain 
efforts dwindle or falter, your organization will revert back to its previ­
ous disorganized environment.

Common Omissions When Implementing 5S
The 5S Workplace Organization and Standardization tool is for everyone 
everywhere in the organization all the time. It is both a concept and a tool 
encompassing an everyday way of life in your organization. The strength 
of the tool is that it can be started small; by that we mean that it can be 
used to improve small areas of your organization independently. Ultimately, 
the entire organization should be implementing 5S to the point where it is 
part of the organizational DNA. Unfortunately, efforts commonly falter at 
the standardize and sustain phases. In many organizations a casual walk-
through exposes the remnants of past failed attempts to embrace and adopt 
this, the simplest of Lean tools. A list of 10 common omissions from 5S 
programs is listed below. These are implementation aspects to keep in mind 
when adopting a 5S Workplace Organization and Standardization program.
	
1.	Not including the entire facility, inside and out. This includes every 
space—office, parking lot, hall, work space, closet, storage area, ware­
house, break room, bathroom, copy center, call center, distribution 
facility, company vehicles, etc.
	
2.	Not including the entire staff. If anywhere in your organization the 
mind set of “5S is for someone else” is present, your 5S program will 
not be successful.
	
3.	Abandoning the 5S effort before all required 5S activities are in your 
organizational DNA and are a visible, daily, and cyclic set of com­
monly re-occurring activities.
	
4.	Not allowing employee time for complete 5S understanding and 
implementation.
	
5.	Not allowing employee time for regularly scheduled 5S activities to 
be conducted at certain points in the day or night, daily, weekly, 
and/or monthly.
	
6.	Not investing in required housekeeping and standardization 
tools—cleaning materials, visual control indicators, or standard 
location markers.
	
7.	Not documenting 5S activities. Many companies go through an ini­
tial 5S program, and because the concepts and activities are simple 
in nature, they do not document and standardize the processes. 
Checklists, cleaning schedules, visual maps, before and after photos, 
and visual controls are all essential components of 5S documentation.

124  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
	
8.	Not having 5S standard work for all associates, managers, and execu­
tives. That’s right—managers and executives. It is commonly recog­
nized that today manager standard work is essential for 5S success.
	
9.	Not setting up a 5S visual workplace display that shows the entire 
company’s participation in the 5S program and is a living evolving 
display of ongoing 5S activities company-wide.
	 10.	Not encouraging, supporting, acknowledging, and rewarding employee 
participation for ongoing creative 5S activities.
Overall Equipment Effectiveness
Definition
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is an LSS tool used to monitor 
equipment effectiveness by measuring equipment availability, perfor­
mance, and product quality of the equipment. In semiautomated or fully 
automated environments OEE becomes a foundation for Total Productive 
Maintenance programs and LSS process improvement projects.
Just the Facts
Overall equipment effectiveness is a tool that was developed predomi­
nantly for the manufacturing sector. It was created to measure equipment 
effectiveness in companies that use equipment to add value or create 
products for customers. This tool is perfectly suited for this outcome. 
However, the strength of this tool conceptually reaches far beyond equip­
ment and can be applied in many nonmanufacturing environments. In 
addition to its application in a manufacturing environment, we will also 
show how to modify the OEE calculation to be used in nonmanufacturing 
environments.
The primary purpose of OEE is to measure how effective your VA 
equipment usage is. In a manufacturing environment OEE is also a sec­
ondary measure of productivity. OEE is often used as a foundation for 
evaluating the Total Productive Maintenance programs and deciding 
where to apply your maintenance dollars to receive the greatest improve­
ment impact on equipment reliability. A well-run OEE measurement 
system can also be used as a foundation for assessing new capital equip­
ment acquisitions.

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  125
Although OEE is an effective tool, as with all measures, there is one caveat 
here. The concept of optimizing equipment utilization at the expense of 
other key process inputs, such as materials or manpower, was a common 
mistake when OEE was first introduced, and is still present today. In an 
environment where salaries were low and equipment costs were high, it was 
easy to fall into the trap of requiring employees to be chained to equipment 
to achieve high productivity levels. An LSS environment mandates that we 
balance the proper amounts of materials (to reduce inventory), equipment 
(to meet customer demand), and utilization of the human factor (to be flex­
ible to changing customer requirements). This synergy of process inputs 
demonstrates effective use of Lean concepts and tools and reinforces that 
we maintain a true process focus. It also provides a foundation that steers 
us away from the common misuses of LSS tools.
How to Use OEE
The use of OEE relies on three direct measurements of your equipment and 
the products produced by your equipment. These are equipment availabil­
ity, equipment performance, and product quality. In essence, the objective 
of OEE is to identify and quantify equipment-related losses that decrease 
productivity. Once identified, these loss areas are targets for Kaizen.
• Equipment availability: Equipment availability is a measure of 
equipment readiness when your organization needs equipment to 
add value. This is basically composed of scheduled operating time 
minus any downtime losses that occur during that scheduled operat­
ing time. The result of the equipment availability analysis is the actual 
time that your equipment was running. This is often referred to as 
runtime or uptime.
	
Availability = Uptime/Scheduled operating time
• Equipment performance: Once the runtime has been established, 
we can look at equipment performance. Equipment performance is 
defined as your target output for equipment running at maximum 
speed minus any speed losses that occur during operation. The result 
of equipment performance analysis is your actual output.
	
Performance = Actual output/Target output

126  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Product quality: Product quality is a measure of your good product 
divided by actual (total) output. The result is your good product output.
	
Quality = Good products/Actual output
	
OEE (%) = Availability × Performance × Quality
Applying OEE in Nonmanufacturing Environments
The concept of overall equipment effectiveness can also be used in non­
manufacturing environments. To use the OEE calculation in nonmanu­
facturing environments all one needs to do is replace the middle term 
equipment with the term value-added. This gives us overall value-added 
effectiveness (OVAE). We can now define OEE in terms of OVAE.
• Value-adding availability: Every organization today conducts some 
form of VA activities for their customers. In order to complete the 
OVAE, your organization must define an element that adds value 
for your customers. This could be in the form of the number of pro­
cess inputs that add value. For example, this could be the number of 
employees available in a service industry environment. In the health 
care industry this could be the number of nursing staff available in a 
specific wing of the hospital. In a call center this could be the num­
ber of call center representatives available to take incoming calls. The 
VA availability component of OVAE is therefore:
	
VA availability = Working time/Scheduled time
• Value-adding performance: Value-adding performance can be defined 
as your actual service delivery output divided by your target service 
delivery output. Similarly to in an equipment environment, VA employ­
ees run into a number of speed-related delivery losses during their daily 
activities. The VA performance component of OVAE is therefore:
	VA performance = Actual service delivery output/Target service
	
delivery output
• Product or service quality: Whether you are delivering a product 
or a service to your customer, the quality of that product or service 
can be measured. Service delivery defects can be described as actual 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  127
service output divided by good service output. The service quality 
component of OVAE is therefore:
	
Service quality = Good service output/Actual service output
	
OVAE (%) = VA availability × VA performance × Service quality
Mistake Proofing
Definition
Mistake proofing is an LSS tool used to minimize or eliminate mis­
takes (errors) that produce defects in a product, a process, or a service.
Just the Facts
Mistake proofing* is a tool that is used to minimize or eliminate errors 
and their subsequent defects in any process. No matter how hard we try, 
whenever we put together materials, machinery, manpower, and meth­
ods, we are bound to make some errors. These errors produce unwanted 
defects for our customers. The art of mistake proofing endeavors to elimi­
nate mistakes where they occur by redefining activities and developing 
techniques to mitigate the defect before it happens.
So what is the purpose of conducting mistake proofing in our organi­
zation? Why would you want to eliminate mistakes from occurring in 
our organization? First, eliminating mistakes basically means that we are 
improving performance for customers, helping to generate customer sat­
isfaction, and ultimately customer loyalty to purchase our product or ser­
vice in the future. One way to look at mistake proofing is as a program to 
guarantee future income for your organization.
Another critical reason to conduct mistake proofing is that mistakes 
introduce additional cost to your product or service. Every time a mistake 
occurs, additional actions need to be taken before you can deliver your 
product or service to your customer, all of which add cost and no value from 
*	 Mistake-Proofing for Operators, Shop Floor Series, Productivity Press, New York, 1996.

128  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
the customer standpoint. Many of these mistakes detract from company 
profitability but are not accounted for in everyday productivity monitoring 
systems.
Another factor is that every time a mistake occurs, resources are used. 
That means that lowering the number of mistakes in your organization 
will inherently be lowering how many resources are required by your 
organization at any point in time. This further decreases the overall cost 
of your product or service.
How to Use Mistake Proofing
Mistake proofing is typically applied using some variation of the Plan-Do-
Check-Act (PDCA) cycle. It is primarily a tool to help your organization 
achieve the Lean concept of quality at the source. In its most basic form 
your objective is to isolate any process step or task during the Do-Check 
portion of the PDCA cycle. Achieving an effective check at the point of 
execution is critical to assuring that no error, mistake, or defect is pro­
duced at any individual process step and passed along to the next VA step.
One way to achieve this is by applying the concept of “negative analysis.”* 
This technique is used to identify and define what can go wrong in a process, 
and subsequently designing a process that will not allow a mistake to occur. 
The analysis includes observations and investigations of the interactions 
between materials, manpower, and equipment during the process. Creative, 
“no-mistake” solutions are developed as a result of the negative analysis.
Mistake proofing can be used wherever there is an interaction between 
two entities during a process step. Some examples include interaction 
between two employees, an employee-customer or employee-supplier 
interaction, an employee and a piece of equipment, an employee-material 
activity, an employee-method step, or during any measurement activity. 
For example, an office environment example of mistake proofing may be 
something as simple as setting the fields of an order entry form so that an 
inaccurate piece of data could not be entered.
With the ever-increasing accuracy and speed of digital photography, 
even high-speed manufacturing processes (e.g., stamping) are able to 
inspect and record, via digital photograph, products that are produced at 
thousands of pieces per minute. As soon as a manufactured piece is out

of a predefined visual specification range, the machine is stopped. Prior 
to this type of technology, thousands of pieces would’ve been stamped, 
creating a tremendous number of defects at a substantial cost to the man­
ufacturer. This type of mistake proofing technology virtually eliminates 
the need in many instances for tedious and expensive quality control 
checks.
Cellular Manufacturing
Definition
Cellular manufacturing is an LSS tool used to organize VA activities 
into the most effective (highest productivity) and least resource con­
suming (lowest cost per unit) series of activities to deliver the perfect 
product or service to the customer.
Just the Facts
Cellular manufacturing is best described as a Lean tool that is used to 
make the best use of resources during your VA activities. These resources 
typically include raw materials, manpower, equipment, and facilities. 
Manufacturing cells are most effective when there is a known steady 
demand for your product or service and products can be grouped by com­
mon VA steps. With customer demand known, you are able to sequence 
the flow of materials in your facility and apply the necessary manpower 
and equipment to best deliver your product. Creating a cell typically 
requires that we tie together all manual and semiautomatic (equipment) 
VA steps with the ultimate goal of making all of the VA steps and conse­
quently your product flow at the demand of the customer.
As with all manufacturing process improvement tools, the primary pur­
pose of cellular manufacturing is to enhance customer satisfaction and 
improve organizational profitability. A well-designed manufacturing cell 
can provide several positive outputs for both company and customer:
• Decrease lead time to your customer
• Improve product quality
• Decrease total inventory required and inventory carrying costs
• Minimize labor content as a percent of product cost

130  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Since the inception of cellular manufacturing and one-piece flow con­
cepts, it has been generally accepted that manufacturing cells produce 
the highest-quality products, allow for the highest productivity, and ulti­
mately produce the highest profitability when compared with traditional 
in-line manufacturing processes.
How to Create Manufacturing Cells
The application of manufacturing cells draws together the use of several 
Lean concepts previously discussed. These include point of use storage 
(POUS), quality at the source, just-in-time (JIT), Kanban, and facility lay­
out (i.e., process flow layout, not a function department layout), to name a 
few. The objective in cell design is to identify and eliminate as much NVA 
time and activities as possible from the current process by organizing all 
VA activities in the best sequence.
There are five key steps to the successful design and implementation of 
a cell.
Step 1: Group products. The first step in cell design is to understand 
your product groupings. To do this, you must first construct a list 
of products and then identify all the process steps required by each 
product. It’s usually easiest if you just make a matrix with product 
types on one axis and process steps on the other. After checking off 
which process steps are required by each product, it is easy to identify 
and group products by their respective process steps. After your prod­
ucts have been grouped, you can undergo the task of creating specific 
cells to manufacture or assemble all the products in each group.
Step 2: Measure demand (calculate Takt time). Once the products 
have been grouped, we must now calculate or measure the demand 
rate of each product. The demand rate is just the rate at which your 
customer requires that you produce your product or provide your 
service. The demand rate is the amount of working time available 
divided by the number of units sold and is typically reported as 
units per hour or activities per day. Understanding the demand rate 
of your customer is a critical prerequisite to designing a cell. Cells 
typically work best when the demand rate is somewhat constant. 
If your demand rate is erratic or unpredictable, you will need to 
consider adding a visual control supermarket along with your cell 
design.

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  131
Step 3: Chart current work sequence. For each product you must next 
chart your current work sequence. This is typically accomplished 
using a time observation chart to document each element of the 
work sequence and record the time to complete each work sequence 
element. This time observation process is an essential complement 
of deconstructing work activities and then re-assembling them back 
into a new and balanced continuous flow work sequence.
Step 4: Combine work and balance process. Once you have accu­
rately recorded times for each element in the work sequence, you 
are now in a position to combine some work elements and balance 
the process to achieve the correct demand rate or output for the 
customer. This is accomplished by grouping elements to achieve 
the time that is less than or equal to the demand rate. For example, 
if the calculated demand rate is 10 minutes per unit for a specific 
product, then each individual element in the work sequence must 
be 10 minutes or less to complete. The closer you get each indi­
vidual element to 10 minutes, the more continuous and smooth 
your work product flow will be. Work sequence balancing is not 
an exact science, but with some analysis of your time observation 
chart you will clearly be able to recognize significant disruptions 
in work flow associated with unbalanced work element times.
Step 5: Create new cell work sequence. After completion of steps 1 to 4, 
you are now in a position to create a completely new work cell sequence. 
During this step you complete a work flow layout that includes all mate­
rials and equipment manpower required to complete the work sequence. 
The primary objectives are to (1) simplify material flow by integrating 
process elements, (2) minimize material handling, and (3) make use of 
people for 100% of the demand rate time. In essence, your goal is to tie 
together and establish continuous flow of each work element. How you 
sequence these is dependent upon the actual work elements; however, 
it is best achieved by using one of the known successful cell configura­
tions. The most common include the U-cell and S-cell configurations.
Kanban
Definition
Kanban means “signal.” It is an LSS tool used to make visible the 
requirement for action on the part of employees.

132  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Just the Facts
Kanban* is the Japanese word for “card” or “sign,” whose function is to 
relay information along with materials that tell employees exactly what to 
produce at any given point in your process. Most VA processes have a sig­
nificant number of process steps. The beauty of Kanban is that it connects 
a series of process steps in a fashion that allows continuous flow. As we 
discussed earlier in this chapter, continuous flow is the Holy Grail of any 
process. Kanban is a critical tool to establishing flow in a process.
The purpose of using Kanban in a process is to regulate the flow of 
information and materials between employees by connecting sequential 
VA process steps. Kanban systems allow you to define the exact quantities 
of products that are required to meet your customer demand. The ben­
efit of this system is that you produce only what the customer requested, 
therefore eliminating any tendency for overproduction, one of the nine 
wastes.
How to Use Kanban
Kanban is used as an information-inventory control system by two sequen­
tial steps in the process. It can be used by steps that are directly adjacent to 
each other, those that are separated by great distances, or between differ­
ent types of equipment at varying stages of your VA process. The Kanban 
signal system answers the question of “what to do next” that is required by 
employees to achieve high levels of productivity. One caveat is that Kanban 
typically only works well within stable demand environments. With the 
relatively stable demand, order points and order quantities within suc­
cessive steps of the process can be defined. These are the foundation of a 
Kanban system.
Typically, a Kanban card identifying product name, photo, requesting 
department, and quantity desired is shuttled between the consumer of the 
product and the producer of the product.
Kanban is also a very powerful supply chain tool. It can and is being 
effectively used to make the supplier-customer materials management 
process more effective up and down the supply chain. Kanban containers 
are common tools between world-class organizations managing materials 
to meet customer demand.
*	 Kanban for the Shop Floor, Shop Floor Series, Productivity Press, New York, 2002.

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  133
Another method of Kanban signals is with vendor-managed inven­
tory scheduling. This typically has a supplier being granted secured 
access to the customers’ information management system to monitor 
the real-time direct consumption of products. At prespecified points of 
consumption the supplier is signaled to prepare and ship product. This 
practice is becoming more common as companies strive to decrease 
lead times and inventories by taking advantage of global information 
sharing technologies. World-class companies are partnering through 
technology to create value for each other in ways not possible just 10 
years ago.
Value Stream Mapping
Definition
Value stream mapping is an LSS tool used to map all activities (both 
VA and NVA) across your value stream. The tool allows for a visual 
representation or maps of resources allocation as you conduct business 
today (current state) as well as how you plan to add value in the future 
(future state).
Just the Facts
Value stream mapping (VSM) is a technique that’s used to develop a 
visual representation of all the activities required for you to add value for 
your customer. It’s typically conducted in a two-step process. The first 
step is to construct a current state map. In the current state you review 
every single activity that’s currently being conducted in order to provide 
your product or service for your customers. The current state map is used 
to give a fairly accurate definition and description of what your organiza­
tion currently does for your customer. This is critical for your organiza­
tion to begin to understand the weaknesses of your current process and to 
identify what needs to be improved to improve performance for your cus­
tomer. During the creation of the current state map, identify on the map 
as many of the nine wastes as possible, indicating where these wastes are 
present. Once a current state process map has been completed and sig­
nificant waste throughout the process is identified, the second step of the 
VSM program can be completed, which is preparing a future state map.

134  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
The future state map defines and outlines a visual representation of how 
you want your organization to perform at some point in the future. It typi­
cally endeavors to describe an ideal state, that is, a state in which you iden­
tified and eliminated a significant amount of waste that existed in your 
current state map.
There are many software packages available today for VSM. Some are 
simple icon-based systems to help with preparation of current state and 
future state visual maps. Others are more complex and allow for the inclu­
sion of many process variables, such as materials, employees, and cycle 
times and/or lead times. The most complex allow for computer process 
model development and sophisticated simulations of “what if” process 
change scenarios of selected process variables. Regardless of the complex­
ity of your selected VSM solution, all options can allow you to significantly 
improve your processes using the VSM techniques.
Managing with Maps
Using VSMs to manage improvement activities is an effective way to organize, 
prioritize, deploy, and manage improvement activities. Using a technique 
called managing with maps is an effective approach to tie process perfor­
mance acceleration and align organizational objectives from strategic plans to 
tactical improvement plans. In The Organizational Alignment Handbook, we 
describe the seven phases of the organizational alignment cycle.* The manag­
ing with maps technique would be developed and deployed in phases I, II, and 
VI. A brief overview of using managing with maps to align and manage orga­
nizational objectives is given below. Each view would require the preparation 
of current state and future state views at each level in the organization. These 
maps are used as the primary improvement management tools.
• Strategic view: The strategic view VSM shows a complete view of 
the value stream from customer contact to customer receipt of prod­
uct or service. It identifies high-level process steps and includes key 
departments, high-level performance measures that all lower-level 
measures will roll up to. This map should allow all employees to see 
how their participation supports the organization’s strategic objec­
tives. It also identifies high-level improvement initiatives targeted for 
the map time period.

Raton, FL, 2012.

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  135
• Department view: The department view VSM shows a complete view 
of the value stream within a department. It identifies department-
level process steps and assigns key department measures. These 
maps encompass resources coming into or being used within the 
department and all the VA products or services exiting the depart­
ment. It identifies Kaizen activities or continuous improvement team 
activities.
• Process view: The process view VSM shows a complete view of 
each process within a department. It identifies detailed views of 
each process and assigns key department measures to each pro­
cess. These maps encompass resources coming into or being used 
within each process and all the VA products or services exiting the 
process. It identifies Kaizen activities or continuous improvement 
team activities, current state performance, and future state targets 
for improvement.
• Measure view: The measure view VSM shows a complete view of 
all measures within a process. It identifies specific measures of vari­
ous process steps and allows for monitoring and aligning multiple 
measures of a process. Using this technique allows for measurement 
management and eliminates conflicting measures within a process. 
This is particularly important in complex systems or regulated envi­
ronments such as health care or medical products manufacturing.
Using the management with maps approach allows complete organiza­
tional alignment. It provides a mechanism for measurement roll-up from 
the most specific process step measurement to department objectives, and 
ultimately to strategic initiatives. These VSMs are a powerful visual man­
agement and communication tool.
Visual Controls
Definition
Visual control is an LSS tool used to describe “what to do next” for 
employees without using words. They are pictures or diagrams used 
to regulate employee activities, such as displaying activity instruc­
tions, identifying safety hazards, or restricting employee access, to 
name a few.

136  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Just the Facts
Visual controls are simple signals that show at a glance what needs to be 
done. They are simplifications of systems that, when implemented effec­
tively, require no communication between employees in order to signal 
what action should be taken. Think about that for a second—no com­
munication! No e-mail, no information management system interaction, 
no phone interaction, no reading standard operating procedures or good 
manufacturing practices. These are all no-value-adding, time-robbing 
activities that the customer is unwilling to pay for.
Some visual control examples that describe necessary actions are where 
a material should be moved, what raw material or sub-assembly should 
be replenished, which orders need to be entered, which patients should be 
waited on first, etc.
How to Use Visual Controls
Visual controls are becoming more and more prevalent in many organi­
zations. In multilingual environments visual controls can eliminate the 
need for translations. In organizations where employees may have handi­
caps, such as color blindness, for example, visual controls using geometric 
shapes can be incorporated into work instructions.
The visual control example in Table 4.3 will assist you in developing 
visual controls in virtually any environment. The table puts together con­
trol type, purpose, and several examples of common controls. This is a 
powerful tool for process improvement. Now that you have been intro­
duced to them, look for aspects of your processes that would benefit from 
visual controls.
THE POWER OF LEAN CONCEPTS AND LEAN TOOLS
Throughout this chapter we have described a series of the most common 
but powerful Lean concepts and Lean tools used in process improvement 
activities. In this section we will present an example that demonstrates 
the proper application of the Lean operational philosophy, which com­
bines the Lean concepts and tools described in this chapter. The synergy, 
strength, and power of coupling a Lean operational philosophy and Lean 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  137
tools to effectively organize key input variables (5M’s) are demonstrated 
in this example. Remember, only by managing inputs can we improve 
outputs. When looking to harness the power of LSS, endeavor to use as 
many of the concepts and tools as possible along your process.
Several Lean concepts or tools described in this chapter were used in 
unison in the composite U-cell case study described below. The term com­
posite U-cell simply means we joined two U-cells to establish continuous 
flow for the production of the entire finished product. This example also 
shows both creativity and innovation that can be achieved to arrive at sim­
ple solutions that deliver powerful process improvements. The following

Composite U-Cell Case Study
• Situation: A manufacturer of complex medical instrumentation 
was producing approximately 45 blood dialysis units/week operat­
ing two shifts in an enclosed electrostatic discharge (ESD) room. 
The company was regularly receiving orders for 60 units/week. 
There was no room for expansion, and the company was restricted 
to assembly in the current assembly area. The challenge was to 
implement process improvements and achieve 60 units/week with 
the existing staff, assembly area, and test equipment. Previous 
attempts to increase production beyond the 45 units/week level 
had resulted in significant quality problems and an actual reduc­
tion in output.
• Cell design activities: The Kaizen continuous improvement team 
created a “first of its kind” composite U-cell using the five-step 
cell design process. The composite cell is actually two cells oper­
ating in unison. Cell design for each cell included product group­
ing, Takt time, line balancing, work sequencing, and facility 
layout for a total of 38 workstations, over 50 assembly and test 
employees, and the assembly of over 4,000 parts.
• How the composite cell operates: Raw materials flow from the outside 
of each cell toward the inside of each cell via a series of sub-assembly 
workstations. Simultaneously, each major component, hydraulics 

Lean Concepts, Tools, and Methods  •  139
assembly and chassis assembly, flows in the U-shaped pattern on the 
inside of each cell, consuming sub-assemblies along the way. Final 
assembly of the hydraulics and chassis takes place at the work center 
between the cells as the last assembly step before transferring the 
final product to testing.
Lean Six Sigma Concepts and Tools Used
• Kaizen teams were used as the primary change management tool for 
cell design and implementation.
• The Kaizen and you method was used by individual employees 
for bench improvements along with 5S Workplace Organization 
and Standardization.
• During each cell design, the teams utilized continuous flow, pull 
systems, visual controls and instructions, standardized work, 
POUS, quality at the source, Kanban, mistake proofing, and facil­
ity layout.
• During cell “try-storms” workbench layouts were designated, and 
POUS and materials flows were established with replenishment 
occurring as materials were consumed using visual controls and 
Kanban cards and containers quantities.
• Quality @ the source and mistake proofing were incorporated 
into employee sub-assemblies activities. Two space visual controls 
located on the sub-assembly work center regulated materials flow 
within the cells. As the hydraulics assembly consumes each series of 
sub-assemblies, workers at each sub-assembly bench were signaled 
to replenish these parts.
• Well-defined Takt time assured continuous flow throughout each cell.
• Final assembly and testing proceeded without errors and sub-assembly 
rework that had previously hindered productivity.
Figure  4.1 shows details of the final composite U-cell layout, which 
includes raw materials’ storage on the exterior of the cells, sub-assembly 
workstations, employee deployment, final assembly cart progression, and 
in-process and final test stations.

SUMMARY
There are four key LSS learning points to take away from this chapter. The 
true LSS manager or practitioner integrates these four characteristics into 
his/her daily beliefs and activities to achieve performance improvement.
• Learn to “see” waste. Waste is almost everywhere in your organiza­
tion. Increase your understanding of what causes each of the nine 
wastes. Wherever any of the 5M’s interact, there is waste potential. 
Notice the activities revolving around VA processes. Focus on mate­
rials, machinery, methods, man/woman power, and measurements. 
These inputs are source points for all waste creation.
• Embrace the power of observation—stop and watch the process.

his employees, so much so that he would draw a circle on the floor and

ity using the same floor space, number of employees, and existing test equipment.

make shop floor managers stand in it and observe the process until they 
identified and understood where the waste was. These events could last 
hours with Ohno’s intermittent checks to see if managers could identify 
the waste. His learning objective was a simple one: You cannot improve 
a process when you cannot see what to improve or where to improve.
• Learn the LSS concepts and apply the LSS tools. Begin to better 
understand the range of LSS concepts and how they interact with 
each other. Understand the warning signs that a traditional oper­
ational philosophy is at work and contributing to waste. These are 
typically starting points for process improvement projects. Apply the 
tools and monitor their effects on performance measures. Remember, 
LSS is a learning process. The more you use the tools, the better you 
will get at effectively improving processes.
Use the concepts and tools in groups to achieve enhanced performance 
improvement. Using LSS concepts and tools in groups can result in signif­
icant performance improvement. Revisit the composite U-cell case study 
as an example of grouping concepts and tools.

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, 
Kaikaku, and Kakushin
Kaizen—Small change
Kaikaku—Transformation of mind
Kakushin—Innovation
It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.
—W. Edwards Deming
IN A NUTSHELL
Improvement means change. Today more than ever the ability of an orga­
nization to change quickly and adapt to changing customer requirements 
is mandatory. Almost every employee in every organization is faced with 
the challenge of changing how they do things today into how they want 
to do things tomorrow. For managers this can be a particularly daunting 
challenge. When discussing process improvement projects with manag­
ers, the LSS practitioner will often be faced with a barrage of “resistance to 
change challenges” across the organization. We hear statements such as:
• If only purchasing would do this or engineering would do that, our 
process could be improved.
• If this department would consider our needs, we would more effec­
tively be able to deliver our product.
• If John’s department could just deliver the materials that we need on 
time, our productivity would greatly improve.

144  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
These resistance-to-change scenarios are commonplace in many orga­
nizations today. This chapter is about gaining a better understanding 
of why there is so much resistance to change. How can successfully 
applying Kaizen to our change management activities be a fundamen­
tal approach to overcome this resistance? All LSS change management 
activities benefit from this approach, whether you are using a process 
change model of Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control 
(DMAIC) or a design changes model using Define, Measure, Analyze, 
Design, and Verify (DMADV). We discuss how individual and organi­
zational beliefs and behaviors are responsible for some of the resistance 
to change that we encounter.
If we are to become true LSS practitioners, we need to gain a basic under­
standing of the ninth waste, behavior waste, and how we apply Kaizen to 
eliminate this and other wastes and facilitate change in our organization. 
The ninth waste, behavior waste, teaches us that change and improvement 
begin with us as individuals (personal waste) and collectively (people 
waste) as members of an organization. In this chapter we discuss the orga­
nizational path of change from a non-LSS environment to an LSS environ­
ment. The primary conduit of change management is Kaizen. Eliminating 
non-Lean beliefs and behaviors across the organization requires the sus­
tained application of Kaizen.
Most organizations are familiar with Kaizen (“small continuous”) 
changes; however, Kaikaku (“a transformation of mind”), which demon­
strates large change or radical change, and Kakushin (“innovation”) are 
equally important in your Lean transformation.
Kaizen* is not a new concept. It was coined in 1986 by Masaaki Imai in 
Kaizen—The Key to Japan’s Competitive Success. This first book on Kaizen 
fully defines and describes the concept. One unique aspect of this book is 
that it gives us a look at how to apply Kaizen in a traditional organization. 
Coupled with his second book, Gemba Kaizen,† they represent powerful 
resources on change and process improvement available today. Concepts 
summarized and presented in this chapter are derived from these and 
other resources.
Kaizen is the lifeblood of a Lean organization and a Lean management 
system. It can be used individually, in teams, or for process troubleshoot­
ing. We show in this chapter that Kaizen is about taking positive action.

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin  •  145
Kaizen transitions into Kaikaku, a transformation of mind, and becomes 
the perfect conduit to deploy education, beliefs, and apply Lean tools 
across your organization.
The beauty and power of Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin is that they 
are easy concepts to learn, implement, and teach to others. Kaizen can 
become contagious (in a very positive sense) in your organization. You 
can always tell an organization that practices Kaizen within a few minutes 
of walking around the facility. The telltale signs are everywhere; there are 
visual controls and measurement systems. Kaikaku can be described as 
a series of Kaizen activities completed together, forming and exhibiting 
the presence of a Lean mindset. Kakushin or innovation is required for 
growth of all companies. Simply put, living the three faces of change—
Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin—will show you how Lean can transform 
your organization.
INTRODUCTION
Kaizen means continuous improvement or change + improve. Many of 
us as managers want improvement, but often fear change. We embrace 
change only if we can completely control it. In many instances, manage­
ment today wants to know the exact outcome of change before it allows 
any employee to take even the most fundamental steps to improve a bad 
situation. We have exposed individual and organizational beliefs as the 
root cause of this type of employee behavior, and now will present the 
change management required to eliminate it.
We present Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin here as the three funda­
mental tools to deploy change in your organization. What is the nature 
of change? How do we let go of old beliefs and behaviors? What are we 
changing into? How does Kaizen, Kaikaku, or Kakushin solve or address 
all these change questions?
It’s time for individuals, teams, management at all levels, and employ­
ees in all functional areas of the organization to embrace change and to 
become the change that we want to see in the organization. In the words of 
Mahatma Gandhi: “We must become the change we want to see.”
This means that we cannot look outward for change. We cannot stand 
and say that it’s the outside world that needs to change—some other 
employee, department, function, policy, or procedure that needs altering. 

146  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Every individual in every organization can change aspects of many activi­
ties that touch their daily work environment. So let’s start on our journey 
of Kaizen. We will never be the same, and neither will the organization.
Resistance to Change
Organizational change is often more difficult than it first appears. Why 
is individual change so difficult? What is it that makes organizational 
change so difficult? These are fundamental questions that must be at the 
forefront of any LSS transformation process.
There are three fundamental aspects that prevent, hinder, or inhibit employ­
ees from participating in change management. First, there is fear of the 
unknown. Second is the measurement system. Finally, there are individual 
beliefs and collective organizational beliefs that present resistance barriers.
Fear of the Unknown
When we say fear, we don’t necessarily mean fear of retribution from a 
manager or another employee in the organization. What employees typi­
cally fear is the unknown associated with any change to their environ­
ment. The change from where they are now and what they are familiar 
with to where the organization is going can cause trepidation on the part 
of many employees. Often changes are not clearly or completely defined. 
When there is uncertainty, people may be hesitant to walk into the 
unknown. Addressing this employee fear is a component of any successful 
LSS organization.
Measurement Systems
It has often been said that measures drive behavior and bad measures drive 
bad behavior, or non-Lean measures drive non-Lean behavior. In either 
event, the measurement system can be a significant source of resistance 
among employees, departments, or divisions of the organization. When 
embarking on any LSS project, understanding the nature of the measure­
ment system that’s in place is a critical factor to the success of the project. 
A review of measures may help in the formulation of your LSS project. 
Some types of measures that should be considered include:
• Individual employee performance measures
• Department measures

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin  •  147
• Division measures
• Bonus performance measures
• Process measures
• Productivity measures
• Customer-related performance measures
• Cost measures
• Corporate measures
• Stakeholder measures
• Regulatory agency measures
• Government regulation measures
• Risk management measures
• Liability measures
• Contract measures
Whether the ability to change these measures is real or just perceived, 
the above list can have a substantial influence on the resistance to change 
that you face on your LSS project. Clearly, many of those described can 
deter an employee on an LSS team from taking action.
Beliefs
Human beings have a fundamental desire to feel that the actions they are 
taking every day are correct. These actions are derived from each indi­
vidual’s beliefs. We normally don’t look at ourselves as individuals who are 
deliberately doing something that is wrong. We generally believe that our 
behaviors and actions are “the right thing to do.” Because of this, people 
tend to hold on to their beliefs and behaviors tightly, making it difficult to 
change a behavior pattern that is not producing effective performance of the 
organization.
OVERCOMING RESISTANCE TO CHANGE
Overcoming resistance to change is rarely easy and can range from a dif­
ficult task to a nearly impossible one. People tend to hold on to their beliefs 
fairly tightly. Many LSS efforts are stalled or fail outright because of the 
inability to overcome resistance to change.

148  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
There is a wide range of excellent literature on the subject of change 
management. Some focus on managerial psychology, while others use 
various tools and techniques, and still others present a combination of 
the two approaches. In this section we introduce the three basic phases 
that employees typically go through during the implementation of LSS 
concepts and tools for effective results.
Leaving Old Beliefs Behind
There are three distinct phases required to rewrite our beliefs in success­
fully transitioning to a new set of daily beliefs and behaviors. The first is 
to adopt the ability to “let go”* of our old beliefs to which we hold on to 
so tightly. The second is to open up our mind to the possibility of new 
ways of thinking and new ways of looking at the daily activities that we 
conduct. During this period of receptive activity to new ideas, it is incum­
bent that we try to implement these ideas in new ways in our organiza­
tion. Over time, these new ideas become new patterns of behavior that 
become dominant; this third phase is identified as the emergence of an 
LSS environment.
So how do we leave our old beliefs behind? What is the first step? One of 
the fundamental characteristics of operating in an LSS environment is the 
ability of its employees to challenge current beliefs and practices. These 
may be individual beliefs or organizational beliefs. Initially, this must 
start with the individual, who on a daily basis must become proficient at 
questioning whether or not the activities that he or she will be conducting 
today are creating value for the customer. When this practice becomes 
commonplace with individuals within our organization, we will be well 
on our way to developing the discipline to change old non-Lean beliefs.
Only when we have begun to adopt the concept of changing old beliefs 
can we even consider the possibilities of adopting a different way of doing 
things. Many companies today run into significant problems with adopt­
ing LSS concepts and tools simply because they are unwilling to change 
old beliefs. LSS is not a concept that can simply be slapped on top of an old 
belief system, deployed in a vacuum, and be successful. Trying to adopt 
LSS without letting go of old beliefs is a mistake made by many organiza­
tions today, and one of the leading reasons why many LSS initiatives do 
not produce the results anticipated and are unsustainable.

Considering New Possibilities
Considering new possibilities is a fundamental activity of Kaizen and the 
essence of this chapter. When we consider new possibilities, we open our­
selves up to trying new things and begin to examine the way we think, our 
point of view, and the methods we use in daily activities. Developing an 
organizational personality that considers new possibilities is the essence 
of LSS in that it allows a “learning environment” to emerge.
The identification and development of new possibilities is neither quick 
nor easy. It requires dedication at all levels of the organization and a com­
mitment to practice Kaizen on a daily basis. Employees must be allowed the 
elbow room to experiment with try-storms to gauge the relative success of 
possible new improvements. They must be allowed the opportunity to make 
mistakes, course correct, and define better paths to higher productivity.
Management’s insistence on a “results-only focus” can stifle the creativ­
ity of employees to try new process focus concepts. In this respect, Lean 
management becomes critical in the development of new processes. The 
rewriting of our beliefs requires an acknowledgment by management that 
our current belief system is ineffective and necessitates a deliberate man­
agement approach that supports the elimination of old beliefs followed by 
the consideration of new LSS beliefs.
Emergence of LSS
The continued practice of these two fundamental phases—leaving old 
beliefs behind and considering new possibilities—results in the emergence 
of an environment where individuals, groups, and your organization as a 
whole are on a journey to an LSS environment.
When considering change, start small and follow these simple steps. First, 
identify a waste in your organization and the old belief that contributed to the 
production of that waste. Second, put the old belief aside and consider new 
possibilities. Follow the three faces of change to become an LSS organization.
THREE FACES OF CHANGE
There are three faces of change that all improvement activities can be clas­
sified as: Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin. The fundamentals of each are 
presented in this section. True LSS organizations have employees well 

150  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
versed in all three, and activities of all three types of change management 
are visible across the organization.
Kaizen—Continuous Improvement
What is Kaizen? Kaizen has been defined many ways. Several definitions 
follow to give you a range of interpretations of the term Kaizen.
	
1.	Kaizen: Change + improve.
	
2.	Kai: To take apart and make new. Zen: To think or become 
enlightened.
	
3.	Kaizen: Continuous improvement using small incremental changes.
	
4.	Kaizen: When applied to the workplace means continuous improve­
ment involving everyone, managers and workers alike.
It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, 
but the one most responsive to change.
—Charles Darwin, English naturalist (1809–1882)
In Lean organizations, management has two roles—maintenance and 
improvement.* Maintenance means to standardize and sustain a process, 
while improvement means to move the process forward to higher levels 
of performance. Virtually all process improvement programs start with 
Standardize-Do-Check-Act (SDCA) and move to Plan-Do-Check-Act 
(PDCA). Figure 5.1 shows this progression.
Kaizen process means to establish and live the PDCA cycle (see 
Figure 5.2):
• Plan: Establish a target for improvement.
• Do: Implement the plan.
• Check: Determine whether implementation has brought planned 
improvement.
• Act: Perform and standardize the new procedures to prevent recur­
rence of the original problem.

Where to start Kaizen? If you are not sure where to start Kaizen in your 
organization, use the four K’s of Kaizen; observe your organization, and 
start with one of the following:
• Kusai: Things that smell bad.
• Kitsui: Things that are hard to do or are in dark areas.
• Kitanai: Things that are dirty.
• Kiken: Things that are dangerous.
How do you use Kaizen? There are three basic approaches to using 
Kaizen effectively: Kaizen and you method, Kaizen for process trouble­
shooting, and Kaizen teams. Each is briefly described below.

Kaizen and You Method
Kaizen is change + improve. That means making simple small incremen­
tal improvements that any employee can complete. That’s all there is to 
it. With the Kaizen and you method each employee can begin today to 
“change your point of view,” “change the way you work,” and “change the 
way you think.” How can you start Kaizen today in your work area?
• Stop doing unnecessary things.
• Reduce: If you can’t stop, reduce them somehow.
• Change: Try another way.
There are three laws that make the simple concept of Kaizen work, but 
you absolutely have to do all three or you will never be good at Kaizen.
	
1.	Surface: Write the idea down.
	
2.	Implement: You make the change.
	
3.	Share: Post it, review it, and talk about it.
With Kaizen you can change yourself and you can change your work­
place. Kaizen should be done to benefit you. The person who gains the 
most from the Kaizen is the person who does the Kaizen. Start doing 
Kaizen today!
Kaizen for Process Troubleshooting
Everyone in your organization should completely understand and be 
able to successfully complete Kaizen using the following five-step pro­
cess.* Employees who cannot complete this process cannot improve 
their individual areas, and consequently, you cannot improve the 
organization.
• Step 1: When a problem (abnormality) arises, first, go to Gemba.
• Step 2 : Check the Gembutsu (relevant objects surrounding the problem).
• Step 3: Take temporary countermeasures “on the spot.”
• Step 4: Find the root cause(s).
• Step 5: Standardize to prevent recurrence.
*	 Ibid.

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin  •  153
Step 1: Go to Gemba
Gemba is the most important place in your company. It is where all of the 
value is created for your customers. This concept was so important that 
Soichiro Honda, founder of Honda Motor Company, did not have a presi­
dent’s office. He was always found somewhere in Gemba. Gemba means 
the “real place,” or where the “action” is. When a problem arises, go to 
Gemba first and look to solve specific problems.
Step 2: Conduct Gembutsu
Gembutsu means to assess all the relevant information in Gemba that 
surrounds the problem. Interview several employees; ask questions of 
what was happening when the problem occurred. Seek information in a 
nonthreatening way; the employees in the area want the problem to be 
resolved as much as you do. Don’t place blame, insinuate wrongdoing, 
or belittle an employee’s work performance. This is a search for the facts 
of what happened. Remember to gather information regarding all 5M’s: 
materials, machinery, manpower, measurements, and methods.
Step 3: Take Temporary Countermeasures “on the Spot”
There is nothing more reassuring to an employee than knowing that man­
agement will support employees when problems arise. This is best dem­
onstrated by a manager that takes sound action immediately. Your ability 
to remain calm in a critical situation and gather relevant information, 
understand the situation, and take action on the spot is one sign of good 
leadership and will be respected by all employees. Most importantly, it 
should be recognized by all, especially management, that these are tem­
porary measures. The most common mistake is that organizations stop 
here at step 3; they never find the root causes, and consequently the orga­
nization lives with many “band aid” solutions that never get resolved and 
result in constant nagging poor-quality and poor-performance issues.
Step 4: Find Root Causes
Once temporary measures are in place, root cause analysis must be con­
ducted. It is imperative that the root causes are found and eliminated. These 
can be conducted using techniques such as the five whys, cause-and-effect 

154  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
analysis, or failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). This is a critical 
step, for if the root cause(s) is not found, the organization is doomed to 
repeatedly revisit the problem.
Step 5: Standardize to Prevent Recurrence
Standardize means to put in a control system to prevent the problem 
from appearing again. Depending on the nature of the problem, this 
often requires management tools such as a revised maintenance schedule, 
revised standard operation procedures or visual work instructions, or pro­
cess control charts. These preventative measures must be reviewed regu­
larly to assure that the problem has been eliminated. During standardize 
you must:
• Eliminate root causes
• Implement a permanent solution
• Confirm the effectiveness of the permanent solution
• Standardize the use of the new procedure
Kaizen Teams
Kaizen events that are conducted with cross-functional teams are power­
ful tools for process improvement. They allow the creativity of staff from 
across the organization to take a fresh objective look at where the organi­
zation stands. These teams often readily identify dozens of roadblocks and 
opportunities for improvement (OFIs). Teams working together inevitably 
generate ideas that do not arise in the normal daily operation.
The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.
—Linus Pauling
A startling statistic that brings home the difference between Lean orga­
nizations and traditional organizations is the concept of idea generation. 
Typical American companies generate only 0.5 ideas per worker per year.* 
Typical Japanese companies generate nine ideas per employee per year.† 
Toyota generates 70 improvement ideas per worker per year!‡

Possible Target Areas for Kaizen Teams
• Customer service—can be improved
• Quality—can be improved
• Costs—can be lowered
• Schedule—improve delivery and production time
• Cycle time, setup time—can be reduced
• Inventory—reduce the unnecessary stock
• Safety—reduce possible accidents
• People—improve workers’ skills and knowledge
• Equipment—improve downtime and efficiency
• Environment—improve air quality, reduce odors
• Visual—use colors, clean up, find things easier
• Location—reduce unnecessary motion or facilitate necessary inter­
action, etc.
Preparing for Kaizen
Preparing for a Kaizen event is almost more important than the event 
itself. Many events have failed to achieve results anticipated due to poor 
preparation. This can lead both management and staff to lose faith in an 
incredibly valuable tool. The basics of preparing for Kaizen include:
• Management selects target area: This should not be too broad or too 
narrowly focused. The examples above give some great topics for Kaizen.
• Set time: Two to five-day Kaizen events are typical. These can be fol­
lowed by 6 to 8 weeks of continuous improvement team meetings to 
complete solutions implementations before disbanding the team and 
re-forming to attack another topic.
• Set scope or project boundaries: The team needs to know what’s 
included and what’s off limits. This helps to keep focus and achieve 
better results.
• Select Kaizen team members (4 to 6 cross-functional): These should 
include 1 to 2 employees from the target area, suppliers and custom­
ers of the target area. For example, a Kaizen in manufacturing may 
want to include someone from order processing (supplier) and distri­
bution (customer). Teams should also include at least two outsiders 
from different departments or functional areas.
• Objective “eyes” assigned to project: This is typically an exter­
nal consultant, but can be an internal source if there is a highly 

156  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
trained LSS practitioner on staff. One of the many advantages of 
using an external source is the wealth of project implementations 
he or she typically brings to your organization. Another is mentor­
ing of team members during the event. Perhaps the most important 
role of an external consultant is the ability of the external person 
to expose sensitive weaknesses that employees may be reluctant to 
point out.
Team Member Roles in Kaizen
Each team member’s role is to work synergistically with other team 
members to improve the target area. When conducted correctly, Kaizen 
becomes contagious. It is the constant doing and sharing of Kaizen results 
that stimulates others to do Kaizen! Team members should remember to:
• Participate
• Study the process in the target area
• Use creativity before capital
• Use Kaizen
• Share ideas
• Ask questions
• Experiment with changes
Overcoming Obstacles during Kaizen
The “we can’t” syndrome is the common outcry of employees in tradi­
tional organizations. The list of reasons the authors have personally been 
given why Kaizen won’t work in a particular organization is staggering. 
Once you begin your journey to becoming an LSS practitioner, you imme­
diately realize how ridiculous all the following assertions are:
• We produce such a variety of products.
• Our products are custom; we can’t standardize.
• The change is too rapid.
• We are not in a mass production situation.
• Our people are too busy.
Some reasons for not conducting process improvement reach a level 
of absurdity that is difficult to comprehend. Let us share a true story 

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin  •  157
with you that one of the authors experienced. Several years ago we were 
conducting a process improvement program in a traditional organiza­
tion with a management philosophy similar to the Theory X philoso­
phy. The management team was tremendously cost driven in every 
aspect of their organization. One of our opportunities for improvement 
surfaced the need for additional employee training and cross-training. 
It was readily apparent to the entire team that employees at this orga­
nization were in dire need of training and cross-training. However, the 
very thought of spending money, time, energy, and effort on training 
and cross-training was out of the question for senior management. 
Management’s response to the team was: “If we train them, they will 
leave the company.”
From our perspective this was understandable since it was blatantly 
obvious that senior managers were living one of the traditional belief phi­
losophies of “low pay, high turnover.” So as to not be too confrontational, 
we posed a question to management. “Is there anything that you can think 
of that would be worse than trained employees leaving your company?” 
There was a puzzled look on some faces as they were struggling to compre­
hend the question; clearly, it hadn’t dawned on them that anything could 
be worse. After a few moments of silence, my response was, “The only 
thing worse than trained employees leaving the company is untrained 
employees that stay with the company.”
Needless to say, process improvement programs didn’t get very far in 
that organization. Senior management held closely to their belief and 
completed nothing but the bare essentials of employee training. Even in 
the face of poor product quality and poor customer satisfaction they were 
unwilling to change their beliefs and prepare their staff to deliver what the 
customer wanted. This is a message to all managers in all organizations 
that “beliefs drive behavior.” Work daily on developing your LSS belief 
system.
So, whenever you are faced with the employee response “we can’t” 
change for any reason, use the following response: “I know we can’t do 
this because …, but if we could, how would we …?”
People sometimes fear change. I have been asked on several occasions, 
What if the Kaizen doesn’t work? The answer is simple: Do Kaizen again! 
Yeah, but what if it still doesn’t work? If it still doesn’t work, do Kaizen 
again! What if a problem develops from a Kaizen? Do another Kaizen 
until the problem goes away! You need to conduct Kaizen until you reach a 
point where you have faith and have lost your fear of taking improvement 

158  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
actions. That is when you know that you are a change agent, a true LSS 
practitioner. (See Figure 5.3.)
KAIKAKU—TRANSFORMATION OF MIND
Similar to Kaizen, Kaikaku has been defined in many ways. Several defini­
tions follow to give you a range of interpretations of the term Kaikaku.*
	
1.	Kaikaku: Change + radical.
	
2.	Kai: To take apart and make new. Kaku: Radically alter.
	
3.	Kaikaku: Transformation of mind.
	
4.	Kaikaku: Can also mean innovation, although the authors will dis­
cuss innovation later in this chapter as Kakushin.
How Do We Recognize Kaikaku (Transformation of Mind)?
Kaikaku is the result of successive Lean learning and Lean doing until 
Lean becomes a part of you. Looking back, I am not even sure when it first

10 Attributes of Kaizen
	
1.	 Kaizen involves everyone in the organization—owners, presidents, senior managers, 
department managers, team leaders, and supervisors!
	
2.	 Kaizen fosters process-oriented thinking (i.e., processes must be improved for 
results to improve).
	
3.	 Kaizen focuses human efforts on what we can do, not on what we can’t do.
	
4.	 Kaizen defines a new role for management.
	
5.	 Kaizen is process-oriented rather than results-oriented.
	
6.	 Kaizen follows Standardize-Do-Check-Act (SDCA) for process maintenance 
activities and the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle for improvement activities.
	
7.	 Kaizen puts quality first all the time.
	
8.	 Kaizen puts the customer first all the time, even before the boss.
	
9.	 Kaizen defines the “next process,” either internal or external process, as the 
customer.
	
10.	 Kaizen is not a home run. It’s a single!

occurred in me. One day I was training in an organization when it became 
clear to me that my mind was completely rewired with Lean beliefs and 
behaviors. Since that day I have been on a mission to help employees at all 
levels transition from a traditional belief system to a Lean belief system.
In Kaizen we talked about small incremental changes. Many of the tools 
presented in this handbook are used in Kaizen. Some, however, are tai­
lored to Kaikaku in that they require a more complex set of activities, a 
more comprehensive set of Lean beliefs and behaviors, or simply put, a 
“transformation of mind” has taken place in order to properly deploy the 
Lean tool. This entire handbook is about trying to bring about this trans­
formation of mind in all your employees.
The misconception of management in most Western companies is that 
Lean is just a set of tools. Management and employees learn a few Lean 
tools, conduct some Kaizen, and believe that their organization is Lean. 
Until the transformation of mind has occurred in employees at all levels, 
your organization cannot reap the true benefits of Lean.
It is only when an employee reaches a significant point in the Lean jour­
ney that he/she begins to recognize Kaikaku in himself or herself. Their 
own personal transformation of mind from traditional beliefs to Lean 
beliefs is occurring on a daily basis. Those in your organization still prac­
ticing traditional beliefs will neither recognize your efforts nor consider 
them to have any value. Do not let this deter you. You must continue on 
your journey and help them to see and live Lean beliefs and behaviors. 
Two examples of Lean tools that can reflect the presence of Kaikaku are 
cell design and facility layout.
Kaikaku in Cell Design
Let’s consider the five steps of cell design and some of the changes that 
have to occur in order to successfully implement a cell. Many changes 
to traditional beliefs about materials, people deployment, equipment, and 
methods of production need to be considered and include:
• Grouping similar products
• Looking at customer demand and understanding how it changes
• Calculating customer demand
• Redeploying people in nontraditional roles (to meet customer 
demand, not fill a functional job description)
• Changing the number of people as needed

160  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Placing equipment to allow continuous materials flow during the 
value-add process
• Connecting the signals that initiate flow of materials to customer 
demand
• Using POUS for materials and equipment whenever possible
• Using quality at the source
• Creating visual work instructions
Individually each of these attribute changes may not appear too sig­
nificant; however, collectively they represent a radical change or trans­
formation of mind. The Kaikaku case summary of a composite U-cell in 
Figure 5.4 (discussed in detail in Chapter 4) demonstrates how this trans­
formation of mind occurs collectively for a large number of employees 
working together in a cell.
Kaikaku in Facility Layouts
Over the years we’ve heard many managers touting that they were imple­
menting a Lean layout. However, if we take a closer look at these facilities, 
we find that few Lean tools had been successfully incorporated into the 
process. A true Lean facility layout requires that Kaikaku is present. Even 
more so than a single cell, an entire Lean facility layout is comprised of 
hundreds of considerations. The most important aspect is to begin with 
customer demand and configure your facility to respond to what your cus­
tomer wants. Some of the major considerations are:
• Assessing build to order and build to stock products
• Creating a mixed-model pull system
• Order processing
• Purchasing practices
• Inventory control
• All production activities
• Equipment layout
• Materials placement and POUS
• Employee deployment
• Distribution
One approach when considering a new facility layout is to complete a 
walk-through Lean layout. Figure 5.5 shows the results of a Lean facility 

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin  •  161
layout project. Using only blue painter’s tape and wood pallets, the team 
created a functional facility layout. The objective of the project was to 
produce a Lean layout design that allowed senior management to “walk 
through” the facility prior to any equipment or material delivery and 
physically see how the facility would operate in the new Lean mixed-
model pull system. Locations for everything were identified on the facility 
floor. This included raw materials POUS, all equipment, materials motion 
through the facility, employee deployment, production personnel offices, 
Kaikaku Case Study Summary: Composite U-Cell
Blood Dialysis Instrumentation Assembly
Situation: The company was producing approximately 45 blood dialysis units/week, 
operating two shifts in an enclosed electrostatic discharge (ESD) room. There was no 
room for expansion, and the company was restricted to assembly in the current 
assembly area. The company also had orders for 60 units/week. The challenge was to 
implement process improvements and achieve 60 units/week with the existing staff, 
assembly area, and test equipment. Previous attempts to increase production levels had 
resulted in significant quality problems and an actual reduction in output.
Kaizen Events—Continuous Improvement Teams: Our first actions were to assemble a 
cross-functional team and conduct Kaizen events in the dialysis instrument assembly 
room. The team worked together and separately to attack both the hydraulics and chassis 
assembly areas. During the Kaizen events, each team uncovered approximately 30 
different opportunities for improvement.
Cell Design Activities
The Kaizen teams completed the five-step cell design process in both the hydraulics and 
chassis areas and linked them to produce a composite U-cell. This included Takt time, 
line balancing, and facility layout for 38 workstations, over 50 assembly and test 
employees (green dots), and the assembly of over 4,000 parts.
Economic impacts: Over a 60-day period these Kaizen activities produced a Kaikaku 
(transformation of mind) with the newly implemented cell. The resulting economic 
impacts were realized from the team effort.
Initial production rate was 45 units/week, and the final production was 60 units/week. 
This is a 33% increase in production using the same floor space, employees, and 
equipment. This translated to a significant revenue increase and a dramatic increase in 
profitability, since all fixed costs remained the same.

finished goods inventory, and ground, less than truckload and truckload 
distribution. From this simple layout we could show management how 
materials would be received, where POUS storage would be, how orders 
would be processed on the floor, how employees would be deployed, elec­
trical and other utilities considerations, and how order fulfillment would 
occur for distribution.
Both of the above examples require a transformation of Mind to com­
plete effectively. How we think about materials handling, employee 
deployment, equipment utilization, and adding value for the customer all 
must be radically changed from those of a traditional organization. They 
require the adoption of so many small changes that at this point the orga­
nization has undergone a radical change in beliefs and about how value 
is created for the customer. At this point the mental transformation has 
occurred and you are operating as a Lean organization.
KAKUSHIN (INNOVATION)
Virtually all process improvement requires some form of change that 
could be described as innovation, or at a minimum, creativity. In this sec­
tion we look at innovation as a process in and of itself. As such, it can be 
defined, described, and managed like any other process. In the remainder 
of this section we present the 20-20 innovation process.
The 20-20 Innovation Process
Organizations are focusing on innovation as the necessary skill for rev­
enue growth in that most corporations have pretty much exhausted the 
opportunities for restructuring and re-engineering. The new strategic 
mantra is revenue growth resulting from four primary strategies: (1) geo­
graphic expansion; (2) alliances, acquisitions, and mergers; (3) greater 
market penetration; and (4) product development and enhancement. And 
product development and enhancement ultimately depend upon product 
development as their foundation. Market penetration literally depends 
upon marketing innovation for its success, with product development 
and enhancement, along with cost advantages, contributing greatly. To 

164  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
obtain cost advantages, an organization also depends upon innovation, 
as process design and continuous improvement are process innovation 
activities. Finally, the related process of management innovation is an 
untapped resource that can help organizations improve the value that they 
add to the value chain of key organizational processes. (See Figure 5.6.)
To compete, organizations either attempt to differentiate themselves 
from their competition or attempt to achieve some relative low-cost posi­
tion, and in both cases, innovation is the key. The journey from novice to 
expert in any field begins by understanding these essentials, practicing 
them, mastering them at one level, and then moving on toward the limits 
of your potential. At some point in the process, the best innovators rise 
above their profession in a multidisciplinary manner.
Each of the six essentials of the 20-20 innovation process represents 
a bundle of habits, skills, and knowledge that come together in innova­
tion-driven problem-solving personalities, and each personality draws its 
strengths from a variety of specialties. A select number have been identi­
fied and mapped against the six essentials as a basic guide to the interdis­
ciplinary skill set, as shown in Table 5.1.
These six personalities serve as an effective way to assess yourself and 
your organization, so that you can determine what your strengths and 
weaknesses are and how to assemble a complete innovation and prob­
lem-solving capability. This approach should be considered a guide, not a

magic formula, in that each individual and organization has a unique mix­
ture of these skill sets that we use to feed into our “Knowledge Wizard.” 
Some are intensively focused on one or two of these skill sets, and others 
have a broader blend—the greater the blend, the higher the probability of 
success. In other words, the better you get to know them, the better inno­
vator and problem solver you will become. Great innovators know their 
strengths and weaknesses; they build teams to compensate for the weak­
nesses and create wholes that are synergistic in that they are greater than 
the sum of their individual parts.
At its basic fundamental level, all competition in some way relies upon 
innovation and creativity. There are six essential innovation and prob­
lem-solving skills that apply to any type of innovation or opportunity. 
The difference between the best and the worst innovators and problem 
solvers lies in how many of these skills they can marshal by themselves 
and with others, and how deeply the skills are understood, both indi­
vidually and collectively. Poor innovators understand them incompletely, 
and therefore cannot develop an effective and complete capability. Great 
innovators and problem solvers know them well enough to pull together 
and manage all six, or exhibit one in great depth, as part of a team. The 
following outlines in more detail the six essentials of the innovation 
process:
• Essential 1: Generate the innovation mindset. Identify opportuni­
ties and potent ideas and attitudes for success and create a strategy 
for various alternative points of view, while defining the program 
expectations and metrics. This will improve your organization’s 
effectiveness in moving creatively through the process and related 
problem-solving effort.
	
	
The innovator’s mindset and central idea is that the best innova­
tion comes from taking alternative points of view. They have a unique 
and flexible way of seeing things, and thus the ability to both develop 
original viewpoints and incorporate those of others around them, 
which are the roots of both creativity and objectivity. The innova­
tor’s journey is the sum of many different points of view. Tapping 
into these alternate perspectives of both ourselves and others, then 
testing them and choosing the most valuable, requires sustaining 
a flexible viewpoint through further inquiry. Our innovation quo­
tient questionnaire helps to integrate these perspectives in new ways, 
which constitute the powerful mindset of the Innovator.

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin  •  167
	
	
The components of this first phase of developing the mindset are: 
(1) developing potent ideas and attitudes using a project scope sheet, 
(2) turning problems into opportunities using the IQ assessment, (3) 
committing to the challenge, (4) creating strength out of weakness 
and vulnerability, (5) not settling for half-measures, and (6) tran­
scending the limits.
• Essential 2: Know the territory. This stage concentrates on moving 
from innovation to insight by asking the right questions and obtain­
ing sound and timely information and data. It also involves the 
collection and analysis of the system’s past (using the Knowledge 
Wizard).* Better knowledge helps organizations define the oppor­
tunities and problems more effectively, choose the better pathways, 
and clearly identify what’s at stake. The discoverer’s skill set helps to 
answer the following:
• At this stage, we simply don’t know enough to define the oppor­
tunity or problem well, so why don’t we step back and answer 
some key unknowns before we proceed any further?
• Although we may have a seemingly well-structured proposal, 
what have we really learned from our past mistakes in that area?
• How can we avoid an unworkable journey or one that creates 
unnecessary risk?
	
	
The discovery process and knowledge of the territory brings 
insight and understanding, which often reveal the most likely prob­
lems and opportunities in the context of higher relief. By perform­
ing more investigation, the implications become more apparent as 
a foundation for action. Without this essential, the innovator may 
choose an unworkable journey or one that creates unnecessary risks. 
We need to remember that knowledge is the key asset of our day 
and age. Knowing the territory, the work of the discoverer using the 
Knowledge Wizard (KW) deals with acquiring the right information 
about the critical elements of the environment that we are solving 
problems in.
• Essential 3: Build the relationships. This stage involves the basics of 
how to move from isight to relationship building by cultivating qual­
ity communications and interaction, so that we can create an ever-
expanding circle based upon service, identity, and loyalty. It gives 
your organization the support and human context that is needed

168  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
to effectively create and foster innovation and implement change. 
Good communicators probe the functions and contradictions to ask 
whether ideas and opportunities are really worth it:
• What will our customers and stakeholders think about this? Will 
our efforts add value and build loyalty?
• Are these opportunities going to threaten some of our best busi­
ness relationships in the process, and are they really worth it?
• How will the people be affected by the opportunities?
	
	
Through the mastery of relationship building, good communi­
cators connect potential journeys to their actual implications and 
contradictions for real people, in order to help determine whether 
the innovation or problem solving is worthwhile, for whom, and 
why. Then they generate a core group that will tackle the journey, 
along with a virtual network that will support the effort. The support 
network is key, as this is not a one-person brainstorm. Without this 
essential, there may be no compelling reason to innovate and solve 
the problem at all. Or worse yet, there may be a reason, but no one 
convinced enough to take part.
	
	
The components of this third phase of building the relationships are: 
(1) cultivate quality communication and interaction, (2) create meaning­
ful communication, (3) move from communication to give-and-take rela­
tionships, (4) advance from relationships to a core team, (5) the core team 
leads to a network, and (6) the network advances to a living community.
• Essential 4: Manage the journeys. This stage focuses on moving from 
building the community to giving that core community a sense of 
direction and clear priorities by choosing destinations and strategies. 
The focus is on alignment and commitment to projects and charter­
ing, along with defining how to pursue the selected directions and 
revealing evolutionary resources, i.e., the technologies, materials, 
products, processes, skills, knowledge, etc., that could be utilized in 
the development using the innovation knowledge base (which could 
include patterns describing the evolution of technological and social 
systems). Fostering the understanding of the stages of the innovation 
journey helps the organization set goals, define success, and develop 
effective plans. Playmakers are those who ask about alternatives and 
eliminations with the following questions:
• While the ideas may be interesting, are we reaching high 
enough here?
• What is our real aim and purpose?

Three Faces of Change—Kaizen, Kaikaku, and Kakushin  •  169
• The technology or tools may be great, but are we solving the right 
problem?
	
	
The components of this fourth phase of managing the journeys 
are: (1) choose destinations and set directions, (2) solve the right 
problems at the right time by moving from disorientation to selec­
tion, (3) choose where you want to go, what to eliminate, and the 
paths to get there, (4) define success, (5) plan for the unexpected 
(chance) with alternative operators, and (6) lead the way.
• Essential 5: Create the solutions. This stage involves moving from 
leadership to power by designing, building, and maintaining opti­
mal solutions. It helps organizations to bring the best people and 
technology together, along with the necessary tools and software, in 
order to generate complete and flexible solutions for the innovations 
and problems that you are trying to solve. A good creator uses mod­
eling to ask the following:
• Even if we have come up with a great idea, do we have the right 
people and the capability skill sets behind it?
• Do we really understand the purpose of our designs?
• Even if it is the right innovation area or problem to work on, are 
we willing to invest in the needed technology that it may take to 
deliver it?
• Do we really understand if the economics are viable and doable?
	
	
A key to this stage is revealing and solving problems using model­
ing, resolving contradictions, overcoming limitations, etc., that can 
hinder the achievement of set goals using various instruments for 
problem solving, including the most recent ideation DMADV meth­
odology. It could also involve some objectives: deployment, cus­
tomer needs, customer experience, measurements, and management 
reviews. The components of this fifth phase of creating the solutions 
are: (1) design, build, and maintain optimal solutions using DMADV, 
(2) find the right people for the right work, (3) get the right tools to 
do the job in order to move from team to capability, (4) learn how to 
conserve scarce resources, (5) get the right information to the right 
people, (6) design solutions that evolve, and (7) shift the balance of 
power to create the dominant solution.
• Essential 6: Deliver the results. This stage concentrates on moving 
from power to sustainable advantage through the stages of intui­
tive and disciplined implementation, which allows the organization 
to continually exceed expectations, and conquer complexity, scale, 

170  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
and friction. The key is performance, which is accomplished with 
simplicity, discipline, and a competitive advantage. This stage is all 
about performance, which uses the Knowledge Wizard as the follow­
ing questions illustrate:
• We may have a brilliant strategy, but can be execute and imple­
ment it?
• Are the timeframes and resources unrealistic?
• What are the biggest risks, and how can we manage them up 
front?
	
	
The components of this sixth phase of delivering the results are: 
(1) practice intuitive, disciplined execution using the Knowledge 
Wizard, (2) simplify and specify, (3) set the pace and pilot the course, 
(4) make the right decisions at the right time, (5) optimize risk and 
return, (6) learn to fail small and early on to win big later on, and (7) 
maintain your leading cutting edge.
SUMMARY
One of the few things that we know for certain is that change is constant in 
organizations. This change can come in many forms and can include posi­
tive or negative attributes for individuals, departments, and the company 
at large. This chapter was structured to give you approaches that drive 
structured positive change and provides a fundamental foundation for 
successful LSS process improvement projects.
First, we discussed the three primary obstacles or resistance to change 
factors that can inhibit effective LSS process improvements. The most 
common resistance to change factors are fear of the unknown, beliefs, and 
measurements systems. The LSS practitioner should be prepared to rec­
ognize and understand these obstacles and use LSS concepts and tools to 
overcome them.
The essence of this chapter is the concepts of Kaizen, Kaikaku, and 
Kakushin, which are the three fundamental tools or conduits to deploy 
change in your organization. With the application of Kaizen in each of 
its common forms—Kaizen and you, Kaizen for process troubleshooting, 
and Kaizen teams—the LSS practitioner can become a driver of positive 
change with virtually all employee engagements. This can be assisting

employees with small process improvement projects that each individual 
can complete on his/her own. The most widely known and used form is 
the Kaizen event or Kaizen continuous improvement team. Kaizen teams 
typically attack projects that are larger in scope than any one person can 
handle. These projects can be 2 to 4 days in length or can include team 
activities that can last several weeks.
The second fundamental concept and milestone is the transformation of 
mind concept, which reflects the LSS practitioners’ advanced knowledge 
as exhibited by the use of multiple LSS tools in unison. The ability to think 
and act across the entire value stream has become a part of your organiza­
tion’s daily activities.
The third fundamental concept in this chapter is the systematic and 
standardized approach to change by innovation. The 20-20 innovation 
process demonstrates the six essentials of innovation that can be applied 
to LSS organizational improvements.
When employees begin to deploy the change management concepts pre­
sented in this chapter, a powerful positive set of changes emerge and the 
organization will begin systematically eliminating waste, improving pro­
cesses, and expanding LSS knowledge for employees. These are the build­
ing blocks to improved product quality, increased employee productivity, 
and enhanced company profitability.


Section 3
SSBB Overview
So far in this book we have concentrated on the Lean side of the LSSBB 
methodology. This section provides a short overview of the SSBB side of 
the LSSBB methodology. The term Six Sigma was originated by Bill Smith 
of Motorola when he convinced William J. Weisz, then COO of Motorola, 
that the standard of performance for all business activities should be 3.4 
defects per million opportunities. This was statistically equivalent to plus-
or-minus six sigma when long-term drift was considered. Previously, most 
process control standards were set at plus or minus three sigma, which is 
equivalent to 66.8 defects per million opportunities. To meet this new, 
more rigid requirement, Motorola implemented an extensive program, 
training people on how to solve problems. This program was called Six 
Sigma; it was the start of a worldwide movement to produce products and 
services that were near perfection.
The Six Sigma methodology is based upon two concepts:
• Concept 1: The more variation is reduced around the midpoint of a 
specification, the less chance there is to create defects or errors. (See 
Figure S3.1.)

174  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
	
	
This is a concept that was well accepted in the 1940s and popular­
ized in the 1970s by Taguchi. As early as the 1920s, Shewhart set the 
standard of performance in his control charts threat plus or minus 
three sigma. Motorola felt that Phil Crosby’s zero defects perfor­
mance criterion was unattainable (and they were right), so they set a 
specification to a target variation of performance at six sigma. This 
is known as a process capability of 2.0 (Cp). Motorola felt that over 
time the process would drift plus-or-minus 1.5 sigma, so the actual 
long-term process capability target was set for 1.5 (Cpk), or spec to 
an actual variation target of 4.5 sigma. (See Figure S3.2.)
	
	
The change in target variation from three sigma to six sigma is 
where Six Sigma got its name. At the six sigma level, the long-term

process capability results in 3.4 errors per million opportunities. 
(Note: This is not 3.4 errors per million items/transactions.) This is 
near to perfection without requiring perfection. It is a goal to seek, 
not a performance standard that has to be met.
	
	
Another important point is that it is related to opportunities, not 
to the total output. For example, a car could have a million opportu­
nities for failure due to its complexity. In this case, at the six sigma 
level there would be an average of 3.4 defects per car produced. This 
is the reason that every car that rolls off the Toyota assembly line still 
has its breaks checked, to be sure they work.
• Concept 2: The lower the costs, cycle time, and error level, the higher 
the profits, market share, and customer satisfaction. This approach 
focuses on streamlining the process, driving out waste and no-value-
added activities. It was based upon the business process improvement 
concepts that were made popular in the early 1980s. (See Figure S3.3.)
	
	
In this concept, reducing the mean, not reducing variation, is the 
objective. For example, it is much better to be able to manufacture a 
part for $100 ± $10 than to manufacture the same part for $500 ± $1. 
In fact, in some cases variation is welcomed as long as it is on the 
lower side of the midpoint. Often, investigating these lower levels of 
variation can lead to additional reductions in cost, cycle time, and 
error rate.
Another part of the Six Sigma concept is called Lean. This method­
ology was developed by Henry Ford Sr. in the 1910s where in-process 
stock was almost eliminated, continuous flow lines were designed, and

manufacturing equipment was error proofed. These Lean concepts were 
further refined by Toyota to develop the most effective auto assembly pro­
cess in the world. (The Lean concepts were discussed in detail in Section 2 
of this book.) Using these two primary concepts as an objective, Motorola 
needed to define ways to implement them. It turned to Shewhart’s Plan-
Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, which was developed in the 1930s and was 
extensively used in the Total Quality Management (TQM) methodology 
that was popular in the 1980s and 1990s. In this case, Dr. Mikel Harry 
from Motorola modified it to RDMAICSI (Recognize-Define-Measure-
Analyze-Improve-Control-Standardize-Integrate). Later it was further 
defined to Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC). 
Bill Smith, who became the leader of Motorola’s Six Sigma efforts, felt that 
the complexity of the problems Motorola was facing required much more 
sophisticated techniques to solve them. Unfortunately, many of the pro­
fessional quality engineers were gone from Motorola, and along with them 
were the needed statistical analysis tools that were part of the quality engi­
neering profession. As a result, Motorola’s Six Sigma program was heavily 
focused on statistical training and analysis. This resulted in a cadre of spe­
cial problem-solving people who became proficient in statistical tools like 
design of experiments. They were called Six Sigma Black Belts (SSBBs).
The Six Sigma methodology has created a special term for people within 
the organization who have been trained in how to help the organization 
solve its most difficult problems or take advantage of new improvement 
opportunities. The key levels are:
• Six Sigma Yellow Belt (SSYB)—Level 1
• Six Sigma Green Belt (SSGB)—Level 2
• Six Sigma Black Belt (SSBB)—Level 3
• Six Sigma Master Black Belt (SSMBB)—Level 4
Six Sigma Black Belts are the work horses of the Six Sigma System.
—H. James Harrington
Six Sigma Black Belts (SSBBs) are highly skilled individuals who are 
effective problem solvers and who have a good understanding of the most 
frequently used statistical tools required to support the Six Sigma system. 
Their responsibilities are to lead Six Sigma problem-solving teams and to 
define and develop the right people to coordinate and lead the simple Six 

SSBB Overview  •  177
Sigma projects (Green Belts). Candidates for SSBBs should be experienced 
professionals who are already highly respected throughout the organiza­
tion. They should have experience as a change agent and be very creative. 
SSBBs should generate a minimum of US$1 million in savings per year as 
a result of their direct activities. SSBBs are not coaches; they are specialists 
who solve problems and support the SSGBs and SSYBs. They are used as 
Six Sigma problem-solving team managers/leaders of complex and impor­
tant projects. The position of SSBB is a full-time job; they are assigned to 
train, lead, and support the Six Sigma problem-solving teams. They serve 
as internal consultants and instructors. They normally will work with two 
to four problem-solving teams at a time. The average SSBB will complete a 
minimum of eight projects per year, which are led by the SSBB himself/her­
self or by the SSGBs who they are supporting. The SSBB assignment usually 
lasts for 2 years. It is recommended that the organization have one SSBB for 
every 100 employees. A typical SSBB spends his/her time as follows:
• 35%—running projects that he/she is assigned to lead
• 20%—helping SSGBs that are assigned to lead projects
• 20%—teaching either formally or informally
• 15%—doing analytical work
• 10%—defining additional projects
The SSBB must be skilled in six areas:
• Project management
• Leadership
• Analytical thinking
• Adult learning
• Organizational change management
• Statistical analysis
Based upon our experience, most of the SSBB training has been directed 
at analytical skills. Even the selection of the SSBB is based upon his or her 
analytical interests. This is wrong. Traits to look for in selecting a SSBB are:
• Trusted leader
• Self-starter
• Good listener

178  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Excellent communicator
• Politically savvy
• Has a detailed knowledge of the business
• Highly respected
• Understands processes
• Customer focused
• Passionate
• Excellent planner
• Holds to schedules
• Motivating
• Gets projects done on schedule and at cost
• Understands the organization’s strategy
• Excellent negotiation skills
• Embraces change
SSBBs should be specialists, not just coaches. It is important to build 
a cadre of highly skilled SSBBs. However, they must not be placed in 
charge of management of the improvement process. SSBBs are some­
times responsible for managing individual projects, but not directing 
the overall improvement process—that should be the job of manage­
ment. Don’t just keep management engaged in the process—keep them 
in charge of the process.
SSBBs are required to have mastered the two Six Sigma improvement 
methodologies. They are:
	
1.	Design, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC)
	
2.	Design, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV)
In this book we will only be providing you with an overview of the Six 
Sigma methodology to understand the basic foundation of this methodol­
ogy. We suggest you read the book The Six Sigma Green Belt Handbook 
(Harrington, Gupta, and Voehl; Paton Press, Chico, CA, 2008), which 
defines in detail the basic tools used in these two methodologies. (See 
Sections 4 and 5 of this book for a detailed review of the advanced statisti­
cal and nonstatistical SSBB tools used in this methodology.)

On Integrating LSS and 
DMAIC with DMADV
IN A NUTSHELL
Lean and Six Sigma DMAIC and DMADV are two fundamentally differ­
ent but compatible approaches to process improvement. They are both very 
effective methodologies to be applied when the circumstances call for either 
one. Lean’s objective is to identify and eliminate waste in all processes, while 
DMAIC/DMADVs’ objectives are to identify and eliminate variation in a 
process. While leaders do not have to work the mechanics of the LSS tools, 
they need considerable savvy in the reading and interpretation of each tool’s 
outputs. Those who prepare well in this area are able to expect teams to 
use certain tools to answer certain kinds of questions (thereby driving the 
proper use of tools). Their understanding helps them to challenge some team 
findings, to coach teams that may get stuck or off track, and to anticipate 
the tools and data that will be useful in an upcoming review. Integrating 
Lean with DMAIC/DMADV is the subject of this chapter and offers the best 
of both worlds for process improvement practitioners that understand the 
strengths of each and integrate them seamlessly where applicable.

180  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
OVERVIEW
The identifying and eliminating waste concepts of Lean and the identify­
ing and eliminating variation concepts of DMAIC/DMADV have been 
difficult for the process improvement community to merge together in a 
seamless fashion, if at all. In fact, even today there remains poor under­
standing of how to make both of these excellent tools work in unison. 
Lean and DMAIC/DMADV show the individuality of each approach, and 
the complementary nature of these two unique and specific approaches 
together makes a powerful process improvement philosophy come alive. 
The goals of Lean can and do use some quantification; however, the Lean 
philosophy is predominantly qualitative in nature, and this overarching 
qualitative approach puts a few core beliefs above all activities. In fact, 
all activities should be traceable back to one of these qualitative busi­
ness drivers. These are all activities driven by customer demand, estab­
lishing continuous flow of products or services to meet these customer 
needs, and driving waste out of the process until the customer receives 
perfection as a result of your efforts. The goals of DMAIC/DMADV are 
rooted in quantitative analysis and the scientific method. In their book 
Science for All Americans (Oxford Press, New York, 1990), Rutherford 
and Ahlgren note: “Scientific habits of mind can help people in every 
walk of life to deal with problems that often involve evidence, quanti­
tative considerations, logical arguments, and uncertainty … involving 
four key values: curiosity, openness to new ideas, skepticism, and critical 
thinking. Curiosity means being filled with questions, seeking answers, 
and verifying how good the answers are. Openness means being discovery-
oriented, even if the ideas are at odds to what is currently believed. 
Skepticism means accepting new ideas only when they are borne out by 
the evidence and logically consistent. Critical thinking means not being 
swayed by weak arguments. Collectively these 4 key values represent the 
foundation for Scientific Thinking.

On Integrating LSS and DMAIC with DMADV  •  181
While the above difficulties are real, they can be overcome by using the 
DMAIC/DMADV problem-solving process outlined in this application and 
by helping people overcome the roadblocks, which is the true focus of the 
science and art of this approach. Because all products, services, and outcomes 
result from a complex system of interaction of people, equipment, and pro­
cesses, it is crucial to understand the properties of such systems. Appreciation 
of the DMADV design and verification process helps us to understand the 
interdependencies and interrelationships among all of the components of a 
system, and thereby increases the accuracy of prediction and the impact of 
recommended changes throughout the system. However, a person can use the 
methods described in this application without knowing the theory behind 
them, just as a person can learn to drive a car without knowing how it moves. 
Dr. Edwards Deming once said that one need not be an expert in any part of 
scientific thinking in order to understand and apply it.
Points to Remember
Some of the difficulties that arise in applying the scientific thinking 
principles are:
• Overcoming resistance to change even when an innovative 
change is suggested, as it is difficult to get people to try the 
change and adapt themselves to the new situation
• Satisfying a diversity of viewpoints, as different team mem­
bers may have varying viewpoints as to what constitutes an 
improvement
• Thinking that any change using the DMAIC/DMADV process 
would be an improvement in its own right
• Taking the time to meet the objectives of the problem-solving 
process once the change is agreed to
• Recognizing when a change is an improvement through proper 
testing and follow-through

GOALS OF LEAN DMADV
The goals of Lean DMADV have their roots in Lean Manufacturing, a 
comprehensive term referring to manufacturing methodologies based 
on maximizing value and minimizing waste in the manufacturing pro­
cess. Lean Manufacturing evolved in Japan from its beginning in Ford 
Motor when Toyota built on Henry Ford’s concepts for the elimination of 
waste and just-in-time stocking to create the Toyota Production System 
(TPS) in Japan. Many of the most recognizable phrases, including Kaizen 
and Kanban, are Japanese terms that have become standard in Lean 
Manufacturing and in the past 10 years or so have rapidly spread to the 
service, government, military, and not-for-profit sectors.
Lean Design
In today’s globally competitive environment, speed is the currency. Global 
competition can respond to a market need virtually overnight, and in 
various and sundry product categories, the ultimate market winners and 
losers are being decided in a matter of weeks rather than years. To survive 
in this maelstrom, design teams need to be fast, efficient, and highly effec­
tive. True excellence in time-to-market, however, requires cooperation 
among several functional areas (at a minimum, marketing, design engi­
neering, and manufacturing), along with something that is often in short 
supply in industry today: discipline. Lean design and development is a 
process and, as such, can only work if the process is actually used. During 
the past 20 years, we have worked with countless firms that have a well-
defined product development process—on paper. Somewhere on a dusty 
cobwebbed shelf there is a thick, formal document that describes how the 
development cycle should proceed. However, this formal process is not 
consistently applied, critical activities are often waived, and in some cases, 
the process is abandoned entirely in the interest of “getting the product 
out the door.” Why this happens is no mystery. Most organizations have 
adopted a canned development process that either: (1) worked somewhere 
else and was borrowed, (2) has been bestowed with the title of “best prac­
tice” but as history has proven, no practice stays as a best practice for long, 
or (3) was implemented by an outside consultant that initially made a great 
sales pitch and many promises, but failed to recognize the unique nature

of the firm’s industry, culture, and customers. The result is often an over­
blown, cobbled-together process that is so cumbersome and restrictive 
that it just begs to be circumvented.
The solution is a set of Lean design methods that can take you from slow 
and steady to quick and agile. Each method addresses a different aspect of 
the product development process: the harvesting of initial customer inputs, 
the planning of a development project, resource allocation and prioritiza­
tion, time and workflow management, and several practical techniques for 
improved organization, communication, and execution. All methods are 
intuitive, team-friendly, and designed for flexibility. Furthermore, all of 
the best-known Lean product design methods are intended to guide you 
toward what we consider to be a waste-free ideal.
So where do you start? Naturally, your highest priorities for improvement 
will greatly depend on the nature of your specific market situation, but in gen­
eral, cost reduction (the dimension we are calling Lean 3P) is the most logical 
starting point. Why? Depending on your business environment, it might be 
that slashing time-to-market or driving toward higher levels of innovation 
will give you greater overall benefit. However, reducing manufacturing cost is 
the fastest and surest way to achieve a measurable increase in profits. Speeding 
up the development process often requires disruptive changes in how a firm 
operates, and those changes may impact virtually everyone in the company. 
Moreover, the benefits won’t be felt for months or years, depending on your 
typical development cycle time. Cost reduction, on the other hand, can be 
applied to both new product ideas and existing successful products, requires 
minimal organizational change, and can yield immediate bottom-line results. 
Therefore, slashing costs has always been considered a great place to begin 
your journey toward Lean product design excellence.
There are numerous opportunities to slash manufacturing cost during 
the Lean design cycle, including:
• Reduce direct material cost: Common parts, common raw materials, 
parts-count reduction, design simplification, reduction of scrap and 
quality defects, elimination of batch processes, etc.
• Reduce direct labor cost: Design simplification, design for Lean 
manufacture and assembly, parts-count reduction, matching prod­
uct tolerances to process capabilities, standardizing processes, etc.
• Reduce operational overhead: Minimize impact on factory layout, cap­
ture cross-product-line synergies (e.g., a modular design/mass custom­
ization strategy), improve utilization of shared capital equipment, etc.

184  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Minimize nonrecurring design: Cost platform design strategies, 
parts standardization, Lean QFD/voice of the customer, Six Sigma 
methods, design of experiments, value engineering, production 
preparation (3P) process, etc.
• Minimize product-specific capital investment: Production prepara­
tion (3P) process, matching product tolerances to process capabili­
ties, value engineering/design simplification, design for one-piece 
flow, standardization of parts, etc.
To positively impact these five critical factors in product cost, we’ve out­
lined Lean design tools that address all aspects of cost reduction, from 
capturing early voice-of-the-customer inputs to ensuring a smooth and 
successful transition to a Lean Manufacturing environment. The Lean 
design approach offers tremendous flexibility, allowing firms to easily cre­
ate their own customized cost reduction strategy. Lean design helps its 
adopters design for profit at the source. A product’s design determines 
most of a company’s costs and rewards.
Focusing on the design, Lean design helps its adopters realize tremen­
dous increases in profits and market share. Lean design calculates life 
cycle costs, including the costs of quality, and eventually calculates a 
sigma number. Design trade-offs can be quickly analyzed to see the effects 
on total accounted costs. The Lean design approach is becoming a proven 
methodology that ultimately builds business cases that guide their SSBBs 
and sponsors to the areas that show the highest returns on investment.
Points to Remember
At the heart of Lean design methods is the determination of value. 
Value is defined as an item or feature for which a customer is willing to 
pay. All other aspects of the manufacturing or service delivery process 
are deemed waste. Lean design is used as a tool to focus resources and 
energies on designing and producing the value-added features while 
identifying and eliminating no-value-added activities at the begin­
ning, not years after the prototype is in operation. For the purposes of 
this chapter, a Lean design is an approach toward a determination of a 
desired future an organization wishes to achieve. It describes what the 
organization is trying to accomplish and bring to market.

GOALS OF DMAIC/DMADV
The goals for both DMAIC and DMADV are based upon systematic quan­
titative approaches to process improvement and process design, respec­
tively. The basic structure and goals of each of these approaches is focused 
on identification and elimination of variation in both process design and 
process improvement.
The following is a clarification of the DMAIC process:
• Define: Select an appropriate project and define the problem, espe­
cially in terms of customer-critical demands.
• Measure: Assemble measurable data about process performance and 
develop a quantitative problem statement.
• Analyze: Analyze the causes of the problem and verify suspected 
root cause(s).
• Improve: Identify actions to reduce defects and variation caused 
by root cause(s) and implement selected actions, while evaluat­
ing the measurable improvement (if not evident, return to step 1, 
Define).
• Control: Control the process to ensure continued, improved perfor­
mance and determine if improvements can be transferred elsewhere. 
Identify lessons learned and next steps.
Overview of How DMAIC Works
The tools of process improvement are most often applied within a simple 
performance improvement model known as Define, Measure, Analyze, 
Improve, and Control (DMAIC). DMAIC is summarized in Table  6.1. 
DMAIC is used when a project’s goal can be accomplished by improving 
an existing product, process, or service.
DMAIC is such an integral part of both the Lean and Six Sigma 
approaches that it has been used by the authors to organize the mate­
rial for a major part of our previously published books, Six Sigma Green 
Belt Handbook and Six Sigma Yellow Belt Handbook. It provides a useful 
framework for conducting Six Sigma projects and is often used to create a 
“gated process” for project control.

186  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Overview of How DMADV Works
The following is a clarification of the DMADV process:
• Define: Define design goals that are consistent with customer demands.
• Measure: Identify and measure product characteristics that are criti­
cal to quality (CTQ).
• Analyze: Analyze to develop and design alternatives, create a high-
level design, and evaluate design capability to select the best design.
• Design: Complete design details, optimize the design, and plan for 
design verification.
• Verify: Verify the design, set up pilot runs, implement the produc­
tion process, and hand it over to the process owners.
One strategic objective of any organization is the continual improve­
ment of its processes in order to gain competitive advantage, enhance its 
TABLE 6.1
Defining How DMAIC Works
D
Define the goals of the improvement activity. The most important goals are 
obtained from customers. At the top level the goals will be the strategic objectives 
of the organization, such as greater customer loyalty, a higher return on 
investment (ROI) or increased market share, or greater employee satisfaction. At 
the operation’s level, a goal might be to increase the throughput of a production 
department. At the project level, goals might be to reduce the defect level and 
increase throughput for a particular process. Obtain goals from direct 
communication with customers, shareholders, and employees.
M
Measure the existing system. Establish valid and reliable metrics to help monitor 
progress toward the goal(s) defined at the previous step. Begin by determining the 
current baseline. Use exploratory and descriptive data analysis to help you 
understand the data.
A
Analyze the system to identify ways to eliminate the gap between the current 
performance of the system or process and the desired goal. Use statistical tools to 
guide the analysis.
I
Improve the system. Be creative in finding new ways to do things better, cheaper, or 
faster. Use project management and other planning and management tools to 
implement the new approach. Use statistical methods to validate the 
improvement.
C
Control the new system. Institutionalize the improved system by modifying 
compensation and incentive systems, policies, procedures, MRP, budgets, 
operating instructions, and other management systems. You may wish to utilize 
standardization such as ISO 9000 to assure that documentation is correct. Use 
statistical tools to monitor stability of the new systems.

performance, and benefit interested parties, such as customers, employees, 
and shareholders. In many situations, however, improving a process is not 
a sound business option. Rather, a complete process redesign is required. 
DMADV is the Six Sigma methodology that focuses on process design/
redesign. In Define, the project purpose and scope are established. In 
Measure, voice-of-the-customer data are translated into critical to quality 
characteristics (i.e., design measurements) that the design must meet. The 
project team then generates innovative design concepts, evaluates, and 
selects the best concept for the design (Analyze). High-level designs are 
then developed and tested (Design). Verification against design require­
ments and validation against intended use are followed by transitioning 
the new design to process owners for rollout, implementation, and control, 
completing the DMADV methodology. (See Table 6.2.) Another approach, 
used when the goal is the development of a new or radically redesigned 
product, process, or service, is DMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, 
Design, and Verify). DMADV is part of the Design for Lean Six Sigma 
(DFSS) toolkit.
COMPARING DMAIC AND DMADV
On one hand, DMAIC is a process improvement tool that is used to modify 
a process that already exists and does not always provide the performance 
that is desired, and provides a foundation for a systematic and structured 
examination of any process. On the other hand, DMADV is a process

definition and creation tool that outlines and uses a systematic approach 
to define, create, and execute a new process for a situation where no pro­
cess currently exists. Although DMAIC and DMADV have some similar 
characteristics, DMADV holds the upper hand where a completely clean 
starting point to design is needed, instead of a continuous improvement 
building upon the existing process/system. DMADV promotes creative 
and innovative thinking to create the best process possible from the cus­
tomer standpoint. It allows process designers the freedom to brainstorm 
with the approach “If I had a genie who gave me three wishes and a magic 
wand that could create the perfect process, then what would it look like?”
Here is an important point to remember: Use DMAIC to improve pro­
cesses and use DMADV to design new ones.
No matter how you approach deploying improvement teams in your 
organization, they will all need to know what is expected of them. That 
is where having a standard improvement model, such as DMAIC, is 
extremely helpful. It provides teams with a roadmap. DMAIC is a struc­
tured, disciplined, rigorous approach to process improvement consisting 
of the five phases mentioned, where each phase is linked logically to the 
previous phase as well as to the next phase.
INTEGRATING LEAN WITH DMAIC/DMADV
The worlds of Lean and DMAIC/DMADV (Six Sigma) have been seem­
ingly at odds for many years. This is primarily due to the difficulty of 
practitioners grappling with the two fundamentally different concepts—
identifying and eliminating waste versus identifying and eliminating 
variation. As different approaches to process improvement, when applied 
in the proper situation, Lean and DMAIC/DMADV can integrate to form 
a more powerful tool than either can be standing alone.
Virtually all Lean concepts integrate well with DMAIC and DMADV. 
Our purpose in this section of the handbook is to focus on special con­
siderations for using the Lean concepts integrated with the DMAIC/
DMADV process in any environment, including both methods and tools 
that are particularly helpful as well as hints on how to model the people 
side of each phase.
Lean thinking supports two basic disciplines for speeding up the knowl­
edge creation process—short, frequent learning cycles and delayed com­
mitment. Short, frequent learning cycles are the antithesis of thorough 

On Integrating LSS and DMAIC with DMADV  •  189
front-end planning, but they are the best approach to processes that have 
the word development in their title. In product development, for example, 
the typical process is to define requirements, choose a solution, refine the 
solution, and implement the solution. Although this process is common, 
it is not the best way to generate knowledge. Conversely, the delayed com­
mitment approach of Toyota is much faster and delivers products of supe­
rior quality that consistently outsell the competition. Toyota builds sets 
of possibilities to satisfy customer needs, and then, through a series of 
combining and narrowing, the new product emerges. The combining and 
narrowing process is paced by milestones that define stages of the nar­
rowing process. Milestones are always met, despite the fact that there are 
no task breakouts or tracking. Decisions are delayed as long as possible, so 
that they can be based on the maximum amount of information.
However, Lean thinking sometimes has a big blind spot for the most pow­
erful aspect of Six Sigma—its ability to connect business leaders and key 
project teams in a potent two-way, fact-based dialogue. To see and under­
stand that an exploration of Six Sigma roadmap architecture is needed, 
Lean tools can be dovetailed nicely into virtually any DMAIC or DMADV 
project, regardless of the size and scope involved. They can be used to accen­
tuate DMAIC or DMADV concepts and tools, or as some basic stand-alone 
techniques to produce a vital component of the DMAIC/DMADV project. 
Table  6.3 illustrates how and where Lean tools can be integrated with 
DMAIC/DMADV Project Framework.
As demonstrated in Table 6.3, the application of Lean tools and tech­
niques fits neatly into the structured approach of Six Sigma. Whether you 
are conducting a DMAIC or DMADV project, Lean can play a significant 
role in either process design or process improvement. Both concepts fit 
nicely in the tollgate format, and both align with a structured approach, 
and have at their core the use of root cause analysis (RCA) as a means for 
driving effective and permanent process improvement.
Root Cause Analysis and Lean
The common crossover point between Lean and DMAIC/DMDV is in 
the root cause analysis (RCA). The primary difference between Lean and 
DMAIC/DMADV is that Lean projects can use both qualitative and quan­
titative RCA analysis, such as the five whys, cause-and-effect diagrams, 
and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), to name a few that are com­
mon to both.

The idea is to become more acquainted with the Lean RCA toolbox and 
apply the appropriate tools and technique in order to address a serious Lean 
workplace situation. Further, since problem solving is an integral part of the 
Lean management continuous improvement process, RCA is viewed as one 
of the core building blocks of the Lean organization. In itself, RCA will not 
produce any results, as it must be made part of the larger problem-solving 
effort, i.e., part of the conscious attitude that embraces a relentless pursuit of 
improvements at every level in every department or business process of the 
organization. In short, RCA is a highly versatile analysis approach that needs 
some structure in order to be successful. The sheer number of groups of tools 
available can be enough to dissuade anyone from embarking on analysis.

SUMMARY
Many organizations first initiate their LSS journey with DMAIC problem 
solving and improvement, which makes sense for the most part as DMAIC 
brings rapid improvement to existing process problem areas by quickly 
returning significant savings dollars and cycle time reductions to the bot­
tom line. And because DMAIC projects often point to problem root causes 
in the design of products or processes, interest in DMADV (or DFSS, as 
it is sometimes called) often develops as an offshoot in connection with 
improvement work needing redesign. Thus, LSS business leaders may find 
themselves struggling to manage two methods or approaches and road­
maps instead of a unified one. However, the good news is that in a world 
where “innovate and design” are naturally separated from “improvement 
work,” a two-roadmap system may work just fine.
In many of our client-related engagements, many of which are pro­
filed in this handbook, design is often interwoven with existing products

and processes, and improvement often means revisiting the core funda­
mental design. In those situations, the SSTs, belts, and champions can 
waste a ton of energy worrying, “Is this a DMAIC or DMADV project, or 
both?” When an organization starts to feel that too much time is being 
spent worrying about the distinctions between DMAIC and DMADV 
(or is it DFSS?), it may be time to move forward and integrate and sim­
plify things. Experienced LSS practitioners may notice that the thought 
processes have some parallels, especially in the DMAIC Define and 
Control phases. While it is tempting, and in some cases even possible, to 
integrate the approaches in new and creative ways, it is best to use some 
common approaches with an eye toward caution, as effective integration 
of the roadmaps requires special attention be paid to the subtle ways in 
which they are different.
Table 6.4 is a major step in guiding a team toward the correct method­
ology, no matter where on the roadmap the team was when the project’s 
nature became clear.
The concluding section of this chapter was summarized in Table 6.4, 
which depicted a synthesis and integrated view of what happens if the 
DMAIC and DMADV thought processes are distilled to a high enough 
level that one map might be laid out instead of two. The “Operational 
Definition” columns showed the various distinctions that might be impor­
tant to a particular team, depending on whether its current project was 
DMAIC or DFSS (or somewhere in the middle). The intended takeaway 
from this view is that DMA is where many of the DMAIC and DMADV 
distinctions lie. While they can be overlaid, it is important for each proj­
ect team member to understand as early as possible where they are on the 
DMAIC-DMADV continuum. Some projects start out “thinking they are 
DMAIC” only to find (somewhere in D, M, or A) that they are really more 
DMADV—or vice versa.
All practitioners appreciate that roadmaps are needed to guide the work 
in Six Sigma, and that there is an understandable need to simplify and 
integrate when their complexity starts to get in the way. While consider­
ing a “branched” and a “parallel” approach to integrating DMAIC and 
DMADV, SSBBSs must be armed with as much insight as possible before 
deciding what is best in their particular environment.

Analyze
What has the team 
learned about current 
performance/
capability?
This will apply directly, as there 
is a great deal more current 
performance to document 
and analyze for a typical 
DMAIC-type project
There may not be a current 
process for the work 
under consideration, but 
generally the performance 
of a relevant as-is process 
helps document the state 
of the art or leading edge
What can the team learn 
from patterns and 
statistical contrasts in 
the data?
“Peeling the onion” to get down 
to root causes and fundamental 
drivers in order to remove 
those causes and fix the 
problem at its core—removing 
or reducing the waste in the 
as-is process; the historic/
current process data are the key 
source of data and insight
Understanding the design 
drivers in order to guide 
upcoming decisions about 
which factors will be 
included in and adjusted 
to optimize business net 
value; models, prototypes,

are key sources of data 
and insight
Can the team verify the 
root cause or driving 
impacts of the X’s on 
the Y’s?
In DMAIC the X-Y 
connections are part of the 
known, existing system; the 
work here focuses on 
quantifying that relationship 
In DMADV, the XY

involve prototyping or 
modeling the XY

LSSBB Advanced 
Nonstatistical Tools
INTRODUCTION
Having the right tool makes the difference between success and failure.
—H. James Harrington
In this section we present the key body of knowledge for advanced nonsta­
tistical tools that all LSSBBs will be using the most often. In Section 5 we 
present the advanced statistical tools that are used most often by LSSBBs. 
In these two sections we provide you with the tools to solve your most dif­
ficult problems and take advantage of the many opportunities to improve 
your processes. The tools in these two chapters are in addition to the tools 
that a potential LSSBB should already have mastered as an SSGB. As an 
LSSBB, it is essential that you are competent at using these tools in order to 

202  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
lead your LSS project teams. We liken using just the basic Green Belt tools 
to improve complex opportunities for improvement to trying to build a 
house using just a yardstick, hammer, and handsaw. It can be done, but 
the quality of the results will be poor, it will take a long time to do it, 
and the costs will be high. Today a professional builder wouldn’t think 
about building a house without using power saws, power hammers, power 
screwdrivers, and laser measurement tools. If you use these power tools to 
build a house, the result will be that the construction will be done faster, 
with higher quality and lower costs. Similarly, these additional tools pro­
vide the LSSBB with the means and power to define the very best solution 
to complex situations.
The tools in Section 4 are presented in alphabetical order. Most of these 
tools are first defined, and then you are instructed on how to use them. 
Next, you are provided with examples of how they have been used before.

OVERVIEW
There are three main objectives for learning the LSSBB methodology:
• To master two systematic approaches to problem solving that have 
a very good track record of producing excellent results—DMAIC 
(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) and DMADV 
(Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify)
• To master a number of very effective tools that can be used to 
solve problems
• To master the way to apply LSSBB methodology to bring about trans­
formation within an organization
To become an SSGB, you learned how to use the DMAIC approach to 
problem solving that was developed to minimize process variation. In 
addition, you were introduced to the following basic problem-solving 
tools:
• Affinity diagrams
• Brainstorming
• Cause-and-effect diagrams
• Check sheets
• Failure mode and effects analysis
• Flowcharts
• Force field analysis
• Graphs and charts
• Histograms
• Kano model
• Nominal group techniques

204  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Pareto diagrams
• Root cause analysis
• Scatter diagrams
• SIPOC diagrams
Note: In addition, an SSGB was introduced to many statistical tools.
As an active SSGB, we hope you have had a chance to use most of these 
tools in solving problems within your organization. The tools that were pre­
sented in the SSGB classes are the most commonly used tools, and they are 
designed to solve most of the problems that are assigned to a Six Sigma Team.
As an LSSBB, you will be required to have expanded skills that will pre­
pare you to solve the most complex problems. You will also learn how 
to effectively use the DMADV problem-solving approach that focuses 
on designing a total new process or product. DMADV is the Six Sigma 
approach to adapting process re-engineering to the Six Sigma philosophy. 
DMADV is used when the DMAIC approach will not produce the required 
level of improvement. It is designed to bring about a drastic improvement 
in performance. While DMAIC focuses on reducing variation, DMADV 
focuses on changing the performance level of the product or process. 
Figures S4.1 and S4.2 will help you understand the difference between the 
results of decreasing variation and improving the total process.
In the case of decreasing variation, the centerline remains the same but 
the amount of variation above the centerline is greatly reduced. In the case 
of total process improvement, the focus is not on decreasing variation but 
changing the position of the centerline.
As an LSSBB, you will need to understand the following 26 advanced 
nonstatistical tools. (In Section 5 we will discuss the additional advanced

Phase B

LSSBB Advanced Nonstatistical Tools  •  205
statistical tools that an LSSBB needs to understand and be able to use.) 
These 26 tools can and should be applied to both the DMADV and DMAIC 
problem-solving approaches. In fact, an LSSBB is often required to teach 
these tools to the members of a Six Sigma Team when they are needed to 
solve a problem. So it is imperative that as an LSSBB you understand these 
tools thoroughly. It is for this very reason that we have set aside a large part 
of this book to discuss these 26 tools. You will find all of these tools useful 
in working with both the DMAIC and DMADV methodologies.

For ease of reference, the tools are presented in alphabetical order rather 
than in the order they would be used in solving a problem.
WHERE ARE THESE TOOLS USED?
Table S4.1 defines what phase in the two Six Sigma methodologies that 
each GB and LSSBB tool is most apt to be used in. This does not indicate 
that the tool should be used each time a project goes through the indicated 
phase; in fact, some of the tools may not be used in 1 in 10 projects that go 
through the indicated phase.
SUPPORTING SOFTWARE
The tools that we present in the next chapters use many different types of 
graphs, tables, charts, diagrams, and statistical formulas that are time-
consuming to use and prepare. To aid you in using these tools, a number 
of software packages are available, and newly upgraded ones are coming 
out all the time.
The two most frequently used software applications for statistical analy­
sis are Minitab and JPM/SAS. These software applications give thorough 
statistical analysis results. They are both advanced tools, and users should 
have more than an introduction to statistics understanding in order to 
avoid making invalid decisions.
Software applications have been written for many Six Sigma tools. 
Software has been written to help use the tools listed in Table S4.2.

Black Belt Nonstatistical 
Tools (A through M)
Without sound data you can’t make sound decisions.
—H. James Harrington
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter a number of very important tools are presented. Read 
them carefully and take time to think about how you can apply each 
of the tools to one of the improvement opportunities that are available 
within your organization and/or the problems that you solve as an SSGB 
or LSSBB.
In many organizations the LSSBB will be required to teach these tools 
and the Green Belt tools to Six Sigma Team members. Take time to think 
about how you would teach each tool to the people who would make up 
a Six Sigma Team that you would be leading. We recognize that you may 
feel that you don’t have the experience or the skills to teach all of these and 
the SSGB tools after just reading about them or just attending a class on 
them. That is why before a person can function fully and effectively as an 
LSSBB, he or she needs to have experience working on projects. It is best 
if the potential LSSBB has already been introduced to some of these tools 
when he or she was working on a project led by an LSSBB.

—H. James Harrington
Definition
Created by Ohno Shingo, 5S is a workplace organization methodology 
that uses a list of five Japanese words: seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, and 
shitsuke. Translated into English, they all start with the letter S. They are:
	
1.	Sorting (seiri)
	
2.	Straightening or setting-in-order (seiton)
	
3.	Sweeping or shining or cleanliness/systematic cleaning (seiso)
	
4.	Standardizing (seiketsu)
	
5.	 Sustaining the discipline or self-discipline (shitsuke)

Just the Facts
5S is a system to optimize productivity by reducing waste and maintain­
ing an orderly workplace. These actions are geared to achieving better and 
more efficient operational results. This is usually the first method imple­
mented when starting a Lean process. It is intended to clean up and orga­
nize the workplace to make it more effective and efficient.
Example
Organizing the placement of tools and replacing tools in their specified 
location allows for more efficiency in the use of the tools. A simple look at 
the storage area will immediately show which tools are missing or in use.

BENCHMARKING OF PROCESSES
Benchmark to know how much you can improve and how to do it.
Definition
Benchmarking of processes is a systematic way to identify superior 
processes and practices that are adopted or adapted to a process in 
order to reduce cost, decrease cycle time, cut inventory, and provide 
greater satisfaction to the internal and external customers.
Just the Facts
Xerox started the recent enthusiasm for process benchmarking when it 
credited benchmarking as the tool that caused the company’s performance 
to turn around in the mid-1980s. As John Cooney, one of Xerox’s market­
ing managers, puts it, “Benchmarking has become a way of life at Xerox.”
Benchmarking helps organizations bring on new ideas. It makes organi­
zations reexamine the way they are doing things. When U.S. organizations 
dominated the world’s market, they didn’t have outside pressures driving 
their improvement efforts, so they could take their own sweet time. Today 
U.S. organizations no longer dominate the world’s market, so their bench­
marking activities must take on an international focus.
Don’t misunderstand. The United States is not second best in everything. 
In many industries, it is still the world leader. But there is a lot of competi­
tion out there, hungry to take away customers. Foreign competitors are 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  217
just as creative as American organizations; for example, foreign organiza­
tions accounted for over 50% of new U.S. patents in 1994. And they can 
still remember what it is like to go hungry. In my view, there is a direct 
correlation between the last time a worker went hungry and his or her 
work ethic.
IBC, based in Houston, Texas, conducted a survey of 76 organizations 
and found that:
• Benchmarking was considered to be a necessary tool for survival.
• Most firms did not know how to systematically conduct a bench­
marking project.
• 95% of the organizations surveyed felt that most firms do not know 
how to benchmark.
• 79% of the organizations believed that top management must be very 
actively involved if the benchmarking process is going to be successful.
In a survey of 770 organizations in Europe, the Benchmarking Centre 
(UK) found that:
• 89% of the organizations rated “finding competent benchmarking 
partners” as their most important requirement.
• 70% of the UK organizations were doing benchmarking.
• 95% of the organizations were willing to share information with a 
benchmarking center.
During World War II a recruitment poster read: “Join the Navy and 
see the world.” Too many managers and professionals today view bench­
marking in the same light. They have changed the slogan to read: “Join a 
benchmarking team and see the world.” This is far from the truth. Studies 
show that for every hour spent visiting a benchmarking partner’s site, 
over 200 hours are required in planning, collecting, and analyzing data 
and implementing changes. Benchmarking is not site visits. It is creative 
analysis of thousands of pieces of information to bring about a change in 
the benchmark item—a change that is often as drastic as the caterpillar’s 
transformation into the monarch butterfly.

218  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
When all is said and done, the most difficult part of the benchmark­
ing process is awakening to the fact that your operation does not know 
it all. Most U.S organizations are just too egotistical to admit that they 
can learn anything from another organization. The benchmarking pro­
cess starts when you admit that your counterparts in Mainland China, 
Portugal, Malaysia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, and elsewhere 
may have an idea that is better than yours.
David T. Kearns, chief executive officer of Xerox Corporation, defines 
benchmarking as “the continuous process of measuring products, service, 
and practices against the toughest competition or those companies rec­
ognized as industrial leaders.” Benchmarking is a never-ending discovery 
and learning experience that identifies and evaluates best processes and 
performance in order to integrate them into an organization’s present pro­
cess to increase its effectiveness, efficiency, and adaptability. It provides 
a systematic way to identify superior products, services, processes, and 
practices that can be adopted or adapted to your environment to reduce 
costs, decrease cycle time, cut inventory, and provide greater satisfaction 
to your internal and external customers.
Benchmarking is often viewed as simply purchasing competitive prod­
ucts to compare them with the ones manufactured by the organization. 
This is called product benchmarking or reverse engineering and is not the 
one that will be discussed in this approach.
Process benchmarking is a lot like a detective story, and the person 
doing the benchmarking operates a lot like a detective. He or she must 
search through the many clues available in the public domain to find leads 
and then follow up on these leads to identify and understand the truly 
world-class processes. It can be an exciting and enlightening adventure.
What Will Benchmarking Do for You?
Benchmarking requires a lot of work, and once you start, it is an ongo­
ing process to keep it updated. Why, then, should any organization even 
begin? It is because the benefits of benchmarking far outweigh the effort 
and expense. Benchmarking:
• Provides you with a way to improve customer satisfaction
• Defines best applicable processes

History of Benchmarking
During the 1960s, IBM realized that its costs could be reduced signifi­
cantly, and the quality of its process-sensitive products improved, if its 
worldwide locations adopted the best existing practices. As a result, a cor­
porate procedure was written requiring all process-sensitive products to 
be manufactured using compatible processes. This launched a corporate-
wide effort to have common practices at all locations or, if that proved 
impractical, to have compatibility between common processes. The deter­
mination to identify the best manufacturing processes gave IBM a signifi­
cant international competitive advantage.
In the late 1970s, in a similar move, Xerox decided to compare its 
U.S. products with those of its Japanese affiliate, Fuji-Xerox. Xerox was 
shocked to discover that Fuji was selling copiers at a price equivalent to 
what it cost U.S. Xerox to manufacture the copiers. This discovery spear­
headed a successful program to reduce costs in the U.S. manufacturing 
process. Based on the success of this pilot program, Xerox management 
later incorporated benchmarking as a key element in its corporate-
wide improvement efforts. The formal initiation of the program began 
around 1983. Through this program, benchmarking took on new dimen­
sions, and benchmarking techniques were applied to support processes as 
well as product processes.

220  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Today many organizations use benchmarking to help drive their con­
tinuous improvement efforts. For example, Motorola cites benchmarking 
as one of the major tools powering its improvement process, for which it 
was awarded the Malcolm Baldrige Award in 1988.
Types of Benchmarking
Essentially, there are two generic types of benchmarking:
• Internal
• External
Internal Benchmarking
Internal benchmarking compares practices within one part of an orga­
nization to those of a more advanced unit within the same organization. 
This type of benchmarking is the easiest to conduct because there are no 
security and confidentiality problems to overcome.
The 14 Steps to Do Internal Benchmarking
There are 14 basic steps in an internal benchmarking effort:
	
1.	Identify what to benchmark. Identify the products, processes, and/or 
activities that should be benchmarked. Plan to develop a database of 
benchmarking information.
	
2.	Obtain management support. Obtain management support for the 
benchmark activities. This support must include project approval 
and approved human and financial resources. It may be beneficial 
to form a corporate benchmark committee, both to build a base of 
support and to review the data after they are collected.
	
3.	Develop benchmark measurements. Benchmark measurements use 
both qualitative and quantitative data.
	
4.	Determine how to collect data. Four commonly used data collection 
methods are:
• Exchange of process data, procedures, and flowcharts
• Telephone interviews and surveys
• Joint committees
• Site visits
	
In most cases, all four will be used.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  221
	
5.	Review plans with location experts. Search out people who under­
stand the process being evaluated and ask them to:
• Review the data plan
• Recommend other locations that are doing the same or similar 
activities well
• Suggest contacts for information
	
6.	Select locations. Select the locations to be benchmarked using the 
updated data collection plan.
	
7.	Exchange data. Contact key process people within your location 
or from other locations and explain what you are trying to accom­
plish. Ask them to become partners in the benchmarking effort. 
Offer to send them copies of your measurement data, procedures, 
and process flowcharts. Request that they review these data and 
send back their data in a similar format, along with any comments 
they have.
	
8.	Conduct telephone interviews and surveys. After carefully reviewing 
the other locations’ data, call your contacts and discuss the data you 
received from them to clarify key activities. In complex studies, a writ­
ten survey should be used instead of a telephone interview because 
it allows the individual to acquire exact data and to document the 
response.
	
9.	Conduct location visits. The benchmarking team or corporate bench­
marking committee should conduct a detailed tour of the process 
being benchmarked. Each member should then write process review 
reports defining strengths and weaknesses observed.
	 10.	Analyze the data. Construct a process flow diagram including the 
best processes and practices from all locations. Then estimate the 
expected performance if the optimum process is implemented.
	 11.	Establish a process-change plan. Based on the process diagram devel­
oped in step 10, the team or committee should conduct a change-
impact analysis to prioritize the implementation activities. In some 
cases, organizations may decide not to make any process changes. 
The decision to implement the change now or later will depend on 
the projected gains resulting from the change.
	 12.	Implement one change at a time. Implement the high-priority changes 
one at a time. By implementing one change at a time, it is easier to 
assess the impact of each change on the total process. It is also far less 
disruptive to the overall operation.

222  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
	 13.	Measure changes. Develop a system that measures the impact of 
each change on the total process. Many changes can have both posi­
tive and negative effects. Any measurement system should evaluate 
the impact of a change on effectiveness and efficiency as it relates to 
the total process.
	 14.	Report on an ongoing basis. Establish a measurement report com­
paring performance by location. Issue this report every six months.
External Benchmarking
External benchmarking applies the benchmarking approach to compa­
rable organizations outside your own. External benchmarking may be 
conducted with competitors or with world-class noncompetitors.
External benchmarking is divided into 3 sub-classifications. They are 
competitive, world-class operations, and activity-type benchmarking. 
For most processes, both internal and external benchmarking are used.
• External competitive benchmarking, also known as reverse engi­
neering, is a form of external benchmarking that requires investi­
gating a competitor’s products, services, and processes. The most 
common way to do this is to purchase competitive products and 
services and analyze them to identify competitive advantages.
• External world-class operations benchmarking is a form of external 
benchmarking that extends the benchmarking approach outside 
the organization’s direct competition to involve dissimilar indus­
tries. Many business processes are generic in nature and applica­
tion (e.g., warehousing, supplier relations, service parts logistics, 
advertising, customer relations, employee hiring) and can provide 
meaningful insights despite the fact that they are being used in an 
unrelated industry. Benchmarking dissimilar industries enables 
you to discover innovative processes not currently used in your 
particular product types that will allow your processes to become 
best in class. It is usually advisable to establish some criteria when 
selecting organizations to be benchmarked. Some of these criteria 
might include:
• Requirements of the external organization’s customers: High 
quality and high reliability or low quality and one-time usage.
• The characteristics of the external organization’s product: Size, 
shape, weight, environment, etc.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  223
• Type of industry: Grocery industry, office products industry, elec­
tronics industry, transportation industry, etc. In this case, consider 
broad industrial categories, not the specific products.
• After the external organization is selected, the benchmarking 
approach can be applied to a product, a process, or even an indi­
vidual activity.
The 14 Steps for External Benchmarking
There are 14 basic steps in an external benchmarking effort; the first 5 steps 
are the same as for internal benchmarking.
	
1.	Identify what to benchmark. Identify the products, processes, and/or 
activities that should be benchmarked. Plan to develop a database of 
benchmarking information.
	
2.	Obtain management support. Obtain management support for the 
benchmark activities. This support must include project approval 
and approved human and financial resources. It may be beneficial 
to form a corporate benchmark committee, both to build a base of 
support and to review the data after they are collected.
	
3.	Develop benchmark measurements. Benchmark measurements use 
both qualitative and quantitative data.
	
4.	Determine how to collect data. Four commonly used data collection 
methods are:
• Exchange of process data, procedures, and flowcharts
• Telephone interviews and surveys
• Joint committees
• Site visits
	
In most cases, all four will be used.
	
5.	Review plans with location experts. Search out people who under­
stand the process being evaluated and ask them to:
• Review the data plan
• Recommend other locations that are doing the same or similar 
activities well
• Suggest contacts for information
	
6.	Develop a preliminary list of the best external organizations. Using 
information generated by internal benchmarking efforts or by direc­
tion of the corporate benchmarking committee, list organizations 
with a world-class reputation. (This preliminary list will later be 
refined.)

224  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
	
7.	Develop a data collection plan. There are many ways to collect infor­
mation on external organizations. Some of the most common are:
• Searches of literature
• Use of information developed by professional and trade associations
• Use of external experts
	
A great deal of data about the competition, and about world-class 
organizations in general, exists in the public domain. Devote the 
time and effort necessary to collect these data. The more you know 
about an organization before contacting it, the more likely you are to 
gain real insights into its processes.
	
8.	Make a final selection of benchmark organizations. Review the data 
you have collected to date and update your database. Identify any 
voids in the collected data. After a detailed analysis of these data, 
pinpoint the organizations to target for benchmarking and identify 
key contacts there.
	
	
At this point, you should have reduced your potential bench­
mark organizations to between three and five. Some organiza­
tions that looked good at first may have to be dropped from the list 
because of:
• Unwillingness to share data
• Lack of data
• Existence of better candidates
• Reputation as not the best performer
• Processes not comparable to yours
• Communications problems
• Travel costs
	
9.	Gather data. There are a number of ways to collect data from exter­
nal benchmark organizations. Among these are:
• Anonymous surveys administered by a third party
• Focus groups organized and facilitated by a third party
• Site visits
	
It is generally a good idea to conduct surveys before site visits. When 
conducting site visits, limit the visit team to two to eight people and 
identify the role of each in advance. Immediately after the visit (dur­
ing the same day, if possible) hold a meeting of the team to consoli­
date thinking and to record observations.
	 10.	Establish and update the benchmark database. The previous activities 
generate vast amounts of data that must be captured and analyzed. 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  225
The best way to do this is to constantly update the benchmark data­
base as each activity is performed.
	 11.	Analyze the data. Two types of data are collected and used in the 
benchmarking approach. The first type is qualitative data (word 
descriptions) and the second is quantitative data (numbers, ratios, 
etc.). For quantitative data, design a data matrix that highlights the 
parts of the process requiring additional data and study. Some effec­
tive ways to present and analyze qualitative data are:
• Word charts
• Written step-by-step procedures
• Flowcharts
	 12.	Establish a process-change plan. Conduct a change-impact analysis 
to prioritize the implementation activities. In some cases, organiza­
tions may decide not to make any process changes. The decision to 
implement a change now or later will depend on the projected gains 
resulting from the change.
	 13.	Implement one change at a time. Implement the high-priority changes 
one at a time. If you implement one change at a time, it is easier to 
assess the impact of each change on the total process. It is also far less 
disruptive to the overall operation.
	 14.	Measure changes. Develop a system to measure the impact of each 
change on the total process. Many changes can have both positive and 
negative effects. The measurement system should evaluate the total 
impact of the change on the effectiveness and efficiency of the process 
as a whole.
Guidelines and Tips
Use the Encyclopedia of Trade Associations to develop an initial list of tar­
get trade and professional associations.
• Qualify each potential association for:
• Its membership
• The types of conferences offered
• Prominent industry figures who are members
• Periodicals or journals published
• Develop a final list of leading associations in the industry or field.
• Contact the representatives of each association.

226  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Make sure you fully understand the product, process, or activity to 
be benchmarked before attempting to generate data.
• Make a concerted effort to establish a broad base of organizational 
support for the benchmarking effort. This is part of the change pro­
cess and is essential to using the data.
• When conducting competitive benchmarking, be careful not to 
expose yourself to risk by engaging in practices that could be consid­
ered illegal or unethical. Wherever possible, use information about 
competitors from the public domain.
What Are the Primary Reasons for 
Using Process Benchmarking?
The two primary reasons for using process benchmarking are goal set­
ting and process development. Every person, process, and organization 
needs goals to strive for. Without them, life is unrewarding, and we drift 
on a sea of confusion. We all want to improve. No one likes to be aver­
age. In the past, goals usually were based on the organization’s and/or the 
process’s past performance. There was little correlation between our goals 
and the ultimate standard of excellence. Occasionally, our goals exceeded 
what is achievable, but more commonly they fell far below what had been, 
or could be, achieved. As a result of setting low goals for ourselves, we 
enjoyed a false sense of accomplishment. We stopped trying to improve 
because we so easily met the low standards we set for ourselves. This pre­
vented many individuals, processes, and organizations from maturing to 
their full potential. Because it provides a means for setting challenging 
targets and attainable goals, benchmarking is the antidote to this self-
imposed mediocrity.
Even more important, process benchmarking provides a way to discover 
and understand methods that can be applied to your process to effect 
major improvements. This is the unique value of process benchmarking; 
it not only tells you how good you need to and can be, but it also tells you 
how to change your process to get there.
When setting up your measurement system for process benchmarking, 
you need to plan for two things—the what and the how. Both of these 
functions are important. What good is knowing how good world class is if 
you do not know how to improve your process to obtain it? Knowing that 
you are bad, but not being able to improve it, just discourages everyone. 
Similarly, what good is a new process idea if you do not know whether 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  227
it will have a positive impact on your process? You need to design your 
process benchmarking to provide both the what and the how.
The What
Measurements are absolutely crucial. If you cannot measure, you cannot 
control. If you cannot control, you cannot manage. It’s as simple as that. 
Quantitative data are absolutely essential ingredients in becoming and 
staying world class.
As critical as measurements are, it would seem that everyone would 
know just what needs to be measured. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
In fact, in most instances it is just the opposite, and this is particularly true 
when you talk about business processes. Process benchmarking should 
measure things such as:
• How much
• How fast
• How good
• When
• Where
• How long
• Size, shape, form, and fit
Although most product-type measurements are physical in nature, most 
process measurements are effort, cost, and time related. Consequently, it often 
is best to establish ratio measurements (e.g., return on investments, returns 
per year, unit costs, productivity rates) rather than actual values. The use of 
ratios allows data exchange without disclosing absolute values or production 
rates. This encourages free exchange of information between organizations.
The How
Another real advantage of process benchmarking is that it provides you 
with insights into how others have become the best. This aspect focuses 
on discovering how world-class organizations developed their processes 
and systems to ensure superior performance. At this juncture, we seek 
and analyze the how-to, the knowledge, the ways, the processes, and the 
methods responsible for making an organization, a process, or an activity 
the best of its kind. We then apply this knowledge to our process, adapting 
it to meet the unique requirements of our products, employees, customers, 
and organization’s personality.

BUREAUCRACY ELIMINATION METHODS
Our processes are designed to protect the organization from the 0.1% of 
our employees that are dishonest. So we penalize the 99.9% of our people 
that are honest and want to do a good job.
Definition
Bureaucracy elimination is an approach to identify and eliminate 
bureaucracy from business processes.
Just the Facts
The word streamlining suggests the ultimate search for efficiency and effec­
tiveness, an absence of fat and excess baggage, the smooth flow and unre­
stricted directness of effort and motion. Streamlining implies symmetry, 
harmony of elements, and beauty of design. Bureaucracy, on the other 
hand, means the opposite. It is a major stumbling block to the organized, 
systemic, organization-wide implementation of business process improve­
ment concepts and methods. Bureaucracy is everywhere, even when we

don’t recognize it. We must learn to actively search for and recognize it. 
Then, we need to eliminate it.
The Big B (bureaucracy) stands for bad, boring, burdensome, and brutal. 
We often think of bureaucracy as departments with layers of officials striv­
ing to advance themselves and their departments by creating useless tasks 
and rigid, incomprehensible rules. We think of long delays in processing 
as documents go through multiple channels and levels of review, requiring 
multiple signatures by people who are never available when needed. Their 
existence seems to add resistance to progress, adding cost but little real value.
Bureaucracy often creates excessive paperwork in the office. Managers 
typically spend 40 to 50% of their time writing and reading job-related 
materials; 60% of all clerical work is spent on checking, filing, and retriev­
ing information, while only 40% is spent on process value-added tasks. 
This bureaucracy results from organizational or individual personalities 
caused by such psychological factors as:
• Paranoia about being blamed for errors
• Poor training
• Distrust of anyone
• Lack of work
• Inability to delegate
• Lack of self-worth
• Thrill of checking for and finding minuscule mistakes
• Need to overcontrol
• Unwillingness to share information
The sinister effects of bureaucracy are innumerable and profoundly dam­
aging to every organization and to the business process improvement effort. 
Therefore, you should evaluate and minimize all delays, red tape, docu­
mentation, reviews, and approvals. If they are not truly necessary, you 
should eliminate them. A word of caution: Sometimes an activity may not 
have an obvious purpose but is, in fact, valuable to some other process in 
the organization, so don’t eliminate a bureaucratic operation without first 
understanding why it is in existence and what impact eliminating it would 
have on the organization.
Management must lead an attack against the bureaucracy that has crept 
into the systems controlling the business. Bureaucracy in government 
and business continues to worsen. These huge paperwork empires must 
be destroyed if industry is to flourish. Our copiers are used far too much, 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  239
and we have too many file cabinets. More than 90% of the documents we 
retain are never used again.
The attack on bureaucracy should start with a directive informing man­
agement and employees that the organization will not put up with unnec­
essary bureaucracy, that each approval signature and each review activity 
will have to be financially justified, that reducing total cycle time is a key 
business objective, and that any bureaucracy activity that delays the pro­
cess will be targeted for elimination.
There are two approaches to bureaucracy elimination:
• Process focused
• Incident focused
Process-Focused Approach
The process focus starts by flowcharting a process and then analyzing each 
step (activity) in the process to see if it is a bureaucracy-type step. You can 
identify bureaucracy by asking such key questions as:
• Are there unnecessary checks and balances?
• Does the activity inspect or approve someone else’s work?
• Does it require more than one signature?
• Are multiple copies required?
• Are copies stored for no apparent reason?
• Are copies sent to people who do not need the information?
• Are there people or agencies involved that impede the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the process?
• Is there unnecessary written correspondence?
• Do existing organizational procedures regularly impede the effi­
cient, effective, and timely performance of duties?
• Is someone approving something he or she has already approved? 
(for example, approving capital equipment that was already approved 
during the budget cycle)
The team needs to ask questions about each process step and then care­
fully consider the responses in order to gain insights that will help stream­
line the process. Many activities do not contribute to the content of the 
process output. They exist primarily for protection or informational pur­
poses, and every effort should be made to minimize these activities.

240  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
The team is apt to run into resistance related to the bureaucracy elimi­
nation activities because of varying opinions and organizational politics. 
Overcoming resistance to eliminating bureaucracy takes skill, tact, and 
considerable planning. Bureaucracy’s impact on cost and cycle time should 
be calculated; its impact on the internal and external customer should be 
understood. Once the full impact of bureaucracy is understood by all con­
cerned, it is often difficult to justify retaining the activity. The entire orga­
nization should continually eliminate every example of bureaucracy.
After completing the flow diagram, the team should review it, using a 
light blue highlighter to designate all activities related to review, approval, 
second signature, or inspection. The team will soon learn to associate blue 
on the flowchart with bureaucracy. These blue activities become key targets 
for elimination.
The managers responsible for each of the Big B activities should jus­
tify activity-related costs and delays. Often, a manager will try to push 
the matter aside, saying, “It only takes me 2 or 3 seconds to sign the 
document. That doesn’t cost the organization anything.” The answer to 
a remark like this is, “Well, if you don’t read the document, there is no 
reason to sign it.”
In one organization that started a Big B elimination campaign, a group 
of 10 capital equipment requests were processed through five levels of 
management approval signatures. Two requests contained only a legiti­
mate cover sheet with blank pages attached instead of the written justi­
fication required. And these two requests made it through all five levels 
of approval. This experiment shocked management into fully backing the 
Big B elimination campaign.
The justification for retaining a Big B activity requires some data. How 
many items are rejected? How much does the organization save when 
an item is rejected? Rejecting an item does not necessarily mean sav­
ings for the organization—quite the contrary. A rejected document may 
cause more bureaucracy, more delay, and increased costs. Time cycle 
delay costs are based on the advantage to the customer if the output 
from the process is delivered early. The justification for each Big B activ­
ity should be based on the potential loss or gain to the organization. If 
it is a break-even point, the activity always should be eliminated. Many 
organizations require a 3:1 return on any investment (ROI). This rule 
should apply to bureaucracy activities also. A bureaucracy step should 
be left in only if there is a sizable, documented savings from the activity. 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  241
Even then, the team should look at why the bureaucracy activity is sav­
ing money and see if there is any other, less expensive way of accom­
plishing the same result.
Incident-Focused Approach
With the individual incident-focused approach, the organization sets 
up a Big B Elimination Team that spearheads the bureaucracy elimi­
nation project. All employees in the organization are encouraged to 
request the Big B Elimination Team to investigate activities that are 
perceived to be bureaucratic. The Big B Elimination Team investigates 
each suggestion to determine if the activity should be eliminated or 
decreased. In conjunction with the person performing the activity 
under evaluation, a cost-benefit analysis is performed. Bureaucratic 
activities that do not have a 3:1 ROI are eliminated. This approach has 
the advantage of getting the total organization involved in the bureau­
cracy elimination process.
Examples
Example 1
The cost of Big B activities is more than we realize. Reading and approv­
ing a purchase order may cost the controller only 1 minute of time, but the 
process design to obtain that signature costs much more. Let’s look a little 
closer. (See Figure 7.6.)
In this example, the controller needs to justify delaying the purchase 
order an additional 2 days and increasing its cost by $26.00. The 2-day 
delay costs the organization 2 days of production savings that the new 
equipment would have realized if it came on-line 2 days earlier. This can 
amount to hundreds of dollars of added cost. The real losses caused by Big 
B activities are always much more than we originally estimate.
Example 2
IBM, Brazil, launched a Big B campaign that eliminated 50 unnecessary 
procedures, 450 forms, and 2.5 million documents a year.

242  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Example 3
To purchase a ballpoint pen (or anything else, for that matter) at Intel took 
95 administrative steps and 12 pieces of paper. When the company elimi­
nated the bureaucracy, the purchase took eight administrative steps and 
one form. Intel estimated its attack on Big B improved productivity by 
30% and saved $60 million a year. It would take the equivalent of $277 
million in increased sales for Intel to generate $60 million in profits.
IBM, San Jose, California, set up a bureaucracy elimination committee. 
Anyone that felt that a specific bureaucracy activity was unjustified was 
asked to bring it to this committee’s attention. The committee would then 
investigate it to define if it could be eliminated.

CONFLICT RESOLUTION
If we spent as much time loving as we do fighting, the world would double 
its population.
Definition
Conflict resolution is an approach to obtaining common agreement 
between two or more parties that have a different position or opinion. 
It involves techniques like:
• Negotiation
• Mediation
• Diplomacy
It often ends up with all parties finding an acceptable compromise. It is 
sometimes called dispute resolution. Typical tools include:
• Arbitration
• Litigation
• Ombudsman processes
• Mediation
Just the Facts
Conflict resolution in the Western culture involves communication between 
the parties and solving the problems by seeking a win-win position.
Example
The tools used for conflict resolution depend on the nature of the dispute, 
the individuals involved, and the individuals or companies affected by the 

244  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
dispute. Conflict resolution starts with identifying the problem from both 
sides (points of view). From here it is important to understand what con­
stitutes resolution by all parties. Then it involves communicating with the 
individuals in order to find common ground.
The appropriate tool to use will depend on all of these factors. A simple 
model was proposed by Stephen Covey in his book The Seven Habits of 
Highly Effective People. They are:
	
1.	Be proactive: Do something.
	
2.	Begin with the end in mind: What constitutes resolution?
	
3.	Put first things first: Identify points of agreement and conflict.
	
4.	Think win-win: Seek resolutions that will allow a win-win outcome.
	
5.	Seek first to understand, then to be understood: Don’t jump at the 
first resolution.
	
6.	Synergize: Seek ground where all parties are working together.
	
7.	Sharpen the saw. Exercise for physical renewal.

CRITICAL TO QUALITY
Measure your performance as your customer would measure it.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  245
Definition
Critical to quality (CTQ) is the analysis of the characteristics of a prod­
uct or service that are critical to the customer or to the performance of 
the product or service to guarantee that they meet requirements.
Just the Facts
Often a radar chart is used to identify critical to quality parameters/char­
acteristics related to the item being evaluated. The importance to satisfy­
ing the customers’ requirements is rated on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of 
the legs of the radar chart. By connecting the points, you can readily see 
which parameters are critical to satisfying the customer. In the example 
(Figure 7.7), you can see that two items would be classified as critical to 
quality: timely and defect/error-free. The other items, although important 
to your customer, are not critical.
Critical to Quality (CTQ) Characteristics
A tree diagram is another approach used to define customer CTQs to 
determine process performance in relationship to voice of the customer 
(VOC)/voice of the business (VOB). (See Figure 7.8.)

Definition
Cycle time analysis and reduction is an approach to reduce the time 
that it takes to move an item through a process.
Just the Facts
Based upon the International Quality Study conducted by Ernst & Young 
LLP and the American Quality Foundation, there are only six worldwide 
best practices:
• Top management involvement
• Strategic planning
• Supplier certification
• Process simplification
• Process value analysis
• Cycle time analysis
Time is money. Every time anything is not moving forward, it costs you 
money. To date, most of our focus has been on reducing processing time 
because we see it as added labor cost. But cycle time is also very important. 
Reducing time-to-market, time to respond to a customer request, and time to 
collect an outstanding bill can mean the difference between success and failure.
Critical business processes should follow the rule of thumb that time 
is money. Undoubtedly, process time uses valuable resources. Long cycle 
times prevent product delivery to our customers and increase storage costs. 
A big advantage Japanese auto companies have over American companies 
is their ability to bring a new design to the market in half the time and cost. 
Every product has a market window. Missing the early part of the product 
window has a major impact on the business. Not only does the company 
lose a lot of sales opportunities, but it is facing an uphill battle against an 
already established competitor. With the importance of meeting product 
windows, you would think that development schedules would always be 
met. Actually, few development projects adhere to their original schedule.
Applications of Cycle Time Analysis and Reduction
The object of this activity is to reduce cycle time. This is accomplished 
by focusing the Process Improvement Team’s attention on activities with 

248  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
long time cycles and those activities that slow down the process. The 
timeline flowchart provides valuable assistance in identifying the prob­
lem activities. The team should look at the present process to determine 
why schedules and commitments are missed, then reestablish priorities to 
eliminate these slippages, and then look for ways to reduce the total cycle 
time. Typical ways to reduce cycle time are:
• Do activities in parallel rather than serially. Often, activities that were 
done serially can be done in parallel, reducing the cycle time by as 
much as 80%. Engineering change review is a good example. In the 
old process, the change folder went to manufacturing engineering, 
then to manufacturing, then to field services, then to purchasing, and 
finally, to quality assurance for review and sign-off. It took an average 
of 2 days to do the review in each area and 1 additional day to trans­
port the document to the next reviewer. The engineering change cycle 
took 15 working days, or 3 weeks, to complete. If any of the reviewers 
had a question that resulted in a change to the document, the process 
was repeated. By using computer-aided design (CAD), all parties can 
review the document simultaneously and eliminate the transportation 
time. This parallel review reduces the cycle time to 2 days.
	
	
Another less equipment-intensive approach would be to hold 
weekly change meetings. This would reduce the average time cycle to 
3.5 days and eliminate most of the recycling, because the questions 
would be resolved during the meeting.
• Change activity sequence. The geographic flowchart is a big help to 
this activity. Often, output moves to one building and then returns 
to the original building. Documents move back and forth between 
departments within the same building. In this stage, the sequence of 
activities is examined to determine whether a change would reduce 
cycle time. Is it possible to get all the signatures from the same build­
ing before the document is moved to another location? When a doc­
ument is put on hold waiting for additional data, is there anyone else 
who could be using the document, thereby saving cycle time later on?
• Reduce interruption. The critical business process activities should 
get priority. Often less important interruptions delay them. People 
working on critical business processes should not be located in high 
traffic areas, such as near the coffee machine. Someone else should 
answer their phones. The office layout should allow them to leave 
their work out during breaks, lunch, or at day’s end. The employee 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  249
and the manager should agree on a time when the employee will 
work uninterrupted, and the manager should help keep these hours 
sacred.
• Improve timing. Analyze how the output is used to see how cycle 
time can be reduced. If the mail pickup is at 10:00 a.m., all outgoing 
mail should be processed before 9:45 a.m. If the computer processes 
a weekly report at 10:00 p.m. on Thursday, be sure that all Thursday 
first-shift data are input by 8:00 p.m. If you miss the report analy­
sis window, you may have to wait 7 more days before you receive an 
accurate report. If a manager reads mail after work, be sure that all of 
that day’s mail is in his or her incoming box by 4:30 p.m. It will save 
24 hours in the total cycle time. Proper timing can save many days in 
total cycle time.
• Reduce output movement. Are the files close to the accountants? 
Does the secretary have to get up to put a letter in the mailbox? Are 
employees who work together located together? For example, are the 
quality, development, and manufacturing engineers located side by 
side when they are working on the same project, or are they located 
close to other people in the same discipline?
• Analyze locations. Is the process being performed in the right build­
ing, city, state, or even the right country? Where the activity is per­
formed physically can have a major impact on many factors. Among 
them are:
• Cycle time
• Labor cost
• Customer relations
• Government controls and regulations
• Transportation cost
• Employee skill levels
	
	
Performing the activity in less than the optimum location can 
cause problems, from a minor inconvenience all the way to losing 
customers and valuable employees. The approach and consideration 
for selecting the optimum location vary greatly from process to 
process. As a general rule, the closer the process is located to the 
customer, the better. The restraints to having the process and its cus­
tomer in close proximity are economy of scale, stocking costs, equip­
ment costs, and utilization considerations. With today’s advances in 
communication and computer systems, the trend is to go to many 
smaller locations located either close to the supplier or close to the 

250  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
customers. Even the large manufacturing specialty departments 
(machine shop, welding department, tool room, etc.) are being 
separated into small work cells that are organized to fit a process in 
which a lot size of one is the production plan. Often, the advantages 
of quick response to customer requests, increased turns per year, and 
decreased inventories far offset the decreased utilization costs.
	
	
Questions like “Should we have a centralized service department 
or many remote ones?” require very careful analysis. A graphic 
flowchart helps make these decisions, but the final decision must be 
based on a detailed understanding of customer expectations, cus­
tomer impact, and cost comparisons between the options.
• Set priorities. Management must set proper priorities, communicate 
them to employees, and then follow up to ensure that these priori­
ties are lived up to. It is often a big temptation to first complete the 
simple little jobs⎯the ones that a friend wants worked on, the ones 
someone called about⎯and let the important ones slip. It’s the old 
“squeaky wheel” message. As a result, projects slip, money is lost, 
and other activities are delayed. Set priorities and live by them.
Cycle Time Analysis and Reduction Process
The cycle time reduction process consists of 16 activities:
	
1.	Flowchart the process that is being studied.
	
2.	Conduct a process walk-through to understand the process and ver­
ify the flowchart.
	
3.	Collect cycle time data related to each activity and task. It is often 
advisable to collect minimum and maximum cycle times in addition 
to average. This is necessary because, typically, an organization loses 
customers not over averages but over worst-case conditions.
	
4.	Collect data that define the quantity flow through each leg of the 
flow diagram.
	
5.	Construct a simulation model that includes all of the data that have 
been collected.
	
6.	Perform a Monte-Carlo analysis using the simulation model to 
define the cycle time frequency distribution.
	
7.	Classify each activity or task as real-value-added, business-value-
added, or no-value-added. Eliminate as many of the business-value-
added and no-value-added activities as possible.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  251
	
8.	Define the average cycle time’s critical path through the process 
using the simulation model.
	
9.	Using the cycle time reduction principles, eliminate the critical path.
	 10.	Repeat activities 8 and 9 until the minimum cycle time is obtained.
	 11.	Define the worst-case critical path through the process using the

	 12.	Using the cycle time reduction principles, eliminate the critical path.
	 13.	Repeat steps 11 and 12 until the minimum worst-case cycle time 
is obtained.
	 14.	Develop a plan to change the process to be in line with the modified 
simulation model.
	 15.	Pilot the modifications as appropriate.
	 16.	Implement the new process.
Examples
IBM’s RPQ or special bit process provides modifications to computers so 
that they can meet an individual customer’s unique needs. Typically, the 
cycle time to take a customer special requirement and design and price out 
the modification was taking an average of 90 days. The business was very 
profitable, as 20% of the bids were closed. IBM decided that 90 days was 
too long and a team was put together to reduce the cycle time. As a result, 
24 months later, any place in the world, it took an average of 15 days to 
complete a special bid process.
In addition, the cost related to preparing the bid was decreased by 30%, 
but that was not the big payoff. Along with the quick response to cus­
tomer requests, the bit closure rate jumped from 20% to 65%—a 325% 
improvement. Customers love companies who respond quickly to their 
special requests.

FAST-ACTION SOLUTION TECHNIQUE (FAST)
Start your improvement process with some quick wins to get top manage­
ment’s ongoing support.
Definition
FAST is a breakthrough approach that focuses a group’s attention on 
a single process for a 1- or 2-day meeting to define how the group can 
improve the process over the next 90 days. Before the end of the meet­
ing, management approves or rejects the proposed improvements.
Pick Low Hanging Fruit
Just the Facts
Fast-action solution technique (FAST) is based on an improvement tool 
first used by International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation in 
the mid-1980s. General Electric refined this approach in the 1990s and 
called it “workout.” Ford Motor Company further developed it under the 
title “RAPID.” Today, Cap Gemini Ernst & Young extensively uses this 
approach (which they call “EXPRESS”) with many clients around the 
world (Figure 7.9). It is also often used by other organizations throughout 
the Americas.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  253
FAST can be applied to any process level, from a major process down to 
and including the activity level. The FAST approach to business process 
improvement (BPI) centers around a single 1- or 2-day meeting that identi­
fies root causes of problems and/or no-value-added activities designed into 
a present process. Typical improvement results from the FAST approach are 
reduced cost, cycle time, and error rates between 5 and 15% in a 3-month 
time period. Within 1 or 2 days, the potential improvements are identified 
and approved for implementation; hence the term FAST was given to this 
approach.
	
The FAST approach evolves through the following eight activities:
	
1.	A problem or process is identified as a candidate for FAST.
	
2.	A high-level sponsor agrees to support the FAST initiative related to 
the process that will be improved. (The process must be under the 
sponsor’s span of control.)
	
3.	The FAST team is assigned, and a set of objectives is prepared and 
approved by the sponsor.
	
4.	The FAST team meets for 1 or 2 days to develop a high-level pro­
cess flowchart and to define what actions could be taken to improve 
the process’s performance. All recommendations must be within 
the span of control of the team members and able to be completely 
implemented within a 3-month time period. All other recommenda­
tions are submitted to the sponsor for further consideration at a later 
date.
	
5.	A FAST team member must agree to be responsible for imple­
menting each recommendation that will be submitted to the 
sponsor.

6.	At the end of the 1- or 2-day meeting, the sponsor attends a meeting 
at which the FAST team presents its findings.

FOUNDATION OF SIX SIGMA (MINIMIZING VARIATION)
All knowledge is based on analysis of measurement data.
Definition
The fundamental concept that Six Sigma is based upon is by reduc­
ing variation, the organization has a higher probability of meeting or 
exceeding customer requirements.
Just the Facts
The Six Sigma focus is on minimizing variation, and it is represented by 
the formula where y is the dependent variable and f is the independent 
variable. (See Table 7.11.)

What Does “Good Enough” Mean?
Is 99% good enough? Good enough isn’t any of the following:
• 10 million lost articles of mail each day
• 5,000 surgeries each day performed incorrectly
• 200,000 incorrect drug prescriptions dispensed each year
• At least two missed landings at most major airports each day
A good process is one that will repeatedly and reliably produce excellent 
service and products. Does it have to be perfect? Can any of us perform 
error-free for the rest of our lives? Would 3.4 errors for million opportuni­
ties be good enough? That is the objective of the Six Sigma methodology. 
(See Figures 7.10 to 7.12.)
Six Sigma is about variation reduction. It is concerned about the process 
variation that, when depicted on a histogram, forms its width called “common 
cause variation,” and the external variation called “special cause variation.”
Example
A process is yielding 50% good parts. An analysis of the data shows that 
the process is producing product that is out of specification for both the 
high and low specification limits. A further evaluation shows that 30% of

the bad product is above the upper specification limits. You will reduce the 
failure rate from 50% to 30% by simply moving the center of the process 
toward the center of the specification limits. A further reduction of only 
10% of the variation of the process will yield an additional 15%, thereby 
reducing the defect rate from 50% to 15%.

JUST-IN-TIME (JIT)
When your product is not moving, it is costing you money.
Definition
Just-in-time (JIT) is a strategy to reduce costs by reducing in-process 
inventory and associated carrying costs. The just-in-time production 
method is also referred to as the Toyota Production System.
Just the Facts
The JIT process relies on signals between different points in the process 
that tell production when to make the next part. This usually takes the 
form of “tickets” but can be simple visual signals, such as the presence or 
absence of a part on a shelf.
When correctly implemented, JIT focuses on continuous improvement 
and can improve a manufacturing organization’s quality and efficiency.
Key areas include:
	
1.	Flow
	
2.	Employee involvement
	
3.	Quality
	
4.	Environmental concerns
	
5.	Price volatility
	
6.	Demand
	
7.	Supply availability
Example
Instead of storing empty bottles, a drink manufacturer has empty bottles 
delivered at regular times providing a 4-hour operating window between 
deliveries. This allows for the following:

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  259
• The need to move the bottles from the trailers to storage is reduced.
• Bottles are moved directly to production.
• The supplier knows the production rate required to satisfy the customer.
By producing product to customer demands, it reduces warehouse stor­
age costs.
Having necessary parts available when needed and ordering just enough to 
keep the process moving with no downtime reduces the inventory of parts that 
must be maintained. This reduces the within-period costs and storage costs. This 
also facilitates suppliers in that they can provide parts at a more constant level 
rather than providing more parts than necessary and then having downtime.
Some of the benefits include:
• Reduced setup time
• Flow of goods from warehouse to shelves improves
• Employees with multiple skills are used more efficiently
• Production scheduling and work hour consistency synchronized 
with demand
• Increased emphasis on supplier relationships
• Supplies come in at regular intervals throughout the production day

MATRIX DIAGRAM/DECISION MATRIX
Sometimes you need a way to select the right alternative.

260  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Definition
Matrix diagram/decision matrix is a systematic way of selecting from 
larger lists of alternatives. They can be used to select a problem from a 
list of potential problems, select primary root causes from a larger list, 
or select a solution from a list of alternatives.
Just the Facts
The matrix diagram is an approach that assists in the investigation of rela­
tionships. While there are many variations of matrix diagrams, the most 
commonly used is the decision, or prioritization, matrix. These come in 
two basic formats: the L-Shaped Matrix and the T-Shaped Matrix.
L-Shaped Matrix
We will start by showing a relatively simple L-Shaped Matrix that com­
pares two sets of information. (See Figure 7.13.)
As you can see from the example, we are comparing several automobile 
dealers (our choices) with a predetermined set of decision criteria. Now all 
that remains is to determine which type of ranking method we will use. 
There are four basic types of ranking methods:
	
1.	Forced choice: Each alternative is ranked in relation to the others. 
The alternative best meeting the criteria gets a score equal to the 
number of alternatives. Since we have five dealers in our example, 
the worst would get a 1 and the best a 5.

2.	Rating scale: Each alternative is rated independently against an 
objective standard. (For example, a 1 to 10 scale would have 1 = very 
low (does not meet the standard at all) and 10 = perfect (absolutely 
meets the standard).
	
3.	Objective data: Here we enter actual data, rather than the opinions of 
the individual(s) doing the ranking.
	
4.	Yes/no: If the criteria are expressed in absolute terms, so an alterna­
tive either meets the criteria or not, a Y for yes or an N for no may be 
entered to indicate conformance or nonconformance.
Figure  7.14 shows our automobile dealership example using the 
simple yes/no ranking criteria. As you can see, the easiest ranking 
method—the yes/no approach—often leaves the user with little infor­
mation in which to make a decision. In Figure 7.14 all five dealers got 
three yeses.
Let’s try ranking our choices using the forced-choice method. (See 
Figure 7.15.) Remember, this method ranks each alternative in relation to 
the others. In this case the dealer meeting our criteria the best will get a 5 
and the worst will get a 1 (since we have five choices).
Now we have information that might allow us to make a decision. As you 
can see, Dealer 4 scored the highest with 18. Does this mean you should 
automatically buy your car from him? Not necessarily. Although Dealer 
4 did score the highest overall, he scored the lowest on “free dropoff and

pickup.” If this were a critical element to the potential buyer, he or she 
might want to consider the second choice, Dealer 1.
This is where using the objective data method might be of assistance. 
The person or group doing the ranking might even consider using a com­
bination of ranking methods. This is certainly an option, but it makes the 
final selection a bit more complex.
T-Shaped Matrix
The second format we mentioned was the T-Shaped Matrix. While the 
L-Shaped Matrix compares two sets of information, the T-Shaped Matrix 
compares two sets of information to a third. An example of this could be 
a corporation’s training program. We could compare the type of training 
available with departments that need the training and training provid­
ers. Figure 7.16 shows an example of the T-Shaped Matrix format.
There are many approaches to designing and developing a matrix dia­
gram. Listed below are five steps you may find useful in developing a 
matrix diagram that’s just right for your purpose.
Step 1: Determine the task. Are we looking at two elements or three? 
What should the desired outcome look like? Is the matrix to be used 
a problem-solving tool or a planning graph? Is it a stand-alone tool 
that leads us to action, or will we use it in conjunction with other 
tools, such as a tree diagram or relation diagram?

Step 2: Select the matrix format. If we are reviewing the relationships of 
two elements, you may want to use the L-Shaped Matrix. If you add a 
third element, you will want to use the T-Shaped Matrix.
Step 3: Determine the criteria for evaluating alternatives. A typical list 
of criteria is presented below:
• Customer impact
• Number of customers affected
• Within control of the team
• Within influence of the team
• Cost of quality
• Rework
• Frequency of occurrence
• Cycle time impact
• Revenue impact
• Return on investment
• Complexity of analysis

• Time to develop a solution
• Durability of solution
• Cost to implement solution
• Availability of measurements
	
	
The criteria should be worded in terms of the ideal result, not 
worded neutrally. For example, a criterion could be “easy to imple­
ment,” but not “ease of implementation.”
Step 4: Determine the weights for the individual criterion or use equal 
weighting.
Step 5: Determine how the individual alternatives will be ranked.
• Forced choice: Each alternative is ranked in relation to the 
others. The alternative best meeting the criterion gets a score 
equal to the number of alternatives and the worst would get a 1.
• Rating scale: Each alternative is rated independently against 
an objective standard. For example, a 1 to 10 scale would have 
1 = very low (does not meet the standard at all) and 10 = perfect 
(absolutely meets the standard).
• Objective data: Enter actual data, rather than the opinions of the 
individual(s) doing the ranking.
• Yes/no: If the criteria are expressed in absolute terms, so an alter­
native either meets the criterion or not, simply enter Y or N to 
indicate conformance or nonconformance.
Step 6: Review the results and take action as required.
Guidelines and Tips
Whenever comparing alternatives (forced-choice method or rating scale), 
the group must agree on the relative importance of the alternatives/cri­
teria for scoring purposes. Relative importance can be established either 
through consensus discussion or through voting techniques. You will 
usually want to reach agreement rather quickly on this. The amount of 
time you spend should be based on the importance of the problem/solu­
tion and on the number of alternatives and criteria. If there are a large 
number of alternatives/criteria, you can reach agreement more quickly 
keeping in mind the impact of each individual item on the list is smaller.
Depending on the nature and impact of the problem, this process can 
be simplified for quicker and easier use. For example, the process can 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  265
be simplified by assuming that the criteria are of equal importance, and 
therefore the ranking of alternatives can be skipped. You can look for 
other simplifying assumptions. Just be aware of their impact on results.
There is no one best way to weight criteria or alternatives. In the 
forced-choice method, you rate each element against the other, based 
on the number of choices. This is a time-consuming method, though. 
The rating scale method is quick, but has the drawback that people 
tend to rank every criterion as very important or high on the scale of 1 
through 10.
Again, there is no one best method. Use the method that provides 
you with the most information. Before using any of the alternative 
approaches described here, however, think about the implications of the 
various schemes. If you plan to use prioritization matrices repeatedly, 
you might set up a simple spreadsheet to assist you with some of the 
calculations.

MEASUREMENTS
One measurement is worth 10 guesses.

266  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Definition
A measurement describes the dimension, quantity, capacity, perfor­
mance, or characteristic of a process or population.
Just the Facts
There are many tools that provide measurement data that, when analyzed 
properly, yield “actionable knowledge” (indicate the direction of action to 
be taken). Some of the key actions and tools include:
• Investigate history data archives
• Statistical process control
• Check sheets
• Process capability
• Paper files
• Histograms
• Functional experts
• Standard run chart graphs
• Data collection plans
• Scatter diagrams
• Sampling
• Box plots
• Lean metrics
• Basic descriptive statistics
• Sampling plans
• Process mapping
• Theory of constraints (TOC)
• Pace maker identification
• Taguchi loss function
• Spaghetti charts
• Tree diagrams
• Basic and advanced charting
Principles of Good Measure
The following is a list of criteria to use in evaluating measurement:
• The measure must be important.
• The measure must be easy to understand.
• The measure is sensitive to the right things and insensitive to 
other things.
• The measure promotes appropriate analysis and action.
• Data needed must be easy to collect.
Examples
In preparing the measurement system start thinking in scientific terms:
	
Y = f(X1, X2, …, Xn)

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (A through M)  •  267
• Y relates to the outputs.
• X relates to the process and inputs.
• Identify X’s that might explain variation in the output measure.
• Collect data efficiently—both the Y’s and the suspected X’s.
The focus of the measure activity is to:
• Select key output measures (Y metrics)
• Collect baseline data (X performance metrics)
• Study the variation in the output measures (X process measures)
• Understand the capability of our process (6s)
Quality Measurement
• Effectiveness measures: The degree to which customer needs and 
requirements are met and exceeded. Some examples include the 
following:
• Percent defective
• Response time
• Efficiency measures: The amount of resources allocated in meeting 
and exceeding customer requirements. Some examples include the 
following:
• Cost per transaction
• Turnaround time
• Time per activity
• Amount of rework

ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT (OCM)
Research confirms that as much as 60% of initiatives and other projects fail as 
a direct result of a fundamental inability to manager their social implications.
—Gartner Group
Definition
Organizational change management (OCM) is a methodology designed 
to lessen the stress and resistance of employees and management to 
individual critical changes.
Just the Facts
Organizations today are in a continuous state of change. In the past, individuals 
were called upon once in a while to adjust and change their work patterns and 
then had time to master this new process. Today things are changing so fast we 
seldom become comfortable with one change in the way we do business before 
it has been changed again. There literally are hundreds of change activities 

270  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
going on in all organizations at the same time, and many individuals are 
impacted by a number of different processes that are changing simultaneously.
We like to think that the people in our organization are resilient and can 
handle this rapidly changing environment without additional help. The 
truth is that everyone is for change as long it does not impact him or her. But 
when the change becomes personal, everyone is subjected to the four C’s:
• Comfort: Their comfort level has been destroyed.
• Confidence: They lose confidence in their ability to meet the require­
ments in the future state solution.
• Competence: They are not sure if they will have the skills required to per­
form. They are no longer the individuals that know the most about the job.
• Control: They have lost control over their own destiny. Someone else 
is defining what they will do and how they will do it.
As a result of the disruption of the four C’s, the individuals and groups 
within the organization suffer some severe emotional changes. The stress 
level within the organization goes way up as people worry about the future. 
Productivity declines because people spend excessive amounts of time dis­
cussing what’s going to happen to them and how it is going to impact them. 
Anxiety levels increase as the uncertainty of the future state remains unclear 
and the individuals begin to fear loss of security. This results in a great deal 
of increased conflict between groups and individuals. An attitude develops 
of “What’s wrong with the future state solution,” rather than “How can we 
help to implement the future state solution?” Everyone is most comfortable 
and happiest in their current state (status quo). Human beings are extremely 
control-oriented. We feel the most competent, confident, and comfortable 
when our expectations of control, stability, and predictability are being met.
Definition
Change is a condition in which your expectations based upon past per­
formance are not met. A condition in which you can no longer rely 
upon your past experience.
We resist change because we don’t know if we will be able to prosper or 
even survive in the new environment. Organizational change management 
(OCM) is a methodology designed to successfully manage the change process. 
Today, managers at all levels of the organization must have the ability and 
willingness to deal with the tough issues associated with implementing major

change. They must be capable of guiding their organization safely through the 
change process. This involves convincing people to leave the comfort of the 
current state and move through the turbulence of the transition state to arrive 
at what may be an unclear, distant future state. (See Figure 8.1.)
Specifically, these four states are defined as:
• Current state: The status quo, or the established pattern of expec­
tations. The normal routine an organization follows before imple­
menting an improvement opportunity.
• Present state: The condition where you know and understand what 
will happen, when your expectations are being met. (You may not 
like the current state, but you have learned how to survive in it and 
you know what to expect.)
• Transition state: The point in the change process where people break 
away from the status quo. They no longer behave as they have in the 
past, yet they have not thoroughly established a new way of operating.
• Future state: The point at which change initiatives are implemented and 
integrated with the behavioral patterns that are required by the change.
The focus of the OCM implementation methodology is on the transfor­
mation between these various states. The journey from the current state 
to the future state can be long and perilous, and if not properly managed 
with appropriate strategies and tactics, it can be disastrous.
There are literally hundreds of changes going on within your organiza­
tion all the time, and the OCM methodology should not be applied to 
all of them. You need to look very carefully at the changes and select the 
ones that should be managed. Typical changes that should have the OCM 
methodology applied to them are:
• When the change is a major change
• When there is a high risk that certain human factors would result in 
implementation failure

272  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
In most organizations there are critical, major, and minor changes. 
Certainly all of the critical changes as well as most major changes should 
use this methodology. Few of the minor changes will require the disci­
pline involved in the organizational change management methodology.
Seven Phases of OCM
Phase I: Defining Current State Pain
The individuals involved in the change need to feel enough heat related to 
their present situation to make them want to leave the security of the sta­
tus quo and move into the uncertainty in the transformation part (transi­
tion phase) of the change management process. Management may reason 
that the employees have an excellent understanding of the pain related 
to the status quo, and that is probably true related to the current situa­
tion, but they have little understanding of the lost opportunities that will 
impact them and the organization if the change does not take place. As a 
result, management needs to surface the pain related to lost opportunities.
The pain related to the current state must be great enough to get the employ­
ees to consider leaving the safety of the current state platform and move on 
to the transformation phase. The highlighting of pain is called “establishing 
the burning platform.” This term comes from an oil rig that was on fire in 
the North Sea. The platform got so hot that the workers jumped off the rig 
into the sea because they realized that their chances of survival were better 
in the cold North Sea than on the burning oil rig platform.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  273
Phase II: Establishing a Clear Vision of the Future State Solution
Employees are going to weigh the pain related to the present situation and 
compare it to the pain they will undergo during the transformation and 
the pain related to the future state solution. (Note: Your employees are 
smart enough to realize that there will always be some pain in using even 
the very best future state solution.) As a result, management needs to pro­
vide the employees with an excellent vision of the future state solution and 
its impact upon them so they can compare the pain of the current state 
to the combined pain of the transformation state and future state. If the 
pain related to the current state is not greater than their view of the pain 
related to the transition state and future state combined, the change can 
only be implemented over the objections of the employees, and there is a 
high likelihood that it will not be successfully implemented. The vision has 
to crisply define:
• Why is the change necessary?
• What’s in it for me?
• Why is it important to the organization?
Phases I and II are often called pain management.
Phase III: Defining Change Roles
The roles of the individuals involved in the change must be clearly defined. 
These roles are divided into five general categories:
• Initiating sponsor: Individual/group that has the power to initiate 
and legitimize the change for all of the affected individuals.
• Sustaining sponsor: Individual/group that has the necessary politi­
cal, logistical, and economic proximity to the targets to influence 
their behavior.
• Change agent: Individual/group that is responsible for implement­
ing the change management aspects of the project.
• Change target (sometimes called a “changee”): Individual/group 
that must actually change.
• Advocate: An individual/group that wants to achieve change but 
does not have sufficient sponsorship.

274  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Each person needs to be trained in his or her duties related to his or her 
change management role.
Phase IV: Mapping Change Roles
A change role map should be prepared identifying each individual’s role 
related to the change. (Note: This is a concept developed by Daryl Conner 
of ODR.) This map generates a visual picture of the individuals, groups, 
and relationships that must be orchestrated to achieve the change. It is 
important to note that one individual can serve many roles. For example, 
every sustaining sponsor is first a target or “change” before he or she can 
accept the role as a sustaining sponsor. (See Figure 8.2).
Phase V: Defining the Degree of Change Required
The communications system and the change management plan must be 
designed so that the proper degree of acceptance of the change initiative is

accomplished. There is a great deal of difficulty and effort required to have 
a change internalized in comparison to just having it adopted. For example, 
there is much less change management required to have a new computer 
program standardized for use throughout the organization than there is to 
have the same software package accepted by the individuals as being the 
very best alternative. Typically, degrees of acceptance can be broken down 
into:
• Adoption: The change has been fully implemented, the new practice 
is being followed consistently, and its objectives are being met. “We 
are doing it this way.”
• Institutionalization: The change has not only been adopted, but is 
formalized in written policies, practices, and procedures. The orga­
nizational infrastructure (hiring, training, performance measures, 
rewards, etc.) is aligned to support continued conformance to the 
new practice. “We always do it this way.”
• Internalization: The new practice is understood to be fully aligned with 
individual and organizational beliefs, values, and norms of behavior, 
and as such, commitment to sustain the practice comes from within. 
“Of course we always do it this way. I believe in doing it this way, and 
to do otherwise would be inconsistent with the way we like to do things 
here.”
Phase VI: Developing the Organizational Change Management Plan
Any planning activity involves thinking out in advance the sequence of 
actions required to accomplish a predefined objective. A change man­
agement plan is now prepared to meet the degree of acceptance that is 
required to support the project.
Now the change management plan needs to be integrated into the 
project management plan. This normally is a timeline chart that reflects 
the movement throughout the change management process. (See 
Figure 8.3.) The change management plan should also include any risk 
related to internal or external events, such as the following:
• Competing initiatives
• Too many initiatives
• Loss of sponsorship

Phase VII: Implementing the Change Management Plan
The OCM plan is now implemented in conjunction with the project plan. 
Usually a number of surveys are conducted to help refine the OCM plan. 
Typical surveys or evaluations that could be conducted are:
• Implementation architecture assessment
• Internal/external event assessment
• Vision clarity assessment
• Commitment versus compliance change management
• Strategy analysis
• Predicting the impact of the change
• Organizational effectiveness
• Business imperative analysis
• Sponsor evaluation
• Implementation history assessment

It is evident from Figure 8.3 that a number of change management activi­
ties are iterative and not confined to the QMS phase. (See also Figure 8.4.)

PARETO DIAGRAMS
As good as you are, you can’t do everything. So do the ones with the big 
pay-back first.
Definition
A Pareto diagram is a type of chart in which the bars are arranged in 
descending order from the left to the right. It is a way to highlight the 
“vital few” in contrast to the “trivial many.”

280  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Just the Facts
A Pareto diagram is a specialized type of column graph. Data are pre­
sented in a manner that allows comparison between a number of prob­
lems or a number of causes. The comparison is necessary to set priorities. 
The Pareto diagram facilitates the process by graphically distinguishing 
the few significant problems or causes from the less significant many. 
This diagram is the graphic representation of the Pareto principle.
The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
The Pareto principle states as a “universal,” applicable to many fields, the 
phenomenon of the vital few and the trivial many. In our context, this 
means that a few significant problems or causes will be most important to 
our decision-making process.
This principle derives its name from Vilfredo Pareto, a 19th-century 
economist who applied the concept to income distribution. His observa­
tions led him to state that 80% of wealth is controlled by 20% of the people. 
(Hence, the principle is often referred to as the 80-20 principle.) The name 
Pareto and the universal applicability of the concept are credited to Dr. Joe 
M. Juran, who applied the Lorenz curve to graphically depict the universal.
The Pareto diagram is distinguished from other column graphs in that 
the columns representing each category are always ordered from the 
highest on the left to the lowest on the right. (See Figure 8.5.) The one 
exception to this rule is the “Other” column, a collection of less important 
factors. When it is used, it is always the last column on the right. With this 
arrangement it is possible to make a cumulative or “cum” line (the Lorenz 
curve), which rises by steps according to the height of the columns to show 
the total of the percentages, the cumulative percentage. With the cum line, 
the Pareto diagram becomes a combined column and line graph.
Uses of Pareto Diagrams
Like other graphic representations, Pareto diagrams visualize data to 
assist investigation and analysis. They are employed to:
• Establish priorities: By a comparison of related data, major catego­
ries of problems and causes are identified.
• Show percentage of impact: The cum line defines the proportionate 
importance of combined categories, and thus indicates the likely impact 
of dealing with all of the categories up to that point in the diagram.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  281
• Show change over time: Two or more diagrams can be used to dem­
onstrate the result of decisions and actions by showing before and 
after data. (See Figure 8.6.)
• Aid communication: The diagram is an accepted form of communi­
cation, readily understood.
• Demonstrate use of data: This can be particularly helpful in man­
agement presentations to show the activities are solidly rooted in 
facts, not just opinions.

Classifications of Data
The data collected for transfer to a Pareto diagram are of three major types:
• Problems:  Including errors, defects, locations, processes, procedures.
• Causes:  Including materials, machines, equipment, employees, cus­
tomers, operations, standards.
• Cost:  Of each category of data.
The purpose of using a Pareto diagram is to:
• Establish the biggest problem, and rank the rest
• Establish the most important cause, and rank the rest
“Biggest” and “most important” need to be measured not solely in terms 
of frequency but also in terms of cost. The number of occurrences may not 
be as significant as the cost of particular occurrences. Consequently, it is 
usually important to construct a Pareto diagram using cost data. Mere 
frequency can be misleading in judging significance.
Constructing a Pareto Diagram
Before a Pareto diagram can be constructed, it is necessary to collect data 
according to the classifications or categories judged most suitable. With 
these data the diagram is constructed as follows:
Step 1: Summarize the data on a worksheet by:
	
a.	 Arranging the data in order of sequence from largest to smallest 
and total them. (See Table 8.1, “Number” column.)

b.	 Calculating percentages (See Table 8.1, “% of Total” column.)
	
c.	 Completing the cumulative percent column. (See Table 8.1, “Cum 
%” column.)
Step 2: Draw the horizontal and two vertical axes:
	
a.	 Divide the horizontal axis into equal segments, one for each cat­
egory. (See Figure 8.7.)
	
b.	 Scale the left-hand vertical axis so that the top figure on the axis 
is the total of all the occurrences in the categories.
	
c.	 Scale the right-hand vertical axis so that 100% is directly oppo­
site the total on the left-hand axis. The percent scale is normally 
in increments of 10%.
Step 3: Plot the data. Construct a series of columns, putting the tall­
est column on the extreme left, then the next tallest, and so on. If 
several minor categories are consolidated into one “Other” col­
umn, it is plotted on the extreme right, regardless of its height. (See 
Figure 8.8.)
Step 4: Plot the cumulative line:
	
a.	 Place a dot in line with the right side of each column, at a height 
corresponding to the number in the cumulative percentage col­
umn on the worksheet. In our example, the points would be at 
40, 64, 75, 85, and 91%.

PRIORITIZATION MATRIX
People who don’t prioritize work hard but accomplish little.
Definition
The prioritization matrix, also known as the criteria matrix, com­
pares alternatives related to different criteria, such as ease of use, price, 
service, and any other criterion that is desired to be included in the 
matrix. It sorts criteria into an order of importance.

Just the Facts
The matrix is used to prioritize complex or unclear issues, where there 
are several criteria for deciding importance. It requires actual data to aid 
in establishing the criteria. The matrix helps to reduce the list of possible 
causes and solutions.
The prioritization matrix is a tool for sorting a set of criteria by order of 
importance. It is also valuable in identifying each in terms of their rela­
tive importance by assigning a numerical value to the importance of each 
criteria—the larger the number, the more important the criteria.
Example
Each criterion is evaluated against each of a set of key criteria. The scores 
for each criterion are then summed to come up with a total score.
A good criterion reflects key goals and enables objective measure­
ments to be made. Thus, material cost is measurable and reflects a 
business profit goal, while simplicity may not reflect any goals and be 
difficult to score.
When there are multiple criteria, it may also be important to take into 
account the fact that some criteria are more important than others. This 
can be implemented by allocating weighting values to each criterion. 
Figure 8.11 displays a simple matrix.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT (PM)
Processes define how we operate. Projects are the way we improve processes.
Definition
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and 
techniques to project activities in order to meet or exceed stakeholders’ 
needs and expectations from a project (Project Management Institute 
Standards Committee, 1996).
Just the Facts
Performance improvement occurs mainly from a number of large and small 
projects that are undertaken by the organization. These projects involve all 
levels within the organization and can take less than 100 hours or millions 
of hours to complete. They are a critical part of the way an organization’s 
business strategies are implemented. It is extremely important that these 
multitudes of projects are managed effectively if the stakeholder’s needs 
and expectations are to be met. This is made more complex because con­
flicting demands are often placed upon the project. For example:
• Scope
• Time
• Cost
• Quality
• Stakeholders with different identified (needs) and unidentified 
(expectations) requirements
The different stakeholders often place conflicting requirements on a sin­
gle project. For example, management wants the project to reduce labor 
cost by 80% and organized labor wants it to create more jobs.

288  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
The Project Management Institute in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, is 
the leader in defining the body of knowledge for project management. Its 
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) approach to project 
management has been widely accepted throughout the world. In addition, 
the International Organization for Standardization’s Technical Committee 
176 has released an international standard: ISO/DIS 10006: Guidelines to 
Quality in Project Management. These two methodologies complement 
each other and march hand in hand with each other.
• Project: A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique prod­
uct or service.
• Program: A group of related projects managed in a coordinated way. 
Programs usually include an element of ongoing activities.
Large projects are often managed by professional project managers who 
have no other assignments. However, in most organizations, individuals 
who serve as project manager only a small percentage of the time manage 
many projects. In either case, the individual project manager is respon­
sible for defining a process by which a project is initiated, controlled, and 
brought to a successful conclusion. This requires the following:
• Project completed on time
• Project completed in budget
• Outputs met specification
• Customers are satisfied
• Team members gain satisfaction as a result of the project
A good project manager follows General George S. Patton’s advice when 
he said, “Don’t tell soldiers how to do something. Tell them what to do and 
you will be amazed at their ingenuity.” Although a single project life cycle 
is very difficult to get everyone to agree to, the project life cycle defined in 
U.S. DOD’s document 5000.2 (Revision 2-26-92, entitled “Representative 
Life Cycle for Defense Acquisition”) provides a reasonably good starting 
point. It is divided into five phases (see Table 8.2).
The following is a life cycle that we like better for an organization that is 
providing a product and service (see Figure 8.12):
• Phase I: Concept and definition
• Phase II: Design and development

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  289
• Phase III: Creating the product or service
• Phase IV: Installation
• Phase V: Operating and maintenance
• Phase VI: Disposal
Traditionally, projects have followed a pattern of phases from concept 
to termination. Each phase has particular characteristics that distinguish 
it from the other phases. Each phase forms part of a logical sequence in 
which the fundamental and technical specification of the end product or 
service is progressively defined. Figure 8.13 is the project management life 
cycle. Figure 8.14 shows the project phase gates for a typical new product 
development cycle.
The successful project manager understands that there are four key fac­
tors that have to be considered when the project plan is developed. All four

Project Management Knowledge Areas
The book A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, pub­
lished by the Project Management Institute, summarizes the project man­
agement knowledge areas as follows.
Project Integration Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes required 
to ensure that the various elements of the project are properly coordinated. 
It consists of:
• Project plan development: Taking the results of other planning pro­
cesses and putting them into a consistent, coherent document.
• Project plan execution: Carrying out the project plan by performing 
the activities included therein.
• Overall change control: Coordinating changes across the entire project.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  295
Project Scope Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes needed 
to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work 
required, to complete the project successfully. It consists of:
• Initiation: Committing the organization to begin the next phase of 
the project.
• Scope planning: Developing a written scope statement as the basis 
for future project decisions.
• Scope definition: Subdividing the major project deliverables into 
smaller, more manageable components.
• Scope verification: Formalizing acceptance of the project scope.
• Scope change control: Controlling changes to project scope.
Project Time Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes required 
to ensure timely completion of the project. It consists of:
• Activity definition: Identifying the specific activities that must be 
performed to produce the various project deliverables.
• Activity sequencing: Identifying and documenting interactivity 
dependencies.
• Activity duration estimating: Estimating the number of work peri­
ods that will be needed to complete individual activities.
• Schedule development: Analyzing activity sequences, activity dura­
tions, and resource requirements to create the project schedule.
• Schedule control: Controlling changes to the project schedule.
Project Cost Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes required 
to ensure that the project is completed within the approved budget. It con­
sists of:
• Resource planning: Determining what resources (people, equip­
ment, materials) and what quantities of each should be used to per­
form project activities.

296  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Cost estimating: Developing an approximation (estimate) of the 
costs of the resources needed to complete project activities.
• Cost budgeting: Allocating the overall cost estimate to individual 
work items.
• Cost control: Controlling changes to the project budget.
Project Quality Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes required 
to ensure that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was under­
taken. It consists of:
• Quality planning: Identifying which quality standards are relevant 
to the project and determining how to satisfy them.
• Quality assurance: Evaluating overall project performance on a 
regular basis to provide confidence that the project will satisfy the 
relevant quality standards.
• Quality control: Monitoring specific project results to determine if 
they comply with relevant quality standards and identifying ways to 
eliminate causes of unsatisfactory performance.
Project Human Resource Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes required 
to make the most effective use of the people involved with the project. It 
consists of:
• Organizational planning: Identifying, documenting, and assigning 
project roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships.
• Staff acquisition: Getting the human resources needed assigned to 
and working on the project.
• Team development: Developing individual and group skills to 
enhance project performance.
Project Communications Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes required 
to ensure timely and appropriate generation, collection, dissemination, 
storage, and ultimate disposition of project information. It consists of:

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  297
• Communications planning: Determining the information and com­
munications needs of the stakeholders: who needs what information, 
when will they need it, and how it will be given to them.
• Information distribution: Making needed information available to 
project stakeholders in a timely manner.
• Performance reporting: Collecting and disseminating performance 
information. This includes status reporting, progress measurement, 
and forecasting.
• Administrative closure: Generating, gathering, and disseminating 
information to formalize phase or project completion.
Project Risk Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes con­
cerned with identifying, analyzing, and responding to project risk. It con­
sists of:
• Risk identification: Determining which risks are likely to affect the 
project and documenting the characteristics of each.
• Risk quantification: Evaluating risks and risk interactions to assess 
the range of possible project outcomes.
• Risk response development: Defining enhancement steps for oppor­
tunities and responses to threats.
• Risk response control: Responding to changes in risk over the course 
of the project.
Project Procurement Management
This is a subset of project management that includes the processes required 
to acquire goods and services from outside the performing organization. 
It consists of:
• Procurement planning: Determining what to procure and when.
• Solicitation planning: Documenting product requirements and iden­
tifying potential sources.
• Solicitation: Obtaining quotations, bids, offers, or proposals as 
appropriate.
• Source selection: Choosing from among potential sellers.
• Contract administration: Managing the relationship with the seller.

298  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Contract closeout: Completion and settlement of the contract, 
including resolution of any open items.
How OCM Can Help
This is a part of project management that is directed at the people who will 
be impacted by the project. OCM helps prepare the people not to resist 
the change—both those who live in the process that is being changed and 
those who have their work lives changed as a result of the project. In fact, 
OCM has often prepared the employees so well that they look forward to 
the change. (Note: This is not part of the PMBOK project management 
concept.)
• OCM planning: Define the level of resistance to change and prepare 
a plan to offset the resistance.
• Define roles and develop competencies: Identify who will serve as 
sponsors, change agents, change targets, and change advocates. Then, 
train each individual on how to perform the specific role.
• Establish burning platform: Define why the as-is process needs to be 
changed and prepare a vision that defines how the as-is pain will be 
lessened by the future state solution.
• Transformations management: Implement the OCM plan. Test for 
black holes and lack of acceptance. Train affected personnel in new 
skills required by the change.
Estimate Task Effort and Duration
Generally, the more experience someone has in performing a task, the more 
accurate the estimate he or she gives the project manager will be. Many 
variables are used to estimate how much effort (or duration) is needed 
to complete a particular task and how much duration (or elapsed time) 
will be required. These variables include known constraints, assumptions, 
risks, historical information, and resource capabilities. The quality of esti­
mates is dependent on the quality of information and the project life cycle 
phase the project is in.
For example, if a senior programmer leaves the organization and a less 
experienced programmer takes his place, the actual amount of time for a 
programming task might be 25 to 50% higher than originally estimated. 
In that case, unless a contingency was placed aside, the project would run 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  299
over the estimate by the amount indicated. When a person assigned to 
perform a task is known, it’s best to let that person estimate the task with 
the team leader and project manager who review the estimate. There are 
two well-known reasons for this procedure:
• The person performing the task should have the expertise and past 
experience with that type of estimated task and should be able to 
give an educated guess.
• If the person performing the task provides the estimate, he or she 
will have a sense of owning it and will work hard to achieve it.
If you don’t know who will perform the task but people with more 
expertise are working close to the task that needs estimating, it’s wise to 
let these experts prepare the estimate and then add a 25% contingency to 
cover a less experienced person carrying out the task.
Certain tasks are effort driven with no constraints around the dura­
tion. Others are only duration driven. For example, the walls of a house 
not being able to be painted until the sheetrock is taped and textured is 
an effort-driven task. A duration-driven task would be more like painting 
the walls twice: The second coat can’t be completed until the first is dried, 
no matter how many painters the project manager has assigned to the job.
An accepted practice with task duration is the “80-hour rule,” which 
establishes that each individual should have some task due approximately 
every 2 weeks, representing a low-level milestone for him or her to reach. 
The project manager must take all estimates provided by the team mem­
bers and leaders, roll them up, and review the project plan as a whole. 
The intention here is to spot an issue with the overall project schedule by 
examining the proportion of phases within stage(s) or iteration(s).
Develop the Schedule
Once you’ve estimated the time it takes to perform each activity, defined 
each activity’s inputs and outputs, and where each of these inputs come 
from and where each output goes, you can start to develop a project sched­
ule. This defines the start and finish dates for each activity. Many things 
must be considered when developing a schedule. Some of them are:
• Activity duration estimates
• Resource requirements

300  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Resource availability
• Constraints (imposed dates or milestones)
• Assumptions
• Input from other projects
• Transportation delays
• Risk management plans
• Lead and lag times
Although a number of software tools are available that can help you 
develop and optimize a schedule, we’ll discuss a very simple approach 
we’ve found to be effective. We like to start with the output delivery date 
and work backwards. From that point, we place the activity that will deliver 
that output to the customer on the right-hand side of a sheet of paper.
As an example, suppose your consulting firm has just conducted an 
employee-opinion survey for a customer. You’ve returned to your office with 
the survey sheets in hand. The next key delivery to your customer is on May 30, 
when you’ll present the customer-survey results. (See Figure 8.18.) Note that 
May 30 has a boxed-in point representing the deadline for presenting the 
report. Before that can happen, however, the consultant must travel to the 
client’s office 6 hours away, so we include May 29 to complete that step.

Note also that that Saturday and Sunday aren’t listed on the timeline 
axis of the graph in Figure 8.18 because we don’t want to schedule work 
on weekends. This builds in a little safety margin in case things go wrong.
The inputs the consultant needs to present the report are the PowerPoint 
slides he’ll be using and copies of the report and travel arrangements. These 
three inputs are required for the consultant to travel to the client. Note 
that scheduling travel plans occurs on May 4. This is necessary because 
company policy requires consultants to make travel plans at least 2 weeks 
early to ensure minimum fares and best possible connections.
Input necessary to preparing the PowerPoint slides and duplicating the 
report includes having the final report proofread and approved. The latest 
date this can happen is Monday, May 22, because the report masters must 
be taken to the printer on May 23.
The input needed to proofread the report is a completed, typed report. 
Note that the report’s schedule requires that it be completed 5 days before 
it is proofread. The reason for this delay is because the consultant, who has 
written the report, will be on assignment and won’t be available for this 
project during the week of May 15.
Basically, when you create a schedule, you determine when something 
must be delivered and then consider the activities required to deliver that 
output as well as the inputs required to provide the deliverable. Then you 
schedule the inputs and define what’s required to generate them. This pro­
cess is repeated until the schedule is complete.
Put another way, to develop a schedule, you define a deliverable and then 
back up to define what actions are required to produce it, including the 
actions’ duration, the inputs required to provide the output, and any addi­
tional transportation time that’s involved.
The problem with this approach is that often the total cycle time is unac­
ceptably long and the start points have already passed. As an alternative, 
one of the following two techniques is used:
• Crushing: This is an approach in which cost and schedule are ana­
lyzed to determine how to obtain a greater amount of compression 
for the least increase in cost.
• Fast tracking: This is a means of determining if activities that 
would normally be done sequentially can be done in parallel. It also 
evaluates the possibility of assigning two individuals to an activ­
ity to reduce its duration. Fast tracking often results in rework and 
increased risk.

302  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Five mathematical analysis techniques can help define duration limita­
tions and reduce the total cycle time. They are:
• Critical path method (CPM): This creates a path through the sched­
ule that defines the total project cycle. Understanding the path allows 
the project team to focus on a smaller group of activities to deter­
mine how to reduce the project cycle time. Each time a critical path 
is eliminated, a new one is created for the project team to work on.
• Critical chain method (CCM): This looks at the schedule to deter­
mine what resource restrictions have been imposed on the total cycle 
time. This allows you to assign additional or more skillful resources 
to reduce cycle time.
• Graphical evaluation and review technique (GERT): This allows for 
a probable treatment of both work networks and activity duration 
estimates.
• Program evaluation and review technique (PERT): This uses a 
weighted-average duration estimate to calculate activity durations. 
It ends up with a PERT chart view of the project.
• Simulation modeling: Some people use this method to help reduce 
cycle time and cost, but we haven’t found it particularly useful.
The most frequently used method to document a schedule is with a bar 
chart called a Gantt chart, which lists each activity that must be performed 
and visually indicates an activity’s duration as well as the interrelation­
ships between activities. (See Figure 8.19.)
Project Management Software
A key part of project management is a very good work breakdown structure 
(WBS). There are many different software packages that can help with the task of 
developing the WBS. Microsoft Project Office software is the most used product.
IBM has created an IBM Project Management Center of Excellence that 
has developed a Worldwide Project Management Method (WWPMM). 
The WWPMM contains 13 knowledge areas that group 150 different pro­
cesses. The IBM Project Management Center of Excellence defines suc­
cessful operations by four factors:
• All project management professionals are knowledgeable, account­
able, and part of a respected learning community.
• Employees in all professions understand and practice their roles 
and responsibilities.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  303
• All management systems, infrastructure, and staff organizations sup­
port project management with portfolio, program, and project views.
• Mechanisms are in place to sustain learning and continuous 
improvement of project management disciplines.
The IBM Project Management Center of Excellence defines a five-level 
maturity model as follows:
• Level I: Pilot phase. (Ad hoc-type operation.)
• Level II: In deployment. (The project management process is disci­
plined. Roles and responsibilities are specified in the project plan.)
• Level III: Functional. (The project management process is standard­
ized, consistent, and has defined practices.)
• Level IV: Integrated. (The project management process produces 
predictable results. Monitoring and management tools are in place.)
• Level V: World class. (The project management process is continu­
ously improving. A knowledge base provides continuous feedback 
and prompts upgrades that reflect best practices. Lessons learned are 
continuously included in the process design.)
The IBM Project Management Center of Excellence developed an educa­
tion curriculum to provide the best project management education available

in the industry. This curriculum translates education into effective business 
advantage through knowledge prerequisites, periodic testing, applied work 
experience, and a progressive course structure that builds upon previous 
classes. In 1992 IBM began certifying its project managers. The certifica­
tion process provided the company with managers who could apply the lat­
est technologies and methods. In addition, certified project managers were 
required to recertify every 3 years, thereby ensuring constant exposure to the 
most recent and advanced project management initiatives and experiences.
IBM conducted an extensive benchmarking study of project management 
software packages available around the world and selected two products:
• Microsoft Project Office
• Systemcorp PMOffice
The advantages and disadvantages of each of these are listed in Table 8.3.
As a result of its increased focus on project management, IBM greatly 
reduced cost, wasted effort, schedule overruns, and project failures 
throughout the organization.

Essex Electrical tried many combinations to make its IT project successful. 
As the company president, Harold Karp, put it, “I’ve had teams that were 
headed up by just business executives, and I’ve had them headed up by just an 
IT executive. In both cases the teams achieved only limited success.” When 
they switched over to a project management approach, IT operating expenses 
dropped by 35%, and sales gained 1%, which translated into margins of 2.5 
to 3%.
Well-managed projects do make a difference, according to a December 
2003 article in CRM Magazine: As a result of effectively implementing 
a customer relationship management project, Waters Corp. was able to:
• Achieve an overall ROI of 35%
• Nearly triple sales
• Increase e-commerce revenue by 300%
• Generate additional revenue of $2 million in the service department alone
Projects represent a significant investment of strategic importance 
to any organization. The investment is comprised of resources, capital 
expenditure, time commitment, and individual dedication to make and 
embrace a change that will enable the organization to improve business 
performance and strengthen its competitive position.
Because projects are so critical to an organization’s continued growth, it’s 
important to generate a project postmortem. This document consolidates 
and outlines essential project best practices and identifies any negative les­
sons learned so that other project managers don’t have to make the same 
mistakes.
A postmortem verifies the following:
• Did the project realize business benefits?
• Did the project deliverables meet requirement objectives?
• What best practices could be passed on to other project managers?
• What lessons learned should other project managers look out for?
• Did the project result in customer satisfaction?
• Which resources excelled during this project?
Answering these questions for senior management will help them 
understand the project outcome. The information will also enable the 
organization to continue using its best resources on other projects.

306  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and other stan­
dards define 75 different tools that a project manager should master. Few 
project managers I’ve met during the past 50 years have mastered all these 
tools. Today very few project managers are certified as such by their peers. 
The Project Management Institute has an excellent certification program 
that we highly recommend. As an executive, you should select certified 
project managers to run your projects.
Project management is one of the most important improvement tools avail­
able but also one of the most misused. It’s as if we’re trying to use a hammer 
to remove a screw.
PMBOK Tools and Techniques
Some of the more commonly used project management tools and tech­
niques (as recommended by the Project Management Institute and others) 
are listed in Table 8.4. Evaluate yourself to determine your project man­
agement maturity level. For each one, check off your present level:
• Do not know it
• Know it but have not used it
• Used it
• Mastered it
If you would like more information on these or other improvement 
tools, contact the Harrington Institute: www.harrington-institute.com.
	Using the sum of the four individual point scores, the following is your 
project manager maturity level:
• Excellent project manager:		
	
175–225
• Acceptable project manager:	
	
125–174
• Acceptable project team member:	 	
100–124
• Unacceptable project manager:	
	
50–100
• Unacceptable project team member:

A project is managed through a series of interaction of iterative process 
groups through its life cycle phases. (See Figure 8.20.) Figure 8.21 provides 
a complete view of how the project management process model is linked 
to developing a new product, service, or system.

QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT (QFD)
Prepared by Dave Farrell
Definition
Quality function deployment (QFD) is a structured process for tak­
ing the voice of the customer and translating it into measurable 
customer requirements and measurable counterpart character­
istics, and “deploying” those requirements into every level of the 
product and manufacturing process design and all customer ser­
vice processes.

320  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Just the Facts
The words quality function do not refer to the quality department, but 
rather to any activity needed to assure that quality is achieved, no matter 
what department performs the activity.
In QFD, all operations of the company are linked to, and driven by, the 
voice of the customer. This linkage brings quality assurance and quality 
control to all relevant functions in the organization and shifts the focus of 
quality efforts from the manufacturing process to the entire development, 
production, marketing, and delivery process. QFD provides the meth­
odology for the entire organization to focus on what the customers like 
or dislike, and puts the emphasis on designing in quality at the product 
development stage, rather than problem solving at later stages.
Typical users of QFD in the United States include AT&T Bell 
Labs, Black & Decker, Chrysler, DEC, DuPont, Eaton, Ford, General 
Electric, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Johnson Controls, Kraft 
Foods, Proctor & Gamble, Rockwell, Scott Paper, Sheller-Globe, Texas 
Instruments, and Xerox. Organizations such as these consistently report 
benefits, including:
• Measurable improvement in customer satisfaction/market share
• Reduction in time-to-market (product development cycles)
• Significant reduction in the number of engineering changes
• Start-up costs reduced
• Identification of competitive advantage and marketing strategy
• Reduction in warranty claims and customer complaints
• Increase in cross-functional teamwork
The House of Quality, a matrix format used to organize various data 
elements, so named for its shape, is the principal tool of QFD. (See 
Figure 8.25.) Although “house” designs may vary, all contain the same 
basic elements:
• Whats: The qualities or attributes the product or service must con­
tain, as required by the customer. Whats are compared to competi­
tors’ qualities and ranked by importance.
• Hows: The technical means for satisfying the whats, including the 
exact specifications (how much) that must be met to achieve them.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  321
• Correlation matrix: An evaluation of the positive and negative rela­
tionships between the hows, sometimes called the “roof.”
• Relationship matrix: An evaluation of the relationships between the 
whats and hows. It identifies the best ways to satisfy the customer 
and generates a numerical ranking used as a guide throughout the 
development process.
These Houses of Quality are used in each of the four primary phases of QFD:
	
1.	Product planning phase: Where customer requirements are iden­
tified and translated into design specifications or product control 
characteristics in the form of a planning matrix.
	
2.	Parts development phase: Translates the outputs of the product plan­
ning phase (design specifications) into individual part details that 
define part characteristics.
	
3.	Process planning phase: Defines the process for making each com­
ponent and establishes critical component parameters.
	
4.	Operating instructions (production planning): Define the produc­
tion requirements for each component/operation.

Using QFD
Richard Tabor Green points out in his book Global Quality that QFD was 
designed to:
• Translate observed customer behavior into customer wants
• Translate customer articulations into customer wants
• Translate competitor success at meeting customer wants into a 
threat assessment
• Translate competitor process capabilities into a threat assessment
• Translate customer wants and competitor threat assessment into a 
market opportunity map
• Translate a market opportunity map into product lines and 
release schedules
• Translate product lines and release schedules into product develop­
ment projects
• Translate product development projects into part and process 
specifications
• Translate part and process specifications into operation specifications
• Translate operation specifications into delivery and service specifications
We agree that the House of Quality looks very complex and confus­
ing, but it does contain a great deal of information. To help you under­
stand this complex picture, we will discuss the major parts of the House of 
Quality. By understanding the parts, you will be able to see how they blend 
together to provide a very effective weapon.
Effective application of QFD is likely to require significant change in the 
way an organization operates. Substantial training and planning are involved. 
There are new tools to be learned. Cross-functional teamwork capability will 
be put to the test. Purchasing, sales, and engineering organizations will be 
involved in product or service design and development to a degree never 
previously experienced. All of these factors suggest that success, even of a 
limited project, is dependent on a high level of management commitment. 
As with any significant change effort, effective sponsorship by key manage­
ment personnel of each affected organization is essential. Attention should 
be given at the outset to the principles and methodologies of organizational 
change management, which are beyond the scope of this chapter.
To maintain sponsor commitment, senior management personnel 
should be involved in the selection of initial projects. The selection team 
should identify a wide variety of potential projects and formally apply an 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (O Through Q)  •  323
agreed upon set of evaluation criteria (for example, market share, product 
life cycle, cost reduction potential, revenue enhancement potential, mar­
ket share implications, need for time-to-market reduction, competitive 
position, organizational commitment, potential for success, alignment 
with business plan/strategy, etc.).
With the project selected, it is now time to select the QFD team leader 
and members. Care should be taken to include participants from all key 
organizations involved from the product (or service) concept/design 
through to delivery and after-sale service. It is likely that the core team 
will be augmented by additional people at different stages of the QFD pro­
cess, as additional detail is required.
The core team’s initial activity should include the development of a team 
charter, including mission, objectives, guidelines for team conduct, work 
plan, and a timetable. The team charter should be shared with the execu­
tive group to assure alignment on mission, objectives, and expectations. 
Consensus around a team charter also clarifies the resources that will be 
required, and avoids midproject surprises that can derail the effort. The 
team should also plan for periodic status reporting (at a minimum, upon 
the completion of each QFD phase) to the executive group to maintain 
sponsor awareness and commitment.
Time spent early in the process in team building and member training 
is an investment well worth the effort. It is important that team mem­
bers understand the QFD methodology at the outset, have an agreed upon 
roadmap of the process they are going to follow, and possess basic team 
skills. In addition, competence in the related methodologies and tools 
described in this book will substantially enhance the effectiveness of the 
team and the success of the QFD project.
Voice of the Customer
This is not only where QFD begins, but it is the foundation on which 
every step that follows is based. In this phase we abandon previous prac­
tices of assuming that we know what the customer wants and needs, 
or worse yet, a marketing philosophy predicated on the notion that we 
can “sell” the customer on what we already have to deliver. We begin 
by really listening to the customer’s expression of his or her require­
ments, in his or her own terms. And we probe for a level of detail hereto­
fore unidentified. A variety of sources and market research tools should 
be considered, including follow-up letters to customers, observations 

324  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
of the customers using the product, interviews, focus groups, “buff” 
magazines, independent product reviews, trade shows, sales contacts, 
printed and/or telephonic surveys, etc. Also, the past history of unsolic­
ited customer feedback should be reviewed, such as customer returns, 
complaint letters, and accolades. Product or service dimensions around 
which customer input is sought can include any or all of the follow­
ing: performance, features, reliability, conformance, durability, service­
ability, safety, environmental, aesthetics, perceived quality, and cost. 
Examples of the application of these dimensions in the case of a toaster 
are shown in Table 8.7.
Customer requirements can also be expressed at multiple levels of detail, 
commonly called primary, secondary, and tertiary. The customer require­
ments, so expressed, become the vertical axis of the top portion of the 
planning matrix, as shown in Figure 8.26.
While collecting customer requirements information, the relative 
importance of each characteristic should be identified (using a numeri­
cal rating scale) to enable prioritization of those characteristics. This

information will be used in conjunction with the competitive evaluation 
to assure favorable performance measures on those characteristics most 
important to the customer. The prioritization data will be entered on the 
right side of the top portion of the matrix in the column labeled “Customer 
Importance Rating.”
Next, the final product control characteristics (design requirements) are 
identified and arranged across the top horizontal row of the matrix. (See 
Figure 8.27.) These are measurable characteristics that must be deployed 
throughout the design, procurement, manufacturing, assembly, delivery, 
and service processes to manifest themselves in the final product perfor­
mance and customer acceptance.
Since not all of the relationships between customer requirements and the 
corresponding final product control characteristics will be equally strong, 
the next step involves building a relationship matrix to display all of those 
relationships (using either symbols or numerical values) to further enable 
focus on those which are most highly related to high-priority require­
ments. It is a way to validate that design features cover all characteristics

needed to meet customer requirements. An example of the relationship 
matrix is shown in Figure 8.28.
At a very minimum, every important customer requirement should have at 
least one product characteristic that has a medium or strong relationship to 
it. If this is not the case, additional product characteristics should be added to 
correct this void. The relationship matrix also serves the important function 
of identifying conflicting requirements, for example, high strength versus 
low weight. When such conflicts are identified, the application of Taguchi 
methods as mentioned above is indicated to optimize design characteristics.
While analyzing the relationship matrix and its implications, it is 
important to keep open to the possibility of modifying or adding to the 
list of product control characteristics.
The next step is completion of the market evaluation, including both the 
customer importance rating and competitive evaluations, on the right side 
of the top portion of the matrix. (See Figure 8.29.) This section displays

the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the product in the market­
place around those requirements most important to the customer. The 
data for the competitive evaluation can come from the same sources as 
the customer requirements data, from independent or internal product 
testing, and from independent benchmarking of product characteristics 
as described briefly above. As such, the comparisons can be based on both 
objective and subjective data.
The company’s and competitor’s present performance data for the 
final product control characteristics are entered in the lower section of 
the matrix in the columns for each relevant characteristic, as shown in

below the corresponding competitive data, as shown in Figure 8.31.
The final element of the planning matrix is the selection of those product 
quality characteristics that are to be deployed through the remainder of 
the QFD process. Those that are a high priority to the customer, have poor 
competitive performance, or require significant improvement to achieve 
established target levels should be taken to the next level of QFD analysis.

acteristics that must be met in order to achieve the final product characteristics 
are identified, and the matrix indicates the extent of the relationship between 
the two, as shown in Figure 8.32. It is the critical component characteristics 
that will be deployed further and monitored in the later stages of QFD.
It should be noted that a focus on high-priority characteristics is crucial 
from this point forward. Experience has shown that a number of QFD 
teams have lost focus or energy at this point due to the apparent complex­
ity of the process or the sheer number of charts or possible correlations. To 
start, work to identify the three to five most critical finished component

The Roof of the House of Quality
To complete the House of Quality, we need to put a roof on it. The roof 
of the House of Quality is used to analyze the interactions between 
characteristics. (See Figure 8.34.) Basically two characteristics can have 
one of three types of relationships:
	
1.	As one changes, it has no impact upon the other.
	
2.	As one changes for the better, it has a negative impact on the other.
	
3.	As one gets better, it has a positive impact upon the other.

In Figure 8.34 row 1 is made up of ten diamonds. The diamond at the 
lower left-hand end of the row analyzes the interactions between charac­
teristics 1 and 2. The second diamond analyzes the interactions between 
characteristics 1 and 3, etc. The diamond on the lower left-hand end of the 
row labeled R2 analyzes the interaction between characteristics 2 and 3, 
etc. By analyzing the interactions between each diamond that makes up 
the House of Quality roof, all the interactions between the different char­
acteristics are analyzed. To pictorially show the interactions, the following 
codes are recorded in the related diamonds:
• No interactions
• Negative interaction
• Positive interaction
Some people choose to put nothing in the diamond that has no interac­
tion, but we feel this is poor practice because there is no visual evidence 
that the interactions were analyzed. Some individuals carried out the 
analysis to further classify the interactions in five categories.
	
1.	Strong positive
	
2.	Strong negative
	
3.	No interaction
	
4.	Negative
	
5.	Strong negative
In the more sophisticated models point scores are assigned that indicate 
the interrelationship’s strengths or weaknesses. For example:
• Plus 4 points is given to relationships that have a strong positive 
impact upon each other.
• Plus 2 points is given to relationships that have a medium positive 
impact upon each other.
• No points are given when there is no interaction.
• Minus 2 points is given to relationships that have a medium negative 
impact on each other.
• Minus 4 points is given to relationships that have strong negative 
impacts on each other.

With the addition of the roof on top of the House of Quality, we have 
now completed the quality function deployment of one level. In reality, the 
House of Quality should be broken down from:
• Voice of a customer to design specifications
• Design specifications to parts characteristics
• Parts characteristics to manufacturing operations
• Manufacturing operation to production requirements
At each one of these breakdowns a new House of Quality is often pre­
pared to help understand the product and how it relates to the voice of the 
customer.
As with previous matrices, symbols or numerical values can be used in 
the process plan matrix to show the strengths of the relationships. Control 
points are established at the steps in the process that are critical to meet­
ing component characteristics. They establish the data and the strategy 
for achieving product characteristics that meet high-priority customer 
requirements.
In the quality plan matrix, the process steps can be displayed in flow­
chart format, and the control points and checking methods for each 
control point are taken to a more specific level of detail. It is the latter 
information that forms the basis for developing the final QFD document, 
operating instructions.
Operating Instructions
Unlike previously described matrices, the operating instructions in QFD 
do not have a single prescribed format. They may be designed to meet the 
specific characteristics of the process and needs of the process operators.
The essence of this final step, other than implementation, is to deploy 
the results of the quality plan to the people who will be executing it. The 
instructions should be in sufficient detail to provide needed information, 
in a useful format, on what to check, when to check it, how to check it, 
what to check it with, and what parameters are acceptable. This step makes 
the final connection between the work of the operator and his or her ulti­
mate objective of satisfaction of the customer’s requirements.

Summary
QFD is one of the most rapidly growing methodologies in the quality arse­
nal. Its successful application requires management’s willingness to invest 
the three T’s—time, tools, and training. There are a number of issues to 
be considered before adopting the process. Training and implementation 
time and costs can be significant. Do you have sufficient sponsor commit­
ment to sustain the effort over time? How successful has the organization 
been at other cross-functional team efforts? How are you going to incorpo­
rate ongoing process improvements into the QFD documentation system? 
QFD can be complex to administer. Who is going to be responsible for that 
task? Product revisions, although fewer in number, require effort to inte­
grate into the entire system. The increased effort at planning stages, rather 
than implementation, requires a cultural shift in many organizations.
As Ted Kinni put it, in concluding his November 1, 1993, Industry Week 
article, “Simply put, QFD is work. On the other hand, its growing popular­
ity indicates that faster and less expensive development cycles, improved 
quality and reliability, and greater customer satisfaction are well worth 
the effort.”

Examples are included in the text. Figure 8.35 is a detailed view of the

RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Customers buy the first time based upon quality. They come back to buy 
again based upon reliability.

338  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Definition
A reliability management system is a system for designing, analyzing, 
and controlling the design and manufacturing processes so that there 
is a high probability of an item performing its function under stated 
conditions for a specific period of time.
JUST THE FACTS
Although everyone is talking about quality today, it isn’t quality that gets 
your customers to come back—it’s reliability. Quality is what makes the 
first sale, but it is reliability that keeps the customers. Reliability is the most 
important thing to customers of both products and services. Customers 
expect that their new car will start when they pick it up at the dealer, but it 
is even more important that it starts every time they get into it to drive to 
the airport for a flight that they are already late for (reliability).
We are amazed at the way reliability is being overlooked. In fact, it’s 
hard to find a book on quality management that directly addresses reli­
ability. In 20 books on quality that we pulled at random from our book­
shelves, only two had reliability even listed in their index: Joe Juran’s old 
faithful Quality Control Handbook (McGraw-Hill, 1988) and Armand 
Feigenbaum’s classic Total Quality Control.
Unfortunately, management has been trained to understand quality but 
has little understanding about the methodologies that result in improved 
reliability; as a result, they do not ask the right questions of their engi­
neers and supporting managers. This results in misguided focus all the 
way through the organization.
• Rule 1: To get quality, everyone must understand what quality is.
• Rule 2: To get reliability, everyone needs to understand what reli­
ability is.
The maximum reliability is determined by the product design. The pro­
duction process design can only detract from the inherent reliability of the 
original design.
It is not poor quality that is causing North America to continue to lose 
market share—it is poor reliability. We analyzed the midsized passenger 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  339
automobiles reliability data reported in the Consumer Reports Buying Guide 
1998. We calculated an index by weighing the complexity of the unit from 1 
to 3. We scored each unit’s reliability as shown in Table 9.1.
The very best index a brand of automobile could get is 180. Using this 
index, we discovered that Japanese brands have an index that is almost 100% 
higher than North American brands (Japanese brands index = 113.8, North 
American brands index = 60.9). The two lowest reliability indexes were for 
two European cars. The Japanese Subaru Legacy had the highest reliabil­
ity index, which was 133 out of a maximum possible points of 180. Only 
one Japanese car had a rating lower than 118 points, the Mitsubishi Gallant, 
which had a rating of 62. All of the North American brands index ratings 
were below 72.
The difference between Japanese and North American midsized passen­
ger cars is only 5 percentage points. It is so small that the consumer cannot 
detect the difference. It is the lack of reliability that is turning once-loyal 
consumers of Ford, GM, or Chrysler autos to Toyota, Nissan, or Honda. 
The result is that U.S. brands are continuously losing their market share in 
passenger cars even within the United States. (See Figure 9.1.)
In the 1990s it was well known that the reason U.S. automakers were los­
ing market share was because of their poor reliability record compared to 
Japanese cars. Now 20 years later the U.S. automobile industry has made 
some progress, but is it enough? I will let you be the judge. The following 
is the analysis of today’s 3-year-old cars’ error-free performance by auto­
makers as defined in Consumer Reports Magazine (April 2012, p. 78). They 
are listed in order from the best to the worst.

Meeting reliability requirements has become one of the major demands 
upon modern product technology. Buyers who once concentrated their 
purchases upon products that were primarily innovative or attention-
getting now concentrate upon such products which also operate reliably.

To provide a competitive, reliable item or service requires that the orga­
nization delivering the output understands and improves the processes 
that are used to design and build reliability into its output. Figure 9.2 rep­
resents a typical reliability system or, as we like to call it, reliability cycle. 
We have selected the word cycle because each generation builds upon the 
experiences and knowledge generated in the previous cycle.

Phase I: Defining Reliability Requirements
The textbook approach is for the marketing organization to identify a 
product opportunity and develop a product perspective that defines the 
cost, performance, and reliability requirements needed to service a spe­
cific market. Typical reliability measurements would be:
• Mean time to failure
• Mean time between failures
This perspective should be based upon a detailed knowledge of the 
external customer/consumer’s needs and environment, plus a great deal of

customer/consumer contact and potential customer/consumer inputs. The 
major value-added contents that a marketing group contributes to a prod­
uct are the customer/consumer’s perspective, needs, expectations, and an 
expert projection of how these factors will change between the time the 
marketing group collected the research data and the date that the prod­
uct will be available to the consumer. This is often a difficult task because 
many product development cycles are measured in years, not weeks, and 
technology is improving so fast that it is sometimes difficult for market­
ing’s “crystal ball” to accurately project reliability requirements. On the 
other hand, there should be no one closer to the customer/consumer and 
in a better position to do it than the marketing organization. A good mar­
keting organization not only will understand the customer/consumer’s 
present and projected expectations, but also will have a detailed under­
standing of the present technologies that are being developed that will 
drive further customer/consumer requirements.
Using the product perspective as the product performance basic document, 
the product reliability specifications are usually developed by product engi­
neering or research and development (R&D). Often, the reliability specifica­
tions are more impacted by inherent reliability of the embedded technologies 
and competition than they are by customer/consumer expectations. In the 
better organizations, the consumer’s reliability expectations are less demand­
ing than the product reliability specifications. That does not mean that the 
reliability specification developed by R&D does not consider the customer/
consumer requirements, because in most cases, they do, but the engineer’s 
thought process is very different. The engineer has a tendency to say: “The 
product’s reliability is X. What percentage of the market will consider buying 
our product?” The marketing-driven approach will state: “If you can provide 
product that will do this function, at this cost, and at this level of reliability, 
the market for the product would be y customers/consumers, and we should 
be able to capture z percent of the market.” It is then left up to R&D to design 
a product that will meet or exceed the market expectations.
The initial new-design control activity involves establishing the require­
ments for MTTF and whatever other reliability targets may be indicated 
to meet the reliability required for the product. To be meaningful, the reli­
ability targets must be within reach at a planned date.
—Armand V. Feigenbaum

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  343
Phase II: Designing Reliability into the Item
A major consideration in every design is the reliability requirement for the 
end item. Major considerations in the design of an item are:
• Cost
• Performance
• Reliability
• System compatibility
• Availability
• Manufacturability
The item’s intrinsic reliability is defined by the design. The design will 
dictate, for example, the materials selection, the item operating tempera­
ture, the structure of an item, the way it is maintained, and the way com­
ponents of the item are used.
Of course, maintainability is part of reliability because downtime is a 
typical reliability measurement, and of course, easy maintenance has a big 
input on the customer/consumer’s cost of ownership.
Phase I is the most important phase in the reliability cycle because it 
starts the whole cycle, and defines the requirements for each of the other 
phases, but Phase II runs a close second. Proper preventive maintenance 
may mask some of the reliability problems, but other activities, like manu­
facturing, field repairs, and shipping, only serve to degrade the intrinsic 
reliability of the design. Even preventive maintenance often has a tempo­
rary negative effect on the item’s reliability.
A well-designed, preventive maintenance system removes components 
just before they reach their end-of-life points where the components’ fail­
ure rates take off.
Note:  There is a Rule 3: The item’s intrinsic reliability is defined by the 
design.
In order for the R&D engineers to create an acceptable design, a great 
deal of component reliability data need to be at their fingertips. In addition, 
they need to have an excellent understanding of reliability considerations 
(for example, impact on components’ reliability when the component is 
used at derated values, or impact of changing environmental conditions, 
or where and when to use a redundant circuit).

344  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Phase III: Defining Component Reliability
It is easy to see that the engineering departments need to understand the 
bathtub curve failure rates of all components if they are going to design a 
product that meets customer/consumer reliability requirements.
Definition
A bathtub curve is a picture of an item’s failure rate versus time. It 
shows how the failure rate decreases during the item’s early life to its 
intrinsic failure rate level and remains at the level until the item starts 
to wear out and its end-of-life rate begins to increase.
Establishing the bathtub curve error rates of all components is a critical 
part of a reliability program. Although early-life and end-of-life failure 
rates are important design considerations, the most important consider­
ation is the intrinsic failure rate. For a typical electronic component, the 
early-life phase lasts anywhere between 100 and 200 hours of operation, 
and the end-of-life phase begins about 8 to 10 years after its first power-
on point. Some place between 5 and 7 years of the electronic component’s 
life cycle, it will be performing at its intrinsic failure rates. It is for this 
reason that most reliability projects use only intrinsic failure rates in cal­
culating the total item’s projected reliability. This approach greatly sim­
plifies the calculations. Unfortunately, the first thing that the consumer 
is subjected to is the high early-life failure rates. As a result, consumer 
impression of the product is heavily weighted on the early-life failures. “I 
just got this product and it already isn’t working. I’ll take it back and get 
another brand.”

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  345
A properly designed manufacturing process can do a lot to keep early-
life failures from reaching the consumer. There are many ways that intrin­
sic (inherent) component failure rate data can be obtained:
• Components’ supplier databases
• Reliability data collected by clearinghouses
• U.S. government databases
• Performance of the components in the organization’s previous products
• Component reliability testing by the organization
Phase IV: Calculating the Item’s Reliability
There are two ways to calculate an item’s reliability:
• Testing at the completed item level and statistically analyzing the results
• Testing at the lower levels and calculating the item’s reliability
Usually, a combination of both these approaches is used to give a maxi­
mum level of confidence at minimum cost. Testing the completed item in 
a simulated customer/consumer environment provides the most accurate 
data, but it is expensive, very time-consuming, and often impractical. For 
example, if the product’s life expectancy were 10 years, the organization 
would have to test a very large sample of the item for 10 years before it 
could publish reliability figures. For this reason, stress testing and acceler­
ated life testing of a small sample of the product is most frequently used to 
support shipment to customers/consumers.
This approach makes all of your customers/consumers part of the orga­
nization’s product reliability test sample. To minimize the chance of not 
meeting the reliability specifications in the customer/consumer’s envi­
ronment, the final item’s tests are supplemented and verified by mathe­
matically combining testing at the lower levels of the item (component, 
assembly, unit, etc.). This is the best way to estimate the item’s reliability 
during the design stage of the item’s life cycle.
Once the error rate for the individual component is determined, the 
reliability of assembly can be calculated. In order to accomplish this cal­
culation, the engineer must understand how the components are used and 
what environmental conditions they will be subjected to. An assembly’s 
reliability can be calculated by mathematically combining the reliability 
projections for the components that make up the assembly once they have 

346  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
been adjusted to reflect the way they are used. Assembly reliability can be 
combined mathematically to define unit-estimated reliability. These data 
usually do not take into consideration any degradation that would occur 
as a result of the manufacturing and servicing activities. If the reliability 
estimates do not indicate that the product will meet the reliability speci­
fication, Phase II (design the item), Phase III (define component reliabil­
ity), and Phase IV (calculate the item’s reliability) will be repeated. (See 
Figure 9.2.)
Phase V: Minimizing Manufacturing Degradation
As we have stated, the item’s intrinsic reliability is defined by the design. 
The manufacturing process can only degrade the item’s performance from 
this intrinsic reliability value. Typical manufacturing things that could 
cause degradation of the item are:
• Stresses that are applied to the component during manufacturing 
that exceed the component specification or expected use, but the 
unit does not stop functioning altogether. (Example: A flow solder­
ing machine that is set too high can cause damage to many flow sol­
der joints within the components and the connections on the circuit 
board without causing them to completely fail, but it could greatly 
decrease their mechanical integrity, increasing the item’s failure 
rates after it is delivered to the customer.)
• Tests that do not functionally test all the conditions that the cus­
tomer will apply to the item. This is referred to as test coverage when 
applied to electronic systems.
• Assembly errors. (Example: A wire pulled too tight around a sharp 
edge could result in cold flow, causing the unit to short out.)
New manufacturing processes should be qualified to minimize the deg­
radation they have on the design. Typical things that would be considered 
during a manufacturing process qualification activity would be:
• Are the documents complete and understandable when used by the 
manufacturing operators?
• Are the tools and test equipment capable of producing high-quality 
products that repeatedly meet the engineering specification?

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  347
• Are the controls in place to ensure that out-of-specification condi­
tions can be quickly identified, preventing the escape of deviant 
product from the process?
• Have process control requirements been met? The process should be 
capable of producing products at a Cpk of 1.4 minimum. World-class 
Cpk is 2.0 or six sigma.
Phase VI: Qualifying the Item
To qualify an item, two factors have to be evaluated:
• The product design needs to be evaluated to ensure it is capable 
of meeting its design requirements. This is called verifying the 
design.
• The manufacturing processes and their support processes need to be 
evaluated to ensure that they do not degrade the basic design to an 
unacceptable level. This is called manufacturing process validation.
Once the design has been released and the item’s production process 
has been certified, the item should be subjected to a qualification test to 
determine if the theoretical reliability estimates were correct and to pro­
vide a minimum degree of assurance that the specified reliability per­
formance has been designed and built into the item. At the components 
and small assemblies levels, the sample size may be large enough for 
the organization to have a high degree of confidence that the reliability 
projections will be met. For large, complex assemblies and items (for 
example, cars, planes, computers, etc.), it is often too costly and time-
consuming to evaluate a large enough sample size to have a meaningful 
level of confidence that reliability projections can be met. To offset this 
risk, many organizations conduct a number of evaluations throughout 
the product development cycle in order to gain a higher level of confi­
dence that the item will meet reliability expectations in the customer’s 
environment.
The most important reliability tests are those applied to the system or end 
product as a whole; however, many tests may be conducted at the part, sub-
assembly, and assembly levels prior to receipt of hardware for system tests. 
It is not feasible, from cost and schedule viewpoints, to conduct statistically 
significant tests at all equipment levels. Accordingly, it is suggested that 

348  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
major emphasis be placed upon tests at the component-part level and the 
complete system level.
—J.M. Juran
Phase VII: Measuring Customer/Consumer Reliability
Once the floodgates are open and the product is being delivered to the 
external customers, the true reliability of the item can be measured. 
Unfortunately, the customer sees reliability as a black and white consid­
eration. For example, a man/woman gets into the car, and the car starts 
or doesn’t. He/she puts on the brakes, and the car stops or doesn’t. The 
customer doesn’t care if it is an early-life failure or end-of-life failure 
or whether he/she was using the item as it was intended to be used or 
not. The customer just expects it to work each time he/she wants it to 
operate. Now, the real test of your reliability system is put on the line. It 
is very important that systems be put in place to collect these data in a 
way that will allow the reliability problems related to the item to be cor­
rected and to provide information that will allow future items to benefit 
from the mistakes made on this item. It is a lot easier to say that the data 
system should be put in place than it is to make it work.
In today’s fast-reacting environment, it is absolutely essential to have 
pertinent information available to the total organization on an ongoing 
basis. Today’s best practices put the repair action data from yesterday’s 
failures on the president and other key executives’ desks today. IBM’s field 
reporting system is an excellent one to benchmark.
Phase VIII: Corrective Action and Database Updating
The database that is developed in Phases III, IV, V, VI, and VII is estab­
lished for three purposes:
• To measure current product reliability
• To correct current reliability or perceived reliability problems
• To collect component and assembly-error rate information for future use
The key to good corrective action is defining the root cause of the prob­
lems. In most cases, this means the suspected component needs to undergo 
a detailed failure analysis activity where it is characterized and very often 
dissected. We like to be able to recreate every external failure condition. 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  349
When you can take a good component and get it to fail in exactly the same 
way that the component under study failed in the field operation, you have 
gained true knowledge of the failure mechanism and can solve the problem. 
In most cases, a good failure analysis system is a key ingredient of an effec­
tive corrective action cycle, but correcting the problem is only the start of 
the total cycle. Truly, you need to prevent problems from reoccurring on 
the current process and all future products. In this case, we need to look at 
what an effective preventive action cycle is. Seven critical ingredients that 
are required in any long-range plan to permanently eliminate problems are:
• Awareness
• Desire
• Training in problem solving
• Failure analysis
• Follow-up system
• Prevention activities
• Liberal credit
The reliability cycle in Figure 9.2 depicts the process that every item 
whose reliability is of concern to the customer and/or management should 
go through. You will note that each cycle is triggered with a new reliability 
requirement and that the cycle is short-circuited when an item’s calculated 
reliability does not meet reliability requirements or when the product’s 
actual reliability performance fails to meet consumer expectations.
In a pure service environment, the reliability cycle needs to be modified 
to focus upon the processes that produce the service. In these cases, a fault 
tree analysis-type activity becomes very important. Too often, management 
believes that reliability is a hardware measurement and does not apply to the 
service industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. The five things 
that are most important to having customers return to a service provider are:
• Accuracy of information provided
• Timeliness of service
• Responsiveness of personnel
• Reliability of organization’s process
• Physical appearance
Reliability can be your competitive edge. Is your reliability management 
system up to it?

350  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Examples
While customers/consumers treat product reliability as a specified quan­
tity, they fail to consider reliability costs of various producers during pur­
chase negotiations. Quality may be free, but reliability is not. The basic 
bromide of “you get what you pay for” is substantially untrue. Your house 
shingles that last for 50 years initially installed cost 60% more than the 
house shingles that last 20 years. In the long run, the less reliable materials 
cost 500% more to own. (See Figures 9.3 to 9.8.)

Definition
Root cause analysis is the process of identifying the various causes 
affecting a particular problem, process, or issue and determining the 
real reasons that caused the condition.
Just the Facts
Everyone talks about industrial problem solving, and some books explain 
how to do it. These books typically provide precise methods for selecting 
the problem to work on and ways to protect customers from receiving 
defective products. They all advise you not to treat the symptoms, but to 
define the root cause so that the real problem can be corrected. It sounds 
so simple; all you have to do is define the root cause, but most books never 
tell you how. Why do they avoid giving details about this crucial activity? 
The reason is simple. Defining the root cause is often very difficult and 
complex; there is no one right way that works all the time. The practitioner 
must be skilled at selecting the most effective approach.
There are a number of ways to get to the root of a problem. A good fail­
ure analysis laboratory can provide the insight necessary to understand 
how a failure such as a broken bolt occurred. Duplicating the failure under 
laboratory conditions also has proved to be an effective way to define the 
root cause of problems. You know you have found the root cause when 
you can cause the problem to occur and go away at will. Either of these 
approaches works well, but they require expensive laboratories and highly 
trained personnel.
Excessive variation is at the heart of most problems, at least the difficult 
ones. Variation is part of life. No two items or acts are exactly identical. 
Even identical twins have very different fingerprints, voice patterns, and 
personal values. No two screws made on the same machine are exactly the 
same. Equipment may not be sensitive enough to measure the variation, 
but it exists. Some variation is good; it keeps our lives from being monoto­
nous. No one would like steak, mashed potatoes, and peas three times a 
day, every day of the week. They are good once in a while but would get old 
and boring if eaten at every meal.

354  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Some variation, within specific limits, has little or no effect on output. 
In other cases, variation can cause an entire plant to come to a halt. The 
variation we’re concerned about here is the variation that causes prob­
lems resulting in waste. There is no such thing as a random problem, 
just problems whose occurrence is more or less infrequent, meaning 
that the combination of specific variables occurs more or less infre­
quently. The art of defining the root cause is the art of variables analysis 
and isolation.
The root cause of a problem has been found when the key variables that 
caused the problem have been isolated. Over the years, there have been 
many methods developed to isolate key variables. Design of experiments 
and Taguchi methods are popular today. But the difficulties and effort 
required to prepare and conduct these studies cause them to be used on 
only a small fraction of the problems. Engineers, managers, production 
employees, and sales personnel solve most of their problems by brute force 
and a lot of luck. Even then, most of the time, the answer that is imple­
mented is not the best solution to the problem.
While this part of our book covers root cause analysis, not statistical 
process control, we need to understand that by studying different types of 
variation, the source of the variation can be identified. Then the problem 
solver can quickly and effectively reduce the many potential sources to a 
critical few, and often to a single factor, thereby greatly simplifying the 
problem evaluation cycle and reducing the amount of data for collection. 
The results can be profound:
• Problems can be solved faster.
• Fewer samples are required.
• Less-skilled people can solve very complex problems.
• Preventive and corrective action plans can be evaluated quickly.
• Nontechnical people can easily understand the results of a techni­
cal evaluation.
How to Do a Root Cause Analysis in Six Steps
Step 1: Identify the potential root cause for the problem. The most 
effective method of root cause analysis is to determine how the root 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  355
cause will be identified or what approach will be used. One of the 
most frequently used tools for identifying root cause is the cause-
and-effect or fishbone diagram. (This tool is part of the Green Belt 
training.) Its primary function is to provide the user with a picture 
of all the possible causes of a specific problem or condition. (See 
Figure 9.9.)
Step 2: Gather data on the frequency of the problem. Use check 
sheets or other approaches to track occurrences of problems and 
identify the causes. Figure 9.10 shows how a check sheet can be 
used for several problems that may result from one or more of sev­
eral causes.
Step 3: Determine the impact of the problem. Use a scatter diagram 
or similar tool. (See Figure 9.11.) Scatter diagrams are explained later 
in this chapter.
Step 4: Summarize all major root causes and relate them back to the 
major opportunity areas. The purpose of this is to:
• Identify root causes that impact several problems.
• Ensure that the major root causes are identified in all opportu­
nity areas.
• Aid in selection of the key root cause to eliminate it.

356  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Step 5: Prioritize the root causes. Use a prioritization matrix. (See 
Table 9.2.) This procedure consists of the following four steps:
• List the criteria to be used to evaluate the causes.
• Weight each criterion according to its relative importance. Put 
the weight for each criterion in that column heading.

• Using one criterion at a time, rank the order of all the causes—
with 1 being the least important. Enter the ranking in the col­
umn under the criterion in question.
• Multiply each rank order figure for each cause by the weight of 
each of the criteria to arrive at a total for each cause. Enter these 
totals in the final column of each row.
Step 6: Select the key root cause to eliminate. This decision should 
be based on the analysis of all available data. If you use a prioritiza­
tion matrix, you may simply decide according to the totals in the 
final column.
Examples
The fault tree analysis is another alternative and sometimes is more effec­
tive than the approach just described. (See Figure 9.12.) We like to think of 
it as the “What could cause this?” approach.
The following is an example of the “What could cause this?” approach 
in use.

SCATTER DIAGRAMS
Scatter diagrams could be called Data-Organized Diagrams.
Definition
Scatter diagrams are a graphic tool used to study the relationship 
between two variables.
Just the Facts
The scatter diagram is used to test for possible cause-and-effect relation­
ships. It does not prove that one variable causes the other, but it does 
show whether a relationship exists and reveals the character of that 
relationship.
The relationship between the two sets of variables can be evaluated by 
analyzing the cluster patterns that appear on the graph when the two sets 
of data are plotted with each axis being used for one of the sets of data. The 
direction and tightness of the cluster gives an indication of the relation­
ship between the two variables.

360  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Steps to Prepare a Scatter Diagram
	
1.	Collect paired samples of data.
	
2.	Construct the horizontal and vertical axes of the diagram. The vertical 
axis is usually used for the variable on which we are predicting or mea­
suring the possible effect. The horizontal axis is used for the variable 
that is being investigated as the possible cause of the other variable.
	
3.	Plot the data on the diagram. Circle data points that are repeated.
	
4.	Analyze the cluster pattern that appears.
Guidelines and Tips
Though a scatter diagram is completed to study the cause-and-effect rela­
tionship between two variables, you should be cautious about the state­
ment that “Variable 1 causes Variable 2.” There might be other reasons 
why two variables appear to be related, such as a third variable not repre­
sented in the plot, but related to both of the other variables.
Keep in mind that the full range over which Variable 1 varies is 
sometimes key in detecting a correlation between two variables. For 
example, experimental studies are often done over a wider range than 
normal production.
Also keep in mind that correlations do not have to be linear. Notice the last 
example, showing two variables that are correlated, but not in a linear fashion. 
Look for patterns that might indicate a relationship between two variables.

SELECTION MATRIX (DECISION MATRIX)
Too many people do nothing because they have so much to do that it over­
whelms them.
Definition
A selection matrix, also known as a decision matrix, is a chart that 
systematically identifies and rates the strength of relationships 
between information so that they can be analyzed. It is used for 
examining large numbers of factors and ranking them in order of 
importance.
Just the Facts
The selection matrix is frequently implemented in planning quality activi­
ties to set goals and develop process flows. It is useful in selecting alterna­
tive solutions. (See Table 9.3)
Example
The steps in implementing a selection or decision matrix are:
• Identify the possible alternatives.
• Agree on the decision/selection criteria.
• Evaluate each criterion and assign a relative weighted value.
• Establish a scoring system.
• Identify and rank the alternatives.
• Total the scores.

SIPOC DIAGRAM

Definition
A SIPOC diagram is a tool used by a team to identify all relevant ele­
ments of a process improvement project before work begins. It helps 
define a complex project that may not be well scoped.
Just the Facts
There are two approaches to understanding the present process: One is 
descriptive and the other is graphic. A good way to understand the process 
is to describe it. One benefit of describing the process is that it sometimes 
leads to the discovery of obvious problems and solutions that can be fixed 
quickly. A flowchart of the process is particularly helpful in obtaining an 
understanding of how the process works because it provides a visual picture.

There are four types of flowcharts that are particularly useful:
• Top-down flowchart
• Deployment matrix flowchart
• Process map
• SIPOC diagram
Of the four types, the SIPOC diagram method is the one that is most 
often used. The SIPOC diagram will assist with improvements and sim­
plification by providing:
• A high-level description of the business process addressed by the project.
• An accurate picture of how work is currently done in order to pin­
point the location or source of error as precisely as possible by build­
ing a factual understanding of the current process conditions.
• Knowledge that will allow the problem solvers to narrow the range 
of potential causes to be investigated. The key is to understand how 
the process presently works. Before the Six Sigma Team (SST) can 
attempt to improve the process, it must understand how it works 
now and what it is supposed to do.
The team should ask and answer key questions:
• What does the process do?
• What are the stages of the process?
• What are the starting and finishing points of the process?
• What are the inputs and outputs from the process?
• Who are the suppliers and customers of the process?
• Who uses the product and who pays for it?
• Are there obvious problems with the process?
A SIPOC diagram shows only the essential steps in a process without detail. 
Because it focuses on the steps that provide real value, it is particularly useful 
in helping the team to focus on those steps that must be performed in the final 
“improved” process. The SIPOC diagram provides a picture of the process 
that the team can use to work on and simplify. It allows people to focus on 
what should happen instead of what does happen. Usually, most processes 
have evolved in an ad hoc manner. When problems have occurred, the pro­
cess has been fixed. The end result is that a simple process has evolved into 
something complex. A flowchart is a first step to simplify things.
The SIPOC diagram is impressively astute at identifying the part in 
the process that affects customer satisfaction the most. It illustrates the 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  365
upstream inputs to the process as well as the outputs and the customers 
served. This global view assists in identifying exactly where to make base­
line measurements.
Two examples illustrate how a SIPOC diagram can keep the focus on the 
performance of the inputs and outputs so glaring problems can be identi­
fied. (See Figures 9.14 and 9.15.)
This is useful because it shows who is responsible for each activity, how 
they fit into the flow of work, and how they relate to others in accomplishing 
the overall job. To construct a SIPOC diagram, you list the major steps in

Capturing the as-is picture of an organization’s processes is important 
because it allows a company to be ready for project selection and the intro­
duction of Six Sigma tools and Six Sigma certification. If done correctly, 
defining the current state of a company’s processes can help break down 
strategic focus areas into project ideas. In early Six Sigma deployments, 
often project scopes are too large, causing excessive project cycle times 
and loss of internal organizational support. The goal should be ensuring 
that high-value, well-scoped projects are identified and linked to the com­
pany’s strategic objectives. This is the importance of project identifica­
tion and process mapping: It allows an organization to better understand 
all the steps, critical inputs and outputs, and product and information 
flows from supplier to customer. Armed with a detailed and shared visual 
understanding of how work actually occurs, the organization can more 
easily identify project ideas for improvement.
Once projects are identified, a discussion with key stakeholders can 
take place to validate initial findings and prioritize projects. This healthy 
discussion allows individuals to come together and objectively discuss 
ongoing activities and gaps. Not only will many Lean Six Sigma projects 
be identified, but other projects that the organization could address will 
come to light. For the Six Sigma project ideas selected, team charters can 
be drafted that provide the business case for each project and serve as the 
guiding framework for improvement efforts. It also is at this point that 
baseline metrics are established, allowing one to track project and process 
improvement performance, but it all starts with mapping the current state.
The SIPOC Approach Expanded
As previously discussed, the purpose of mapping an organization’s current 
process is to position the organization to quickly define, document, analyze, 
prioritize, and recommend solutions and follow-up plans to move the com­
pany toward its financial- and customer-focused goals. Any process mapping 
activity starts with a simple assessment that can be conducted by interview­
ing the key stakeholders of the processes. A key activity for this assessment is 
capturing those critical to quality (CTQ) factors of internal clients’ processes 
and services to their customers. This lays the foundation for collecting data, 
developing metrics to measure success, and ultimately building value stream 
maps. But before a company can leverage the Six Sigma process to identify 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  367
and execute critical process improvement initiatives—let alone do detailed 
mapping techniques such as value stream mapping—it needs to capture the 
basics from initial interviews and assessment. This is where one would use a 
SIPOC diagram, and this initial phase of process mapping is the foundation 
leveraged throughout the initial phase of a Six Sigma deployment. Think of 
the SIPOC as a simple process mapping tool used to map the entire chain of 
events from trigger to delivery of the target process.
Basically the SIPOC diagram used is a combination of matrix, flow­
chart, and summarization and includes:
• Suppliers: Significant internal/external suppliers to the process.
• Inputs: Significant inputs to the process, like material, forms, infor­
mation, etc.
• Process: One block representing the entire process.
• Outputs: Significant outputs to internal/external customers.
• Customers: Significant internal/external customers to the process.
A SIPOC diagram helps to identify the process outputs and the custom­
ers of those outputs so that the voice of the customer can be captured. 
When mapping the detailed level of the SIPOC diagram, one can choose 
the swim lane or other related method. A swim lane flowchart is a type of 
process flow diagram that depicts where and who is working on a particu­
lar activity or subset of the process. (See Figure 9.16.)
The swim lane flowchart differs from other flowcharts in that processes 
and decisions are grouped visually by placing them in lanes. Parallel lines 
divide the chart into lanes, with one lane for each person or group. Lanes 
are arranged either horizontally or vertically, and labeled to show how the 
chart is organized.
This method requires that the business unit capture all information 
without directly relating it to a certain process, output, etc., similar to a 
brainstorming session. This method works best with high-level mapping 
and is vertical in nature. The swim lane method is best suited for lower-
detail-level mapping. Swim lanes allow the business unit to capture all 
information directly related to a specific process, output, etc. This method 
requires more space and several mapping sessions due to the amount of 
time required to map each process; it is horizontal in nature.
A team should initially avoid the swim lane flowchart unless the objec­
tive is detailed lower-level mapping, as this method takes many hours and 
sessions to complete.

368  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Part of the power of the SIPOC diagram is that it is simple to do, 
but it is full of information that allows the participants in a process to 
learn together. This enables them to come to consensus, not only about 
the makeup of the SIPOC diagram itself, but on the lessons learned and 
opportunities as well. Places in the processes for potential improvement 
can then be discussed and prioritized in a nonthreatening fashion. By 
having the business units participate in the session and rank/prioritize 
opportunities together, they tend to be clearer and more descriptive in a 
shorter period of time. So, the SIPOC diagram acts as a dynamic tool to 
create dialogue and acceptance of a new approach to change, in addition 
to simply capturing the as-is state.

Building a SIPOC Diagram
When creating a SIPOC diagram, a SST does not necessarily begin at the 
beginning. The team should more likely start in the middle and ask ques­
tions about the process itself. The team may label the process with the sum­
maries of the most critical three to six steps. Next is documenting what is 
delivered to whom. The team can brainstorm and prioritize the most criti­
cal one to three customers and identify, prioritize, and align the outputs 
most significant to those customers. Later, the team can verify these initial 
assumptions with voice-of-the-customer tools from the Six Sigma process 
and/or designate them as critical to quality, speed, or cost. Finally, the team 
can identify what input or information is needed to perform that process 
and who provides that input. This brainstorming and prioritization of sig­
nificant inputs finishes the activities around building a SIPOC diagram.
The following are some further concepts about building a SIPOC 
diagram:
• Outputs: Outputs are defined as anything the business unit distrib­
utes. Frequency/timing is listed along with the output. Examples of 
outputs would be reports, ratings, products, documents, etc.
• Recipients (customers): A recipient is defined as anyone who receives 
outputs. It is important to note that the recipient must get the output 
directly from the business unit and does not necessarily have to be 
a user of the output. If the output is received from a third party, it 
is not a recipient. Examples of recipients would be a manager, CEO, 
board of directors, or another department.
• Triggers: Triggers are anything that starts the business unit’s process. A 
trigger could be the receipt of a report, a certain day of the month, etc.
• Estimated time: The estimated time is how long it takes to complete 
process steps—this can be continuous, days, weeks, years, etc.
• Fail points: Fail points are ranked/prioritized and then numbered 
based on the priority.
In the end, the reason a SST frequently begins with building a SIPOC dia­
gram as a first step in the process mapping exercise is threefold in nature:
	
1.	A SIPOC diagram quickly and easily captures the current or as-is 
state of the organization and processes in question.
	
2.	The SIPOC exercise brings associates together in a nonthreatening 
way that builds teamwork and momentum to the cause around cul­
ture and learning about Six Sigma.

370  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
	
3.	The SIPOC exercise allows the team to review all the processes in a 
manner in which next steps can be identified, and limited resources 
assigned during the next phase of the rollout to those processes with an 
objectively identified listing of the most critical project opportunities.
Example: Mama Mia Case Study
One of our first steps was to go out and ask our customers what they liked 
and didn’t like about Mama Mia’s. Surveys, focus groups, and follow-up 
interviews with customers identified their most important requirements 
as fresh-tasting pizzas on time. Then we interviewed our internal custom­
ers, including the food preparation personnel, the VP procurement, the 
VP food and beverage, and delivery personnel. They indicated that hav­
ing enough supplies on hand to fill orders and freshness were important 
requirements. (See Figure 9.17.)
But we had to redefine our terms to clearly understand what a botched 
delivery meant. To us, it was whenever the right pizza didn’t get to the 
right house. We felt if we made a mistake, but eventually fixed it, that was 
still a successful mission. By our count, we were getting it right about 97% 
of the time, which is 3.4 sigma. For Mama Mia’s customers, a botched 
delivery was whenever they received anything less than a perfect pizza the

of the time. We had a problem: How to get the pizza to the customers on 
time, every time? (See Figure 9.18.)
The VP of procurement creates and places a weekly order from Pizza 
Supplies R Us. She negotiates for price and quantity of the order. The 
order is scheduled to be delivered to Mama Mia’s warehouse. The order is 
tracked and received at the warehouse and is unloaded. (See Figure 9.19.)

Mama Mia’s SIPOC—Food Storage Process
The VP of food and beverage checks the order for completeness and fresh­
ness. The stock is put into inventory. The pizza supplies are inspected 
weekly for freshness. The food and beverage VP determines if the food 
is within shelf life, disposes of spoiled food, and notifies the VP procure­
ment of any spoiled items within shelf life. (See Figure 9.20.)
Mama Mia’s SIPOC—Food Preparation and Order Delivery
The store manager orders supplies from the warehouse. The supplies are 
delivered and checked for completeness. The food preparation personnel 
stock and refrigerate food supplies. The customer places his or her order on 
the phone or in person and provides address if needed. The food prepara­
tion person provides cost and estimated delivery time. The pizza is baked, 
boxed, and assigned to the delivery person, who scopes out the directions 
from an old plastic map. The pizza is delivered and money is collected. The 
delivery person returns to the store. (See Figure 9.21.)

SWOT—STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, 
OPPORTUNITIES, AND THREATS
Winners win because they know their weaknesses and plan so that they 
are not a factor.
Definition
SWOT analysis is a strategic planning method that evaluates the 
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats that will be 
encountered in a project or in a business venture. It starts by speci­
fying the objective of the business venture or project and identifying 
the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable 
to achieve that objective. The SWOT technique is credited to Albert 
Humphrey, from Stanford University, who devised the technique by 
studying data from Fortune 500 companies from the 1960s through 
the 1970s.
Just the Facts
A SWOT analysis starts by defining a desired objective. Strategic planning 
should incorporate a SWOT analysis as part of the planning. The elements 
of SWOT can be defined as:
S—Strengths: The elements of the business that constitute its advantages.
W—Weaknesses: The disadvantages that a business has.
O—Opportunities: The chances of achieving greater profits in the market.
T—Threats: Market elements that could be problematic to achieving the 
desired results.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  375
The SWOT Matrix
The SWOT analysis can be placed into a matrix of these factors. An exam­
ple of a SWOT matrix is shown in Table 9.4.
Example
Strengths are resources and capabilities that form a basis for developing a 
competitive advantage such as:
• Patents
• Brand recognition
• Positive customer base
• Proprietary knowledge
• Access to distribution networks
Weaknesses are an absence of strengths such as:
• Patent protection liabilities
• Negative customer recognition
• High cost
• Poor distribution
Weakness may be the antithesis of strength.

O-S strategies describe opportunities that build on the com­
pany’s strengths.
O-W strategies identify weaknesses and means of overcom­
ing them.
T-S strategies identify how to use the company’s strengths to 
reduce external threats.
T-W strategies define plans to prevent the weaknesses from 
achieving the goal.

376  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Opportunities come from an evaluation of the marketplace, customer 
desires, and competitor strengths, which will give indications for profit 
and growth opportunities. Some examples are:
• A customer-indicated need that is not met
• Implementation of new technologies
• International trade barriers
• Regulations
Threats may consist of changes in the marketplace that threaten the 
company’s products or services. Some examples are:
• Changes in consumer desires and wants
• Introduction of competitor products
• Changes in regulations
• Changes in trade barriers

TAKT TIME
When people are out of balance, they fall. When a process is out of balance, 
it fails.
Definition
Takt is a German word meaning “beat.” It refers to matching the 
rate of production to customer demand. This is a starting point to 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  377
balancing the work flow. Takt time can be first determined with 
the formula:
	
T = Ta
Td
where:
	 T =	Takt time, e.g., minutes of work/unit produced
	Ta =	Net time available to work, e.g., minutes of work/day
	Td =	Time demand (customer demand), e.g., units required/day
Net available time is the amount of time available for work to be done. 
This excludes break times and any expected stoppage time (for exam­
ple, scheduled maintenance, team briefings, etc.).
Just the Facts
If you have five steps in a process that take different times to complete, 
then the process is gated by the process step that takes the longest time. 
For example, if the process steps take A = 13, B = 9, C = 10, D = 12, and 
E = 18 minutes, respectively, then process step B will be waiting for process 
step A, and the entire process is gated by process step E, which requires the 
longest time. This means that the work-in-process (WIP) will increase and 
the overall flow is slowed.
Takt time is used to balance work flow across work steps and to meet 
demand. Roughly translated, Takt is a German word meaning “beat.” 
Producing to the pace of customer demand (no faster, no slower), when 
the work steps are in balance, this produces maximum productivity and 
saves cost. When you have total processing time, all you need is cus­
tomer demand to calculate Takt time. Takt gives you a starting point to 
think about balancing the workload across work steps. (See Figure 9.22.)
Each work step in a process should operate as close to Takt time as pos­
sible without going over. If your process has four operations that take 10, 
13, 12, and 17 minutes in that order, work step 4 is holding up the process. 
As seen above, when you have work steps that are faster than the slowest 
Takt time

step, and they precede the slowest step, WIP is increased and overall pro­
duction is slowed. A rebalancing of the work in such a way as to have 
each work step function as close as possible to each other will improve 
efficiency.
To get the Takt all the time for a process, you start by calculating the two 
individual elements of the formula above. First, you determine the portal 
available processing time for the process. If the process has two shifts per 
day, and each shift is 8 hours long, the total available time is not 16 hours 
per process. You must deduct any downtime, such as lunch breaks for 
employees. Each shift may have downtime for breaks and perhaps for tail­
gate meetings. If each shift has a 1-hour lunch and two breaks, you must 
deduct 3 hours of downtime from the total shift time. In this example this 
would be 13 hours of production time.
The other variable that is required is customer demand, and if customer 
demand is 600 units per month and the organization is working 5-day weeks 
(most often 21 productive days per month), processes must complete 29 units 
per day using both shifts. Takt for this process is 0.45 hours per unit.
Once you determine Takt time, you attempt to adjust your process speed 
so that all work steps are as close to Takt time as possible without exceed­
ing them. Operations vary in the amount of work assigned to them and 
can also be very inefficient.
Redistribution of the work to come up with a well-spaced balanced flow 
process is the goal. You should consider two general approaches to achieve 
Takt time to route your process: move work from one station to another, 
or change the number of stations or operations in the process.
There are four approaches that should be considered when attempting to 
balance work steps in a process:
• If the process has a small amount of variation, it may be possible 
to redistribute the work more evenly by assigning uniform slack 
time. Slack time is the time not being used by the faster work steps 
in the process. For instance, if the slowest step in the process is 
10 minutes and the fastest step in the process is 7 minutes, the 
7-minute process has 3 minutes of slack time. If the average work 
time (7 minutes) is below Takt time (for example, 8 minutes), you 
have 1 minute per unit to work with. If production is 60 units per 
day, then you have 1 hour of time that might be redistributed to the 

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  379
slower work step. This begins balancing the two work steps, speed­
ing up the slower work step, and making the faster work step more 
efficient.
• When large amounts of variation exist, you can use a relatively sim­
ple way to rebalance the process. You can reassign the work so that 
any slack time comes off the end of the process.
• When there are small amounts of variation, it may be possible to 
eliminate a work step for work consolidation. For example, instead of 
four work steps you now have three. If this can be done within Takt 
time, the savings this represents makes it much better.
• If, when examining the work, it is found that there is significant 
opportunity for making the work itself more efficient and improv­
ing the process, efficiency should be your first choice. Then, reassess 
your Takt time and, if necessary, begin balancing the work across 
the process.
Example
To get the Takt time, follow these steps:
	
1.	Determine the available processing time.
• Count all shifts.
• Deduct any downtime:
−
−Breaks
−
−Lunch
−
−Clean-up
−
−Shift change meetings
• This will yield the available processing time.
	
2.	Determine the customer demand.
• If the customer wants 1,000 units
• If the company works 5 days/week (21 days/month)
−
−Production rate should deliver 48 units per day
	
3.	If we assume:
• Effective production time to be 13 hours/day
• 48 units required per day
• Takt time will be 0.62 hour/unit

THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS (TOC)
There always has to be a limiting factor. All you have to do is find and 
eliminate it.
Definition
Theory of constraints (TOC) is a management philosophy that Dr. 
Eliyahu M. Goldratt introduced in 1984. It is designed to help organi­
zations continually achieve their goals. The term TOC comes from the 
concept that any manageable system is limited by a very small number 
of constraints, and that there is always at least one constraint.
Just the Facts
A constraint is anything that prevents a system from achieving its goal. 
While there are many types of constraints, there are only a few constraints 
that are the principle constraints.
Constraints may be internal or external to the process. Internal con­
straints could be when production can’t keep up with customer demand. 
External constraints could manifest in the problem of producing more 
than the marketplace demands.
Types of (Internal) Constraints
• Equipment: Equipment limitations in its ability to produce more 
goods or services.
• People: Poorly trained people.
• Processes: Processes that limit the production capability.

Black Belt Nonstatistical Tools (R through Z)  •  381
TOC focuses on the mechanism for management of the system. In opti­
mizing the system, constraints are specifically expressed in order to limit 
the scope of implementation.
Example
For operations, the goal is to “pull” materials through the processes instead 
of pushing them.
For supply chain the goal is to focus on use of supplies instead of replen­
ishing supplies.
For finance and accounting, the goal is focused on the effect each step in 
the process has on the overall throughput.
For project management, the goal is focused on the critical path of 
the process, also referred to as the critical chain project management 
(CCPM).

TREE DIAGRAMS
In QC, we try as far as possible to make our various judgments based on the 
facts, not on guesswork. Our slogan is Speak with Facts.
—Katsuya Hosotani
Definition
Tree diagrams are a systematic approach that helps you think about 
each phase or aspect of solving a problem, reaching a target, or achiev­
ing a goal. It is also called the “systematic diagram.”

382  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook﻿
Just the Facts
This approach systematically maps the details of sub- or smaller activities 
required to complete a project, resolve an issue, or reach a primary goal. 
This task is accomplished by starting with a key problem or issue and then 
developing the branches on the tree into different levels of detail. The tree 
diagram is most often used when a complete understanding of the task is 
required (i.e., what must be accomplished, how it is to be completed, and 
the relationships between goals and actions). It can be used at the begin­
ning of the problem-solving process to assist in analyzing a particular 
issue’s root causes prior to data collection. It can also be used in the final 
stages of the process to provide detail to a complex implementation plan, 
allowing for a more manageable approach to the individual elements. Tree 
diagrams are also used in:
• Strategic planning
• Policy development
• Project management
• Change management
The application of this tool is to logically branch out (flowchart) lev­
els of detail on projects, problems, causes, or goals to be achieved. (See 
Figure 9.23.)
FIGURE 9.23

There are basically two types of tree diagrams:
• Components-development tree diagram: Typically used in the early 
stages of the problem-solving process when analyzing a particular 
problem and trying to establish the root causes prior to data col­
lection. (This is also known as the “ask why” diagram.) It refers 
to the components or elements of the work being performed. (See 
Figure 9.24.)
	
	
Steps to completing this type of diagram are relatively simple:
	
1.	 State the problem or issue so everyone on the team is in agree­
ment on its meaning. Put that statement in the box on the left of 
the diagram.
	
2.	 By asking why, identify the causes believed to contribute to the 
problem or issue. Place these causes in a box to the right of the 
problem or issue. Link them with a line pointing to the cause.
	
3.	 Repeat step 2 and continue to develop more causes until a key or 
root cause is identified.

• Plan-development tree diagram: Used toward the end of the prob­
lem-solving process to provide detail to the individual elements 
of the implementation plan. (This is also known as the “ask how” 
diagram.) It helps to identify the tasks required to accomplish a 
goal and the hierarchical relationships between the tasks. (See 
Figure 9.25.)
	
	
The plan-development tree diagram is developed much the same 
as the component-development diagram. The difference is here we 
are trying to provide detail to a particular goal or element of a plan. 
In step 2, instead of asking “why” you would ask “how” the goal can 
be achieved. The following are the steps:
	
1.	 State the goal or element so everyone on the team is in agreement on 
its meaning. Put that statement in the box on the left of the diagram.
	
2.	 By asking “how,” identify how the goal, task, or element may be 
achieved. Place this information in a box to the right of the goal/
element. Link them with a line pointing to the cause.
	
3.	 Repeat step 2 and continue to develop more detail on the rela­
tionship of the task or element, or until the appropriate level of 
detail has been provided on achieving the goal.

Definition
Value stream mapping is a technique used to analyze the flow of mate­
rials through a process from beginning to delivery to the customer. 
This process originated at Toyota, where it is known as material and 
information flow mapping.
Just the Facts
The process starts with creating a flowchart of the existing process and 
then identifying areas in the process that cause delays in the continuous 
flow of information or product. These areas are assessed and plans are put 
in place to eliminate these areas of waste.
Implementation involves the following steps:
• Identify the process to be evaluated.
• Construct a flowchart of the current process (current state value 
stream map) to identify:
• Current steps
• Delays
• Information flows required:
−
−Raw materials
−
−Design flow
−
−Handling
−
−Storage
• Evaluate the current state value stream map flow to eliminate waste.
• Construct a future state value stream map.
• Implement plans to move toward the future state process flow.
Example
Symbols have been developed to help in the process evaluation. An exam­
ple from www.valuebasedmanagement.net/methods_value_stream_map­
ping.html appears in Figure 9.27. An example of a current and future state 
value stream map from the same source is seen in Figure 9.28.

LSSBB Advanced 
Statistical Tools
INTRODUCTION
One of the key things that sets the LSSBB apart from the SSGB is the depth 
of statistical knowledge the LSSBB has acquired. We recognize that many 
of the people who want to be able to classify themselves or be certified 
as a LSSBB are less interested in learning complex statistical tools like 
design of experiments. They may not even use them in the organizational 
assignment they have right now. However, at some later date they may 
change organizations or even jobs within the same organization, and if 
they include being certified as an LSSBB as one of their skills, they will 
need to understand these statistical tools or they will be misrepresenting 
themselves to their new employer.
One of the basic concepts of Six Sigma is collecting data and using hard 
data to make business and improvement decisions. We call it “managing 

390  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
by facts—not hunch.” All too often decisions are made based upon false or 
unfounded data that are presented to management as facts. Through the 
use of these statistical tools you will be able to qualify and quantify the 
information you are using to make business decisions.
Another reason you need to master the use of statistical problem-solving 
tools is because many, if not all, of the problems we face today are com­
plex in nature. These problems are not caused by one root cause, but by 
the interaction of many root causes, and correcting only one of the root 
causes could even make the problem worse. Often taking action to solve 
each of the root causes independently becomes far more expensive than 
correcting how they interface and interact with each other. Through the 
use of tools like design of experiments, the Six Sigma Team can look at 
the interaction between the root causes and understand which root cause 
or combination of root causes has the biggest impact upon the problem 
they are analyzing. Relying on the hit-or-miss approach to solving these 
complex problems may take two to three times longer to come up with a 
solution that is only 50% as effective as the one you can get through the 
use of the statistical tools.
As an SSGB, you should have been introduced to the following statisti­

ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA)—ONE-WAY
Less is always better.

396  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Definition
ANOVA (analysis of variance) tests the null hypothesis that the sam­
ples in two or more groups are drawn from the same population by 
comparing their variations.
Just the Facts
When we don’t know the population means, an analysis of data samples is 
required. ANOVA is usually used to determine if there is a statistically sig­
nificant change in the mean of a Critical To Quality (CTQ) characteristic 
under two or more conditions introduced by one factor.
The hypothesis statement:
H0: μ1 = μ2 = … = μn
Ha: μ1 ≠ μ1 for at least one pair (i, j)
This is the model where Yij is the (ij)th observation of the CTQ charac­
teristic (i = 1, 2, …, g and j = 1, 2, …, n, for g levels of size n), μ is the overall 
mean, τi is the ith-level effect, and εij is an error component.
	
Y = μ + τi + εi

“Source” indicates the different variation sources decomposed in the 
ANOVA table. “Factor” represents the variation introduced between 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  397
the factor levels. “Error” is the variation within each of the factor 
levels. “Total” is the total variation in the CTQ characteristic.
DF: The number of degrees of freedom related to each sum of square 
(SS). They are the denominators of the estimate of variance.
SS: The sums of squares measure the variability associated with each 
source. They are the variance estimate’s numerators. Factor SS is 
due to the change in factor levels. The larger the difference between 
the means of factor levels, the larger the factor sum of squares will 
be. Error SS is due to the variation within each factor level. Total SS 
is the sum of the factor and error sum of squares (see tool Sum of 
Squares).
MS: Mean square is the estimate of the variance for the factor and error 
sources. Computed by MS = SS/DF.
F: The ratio of the mean square for the factor and the mean square for 
the error.
p value: This value has to be compared with the alpha level (α), and the 
following decision rule is used: If P < α, reject H0 and accept Ha with 
(1 – P)100% confidence; if P ≥ α, don’t reject H0.
The assumption for using this tool is that the data come from indepen­
dent random samples taken from normally distributed populations, with 
the same variance. When using ANOVA, we are using a model where its 
adequacy has to be verified using residual analysis.
Example
	
1.	Analyze the data with Minitab:
• Verify the assumption of equality of variance for all the lev­
els with the function under Stat > ANOVA > Homogeneity of 
Variance (to interpret this analysis, see tool Homogeneity of 
Variance Tests).
• Use the function under Stat > ANOVA > One Way.
• Input the name of the column, which contains the measurement 
of the CTQ characteristic into the “Response” field, and the name 
of the column that contains the level codes into the “Factor” field.
• In order to verify the assumption of the model, select the options 
“Store Residuals” and “Store Fits.” Select the “graphs” option and 
highlight all the available residual plots (to interpret these plots 
see tool Residual Plots).

398  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• In the event of noncompliance with either of these assumptions, 
the results of the analysis of variance may be distorted. In this case, 
the use of graphical tools, such as a Box plot, can be used to depict 
the location of the means and the variation associated with each 
factor level. In the case of outliers, these should be investigated.
	
2.	Make a statistical decision from the session window output of Minitab. 
Either accept or reject H0. When H0 is rejected, we can conclude that 
there is a significant difference between the means of the levels.
	
3.	Translate the statistical conclusion into a practical decision about the 
CTQ characteristic.
ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA)—TWO-WAY
Definition
An extension to the one-way analysis of variance where there are two 
independent variables.
Just the Facts
Two-way ANOVA is used to analyze the effect of two random factors on a 
CTQ. A factor is said to be random when levels are randomly chosen from 
a population of possible levels and we wish to draw conclusions about the 
entire population of levels, not just those used in the study. For example, 
this type of analysis is generally used in gauge R&R studies.
	
Yijk = μ + τi + βj + (τβ)ij + εijk
	
V(Yijk) = στ
2 + σβ
2 + στβ
2 + σ2
	
H0: στ
2 = 0  Ha: στ
2 >0
	
H0: σβ
2 = 0  Ha: σβ
2 >0
	
H0: στβ
2 = 0  Ha: στβ
2 >0
where Yijk is the (ijk) observation of the characteristic (i = 1, 2, …, a, j = 1, 
2, …, b, k = 1, 2, …, n) for a level of factor A, b levels for factor B, and n the 
number of observations in each of the combination of the factor levels. 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  399
μ represents the overall mean, τi (tau i) the effect of factor A, βj (beta j) 
the effect of factor B, (τβ)ij the interaction effect between A and B, and εijk 
(epsilon ijk) the error component. For example, with a gauge R&R study 
factor A can be the operator, factor B the parts, and the interaction is 
the interaction between the operators and the parts. In this case, a will 
be the number of operators, b the number of parts, and n the number of 
repeated measurements. The variance (V) of any observation (Yijk) where 
στ
2, σβ
2, στβ
2, and σ2 are called variance components. The ratio of the 
variances of each sample are compared against a table based on each 
sample size to determine if the two variances are significantly different 
at a given confidence level. For each effect, if H0 is true, the levels are 
similar, but if Ha is true, variability exists between the levels
Major Considerations
For a random effect model, we assume that the levels of the two factors are 
chosen at random from a population of levels. The data should come from 
independent random samples taken from normally distributed popula­
tions. The adequacy of this model has to be verified using residual analysis.
Example
	
1.	Define problem and state the objective of the study.
	
2.	Identify the two factors for study, and the levels associated with these 
factors. For example, in a gauge R&R study, the factors are parts and 
operators, and generally the number of levels for the parts is 10 and 
the number of levels for the operators is 3.
	
3.	Establish sample size.
	
4.	Measure the CT characteristic.
	
5.	Analyze data with Minitab.
BOX PLOTS
This is one box that you will want to stay inside of.

400  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Definition
A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker diagram or plot, is a 
graphical way of showing groups of data using five numerical sum­
maries. They are:
• The smallest observation (sample minimum)
• The lower 25% (quartile)
• The median
• The upper 25% (quartile)
• The largest observation (sample maximum)
A box plot may also indicate which observations, if any, might be con­
sidered outliers.
Just the Facts
Box plots are one of the more effective graphical summaries of a data set; 
the box plot generally shows mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, 
and outliers. A standard box plot is composed of the median, upper hinge, 
lower hinge, higher adjacent value, lower adjacent value, outside values, 
and far-out values. An example is shown in Figure 10.1. Parallel box plots 
are very useful for comparing distributions.

Example
Box plots provide a plot tool for viewing the behavior of a data set or for 
comparing multiple data sets. They are very good for viewing smaller data 
sets where histograms tend not to do as well. The chart in Figure 10.2 plots 
the same data set over time week by week. It is easy to see the process 
output is not the same week to week. Here we observe that the mean is 
not moving as much as the data are skewing to the right. While we see 
the skewing taking place, it does not appear that it is related to one of 
the two operators. Next, we see box plots by the subgroup of machine 
(Figures 10.3 and 10.4). It is now visually clear that Machine 1 is “drift­
ing” right, explaining the skewing. Also, Machine 1 is responsible for the 
increase in variance.

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
If you do not have confidence in the data, don’t use it.
Definition
The confidence interval allows the organization to estimate the true 
population parameter with a known degree of certainty.
Just the Facts
It is very costly and inefficient to measure every unit of product, service, or 
information produced. A sampling plan is implemented and statistics such 
as the average, standard deviation, and proportion are calculated and used 
to make inferences about the population parameters. Unfortunately, when

a known population is sampled many times, the calculated sample averages 
can be different even though the population is stable. (See Figure 10.5.)
The differences in these sample averages are simply due to the nature of 
random sampling. Given that these differences exist, the key is to estimate the 
true population parameter. The confidence interval allows the organization 
to estimate the true population parameter with a known degree of certainty.
The confidence interval is bounded by a lower limit and upper limit that 
are determined by the risk associated with making a wrong conclusion 
about the parameter of interest. For example, if the 95% confidence inter­
val is calculated for a subgroup of data of sample size n, and the lower 
confidence limit and the upper confidence limit are determined to be 85.2 
and 89.3, respectively, it can be stated with 95% certainty that the true 
population average lies between these values. Conversely, there is a 5% risk 
(alpha (α) = 0.05) that this interval does not contain the true population 
average. The 95% confidence interval could also show that:
• Ninety-five of 100 subgroups collected with the same sample size n 
would contain the true population average.
• If another 100 subgroups were collected, 95 of the subgroups’ aver­
ages would fall within the upper and lower confidence limits.

We are interested in knowing, with 90% certainty, the average per­
cent cross-linking of a polymer resin. Twenty samples were selected and 
tested. The average percent cross-linking was found to be 68% with a 
standard deviation of 15.6%. The confidence interval for the mean µ 
would be:
	
68 – 1.73(15.6/√20) ≤ μ ≤ 68 + 1.73(15.6/√20)
	
68 – 1.73(3.488266) ≤ μ ≤ 68 + 1.73(3.488266)

Caution: Some software and texts will reverse the direction of reading the

Confidence Interval for the Proportion Defective
For proportion defective (p) we use the binomial distribution; however, 
in this example the normal approximation will be used. The normal 
approximation to the binomial may be used when np and n(1 – p) are 
greater than or equal to 5. A statistical software package will use the 
binomial distribution.

Example
We want to know, with 95% certainty, the current proportion defective for 
product measurement forms. Twelve hundred forms were sampled and 14 
of these were deemed to be defective. The 95% confidence interval for the 
proportion defective would be:
	
0.012 – 1.96√((0.012(1 – 0.012)/1,200) ≤ P ≤ 0.012 + 1.96
	
√((0.012(1 – 0.012)/1,200)
	
0.012 – 0.006 ≤ P ≤ 0.012 + 0.006
	
0.006 ≤ P ≤ 0.018
	
0.60% ≤ P ≤ 1.80%
Note:  np  = 1,200 (0.12) = 14.4, which is > 5, and n(1 – p) = 1,200 (0.988) = 
1,185.6, which is > 5, so the normal approximation to the binomial may be used.

DATA TRANSFORMATIONS
Data is worthless until it is analyzed.
Definition
When data do not follow a normal distribution, thus allowing us to 
calculate basic statistics and valid probabilities related to the popu­
lation (mean, standard deviation, Z values, probabilities for defects, 
yield, etc.), the data need to be transformed into a normal distribution 
prior to analysis.
Just the Facts
If the distribution is non-normal, then the analysis may be misleading or 
incorrect due to the violation of the normality and equal variance assump­
tions. A transformation function can often be used to convert the data 
closer to a normal distribution to meet the assumptions and allow for a 
determination of statistical significance. Transformation use may be indi­
cated by nonrandom patterns in the residuals of a regression, ANOVA, or 
DoE analysis.
A transformation function converts a non-normal distribution to a 
normal distribution. Caution must be used by the analyst in interpreting 
transformed data that have no physical significance
Data Transformation Types
It is often difficult to determine which transformation function to use for 
the data given. Many people decide which function to use by trial and 
error, using the standard transformation functions. For each function or 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  407
combination of functions, the transformed data can be checked for nor­
mality using the Anderson-Darling test.
A transformation function can incorporate any one or combination of 
the following equations, or may use additional ones not listed.
Standard Transformation Functions
Moderately positive skewness	
Square root:	
x = SQRT(X)
Substantially positive skewness	
Logarithmic:	
x = log10 x, ln x, etc.
Substantially positive skewness
    (with zero values)	
Logarithmic:	
x = log10(x + c)
Moderately negative skewness	
    Square root:	
X = SQRT(K – X)
Substantially negative skewness	 Logarithmic (log 10)	  X = log10(K – X)
Reciprocal of data: ................................................................. x = 1/x
Square of data: ........................................................................ x = X2
There is also benefit in transforming specific distributions such as count 
data. This type of data often has a nonconstant variance (Poisson distribu­
tion). Recommended transformations are listed below:
	
X = SQRT(X)
Freeman-Tukey modification to the square root:
	
X = [SQRT(x) + SQRT(c + 1)]/2
Another frequently encountered situation requiring transformation occurs 
when dealing with attribute data. Recommended transformations include:
	
X = Arcsin [SQRT(p)]
Freeman-Tukey modification to arcsin:
	
X = [arcsin(SQRT((np)/(n + 1)) + arcsin(SQRT((np + 1)/n + 1)]/2
By knowing the physics behind a process, the LSSBB can determine the 
appropriate function that describes the process. This function can be used 
to transform the data.

408  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Once the transformation function is found for a given set of data, it can 
be used for additional data collected from the same process. Once a pro­
cess has been modified, however, the distribution may change and become 
normal, or it may become a different type of non-normal distribution. A 
new transformation function may then be needed.
If choosing a transformation is difficult, many software programs will 
perform a Box-Cox transformation on the data. Some common Box-Cox 
transformations are listed in Table 10.1. The table can be used to assess 
the appropriateness of the transformation. For example, the 95% confi­
dence interval for lambda can be used to determine whether the optimum 
lambda value is close to 1, because a lambda of 1 indicates that a transfor­
mation should not be done. If the optimum lambda is close to 1, very little 
would be gained by performing the transformation.
As another example, if the optimum lambda is close to 0.5, the square 
root of the data could simply be calculated, because this transformation is 
simple and understandable. (Note: In some cases, one of the closely com­
peting values of lambda may end up having a slightly smaller standard 
deviation than the estimate chosen.)
It is highly recommended that a statistical evaluation program such as 
Minitab or JMP be used to make these calculations.
Example
A data set was evaluated and discovered to be non-normally distrib­
uted. The distribution was positively skewed because the exaggerated tail 
was in the positive direction. Using Minitab, the results are as shown in 
Figure 10.6.

The same data set was evaluated using a Box-Cox transformation 
analysis. The Box-Cox transformation plot is shown in Figure 10.7. In 
this example, the best estimate for lambda is zero or the natural log. (In 
any practical situation, the LSSBB would want a lambda value that cor­
responds to an understandable transformation, such as the square root 
(a lambda of 0.5) or the natural log (a lambda of 0).) Zero is a reasonable 
choice because it falls within the 95% confidence interval and happens to 
be the best estimate of lambda. Therefore, the natural log transformation 
will be used. After performing the recommended transformation on the 
data set, a test for normality was done to validate the transformation.
The normal probability plot (Figure 10.8) of the transformed data can 
be graphically interpreted by the fit of the data to a straight line, or ana­
lytically interpreted from the results of the Anderson-Darling test for nor­
mality. Since the p value (0.346) is greater than the α risk (0.5) we are 
willing to take, there is sufficient evidence that the transformed distribu­
tion is normally distributed.
The original lognormal capability data have been transformed into the nor­
mal distribution shown in Figure 10.9. (The * in the graphic indicates trans­
formed data. For example, the actual USL is 1.50; however, the transformed 
USL is 0.405.) The potential and overall capabilities are now more accurate for 
the process at hand. The use of non-normal data may result in an erroneous 
calculation of predicted proportion out of the specified units. When trans­
forming the capability data, remember that any specification limit must also 
be transformed. (Most software packages will perform this automatically.)

Notice from a comparison of the before and after capability outputs that we 
are only slightly more capable than our original estimate with the lognor­
mal data. There is excessive variation in the process. The primary focus of the 
LSSBB should be to identify and correct the sources of this variation.
If you do not have a program such as Minitab or JMP, and the data fail a 
normality test, then use the following Application Cookbook.
Application Cookbook
Before using a mathematical transformation, apply steps 1 and 2 of the 
Application Cookbook. If the data are not normally distributed (e.g., fail 
the normality test) conduct the following steps:
	
1.	Examine the data to see if there is a nonstatistical explanation for the 
unusual distribution pattern. For example, if data are collected from 
various sources (similar machines or individuals performing the same 
process) and each one has a different mean or standard deviation, then 
the combined output of the sources will have an unusual distribution, 
such as a mixture of the individual distributions. In this case, separate 
analyses could be made for each source (individual, machine, etc.).
	
2.	Analyze the data in terms of averages instead of individual values. 
Sample averages closely follow a normal distribution even if the popu­
lation of individual values from which the sample averages came is not 
normally distributed. If conclusions on a characteristic can be made 
based on the average value, proceed, but remember these only apply to 
the average value and not to the individual values in the population.
	
3.	If steps 1 and 2 do not provide reliable estimates, use the Weibull 
distribution. Consult the Application Cookbook of the tool 
Distribution—Weibull. The resulting straight line can provide esti­
mates of the probabilities for the population.
	
4.	If all above steps fail in providing reliable estimates, use one of the 
most common mathematical transformations, which include:

DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS
The purpose of an experiment is to make nature speak intelligently: All 
that then remains is to LISTEN.
—Bill Diamond (1978)
Definition
Design of experiments (DoE), or experimental design, is the design 
of any information-gathering exercises where variation is pres­
ent, whether under the full control of the experimenter or not. 
However, in statistics, these terms are usually used for controlled 
experiments. Other types of study and their design are discussed 
in published articles on opinion polls and statistical surveys (which 
are types of observational study), natural experiments, and quasi-
experiments (for example, quasi-experimental design). In the design 
of experiments, the experimenter is often interested in the effect of 
some process or intervention (the treatment) on some objects (the 
experimental units), which may be people, parts of people, groups of 
people, plants, animals, materials, etc. There are many tools used in 
design of experiments.
Just the Facts
Statistical experimental design usually means multivariable experimental 
matrices. The primary reason for using statistically designed experiments 
is to obtain a maximum amount of information for a minimum amount 
of expenditure. The fundamental purpose of a designed experiment is to 
determine a course of action. This action results from conclusions drawn 
from an experiment. Many aspects of designing and optimizing a success­
ful process require efficient, accurate experiments:
	
1.	The scientific method, hence all scientific investigation, is built 
around experimentation.

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  415
	
2.	Optimization of process parameters such as material compositions 
or environmental parameters is a duty in setting up a process.
	
3.	Cost savings resulting from fewer experiments, increased investiga­
tor efficiency, and increased output from an optimal process setup 
are usually substantial.
	
4.	Statistical methods for designing experiments allow information to 
be gathered on all factors simultaneously, leading to more economies 
over single-factor experiments.
Steps in Designing an Experiment
An eight-stage procedure formally details the steps to be taken in design­
ing any experiment:
	
1.	Statement of the problem
	
2.	Formulation of hypotheses
	
3.	Planning of the experiment
	
a.	 Choosing an appropriate experimental technique
	
b.	 Examination of possible outcomes to make certain that the 
experiment provides the required information
	
c.	 Consideration of possible results from the point of view of the 
statistical analysis
	
4.	Collection of data (performing the experiment according to the plan)
	
5.	Statistical analysis of the data
	
6.	Drawing conclusions with appropriate significance levels
	
7.	Verification or evaluation of results (conclusions)
	
8.	Drawing final conclusions and recommendations
These eight steps are present in any experiment whether or not it has 
been effectively designed. They indicate only a logical framework for any 
experimental process. To go a step further, a good experiment has several 
requirements. It must possess no systematic error, have small standard or 
experimental error, and a wide range of validity, and allow proper statisti­
cal analysis to apply.
The standard and systematic errors that we wish to minimize can 
be caused by tolerance in the actual experimentation, observation of 

416  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
responses, measurement, variations in experimental materials, or other 
extraneous factors. A good experiment minimizes these by:
	
1.	Using more homogeneous materials
	
2.	Using information provided by related variables
	
3.	Careful experimentation
	
4.	Using more efficient design
Our matrix experiments, since they tend to be large undertakings, 
demand adherence to these general experimental practices.
Principles of an Experimental Design
A requirement list for good experiments therefore includes measurements 
whose accuracy is maximized (as detailed in Chapter 9), sound engi­
neering, and an ability to design our investigation efficiently. There are 
three general principles also essential to a statistically designed matrix 
experiment:
• Randomization: If separate experimental runs are run in random 
order, with no pattern to the factor settings, statistical analysis of 
responses can be conducted without danger of any bias to the experi­
mental unit. The danger if this is not done could be exemplified by 
considering an experiment run in a tube furnace. Suppose the exper­
imenter has not considered temperature a factor, though in reality, 
it plays a part. If one level of material were run in totality first and 
another totally later (instead of randomly ordering the two levels), 
any effect of the materials might be biased by a slow heat-up of the 
furnace.
• Replication: Experimental error—the failure of two identically 
treated experimental units to give the same value. Replication pro­
vides a means of estimating the experimental error, which in turn 
provides a means of testing interactions. Significant process factors 
will produce large changes compared to the difference between rep­
licates. Replication is a repetition of the whole experiment in order 
to estimate experimental error, increase precision (detect smaller 
changes), and increase sensitivity.

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  417
• Local controls: Local controls means experimental planning, refer­
ring to the amount of blocking or balancing of grouped experimen­
tal runs among different settings of variables being studied. The 
purpose of local controls is to make the experimental design more 
efficient, and guard against unforeseen surprises nullifying experi­
mental adjustments.
In summary, replication makes statistical tests possible, randomization 
makes statistical tests valid, and local controls make the experiment more 
efficient. Together these principles can be applied to produce good experi­
ments that can be analyzed using statistical analysis of variance methods. 
We will complete our background with a brief introduction to these meth­
ods, and then study the total process of matrix experimental design in 
various forms through examples.
Setting Up the Appropriate Experiment
The question will lead to an examination of the process with emphasis on 
the elements of the process that have an effect on the resultant product. 
Sometimes the answer can be obtained by simply collecting historical data 
and analyzing them. Sometimes a process control study is appropriate, and 
sometimes a designed experiment is required. The purpose of the experiment 
is to determine how the independent variable of the process affects the depen­
dent parameters of the resultant product. The basic questions to be asked are:
	
1.	What is the purpose of this experiment?
	
a.	 What do I expect to accomplish?
	
b.	 What questions do I expect to answer?
	
2.	What are the independent variables (factors)?
	
a.	 (The variables to be changed or controlled during the experiment)
	
3.	What variables are to be held constant?
	
4.	What are the dependent variables (response(s))?

Analysis (of Means and Variance) Methodologies
The four basic assumptions of the analysis of means and the analysis of 
variance of data from a statistically designed experiment are normality 
of the response variable, additivity of the effects, homogeneity of the vari­
ances, and statistical independence of each response value. The normal­
ity assumption requires that the underlying distribution of the response 
variable outcomes be a normal distribution. However, the analysis of vari­
ance is a “robust” test. This means that false experimental conclusions are 
not generated by departures from normality. Thus, the normality of the 
response variable is not a strict requirement.
The assumption of additivity of the effects means that each response 
value is comprised of the sum of an overall mean plus the sum of all effects 
due to each factor and the sum of all interaction effects among the factors 
and the effects due to experimental error.
The homogeneity of distribution assumption requires that the underly­
ing distributions of replicate readings each have the same variance. This 
is a very strict requirement. The analysis of variance test doesn’t apply if 
this assumption does not hold. Finally, the statistical independence of the 
response variable outcomes assumption states that each response value is 
independent of all previous values. This is guaranteed by randomization 
of the treatment combinations to the test specimens.
When these assumptions are followed, results of a matrix of experi­
mental runs can be economically analyzed together using a statistical test 
known as the Student’s t-test and the F-ratio. These tests compare varia­
tion (in final result) and mean differences caused by a matrix variable to 
normal noise.
Analysis of Means
In the analysis of means, the means are calculated for each set of response 
data, and then these means are compared to each other to determine dif­
ferences. Where a statistical test is required, the Student’s t-test may be 
used to determine if there is a significant difference. The Student’s t-test 

420  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
can be used with distributions that are the same or different. In a mul­
tivariate experiment, it is assumed that all distributions are the same. 
However, there are times when we simply want to evaluate the differ­
ence between two sets of readings, or to qualify two different measure­
ment techniques, or laboratory results, etc. For these “simple comparison” 
tests, there are two analysis techniques that are used: simple comparison 
and paired comparison. In the simple comparison samples are taken and 
measured by two or more procedures and the resultant distributions and 
means are compared using the Student’s t-test to determine if there is a 
significant difference. In the paired comparison test, each sample taken 
from the population is divided and tested by the different testing proce­
dures. These results are then paired together and the differences are used 
to calculate the t value.
The paired comparison test is much more sensitive than the simple com­
parison test because it removes the variation between samples within the 
population and shows only the differences between the test results. Consider 
a test of two chemical mixes for latex rubber. We wish to determine if there 
is any difference in the average cure time between the two mixtures.

Analysis of Variance Methodology
The amount of variation (in experimental response) contained in the 
total experimental matrix is first calculated by summing the squares of 
each observation and subtracting a correction factor for the overall aver­
age response level. This is not unlike the type of calculation performed in 
finding the standard deviation.

The amount of variation for each variable in the experiment can be simi­
larly sized by squaring the totals of each level of that variable, and sub­
tracting the same correction factor for overall average. This variation is 
proportioned for sample size by dividing our sizing (by n – I in the case of 
the sample variance). The number of measurements in any variation sizing 
is kept track of by this divisor, called degrees of freedom. For our purposes 
this can be considered the number of measurements (in the total group) one 
could vary while still keeping the same average response level. Accordingly, 
degrees of freedom can be calculated as one less than the number of read­
ings squared in getting the variation total. This is necessary since variation 
sizings based on little data are less secure than those based on extensive 
study, and this must be accounted for in our statistical evaluation.
Since all variation sizing of this type must mathematically add up to 
the total experimental variation, variation due to experimental error can 
be found by subtracting variation sizing for individual variables from the 
total experiment’s variation. The analysis of variance, or statistical F-ratio 
test, consists of comparing the variation caused by any specific variable 
to variation due to experimental error. If the particular variable causes a 
lot of variation in the final result (compared to normal fluctuations seen 
in experimental error), it brands itself a major process impactor. These 
significant process impactors can then be carefully specified for optimum 
process setup.
The quantified test for significance is conducted by calculating a sample 
F-ratio, which is the comparison between a variable’s variance compo­
nents and experimental error (as we will work out in examples). This value 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  423
is compared with critical values of F having the same degrees of freedom 
settings as the sample F-ratio, and an error exposure (alpha) appropriate 
to the text. Sample F values exceeding this critical value indicate varia­
tion in the end result is significantly large for the studied variable when 
compared with random variation seen in the experiment. As we have 
mentioned, the analysis of variance technique is fairly reliable even when 
assumptions are not 100% valid. Since the analysis method lets us reuse 
the same experimental variations, and since the same experimental runs 
can be reused in calculating variances for several variables, these matrix 
experiments are extremely economical and efficient ways to study several 
variables at once.
One-Way and Two-Way ANOVA
One-Way ANOVA
Let’s consider an example in the simplest case of a one-factor experiment:
	
SST = SSA + SSE
In the more complicated case of a two-factor experiment with replication 
we would have:
	
SST = SSA + SSB + SSAB + SSE
where:
	SST =	Total sum of squares for the entire experimental matrix
	SST =	Sum of squares of all items minus the correction factor
	SSA or SSB =	 Treatment sum of squares or the sum of squares for factor 
A or B
	SSE =	Error sum of squares (noise)
	SSE =	Total sum of squares minus the treatment sum of squares
	SSAB = Sum of squares for interaction between A and B
	SSAB = Cell totals squared minus SSA and SSB, and we will also use 
(later) CF
	CF =	Correction factor (for the mean) = grand total squared – number 
of items summed to make up the grand total
Notice we have just broken up the total variation (in our experimental 
results) into pieces attributable to each experimental variable, plus “noise” 
(normal experimental error variations).

The table on conductivity of coating contains data from a real exper­
imental matrix that studied several conductive coating application 
processes. The response number is the conductivity of coating mea­

F is a ratio of the variation among the sample means to the variation 
due to chance. If F is large, then the sample means vary widely and thus 
are significant result changers. Stated another way, processes significantly 
differ. If F is small, then the differences among the sample means can be 
attributed to chance. Notice both the total degrees of freedom and the 
total sum of squares are divided into pieces appropriate to our treatments 
and error.

LSD = least significant difference
Thus, process IV would be recommended if high conductivity is desired.
If the difference between two means exceeds the LSD value, then they 
come from different distributions.
Since the mean of process IV differs by 4.8 from the mean of process I, 
processes I and IV have separate distributions. Also, process IV is signifi­
cantly larger than all other processes.
Since the F-ratio is significant, we should like to go further and deter­
mine where the separate distributions are located. This can be accom­
plished by using the LSD method to separate the process distributions.

Two-Way ANOVA
When two factors are involved we are concerned about the main effects 
of each of the two factors and the effect of their interaction. If the exper­
iment has been replicated, then we have an independent estimate of 
experimental error and can thus test the interaction effect. The follow­
ing example illustrates these ideas. Notice that this interaction could not 
be studied if we ran simple experiments on each variable individually.
In this experiment, four different potential plastics suppliers each 
provided samples of three different polymers for evaluation. Tensile 
strengths of two samples of each material from each vendor were ran­
domly tested with results as shown. The experiment will allow us to 
discover if different materials or different vendors produce stronger 
material. In addition, we will be able to notice vendor-material interac­
tions if they are significant, that is, whether some vendors are better with 
certain materials.

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  429
As indicated above, the total variation in the experimental matrix is 
found as before. The portion of this variation due to error can be found 
by subtracting the variation estimate from all cells in the experiment 
(which includes both variables and their interaction) from the total varia­
tion. Variation due to each variable can be found using that variable’s level 
totals as before. Since the cell variation was due to the variable-caused 
variation plus interaction, we can find it by subtraction.
Degrees of freedom (used to choose significance cutoffs for F-ratio 
tests) can be calculated using the basic definition given earlier plus sub­
traction methods similar to those we just used in variance estimates. 
Since 24 squares were used in getting total variation, there should be a 
total of (24 – 1) = 23 degrees of freedom. Three different material levels 
and four vendor totals (used in those variance estimates) give 2 and 3 
degrees of freedom for those variables. Since there were 12 cell totals, 
and thus 12 – 1 = 11 degrees of freedom for variables plus interaction, 
there must then be 11 – 2 – 3 = 6 degrees of freedom left for interaction. 
This also leaves 23 – 11 = 12 degrees of freedom for error. Putting all this 
analysis in table form produces the following chart.

Degrees of freedom
There is significant difference between vendors at the 95% confidence 
level. At α = 0.05, there is no evidence of significant difference between 
materials or of a significant material-vendor interaction. Accordingly, 
choice of vendors is an important consideration in the strengths of mate­
rials to be received. Material type should not have a major impact, nor 
should any particular vendor’s skill with a particular material.
The LSD test could next be applied to the vendor mean values to separate 
significant contributors into significantly different or roughly equal classes.
You may have observed that our estimate of error variation did triple 
duty as a comparison standard for materials and vendors individually, as 
well as their interaction. Going to the cells themselves, the cell total for 
material I and vendor A (for example) helped estimate variation for mate­
rials, was reused to estimate vendor variation, and helped in interaction 
evaluation. These economies enabled both variables and their combina­
tion to be closely examined with only 24 well-chosen runs.

Types of Experimental Designs
Residual error: The difference between the observed and the predicted 
value (C or E) for that result, based on an empirically determined model. 
It can be variation in outcomes of virtually identical test conditions.
Residuals: The difference between experimental responses and pre­
dicted model values.
Resolution I: An experiment in which tests are conducted, adjusting 
one factor at a time, hoping for the best. This experiment is not sta­
tistically sound (definition totally fabricated by the authors).
Resolution II: An experiment in which some of the main effects are 
confounded. This is very undesirable.
Resolution III: A fractional factorial design in which no main effects 
are confounded with each other, but the main effects and two-factor 
interaction effects are confounded.
Resolution IV: A fractional factorial design in which the main effects 
and two-factor interaction effects are not confounded, but the two-
factor effects may be confounded with each other.
Resolution V: A fractional factorial design in which no confounding of main 
effects and two-factor interactions occurs. However, two-factor interac­
tions may be confounded with three-factor and higher interactions.
Response: The graph of a system response plotted against one or more 
system factors.
Surface: Response surface methodology (RSM). Employs experimental 
design to discover the “shape” of the response surface and then uses 
geometric concepts to take advantage of the relationships discovered.
Robust design: A term associated with the application of Taguchi experi­
mentation in which a response variable is considered robust or immune 
to input variables that may be difficult or impossible to control.
Screening: A technique to discover the most (probable) important factors.
Experiment: In an experimental system. Most screening experiments 
employ two-level designs. A word of caution about the results of 
screening experiments: If a factor is not highly significant, it does not 
necessarily mean that it is insignificant.
Sequential: Experiments are done one after another, not at the same time.
Experiments: This is often required by the type of experimental 
design being used. Sequential experimentation is the opposite of 
parallel experimentation.

432  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Simplex: A geometric figure that has a number of vertexes (corners) 
equal to one more than the number of dimensions in the factor space.
Simplex design: A spatial design used to determine the most desirable 
variable combination (proportions) in a mixture.
Test coverage: The percentage of all possible combinations of input fac­
tors in an experimental test.
Treatments: In an experiment, the various factor levels that describe 
how an experiment is to be carried out. The level of pH at 3 and the 
level of temperature at 37°C describe an experimental treatment.
Applications of DoE
Situations where experimental design can be effectively used include:
• Choosing between alternatives
• Selecting the key factors affecting a response
• Response surface modeling to:
• Hit a target
• Reduce variability
• Maximize or minimize a response
• Make a process robust (i.e., the process gets the “right” results 
even though there are uncontrollable “noise” factors)
• Seek multiple goals
DoE Steps
Getting good results from a DoE involves a number of steps:
• Set objectives
• Select process variables
• Select an experimental design
• Execute the design
• Check that the data are consistent with the experimental assumptions
• Analyze and interpret the results
• Use/present the results (may lead to further runs or DoEs)
Important practical considerations in planning and running experi­
ments are:
• Check the performance of gauges/measurement devices first
• Keep the experiment as simple as possible
• Check that all planned runs are feasible

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  433
• Watch out for process drifts and shifts during the run
• Avoid unplanned changes (e.g., switching operators at half-time)
• Allow some time (and backup material) for unexpected events
• Obtain buy-in from all parties involved
• Maintain effective ownership of each step in the experimental plan
• Preserve all the raw data—do not keep only summary averages!
• Record everything that happens
• Reset equipment to its original state after the experiment
Experimental Objectives
Choosing an experimental design depends on the objectives of the experi­
ment and the number of factors to be investigated. Some experimental 
design objectives are discussed below:
	
1.	Comparative objective: If several factors are under investigation, 
but the primary goal of the experiment is to make a conclusion 
about whether a factor (in spite of the existence of the other factors) 
is “significant,” then the experimenter has a comparative problem 
and needs a comparative design solution.
	
2.	Screening objective: The primary purpose of this experiment is to 
select or screen out the few important main effects from the many 
lesser important ones. These screening designs are also termed main 
effects or fractional factorial designs.
	
3.	Response surface (method) objective: This experiment is designed 
to let an experimenter estimate interaction (and quadratic) effects, 
and therefore give an idea of the (local) shape of the response surface 
under investigation. For this reason they are termed response sur­
face method (RSM) designs. RSM designs are used to:
• Find improved or optimal process settings
• Troubleshoot process problems and weak points
• Make a product or process more robust against external influences
	
4.	Optimizing responses when factors are proportions of a mixture 
objective: If an experimenter has factors that are proportions of a mix­
ture and wants to know the “best” proportions of the factors, to maxi­
mize (or minimize) a response, then a mixture design is required.
	
5.	Optimal fitting of a regression model objective: If an experimenter 
wants to model a response as a mathematical function (either known 
or empirical) of a few continuous factors, to obtain “good” model 
parameter estimates, then a regression design is necessary.

434  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
It should be noted that most good computer programs will provide 
regression models. The best design sources are full factorial (in some cases 
with replication) and response surface designs. Designs for the first three 
objectives above are summarized in the following.
Select and Scale the Process Variables
Process variables include both inputs and outputs, i.e., factors and 
responses. The selection of these variables is best done as a team effort. 
The team should:
• Include all important factors (based on engineering and operator 
judgments)
• Be bold, but not foolish, in choosing the low and high factor levels
• Avoid factor settings for impractical or impossible combinations
• Include all relevant responses
• Avoid using responses that combine two or more process 
measurements
When choosing the range of settings for input factors, it is wise to avoid 
extreme values. In some cases, extreme values will give runs that are not 
feasible; in other cases, extreme ranges might move the response surface 
into some erratic region.
The most popular experimental designs are called two-level designs. 
Why only two levels? It is ideal for screening designs, simple and economi­
cal; it also gives most of the information required to go to a multilevel 
response surface experiment if one is needed. However, two-level design 
is something of a misnomer. It is often desirable to include some center 
points (for quantitative factors) during the experiment (center points are 
located in the middle of the design “box”).

The choice of a design depends on the amount of resources available and 
the degree of control over making wrong decisions (Type I and Type II 
hypothesis errors) that the experimenter desires. It is a good idea to choose 
a design that requires somewhat fewer runs than the budget permits, so 
that additional runs can be added to check for curvature and to correct any 
experimental mishaps.
A Typical DoE Checklist
Planning an experiment can be as simple as answering some basic ques­
tions. Such questions include:
What do I want to accomplish?
What results am I looking for?
What relationships am I looking for?
What is the final objective of the experiment?
What are the dependent variable(s)?
How am I going to measure the dependent variable?
What changes do I expect to see?
How am I going to measure these changes?
Measuring instrumentation:
What is its precision?
What is its accuracy?
Based on my ability to measure and the changes expected:
How many replicas are required to guarantee a valid result?
Are there any systematic relationships that might affect the order 
in which the experiment is run?
How do the dependent variable(s) relate to the question being 
asked?
Can the question being asked be answered by these observations?
Can inference be drawn from these observations concerning the 
question?

The Iterative Approach to DoE
It is often a mistake to believe that “one big experiment will give the 
answer.” A more useful approach to experimental design is to recognize 
that while one experiment might give a useful result, it is more common 
to perform two or three, or perhaps more, experiments before a com­
plete answer is attained. In other words, an iterative approach is best and, 
in the end, is the most economical. Putting all one’s eggs in one basket 
is not advisable. The reason an iterative approach frequently works best 
is because it is logical to move through stages of experimentation, each 
stage supplying a different kind of answer. One author supported an R&D 
team in the development of a new textile dyestuff in which 33 iterative 
experiments over 2 years improved colorfastness from 18% to 94%.
Experimental Assumptions
In all experimentation, one makes assumptions. Some of the engineering 
and mathematical assumptions an experimenter makes include:
• Are the measurement systems capable for all responses?
• Is the process stable?
• Are the residuals (the difference between the model predictions and 
the actual observations) well behaved?
Is the Measurement System Capable?
It is not a good idea to find, after finishing an experiment, that the measure­
ment devices are incapable. This should be confirmed before embarking on 
the experiment itself. In addition, it is advisable, especially if the experiment 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  437
lasts over a protracted period, that a check be made on all measurement 
devices from the start to the conclusion of the experiment. Strange experi­
mental outcomes can often be traced to “hiccups” in the metrology system.
Is the Process Stable?
Experimental runs should have control runs that are done at the “stan­
dard” process set points, or at least at some identifiable operating condi­
tions. The experiment should start and end with such runs. A plot of the 
outcomes of these control runs will indicate if the underlying process itself 
drifted or shifted during the experiment. It is desirable to experiment on a 
stable process. However, if this cannot be achieved, then the process insta­
bility must be accounted for in the analysis of the experiment.
Are the Residuals Well Behaved?
Residuals are estimates of experimental error obtained by subtracting the 
observed response from the predicted response. The predicted response 
is calculated from the chosen model, after all the unknown model para­
meters have been estimated from the experimental data. Residuals can be 
thought of as elements of variation unexplained by the fitted model. Since 
this is a form of error, the same general assumptions apply to the group of 
residuals that one typically uses for errors in general. One expects them to 
be normally and independently distributed with a mean of zero and some 
constant variance.
These are the assumptions behind ANOVA and classical regression 
analysis. This means that an analyst should expect a regression model to 
err in predicting a response in a random fashion; the model should predict 
values higher than actual and lower than actual with equal probability. In 
addition, the level of the error should be independent of when the observa­
tion occurred in the study, or the size of the observation being predicted, 
or even the factor settings involved in making the prediction.
The overall pattern of the residuals should be similar to the bell-shaped 
pattern observed when plotting a histogram of normally distributed 
data. Graphical methods are used to examine residuals. Departures from 
assumptions usually mean that the residuals contain structure that is not 
accounted for in the model. Identifying that structure and adding a term 
representing it to the original model leads to a better model. Any graph 

438  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
suitable for displaying the distribution of a set of data is suitable for judg­
ing the normality of the distribution of a group of residuals. The three 
most common types are: histograms, normal probability plots, and dot 
plots. Shown in Figure 10.10 are examples of dot plot results.
Interactions
An interaction occurs when the effect of one input factor on the output depends 
upon the level of another input factor. Refer to the diagrams in Figure 10.11.
Interactions can be readily examined with full factorial experiments. 
Often, interactions are lost with fractional factorial experiments. The pre­
ferred DoE approach examines (screens) a large number of factors with 
highly fractional experiments. Interactions are then explored or addi­
tional levels examined once the suspected factors have been reduced. 
Often, a full factorial or three-level fractional factorial trial (giving some 
interactions) is used in the follow-up experiment.

Interaction Case Study
A simple 2 × 2 factorial experiment (with replication) was conducted 
in the textile industry. The response variable was ends down/thousand 
spindle hours (ED/MSH). The independent factors were relative humidity 
(RH) and ion level (the environmental level of negative ions). Both of these 
factors were controllable. A low ED/MSH is desirable since fewer thread 
breaks means higher productivity.
An ANOVA showed the main effects were not significant, but the inter­
action effects were highly significant. Consider the data table and plots in 
Figure 10.12.

Shown in Figure 10.13 is a 113 fractional factorial design. Generally the (–) 
and (+) levels in two-level designs are expressed as 0 and 1 in most design 
catalogues. Three-level designs are often represented as 0, 1, and 2.
From the design catalogue test plan (plan 3, columns 1, 2, 4), the selected 
fractional factorial experiment looks like that shown in Table 10.2.
Randomized Block Plans
In comparing a number of factor treatments, it is desirable that all other 
conditions be kept as nearly constant as possible. The required number of 
tests may be too large to be carried out under similar conditions. In such 
cases, we may be able to divide the experiment into blocks, or planned

homogeneous groups. When each group in the experiment contains exactly 
one measurement on every treatment, the experimental plan is called a 
randomized block plan. For example, an experimental scheme may take 
several days to complete. If we expect some biasing differences among days, 
we might plan to measure each item on each day, or to conduct one test 
per day on each item. A day would then represent a block. A randomized 
incomplete block (tension response) design is shown in Table 10.3.
Only treatments A, C, and D are run on the first day, with B, C, and 
D on the second day, etc. In the whole experiment, note that each pair 
of treatments, such as BC, occurs twice together. The order in which the 
three treatments are run on a given day follows a randomized sequence.
Another randomized block design for air permeability response is 
shown in Table 10.4.
Latin Square Designs
A Latin square plan is often useful when it is desirable to allow for two 
sources of nonhomogeneity in the conditions affecting test results. Such 
designs were originally applied in agriculture when the two sources of

nonhomogeneity were the two directions on the field. The square was lit­
erally a plot of ground.
In Latin square designs a third variable, the experimental treatment, 
is then applied to the source variables in a balanced fashion. The Latin 
square plan is restricted by two conditions:
• The number of rows, columns, and treatments must be the same.
• There should be no expected interactions between row and column 
factors, since these cannot be measured. If there are, the sensitivity 
of the experiment is reduced.
A Latin square design is essentially a fractional factorial experiment that 
requires less experimentation to determine the main treatment results. 
Consider the 5 × 5 Latin square in Table 10.5.
In the design in Table 10.5, five automobiles and five carburetors are 
used to evaluate gas mileage by five drivers (A, B, C, D, and E). Note that 
only 25 of the potential 125 combinations are tested. Thus, the resultant 
experiment is a one-fifth fractional factorial. Similar 3 × 3, 4 × 4, and 6 × 6 
designs may be utilized.
Graeco-Latin Designs
Graeco-Latin square designs are sometimes useful to eliminate more than 
two sources of variability in an experiment. A Graeco-Latin design is an 
extension of the Latin square design, but one extra blocking variable is 
added for a total of three blocking variables. Consider the following 4 × 4 
Graeco-Latin design:
The output (response) variable could be gas mileage by four drivers (A, B, 
C, D). (See Table 10.6.)

Hyper-Graeco-Latin Designs
A hyper-Graeco-Latin square design permits the study of treatments with 
more than three blocking variables. Consider the 4 × 4 hyper-Graeco-
Latin design in Table 10.7. The output (response) variable could be gas 
mileage by four drivers (A, B, C, D).
Plackett-Burman Designs
Plackett-Burman (PB) (1946)6 designs are used for screening experiments. 
PB designs are very economical. The run number is a multiple of 4 rather 
than a power of 2. PB geometric designs are two-level designs with 4, 8, 
16, 32, 64, and 128 runs and work best as screening designs. Each inter­
action effect is confounded with exactly one main effect. All other two-
level PB designs (12, 20, 24, 28, etc.) are nongeometric designs. In these 
designs a two-factor interaction will be partially confounded with each 
of the other main effects in the study. Thus, the nongeometric designs 
are essentially “main effect designs,” when there is reason to believe any 
interactions are of little practical importance. A PB design in 12 runs, for

With a 20-run design, an experimenter can do a screening experiment for 
up to 19 factors. As many as 27 factors can be evaluated in a 28-run design.

Taguchi Designs
The Taguchi philosophy emphasizes two tenets: (1) Reduce the varia­
tion of a product or process (improve quality), which reduces the loss 
to society, and (2) use a proper development strategy to intentionally 
reduce variation.
One development approach is to identify a parameter that will improve 
some performance characteristic. A second approach is to identify a less 
expensive, alternative design, material, or method that will provide equiv­
alent or better performance. Orthogonal arrays (OAs) have been designed 
to facilitate the development test strategy.
Orthogonal Arrays Degrees of Freedom
Let df = degrees of freedom and k = number of factor levels.
Examples:
For factor A, dfA = kA –1.
For factor B, dfB = kB –1.
For A × B interaction, dfAB = dfA × dfB.
dfmin = Edf all factors + Edf all interactions of interest.
Two-Level OAs  OAs can be used to assign factors and interactions. The 
simplest OA is an L4 (four trial runs). (See Table 10.9.)
Factors A and B can be assigned to any two of the three columns. The 
remaining column is the interaction column. Assume a trial is conducted 
with two repeat runs for each trial. Let us assign factor A to column 1 and

SS8 = SST – SSA – SSB – SS3 = 58.875 – 0.125 – 15.125 – 36.125 = 7.5
A standard ANOVA table can now be set up to determine factor sig­
nificance at a selected alpha value. ANOVA was previously reviewed. The 
assignment of factors and interactions to arrays is reviewed in the follow­
ing discussion. We will consider an L4 OA first. The L4 linear graph shows 
that if the two factors are assigned to columns 1 and 2, the interaction will 
be in column 3. The L4 triangular table shows that if the two factors are 
put in columns 1 and 3, the other point of the triangle for the interaction is 
in column 2. If the two factors are put in columns 2 and 3, the interaction 
will be found in column 1.
The next level of linear graphs is for an L8 OA. Two linear graphs avail­
able for an L8 experiment are shown in Figure 10.14. The linear graph

columns and several different interactions may be evaluated in different 
columns. If three factors (A, B, and C) are assigned, the L8 linear graph 
indicates the assignment to columns 1, 2, and 4 located at the vertices in 
the type A triangle. (See Figures 10.15 and 10.16.)
The L8 in Table 10.11 shows the B × C interaction (columns 2 and 4) 
takes place in column 6. The A× B× C interaction is located by finding the 
interaction of factor A and the B × C interaction. The B × C interaction is

experiment if a random pattern of run order is established. This will pre­
vent bias of the factors and interactions assigned to the experimental col­
umns. The three most common forms of randomization follow.
Complete Randomization  Complete or ideal randomization means that 
any trial has an equal chance of being selected for the first test run. Each 
of the remaining trials has an equal chance of being selected for the sec­
ond test run, and so on for the rest of the trials. Random numbers can be 
obtained from a random number table or a random number generator. If 
replications of each trial are required, all random arrangements of the tri­
als should be completed for the first trial observation before the next new 
random arrangement of trials. In many experiments, an analysis can be 
performed at the end of each complete set of trials.
Simple Repetition  Simple repetition means that each trial has an equal 
random chance of being selected for the first test run, but once selected, 
all repetitions are run before the next trial is randomly selected. This 
approach is used when changing test setups is difficult or expensive.
Complete randomization within blocks is used when changing the setup 
for say, factor C, and may be difficult or expensive, but changing all other 
factors is relatively easy. The experiment could be completed in two halves 
or blocks. All C1 trials could be randomly selected and run, and then all C2 
trials could be randomly selected.
Analysis of Experiment Data  One of the basic properties of OAs is that 
total variation can be determined by summing the variation from all col­
umns. The total sums of squares for the unassigned columns are equal to 
the error sums of squares.
Taguchi Robust Concepts
Dr. Genichi Taguchi, an engineer from Japan, learned DoE techniques 
and modified some of the terminologies and approaches to obtain a dra­
matic improvement in the quality of products. Since the early 1980s, his 
approach has found widespread use in achieving “robustness of design.” 
The Japanese say, “An engineer who does not know design of experiments 
is only a half an engineer.”
Dr. Taguchi’s basic message is that the consistency of the product is very 
important. However, it is futile to try to achieve consistent output char­
acteristics by controlling the variation in every variable. There are a few 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  453
key variables (signal or noise factors) and their interaction in any process. 
When these factors are fixed at the right levels, they will make the product 
characteristic robust. That is, the process will be insensitive to variations 
in other input factors. The Taguchi approach focuses on controlling some 
inputs stringently to reduce product variation. An example may make the 
point clearer.
Example of the Taguchi Approach
In a paint shop at a Ford Motor Company plant, paint blistering on an 
automobile hood led to expensive rework. No one apparently had any clue 
why the blistering occurred. Engineers, operating personnel, and sup­
pliers gathered to brainstorm and identified seven suspect factors as the 
likely causes of blistering: paint supplier, undercoat thickness, drying time 
for undercoat, paint thickness, drying time, temperature, and humidity. 
Only eight experimental runs were needed to study the effects of the seven 
variables. However, to have more confidence in the data, the experiment 
was conducted 5 times, a total of 40 runs. The experiment proved that blis­
tering occurred most frequently when the undercoat thickness was higher. 
It was not necessary to control other variables as stringently. The experi­
ment proved that aiming for consistency in product output is not only 
sound judgment but of economic necessity.
Achieving Design Robustness
Three types of design considerations are involved for any product or process:
	
1.	System design: Includes the selection of parts, methods, and ten­
tative product parameter values. Engineers and scientists are best 
equipped to handle system design (also called concept design).
	
2.	Parameter design: The selection of nominal product and process 
operating levels to determine the optimum combinations. The levels 
should be chosen so as to make the output characteristics insensitive 
to (continued) variation in environmental factors (noise) over which 
there is little control. Parameter design is the most neglected aspect 
of product design. Quality professionals can make an important 
contribution in achieving quality without increasing cost via param­
eter design.
	
3.	Tolerance design: The establishment of the permissible variation in 
the product and process to achieve a consistent output. Traditionally, 
tolerances are made stringent to achieve a better product.

Signal Factors
Signal factors are the factors that strongly influence the mean response. 
Signal factors normally have minimal influence on variation of the out­
put response and are controllable. We should vary their level to adjust the 
mean. Choose a correct level for ones that introduce variability.
Noise Factors
Noise factors are those factors that influence the variation in the out­
put. These may be controllable or noncontrollable. The controllable ones 
are varied during the experimentation to see which combination gives 
the highest (or lowest as desired) signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In essence, 
choose the levels of controllable noise factors such that the S/N ratio is 
maximized (or minimized) and the output response is insensitive to the 
variation in uncontrollable noise factors. This is the key to achieving 
design robustness.
S/N Ratios
The S/N ratio is a calculation to quantify the effects (in dB) of variation 
in the controllable factors resulting in the variation of output. (There has 
been some criticism in the West regarding the reliability of S/N ratios.)

where n refers to the number of observations of controllable factors within an

Levels of the Controllable Factor
The input (controllable) factor should be chosen between the medium 
and high levels, since input variation will cause little output variation.

Mixture Designs
In a mixture experiment, the independent factors are proportions of dif­
ferent components of a blend. The fact that the proportions of the different 
factors must sum to 100% complicates the design as well as the analysis of 
mixture experiments.
When the mixture components are subject to the constraint that they 
must sum to 1, there are standard mixture designs for fitting standard 
models, such as simplex-lattice designs and simple-centroid designs. 
When mixture components are subject to additional constraints, such as 
a maximum and/or minimum value for each component, designs other 
than the standard mixture designs, referred to as constrained-mixture 
designs or extreme-vertices designs, are appropriate.
In mixture experiments, the measured response is assumed to depend 
only on the relative proportions of the ingredients or components in the 
mixture and not on the amount of the mixture. The amount of the mixture 
could also be studied as an additional factor in the experiment. However, 
this is an example of where mixture and process variables are treated 
together. In mixture problems the purpose of the experiment is to model 
the blending surface with some form of mathematical equation so that:
• Predictions of the response for any mixture or combination of the 
ingredients can be made empirically
• Some measure of the influence on the response of each component 
singly and in combination with other components can be obtained
The usual assumptions made for factorial experiments are also assumed 
for mixture experiments. In particular, the errors are assumed to be

independent and identically distributed with zero mean and common vari­
ance. Another assumption that is made, similar to that made for factorial 
designs, is that the true underlying response surface is continuous over the 
region being studied. While there are several mixture design alternatives 
as noted above, this handbook will only explore simplex-lattice designs.
Simplex-Lattice Designs
A {q, m} simplex-lattice design for q components consists of points defined 
by the following coordinate settings: The proportions assumed by each 
component take the m + 1 equally spaced values from 0 to 1.
	
X = 0,1/m, 2/m, …, 1  for I = 1, 2, …, q
and all possible combinations (mixtures) of the proportions from this 
equation are used.
Note that the standard simplex-lattice is a boundary point design; that 
is, with the exception of the overall centroid, all the design points are on 
the boundaries of the simplex. When one is interested in prediction in the 
interior, it is highly desirable to augment the simplex-type designs with 
interior design points.
Consider a three-component mixture where the number of equally 
spaced levels for each component is four (i.e., X1 = 0, 0.333, 0.667, 1). In 
this example, then, q = 3 and m = 3. If one considers all possible blends 
of the three components with these proportions, then the {3, 3} simplex-
lattice contains the 10 blending coordinates listed below. The experimen­
tal region and the distribution of design run over the simplex region are 
shown in Figure 10.18. There are a total of 10 design runs for the {3, 3} 
simplex-lattice design. The number of design points in the simplex-lattice 
is (q + m – 1)!/(m!(q – 1)!).
Now consider the form of the polynomial model that one might fit to the 
data from a mixture experiment. Due to the restriction X + X2 + … + Xq = 1, 
the form of the regression function is somewhat different than the tradi­
tional polynomial fit and is often referred to as the canonical polynomial.
The canonical polynomial is derived using the general form of the 
regression function that can be fit to data collected at the points of a {q, m} 
simplex-lattice design and substituting into this the dependence relation­
ship among the Xi terms. The number of terms in the {q, m} polynomial is 
(q + m – 1)!/m!(q – 1)!. This number is equal to the number of points that 
make up the associated {q, m} simplex-lattice design.

The terms in the canonical mixture polynomials have simple interpreta­
tions. Geometrically, the parameter 3i in the above equations represents 
the expected response to the pure mixture Xi = 1, Xi = 0, ij, and is the height 
of the mixture surface at the vertex Xi = 1. The portion of each of the above

Simplex-Lattice Design Example
The following example is from Cornell (1990)3 and consists of a three-
component mixture problem. The three components are polyethylene 
(X1), polystyrene (X2), and polypropylene (X3), which are blended 
together to form fiber that will be spun into yarn. The product devel­
opers are only interested in the pure and binary blends of these three 
materials.
The response variable of interest is yarn elongation in kilograms of force 
applied. A {3, 2} simplex-lattice design is used to study the blending pro­
cess. The design and the observed responses are listed in Table 10.15. There 
were two replicate observations run at each of the pure blends. There were 
three replicate observations run at the binary blends. There are a total 
of 15 observations with six unique design runs. A {3, 2} simplex-lattice 
design is shown below.

Under the parameter estimates section of the output are the individual 
t-tests for each of the parameters in the model. The three cross-product 
terms are (X1 • X2)(X3 • Xi)(X3 • X2), indicating a significant quadratic fit. 
The fitted quadratic mixture model is:
	
Y = 11.7X1 + 9.4X2 + 16.4x3 + 19.0X1   X2 + 11.4X1X3 – 9.6X2X3
Since b3 > b1 > b2, one can conclude that component 3 (polypropylene) 
produces yarn with the highest elongation. Additionally, since b12 and b13 
are positive, blending components 1 and 2 or components 1 and 3 produces 
higher elongation values than would be expected just by averaging the elon­
gations of the pure blends. This is an example of “synergistic” blending 
effects. Components 2 and 3 have antagonistic blending effects because b23 
is negative.
Steepest Ascent/Descent
Most of the discussion in this element is directed at steepest ascent but is 
applicable to steepest descent when lower values are desirable. In an experi­
mental problem the contours are usually not known, although in some situ­
ations the equations may be known. The object is to move from some initial 
point P in the (X X2) space within the contour system. Notice in Figure 10.19 
the small circle drawn around P. Consider the directional line arrow

obtained by joining the center of the circle (point P) to the point on the cir­
cumference of the circle where it just touches one of the response contours.
As the diameter of the circle is decreased, the directional line is said 
to point in the direction of steepest ascent on the surface at point P. This 
direction achieves the greatest rate of increase per unit of distance trav­
eled in contour space. It can be shown that this directional arrow can be 
followed by making changes that are proportional to partial derivatives 
calculated at P. This method is often used for obtaining the maximum or 
minimum of known functions.
When the function is unknown, we use an experimental procedure 
with observations taken, but subject to error, that was first introduced by 
Box and Wilson (1951).1 In this procedure, a small experimental design is 
performed around point P and the derivatives are estimated numerically 
from the experimental observations. (See Figure 10.19.)
In general, the path of steepest ascent is perpendicular to the contour lines 
if the space is measured in the same relative units chosen to scale the design.
Simplex Approaches to Steepest Ascent
For a simplex approach to steepest ascent, see Figure 10.20.
	
1.	Requires one more point than the number of independent variables.
	
2.	Move away from the lowest response point through the midpoint of 
the other two points to an equal distance on the other side.
	
3.	Repeat this cycle, dropping the lowest point at each step.

Note:  This can be expanded to any number of variables, projecting away 
from the lowest, through the centroid of the remaining points.
For a modified simplex approach to steepest ascent, see Figure 10.21. 
Run regular simplex point (k = 1), then:
	
1.	If k = 1 gives a new best, run k = 2 point, use better of k = 1 or k = 2.
	
2.	If k = 1 gives better than only the current worst, run k = 0.5 point.
	
3.	If k = 0.5 point is even worse than the current worst, then quit or 
restart a smaller simplex around k = –0.5 point.
Exchange only one point at each stage.

matrix with center points augmented with a group of “star points” that 
allow estimation of curvature. If the distance from the center of the design 
space to a factorial point is ±1 unit for each factor, the distance from the 
center of the design space to a star point is ± a, where lal > ‘1.
The precise value of (a) depends on certain properties desired for the 
design and the number of factors involved. Similarly, the number of center 
point runs the design must contain also depends on certain properties 
required for the design. (See Figure 10.25.)
A central composite design always contains twice as many star points 
as there are factors in the design. The star points represent new extreme 
values (low and high) for each design factor. Figure 10.26 illustrates the 
relationships among three varieties of central composite designs.
In Figure 10.26, note that the CCC explores the largest process space 
and CCI explores the smallest process space. Both CCC and CCI are rotat­
able designs, but the CCF is not. In the CCC design, the design points 
describe a circle circumscribed about the factorial square. For three fac­
tors, the CCC design points describe a sphere around the factorial cube.

Central Composite Designs
Design Type
Comments
Circumscribed CCC
CCC designs are the original form of the central composite 
design. The star points are at some distance a from the center 
based on the properties desired for the design and the number of 
factors in the design. The star points establish new extremes for 
the low and high settings for all factors. Figure 10.27 illustrates a 
CCC design. These designs have circular, spherical, or 
hyperspherical symmetry and require five levels for each factor. 
Augmenting an existing factorial or resolution V fractional 
factorial design with star points can produce this design.
Inscribed CCI
For those situations where the limits specified for factor settings 
are truly limits, the CCI design uses the factor settings as the star 
points and creates a factorial or fractional factorial matrix within 
those limits (in other words, a CCI design is a scaled-down CCC 
design with each factor level of the CCC design divided by a to 
generate the CCI design). This design also requires five levels of 
each factor.
Face-centered CCF
In this design the star points are at the center of each face of the 
factorial space, so a = ± I. This design requires three levels of 
each factor. Augmenting an existing factorial or resolution V 
design with appropriate star points can also produce this design.

Determining α in Central Composite Designs
To maintain rotatability, the value of α depends on the number of experi­
mental runs in the factorial portion of the central composite design:
	
[number of factorial runs]1/4
If the factorial is a full factorial, then k = the number of factors.
Box-Behnken Designs
The Box-Behnken design is an independent quadratic design in that it 
does not contain an embedded factorial or fractional factorial matrix. In 
this design the treatment combinations are at the midpoints of edges of 
the process space and at the center. These designs are rotatable (or near 
rotatable) and require three levels of each factor. These designs have lim­
ited capability for orthogonal blocking compared to the central composite 
designs. Figure 10.28 illustrates a Box-Behnken design for three factors.
The geometry of this design suggests a sphere within the process space, 
such that the surface of the sphere protrudes through each face with the 
surface of the sphere tangential to the midpoint of each edge of the space.
Choosing a Response Surface Design
Table 10.18 contrasts the structures of four common quadratic designs one 
might use when investigating three factors. The table combines CCC and 
CCI designs because they are structurally identical. For three factors, the

Box-Behnken design offers some advantage in requiring a fewer number 
of runs. Central composite designs require fewer treatments than the Box-
Behnken when the factor count is 5 or higher.
Table 10.19 summarizes properties of the classical quadratic designs. 
Use this table as a guideline when attempting to choose among the four 
available designs. Table 10.20 compares the number of runs required for 
CC and BB designs.
Evolutionary Operations (EVOP)
Prior coverage of steepest ascent/descent designs emphasized a bold 
strategy for improvement. In contrast, EVOP emphasizes a conserva­
tive experimental strategy for continuous process improvement. Refer to 
Figure 10.29.
Tests are carried out in phase A until a response pattern is established. 
Then phase B is centered on the best conditions from phase A. This pro­
cedure is repeated until the best result is determined. When nearing a 
peak, switch to smaller step sizes or examine different variables. EVOP

can entail small incremental changes so that little or no process scrap is 
generated. Large sample sizes may be required to determine the appropri­
ate direction of improvement. The method can be extended to more than 
two variables, using simple main effects experiment designs.
The EVOP approach does not recommend the formal calculation of the 
steepest ascent path, and a more informal experimental procedure seems 
appropriate. The experimenter naturally tends to change variables in the 
direction of expected improvement and thus follows an ascent path. In 
EVOP experimentation there are fewer considerations to be taken into 
TABLE 10.19
Summary of Properties of Classical Response Surface Designs
Design Type
Comment
CCC
CCC designs provide high-quality predictions over the entire design space, 
but require using settings outside the range originally specified for the 
factorial factors. When the possibility of running a CCC design is 
recognized before starting a factorial experiment, factor spacings can be 
reduced to ensure that plus or minus α for each coded factor corresponds 
to feasible (reasonable) levels. Five levels are required for each factor.
CCI
CCI designs use only points within the factor ranges originally specified, 
but do not provide the same high-quality prediction over the entire 
space compared to the CCC. Five levels are required for each factor.
CCF
CCF designs provide relatively high-quality predictions over the entire 
design space and do not require using points outside the original factor 
range. However, they give poor precision for estimating pure quadratic 
coefficients. They require three levels for each factor.
Box-Behnken
These designs require fewer treatment combinations than a central composite 
design in cases involving three or four factors. The Box-Behnken design is 
rotatable (or nearly so), but it contains regions of poor prediction quality like 
the CCI. Its “missing corners” may be useful when the experiment should 
avoid combined factor extremes. This property prevents a potential loss of 
data in those cases. Requires three levels for each factor.

MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS ANALYSIS (MSA)
Definition
Measurement systems analysis (MSA) is a mathematical procedure 
to quantify variation introduced to a process or product by the act of 
measuring. The item to be measured can be a physical part, document, 
or scenario for customer service.
Just the Facts
How well can we trust the data that we have? Six Sigma is data dependent 
and decisions are made based on that data. What if the data are wrong from 
the start? Remember the old adage “garbage in, garbage out.” As a member 
of a Six Sigma Team, you need to assure yourself and those depending on 
you to make the right decisions that the data you are using are “good data.”
Operator can refer to a person or can be different instruments measur­
ing the same products.
Reference is a standard that is used to calibrate the equipment.

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  477
Procedure is the method used to perform the test.
Equipment is the device used to measure the product.
Environment is the surroundings where the measures are performed.
Is the variation (spread) of my measurement system too large to study 
the current level of the process variation in Figure 10.31?
Important questions to ask include:
• How big is the measurement error (i.e., measurement variation)?
• What are the sources of measurement error/variation?
• Is the measurement system stable over time?
• Are the measurements being made with measurement units that are 
small enough to properly reflect the variation present?
• Are the measurements accurate?
• Can we tell when and if the process changes?
• How do we improve the measurement system?
Example
The following is a step-by-step approach to MSA:
Step 1: Identify the measurement system being used to judge the char­
acteristic of interest. Is it appropriate?
Step 2: Identify the individual(s) responsible for ensuring quality of the 
measurement system.

Step 3: Construct a process map (flowchart) of the measurement process.
Step 4: List possible sources of variation on the measurement process 
on a cause-and-effect (fishbone) diagram.
Step 5: Assess the accuracy of the measurement process—verify calibration.
Step 6: Plan a study to evaluate the measurement process, run trials, 
and collect data.
Step 7: Analyze and interpret study results, verifying adequacy of mea­
surement units.
Step 8: Continue to monitor the measurement process for stability over time.
Approaches to Attribute MSA
Expert reevaluation (truth known): Investigates accuracy only and 
reports back the percent of correct decisions.
Round-robin study (truth known): Explores accuracy and operator-to-
operator agreement (precision).
Inspection concurrence (truth known): Assesses repeatability within 
operators and reproducibility between operators when the truth is 
known.
When evaluating attribute processes, we want the percentage of correct 
decisions and the degree of agreement to be at least 90%.
METHOD OF LEAST SQUARES
Definition
The method of least squares is based on the concept that the best-fit 
equation for a set of data is obtained when the sum of the squared dif­
ference between the actual data points and the points calculated from 
the equation of the fitted line is a minimum.
Just the Facts
The best-fitting curve to a given set of points is obtained by minimizing 
the sum of the squares of the offsets (the residuals) of the points from the 
curve. The residuals are treated as a continuous differentiable quantity; 
however, because squares of the offsets are used, outlying points can have 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  479
a disproportionate effect on the fit, a property that may or may not be 
desirable depending on the problem at hand.
Example
When the means of all of the squared errors between the fitted line and 
actual data are minimized, you have achieved the best fit for the given 
equation being fitted (Figure 10.32).

Just the Facts
Multivari charts are useful in identifying which independent variable (x) 
has the most significant effect on the response of a system. Other uses of 
multivari charts are to do initial screening of complex systems, and the 
impacts of variations within and between variables. They are also useful 
in identifying the impact of discrete (categorical) variables on a system, 
such as different materials. They are also good at graphically representing 
results from nested and crossed designs.
Example
Consider the desire to examine the effect of shift, material, and machine 
on the product response. A set of samples are collected from each machine 
on each shift for material G. It was repeated for material H. The relation­
ship is illustrated in the chart in Figure 10.33.
The results of the study need to separate the effect of shift, material, and 
machine. The resultant multivari chart (Figure  10.34) clearly separates 
each independent variable and illustrates its effect on the response.
NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS
Definition
Data that do not fit into a continuous distribution are called nonpara­
metric and are more difficult to make reject/not reject decisions for.

Just the Facts
There are several nonparametric statistical tests that have been developed 
depending on what is being investigated. The following is a list of the most 
common nonparametric tests.
• One-sample sign test: Estimates the point value of the median and 
confidence interval.
• One-sided Wilcoxon test: Performs a signed rank test of the median 
similar to the one-sample sign test.
• Two-sample Mann Whitney: Performs a hypothesis test of the 
equality of two population medians and calculates the correspond­
ing point estimate and confidence interval.
• Kruskal-Wallis: Performs a hypothesis test of the equality of popula­
tion medians for a one-way design. This test is a generalization of the 
procedure used by the Mann-Whitney test.
• Mood’s median test: Similar to the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-
Wallis tests. It is more robust against outliers but produces larger 
confidence intervals.
• Friedman test for a randomized block design: Performs a nonpara­
metric analysis of a randomized block experiment. This test requires 
exactly one observation per treatment-block combination.

It is highly recommended that a statistical evaluation program such as 
Minitab or JMP be used to make these calculations.
Example
Sign Test for the Median
Evaluate the median price index for 30 homes in a suburban area against sim­
ilar homes the previous year and determine if the median price has changed.
One-Sided Wilcoxon Test
The Wilcoxon signed rank test hypotheses are:
• H0: median = hypothesized median
• Ha: median ≠ hypothesized median
The assumption is that the data are a random sample from a continuous, 
symmetric distribution.
Two-Sample Mann-Whitney
This is a nonparametric hypothesis test to determine whether two popu­
lations have the same population median (h). It tests the null hypothesis 
that the two population medians are equal (H0: h1 = h2). The alterna­
tive hypothesis can be left-tailed (h1 < h2), right-tailed (h1 > h2), or two-
tailed (h1 ≠ h2). The Mann-Whitney test does not require the data to 
come from normally distributed populations, but it does make the fol­
lowing assumptions:
• The populations of interest have the same shape.
• The populations are independent.
Kruskal-Wallis
Similar to the one-way ANOVA test. It is one of the most versatile tests. 
When the p value is less than 0.05, conclude that at least one mean is different:
H0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = … = μn
Ha: At least one mean is different.

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  483
Mood’s Median Test
Mood’s median test can be used to test the equality of medians from two 
or more populations and, like the Kruskal-Wallis test, provides a nonpara­
metric alternative to the one-way analysis of variance. Mood’s median test 
is sometimes called a sign scores test. Mood’s median test tests:
H0: The population medians are all equal.
H1: The medians are not all equal.
An assumption of Mood’s median test is that the data from each population 
are independent random samples and the population distributions have the 
same shape. Mood’s median test is robust against outliers and errors in data 
and is particularly appropriate in the preliminary stages of analysis. Mood’s 
median test is more robust than the Kruskal-Wallis test against outliers, but 
is less powerful for data from many distributions, including the normal.
Friedman Test for a Randomized Block Design
The analysis of variance tests are quite robust with respect to the violation 
of their assumptions, providing that the k groups are all of the same size. 
There are certain kinds of correlated-samples situations where the viola­
tion of one or more assumptions might be so extreme that their use may 
cast doubt on any result produced by an analysis of variance. In cases of 
this sort, a useful nonparametric alternative can be found in a rank-based 
procedure known as the Friedman test.
In both of the situations the assumption of an equal-interval scale (like 
a ruler) of measurement is clearly not met. There is a good chance that the 
assumption of a normal distribution of the source population(s) would 
also not be met. Other cases where the equal-interval assumption will be 
thoroughly violated include those in which the scale of measurement is 
intrinsically nonlinear, for example, the decibel scale of sound intensity, 
the Richter scale of earthquake intensity, or any logarithmic scale.
Use this test when there are two kinds of correlated-samples situations where 
the use of the nonparametric alternative of Friedman would be advisable:
• The first would be the case where the k measures for each subject 
start out as mere rank orderings. Example: to assess the likely results 
of an upcoming election, the 30 members of a representative “focus 

484  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
group” of eligible voters are each asked to rank the three candidates, 
A, B, and C, in the order of their preference (1 = most preferred, 3 = 
least preferred).
• A second would be the case where measures start out as mere 
ratings. Example: The members of the focus group are instead 
asked to rate candidates on a 10-point scale (1 = lowest rating, 10 = 
highest).
POPULATIONS AND SAMPLES
Definition
A population is the entire collection of units whose characteristics are 
of interest. A sample is a portion or subset of units taken from the 
population whose characteristics are actually measured.
Just the Facts
We would like to base our decisions on the “true” characteristics of the 
process as a whole—the population. However, in practice, we usually work 
with a limited amount of data that we observe and record as units are 
produced—a sample. (See Figures 10.35 and 10.36.)
Definitions
• A population is the entire collection of 
units whose characteristics are of 
interest.
• A sample is a portion or subset of units 
taken from the population whose 
characteristics are actually measured.
• A parameter describes the “true” value 
of a characteristic. A parameter’s value 
is fixed but usually unknown.
• A statistic, any number calculated from 
sample data, describes a sample 
characteristic. A statistic’s value is 
known for a specific sample, but usually 
changes from sample to sample.

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  485
Uncertainty in the Mean—Conclusions
How well a sample represents the population depends on:
• The sampling method
• The amount of variation from sample to sample
• The number of units in the sample (sample size)
The larger the sample, the more confidence we have in the estimate.

Data are the “raw material” of measurement. Rarely can we use data 
without first compiling, categorizing, displaying, and/or analyzing it. But 
no measurement can take place without first having some data.
Summary of Data Types

The type of data you collect will determine which LSS tools may be 
applied to your project.
Process Measurements Summary
For any process, regardless of data type:
• Decisions driven by data are superior to those made without data.
• Sample statistics give us information, which allows us to find and 
measure process improvements.
To increase customer satisfaction, the goal of Lean Six Sigma is to reduce 
variation such that:
• For defectives data, units are acceptable as initially produced correct 
the first time.
• For defects data, units are produced without defects.
• For continuous data, units show minimal deviation from the speci­
fied target.
Your choice of a unit and a defect will determine how to measure your 
project’s success.
Example
You take a sample of 20 employees and measure the height of each of them 
and find that the heights are distributed with the shortest person being 5 
feet 3 inches, the tallest being 6 feet 2 inches, and a mean height is 5 feet 
11¾ inches tall. If this is a representative sample of the 200 employees in 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  487
the company, then you would expect to find the population distribution of 
heights to give a similar result. Since this is only a sample, we would actu­
ally expect the population sample to be broader, and the mean will most 
probably vary from the sample mean.
REGRESSION ANALYSIS
You can’t vary everything at the same time and understand what the prob­
lem is.
Definition
Regression analysis is a mathematical method of modeling the rela­
tionships among three or more variables. It is used to predict the value 
of one variable given the values of the others. For example, a model 
might estimate sales based on age and gender. A regression analysis 
yields an equation that expresses the relationship. (Computer Desktop 
Encyclopedia © 2011)
A statistical technique for analyzing the relationship between two or 
more variables, and which may be used to predict the value of one vari­
able from the other or others. (The Oxford English Dictionary)
Just the Facts
The relationship between independent variables and the dependent vari­
able can be represented by a mathematical model called a regression equa­
tion. The regression model is fit to a set of sample data. The sample data 
should come from a well-designed experiment in order to guarantee 
that the full range of possible combinations of the independent variables 
is represented and that the design is balanced. In most cases, the true 

488  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
relationship between the X’s and Y’s is unknown and the experimenter 
chooses a polynomial model to approximate these relationships.
	
Y = b0+b1X1+b2X2+b12X1X2+b11X1
2+b22X2
2
Similar analysis can be applied to other model equations.
Regression methods are often used to analyze data from raw produc­
tion data such as historical records. While this is useful as an approxi­
mation, it can also lead to erroneous relationships, especially if there are 
interactions between two or more of the independent variables. Applying 
a regression analysis to a statistically designed experiment, especially 
one specifically designed to fit an equation, is more likely to identify 
which independent variables are more important and which independent 
variables interact with each other to significantly affect the dependent 
variable. The regression builds a quantitative model that identifies these 
relationships.
Simple Linear Regression
Assuming that there is only one independent variable (X) and the depen­
dent response variable (Y), we can determine the relationship between X 
and Y. In order for this relationship to accurately represent this relationship, 
the X variables should be continuous over the range of interest; i.e., there 
must be a continuous response over the range of X’s used. Designing an 
experiment, the X values are carefully chosen by the experimenter and the 
resulting responses observed. If we assume that the relationship between X 
and Y is a straight line, then the expected value of Y for each X is:
	
Ŷ = β0 + β1X
where Ŷ is the expected value for the Y response and the parameters of 
the straight line β0 and β1 are unknown constants. We assume that each 
observation Y can be described by the model
	
Ŷ = β0 + β1X + ε
where ε is a random error with mean zero and variance σ2. The {ε} are 
also assumed to be uncorrelated random variables. The regression model 
involving only a single independent variable x is often called the simple 
linear regression model.

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  489
Multiple Linear Regression
If there is more than one independent variable involved, then the equation 
is expanded. If we assume that there are three X variables involved, then 
the regression model for a linear relationship would be:
	
Ŷ = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + β3X3 + ε
Curvilinear Regression
These fit equations such as polynomial, exponential, and lognormal equa­
tions to a set of data where linearity is not indicated.
Other Linear Regression Models
The linear model y = Xβ + ε is a general model. It can be used to fit any 
relationship that is linear in the unknown parameters β. An example 
would be the (kth) degree polynomial in one variable:
	
y = β0 + β1x + β2x2 + · · · + βkxk + ε
Other examples include the second-degree polynomial in two variables:
	
y = β0 + β1 Xl + β2 X2 + β11 X1
2 + β22X2
2 + β12Xl X2 + ε
and the trigonometric model:
	
y = β0 + β1 sin x + β2 cos x + ε
Use the general linear model y = Xβ + ε to fit models.
Caution
Regression analysis is often misused. Care must be taken when select­
ing the independent variables used to generate the regression model. 
If the data are not carefully chosen, it is possible to create a model that 
is meaningless.
It is imperative that the regression equation only be applied to the range 
of values of the independent variables used in generating the equation. 
Extrapolating beyond this range can lead to significant errors. If we assume 
a linear relationship and the regression equation fits with a minimum 

490  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
error, there is no guarantee that the relationship will not become nonlin­
ear outside of the range of X’s used in the experimental data. Regression 
models should never be used for extrapolation.
There are several commercially available programs for designing and eval­
uating experiments. While these programs make performing the calcula­
tions easier, they should be used with caution and the raw data should be 
examined to determine if there are any outliers that could significantly affect 
the resultant regression equation. Minitab and JMP are among the leading 
programs for statistical designing and evaluation of experimental data.

ROLLED-THROUGHPUT YIELD

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  491
One percent loss at an operation is bad, but if you have it at many opera­
tions in the process, it is a disaster.
Definition
Rolled-throughput yield (RTY) is calculated by dividing the total units 
reworked and scrapped divided by the total units started.
Just the Facts
The use of first-pass yield (FPY) and rolled-throughput yield (RTY) cal­
culations provides a good measure of quality performance at the task and 
process levels. Only units that meet requirements at each step count as 
“done right.” (See Figure 10.37.)
From which measure of process performance should we calculate pro­
cess sigma? Rolled-throughput and first-pass yield performance is often 
used to calculate process sigma. Why?
• Defects/errors, once produced, add waste and cost (some costs are 
easy to quantify and some not).
• Even the best inspection processes cannot catch all defects/errors.
• The payback is generally bigger when keeping defects/errors from 
occurring.

TAGUCHI METHOD
Robust designs lead to outstanding quality.
Definition
The Taguchi method defines:
• Ideal quality
• Quality loss function
• His philosophy of a robust design

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  493
Just the Facts
To understand the impact of variation in terms of cost, you must under­
stand the Taguchi method (Figure 10.38).
Taguchi Quality Definitions
Ideal Quality
• Reference point (target value) for determining the quality level of a 
product or service
• Delivery of a product or a service that reliably performs its intended 
use throughout its life cycle under reasonable conditions
Robust Design
• An Engineering methodology for improving productivity during 
research and development so that high-quality products can be pro­
duced quickly and at low cost.
• Products and services designed defect-free and of high quality
• A design with minimum sensitivity to variations in uncontrollable 
factors
Quality Loss Function Fundamental Concepts
• Economic and societal penalties incurred as a result of purchasing a 
nonconforming product.

494  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
• Any loss in quality is defined as a deviation from a target, not a fail­
ure to conform to an arbitrary specification.
• High quality can only be achieved economically by being designed 
in from the start, not by inspection and screening.
Example
Traditional View of the Loss Function
Only parts considered outside of the specification limits are considered to be 
equally nonconforming and equally impacting on the customer and society.
Taguchi Approach
In the Taguchi approach, loss relative to the specification limit is not 
assumed to be a step function. For example, is it realistic to believe that 
there is no exposure (loss) when a unit is barely within the specification 
limit and the maximum loss is assigned when the part is just outside the 
specification limit? Taguchi rejects the concept of loss assignment only 
at the step function (Figure 10.39). Instead, it assigns a parabola curve 
starting at the nominal target. Most people now agree with the Taguchi 
approach to loss function.
Specify a Target
This is a standard quality graph. Its X axis represents performance of char­
acteristics, and the Y axis represents a loss to society. Taguchi disagreed 
with the use of LSL/USL exclusively and contended that any movement 
from the target would eventually negatively impact society. It was not 
good enough to prove process capability (CPK), but that any movement 
from the target is bad. (See Figure 10.40.)
The Quadratic Loss Function (QFL)
The added curve line represents the quadratic loss function, and how 
losses to society rise quickly as performance moves away from the nomi­
nal target. Taguchi used a quadratic loss function to show that any vari­
ation from a specified target causes a loss to the customer and society. 
Minimizing variation will prevent both losses. (See Figure 10.41.)

QLF is a quadratic function and an approximation of variation around 
the target value, m. (See Figure 10.42.)
	
L = loss
	
M = target value
	
y = value of the quality characteristic
	
y – m = deviation from target at y
QLF model:
	
L(y) = k(y – m)2
	
1.	K is a constant (the cost coefficient).
	
2.	y – m is deviation from the target.
	
3.	Loss is proportional to the square of the deviation from the target value.
Understanding the Quality Characteristic
The rate of loss increase depends on the financial importance of the qual­
ity characteristic. If the characteristic is a critical dimension for safety, 
the loss will increase faster than a less important characteristic as the per­
formance moves farther from the target. There are two questions to ask:
	
1.	What is the financial importance of the characteristic?
	
2.	What is the rate of acceleration as the characteristic moves away 
from the target?

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  497
Mathematically the question is: What is the steepness of the slope of 
the parabola?
Observing the Slope
Loss accelerates more quickly with characteristic C than A. The functional 
loss is the maximum permissible deviation from target, not necessarily 
the specification. The customer’s loss is the average loss generated when 
deviation has a cost impact on the customer. (See Figure 10.43.)
Determining Customer Impact
The average customer loss due to poor quality usually calculates costs such as:
• Cost to repair
• Cost to replace
• Time considerations to deal with the issue
The Cost of Not Being on Target
• Specifications allow variance—a target is an attempt to have no vari­
ance—which means what?
• There are costs for being above or below the target value.
• As we get further from the target value, the loss increases:
• Tolerance stack-up
• Increased opportunity for scrap or rework
• Lower performance
• Wasted material

VALIDATION
Definition
The process of confirming that the product or service meets the require­
ments of fulfilling the purpose for which it was designed. Validation 
tests inputs and outputs and differs from verification, which tests the 
product or service in the actual environment that it is to be used. There 
can be a disconnect between validation and verification.
Just the Facts
Standard validation tools include periodic process reviews, audits, devel­
opment history record generation, and review and objective testing. 
Validation, therefore, involves several tools, starting with a robust risk 
analysis. Before we can test the failure of a product or process, we need to 
identify the modes in which the product or service can fail and put into 
place processes to mitigate and eliminate them.
Validation, therefore, evaluates the effectiveness of the change or inno­
vation that has been implemented. If validation is not performed, then 
there is no assurance that the change is effective in achieving the perfor­
mance that the change or innovation was designed to achieve.
The validation protocol confirms or denies the effectiveness of a Six 
Sigma project on achieving the desired results.
The Failure Modalities
Failures may be:
• Gradual wear over time of use
• Catastrophic, failing all at once
• A combination of the two
A light bulb is an example of a catastrophic failure. Automobile brake 
pads are an example of gradual wear to failure. Automobile tires are a 
hybrid failure mode, as catastrophic failure may occur from road hazards.
Accelerated failure testing techniques have been developed and are used 
to estimate the service time for a product. An example is automobile tire 
wear. The tire companies test the wear properties of their tires on special 

Advanced Statistical Tools  •  499
equipment that is designed to represent the kind of environment that the 
tire will experience on a vehicle. To the degree that this test accurately 
represents the actual environment that the product will experience is the 
degree to which the outcome will match the actual performance of the tire.
Some Risk Assessment Tools
Besides risk analysis, other tools that are useful in evaluating and validating 
the performance of a product include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA)
• Process failure modes and effects analysis (PFMEA)
• Accelerated life testing
• Highly accelerated life test (HALT)
• Highly accelerated stress screening (HASS)
• Burn-in
• Mean time between failures (MTBF)
• Mean time to failure (MTTF)
• Risk analysis programs
While it is not our intention to cover all of the tools, we will give an overview 
of some of them here. It is recommended that the LSSBB study and become 
familiar with these and other accelerated tests so that he or she will be able to 
choose the appropriate accelerated test to use for the product or service.
• HALT testing is commonly used on electronic components and fin­
ished products and involves temperature, random vibration, mar­
ginal power, and power cycling testing over time and identifying all 
modes of failure as either recoverable (the circuit recovers its func­
tion after testing) or permanent (the circuit is no longer functional 
in one or more modes). This test is used mainly to determine failure 
modes and not an estimate of expected life of a completed product.
• HASS is usually applied to the process of estimating expected life by 
accelerating the failure rate by testing under elevated temperatures. 
It is usually applied to production products.
• MTBF and MTTF are used to estimate the expected service life of a 
product. To use these, we need to establish the kind of failure that we 
expect. Failures may be gradual wear over time of use, catastrophic, 
failing all at once, or a combination of the two.

500  •  The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
A robust risk analysis program will help to identify and mitigate poten­
tial failure modes.
Guidelines and Tips
A risk analysis program may follow the following sequence:
• FMEA and PFMEA
• Identify potential failure modes
• Identify mitigation and elimination design activities
• Identifying the failure modes
• Catastrophic
• Gradual over time
• Combinations
−
−Initial catastrophic failure
−
−Gradual failure to a catastrophic failure
−
−Gradual failure to end of life
−
−Some initial failure and then catastrophic end-of-life failure
• Selecting test methods to test the failure modes
• Select accelerated life tests to:
• Confirm the failure mode
• Establish the serviceable life
• Give feedback to design for improvements
Example
Several electronic units are tested at elevated temperatures and their per­
formance monitored over time. The elevated temperature is believed to 
be the main function in accelerating the failure of the electronic circuit. 
When a failure occurs, its failure mode is evaluated, recoverable or non­
recoverable. From the sample performance, the estimated serviceable life 
can be calculated.

needs and future requirements. Adaptability is an area largely 
ignored but is critical for gaining a competitive advantage in the 
marketplace. Customers always remember how you handle or

done right every time.
Area activity analysis (AAA): A proven approach used by each natural 
work team (area) to establish efficiency and effectiveness measure­
ment systems, performance standards, improvement goals, and 
feedback systems that are aligned with the organization’s objec­
tives and understood by the employees involved.

the root cause of a problem.
Assumption evaluation: Provides a way of redefining problem state­
ments, analyzing solutions, and generating new ideas.
Attribute control chart: A plot of attributes data of some parameter of a 
process’s performance, usually determined by regular sampling 
of the product, service, or process as a function (usually) of time 
or unit number or other chronological variable. This is a fre­
quency distribution plotted continuously over time, which gives 

Appendix A: Glossary  •  503
immediate feedback about the behavior of a process. A control 
chart will have the following elements:
• Center line (CL)
• Upper control limit (UCL)
• Lower control limit (LCL)
Attributes data: Counted data that can be classified as either yes/no, 
accept/reject, black/white, or go/no-go. These data are usually 
easy to collect because they require only counting and are not 
measuring the process, but they often require large samples.
Automation: The use of robots, machinery, or software to eliminate repet­
itive and boring jobs previously done by people. Automation is 
the automatic operation and control of machinery or processes by

tion point when the rejected parts have been removed from the line.
Axiomatic design: This approach provides a framework of principles that 
guide the design engineers of products, services, or processes. The 
approach reduces the complexity of the design process. Its pur­
pose is to make the human designer more creative by reducing the 
random search process, thereby minimizing the trials and errors 
that are made during the design process.
Bar graph: Have bands positioned horizontally (bars) or vertically (col­
umns) that, by their height or length, show variations in the mag­
nitude of several measurements. The bars and columns may be 
multiple to show two or more related measurements in several 
situations.
Bathtub curve: A picture of an item’s failure rate versus time. It shows

time, risk, and performance results (examples: return on invest­
ment, customer satisfaction, market share, risk, value-added per 
employee, time to implement, cost to implement, etc.).
Bivariate distribution: A three-dimensional plot where the X and Y 
axes represent the independent variables, and the Z axis repre­
sents the frequency for discrete data or the probability of con­
tinuous data.
Black Belts: Highly trained team leaders responsible for implementing 
process improvement projects within an organization. They have 
a deep understanding of statistical methods and have a detailed 
understanding of how to use DMAIC and DMADV. They are nor­
mally full-time assignments, for each Black Belt is expected to save 
the organization a minimum of $1 million per year. Black Belts 
focus on customer/business alignment, and that includes both 
hard and soft dollar savings. They have been trained to manage the 
projects by fact, process, and project management methodology, 
not by gut feel. Black Belts coach Green Belts and receive coaching 
support from Master Black Belts.
Block: A part of the experimental material that is likely to be more homo­
geneous than the whole.

a specific problem or condition. The effect is listed on the right-
hand side and the causes take the shape of fish bones. This is the 
reason it is sometimes called a fishbone diagram. It is also called 
an Ishikawa diagram.

506  •  Appendix A: Glossary
Cause-and-effect matrix: A tool used to evaluate the net impact of poten­
tial X’s versus various Y’s or goals in order to make a first pass 
at setting aside potential X’s that are not likely to impact the Y’s, 
thereby eliminating elements that do not have to be statistically 
evaluated. It is an excellent tool to align significant process inputs 
with customer requirements.
c-Charts: Plot the number of defects per sample, with a constant sample 
size.
Cellular manufacturing: A tool used to produce your product in the 
least amount of time using the least amount of resources. When 
applying the cellular manufacturing tool, you group products 
by value-adding process steps, assess the customer demand rate 
(Takt time), then configure the cell using Lean Six Sigma con­
cepts and tools. This is a powerful tool to allow the use of many 
Lean concepts and tools together to achieve dramatic process 
improvements.
Central composite design: This design contains an embedded factorial 
or fractional factorial matrix with a center point augmented with 
a group of star points that allows the curvature to be estimated. 
This design always contains twice as many star points as there are 
factors in the design, and the star points represent the extremes, 
high and low, of each design factor.
Central tendency: A measure of the center of the distribution.
Certification: Applies to a single operation or piece of equipment. When 
an acceptable level of confidence has been developed that proves

change.
Changee: Individual/group who must actually change. A changee is also 
called a change target.

manner. The forms are used to minimize the risk of errors and to 
facilitate the organized collection and analysis of data.
Collecting data: A systematic way of acquiring information about a spe­
cific point of interest.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  507
Common cause: A source of errors that is always present because it is 
part of the random variation in the process itself. These types of 
failures are normally traced back to the process, which only man­
agement can correct.
Communication techniques: The many processes that are available to 
deliver and send messages through an organization by various 
channels, such as e-mail, meetings, gossip, newsletters, etc.
Comparative analysis: A systematic way of comparing an item to another 
item to identify improvement opportunities and/or gaps. (It is the 
first three phases in the benchmarking process.)
Comparative experiments: An experiment whose objective is to compare 
the treatments rather than determine absolute values.
Competitive benchmarking: A form of external benchmarking that 
requires investigating a competitor’s products, services, and pro­
cesses. The most common way to do this is to purchase competi­
tive products and services and analyze them to identify competitive 
advantages.
Confidence limits: A calculated measure of the accuracy of the results 
obtained from pulling a sample of a complete population. For 
example: Your confidence level may be 90% that the cycle time is 
3 hours plus or minus 2%.

more parties are in disagreement with each other. Often, conflict 
resolution ends up with a compromise on the position each party 
took in the original conditions.
Consensus: An interactive process, involving all group members, where 
ideas are openly exchanged and discussed until all group members 
accept and support a decision, even though some of the group’s 
members may not completely agree with it. To reach a consensus is 
time-consuming and often involves individual compromising.

is set up where there is no buffer between individual activities. 
The product is continuously moving without going into a storage 
area.

occur within a process by detecting variation that is inherent in 

508  •  Appendix A: Glossary
the process and separating it from variation that is changing the 
process (special causes).

control over to ensure that only acceptable products and services 
are delivered to the customer. They are divided into two sub-
categories: prevention costs and no-value-added costs.
Corrective action: Action that is taken to prevent re-occurrence of a problem. 
It is usually taken when an error/nonconformity is detected that war­
rants expending effort and money to prevent it from re-occurring.
Correlation coefficient (r): Used to quantify the degree of linear associa­
tion between two variables. Its value can range all the way from –1 
to +1. In a formula it is usually represented by a small r.
Cost driver: Any factor that causes a change in cost of an activity.
Cost of quality: A process developed by Val Feigenbaum when he was qual­
ity director at a General Electric Division in the 1950s and put all 
the quality-related activities into a single cost base that could be 
added together. It is made up of four parts: prevention costs, inter­
nal defect costs, external defect costs, and appraisal costs.
Cost, quality, features, and availability (CQFA): Customers evaluate and 
select suppliers based upon the four factors of cost, quality, fea­
tures, and availability. An organization must excel in one of these 
to stay on the market. The more of these four factors that an orga­
nization excels in, the greater value they provide. Organizations 
survive based upon the value provided in the CQFA grid.
Creative thinking: A methodology designed to stimulate and encourage 
creativity and innovation within an organization and individuals.
Creativity: Developing new or different ideas.
Critical path methodology: Normally used with a project work break­
down structure where there is one path through the complex 
process that determines when the process is completed. By iden­
tifying this path the project manager can focus on ensuring that 
cycle time and cost are optimized, thereby minimizing the risk of 
not completing the budget on time and on schedule.
Critical to quality (CTQ): Key measurable characteristics of a product or 
a process that are set to ensure customer satisfaction. They help 
ensure that the improvement activities are in line with the cus­
tomer requirements. These customers can be either internal or 
external customers.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  509

upon completing a project.
Current state maps: Flow diagrams of the present process as it is operat­
ing prior to implementing a change.
Customer-dissatisfaction poor-quality costs: The lost profits because 
customers buy competitive products because they perceive that 
the competitor’s product is better quality or because the customer 
has had or knows someone that has had an unsatisfactory experi­
ence with the organization.
Customer-incurred poor-quality costs: The costs that the customer 
incurs when a product or service fails to perform to the customer’s 
expectations. Example: Loss of productivity while equipment is 
down, or travel costs and time spent to return defective merchan­
dise, and the repair cost after the warranty period.
Customer requirements: Stated or implied terms that the customer requires 
to be provided with in order for him or her not to be dissatisfied.
Customer surveys: Obtaining customers’ opinions related to the service 
or products supplied. This can be done in many ways, including 
phone calls, written surveys, focus groups, one-on-one meetings, 
etc.
CuSum control charts (cumulative sum): An alternative to the Shewhart 
concept of control charts. It was primarily developed in the late 
1990s to create a CuSum chart to collect m sample groups, each 
the size of an m, and compute the X bar sub i of each sample. 
Determine Ssubm or S prime subm using the appropriate formu­
las. CuSum control charts are very effective at discerning shifts in 
the process mean that are less than two sigma.
Cycle time: The actual time from the point when all of the input has been 
received by the task until an output has been delivered to the next 
task.
Cycle time analysis: An approach to reduce the time that it takes to move 
an item through a process.
Decision-making matrix: The team defines the desired results. Then it 
makes a list of the criteria that are givens (must have) and wants 
(would like to have). The alternative solutions are compared to the 
givens and wants list, and a risk analysis is made.

510  •  Appendix A: Glossary
Defects per million opportunities (DPMO): Average number of errors 
that would occur in a million opportunities to make an error. 
It is not the number of defects in a million items. For example, 
if an item had 10 opportunities for being defective and there 
were 15 errors in the 1 million units, that would be 1.5 errors 
per million opportunities. We use errors in place of defects 
because Six Sigma is now being applied to service areas where 
defects are not normally seen, but there are many opportunities 
to make errors.
Delphi narrowing technique: A technique where team members’ priori­
ties are used to reduce a list of alternatives to a few of the most

is used to determine how to design a product for ease of manufac­
turing. It is usually done by performing concurrent engineering, 
where manufacturing engineering develops the manufacturing 
process along with the design.
Design for Six Sigma (DFSS): See DMADV.
Design for X (DFX): An approach when the design team develops a prod­
uct or service with as many desirable characteristics as possible, 
when viewed from the consumers’ standpoint. This approach 
includes characteristics like safety, friendliness, serviceability, 
reliability, quality, maintainability, cost, and features. It is based 
principally on work done by Watson and Radcliffe in 1988. It 
includes factors like safety, quality, reliability, testability, manu­
facturability, design for assembly, environmental, serviceabil­
ity, maintainability, repairability, user-friendliness, ergonomics 
appearance, packaging, features, and time-to-market.
Design of experiments (DOE): A structure-organized method of deter­
mining the relationship between factors affecting a process and the 
output of that process. It is a structured evaluation designed to yield 
a maximum amount of information at a defined confidence level at 

Appendix A: Glossary  •  511
the least expense. DOE is a set of principles and formulas for cre­
ating experiments to define regions of variable value that support 
customer satisfaction or to define relations between variables for 
having more accurate models of phenomena.
Direct poor-quality costs: Costs that can be identified in the organiza­
tion’s ledger.
Discrete data: Based on count. It cannot be broken down into sub-
divisions. For example, it is the number of customer complaints 
that are received per week. It is also referred to as qualitative 
data.
DMADV: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify. It is Six Sigma’s 
approach to using data for designing products and processes that 
are capable of performing at the Six Sigma level.

Sigma’s version of Shewhart’s Plan-Do-Check-Act problem analy­
sis technique. Each step in this cycle is designed to ensure the best 
possible results.

the level of the factor. (Applicable only for factors at two levels 
each.)
Effectiveness: The extent to which an output of a process or sub-process 
meets the needs and expectations of its customers. A synonym 
for effectiveness is quality. Effectiveness is having the right output 
at the right place at the right time at the right price. Effectiveness 
impacts the customer.
Efficiency: The extent to which resources are minimized and waste is 
eliminated in the pursuit of effectiveness. Productivity is a mea­
sure of efficiency.
Equipment certification: An evaluation of each piece of equipment to 
define its accuracy, repeatability, drift, and capabilities so that it 
can be matched to the product specifications.
Equipment poor-quality costs: The cost invested in equipment used to 
measure, accept, or control the products or services, plus the cost 
of the space the equipment occupies and its maintenance costs. 
This category also includes any costs related to preparing software 
to control and operate the equipment.

ment, and optimization.
Experimental unit: An experimental unit is one item to which a single 
treatment is applied in one replication of the basic experiment.
Exponential distribution: Used to model items that consist of failure rates, 
usually electronic items. This exponential distribution is closely 
related to the Poisson distribution. It is usually used to model the 
mean time between occurrences, such as arrivals or failures. It usu­
ally measures probability of occurrence per time interval.
External and internal customers: All organizations have internal and 
external customers. The output from any activity within an orga­
nization that goes to another individual within the organization 
has created an internal customer-supplier relationship. The per­
son who receives the input is the internal customer. External cus­
tomers are individuals or organizations that are not part of the 
organization that is producing the product. They typically buy the 
product for themselves or for distribution.
F-test: An evaluation of two samples taken from different populations to 
determine if they have the same standard deviation at a specific 
confidence level.
Facilitor of teams: An individual who is assigned to work with the team 
to make the meetings run more effectively. They work to ensure 
that the team functions correctly, not to participate in solving the 
problem.

focuses a group’s attention on a single process for a 1- or 2-day 
meeting to define how the group can improve the process over 
the next 90 days. Before the end of the meeting, management 
approves or rejects the proposed improvements.
First-time yield (FTY): The number of good parts that go into an operation 
divided by the number of acceptable parts going out of the opera­
tion without any rework. First-time yield for a total process is cal­
culated by multiplying the first-time yield at each activity times the 
first-time yield at each activity in the process. It represents the num­
ber of parts that go through the process without being reworked or 
scrapped. It is also called roll-through yield (RTY).

workplace. A translation of the original 5S terms from Japanese to 
English went like this:
• Seiri—Organization
• Seiton—Orderliness
• Seiso—Cleanliness

• Shitsuke—Discipline
	
In order to assist users of this tool to remember the elements the 
original terminology has been retranslated to the following 5S’s.
• Sort
• Set-in-order
• Shine
• Standardize
• Sustain
Five whys (5W’s): A technique to get to the root cause of the problem. It 
is the practice of asking five times or more why the failure has 
occurred in order to get to the root cause. Each time an answer 
is given, you ask why that particular condition occurred.

being analyzed takes place to define the group’s opinion/sugges­
tions related to the item being discussed.
Force field analysis: A visual aid for pinpointing and analyzing elements 
that resist change (restraining forces) or push for change (driving 
forces). This technique helps drive improvement by developing 
plans to overcome the restrainers and make maximum use of the 
driving forces.
Fractional factorial: A type of design of experiment (DOE) where selected 
combinations of factors and levels are analyzed. It is useful when 
a number of potential factors are involved in causing an error 
to occur because it reduces the total number of runs required to 
define the high potential root causes.
Full factorial: A design of experiment that measures the response of every 
possible combination of factors and levels. It provides information 
about every main effect and each interacting effect. It is normally 
not used when there are more than five factors involved in the 
evaluation.
Full factorial design: A design in which every setting of every factor 
appears with every setting of every other factor is a full factorial 
design. This is not recommended for five or more factors.
Function diagrams: A systematic way of graphically displaying detailed 
tasks related to broader objectives or detailed issues related to 
broader issues.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  515
Future state mapping: This usually takes the form of a flow diagram or a 
simulation model where a proposed change is drawn out pictori­
ally to better understand the process. In the case where a simula­
tion model is developed, the process can be operated over a period 
of time based on the assumptions made in the simulation model 
to determine how effectively it will operate.
Gantt chart: A Gantt chart is a bar chart laid on its side. It is typically used 
for conveying a project schedule. It is an effective way of identify­
ing interrelationships between tasks and helping to define critical 
paths through a process or project.
Gap analysis: A gap analysis is used to compare a present item to a pro­
posed item. It typically will compare efficiency and effectiveness 
measurements between one product and a competitor’s prod­
uct or one process and another process. It reveals the amount 
of improvement necessary to bring it in line with the process or 
product it is being compared to.
Graeco-Latin design: This experimental design is often useful in eliminat­
ing more than two sources of variability in an experiment. This is 
an extension of the Latin square design with one additional block­
ing value, resulting in a total of three blocking variables.

set of numbers or statistics.
Green Belt: An individual who has been trained in the improvement meth­
odologies of Six Sigma and will be able to lead a Six Sigma process 
improvement team or work on a process improvement team that 
is led by a Black Belt or Master Black Belt. This is a part-time job 
and Green Belts maintain their full-time job while performing this 
activity. They work under the guidance of a Black Belt.

Hoshin kanri: This in an annual planning process that is used to develop 
the hoshin plan or policy development. It is used to set the direc­
tion of the improvement activities within the organization. Hoshin 
is made up of two Chinese words: ho, which means “method or 
form,” and shin, which means “shiny needle or compass.” Kanri 
means “control or management.” It is a very systematic, step-
by-step planning process that breaks down strategic objectives 
against daily management tasks and activities.
House of quality: A matrix format used to organize various data elements, 
so named for its shape. It is the principle tool of QFD.
Hypothesis testing: Hypothesis testing refers to the process of using 
statistical analysis to determine if the observations that differ 
between two or more samples are caused by random chance or by 
true differences in the sample. A null hypothesis (Ho) is a stated 
assumption that there is no difference in the parameters of two 
or more populations. The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is a statement 
that the observed differences or relationships between the popula­
tions are real and are not the results of chance or an error in the 
sampling approach.
Independent variable: An independent variable is an input or process 
variable that can be set directly to achieve a desired result. A vari­
able that we control during an experiment.
Indirect cost: The costs that are imposed on an output that is not directly 
related to the cost of the incoming materials or the activities that 
transform it into an output. It is all the support costs that are 
needed to run the business that are applied against the product in 
order to make a profit, for example, the cost of accounting, per­
sonnel, ground maintenance, etc.
Indirect poor-quality costs: Costs that are incurred by the customer or

project that are not documented in the formal accounting process. 

Appendix A: Glossary  •  517
They are often called soft benefits. Frequently they are savings that 
result from preventive action that stops errors from occurring.
Interaction: If the effect of one factor is different at different levels of another 
factor, the two factors are said to interact or to have interaction.
Internal error costs: The costs incurred by the organization as a result 
of errors detected before the organization’s customer accepts the 
output. In other words, these are the costs the organization incurs 
before a product or service is accepted by the customer because 
someone did not do the job right the first time.
Interrelationship diagrams: A way to graphically map out the cause-and-
effect links among related items.
Interviewing: A structured discussion with one or more other people to 
collect information related to a specific subject.
ISO 9000 Series: A group of standards released by the International 
Organization for Standardization, Zurich, Switzerland, that defines 
the fundamental building blocks for a quality management system 
and the associated accreditation and registration of QMS.
IT applications: All of the IT tools that are used to bring about perfor­
mance improvement in the organization. They are usually used to 
eliminate the tedious jobs that employees continuously do and to 
reduce the potential for employees making errors.
Just-in-time: A major strategy that allows an organization to produce only 
what is needed—when it’s needed—to satisfy immediate customer 
requirements. Implemented effectively, the just-in-time concept 
will almost eliminate in-process stock.
Kaikaku: A transformation of thinking. This is a revolutionary type of 
activity, while Kaizen is evolutionary. Kaikaku is similar to pro­
cess re-engineering or redesign. Kaikaku can also be described 
as a series of Kaizen activities completed in unison, forming and 
exhibiting the presence of a Lean mindset.
Kaizen: A Japanese term that means continuous improvement. Kai means 
“change” and zen means “good or for the better.”
Kaizen blitz: This means a sudden, overpowering effort to take a process, sys­
tem, product, or service apart and put it back together in a better way.
Kakushin: Kakushin is innovation. The creation of something completely 
new. It is essential for the growth of all companies.
Kanban: Usually a printed card that contains specific information related 
to parts, such as the part name, number, quantity needed, etc. It 

518  •  Appendix A: Glossary
is the primary communication used in just-in-time manufactur­
ing. It is used to maintain effective flow of materials through an 
entire manufacturing system while minimizing inventory and 
work-in-process. It is used in place of complex production control 
computer systems.
Kano model: A model that was created by Prof. Noriaki Kano that clas­
sifies customer preferences into five categories: attractive, one-
dimensional, must-be, indifferent, and reverse. The Kano model 
of customer satisfaction classifies product attributes based on how 
they are perceived by the customer and their effect on customer 
satisfaction. This model is useful in guiding the organization in 
determining when good is good enough and more is better.
Key performance indicator (KPI): These measurements indicate the 
key performance parameters related to a process, organization, 
or output. They are the key ways by which that item is measured 
and are usually used to set performance standards and continu­
ous improvement objectives. They are sometimes called critical 
performance indicators (CPIs).
Knowledge management: A system for capturing the knowledge that 
is contained within an organization. It groups knowledge into 
two categories. The first classification is tacit knowledge (soft 
knowledge). This knowledge is undocumented, intangible factors 
embodied in an individual’s experience. The second classification 
is explicit knowledge (hard knowledge). This knowledge is docu­
mented and quantified.
Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis: A way to look at differences among the 
population’s medians. It is a hypothesis test of the equality of pop­
ulation medians for a one-way design with two or more popula­
tions. It offers a nonparametric alternative to the one-way analysis 
of variance.
Latin square designs: Essentially a fractional factorial experiment that 
requires less experimentation to determine the main impacting 
areas. It is used when it is desirable to allow for two sources of non­
homogeneity in the conditions affecting the test. This approach is 
limited by two conditions:
• There should be no interactions between rows and column factors 
because these can’t be measured.
• The number of rows, columns, and treatments must be the same.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  519
Lean Manufacturing: A focus on eliminating all waste in the manufac­
turing process. It includes Lean principles like:
• Zero inventory
• Batch to flow, cutting batch size
• Line balancing
• Zero wait time
• Pull instead of push production control systems
• Cutting actual process time
Lean metric: Lean metrics allow companies to measure, evaluate, and 
respond to their performance in a balanced way, without sacrific­
ing the quality to meet quantity objectives, or increasing inven­
tory levels to achieve machine efficiencies. The type of the Lean 
metric depends on the organization and can be of the following 
categories: financial performance, behavioral performance, and 
core process performance.
Lean thinking: A focus on eliminating all waste within the processes, 
including customer relations, product design, supplier networks, 
production management, sales, and marketing. Its objective is to 
reduce human effort, inventory, cycle time, and space required to 
produce customer-deliverable outputs.
Levels of a factor: The various values of a factor considered in the experi­
ment are called levels.
Level (of a variable): The point at which an independent variable is set 
during a trial.
Line graph: The simplest graph to prepare and use is the line graph. It 
shows the relationship of one measurement to another over a 
period of time. Often this graph is continually created as mea­
surement occurs. This procedure may allow the line graph to 
serve as a basis for projecting future relationships of the variables 
being measured.
Loss function: The mean-square deviation of the object’s characteristics 
from their targeted value. It is used to determine the financial loss 
that will occur when the quality characteristic deviates from the 
target value.
Lost-opportunity poor-quality costs: Lost profits caused by poor inter­
nal performance. Example: Lost sales because the salesperson 
did not show up on time or did not do a good job of selling the 
service. The lost sales that occurred as a result of engineering or 

520  •  Appendix A: Glossary
manufacturing problems that resulted in the products or services 
not being available as initially scheduled.
Machine capability index (Cmk): A short-term machine capability 
index derived from observations from uninterrupted produc­
tion runs. The preferred Cmk value is greater than 1.67. The 
long-term machine capability index should be greater than 1.33.
Main effect: The average effect of a factor is called the main effect of the 
factor.
Management presentations: A special type of formal meeting of work 
groups and their managers.
Mann-Whitney U tests: A hypothesis test that is used as a nonparametric 
alternative to the two-sample t-test. It tests the equality of two 
population medians and calculates the corresponding point esti­
mates and confidence intervals.
Market segmentation: This occurs when the total market for an individual 
product or service is sub-divided into smaller groups based upon 
the individual characteristics of the group. This allows different 
market strategies to be applied to the segmented market areas.
Master Black Belt: Master Black Belts are experts in the Six Sigma meth­
odology. They are responsible for the strategic implementation 
of Six Sigma throughout the organization; training and mentor­
ing Black Belts and Green Belts; conducting complex Six Sigma 
improvement projects; developing, maintaining, and revising the 
Six Sigma materials; and applying statistical controls to difficult 
problems that are beyond the Black Belts’ knowledge base.
Matrix diagrams: A way to display data to make them easy to visualize 
and compare.
Mean: The average data point value within a data set. It is calculated by 
adding all of the individual data points together, then dividing 
that figure by the total number of data points.
Measure of dispersion: Dispersion within data is calculated by subtract­
ing the high value from the low value (range).
Measurement error: The error that is inherent in every measurement that 
is taken. No measurement is precise. Measurement error can be 
caused by many factors, including human error, equipment preci­
sion, and equipment calibration.
Measurement systems analysis: An evaluation of the goodness of an indi­
vidual. There are four characteristics that need to be examined:

Appendix A: Glossary  •  521
• Sensitivity—This should be no greater than one-tenth of the total tol­
erance in the specification being measured.
• Reproducibility—The ability of the measurement to repeatedly get 
the same answer.
• Accuracy—How near the true value (the international standard value).
• Precision—The ability to get the same value using the same operator 
and the same setup.
Measurement tools: Any object that is used to compare another object 
to a set of defined standards. It can be a ruler, a gauge, an oscil­
loscope, a scale, etc.
Median control charts: Median charts are used when an odd number of 
readings are made. This makes their median value more obvious. 
Another version records the data and plots the median value and 
range on two separate graphs.
Method of least squares: A statistical procedure to define the best fit’s 
straight line for a series of points plotted on a graph.
Midrange: The midpoint between the highest and the lowest value of a set 
of data. It is calculated by adding the highest value and the lowest 
value together and dividing by two.
Milestone graph: Shows the goals or target to be achieved by depicting the 
projected schedule of the process. A primary purpose is to help 
organize projects and coordinate activities.
Mind maps: An unstructured cause-and-effect diagram. Also called 
mind-flow or brain webs.
Mistake proofing: Methods that help operators avoid mistakes in their 
work caused by choosing the wrong part, leaving out a part, 
installing a part backward, etc. Also called mistake proofing, 
poka-yoke (error proofing), and baka-yoke (foolproofing).
Mixture design: In this type of experiment the measured responses are 
assumed to depend upon the relative proportions of the ingre­
dients or components in the mixture and not upon the amount 
of the mixture. This is an example when mixture and process 
examples are treated together. The fact that the portions of the 
different factors must be summed to 100% complicates the exper­
iment design as well as the analysis of the mixture experiment. 
There are a number of different mixture design methodologies. 
The most frequently used one is the simplex-lattice design.

522  •  Appendix A: Glossary
Mood’s median test: This tests the equality of medians from two or more 
populations. It is sometimes just called the median test.
MTBF: Mean time between failures. The average time between mechani­
cal breakdowns.
Muda: Any activity that consumes resources without creating value for the 
customer. This can consist of activities that cannot be eliminated 
immediately, or those that can be eliminated quickly through 
Kaizen.
Multiple linear regressions: An extension of the linear regression 
approach where only one independent variable is used. By increas­
ing the number of independent variables, a higher proportion of 
the variation can be analyzed.
Multivariance analysis: Often variation within the output is differ­
ent from piece-to-piece and time-to-time variation. Variation 
analysis uses a chart to investigate the stability or consistency 
of a process. The chart contains a series of vertical lines or other 
schematics, along a y timescale. The length of each line repre­
sents the range of values detected in each of the samples. A typi­
cal example might be a machined piece of steel that could be 
measured at a number of different points to determine the varia­
tion across a single surface.
Mura: Unevenness in an operation; for example, a gyrating schedule not 
caused by end-consumer demand but rather by the production 
system, or an uneven work pace in an operation causing operators 
to hurry and then wait. Unevenness often can be eliminated by 
managers through level scheduling and careful attention to the 
pace of work.
Muri: Overburdening equipment or operators by requiring them to run 
at a higher or harder pace with more force and effort for a longer 
period of time than equipment designs and appropriate workforce 
management allow.
MX bar–MR charts (moving range charts): Used in place of an X bar 
and R chart when the data are not readily available. These are two 
separate but related charts, one that plots averages and one that 
plots range. The same calculations that are used to calculate X bar 
and R charts are used for these charts also. Typically the last three 
parts are added together and averaged to plot the most recent plot.
Negative analysis: A method used to define potential problems before 
they occur and develop countermeasures.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  523
Nominal group technique (NGT): A special purpose technique, useful 
for situations where individual judgments must be tapped and 
combined to arrive at decisions.
Noncomparative experiments: An experiment whose objective is the 
determination of the properties or characteristics of a population.
No-value-added costs: The costs of doing activities that the customer would 
not want to pay for because it adds no direct value to him or her. It 
can be further divided into business-value-added, no-value-added, 
and bureaucracy costs. It also includes appraisal costs.
Normal distribution: Occurs when frequency distribution is symmetri­
cal about its mean or average.
Normal probability plots: Used to check whether observations follow a 
normal distribution. p > 0.05 = data are normal.
One-piece flow: A concept where a single piece of work moves between 
workstations instead of a batch process.
On-off technique: A way to direct attention to information on the screen 
or to the presenter during a presentation. In other words, turn off 
the projector when you want attention focused on you and not on 
the screen.
Operational process capability: Determined by the manner in which 
the process is operated in respect to how this predictable pattern 
meets specification requirements.
Opportunities: The way Six Sigma error rates are measured. It is anything 
within the product, process, service, or system that could cause an 
error that would make the output less than ideal in the customer’s 
eyes. Opportunities are the things that must be right to satisfy the 
customer. They are not the number of things that could possibly 
go wrong within the process. For example, in typing a five-letter 
word, there are five opportunities for making an error that the 
customer would be dissatisfied with.
Opportunity cycle: A problem-solving cycle that was developed in sup­
port of TQM. It consists of five phases: protection, analysis, cor­
rection, measurement, and prevention. During the protection 
phase, action is taken to protect the customer from receiving a 
defective product. During the analysis phase, data are collected 
to determine how to correct the problem. During the correction 
phase, the proposed solution is implemented. During the mea­
surement phase, the results of the corrective action are monitored 
to ensure it corrected the original problem. If it corrected the 

524  •  Appendix A: Glossary
problem, the preventive activity is removed from the process. The 
last phase is prevention, where the information learned during the 
cycle is applied to any other process, part, or system that could 
have the same type of problem.
Organizational cultural diagnostics (cultural landscape): One of the 
organizational change management tools. It is a survey that is 
conducted to define strengths and weakness related to the orga­
nization’s culture, based upon the individual’s perception of how 
the organization’s culture will impact the implementation of the 
proposed change. Changes that are in line with the organization’s 
culture are easy to implement. Changes that are in direct conflict 
with the organization’s culture are usually doomed to failure.
Organizational excellence: This methodology is made up of five key ele­
ments, called the five pillars, which must be managed simultane­
ously to continuously excel. The five pillars are:
• Process management
• Project management
• Change management
• Knowledge management
• Resource management
Organization change management: A methodology designed to lessen 
the stress and resistance of employees and management to indi­
vidual critical changes.
Origin: The point where the two axes on an X-Y graph meet. When num­
bers are used, their value is increased on both axes as they move 
away from the origin.
Other point of view (OPV): A method that aids in idea generation and 
evaluation by careful examination of the views of stakeholders 
involved. It is generally more effective when used early in the 
process, for idea generation as opposed to idea evaluation. It also 
tends to be more effective with small groups (two or three people) 
than with larger ones.
Outcome (response)-dependent variable: The result of a trial with a given 
treatment combination of X’s is called a response (Y).
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE): An effective tool to assess, 
control, and improve equipment availability, performance, and 
quality. This is especially important if there is a constraining piece 
of equipment.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  525
PPM: Parts per million. Typically in Six Sigma, it is used for defects per 
million opportunities. It is often referred to as DPMO.
Pareto diagrams: A type of chart in which the bars are arranged in 
descending order from the left to the right. It is a way to highlight 
the “vital few” in contrast to the “trivial many.”
Pattern and trend analysis: Typically, graphic charts are used to analyze 
changes, both positive and negative, in processes and outputs. Data 
are usually presented in either summary (static) or time sequence. 
Analyzing these graphs and/or charts results in detecting:
• Upward trends
• Downward trends
• Unusual variation
• Cycles
• Process shifts
• Increased variability
	
A typical application would be to plot a first-time yield by week. A 
prioritization matrix is a means to determine which factors have 
the biggest impact upon an individual item. The group first defines 
the criteria that will be used to evaluate the item and weights each 
criterion from 0 to 1. The sum of all the criteria can be no greater 
than 1. They then define the factors that will impact the item and 
prepare a table. The factors are listed along the vertical axis and the 
criteria along the horizontal axis. Each factor is then evaluated based 
upon the criteria on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the highest impact. 
This is multiplied times the weighting factor for specific criteria.
	
By summarizing the prioritization number for each factor, you 
will obtain a weighed prioritization for each factor. The higher the 
number, the more priority that factor should be given.
p-Charts: A type of attribute control chart that shows the percentage of 
defective units, used when the sample size varies.
Performance goals: Quantifies the results that will be obtained if the 
business objectives are satisfactorily met.
Performance improvement plan (PIP): A 3-year plan designed to align the 
environment within an organization with a series of vision state­
ments that drive different aspects of the organization’s behaviors.
Performance plan: A contract between management and the employees that 
defines the employees’ roles in accomplishing the tactics, and the 
budget limitations that the employees have placed upon them.

526  •  Appendix A: Glossary
Performance standard: Defines the acceptable error level of each indi­
vidual in the organization.
PERT charts: PERT stands for program evaluation review technique. This 
is a methodology that was developed by the U.S. government in the 
1950s. It is a project management tool used to schedule, organize, 
and coordinate tasks within the project. It provides an effective way 
of determining interdependencies between activities and timing. It 
allows for the critical path through the project to be readily defined.
Pictorial graphs: A way to represent data using pictures. Pictograms are 
a type of pictorial graph in which a symbol is used to represent a 
specific quantity of the item being plotted. The pictogram is con­
structed and used like bar and column graphs.
Plackett-Burman design (PBD): This design is best used in screening 
experiments. It uses a two-level design with a run number where 
the run number is a multiple of 4. For two-level nongeometric 
designs, the PBD run numbers would be 12, 20, 24, 28, etc. For 
example, if the run number was 12, you may be looking at 11 dif­
ferent factors. With run numbers of 20, you would be looking at 
19 different factors.
Plan-Do-Check-Act: A structured approach for the improvement of ser­
vices, products, and/or processes developed by Walter Shewhart.
Plus minus interesting: An idea evaluation weapon that analyzes the idea 
or concept by making a list of positive (+) and negative (–) things 
related to the idea or concept. It also uses a third column, called 
“Interesting,” where random thoughts about the item being evalu­
ated are recorded. A technique often used to evaluate a solution 
that may initially seem like a bad idea.
pn-Chart: A type attribute control chart that shows the number of defect 
units, used when the sample size is constant.
Point of use storage (POUS): Storing production parts and materials as 
close as possible to the operations that require them.
Poisson distribution: An approximation of the binomial when p is equal 
to or less than 0.1 and the sample size is fairly large (p = prob­
ability). It is used as distribution of defect counts and can be used 
as an approximation of the binomial. It is closely related to the 
exponential distribution. It is used to model rates, like errors per 
output, inventory turns, or arrivals per hour.
Policy deployment: An approach to planning in which organization-
wide long-range objectives are set, taking into account the 

Appendix A: Glossary  •  527
organization’s vision, its long-term plan, the needs of the custom­
ers, the competitive and economic situation, and previous results.
Poor-quality cost (PQC): This was an improvement on the quality cost 
system developed in the 1950s by Val Feigenbaum at General 
Electric. It extended the concept from direct quality cost to direct 
and indirect quality cost. It contains the following categories:
	
I.	Direct poor-quality cost
	
A.	 Controllable poor-quality cost
	
1.	 Preventive cost
	
2.	 Appraisal cost
	
3.	 No-value-added cost
	
B.	 Resultant poor-quality cost
	
1.	 Internal error cost
	
2.	 External error cost
	
C.	 Equipment poor-quality cost
	 II.	Indirect poor-quality cost
	
A.	 Customer-incurred cost
	
B.	 Customer dissatisfaction cost
	
C.	 Loss of reputation cost
	
D.	 Lost opportunity cost
	
It is a methodology that defines and collects costs related to 
resources that are wasted as a result of the organization’s inability 
to do everything correct every time. It includes both direct and 
indirect costs.
Portfolio project management: A technique used to manage all of 
the projects going on within a specific area. In the past when 
projects were managed independently, resources were not 
always assigned in the best manner. This technique optimizes 
the success of the critical projects that have priority within the 
organization.
Positive correlation: This occurs when both variables increase or decrease 
together. Negative correlation is when one variable increases while 
the other one decreases.
Prevention costs: All the costs expended to prevent errors from being 
made or, to say it another way, all the costs involved in helping the 
employee do the job right every time.

528  •  Appendix A: Glossary
Preventive action: Action taken that will eliminate the possibility of 
errors occurring rather than reacting from errors that occurred. It 
is a long-term, risk-weighted action that prevents problems from 
occurring based on a detailed understanding of the output and/
or the processes that are used to create it. It addresses inadequate 
conditions that may produce errors.
Primary functions: Those for which the process was designed.
Probability density function: Applied to a histogram. It is used to calcu­
late the probability that a single sample, drawn randomly from 
the population, will be less than a specific value. In some cases, it 
is used in just the opposite mode to determine the probability of 
the single sample being greater than a specified value. It defines 
the behavior of a random variable, and it is usually used as a shape 
of a distribution, frequently in a histogram format.
Probability plots: Typical plots where the values of the item being mea­
sured are divided into small segments across the horizontal axis, 
and the number of occurrences within that measurement segment 
are plotted on the vertical axis. A histogram is a typical example.
Problem tracking log: A systematic way to categorize, monitor, and mea­
sure progress of the corrective action process. It is designed to 
ensure that the correct amount of resources is applied to solving 
all important problems.
Process: A series of interrelated activities or tasks that take an input and 
provide an output.
Process benchmarking: A systematic way to identify superior processes 
and practices that are adopted or adapted to a process in order 
to reduce cost, decrease cycle time, cut inventory, and provide 
greater satisfaction to the internal and external customers.
Process capability index (Cp): A measure of the ability of a process to 
produce consistent results. It is the ratio between the allowable 
process spread (the width of the specified limits) and the actual 
process spread at the ±3 sigma level. For example, if the specifica­
tion was ±6 and the 1 sigma calculated level was 1, the formula 
would be 6 divided into 12 equals a Cp of 2.
Process capability study: A statistical comparison of a measurement pat­
tern or distribution to specification limits to determine if a pro­
cess can consistently deliver products within those limits.
Process control: A way the process is designed and executed to maximize 
the cost-effectiveness of the process. It includes process initiation, 

Appendix A: Glossary  •  529
selection of the process steps, selection of alternative steps, integra­
tion of the individual activities into the total process, and termination 
of the process. Too frequently, process control and process control 
charts are used interchangeably, and they should not be.
Process decision program charts (PDPC): A method that maps out the 
events and contingencies that may occur when moving from an 
identified problem to one or more possible solutions. It is used to 
look at various contingencies to steer the project in the required 
direction, to define countermeasures, or to get the project back 
on track. It basically uses a tree diagram and extends the charts 
a couple of levels by identifying risks and countermeasures from 
the bottom-level tasks in the tree matrix. It is one of the seven 
tools for management and planning.
Process elements: The sub-units that make up a process. They are nor­
mally referred to as activities, and the sub-units to the activities 
are tasks.
Process flow animation: A process model that shows the movement of 
transactions within the process and how outside functions impact 
the process’s performance.
Process improvement team: A group of employees assigned to improve 
a process. It is usually made up of employees from different 
departments.
Process maturity grid: A six-level grid that sets standards for a process as 
it matures in its overall performance. The six levels are:
Level 6: Unknown
Level 5: Understood
Level 4: Effective
Level 3: Efficient
Level 2: Error-free
Level 1: World class
	
Detailed requirements for each level are defined, broken down 
into eight different categories.
Process owner: The individual responsible for the process design and perfor­
mance. He or she is responsible for the overall performance from the 
start of the process to the satisfaction of the customer with the deliv­
ered output. It is the responsibility of the process owner to ensure that 
sub-optimization does not occur throughout the process, as well as 
setting improvement performance goals for the process.

530  •  Appendix A: Glossary
Process performance analysis: The collection of performance data (effi­
ciency and effectiveness data) at the activities or task level of a 
flowchart that is used to calculate the performance of the total 
process.
Process performance matrix: The efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptabil­
ity measurements related to the process. Particular focus is paid to 
the effectiveness measurements because they need to reflect cus­
tomer requirements.
Process qualification: A systematic approach to evaluating a process to 
determine if it is ready to ship its output to an internal or external 
customer.
Process redesign: A methodology used to streamline a current process 
with the objective of reducing cost and cycle time by 30 to 60% 
while improving output quality from 20 to 200%.
Process re-engineering: A radical methodology that challenges all the 
paradigms that the organization has imposed on the process. It is 
usually used when the present process is so obsolete or so bad that 
you don’t want to influence the new process in the design concept. 
Typically a process re-engineering project takes 6 to 9 months to 
complete and is used when cost and cycle time need to be reduced 
by more than 60%.
Process simplification: A methodology that takes complex tasks, activi­
ties, and processes and bisects them to define less complex ways of 
accomplishing the defined results.
Process simulation: A technique that pictorially processes resources, 
products, and services in a dynamic computer model.
Project champion: The individual who makes sure that the project has 
the resources and cross-functional support that are needed to be 
successful. The project champion is the individual that is most 
accountable to the executive team for the overall results of the 
project.
Project communications management: A subset of project management 
that includes the processes required to ensure timely and appro­
priate generation, collection, dissemination, storage, and ultimate 
disposition of project information.
Project cost management: A subset of project management that includes 
the processes required to ensure that the project is completed 
within the approved budget.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  531
Project decision analysis: The approach that is used in making a decision 
to start or continue a project. It includes a cost-benefits analysis, an 
impact analysis on the organization and its support to the strategic 
plan, an evaluation of the risks associated with the project, and its 
impact upon the customer. Each risk factor needs to be identified 
and evaluated. Project risk factors are evaluated by the sum of the 
probability occurrence times the consequences of the risk.
Project financial benefit analysis: An analysis that is conducted at least at 
each checkpoint in the process. It evaluates the potential savings 
compared to the cost of making the change. Early in the project 
both potential savings and cost are estimated. When the project 
has been implemented, actual project financial benefit analysis 
figures can be provided.
Project human resource management: A subset of project management 
that includes the processes required to make the most effective 
use of the people involved with the project.
Project integration management: A subset of project management that 
includes the processes required to ensure that the various ele­
ments of the project are properly coordinated.

• Project financial/cost management
• Project quality management
• Project resource management
• Project communication management
• Project risk management

factors are:
• Impact on a customer
• In line with the strategic objectives
• Financial returns
• Competitive advantage, etc.
Project time management: A subset of project management that 
includes the processes required to ensure timely completion of 
the project.
Pugh concept selection/Pugh matrix: A scoring matrix used to priori­
tize the selection of improvement opportunities. It is also used to 
select options in the design phase. The selection is based on the 
consolidated scores. It is typically done after the voice of the cus­
tomer has been captured.
Pugh technique: This technique compares the alternatives to the present 
process. First, a list of key process characteristics is generated by 
the PIT. Each alternative solution is then compared, characteristic 
by characteristic, to the present process. If the proposed solution 
will provide better results than the present process, it is given a 
plus (+); if it is the same, an s is recorded; if it has provided worse 
results, it is given a minus (–).
Pull system: A production control system that replaces parts and com­
ponents only when the previous part or component has been 

Appendix A: Glossary  •  533
consumed. It is designed to eliminate in-process storage and is 
part of a just-in-time system.
PUSIC: Plan, Understand, Streamline, Implement Continuous Improvement. 
This technique is the basic ingredient of business process improve­
ment. It is used with re-engineering, redesign, benchmarking, and 
fast-action solution teams.
Qualification: Acceptable performance of a complete process consisting 
of many operations that have already been individually certified. 
For a process to be qualified, each of the operations and all of the 
equipment used in the process must be certified. In addition, the 
process must have demonstrated that it can repeatedly produce 
high-quality products or services that meet specifications.
Qualitative data: Data related to counting the number of items and can­
not be broken down into smaller intervals. It is count rather 
than measurement data. For example: The number of machines 
shipped in a specific time period.
Quality at the source: Building quality into value-adding processes as 
they are completed. This is in contrast to trying to “inspect in 
quality,” which only catches mistakes after they have been made. 
An effective quality @ source campaign can minimize or elimi­
nate much of the expense associated with traditional quality con­
trol programs.
Quality function deployment: A structured process for taking the voice of 
the customer and translating it into measurable customer require­
ments and measurable counterpart characteristics, and deploying 
those requirements into every level of the product and manufactur­
ing process design and all customer service processes.
Quality management: All activities of the overall management function 
that determine the quality policy, objectives, and responsibilities 
and implement them by means such as quality planning, quality 
control, quality assurance, and quality improvement within the 
QMS (ISO 8402).

resources needed to implement quality management (ISO 8402).
R-charts: A simple range chart plotted in order to control variability of a 
variable.
Randomized block plans: This analysis approach is used when there are 
a large number of factors that need to be evaluated and it is desir­
able to keep all other conditions constant during each individ­
ual factor evaluation. With a randomized block plan, factors are 
grouped into categories where only one condition is varied and 
the other is held constant, thereby allowing the evaluation team to 
look at the variable within the block, ignoring the other variables 
that are occurring. This allows the major influencing factors to be 
defined for further evaluation.
Regression analysis: A statistical analysis assessing the association between 
two variables. It evaluates the relationship between the mean value 
of a random variable and the corresponding value of one or more 
independent variables.
Reliability analysis: A technique used to estimate the probability that 
an item will perform its intended purpose for a specific period of 
time under specific operating conditions.

the design and manufacturing processes so that there is a high 
probability of an item performing its function under stated condi­
tions for a specific period of time.

cost pool to products or other cost objects.
Response: The numerical result of a trial based on a given treatment 
combination.
Resultant poor-quality costs: The costs that result from errors. These 
costs are called resultant costs because they are directly related 
to management decisions made in the controllable poor-quality 
costs category. It is divided into two sub-categories: internal error 
costs and external error costs.
Reverse engineering: The process of purchasing, testing, and disassembling 
competitors’ products in order to understand the competitors’ design

terns or exceptional accomplishments. Categories of rewards and 
recognition are:
• Financial compensation
• Monetary awards
• Group/team rewards
• Public personal recognition
• Private personal recognition
• Peer rewards

measure of uncertainty. An uncertain event or condition that, if it 
occurred, might have a positive or negative effect on the organiza­
tion or the project.
Risk assessment: Performing a quantitative analysis of the risks and con­
ditions to prioritize their effects on the project objectives or the 
organization’s performance.
Robustness: The characteristics of a process output or process design that 
make it insensitive to the variation in inputs.
Robust process: A robust process operates at the Six Sigma level, produc­
ing very few defects even when the inputs to the process vary. They 
have a very high, short-term Z value and a small Z shift value. The 
critical element in a robust process is the u element.
Roll-through yield (RTY): See first-time yield.
Root cause analysis: The process of identifying the various causes affect­
ing a particular problem, process, or issue and determining the 
real reasons that caused the condition.
Run charts: A graphic display of data, used to assess the stability of a process 
over time, or over a sequence of events (such as the number of batches 
produced). The run chart is the simplest form of a control chart.
SCAMPER: A checklist and acronyms made up of the following:
S	 Substitute
C	 Combine

536  •  Appendix A: Glossary
A	 Adapt/adopt
M	Modify/magnify/minify
P	 Put to other uses
E	 Eliminate
R	 Reverse/rearrange
	
This technique is used to generate ideas when each of these ques­
tions is asked. It is a technique generated by Michael Michalko.
Scatter diagrams: A graphic tool used to study the relationship between 
two variables. Scatter diagrams are used to test for possible cause-
and-effect relationships. They do not prove that one variable 
causes the other, but they do show whether a relationship exists 
and reveal the character of that relationship.
Secondary functions: Those that support the primary functions or are of 
secondary importance.
Seven basic tools: Seven quality improvement tools that all employees 
should be familiar with and able to use. They were originally gen­
erated by Kaoru Ishikawa, a professor of engineering at Tokyo 
University and the father of quality circles. The seven tools are:
	
1.	Cause-and-effect diagrams
	
2.	Check sheets
	
3.	Control charts
	
4.	Histograms
	
5.	Pareto charts
	
6.	Scatter diagrams
	
7.	Stratification
Shewhart cycle (PDCA): The same as Plan-Do-Check-Act.
Short-run charts: Short-run charts are used when the universe is so small 
that it is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a large enough sample 
size for a standard control chart. The prerequisite for use of short-
run charts is that there is some commonality between the mea­
surements charted. In other words, the processes of the different 
runs are similar, but different enough that the normal control chart 
does not work well. When working with variable data, two differ­
ent plotting methods should be considered: deviation charts and 
standardized charts. The method used will depend on the varia­
tion between processes. Short-run charts were developed to address 

Appendix A: Glossary  •  537
the problems related to collecting several dozen measurements of a 
process before control limits can be calculated. It is often difficult to 
meet these requirements when the universe is very small.
Sigma: A Greek letter statisticians use to refer to the standard deviation of 
a population. Sigma and standard deviation are interchangeable. 
They are used as a scaling factor to convert upper and lower speci­
fied limits to Z.
Sigma conversion tables: A set of tables used to convert a sigma value into 
a percent of product that should meet requirements under normal 
conditions.
Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ratio): A calculation to quantify the effects of 
variation in controllable factors resulting from variation in out­
put. Single factors are defined as factors that strongly influence 
the mean response and usually have very little influence on varia­
tion of the output response, as they are controllable. Noise factors 
influence the variation in the output. They may or may not be 
controllable. When running an experiment, controllable condi­
tions are varied to get the most desirable signal-to-noise ratio.
Simple language: A way to evaluate the complexity of writing. It indicates 
the grade level that a person who is reading the document should 
have reached in order to understand the document. Simple lan­
guage produces documents that can be read at two grade levels 
lower than the lowest educational level of the person who will be 
using the documents.
Simple linear regression: A method that allows you to determine the rela­
tionship between a continuous process output (Y) and one factor 
(X). Its mathematical equation is Y = b + mX.
Simplification approaches: A series of techniques that focus on simplifying 
the way things are done. It could include things like the following:
• Combining similar activities
• Reducing amount of handling
• Eliminating unused data
• Clarifying forms
• Using simple English
• Eliminating no-value-added activities
• Evaluating present IT activities to determine if they are necessary
• Evaluating present activities to determine if IT approaches would 
simplify the total operations

Single-minute exchange of dies (SMED) or quick changeover: SMED is 
an approach to reduce output and quality losses due to change­
overs. Quick changeover is a technique to analyze and reduce 
resources needed for equipment setup, including exchange of tools 
and dies.
SIPOC: Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Output, and Customers. It is used to 
help you ensure that you remember all the factors when mapping 
a process.
Six Sigma: Six Sigma is a rigid, systematic methodology that utilizes 
information (managing by fact) and statistical analysis to mea­
sure and improve an organization’s performance by identifying 
and preventing errors. It can be thought of in three parts:
	
1.	Metric: 3.4 defects per million opportunities.
	
2.	Methodology: DMAIC/DFSS structured problem-solving tools.
	
3.	Philosophy: Reduce variation in the organization and drive deci­
sions based on knowledge of the customer.
Six Sigma matrix: Divided into four categories:
• Measuring customer opinion
• Determining customer critical to quality factors
• Measuring product outcome
• Correlating product outcomes to critical to quality factors (mea­
sure processes with a matrix that correlates to the organization’s 
economics)
Six Sigma program: A program designed to reduce error rates to a maxi­
mum of 3.44 errors per million units, developed by Motorola in 
the late 1980s.
Six-step error prevention cycle: A process to prevent problems from 
occurring rather than fix them afterwards.
Six-step problem-solving cycle: A basic procedure for understanding a 
problem, correcting the problem, and analyzing the results.
Six-step solution identification cycle: A procedure for defining how to 
solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  539
SMED: Single-minute exchange of dies. It is one of the Lean tools, and it 
is a key part of just-in-time programs. It is a methodology used to 
minimize the amount of time of changing a process over to pro­
duce another output.
Soft consensus: When some members would prefer a different solution 
but are willing to support the decision of the team.
Soft savings: Sometimes also referred to as intangible savings. It is the 
benefit you get from a change that is not directly reflected in the 
accounting system. It includes things like reduced cycle time, cost 
avoidance, improved employee morale, lost-profit avoidance, and 
higher levels of customer satisfaction.
Solution analysis diagrams: Designed to analyze all the possible effects of 
a proposed solution or cause.
Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho): Often denoted by the 
Greek letter ρ (rho), a nonparametric measure of correlation. 
This is a measure of the association that requires that both vari­
ables be measured in at least an ordinal scale so that the sam­
ple or individuals to be analyzed can be ranked in two orderly 
series.
Spider diagrams/radar charts: Used to show or compare one or more sets 
of data to each other. Often used to indicate the status quo (cur­
rent state) against the vision (future state).
Stakeholder analysis plan: A system to identify key stakeholders or indi­
viduals that have a stake in the overall success/failure of the process.
Standard deviation: An estimate of the spread (dispersion) of the total popu­
lation based upon a sample of the population. Sigma (σ) is the Greek 
letter used to designate the estimated standard deviation.
Standard work: Standard work is a systematic way to complete value-
added activities. Having standard work activities is a fundamen­
tal requirement of Lean Six Sigma organizations.
Statistical process control (SPC): Using data for controlling processes, 
making outputs of products or services predictable. A math­
ematical approach to understanding and managing activities. It 
includes three of the basic statistical quality tools: design of exper­
iments, control charts, and characterization.
Statistical thinking: Having a complete situational understanding of a 
wide range of data where several control factors may be interact­
ing at once to influence an outcome.
Statistics: Common sense put to numbers.

to define how something is done or what is going on related to a 
problem or situation.
Strategy: The approach that will be used to meet the performance goals.
Stratification: A technique used to analyze data where the universal pop­
ulation is divided into homogeneous sub-groups that are analyzed 
independently. For example, the market may be stratified into 
individual market segments.
Structural roadblocks: Obstacles that must be overcome for a process or 
an organization to transform from one state into another.
Student’s t-distribution: A combination of the standard normal random 
variables and the chi-square random variables analysis. It is cal­
culated by dividing the standard, normal random variable by the 
square root of the chi-squared random variable by the degrees of 
freedom.
Supplier controls: The preventive measures that are put into place to min­
imize the possibility of suppliers providing an unacceptable prod­
uct. They include things like supplier qualification, requirements 
placed on the supplier to be ISO 9000 certified, source inspection, 
receiving inspection, etc.
Supply chain management: The flow of items from raw materials to 
accepted products at the customer location. It is a methodology 
used to reduce cost, lead times, and inventory, while increasing 
customer satisfaction.
Surveys: A systematic way to collect information about a specific subject 
by interviewing people. Often, the interview takes the form of a 
series of questions that are presented to a target audience in either 
written or verbal form.
Sustaining sponsor: Individual/group who has the political, logistical, 
and economic proximity to the individuals.
SWOT analysis: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats 
analysis. It is used to help match the organization’s resources and 
capabilities to the competitive environment that exists in their 
market segment. It is often used as part of the strategic planning 
process.
System: The organizational structure, responsibilities, procedures, and 
resources needed to conduct a major function within an organi­
zation or to support a common business need.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  541
Systematic design: A very structured step-by-step approach to designing 
that was developed in Germany. It defines four main phases of the 
design process:
	
1.	Clarification of the tests: Collect information, formulate concepts, 
identify needs.
	
2.	Conceptual design: Identify essential problems and sub-factors.
	
3.	Embodiment: Develop concepts, layouts, and refinements.
	
4.	Detailed design: Finalize drawings, concepts, and generate 
documentation.
t-Test: The t-test employs the statistic t with n – 1 degrees of freedom to 
test a given statistical hypothesis about a population parameter. 
It is used when the population standard deviation is unknown 
and is effective in small sample sizes (less than 30 items).
Tactic: How the strategies will be implemented.
Taguchi methods: Design of experiment approaches by Dr. Taguchi for 
use where the output depends on many factors without having 
to collect data using all possible combinations of values for these 
variables. It provides a systematic way of selecting combinations of 
variables so that their individual effects can be evaluated.
Takt time: Takt time is the rate at which a completed item leaves the last 
step in the process. It should be equivalent to the rate at which cus­
tomers, internal or external, require the output. It drives the pull 
system, as it eliminates the need for in-process stock. The process 
should be designed so that each step in the process is operating at 
the same Takt time as the sales process. This is the ideal situation 
that keeps the process in continuous flow without buildup within 
the process or between processes.
Team: A team is a small group of people who work together that realize 
their interdependencies and understand that both personal and 
team goals are best accomplished with mutual support.
Team charter: It is preferable that the team charter is defined by the Six 
Sigma leadership team. It is the major contribution they can make 
by providing clear direction and expectations. The team charter 
does not map the route for the project but does provide the bound­
aries and destination. It includes project objectives, project pro­
cess boundaries, limitations, key deliverables, outside resources, 
and indicators/targets.

542  •  Appendix A: Glossary
Team management: The coordination and facilitation of the activities that 
go on within the team to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the team are optimized, and the desired results are accomplished 
on schedule within cost.
Theory of constraints (TOC): There is one point in every system that 
limits the flow through the process. The theory of constraints is 
used to identify these bottlenecks and eliminate them. This is a 
set of tools that examines the entire system to define continuous 
improvement opportunities. It consists of a number of tools. For 
example:
• Transition tree
• Prerequisite tree
• Current reality tree
• Conflict resolution diagram
• Future reality tree
Three-factor, three-level experiments: This provides a three-dimensional 
look at a process or problem. Often a three-factor experiment is 
required after screening a large number of variables. These experi­
ments may be full or fractional factorials. Usually the positive and 
negative levels in two-level designs are expressed as 0 and 1 in the 
design categories. Three-level designs often use 0, 1, and 2.
Throughput yield (TPY): The yield that comes out of the end of a process 
after any errors that are detected have been scrapped or reworked and 
re-entered into the process. Effective rework procedures can often 
increase first-time yield from 10% to a throughput yield of 100%.
Time-related process capability index (Cpk): This takes into account 
the drift that a product will have over time caused by common 
variation. Caused by things like different operators, different set­
ups, allowable differences in material, etc. For all customer impact 
measurements, a Cpk of at least 1.33 is the normal accepted stan­
dard unless the product is screened to protect the customer.
Tollgate: Process checkpoints where deliverables are reviewed and mea­
sured, and readiness to move forward is addressed. Usually if a 
total project has not completed all of its commitments that are 
due at a tollgate, the project does not progress to the next level 
until these commitments are met. Typically this is a management 
review to determine if the project should continue.

Appendix A: Glossary  •  543
Total cost management: A comprehensive management philosophy for 
proactively managing an organization’s total resources (material, 
capital, and human resources) and the activities that consume 
those resources.
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM): A methodology used to keep the 
equipment within the organization at peak operating efficiency, 
thereby eliminating equipment downtime.
Total productivity management: A methodology designed to direct the 
organization’s efforts at improving productivity without decreasing 
quality. It is designed to eliminate waste by involving employees, 
effective use of information technology, and automation.
Total Quality Management (TQM): A methodology designed to focus 
an organization’s efforts on improving the quality of internal 
and external products and services. ISO 8402 defines it as “a 
management approach of an organization, centered on qual­
ity, based on the participation of all its members and aiming at 
long-term success through customer satisfaction and benefits to 
the members of the organization and to society.” TQM is a con­
ceptual, philosophical, and structured group of methodologies 
that require management and human resource commitment 
to the embodiment of a philosophy where all of the manage­
ment, employees, processes, practices, and systems throughout 
the organization understand their customers, both internal and 
external, and provide them with organizational performance 
that fulfills or exceeds the customers’ expectations. It is part 
of the evolution from quality control to statistical quality con­
trol to total quality control, and it embodies all the criteria now 
included in all of the international, national, and local quality 
award systems.
Treatment combination: The set of levels of all factors included in a trial 
in an experiment is called a treatment or treatment combination.
Tree diagrams: A systematic approach that helps the user think about 
each phase or aspect of solving a problem, reaching a target, or 
achieving a goal.
Trial: An observation made with all of the variables set at predesigned 
levels and held constant during the duration of the observation.
Tribal knowledge: Any unwritten information that is not commonly 
known by others throughout the organization. It is part of a total 
organization’s knowledge assets and one that is frequently lost as 

544  •  Appendix A: Glossary
individuals change jobs or leave the organization. Unlike other 
forms of intellectual assets, tribal knowledge cannot be converted 
into company property unless it is transformed into a hard knowl­
edge base.
TRIZ: A methodology that was developed in Russia and stands for “theory 
of innovative problem solving” originated by Genrich Altshuller in 
1946. It is effective at identifying low-cost improvement solutions 
during the Define or Identify phase. It is also helpful in defining the 
root cause of defects. This approach expands on systems engineer­
ing methodologies and provides a powerful system management 
method for problem definition and failure analysis. It is an effective 
approach to generating innovative ideas and solutions to problems. 
TRIZ is a Russian acronym.
Types of data: There are basically two major groupings of data. They are:
• Attributes data: The kind of data that are counted, not measured. 
They are collected when all you need to know is yes or no, go or no 
go, accept or reject.
• Variables data: Variables data are used to provide a much more accu­
rate measurement than attributes data provide. It involves collecting 
numeric values that quantify a measurement, and therefore requires 
a smaller sample to make a decision.
Types of teams: There are many different types of teams that are identified 
by different properties related to the team organization and objec­
tives. Typical teams are:
• Department improvement teams, focusing on individual area 
improvement opportunities
• Quality circles, voluntary teams that form themselves
• Process improvement teams, typically working across functions, 
focusing on optimizing a total process typified by process re-engineer­
ing and process redesign
• Task forces, typified by an emergency that occurs within an organization
• Natural work teams, made up of individuals who are brought 
together to perform ongoing activities
u-Charts: Plot the number of defects per unit with a varying sample size.

Value-added analysis (VA): A procedure for analyzing every activity 
within a process, classifying its cost as value-added, business-
value-added, and no-value-added, and then taking positive 
action to eliminate the no-value-added cost and minimize the 
business-value-added.
Value stream: All of the steps/activities (both value-added, business-
value-added, and no-value-added) in a process that the customer 
is willing to pay for.
Value stream mapping: This tool is used to help you understand the flow 
of materials and information as an item makes its way through 
the value stream. A value stream map takes into account not only 
the item but also the management and information systems that 
support the basic item. This is helpful in working with cycle time 
reduction problems and is primarily used as part of the Lean 
toolkit.
Variable control charts: A plot of variables data of some parameter of a 
process’s performance, usually determined by regular sampling of 
the product, service, or process as a function (usually) of time or 
unit numbers or other chronological variable. This is a frequency 
distribution plotted continuously over time, which gives immedi­
ate feedback about the behavior of a process. A control chart will 
have the following elements:
• Center line (CL)
• Upper control limit (UCL)
• Lower control limit (LCL)
Variables data: The kind of data that are always measured in units, such 
as inches, feet, volts, amps, ohms, centimeters, etc. Measured data 
give you detailed knowledge of the system and allow for small, 
frequent samples to be taken. These are data that are equivalent to 
quantitative data. There are two types of variables data: discrete 
(count-type data) and continuous data.
Variation: A measure of the changes in the output from the process over a 
period of time. It is typically measured as the average spread of the 
data around the mean and is sometimes called noise.
Vision: A description of the desired future state of an organization, pro­
cess, team, or activity.

desired business environment 5 years in the future. A vision state­
ment should be between two and four sentences.
Visual controls: Visual controls are tools that tell employees “what to do 
next,” what actions are required. These often eliminate the need 
for complex standard operating procedures; promote continuous 
flow by eliminating conditions that would interrupt flow before it 
happens.
Visual factory/visual office: A system of signs, information displays, layouts, 
material storage, and equipment storage. It uses color coding and 
error proofing devices. The five S’s are part of visual controls and the 
visual office. Typical tools used in the visual office or control center 
would be a continuously updated electronic sign indicating the num­
ber of clients that are waiting for their phone call to be answered, or 
the length of time it takes to respond to a phone inquiry.
Vital few: The 20% of the independent variables that contribute to 80% of 
the total variation.
Voice of the business (VOB): The stated and unstated needs and require­
ments of the organization and its stakeholders.

requirements, in his or her own terms. It describes the stated and 
unstated needs and requirements of the external customer.
Voice of the employee (VOE): The term used to describe the stated and 
unstated needs and requirements of the employees within your 
organization.
Voice of the process (VOP): The term used to describe what the process is 
telling you about what it is capable of achieving.
Waste: Anything in your processes that your customer is unwilling to pay 
for; extra space, time, materials quality issues, etc.
Waste elimination: The ability to apply Lean Six Sigma concepts and tools 
to eliminate identified wastes.
Waste identification: The ability to “see” waste in your organization. This 
includes organizing waste into one of its nine defined categories.
Weibull distribution: A continuous probability distribution with the 
probability density function. It is frequently used in analyzing the 
field life data rate due to its flexibility. It can mimic the behav­
ior of other statistical distributions, such as the normal and the 
exponential. An understanding of the failure rates often provides 
insight into what is causing the failure.

Work breakdown structure (WBS): A Gantt chart used in project manage­
ment to monitor and plan the activities related to doing the project 
as well as defining their interrelationships and their present status.
Work flow monitoring: An online computer program that is used to track 
individual transactions as they move through the process to min­
imize process variation.
Work standards: When work standards are practiced, everyone in the 
organization is committed to performing the work in the same 
best way. Work standards include documentation methods and 
developing engineering standards to set the expectation and 
measurement matrix. They provide job aids and training to the 
employees that effectively communicate the best ways to perform 
an activity and set the minimum performance standard for the 
trained employee.
World-class operations benchmarking: A form of external benchmark­
ing that extends the benchmarking approach outside the organi­
zation’s direct competition to involve dissimilar industries.
X: In Six Sigma X’s are all the inputs that are required to produce the output 
Y. It includes the materials, procedures, process, and suppliers.
X bar: Simply the mean of a population.
X bar–S charts (X bar Sigma charts): These control charts are often used 
for increased sensitivity to variation.
X-MR charts: Individual readings are plotted on these charts, and a mov­
ing range may be used for short runs and in the case of destructive 
testing.
X-R control chart: An important statistical tool that can be used to sig­
nal problems very early and thus enable action to be taken before 
large volumes of defective output have occurred.
X-Y axes graph: A pictorial presentation of data on sets of horizontal and 
vertical lines called a grid. The data are plotted on the horizontal 
and vertical lines, which have been assigned specific numerical 
values corresponding to the data.
Y: In Six Sigma Y’s are the outputs from a process.
Yellow Belt (YB): A Yellow Belt typically has a basic understanding of Six 
Sigma, but does not have the experience, training, or capability to 
lead projects on his/her own. They work on special assignments to 
assist Green Belts and Black Belts in developing and implementing 
Six Sigma projects. As Yellow Belts gain experience, they become 
good candidates for Green Belt training.

Z: Data points positioned between the mean and another location as mea­
sured in standard deviations. Z is a measure of process capability 
and corresponds to the process sigma value.
Zero defects: This was a complete system directed at eliminating all 
defects from a product. It was originated by Phil Crosby on a mili­
tary contract and spread throughout the world. It sets a higher 
standard for performance than Six Sigma by 3.4 defects per mil­
lion opportunities. It focused on perfection, which is impossible 
to reach but should be our objective.
Zmin: The distance between the process mean and the nearest spec. limit 
(upper or lower) measured in standard deviation (sigma) units.

Appendix B: The Six Sigma 
Body of Knowledge
The following is a list of the Six Sigma body of knowledge. Under the col­
umns marked “Green,” “Black,” and “Master” LSS Belts, the following 
symbols are used:
• “A” means they are almost always used. At least 90% of the projects 
will use these tools. (The related belt must be trained on how to use 
these tools or already have been trained in the use of these tools.)
• “O” means often used. It is used in more than 50% of the projects. 
(The related belt should be trained on how to use these tools or 
already have been trained on these tools.)
• “S” means sometimes used. It is used in 25 to 49% of the projects. (The 
related belt should know what they are used for and know where to 
go to get more information on how to use them.)
• “I” means infrequently used to never used. It is used in less than 24% 
of the projects. (These tools are nice to know but not required and 
not part of the belt’s training or certification test.)

The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook
Although Lean and Six Sigma appear to be quite different, when used 
together they have shown to deliver unprecedented improvements to 
quality and proﬁtability. The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook: 
Tools and Methods for Process Acceleration explains how to 
integrate these seemingly dissimilar approaches to increase production 
speed and quality while decreasing cycle time, variations, and costs in 
your organization. 
Presenting problem-solving tools you can use to immediately determine 
the sources of the problems in your organization, the book is based on 
a recent survey that analyzed Six Sigma tools to determine which are 
the most beneﬁcial. Although it focuses on the most commonly used 
tools, it also includes coverage of those used a minimum of two times 
on every ﬁve Six Sigma projects.
Filled with diagrams of the tools you’ll need, the book supplies a com-
prehensive framework to help for organize and process the vast amount 
of information currently available about Lean, quality management, 
and continuous improvement process applications. It begins with an 
overview of Six Sigma, followed by little-known tips for using Lean Six 
Sigma (LSS) effectively. It examines the LSS quality system, its 
supporting organization, and the different roles involved. 
Identifying the theories required to support a contemporary Lean 
system, the book describes the new skills and technologies that you 
need to master to be certiﬁed at the Lean Six Sigma Black Belt (LSSBB) 
level. It also covers the advanced non-statistical and statistical tools 
that are new to the LSSBB body of knowledge.
Presenting time-tested insights of a distinguished group of authors, the 
book provides the understanding required to select the solutions that 
best ﬁt your organization's aim and culture. Designed to make the 
methodologies you choose easy to follow, the book will help Black Belts 
and Senseis better engage their employees, as well as provide an 
integrated and visual process management structure for reporting and 
sustaining continuous improvement breakthroughs and initiatives.
