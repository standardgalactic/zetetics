Abstract
Background: Plant secondary growth depends on the activity of the vascular
cambium, which produces xylem and phloem. Wood derived from xylem is the most
abundant form of biomass globally and has played key socio-economic and
subsistence roles throughout human history. However, despite intensive study of
vascular development, the full diversity of cell types and the gene networks engaged
are still poorly understood.
Results: Here, we have applied an optimized protoplast isolation protocol and RNA
sequencing to characterize the high-resolution single-cell transcriptional landscape of
highly lignified poplar stems. We identify 20 putative cell clusters with a series of
novel cluster-specific marker genes and find that these cells are highly
heterogeneous based on the transcriptome. Analysis of these marker genes’
expression dynamics enables reconstruction of the cell differentiation trajectories
involved in phloem and xylem development. We find that different cell clusters
exhibit distinct patterns of phytohormone responses and emphasize the use of our
data to predict potential gene redundancy and identify candidate genes related to
vascular development in trees.
Conclusions: These findings establish the transcriptional landscape of major cell
types of poplar stems at single-cell resolution and provide a valuable resource for
investigating basic principles of vascular cell specification and differentiation in trees.
Background
The evolution of vascular tissue played key roles in plants’ colonization and domination
of terrestrial environments by enabling long-distance transport of water and nutrients
and providing mechanical strength that supports their vertical growth [1, 2]. These tissues
mainly consist of xylem and phloem cells, usually respectively produced by inward and
outward division of cells in the vascular cambium, namely a process of secondary growth
[3]. A typical feature of this process is thickening of the cell wall in the specialized xylem
and phloem cell types, a continuous process of carbon accumulation and generation of
the most abundant form of biomass in the world: wood [4]. In recent decades, there has
been considerable progress in identifying key enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis

[5], and a hierarchical regulatory network involving several types of transcription factors
that regulate cell specification and differentiation during vascular development has been
proposed [6–8]. Those studies were mostly based on roots and inflorescence stems of the
model plant Arabidopsis [9] and stems of the model tree poplar [10]. However, unlike the
herbaceous annual Arabidopsis, perennial woody plants exhibit extreme secondary
growth, characterized by formation of secondary cell walls (SCW) and additional dynamic
seasonal changes influenced by various environmental stresses [11, 12]. Thus, partly due
to reliance on information and markers from Arabidopsis, the molecular-level regulation
of vascular tissue development in trees, especially the SCW regulatory network involved,
has not been fully elucidated [10, 13].
Quantifying and comparing gene expression in specific cell types is essential for under-
standing the complex regulatory networks that control vascular development. By combin-
ing use of cell-type-specific reporter lines with cell sorting, laser capture microdissection,
microarray analysis, and RNA sequencing, extensive studies have characterized the gene
expression patterns of certain types of vascular cells in poplars, such as fusiform and ray
cambial cells, fiber, and vessel cells [14–17]. Despite these studies, the full diversity of cell
types and cell differentiation trajectories in the vascular tissues of woody plants have not
yet been comprehensively analyzed, and their degree of heterogeneity is still unclear.
However, advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide unprecedented
opportunities for high-resolution characterization of gene expression [18–21]. The tech-
nique has been recently used to identify cell types in roots (Arabidopsis and rice), shoot
apices (Arabidopsis, tomato and maize), leaves (Arabidopsis and peanut), and both ears
and anthers of maize [22–36]. These studies have consistently revealed a wide range of
cell heterogeneity and allowed the identification of rare and novel cell types, the
characterization of multiple different cell types and states, and the establishment of de-
tailed developmental trajectories during tissue development [20, 21]. However, the tech-
nique has not been applied in vascular tissue, especially tissues of woody plants, until its
recent application in the differentiating xylem of Populus alba × Populus glandulosa [37].
This may be due to the presence of SCW with high and varying thickness, which greatly
complicates isolation of individual cells without loss of their viability and purity.
In an attempt to circumvent these problems, here we applied an optimized protocol to
isolate high-quality protoplasts, combined with 10x Genomic scRNA-seq technology to
construct a single-cell transcriptional landscape of the poplar stem. In total, we identified
20 cell clusters covering nearly all major cell types in vascular tissue. As expected, we
found a high degree of heterogeneity among these cells. In combination with in situ
hybridization experiments, hundreds of cell-type-specific marker genes were identified.
The differentiation trajectories of phloem and xylem cells were further reconstructed ac-
cording to their transcriptome profiles. We also established a web server (https://scu-
populus.shinyapps.io/scRNAPal/) to facilitate the use of our scRNA-seq data, which will
provide a valuable resource for future functional studies of vascular development in trees.
Results
Construction of a single-cell transcriptional landscape of the poplar stem
To enable scRNA-seq of poplar stem cells, we harvested stems of three 4-month-old
Populus alba var. pyramidalis plantlets. We then separated bark and wood tissues of

parts below the third node (Fig. 1A) and obtained free protoplasts from them using a
previously described digestion method [38]. The cross section of the stem showed that
most of the cell types in the vascular tissue have been digested and released (Additional
file 1: Fig. S1). As the isolated protoplasts were fragile and the suspension was rich in
cell debris, we used an optimized method for washing and cell resuspension to
maximize their purity and maintain their viability, before loading into a 10x Genomics
Chromium Controller. Then, scRNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced
using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. After prefiltering at both cell and gene levels, we
successfully captured 3626 and 3170 cells, with median numbers of 2512 and 3330
expressed genes per cell for bark and wood tissues, respectively (Additional file 2: Table
S1). In total, we detected transcripts of 27,297 and 26,653 genes in our scRNA-seq of
bark and wood, respectively, covering 92.8% and 83.1% of the genes detected by bulk
RNA-seq. In addition, gene expression values obtained from the combined scRNA-seq
analysis showed strong correlations with the bulk RNA-seq profiles (Pearson’s r: 0.81
and 0.82 for bark and wood respectively, Additional file 1: Fig. S2), confirming the ro-
bustness and high quality of our scRNA-seq data. To construct a comprehensive tran-
scriptional landscape for poplar stem, we combined these two datasets (including 6796
high-quality cells in total) for subsequent analysis.
Using the 2000 genes that showed the highest variation in expression, we scaled
and reduced the combined dataset into 30 principal components (PCs) with linear
dimensional reduction. The transcriptome profiles of cells were then projected in
an unsupervised manner without a priori knowledge of marker genes. In total,
these cells were classified into 20 clusters and visualized using t-distributed sto-
chastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) tool and uniform manifold approxima-
tion and projection (UMAP) algorithm (Fig. 1B, Additional file 1: Fig. S3-5).
Among the detected genes, 6170 specifically expressed in one or two clusters
were identified as cluster-enriched (Additional file 3: Table S2, Additional file 1:
Fig. S6).
Identification of cell types with marker genes
Since very few marker genes were known for cell types of tree stems, we first com-
piled a list of known or predicted wood formation marker genes whose functions
and expression patterns have been well studied in poplar and Arabidopsis (Add-
itional file 4: Table S3, Additional file 5: Table S4), and then compared them with
our identified cluster-enriched genes to annotate the clusters. Analysis of correla-
tions between profiles derived from the scRNA-seq dataset and published high-
spatial-resolution expression profiles for secondary growth of P. tremula [15] fur-
ther validated the cell type of each cluster (Additional file 1: Fig. S7). Specifically,
we found that several master regulatory genes related to xylem development in-
cluding SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (SND1),
NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 1 (NST1), and
MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 46 and 83 [6] were highly enriched in clusters 4, 8, and
9 (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1: Fig. S8), and thus were identified as xylem cell popu-
lations. Moreover, many genes involved in SCW biosynthesis were predominantly
expressed in cluster 4 (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1: Fig. S8), implying that cells in this

cluster may undergo SCW thickening. These genes included the following: the xy-
lan biosynthesis and deposition genes IRREGULAR XYLEM 9 (IRX9), IRX14-L, and
IRX15-L [39, 40]; SCW cellulose and hemicellulose synthase genes COBRA-LIKE4
(COBL4), CesA4, CesA7, and CesA8 [41]; genes encoding laccases (LAC4 and
LAC17) localized to the thick SCW of xylem vessel elements and fibers [42]; and
KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 7 (KNAT7), which
negatively regulates SCW biosynthesis [43]. Furthermore, VASCULAR RELATED
NAC-DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (VND1), a transcriptional regulator of SCW biosyn-
thesis in xylem vessels [44], was also overrepresented in some cells of cluster 4,
implying that vessel cells were contained in this cell cluster (Additional file 1: Fig.
S8). In addition, CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 7 (CAD7), whose ex-
pression was previously detected in xylem parenchyma cells to provide lignin pre-
cursors to the adjacent vessels and fibers [37, 45], was highly enriched in clusters

8 and 9, which were further identified as xylem parenchyma cells (Additional file
1: Fig. S8).
For phloem cells, we used ALTERED PHLOEM DEVELOPMENT (APL), a master
regulator gene that promotes asymmetric cell division of phloem initials into sieve ele-
ments (SEs) and companion cells (CCs) [46], and gene members of the PHLOEM PRO-
TEIN 2 family (PP2-A1, PP2-A4, and PP2-A10) that is specifically expressed in SE-CC
complex [47] as markers (Additional file 6: Table S5). We found that these marker
genes were highly enriched in cells of clusters 13 and 19, suggesting that they are likely
phloem cells (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1: Fig. S9). In addition, we also found that SU-
CROSE-PROTON SYMPORTER 2 (SUC2), which is essential for sucrose uptake from
apoplast to CCs [48], was highly expressed in cluster 13, while several homologous
genes of SIEVE-ELEMENT-OCCLUSION-RELATED 1 (SEOR1), which is necessary for
the formation of phloem filament in Arabidopsis SEs [49], were particularly enriched in
cluster 19 (Additional file 1: Fig. S9). Accordingly, the cells in clusters 13 and 19 were
identified as CCs and SEs respectively. Recent studies have shown that several members
of the UMAMIT amino acid transporter family are specifically expressed in phloem
parenchyma (PP) cells of Arabidopsis leaves [27]. We found that several members of
this gene family (UMAMIT9, UMAMIT12, UMAMIT20, UMAMIT21, and UMA-
MIT22) were highly enriched in clusters 3 and 18 (Additional file 1: Fig. S9). Thus, cells
in these two clusters were identified as PP cells. Interestingly, we found that a homolog
of SWEET17, which is specifically expressed in vascular parenchyma cells and acts as
fructose transporters in the vasculature of Arabidopsis leaves [50], was also highly
expressed in cells of cluster 3 (Additional file 1: Fig. S9), suggesting that it may play a
role in controlling the transport of fructose in the phloem of poplar.
In order to identify other bark cell populations, the regulatory module composed of
SCARECROW (SCR) and SCARECROW-LIKE 23 (SCL23) (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1:
Fig. S10), which is required for controlling asymmetric cell division of the cortex/endo-
dermis initial (CEI) and plays an important role in the endodermis development of Ara-
bidopsis shoots and roots [51], was used as markers for the CEI cells (cluster 17). We
also selected NPF3.1 (NRT1/PTR FAMILY 3.1), which is specifically expressed in the
endodermis [52, 53], and CYCLIND 6;1 (CYCD6;1) that is involved in cortex/endoder-
mis asymmetric stem cell division [54], as markers for endodermal cells (cluster 7) and
cortex/endodermal cells (cluster 16) respectively (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1: Fig. S10).
As an important component of bark, cork is characterized by the presence of both lig-
nin and suberin (a large aliphatic biopolymer composed of long-chain fatty acids and
fatty alcohols of various lengths) in the cell wall [55]. We found that the suberin bio-
synthetic gene, ASFT (ALIPHATIC SUBERIN FERULOYL TRANSFERASE) [56, 57],
and several genes involved in biosynthesis of lignin and very long-chain fatty acids, in-
cluding

(KCS11), LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHASE 1 (LACS1), and LACS2 [58, 59], were
specifically expressed in cluster 11 (Additional file 1: Fig. S10). Finally, the homeobox
gene GLABRA2 (GL2), required for epidermal cell differentiation in Arabidopsis roots
[60], was highly expressed in cells of cluster 12 (Additional file 1: Fig. S10), which were
therefore identified as epidermal cells.
As markers for the cambium and adjacent cell populations, we used multiple genes
including the key cambial regulators WOX4 (WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 4)

and PXY (PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM), the auxin response transcription
factor MP (MONOPTEROS), and genes encoding the auxin efflux transporter PIN1
(PINFORMED 1), cytokinin-responsive transcription factor gene ANT (AINTEGU-
MENTA), and positive regulatory peptide of cambial activity Populus CLV3/ESR-RE-
LATED 47 (PttCLE47) [61, 62]. The results support the cambium and adjacent region
identities of cell clusters 1, 2, 5, 6, and 10 (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1: Fig. S11). In more
detail, the three HD-ZIP III transcription factor genes, homologs of which (PtrHB4 and
PtrHB7) play critical roles in regulation of vascular cambium activity and xylem differ-
entiation in poplars [63, 64], were highly expressed in cluster 5 (Additional file 1: Fig.
S11). In contrast, OCTOPUS (OPS), a gene encoding a polarly localized plasma
membrane-associated protein that plays a crucial role in protophloem formation [65],
and SMXL5 (SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE5), which is key promoter of phloem dif-
ferentiation [66], were particularly enriched in cluster 6 (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1: Fig.
S11). Accordingly, we designated the cells in clusters 5 and 6 as xylem and phloem
mother cells, respectively. Due to the lack of proven marker genes, we could not deter-
mine the cell types in clusters 14 and 15. However, transcriptome profiles of the cells
in both clusters were highly correlated with published expression profiles of phloem
and expanding-xylem tissues [15] (Additional file 1: Fig. S7), indicating that they are
probably spatially distributed near the cambium. Further examination of the enriched
genes revealed that genes associated with mitosis and cell cycling were strongly
expressed in clusters 14 and 15, such as CSLD5 (CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE D5)
[67], PLE (PLEIADE) [68], HIK (HINKEL) [69], mitotic cyclin (CYCA1;1, CYCA2;1,
CYCA2;4,
CYCB1;4,
CYCB2;1,
CYCB2;3,
CYCB2;4,
CYCB3;1)
[70],
and
cyclin-
dependent kinase (CDKB1;2, CDKB2;1) [71] (Fig. 1C, Additional file 1: Fig. S12), indi-
cating that this cluster is rich in dividing cells. Overall, these results confirmed the high
degree of cell heterogeneity in poplar stems.
Differentiation trajectory of phloem cells
As the major functional domains of stems, phloem and xylem are produced through
periclinal cell divisions of vascular cambium toward the outside and inside, respectively.
Since the cells in intermediate and terminal developmental states were captured simul-
taneously by scRNA-seq, we applied Monocle2 (v2.10.0) [72] to explore the continuous
differentiation trajectories of the phloem and xylem development through pseudo-time
analysis (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). To construct developmental trajectory of phloem cells, phloem
mother cells (cluster 6), companion cells (cluster 13), and sieve elements (cluster 19)
were selected. A subset of cells from cluster 6 (phloem mother cells) assembled at the
beginning of pseudo-time and gradually bifurcated into two ends representing two dis-
tinct cell clusters (Fig. 2A). We found that SMXL5 and OPS were prominently
expressed at the branching point and neighboring cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S13), in
agreement with their key roles in phloem formation and differentiation [65, 66]. Inter-
estingly, the auxin influx and efflux transporters AUX1 (AUXIN RESISTANT 1) and
PIN1, which are polarly localized at opposite ends of protophloem cells of Arabidopsis
root tips [73], were also extremely highly expressed around the branching point (Fig.
2B). This result clearly suggests that they may play an important role in establishment
of the auxin gradient required for regulation of cambial activity and radial growth.

In accordance with above speculation, cells from clusters 13 and 19 were located
along the two branches of pseudo-time respectively, reflecting transcriptional rewiring
during phloem development (Fig. 2A). More specifically, the sucrose carrier SUC2 [48]
and an essential regulator of florigen transport from phloem CCs to SEs, FTIP1 (FT-
INTERACTING PROTEIN 1) [74], were highly expressed in branch 1 (Fig. 2B, Add-
itional file 1: Fig. S13), supporting the assignment of these cells as phloem CCs. In
agreement with CCs’ function in providing metabolic support for SEs and promoting
the loading and unloading of nutrients, genes related to “amino acid transport” were
significantly enriched in this branch (Fig. 2D,E, Additional file 7: Table S6). We also
found that several key strigolactone-responsive genes, including SMXL6, SMXL7, and
DWARF14 (D14) [75, 76], were prominently expressed in CCs (Additional file 1: Fig.
S13), implying that this phytohormone and/or related signaling pathways may also be
involved in differentiation of phloem cells. In contrast, the SEs marker gene SEOR1 that
is required for the formation of phloem filaments [49], and the phloem-specific callose
synthase CalS7 that is responsible for callose deposition in developing SEs [77], were
enriched in branch 2 (Fig. 2B, Additional file 1: Fig. S13). The transcriptomic signature
of branch 2 was initially enriched in “cytoplasmic translation,” “rough endoplasmic
reticulum,” and “cytoplasmic translational elongation,” and eventually enriched in
“phloem development” and “plant-type cell wall” (Fig. 2E, Additional file 7: Table S6).
These observations are consistent with SEs’ differentiation process, which reportedly

involves loss of ribosomes from cytoplasm, modification of endoplasmic reticulum, and
cell wall thickening [78]. Interestingly, we noted that several genes homologous to
ENODL9 (EARLY NODULIN-LIKE PROTEIN 9), which encodes an extracellular ATP-
binding protein attaching to the SE plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
anchor in Arabidopsis [79, 80], were also highly expressed in branch 2 (Additional file
1: Fig. S13), suggesting that they may play a role in SEs.
In addition, we found that many genes involved in phloem development, including
the marker gene APL required for specific division of phloem cells [46], and CHER1
(CHOLINE TRANSPORTER-LIKE 1) required for sieve plate and sieve pore develop-
ment [81], were highly expressed in both branches (Fig. 2B, Additional file 1: Fig. S13).
The APL expression was further validated by in situ hybridization assays (Fig. 2C), sup-
porting the ordered developmental process of phloem cells. Interestingly, we found that
different gene members of PP2 gene family showed clear branch specificity in their ex-
pression patterns: PP2-A1 and PP2-A10 were preferentially expressed in branch 1, while
PP2-A4 was more preferentially expressed in branch 2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Further
molecular experiments are needed to verify their roles in the differentiation of SEs and
CCs, but collectively, these results provide insights into the differentiation trajectory of
phloem cells and transcriptome profiles during cell state transitions.
Differentiation trajectory of xylem cells
Construction of the developmental trajectory of xylem, using clusters 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9, re-
sulted in a bifurcate pseudo-time backbone representing two distinct final states (Fig. 3A),
with the clusters arranged at different branch sites. As expected, most cells from clusters 2
and 5 (cambium and xylem mother cells respectively) assembled at the beginning of
pseudo-time, while xylem parenchyma cells (clusters 8 and 9) and xylem cells with SCW
(cluster 4) grouped into different branches, namely XP and XSCW respectively. We found
that multiple HD-ZIP III transcription factor genes (such as PtrHB4, PtrHB7, and PtrHB8,
all of which play crucial roles in regulation of vascular cambium activity and xylem develop-
ment in poplars [63, 64, 82]) were prominently expressed at the beginning of pseudo-time
(Fig. 3B, Additional file 1: Fig. S14). Similarly, four homologs of the thermospermine syn-
thase ACAULIS5 (ACL5), which forms a negative feedback loop with HB8 that is required
for proper vascular development and xylem cell specification [82], were prominently
expressed around the branching point (Fig. 3B). We further investigated the differences in
gene expression patterns between XP and XSCW branches (Fig. 3C). The results showed
that the transcripts preferentially expressed in XP branch were initially enriched in func-
tional categories related to “cytoplasmic translation” and eventually enriched in “response to
various biotic and abiotic stresses” (Fig. 3D, Additional file 8: Table S7). Specifically, several
genes encoding plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) aquaporins, including PIP1;4,
PIP2B, and PIP3 were highly expressed in XP cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, we also found that
multiple transcription factors associated with abiotic stress response, such as WRKY40,
WRKY48, and ABR1 (AP2-like ABA repressor 1), were highly enriched in XP cells. The ex-
pression of ABR1 in the parenchyma cells was further validated by in situ hybridization
assay (Fig. 3E). These characteristics are consistent with functions of the XP cells in carbo-
hydrate and fat storage, water conduction, defense against pathogens, and healing and re-
generation under stress conditions [83, 84].

In contrast, the XSCW branch is mainly composed of cells from cluster 4. In these
cells, genes associated with “plant SCW biogenesis,” “xylan and cellulose biosynthetic
process,” and “cell wall organization” were preferentially expressed (Fig. 3D), indicating
that they were undergoing SCW thickening and lignification. In detail, multiple tran-
scription factors in the core regulatory network of SCW formation, such as SND1,
SND2, KNAT7, MYB83, 46, and 103 [6], and genes encoding enzymes involved in SCW
biosynthesis, such as SCW-associated cellulose synthase genes (CesA4, CesA7, and
CesA8) [41], xylan biosynthesis genes (IRX8, IRX9, IRX10, IRX14, IRX15, and IRX15-L)

prominently expressed in these cells (Fig. 3C, Additional file 1: Fig. S15). These genes’
expression patterns were strongly positively correlated, and binding motifs of MYB and
NAC transcription factors are highly enriched in the 2-kb sequences upstream of them
(Additional file 1: Fig. S16). These observations corroborate the hypothesis that mem-
bers of the NAC and MYB gene families are master transcriptional regulators of SCW
biosynthesis. Moreover, our results revealed high correlations in expression of homo-
logs of ESK1 (ESKIMO1), which plays an essential role in xylan acetylation during
SCW biosynthesis in Arabidopsis [85], with these SCW-associated genes (Additional
file 1: Fig. S17). The expression of ESK1 in cells with SCW was also validated by in situ
hybridization assays (Fig. 3F). Further analysis showed that multiple genes previously

(PdDUF579-9), ASPARTIC PROTEASE 66 (PtAP66), and PtAP17 [86–88], were particu-
larly expressed in cells from XSCW branch (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, we found that a
gene orthologous to PtrMAN6 (ENDO-BETA-MANNASE 6), which is specifically
expressed in poplar vessel cells [89], as well as XCP1 (XYLEM CYSTEINE PROTEASES
1) and XCP2, both of which are reportedly vessel-specifically expressed in Arabidopsis
[90], were also highly enriched in some cells associated with XSCW branch (Fig. 3G,
Additional file 1: Fig. S15). These results imply that the XSCW branch is composed of
at least two cell types, vessels and fibers. Taken together, our results clearly reveal a
high degree of heterogeneity and complexity in the differentiation and fate determin-
ation of poplar xylem cells. They also confirm the robustness of our dataset and its po-
tential utility for mining to detect new regulatory genes.
Hormonal biosynthesis and response patterns in poplar stem cells
Plant hormones play key, highly interactive roles in vascular tissue development and cam-
bium maintenance [2, 61]. By plotting the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the genes
related to hormone biosynthesis and response pathways, we next analyzed the cell-
specific patterns of phytohormone regulation in poplar stem. We found that biosynthesis
genes of most hormones, including gibberellin acid (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), and strigo-
lactone (SL), were mainly overrepresented in cortex and endodermal cells, while auxin,
cytokinin, and brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis genes were also enriched in xylem cells,
especially parenchyma cells (Additional file 1: Fig. S18). Specifically, all of them were not
expressed in cells with SCW. Like SL biosynthesis genes, SL response genes were overrep-
resented in the cortex and endodermal clusters, indicating that these cells have an auto-
crine function (Fig. 4). However, the other hormone response genes, especially genes
responsive to auxin, cytokinin and GA, were overrepresented in cambium and adjacent
cells, such as cells from clusters 1 and 10. In addition, auxin-, cytokinin-, and ABA-
responsive genes were also clearly overrepresented in xylem parenchyma cells (clusters 8
and 9) (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results revealed complex patterns and interactions of
various hormones during poplar vascular development and enabled investigation of po-
tential hormonal signaling at single-cell resolution.
scRNA-seq predicts potential gene redundancy in poplar vascular development
A recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) resulted in two copies of each gene in the
poplar genome [91, 92]. These paralogous genes usually exhibit functional redundancy,
Chen et al. Genome Biology          (2021) 22:319 
Page 10 of 22

and knocking out one of them will not result in a clear phenotypic change, which limits
functional study of these genes. To predict functional redundancy in poplar vascular de-
velopment, we first identified a total of 9147 paralogous gene pairs derived from WGD in
the P. alba var. pyramidalis genome. Among these, both copies of 5143 gene pairs were
detected to be expressed in at least 1% of the cells captured by our scRNA-seq. In-depth
analysis showed that expression patterns of these WGD-derived paralogs were signifi-
cantly more strongly correlated (higher Jaccard co-expression index values) than the gen-
omic background (P value < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and the correlation
declined with increasing protein sequence differentiation (Fig. 5A,B), indicating that the
functional redundancy between these paralogs is modulated by protein sequence evolu-
tion and expression pattern differentiation. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that
the paralogs falling within the top 10% of the Jaccard index distribution were associated
with basic cellular component and maintenance, such as “small/large ribosomal subunit,”
“cytosolic ribosome,” “proteasome complex,” and “translation initiation” (Fig. 5C, Add-
itional file 9: Table S8, Additional file 10: Table S9), which is consistent with the observa-
tion that the duplicated genes related to basic cellular machinery in Arabidopsis have a
slower divergence rate at both sequence and expression levels [93].
In order to further investigate functional redundancy of the paralogs across cell clusters,
we defined that if both copies of a gene pair were expressed in more than 25% of the cells
in a certain cluster, they were considered to be overlapping in that cluster. Approximately
56.8% (2921) of the paralogs did not show any overlapping clusters, which is consistent

genes in individual cells

with their low expression correlation (Fig. 5D). However, we found that many paralogs
with overlapping clusters were also detected as cluster-enriched genes, especially in clus-
ters 4, 9, 14, and 15 (Additional file 1: Fig. S19), indicating that functional redundancy

may be more frequent in these cell types. Consistent with the basic cellular functions of
the paralogs in the top 10% of the Jaccard index, most of them exhibited overlapping ex-
pression patterns in almost all cell clusters (Fig. 5D). Despite this, we identified 40 gene
pairs with the highest expression similarity but showing only one or two overlapping clus-
ters, strongly suggesting that their functions are redundant in these cell types (Additional
file 9: Table S8). Interestingly, we noted that most of these paralogs were specifically
expressed in xylem cells with SCW (cluster 4), including IQD10, MYB46, SND2, CesA7,
and CesA8. Previous studies have shown that both CesA7 (PtrCesA7A and 7B) and CesA8
(PtrCes8A and 8B) gene pairs in the P. trichocarpa genome are functionally redundant, so
the ptrcesa7a/b or ptrcesa8a/b double mutants, but not single mutants, have lower cellu-
lose contents than wild-type counterparts and abnormal morphology [94, 95]. In the P.
alba var. pyramidalis genome, we detected three copies of both CesA7 and CesA8 (Fig.
5E). In addition to the paralogs derived from the WGD, there is another copy of both of
these genes due to independent gene duplication events in this species. Our data revealed
strong co-expression of the three copies of CesA7 and three copies of CesA8 (Fig. 5F,G),
supporting that functional redundancy in poplar vascular development could be predicted
by co-expression networks in scRNA-seq. Overall, these results highlight the utility of
poplar stem scRNA-seq data for predicting gene redundancy.
Discussion
scRNA-seq is a revolutionary technology with far greater power to identify new cell
types and reveal cellular heterogeneity at high resolution than bulk RNA-seq [18, 19].
Recently, it has been widely used to elucidate cell differentiation and development pro-
cesses of herbs or crops, including Arabidopsis, rice, maize, and tomato, particularly in
young and/or easily dissociated tissues, such as root tips, shoot apices, and leaves [23,
26, 27]. However, similar studies on tree species or highly lignified plant tissues are still
challenging, due to the presence of thick SCW that is difficult to digest to release single
cells. However, the optimized protocol applied in this study enabled protoplast isolation
and subsequent generation of a comprehensive single-cell transcriptional landscape of
the poplar stem. We identified numerous cell clusters and state changes associated with
vascular development, including xylem, phloem, cambium, epidermis, and endodermis
cells (Fig. 1B). These results confirmed that our method is sensitive enough to detect
most poplar genes and suggest that our optimized or further improved protocol can be
potentially applied to more tree species or lignified plant tissues.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that processes involved in cell fate determination
and pattern formation in poplar stems are still poorly understood, and some cell types
were defined by marker genes that are either homologs of Arabidopsis genes or genes
associated with related biological processes. Moreover, the cells in poplar vascular tis-
sue are surrounded by cell walls with large variations in thickness and components,
making it difficult to both obtain sufficient single cells and avoid changes in gene ex-
pression during protoplast isolation. For example, we have not detected a cell type or
state in which genes related to programmed cell death are strongly expressed. This may
be due to the thickened SCW of these cells hindering efficient isolation of protoplasts
from them. Similarly, we found that only a few cork cells (cluster 11) were captured by
our scRNA-seq (Additional file 1: Fig. S1), which may be due to the presence of suberin
in their cell wall that can strongly affect the release of protoplasts [96]. In addition,
Chen et al. Genome Biology          (2021) 22:319 
Page 13 of 22

although we have excluded the effect of the cell-cycle genes before cell clustering, we
still found that the genes involved in cell cycling and division were specifically
expressed in clusters 14 and 15, without any other confirmed marker genes to deter-
mine their cell types (Fig. 1D, Additional file 1: Fig. S12). Therefore, further improve-
ment of the protocol for preparing protoplasts from these cell types is needed, and
future results of scRNA-seq analysis must be carefully verified using other techniques,
such as promoter reporter analysis and cell lineage tracing. Alternatively, application of
single nucleus RNA sequencing and/or spatial transcriptomics technologies to vascular
tissue may address these issues [97, 98].
Our results clearly confirm the power of scRNA-seq to reveal cellular heterogeneity,
discover new cell types, and characterize cell states along the developmental trajectory
of poplar stems that would be missed by lower resolution sequencing. For example, our
scRNA-seq data revealed two subtypes of xylem parenchyma cells and their state tran-
sitions along the differentiation trajectory of xylem cells (Fig. 3). Our results also re-
vealed that the cells within and/or around the vascular cambium are highly
heterogeneous, although we cannot faithfully construct a continuous differentiation tra-
jectory of these cells, possibly due to the relatively low representation of procambium
and precursor cells, or failure of our current protocol to capture some intermediate cell
types. Nevertheless, the identified multiple cell-type-specific marker genes (Additional
file 6: Table S5), together with the gene expression dynamics along the developmental
trajectories of phloem and xylem cells, provide insights with unprecedented resolution
into vascular cell differentiation in poplar stems. Finally, co-expression networks de-
rived from scRNA-seq data such as the set obtained in this study have clear utility for
identifying new regulatory genes and predicting the functional redundancy of homolo-
gous genes. In the future, molecular functional verification of these candidate markers
will help to understand the cell differentiation and fate determination during the vascu-
lar development of trees at single-cell resolution.
Conclusions
In this study, we applied scRNA-seq technology to highly lignified poplar stems and
found that they are composed of highly heterogeneous cells. We identified a total of 20
putative cell clusters with a series of novel cell-type-specific marker genes, whose ex-
pression dynamics were further used to reconstruct the cell differentiation trajectories
involved in phloem and xylem development. We also investigated the complex hormo-
nal response patterns of these cell types during poplar vascular development, and em-
phasized the use of our data to predict potential gene redundancy and identify
candidate genes related to vascular development in trees. In conclusion, our research
established a transcriptional landscape of the major cell types of poplar stems at single-
cell resolution and provided a valuable resource for studying the basic principles of vas-
cular cell specification and differentiation in trees.
Methods
Poplar growth conditions and protoplast isolation
Populus alba var. pyramidalis plantlets were grown in a greenhouse with a photoperiod
of 16 h light/8 h darkness and 60% humidity. The stems below the third internode of
Chen et al. Genome Biology          (2021) 22:319 
Page 14 of 22

three 4-month-old poplars were harvested, separated into bark and wood, and cut into
1-cm segments. The segments from bark and wood tissues were mixed separately, and
then respectively submerged in cell wall digestion solution consisting of 1.5% (wt/vol)
cellulase R-10, 0.4% (wt/vol) macerozyme R-10, 0.5 M mannitol, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM
CaCl2, and 0.1% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin [38]. And the mixtures were placed in
a shaker at 50–55 rpm for 2.5 h in the dark at room temperature to release protoplasts
respectively. The protoplasts were filtered with a 40-μm cell strainer to eliminate any
clumped cells, and collected by centrifugation at 100×g for 4 min. Since the protoplasts
were very fragile in the washing buffers recommended by 10x Genomics, we used W5
solution (5 mM glucose, 2 mM MES (pH 5.7), 154 mM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM
KCl) to gently wash and resuspend the protoplasts three times. After removing the
supernatant, the protoplasts were resuspended by adding a small amount of digestion
solution without enzyme to avoid the influence of excessive calcium on the reverse
transcription reaction. The concentration and viability of the protoplasts were esti-
mated by trypan blue staining, and high-quality protoplasts with viability ≥75% were
immediately processed with the 10x Genomics Single Cell Protocol (CG00052, RevC).
scRNA-seq library construction and sequencing
The scRNA-seq libraries were constructed using the 10x Chromium Single Cell 3′
Platform according to the manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). Briefly, the
protoplasts isolated from bark or wood tissues were loaded into a Chromium
microfluidic chip with 3′ v2 chemistry and barcoded with a 10x Chromium Con-
troller to generate single cell GEMs (gel beads in emulsion). scRNA-seq libraries
were subsequently prepared using a Chromium Single Cell 3′ reagent kit v2 (10x
Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). The DNA libraries were qualitatively analyzed using an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and paired-end reads were produced by an Illumina
HiSeq 2000 platform.
scRNA-seq data pre-processing
The raw scRNA-seq reads from wood and bark tissues were separately aligned to the P.
alba var. pyramidalis reference genome [99], using the Cell Ranger pipelines (https://
support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-
cell-ranger) with default parameters (v2.0, 10x Genomics), and expression matrices for
each gene and each cell were generated. The gene-cell matrices were then loaded into the
Seurat package (v3.1.0) for further analysis [100]. To remove the low-quality genes and
cells, only the genes that were expressed in at least three cells were considered, and we fil-
tered the cells with expressed genes over 9000 or fewer than 200. Cells with less than 500
or more than 70,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were also filtered out, as well as
cells with more than 5% mitochondrial genes. In addition, doublets (two or multiple cells
in one oil droplet) in each scRNA-seq dataset were detected with DoubletFinder (v2.0.3)
[101] using the number of artificial doublets (pN) of 0.25. To identify the optimal neigh-
borhood size (pK), the function “paramSweep_v3” was executed using parameter “PCs =
1:20” and the maximum of pK value was selected as an optimal pK parameter. For the es-
timate of the number of expected real doublets (nExp), the doublet formation rate was as-
sumed as 7.5% and nExp value was then adjusted according to homotypic doublet
Chen et al. Genome Biology          (2021) 22:319 
Page 15 of 22

proportion. Finally, the parameters of nExp, pN, and pK were set to “223, 0.25, 0.005” and
“265, 0.25, 0.3” for wood and bark dataset respectively, and only cells marked with “Sin-
glets” were retained for further analysis. After filtering, 3626 and 3170 cells from bark and
wood tissues, respectively, remained in the matrix. We integrated these two scRNA-seq
datasets into an experiment-wide feature-barcode matrix for subsequent analysis, using
combined canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [102] and mutual nearest neighbors
(MNN) [103] methods in the Seurat package (v3.1.0) [100].
Cell clustering and identification of cluster-enriched genes
The scaled gene-cell matrix obtained as described above was normalized by “LogNor-
malize” in Seurat (v3.1.0) [100]. To mitigate the effects of protoplasting and cell-cycle
heterogeneity on cell clustering [26], the cell cycle score and the proportion of proto-
plasting genes in each cell were calculated by the “CellCycleScoring” and “Percentage-
FeatureSet” function provided in Seurat. The cell-cycle and protoplasting genes were
identified as the closest homologous genes to Arabidopsis, which are provided by two
published papers [104, 105]. The variations resulted from cell-cycle and protoplasting
genes were regressed out by the “ScaleData” function using “vars.to.regress.” Then, we
identified the highly variable genes using “FindVariableFeatures” with “selection.method
= "vst"” parameter, and the top 2000 genes were used for linear dimensionality reduc-
tion by principal component analysis (PCA). The first 30 PCs were used as inputs for a
graph-based approach to identify cell clusters [106], which were further visualized and
explored by t-SNE (with parameter “dims = 20”) [107] and UMAP (with parameter
“umap.method = "umap-learn"”) [108]. We also identified cluster-enriched genes using
“FindAllMarkers” with parameters “min.pct = 0.25” and “logfc.threshold = 0.58” imple-
mented in Seurat (v3.1.0) [100]. Cluster-specific marker genes were finally selected
from these cluster-enriched genes that were expressed in at least 25% of the cells in a
cluster, but less than 25% of the cells in all other clusters.
Sequencing and analysis of bulk RNA-seq
The stems below the third internode of a 4-month-old poplar were harvested, separated
into bark and wood, and frozen immediately for bulk RNA sequencing. Briefly, total
RNA extracted from each tissue was used for library construction and deep sequencing
by BGISEQ-500 (BGI-Shenzhen, China). The obtained clean reads were aligned to the
reference genome [99] using HISAT2 (v2.1.0) [109], and then the expression levels
were calculated and normalized by StringTie (v1.3.3b) [110]. Finally, the Pearson corre-
lations between bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets were calculated in R. In
addition, the transcriptome data of cryosections from the secondary phloem, vascular
cambium, and wood-forming tissues of P. tremula were downloaded [15]. MCScanX
[111] software was used to identify 17,403 orthologs between P. tremula and P. alba
var. pyramidalis. Then Pearson correlations between gene expression levels of our
scRNA-seq and the RNA-seq of cryosections were calculated.
RNA in situ hybridization
We conducted mRNA in situ hybridization as previously described [112]. Briefly, fifth
internode of 4-month-old poplar were collected and immediately fixed in FAA (10%
Chen et al. Genome Biology          (2021) 22:319 
Page 16 of 22

formaldehyde, 5% acetic acid, 47.5% ethanol) for 48 h. The fixed tissue was dehydrated
through a graded alcohol series (70, 85, 90, 95, and 100%) and a HistoClear series, then
embedded in paraplast. Then, 10-μm sections were cut and mounted on Pro-beOn Plus
Slides (Fisher Scientific, 22-230-900). APL, ABR1, and ESK1a probes were labeled using
a DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche). Primer sequences for all genes were listed in Add-
itional file 11: Table S10. And then hybridization and detection of hybridization signals
were performed as previously described [112] using a DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit
(Roche).
Pseudo-time analysis
To explore the developmental trajectories of specific cell clusters, the R package
Monocle2 (v2.10.0) [72] was used. Briefly, the subset of raw data from target cell
clusters were first extracted, and the variance in each gene’s expression across cells
was calculated using “dispersionTable.” Variable genes were then determined based
on average expression level (with parameters “mean_expression > = 0.1” and “dis-
persion_empirical > = 1 * dispersion_fit”) to define a developmental progress. The
dimensionality of the data was subsequently reduced to two components using the
“DDRTree” method, and the trajectory was inferred with the “orderCells” function.
The pseudo-time trajectory was then plotted using the “plot_cell_trajectory” func-
tion in Monocle2 (v2.10.0) [72]. Finally, we used “BEAM” to identify the branch-
dependent or pseudo-time-dependent genes, which were visualized by the “plot_
genes_branched_heatmap” function. The dynamical expression of genes along the
pseudo-time were visualized by the “plot_pseudotime_heatmap” function in Mon-
ocle2 (v2.10.0) [72].
Functional and motif enrichment analysis
We performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis to detect and evaluate
cluster-specific or branch-dependent genes with an in-house perl script (https://
github.com/wk8910/bio_tools/blob/master/15.GO_analysis/02.go_enrichment/).
For GO enrichment, all genes, bark-expressed genes, and wood-expressed genes
were selected as background sets in cluster-specific (Fig. 1D), phloem-branch-
dependent (Fig. 2E), and xylem-branch-dependent (Fig. 3D) analysis, respect-
ively. P value was obtained by Fisher’s exact test and adjusted by Benjamini-
Hochberg false discovery rate. Motif enrichment analysis of interesting gene sets
was performed using a built-in script of Homer (findmotif.pl) [113], with pro-
moters of wood-expressed genes as the background and “Arabidopsis” as “Pro-
moter Sets.”
scRNA-seq co-expression analysis
To perform co-expression analysis using our scRNA-seq data, Pearson’s correlation co-
efficient between the expression level of each gene pair was calculated to identify genes
with similar expression patterns. And the gene correlation network was displayed using
Cytoscape (v3.7.1) [114]. In addition, we calculated Jaccard index value (also known as
Jaccard similarity coefficient) for each pair of genes expressed in at least 1% of the cap-
tured cells [28]. For each gene, the cells with at least 1 UMI were assigned a value of 1,
Chen et al. Genome Biology          (2021) 22:319 
Page 17 of 22

and all other cells were assigned a value of 0. To explore functional redundancy be-
tween paralogs, we first identified WGD-derived paralogs as previously described [99],
and filtered the gene pairs if one or both copies lacked UMI values. In total, 5143
WGD-derived paralogs were finally retained to compare their Jaccard index values. The
non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rate and their ratio were esti-
mated using the “yn00” function in PAML (v4.9e) [115].
