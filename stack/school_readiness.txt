Abstract 
'School readiness' is at the forefront of current Early Childhood Educational policy 
and is seen politically as a way of narrowing the attainment gap and breaking the cycle 
of poverty, and preparing children for the formal learning of Year One.  However, 
there is no clear definition of what 'school readiness' means for teachers and children.  
Without this in place the phrase is left open to interpretation and contradictions, 
resulting in key divisions between policymakers and the Early Childhood community 
as to what being 'school ready' means.  Furthermore, when 'school readiness' is 
positioned within policy as 'academic readiness', conflicts and tensions arise between 
traditional Early Childhood pedagogical practices and the realities of working within 
a framework where there is a clear emphasis on Mathematical and Literacy outcomes. 
 
Viewed through a socio-constructivist lens, 'readiness for school' is seen as a fluid 
construct, dependent on the beliefs of those working with children.  The aim of this 
research was to explore the beliefs of two Reception teachers using Cultural-Historical 
Activity Theory (CHAT) that acknowledges teachers as being part of a collective 
activity system.  Within this methodological framework, teachers are seen as thinkers 
and actors whose purposes, values and knowledge are displayed within the activity 
systems they inhabit.  The ways in which 'school readiness' was constructed through 
pedagogical practices were identified, and the tensions and contradictions that 
emerged between these practices and the beliefs of the teachers were explored in depth.   
 
An Internet survey questionnaire was used as a way of providing a broader 
understanding of teacher perceptions around constructs of ‘school readiness’.  
Interviews with the two participants were carried out to illuminate specific beliefs about 
'school readiness', and to identify how teachers conceptualised the construction of 
'school readiness' in the classroom.  The analysis of these interviews focused on 
'manifestations of contradictions' (Engeström & Sannino, 2011) within the data that 
highlighted tensions between beliefs, pedagogical practices, and curricular and 
assessment policy frameworks. 
 
The findings from the research illustrate the complexities of 'school readiness' as a 
transitional concept, and the reductionist nature of using the Good Level of 

 
iii
Development (GLD) as a measure of 'school readiness'.  Using 'school readiness' as 
a performativity and accountability measure serves to subjugate both teachers and 
children, and further marginalises already marginalised groups of children if they fail 
to reach the GLD. 
 
This study reiterates the importance of providing a clear definition with regards to what 
'school readiness' means, and whether it refers to the institutional transition into 
school, or the curricular transition from Reception into Year One.  The research also 
furthers the debate around the outcomes children are expected to reach by the end of 
Reception as a measure of 'school readiness', particularly those focusing on more 
instrumental skills such as Mathematics and Literacy.

Introduction 
Introducing the Thesis 
The purpose of this thesis is to explore teacher beliefs about ‘school readiness’ and 
how ‘school readiness’ is constructed within a Reception classroom.  The research 
explores perspectives of two teachers working in the same school in north-west 
England with the aim of identifying tensions and contradictions between personal 
beliefs about ‘school readiness’ within the context of Early Childhood Education (ECE), 
and pedagogical practices that take place in the classroom.   
In England, Reception is the first year of a child’s primary school education. The 
compulsory school age is five years old which is low compared to other countries in 
Europe, the most common starting age being six years old (DfE, 2014).  Yet, as a result 
of a one-point date of entry into Reception in September, the reality for most children 
is a school starting age of four.  As a consequence, many children in Reception who 
have not reached the compulsory school age are expected to achieve prescribed 
outcomes across seven areas of learning:  
• 
Communication and Language 
• 
Personal, Social and Emotional Development 
• 
Physical Development 
• 
Mathematics 
• 
Literacy 
• 
Understanding of the World 
• 
Expressive Arts & Design  
  
As the final year of the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), Reception has been 
positioned as the ‘transition’ year between the Early Years curriculum and the more 
formal Key Stage One of the National Curriculum (Faulkner & Coates, 2013, p.23).  
However, over the course of the last few years, 'school readiness' has crept to the 
forefront of ECE policy, and Pascal et al. (2017) argue that this increased prominence 
and the 'accompanying schoolification of early years pedagogy' are political actions 

 
2
that reflect a shift in beliefs about the purpose of ECE within policy making (p.6).  In 
2010, the Department for Education (DfE, 2010a) published the Business Plan 2011 - 
2015 in which it was announced that indicators of 'Readiness to progress to next stage 
of schooling' would be developed (p.22).  In the same year Dame Claire Tickell was 
invited by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government to carry out a 
review of the EYFS in order to focus on 'getting children ready for education and to 
increasing the attainment of children from deprived backgrounds' (DfE, 2010b).  This 
discourse marks a clear shift in emphasis as the Early Years becomes a place for 
'readying' children for school, and one which Moss (2013) argues locates the problem 
of 'readiness' as being within the child rather than the system (p.14).  The focus of 
‘school readiness’ is dependent on the performance of the child and what they know 
and are able to do to 'negotiate school expectations’, rather than schools being held 
accountable for being ready for the child (Bingham & Whitebread, 2012, p.53).  
Standards of performance at the end of the EYFS are judged through the use of the 
Good Level of Development (GLD) as a measure of 'school readiness', and Moss (2013) 
argues that these prescribed outcomes are liable to lead to a 'schoolification' of the 
Early Years (p.10).  ‘Schoolification’ is a term that holds considerable negative 
connotations as a system that fails to honour the ‘traditions and practices’ of ECE 
through the delivery of ‘structured content and prescribed pedagogical practices’ 
(Kagan, 2013, p.138).  This is further exacerbated by the Government's assertion that 
'a good foundation in Mathematics and Literacy is crucial for later success, particularly 
in terms of children's readiness for school’ (STA, 2013), highlighting a clear link 
between ‘school readiness’ and academic outcomes. 
Pertinent to this debate is the assertion that teachers have to deal with 'new kinds of 
complex problems, in a situation where knowledge and tradition are being called into 
question in various ways' (Höijer et al., 2006, p.357).  Through the identification of 
the tensions and contradictions between existing beliefs and the political 'shifting 
landscape' (Clandinin et al., 2009, p.145), a key aim of the research was to explore 
what these problems are and the impact that they have on teachers and their 
classroom practice, and on the children they work with.  It is acknowledged that the 
role of the teacher within the classroom is complex and dynamic when we consider 

 
3
the many different interactions that take place with different people and in different 
contexts (Kay, 2015a).  This study was approached using a socio-cultural perspective 
that captures the interactions and relationships between the teacher and the 
collective dimension of the classroom as an activity system, as well as considering 
contextual factors such as the use of tools as mediating artefacts (Lund, 2008, p.34).  
Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) (Engeström, 1999) enables the exploration 
of these collective classroom activity processes and positions the use of tools as 
mediating artefacts at the forefront of the research (Kay, 2015b).  This framework 
allows the examination of how teachers conceptualise the object of their activity in 
order to construct an outcome of ‘school readiness’, and how they draw on different 
aspects of the activity system to achieve this.  Furthermore, CHAT addresses the 
social and collective dimensions of a teacher’s practice, and enables the exploration 
of the contextual and collective activity processes that take place and the tensions and 
contradictions that may arise through these interactions.     
Constructs and Conceptions of ‘School Readiness’ 
Kagan (1990) argues that two constructs of ‘school readiness’ have dominated 
discourse, that of ‘readiness for learning’ and ‘readiness for school’ (p.273).  
Distinguishing between the two, ‘readiness for learning’ is conceptualised as a 
‘developmental progression’ reflecting the ability of a child to learn specific pre-
determined curriculum content (Scott-Little et al., 2006, p.154) and Kagan (1990) 
suggests that there are multiple factors affecting this construct including ‘motivation, 
physical development, intellectual ability, emotional maturity, and health’ (p.273).  
Conversely, ‘readiness for school’ is considered to be ‘a fixed or prerequisite set of 
physical, intellectual, and/or social skills needed in order for children to be able to fulfil 
the requirements of the school environment’ (Scott-Little et al., 2006, p.154).  
Debates surrounding these two constructs of ‘readiness’ are strongly influenced by 
developmental ideas, which in turn are influential on beliefs about whether a child is 
ready to make successful transitions (Vogler et al., 2008, p.7).   
A. Brown (2015) contends that ‘readiness’ is multi-dimensional, and includes ‘the skills 
of the child, family and environmental factors, behavioral and cognitive aspects of a 

 
4
child’s development, the child’s adaptation to the classroom, and the characteristics 
of the educational and community systems available to the child and family’ (p.183).  
These dimensions are encapsulated in the four conceptions of readiness identified by 
Meisels (1998) that frame ‘the readiness equation’ in a certain way: The 
empiricist/environmental, the idealist/nativist, the interactionist, and the socio-
constructivist perspectives (p.12).  The four theoretical perspectives have been 
summarised and displayed in Table 1.

Importance is placed upon social and 
cognitive competencies that enable 
the child to become a self-regulated 
learner 
‘Readiness’ is 
embedded within a 
child’s social and 
cultural context 
 
There is no single 
definition of ‘readiness’ 
as it is reliant on the 
personal beliefs of 
those working with the 
child  
 
The idealist/nativist perspective holds the view that a child’s development cannot be 
accelerated beyond their natural potential, and within this context a readiness to learn 
cannot be forced but must be allowed to emerge in due course (Meisels, 1999, p.47).  
External influences such as parental attitudes, the socio-economic environment and 

 
5
educational experiences are set aside, and instead the focus is placed upon ‘the 
internal dynamics of the child’ (p.13).  Subscribing to an idealist/nativist position 
assumes that an ‘inner time clock’ drives a child’s development and consequently 
‘readiness’ is influenced by biology rather than environment (May & Kundert, 1997, 
p.74).    
The empiricist/environmentalist model focuses exclusively on the learning of skills and 
knowledge that prepare the child for school, on what the child can do, for instance, 
recognise shape and colour names, and how they behave (Dockett & Perry, 2002a; 
Meisels, 1999).  Through this lens, ECE is seen as a vehicle for equipping children with 
the skills, knowledge and experiences that they need to be ‘ready for school’ (Brown, 
C., 2010, p.136).  This perspective is reflected in the Statutory Framework for the 
Early Years Foundation Stage (DfE, 2014/2017) asserting that it ‘promotes teaching 
and learning to ensure children’s ‘school readiness’ and gives children the broad range 
of knowledge and skills that provide the right foundation for good future progress 
through school and life’ (p.5).  This model aligns with Kagan’s (1990) construct of 
‘readiness for school’ rather than ‘readiness for learning’, as concrete skills and 
experiences are valued as ‘precursors to successful school experiences, rather than as 
ends in themselves’ (Meisels, 1998, p.10). 
Scott-Little et al. (2006) assert that from an interactionist perspective, ‘school 
readiness’ is a ‘multi-faceted construct that includes the capacity of families, early care 
and education programs, and the broader community to support children’s early 
learning and development, and the capacity of schools to effectively educate children 
once they start school’ (p.155).  Dockett and Perry (2009) contend that 
‘understanding children’s readiness for school must go beyond assessing children’s 
skills and abilities and judging how well children will fit within the existing structure of 
school’.  Instead, ‘school readiness’ should be seen as a complex set of interactions 
between individuals, families, schools and the wider community (p.25).  The 
relationship between the school and the child is instrumental in promoting ‘readiness’ 
as each influence the other.  The child is seen to contribute to their own learning and 
to the environment within which they operate, whilst the environment and those 
within it has a ‘reciprocal influence on the child’ (Dockett & Perry, 2002a, p.71).

A socio-constructivist perspective emphasises the importance of social and cognitive 
competencies that will enable the child to become a ‘self-regulated learner capable of 
establishing adequate social relationships with other participants in the 
teaching/learning process’ over the mastering of a set of pre-requisite skills (Bodrova 
& Leong, 2003, p.168).  ‘Readiness’ is seen as being embedded within a child’s social 
and cultural context, and that the development of thinking and memory are the 
outcome of these specific cultural experiences (Gredler, 1992, p.14).  Viewed 
through a socio-constructivist lens, ‘readiness’ is defined by the ‘beliefs, expectations, 
understandings and experiences of those in the school, and the community in which 
the school exists’ (Dockett & Perry, 2002a, p.71).  Scott-Little et al. (2006) argue that 
from this perspective there is ‘no one absolute definition of “readiness”’ as multiple 
forces influence personal beliefs about what skills, knowledge and abilities are needed 
for later academic success in school (p.155).  Therefore, ‘school readiness’ is viewed 
as a fluid construct that is ‘defined by the social setting in which the child resides’ 
(Brown, C., 2010, p.136). 
Shallwani (2009) argues that 'school readiness is a socially constructed notion 
grounded in beliefs about society, its systems, and the roles different members play' 
(p.8).  Research carried out exploring parent and teacher beliefs about readiness 
suggest that views vary about what skills and dispositions are important, and what 
'school readiness' actually means (Smith & Shepard, 1988; Graue, 1992; Dockett & 
Perry, 2002a).  Based on findings from her own research that examined the idea that 
‘readiness’ is a set of meanings constructed by people in communities, families and 
schools, Graue (1992) highlights that 'the social interpretations of readiness and the 
ensuing instructional setting varied so widely that a single definition would be 
impossible to construct' (p.239).  When we view 'readiness' through a post-modern 
lens, the co-existence of different points of view means that a 'one-size-fits-all 
definition' is too simplistic to accommodate the diversity and subjectivity of these 
multiple truths and perspectives (Myers, 2004, p.19).  It can be argued that the 
diversity of the beliefs and values of teachers highlights that there is 'no external 
position of certainty, no universal understanding that exists outside history or society 
that can provide foundations for truth, knowledge and ethics' (Dahlberg et al., 1999, 

 
7
p.23).  Alongside these diverse personal beliefs and value systems, other factors 
fundamentally influencing pedagogical practices include policy, curriculum and 
practice guidance, and the experience of initial and continuing professional 
development (Stephen, 2010, p.19).  This begins to highlight some of the 
complexities involved in conceptions of ‘school readiness’, particularly when this 
agenda is then constructed in certain ways through current educational policy 
frameworks, explored in more depth in the next chapter.  
Defining 'School Readiness’ 
Graue et al. (2002) assert that ‘readiness is lived through others’ perceptions and 
interpretations’ (p.350).  As a result, the perceptions and interpretations that 
attempt to define ‘readiness’ have been the subject of much debate resulting in a 
multitude of meanings (Kagan, 2007, p.14).  Within an English educational context, 
this is highlighted in the OfSTED document Are You Ready? Good Practice in School 
Readiness (2014) where it is stated that ‘the precise characteristics of school readiness 
and the age of the child to which it applies are interpreted variously by the providers 
we visited. There is no nationally agreed definition’ (p.6).  This is echoed in the report 
State of the Nation 2015: Social Mobility and Child Poverty in Great Britain (Social 
Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, 2015) which asserts that ‘The lack of a 
common-sense, clear, shared understanding of what constitutes school readiness 
between parents, public health officials (health visitors), local authorities, schools and 
early education providers is a wasted opportunity’ (p.16).  In addition to this, it is also 
unclear whether ‘school readiness’ refers to transition into Year One, or at the start 
of entry into Reception (OfSTED, 2014, p.8).  As a consequence, Local Authorities and 
other children's services have been left to establish their own definition of what 
'school readiness' means.  This lack of coherence is exemplified in Table 2 which 
presents a snapshot of the different definitions of 'school readiness' as specified in 
local government policies.

Personal and Professional Context 
Viewing this study through a socio-cultural lens, it is important to acknowledge that 
as the researcher I am also located within the research, and therefore it is pertinent 
to adopt a reflexive approach to help identify my own thoughts, beliefs, values and 
identity within 'professional, cultural and political contexts' (Bolton, 2006, p.204).  
What follows is a narrative that explores my own positionality with regards to aspects 
of the 'school readiness' debate. 

 
9
In 2004, at the beginning of my teaching career, I worked in a Year One classroom.  
The school was situated in an area of socio-economic deprivation and had children on 
roll who came from troubled and chaotic home backgrounds, many of whom entered 
Nursery and Reception with limited language and social skills.  The philosophy of the 
school was a 'quality first' approach to teaching and learning, where lessons were 
interactive and engaging, and role play provision was present in each classroom up to 
Year Six.  At the time, the recommended advice from the Local Authority was that a 
Foundation Stage approach should be adopted in Year One until the end of the 
Autumn term to help ease transition for children into the more formal aspects of Key 
Stage One.  My own classroom was set up to ensure children were able to access 
resources independently, and alongside the small group work activities they were 
required to do, there were plentiful opportunities throughout the day for the children 
to play.  At this time, there was no talk of 'school readiness', instead there was a clear 
focus on transition where the priority was to prepare a child emotionally rather than 
academically for Year One. 
In 2008, I decided to take a part-time position in the Nursery class knowing very little 
about the EYFS or theories of learning and development.  The Nursery class was part 
of an Early Years unit shared with Reception, so activities and resources were set up 
for both classes to access.  My own learning curve was steep as my teaching 
qualification had been gained through the Graduate Teacher Programme which was 
mainly classroom based, and not as 'theory focused' as other teaching qualifications.  
Whilst the children in the Reception class participated in more adult-led activities, the 
emphasis within the Early Years unit was always on play-based learning.  End of year 
data was a concern because of the nature of the school we were in, and there were 
pressures, particularly in Reception, for the children to achieve the expected 
attainment.  However, the culture of the classroom was always to prepare children 
so they were able to access learning opportunities, rather than being forced to 
undertake tasks for which they were not yet ready.   
A few years into my teaching career I wanted to further develop my understanding of 
ECE and enrolled on the MA at the University of Sheffield.  For my final dissertation, 
I focused on how children's interests can be used to support learning.  I had become 

 
10
interested in home education and had read about the democratic schooling approach 
of A. S. Neill's Summerhill School, and so decided to carry out my research exploring 
how three families who were home educating used their children's interests to 
support learning.  What consistently emerged from my conversations with all of the 
families was the idea of 'readiness'.  One of my participants described how she 
watched and waited for her children's interests to develop, stating "I’m holding their 
space and I’m appreciating what’s going on and valuing what’s happening and 
protecting them to be able to do that ...... holding their space so they can get on and 
naturally develop" (Kay, 2013).  The idea of living for the moment, enjoying and 
celebrating what children can do rather than constantly pushing them on to the next 
stage of learning was very powerful and provocative to me as a researcher, a teacher 
and a mother. 
Reflecting on these personal and professional experiences I am reminded of a 
question that my supervisor has posed numerous times over the course of this thesis: 
Ready for what?  My doctoral work has focused on the impact policy frameworks 
have had on the Early Years, and I have taken a critical stance against the 'top down' 
pressures being placed on children and teachers.  My beliefs about teaching do not 
easily align with the constraints being placed on teachers to ensure children reach the 
GLD, particularly when I consider the learning outcomes for Literacy and Mathematics 
are often unachievable for certain children at that particular point in time.  Further 
frustrations arise when I remember the children I worked with, some of whom came 
to school with multiple issues and complexities, yet would still be expected to reach 
the same outcomes as their more fortunate peers.   
Having taught in a number of classrooms, I recognise that they are dynamic, fluid, and 
complex systems full of interaction and activity as teachers grapple with the differing 
needs of the children in their class.  Discovering CHAT (Engeström, 1996) enabled me 
to frame this research and unpick the multiple influences and interactions that take 
place in the collective dimension of the classroom as an activity system.  
Furthermore, CHAT has also helped to identify any tensions and contradictions 
between teacher beliefs and practice.  Acknowledging that there are clear tensions 
between my own beliefs and the requirements expected of me as a teacher, I am 

 
11
interested in how other teachers navigate the demands placed upon them to get 
children 'ready for school'. 
Core Research Question and Supplementary Questions 
Core Research Question: 
What beliefs do teachers hold about 'school readiness', how is 'school readiness' 
constructed within the classroom, and what tensions emerge between these beliefs, 
policy frameworks and pedagogical practice? 
Supplementary Research Questions: 
How is ‘school readiness’ defined in Government policy in England? 
What do teachers in the Early Years perceive ‘school readiness’ to be? 
How is ‘school readiness’ constructed within the Reception classroom?  
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs about ‘school 
readiness’ and pedagogical practice? 
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs about ‘school 
readiness’ and policy frameworks?  
Thesis Structure 
Chapter 2 – Policy Analysis 
In this chapter, I undertook a policy analysis using elements of the ‘What’s the problem 
represented to be?’ (WPR) (Bacchi, 2009) approach as an overarching framework.  
For the purpose of the analysis, the Statutory Framework for the Early Years 
Foundation Stage (EYFS) (DfE, 2014/2017) was selected as the core policy document, 
along with the Early Years Outcomes (DfE, 2013a) and the Early Years Foundation Stage 
Profile (EYFSP) (STA, 2016).  Hyatt's (2013a) Critical Policy Discourse Analysis frame 
was used to uncover how policy discourses construct 'school readiness' and how 
language is used in these constructions. 
 

 
12
Chapter 3 - Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as a Research Framework 
Here I outline how Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (Engeström, 1996) was used as 
a methodological and conceptual framework and how the research was structured.  
Using this framework helped to highlight the many different forces and influences that 
are at play within a classroom at any given point in time, and how teachers navigate 
these forces to ensure children achieve the outcome of 'school readiness' by the end 
of Reception.  This was also a useful tool to identify the tensions and contradictions 
within the data which became a key focus for this research.   
Chapter 4 - Methodological Considerations   
This chapter describes the methodology used and provides a justification of the 
methodological framework, the research location and sample, an overview of the 
research design, the data collection methods, the ethical considerations and issues of 
trustworthiness. 
Chapter 5 - Findings and Analysis 
The key findings of the research are discussed in relation to the supplementary 
research questions, and tensions and contradictions that emerged from the data are 
explored in depth. 
Chapter 6 - Discussion 
In this chapter, CHAT is used again to frame the discussion using the key tensions that 
emerged from the data to form the basis of the discussion.   
Chapter 7 - Conclusion  
In the final chapter I consider the limitations of the study and the implications for 
future research.  I also discuss the contribution to new knowledge that this research 
has brought to contemporary debate.

Chapter 2   
‘School Readiness’: The Best Start in Life? 
 
The 'school readiness' agenda has become a prominent driving force in current 
education policy.  This chapter will examine how the regulatory nature of policy 
discourse defines 'school readiness', 'school readiness' practices and the 'school 
ready' child, which is then interpreted and delivered by the teacher.  This will help to 
lay the foundations for an in-depth exploration into the tensions and contradictions 
regarding the traditional practices of Early Years pedagogy and the political shift 
towards an emphasis on more formal approaches in the Early Years in order to 'ready' 
children for school, played out alongside a culture of accountability and 
performativity.  
The impact that the political climate has had on the teacher and classroom activity is 
a relatively new phenomenon when it is considered that governmental interest in the 
Early Years in the United Kingdom began to emerge after the publication of the 
Education Reform Act in 1988.  Prior to the Education Act (DfES, 1988), infant and 
primary education in the 1960's and 1970's had followed a progressive and child-
centred ideology endorsed by the Plowden Report (1967), with an emphasis on 
'exploration, discovery, hands-on experience, child-initiated activity, and the 
importance of choice, independence and control' (Aubrey et al., 2003, p.14).  
Stevenson (2011) argues that the 1988 Education Reform Act was a key 'neoliberal 
moment' and that 'the future trajectory of educational policy was set on an entirely 
different course' (p.182).  The market-driven ideology of neoliberalism reduces 
everything to money, management and technical practice, and is at odds with 
democratic practice that embraces diversity, critical thinking, curiosity and the 
recognition of multiple perspectives (Moss, 2007).  Clandinin et al. (2009) refer to 
this as a ‘shifting landscape’ whereby teachers are ‘caught in the squall’ as new policies 
are implemented with an increasing focus on standardised accountability (p.145).  In 
England, this accountability takes the form of the outcomes-driven Statutory 
Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) (DfE, 2014/2017) curricular 

 
14
framework, and the current summative assessment procedure of the Early Years 
Foundation Stage Profile (DfE, 2015a), the results of which are reported to the 
Government.  Roberts-Holmes (2015a) argues that these factors are ‘disciplinary 
technologies leading to an intensification of ‘school readiness’ pressures upon the 
earliest stage of education’ (p.304).  As part of this thesis, the following analysis will 
explore how ‘school readiness’ is constructed within ECE policy, what the ‘school 
readiness’ pressures are, and how they impact on teachers and children. 
Bacchi's WPR Approach 
In order to make sense of the ‘messy’ nature of policy development, the ‘What’s the 
problem represented to be?’ (WPR) (Bacchi, 2009) approach was used as an 
overarching framework.  Bacchi (2009) advises that as a starting point to the analysis 
a specific piece of legislation is selected, and that this in itself is an 'interpretive 
exercise' and a way of reflecting particular interests and concerns (p.20).  With this 
in mind the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) (DfE, 
2014/2017) has been selected as a policy framework that all providers in receipt of the 
Early Years funding in England are required to follow.  The Early Years Outcomes (DfE, 
2013a), a non-statutory document that provides the collection of statements 
specifying the expected level of development for each area of learning, and the Early 
Years Foundation Stage Profile (STA, 2016) that guides the completion of the end of 
year assessments in Reception, were also included as key documents in this analysis. 
Within the WPR framework, policy is defined as ‘prescriptive texts’ that provide ‘points 
of entry to the problematisation and problem representations that require scrutiny’ 
(Bacchi, 2009, p.34).  WPR uses a set of six questions to interrogate policy texts and 
processes: 
1) 
What's the problem represented to be? 
2) 
What presuppositions or assumptions underlie this representation of 
the 'problem'? 
3) 
How has the representation of the 'problem' come about? 
4) 
What is left unproblematic in this problem representation?  Where 
are the silences?  Can the problem be thought of differently? 

 
15
5) 
What effects are produced by this representation of this 'problem'? 
6) 
How/where is this representation of this problem produced, 
disseminated and defended?   How could it be questioned, disrupted or 
replaced? (Bacchi, 2009, p.2) 
 
Due to limitations with the thesis word count it was not feasible to address these 
questions in turn, so key questions (italicised) were selected in order to draw out 
policy narratives regarding the constructions of ‘school readiness' in the EYFS (DfE, 
2014/2017) and wider policy directives.  As a way of focusing the analysis, the work 
of Blestas (2012) was adapted and the following questions were devised from Bacchi's 
framework to guide the discussion:   
• How did 'school readiness' come to be seen as a 'problem' for the government?   
• What forms of governing practice are enabled where 'school readiness' (or 
'unreadiness') is constructed in this way as a problem?   
• What are the effects of this formation for teachers and children? (p.40).  
Due to the complex nature of the discussion, rather than being answered in turn, the 
questions are addressed in a holistic way throughout the chapter.    
Drawing on Foucauldian analysis, Bacchi (2009) acknowledges that the WPR 
framework poses a challenge when considering 'agency' (p.45) and with this in mind 
it was deemed necessary to be cautious using a Foucauldian lens for the policy 
analysis.  The purpose of this thesis is to critically engage with issues of 'school 
readiness' from teachers’ perspectives, and to identify tensions and contradictions 
between the ways in which 'school readiness' is constructed within political discourse, 
and in the classroom.  Discussed in more depth in the following chapter, using CHAT 
as a methodological framework positions the teacher as a 'social subject' who 
contributes to the collective activity system through unique contributions based on 
their knowing, being and doing (Stetsenko, 2013, p.9).  Furthermore, it was 
recognised that the exploration of the tensions and contradictions that emerge 
between policy and practice may reveal spaces for resistance, or different 
interpretations and iterations of classroom practice, and this forms the basis of the 
Analysis and Discussion chapters.  As Giddens (1984) argues, 'Action depends upon 
the capability of the individual to 'make a difference' to a pre-existing state of affairs 

 
16
or course of events' (p.14) and that this 'action logically involves power in the sense 
of transformative capacity' (p.15).  Newton (1998) contends that based on this 
perspective, Foucauldian work can be criticised for not providing the means to explore 
how 'active agential selves' can make a difference within discursive practices (p.426).   
Language and discourse are often positioned as a mediating artefact within the CHAT 
framework, and as a way of interrogating political discourse, Critical Discourse 
Analysis (CDA) (Fairclough, 1995) was viewed as being a suitable alternative to a 
Foucauldian approach.  The aim of the analysis is to reveal how 'school readiness' is 
constructed within policy discourse, and how this construct is 'shaped and 
characterised ideologically through relations of power' (Hyatt, 2013a, p.837).  An 
important task, therefore, is to identify the ideology driving the process of educational 
policymaking in ECE, and how policy is affected by this ideology.  Therefore, in order 
to 'disassemble the contextual backdrop of educational policymaking' (Liasidou, 2012, 
p.89), Hyatt's (2013a) Critical Policy Discourse Analysis Frame, a CDA-based 
orientation, will be utilised. 
Hyatt's Critical Policy Discourse Analysis Frame 
Ball (1993) presents two different conceptualisations of policy: policy-as-text and 
policy-as-discourse (p.10).  More recent approaches to policy analysis focus on the 
latter, positioning discourse as a 'central concept', a process that also involves the 
'production, reification and implementation of policy' (Hyatt, 2013b, p.44).  Policies 
are ‘textual interventions into practice’ posing ‘problems to their subjects’, and 
creating circumstances in which ‘the range of options available in deciding what to do 
are narrowed or changed’ (Ball, 1993, p.12).  As Bacchi (2000) argues, the premise 
behind a 'policy-as-discourse' approach is that problems are created through the very 
same policies that are offering the solutions (p.48).  Discourses are viewed as 
'socially and culturally formed', offering certain perspectives that come to be 
considered as 'normal', and others as 'deviant' or 'marginal' (Hyatt, 2013a, p.837).  
Boag-Munroe (2010) asserts that CDA can be used within the CHAT activity system to 
'understand the interaction of documents and speech within activity', and the way 
policy documents shape the work of teachers (p.120).  Using Hyatt's frame will 

 
17
uncover how policy discourses 'represent and construct' 'school readiness', and how 
language is used as a 'discursive agent' in these constructions.  As a way of framing 
the discussion, the questions taken from the WPR framework have been mapped to 
aspects of the Critical Policy Discourse Analysis Frame and represented in Table 3.  
This analysis of discursive practice will involve a combination of the macro- and the 
micro- as mutual requisites mediating ‘the relationship between the dimensions of 
social practice and text’ (Fairclough, 1992, p.86).     
Table 3 - Mapping the questions to a discursive framework 
 
This policy analysis is part of an overall empirical study and therefore it was deemed 
pertinent to be selective regarding the elements of the Critical Policy Discourse 
Analysis Frame.  Hyatt (2013a) advises that the frame is not meant to be an 'all-
encompassing, universal tool', and that users should select 'aspects of the frame that 
are useful' (p.837).  With this in mind, Table 4 highlights the elements that have been 
utilised as part of this analysis, and offers a brief summary to explain how these have 
been applied during the process of analysis.

What is 'School Readiness' Meant to Achieve? 
Hyatt (2013a) asserts that as a starting point to the analysis it is useful to identify the 
intended aims, drivers and levers of the policy as a way of understanding its 
'evolution', and the way it is 'interpreted in different contexts' (p.838).  In order to 
understand how the EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) constructs 'school readiness' it is pertinent 
first of all to examine the key drivers and levers that surround this policy.  As a way 
of exploring the wider context, key policy documents were examined that have 
influenced the 'school readiness' agenda in ECE, represented in Diagram 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
19
Diagram 1 - Key policy documents that have influenced the 'school readiness' agenda 
in ECE 
 
What follows is a discussion centring on two key themes that emerged from these 
documents regarding the aims of the ‘school readiness’ agenda which brings attention 
to the interdiscursive nature of ECE policy:
1) 
To break the cycle of poverty through investment at the most 'cost-
effective' point in time 
2) 
To prepare children for the formal learning of Key Stage One  
 
A dominant discourse across all the policies that have been examined as part of this 
analysis has been the overarching goal of ensuring children have 'the best start in life' 
(Allen, 2011; DfE/DH, 2011; Field, 2011).  It is not contested that this is a 'good thing' 
and a worthy driver behind both economic and educational policy.  However, 
Langston (2014) highlights how the interdiscursive nature of education and economics 
creates a 'tension' between ECE as an entity that is beneficial to children, compared 
with the view that it is for the 'greater benefit of society' (p.18). This analysis, 

 
20
therefore, will interrogate whether the way 'school readiness' is constructed in policy 
is 'the best start in life' for all children, particularly disadvantaged and marginalised 
children who are at the heart of this policy agenda.       
Breaking the Cycle of Poverty 
Arnold et al. (2008) argue that ‘Globally, socio-economic status has consistently been 
found to be one of the most critical influences on children’s developmental outcomes’ 
(p.28).  Parenting, constructed through the responsiveness of parent-child 
interactions and the quality of the home-learning environment, is a key factor 
explaining socio-economic status gaps in child outcomes and inequality in ‘school 
readiness’ (Waldfogel, 2013).  The relationship between poverty and 'school 
unreadiness' is explicitly stated in The Foundation Years: Preventing Poor Children 
Become Poor Adults (Field, 2010) (Figure 1).  Referring back to the WPR framework, 
the ‘problem’ is starkly presented as a ‘political warrant’, targeting disadvantaged 
children and suggesting that, as a result, they will be unable to benefit from the 
resources that are available to them once at school.  In this context, ‘school 
readiness’ becomes a political agenda, a way of addressing the gap between children 
living in socio-economic disadvantage and their more affluent peers.           
Figure 1 - Evidentiary and political warrant 
 

 
21
This segment also presents what Hyatt (2013a) refers to as an 'evidentiary warrant’ 
whereby conclusions are based on evidence, in this case Feinstein’s (2003) report 
Inequality in the Early Cognitive Development of British Children in the 1970 Cohort, 
that draws on data from the 1970 Birth Cohort Survey (BCS).  Considering Hyatt’s 
(2013a) argument that ‘evidence is not a neutral entity’, rather it is ‘embedded in 
ideology’, it is interesting to note that this report uses the BCS study as an evidence 
base for the purpose of informing economists of the process of 'human capital 
formation’.  Opening Doors, Breaking Barriers: A Strategy for Social Mobility (Cabinet 
Office, 2011) highlights how 'Children at the age of five living in poverty are the 
equivalent of around eight months behind their peers in terms of cognitive 
development' (p.6) and this ultimately impacts on social mobility leaving 'the country's 
economic potential unfulfilled' (p.5).  When viewed in a national context, State of the 
Nation 2015: Social Mobility and Child Poverty in Great Britain (Social Mobility and 
Child Poverty Commission, 2015) states that 'less than half of the poorest children in 
England are ready for school' (p.vi) describing social mobility as the 'new holy grail of 
public policy' (p.iv).  Osgood (2009) argues that this creates a ‘particular discursive 
landscape’ which positions ECE and the ‘school readiness’ agenda as ‘central to the 
economic prosperity of society’ (p.735).  ‘School readiness’, therefore, is viewed by 
the Government as a social panacea, a way of breaking the cycle of poverty and 
reducing future economic burdens on the welfare state.   
This ‘political warrant’ is also illustrated in The Foundation Years: Preventing Poor 
Children Become Poor Adults (Field, 2010) (Figure 2) as a justification for a strategy of 
early intervention. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
22
Figure 2 - Political warrant 
 
Describing life as a ‘race’ is reminiscent of neoliberal discourses of ‘competition’, 
evoking thoughts of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’, particularly poignant when framed in a way 
that suggests some children are already ‘losers’ before they even start school, and 
that parents/caregivers have failed.  Early intervention to ensure children are ready 
for school gives those from disadvantaged backgrounds the chance to catch up with 
their more affluent peers and stand a better chance of not necessarily winning the 
‘race’, but at least managing to take part.  Hence, 'breaking the cycle' of poverty by 
targeting children before they arrive at school frames ECE as a ‘technology for 
ensuring social regulation and economic success’, positioning the child as the ‘future 
solution to our current problems’ (Dahlberg & Moss, 2005, p.vii). 
The current ‘school readiness’ agenda is seen to be a solution to the cycle of poverty 
and a way of ensuring children grow up to be financially contributing members of 
society.  The recognition that there is a significant gap between children depending 
on their socio-economic circumstances also highlights the need to support families to 
ensure children are ready for school and give them the best possible start to their 
educational career as way of narrowing the attainment gap.  This discussion that 
follows will explore in more depth whether the focus on ‘school readiness’ in ECE, and 
the incumbent intervention strategies, helps to address these key political and social 
issues.

Investment in ECE and the Model of Early Intervention 
As part of this focus on investment in ECE, a model of early intervention is a key policy 
lever in the implementation of the ‘school readiness’ agenda, something Gillies (2014) 
asserts has come to ‘occupy an increasingly ideological role in the context of 
contemporary austerity politics’ (p.219).  It is argued that in order to narrow the gaps 
for 'under-achieving children' action has to begin much earlier, and pre-school and 
parenting policy has been constructed to play a prevalent part in this (Pascal & 
Bertram, 2013, p.12).  A speech given by the then Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg 
(2011) acknowledged the relationship between a child's socio-economic background 
and their readiness for school, and re-iterated the Government's commitment to 
improve social mobility through investment in the Early Years and by addressing the 
issue of 'school readiness'.  Investing in ‘readying’ children seen to be at risk of not 
succeeding in school by providing them with the knowledge and skills to achieve 
standardised measures of academic achievement is a way of reducing the burden on 
social and educational services in the long term (Brown, C., 2015, p.207).   This is re-
enforced in the Improving School Readiness: Creating a Better Start for Manchester 
(Public Health England, 2016) report where the financial return that will be gained 
from an investment in the Early Years, specifically ‘school readiness’, is prevalent.  
The report argues the case for an investment in ‘school readiness’ stating ‘The costs of 
delivery per child are outweighed by the benefits to the individual, taxpayers and 
others through improved educational outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, reduced 
crime and increased taxes paid due to increased earning as adults’ (p.8).  This 
economic argument, Moss (2014) argues, is the ‘story of neoliberalism’, offering a 
‘comprehensive worldview about how all human life can and should be reduced to a 
set of economic relationships and values’ (p.63).  
The Allen Review (2011) and the Field Review (2010) were instrumental in pushing a 
model of early intervention to ensure 'school readiness'.  In a speech about 
opportunity, given after winning the general election in 2015, the Conservative Prime 
Minister pledged his commitment to these interventions stating:   

 
24
And because all the evidence shows if you focus on the early years you have the 
best chance of transforming a child’s life, we will look at how we can create a 
much more coherent offer to support children and parents in the early years, 
bringing together all those services targeted at getting children school-ready by 
age 4 (Cameron, 2015). 
ECE is seen as being central to the ‘treatment’ and a ‘key solution to long-standing 
social problems, ensuring disadvantaged families are implicated and targeted’ 
(Simpson et al., 2015, p.97).  Early intervention is a policy lever, intended to ensure 
children are ‘school ready’ so they have the best start when they begin school.  Both 
policy documents discussed here strongly advocate that the political focus should be 
about children from low-income families being able to access high-quality care and 
education as a way of narrowing the attainment gap.  It is argued that effective early 
intervention helps to break the inter-generational cycles of social problems, not only 
because this is a key period of development, but also because parents can be ‘more 
receptive to state or third sector intervention when children are young’ (Bate, 2017, 
p.26). 
The analytical process in Figure 3, taken from Early Intervention: The Next Steps (Allen, 
2011), highlights the proposals that children, particularly those from disadvantaged 
backgrounds, should be targeted at a point that will potentially be the most successful 
in economic terms, through a model of intervention (p.xvi).  Re-iterated in Early 
Intervention: Next Steps (Allen, 2011) it is suggested that the period from conception 
to a child starting school is a time of preparation in order to 'make' children ready for 
school (p.67) (Figure 4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
25
Figure 3 - A model of investment and intervention 
 
Figure 4 - Preparing children for school from conception 
 
Figure 3 again draws attention to the interdiscursivity of the ‘school readiness’ agenda 
whereby the importance of the child being ‘school ready’ is placed within an economic 

 
26
context and financial investment is justified as a long-term money-saving exercise 
(Kay, 2015a).  Furthermore, the failure to be on the ‘path to “school readiness”’ is 
discursively positioned as an environmental problem stemming from a child’s family 
background (Allen, 2011, p.xvi).  The family and individual are, therefore, positioned 
as a site for intervention to address poverty whilst the government are responsible for 
ensuring poor children and their parents get help through investment in local services 
(Simpson & Envy, 2015, p.167).  Through these assessments, children who deviate 
from the 'path' of 'school readiness', or in other words, do not achieve the determined 
outcomes, are identified and interventions put in place to ensure they are put back on 
track.  This demonstrates how assessment policy in ECE defines what is ‘normal’ and 
how children who do not demonstrate this ‘normal’ developmental trajectory are 
‘abnormal, pathological and in need of intervention’ (Prout, 2005, p.50).  The 
potential for these assessment processes to re-enforce the inequalities they are trying 
to address will be explored in more depth in the final section of this chapter. 
In September 2017, there was a national roll out of thirty hours of free childcare for 
working families, seen as ‘a potentially powerful tool to ensure the school-readiness 
of large numbers of children and to increase maternal employment’ (Social Mobility 
and Child Poverty Commission, 2015, p.20).  However, here again we see neoliberal 
ideology driving Early Childhood policy highlighted in the publication More Great 
Childcare: Raising Quality and Giving Parents More Choice (DfE, 2013b, p.6) (Figure 5) 
where it is asserted that childcare is a way of preparing children for the ‘global race’.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
27
Figure 5 - Highlighting dichotomy within policy discourse 
 
Lloyd (2015) argues that recent governments have displayed an inability to separate 
ECE policy promoting children's life chances through learning and development, and 
childcare policies aimed at supporting family economics and working parents (p.147).  
The government has explicitly targeted ‘working parents’ as a key driver behind this 
policy (Conservative Party Manifesto, 2015), which Johnes and Hutchinson (2016) 
argue prioritises parental employment over the ‘potential purposes of Early Years 
provision’ running the risk of having a negative impact on narrowing the attainment 
gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged children (p.9).  The rhetoric is 
very clear in Figure 5 that the two main priorities are getting parents back to work and 
ensuring children are ‘ready for school’, but Wild et al. (2015) argue that the focus of 
this policy is on availability and choice of provision for parents, rather than the quality 
of education the children will receive (p.237).  They go on to assert that in More 
Great Childcare: Raising Quality and Giving Parents More Choice (DfE, 2013b), 
readying children for school involves meeting cognitive and behavioural outcomes, 
rather than fostering a happy and engaged learner (Wild et al., 2015, p.241). 
The discursive construction of 'school readiness' discussed in this section highlights 
how early intervention is used to improve the socio–economic prospects of future 
generations, and how this becomes problematic when policy is driven by the need to 

 
28
see a return on government investment rather than a consideration of what is best for 
young children.  The next section will explore the second theme in this analysis, how 
'school readiness' is constructed within the EYFS as a way of preparing children for 
transition into the more formal pedagogy of Year One. 
Preparing Children for Formal Learning 
In 1989 the government introduced the English Primary National Curriculum, which 
saw six- and seven-year old children being assessed for ‘value added’ progress at the 
end of Key Stage One.  As the year group that precedes Key Stage One, this was to 
have an impact on children in Reception by bringing the ‘boundaries of schooling’ to 
the forefront of Early Years educational policy, drawing attention to the needs of four- 
and five-year olds in Reception classrooms (Aubrey et al., 2000, p.85).  As a 
consequence, the Desirable Learning Outcomes (SCAA, 1996) document was 
published that laid out six areas of learning directly linked to National Curriculum 
assessment level descriptors, demonstrating an emphasis on preparation for the 
National Curriculum rather than a consideration of a developmentally appropriate 
curriculum (Lindsay & Desforges, 1998, p.4).  This is significant as it was the first time 
that universally prescribed outcomes had been imposed on children this young.  
Table 5 displays the trajectory of curricular policy documents in England that followed 
on from the Desirable Learning Outcomes.

Wood and Attfield (2005) argue that the emphasis on outcomes rather than process 
highlighted an ‘explicit political agenda’ that focused on providing children with a 
‘head start into Key Stage 1’ (p.21).  Policymakers had started to focus on Early Years 
provision as a way of ensuring ‘school readiness’, raising standards and ultimately 
achieving higher test outcomes (Bingham & Whitebread, 2012, p.21).  Discourses 
around the importance of ‘high quality’ education were becoming more prominent as 
a way of ensuring ‘lasting cognitive and social benefits in children’ through the 
achievement of pre-defined learning goals, placing early learning and development on 
the national policy agenda for the first time (DfE, 2011).    
At the end of the twentieth century there was a pressing need for a ‘coherent 
curriculum’ for the three- to five- year old age range, clearly delineating ‘elements of 
progression’ that would provide a robust alternative to the Desirable Learning 
Outcomes (SCAA, 1996) (Anning, 1998).  A report written by Bertram and Pascal 
(2000) identified that, because of the lack of regulation of the private, voluntary and 
independent (PVI) sector, there were inconsistencies in the quality of preschool 
provision. Furthermore, the lack of a well-defined curriculum framework for the 
under-fives had led to the National Curriculum being pushed down into the Early Years 
(p.51).  This ‘coherent curriculum’ came in the form of the Curriculum Guidance for 
the Foundation Stage (CGFS) (QCA, 2000) which provided a nationalised and regulated 
standard framework for children aged three to five, the core aim of which was to 

 
30
provide a ‘smooth path from birth into compulsory schooling’ (Faulkner & Coates, 
2013, p.22).  
The CGFS (QCA, 2000) framework followed a ‘standards-based’ agenda with the 
requirement that children worked towards the Early Learning Goals (ELGs) (QCA, 
1999) which formed the basis of the summative assessment known as the Foundation 
Stage Profile (FSP) (QCA, 2003/2008) at the end of Reception.  Summative 
assessment data was based on formative assessments taken over the school year, 
along with the teacher’s knowledge of the child, enabling teachers to monitor 
children’s progress against the ELGs.  In 2008, the Statutory Framework for the Early 
Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) (DCSF, 2007) was published as a single curriculum 
framework for children from birth to five, building on principles laid out in the CGFS 
and merging with the Birth to Three Matters (DfES, 2002) framework.  The FSP (QCA, 
2003/2008) remained as the main assessment tool at the end of Reception.  With 
the publication of the EYFS it was generally felt that policymakers had listened to the 
voice of the professionals and that this new framework underpinned the beliefs of 
many Early Years specialists (Anning, 2009, p.69).  However, Wood and Hedges 
(2016) assert that despite ‘explicit cautions about a linear model of progression’, the 
focus of the EYFS shifted from how children typically develop, to the learning 
outcomes children should achieve by the age of five, with an ‘instrumental policy 
emphasis on improving school readiness’ (p.392).     
In the government-commissioned review The Early Years: Foundations for Life, Health 
and Learning (2011) Tickell highlights the tension between those who are concerned 
children should be ‘free to enjoy their early years without pressure’ and the danger of 
failing to prepare children for ‘realities of the school environment, where skills such as 
Literacy are at a premium’ (p.19).  The aim of this review was to reduce the 
bureaucracy involved in administering the EYFS framework (DCSF, 2007) and shift the 
focus of the Early Years towards ‘getting children ready for education’, reducing the 
number of ELGs, and increasing the attainment of children from socially deprived 
backgrounds (DfE, 2010b).   As part of the terms of reference for the review, a letter 
from the then Children's Minister, Sarah Teather, stipulates that a key issue of the 

 
31
review was to prepare children for 'formal learning' as they move into Key Stage One 
(Figure 6).  It is also pertinent here to draw attention to the evidence that supported 
this review presented in The Early Years Foundation Stage Review (DfE, 2011), and how 
it came mainly from government-commissioned reviews and reports emphasising the 
self-referential discourse used in policymaking (Figure 7).

Figure 7 – Evidence of self-referential discourse 
 
Three prime areas (Personal and Social Development, Physical Development, and 
Communication and Language) and four specific areas of learning (Mathematics, 
Literacy, Understanding of the World, and Expressive Arts and Design) were devised to 
‘cover the knowledge and skills which are the foundations for children’s school 
readiness and future progress’ as well as providing an ‘appropriate baseline for the 
National Curriculum’ in Mathematics and Literacy (DfE, 2012a, p.1).  The revised EYFS 
(DfE, 2014/2017) aimed to simplify the curriculum, reducing the number of ELGs from 
69 to 17, but one of the over-riding purposes of the revised framework was to prepare 
children for school (Figure 8).

Reiterated in Supporting Families in the Foundation Years (DfE/DH, 2011, p.62) (Figure 
9), these statements highlight the emphasis that was now placed on ‘school readiness’, 
and present a clear rationale for the Statutory Framework for the Early Years 
Foundation Stage (DfE, 2014/2017) (Figure 10) whereby ECE is seen as a vehicle for 
equipping children with the skills, knowledge and experiences that they need to be 
‘ready for school’ (Brown, C., 2010, p.136).  This approach to ECE again neatly aligns 
with the empiricist/environmentalist model that focuses exclusively on learning skills 
and knowledge that prepare the child for school, on what the child can do, for instance, 
recognise shape and colour names, and how they behave (Dockett & Perry, 2002a; 
Meisels, 1999).  
Figure 9 - Teaching should focus on 'school readiness' 
 

 
34
Figure 10 - The construction of 'school readiness' in the EYFS  
 
Guidance from Wilshaw (2014), chief inspector of the Office for Standards in Education 
(OfSTED), echoes this warrant of accountability in a letter to Early Years inspectors by 
stating that school inspectors should focus on ‘evaluating whether children are being 
adequately prepared for the start of their statutory schooling’ and to observe ‘how 
effectively adults teach children to develop skills, knowledge and understanding’.  
Whilst there is still an emphasis on providing children with a range of knowledge and 
skills in-keeping with traditional Early Years philosophy, the value of this comes from 
‘readying’ children for school, rather than the acknowledgement of a child’s 
achievements. 
As a way of ensuring children have the 'broad range of knowledge and skills' specified 
in the EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) it is asserted that children should be introduced to more 
formal teaching practices as they reach the end of Reception.  Policymakers argue 
that an earlier start into school for children from disadvantaged backgrounds provides 
an opportunity to ‘make up the deficit in their academic skills’ (Sharp, 2002, p.1).  
This is highlighted in the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage 
(DfE, 2017a, p.9) (Figure 11), and Supporting Families in the Foundation Years (DfE/DH, 
2011, p.18) (Figure 12).

Figure 11 - Policy expectations working towards transition 
 
Figure 12 - Further policy expectations working towards transition 
 
The government has sometimes been scathing in its attitude towards the nature of the 
Early Years highlighted in 2013 by the then Education minister, Liz Truss, who declared 
that she had observed “too many chaotic settings, where children are running 
around”, instead, advocating that children be involved in “structured play” that the 
“teacher is clearly leading” (Chapman & Chorley, 2013, online).  Despite the 
evidence, policymakers have ignored the call to delay formal schooling, often 
reverting to the rhetoric of school as being a place of formal instruction, enunciated 
by Gove’s (2013) declaration that England “move towards an education system which 
believes, right from the early years, in The Importance of Teaching”.  Within the two 
extracts above, the shift towards a more formal approach to learning is presented as 
an 'expectation' rather than a recommendation.  Here we can see how rhetoric sets 
down the discursive foundations designed to shape the work of teachers, so that at 
the end of Reception children are taking part in more 'adult-led' activities in order to 
'ready' them for Year One, and any alternative will put them at a disadvantage.  

 
36
Additionally, this expected shift in pedagogy, as presented in Figure 11, appears to be 
a means to an end, the act of preparing children for more guided learning with an 
adult, than any educational benefits this may have for the child whilst they are still in 
Reception.  
An early introduction to formal schooling does not, however, appear to improve 
academic achievement in the long term, but this is further problematised when 
research findings highlight how this approach could actually be damaging to children’s 
self-esteem and self-confidence in themselves as learners.  Work carried out in 
Northern Ireland by Walsh et al. (2006) comparing the quality of learning experiences 
for children following a traditional curriculum and a ‘more developmentally 
appropriate, play-based and child-centred curriculum’ (p.201), found that the latter 
appealed more to the ‘children’s level of interest and enthusiasm’ whilst the formal 
curriculum seemed to put children ‘under pressure to complete tasks in a certain time 
and fashion’ (p.213).  Sharp (2002) suggests that early introduction to a formal 
curriculum may have a ‘negative impact on children’s self-esteem and motivation to 
learn’ (p.18).  This creates a troubling context when a more formal approach is being 
re-enforced through the outcomes-driven expectations of the EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) 
and the consideration that pressures to achieve these outcomes may be impacting on 
pedagogical approaches in the Reception classroom.  
A number of organisations have petitioned for formal schooling to be delayed and the 
EYFS to be extended until children are aged six or seven.  The “Too Much, Too Soon” 
campaign, made up of a large group of ECE experts, has called for ‘an extension of 
informal, play-based pre-school provision and a delay to the start of formal ‘schooling’ 
in England from the current effective start until the age of seven’ (Whitebread, 2013).  
The Cambridge Primary Review (Hofkins & Northen, 2009) asserts that this would give 
children enough time to establish positive attitudes to learning and to begin to 
develop the language and study skills essential to their later progress (p.17).  BERA 
and TACTYC (2014) have also advised the EYFS should be extended to ‘support a better 
transition from early years to primary in line with the majority of developed countries’ 
(p.1), supported by research carried out by Sylva et al. (2004a) which found an 
extended period of high quality pre-school provision had the ‘strongest effect on 

 
37
development’ (p.iv).  Whitebread et al. (2012) assert that whilst in some European 
countries there is still an emphasis on providing children with ‘rich, stimulating 
experiences’, increasingly an ‘earlier is better’ approach is adopted in England with a 
particular focus on the formal skills of Literacy and Mathematics (p.3).  However, in 
spite of these arguments, there are wider international pressures emanating that 
reinforce the human capital discourse underpinning school readiness, and that 
specifically foreground attainment in Mathematics and Literacy.    
The Importance of Mathematics and Literacy  
The Organisation for Economic and Co-operative Development (OECD) (2012) 
acknowledges that there is widespread debate about the ‘correct curriculum 
approach’ for children in ECE, and that areas of learning that receive most focus in 
official curricula are Mathematics and Literacy delivered as a way of privileging 
readiness for school.  It argues that countries in the ‘social pedagogy tradition’ 
include Literacy and Mathematics but do so in an ‘open and holistic curriculum’, even 
beyond the Early Years into early primary classes (p.83).  Indeed, the Starting Strong 
II (OECD, 2006) report warns against the global pressures of formal ECE provision, 
arguing that early education is being driven by ‘an instrumental and narrow discourse 
about readiness for school’ (p.219).  However, in contradiction to this perspective, 
the OECD has been responsible for defining what competencies are important when 
building human capital, and has become a major influence in global education policy 
due to the ‘measure and compare’ approach of the skills of each nation (Sellar & 
Lingard, 2013, p.718).  The process of education, as such, is transformed into an 
entity that provides the child with the ‘commodity of credentials’ in order to gain 
employment, earn financial capital, and ultimately become a consumer in the market 
that defines society (Brown, C. et al., 2015, p.139).  Within the context of ECE this 
becomes problematic when we consider that the ‘knowledge economy paradigm and 
a vision of children as ‘human capital’’ does not necessarily align comfortably with the 
ECE tradition of play as a medium for learning (Nyland & Ng, 2016, p.474).  Jensen et 
al. (2010) argue that ‘The international political focus on learning in early childhood 
education and care – primarily on language and social competences – aims to bring 

 
38
preschool closer to school’ and go on to assert that there is an emerging tendency to 
focus on narrow objectives and a ‘readiness for school’ agenda (p.252). 
The emphasis placed on ‘school readiness’ within the curriculum rather than ‘broader 
understandings of life-long learning dispositions, wellbeing and holistic learning’ has 
led to what Roberts-Holmes (2015b) asserts is the ‘schoolification’ of the Early Years 
(p.72).  Flewitt and Roberts-Holmes (2015) argue that ‘discourses of economy have 
dominated neoliberal national and global arguments for educational transformation’ 
and that Mathematics and Literacy are commonly seen to be the panacea for the 
‘social ills of poverty, unemployment and poor health’ (p.96).  A speech given by the 
then Secretary of State for Education, Nicky Morgan (2016) makes reference to the 
2013 OECD survey of adult skills and how “England was the only country in the 
developed world where the Literacy and Mathematics levels of 16- to 24- year olds 
were no better than amongst 55- to 65- year olds”, even though the basic education 
of other nations had improved generation on generation.  Despite placing obvious 
importance on the global OECD rankings of the UK education system, Morgan then 
goes on to assert that in 2010 the government had “inherited an education system 
which was more concerned with league tables than time tables”.  At the end of her 
speech she claims: 
... we now have a system with academic rigour at its core; with the freedom 
for teachers and school leaders to innovate; with new qualifications that 
are pegged to the highest-performing nations in the world; and with higher 
levels of Mathematics and Literacy than ever before.   
This reflects the ideological level of influence of the OECD, and the need for actors to 
'win or maintain the acceptance of other member countries' (Alasuutari, 2005, p.6).  
Although the OECD has no formal control over its members, it has become a powerful 
player in western market democracies and has successfully implemented direct forms 
of governance, particularly within the education system.  A key driving force in the 
significant use of data in policy processes, the OECD has positioned itself as a centre 
of ‘technical expertise, data collection and data analysis’ at a time when data has 
become central to governance at global and national level (Sellar & Lingard, 2013, 
p.716).  This collection of data is carried out by the Programme for International 
Student Assessment (PISA), the International Association for the Evaluation of 

 
39
Educational Achievement’s (IEA’s), Trends in International Mathematics and Science 
Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading and Literacy Study (PIRLS), which 
Lingard et al. (2013) argue has had considerable global impact on national education 
systems (p.540).  The OECD decides the criteria by which a country's performance is 
compared and assessed, thus forming what Alasuutari (2005) refers to as an 'epistemic 
community' (p.6) that creates a 'global field of education policy' as a 'single space of 
measurement and comparison' (Lingard et al., 2013, p.549).  The influence of the 
OECD has permeated educational policy in England as the government strives to 
compete on the global stage, and this pushes down into the Early Years as an ‘earlier 
is better’ approach is adopted as a way of gaining a ‘head start’ in the race to the top.   
Morris (2016) argues that ‘the growing tendency in England to see education through 
the prism of PISA has served to redefine the purposes of schooling and has contributed 
to a serious narrowing of the curricula provided to pupils’ (p.6).  The use of these 
comparative human capital assessment instruments reflects the ‘widespread 
contemporary imagination of education as a global ‘race’ for economic 
competitiveness’ (Sellar & Lingard, 2013, p.717).  The ‘singular and narrow 
conception of the aims of education’ presented within the OECD assessment 
frameworks removes what it means to be a human being with complex and wide-
ranging needs to the perception that children are solely ‘sources of human capital, as 
measured by PISA’ (Morris, 2016, p.27).  As a result of this drive to compete globally, 
the state develops an ‘intervening role’ to ensure education providers respond to ‘the 
market and the disciplines of competition’ and Ingleby (2013) argues that this helps to 
explain the rise of a ‘bureaucratic standards-driven education’ in the Early Years 
(p.126).  The Early Years curriculum becomes a space where skills and attributes are 
taught to ensure children become 'neoliberal subjects', exemplified in the emphasis 
placed on Mathematical and Literacy outcomes that are considered 'fundamentally 
important for employment' (Sims & Waniganayake, 2015, p.337).  A ‘low stakes’ 
curriculum that focuses on ‘ways of knowing’ rather than ‘ways of being’ enables the 
curriculum to be easily regulated through ‘high stakes’ accountability at a national and 
global level (p.127). Within this educational context, children are decontextualised,

their achievements based on the preparation for future employment rather than the 
holistic development of the child as a person in their own right. 
A review of international literature by Dockett and Perry (2013) exploring ‘trends and 
tensions’ relating to starting school and ‘school readiness’ draws attention to the fact 
this phenomenon is not just confined to the English-speaking world with the inclusion 
of articles from Asia, Europe, Scandinavia and Africa (p.165).  The review highlights 
the importance of Literacy and Mathematics within the ‘school readiness’ agenda as 
an international trend, as is the reciprocal relationship between ‘school readiness’ and 
early Literacy and Mathematical achievement (p.167).  When we examine the 
ideological shift towards more technical approaches to ECE, particularly in countries 
that have historically practiced a social pedagogical tradition, the global influence of 
the OECD on Early Childhood curricula can be clearly seen.  
Sweden, which traditionally has strong roots in a ‘holistic, socio-pedagogical 
approach’, has recently revised its pre-school curriculum which includes more specific 
goals in Language/Literacy, Mathematics, Science and Technology, relating clearly to 
the assessment priorities of the OECD (Oberhuemer, 2013, p.178).  After a poor 
international ranking of children’s reading skills in 1994, Danish education policy began 
to mirror contemporary trends of accountability, effectiveness and quality in other 
OECD countries and started to promote the image of teaching as a ‘transmission of 
discrete skills’ (Jensen et al., 2010, p.248).  Findings from research carried out by 
Otterstad and Braathe (2010) in Norway day care centres indicate a shift away from a 
social pedagogy towards a ‘readiness for school’ discourse that perceives children as 
‘investments into economic and neoliberal rationales’ (p.3029).  Paananen et al. 
(2015) identify that in the Starting Strong II (OECD, 2006) publication it is stated that 
children are ‘entitled to express their views in all matters that affect them’ (p.219) 
whereas in Starting Strong III (OECD, 2012) the participation of the child is presented 
as being important ‘in order to facilitate effective learning of different curriculum 
elements’ (p.88).  Otterstad and Braathe (2010) assert that this highlights a clear shift 
away from children’s participation and autonomy into ‘a learning paradigm reflecting 
mapping and controlling of the individual child’ and that ‘international neoliberal 
discourses’ are forcing Early Years professionals in Nordic countries to ‘become more 

 
41
acquainted with preparing for schooling discourses’ (p.3026). The following section 
sets out how the assessment requirements in the EYFS construct the ‘school ready 
child’ in line with these wider contemporary neoliberal trends.  
The 'Good Level of Development'  
Western Early Childhood Educational frameworks partition child development into 
categories, usually focusing on the physical, cognitive, social and emotional areas of 
development that children are then expected to progress through by achieving certain 
‘developmental tasks’ (Shallwani, 2009, p.4).  The EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) is based on 
a linear trajectory of child development centred around seven areas of learning and 
development.  The Development Matters (DfE, 2012b) document provides guidance 
for practitioners implementing the statutory requirements of the EYFS specifying that 
children develop at their own rate and the development statements should be seen as 
a ‘typical range of development’ rather than necessary steps for individual children.  
The Early Years Outcomes (DfE, 2013a) (Figure 13) document maps ‘typical behaviours’ 
to the age of the child establishing what knowledge and skills are ‘expected’ at each 
stage of development.   
Figure 13 - The construction of 'normality' 
 
Currently, at the end of the Reception year, the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile 
(DfE, 2015a) provides a summative assessment of whether children have achieved the 
ELGs and are ‘meeting expected levels of development, or if they are exceeding 

 
42
expected levels, or not yet reaching expected levels (‘emerging’)’ (DfE, 2014/2017, 
p.15).  Whilst it is well-documented that there is no clear definition of ‘school 
readiness’ in an English policy context, the government uses the GLD (STA, 2017) as an 
assessment measure of ‘school readiness’.  The GLD equates to children who achieve 
at least the expected level within the prime areas of learning (personal, social and 
emotional development; physical development; and communication and language) 
and in the specific areas of Mathematics and Literacy by the end of Reception (STA, 
2017).  The outcomes children are expected to meet in these five areas in order to 
be assessed as being 'school ready' are represented visually in Diagram 2.        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
43
Diagram 2 - The 'School Ready' Child as defined by the GLD (STA, 2017) 
 
There is clear evidence to show that measuring ‘school readiness’ using the GLD is 
problematic as year-on-year results show children find the ‘expected’ outcomes 
difficult to achieve, and are therefore assessed as having failed to reach the ‘school 
readiness’ benchmark (DfE, 2012c; DfE, 2015b; DfE, 2016).  Particularly pertinent to 
this discussion is that there are specific groups of children (Table 6) who struggle to 
meet the ‘expected’ outcomes of the GLD and are entering Year One in a deficit 

 
44
position.  Reading, Writing and Numbers are the three areas of learning that children 
find most difficult, resulting in the lowest percentage of attainment across the EYFSP 
(DfE, 2015b, p.3).

Children who do not achieve these outcomes are assessed as ‘emerging’ rather than 
working at the ‘expected’ level at the end of Reception.  In this current context, 
children who are assessed as ‘emerging’ are now conceived as working at a lower level 
of development through the construction of normative expectations.  This is of 
concern when we consider the statements of ‘expected’ levels of development that 
are constructed within this discourse have shifted downwards over the past fifteen 
years and are now more academically difficult for children to achieve.  The following 
three representations (Figure 14, Figure 15 & Figure 16) display the outcomes from 
the old Foundation Stage Profile (QCA, 2008) and the old National Curriculum level 
descriptors (QCDA, 2010) for Writing, Reading and Mathematics, making comparisons 
between these outcomes and the current Early Years Outcomes (DfE, 2013a).

As can be seen in all the tables, the acknowledgement of what children who are 
'emerging' can do has been removed from the Early Years Outcomes (DfE, 2013a).  
This is in spite of recommendations made by Tickell (2011) that the revised EYFS 
‘should define what emerging, expecting and exceeding means for each early learning 
goal’ (p.58).  The Early Years Foundation Stage Profile 2017 Handbook (STA, 2016) 
states 'Where children have an outcome of ‘emerging’ for an ELG, it is likely that this 
will not provide full information about their learning and development at the end of 
the EYFS', and advises that there should be 'conversations' between Reception and 
Year One teachers to support transition (p.20).  Furthermore, the Early Years 
Outcomes (DfE, 2013a) specifies that the document should be used as a 'guide to 
making best-fit judgements' regarding whether children are developing typically 
(expected), are ahead for their age (exceeding), or are at 'risk of delay' (emerging) 
(p.3). 

 
47
Kummen (2011) argues that when a child is identified as being ready (or unready) for 
school through the classification of knowledge and behaviours associated with specific 
developmental standards, educational policy relies on a ‘ready/not ready’ binary 
(p.210).  This is highlighted in Tickell’s (2011) review of the EYFS where the notion of 
‘school readiness’ was explored from the position of children being ‘unready’ for 
school when they enter Reception or move up into Year One (p.19).  She 
acknowledges that ‘school readiness’ is often interpreted as formal learning, 
explaining that the antonymic reference to ‘unreadiness’ is in order to ‘avoid the more 
ambiguous and emotive connotations’ linked with ‘school readiness’ (p.19).  
However, if we consider the dominant discourse of assessment, it can be argued that 
the binary created is driven by the GLD (‘ready for school’), and the ‘lower level’ of 
development descriptor (‘unready for school’).  The significance of binaries is that 
one of the two terms ‘holds the superior position’ (Derrida, 1976, p.77) and the more 
valued of the two defines ‘the cultural standard of normalcy’ (Kummen, 2011, p.210).  
If we place this within a process of ‘othering’, children who are ‘unready’ for school 
are seen as being not only ‘different’ to those who are ‘ready’, but also in some way 
inferior (Price & Tayler, 2015, p.20) as they are judged as being at a lower stage in 
their expected development.  This in itself becomes an act of marginalisation and a 
way of denying the developmental complexities and variations of young children who 
will have a wealth of different social and cultural experiences.  
In the Improving School Readiness: Creating a better start for Manchester (Public 
Health England, 2016) report, two distinct categories of ready and unready groups of 
children can be identified (Table 7).  This demonstrates how binaries can be 
constructed through analysis of the assessment data using the GLD as a measure for 
‘school readiness’, and how specific groups of children can be identified as ‘not ready 
for school’.  Through the binary categorisation, and the clear connotations behind 
the phrases ‘good level’ and ‘low level’ of development, the ‘less privileged’ group of 
children are also those who are less likely to be ‘school ready’.

Bradbury (2013) argues that this ‘tripartite’ way of assessing children using ‘emerging’, 
‘expected’ and ‘exceeding’ re-enforces the ‘bottom-middle-top’ schema where only 
the ‘good learners’ will achieve ‘exceeding’.  This then has the potential to create 
‘disparities’ as those children who are assessed as ‘emerging’ at the end of Reception 
may be destined for a pattern of ‘lower-than-expected attainment’ as they move 
through the school system (p.151).  Children who are assessed as 'emerging' in the 
context of the GLD, are therefore positioned as being a potential target for 
intervention, despite claims made throughout the Development Matters in the Early 
Years Foundation Stage (DfE, 2012b) guidance that 'Children develop at their own 
rates, and in their own ways'. With this in mind, the following section explores 
whether the ‘school readiness’ agenda and the predefined outcomes of the GLD work 
for all children, or whether these policies further re-enforces the societal inequalities 
they are trying to address.  
Is this the 'Best Start in Life' for all Children? 
When readiness is viewed through an idealist/nativist or empiricist/environmentalist 
perspective, the responsibility of 'being ready' is placed upon the individual rather 
than the socio-cultural environment within which the child exists (Dockett & Perry, 
2002a, p.70).  Luria and Vygotsky (1956) assert that it is ‘wrong to reduce the 

 
49
development of the child to the mere growth and maturation of innate qualities’ 
arguing that children have a much more complex line of development formed through 
participation in cultural interactions and activities (p.144).   
Assessing children against these developmental frameworks creates an environment 
whereby, at the age of five, children are already being grouped by performance and 
ability, and are classified as being either ‘ahead’ or ‘behind’ in relation to their peers.  
The GLD is based on a ‘short-term test-driven regime’ that labels young children as 
failures, being ‘deficit’ to the ‘norms’ with all the ‘implications of reduced 
expectations’ (Roberts-Holmes, 2015b, p.73).  Furthermore, the system of scoring 
children as being either 1 (emerging), 2 (expected) or 3 (exceeding) is a ‘crude and 
simplistic classification system’ and with the ever-increasing expectations being placed 
on Mathematical and Literacy achievements, a high level of children are being left 
behind (p.76).  As a result, children who do not achieve a GLD at the end of Reception 
enter Year One in a ‘deficit position’, destined to trying to catch up with the peers 
whose ‘cultural experience predisposed them to be successful in this environment’ 
(Evans, 2015, p.34).  The use of these ‘universal stages of development’ as a way of 
classifying children disregards context and ignores social and cultural understandings 
which ultimately end up ‘replacing the richness of children’s lived lives, and the 
inescapable complexity of concrete experience’ (Dahlberg et al., 1999, p.36).  Rather 
the child is coerced into being a certain kind of child, arguably the ‘ideal learner’, 
positioned in a way that is both agent, ‘obliged to protect the prosperity off the nation’, 
as well as subject through which ‘interventions are inscribed’ (Sonu & Benson, 2016, 
p.236).   
Lenz Taguchi (2010) states that ‘the more we seem to know about the complexities of 
learning, children’s diverse strategies and multiple theories of knowledge, the more 
we seek to impose learning strategies and curriculum goals that reduce the 
complexities and diversities of this learning and knowledge’ (p.14).  Biesta (2010) 
argues that the complexities that children bring into the classroom are being reduced 
by organised schooling through the “channelling” or “taming” of human learning by a 
range of differing measures.  Only the outcomes that are selected are considered to 
be valuable, thereby serving to ‘reduce the complexity of human learning and bring 

 
50
this learning under control’ (p.7).  Therefore, it could be argued that the ELGs, 
specifically those linked with ‘readiness’, ‘validate the learning and development 
trajectories that are officially considered to be important’ (Evans, 2013, p.178). 
Osgood (2016) asserts that these dominant discourses privilege some groups of 
children over others, and further marginalise already marginalised groups (p.159) as 
can be seen clearly in the year-on-year results of the GLD.  When framed in this way, 
constructs of ‘readiness for school’ based on the achievement of an outcomes-driven 
GLD could be seen to exclude the very children and families that policy-makers are 
trying to address in their early education reforms (Brown, C., 2010, p.137).  Issues of 
power and social injustice are ignored when the focus of ‘school readiness’ discourse 
is placed on 'micro-level child and family characteristics' rather than 'macro-level 
systemic and political factors' (Shallwani, 2009, p.6).  The ascendancy of 
neoliberalism has seen the emergence of what Gillie (2008) refers to as the ‘new 
politics of parenting’, marked by a shift away from the welfare state towards a ‘social 
investment model’ positioning parents, specifically mothers, as having an essential 
role to play in ‘positive social mobility’ and ‘social equity’ (Simpson & Envy, 2015, 
p.168).  Inaction by parents to do this is then used as a reason for educational failure, 
in this case, the child who is not ‘school ready’, which distances the government from 
social responsibilities and places greater pressures on parents to fix problems such as 
inequalities in educational attainment which, as individuals, would be impossible for 
them to do (Wright, 2012, p.290).  Furthermore, Lingard et al. (2014) argue this 
'highly reductionist' education policy that focuses on improving test scores as the 'only 
sound basis for undertaking educational reform' means that schools with children 
from poorer communities have to focus more on these test score improvements at the 
potential expense of 'socially just curriculum provision' (p.726).  
This chapter has explored in some depth the discursive ECE landscape and the 
deterministic nature of policy constructs around 'school readiness' which teachers are 
expected to adhere to.  To summarise, I refer back to the three questions that were 
used to frame this discussion:  How did 'school readiness' come to be seen as a 
'problem' for the government?  What forms of governing practice are enabled where 
'school readiness' (or 'unreadiness') is constructed in this way as a problem?  What 

 
51
are the effects of this formation for teachers and children?  As part of this analysis I 
have argued that the key drivers behind this policy are twofold, and both are steeped 
in neoliberal ideology of globalism and economics.  Firstly, ensuring children are 
‘ready for school’ is seen as a way of narrowing the attainment gap between 
disadvantaged children and their more affluent peers in order to ‘break the cycle of 
poverty’ so all children grow up to be citizens who contribute financially to society.  
Secondly, the belief that introducing children to formal learning earlier rather than 
later is to give them a head start in the ‘race to the top’ and to position England as a 
key player in the global market.  However, problems emerge when the GLD is used 
to measure ‘school readiness’, and year-on-year results consistently show specific 
groups of children are not reaching the expected outcomes benchmarked as an 
indicator of ‘school readiness’.  It has been highlighted how the outcomes that 
children find difficult to achieve are Mathematics and Literacy, particularly Writing, 
and it must be questioned whether constructions of ‘school readiness’ within the 
classroom are focusing on more instrumental and technical skills and knowledge to 
ensure children reach the expected benchmarks.  Other issues arise when the 
deterministic nature of measuring ‘school readiness’ through the use of the GLD 
ignores the complexities of the social and cultural diversities of the youngest children 
in the school system.  
It is therefore questioned whether these expectations are at odds with the personal 
beliefs of teachers and their personal philosophies of ECE, and how teachers work 
within this discursive landscape.  Using CHAT as a methodological framework 
positions the teacher as a potential 'transformative agent', navigating tensions 
between their own beliefs about ‘school readiness’ and how policy frameworks are 
used to construct ‘school readiness’ in a complex and dynamic classroom 
environment.  The next chapter will explore in depth how CHAT was used to frame 
this research, exploring the beliefs of teachers as mediating artefacts in the 
construction of ‘school readiness’, the role of the teacher, and the use of the GLD as 
a measure of ‘school readiness’, positioned as the outcome of the activity system.     
 

 
52
Chapter 3  
Cultural-Historical Activity Theory as a Research 
Framework 
 
As discussed in the previous chapter, contemporary curriculum and assessment policy 
frameworks are positioned as a site of ‘content, coherence, and control’, a way of 
ensuring children achieve ‘educational and school readiness goals’ (Woods & Hedges, 
2016, p.388).  This creates a turbulent dichotomy as the messy and complex nature 
of the classroom, and the unpredictability of working with young children, is set 
against a backdrop of the prescriptive GLD and ‘school readiness’ agenda.   
As I began to consider how ‘school readiness’ is constructed in a Reception classroom 
and explore the concept of teachers’ beliefs and pedagogical practices, I recognised 
that there were multiple forces at play that were influencing, or had the potential to 
influence, these beliefs.  The aim of this chapter is to highlight what these different 
forces and influences are within the classroom, and how teachers have to navigate 
these to achieve an outcome of ‘school readiness’ by the end of Reception.  As a way 
of exploring the interactions between the teacher and the different social and 
collective aspects of pedagogical practice, and the tensions and contradictions that 
emerge between the beliefs of teachers and these practices, Cultural-Historical 
Activity Theory (CHAT) (Engeström, 1999) was used to frame the research.  
Socio-cultural theory and CHAT both arise from the work of Vygotsky and draw on 
ideas around cultural development through ‘physical and psychological mediational 
tools’, with an emphasis on the collective rather than the individual (Ellis et al., 2010, 
p.2).  In a CHAT context, the function of the mediating tool is to ‘serve as the 
conductor of human influence on the object of the activity’, ultimately leading to a 
change in the object (Vygotsky, 1978, p.55).  These tools can either be tangible (a 
pen or whiteboard) or symbolic (concepts or beliefs), shaping the way teachers engage 
in classroom practice and the way they think about the activity (Kay, 2015a).  The 
focus is shifted away from the activity outcome (‘school readiness’), redirecting the 

 
53
gaze to the ‘mediation of the subject’s or participant’s activity by physical or 
psychological tools’ (Ellis, 2010, p.95), in this instance, the teacher’s beliefs about 
‘school readiness’ and pedagogical practices. 
The activity system is a ‘constant mutually shaping dialectic’ (Edwards, 2011) and is 
made up of key components represented in Table 8 (Engeström, 1996, p.67).  Due to 
limitations of word count, the elements of division of labour and community are not 
included in this study but this gives more scope for further research in the future, 
discussed in more detail in Chapter Seven.

interactions with each other, can also be represented diagrammatically (Diagram 3) 
(Engeström, 1987).

As teachers participate in external activity, their experiences are internalised and then 
these internal constructions are used to shape new external activities (Saka et al., 
2009, p.1000).   The benefit of using the CHAT framework is that the researcher is 
able to study ‘the process or activity of engaging with a task rather than the outcome 
or product’ (Ellis, 2010, p.95).  This is useful as it allows the interactions between the 
individual (the teacher) and the wider contextual aspects of an activity to be examined 
(Saka et al., 2009, p.1022).  Furthermore, the framework enables the exploration of 
the ‘multiple influences on teachers’ belief enactment’ (Fives & Beuhl, 2012, p.487), 
the wider context within which the teacher works, and the outcome of these 
enactments.  For the purpose of this research, the framework for the activity system 
(pedagogical practices) becomes the basic unit of analysis and the bi-directional 
relationship between the subject (teacher) and the object (the GLD) will be explored 
through the examination of the rules (policy frameworks) and tools (teachers’ beliefs).

The beliefs of teachers as a mediating tool will be particularly scrutinised to help 
identify any contradictions within the activity system between subject, object and 
outcome (Kay, 2015a), covered in more detail in the Analysis chapter.  According to 
Engeström (2001), contradictions are ‘historically accumulating structural tensions 
within and between activity systems’ whereby the primary contradiction permeates 
all other elements of the activity system.  When a new element is introduced to the 
system secondary contradictions can emerge where the new system collides with the 
old (p.137).  Extending on this, four levels of contradictions are proposed by 
Engeström (1987): 
1) 
Primary inner contradictions that occur within each component of the 
activity system (e.g. within the community)  
2) 
Secondary contradictions that arise between the constituents of the 
activity system (e.g. between the community and the subject) 
3) 
Tertiary contradictions that arise when a new method or technology is 
introduced to help achieve the object  
4) 
Quaternary contradictions that occur between the central activity and 
neighbouring activities (p.104) 
 
Contradictions, however, are not seen as a negative force within the activity system, 
but rather are ‘starting places’ that open up new ways of understanding (Foot, 2014, 
p.17).  Wilson (2014) argues that as contradictions become ‘increasingly disruptive 
and challenging’, participants reflect on the situation and begin to look for solutions.  
Using CHAT as a framework enables contradictions to be identified, and opens up 
possibilities for change and learning as part of the research process (p.23).  This will 
help to identify whether tensions between teachers’ beliefs and pedagogical practices 
allow for transformative agency within the contemporary classroom, explored in more 
depth in Chapter Seven.   
In order to make sense of the dialectical nature of pedagogical practices as an activity 
system, what follows is an in-depth examination of the pertinent elements (subject, 
tools, rules and object) of the framework.   
 

 
57
The Activity System as Pedagogical Practice 
Pedagogy in the English context for Early Years education is defined by the EYFS (DfE, 
2014/2017) and other prominent reviews such as the Effective Provision of Pre-school 
Education (EPPE) (Sylva et al., 2004b) and Researching Effective Pedagogy in the Early 
Years (REPEY) (Siraj-Blatchford et al., 2002) projects.  Commissioned and funded by 
the British government, the EPPE and REPEY studies have been highly influential in 
determining the pedagogical approaches that teachers should use to work towards 
helping children achieve the outcomes and standards specified in the developmental 
framework, discussed later in more depth.  Consideration also needs to be made of 
the way teachers internalise and interpret these standards and the action required to 
facilitate learning and development to ensure the outcomes are met.  From a 
psychological perspective, Lomov (1982) asserts that this process of internalisation 
reflects reality and ensures the regulation of activity, whilst establishing the adequacy 
of the activity to the conditions under which it occurs (p.78).  This is interesting when 
we consider possible conflicts between teacher agency and the constructions of 
‘school readiness’ placed within a pedagogical framework that plans for specific 
outcomes.  Tensions between a play-based pedagogy and the constructs of ‘school 
readiness’ within the Reception classroom will be discussed in more depth in this 
section.     
Pedagogy, Policy Discourse and Readiness 
The government funded Study of Pedagogical Effectiveness in Early Learning (SPEEL) 
(2002) project sought to identify the components of effective pedagogy practiced by 
adults working with young children within the context of the Foundation Stage 
framework (Moyles et al., 2002, p.2).  This report defines pedagogy as being ‘the 
behaviour of teaching’, encompassing the thoughts and actions of the teacher, and 
operating a ‘shared frame of reference between the practitioner, the young child, and 
his/her family’ (p.5).  Alexander (2008) expands on this definition of pedagogy to 
include the ‘theories, beliefs, policies and controversies’ that inform and shape 
teaching practice (p.3). 

 
58
According to Neaum (2016) there are two competing policy discourses prevalent in the 
debate around ‘school readiness’ and pedagogy.  As discussed in the policy analysis 
in Chapter Two, there is the ‘dominant’ discourse which is embedded within the 
market driven ideology of neoliberalism, aligning with an ‘instrumental view of early 
years as a place to ready children for schooling’.  Conversely, the ‘alternative’ 
discourse positions the child as taking an ‘active role in the construction and 
acquisition of learning and understanding’ that Neaum argues ‘underpins philosophy 
and practice’ in England (p.244).  This is reminiscent of Bernstein’s (2000) framework 
which differentiates between the two discourse positions and the contrasting 
pedagogical practices and contexts: the performance model and the competence 
model (p.44).  Within the performance model, the teacher, through a ‘visible 
pedagogy’, explicitly regulates the framing of subjects, skills and procedures that are 
taught, and the performance of the learner is graded and compared.  The 
competence model is a more informal approach where the teacher responds to 
children’s individual needs through an ‘invisible pedagogy’ with latent or unfocused 
learning outcomes (Bernstein, 2000).  Bernstein (1975) defines the basic difference 
between visible and invisible pedagogies as being ‘the manner in which the criteria 
are transmitted and in the degree of specificity of the criteria’.  An invisible pedagogy 
adopts an indirect method of transmission and criteria that is fluid and diffused, 
whereas a visible pedagogy has specific criteria and an explicit manner of transmission 
(p.9).  
It can be argued that the ‘school readiness’ agenda in the Early Years is positioned at 
the junction of these conflicting discourses, and the different pedagogical expectations 
result in tensions and contradictions when transformed into classroom practice 
(Neaum, 2016, p.247).  Roberts-Holmes (2012) affirms that Reception classes are the 
site of ‘two competing discourses and ideologies’ whereby policymakers are 
concerned with improving standards through more formal methods, and the ‘distinct 
pedagogy’ of Early Years education (p.40).  However, Wall et al. (2015) highlight how, 
in England, pedagogy in the Early Years is not explicitly defined by policymakers, but is 
guided towards being ‘child-centred with a mix of pedagogical practices’ where adults 
support children in mastering tasks or concepts (p.7).  Within the current context of 

 
59
the EYFS, approaches to teaching sit on a ‘continuum’ rather than adhere to the 
dichotomy of two explicit pedagogies.  Teachers decide how ‘formal or informal, 
structured or unstructured, dependent or independent’ learning should be based on 
the individual needs of the child at that particular point in time (OfSTED, 2015a, p.5).   
The EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) defines the rules of the activity system (pedagogical 
practices), and cultivates certain contradictions by specifying particular objectives that 
align with the performance model, whilst maintaining that children should be treated 
as individuals with different needs and abilities, which fits within a competence model.  
This is exemplified where it is asserted within the EYFS framework that teachers should 
‘shape activities and experiences (educational programmes) for children in all early 
years settings’ and also that children need to work towards the ELGs that prescribe the 
‘knowledge, skills and understanding’ required by the end of Reception (p.5).  
Assessments are made in the form of the Foundation Stage Profile which provides 
relevant parties with information regarding a child’s ‘progress against expected levels, 
and their readiness for Year 1’ (p.14).  This data is then reported to the Local 
Education Authority (LEA) and the Government, and comparisons are made between 
schools with regard to the number of children who have reached the GLD and are 
considered to be ‘school ready’.  Hence, the centralisation of control over what is 
taught and the accountability agenda initiated in discourses of assessment positions 
the EYFS within the framework of a performance model (Rogers & Lapping, 2012, 
p.247).  Alternatively, the EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) also presents elements of a 
competence pedagogic model, where it is stated that ‘Practitioners must consider the 
individual needs, interests, and stage of development of each child in their care, and 
must use this information to plan a challenging and enjoyable experience for each 
child in all of the areas of learning and development’ (p.8).  These contradictions 
create a ‘pedagogic schizoid position’ (Bernstein, 2000, p.71) for teachers as they 
wrestle with the expectations of reacting to children’s individual needs, interests and 
abilities, whilst simultaneously meeting the policy demands of a ‘school readiness’ 
agenda.  Using CHAT as a theoretical framework has helped to identify possible 
tensions and contradictions between teachers’ beliefs and pedagogical practice, and 
notions of ‘school readiness’ within the classroom.  

 
60
Whilst government ECE policy in England does not adhere to one particular 
pedagogical approach, there is an emphasis on ‘sustained shared thinking’ and 
scaffolding, and a play-based approach to learning (Wall et al., 2015) drawn from 
findings of the EPPE and REPEY projects.  The progressive and traditional notion of 
play as innocent and instinctual, viewed as a way of underpinning attitudes to learning, 
communication skills and natural creativity, aligns well with Bernstein’s idea of the 
‘invisible pedagogy’ (Stirrup et al., 2016, p.2).  However, over the course of the last 
twenty years, Government policy has re-contextualised play as a vehicle for achieving 
fixed learning outcomes and preparation for school.  Rogers and Lapping (2012) 
support this view, arguing recent policy discourses that instantiate pedagogies of play 
‘constitute a similar, physically loaded, disaggregation and reconstitution of the 
elements of both invisible pedagogies and competence models, repositioning them as 
traces within the more ‘visible’ practices of performance pedagogies’ (p.247).  
Aligning pedagogical practices as the activity system within the CHAT framework has 
enabled the exploration of the complexities of Early Years pedagogy, and the 
problematic nature of play when positioned within policy discourses.       
What follows is further exploration of how national policy directives for pedagogy and 
the re-contextualisation of play contributes to notions of the EYFS as a site for ‘school 
readiness’.  As a way of framing this discussion a visual map (Diagram 5) has been 
constructed to highlight how the government funded EPPE (Sylva et al., 2004b) and 
REPEY (Siraj-Blatchford et al., 2002) projects have influenced the EYFS.  The EPPE 
project was a major longitudinal study in England and Northern Ireland, exploring 
young children’s development between the ages of three and seven.  REPEY drew 
upon findings of the EPPE project to ‘identify the pedagogical strategies which in the 
Foundation Stage support the development of the skills, knowledge and attitudes that 
enable children to make a good start at school’ (p.16).  This statement is important 
as it clearly highlights the dominant aim of these studies, to identify the most effective 
way of achieving the outcomes set by the government identified as supporting a child’s 
‘school readiness’.

Diagram 5 – The influence of EPPE and REPEY on the EYFS 
 
A key theme emerging from both the EPPE and REPEY projects is that ‘excellent and 
effective’ practice is defined through teaching and learning strategies that support 
cognitive and social development, siting the Early Years as an ‘instructive play 
environment’.  The role of the adult is prominent in supporting children’s learning 
and development through the planning of purposeful play, adult-led and child-initiated 
activities, ‘sustained shared thinking’, and observing and responding to children’s 
individual needs and interests.  The teacher is positioned as a pro-active participant 
in the planning, managing, and assessing of a play-based learning environment, 
resulting in play being moulded into a vehicle for evidencing outcomes and 
contributing to children’s progress (Wood, 2009, p.168).  The next section will 
explore in more depth discourses around quality and effectiveness and the re-
contextualisation of play as a vehicle for learning within a culture of performativity and 
accountability. 

 
62
Quality and Effectiveness 
The Sustainable Development Goals published by the United Nations (2015) specifies 
that by 2030 its goal will be to ‘ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality 
early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready 
for primary education’.  However, it is pertinent here to interrogate how ‘quality’ 
and ‘effectiveness’ are presented in political and educational discourse as something 
Evans (2016) describes as a ‘particular form of logic’ (p.65).  The World Bank and the 
OECD have gone some way in defining this ‘form of logic’ as a market technology 
focusing on managerialism and performativity through the use of targets and 
performance indicators, and the comparison of educational outcomes (Paananen et 
al., 2015, p.692).  Ball (2003) argues that the ‘measures of productivity or output’ 
encapsulate the ‘quality or value of an individual or organisation’, but it is the ‘issue 
of who controls the field of judgement’ that is central to political discourse (p.216).   
Policymakers who prioritise funding and accountability have dominated the 
international focus on quality in education over practice and, as a consequence, 
quality has been conceived ‘not as what it actually is but as how it can be measured’ 
(Alexander, 2008, p.3).  Furthermore, Paananen et al. (2015) argue that the models 
used to measure quality draw heavily on children’s outcomes and fail to acknowledge 
multiple perspectives (p.690).  Evans (2016) asserts that ‘quality’ and dominant 
concepts of ‘readiness’ interact through ‘predictable and deterministic relations’ and 
the use of ‘technical and mechanistic vocabulary’ such as ‘standardization’, 
‘performance’, ‘targets’ and ‘outcomes’ (p.66).  The Starting Strong IV (OECD, 2015) 
report warns that the measurement of child outcomes to determine ‘school readiness’ 
is an act of “schoolification” which may result in the focus shifting away from the 
participation of the child and specific pedagogical approaches traditionally suited to 
young children (p.169).   
The Improving School Readiness: Creating a better start for London (Public Health 
England, 2015) publication states that ‘High-quality early years education significantly 
improves child health and educational outcomes’ and has an impact on ‘school 
readiness’, ‘future academic attainment’ and ‘future productivity’ (p.20).  Here 

 
63
‘quality’ is presented within a ‘narrative of investment’ (Paananen et al., 2015) and 
the financial returns that can be gained are identified as the basis of this framework.  
Moss (2014) argues that in this context, quality describes ‘assemblages of ‘human 
technologies’ believed to ensure delivery of predetermined outcomes’, and a ‘promise 
of achieving conformity to desired norms’ (p.22).  An ‘outcome-driven approach’ 
considers activities that have a long-term pay off as being more important than 
activities that may seem ‘frivolous or pointless’ because they are not linked with later 
life success (Dahlberg et al., 1999, p.53).  This is highlighted in the EPPE report where 
it is specified that a key indicator of quality is how ‘effective pedagogy in the early 
years involves both the kind of interaction traditionally associated with the term 
“teaching”, and also the provision of instructive learning play environments and 
routines’ (Sylva et al., 2004b, p.38).   
EPPE and REPEY demonstrate a clear alignment between ‘quality and effectiveness’ 
and the neoliberal ideologies of New Labour and subsequent governments, and they 
continue to have a pervasive influence on ECE policy.  The current OfSTED Early Years 
Inspection Handbook (2015b) re-enforces the discourse by presenting the outstanding 
grade descriptor for the effectiveness of leadership and management as being the 
‘Leader’s deep understanding of the curriculum and how to apply it to meet the needs 
and interests of children results in all staff planning highly effective activities’, with the 
aim of ensuring ‘children are exceptionally well prepared to move on, including, where 
appropriate, to school’ (p.33).  ‘Highly effective activities’ are framed here as a way 
of ensuring ‘school readiness’, and when this is aligned with the outcome-driven 
agenda of the prescribed EYFS curriculum, it raises questions as to how this impacts 
on the traditional notion of play within the Early Years classroom.  It is therefore 
argued that neoliberalism and the global race towards a 'world-class' education 
system, and a future functioning workforce has repositioned Reception as the 'school 
readiness' year rather than the transitional year into school.   The drive to improve 
educational outcomes and give children a head start into the academic requirements 
of Year One has taken precedence over traditional approaches to ECE, and these 
tensions will be explored as part of this thesis.  The next section will explore in more 

 
64
depth the re-contextualisation of play as a vehicle for learning within a culture of 
performativity and accountability. 
Play as a Vehicle for Learning 
Although play is endorsed by those working in the Early Years and is taken seriously by 
the academic community, the relationship between ‘playing, learning and teaching’ 
continues to be the subject of ongoing debate (Wood & Attfield, 2005, p.1).  Play in 
the Early Years is often treated as a ‘hallowed concept’ (Pellegrini & Boyd, 1993, p.105) 
and presented as a romantic and nostalgic activity ideally suited to the ‘innocence of 
childhood’ (Ailwood, 2003, p.287).  Alongside this ideology is the tradition that the 
child is placed at the centre of the learning process where there is ‘no distinction 
between work and play’ and teachers respond to children's ‘needs, interests, and 
patterns of learning that emerged during play and other child-initiated activities’ 
(Wood, 2007, p.121).  Furthermore, within a play-based classroom context, the focus 
is on activities rather than ‘knowledge, skills, understanding, dispositions, and 
outcomes’ (p.123).  This is in direct contrast to assertions made in the Effective 
Primary Teaching Report (Teaching Schools Council, 2016) which states the starting 
point for planning in Reception should be ‘with the learning outcome in mind, rather 
than the activity’ (p.37). 
Based on research findings, the EPPE report states ‘in the most effective centres, ‘play’ 
environments were used to provide the basis of instructive learning’ and that ‘the 
most effective pedagogy is both ‘teaching’ and providing freely chosen yet potentially 
instructive play activities’ (Sylva et al., 2004c, p.vi).  Here we can see how play has 
been re-contextualised, shifting away from the United Nations Committee on the 
Rights of the Child (2013) definition of play as ‘non-compulsory, driven by intrinsic 
motivation and undertaken for its own sake, rather than as a means to an end’ (p.5), 
instead becoming a way in which the teacher monitors children.  The purpose of play 
as a medium for assessing whether children have met the learning outcomes that are 
specified in a pre-defined curriculum becomes privileged over the intrinsically 
motivated activity of the child.  The idea of play for a purpose is re-enforced in the 
OfSTED (2015a) report Teaching and play in the early years – a balancing act? where 

 
65
it is stated ‘If those in the early years sector continue to see teaching and play as 
separate, disconnected endeavours our future generations will continue to fall at the 
first hurdle’ (p.5).  This discourse highlights the pressures that teachers are placed 
under to ensure that ‘play’ is used as a medium for teaching, and that a failure to 
implement this notion will have an impact on children’s learning, particularly those 
from a disadvantaged background.  
Brooker (2011) asserts that ‘The principle of ‘learning through play’ is now enshrined 
in the curriculum guidance of all parts of the UK’ (p.6) and this can be seen clearly in 
the EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) which specifies that ‘Each area of learning and development 
must be implemented through planned, purposeful play and through a mix of adult-
led and child-initiated activity’ (p.9).  As play becomes ‘purposeful’ within a 
neoliberal ‘discourse of accountability’ and a framework of performativity, it is used as 
a way of identifying ‘received absences in the child’s practices’ defined by an 
‘externally regulated curriculum’ (Rogers & Lapping, 2012, p.249).  Stirrup et al. 
(2016) argue that this re-contexualisation of play as being purposeful neatly endorses 
the ‘school readiness’ trope that dominates policy pronouncements (p.2).  Robertson 
and Hill (2014) go so far as to suggest that play has been ‘appropriated or repossessed, 
or even stolen’ when aligned with the ‘achievement agenda’ that places early reading 
and phonics at the forefront of the curriculum (p.168).      
Rogers (2011) describes this as the pedagogisation of play which has seen play become 
an ‘instrument for learning future competencies’ rather than as being something 
‘transformative, mimetic and life-enhancing’ (p.5).  Rogers and Lapping (2012) argue 
that 'pedagogies of play' can be understood as a way of taming the 'potentially 
incoherent, disordered and disruptive aspects of children's activity' and the ways in 
which pedagogies of play are articulated in policy is a way of sustaining 'an illusion of 
coherence, order and control' (p.258).  Play is positioned in policy as being a vehicle 
for learning specific outcomes underpinned by a ‘school readiness’ agenda.  These 
outcomes then form the basis of data reported to the Government and are moderated 
by the LEA in order to verify teacher assessments of children’s attainment at the end 
of Reception.  Roberts-Holmes (2015a) argues that this data has itself ‘come to partly 
represent the teacher’s pedagogical focus’ and, despite attempts to maintain a ‘child-

 
66
centred philosophy’, teachers are increasingly coming to accept that their pedagogy is 
‘data-driven’ (p.307).  Identifying children’s progress through checklists and 
curriculum performance is described by Wood (2014) as a ‘technicist assessment 
practice’ in which ‘the complexities of play are lost’, but by adhering to this practice 
teachers are able to align their pedagogy with discourses of effectiveness and 
performativity measures (p.153).   
With this in mind, I argue that two distinct drivers influence the ‘purposeful play’ 
pedagogy and the shift to formal learning in Reception.  Firstly, there is the 
requirement that children reach the GLD including the instrumental outcomes 
specified in Mathematics and Literacy that may be achieved more easily through these 
practices, and secondly, to prepare children for the more formal pedagogical approach 
that is adopted in a Year One classroom.  At the time of writing, the Effective Primary 
Teaching Report (Teaching Schools Council, 2016) was published highlighting how the 
most ‘effective’ schools supported transition into Year One by introducing Year One 
approaches into Reception, and that the Reception layout ‘evolved gradually’ to 
support successful transition (p.38).  However, this report is also deeply entrenched 
within a restrictive agenda of effectiveness, drawing on a narrow and limited range of 
evidence.  The suggestion that Year One methods should be implemented into a 
Reception classroom epitomises the ‘top down’ approach that numerous policy 
documents seek to clarify is not desirable (Alexander, 2010; OECD, 2015; OfSTED, 
2015a).  A key question emerges here as to whether there is room for teacher agency 
within this framework, when pedagogical practices are underpinned by what Dahlberg 
and Moss (2005) refer to as a ‘totalising discourse’, used as a way of forcing ‘everything 
and everyone into the same way of thinking and acting’ (p.142).  The next section will 
explore the role of rules within the activity system and how policy, as laid out in 
Chapter Two, contributes to a framework of accountability and performativity.   
The Role of Rules within the Activity System 
Within the activity system, rules mediate what the subject does in relation to the 
object of the activity and are usually embedded in well-established patterns of 
behaviour that reflect ‘professional and cultural norms’ (Foot, 2014, p.332).  

 
67
Engeström (1993) states that ‘rules refer to the explicit and implicit regulations, norms 
and conventions that constrain actions and interactions within the activity system’ and 
that human beings not only obey rules, but ‘mould and reformulate them’ (p.67).  As 
part of this study, it is argued that the Early Years curriculum and the corresponding 
assessment policy systems are key regulators of interactions (rules) between the 
teacher and the child within the activity system.  The policy analysis in the previous 
chapter explores in depth how ‘school readiness’ is constructed within the EYFS and 
how the GLD is used as a way of measuring a child’s ‘school readiness’.  Using CHAT 
as a research framework has helped to identify tensions between the policy logic 
around constructs of ‘school readiness’ as laid out in curricular and assessment 
frameworks, and the complexities and diversity of classroom practice.   
Smith et al. (2016) state that curricular and assessment policy frameworks ‘govern and 
control how early childhood educators see and assess children and in turn develop and 
implement pedagogy’ (p.123).  The Statutory framework for the Early Years 
Foundation Stage (DfE, 2014/2017) states that it seeks to provide ‘a secure foundation 
through learning and development opportunities which are planned around the needs 
and interests of each individual child and are assessed and reviewed regularly’ (p.5).  
However, Wood and Hedges (2016) suggest that there are tensions between the goals 
that are specified in curricular policy frameworks that children need to meet by the 
end of Reception and children’s freely chosen activities based on their own interests 
(p.393).  Based on their research findings exploring children’s play experiences in 
reception, Moyles and Worthington (2011) argue that it is the ‘prescribed curriculum’ 
driving planning and practice (p.3).  This highlights how, even within curricular policy 
frameworks, there are contradictions regarding ‘good practice’ and the expectations 
placed on teachers in the Early Years classroom. 
In Chapter Two, neoliberalism was identified as a key theme in ECE policy, and 
Robertson (2007) argues that neoliberalism has ‘transformed’ what we do as teachers 
and learners (p.3), through a number of key principles being deployed which:  
… changed the mandate (what it is that the education system should do), 
forms of capacity (the means through which the mandate can be realised 

 
68
e.g. fiscal and human resources) and mechanisms of governance of the 
education sect or (that is, the means for coordinating the system) (p.11). 
Discussed in more depth in the following section, neoliberalism is seen to be a key 
influence on the policy frameworks (rules) of this activity system as teachers work 
within the ’prescribed’ systems that are driven by global and economic 
competitiveness, and navigate the constraints and expectations placed on their 
pedagogical practices.   
Neoliberalism and the Political Climate  
Underpinning neoliberal policy is the idea that children are seen as human capital, 
with the expectation that they generate a financial return to society when they reach 
adulthood (Apple, 1998, p.183).  Within an educational context, neoliberalism is 
characterised as being a mix of markets, competition and individual choice in provision 
of services and the allocation of children to them, and an increasingly authoritarian 
system of governmentality achieved through prescriptive standards and high stakes 
testing (Moss, 2014, p.69).  The market driven ideology of neoliberalism reduces 
everything to money, management and technical practice, and is at odds with 
democratic practice that embraces diversity, critical thinking, curiosity and the 
recognition of multiple perspectives (Moss, 2007).   
The New Labour government (1997-2010) placed a ‘raising standards’ agenda at the 
forefront of educational policy and reform, with the desired outcome that every child 
is given the opportunity to reach their full potential.  This ‘standards’ discourse went 
hand in hand with the emergence of an accountability framework that saw teachers 
and schools being subjected to further performativity pressures with the introduction 
of OfSTED inspections and league tables.  Ball (2003) defines performativity as ‘a 
technology, a culture and a mode of regulation that employs judgements, comparisons 
and displays as means of incentive, control, attrition and change based on rewards and 
sanctions (both material and symbolic)’ (p.216).  Within an English educational 
context, this means achieving a favourable grading from the government inspection 
service, OfSTED, and accomplishing good national test and assessment results in order 
to secure a high position in school league tables becoming more attractive to parents 

 
69
and students in the educational marketplace (Jeffrey, 2002, p.3).  Early Years teachers 
are not immune from this neoliberal framework of performativity and are equally as 
accountable as their primary and secondary colleagues, having to work with 
attainment targets, a prescribed and compulsory Early Years curriculum, and a 
standardised approach to classroom practice (Osgood, 2006a, p.188).  This takes the 
form of the outcomes-driven EYFS curricular framework, and the current summative 
assessment procedure of the EYFSP, the results of which are reported to the 
Government.  
Osgood (2006b) states that in the current Early Years climate, teachers have to 
navigate 'demands for accountability, performativity and standardised approaches to 
their practice' arguing that this is a 'pronounced movement towards centralised 
control and prescription' (p.6).  This has led to what Wood (2004) refers to as a 
‘paradigm war’, where tensions and dilemmas are created for teachers as they ‘strive 
to reconcile their professional knowledge with increasingly prescriptive frameworks’ 
(p.361).  Ball (2003) argues that teachers sacrifice their own judgements and beliefs 
for measurable outputs and performances, labelling this as a form of ‘values 
schizophrenia’ (p.222).  A culture of performativity not only makes teachers visibly 
accountable, but can ‘carefully construct and steer teaching practice in implicit and 
particular ways’ (Kilderry, 2015, p.635).  Rather than using their own professional 
judgment, practitioners comply with the demands of performativity, producing what 
Osgood (2006a) refers to as ‘a form of ventriloquism’ (p.192).   
Using CHAT has helped to identify what the specific tensions and dilemmas are, and 
whether teachers are having to sacrifice their beliefs over the performance data that 
is required at the end of Reception.  By questioning whether the teachers’ 
responsibilities centre on the child and their individual needs, or the adherence to the 
wider political agenda of ensuring children reach certain defined ‘goals’, a ‘situation of 
conflicting motives’ may surface (van Oers, 2015, p.20).  This highlights the potential 
for the emergence of further contradictions when we consider the idea of 
transformative agency within the activity system, discussed in more depth in the next 
section, when teachers are ‘ruled’ by particular curricular and assessment controls.  
Further problems arise when, as an extension of their own agency, teachers consider 

 
70
the agency of the children they are teaching, recognising them as ‘autonomous human 
beings’ (Campbell, 2012, p.184).  In this instance, it can be questioned whether it is 
the child or the system that comes first when pedagogy and practice is ruled by 
curricular and assessment policy frameworks.  
The Role of the Subject in CHAT 
Within the activity system, the subject is the person, or group of people, whose 
perspective is the ‘focus of analysis’ (Wilson, 2014, p.22).  For the purpose of this 
study, two Reception teachers are positioned as the subject within the CHAT 
framework, and their perspectives were explored in order to gain an understanding 
as to how ‘school readiness’ is constructed within the classroom.  The notion of self 
is presented within the social sciences as being individualistic and autonomous with 
unique history and experiences, but Stetsenko and Arievitch (2004) highlight the 
paradox between this concept and the importance that social contexts and social 
interactions have in shaping the individual (p.477).  Engeström (1999) contends that 
from a traditional social science perspective the individual may be considered as an 
acting participator who learns and develops, but whose actions do not have any 
impact on surrounding structures.  This becomes problematic when trying to 
understand ‘deep social transformations’, making the need for an approach that can 
‘dialectically link the individual and the social structure’ (p.19).   
Stetsenko (2013) asserts that by the very virtue of being human, subjects ‘always act 
and know in ways that are meaningful and that matter within their evolving life 
agendas and visions for the future tied up with the social dynamics and politics of our 
communities’ (p.21).  The process of teaching, including how teachers manage the 
challenges and conflicts they face on a day to day basis, builds on how sociocultural 
rules and standards are internalised and interpreted by the individual (Stetsenko & 
Arievitch, 2004, p.494).  Teaching takes place within a complex and dynamic 
environment, and this process is what Vygotsky termed internalisation and 
externalisation.  The teacher consumes what is happening around them and 
interprets it accordingly (internalisation), then takes this internalisation and acts on it 
in ‘newly informed ways’ (externalisation) (Douglas, 2010, p.42).  The use of CHAT as 

 
71
a research framework offers the examination of teacher activity as a ‘non-reductionist 
and ontological vision of human nature and development’ embedded in social 
practices, interactions and human subjectivity (Stetsenko & Arievitch, 2004, p.476).  
Subjectivity   
Stetsensko (2013) defines subjectivity as being ‘inherently collaborative processes of 
individuals acting as social subjects’, alongside the principle that these social subjects 
are also ‘members of community practices and agents of communal history who enact 
collectivities by changing them through their own, individually unique contributions 
instantiated in each and every act of knowing, being, and doing’ (p.9).  This viewpoint 
is in contrast to that of Leontiev (1978) writing in Activity, Consciousness and 
Personality, who states that ‘society produces the activity of the individuals forming 
it’ (p.85).  Stetsensko (2005) argues that this perspective appears to place society 
above the individual, subordinate to, and folded by society (p.78).  Edwards (2005) 
concurs with this view and asserts that ‘CHAT has not dealt easily with the idea of the 
active agent’ (p.180).  It is therefore pertinent to address this ‘unresolved issue’ 
when using CHAT, and work towards reconciling the view that ‘individual subjectivity 
and agency make the very process of human development and social life possible’ 
(Stetsenko, 2005, p.71).  Through the exploration of individual perspectives and 
beliefs around ideas of ‘school readiness’, teacher agency will be examined in more 
depth positioning the subject as an integral part of the activity system.  CHAT 
provides a way of navigating the complex framework within which the teachers are 
situated, and the impact that mediating tools and rules may have on teacher agency 
when the outcome of the activity is to ensure children reach the GLD as a measure of 
‘school readiness’ at the end of Reception.  
Teacher Identity 
The professional status of a teacher is shaped by the decision-making process 
undertaken every day in the classroom, situated amidst a ‘system of values and norms 
of a cultural educational system’ (Shepel, 1995, p.439).  Coffman (2015) argues that 
today’s teachers must have the ‘knowledge, skills, and ability’ to critically reflect on 

 
72
the teaching and learning policies placed within this cultural system (p.323).  As 
teachers construct an understanding of themselves as professionals within a school 
context they act on what they believe aligns with that construction, and then these 
actions feed back into the ongoing construction of teacher identity (Buchanan, 2015, 
p.704).  From a cultural-historical perspective, the teacher, as an active participant 
in the classroom, produces outcomes as part of his or her role, but as part of the same 
process ‘produces and reproduces him- or herself’ as a member of the school 
community and therefore ‘produces and reproduces the very structure of the 
community, of which the individual is a constitutive part’ (Roth, 2004, p.4).   The 
actions of teachers feed into the classroom and then back into their own identity, and 
Buchanan (2015) argues that if those actions are constrained by ‘accountability 
policies’, there is potential that identities will be shifted and this should be 
acknowledged by policy-makers (p.714).  Furthermore, acting on professional 
principles rather than adhering to state-controlled educational policies, and showing 
resistance to these overwhelming political forces can leave teachers vulnerable in 
terms of performance management and job security (Achinstein & Ogawa, 2009).  
Transformative Agency 
Stetsenko (2005) has focused much of her work on the ‘dichotomy of individual and 
collective planes of activity’, and she acknowledges that the ‘self’ within the activity 
system is ‘highly dependent on the existing array and accessibility of cultural resources 
as well as highly susceptible to issues of power and contestation’ (p.494).  As will be 
discussed later, possible conflicts between the beliefs of teachers about how young 
children should be educated and the policy frameworks within which they operate 
have the potential to cause serious dilemmas.  Edwards (2005) suggests that these 
‘paradoxical tensions’ put strains on the ‘sense of self’, arguing that ‘strong forms of 
agency’ help teachers find ‘moments of stability’ as they move in and out of different 
contexts (p.169).  
Within a CHAT framework, Virkkunen (2006) theorises that individual agency can be 
understood as the departure from a ‘given frame of action’ and the ability to 
transform it (p.43).  Stemming from the examination of ‘disturbances, conflicts and 

 
73
contradictions in the collective activity’, transformative agency empowers the 
teachers’ activity through the exploration of new possibilities for ‘collective change 
efforts’ (Haapasaari et al., 2016, p.233) and the development of local activity and work 
practices (Haapasaari & Kerosuo, 2015, p.37).  Key to this theory is Vygotsky’s 
principle of ‘double stimulation’ (Vygotsky, 1978) which helps to explain how agency 
emerges when a ‘second stimulus’ is constructed by the teacher in response to a 
‘problem involving a conflict of motives’ (Barma et al., 2014, p.30).  The first stimulus 
is triggered by a ‘problematic situation’ and causes the participant to mobilise a 
second stimulus, a ‘stimuli-means’, utilising cultural artefacts that are available as 
tools to assist the performance of the subject and to mediate what is culturally 
significant (Edwards, 2007a, p.87).  Sannino (2011) describes the principle of ‘double 
stimulation’ as being ‘the mechanism with which human beings can intentionally 
break out of a conflicting situation and change their circumstances or solve difficult 
problems’ (p.584).  In this context, transformative agency becomes apparent when 
teachers evaluate the situation within the activity system and then, based on their 
interpretation of the circumstances, make decisions which are then acted upon 
(Sannino, 2015, p.2).  Vygotsky (1997) asserts that the participant ‘changes the 
environment with the external activity and in this way affects his own behavior, 
subjecting it to his own authority’ (p.212).  
Engeström et al. (2014) frame the ‘consequential change actions’ of transformative 
agency as: 
1) 
Resisting the proposed change, or suggestions or initiatives associated 
with it. 
2) 
Criticizing the current activity and organization. 
3) 
Explicating new possibilities or potentials in the activity, often relating 
to past positive experiences. 
4) 
Envisioning new patterns or models for the activity. 
5) 
Committing to taking concrete actions to change the activity, often 
formulated as commissive speech acts tied to specific time and place. 
6) 
Taking consequential actions or reporting having taken consequential 
actions to change the activity (p.125) 
 
This provides a useful framework in which to explore teacher agency within the 
current educational climate of performativity and accountability, and the requirement 

 
74
to ensure children are ‘school ready’ before they enter Year One.  A key question is 
whether teachers are able to mobilise the ‘stimuli-means’, utilising objects from their 
environment and adapting them according to their own needs and individual 
pedagogical convictions.  The mobilisation of this second stimulus can then become 
a vehicle for transformative action that helps to enable meaningful learning in the 
classroom, whilst still maintaining compliance with societal demands (van Oers, 2015, 
p.21).  Furthermore, questions arise as to whether practice has become an exercise 
in ‘following the rules’ laid out in policy and procedures, or if teachers are able to act 
in a way that is ‘morally-committed, and oriented and informed by tradition’ (Kemmis 
& Smith, 2008, p.5).  The ‘dialectical logic’ that is embodied in CHAT sees these 
contradictions as ‘potential growth points that allow the system to improve while 
affording the making and remaking of the participants and their identities’ (Roth et 
al., 2004, p.51).   Roth and Lee (2007) argue that CHAT has always been ‘a theory 
grounded in and emerging from praxis so that it aspires to be a theory for praxis’ 
(p.206).  As a way of exploring in more depth the distinction between being an agent 
and being an operative, the role of praxis in educational practice will be discussed 
further in the next section.    
Praxis 
Freire (2000) defines praxis as being the ‘reflection and action upon the world to 
transform it’ (p.51).  Reflection is seen as a tool that is fundamental to the activity 
that unfolds within the system, and how teachers use this reflection must be 
understood.  Reflecting on practice is an important part of developing professional 
and pedagogical knowledge, and building on understandings about teaching (Miller, 
2008, p.260).  Hoffman-Kipp et al. (2003) argue that the notion of reflection is a 
‘metacognitive mechanism’ used by teachers as a way of regulating their practice 
before, during and after teaching (p.251).  However, Lektrosky (2009) warns that 
reflection as an act of individual consciousness does not necessarily change its object 
(p.86).   
Stetsenko (2013) considers this thinking in her own work, stating that ‘human 
subjectivity’ cannot be reduced to being merely a reflection of the world, arguing that 

 
75
critical reflection is only possible ‘within a changing trajectory of engaging with the 
world as a social actor’ (p.22).  Rather than being positioned as a passive 
accommodation and acceptance of the status quo, critical reflection is seen as a form 
of ‘transformative activity’ that enacts ‘new activity paths’ in order to move beyond 
the status quo (Stetsenko, 2017, p.227).  Therefore, human practice and the 
subjectivity of reflection appear as ‘co-evolving and existing’ processes through the 
constant re-enactments of active transformations of the world (Stetensko, 2005, p.83).  
Within the context of pedagogical practices, it is presupposed that the teacher has a 
clear vision of the goal of the activity system, and as an agent of ‘learning-professional 
activity’ is able to plan, design and reflect on pedagogical actions (Shepel, 1995, 
p.435).  The idea of this ‘transactional relationship’ between subject and object 
highlights how, as the teacher works to help children achieve the GLD using 
pedagogical practices, the process of teaching and learning feeds back into the 
subjectivity of the teacher, and impacts on how the object of the activity is then 
approached in the future (Edwards, 2007b, p.7).  The ‘changing of circumstances and 
of human activity’ characterises praxis as ‘revolutionary practice’, a central concept in 
Marxist theory (Bernstein, 1999, p.12). 
Kemmis and Smith (2008) state that praxis is an action that is ‘oriented and informed 
by traditions’, where people make considerations about what their action will mean 
in the world (p.4).  However, Roth et al. (2004) argue that whilst praxis enables 
human beings to create and control their lives, their activity is often constrained by 
‘objectively experienced material and social conditions’ (p.51).  Educational practice 
is not always guided by educational theories, but can be governed by other theories, 
such as psychological and sociological theories, and state and institutional policies and 
procedures. It is argued that when curriculum, pedagogies and assessment policies 
are driven by the state, professional judgement and teacher praxis could be 
endangered.  Furthermore, when educational practice is conducted in a way that 
excludes the needs of the child, the teacher and the community, the teacher becomes 
an ‘operative’ of these decisions not an ‘agent’ (Kemmis & Smith, 2008, p.6).  When 
we place this in the context of the ‘school readiness’ agenda, teachers are expected 
to operate within an outcome-driven framework that measures and monitors 

 
76
children’s achievements.  Furthermore, pedagogy and ‘effective practice’ is defined 
within the EYFS and monitored through the OfSTED inspection process and the 
evaluation of attainment data by schools and the LEA.  However, within the CHAT 
framework, the teacher is positioned as an integral part of the activity system with 
individual perspectives and beliefs about ‘school readiness’, and how young children 
should be taught.  Roth and Lee (2007) argue that by examining these contradictions 
we can ‘gain insights into how larger socio-political and economic struggles mediate 
local practices, subjectivities, and therefore learning among children’ (p.204). 
This overall discussion has highlighted the possibility of tensions arising between 
teacher agency within the activity system and the politically driven ‘school readiness’ 
agenda.  The activity system is goal-oriented and purposeful, and in light of this we 
must consider how teachers as the subject construct ‘school readiness’ within a 
Reception classroom context, and what structural forces are driving this construct.  
Osgood (2006b) highlights how she has identified a ‘passive resistance’ against the 
‘masculinist neoliberal policy reforms’ amongst Early Years teachers and practitioners 
but also points out that there are feelings of ‘powerlessness and fatalistic resignation’ 
(p.7).  Therefore, it must also be questioned as to whether the forces driving ‘school 
readiness’ allow for transformative agency, demand compliance, or whether they 
acquiesce elements of both.     
The Role of Tools as Mediating Artefacts within the Activity System 
Foot (2014) asserts that in every activity system, actors use existing tools and cultural-
historical resources in order to create new tools with which to ‘engage, enact and 
pursue the object of their activity’ (p.336).  Tools can be physical, for instance a 
classroom whiteboard or a pen and paper, or conceptual, such as beliefs and ideas, 
and the activity both mediates, and is mediated by, these tools and the social context 
of the activity (Hasan & Kazlauskas, 2014, p.10).  The tools that mediate the 
relationship between the subject (the teacher) and the object of the activity (the GLD) 
have been defined in this research framework as being the beliefs of the teachers.     

 
77
From a Vygotskian perspective, mediation is a ‘crucial means of thinking of the 
individual as socially, materially and historically situated, yet agentive’ (Sawchuk, 2006, 
p.613).  However, Kuutti (1996) highlights the tensions that arise, arguing how the 
mediating role of the tool in an activity system is seen to be both ‘enabling and 
limiting’, on the one hand empowering the subject in the transformation process, but 
also restricting the interaction to be ‘from the perspective of that particular tool or 
instrument only’ whilst other potentials remain invisible (p.27).   
Teacher Beliefs as a Mediating Tool 
It is asserted that ‘Teachers hold complex and multifaceted beliefs about a wide range 
of people and structures’ and therefore it is important for researchers to clarify ‘the 
specific belief or belief system under investigation’ (Fives & Beuhl, 2012, p.487).  
Beliefs have been studied extensively across multiple disciplines, and this raises 
difficulties when trying to find an appropriate definition for the term, particularly 
when other words are used synonymously, such as perspective, orientation and 
attitude (Francis et al., 2015, p.337).  For the purpose of clarity, beliefs are defined as 
the ‘embodied conscious and unconscious ideas and thoughts about oneself, the 
world and one’s position in it developed through membership in various social groups, 
and considered by the individual to be true’ (Cross, 2009, p. 326).  This definition 
aligns with a socio-cultural perspective where it is seen that beliefs are created 
through a process of enculturation and social construction (Pajares, 1992, p.316).  
When framed in this way, belief systems become rich and complex with many different 
factors influencing and shaping the beliefs of the individual.  Dahlberg et al. (1999) 
emphasize the diversity of these beliefs through their assertion that there is 'no 
external position of certainty, no universal understanding that exists outside history or 
society that can provide foundations for truth, knowledge and ethics' (Dahlberg et al., 
1999, p.23).   
Fives and Beuhl (2012) propose that beliefs act as filters of information and 
experience, as ways of framing situations and problems, and of guiding intention and 
action (p.478).  As a way of understanding the judgements, decisions and actions 
made by teachers within the classroom, the exploration of the content and factors that 

 
78
influence teacher beliefs is central to this study.  Early Years education is steeped in 
a historical legacy of child-centred practice that views childhood as a valuable entity in 
its own right rather than being simply a way of preparing children for adulthood (Walsh 
et al., 2010, p.11).  Teachers working in this sector hold distinctive beliefs about how 
children learn and how they should be educated, and these implicit theories guide 
teacher 
behaviour 
and 
ultimately 
children's 
learning 
(Spodek, 
1988).    
Furthermore, extensive research has found that teachers have clear beliefs about 
'school readiness' and the types of skills and behaviours that are important to ensure 
a smooth transition into school (Graue, 1992; Harradine & Clifford, 1996; Dockett & 
Perry, 2002b; Lin et al., 2003; Dockett & Perry, 2007).  By exploring factors that 
influence the beliefs of teachers, and the possible incongruence between beliefs and 
practice, some of the tensions that teachers have to navigate in the current 
educational landscape will be highlighted. 
Factors that Influence Teacher Beliefs  
Osberg and Biesta (2010) state that for education to be educational there has to be a 
reason behind it, and this reason needs to be defined before education can take place.  
Furthermore, this reasoning is made by someone and will always reflect ‘particular 
interests and values’ (p.601).  Levin (2015) asserts that, as teachers' beliefs and 
actions are intertwined within the situation in which they occur, including the school 
context and the larger social, political and economic climate, the role of context and 
situativity must be explored in order to understand the factors that influence beliefs 
(p.51).  Belief systems are multi-directional, and the beliefs held by teachers, and the 
behaviours and actions that are drawn from these beliefs both influence, and are 
influenced by, the school environment in which they work (Fives & Beuhl, 2012, p.476).  
As has been highlighted in Chapter Two, teachers are also influenced by the wider 
policy context, and the accountability demands that are placed upon them.   
As part of this study teachers are seen as actors and thinkers whose beliefs have been 
influenced by a multitude of past experiences, operating within a fluid and dynamic 
classroom setting.  As a way of understanding how teachers’ beliefs are constructed, 

 
79
the following section will explore some of the influences that impact on teachers’ 
belief systems.  
Personal Experiences 
Early Years teachers are part of a diverse community who have a range of different 
social, cultural and educational experiences and clear ideas about how young children 
should be educated.  Levin (2015) argues that the origins of teacher beliefs stem from 
both external sources, such as formalised knowledge, and internal sources such as 
personal experiences (p.50).  According to Richardson (1996) personal experiences 
can include ‘aspects of life that go into the formation of world view, intellectual and 
virtuous dispositions, beliefs about self in relation to others, understandings of the 
relationship of schooling to society, and other forms of personal, familial, and cultural 
understandings’ (p.105).  Beliefs are formed by past experiences that are deeply 
personal to the individual, rather than being a universal phenomenon (Pajares, 1992, 
p.309).  This view is echoed in findings from a nationwide longitudinal study carried 
out by Lin et al. (2003) examining perceptions of children’s readiness for school held 
by kindergarten teachers.  They determined that beliefs about ‘school readiness’ are 
shaped by many social and cultural factors, specifically the teacher’s ‘own experiences 
as learners and teachers, school structure, school teaching conditions, the 
expectations of schools for children, social forces, community needs and values, 
children's backgrounds, and external societal attitudes toward early childhood 
education’ (p.227).        
Knowledge   
Richardson (1996) states that in addition to personal experiences, the beliefs of 
teachers are also influenced by their own ‘formal knowledge’ (p.105).  She contends 
that when compared to neophytes in other working roles, teachers already have 
considerable experience within a teaching/learning environment and therefore enter 
the profession with ‘deep-seated and often tacit beliefs about the nature of teaching, 
learning, and schooling’ (Richardson, 2003, p.5).  In practice, beliefs can take many 
forms and can be embodied in such things as the teacher’s expectations of a child’s 

 
80
performances, or theories about teaching and learning.  Ng et al. (2009) assert that 
these beliefs are well established, firm and resistant to change, unlike knowledge 
systems, which Nespor (1987) argues, are much more dynamic and malleable than 
belief systems (p.321).  
Formal knowledge, in particular, pedagogical knowledge relating to the practice of 
teaching through such things as classroom management, models of teaching, and 
classroom environments, have also been found to influence teacher beliefs 
(Richardson, 1996).  Knowledge forms a system of beliefs, which in turn direct 
perceptions and behaviours (Deford, 1985, p.352) and is seen to be constantly 
changing, growing out of a ‘complex, dialectic relationship with the discursive social 
matrix that shapes it’ (Elbaz, 1991, p.5).  Clark and Lampert (1986) present the view 
that ‘Rather than looking to research on teacher thinking to tell us what knowledge 
teachers should have and use, we can look to it for enlightenment on the question of 
what kinds of knowledge teachers can use’.  They argue that teachers firstly need 
‘contextual knowledge’, in that the decisions they make are situation-specific and will 
be different from one day to the next dependent on the immediate situation, a 
particular goal, or the short term and long-term impact of such decisions.  It is the 
role of the teacher to adapt to children who, as learners, are constantly changing 
within the classroom environment, with the aim of facilitating ‘intellectual and 
behavioural changes’.  Teachers also build on ‘interactive knowledge’ whereby 
relationships are formed between educator and learner through an understanding of 
individual interests, social and emotional needs and the enablement of autonomy 
within the child.  Finally, teachers rely on knowledge that is ‘speculative’ in that 
‘Everything a teacher does must allow for multiple, unanticipated contingencies, most 
of which are beyond the teacher’s control’ (p.29).  Teachers do not know, for 
instance, the events that have occurred at home before a child comes to school in the 
morning, or how children will react to certain stimuli or classroom provocations, but 
they have a duty to work pro-actively within this fluid and dynamic framework.      
Nespor (1987) refers to knowledge as a ‘resource’ that is ‘possessed by the individual 
that can be brought to bear on the problem at hand’ (p.322).  Schoenfeld (1983) 
expands on this idea specifying that these resources include a range of facts and 

 
81
procedures that are available to the individual as heuristic problem-solving tools 
(p.332).  From a socio-cultural perspective, human action typically employs 
“mediational means” such as tools and language and it is these mediational means 
that shape the action in essential ways (Wertsch, 1991, p.12).  Lasky (2005) argues 
that the beliefs of individuals, and how they think and act is always shaped by the 
cultural, historical and social structures reflected in these mediational tools and, in the 
context of education, include such things as ‘policy mandates curriculum guidelines 
and state standards’ (p.900).  The discussion here highlights how teachers are 
working within complex and dynamic environments where knowledge of the 
individual needs of the child have to be considered alongside curricular policy and an 
outcome driven educational agenda.  Furthermore, curricular policy is in itself a fluid 
construct, dependent on the ideological drivers of the government of the day.  As has 
already been discussed, the OECD and neoliberal ideology has been highly influential 
in formulating educational policy that directly impacts on teaching practice, right 
down into the Early Years.  
This creates a space for potential sources of tensions and contradictions when we 
consider the messy and complex nature of the classroom existing within a policy 
context of particular expectations and outcomes.  The next section will consider the 
potential impact of neoliberal discourses that align ‘school readiness’ with ‘academic 
readiness’, and how teachers are positioned within this landscape. 
Tensions Between Beliefs and Practice 
Rimm-Kaufman et al. (2006) argue that holding a set of beliefs does not necessarily 
mean they are acted upon in a classroom setting, rather that they are a ‘framework 
that organise meaning and inform practices’ (p.143).  Based on findings from 
research exploring teacher beliefs and aspirations, Priestley et al. (2015) assert that 
existing policy and practice environments exert significant influence on the beliefs of 
teachers (p.58) and that this becomes questionable when ‘mixed and contradictory 
discourses’ are encountered by teachers who have only a superficial understanding of 
what those discourses mean (p.54).  Furthermore, Goouch (2010) suggests that there 
is a ‘strategic compliance’ within the teaching profession whereby teachers, including 

 
82
those in the Early Years, become ‘technicians’ to fulfil the requirements of politicians 
(p.42).  Lacey (1977) describes ‘strategic compliance’ as being when ‘the individual 
complies with the authority figure’s definition of the situation and the constraints of 
the situation but retains private reservations about them’ (p.72).  However, framing 
teachers as ‘compliant technicians’ is problematic when we consider the school 
environment and recognise that teachers are accountable to a number of different 
groups of people, including the parents of the children they teach, the Senior 
Leadership Team, and the LEA.  As in many places of work there is a hierarchical 
management structure within schools, so questions arise as to whether teachers have 
little choice or autonomy, and are powerless to overtly resist the implementation of 
local and national policies. 
Within this context, educational policy becomes hegemonic in the Gramscian sense, 
whereby the process that the teachers follow are dominated by the ‘ruling classes’, in 
this case the management team, the LEA and the Government, through a combination 
of ‘coercion and consent’ (MacDonald, 2003, p.431).  Ball (1990) argues that 
‘Gramsci sees ideology as the ‘cement’ upon which hegemony is built’ (p.177).  Scott 
(1990) contends that ideology defines what is realistic and unrealistic for subordinate 
groups in order to ‘drive certain aspirations and grievances into the realm of the 
impossible’ (p.74).  As has already been highlighted, neoliberal ideology within an 
English educational context has created a culture of performativity and accountability 
that places a stranglehold on teaching practice.  By placing teachers in a position of 
paralysis, where they are unable to work against government policy and school 
expectations, behaviour can be managed without necessarily needing to change the 
beliefs of the teachers (Scott, 1990, p.74).  Yarker (2005) poses the question ‘How far 
is it proper for a teacher to stay silent, or to be silenced and to disregard their personal 
views, in the implementation of education policy?’ (p.170).  Furthermore, Fives and 
Beuhl (2016) argue that when teachers are pressured into engaging in practices that 
are misaligned with their beliefs there may be negative effects on teacher wellbeing 
(p.116).  This steers the debate towards teacher agency, praxis, and identity, which 
has already been explored in depth earlier in this chapter.   

 
83
Research has highlighted how teachers view personal, social, communication and ‘life’ 
skills as more important in the Early Years than instrumental areas of learning such as 
Literacy and Mathematics (Heaviside & Farris, 1993; West et al., 1993; Lewit & Baker, 
1995; Harradine & Clifford, 1996; Lin et al., 2003; Wesley & Buysse, 2003), yet there is 
a clear emphasis on ‘academic readiness’ in current educational policy.  Neoliberal 
policy discourse that equates ‘school readiness’ to ‘academic readiness’ is problematic 
in its linear and hierarchical approach to Early Years education, and the ‘taken for 
granted’ aspect of the construct of the child and their own disposition to education 
and learning (Moss, 2012, p.356).  Policy guidelines lay out increasing academic 
expectations for children, which can potentially impact on teachers’ understanding of 
‘school readiness’, and the practices that are engaged within the classroom (Brown & 
Lan, 2015, p.2).  Research carried out by Brown et al. (2015) on the influence of 
neoliberalism in ECE found that whilst teachers believe they have the freedom to 
instruct their pupils in a way that reflects their own beliefs about effective practice, 
their pedagogical choices were constrained by, as well as reflected in, the state’s 
educational policy.  Jeffrey (2002) argues that a ‘performativity discourse through the 
experience of OfSTED inspections and the necessity to achieve pre-determined targets 
has shifted pedagogy towards an inculcatory approach’ (p.9).   
The notion of ‘academic readiness’ is clearly emphasised in English educational policy 
with a distinct focus on the teaching of phonics, Literacy and Mathematics.  A report 
published by the Standards and Testing Agency (STA, 2013) asserts that the 
Government ‘believes that a good foundation in Mathematics and Literacy is crucial 
for later success, particularly in terms of children's readiness for school’.  The current 
emphasis on raising reading standards through the implementation of a synthetic 
phonics scheme is further intensified by the phonics based reading test, which takes 
place at the end of Year One in England.  The phonics-screening test is linked to being 
‘school ready’, highlighted in the Government’s social mobility indicators, where it is 
stated that ‘Children need to learn the basics of reading early in their education so 
they can access the whole curriculum and succeed in school’ (Deputy Prime Minister’s 
Office, 2014).  OfSTED reports entitled Getting them reading early (2011) and 
Reading by six: How the best schools do it (2010) present a discourse that supports the 

 
84
ideology of ‘early is best’ falling into what Hyatt (2013a) describes as an ‘accountability 
warrant’, where schools and teachers are measured solely on results or outcomes 
which further exacerbates a culture of performativity (p.839).  The concern here is 
that a focus on ‘academic readiness’ may have already become the modus operandi of 
Early Years practice as teachers work within a framework where their performance is 
judged on the results their pupils achieve, particularly when it is instrumental skills 
such as Literacy and phonics that are being placed at the forefront of the ‘school 
readiness’ agenda.  This tension is highlighted in recent research carried out by 
Roberts-Holmes (2015a) exploring the ‘datafication’ of early years pedagogy, which 
found that the assessment shift towards Mathematics and phonics resulted in 
‘pedagogical shifts towards the replication of primary school performance culture’ 
(p.307).  A more instructive pedagogical approach could be found to be incongruent 
with Early Years teachers who believe children should learn through exploration and 
play.   
The Good Level of Development as the Object-Oriented Goal of the 
Activity System 
Whilst Vygotsky places emphasis on the physical and conceptual tools that mediate 
culture (Edwards, 2007b, p.7), Leontiev (2009) shifts the attention to the object stating 
that: 
The main thing that distinguishes one activity from another, however, is the 
difference of their objects. It is exactly the object of an activity that gives it a 
determined direction. According to the terminology I have proposed, the object 
of an activity is its true motive (p.98). 
One of the basic tenets of an activity system is that is has an object, in this instance, 
the GLD.  Leontiev (2009) argues that the object of activity system appears in two 
forms: first as an independent presence that drives the activity of the subject (the 
teacher), and second, as a product of reflection of the properties of the object (the 
GLD) which emerges as a result of the activity of the subject.  Leontiev (1978) upheld 
that behind every activity there is a motive, and proposed that the object of the 
activity was its ‘true motive’ (p.98).  Furthermore, he argued that the subject is 

 
85
motivated not by individual needs or free will, but by objects of a ‘material world’ 
(p.55).   
Edwards (2007b) contends that action is elicited by our interpretation of the object, 
and by the different possibilities of engaging with the object in ‘different sets of 
socially and historically situated practices’ (p.7).  It must therefore be questioned 
what the salient motivations behind the object (the GLD) are, and whether those 
motivations align with the ‘free will’ of the subject (teacher).  This brings to mind the 
work of Freire (2000) and although it may sound melodramatic to consider teachers 
as ‘the oppressed’, similarities can be seen with Freire’s declaration that ‘the behavior 
of the oppressed is a prescribed behavior, following as it does the guidelines of the 
oppressor’ (p.47), and that of the teacher working within a ‘compliant context’ where 
teaching practices are driven by ‘predetermined economic, political, and ideological 
agendas’ (Latta & Kim, 2009, p.137).  Ang (2015) argues that ‘Pedagogy and 
supporting children’s learning is a social process which best takes place in a context 
where the human ability to compare, judge and make pedagogical decisions is 
exercised, not when learning, teaching and practice is conditioned by policy and 
statutory requirements’ (p.194).  The problem arises when it is considered whether 
pressures to meet curricular outcomes that focus more on cognitive development and 
‘school readiness’ have an impact on teaching in the Early Years, and, if so, how much 
of what the teacher does is affected by these pressures.    
In the Early Years, educational policy such as the EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017) frames a child's 
learning and development through the lens of Developmental Psychology, drawing on 
positivist methodologies to observe cognition, behaviour, and competence (Wood & 
Hedges, 2016, p.389).  From this perspective, the ‘developing child’ is seen as an 
‘object of study’, something that is produced for ‘particular purposes within very 
specific historical, social and political conditions’ (Walkerdine, 1993, p.453).  
Concepts of ‘readiness’ that dominate ECE policy discourses ‘predefine desirable 
subject positions and trajectories of development’ which reduces the complexities of 
how learning and development is experienced by the child and the teacher (Evans, 
2015, p.35).  This is highlighted by the deterministic nature of the GLD based on 
linear trajectory of outcomes and a Piagetian 'ages and stages' framework that 

 
86
privileges scientific 'truths' about children's development and learning.  Burman 
(2017) argues that ‘The selection of children as objects of developmental psychological 
enquiry leads to failure to theorise the psychological context they inhabit’ (p.5).   
This is echoed in the Early Years Learning and Development Review (Evangelou et al., 
2009) where it is pointed out that linear progressions ‘homogenise development’ and 
new theories of development propose that children develop along a ‘web of multiple 
strands’ and ‘different pathways’ (p.29).  Furthermore, Wood and Hedges (2016) 
argue that ‘guiding development is not the same as guiding learning’ and it is learning 
that leads development rather than the other way around (p.393).  This creates 
added complexities when ‘school readiness’ is based on the achievement of 
prescribed developmental outcomes, specifically the GLD, rather than on a ‘readiness 
to learn’ construct which encompasses competencies such as motivation, emotional 
maturity, intellectual ability, and health.  Further questions arise when we consider 
whether teachers focus on the GLD in order to produce the outcome of ‘school 
readiness’, or whether there is room to expand the object of the activity to include 
‘broader motives of well-being, democracy and equity’ (Edwards, 2010, p.67).         
Concluding Comments 
The aim of this chapter has been to highlight the challenges faced by teachers working 
in a dynamic and diverse environment, whilst having to ensure children achieve 
certain outcomes by the end of their year in Reception.  This is in contrast to the 
deterministic and prescribed way of viewing children’s development within policy 
frameworks, as discussed in the previous chapter.  Using CHAT as a research 
framework has enabled me to begin to make sense of the complexities of teaching as 
a dialectic process, and to consider how teachers navigate a landscape that is not only 
educational, but also political.  This framework has also helped to formulate the 
research questions that will help to identify the tensions and contradictions that 
teachers face within an agenda driven by ‘school readiness’: 
1) 
How is ‘school readiness’ defined in Government policy in England? 
2) 
What do teachers in the Early Years perceive ‘school readiness’ to be? 
3) 
How is ‘school readiness’ constructed within the Reception classroom?  

 
87
4) 
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs about 
‘school readiness’ and pedagogical practice? 
5) 
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs about 
‘school readiness’ and policy frameworks?  
The next chapter will identify how this framework has helped to inform the methods 
and the analytical process that has been undertaken in this research.

Methodological Considerations   
 
The purpose of this research is to explore teachers’ beliefs about ‘school readiness’, 
and how ‘school readiness’ is constructed through pedagogical approaches, 
curriculum planning and assessments practices in two Reception classrooms in north-
west England.  As a way of understanding this issue, the study was guided by the 
following research questions: 
1) 
How is ‘school readiness’ defined in Government policy in England? 
2) 
What do teachers in the Early Years perceive ‘school readiness’ to be? 
3) 
How is ‘school readiness’ constructed within the Reception classroom?  
4) 
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs 
about ‘school readiness’ and pedagogical practice? 
5) 
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs 
about ‘school readiness’ and policy frameworks?  
 
This chapter will describe the methodology used throughout the study and includes: 
(a) justification for the methodological framework, (b) the research location and 
sample, (c) overview of the research design, (d) the data collection methods, (e) ethical 
considerations, and (f) issues of trustworthiness. 
Methodological Framework  
Mertens (2010) argues that it is philosophical assumptions that ‘form the paradigm 
that guides the thinking and action within the research process’ (p.7).  Guba and 
Lincoln (1994) define a paradigm as being a ‘worldview’ that considers the ‘nature of 
the “world”, the individual’s place in it and the range of possible relationships to that 
world’ (p.107).  Stemming from Kant’s (1914) philosophical work Critique of 
Judgement, the idea of weltanschauung (worldview) evolved to refer to an ‘intellectual 
conception of the universe from the perspective of a human knower’ (Naugle, 2002, 
p.59).  With this in mind, it must be acknowledged that research is not a neutral 
activity and researchers have their own ‘values, biases and world views’ through which 
they examine and interpret the world of their participants (Cohen et al., 2011, p.225).   

 
89
An important part of the research process is to specify the overall epistemological 
stance that has been taken, including the implicit and explicit assumptions about the 
subject, and the nature of knowledge that is considered valid to resolve the research 
question.  As discussed in the previous chapter, CHAT has been utilised as a way of 
understanding how we are ‘not isolated individuals interacting with our environment’ 
but that the world is ‘mediated by other people, and the cultural-historical context in 
which we live’ (Wilson, 2014, p.21).  In this research context, the ‘systematic 
investigation of social phenomena and human behaviour and interaction’ (Lichtman, 
2013, p.4) of a qualitative research strategy is conducive to the exploration of the 
beliefs of the teacher participants, and of their classroom activity.  The 
epistemological orientation of a qualitative research strategy places an emphasis on 
the way individuals interpret their social world and that there are multiple ways of 
investigating multiple versions of reality (Cohen et al., 2011, p.219).  Furthermore, in 
an educational context, qualitative research recognises that what happens in schools 
and classrooms is made up of ‘complex layers of meanings, interpretations, values and 
attitudes’ (Hitchcock & Hughes, 1995, p.26).  This approach will enable the research 
to focus on the dynamics of the social, political and cultural nature of the activity 
system enabling a deeper analysis of the observed characteristics of arising situations 
(Gobo, 2007, p.203).  
Ontological questions and assumptions are concerned with the desire to understand 
what it means to be human interacting in a social world (Hitchcock & Hughes, 1995, 
p.19).  Burrell and Morgan (1979) argue that the fundamental ontological question 
for social scientists is whether the reality being investigated is objective and external 
to the individual, or the product of individual consciousness and cognition (p.1).  If 
reality is seen as being socially constructed, individual perceptions and experiences of 
the social world must be investigated and interpreted using subjective and personal 
accounts (Sikes, 2004, p.20).  Alternatively, if the social world is considered to be an 
objective and external reality then it is something that can be observed and accounted 
for through quantifiable data, using a natural science model, and a positivist approach 
in particular (Bryman, 2001, p.20).  Using CHAT as a research framework 
acknowledges that reality is socially constructed, but is also in a state of constant 

 
90
change facilitated by ‘human collaborative practices’ in which ‘people themselves 
come to know, to act, and to be’ (Stetsenko, 2015, p.xxii) in a time of ‘overlapping 
matrices of socio-cultural and political-economical relations’ (p.xxiii).     
Within an educational research context, contending views about ‘different 
conceptions of social reality and of individual and social behaviour’ need to be 
examined in more detail in order to understand the issues that emerge (Cohen et al. 
2011, p.5).  This is important as the different visions of social realities, and how these 
realities are examined, influence the methodological framework and the data 
collection methods used in the research (Bryman, 2001, p.4).  As a starting point, a 
survey was carried out in order to gain a ‘wider picture’ of what teachers believe 
‘school readiness’ to be.  A fundamental issue from the outset of this research was 
the lack of any clear definition in ECE policy about what ‘school readiness’ looks like, 
and therefore it was deemed pertinent to establish a general overview of the 
perspectives of teachers.  The interview questions focused on exploring the 
individual and social processes that ‘reflect how experience is constructed both 
internally and externally’ (Salkind, 2010, p.871).  Referring back to the 
recommendations made by Fives and Beuhl (2012), the aim of the interview was to 
address the ‘complex and multifaceted beliefs’ teachers’ hold about a ‘wide range of 
people and structures’ (p.487).   
The following table (Table 10) highlights all of the data collection methods that were 
used as a way of gaining an insight into teachers’ beliefs and classroom practices:

Research Location and Sample 
The research was carried out in a school situated in an area of religious and cultural 
diversity, with 22% of the population coming from an ethnic minority (Oldham Council, 
2012).  As a Local Authority, results at the end of the Foundation Stage are 
statistically lower than the national average with 53.7% of children assessed as 
achieving the GLD, compared to 66.3% nationally (Public Health England, 2016, p.11).  
Gaps in ‘school readiness’ are mostly associated with race, ethnicity, place of birth, 
gender and poverty, where working class boys are also seen to be a disadvantaged 
group (Pascal & Bertram, 2013; Sutton Trust, 2012).  In contrast, there are affluent 
pockets of the borough where education and skill levels are significantly higher than 
national averages, and a high proportion of children leave Foundation Stage having 
achieved the GLD (69.9%) (Oldham Council, 2014).  
My intention was to find a school with a two or three form entry so I would be able to 
work with teachers from the research location.  A purposive sampling approach was 
adopted as this allows the researcher to ‘discover, understand, and gain insight’ and 
therefore it was important to select a sample from which ‘the most can be learned’ 
(Merriam & Tisdell, 2015, p.96).  The participants were selected based on the 
following criteria:  
1) Trained as a teacher and have Qualified Teacher Status  
2) Work within a Reception classroom  
3) Work in a two or three form entry school 
4) Be geographically convenient 
I contacted a number of schools via email and telephone, sending out a copy of the 
executive summary (Appendix A) and teacher participant information sheet (Appendix 
B) to ensure schools were fully informed of the research project.  The school which 
agreed to help facilitate the research was a two-form entry school, larger than the 
average-sized primary with a high proportion of children with special educational 
needs, and an average number of children from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
Initially, the two Reception teachers were the only participants, but as the research 
progressed it became clear that it would be pertinent to include the Year One teachers 

 
92
and the Nursery teacher who was also a member of the Senior Leadership Team.  The 
teachers across the EYFS and Year One worked closely with each other to prepare 
children for transition, so it was considered that their perspectives on issues around 
‘school readiness’ would add further depth to the data.  Biographical data was 
requested from each of the teachers to provide some background context (Appendix 
C), represented in Table 11 using pseudonyms for the teachers to respect anonymity.

I met with the teachers prior to beginning the research to ensure they understood 
what was required, and to address any questions or potential issues that they had.  
Together we pre-arranged the research observation schedule and interview dates 
(Appendix D) to fit in with the school calendar and teacher responsibilities, and it was 
agreed that every other Friday morning during term time would be a suitable slot to 
be in the classroom to collect data.  As an act of reciprocity in recognition of the time 
the teachers were giving to the research project, I felt that it was important that, when 
not collecting data, I was on hand to help out with the classroom activities, and 

 
93
interact with the children.  I believe this helped to establish a positive research 
relationship from the outset, and the children became used to me ‘being around’ the 
classroom.   
Research Design 
In order to understand the subject-object activity relationship within the context of 
the classroom, Diagram 6 shows how the supplementary research questions were 
mapped to the activity system as part of the data collection design. In order to explore 
the ‘complexities and contradictions of real life’ (Flyvbjerg, 2006, p.21) Table 12 
specifies the research methods used.

Data Collection 
The aim of this research was to explore the beliefs of teachers about ‘school readiness’ 
and how this is constructed in the Reception classroom.  All the data were collected 
in the natural setting of the school, using semi-structured interviews, non-participant 
observations, document analysis, and reflective conversations with the teachers.  A 
survey was carried out at the initial stage of the data collection period as a way of 
gaining an overview of current beliefs around ‘school readiness’ from a wider 
perspective.  The following section will explore in more depth the different data 
collection methods used in this research.   
Survey 
In order to explore the beliefs of teachers in a wider context an Internet survey 
questionnaire was used as a way of providing a broad understanding of perceptions 
around constructs of ‘school readiness’, and an overview of the general teaching 
practices in Early Years classrooms.  Surveys are a useful way of providing a snapshot 
of attitudes, experiences, thoughts, feelings or behaviours at a specific point in time, 
and enable the collection of large scale data from a representative sample in an 
economical and efficient way (Cohen et al., 2011, p.257). 

 
95
The survey used for this research was based on the Starting School questionnaire 
(Perry et al., 1998) that was implemented as part of the Starting School Research 
Project in Australia.  The Starting School Research Project was a longitudinal study 
that investigated the perceptions of all those involved in a child’s transition to school.  
Permission was sought from the authors prior to the questionnaire being adapted for 
use in the study (Appendix E).  The Starting School questionnaire consisted of five 
sections relating to the background of the participants, how schools are made ready 
for children, successful transitions to school and the skills and experiences that were 
perceived to be a prerequisite for a successful transition into school.  For the purpose 
of this research the Starting School questionnaire was adapted to focus on aspects of 
‘school readiness’ although many of the original statements remained in the survey 
(Appendix F).  Omitted statements were linked to specific aspects of the child’s home 
life, such as whether they were immunised, or received regular medical and dental 
care, that were not deemed relevant for the focus of this study.  
The data from the Starting School questionnaires, combined with interview data from 
the Starting School Research Project, identified eight response categories (Table 13) 
(Dockett & Perry, 2004, p.175).

From these eight response categories the ‘school readiness’ survey questionnaire used 
in this research focused on knowledge, adjustment, skills, disposition, rules and 
physical as a framework for the analysis of the survey data results.  As this research 
focuses on the beliefs of teachers about ‘school readiness’, the ‘family issues’ and 
‘educational environment’ categories were not included in this questionnaire, but this 
provides scope for further research in the future. 
The survey was written and presented using an online survey tool, SmartSurvey, which 
was then disseminated through various Early Years Facebook groups and online 
Internet forums.  Permission was sought from group administrators prior to posting 
the link to the survey on the Facebook page and forums.  Potential participants were 
informed of the research on the first page of the survey, and the ethical considerations 
of the research (Figure 17).  There was no requirement to provide any personal 
details and participants were able to leave the survey at any point with incomplete 
surveys not included in the final data compilation.

The advantages of using social media in this way is that relevant sample groups are 
easily identified by their involvement in groups linked to teaching in the Early Years.  
Furthermore, the Facebook groups and Internet forums provided a channel for the 
questionnaire to be distributed quickly to a wide audience, and the web interface of 
the survey tool allowed responses to be collected and analysed with relative ease.  
However, using social media as part of the research process is not without its 
challenges.  The larger and more active the Facebook group, the faster the post 
requesting survey respondents moves down the page and as a result is less likely to be 
seen by people reading the page at a later time.  Cohen et al. (2011) also warn that 
response rates for Internet surveys tends to be lower than paper-based surveys, as is 
the rate of completion of the whole survey (p.286).  The survey used in this research 
culminated in a total of 298 responses, of which 142 were completed in full. 
The ‘school readiness’ questionnaire (Appendix F) used in this survey began by asking 
for background information of the respondent such as length of time teaching and the 
number of children in the class.  This was to get an overall view of the demographic 
and biographical information of the respondents, and as a way of shifting from the 
‘objective’ to the ‘subjective’, beginning with ‘non-threatening questions that 
respondents can easily answer’ (Cohen et al., 2011, p.398).  For each of the questions 
presented, where appropriate, participants were given the opportunity to add further 
comments to give more depth to their answers.  O’Cathain and Thomas (2004) advise 
that using open as well as closed questions in a questionnaire offers respondents an 
opportunity to voice their opinion which helps to balance the closed questions that 
reflect the researcher’s agenda (p.2).  Using open-ended questions in a questionnaire 
can also cause difficulties when preparing for analysis due to having some of the 
features of qualitative research, but perhaps lacking some of the key strengths of this 
type of research.  Presented on the back of closed questions, a ‘legitimate agenda’ is 
already established and O’Cathain and Thomas (2004) argue that this may ‘impose 
constraints on responses’ (p.4).   
 

 
98
Semi-structured Interviews 
Fives and Beuhl (2012) assert that teachers hold ‘complex and multi-faceted beliefs’ 
about a ‘wide range of people and structures’ (p.487). The rationale for using 
interviews was to illuminate specific beliefs about ‘school readiness’ held by the 
teachers, and to identify how teachers conceptualised the construction of ‘school 
readiness’ in the specific context of their classroom (Shepel, 2008, p.217).  This is in 
line with Phipps and Borg’s (2009) suggestion that beliefs drawn out through 
discussion of actual classroom practice may be ‘more rooted in reality’ than other 
methods, such as questionnaires, where teachers may present their ‘idealistic beliefs’ 
or their beliefs about ‘what should be’ rather than ‘what is’ (p.382).   Priestley et al. 
(2015) assert that the beliefs of teachers are ‘instrumental in shaping practice’, and 
that these beliefs may be immune to the efforts of policy-makers attempting to 
change them (P.37).  Using Engeström and Sannino’s (2011) ‘Manifestations of 
Contradictions’ to analyse the interviews will help to highlight any contradictions 
between the beliefs of the teachers and their classroom practices (Yamagata-Lynch & 
Haudenschild, 2009, p.507).  
Semi-structured interviews were carried out with the participants at various stages of 
the research process (Table 14).  A set of core questions was used to ensure that the 
relevant aspects of the study were covered, but the nature of a semi-structured 
interview allowed flexibility to pursue developing themes that emerge during the 
process.

The interviews took place between January and July 2016, following a pilot study that 
was used to refine the questions and obtain feedback, carried out with two students I 
teach on a BA (Hons) Early Years degree who were not part of the research sample.  
All the interviews were digitally recorded with permission from the participants, 
transcribed in preparation for analysis, and sent to the participants for verification and 
reflection on what had been discussed. 
Non-Participant Observation 
In order to explore more deeply the classroom as an activity system, observations took 
place within the naturalistic setting of the classroom, based on a non-participant 
approach.  This method is useful as a way of entering the activity system in order to 
gain a ‘direct understanding of a phenomenon in its natural context’ (Liu & Maitlis, 
2010, p.610).  By focusing on the role of the teacher as the subject in the activity 
system, observations provided an insight into the dynamics of the classroom 
environment and the provision of resources, alongside the teaching activities.  The 
observations carried out were unstructured, used as a way of learning about the more 
intricate happenings in the classroom, shifting the focus from the ‘broad canvas of 
activity in the setting towards specific areas’ (Denscombe, 2010, p.208).  
Furthermore, the observations allowed me to identify issues and problems, and 
observe instances of how the teachers viewed certain things that occurred in the 
classroom.   
As I was carrying out research in two Reception classrooms, the observation schedule 
was arranged so I was in each classroom on alternate weeks, taking place over twelve 
non-consecutive weeks in the spring and summer term.  Each visit took place on a 

 
100
Friday morning for three hours at a time, and a total of thirty-six hours was spent in 
the setting.  During this time, I undertook observations in all aspects of the 
classroom, including whole class teaching, group work, and free play, both inside and 
outside.  I was not directly observing the children in the classroom, but each parent 
was given an information sheet (Appendix K) explaining the purpose of my research in 
the classroom, and the option to withdraw their child from any possible observations 
they may be involved in with the teacher.   Only one family chose to withdraw their 
child so I ensured that he did not participate in any observations.  As a way of 
recording what happened during the observations, field notes were taken by hand at 
the time of observation and then typed up later.   
Document Analysis 
The documents used in this research have been produced by others for purposes other 
than this research project, including lesson plans, activity plans, and assessment 
documents, collected in order to gain a fuller picture of the workings of the activity 
system.  Hitchcock and Hughes (1995) assert that in a research context ‘everything is 
potentially a ‘document’’ (p.218) although Bowen (2009) advises that documents 
should be examined with a ‘critical eye’, and not treated as ‘precise, accurate, or 
complete recordings of events that have occurred’ (p.33) and with this in mind, these 
documents were utilised as supporting pieces of data.  Referring back to the activity 
system, policy frameworks and the GLD are defined as key concepts and therefore this 
supporting evidence was deemed to be useful.  Evidence of children’s work was also 
collected through photographs as a way of documenting how ‘school readiness’ is 
constructed within the classroom.  In this context, the photographs enable me to 
‘look beyond the content’ and further into the working practices of the teacher 
participants (Kanstrup, 2002).    
Reflective Conversations  
Throughout the course of the data collection, I worked closely with both Reception 
teachers, often helping out with small group activities and engaging in children’s free 
flow play.  Becoming a part of the classroom activity, albeit temporarily, enabled me 

 
101
to have more informal conversations with the teachers I was working alongside.  
Feldman (1999) argues that conversations among teachers can help to serve ‘the 
sharing of knowledge and the growth of understanding’ as part of a ‘meaning making 
process’ (p.126).  Reflective conversations that took place between myself and the 
teacher were written up immediately after they had taken place to ensure they were 
accurate reflections.  These reflective conversations were a useful way of gaining 
insight into the lived experiences of the teachers involved, and help to form a deeper 
level of understanding (Lamb, 2013, p.86).  This aligns with a constructivist 
perspective whereby knowledge is co-constructed through conversational interactions 
between researcher and teacher (Hollingsworth & Dybdahl, 2007, p.151).   
Ethical Considerations 
When carrying out any research, ethics and morals play a prominent part, but this is 
multiplied when the research involves the study of people (Wellington, 2015, p.112).  
This study was informed by the British Educational Research Association (BERA, 2011), 
and was approved by the University of Sheffield’s ethical review panel (Appendix L).  
As specified in the guidelines, voluntary informed consent was obtained from the two 
initial participants (Reception teachers) prior to the research being carried out and as 
the research evolved, further teachers involved in the research also gave informed 
consent (BERA, 2011, p.5) (Appendix M).  The head teacher was the initial 
gatekeeper and an executive summary was provided giving details about the research 
(Appendix A).  Information sheets (Appendix B) were given to the teachers explaining 
what the research would entail, their role in the study, and that they could leave the 
process at any point.  An initial meeting was arranged between myself, the deputy 
head teacher and the teachers involved to go through the information sheet and to 
enable the teachers to clarify any questions they might have about the research. 
Other ethical considerations that Wellington (2015) asserts ‘should not be broken’ 
(p.115) were put in place included anonymising all responses and pseudonyms have 
been used in the research.  All data has been held confidentially on a password 
protected laptop and is backed up to iCloud and Dropbox.  Having been a primary 
school teacher, I was also acutely aware of the time constraints placed on teachers so 

 
102
tried to ensure the research caused as little disruption as possible.  The deputy head 
teacher was very supportive of the study and allowed the teachers to be released from 
teaching duties to undertake the interviews which helped to ease time pressures.   
Trustworthiness of the Research 
Denscombe (2010) argues that it is the responsibility of the researcher to persuade 
the reader that the data are ‘reasonably likely to be accurate and appropriate’ and it 
is on this basis that judgements can be made as to the credibility of the data (p.299).  
The foundation of this research was to discover individual perceptions through the 
exploration of subjective and personal accounts, an approach which Lincoln and Guba 
(1985) argue can be seen to be ‘undisciplined’ and lack ‘rigor’ (p.289).  In response, 
Guba and Lincoln (1994) argue an alternative approach to the validity and reliability 
criteria used in quantitative research (p.114).  They propose that qualitative research 
should be assessed for its trustworthiness, made up of four criteria each of which 
parallels an equivalent in quantitative research: 
• 
Credibility (internal validity) 
• 
Transferability (external validity) 
• 
Dependability (reliability) 
• 
Confirmability (objectivity)   
Credibility is sought through the use of ‘multiple accounts of social reality’, and 
subsequent member validation of the generated data (Bryman, 2001, p.272).  In this 
research context, a survey was carried out in order to gain an insight into perspectives 
of the wider community before the research focused in on the beliefs of five teachers 
in one primary school.  Various data collection methods were used as a way of 
triangulating the sources of data, and transcripts from the interviews were sent to 
participants to check the validity and reflect on any further points to be raised.   
As this is a small-scale study focusing on the activity system in two Reception 
classrooms in one school, it is acknowledged that the detailed findings will be unique 
to this specific context, and no claims of transferability are being made.  However, it 
is asserted that the findings are detailed and rich due to the small number of 

 
103
participants, which is conducive to writing what is known as a ‘thick description’ 
(Bryman, 2001, p.272).  For the purpose of this research, this is achieved by 
describing the participants and the setting, and the results will present an ‘adequate 
“voice” of participants’, through the use of long quotes or dialogue (Ponterotto, 2006, 
p.547).   
In order to address issues around dependability, complete records of all phases of the 
research process have been kept including fieldwork notes, transcripts, data analysis 
decisions, the research diary, and communications with the participants and other 
relevant parties.  
Tobin and Begley (2004) assert that ‘Confirmability (comparable with objectivity or 
neutrality) is concerned with establishing that data and interpretations of the findings 
are not figments of the inquirer’s imagination, but are clearly derived from the data’ 
(p.392).  Bryman (2001) advises that the research should not be affected directly by 
overt personal values or theoretical inclinations which could sway the findings derived 
from the study (p.274).  Cohen et al. (2011) suggest that researchers should be 
reflexive, acknowledging and disclosing their own values, and considering the possible 
influence they might have on the research process (p.225).  As a way of addressing 
this, the personal and professional rationale in the first chapter of the thesis clarifies 
my own positionality regarding the ‘school readiness’ debate.  However, it could be 
argued that this portrayal of the described ‘self’ is still a personal construction within 
the written text that may still ‘foster illusions’ on the part of the researcher (Lincoln & 
Guba, 2005, p.184).  Whilst this approach does not eliminate or reduce the presence 
of the underlying values, by making them visible those evaluating the research are 
able to take into account the values that may have had an influence on the work 
(Greenbank, 2003, p.795). 
In the next chapter I will provide the details of how the data analysis was carried out 
and will thematically present the findings that emerged from the data.

Findings and Analysis 
 
Merriam and Tisdell (2015) assert that ‘Data analysis is the process of making sense 
out of the data’ and this involves consolidating, reducing, and interpreting what 
people have said and what the researcher has seen and read’ (p.202).  The goal of 
this analysis is to highlight the thematic findings from the interviews to address the 
following three key questions: 
1) 
What beliefs do teachers have about 'school readiness'? (Survey and 
interview) 
2) 
How is 'school readiness' constructed in the classroom? (Interview, 
photographic evidence, reflective conversations and observation) 
3) 
What contradictions are there between beliefs and practice? 
(Interview) 
What Beliefs do Teachers have about 'School Readiness'? 
It has already been stated in Chapter Two of this thesis that the ‘school readiness’ 
agenda can easily be problematised when it is clearly acknowledged that there is no 
established definition of what this actually means for teachers.  As a way of exploring 
the 'bigger picture' regarding the beliefs teachers hold about 'school readiness', the 
survey questionnaire was used to examine the view of the wider teacher population, 
as well as providing some background context to the research.   
Presentation of the Findings of the Survey 
As discussed in the previous chapter, this survey was based on the Starting School 
questionnaire (Perry et al., 1998) that was implemented as part of the Starting School 
Research Project in Australia.  The overall aims of this survey were to find out the 
beliefs of teachers about ‘school readiness’ and was framed using the category 
responses displayed in Table 15 based on the work of Dockett and Perry (2004).  
Further questions set out to explore how the classrooms operated, including how 

 
105
much time was spent on phonics and Mathematics, and in group/whole classroom 
activities.

Responses from 142 respondents are included in this analysis.  All of the respondents 
were female and the majority worked in Nursery (39.44%) and Reception (44.37%) 
whilst the rest (16.2%) worked in Key Stage One or mixed year groups.  There was a 
range of teaching experience, with responses from teachers in their first year of 
teaching to those who had had over thirty years teaching experience.   
The online Smart Survey software generated a downloadable report that detailed the 
responses, presenting the data in quantitative formats such as graphs, charts and 
numbers of collated responses, and the answers to the open-ended questions as a list 
of comments linked to the specific question.  In addition to the report, I was able to 
download a .csv file that was then imported into the data analysis software, NVivo.  

 
106
This enabled me to start analysing the data using the framework derived from the 
categories of responses relating to (1) knowledge, (2) adjustment, (3) skills, (4) 
disposition, (5) rules, and (6) physical.  Using these categories as overarching themes, 
I then thematically coded the data to establish further themes that emerged.  The 
following section will provide the results of the responses given in the questionnaire 
survey framed by the category responses specified in Table 15.   
Knowledge 
The questionnaire asked respondents to list the first three things that came to their 
mind when they considered ‘school readiness’.  Only one respondent listed ‘Maths’ 
as a response, and interestingly there were no other references to the ‘knowledge’ 
category for this question.  Respondents were then asked to rate how important 
given statements were concerning ‘school readiness’, and the results from the 
statements linking to the ‘knowledge’ response category are displayed in Table 16.  
Being able to read their own name, recognise basic colours, and count to ten were 
considered to be of varying degrees of importance to over half of the respondents, 
whereas knowledge of their address, days of the week, operating a simple computer 
programme, and being able to write their own name were judged to be not important 
when assessing whether a child is ready for school.

The qualitative comments from the survey also highlight how personal and social skills, 
rather than specific knowledges, are perceived by teachers to be fundamental when 
judging whether a child is ‘ready’ for school.  One respondent stated:  
A child who can count to 10, write their name and knows their phonics is 
wonderful, but if they are not secure to explore an environment on their own 
and are upset every day leaving their parents, are they really school ready? 
[Survey data] 
Another respondent echoed this sentiment, only this time focused on the tension 
between aspects of knowledge, and the importance of independence and curiosity as 
prerequisites for learning, stating: 
School readiness is often perceived by adults as being able to read, write and 
count. Independence and a curiosity to explore are vital to enable children to 
thrive and enjoy developing as a learner. [Survey data] 
When asked to rank the six categories linked to school readiness in order of 
importance, knowledge was placed in sixth place overall.   
Out of 142 respondents, 137 teachers reported doing phonics activities at least once 
a week, with 99 participants specifying they did phonics on a daily basis.  Rote 
counting was carried out at least once a week by 130 respondents, with 81 teachers 
doing this daily with children.  Less than 10 respondents reported using worksheets 
for Mathematics and Literacy, however the majority of respondents said they did 
teacher-led writing and Mathematical activities with children at least once a week with 
around a quarter doing these daily.  Some respondents also specified that they make 
individual judgements as to whether children are ready for more formal skills, 
demonstrated in this response: 
We aim to encourage children to participate in mark making and counting. 
However, we introduce them to the idea if they are interested but we don't push 
them. We do a letter and sounds programme to introduce them to sounds, 
alteration, rhyming and rhythm but it’s more important to work on their PSE 

 
108
development with listening, understanding and communication skills, before 
expecting them to recognise numbers and letters. [Survey data] 
Whilst activities linked to more instrumental skills and knowledge were reported to be 
done regularly, child-initiated play was also offered on a daily basis by the majority of 
respondents, as well as singing, creative activities, messy play and other playful 
provision.  Only three respondents stated that children did not get any opportunity 
for free play, and all children were provided with opportunities for outside play with 
140 respondents reporting this to be daily.   
Social Adjustment 
Attributes linked to social adjustment were referred to extensively throughout the 
data when respondents were asked to list three things they thought of when 
presented with the 'school readiness' agenda.  Social skills such as sharing, taking 
turns, interacting, forming friendships, and solving conflict were highlighted, alongside 
independence, being able to separate from the main carer, and emotional maturity.  
As can be seen in Table 17, statements within this category were perceived to be much 
more important than the previous category, particularly those linked with interacting 
and playing co-operatively with other children, and being able to follow directions 
given to them by an adult.

This was also reiterated in the table that ranked the categories in order of importance, 
positioning social adjustment as the most important of the six categories.  A number 
of respondents also made reference to Maslow's (1943) Hierarchy of Needs as a model 
for 'school readiness', with one respondent asserting: 
Children are built with a thirst for learning .... this isn't necessarily formal 
academic learning. Personal, emotional and social development is learning too. 
Maslow's hierarchy of learning is an important indicator of school readiness. 
[Survey data] 
Communication and language skills were raised frequently in the qualitative comment 
sections of the questionnaire, and over a third of respondents highlighted the child 
being able to communicate their own needs was an important social skill regarding 
'school readiness'.  A further theme emerging from the comments was the ability to 
sit, listen and concentrate when appropriate.  
Skills 
Skills in the questionnaire mainly focused on basic life and personal skills, and nearly 
80% of respondents stated that being able to go to the toilet independently was either 
extremely or very important, with only two respondents considering it not important 
at all (Table 18).  This was also reflected in the qualitative comments with 33 

 
110
respondents listing toileting, or being toilet trained, as one of the three things they 
linked to 'school readiness'.  Further comments also highlighted the importance of 
self-care and being able to get dressed independently.

A number of respondents commented how academic skills such as writing and 
counting were taught at school and therefore were not an essential prerequisite to 
starting school, and that it is the basic life skills that are important:   
I think too much focus on school readiness seems to be surrounding academic 
things - e.g counting, writing their name, phonics knowledge. In reality, all this 
is taught, learnt and practiced at school. Although it is beneficial that they have 
some knowledge of this when they start school, the key basic life skills are more 
important to know. [Survey data] 
As can be seen in Table 18, holding a pencil, which would be considered a more 
instrumental skill, was deemed as not being important by over a third of respondents, 
with only five respondents believing this skill to be extremely important.  In the 
rankings table, skills were positioned fourth out of the six categories. 
 

 
111
Disposition 
Self-esteem was considered to be either very or extremely important by over 90% of 
the respondents, and an enthusiasm for learning, being happy to go to school, and 
talking positively about school were all seen to be very or extremely important by the 
majority of the survey participants (Table 19).

The dispositions referred to in the qualitative comments included confidence, 
curiosity, eagerness, happiness, and focus.  One respondent stated: 
Having a positive attitude, being interested in learning and being able to 
communicate their feelings appropriately are really important. Academic 
things will come later on if these things are secure. [Survey data] 
Another respondent highlighted how emotional maturity was more important than 
chronological age, and pointed out issues regarding summer born children.   
Emotional age much more important than chronological age. I have children in 
my class who are younger but are much more mature emotionally than some 
of my older children and have coped much better with the transition to school. 
Saying that, on the WHOLE my older children are more emotionally mature 
than the younger ones, and it is generally my younger summer born children 
who still occasionally struggle to cope with being at school. [Survey data] 
The disposition of the child was ranked as being the second most important category 
around 'school readiness'.  However, overall more people saw statements linked to 
the disposition category as being very or extremely important to those of social 

 
112
adjustment, despite the latter category being placed at the top of the ranking table.  
One explanation for this is that disposition and personal and social skills would often 
be seen as interlinked in an Early Years context. 
Rules 
In this survey rules refer to a child's ability to fit in with school rules and expectations, 
and the statements and responses linked to this category can be seen in Table 20.

Whilst just below 20% of participants considered knowing the rules of the classroom 
and how to take turns and share as extremely important, the majority of respondents 
placed rules as being either somewhat or very important.  In the comments, three 
respondents highlighted how an understanding of boundaries was important from a 
'school readiness' perspective.  Again, a respondent pointed out that rules are 
something that can be taught when children arrive in school, rather than it be an 
expectation prior to them starting school:  
Skills, rules and knowledge can be taught, although it is easier if children are 
independent with regards to self-care. Well-being is something that cannot be 
taught; and if they are not happy in themselves and able to be away from 
parents, they will struggle to pick up the other things. [Survey data] 
The rules category was positioned fifth out of the six categories in the ranking table, 
and deemed less important than social adjustment, disposition, physical and skills.   

 
113
Physical 
The physical category is linked to the physical attributes of the child and includes issues 
around safety, health and age.  Respondents did not consider the physical size of the 
child as being important, but being well rested for school was considered important 
by the majority of participants (Table 21).

The final question on the online survey asked participants to judge whether they 
agreed with a number of statements linked to children being ready for school.  Over 
90% of respondents agreed that age is not a good predictor of 'school readiness' 
(Figure 18) and the majority of respondents believed children could be ready to learn 
but not necessarily ready for school (Figure 19).

Figure 19 - Responses as to whether children can be ready to learn but not ready for

Further qualitative comments also refer to issues around summer born children and 
school starting age:  
I do think the age of the child is very important to consider. There was a young 
girl who started Reception this year who was still 3 (we started 28th August). It 
seemed rather unfair for her to be beginning Reception as she was so young 
and timid. [Survey data] 
Another respondent commented: 
... although I love working in early years, I feel that 4 years old is far too early 
to begin formal education and be assessed against standards ... [Survey data] 
However, over half the respondents agreed that children who did start school before 
they were five, were still able to learn (Figure 20). 
Figure 20 - Responses as to whether children who start school too early do not learn 
 
 

 
115
Other Themes 
Despite omitting questions linked to family/parents and the educational environment 
from the original questionnaire survey, these themes emerged through the qualitative 
comments.  Respondents commented that it was important that families were ready, 
and that parents were educated to ensure their children were ready for school.  One 
respondent highlighted how parents could do this: 
… sharing stories contributes towards listening and attention, encouraging 
imagination and conversation, packing own book bag and carrying it to school 
contributes towards organisation. Praising level ability contributes towards 
confidence and playing games that involve turn taking and rules contribute 
towards sharing and negotiation. [Survey data] 
Another respondent argued that parents should also understand that children do not 
need to be reading and writing on entry into Reception, and that there should be 
“more understanding of the EYFS and what it entails”.  It was also pointed out that 
children learn from birth, and parental upbringing plays “a big part in a child’s 
readiness for school.”  A final salient point is the importance of the parent’s 
knowledge about their child’s needs, and that there needs to be a “balance of parent-
teacher knowledge and understanding of the child and their learning.” 
A further theme that emerged from the survey data was the belief that children are 
exposed to “too much, too soon”.  Respondents highlighted how there were “too 
many objectives to cover for children so young” and “too much emphasis on meeting 
targets.”  One respondent argued “Our country is great at finding out what children 
can't do at seven and think the answer is to make them do it younger” with another 
stating “It should be about the child and working towards them having a happier time 
in school.”  Schools being “ready for the child” was another point raised by 
respondents, as well as ensuring there were “quality transitions”. 
Presentation of the Findings of the Interviews 
For this section, all five interviews were analysed with a clear focus on highlighting the 
teachers’ beliefs about ‘school readiness’ (Diagram 7).  I examined the interview 

 
116
transcripts and highlighted aspects of the data that pinpointed these beliefs and then 
arranged the key points thematically to structure the findings discussion.  
Diagram 7 - Summary of interview data 
 
The lack of clear definition regarding 'school readiness' was highlighted early on in the 
interviews, with Mary, Sarah and Emma commenting on their confusion over whether 
the research was focusing on transition into Year One, or into Reception.  
Conversely, Rosa stated that she thought it was the transition into "formal education”.  
The following comments highlight this confusion: 
When you first said you were coming I wasn't sure whether you meant entry to 
Reception and in fact I assumed that's what you did mean when you first came, 
then I quickly realised that actually you were talking about the transition from 
Reception to Year One .... so yes .... that was quite interesting that I assumed 
that it was a different way. [1st interview - Sarah] 
Before we started talking about it for this project my interpretation of school 
readiness would have been pre-Reception school readiness so thinking about 
children's experiences before they start in Reception. [1st interview - Michelle] 
I see it as being from home into Reception [Interview - Emma] 
... are children ready to start formal education and obviously what the 
expectations are [Interview - Rosa] 
Sarah went on to point out that as, a school, there is not much discussion around the 
readiness of children going into Year One, and the focus was on children who were 
coming into Reception: 
… as a school, we've not talked that much about the readiness of Year One 
other than the Reception environment needs adapting to some degree .... but 
a lot of our focus ....  because of the fact we're trying to get the maintained 
nursery provision .... a lot of our focus was on are they ready to come .... 
actually come through the door of school .... [1st interview - Sarah]

A key theme that emerged from all interviews was the importance of communication, 
language and understanding, and the ability to be able to follow instructions and talk 
to adults and peers.  Sarah made the point that these skills were a prerequisite for 
doing phonics and learning letter sounds stating: 
... before you can even think about showing them symbols and letters and 
sounds and actually getting them to write, they've got to be able to articulate 
it before they can learn what it looks like so to speak .... [1st interview - Sarah]     
This was echoed by Claire, the Nursery teacher and member of the SMT, who stated: 
... well-developed communication really .... whether it’s verbal or non-verbal 
and all of those .... the understanding .... you know .... all the elements of it 
really because if they don't that's when you get the behaviour issues and then 
that becomes a barrier to learning and I think that's absolutely key [Interview 
- Claire]   
Both Year One teachers, Rosa and Emma, also highlighted an expectation that children 
should be able to communicate effectively on entry into Reception: 
 ... to be able to speak, so that you can clearly understand what they are saying 
.... I would expect them to be able to ask a question .... and to be able to 
communicate obviously how they are feeling .... [Interview - Emma] 
Mary spoke a lot about children's experiences before coming to school, reiterating 
throughout the interview the importance of children being taken to different places 
and exposed to new ideas and activities: 
It's their experience ... what the parents have perhaps done with them ... 
whether they have had a sheltered life up until coming to school or whether 
they have been to every play session, visits to the library ... trips to the park ... 
parents that talk to them about everything that happens ... that sort of enables 
them to be school ready .... [1st interview - Mary] 
Sarah also specified she believed that the ability to hold a pencil and having some 
understanding of basic counting and number skills was important on entry into 
Reception.  Mary focused more on personal and social skills, and the importance of 
children being able to separate from the main carer and settle quickly into the routine, 
maintaining it was important to ensure basic skills were in place before more formal 
skills were taught: 

 
118
.... those are the basics before we start to then look at perhaps school 
expectations of .... recognising and writing your name ... numbers ... those 
things are great but you kind of need all the other things in place first before 
moving onto those ... [1st interview - Mary] 
Claire re-enforced the importance of personal and social skills and argued that if these 
were not in place on entry into Reception then time would be spent teaching these 
skills, stating:  
... when you've got 60 children arriving in Reception and they haven't got those 
skills that’s when everything becomes very difficult ... you spend a lot of your 
time then doing that where really you know you could be pushing on the 
learning ... [Interview - Claire]   
Independence in self-care was also prominent in the interviews with the Reception 
teachers, with Mary stating that children need to able to toilet themselves 
independently, get dressed and undressed and feed themselves at lunchtime. 
When asked what skills children needed for the transition into Year One, Sarah focused 
on formal skills such as being able to recognise sounds, write words and sentences, 
number bonds to ten and an idea of addition and subtraction, with children working 
at a higher level being able to double and share.  Mary spoke of how children needed 
to be independent, particularly when working on formal writing and Mathematical 
tasks, and to be able to self-regulate their behaviour during carpet time: 
... they are very independent in doing the things that they want to do, for 
example, making something in the creative area they can go off and do that ... 
but for example ... if it was to complete a piece of writing ... we talk about the 
ideas but we still have children coming back asking 'what do I do next?' or 'how 
do I do that?' and so it’s working on developing those independent skills ... [1st 
interview - Mary] 
Interestingly, Sarah talked about the children having the personal and social skills to 
support each other as they moved into the different learning environment of Year One: 
... they've got the caring aspect as well and I hope they take with them the 
ethos of the class, of the school where it’s ok ... you can make these mistakes 
.... it's ok ... that supportive kind of atmosphere because I think they're going 
to need that if they move to a different environment ... [1st interview - Sarah]  
From the perspective of the Year One teachers, Rosa said she would again expect 
children to be able to communicate, and Emma expressed that she would like children 

 
119
to be able to write a sentence, be able to count to 20 forwards and backwards, and 
practically be able to add one more and take one away, although the children would 
not be expected to record this formally.  Emma based this expectation on what she 
knew Reception children could do already stating:  
I would expect a child to be able to write a sentence coming from Reception 
into Year One ... seeing what I can see is going on in Reception now I would 
expect them to be able to sit down and write a sentence [Interview - Emma] 
Emma also pointed out the curricular gap between Foundation Stage and Key Stage 
One, and how children still struggle with the expectations of Year One in spite of 
achieving the GLD: 
... but given that they had reached such a GLD this cohort, they were expected 
to just fly as soon as they got to Year One but they still find it very difficult ... I 
thought it took a long time before they started to go ... [Interview - Emma] 
Rosa expanded on this, also reiterating what Mary said about children in Reception 
lacking independence in more formal tasks, and explaining how this was problematic 
in Year One: 
Rosa: I think they were just very needy when they came up and like you say the 
writing but obviously once you'd done the phasing in and then you start with 
your recording of things and it was always ... they've always done it in small 
groups in Reception so it’s a big ... so now it’s one adult to 31 children ...  
Emma: ... And having to work independently was a big ask for them [Interview 
- Emma/Rosa] 
Concluding Comments 
The results of the survey have highlighted some of the issues being faced by the wider 
Early Childhood Community regarding 'school readiness'.  Personal and social skills, 
and the disposition of the child, are considered to be a foundation for starting school 
and the ability to access learning opportunities.  Whilst skills around personal care 
were desirable, instrumental skills and knowledge were seen to be something that was 
taught at school rather than a prerequisite for 'school readiness'.  Respondents 
expressed concerns around summer born children and the "too much, too soon" 
agenda, and the responsibility of the school to be 'child ready'.   The interview data 
reiterated the importance of communication and language as a fundamental 

 
120
foundation for learning, but also problematised the gap between Reception and Year 
One, which will be discussed in more depth later. 
How are Reception Children Prepared for Year One? 
The originally intended question for this section was 'How is 'school readiness' 
constructed within the Reception classroom?’  However, upon analysing the data it 
became clear that, for the teachers, the focus was not on 'school readiness' but rather 
'preparing' children for Year One.  This was highlighted early on in the interview with 
Sarah who explained how the term 'school readiness' was not used in the school 
environment: 
I probably came across it most when I was training ... so you know talking about 
getting these children ready to be able to access the National Curriculum ... 
there was a lot of talk around that ...  but since I've come to actual work in a 
school it's not really been mentioned actually ... we don't talk about it ... we 
talk a lot about readiness for Year One, but it’s not necessarily classed as school 
readiness ... it's always this big preparation for them to get into Year One [1st 
interview - Sarah]   
As will be discussed later, this encompassed the expectations of the GLD, but there 
was also a lot of discussion around preparing the children emotionally for the 
environmental transition.     
For this part of the analysis, I examined the two individual interviews with Mary and 
Sarah (Reception teachers) and the final group interview with both teachers.  I also 
considered the photographic evidence used as an aide-memoire, and drew on some 
observations and reflective conversations that had taken place during the course of 
the research.  Specific examples of activities undertaken to prepare children for Year 
One were thematically drawn from the data to build a picture of how children are 
prepared for Year One. 
Formal Skills 
Sarah explained how phonics is carried out every morning and the children do guided 
reading in groups rather than 1 - 1.  Children participate in Read, Write, Inc. which is 
vertically streamed to ensure ability needs are being met and to provide challenge.  

 
121
Cursive writing is taught from Reception onwards as it was recognised further up the 
school that handwriting was an issue when external assessors could not read children's 
handwriting.  Examples of cursive writing from two children can be seen in the 
following images: 
Image 1 - Example of cursive writing in the handwriting book (Child A)

Image 3 - Example of cursive writing in the handwriting book (Child B) 
 
 
 

 
123
Image 4 - Example of cursive writing in the handwriting book (Child B) 
 
 
As can also be seen in the following photographs, the books the children are using 
have narrow lines, and are the type that they would have to use in Year One.  During 
a conversation with Sarah, she told me how the Year One teacher had introduced these 
books to all the children when she was covering the Reception class, as a way of 
preparing the children for Year One.  During the spring term, teaching staff had been 
moved around the school to accommodate the training needs of a student teacher, 
but this was also seen by the SMT as a way of Sarah moving into Nursery to prepare 
the children for Reception, and for the Year One teacher to prepare the children for 
transition into Year One.  Another strategy introduced to Reception in preparation 
for Year One was the ‘early edit’.  Children were introduced to the idea of identifying 
what needs to be improved in their work, as a way of focusing on their writing.  The 
teacher feeds back on the children’s writing and boxes are used so children can correct 
errors in their writing, demonstrated in the following images:

Regarding the teaching of Mathematics, Mary pointed out that this was done very 
practically, and reflected in the continuous provision in the classroom.  Sarah re-
iterated this stating: 
... Maths is very much like a carousel kind of structured activities but some are 
open ended, some are with a teacher, some are independent it just depends on 
how many staff we have and what the children need do at that particular time.  
[Final interview - Sarah] 
The shift towards more formal teaching was also discussed in more depth in the 
interviews, where Sarah commented that there is more continuous provision in the 
Autumn term than the summer, and Mary describing the summer term as “more 
formalised”. 
Sarah spoke at length about the ‘Band’ system that was used in Key Stage One and 
Two as part of a whole school approach to assessment after levels were scrapped by 
the Government.  She pointed out how what was previously considered to be Level 
2 criteria had been shifted into Band 1, and how the gap between Reception and Year 
One had widened due to these changes.  Sarah discussed how conversations with the 
Year One teacher had highlighted the need for children to be able to form their 
numbers correctly to prepare them for Year One, despite this not being a requirement 
for the ELG in Mathematics:   
... they've always had to write numbers but the fact that they can't be reversed 
is quite a significant one and it’s one that we're really struggling to hit because 
your top children in Maths still get 5 the wrong way around ... It’s a common 
mistake ... but to me that's irrelevant [1st interview - Sarah]  
Mary highlighted how a lot of time was spent ensuring children were able to structure 
sentences in their writing, writing on lines, and using the correct punctuation.  She 
also went on to add: 
... the formation of the writing which does all need to come but which would 
have perhaps previously been more of a Year One skill ... now we are preparing 
them throughout Reception, particular this summer term so when they get into 
Year One and they can hit the ground running and they are straight into it with 
their writing ... [1st interview - Mary]  
 

 
127
Interventions 
Both teachers talked of the close monitoring of children and regular tracking of 
children’s levels and using timetabled interventions as a way of targeting children 
facing difficulties in specific areas of the curriculum.  Mary described how a group of 
EAL children had interventions based on developing their spoken language but also to 
work on their comprehension.  Intervention strategies were also used for children 
struggling with pencil control, letter formation and name writing, as well as 
Mathematical interventions that focused on recognising numbers and matching 
number to quantity: 
... we've spent a long time this year for a lot of the children just actually getting 
them to recognise number and match the correct quantity to a number ... and 
for a long time it felt like a real uphill battle, but actually now we've moved 
away from that slightly and look at practical addition and subtraction and that 
does seem to have clicked into place quite quickly with them ... [1st interview - 
Mary] 
Read, Write, Inc. was also used as an intervention strategy for children who were 
“really struggling” as Sarah stated: 
 ... the main one or the one that we've timetabled in the staffing timetable is 
the Read, Write, Inc. intervention because we've got quite a lot of children ... 
we've got group at the bottom that are really struggling ... they are SEN, they 
are EAL ... most of them aren't they ... but we try to just push it ... but it’s not 
just those that we are targeting but they are the main ones that we are 
concerned about ... [Final interview - Sarah] 
Sarah also highlighted how the extra timetabled interventions that took place for the 
targeted children were “quite often at the expense” of the continuous provision on 
offer in the classroom. 
Preparing Children for the Transition  
During the final interview both teachers spent some time discussing how they 
prepared children mentally and emotionally for the transition into Year One.  The 
teachers describe how they have talked to the children about the similarities and 
differences between Reception and Year One and taking the children to visit the 
classroom when the current Year One class is doing PE:   

 
128
... they were quite keen to look for those similarities ... so oh we've still got the 
phonics ... oh they have numbers in here just like we have ... so I said yes there 
are some things in here that you will see that are familiar and ... ooo ... a book 
corner and look at the books they have in their book corner ... you'll have some 
lovely new stories to read and you'll still have story time ... and just try and 
focus on the positives and all the things they can take that are the same [Final 
interview - Mary] 
The teachers also talked about how they explained to the children that there is not 
much play and freedom in Year One, and showing children the seats that they would 
sit in to do their work with the teacher:    
... when we did go and have a sit in the classroom and have a look around I 
made a point of saying to them ... look around you ... what sorts of things do 
you see ... do you see a sand tray ... do you see painting area ... no, we don't 
because we don't have those things on offer all the time ... [Final interview - 
Mary] 
Sarah described how some of the children had expressed anxiety over going to work 
with a new teacher and had asked if Sarah could go with them to Year One.  Both 
Mary and Sarah talked about how they used circle times to talk through these 
anxieties and “put them to rest”: 
... you're going to have a really good time in Year One and now is your 
opportunity to ask any questions ... and if I don't know the answer I'll go and 
ask in Year One and if I do know the answer I'll tell you ... and it's OK to feel 
nervous but it is OK to feel a bit excited as well .... and after that they were OK. 
[Final interview - Sarah] 
Both teachers said the children were excited to go into Year One, but there was 
“trepidation” [Sarah] and “lots of questions” [Mary] that they dealt with to prepare 
the children emotionally for the transition. 
The final question of the final interview I asked Sarah and Mary what their own 
personal beliefs were regarding how ‘school readiness’ is constructed within the 
classroom.  Mary highlighted the importance of getting children used to routines and 
“school life”, separating from their main carer, and having the opportunity to explore 
whilst getting used to doing a full day in school before moving onto more formal 
learning environment.  Sarah described how, for her, it was more “the emotional 
side” stating: 

 
129
... it's the construction of the personality ... like pulling out their personality ... 
It’s the stuff that you don't have to do that they need to be able to kind of 
survive ... pulling out their personality ... finding their emotions ... knowing how 
to deal with stuff ... [Final interview - Sarah] 
Mary agreed specifying that this was an important foundation for learning and if this 
resilience was not in place then children were not going to be able to learn the 
instrumental skills such as “recognising numbers” or “writing a story”. 
Sarah pointed out again the importance of communication, and how this would be a 
prerequisite to any ELG.  She also pointed out how some aspects of personal and 
social development are not included in the EYFS pointing out “there’s so much more 
to being in school than following the EYFS”: 
 ... you know the child ... you know the story and you know how much of an 
achievement it is for them but because it doesn't fit into that box it’s not useless 
but it’s useless for somebody else looking at it ... but it's actually very valid. 
[Final interview - Sarah] 
Mary expanded on this adding: 
... but in order for the child to achieve the GLD they do have to have got that 
PSED side and that Communication and Language ... they're not just getting 
that GLD because they've got the Maths and Literacy ... they do have to have 
those other things ... so we do have to make sure that the children are well-
rounded [Final interview - Mary]   
To summarise, it is clear from the findings that there is a focus on formal skills, 
particular writing, to prepare children for Year One, and interventions are used to help 
those children struggling to achieve the outcomes.  However, there is also a 
concerted effort to prepare the children emotionally for the environmental transition 
into Year One, as well as the curricular transition.  The next section will explore 
contradictions in the data as a way of identifying tensions between beliefs and practice 
regarding the ‘school readiness’ agenda.

What Contradictions are there Between Teacher Beliefs and 
Practice? 
Manifestations of Contradictions as an Analytical Framework  
Here I take inspiration from Engeström and Sannino’s (2011) work on discursive 
manifestations of contradictions which moves away from the tendency to define 
contradictions as competing priorities that need to be rebalanced (p.369).  They 
argue that contradictions do not ‘speak for themselves’ but rather emerge when 
participants ‘articulate them in words and actions’ (p.371).  Contradictions are not 
'observed directly', but are 'identified through their manifestations' (p.369).  
Therefore, the suggested framework begins with the analysis of ‘rudimentary linguistic 
cues that potentially express discursive manifestation’, followed with the identification 
and analysis of the actual manifestation from the data (p.370).  As a way of analysing 
the interview data, Engeström and Sannino (2011) present four types of 
manifestations of contradiction that are identified using specific linguistic clues 
(p.375), summarised in Table 22.

As has already been discussed in the previous chapter, five interviews were carried 
out: two initial interviews with the Reception teachers, one interview with the Nursery 
teacher who was also a member of the SMT, a group interview with the Year One 

 
131
teachers and a final group interview with the Reception teachers.  This was a useful 
exercise in order to gain a wider understanding of teacher beliefs about what 'school 
readiness' is.  However, for the purpose of this analysis I am going to focus on 
exploring the contradictions between beliefs and practices in the Reception classroom 
regarding the 'school readiness' agenda. 
As a starting point for the analysis of discursive manifestations of contradictions, the 
quantitative distribution of the specified linguistic clues was examined, the results of 
which are displayed in Table 23.

The linguistic clues for the ‘dilemmas’ category was highlighted in the text using the 
'find' function for occurrences of the word “but” in the word processing software.  In 
order to identify conflicts, double binds and critical conflicts the interview data was 
carefully examined in more detail, and each segment of text linked to the specified 
linguistic clues was highlighted using different colours as a way of thematically 
identifying relevant sections for later analysis.  It was during this stage that a critical 
approach was taken, and occurrences of the linguistic clues that did not correspond 
to the four categories of discursive manifestations of contradictions were disregarded. 
Each interview was analysed in turn as a way of becoming very familiar with the data, 
and when all four categories had been applied, the data was interrogated again in 
order to identify common themes emerging, summarised in Table 24.

readiness’ that create tensions for teachers in the classroom which will be explored in 
more depth in the next chapter.  The following section will use the themes that 
emerged from this analysis to frame the findings discussion. 
Curriculum and Outcomes 
One of the main themes emerging from the data analysis across all three interviews 
were issues around the EYFS curriculum and the expected outcomes linked to the GLD 
as a measure of ‘school readiness’.  Alongside these outcomes, it was found that 
pressures being pushed down from above also had an impact on pedagogical 
considerations in the classroom, as well as efforts to try to ‘bridge the gap’ between 
Reception and Year One.  
The Good Level of Development 
Sarah discussed at length her frustration with the GLD and how the Mathematics and 
Literacy outcomes often meant children did not achieve this benchmark, despite 
achieving the ELGs for the prime areas of the curriculum.  She talked about how she 
believed Reception should focus on the prime areas of the curriculum and made the 
point that children may achieve the outcomes for Literacy, for example, but the 
importance should be placed on the “basic skills”.  Mary gave an example of a child 
in her class who was very capable but due to her pencil control struggles to write and 
therefore will not meet the GLD: 
... we've got some children who are very good with their PSE but ... good 
relationships within class ... well behaved ... good communication skills ... orally 
could give you lots and lots of answers but ... when it comes to then looking at 
perhaps the writing side of things ... really, really struggle ... I can think of one 
little girl in particular in my class who ... she ticks all the boxes for her gross 
motor skills ... her pencil has got real issues with ... that side of her 
development, you know is a bit of a concern at the moment ... but ticks all the 
boxes for other areas ... orally comes across very well ... very bright ... but on 
paper ... it wouldn't look that way because she's going to struggle to achieve a 
GLD for writing. [1st interview - Mary] 

 
135
Sarah went on to describe how she had children with EAL and SEN who are not going 
to meet the GLD and how she upset she was having to inform parents that their 
children would not meet the expected level of development: 
Well we've got EAL children in my class who are just not going to get there and 
I had to put this to parents last night and the devastation that this causes, I felt 
awful ... there were a few parents ... oh my goodness you’re going to leave me 
in tears because I'm having to share this information with them ... so EAL 
children, SEN children, children with Speech and Language difficulties, children 
with social communication disorder .... you know the ones I'm talking about ... 
they're just not going to get it. [1st interview - Sarah] 
Mary highlighted how some children will have exceeded in some areas, and gave the 
example of children who were “very creative”, yet who might not get “grouped in with 
the GLD” because it does not fall under the area of learning used to measure the GLD.  
Sarah also expressed her annoyance at the omission of Expressive Arts and Design and 
Understanding of the World, asking “do they not matter? ... Have we not got room for 
that?”  However, Mary stressed that even though this was not part of the GLD, it was 
still important as a way of considering “the whole child”, and Sarah asserted how they 
“still always ensure the creative side of children's development takes place”.  It was 
also pointed out how some areas of Personal, Social and Emotional development had 
been missed off the curriculum, and how some observations did not link to any of the 
statements, leading Sarah to declare “there's so much more to being in school than 
just following the EYFS”.    
Sarah also conveyed her irritation with the way assessment data is used by the Local 
Authority, and the questioning of any “anomalous results”, stating: 
... and I'm not about data I hate it ... I think a lot of teachers do ... but somebody 
flies in and starts picking your data apart but hang on a minute ... they've got 
... You’re telling me they can speak, they can do this that and the other, but 
they can't read ... yeah ... I am ... [1st interview - Sarah] 
She went on to discuss how she had “fought” to defend the data and her assessment 
of where children were up to regarding the GLD, and describes how “sometimes I’ve 
won, sometimes I haven’t”.  The number of children achieving the GLD nationally was 
also raised as a contentious issue: 

 
136
... if I made that curriculum and only 54% of children were achieving that I'd be 
thinking that there's something wrong here ... [1st interview - Sarah] 
In the final interview, Sarah re-iterated this frustration with the data asserting that 
children were more than a number and the journey they have been on is not always 
reflected in the end result: 
... because you know the child ... you know the child ... you know the story and 
you know how much of an achievement it is for them but because it doesn't fit 
into that box it’s not useless but it’s useless for somebody else looking at it ... 
but it's actually very valid [Final interview - Sarah] 
Top Down Pressures 
Another theme that emerged throughout the data was the gap between Reception 
and the GLD and the curricular expectations of Year One.  Sarah pointed out how if a 
child achieves the GLD, the transition to Year One would be much easier, but due to 
the curricular expectations of Year One, there is still a gap: 
 I think it’s probably more beneficial for the child if they do achieve the GLD 
and it’s probably easier to access the curriculum in Year One but I don't think 
it’s the be all and all ... there is still a bridge to go across to get to Year One 
whether you get a GLD or you don't ... so I think it does help if you do. [1st 
interview - Sarah] 
Sarah used the analogy of a bridge a number of times when describing the transition 
into Year One during the interview.  Later on, she described the difficulties faced by 
children who do not reach the GLD: 
 ... there is a bridge to go across whether you achieve the ELG or not but if you 
don't the bridge is just so much bigger and you’re constantly trying to play 
catch up, and because our Year One is so formalised I know that quickly they 
are going to drop behind ... [1st interview - Sarah] 
Sarah also explained how these children would be targeted for interventions during 
the two-week transition period in Year One at the expense of experiencing the 
continuous provision that was on offer in the classroom.  This was further 
exacerbated by the fact that the groups of children who do not achieve the GLD also 
do not cope well with changes to their environment and how that could “hinder their 
progress”. 

 
137
Tensions were also highlighted between the expectations of the GLD, and the gap 
between these and the curricular expectations of the banding system further up the 
school.  Sarah spoke at length about how these were sometimes being pushed down 
from Year One into Reception, particularly with aspects of writing, such as number 
formation.  Despite this not being an ELG, she was being asked to ensure children 
could write the numbers correctly in order to meet the curricular outcomes of Year 
One: 
... I need to get them where ... a GLD ... where some people tell me I should 
have them ... but it’s that added stuff now ... as well as trying to reach the GLD 
your having to then address some of the issues ... some of the things we're 
finding in the band system in Year One [1st interview - Sarah] 
Frustrations over the needs for compliance within this context are clearly expressed 
by Sarah who attests: 
... we're all wrapped up in this world where we've got to do it like this, or we've 
got to do it like that ... when actually in your heart of hearts you probably 
wouldn't do it like that if you had a choice ... [1st interview - Sarah] 
Mary discussed how in the summer term, much more emphasis was placed on writing 
as a way of ensuring the children “hit the ground running” in preparation for Year One, 
but also raised the point that this would have “previously been more of a Year One 
skill”.  Sarah re-enforced this argument and talked about how expectations changed 
over the year: 
... so, your writing when you first come in ... you know you're expecting possibly 
initial sounds if you’re lucky but you're happy with whatever they can do ... if 
there’s a mark on the paper it’s cause for celebration but by the time they get 
to the summer term I'm expecting punctuation and stories even ... I suppose 
the aim is to get them to that exceeding statement if we can do ... we kind of 
lessen the gap between Reception and Year One [Final interview - Sarah] 
However, Mary does describe how, for some children, it is important to take a step 
back and “let them just enjoy holding a pencil” and being successful at simply making 
marks on the paper.  She asserts that children should be: 
... praised for what they can do, no matter what sized line it's on ... because for 
some children it's just holding the pencil and getting something that looks like 
the letters on the page ... that is a real achievement ... [Final interview - Mary] 

 
138
As has already been discussed, cursive writing is taught from Reception and Sarah 
spoke a lot about the challenges faced when implementing this strategy.  She 
explained how it had been flagged that children’s handwriting in lower Key Stage Two 
could not be read by the external examiners, and so a whole school approach to 
writing had been adopted.  Sarah was reticent about this, declaring “I don’t know the 
pros and cons of doing it early on ... All I know is it is hard work”, and how, if she had 
a choice, she would not do it in Reception as it is “just one added thing”.  However, 
there were clear tensions here as she pointed out she had seen it work for some 
children, and it did seem to improve writing further up the school.  She also talked 
about how she was “a bit torn”, as some of the children did manage to do the cursive 
writing, and this was seen by the rest of the school to be a validation that it was an 
effective strategy to use from Reception upwards: 
I produce 27 books maybe 20 of which have got a pretty good attempt at 
cursive writing at the book scrutiny ... well they're doing it in Reception ... 
brilliant, they can do it in Reception so carry on ... so I'm making a rod for my 
own back really by producing these books that are quite ... that are pretty good 
and they are showing some understanding of cursive writing and I'm having to 
carry it on because I've shown that they can do it [1st interview - Sarah] 
Despite this being a “strict” requirement in Reception, Sarah did clarify that if children 
really could not manage to do the cursive script she did waiver but for those who were 
capable she could accept nothing else.  She talked how this was “non-negotiable” 
and how she “did fight it but lost”. 
Impact on Pedagogy 
Pressures from above, and the need to ensure children reach the GLD, both had an 
impact on pedagogy and practice in the classroom.  Mary and Sarah spoke about the 
importance of play, and how children’s interests were followed as a way of engaging 
children, with Mary asserting it was a way of “building key skills” such as “confidence 
and independence”.  However, Sarah described how the more instrumental skills, 
like “cursive writing and sentence building” were easier to achieve through a “more 
formalised way of teaching”, and argued “it does change the way you do things 
because of the fact you are held to account”.  She also asserted how much 
knowledge children gained through play, and how this could be carried through to 

 
139
Year One, but that it is “difficult to translate into a Year One environment”.  She went 
onto express further frustrations about the drastic pedagogical shift faced by children 
as they transitioned into Year One: 
It kind of takes away the individuality doesn't it in Year One ... but then if they 
have developed that through their play in Reception then you would hope they 
would take some it with them into Year One ... it would translate better if they 
learnt the same way in Year One ... if they could explore in Year One in a similar 
way it would be a lot more seamless wouldn't it ... if they continued to build on 
the skills that they'd already got in Reception ... it's almost like two steps 
forward and one step back isn't it? ... it's just that complete and utter change. 
[1st interview - Sarah] 
Mary also talked about how the continuous provision was still on offer throughout the 
year but in the summer term, the continuous provision is used as a way of targeting 
groups to complete specific activities linked to curricular outcomes: 
... we would look at the overview of observations and see where the gaps are 
so we need to make sure that we've got a particular type of activity out and we 
need to make sure there’s an adult on that activity to draw children into it 
rather than it be an activity that children would access as they wished. [Final 
interview - Mary]   
Sarah was also mindful of feeling the need to have to constantly be looking for the 
“next step, the next stage” stating:  
It does get quite tiresome sometimes because sometimes I just want to sit in 
the classroom and just watch what they're doing and you feel a bit guilty doing 
that don't you, because you don't feel like you're doing anything but actually 
you're taking that raw view ... I just ... just sometimes I just think ... you know 
what I just want to get into your world and play with you but without having 
to think where we are going next [1st interview - Sarah] 
Pressure 
Both teachers referred to “pressure” across all three interviews, from their own 
perspectives, but also the pressures that were placed on children to achieve the GLD 
and be prepared for Year One.  This was articulated by Sarah who, when asked what 
had influenced her beliefs about ‘school readiness’, replied that it was “what you’ve 
got to achieve in such a short space of time ... I think it’s the pressure really”.  She 
went on to explain the importance of ensuring children achieved the GLD, made more 

 
140
difficult when children were coming into Reception from a number of different 
settings: 
 ... you've got all this ground to make it up ... and all the time you're thinking 
GLD ... I've got to get these children to achieve a GLD for the school ... it also 
becomes part of your performance management ... you've got a certain 
percentage to fall in line with ... the authority are putting the pressure on ... 
there is a lot of pressure from a whole host of different places ... you've got to 
get these children ready for Year One ... it’s bandied about all the time [1st 
interview - Sarah] 
It was highlighted how these pressures were compounded by the importance placed 
on the GLD by the SMT as an indicator of the school’s performance.  However, Sarah 
pointed out that pressure coming from SMT was unintentional, explaining: 
... it’s that GLD that always pops up ... what do you think?  Do you think we're 
going to get there? ... it’s a reflection that the school has done well .... and it’s 
not that they don't care about the individual children it’s just they are so hung 
up on statistics sometimes all you see is numbers ... [1st interview - Sarah] 
She went onto empathise with the culture of performativity that teachers and 
headteachers are working within, discussing how a poor set of results can trigger an 
OfSTED inspection, but also stressed that the approach taken by the SMT was 
“supportive” and “in celebration” of what the children can do rather than being 
“negative”. 
As has already been discussed, pressure also trickles down from Year One, but again, 
both teachers understood where this came from and articulated how Year One 
teachers also have their own pressures that they have to work with.  Mary reflected 
on this stating: 
... I can understand why pressures are being put on to get them ready for Year 
One because Year One then have the pressures to get ready for Year Two and 
so on and it follows all through school doesn't it ... those expectations ...  [1st 
interview - Mary] 
However, it was also discussed how these pressures can also start to have an impact 
on the children.  Sarah talked about how children were expected to be a “certain 
way” and described how she felt she was “railroading” them, and “pushing” them into 
the categories of the GLD.  She summarised this tension, stating: 

 
141
... It’s very prescriptive and I think children aren't like that, are they?  They 
need to be allowed to be ... whatever ... without being over clichéd ... be the 
person that they're going to be ... [1st interview - Sarah] 
Time was another pressure that was discussed throughout the interviews, clearly 
articulated by Sarah who explained: 
... the biggest challenge is the sheer amount of stuff you've got to get through 
... again I'm not trying to make excuses but because they come in so low you've 
got an awful lot of ground to cover ... time is a big restriction and ... just ... the 
sheer amount of stuff you've got to get in, in such a short space of time. [1st 
interview - Sarah] 
She went onto to describe how the lack of time restricted the “spontaneous kind of 
learning” that she believed was best placed in Reception, and voiced her sadness 
about being “being bound to these statistics” and the expectation of the GLD.  She 
also raised concerns over children being aware of “the need and drive” behind the 
curricular outcomes, and talked about how some of them “will crumble” and get 
“upset and really stressed out about writing sometimes”.  Sarah was clear that she 
believed children felt the pressure of the preparations for Year One, highlighting an 
overt tension when she stated: 
I do think they feel the pressure ... because they ... it’s hard not to share it 
sometimes isn't it ... they know what they've got to do ... they know there’s a 
high expectation which is good in a way because they will rise to it, but at the 
same time the expectation is coming from the pressure that is on me that they 
do feel sometimes ... [1st interview - Sarah] 
She re-iterated how children felt the pressure and the expectations, and the difficulty 
of achieving the GLD, particularly in Literacy and Mathematics, and how she would 
not place as much emphasis on these skills if they were “allowed more time”. 
Children as Individuals 
Throughout the interviews, both participants spoke about children as being 
individuals rather than an homogenous group, and identified how practice was 
differentiated to meet the needs of the children.  Problems arose when children 
came into Reception from a number of different settings, or perhaps having no prior 
experience of being separated from their main carer and being in a school 

 
142
environment.  Sarah talked about having “a lot of ground to make up” when children 
were entering Reception without basics such as “counting skills” and 
“communication” in place already.  Mary referred to this as a “real uphill battle” and 
the work that was required to get them to a “level playing field”, whilst Sarah referred 
to having “all this ground to make up”.  It was clear the level children entered 
Reception at had a knock-on effect on the outcomes that were expected for the GLD.  
Sarah summarised this by stating: 
... It would make it easier if they could ... you could start a lot further up then 
couldn't you ... with those basic skills ... so you could start where you need to 
start really ... moving them on. [1st interview - Sarah] 
... you've got to have a starting point haven't you ... I know you've got an end 
point but sometimes your starting point and your end point are a lot further 
apart than others aren't they ... [Final interview - Sarah] 
Sarah also discussed how some children come into Reception not being able to speak 
any English but were “still expected to reach the same end point as everybody else”. 
In spite of these issues, there appears to be a pragmatic approach that was adopted 
by both teachers when working with this diverse group of children.  Sarah talked 
about how some children were not yet accessing the Read, Write, Inc. phonics scheme 
and how at that particular point in time there was “no point even trying” as the 
children were not up to that level.  She went on to explain how, for these children, it 
was still very much about building on skills through play and accessing things on 
“whatever level they are working at” asserting “if they are not ready for sounds ... they 
are not ready ... It’s as simple as that”.  Mary talked a lot about the “whole child” and 
looking at the “whole picture” rather than focusing on what children could not do in 
terms of Literacy and Mathematics.  She talked about how teaching ultimately came 
down to “the individual child within the class” and how approaches need to be 
adapted “depending on the child”, for those needing more support as well as those 
needing more challenge.  Sarah related this to the difficulties faced by some children 
to reach the Literacy outcomes declaring: 
... obviously two sentences aren’t going to cut it but if they leave me being able 
to write a sentence having not had any communication or anything ... you know 
we've had to build all those bridges at the beginning and they leave me writing 

 
143
a sentence then I'm happy ... but some of them go on a completely different 
journey and some of them might be writing the sound by the end of Reception 
in which case I'm quite happy ... I suppose it depends where they do arrive ... 
[1st interview - Sarah] 
Regarding preparing children for Year One from a ‘school readiness’ perspective, 
Sarah talked altruistically about the challenges faced as a Reception teacher, stating:  
I don't think any of us are going to give up soon but at the same time you don't 
want to let those children down because if you're not doing enough to get them 
ready or giving them the best chance to be ready it’s not going to help them in 
the future, is it? [1st interview - Sarah] 
Reflecting on my time at the setting, it was clear that focusing on the GLD was seen as 
a way of helping to set the children up to succeed.  Sarah was aware of what the 
children would face going into Year One and did not want it to take them by surprise.  
Ultimately, she was ’playing the game’ for the sake of the children.       
Concluding Comments 
The findings provide an insight into the tensions faced by teachers when data such as 
the GLD is used to measure ‘school readiness’, particularly when children are coming 
into Reception with a wide range of differing experiences, yet are still required to meet 
the same endpoint.  Further pressures are faced when, in addition to the ELGs, Year 
One outcomes are pushed down into Reception as a way of ‘bridging the gap’ between 
the two curriculums.  Dangers of an ever-widening attainment gap are highlighted as 
children start Year One having not achieved the GLD, and are in a constant state of 
playing ‘catch up’ as they move up through the school.  Not surprisingly, the findings 
show that there is an impact on the way the classroom operates, particularly in the 
summer term when children are introduced to more formal teaching practices to 
prepare them for Year One. 
The next chapter will use these findings as a foundation for the discussion, and will 
refer back to the CHAT framework as a way of building on Engeström’s (2001) view 
that activity systems take shape over a period of time.  Furthermore, the history of 
the theoretical and, in the context of this research, the political ideas and tools that 

 
144
have shaped the activity, will help to explain the ‘historically accumulating structural 
tensions within and between activity systems’ (p.137).

Chapter 6  
Discussion 
 
The aim of this thesis was to explore teachers’ beliefs about ‘school readiness’ and 
how ‘school readiness’ is constructed in the Reception classroom.  Building on these 
aims, the study then identified tensions and contradictions between beliefs about 
‘school readiness’, policy frameworks and pedagogical practices.  As a way of 
addressing the social and collective dimensions of teaching practice, Cultural-
Historical Activity Theory was used as a methodological framework that enabled the 
exploration of collective activity and the tensions and contradictions that may emerge 
as part of this process.  Using a qualitative approach, data were collected through the 
use of the Starting School questionnaire (Perry et al., 1998), which was disseminated 
online, and interviews, observations and documentary evidence that took place in one 
school.  This chapter will discuss the findings that emerged from the data analysis, 
and address the final two research questions using the tensions that emerged from 
the activity system to frame the discussion.  The first research question has been 
addressed in Chapter Two as part of the policy analysis, and questions two and three 
have been discussed in Chapter Five, as part of the findings and analysis of the data.

Contradictions within the Activity System 
Building on the discussion that took place in Chapter Three centring on CHAT as a 
research framework, using contradictions as a basis for analysis serves as a way of 
interpreting how teachers develop their practice as they continuously grapple with 

 
146
policy framework accountabilities and classroom activity.  Foot (2014) asserts 
‘Contradictions are not points of failure or deficits in the activity system in which they 
occur. They are not obstacles to be overcome in order to achieve goals. Rather than 
ending points, contradictions are starting places’ (p.17).  For the purpose of this 
research, secondary contradictions within the activity system will be the main focus of 
the discussion as highlighted in Table 25.  Contradictions that have caused 
disturbances and tensions within the activity system are depicted on the diagrams by 
the red two-headed lightning-shaped arrows.

In Chapter Two, I carried out a policy analysis that examined how 'school readiness' 
had come to be seen as a problem for the government, how this is governed through 
policy constructs, and the effects of this formation for teachers and children.  The 
policy analysis highlighted some key discussion points that are summarised as follows: 
1) The key drivers behind the 'school readiness' agenda are to break the cycle 
of poverty at the most 'cost-effective' point in time and to prepare children for 
the formal learning of Year One 
2) This discourse positions 'school readiness' within a narrative of economy 
and is seen as being a predominant factor for the prosperity of society (Osgood, 
2009)   
3) A model of early intervention is a key policy lever in the 'school readiness' 
agenda and is seen as a way of narrowing the attainment gap and reducing the 
burden on social and educational services in the longer term (Brown, C., 2015) 

 
147
4) Within the narrative of economy children are positioned as human capital 
where a return on investments made to ensure a child's 'school readiness' are 
at the forefront of policy (Public Health England, 2015) 
5) Neoliberal ideology permeates ECE policy as England strives to compete on 
the global stage through comparative data collection processes such as PISA, 
PIRLS and TIMSS, and 'school readiness' is seen as way of getting a head start 
in the race to the top 
6) The Good Level of Development is used to measure 'school readiness' and 
is a key component of the accountability and performativity framework within 
which Early Years teachers are situated 
This policy analysis provided the backdrop for the current educational context, and 
highlights how teachers and children are positioned within the 'school readiness' 
agenda.  However, it is argued that when 'school readiness' is framed within policy in 
a deterministic and instrumental way, children are reduced to a checklist of particular 
cognitive and behavioural outcomes which ignore the complexities of their lived 
experiences (Dahlberg et al., 1999).  This discussion will highlight the tensions that 
emerge as the teachers navigate the demands of the GLD as a measure of 'school 
readiness', whilst working on a day to day basis with children with messy and complex 
lives.  To summarise the key findings of the data analysis the following tensions were 
identified and mapped against the supplementary research questions and the activity 
system (Table 26):

Tensions Between the Teacher (Subject), their Beliefs (Tools) and 
the GLD (Object) 
Diagram 9 – Tensions in the Activity System (Subject>Tool>Object) 
 
Hasan and Kazlauskas (2014) declare that ‘In Activity Theory, the relationship between 
subject (human doer) and object (the thing being done) forms the core of an activity' 
(p.9).  Activities are specific, directed towards an object that is to be acted upon with 
a motive and a desired outcome, and any of these facets ‘may be constructed or 

 
149
perceived differently’ by the subject (Foot, 2014, p.10).  This dialectical relationship 
can be both objective and subjective, and in the context of this research clear tensions 
and contradictions have emerged between the subjectivity of teachers and their 
beliefs, working towards the objective way 'school readiness' is measured using the 
GLD (Diagram 9).  This next section explores some of these tensions around what 
teachers believe ‘school readiness’ to be, and how this is managed when considering 
‘school readiness’ as a transitional concept.   
The Complexities of ‘School Readiness’ as a Transitional Concept  
The phrase ‘school readiness’, in itself, raises some interesting points for discussion.  
OfSTED (2014) and the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission (2015) have both 
drawn attention to the lack of clarity regarding the definition of what the phrase 
means, and to which transition it is linked.  Over the course of this research it has 
been questioned numerous times by participants as to whether 'school readiness' 
refers to the transition into Reception, or the transition from Reception into Year One.  
The findings from both the Internet survey and the interviews highlight the confusion 
over what ‘school readiness’ means and to which transition it applies.  It is therefore 
apparent that, despite Kagan (1990) writing about this nearly thirty years ago, the 
issue has not been addressed, and the phrase is still 'mired in confusion with 
practitioners and policymakers advancing widely differing positions regarding it and 
related issues' (p.272).   
The lack of consistency over what ‘school readiness’ means and, of particular 
relevance, which transition it is directly linked to, highlights the need for clarity.  This 
is supported by Bingham and Whitebread (2012) who argue that 'the disagreement 
about terminology and definition encapsulates a fundamental difference in 
conception of the purpose of early years education' as there is no clear agreement as 
to what children are being prepared for (p.4).  Supported by findings from this 
research, a failure to define 'school readiness' results in different interpretations and 
confusion as to what skills are required for children both on entry into Reception as 
the first year of school, and the transition from Reception into Year One.   

 
150
Within the context of this research, the year the study took place was the first year the 
school had had Nursery provision.  Prior to this, children had come from different PVI 
settings, or straight into school from a home context, which had created problems for 
the teachers who were then working with a range of assessment data whilst trying to 
make their own judgements about each child’s attainment.  The lack of consistency 
in the children’s abilities on entry into Reception had placed the emphasis of ‘school 
readiness’ on ensuring children were ready to come through the school door.  
Interpreting ‘school readiness’ as encompassing the skills needed on entry into 
Reception is a logical conclusion for teachers to draw due to the fact that this is seen 
as the first year of ‘school’, and this aligns with Kagan's (1990) construct of 'readiness 
for school' which Scott-Little et al. (2006) assert encompasses the physical, intellectual 
and social skills needed to cope with the school environment (p.273).  However, 
when used in policy discourse in England, ‘school readiness’ refers to the skills required 
to prepare children for the more ‘formal learning’ of Year One and Reception becomes 
a place to ‘ready’ children for school (DfE/DH, 2011; STA, 2016; DfE, 2017a).  This 
construct corresponds with a 'readiness for learning' which Kagan (1990) argues can 
be affected by multiple factors including 'motivation, physical development' 
intellectual ability, emotional maturity, and health (p.273).   
As part of this discussion it is important to explore why the confusion over the term 
'school readiness', and the type of transition it refers to, is of concern.  Both the 
Internet survey and the interviews highlighted how the teachers believed that 
desirable skills for the transition into Reception are centred on social adjustment and 
disposition.  This echoes findings from previous research carried out exploring 
teachers’ beliefs about ‘school readiness’ in the USA which found very few teachers 
naming academic skills, such as counting to twenty and knowing the alphabet, shapes 
and colours as being essential for transition into school.  Rather, the importance of 
social and emotional development, language and communication skills, a confident 
and attentive disposition and independence in the classroom were seen to be 
important attributes for success in school (Lin et al., 2003; Wesley & Buysse, 2003).     
If we then consider how 'school readiness' is located in English policy as the transition 
from Reception into Year One, and the use of the learning outcomes that make up the 

 
151
GLD as a measure of 'school readiness', the skills required become much more 
instrumental than the personal and social skills required on entry into Reception.  
The teachers in my research believed that there was a clear shift towards teaching 
more formal skills such as phonics, Writing, and Mathematical concepts to ready 
children for the transition into Year One.  This supports Wickett’s (2016) argument in 
that there are two distinct transitions, the first being the ‘institutional transition’ from 
home/pre-school settings into the classroom, and the second as the ‘curricular 
transition’ from Reception into Year One.  In this context, the ‘school readiness’ lens 
becomes blurred, which creates a significant problem space as we consider and 
compare the different skills that would be required for the two transitions. Diagram 
10 is presented as a way of visualising the complexities linked to the way 'school 
readiness' is viewed and presented through policy discourse and educational parlance. 
Diagram 10 - Visualising the transitional complexities of 'school readiness' 
 
These complexities can be further problematised when we consider what 'ready to 
learn' means.  Neuro-scientific research offers proof that babies begin to learn before 
they are even born (James, 2010), and therefore the natural correlation is that all 
children are 'ready to learn' as they make the transition into school.  However, within 

 
152
the context of the curricular and assessment frameworks of the EYFS, and the 
emphasis placed on Literacy and Mathematical outcomes, I argue that being 'ready to 
learn' is ascribed to mean the formal and instrumental skills of Mathematics and 
Literacy that are required to meet the GLD.  This is highlighted in a press release by 
the DfE (2015c) entitled More children than ever starting school ready to learn where 
it was asserted:    
As a result of this government’s commitment to higher standards in every 
setting, today’s figures show that an extra 38,600 number of 5-year-olds are 
reaching the expected level of development in maths and literacy, as well as in 
prime areas of personal, social and emotional development, physical 
development and communication and language. 
Referring back to the findings of this study, one of the participants voiced frustrations 
about children not having the necessary personal and social skills to cope with the 
school environment, and how time was wasted working on these when they could 
have been "pushing on with the learning".  This illuminates a key shift in the purpose 
of Reception as the 'transition' year that Tickell (2011) refers to, instead becoming the 
year to ready children for school (or rather the formalities of KS1), and to work towards 
the achievement of the GLD.   
The Good Level of Development as a Measure of ‘School Readiness’ 
The GLD is a summative assessment based on the achievement of the ELGs of five 
areas of learning in the EYFS curriculum: Personal, Social and Emotional Development, 
Physical Development, Communication and Language, Mathematics and Literacy.  
The overall assessment is made up of collated pieces of formative assessment that 
have been collected over the course of the Reception year.  The GLD is then used by 
the government as a way of measuring a child’s ‘school readiness’ before they make 
the transition into Year One. 
Drawing on the research findings, numerous tensions were identified which highlight 
the possible conflicts teachers face between their own beliefs about what ‘school 
readiness’ is, and the way in which the GLD is used as a ‘school readiness’ measure.  
It was expressed by the teachers in the study that children coming into Reception had 
a wide range of differing needs, including some children who were unable to speak 

 
153
any English, or had limited communication skills.  It is continuously reported that the 
most significant concern is that children are entering school with limited 
communication and language skills (NAHT/Family and Childcare Trust, 2017, p.6), yet 
the participants were consistent in their belief that this was a fundamental skill 
required in order to be ‘ready for school’.  This supports research carried out for the 
DfE by Snowling et al. (2011) which found considerable evidence to show that 
language, communication and Literacy were the ‘best predictors of educational 
success’ (p.42).  Communication and Language skills were seen as a precursor to 
more formal learning such as phonics and Writing, and without these skills in place 
teachers were having to spend time filling the gaps before children were ‘ready to 
learn’ the more advanced Literacy outcomes.  In the context of this school, these 
included skills such as cursive writing, lined workbooks and ‘early editing’ which, the 
teacher pointed out, would previously have been considered Year One skills.   
As discussed in the policy analysis in Chapter Two, outcomes such as writing simple 
sentences are now an expected outcome whereas previously, when compared with 
the National Curriculum Year One level descriptors (QCDA, 2010), these were Level 1 
outcomes and point 9 on the Foundation Stage Profile (QCA, 2008).  Rather than 
make critical considerations about the reasons behind the number of children failing 
to achieve the GLD, the Government continues to push the ‘top down’ and ‘earlier is 
better’ agenda into the Early Years (Whitebread et al., 2012, p.3).  Within the context 
of the GLD the notion of ‘school readiness’ becomes the ability to handle the more 
formal Literacy and Mathematical outcomes.  This reflects findings from research 
carried out in the USA by Bassock et al. (2016) who observed ‘a corresponding increase 
in Literacy and Math content instruction in kindergarten classrooms, with particularly 
large increases in time spent on “challenging” topics previously considered outside the 
scope of kindergarten’ (p.14).  This caused some tensions for the teachers who, 
throughout the research process, talked about the importance of the ‘whole child’ and 
voiced frustrations over the omission of the creative aspects of the EYFS as part of the 
GLD.  Further frustrations were caused by the fact that some children would be 
exceeding in areas such as Personal, Social and Emotional Development and Expressive 

 
154
Arts and Design, yet had not achieved the more complex formal outcomes of Literacy 
and Mathematics and therefore would not reach the GLD.   
It is this tension between the traditional holistic philosophy of ECE and the current 
focus on Mathematics and Literacy outcomes that has led to the assertion by Roberts-
Holmes (2015b) that the Early Years is being ‘schoolified’ in order to meet these 
outcomes.  In 2013, 51.7% of children achieved the GLD but by 2016 this had jumped 
to 69.3%, the biggest improvements seen in all aspects of Literacy and Mathematics 
(DfE, 2016).

development in the Prime and Specific areas of learning that make up the GLD.  

 
155
Across the Prime areas of learning there are, on the whole, small increases in the 
percentage of children achieving these outcomes over the three years.  The areas of 
learning that see a considerably larger hike in attainment are Literacy and 
Mathematics, with Writing seeing over a 10% increase.  The increase in percentages 
of children achieving these outcomes could suggest that teachers are focusing on the 
outcomes children need to achieve in order to reach the GLD, in particular the 
outcomes linked to Writing.  This was reflected in the findings of this study where the 
teachers talked of how they were placed under pressure to get children to the GLD, 
and how much more emphasis was placed on Mathematical and Literacy outcomes as 
these were what children found most difficult.  The use of handwriting workbooks 
and ‘early editing’ skills in the Reception classroom also reflects the significance of 
these skills to ensure children are ready for Year One.  This finding also supports 
recent findings from The Hundred Review (Pascal et al., 2017) which found that 
teachers are being pressured to improve children's outcomes and that pedagogy in 
Reception is 'becoming more instructional, teacher directed and narrowly focused on 
Literacy and Mathematics learning, with a loss of play and more individualised, 
creative approaches' (p.27).  
The increase in children achieving the more complex Literacy and Mathematical 
outcomes year on year further troubles the traditional approach to ECE.  One of the 
teachers described how, despite not agreeing with teaching cursive writing in 
Reception, many of the children were able to do it, which went some way in validating 
this as being the correct thing to do, particularly in the eyes of the Senior Management 
Team.  This creates a clear tension for teachers who are having to teach more formal 
skills in order to reach the GLD, but which sees children ultimately achieving the 
specified outcomes.  Questions arise as to whether the focus on Literacy and 
Mathematical outcomes are at the expense of more holistic approaches to teaching, 
and this was reiterated in the interview data.  Both teachers talked of how 
prescriptive the GLD was, and how children were being placed under pressure to 
achieve the ELGs, and the feelings of guilt that this was often at the expense of a play-
based approach to teaching, aligning with the findings of Moyles and Worthington 
(2011) who argued that the 'prescribed curriculum' was driving classroom practice 

 
156
(p.3).  When it is considered that curricular and assessment frameworks were 
positioned within the activity system as the rules governing the activity, the findings 
also support van Oers (2014) assertion that the frameworks that exist in the Early Years 
are creating 'conflicting motives' for teachers (p.20).         
The findings from this research are consistent with existing studies that have examined 
the 'datafication' of ECE, the emphasis on Mathematical and Literacy outcomes, and 
the impact this has on pedagogical practices (Brown et al., 2015; Flewitt & Roberts-
Holmes, 2015; Roberts-Holmes, 2015a; Roberts-Holmes, 2015b).  Building on this 
work, I argue that the use of CHAT as a theoretical and methodological framework, 
and the identification of the ‘manifestation of contradictions’ (Engeström & Sannino, 
2011) within the data, has highlighted some of the tensions and dilemmas teachers 
face on a daily basis in their pedagogical practice.  Using the GLD as a measure for 
‘school readiness’, and the accountability linked to this data, has clear implications for 
both teachers and children, explored in more depth in the next section. 
The Impact on the Teacher and Pedagogical Practice 
It was reported by the teachers that the SMT took an active interest in the projected 
number of children who were likely to achieve the GLD and, although this was always 
done in a positive way, throughout the interview both teachers talked at length about 
the pressures they were placed under.  Here I consider Vygotsky's theory of 
internalisation and externalisation (Douglas, 2010) as the teachers made sense of the 
messages being given by the SMT and the LEA about the importance of the GLD, and 
the subsequent impact this may have on teacher identity.  From a Vygotskian 
perspective, what follows is a discussion that considers how the teachers were shaped 
by the requirements embedded within the GLD as a performativity measure, and how 
in turn these understandings were acted upon through pedagogical approaches and 
classroom practice. 
Whilst children were able to access continuous provision both inside and outside at 
numerous points during the school day, the teachers were aware of the importance of 
the GLD as an accountability measure and it was explicitly stated that this had an 
impact on pedagogy in the classroom.  Play was seen to be an important part of 

 
157
Reception by both teachers, and frustrations were expressed over the lack of play 
available in Year One.  The concept of ‘purposeful play’ (OfSTED, 2015b) also 
emerged as it was explained that the continuous provision was used as a way of 
ensuring children met certain curricular outcomes and observations became a way of 
assessing whether those outcomes were being met, rather than valuing the play for 
what it was.  This is reminiscent of Bernstein’s (2000) ‘performance model’ whereby 
the teacher regulates what is taught and measures the resulting outputs of the child 
through a ‘visible pedagogy’.  
This ‘visible pedagogy’ is highlighted by the use of handwriting and Literacy workbooks 
which provide tangible evidence for the Literacy ELGs, but also reflect a more 
instrumental approach to the writing outcomes.  Here we see how teachers have had 
to align their pedagogy with ‘discourses of effectiveness and performativity measures’ 
(Wood, 2014, p.153) in order to ready children for formal schooling.  However, this 
caused tensions for the teachers who argued that some of the outcomes being taught 
and the expectations linked to writing would have been previously considered a Year 
One skill.  This further evidences the view that outcomes are being pushed down into 
Reception and re-enforces the belief by policymakers that ‘earlier is better’ despite 
research showing that this approach may not be effective, and could in fact be 
potentially damaging to children (Sharp, 2002; Walsh et al., 2006).  Not surprisingly, 
the teachers did "fight" against the introduction of cursive writing but were told this 
was “non-negotiable”.       
Conversely, as has already been discussed, the teachers were keen to establish that 
they saw children as individuals with different needs, and worked hard to ensure 
children developed holistically, aligning with Bernstein’s (2000) ‘competence model’.  
Children’s interests were followed as part of the weekly planning and it was asserted 
by the teachers that this gave children the opportunity to build their confidence and 
independence.  Mathematics was delivered through practical and playful activities, 
and this was then reflected in the continuous provision.  
Throughout the data collection period, the GLD was a dominant driving force for the 
teachers, a 'totalising discourse' that Dahlberg and Moss (2005) argue forces 

 
158
everybody into the same way of thinking and acting (p.142).  The teachers expressed 
criticisms of the use of the GLD as a measure of 'school readiness' stating that if only 
54% of children were achieving it then there must be "something wrong", and that 
children were more than a number on the spreadsheet.  However, the data highlights 
how the intensity of the GLD as a performative measure overshadowed everything 
else within the Reception classroom.  One of the teachers made references to 
"fighting" to defend her data, describing how "sometimes I've won, sometimes I 
haven't", declaring how if she "had a choice" she would not do things the way she was 
being asked to.  Persistent tensions were present throughout the data and, based on 
the findings of this research, I argue that the GLD subjugates teachers and forces them 
to focus on the outcomes required for what Roberts-Holmes (2015a) describes as the 
'good data' that are often in conflict with their beliefs, knowledge and personal 
experiences.  The power of the GLD as an accountability and performativity measure, 
for both teachers and children, creates a culture of compliance that is difficult to 
subvert.     
The Subjugation of Children 
The impact that the 'school readiness' agenda had on children became significant as I 
considered whether the GLD as a measure of 'school readiness' is positioned as a data 
collection tool in order to measure a school's performance, or if the driver behind this 
was to benefit the children.  In Chapter Two, I identified that a dominant discourse 
of ECE policy is the aim of ensuring children have 'the best start in life' (Allen, 2011; 
DfE, 2011; DfE/DH, 2011; Field, 2011; DfE, 2017b), but it was also questioned whether 
this discourse was inclusive of all children, particularly those living in situations of 
socio-economic disadvantage.  
It has been established that children enter Reception with a range of different skills 
and experiences and further issues arose as the Reception teachers identified the 
problem faced by the need to get all children to the same point by the end of Reception 
regardless of their starting points.  In particular, EAL and SEN children were identified 
by one of the teachers as children who they were concerned would not meet the 
expected level of development, and this supports evidence published by the DfE 

 
159
where only 23% of children with special needs achieved the GLD in 2016.  As a way 
of managing this, numerous interventions were in place to support the children, but 
they were still finding phonics and reading difficult, and it was reported that these 
interventions often took the children away from the continuous provision on offer in 
the classroom.  Referring back to the discussion on the importance of 
Communication and Language as a precursor to more instrumental Literacy skills, it 
would appear that there is an expectation regardless of a child’s attainment, to 
continue to prepare for the transition into Year One, which aligns with the 
deterministic nature of the GLD.  This was further problematised by the fact that 
some children did not even speak English on entry into Reception yet were still 
expected to meet the GLD.  This highlights a fundamental flaw in the use of the GLD 
as a measure of ‘school readiness’ and Hammond et al. (2015) argue that these 
'normative assessment arrangements' serve to 'contribute to inequity'.  The 
dominant discourse of ‘readiness’ as the achievement of the GLD only serves to place 
these children in a deficit position before they even enter Year One and brings to mind 
Osgood's (2016) assertion that using selected outcomes such as the GLD to measure 
children privileges some groups of children over others, and further marginalises 
groups of children who are already marginalised.  Furthermore, the failure to achieve 
these outcomes becomes the fault of the child, rather than any deficiencies in the 
expectations of the policy frameworks. 
A somewhat worrying finding that emerged from the data was the belief that children 
were being placed under pressure to achieve the GLD.  Words such as "railroading" 
and "pushing" were used by one of the participants to recount what it was like 
teaching some of the children the outcomes needed to reach the GLD.  This dilemma 
was also described as a "real uphill battle" and that there was a "lot of ground to make 
up", particularly when working with children who had come into Reception with 
limited communication and language skills.  One of the teachers also explained how 
children would "crumble" and get "upset and really stressed out" particularly when 
faced with the more difficult writing tasks.  Drawing on previous studies focusing on 
the early introduction of formal learning (Sharp, 2002; Walsh et al., 2006), the use of 
this language is concerning when findings highlighted how children were being placed 

 
160
'under pressure' and how this impacted negatively on self-esteem and motivation to 
learn.    
One of the teachers talked about how children were expected to behave in a "certain 
way" which is reminiscent of Sonu and Benson's (2016) notion of the 'ideal learner' 
(p.236).  Dahlberg et al. (1999) remind us of the 'richness of children's lived lives' and 
yet using the GLD as a way of measuring 'school readiness' and classifying children as 
'ready' or 'unready' ignores what children can do, and their social and cultural 
experiences beyond school.  Rather, the child is reduced to the practices of 
instrumentalism which, when viewed through this lens, reflects the ideological 
influence of neoliberalism whereby only what is measurable is seen to be of value 
(Biesta, 2010; Evans, 2013).  Arguably, this supports the belief that the focus on 'high 
stakes accountability' with an emphasis on Mathematics and Literacy, ensures children 
become 'neoliberal subjects' as the complexities of the children's lives are ignored 
(Sims & Waniganayake, 2015; Morris, 2016).  This caused a clear tension for the 
teacher who interestingly re-iterated the arguments presented by Dahlberg et al. 
(1999) and criticised the "very prescriptive" nature of the GLD, articulating her beliefs 
that "children aren't like that" and how they should be allowed to be themselves, 
rather than what was expected of them in the context of the GLD. 
Child-initiated activities were observed throughout the data collection period and 
independent writing and mark-making were undertaken by children during their free 
choice time (Image 9 and 10).  In Image 9 it can be seen how children are 
experimenting with letter formation and story narratives through their own child-
initiated learning.   
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
161
Image 9 - “Once upon a time there was some superheroes and some baddies, the end.” 
 
Image 10 - Evidence of independent writing done at home and at school 

 
162
In Image 10, the child had started to write a story at home, which she had then brought 
into school to finish.  She was able to read the story back to me and had made 
plausible attempts to spell complex words such as ‘princess’ and ‘palace’.  This 
demonstrates what Neaum (2016) refers to as the 'fluidity and responsiveness to the 
selection, sequence, timing and pace of each individual child's learning' that she 
argues requires a 'significant level of professional autonomy' (p.248).  The two 
examples highlight the differences in each child’s development, but both pieces of 
work are valid and valuable with regards to each child’s personal learning journey.  
On this basis, I am left wondering whether the challenge is to give children what Graue 
et al. (2002) refers to as the ‘gift of time’, and to embrace the understanding that 
‘children carry readiness in their bodies’ (p.351).  However, within the English policy 
context, the idea of placing more trust in children reaching the point of ‘readiness’, 
one not defined by the GLD but rather a child’s personal capacity for leading their own 
learning and subsequent development based on context and environment, is readily 
ignored.    
There was an acknowledgement by the teachers that, for some children, writing a 
letter sound may still demonstrate huge progress for that particular child and they 
were critical that the numerical data did not always reflect what the children had 
achieved over their time in Reception.  This re-enforces the argument that 'learning 
involves processes and content that are important for children' that are not always 
bound by the linear trajectory of the developmental EYFS framework (Wood & Hedge, 
2016, p.401).  Children who do not meet the specific outcomes of the ELG’s are 
categorised as ‘emerging’ and, within this framework, progress made by these 
individual children is not included in the data.  This lack of detail about a child’s 
achievement at the end of Reception was a clear source of frustration for the teachers 
and demonstrates how the complexities of children’s learning and development are 
reduced through what Roberts-Holmes (2015b) refers to as the ‘short-term test-driven 
regime’ of the GLD.   
Building on this argument, the 'emerging' construct illuminates the ontological 
reductionism of the GLD, whereby children are identified as being 'unready' for school, 
based on the failure to achieve the required prescriptive outcomes.  Furthermore, 

 
163
the report Are You Ready: Good practice in school readiness (OfSTED, 2014) aligns the 
construct of ‘emerging’ to a delay in development, where children are consistently 
referred to as working ‘below typical levels’ or that they arrive into the setting with 
‘low levels’ of attainment, or ‘developmental delay’.  Context is stripped away as 
family backgrounds, the child's lived experiences, and other factors are ignored in 
order to focus on the domain of the GLD.  One of the teachers highlighted the tension 
this created, in that only what is measured for the GLD is considered important, 
arguing that while it may be "useless" (in the context of the GLD), it was "very valid" 
when acknowledging a child's achievement.  Ball (2008) describes this as the 'first-
order' and ‘second-order' effects of performativity, whereby the 'pedagogical and 
scholarly activities' that lead to measurable outcomes inevitably cause the outcomes 
that are not measured to be discarded (p.54).  Children’s achievements are 
compartmentalised into what is valuable in order to achieve the GLD, and those that 
are not are ignored within the data driven system of Early Years assessment measures.   
Evans (2017) argues that a more optimistic approach is to view ‘emerging’ as the 
fluidity of each individual child’s development, that it is an ‘active and unpredictable 
process’.  Viewed through this lens, for children who are assessed as ‘emerging’, 
‘readiness’ is part of the dynamic process of ‘becoming’, rather than a ‘teleological 
goal’ in a child’s development (p.215).  This reflects a more ‘hopeful’ discourse than 
the one presented by OfSTED which defines children as being in a fixed state, and one 
that is deficit to normative expectations.

Tensions Between the Teacher (Subject), Policy Frameworks (Rules) 
and the GLD as a Measure of 'School Readiness' (Object) 
 
Diagram 11 – Tensions in the Activity System (Subject>Rules>Object) 
 
Here rules are positioned as the policy frameworks that teachers are expected to work 
within, and part of this discussion will explore whether these rules constrain the 
subject (Yamagata-Lynch, 2010, p.23).  I will also consider issues around the 
curricular gap between the EYFS and the National Curriculum expectations of Year 
One, and the impact that this has on provision.  
The Perils of Performativity and Accountability  
In Chapter Three I explored how 'Quality and Effectiveness' form a 'particular form of 
logic' (Evans, 2016, p.65) whereby quality is defined by how it is measured.  It is 
useful here to draw on Ball's (2003) position on the 'measure of productivity or output' 
encapsulating 'quality' but also that central to this is who 'controls the field of 
judgement' (p.216).  The findings from the data highlight how neoliberal ideology 
and the culture of performativity and accountability are played out within the context 
of the GLD as the participants described how ensuring children achieved the GLD was 

 
165
a "reflection that the school had done well".  This is significant when we expand 
further on Ball's (2003) assertions that this current educational climate leaves teachers 
open to sacrificing their beliefs and values, and possibly steering teaching in particular 
ways as professional judgement is overruled by performativity measures.   
In Chapter Four, notions of praxis and transformative agency were examined to help 
conceptualise the teacher as the subject of the activity system.  The discussion drew 
on the Vygostkian principle of 'double stimulation' whereby teachers interpret a 
situation and make decisions based on that interpretation, and this activity is 
transformative in the way it alters the environment (Vygotsky, 1978; Vygotsky, 1997).  
At this point it was questioned whether teachers are able to make decisions according 
to their own beliefs, whilst still maintaining compliance with policy demands.  The 
‘consequential change actions’ of transformative agency were framed as follows: 
1) Resisting the proposed change, or suggestions or initiatives associated 
with it. 
2) Criticizing the current activity and organization. 
3) Explicating new possibilities or potentials in the activity, often relating to 
past positive experiences. 
4) Envisioning new patterns or models for the activity. 
5) Committing to taking concrete actions to change the activity, often 
formulated as commissive speech acts tied to specific time and place. 
6) Taking consequential actions or reporting having taken consequential 
actions to change the activity (Engeström et al., 2014, p.125)   
Both teachers talked at length about the pressures they were under to ensure children 
met the GLD, and the limitations of time they were faced with as children entered 
Reception with gaps in their learning that need to be addressed before they could start 
working on the more instrumental Mathematical and Literacy skills.   This did not 
provide much space for resistance, especially as the results of the GLD were used as 
part of the teacher's performance management.  This concurs with Osgood's (2006a) 
reference to the demands of performativity as being a 'form of ventriloquism' as the 
teachers navigated the expectations placed on the children, and their own 
performance.  However, both teachers were critical of many aspects of the GLD 
including, as already discussed, the outcomes, the importance placed on the data by 

 
166
the LEA and SMT, and the reality that year on year many children will fail to meet the 
expected benchmark. 
Whilst the GLD caused considerable tensions for the teachers, both teachers 
understood and accepted that this measurement of performance came from the data-
driven system they were working within.  This brings to mind Roberts-Holmes' 
(2015a) argument that the data becomes part of the 'teacher's pedagogical focus' 
(p.307) despite attempts to stay true to traditional ECE philosophy.  This tension also 
reflects the hegemony of educational policy (Ball, 1990; Scott, 1990; MacDonald, 
2003), whereby the expectations placed on teachers and children are so embedded 
within this culture, that they are unable to resist the policy frameworks within which 
they are situated.  As a consequence, and supported by findings from this research, 
teachers become complicit in the delivery of these outcomes, regardless of whether 
they align or not with their own beliefs.  As we move further down the road of 
'technicist assessment practices' (Wood, 2014, p.153) with the continuing pushing 
down of outcomes into the Early Years, questions arise as to how this will continue to 
shape teacher identity as new teachers qualify into this system of performativity and 
accountability.  Indeed, findings from recent research carried out by Basford (2016) 
highlight how early career teachers are ‘playing the assessment game’ and that this 
has resulted in ‘distorted assessment practices’ stemming from the ‘performative 
culture that dominates assessment policy’ (p.1). 
Overall, the data did not reveal many aspects of 'transformative agency' as defined by 
Engeström et al. (2014), and the above discussion demonstrates how powerful the 
performativity demands of the GLD as a measure of 'school readiness' are within the 
Reception classroom.  However, referring back to Freire's (2000) definition of praxis 
as being the 'reflection and action upon the world to transform it' (p.51), the findings 
show that reflections were made about how children were reacting to the impending 
transition and that this resulted in the teachers putting strategies, or 'consequential 
actions' (Engeström et al. 2014), in place to ensure the needs and anxieties of the 
children were addressed.  The teachers were in agreement that if children did not 
have the emotional skills they would not be ‘ready to learn’ the instrumental skills 
required in Year One, and spent time providing reassurance by regularly taking the 

 
167
children into the new classrooms and reacting to any concerns or worries they had 
about the transition.  Having the emotional resilience to cope with the curricular and 
environmental changes was seen by the teachers to be at least as important as 
achieving the Mathematical and Literacy outcomes, if not more so.  This would 
suggest that teachers, whilst constrained by the policy frameworks within which they 
exist, have the potential to act in what Kemmis and Smith (2008) refer to as ‘morally-
committed ways’, as they work to provide children with the capacity to make a smooth 
curricular and environmental transition.   
Interestingly, an alternative discourse emerged from the study as the teachers 
explained how they did not use the term ‘school readiness’ in their day-to-day 
practice.  As children moved through Reception, the emphasis shifted towards what 
they consistently referred to as a ‘preparation’ for Year One which focused on more 
formal skills and ensuring children had the emotional maturity and intellectual ability 
that Kagan (1990) argues encompass the ‘readiness for learning’ construct.  This 
included the formal skills that were required to meet the ELGs, but there were also 
clear endeavours to ensure children were prepared emotionally for the transition, and 
had the resilience to cope with the changes.  
The Curricular Gap Between the EYFS and KS1 
Further tensions in the research data bring attention to the curricular gap between the 
end of Reception and Year One.  In 2004, the OfSTED report Transition from the 
Reception Year to Year 1 drew attention to the ‘insufficient consideration’ given to the 
relationship between the Early Years and Primary curricula, and how the pressures of 
the end of Key Stage One tests had impacted on an ‘abrupt’ transition to more formal 
learning (p.2).  In the school where the study took place, the children experience the 
environmental and pedagogical transition where the play-based approach of the EYFS 
is replaced with the more formal, subject-oriented approach of the National 
Curriculum.  The children also have to make the shift from the seven areas of learning 
to the eleven statutory subjects of the National Curriculum (DfE, 2014a).     
As part of the policy analysis in Chapter Two, I argued that the key policy drivers behind 
the 'school readiness' agenda are to ensure that the cycle of poverty is broken at the 

 
168
most 'cost-effective' point in time, and to prepare children for the formal learning of 
Year One so that England is strongly positioned to compete in the global race of 
education.  'School readiness' is seen as a key solution to 'long-standing social 
problems' and disadvantaged families' (Allen, 2011; Field, 2010; Simpson et al. 2015), 
and policymakers argue that an earlier start for children from disadvantaged families 
will help to 'make up the deficit in their academic skills' (Sharp, 2002, p.1).  In line 
with recommendations from the EYFS (DfE, 2014/2017), the summer term in the 
Reception classroom became more formalised and writing became much more of a 
focus so children were ready for the approach adopted in Year One.  Punctuation and 
well-structured writing was specified by one of the teachers as being an expectation 
by the end of Reception, despite previously being Year One skills.  The teacher also 
talked of getting children to reach the Exceeding statement in Writing which states 
‘Children can spell phonically regular words of more than 1 syllable as well as many 
irregular but high frequency words. They use key features of narrative in their own 
writing’ (STA, 2016, p.44).  She argued that this would help to “lessen the gap” 
between Reception and Year One which raises some serious questions regarding the 
curricular bridge between Reception and Year One, and it is of concern that outcomes 
that are already difficult for young children to achieve still do not correlate with the 
expectations of Year One.  This highlights a clear issue for those children who do not 
achieve the ELGs for Literacy and Mathematics, who then enter Year One already 
behind and in a perpetual state of catch up.   
At the time of writing, the Government response to the primary assessment 
consultation (DfE, 2017b) was published stating, ‘We will ensure that the ELGs are 
appropriately aligned with the year 1 curriculum, particularly the ELGs for Literacy and 
mathematics’ (p.6).  Whilst there is a clear requirement to ensure the two 
curriculums align to provide a smooth curricular transition, the recent trend of pushing 
outcomes down into earlier years raises some concerns as to which direction this may 
go.  It was reported by the teachers that there are already pressures placed upon 
them to introduce Year One outcomes, such as writing numbers correctly, despite this 
not being an ELG.  Whilst the teacher was resistant to this additional burden, it 
highlights the pressures that each year group is under and how outcomes are being 

 
169
pushed down in order to ‘ready’ children, resulting in children being in a constant state 
of preparation for the next stage of their learning. 
Concluding Comments 
This discussion has brought to light how CHAT has enabled the identification of 
tensions and dilemmas for teachers working within a framework where the GLD as a 
measure of ‘school readiness’ is a powerful performativity and accountability tool.  
The confusion over ‘school readiness’ as a transitional concept has been explored in 
more depth, and how this blurs the lens with regards to the different outcomes 
required for the environmental and curricular transitions.  It has been argued that 
the GLD as a normative assessment measure is flawed and reductionist in nature, and 
disregards outcomes that are not considered relevant.  The discussion also draws 
attention to the impact that current assessment and curricular policy frameworks 
have on teachers and children and transformative agency is diminished as teachers 
work within a culture of datafication and accountability. 
Returning to Foot’s (2014) assertion that contradictions are ‘starting places’ rather 
than ‘ending points’, the final chapter will consider the implications of this research, 
the contribution to existing knowledge, and the potential for future research that 
builds on these findings.

Chapter 7  
Conclusion 
 
The aims of this research were to explore teachers’ beliefs about 'school readiness', 
to examine how 'school readiness' is constructed within the classroom, and to identify 
the tensions between the beliefs of the teachers, policy frameworks and pedagogical 
practices.  As a way of framing this study the following supplementary questions 
were addressed: 
1) 
How is ‘school readiness’ defined in Government policy in England? 
2) 
What do teachers in the Early Years perceive ‘school readiness’ to be? 
3) 
How is ‘school readiness’ constructed within the Reception classroom?  
4) 
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs 
about ‘school readiness’ and pedagogical practice? 
5) 
What tensions and contradictions are there between teachers’ beliefs 
about ‘school readiness’ and policy frameworks?  
Reflections of the Thesis 
Using CHAT as a Research Framework 
Cultural-Historical Activity Theory has been a useful tool in this research, both as a 
methodological and conceptual framework, but also as a way of framing the analysis 
and searching for contradictions within the data.  Positioning teachers as the subject 
of the activity system worked well from the onset of the study, however, I found that 
as the research progressed I grappled with the different aspects of the framework, in 
particular, the tools and the object.  Diagram 12 and Diagram 13 demonstrate how 
the activity system evolved over the course of the research.

Diagram 12 - The original version of the 'classroom' activity system 
 
Diagram 13 - The final version of the 'pedagogical' activity system 
 
Whilst it would have been easy to position the child as the object of the activity system, 
it was important that a humanistic perspective was used and children were positioned 

 
172
in the research as people, not objects.  With this in mind, I considered the oriented 
activity would be focused on the object of learning and development, rather than the 
embodied child.  However, as I worked through the data and the discussion, the GLD 
was such a powerful dynamic within the classroom I contemplated how the 
achievement of this assessment benchmark was the key objective of the activity 
system in the Reception classroom. 
The other aspect of the activity system that I contended was the use of tools as a 
mediating artefact within the system which were initially pedagogy and teachers’ 
beliefs.  Teachers’ beliefs about 'school readiness' were a key focus of the research, 
and CHAT enabled me to explore in more depth the different factors that influence 
those beliefs, such as personal experiences, knowledge and the political climate, and 
how teachers drew on these beliefs as part of their classroom practice.  However, 
when it came to explore the tensions between the different parts of the activity 
system, I reconsidered pedagogy as being much more than a tool, but rather the 
activity driving the system in the first place.  I had initially defined the activity system 
as the 'classroom' but concluded that it is what happens in the classroom, rather than 
the physical space, that is important.  Based on this reasoning the final version of the 
activity system was then used to explore the tensions between the different aspects 
of the activity system which enabled me to frame my discussion. 
For the purpose of this research using CHAT has been an effective way of unpicking 
the complexities of teachers' pedagogical practices when carried out against a 
deterministic political backdrop of accountability and performativity.  It also helped 
to draw out the neoliberal constructs that are at play within the English educational 
system and explore other influences that impact on contemporary teaching practice.  
With this in mind, I argue that CHAT can be used in future research as a way exploring 
further the convoluted nature of ECE, and the different forces at play within this 
context.   
Limitations of the Study  
The study does have limitations, one of which was the small sample size used which 
meant there was a limited breadth of data.  In total, five teachers were interviewed, 

 
173
but only the interviews of the two Reception teachers were used due to the amount 
of data generated.  As such, generalisations cannot be drawn from the research, but 
the study does provide a rich and focused insight into the beliefs of two teachers 
working within the current educational climate where there is a strong emphasis on 
data as an accountability measure.   
A further limitation was the lack of research that has been carried out on 'school 
readiness' within an English or European context, as most of the existing research on 
this topic has come from the USA and Australia.  However, this also brings attention 
to the timeliness and relevance of this research as a contribution to the current debate 
about 'school readiness' as the agenda continues to grow as a key government focus.  
This also highlights the need for future research to explore in more depth some of the 
issues raised by this thesis, and to include more voices such as those of the parents 
and the children. 
The survey questionnaire was a useful exercise in order to establish an overarching 
view of what 'school readiness' was, but again confusions around which transition it 
referred to may have impacted on the participants’ responses.  In this case, in order 
to build on the questionnaire data, future research could involve revisiting the answers 
given by the respondents and using them as discussion points for online focus groups 
using social media such as Twitter or Facebook.  This would help to gain a broader 
understanding of the beliefs of teachers with regards to 'school readiness'. 
As part of this research, the Nursery teacher and Year One teachers were also 
interviewed about their beliefs about 'school readiness' and their expectations of what 
children should be able to do on transition into school, and from Reception into Year 
One.  Due to the word limitations of the thesis, this data was only used to establish 
what beliefs the teachers held about 'school readiness', and could therefore be used 
as part of a further study into the beliefs of the wider teaching community.

Looking to the Future  
Contribution to Knowledge 
The focus of the study did not change as I worked through the research process, but 
some unexpected themes emerged as I explored the literature in more depth.  It 
became clear that neoliberalism is a major structural force driving the 'school 
readiness' agenda and this became a key focus of my discussion.  This is further 
strengthened by the recent announcement by the OECD (2017) about a major new 
project that will be ‘an international assessment of children’s early learning’ to be 
known as the International Early Learning Study (IELS) (Moss et al., 2016, p.344). Moss 
et al. (2016) refer to the IELS as a 'pre-school PISA' (p.4), arguing that the technical 
approach adopted for the study values 'objectivity, universality, predictability and 
what can be measured' (p.6).  This process of testing, building on the measure and 
compare strategies of PISA, TIMSS and PIRLs, and the construction of league tables of 
winners and losers, fits in easily with the neoliberal concept of global competition and 
test-based accountability (Morris, 2016, p.8).  The IELS further re-enforces the 
framework for 'standardised assessment' whilst continuing to exclude 'contextually 
appropriate improvement of educational practices and equitable outcomes for all 
children' (Urban & Swadener, 2017, p.6).  To date, only England and the USA have 
agreed to participate in the study.  It is therefore argued that this thesis contributes 
to the continuing debate on the impact of neoliberalism on ECE, and also highlights 
opportunities for further research into the IELS as an entity that has the potential to 
strengthen the 'school readiness' agenda in England. 
Much of the existing research carried out exploring teachers’ beliefs about ‘school 
readiness’ has come from the USA and Australia, and therefore this thesis has provided 
new insights into the pressures faced by two Reception teachers working within a 
'school readiness' agenda in England.  The pressures faced by the teachers in this 
research are similar to those that Graue (1993) found kindergarten teachers were 
facing two decades earlier.  Kindergarten classrooms in the USA have become 
increasingly similar in structure to typical first grade classrooms of the late nineties, 
and first grade classrooms have an increased emphasis on assessment.  These 

 
175
findings are supported by research carried out by Brown and Lan (2015) whose 
analysis demonstrates how teachers’ conversations around ‘school readiness’ have 
shifted, with more emphasis being placed on preparing children for success in school.  
My thesis elucidates, therefore, that the top down push of formal and instrumental 
skills into the Early Years has followed the same trajectory as that of the USA, and how 
the academic expectations to reach outcomes, particularly those linked to Literacy and 
Mathematics, has intensified. 
A fundamental aim of this research was to identify tensions between beliefs, policy 
frameworks, and pedagogical practices, and I have explored in depth how these 
tensions impact on teachers and children.  Here I refer back to the assertion by 
Roberts-Holmes (2015a) that accountability and performativity frameworks are 
intensifying the pressures placed on teachers to ensure children are ‘school ready’ 
(p.304).  I argue that this research contributes to the debate by highlighting what 
pressures are being faced by teachers, and by illustrating some of the key issues 
encountered by Reception teachers working in a context where the GLD is such a 
powerful driving force. 
Using Cultural-Historical Activity Theory to underpin this study has helped to 
illuminate the influences, interactions and practices that occur as part of Reception 
pedagogy.  Whilst CHAT has been used across the educational research landscape, 
the use of this theory in ECE is somewhat limited, and therefore this study highlights 
the further possibilities of using this framework in research.  It can also be argued 
that this study provides an example of the practical application of CHAT, and that this 
can continue to be developed as a relevant and useful research tool. 
Implications of the Research 
Over the course of this study it has become increasingly obvious that 'school readiness' 
is a subjective term that is dealt with in an ideological way by policymakers, with the 
use of the GLD as the true measure of whether a child is ready for school.  The 
findings of this research clearly highlight the need for a definitive understanding of 
what 'school readiness' is, and the transition to which it refers.  As has been discussed 
at length, the teachers’ beliefs about 'school readiness' did not align with the way 

 
176
'school readiness' is positioned within government policy.  Based on the logic of the 
teachers, the implications of 'school readiness' were when children first enter school, 
and the skills that are needed for this transition are very different to the skills needed 
for transition into Year One, as measured by the GLD.  Therefore, a key 
recommendation would be to push policymakers towards establishing a clear 
definition of what 'school readiness' is and to which transition it refers.   
Further findings demonstrate how the term 'school readiness' is not used within the 
day to day classroom or school discourse.  From the teachers' perspectives, their role 
was to 'prepare' the children rather than 'ready' them, which is much more in keeping 
with traditional ECE principles.  I argue that the two terms have different 
connotations.  To 'ready' children throws up the question ‘ready for what?’, and 
implies that children are prepared specifically for an action or purpose.  Conversely, 
to 'prepare' children suggests they are being supported to be able to deal with a 
specific event, in this instance the transition into Year One.  As discussed, this was a 
prevalent part of both the teachers' practice, an altruistic outlook that helped to set 
the children up to succeed in Year One, rather than face the shock of a more formal 
learning environment.  I therefore recommend that the focus shifts towards a way of 
preparing children holistically for the transition, rather than the requirement to fulfil 
a checklist of outcomes.   
A key recommendation from the findings of this research would be to further the 
debate regarding the Literacy and Mathematical outcomes that leave so many children 
behind before they enter Year One.  As has been discussed, these outcomes have 
become a key focus in the Reception classroom, and have possibly impacted on 
pedagogical approaches as a way of achieving these outcomes.  This calls into 
question the appropriateness of these practices, but also the fact that this results in 
children beginning their time in Year One in a deficit position from which they may 
never catch up.  This is particularly pertinent when we consider the Government's 
promise to align the ELGs with the National Curriculum (DfE, 2017b, p.6) and the 
danger that even more difficult outcomes may be pushed down into Reception.  

 
177
This leads me to consider an alternative discursive landscape that can be seen in 
Nordic and Central European countries which follow a social pedagogy where the 
kindergarten years are seen as a ‘broad preparation for life and the foundation stage 
of lifelong learning’ (OECD, 2006, p.57).  Policy documents and curriculum guidelines 
acknowledge ‘a central expectation that preschools and schools will exemplify 
democratic principles and that children will be active participants in these democratic 
environments’ (Wagner, 2006, p. 292).  The ‘Nordic tradition’ within ECE applies a 
‘social learning approach’ where play, relationships and the outdoors are central to 
pedagogy, and learning taking place through children’s participation in social 
interaction (Ringsmose & Kragh-Müller, 2017, p.ix).  Introducing learning outcomes 
too early is seen to restrict a child’s free development, and a ‘school readiness’ driven 
agenda is considered unnecessary and ‘almost harmful’ (Jensen, 2009, p.11).   
Bingham and Whitebread (2012) argue that the social pedagogy model appears to 
support children’s development as ‘learners’ and ‘emotionally well-adjusted citizens’ 
in contrast to the ‘earlier is better’ approach adopted by England (p.5).  Mathematics 
and Literacy are not excluded from this tradition but rather an open and holistic 
curriculum is maintained, contrasting with countries where ‘readiness’ is privileged 
alongside a more academic approach to curriculum (OECD, 2012, p.83).  The 
emphasis is placed on social skills rather than preparing children ‘explicitly for school’ 
or focusing on academic skills (Oberhuemer, 2004, p.18), and as a consequence, 
’school readiness’ is a less used concept in Nordic countries (Ringsmose & Kragh-
Müller, 2017, p.88).   
It is pertinent, therefore, to denote that ‘school readiness’ is not seen to be a 
‘problem’ in countries using a social pedagogical model. Children in countries using 
the social pedagogy model start formal schooling two or three years later than 
children in England and, prior to this, the emphasis is placed on developing social skills 
rather than academic skills.  The continued efforts of the government in England to 
force instrumental skills into the Early Years ignores the alternatives practiced 
elsewhere, and fails to consider the problematic aspects of a “too much, too soon” 
approach to ECE.  This study has revealed how the focus on Mathematics and 
Literacy has had an impact on classroom practice, and illuminates how curricular and 

 
178
assessment pressures have pushed down formal and instrumental skills into the Early 
Years.  Therefore, the recommendation to policymakers would be the consideration 
of alternative approaches to ECE that foster holistic development, and acknowledge 
the socio-cultural contexts that children exist within, rather than the dominant focus 
on 'readying children for school'.   
Data from The World Bank regarding the Official entrance age to primary education 
(years) (2014) shows that the United Kingdom is part of the 10% where children start 
school aged five, with the majority of the world’s countries stipulating six or seven as 
the compulsory school age.  The Cambridge Primary Review describes the 
introduction of a formal, subject-based curriculum at age five as being ‘against the 
grain of evidence, expert opinion and international practice’, ‘highly contentious’ and 
a source of anxiety for teachers and parents (Hofkins & Northen, 2009, p.16).  
Furthermore, Sykes et al. (2009) argue that ‘children around the age of 4 may not be 
ready for the environment they encounter in the Reception class, which will include 
having to deal not only with a curriculum that may not be tailored to their needs but 
also with a number of social and emotional adjustments’ (p.32).  Findings from this 
research have highlighted the pressures that are faced by the children as they are 
judged against difficult Literacy and Mathematical outcomes, and how this can leave 
them in a deficit position as they make the transition into Year One.  I argue that 
these findings contribute to the debate around the compulsory school age, and many 
of the pressures highlighted in this research would be alleviated if teachers had more 
time to ensure secure foundations are in place before children move into more formal 
learning environments.  Therefore, I recommend that a case be made for a later 
compulsory school age, and the extension of the EYFS until children are at least six 
years old.   
Finally, I recommend that the focus of ‘readiness’ shifts to the school being ‘ready’ for 
the child, rather than the responsibility lie at the feet of the child.  Research into 
transition into school carried out by Peters (2000) in New Zealand found that while 
children adapted to the school routine relatively easily, what was important was ‘the 
nature of the support they received and the connections between family, teachers 
and peers’ (p.23).  This increased understanding that children exist within these 

 
179
social contexts has highlighted a need to focus on the school’s readiness for the child 
and the role that teacher’s play in transitions (Shallwani, 2009, p.5).  Rather than see 
‘readiness’ as a ‘unitary construct’ that the child needs to demonstrate before entering 
Year One, the use of a bi-directional model such as an interactionist framework sees 
both child and school as partners in the readiness equation (Carlton & Winsler, 1999, 
p.346).  A ‘ready’ school is defined as providing a safe and secure environment where 
all children are able to learn, where teachers and staff are welcoming, and effective 
learning opportunities are offered (Arnold et al., 2007, p.17).  Meisels (1998) argues 
that this perspective ‘addresses both the child’s contributions to schooling and the 
school’s contribution to the child’ reflecting Kagan’s (1990) construct of a ‘readiness 
for learning’ rather than a ‘readiness for school’ (p.11).  Schools who respond to a 
child’s individual needs rather than enforcing children to conform to a particular 
standard, are then better placed to establish ‘appropriate learning pathways’ (Peters 
& Roberts, 2015, p.6), which will help to address some of the issues highlighted in this 
research. 
Implications for future research  
This study focused on the beliefs of Reception teachers about 'school readiness', how 
'school readiness' is constructed within the classroom, and what tensions arise for 
teachers working within this agenda of accountability.  As already discussed, using 
CHAT has been a useful way of framing the research but this could be built on further 
by exploring the concept of expansive learning within the activity system.  Engeström 
(2001) proposes that as contradictions within the activity system are aggravated, there 
is potential for the individual to begin to ‘question and deviate’ from the established 
norms, which can lead to ‘collaborative envisioning and a deliberate collective change 
effort’ (p.137).  
Explored in the previous chapter, the findings of this research highlight how 
opportunities for teacher agency are diminished by the pervasive force of the GLD as 
a performance management tool.  In order to explore the notion of teacher agency 
within the activity system in more depth, the gaze could be shifted to look more closely 
for ‘consequential change actions’: resistance, criticising, explicating new possibilities, 

 
180
envisioning new patterns, committing to change, and taking consequential actions 
(Engeström et al., 2014, p.125).  This concept of expansive learning offers 
‘progressive possibilities by enabling movement from current practices deemed 
problematic’ towards a ‘facilitation of transformative change’ (Avis, 2009, p.152).  
Avis (2009) argues that this type of analysis offers the ‘development of emancipatory 
practices’ yet also feeds into the improvement of the ‘effectiveness and efficiency of 
institutional practices’ (p.152).    
Continuing to develop CHAT as a methodological framework, a key aim is to build on 
the findings of this research and begin to probe the two aspects of the activity system 
that were not utilised in this research, the wider community and the division of labour, 
in more depth.  Findings from this research support the view that the skills that 
children need in place as they make the institutional transition into school are centred 
around Personal and Social Development, and Communication and Language.  
Working with parents and the wider community more closely could provide an insight 
into how the development of these skills could be supported, and issues regarding 
transition into school from a parents’ perspective could be further identified.  
Further potentials for future research also include the exploration of perspectives of 
'school readiness' from the point of view of Nursery and Year One teachers, and 
potentially those of the SMT.     
At the point of finishing the thesis, OfSTED (2017) published the Bold Beginnings 
report with the aim of identifying ‘the extent to which a school’s curriculum for four - 
and five-year-olds prepares them for the rest of their education and beyond’ (p.2).  
Key recommendations included a greater importance be placed on teaching numbers, 
that reading be the ‘core purpose of the Reception year’, and children are taught to 
write using a correct pencil grip whilst sitting at a table.  TACTYC’s (2017) response 
to the report criticised the ‘underlying agenda of downward pressure from KS1 to 
narrow the early years curriculum’ (p.6), and the failure to recognise the ‘nature and 
value of play and playfulness in learning’ (p.3).  Indeed, the Bold Beginnings 
publication appeared to contradict the earlier OfSTED (2015a) report Teaching and 
play in the early years – a balancing act? which described how teaching in the Early 
Years sits on a ‘continuum’, dependent on the needs of the child at a given point in 

 
181
time (p.5).  The subsequent debate highlighted tensions around the false dichotomy 
of play and learning, and the requirement to ‘teach’ knowledge and skills to ensure 
‘school readiness’.  I argue that, as Mathematics and Literacy are pushed to the 
forefront of ECE as part of the ‘school readiness’ agenda, a critical stance is taken to 
explore in more depth the clarifications of cultural and political assumptions around 
play and learning in the Early Years.  As Wood and Hedge (2016) assert, without 
clarity of ‘the links between play, learning, and pedagogy’, the ECE curriculum will 
continue to be ‘subject to critique, and open to the levels of control that are embedded 
in many contemporary policy frameworks’ (p.391).  In the current context of the 
‘school readiness’ agenda and the issues raised in the thesis, this is worthy of further 
exploration. 
As has been discussed in depth as part of this thesis, a key problem space is the 
children who do not manage to reach the GLD, and a pertinent and relevant line of 
enquiry would be to examine how these children cope with the transition into Year 
One, and how this impacts on the work of the Year One teachers.  The GLD is a 
political construct that should continue to be interrogated, and the impact that this 
assessment measure has on children, teachers, and the wider school community.

Appendix A – Executive Summary of the Research 
How do teachers in the Early Years perceive school readiness 
and the impact it has on their classroom practice? 
The aim of this research is to understand school readiness in the context of the 
pedagogical approaches, curriculum planning and assessment practice of two 
teachers working in Reception classrooms in a two-form entry in a school in northwest 
England.  It is proposed that this research will explore the teachers’ beliefs about 
school readiness, and how these beliefs have an impact on their classroom practice. 
Teaching is a busy and demanding role and it is acknowledged that the research will 
be second priority to the teacher's work commitments.  One of the key aims of the 
research is to establish a collaborative partnership and that the teachers will act as co-
researchers as part of this process.  Reflective conversations and discussions will take 
place with the teachers throughout the data collection process, with the purpose of 
constructing a collaborative relationship between the researcher and the researched.   
Contradictions between belief and practice will be examined in order to identify any 
tensions present in the classroom as we scrutinize issues around school readiness.  
As part of this study, current policy frameworks will be analysed and through the use 
of narrative methods the beliefs of teachers will be explored through interviews, non-
participant observation and the document analysis of classroom documents including 
activity and lesson plans, and assessment data.  Data will be returned to the teachers 
as an ongoing process to allow for further comments and clarifications, and it is hoped 
that this process will prompt deeper thinking within the partnership over the course 
of the data collection period.    
The data collection period will run from January 2016 to July 2016, with the aim of 
completing the thesis by the end of 2017.  A copy will be made available for the 
school on completion of the study.

Appendix B - Participant Information Sheet 
Date: 31st October 2015 
Research Project Title:  How do teachers in the Early Years perceive school readiness and the 
impact it has on their classroom practice? 
You are being invited to take part in a research project that will be submitted as a doctoral 
thesis for the University of Sheffield Doctorate of Education (EdD) programme.  Before you 
decide, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will 
involve.  Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with 
others if you wish.  Please do not hesitate to ask if there is anything that is not clear or you 
would like more information.  Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.  
Thank you for taking the time to read this information sheet. 
What is the purpose of the project? 
The primary aim for this research is to explore the construct of school readiness and how this 
impacts on the pedagogical approaches, curriculum planning and assessment practices of two 
teachers working in Reception classrooms in northwest England.  The study will explore 
teacher beliefs about school readiness, and the factors that have influenced these beliefs.  
School readiness is at the forefront of current Early Years educational policy and is seen 
politically as a way of narrowing the attainment gap and improving the social mobility of 
disadvantaged children.   
Why have I been chosen? 
You have been chosen because you work in a Reception classroom in a two-form entry school 
in Oldham.  For the purpose of this research, two participants will be required. 
Do I have to take part? 
Participation in this research is entirely voluntary.  If you do decide to take part you will be 
given this information sheet to keep and will be asked to sign a consent form.  You may 
discontinue your involvement at any time during the research process and you do not have to 
give a reason. 
What will happen to me if I take part?   
The data collection process will take place from January 2016 to July 2016 (Appendix 1).  An 
initial interview will take place at a convenient location.  The purpose of this interview will 
be to find out what your beliefs about school readiness are and what has influenced these 
beliefs.  These interviews will be recorded using audio equipment and the data will be stored 
securely and will remain confidential. 
Observations will be carried out in the classroom every Friday morning, the focus of which will 
be determined by the analysis of the interview data.  I will observe teacher led activities, 
whole class teaching, and other interactions made between teacher and child throughout the 
course of the morning, focusing on your role in the classroom.  Over the data collection 

 
213
period there will be four observation sessions during which time informal conversations about 
the research focus will also take place.  Data collected throughout the process will be 
returned to you so you are able to add further comments or clarifications.  
Planning documents and assessment practices will be analysed as a way of framing the 
observation schedule and interviews.  It will be necessary to have a copy of the medium term 
planning for the spring and summer term, and short term planning for each week of the data 
collection phase (either printed or an electronic copy).   
At the end of the process there will be a final interview which will explore how you think your 
own beliefs about school readiness have impacted on your pedagogical approach, curriculum 
planning and assessment practices.  In order to establish a relationship of collaboration 
throughout the data collection process, emerging themes within the data will be discussed 
with you as an ongoing practice and will be explored in depth in the final interview. 
You will be given a copy of this information sheet and a signed consent form to keep.  In 
addition to this the parents of the children in the class will also be given an information sheet 
to explain what I will be doing in the classroom over the course of the data collection process. 
What do I have to do? 
You will be required to participate in two interviews at the beginning and the end of the data 
collection phase, be observed over the course of the data collection phase, and be available 
for informal discussions throughout the observation period on the mornings that the data will 
be collected.  Data will be returned to your for verification and clarification.  You will also 
be asked to provide weekly copies of the short term planning over the course of the data 
collection period. 
What are the possible benefits of taking part? 
Whilst there are no immediate benefits for those participating in the research, it is hoped that 
the project will represent the voice of teachers working in this current educational climate 
where school readiness is at the forefront of contemporary debate in government policy and 
the Early Years.  You are considered to be the expert of your own pedagogical approach and 
your narrative will present a first hand insight into this issue.  It is also hoped that by taking 
part in this project, your reflections and contributions to the debate will support your own 
continuing professional development.   
What happens if the research study stops earlier than expected? 
If this happens, the reasons will be explained to the participant. 
What if something goes wrong? 
If you wish to raise a complaint about treatment you have received during the research 
process you should contact the Research Supervisor, Professor Elizabeth Wood 
(e.a.wood@sheffield.ac.uk).  If you feel that your complaint has not been handled to your 
satisfaction you can contact the School of Education ethics review panel (edu-
ethics@sheffield.ac.uk). 

 
214
Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential? 
All the information that I collect during the course of the research will be kept strictly 
confidential.  You will not be identified in any reports or publications.  Any written or verbal 
communication between researcher and participant will be treated as confidential, and data 
will be stored on a secure laptop and backed up to password protected online storage 
facilities. You have the right to access personal information that relates to you and will be 
provided with a copy of information on request.  This could include data such as the 
interview transcripts and observation records.  You also have the right, following completion 
of your involvement in the research and discussions with the researcher, to withdraw your 
consent and require that your own data be destroyed, if practicable. 
Data will be collected, stored and handled in anonymous form, using a pseudonym.  Also, 
the school and area in which the research takes place will also be anonymised.  The data will 
be stored on a password-protected laptop and will be securely uploaded to iCloud and 
Dropbox as a backup.  Data will remain confidential at all times.  If the data is needed for 
future articles and conferences, permission will be requested from the participants 
beforehand. 
Confidentiality will only be breached if a safeguarding issue arises during the research process 
and this will be done via the school’s designated Child Protection Officer in adherence with 
the school’s safeguarding policy. 
Will I be recorded, and how will the recorded media be used? 
The audio recordings of the interviews made during this research will be used only for analysis 
and for illustration in conference presentations and lectures.  No other use will be made of 
them without your written permission, and no one outside of the project will be allowed to 
access the original recordings. 
What type of information will be sought from me, and why is the collection of this 
information relevant for achieving the research project’s objectives? 
Teachers hold implicit beliefs about the practice of teaching.  For the purpose of this 
research, your educational viewpoints about school readiness will be examined in an attempt 
to understand the impact that your beliefs have on the process and culture of teaching.   I 
will explore the multiple factors that influence your beliefs, and how your values and 
experiences shape the activities that take place within the classroom. 
Who has ethically reviewed the project? 
This project has been ethically approved via the School of Education department’s ethics 
review procedure at the University of Sheffield.

Appendix F - Survey 
Teacher Beliefs about School Readiness 
Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey. The focus of my research is centred 
around teacher's beliefs about school readiness, and your contribution is important in 
reflecting current thinking in contemporary Early Years practice. This survey forms part of a 
larger study being undertaken for a Doctorate of Education at the University of Sheffield. My 
main focus is to explore teacher beliefs about school readiness, and how these beliefs 
impact on practice and pedagogy in the Reception classroom. The survey is a way of getting 
a wider view about current beliefs around school readiness before I go into a school and 
work with two reception teachers in more depth. The project has been ethically approved 
via the School of Education department’s ethics review procedure at the University of 
Sheffield. All the data that I collect during the course of the research will be kept strictly 
confidential and participants will remain anonymous. If you require any further information 
please do not hesitate to contact me at ljkay1@sheffield.ac.uk. Many thanks.

Appendix K - Parents Information Sheet 
Date: 31st October 2015 
Research Project Title:  How do teachers in the Early Years perceive school readiness and the 
impact it has on their classroom practice? 
I am currently working in your child’s classroom in order to carry out a research project that 
will be submitted as a doctoral thesis for the University of Sheffield Doctorate of Education 
(EdD) programme.  Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss 
it with others if you wish.  Do not hesitate to ask if there is anything that is not clear or you 
would like more information.  Thank you for taking the time to read this information sheet. 
What is the purpose of the project? 
The primary aim for this research is to explore the construct of school readiness and how this 
impacts on the pedagogical approaches, curriculum planning and assessment practices of two 
teachers working in Reception classrooms in northwest England.  The study will explore 
teacher beliefs about school readiness, and the factors that have influenced these beliefs.  
The school and teacher are in full support of this research project and have given their own 
consent to participate.  The outcomes of this research project will be made available to the 
school and parents in the form of the doctoral thesis.     
What does my child have to do? 
Between January and July of this year I will spend some time observing the classroom teacher 
and the interactions that take place within the classroom.  Your child will have to do nothing 
different to what they would usually do.  No photographs will be taken during the 
observation sessions.  If you want your child to opt out of the observation process then 
please sign the form below and return to the classroom teacher or myself.  I will be available 
to speak to parents on the mornings that I am in school to answer any questions you may have 
about the research.  I will be in school as specified on the observation schedule, which is 
presented at the end of this information sheet. 
Will the data in this project be kept confidential? 
All the information that I collect during the course of the research will be kept strictly 
confidential.  The teacher or school will not be identified in any reports or publications.  
Any written or verbal communication between researcher and the teacher will be treated as 
confidential, and data will be stored on a secure laptop and backed up to password protected 
online storage facilities. 
Data will be collected, stored and handled in anonymous form, using a pseudonym.  Also, 
the school and area in which the research takes place will also be anonymised.   
Confidentiality will only be breached if a safeguarding issue arises during the research process 
in line with the school’s safeguarding policy. 
Who has ethically reviewed the project? 

 
242
This project has been ethically approved via the School of Education department’s ethics 
review procedure at the University of Sheffield. 
What if something goes wrong? 
If you wish to raise a complaint about treatment you or your child has received during the 
research process you should contact the Research Supervisor, Professor Elizabeth Wood 
(e.a.wood@sheffield.ac.uk).  If you feel that your complaint has not been handled to your 
satisfaction you can contact the School of Education ethics review panel (edu-
