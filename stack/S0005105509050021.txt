1. STRUCTURE OF THE JSM METHOD
Recent publications have presented a detailed
description of the architecture of the JSM method, as
well as its inference means and applications to intelli-
gent systems [1–3]. The purpose of the JSM method is
to extract cause-and-effect relations from a fact base
(FB) using a knowledge base (KB) by formalized heu-
ristics of the “induction-analogy-abduction” type. Such
heuristics are formalized in the form of plausible rea-
soning (or, rather, cognitive plausible reasoning [3]),
and its computer implementation results in a JSM-type
intelligent system [2]. The operation results of intelli-
gent systems, such as the JSM type (JSM IS), are data
analysis in a FB (knowledge discovery), automatic
hypothesis generation by means of plausible reasoning,
automatic KB extension by means of generated hypoth-
eses, and on-line formation of the open theory by
means of the FB and expanded KB.
It can be said that the superobjective of the JSM
method consists in supporting research in insufﬁciently
formalized object domains, the knowledge acquisition
in which employs computer-aided cognition based on a
FB in JSM IS.
Let us present the more-detailed characteristics of
the JSM method consisting of ﬁve components:
1. The ﬁrst component of the JSM method is the for-
malized conditions of its applicability, such as
O.M. Anshakov’s causal models [I]
 
1
 
 and D
 
(±)
 
, i.e.,
V.K. Finn’s sets
 
2
 
 (these are formalized and half-formal-
ized applicability conditions of the JSM method
respectively).

(pp. 306–332).
 
2
 
See in [1]: Introduction, Chapter 4 (pp. 153–156).
 
2. The second component of the JSM method is
plausible JSM reasoning, or reasoning implementing
the synthesis of cognitive procedures, viz., induction,
analogy, and abduction (with the possible subsequent
application of deduction). An essential unique feature
of JSM reasoning is also that neither induction nor anal-
ogy nor abduction are considered independently. At the
same time, induction is not enumerative and contains
the means of automatic falsiﬁcation. In addition, in the
JSM method from the initial predicate X 
 
1
 
Y
(“object X has a set of properties Y”) the predicates
V 
 
2
 
W (“subobject V is the cause of the pres-
ence/absence of the set of properties W,” for the direct
JSM method) and W
 
3
 
 V (“the set of properties W is
the effect of the cause V,” for the inverse JSM method)
are generated.

 The generation of predicates V

W
and W

 V by the rules of plausible conclusion from
the predicate X

Y creating a FB of the studied
effect is the formalized reﬁnement of J.S. Mill’s well-
known inductive method of agreement performed by
means of multivalued logics and Boolean algebra of
sets.

3. The third component of the JSM method consists
of quasi-axiomatic theories (QATs) that are the means
for the formalization of the open theories of various
object domains represented in fact and knowledge
bases of intelligent systems.
QATs consist of a set of axioms only partially char-
acterizing the object domain, of an open set of facts and
hypotheses, and sets of inference rules containing the
rules of plausible conclusion and the rules of valid con-

Abstract
 
—The main principles of the JSM method for automatic hypothesis generation are considered along
with the problems of its development. The formalization of J.S. Mill’s joint method of agreement and difference
is proposed and the concept of a JSM strategy is deﬁned. The article also considers two possible development
directions of artiﬁcial intelligence and its connection with cognitive research.
 
Keywords:

clusion. An essential unique feature of QAT is the
expansion of both the set of axioms and the set of facts
and hypotheses on applying JSM reasoning to the FB of
intelligent systems. Another QAT unique feature is the
employment of plausible JSM reasoning as the means
of computer-aided analysis of fact arrays and the means
of generating hypotheses about cause-and-effect rela-
tions. Therefore, QATs are the means of knowledge
representation in intelligent systems implementing the
JSM method.
4. The fourth component of the JSM method is an
inferential imitation of JSM reasoning formalizing the
process of automatic hypothesis generation. The rules
of plausible conclusion formalizing induction and anal-
ogy are represented as axioms employed as a axiomatic
system of inferential imitation of JSM reasoning. The
following statements hold about this axiomatic system:
a) the axiomatic system is consistent;
b) the axiomatic system contains the axioms of the
end of the JSM reasoning;
c) the axiomatic system has a single model;
d) the rules of plausible conclusion of the JSM
method for automatic hypothesis generation are invert-
ible.
 
5
 
The signiﬁcant results connected with the inference
means of the JSM method include D.V. Vinogradov’s
theorems for the expressibility of the predicates repre-
senting induction and analogy, as well as the abduction
axiom in the language of the ﬁrst-order predicate logic
for the class of ﬁnite models and for the necessity of the
language of weak second-order predicate logic for the
class of arbitrary (including inﬁnite) models. Among
D.V. Vinogradov’s ﬁndings about the inferential imita-
tion of JSM reasoning is the coincidence of the single
model of inferential imitation with the canonical model
of the stratiﬁed logic program formalizing plausible
JSM reasoning [1, Chapters 5–8, pp. 287–305].
5. Intelligent systems of the JSM (JSM IS) type are
the ﬁfth component of the JSM method. JSM IS sys-
tems have four subsystems: Problem Solver, FB, KB
and a user-friendly interface. JSM ISs have the follow-
ing architecture:
JSM IS, problem Solver + (FB + KB) + interface,
where problem Solver consists of Reasoner + Valuator +
Composer. The Reasoner implements logical proce-
dures, the Valuator runs computational procedures (sta-
tistical methods, quantum-chemical calculations etc.),
and the Composer develops the strategies of problem
solution coordinating logical procedures and computa-
tions.
JSM ISs, as computer intelligent systems, have the
following speciﬁc features. The Reasoner implements
JSM reasoning, i.e., the synthesis of induction, analogy,
and abduction; FB consists in the relations between

method for automatic hypothesis generation,” pp. 240–286.
 
structured objects represented in it and the studied
effects (e.g., biological activity of chemical com-
pounds, clinical symptoms, respondents’ opinions
etc.). Therefore, the initial FB predicate X 
 
 
1
 
Y has
interpretations in different object domains such that the
values X and Y are structured objects and their charac-
teristic effects, respectively. The structuredness of the
objects (values X) is the necessary condition for auto-
matic hypothesis generation by the JSM method based
on the following principle: the similarity of facts
involves the presence (absence) of the studied effect
and its frequency (this principle is the implementation
of J.S. Mill’s inductive methods, which by formalized
reﬁnement and support of the means of the modern
logic, yield the JSM method).
The logic means of the JSM method employ inﬁ-
nite-valued logics with J.B. Rosser–A. Turquette’s
 
J
 
-operators [5]. The truth values of these JSM logics
contain plausibility degrees of the hypotheses gener-
ated by JSM reasoning. The truth values of these logics
are constructively generated by the rules of plausible
conclusion for induction and analogy. The constructive
method for the generation of truth values in JSM rea-
soning distinguishes JSM logics from fuzzy logics, the
truth values of which are assigned to propositions by
predeﬁned 
 
μ
 
-functions.
An essential characteristic 
 
ν
 
 of the JSM method is
that these are represented as the pair 
 = 
 
〈ν
 
, 
 
n
 
〉
 
, where
 
ν
 
 is the type of the truth value (
 
ν ∈
 
 {1, –1, 0}), and 
 
n
 
 is
a natural number expressing the plausibility degree of
the generated hypothesis, which is the number of appli-
cations of plausible conclusion (induction and analogy)
rules. 1, –1, and 0 correspondingly represent the types
of internal truth values, i.e., true truth, true falsehood,
and true contradiction (conﬂict), and (
 
τ
 
, 
 
n
 
)= {
 
〈
 
1, 
 
n
 
 + 1
 
〉
 
,
 
〈
 
–1, 
 
n
 
 + 1
 
〉
 
, 
 
〈
 
0, 
 
n
 
 + 1
 
〉}
 
 
 
∪ 
 
(
 
τ
 
, 
 
n
 
+ 1
 
)
 
, where 
 
τ
 
 is the “unde-
ﬁned” type of truth value. 
The above-listed singularities of the JSM method
are connected with the following epistemological prin-
ciples of computer-aided data mining (knowledge dis-
covery) it employs:
(1) synthesis of cognitive procedures of the type
“induction + analogy + abduction” for knowledge
extraction from FB (“knowledge discovery”);
(2) the above-mentioned principle of qualitative
(nonstatistical) data analysis: the similarity of facts in
the FB involves the presence (absence) of the studied
effect and its frequency [recurrence];
(3) falsiﬁcation embedded in the procedures of plau-
sible conclusion (induction and analogy);
(4) hypothesis acceptance by abductive explanation
FB;
(5) knowledge representation in the KB in the form
of quasi-axiomatic theories (QATs);
(6) the implementation of the JSM method for auto-
matic hypothesis generation according to K. Popper’s
scheme of knowledge growth P1–TT–EE–P2 [7],

where P1 is the problem being solved (an IS objective
characterized by the class of the problems being
solved), TT is the tentative theory (the initial variant of
QAT represented in the KB in IS), EE is the adjustment
of the TT theory by error elimination and knew knowl-
edge acquired by the JSM method, and P2 is a new
problem arising from the results of JSM IS application.
Therefore, the JSM method and its experimental
base in the form of JSM IS build up the foundation for
the development of the formal (precise) epistemology
of intelligent computer systems employing cognitive
reasoning of the type “induction + analogy + abduc-
tion” (with the possible use of deduction) [3].
The epistemological content of the JSM method for
automatic hypothesis generation is closely connected
with the ideas of J.S. Mill, C.S. Pierce, K.R. Popper,
G. Polya, and D.A. Bochvar. The JSM method is the
formalization and development of J.S. Mill’s ideas
about induction and its role in the study of causal
dependencies applying the means of modern logic and
computer technologies.
Cognitive reasoning of the JSM method [3] employs
C.S. Pierce’s idea of abduction [8] reﬁning it by means
of the procedure of hypothesizing and generation of
their plausibility degrees by induction and analogy [3].
The necessary application of hypothesis falsiﬁca-
tion techniques (as a criterion of the demarcation of sci-
entiﬁc knowledge [9]) in the JSM method is imple-
mented in the form of the rules of plausible conclusion,
induction, and analogy and by abductive acceptance (or
nonacceptance) of hypotheses [3] (see also [1], Intro-
duction, Chapter 4. Synthesis of cognitive procedures
and the problem of induction, pp. 96–164).
Formal languages of the JSM method employed for the
formalization of inﬁnite-valued JSM logics [6, Chapter 2,
pp. 115–151, 200–235] use D.A. Bochvar’s principle of
separation of external logical connectives from the
internal ones [10] used to represent facts in the FB. The
external logical connectives in JSM logics are 
 
J
 
-opera-
tors with the range of values including logic “true” and
“false.”
Some information reﬁnement should be made when
characterizing IS as computer systems of artiﬁcial
intelligence to show that IS must imitate (and, perhaps,
strengthen), the basic capacities of natural intelligence
(NI). Such capacities are:
(1) singling out material factors in data;
(2) deﬁnition of objectives;
(3) reﬁnement of knowledge (conclusion premises)
relevant to the purpose of the reasoning; (4) capacity for
reasoning;
(5) informed decision making;
(6) reﬂection as the assessment of knowledge and
actions;
(7) cognitive curiosity (the question “What is it?”);
(8) explanation capacity (the question “Why?”);
(9) capacity for the synthesis of cognitive proce-
dures (e.g., interaction of induction, analogy, and
abduction allowing for the falsiﬁcation by a counterex-
ample);
(10) learning and use of the memory;
(11) rationalization of ideas expressed in the desire
to make them more precise as concepts;
(12) capacity for devising an integrated picture con-
cerning the object of reasoning, integrating knowledge
relevant to the set objective;
(13) capacity for adaptation to the changed situa-
tions and knowledge that involves the adjustment of
already available knowledge (“theory”) and behavior.
Capacities (1)–(13) constituting the NI phenome-
nology were characterized in [11]; it should be noted
that they “cover” the “practical intelligence’ capacities
(deﬁnition of objectives, adaptation and assessment)
formulated in [12]. Capacities (1)–(13) also cover the
set of unique human capacities from the viewpoint of
cognitive psychology [13] i.e., capacity for pattern clas-
siﬁcation, capacity for the adaptive change in behavior,
capacity for learning both deductive and inductive rea-
soning; capacity for developing and using conceptual
models, capacity for understanding.
Note that capacities (1)–(6), (8–(10) can be simu-
lated by computer systems in automatic mode whereas
capacities (7), (11)–(13) can be imitated in the on-line
mode, in which case the respective computer system is
a partner man-machine system.
Therefore, an IS can be characterized as a computer
system with the architecture IS = Problem solver + (FB +
KB) + (user-friendly) interface such that it can imitate
NI capacities (1)–(6), (8)–(10) in automatic mode, and
capacities (7), (11)–(13) in an online mode as a man–
machine system.
Capacities (1)–(13) constituting the NI phenome-
nology formulated in [11] are implemented by the prin-
ciples P I–P XI of IS design and of data mining from
[3]. Two types of knowledge are employed in the IS,
declarative and procedural knowledge in the FB (and
KB) and in Problem solver (and the KB), respectively
[14]. P I–P XI are postulates representing the concep-
tual knowledge necessary and sufﬁcient for its imple-
mentation in a computer system to make it 
 
intelligent
 
.
P I requires formulation of the problem P1 corre-
sponding to the IS class of problems (i.e., objective)
(note that P1 is the base point in the knowledge growth
scheme of evolutionary epistemology). P II character-
izes the types of object domains W (“worlds”) and
knowledge about them. Those are:
(a) W, the facts of which are random events;
(b) W, the facts of which are causal;
(c) W, such that the facts belonging to W can be both
random and causal events. P III expresses the adequacy
of the Problem solver and the object domain W: calcu-

lation and reasoning methods must be consistent with
the types of object domains (a), (b), or (c). P IV formu-
lates the condition of IS applicability to the object
domains W., e.g., for the “worlds” W of the (b) types a
class of causal models must be characterized, to which
the JSM method
 
6
 
 can be applied. P V is the central prin-
ciple that determines the structure of the Problem
solver (or, to be more precise, its main module, i.e., the
Reasoner) and the reasoning types used for data mining
(DM): formalized heuristics implemented by plausible
reasoning must be a synthesis of cognitive procedures,
which is used for solving problems by IS corresponding
the IS objective, i.e., P1 problem.
An example of such a synthesis is the JSM reason-
ing synthesizing cognitive procedures of induction,
analogy, and abduction.
P VI requires that the possibility of generated
hypothesis falsiﬁcation should be embedded in the
rules of plausible conclusion by means of search for
counterexamples (note that in the symmetrical JSM
method [1, Introduction, Chapter 4]) there are conﬂict-
ing candidate hypotheses about (
 
±
 
), viz., causes gener-
ated by the positive and negative consistency [similar-
ity] predicates M
 
+
 
 and M
 
–
 
 , respectively).
P VII (the synthesis of truth theories) is a metatheo-
retic principles reﬂecting the fact that the assessments
of propositions during DM and the hypothesis genera-
tion refer to three different truth theories, i.e., corre-
spondence theory (for FB), coherence theory (for gen-
erated hypotheses), and the pragmatic truth theory (for
generated and practically veriﬁed hypotheses).
P VIII reﬂects the invariance of the Reasoner struc-
ture with respect to the variability in object domains
and data structures. This implies that the variation in W
and data structures of the FB facts does not change the
type of rules of plausible conclusion or the structure of
the reasoning. For example, the synthesis of cognitive
procedures of the JSM method, i.e., “induction + anal-
ogy + abduction” is retained.
The next principle is P IX, i.e., the presence of IS
metalevel. This principle consists in the logic means
sufﬁcient for the inferential imitation of the Reasoner
operation. The inferential imitation of plausible reason-
ing in JSM IS is considered in [1, Part I, Chapter 5].
This imitation enables the IS investigation at the logic
level.
P X reﬂects the abductive explanation of DM results
by means of IS. Naturally, P X is connected with P V
(the synthesis of cognitive procedures).
The scheme of the abductive explanation as under-
stood by C.S. Pierce [8] for IS has the following form
 
7
 
:

FB is the fact base.
H is the set of hypotheses.
H explains FB.
 
Every h belonging to H is plausible.
In JSM IS, H = H
 
1
 
 
 
∪
 
 H
 
2
 
, where H
 
1
 
 is the set of
hypotheses about (
 
±
 
)-causes, and H
 
2
 
 is the set of pre-
dictions by inference rules by analogy using hypothe-
ses from H
 
1
 
. The assessment (the truth value) of all the
hypotheses in H has the form 
 = 
 
〈ν
 
, 
 
n
 
〉 
 
or 
 = (
 
τ
 
, 
 
n
 
),
where 
 
ν
 
 = 1, –1, 0, and 
 
n
 
 > 0 is the plausibility degree
of the hypothesis and a 
 = 
 
〈ν
 
, 0
 
〉
 
 is the truth value of
the face). Obviously, P X is the concretization and
reﬁnement of the intellectual capacity (8).
The last principle is P XI, the scheme of knowledge
growth devised in K.R. Popper’s evolutionary episte-
mology: P1–TT–EE–P2, which characterizes the pro-
cess of the IS functioning. P1 is the class of problems
being solved, TT is the QAT, part of which is the open
FB, EE is the adjustment (e.g., FB completion, chang-
ing parameters contained in facts, modifying the solu-
tion strategy for the P1 problems in the Reasoner etc.),
and P2 is a newly arising problem.
It should be noted that P I–P XI are not independent
postulates. Thus, P III follows from P IV, but the
explicit formulation of each of those singles out the
essential aspects. For P III, it is the deﬁnition of the
model class of object domains (a), (b), or (c), and for
P IV it is the speciﬁc characterization of each of these
object domains with respect to the Solver applicability.
Finally, note that not all systems of artiﬁcial intelli-
gence (AI) are 
 
intelligent systems
 
 from the viewpoint
of the above-presented deﬁnition of IS. Intelligent sys-
tems are such computer systems, which imitate capaci-
ties (1)–(13) in accordance with conceptual knowledge
reﬂected in principles P I–P XI. The “rigidity” of IS
deﬁnition makes intelligent systems the main result of
AI research, the by-products of which are AI systems
implementing its different methods, i.e., fuzzy sets,
genetic algorithms, neural networks, automatic theo-
rem proving, some methods of data analysis (e.g., deci-
sion trees), certain procedures of plausible reasoning
(induction, analogy, or abduction).
It should be emphasized once more that the imita-
tion of capacities (1)–(3) characterizing NI (or, to be
more precise, its phenomenology) by means of the
Problem solver, FB, and KB, justiﬁes classifying com-
puter systems as 
 
intelligent
 
. Principles I–XI concretiz-
ing the implementation of (1)–(13) can serve as an
“intelligence code” of a computer system. Certainly, its
reference to the IS class limits the arbitrariness in qual-
ifying computer systems as intelligent [3]. In particular,
the P XI necessitates IS involvement in the real process
of research, management, or decision-making and the
 
openness
 
 of its FB and KB; this implies that IS is a
man-machine (partner) computer system (even though
IS can also function in automatic mode).

TIMELY NOTES ABOUT THE JSM METHOD
261
 
The openness of FB and KB, the structure of the
Problem solver implementing the synthesis of cognitive
procedures and the possible interaction of logical and
computation procedures distinguishes IS from expert
systems that can be considered an elementary IS [15].
In addition, IS in view of P XI satisﬁability are capable
of evolution after discovering a new problem P2, gen-
erated by the respective improvements in the IS version
with new strategies for the solution of the problem P1.
The next section of this article will consider the pos-
sibility of constructing a certain class of new strategies
of the JSM method.
2. THE METHOD OF DIFFERENCE 
AND VARIOUS STRATEGIES 
OF THE JSM METHOD
In [1–3], J.S. Mill’s ideas were formalized concern-
ing the rules of generation of hypotheses about causes.
Those, however, only speciﬁed different variants of the
inductive method of agreement. In this section, one of
the possible formalized reﬁnements of J.S. Mill’s joint
method of agreement and difference [4] will be formu-
lated. Below, the formulations of the second and third
rules of inductive inference for the method of differ-
ence and the joint method of agreement and difference
are presented.
The 2nd canon (rule) “If an instance in which the phe-
nomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in
which it does not occur, have every circumstance in com-
mon save one, that one occurring only in the former; the
circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is
the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable part of the
cause, of the phenomenon” [4, p. 314].
The 3rd rule “If two or more instances in which the
phenomenon occurs have only one circumstance in com-
mon, while two or more instances in which it does not
occur have nothing in common save the absence of that
circumstance: the circumstance in which the two sets of
instances differ is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part
of the cause, of the phenomenon” [4, p. 317].
As J.S. Mill states, [4, p. 316] the method of agree-
ment is useful mainly as it indicates where the method
of difference must be applied. This idea is used for the
formalization of the joint method of agreement and dif-
ference below.
The joint method of agreement and difference
assumes the satisﬁability of the method of agreement
(the simple method or its version strengthened by addi-
tional conditions in the JSM method) and the existence
of the set of examples for X 
 
1
 
Y (including facts
from the FB) such that their objects (i.e., X values) sim-
ilar to the objects of positive examples but containing
no sought cause 
 
V
 
 satisfy the condition such that the
examples are estimated as (–1, 
 
n
 
) or (
 
τ
 
, 
 
n
 
) on condition
that W 
 
⊆
 
 Y, or these examples are estimated as (1, 
 
n
 
),
(–1, 
 
n
 
), (0, 
 
n
 
) or (
 
τ
 
, 
 
n
 
) but 
 
¬
 
(W
 
 ⊆
 
 Y).
 
The difﬁculty of deﬁning the method of difference
(including the joint method of agreement and differ-
ence) consists in the requirement to exclude the inﬂu-
ence of other positive causes V, different from the
sought cause V for W. Therefore, two cases are consid-
ered:
(
 
d
 
1
 
) V is the only cause of the effect (consequence) W;
(
 
d
 
2) V is not the only cause, i.e., there exist positive
causes V1, …, Vm where m  1 such that they incompa-
rable with V, (¬((V ⊆ Vi)∨(Vi ⊆ V)), i = 1, …, m).
In [4], on considering the method of difference
J.S. Mill took into account the existence of multiple
causes. Note that the multiplicity of causes is very sig-
niﬁcant in studying socio-historical phenomena. In
[16], however, Durkheim argued that in social life one
must conﬁne oneself to the existence of a single cause.
From J.S. Mill’s viewpoint, the uniqueness of the cause
is only a particular case of the ontology of natural and
social sciences.
Consider the formalization of the joint method of
agreement and difference for the case when there only
exists a single positive cause ((+)-cause) V.
In [2], the predicate 
(V, W) for the inverse
JSM method was deﬁned with the additional condition
of the unique feature of (e)+ of the (+)-cause V.8
Therefore, 
(V, W) is the predicate of positive
agreement with the condition of the cause unique fea-
ture for the inverse JSM method where x ∈ {a+, a+b+} a+,
and b+ are the indexes of the simple (+)-agreement and

By d1(l) denote the additional condition expressing
the idea of J.S. Mill’s method of difference ([4], Book III,
Chapter VIII, §1. The method of agreement,
§2. Method of difference, §3. Mutual relation of these
two methods, §4. Joint method of agreement and differ-
ence, pp. 310–319).
Let us designate by X\V the set difference operation,
then the existential condition (EC) and the condition of
empirical dependence (ED) together with the exhaus-
tiveness condition (EC), will, accordingly, be repre-
sented in the following way.
(EC)

where the exhaustiveness condition (EC) is the subfor-
mula of (ED): (
((X0 = Xi)&(Y0 = Yi)&(Z0 = Zi))),
and x ∈ {a+e+, a+b+e+}, y ∈ {a–, a–b–, a–e–, a–b–e–}, a+,
b+, e+ and a–, b–, e– are additional conditions for (+) and
(–)-predicates of the direct method of agreement
(V, W) and 
(V, W) respectively.
Therefore, the condition d1(l) for J.S. Mill’s joint
method of agreement and difference with a single
(+)-cause in the formalism of the JSM method is expressed
in the following way: d1(l) = ((EC)&(ED)&(l ≥ 2)).
Let us denote the predicate of the positive agree-
ment and difference with the condition of the cause
unique feature W by 
(V, W), then 
(V, W)
 ∃l
(V, W)&d1(l), where x ∈ {a+e+, a+b+e+}
and y ∈ {a–, a–b–, a–e–, a–b–e–} (y is the index (name)
(V, W), entering in (ED)).

tion, pp. 428−445, Chapter 3. On inference means of

(Part I, Chapter 1, The JSM method for automatic
hypothesis generation with an ordering relation,
pp. 166–191, Chapter 2. On the generalized JSM method
for automatic hypothesis generation, pp. 192–213) vari-
ous types of M-predicates of agreement were consid-
ered and p.c.-1 corresponding to those. They were used
to deﬁne different variants of the JSM method. Those
are the simple direct method of agreement, inverse
(simple) method of agreement, generalized JSM
method, situational (simple) JSM method. The above-
listed JSM methods will be called the type of the JSM
method. Each type can have a speciﬁcation in accor-
dance with the additions for empirical dependences
(ED) bσ, eσ, 
 where σ ∈ {+, –} and i = 1, 1 for two
types of the method of difference. Obviously, the
above-mentioned additions are only already formulated
conditions, and their set allows the extension in accor-
dance with the problem P1 solved in IS.
The type of the JSM method and its speciﬁcation
determine the elementary JSM strategy (Str). The inte-
gration of two JSM strategies (Str = Str1 ∪ Str2) will be
called nonelementary JSM strategy if the integration
of hypotheses H1 ∪ Η2 generated by them is consis-
tent.10
There are several possible deﬁnitions of the consis-
tency of H1 and H2.
Consider the following two deﬁnitions:
(a) H1 and H2 are consistent and there is no hypothesis
ψ1 and ψ2 in them such that ψ1 ∈ H1 and ψ2 ∈ H2 where
ψ1 = J〈ν, n〉ϕ and ψ2 = J〈μ, m〉ϕ, ν ≠ μ, ν, μ ∈ {1, –1}.
(b) The condition ν, μ ∈ {1, –1} is modiﬁed: it is
required that ν, μ ∈ {1, –1, 0}.
Obviously both in the case (a) and in the case (b) the
hypotheses J(τ, n)ϕ and J〈ν, m〉ϕ where ν ∈ {l, –1, 0} are
not considered to be inconsistent.
Let us give examples of simple elementary strate-
gies of the JSM method (JSM strategies).

(V, W), 
(V, W).
2. Simple JSM method disallowing counterexam-
ples (strong variant):

E.S. Pankratova. It was used in ISs for the diagnostics of human
papilloma in [2, Part II, pp. 388–396].

5. Simple JSM method with the predicate of agreement
and difference d1 (the condition d1(l)): 
(V, W),
(V, W).
If 
(V, W) are deﬁned by means of the deﬁni-
tions 
(V, W) in [1] (Introduction, Chapter 4), the
strategy with singular (+)- and (–)-causes can be deter-
mined:
6. 
(V, W), 
(V, W).
7. It would be interesting to deﬁne the class of strat-
egies including the condition d1(l) for the situational
version of the JSM method (a similar thing can be done
also for the class of M strategies with the ordering rela-
tion). 
Certainly, classes of strategies must be considered,
including the condition d2 without the requirement of
the cause unique feature (this goes also for the situa-
tional version of the JSM method).11
Attention should be paid to an important circum-
stance characterizing the structure of the JSM method.
The JSM method consists of two stages of reasoning
and reasoning process [3, pp. 25–26]. Stage I is the
cycle of applying successive steps of p.c.-1 (induction)
and p.c.-2 (analogy) until the stabilization point when
the generated set of hypotheses does not change any
longer. Stage II is the application of abduction. The pro-
cess of JSM reasoning is sequencing of n-th states of IS
Sn = 〈Δ2n – 1, Ω2n – 2〉 and Sn + 1 = 〈Ω2n, Δ2n – 1〉, where Δi is
the set of hypotheses about (±)-causes generated by
p.c.-1 (induction), and Ωj is the set of hypotheses gen-
erated by p.c.-2 (analogies), i.e., predictions about the
presence (absence) of effects represented in the FB.
The process of JSM reasoning implements the
abductive convergence, i.e., attaining the speciﬁed
thresholds [limits] of explanation m of the state FB:
 and 
where ρ+ and ρ– are the speciﬁed thresholds, and 
is a fragment of FB that has explanations by (+)- and
(–)-causes respectively (σ ∈ {+, –}); and FBσ and |FBσ|
is the part of FB for (±)-examples and the number of
such examples in it, according to [3, p. 25].
Therefore, the completed strategy of the JSM
method is the application of the selected strategy for
11 The formulation of the joint method of agreement and difference
of the JSM method will be published in NTI, series 2.

Stage I and Stage II and the subsequent process of the
reasoning, i.e., attaining the abductive convergence to
the thresholds ρ+ and ρ–.
The above-characterized strategies of the JSM
method are implemented in two possible modes, i.e.,
automatic and inline. The ﬁrst one is used when the
thresholds ρ+ and ρ– are reached without FB extension,
the second is employed when a sequence of FBσ exten-
sions is generated until ρ+ and ρ– are reached.
At Stage I, JSM reasoning, p.c.-l and p.c.-2 are
applied, as has already been mentioned. Those employ
the predicates 
(V, W) representing analogies
(σ ∈ {+, –, 0, τ}). P.c.-2 have the following form:
Similarly, 
 and 
(V, W) are deﬁned for
σ ∈ {–, 0, τ}.
Note that 
(V, W) as subformulas contain J(ν, n)
(Xi 
2 Yi) where ν ∈ {l, –1, 0}. These subformulas
can be equivalently substituted by formulas containing
the predicates 
(Xi, Yi) by virtue of the statement of
the inference rules invertibility of in JSM reasoning
([1], Part 1, Chapter 5). In particular, for σ = + we have
J〈1, n〉(Xi 
2 Yi) 
 (J(1, n – 1)(Xi 
2 Yi)&
(Xi, Yi)
&¬
(Xi, Yi)).
Since J(1, m)ϕ = 
J〈1, j〉ϕ,
J〈1, n〉(Xi 
2 Yi) 
 (
(J(1, j)(Xi 
2 Yi) 
&
(Xi, Yi)&¬
(Xi, Yi))). (*)
After the respective substitutions in 
(V, W) we
obtain a procedural expression [
(V, W)]x that is
called a uniform procedural expression and deﬁnes uni-
form JSM strategies such as x, where x is the index
 of the predicates entering in p.c.-1. In connection
with the above, the problem arises of deﬁning nonuni-
form JSM strategies for different x1, …, xs.
In the foregoing, the concept of elementary strate-
gies of the JSM method and the integration of two strat-
egies Str1 ∪ Str2 was deﬁned forming a nonelementary
strategy.
Let Str be the set of speciﬁed elementary strategies,
then on Str operations ∩, ∪, and relation ⊆ will be
deﬁned as follows. Let us designate by 
 and 
 the
set of all hypotheses about causes and the set of all pre-
dictions by means of analogies, accordingly, for i-th strat-
egy Stri where σ ∈ {+, –, 0, τ}. Let also Hi = Δi ∪ Γi

Obviously, the deﬁnition of nonelementary strategy
of the JSM method can be generalized for Str =
Str = Str1 ∪ Str2 was called a nonelementary strategy
if H1 and H2 are consistent, where H1 = Δ1 ∪ Γ1 and H2
= Δ2 ∪ Γ2. JSM strategies can be ordered by means of
the relation ⊆.
In the set Str it is possible to deﬁne information
(quantitative) indicators of the efﬁciency of JSM strat-
egies for hypotheses generation, i.e., the recall ratio rc
and precision ratio pr of the Str [18].
Let R1 and R2 be the set of relevant hypotheses about
the causes (with the predicate 
2) and predictions
(with the predicate 
1) where R1 = 
 ∪ 
 ∪
 ∪ 
 and R2 =

 By
relevant hypotheses either a posteriori justiﬁed (veri-
ﬁed) or a priori justiﬁed hypotheses are understood.
Note that in the ﬁrst case they are true in accordance
with correspondence theory, and in the second case
they are true according to the coherence theory of truth
that is in agreement with the postulate P VII (the syn-
thesis of truth theories).
The recall ratio of the i-th Stri will be deﬁned as fol-
lows: r

Therefore, in Str three types of partial orders by the

of the Str efﬁciency, i.e., pr and rc. Obviously, there are
relations of the partial order for 〈r

Attention should be paid to the nontrivial formation
of the sets of relevant hypotheses 
 and 
 As
has been noted above, those can be hypotheses prever-
iﬁed practically or KB elements retrieved from various
sources. This circumstance reﬂects the exploratory
character of the IS (as man-machine partner system)
and the necessity of using the successive states of the
IS, i.e., their “background.”
Obviously, the choice of strategies and the assess-
ment of their efﬁciency are performed by means of the
Problem solver using the Reasoner, Composer, and Val-
uator. Note also that IS KB of the JSM type contain
knowledge about the set of strategies Str (certainly, this
goes for a sufﬁciently sophisticated or even “ideal”
JSM IS).
3. JSM METHOD: DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS 
AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES
JSM method consisting of ﬁve components (appli-
cability condition, plausible reasoning, quasi-axiom-
atic theories as the means of FB and KB organization,
inferential imitation, and, ﬁnally, IS), is not only a
method for automatic hypothesis generation (such as
the GUHA method developed by P.G. Gaek and
T. Gavranek [18]), but primarily the means of the com-
puter support for research intellectual activity. Needless
to say, it participates in the process of problem solving
and in generating hypotheses from the available facts.
The second component of the JSM method, QAT, is
an approximate theory both in the sense of evolution-
ary epistemology (QAT is K.R. Popper’s TT) and in the
sense perhaps close to that in which J. McCarthy uses
the term “approximate theory” for the purpose of
attaining human-level AI [19]. J. McCarthy believes
that for the development of AI systems common sense
informatic situation must be used instead of the limited
informatic situations. The ﬁrst of those must employ
approximate theories, approximate concepts (or ideas,
according to the terms used in [20]), heuristics, and—
as inference means—nonmonotonic reasoning. These
constructions seem to be intended for constructive
approximation of the human cognition process in the
environment that can be implemented in AI systems
and intelligent robots. In [19], J. McCarthy points to the
difference between AI systems with bounded infor-
matic situation and the common sense informatic situ-
ation that corresponds to human reasoning that should
be imitated in AI systems.
QATs in JSM ISs contains axioms of the object
domain characterizing it only partially (i.e., approxi-
mately), axioms of data structure, axioms of reasoning
process control (axioms of the abductive explanation
FB [3, pp. 23–27], axioms of causal relevance), the

open set of facts and hypotheses, the rules of plausible
and valid (deductive) inference. By virtue of its struc-
ture and content, a QAT is the basis for the support and
implementation of the cognitive process by means of a
JSM IS that appears to provide a correspondence
between the architecture of the JSM IS and the sche-
matic structure of consciousness [11]:
where ISW is the individual’s subjective world.
This correspondence is more informative if by the
“consciousness” we understand the “phenomenology
of rational consciousness,” and by “reasoning” “pro-
ductive reasoning” [21]. Natural intelligence (NI) com-
pared with AI can be schematically characterized as
follows:
NI knowledge system (of a subject) = {(1)–(13)} +
intuition, where intuition = F (knowledge system, ISW)
is a function dependent on the knowledge system and
ISW (the nature of this function is so complicated that
its scientiﬁc description (even very approximate) is
hardly realistic in the foreseeable future). AI, as a for-
mal approach to NI, reﬁnes and approximates capaci-
ties (1)–(13) representing the phenomenology of ratio-
nal consciousness. IS as the means of NI imitation
implements the cognitive process of evolutionary epis-
temology according to the principle P XI:
P1 
 problem Solver (FB, KB) 
 EE 
 P2,
where P1 is the class of problems being solved in IS
(i.e., P I), TT corresponds to the application of the
Solver to FB and KB, EE is the analysis of the IS oper-
ation and the adjustment of problem solution strategies
in the online mode of the man-machine system, and P2
is the new problem arising after the implementation of
EE. This is K. Popper’s scheme of knowledge growth
implemented in IS systems of high-level AI. This
results in understanding that the central problem of
cognitive science must be investigation in the arising of
a new problem P2, i.e., the transition from a certain
ignorance to some new knowledge.12
The direction of research taking into account this
central problem must become structural cognitology
[11]. By structural cognitology we mean the direction
of research studying the phenomenology of conscious-
ness from the viewpoint of AI, i.e., with allowance for
the correspondence of the consciousness structure
(knowledge system + reasoning + ISW) and IS archi-
tecture ((FB + KB) + problem Solver + Interface). This
comparison becomes more realistic and constructive if
the structure of rational consciousness is considered:
knowledge system + reasoning + ISW.
12 Unfortunately, Russian cognitive scientists (linguists, psycholo-
gists, and neurophysiologists) underestimate the necessity of con-
structive investigation in the scheme P1 
 TT 
 EE 
P2 (including IS-aided research).
Consciousness = knowledge system + reasoning + ISW
IS
= 
(FB + KB) + problem Solver+ Interface,
Science, medicine, and management are the knowl-
edge spheres (although possibly understood by
J. McCarthy as bounded informatic situations) where
adequate FB and KB can be developed as well as the
heuristic of their problem solution by the Solver and
user friendly interface allowing the user to easily mas-
ter the IS as the means of the support and strengthening
of the research process.
In this case IS contain the imitation of capacities NI
(1)–(13), and the IS organization and performance
capabilities comply with the conceptual principles P I –
P XI, the model of which are JSM IS implementing
JSM method.
The artifacts resulting from the structural cognitol-
ogy investigation are cognitive systems. By cognitive
systems we understand ISs with a perceptual system of
information acquisition for FB by environmental mon-
itoring [11]. By an AI robot we understand cognitive
systems equipped by mechanical manipulators and
motion facilities. Since an A robot imitates capacities
(1)–(13) it has capacities of learning and adaptation to
the changes in the perceived situations.
Therefore, the structural cognitology develops and
studies cognitive technological pathway (CTP): IS–
cognitive systems–AI robots.
Note that ISs are not only the imitation of the ratio-
nal aspects of the phenomenology of consciousness (NI
+ ISW), but also the enhancement of human intellec-
tual capacities due to the computer-aided synthesis of
cognitive procedures (principle P V), organization of
FB and KB, computer storage capacity and speed.
In [22] M. Boden considers two understandings of
AI (or, to be more precise, two directions of research
characterized as NI imitation), viz., psychological
intelligence (PAI) and technological intelligence
(TAI).13 On must distinguish between three terms: AI,
AI systems and IS. IS is the main product of TAI, AI
systems cover both the implementation of AI methods
(e.g., methods for computer-assisted instruction and for
hypotheses generation, text comprehension, automa-
tion of argumentation and decision-making etc), ISs
proper and imitation of psychological properties of
human behavior (perceptions, emotions, and associa-
tions).
In this connection the natural question will be: are
JSM ISs the product of technological AI (TAI) or psy-
chological AI (PAI)? It appears that the subdivision of
AI into TAI and PAI is not accurate because JSM ISs
(as the product of AI) cannot be only classiﬁed as PAI
or TAI. Indeed JSM ISs are equipped by a Problem
Solver implementing plausible reasoning and com-
puter-aided instruction, i.e., formalized heuristics
“induction–analogy–abduction” 
(possibly 
supple-
mented with deduction), which implies the technologi-
cal implementation of data analysis (in FB) and deci-

sion-making (using FB and KB). At the same time JSM
ISs imitate (in an automated or an in-line mode) intel-
lectual capacities (1)–(13), which are in the sphere of
cognitive psychology. Consequently, a JSM IS as an
imitator of the rational aspects of the phenomenology
of consciousness falls both under TAI and PAI.
The history of the metaphor “artiﬁcial intelligence”
is presented in the book The future of artiﬁcial intelli-
gence [24] compiled and edited by K.Ye. Levitin and
D.A. Pospelov, who was the founder and leader of AI
investigations in the USSR and Russia. In the introduc-
tory part of the book What is an artiﬁcial intelligence?
D.A. Pospelov characterized two different understand-
ings and directions of the relevant research: (1) infor-
mation or heuristic and (2), bionic, the purpose of
which is to take into account natural psychological
properties of mental activity in solving various prob-
lems (including common sense problems). AI inter-
preted as in (1), according to D.A. Pospelov, can sug-
gest formalizations of problem solutions without allow-
ance for human capacities (this understanding of AI
corresponds to the technological AI in M. Boden’s
interpretation (TAI)). AI interpreted as in (2), evidently,
corresponds to the psychological AI (PAI) as under-
stood by M. Boden. In [24] and in detail in [25],
D.A. Pospelov attempted to describe natural human
reasoning as cognitive acts, which is very similar to
J. McCarthy’s intentions to develop common sense AI
systems (human-level AI). In this important book he
considered types of different information situations, to
which there correspond deductive (valid) conclusions,
plausible conclusions (including JSM reasoning), fuzzy
inference, reasoning by analogy, and conclusions in a
semantic network.
In his book Situation Management. Theory and
Practice [26] D.A. Pospelov systematically described
and investigated a class of information situations for
managing the situations intermediate between the
bounded (speciﬁc) situations and common sense situa-
tions (human-level AI according to J. McCarthy
[19]).14 In [26] D.A. Pospelov formulated situation-
dependent management principles, characterized its
psychological prerequisites, and proposed languages
for the description of management objects and respec-
tive situations. He also characterized the dynamic pro-
cess of updating the situations and original logic means
of decision-making. It is important to note that he tried
to identify the speciﬁcs of human common sense rea-
soning. Therefore, this book [26] is a signiﬁcant contri-
bution to the investigation and development of “human-
ized AI systems (human-level AI).
Research in the ﬁeld of PAI are of considerable
interest but practical results in this ﬁeld take a much
longer time than for TAI. The PAI development options
are brieﬂy described in [27] where human mental char-
14 In [19] John McCarthy presents his views on the development of
AI systems by means of their “hominization”.
acteristics are formulated, as well as the speciﬁc fea-
tures of language of reasoning and the well-designed
logical robot of a child. The behavior of this robot
seems to lay the foundation for the study self-con-
sciousness, i.e., observations of some of one’s own
mental processes that are essential for the scientiﬁc
understanding of the nature of intelligence.
Therefore, there are three directions of NI investiga-
tion within the AI paradigm:
(1) the technological AI is the imitation of the solu-
tion for problems of signiﬁcant intellectual difﬁculty
and with scanning data arrays too large for man to per-
form over real time;
(2) the psychological AI is the imitation of human
behavior, including mental activities and the psycho-
logical speciﬁcs of human cognitive activity (the ideas
of this trend are presented in [19] and [27], and its prod-
uct must be human-level AI systems);
(3) intelligent systems imitating rational aspects of
NI (accessible phenomenology of consciousness) (1)–
(13) formulated in this article (see also [1–3, 11]), an
example of these are JSM ISs (this direction of research
also includes also situation management [26]).
Note that an important stage in understanding the
logical nature of mental activity was found in J. Piaget’s
studies of the genesis of children’s elementary logical
structures [28], including the capacity for classiﬁcation,
using negation and the quantiﬁers “all” and “some.”
Therefore, the formation of children’s productive rea-
soning has been studied (compare this with J. McCar-
thy’s ideas in [27]), the interpretation of which is pre-
sented in [21]. However, the availability of modern
inference means of AI enables the researcher to study
the origin and application in different information situ-
ations (by children and adults) of nonelementary logi-
cal structures, such as of the synthesis of cognitive pro-
cedures (e.g., induction–analogy–abduction) as the
implementation of plausible reasoning (also including
hypotheses generation).
As has been noted above, the JSM ISs implementing
the JSM method satisfy the conceptual principle P XI,
i.e., new knowledge acquisition in accordance with the
knowledge growth scheme of evolutionary epistemol-
ogy: P1 
 Problem solver(FB, KB) 
 EE 
 P2.
This implies the JSM IS’s change and development as
a response to the newly arising problems of P2. Below
some problems are presented, the solution of which
will affect the development of new versions of JSM ISs.
1°. JSM ISs, in addition to their simple direct and
inverse methods of agreement 
(V, W) and
(V, W) [2, Part III, Chapter 3] must include their
extensions by means of conditions for the methods of
difference d1 and d2, as well as the predicates for the
generalizing method of agreement and the agreement
predicates with the ordering relation and situation exten-
sion of agreement predicates [1, Part I, Chapters 1, 2],
[2, Part III, Chapter 3]. These predicates of simple

TIMELY NOTES ABOUT THE JSM METHOD

methods of agreement induce the respective elementary
and nonelementary JSM strategies represented in KB of
JSM IS. Those can be selected after preprocessing and
comparing the results of the respective strategies Str.
2°. The comparison of applications of the JSM
method and other methods for data analysis is a delicate
problem [29, Part IV, Machine learning] (one of these
is the method of decision trees ID3). The issue is that
the JSM method of data mining (DM) can be applied in
two modes, i.e., automatic and online modes. The latter
mode is based on the process of JSM reasoning and the
formation of an adequate FB and KB by means of
abduction and abductive convergence [3]. Conse-
quently, the JSM method is not reduced to a system of
procedures applicable to a unique state of a FB. More-
over, the purpose of the JSM method is not only the DM
in a FB, but to a great extent also the fragment forma-
tion of a KB of the corresponding QAT. Therefore, the
comparison with the results only referring to a single
state of a FB is an incomplete comparison of the JSM
method with other DM methods. Moreover, various
strategies Str of the JSM method must be compared.
3°. In [3], JSM reasoning was presented as non-
monotonic reasoning with defeasible truth values.
Apparently, a version of JSM reasoning can be con-
structed with the rules of nonmonotonic inference [30]
using axioms of causal relevance (ACR(σ), σ ∈ {+, –})
representing the conditions of the abductive explana-
tion of FB [3].
4°. The JSM method, as has already been noted, is
the means of the formation of a tentative theory (TT in
evolutionary epistemology) i.e., the QAT. Therefore,
the choice of Str is performed after applying the prepro-
cessing procedures adjusting the JSM IS to an adequate
application (according to principles P III and P IV).
These procedures include the procedure of decisions
about fact insufﬁciency in the fact base of the JSM IS
with respect to the problem being solved, P1, the proce-
dure of decision making about the insufﬁciency of the
set of parameters making up the facts from the FB, as
well as the properties of the relations representable in
the FB.
The decision making about insufﬁciencies of facts
in the FB (FB incompleteness with respect to P1) must
be performed by implementing the process of JSM rea-
soning, i.e., identiﬁcation of the abductive divergence
(the rate of FB unexplainability by (±)-hypotheses
about causal dependencies [3]). The development of the
respective module in the JSM IS is necessary for a per-
fect system.
The decision making about the incompleteness of
the set of parameters in the facts and the detection of
signiﬁcant hidden parameters affecting the presence
(absence) of the studied effect represented in the facts
from the FB is a more complicated problem.15 Natu-
15 O.M. Anshakov suggested that the incompleteness of the param-
eter set can be diagnosed by detecting the redundant set of
hypotheses assessed as “contradictory facts.”
rally, the solution of this problem involves a change in
the language of knowledge representation.
The recognition of the properties of relations 
2*
(causal relation) and *3
 (consequence relation) rep-
resentable by the predicates V 
2W and W3
 V
respectively, reveals the character of the ontology16
(models of the object domain). In particular, the satisﬁ-
ability of the formulas ∀V∃!WJ〈1, n〉(V 
2W) must be
obtained for the set of hypotheses with truth values
〈1, n〉, where n > 0 (similarly for J〈1, n〉(V 
2W) with
n > 0). Obviously, the satisﬁability of these formulas
implies that 
2* is a functional relation.17
In a similar way the functionality is recognized of
the relation *3
 (“result from”) by checking the sat-
isﬁability of the formula ∀V∃!WJ〈ν, n〉(W3
 V) where
ν= ±1, n > 0,
Note that actually two relations 
2*+ and 
2*–
are considered (accordingly, +*3
 and –*3
),
which are obtained from the formulas J〈ν, n〉(V 
2W)
where ν= ±1, n > 0.
The injectiveness of the relation 
2* (*3
) can
also be evaluated by checking the satisﬁability of the
formulas
∀V1∀V2∀W1∀W2((J〈ν, n〉(V1 
2W1)&J〈ν, n〉
(V2 
2W2) &¬(V1 = V2 )) 
 ¬(W1 = W2)), 
where ν= ±1, n > 0.
For the integration of two strategies Str1 (for the direct
JSM method) and Str2 (for the inverse JSM method) the
operation of composition  and weak composition '
respectively can be deﬁned in the following way:
V1(
2**3
)V2 
 ∃n∃m∃W(J〈ν, n〉(V1 
2W1)&J〈ν, m〉(W3

)V2 
 ∃n∃m∃W1∃W2(J〈ν, n〉(V1 
2W1)&J〈ν, m〉(W2 3
 V2)&W 
= W1 ∩ W2&¬(W = ∅)),
where ν = ±1.
The knowledge about the properties of the relations
2* and *3
 and the satisfiability of axioms of
causal relevance ACR(ν) for ν = ±
∀X∀Y∃V(J〈ν, 0〉(X

characterizes the model of the object domain repre-
sented in FB and KB of the JSM IS (ACR(ν)), the above-
presented axioms, only correspond to the case with the
single (±)-cause V; ACR(ν) also have the general [com-
mon?] formulation).
5°. The decomposition of large FB into components

set of knowledge about an object domain, the language of its rep-
resentation and the method for information retrieval.

line so that the results of the JSM method application to
the decomposed parts of the FB are integrated in the
uniﬁed consistent knowledge is an important unsolved
problem of the JSM method of great applied relevance.
Possibly, in this case the approximated procedures of
the JSM method can be applied (e.g., genetic algo-
rithms for the generation of factual similarities, viz.,
candidate hypotheses about (±)-causes).
The solution of the above-listed problems 1°–5° is
feasible by virtue of the presence of the metalogical
means in the JSM method in compliance with principle
P IX (the presence of the IS metalevel).
* * *
In conclusion, let us discuss the place of the JSM
method and JSM IS in structural cognitology [11]. It
should be recalled that structural cognitology must con-
sistently implement the research direction (cognitive
technological pathway–CTP): IS–cognitive systems–
AI robots. The concretization of this scheme will be
making use of JSM IS as of intelligent systems imitat-
ing capacities (1)–(13) in accordance with the princi-
ples of IS design and of data mining P I – P XI. Signif-
icantly, JSM ISs perform the synthesis of cognitive pro-
cedures, viz., heuristics of the type “induction–
analogy–abduction,” generating a new problem P2
according to principle P XI (evolutionary epistemology
of the solution of P1 problems). For cognitive sciences,
it is obviously important how informative the imitation
(and perhaps, enhancement) of cognitive processes by
a JSM IS is. The positive answer to this question is
based on the fact that the JSM method, in an approxi-
mate way, maps the process of new knowledge genera-
tion (justiﬁed hypotheses that are not rejected by the
falsiﬁers) and in addition gives examples of informative
and veriﬁable results of JSM IS application to a wide
class of object domains (in accordance with P VIII, the
invariance of the Reasoner structure with respect to
variability of object domains and data structures [3]).
The object domains to which JSM ISs have been
applied are pharmacology, biochemistry, medical diag-
nostics, sociology, criminal science, diagnostic engi-
neering, and robotic technology (in this connection,
see [2]).
In [31] K. Jaspers characterized intelligence as the
sum of an individual’s abilities, those instruments of
performance and purpose available to him for adapta-
tion to life. He distinguishes between the preconditions
for intelligence, the inventory of actual knowledge, and
intelligence proper. As preconditions for intelligence
(those, according to [11] fall under ISW) K. Jaspers
means registration and memory, degree of fatiguability,
the mechanisms of motor phenomena, and the mecha-
nisms of the speech apparatus [31, §3. Intelligence,
pp. 266–268]. He notes that the phenomena of intelli-
gence (mental abilities) are immensely varied but the
most important of those are capacities for judgment and
a ﬂair for the essential (these capacities have been
covered by our list (1)–(13)). K. Jaspers was a little
vague in stating the relation between the system of
knowledge and intelligence proper. In [11] it was
pointed out that the necessary condition of the thinking
process was the implementation of intellectual capaci-
ties (2), (3), (4), (5) and (9). By natural intelligence (NI)
in [11] an emergent structure is understood, formed by
the system of an individual’s knowledge, capacities
(1)–(13), and intuition, i.e., NI = knowledge system (of
an individual) + {(1)–(13)} + intuition, where intuition
is the function of the knowledge system and ISW.
Therefore, the inclusion of knowledge in the concept of
intelligence is essential, both for the concept of NI and
for the concept of AI. This idea is supported by the
effect of reasoning nonmonotonicity discovered by
J. McCarthy. Inference nonmonotonicity is connected
with knowledge acquisition and certainly is a character-
istic of reasoning, which is the phenomenology of
thinking.
The imitation of NI can be implemented by the inte-
gration of two research directions of AI, i.e., PAI and
TAI, which are performed in the cognitive technologi-
cal pathway; JSM ISs, implementing the veriﬁable heu-
ristics “induction + analogy + abduction,” have proven
to be a practicable instrument of cognitive science. The
problem yet to be solved, however, is the imitation of
various ISW aspects (e.g., the development of inter-
faces that are the best ones for various personality
types).
The problems of PAI investigation, according to
[22, 23] (including the imitation of children’s intellec-
tual activities) can probably include imitation of mental
pathologies [31], implemented by “sick robots.” This,
in particular, can be a violation of heuristics, i.e., of the
synthesis of cognitive procedures (including the retar-
dation in generalizations by induction or slowdown in
the generalization transfer by analogy, or inability to
explain facts, i.e., the exclusion of the abductive
instinct as understood by C.S. Pierce).
