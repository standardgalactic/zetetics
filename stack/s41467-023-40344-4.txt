Genome editing, speciﬁcally CRISPR/Cas9 technology, has revolutionized
biomedical research and offers potential cures for genetic diseases. Despite
rapid progress, low efﬁciency of targeted DNA integration and generation of
unintended mutations represent major limitations for genome editing appli-
cations caused by the interplay with DNA double-strand break repair pathways.
To address this, we conduct a large-scale compound library screen to identify
targets for enhancing targeted genome insertions. Our study reveals DNA-
dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as the most effective target to improve
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertions, conﬁrming previous ﬁndings. We exten-
sively characterize AZD7648, a selective DNA-PK inhibitor, and ﬁnd it to sig-
niﬁcantly enhance precise gene editing. We further improve integration
efﬁciency and precision by inhibiting DNA polymerase theta (Polϴ). The
combined treatment, named 2iHDR, boosts templated insertions to 80% efﬁ-
ciency with minimal unintended insertions and deletions. Notably, 2iHDR also
reduces off-target effects of Cas9, greatly enhancing the ﬁdelity and perfor-
mance of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats - CRISPR-
associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) genome editing is a widely applied
genome-level manipulation strategy that has become an indispensable
tool for biomedical research. Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies
have demonstrated the potential for CRISPR-Cas9 to treat genetic
disorders1–3. Currently, the most widely used genome editing strategy is
based on a single guide RNA (sgRNA) directed DNA double-strand break
(DSB) mediated by Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 endonuclease (SpCas9).
The DSB caused by Cas9 triggers the activation of several cellular DSB
repair pathways4, with potentially distinct gene editing outcomes. Thus,
precise gene editing is achieved by hijacking the homology-directed
repair (HDR) pathway, which employs a homologous DNA template for
high-ﬁdelity repair. Typically, cells use the sister chromatid DNA as a
repair template for HDR5. However, in gene editing applications, an
exogenous donor DNA is used to outcompete this process and intro-
duce desired edits at the integration site. Unfortunately, HDR-
dependent genome editing in mammalian cells is limited due to the
slow HDR repair kinetics and its restriction to the S/G2 phase of the cell
cycle6,7. Consequently, most modiﬁcations in an edited cell population
represent insertions and/or deletions (InDels) due to preferred usage of
the competing DNA end-joining repair pathways, including non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) and alternative end joining (alt-EJ)8.

NHEJ is the fastest and predominant DSB repair pathway that
achieves the ligation of DNA ends without the need for a homologous
template. A critical component of the NHEJ pathway is the DNA-
dependent protein-kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) that is recruited
by the Ku heterodimer to DNA DSBs to form the DNA-PK complex, which
undergoes auto-phosphorylation and activates additional NHEJ factors9.
Subsequently, DNA ends are re-joined by DNA ligase 4 (LIG4) following
minimal or no end processing, which generally results in seamless repair
(restoring the target site) or generation of small InDels (<10 bp)10,11. In
contrast, alt-EJ is inherently prone to errors and can potentially create
larger deletions12. Alt-EJ typically uses short microhomology (MH)
sequences ﬂanking the break site and requires 3′-single-stranded DNA
substrates, which are generated by nucleolytic processing of DNA, a
process termed end resection. Though the initial steps of end resection
are shared with HDR, limited end resection is sufﬁcient to promote alt-
EJ13. DNA polymerase theta (Polϴ) is the primary but not an exclusive
mediator of alt-EJ in most eukaryotic cells. Therefore, alt-EJ through Polϴ
is referred to as Polϴ-mediated end joining (TMEJ). The helicase domain
of Polϴ most likely promotes the annealing of resected 3′ overhangs
utilising microhomologies14,15, while the polymerase domain extends
annealed sequences. Resolution involves ﬂap removal through endo-
nucleases, such as Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1)16, gap ﬁlling, and, ﬁnally,
joining of ends by DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) or DNA ligase 3 (LIG3)14,17.
Although the imprecision of DSB repair pathways produces highly
heterogenous repair outcomes, the “InDel proﬁle” of NHEJ and alt-EJ
repair is non-random, reproducible and to some extent predictable for
a given target sequence17–20. Therefore, precise and predictable end
joining repair has been successfully exploited for targeted integration
and template-free correction of InDels19,21–24. However, the ﬂexibility of
HDR, in enabling scarless installation of various genomic modiﬁca-
tions, such as point mutations, deletions and kilobase insertions,
makes it an essential modality for research and clinical developments.
Therefore, developing strategies to bias repair towards HDR is crucial
for precise genome editing applications.
Accordingly, several studies have explored using small molecules
to direct the repair pathway choice towards HDR8. For example, DNA-
PK inhibitors have been shown to decrease NHEJ and therefore
enhance HDR25–27. Recently developed potent and selective DNA-PK
inhibitors facilitate higher HDR efﬁciencies and exhibit lower cyto-
toxicity compared to earlier compounds28,29. This observation indicates
that using highly potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitors will expedite
further improvements in genome editing applications. Although DNA-
PK inhibitors result in increased HDR levels and reduction of NHEJ-
associated InDels, MH-dependent deletions are still present and occa-
sionally elevated upon DNA-PK inhibition29–31. Various reports have
shown that knockout or knock-down of Polϴ partially reduces MH-
associated deletions and minimises Cas9-related unwanted on-target
effects, such as translocations and large deletions30,32–36. Therefore,
these studies suggest that inhibition of Polϴ might contribute to
improved gene targeting efﬁciencies and mitigate undesired on- and
off-target effects, especially when combined with inhibition of DNA-PK
activity. However, small molecule inhibitors of Polϴ have only recently
started to emerge37–39. While we submitted this work for publication, a
study was published demonstrating that the Polϴ inhibitor ART55837,40
restrains the formation of large deletion and promotes HDR at CRISPR/
Cas9-induced DSBs41. However, further investigations of other poten-
tial genomic alterations are still lacking. Identifying additional inhibi-
tors with higher speciﬁcity and potency might further improve precise
genome editing.
Here, we employed a ﬂuorescence-based reporter assay to screen
a library of 20,548 small molecules for compounds that increase pre-
cision of genome editing. Furthermore, we developed a marker-free
analysis pipeline termed knock-in sequencing (KI-Seq) that enables
studying and visualising DNA repair outcomes and knock-in (KI) stra-
tegies at endogenous loci. Using KI-Seq, we evaluated the ability of
several compounds to alter DNA repair pathway choice. DNA-PK
inhibitors are the most effective molecules to modulate editing pre-
cision in our compound library. We determine AZD7648 as the most
potent and selective DNA-PK inhibitor, which reliably improves KI
efﬁciencies in transformed and non-transformed cells.Finally, we show
that using potent Polϴ inhibitors, targeting the polymerase or helicase
domain of Polϴ, combined with AZD7648 further improve KI efﬁ-
ciencies. We demonstrate that these combinations, referred here as
2iHDR, enhance homology-based templated insertions, while reducing
NHEJ/TMEJ-related mutagenic events and off-target editing.
Results
High-throughput screening platform for the discovery of com-
pounds that increase HDR and decrease end joining repair
To identify potent small molecules that enhance HDR and inhibit end
joining (EJ) repair we performed a high-throughput screening of a set
of structurally diverse compounds. We utilised the previously pub-
lished trafﬁc light reporter (TLR)42 for rapid measurement of DNA
repairoutcomes upon CRISPR-Cas9 DSB generation. In thissystem, the
mutated enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (eGFP) coding sequence
contains an in-frame stop codon and is linked to an out-of-frame
(+2 bp) Discosoma sp. red ﬂuorescent protein (DsRed) coding
sequence. Co-expression of Cas9 nuclease in the presence of a sgRNA
targeting the mutated eGFP sequence and a repair template will lead
either to the restoration of eGFP expression or activation of DsRed
expression through HDR or EJ-mediated repair, respectively. To facil-
itate the usage of the TLR system for high-throughput screening pur-
poses, we generated a clonal HEK293-TLR line by stably integrating a
single copy of the TLR construct into the AAVS1 locus (Fig. 1a).
The screening library consisted of 20,548 small molecules and
represents a diverse set of commercially available as well as internally
generated tool compounds. Most of them (91%) have annotated tar-
gets and previously reported pXC50 values (negative logarithm activity
value of in vitro measured IC50s, EC50s, Ki, Kd or percent inhibition
endpoints). Our library covered 1817 biological targets with reported
XC50 values below 100 nM. The main target classes were G–protein-
coupled receptors, transporters and ion channels, metabolite inter-
conversion enzymes, and protein kinases. The high-throughput
screening workﬂow consisted of two steps: (1) a primary screen
where all compounds were tested at 2 µM concentration; and (2) a hit
conﬁrmation screen where 380 selected compounds from the primary
screen were tested to conﬁrm their activity in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1b). The primary screen yielded 225 hits that increased EJ-
mediated DNA repair, 16 that increased both EJ repair and HDR, 91
compounds that enhanced only HDR, and 73 that improved HDR while
decreasing EJ repair (Fig. 1b, c). Next, we advanced these compounds
into the hit conﬁrmation screen. We identiﬁed 92 compounds that
increased EJ-mediated DNA repair, three compounds that increased
both EJ repair and HDR, 13 compounds that enhanced only HDR, and
43 compounds that improved HDR while decreasing EJ repair (Fig. 1b
and Supplementary Fig. S1a). Next, we investigated the annotated
targets of compounds that lead to improved HDR and decreased EJ
repair and identiﬁed DNA-PK as the primary target for 13 of the com-
pounds with measured pXC50 > 8.5 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary
Fig. S1a). Taken together, our high-throughput screening of a diverse
compound library identiﬁed DNA-PK inhibitors as potent regulators of
DSB repair pathway selection that bias the pathway choice towards
HDR, while disfavouring EJ repair.
Knock-in sequencing identiﬁes DNA repair outcomes and
informs about suitable knock-in strategies
To further proﬁle hits identiﬁed from the TLR screen through a com-
prehensive examination of DNA repair events at Cas9-induced DSBs,
we developed KI-Seq, a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based
analysis pipeline of amplicon-sequencing (Amp-Seq) data that assigns

CRISPResso243 and rational indel meta-analysis (RIMA) v2, an updated
version of the previously described RIMA quantiﬁcation method34 with
modiﬁcations that enable the analysis of Cas9-induced insertions
resulting from HDR/NHEJ, as well as InDels from NHEJ/alt-EJ (Fig. 2a).
We selected three sgRNAs for our experiments based on RIMA
analysis of a previous study44. We named them according to their main
InDel outcome, whereby gDel targeting STAT1 induces a 1 bp deletion
as the primary editing event, while gIns and gMej targeting CD34
induce a 1 bp insertion or a MH-dependent 3 bp deletion, respectively
(Fig. 2b). We used ssDNA (with homology arms) or dsDNA donor
(without homology arms) to assess 34 bp insertions mediated by HDR
or NHEJ45. KI-Seq data was classiﬁed into ﬁve DNA repair outcomes:

other InDels (Fig. 2a, c). We utilised MH-associated deletions as a
substitute to evaluate alt-EJ/TMEJ, disregarding other alt-EJ events
such as synthesis-dependent alt-EJ46. Additionally, it should be noted
that MH-mediated deletion can also result from NHEJ repair47. To
further validate our pipeline, we used the potent DNA-PK inhibitor
AZD764848 and showed improved CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR-KI
upon compound treatment (Fig. 2c). Moreover, we conﬁrmed that
dsDNA integration (NHEJ-KI) and ±1 bp InDels resulting from NHEJ-
mediated repair are inhibited by AZD7648 treatment. We also used KI-
Seq to demonstrate that SpCas9-mediated cleavage can be used to
promote directional NHEJ-mediated KIs, using predicted SpCas9
staggered cuts34,49,50. To do this, we designed dsDNA with 1 bp 5′-
overhangs complementary to the target site. dsDNA templates with
overhangs showed NHEJ-dependent directional insertions, as they
were completely prevented by DNA-PK inhibition (Supplementary
Figure S3d). Taken together, our results indicate that KI-Seq provides a
robust pipeline that enables streamlined evaluation of DSB repair
pathways and diverse KI strategies.
Next, we selected nine compounds from the TLR screen (Fig. 1c) to
assess their effect on InDel proﬁles and their ability to increase HDR or
NHEJ-mediated KIs using KI-Seq (Fig. 2d, e and Supplementary
Fig. S4a–d). The compound set included three potent DNA-PK inhibi-
tors (TLR1, AZD7648 and M9831/VX-987) and inhibitors of several DNA
repair proteins, such as ATM (AZ31)51, ATR (AZ20)52, FEN1 (FEN1-IN-1)53
and PARP1 (AZ2281)54, or cell cycle effectors such as Aurora B Kinase
(AURBK) (AZD2811)55. Additionally, we tested a LIG4 inhibitor (SCR7)
which was not included in the TLR screen but has been shown to
increase HDR56. All tested DNA-PK inhibitors increased ssDNA integra-
tion in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum of 2.9-fold increase
for 1.25–3 µM AZD7648 (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. S4c). Con-
versely, NHEJ-mediated integrations were almost completely inhibited
(Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. S4d). In addition, treatment with DNA-
PK inhibitors also led to a dose-dependent decrease of ±1 bp InDels and
a concomitant increase of deletions associated with MH (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4a, b). Furthermore, we compared these three DNA-PK inhi-
bitors with Nu7026 and M3814, two additional DNA-PK inhibitors
(Supplementary Fig. S3b, c). TLR1, M3814, M9831/VX-984 and AZD7648
belong to a newer generation of DNA-PK inhibitors, characterised by
higher selectivity for DNA-PK over other phosphoinositide 3-kinases
(PI3Ks). Both Nu7026 and M3814 have previously been shown to
enhance Cas9-mediated integrations27–29,57–60. In contrast to the DNA-PK
inhibitors identiﬁed from the TLR screen, Nu7026 showed no signiﬁcant
improvement for ssDNA integration and only partially inhibited dsDNA
integration (Supplementary Fig. S3b, c). Unlike other tested DNA-PK
inhibitors, treatment with 3 µM M3814 exhibited signs of toxicity, as
implied by a reduction of cell conﬂuency and overall poor editing efﬁ-
ciency. ATM and ATR inhibitors decreased ssDNA-mediated KI dose-
dependent (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. S4c). ATM inhibitor AZ31
increased the fraction of 1 bp duplications with a 3.2-fold increase
compared to DMSO-treated samples, which is in agreement with a
previous report using other ATM inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S4a,
b)24. FEN1 and PARP1 inhibitors did not alter the distribution of DNA
repair outcomes, although both enzymes were described to be involved
in alt-EJ repair14,61,62. Inhibition of AURBK increased total editing efﬁ-
ciency to more than 90% without altering relative frequencies. This
could potentially be linked to AURBK’s critical role in checkpoint
regulation63. The LIG4 inhibitor SCR7 showed no improvement of HDR
compared to DMSO-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. S3b, c). In
summary, we conﬁrmed that DNA-PK inhibitors are strong promoters of
HDR events, with AZD7648 exhibiting high potency and selectivity48.
AZD7648 efﬁciently promotes precise integration by inhibiting
NHEJ events in dividing cell lines
DNA repair outcomes are dependent on cell background as well as cell
cycle status64. We, therefore, investigated the effect of DNA-PK inhi-
bition on editing outcomes in various transformed (HEK293T, Jurkat
and HepG2) and non-transformed cells (human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSCs), primary human CD4 + T cells and primary human
hepatocytes (PHH)) (Fig. 3). We delivered ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
complexes of SpCas9 and gDel, gIns or gMej with or without donor
DNA via electroporation. The cells were treated with either AZD7648
or DMSO immediately following electroporation (Fig. 3a). We detected
differences in mutational signatures at the analysed loci in different
cell lines, although the most representative variant for each target site
was reproducible across different cell lines in DMSO-treated cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The most frequent template-independent
insertions resulted from NHEJ with duplications of one nucleotide
proximal to the cut site, being the most abundant event in all cell lines
except in Jurkat cells, where we noticed, as previously reported65,
peculiar 1–2 bp insertions of guanines or cytosines across all target
sites. HepG2 and PHH displayed high levels of NHEJ-mediated repair as
indicated by elevated relative frequencies of ±1 bp InDels. All cell lines
showed MH-associated deletions at all target sites. These deletions
were most frequent in HEK293T and hiPSCs. DNA-PK inhibition
reduced the number of InDels in HepG2, Jurkat, primary human T cells
and PHH and led to longer deletions with MH. HEK293T and hiPSCs
fully compensated the inhibition of NHEJ InDels with increased MH-
associated deletions (Supplementary Fig. S6). Next, we evaluated the
KI proﬁles (Fig. 3b–g). NHEJ-mediated KIs were present in all tested cell
lines (Fig. 3, NHEJ-KI). Conversely, HDR-mediated KIs were absent in
PHH, demonstrating the strict dependency of HDR on cell cycle66.
HDR-mediated integration efﬁciencies in untreated cells were well
below 10% in most cell lines across all tested loci (Fig. 3, HDR-KI).
Treatment with AZD7648 resulted in signiﬁcant gains in KI efﬁciency
across all cell lines except for PHH. For example, treatment with 1 µM
AZD7648 increased HDR-mediated KI up to 4.9-fold in HEK293T, 5.2-
fold in Jurkat, 6.1-fold in HepG2, 3.6-fold in hiPCS and maximal 12.6-
fold in primary human CD4+T cells. AZD7648 treatment consistently
reduced NHEJ-dependent InDels by up to 13.7-fold in HEK293T, 4.3-
fold in Jurkat, 3-fold in HepG2, 6.5-fold in hiPSC and 22.4-fold in pri-
mary human T cells. In summary, we demonstrated that AZD7648, a
potent and well-tolerated DNA-PK inhibitor, increases HDR-mediated
integrations and reduces NHEJ-mediated deletions across different cell
lines and genomic loci.

Simultaneous targeting of DNA-PK and POLQ increases precise
genome editing
Considering that DNA-PK inhibitor treatment increases the frequency of
long deletions with MH usage, we hypothesised that inhibition of
enzymes involved in TMEJ repair could further improve the frequency of
desirable gene editing outcomes. Accordingly, we used knock-out cell
pools featuring deletions ofgenes postulated as TMEJ mediators (PARP1,
LIG3 or POLQ) to identify potential targets suitable for a co-inhibition
strategy. We analysed InDel proﬁles at SpCas9-edited gDel, gIns and
gMej loci with and without dsDNA/ssDNA in HEK293T knock-out pools
treated with AZD7648 or DMSO. TIDE analysis67 showed knock-out
efﬁciencies of 94% (PARP1-KO pool), 92% (POLQ-KO pool) and 88%
(LIG3-KO pool). No pronounced change in InDel proﬁles for the PARP1-
KO cell pool was observed alone or in combination with AZD7648

treatment (Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). The result conﬁrms
our PARP1 inhibitor data (Figs. 1c and 2d, e) and is in accordance with a
previous study performed in mouse embryonic stem cells33. In contrast,
we observed an increase in ssDNA integration in LIG3-KO and POLQ-KO
pools on all targeted sites in combination with AZD7648 when com-
pared to wild-type cells (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). We
noticed a more pronounced KI efﬁciency improvement in AZD7648-
treated POLQ-KO compared to LIG3-KO cell pools at all tested target
sites (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). Remarkably, we detected a
strong decrease of InDels in the AZD7648-treated POLQ-KO cell pool,
leading to a high number of unmodiﬁed alleles in cells transfected with
no donor (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S7a, b) or dsDNA (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Fig. S7a, b) and almost pure KIs in cells transfected with
ssDNA (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig. S7a, b). Since we only
observed a slight increase of ssDNA integrations in AZD7648-treated
LIG3-KO pools and considering the essential role of LIG3 in mitochon-
drial DNA repair and cell viability68, we decided to focus our efforts on
Polϴ as the primary target for our dual inhibition strategy.
Potent Polϴ inhibitors combined with AZD7648 increase HDR-
mediated integrations and editing precision
A recent study reported that novobiocin, a natural antibiotic that tar-
gets bacterial topoisomerases as well as ATPases such as Hsp90, also
inhibits Polϴ39. Additionally, novobiocin has previously been used to
synergistically increase biallelic KI in combination with the DNA-PK
inhibitor M3814 in mouse embryonic stem cells69. Therefore, we eval-
uated the effect of various novobiocin concentrations in combination
with AZD7648 (1 µM) treatment on ssDNA integration (Supplementary
Fig. S8a). Similar to the previous study69, we detected only minor
effects on KI efﬁciency in double-treated cells compared to AZD7648
treatment alone, an observation that contrasts with results obtained in
our POLQ-KO pool. The discrepancy between pharmacological inhi-
bition and genetic KO studies might be due to the promiscuous nature
of novobiocin. Therefore, we initiated a literature search for a more
selective and potent Polϴ inhibitor and identiﬁed a recently reported
compound, ART55837. We also synthesised two additional disclosed
compounds that we named PolQi1 (WO2021/028643) and PolQi2
(WO202/0243459). ART558 and PolQi1 target the polymerase domain
of the enzyme, while PolQi2 inhibits the helicase activity of Polϴ.
Supplementary Figure S8b depicts the structure of PolQi1 and PolQi2,
along with the biochemical data reported in their published patents.
To validate the inhibitors and investigate their efﬁcacy on cellular TMEJ
repair, we pre-treated HEK293T cells with different concentrations of
PolQi1 or PolQi2. We assessed the mutational proﬁle at three different
target sites and found that cells treated with PolQi1 or PolQi2 showed a
partial reduction of MH-associated deletion, similar to our POLQ
knock-out pool data (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Figs. S7a, b and S8c,
d). Lastly, we compared the dose-response curves and IC50 values of
PolQi1 and PolQi2 to ART558 in the presence of AZD7648. The IC50
values were calculated based on the response of MH-mediated dele-
tion. We observed similar potency between PolQi1 and ART558, while
PolQi2 displayed approximately ten times higher potency (Supple-
mentary Fig. S8e). Next, we tested these Polϴ inhibitors for their ability
to increase ssDNA-mediated KIs and to reduce InDels in a dose-
dependent manner at the gMej target site in HEK293T cells in combi-
nation with AZD7648 (Supplementary Fig. S8f). ART558 and Pol-
Qi1 showed a similar dose-depended increase of KI efﬁciencies with
maximal improvement at a 3 µM concentration, with PolQi1 exhibiting
a better HDR to InDel ratio at 3 and 10 µM (7.7:1 and 23.3:1) compared
to ART558 (5.9:1 and 5.4:1). Interestingly, even at concentrations as low
as 0.3 µM, PolQi2 achieved the same amount of KI and an HDR to InDel
ratio of 10:1, and this was further improved with increasing con-
centrations of the compound. Next, we tested the compound combi-
nation of AZD7648 and 3 µM PolQi1 or PolQi2 at gMej, gDel and gIns
target loci in HEK293T and Cas9-inducible hiPSCs (Fig. 4e, f and Sup-
plementary Fig. S8h, i). In AZD7648-treated hiPSCs, we measured up to
a 6.6-fold increase of ssDNA integration for PolQi1 and an 11.3-fold
increase for PolQi2 inhibitor combination, while InDels were decreased
up to 2.3- and 4.9-fold, respectively. In HEK293T cells, we observed a
3.9-fold increase of HDR-mediated integration for both Polϴ inhibitor
combinations and a 17.4-fold and 56.3-fold reduction of InDels for
PolQi1 and PolQi2, respectively. Additionally, we investigated the
effect of combination treatments on cells transfected without a DNA
donor template and observed up to a 12.3-fold decrease of InDels in
AZD7648+PolQi1 and a 31.6-fold decrease in AZD7648+PolQi2 treated
cells (Supplementary Fig. S8g).
Based on the above observations, we reasoned that dual com-
pound treatment might work similarly to reduce InDels at off-target
sites in the absence of the complementary donor sequences. To test
this hypothesis, we selected two spacer sequences with well-known
off-target sites, HEK3 and HEK470. Then, we delivered SpCas9 and
sgRNA plasmids with and without ssDNA in the presence of either
AZD7648 alone or in combination with PolQi1 or PolQi2 for evaluation
of on- and off-target (seven off-target sites) gene editing activity in
HEK293T cells. Combination treatment with AZD7648 and Polϴ inhi-
bitors reduced both on-target and off-target InDels at all analysed loci
compared to DMSO or AZD7648-treated cells (Fig. 5a).
Previous studies have shown that alt-EJ repair is associated with
translocations and large deletions spanning kilobases around the Cas9
cut site33,71,72. Furthermore, NHEJ inhibition has been shown to increase,
while

of

deletions31,33. In line with this, we observed a reduction of large dele-
tions in cells treated with either PolQi1 or PolQi2 and thatadding a DNA
donor decreased large deletion frequencies in DMSO-treated cells
(Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. S9a, b). Treatment with AZD7648
increased the occurrence of large deletion in cells transfected with
ssDNA or HDR plasmid donor compared to controls, an effect that was
reversed by combination with Polϴ inhibitors. Furthermore, we

observed that combined inhibition of DNA-PK and Polϴ resulted in
cells with fewer balanced translocations when simultaneously edited at
two genomic loci (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. S9c).
Taken together, our results demonstrated that combining
AZD7648 with PolQi1 or PolQi2 improves the precision of gene editing
at various loci and in different cell lines. Moreover, simultaneous
inhibition of NHEJ and TMEJ signiﬁcantly decreases Cas9-associated
off-target effects. Hereafter, we refer to the combined DNA-PK and
Polϴ inhibition strategy as 2iHDR.
2iHDR improves targeted KI in various cell types and with dif-
ferent HDR donor templates
To evaluate the versatility of 2iHDR, we tested the strategy across
different loci, cell lines, donor templates and integration-to-cut-site

distances. First, we evaluated the effects of 2iHDR in HeLa and Jurkat
cells using endogenous gene targeting by integrating the small HiBiT
(39 bp) tag73 in ﬁve different genes. After three days, we conﬁrmed the
integration and expression of HiBiT by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)
and luminescence detection (Fig. 6a, b and Supplementary Fig. S10a,
b). Indeed, 2iHDR treatment improved editing outcomes in all cases
tested, compared to untreated controls. We observed up to a 7.4-fold
increase of HiBiT integration and a 5.8-fold increase of expression in
HeLa cells. The beneﬁts were even more striking in Jurkat cells, with a
maximal increase of 14.9-fold of HiBiT integration and an 8.7-fold
elevation in luminescence assay compared to untreated cells. In 9 out
of 10 conditions, treatment with 2iHDR using either one of the Polϴ
inhibitors exhibited improved KI efﬁciencies over AZD7648 treatment
alone. Even when integration levels were not increased compared to

AZD7648 alone, 2iHDR consistently reduced InDel formation at on-
target sites (Supplementary Fig. S11a, b).
To conﬁrm that 2iHDR can also be used with double-stranded
donor templates and larger donor integrations, we performed KIs of
the 975 bp HaloTag-HiBiT fusion tag into ﬁve loci in Jurkat cells. We
analysed the cells for HaloTag-HiBiT insertions 14 days after transfec-
tion using ddPCR and luminescence detection of HiBiT. Dual
compound treatment increased KI efﬁciencies up to 31-fold (lumines-
cence) or 25.7-fold (ddPCR) compared to untreated cells (Fig. 6c and
Supplementary Fig. S10c). At four targeted sites, 2iHDR incorporating
either one of the Polϴ inhibitors showed higher integrations than
AZD7648 treatment alone.
Notably, integration efﬁciencies were detected after 2 weeks,
which indicates that KIs produced by 2iHDR are stable over time and

that cells were still able to proliferate after treatment. To conﬁrm this,
we performed HaloTag-HiBiT integration in Jurkat cells at four differ-
ent loci, as described above, followed by single cell sorting and
expansion for about three weeks. We measured 5.3-fold HDAC2, 14-fold
MAPK8, 15-fold NRAS and 4.8-fold NR3C1 increase of HiBiT positive
clones in 2iHDR treated cells (Fig. 6d). Analysis with ddPCR revealed
that more than 80% of the positive clones are homozygous for
HaloTag-HiBiT integration (Fig. 6e). This result conﬁrmed that 2iHDR
treated cells could proliferate in the presence of stable, homozygous
integration of large genetic payloads.
Next, we tested the performance of 2iHDR treatment in primary
T cells by integrating a GFP expression cassette into the TRAC locus. To
this end, we delivered RNPs and a GFP encoding dsDNA homology-
directed repair template (HDRT) into T cells isolated from three
healthy donors. KI efﬁciency in untreated cells was below 5%, whereas
DNA-PK inhibition improved efﬁciency by 2.6- to 4.6-fold. Treatment
with 2iHDR yielded additional improvements, with 2iHDR using
AZD7648+PolQi1 showing a 4.0- to 6.0-fold increase and 2iHDR using
AZD7648+PolQi2 showing a 3.5- to 8.6-fold increase (Fig. 6f). Fur-
thermore, 2iHDR treatment did not signiﬁcantly affect cell viability
while increasing KI+ cell yields for two out of three T cell donors
compared to DNA-PK inhibition alone (Supplementary Fig. S10d).
Overall, our data show that 2iHDR treatment is a convenient and
powerful method to improve the efﬁciency and precision of CRISPR-
Cas9 genome editing with broad applicability across multiple genomic
loci and in various cell lines and primary cell models.
Discussion
The CRISPR-Cas system is a highly versatile tool to introduce targeted
DNA lesions. Upon DNA cleavage, repair is accomplished through
activation of intrinsic mechanisms, yielding target site-speciﬁc DNA
modiﬁcations, such as deletions and insertions. However, the main
obstacle to achieve precise genome editing is that HDR, the DNA repair
pathway yielding precise editing, is not frequently used and is com-
monly outperformed by NHEJ and alt-EJ pathways, both resulting in the
formation of InDels and imprecise edits. To address this problem, we
conducted a high-throughput screening campaign to identify and
validate compounds that enhance HDR while reducing undesirable
side effects of Cas9 treatment. We focused on manipulation of the
HDR pathway since this strategy has been previously established to
improve the precision and efﬁciency of CRISPR-Cas9 genome
engineering74. The identiﬁcation of numerous DNA-PK inhibitors as
enhancers of precision KI conﬁrmed the key role of NHEJ in modulat-
ing HDR. We found that the new generation of DNA-PK inhibitors
strongly decreases NHEJ and subsequently increases HDR, in line with
their improved potency and selectivity48,60. Accordingly, we selected
AZD7648 as the lead compound due to its strong enhancement of
promoting KIs across different target sites in various cell backgrounds
and its established safety record48.
To further characterise the effects of AZD7648 and other small
molecules that emerged from our screening campaign, we developed
KI-Seq, an NGS-based pipeline that neither depends on a single pre-
deﬁned sgRNA nor requires previous transgene integration, therefore
extending its utility to any cell type, including non-dividing primary
cells. This allowed us to perform an unbiased analysis of InDel proﬁles
and to determine the contribution of not only HDR but also of NHEJ and
alt-EJ DNA repair following CRISPR-Cas9 treatment. Unlike most open-
access analysis tools that separate Cas9-induced DNA cleavage events
into homology-directed KIs and combine all other mutation types into a
single category43,75,76, KI-Seq provides a much more detailed analysis.
For example, we conﬁrmed that treatment with ATM inhibitors pro-
motes +1 bp duplications24 and observed that AURBK inhibitor stimu-
lates an increase across all editing events. In addition, KI-Seq enables the
analysis of exogenous dsDNA donor capture after DSB formation, which
is of notable interest in HDR-deﬁcient, non-dividing cells and under-
scores the key role of NHEJ repair in these cell types23,77. Using KI-Seq, we
demonstrated that AZD7648 and other DNA-PK inhibitors increase
ssDNA integration in a dose-dependent manner while inhibiting NHEJ-
mediated integration and increasing deletions associated with micro-
homologies. Therefore, from these studies, we conclude that AZD7648
is a potent DNA-PK inhibitor that increases ssDNA integration and
reduces NHEJ-mediated deletion across different cell lines.
We next asked how inhibition of both NHEJ and alt-EJ affects
editing outcomes. In fact, we and others have previously shown that
alt-EJ plays a dominant role in InDel generation upon DNA-PK inhibi-
tion after Cas9-induced DSB29–31. These ﬁndings suggested that addi-
tional pharmacological inhibition of the alt-EJ repair pathway,
including Polϴ, might lead to a further increase of HDR. Using genetic
deletion, we conﬁrmed that POLQ-KO combined with AZD7648 treat-
ment results in improved HDR-mediated precision gene editing. In this
study, we tested three recently reported inhibitors, which either tar-
geted the polymerase (ART558 and PolQi1) or the helicase domains
(PolQi2) of Polϴ. Notably, all three Polϴ inhibitors increased integra-
tion efﬁciencies in combination with AZD7648. These results led us to
propose that combination treatment with both DNA-PK and Polϴ
inhibitors (2iHDR) is a powerful strategy to dramatically improve the
performance of precision KI gene editing. The 2iHDR strategy con-
sistently performed better than untreated controls in increasing KI
efﬁciencies independent of template sizes and donor formats, such as
ssDNA or plasmids. We anticipate that 2iHDR could be combined with
other non-viral74 and viral HDR78 templates to improve HDR-mediated
genomic integrations. In addition, we observed an increase in precise
integration to InDel ratios for short insertions across all tested target
sites in various cell types with 2iHDR compared to AZD7648 alone.
Another advantage of our 2iHDR approach is the reduction of InDel
rates at target sites, therefore allowing secondary retargeting of the
wild-type allele to further boost the editing efﬁciencies. Importantly,
we also noticed a signiﬁcant decrease in off-target editing when using
2iHDR, suggesting that dual inhibition of NHEJ and TMEJ could
potentially improve the overall safety of CRISPR-Cas9 treatments69.
Overall, these results indicate that the developed 2iHDR approach is
superior to previously described strategies targeting only DNA-PK.
A current shortcoming of KI-Seq is the requirement of small
amplicons for variant analysis, preventing the investigation of complex
DNA rearrangements. To overcome this limitation, we applied ddPCR
and long-read sequencing allowing for detailed analyses of large on-

target deletions and translocation events. In line with previously
published data41, we noticed that 2iHDR treatment does not affect
Cas9-associated on-target large deletions and leads to a reduction of
translocation events. These ﬁndings present an additional advantage
of 2iHDR over the treatment with AZD7648 alone, where we detected
an increase in large deletions. However, based on this study, we cannot
exclude the possibility that 2iHDR has uncharacterised, undesirable
side effects and further studies investigating the genome-wide impact
of simultaneous NHEJ/MMEJ inhibition on the repair of spontaneously
occurring DSBs are needed.
Going forward, we anticipate that both KI-Seq and 2iHDR will
accelerate the use of CRISPR-mediated KI for research and clinical
applications, given their broad applicability across a wide range of cell
lines and signiﬁcantly improved performance over existing strategies.

ethical approval in place for collection of the samples for research
purposes including use by for-proﬁt companies. The AstraZeneca
Biobank in the UK is licensed by the Human Tissue Authority (Licence
No. 12109) and has National Research Ethics Service Committee
(NREC) Approval as a Research Tissue Bank (RTB) (REC No 22/NW/
0102) which covers the use of the samples for this project. NHS Blood
& Transplant (NHS-BT UK) has provided material in support of the
research. The views expressed in this publication are those of the
author(s) and not necessarily those of NHS Blood & Transplant. Pri-
mary human T cells were derived from the blood of healthy donors
recruited through AstraZeneca’s voluntary blood donation pro-
gramme, which was approved by AstraZeneca’s institutional review
board and local ethic committee (033-10). Informed consent was
obtained for all human donors included in this study.
Plasmids
Codon optimised SV-40 NLS-SpCas9-T2A-GFP was synthesised and
cloned downstream of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Spacer
sequences for sgRNA transcription were cloned under the control of
the U6 promoter containing the previously described sequence of the
SpCas9 scaffold79. The spacer sequence was synthesised as DNA oligos
with four bp 5′-overhangs complementary to the vector backbone.
DNA oligos (Sigma-Aldrich or Integrated DNA Technologies) were
annealed and ligated into AarI (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) linearised
vector DNA using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Plasmids were transformed in DH5-alpha or
DH10-beta chemo-competent Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells (New Eng-
land Biolabs). Transformed bacteria were grown in LB medium sup-
plemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin or 100 µg/mL carbenicillin.
Plasmid and sgRNA sequences can be found in Supplementary Note 1
and Supplementary Data 1. The sequence ﬁdelity of cloned constructs
was conﬁrmed through Sanger-sequencing (Genewiz/Azenta).
Donor templates
ssDNA donor templates were ordered with two 5′- and 3′-terminal
phosphorothioate linkages (Integrated DNA Technologies). Blunt-
ended dsDNA donors for NHEJ-mediated integrations were generated
by annealing two phosphorothioate end-modiﬁed oligos as described
before70. HaloTag-HiBiT plasmid (pUCIDT-AMP) donor was synthe-
sised by Integrated DNA Technologies. GFP dsDNA homology directed
repair template (HDRT) were synthesised, cloned into vectors as
required and sequence veriﬁed by external vendors (GenScript). HDRT
was ampliﬁed from plasmid DNA (pAAV-SA-2A-GFP) by PCR using
Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
and primers anchored in the homology arms of the HDRT speciﬁc for
KI at the human TRAC locus (Merck). PCR amplicons (typically 2.5 mL)
were puriﬁed using NucleoMag NGS Clean-up and Size Select
(Macherey-Nagel) following the manufacturer’s instructions and
eluted in 450 µL distilled water. Subsequently, puriﬁed HDRT was
concentrated using Amicon Ultra-2 Centrifugal Filter Units (Merck)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, yielding typically 5 µg
(25 µL) of HDRT. HDRTs were diluted as required for future experi-
ments (typically 1.5 µg/µL) in distilled water. Puriﬁcation and size of
dsDNA HDRTs were conﬁrmed by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose
gel. All sequences are available in Supplementary Data 3.
Synthetic guide RNAs
Modiﬁed synthetic sgRNAs were ordered from Agilent, Synthego or
Integrated DNA Technologies. For HiBiT and HaloTag-HiBiT integra-
tions, Alt-R CRISPR RNA (crRNA), Alt-R transactivating crRNA
(tracrRNA) and nuclease-free duplex buffer were obtained from Inte-
grated DNA Technologies. sgRNA was prepared by incubating 1 nmol
crRNA, 1 nmol tracrRNA, and nuclease-free duplex buffer in a ﬁnal
volume of 50 µL at 95 °C for 5 min and then cooled to room tempera-
ture. Spacer sequences are summarised in Supplementary Data 1.

Cell culture
HEK293T cells (parental clone HEK-293, ATCC CRL-1573; Genhunter
corporation Q401) and HEK293T-KO cell pools (PARP1-/-, LIG3 -/-
POLQ-/-, Synthego, CRISPR KO pool) were maintained in DMEM
(+GlutaMAX, High Glucose), with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HepG2
(ATCC, HB-8065) were cultured in MEM (+GlutaMAX) with 1% (v/v)
sodium pyruvate and 10% FBS. Jurkat cells (DKMZ, ACC-282) were
maintained in RPMI1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (all reagents
from Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Jurkat cells for HiBiT and
HaloTag-HiBiT experiments (TIB-152, American Type Culture Collec-
tion) were maintained in HEPES-Buffered RPMI (Gibco) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Seradigm).
The hiPSC line (R-iPSC Clone J, LineID: iPS.1) was derived from
foreskin-ﬁbroblasts using the Stemgent mRNA Reprogramming Kit
(Stemgent) as described previously80 and maintained in the feeder-free
culturing system Cellartis DEF-CS 500 (Takara). The inducible SpCas9
cell line was generated as described earlier81.
Primary human T cells were derived from the blood of healthy
donors recruited from the AstraZeneca voluntary blood donation
programme. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from
fresh blood using Lymphoprep (STEMCELL Technologies) density
gradient centrifugation. Total CD4 + T cells were enriched by negative
selection with the EasySep Human CD4 + T Cell Enrichment Kit
(STEMCELL Technologies) to an average purity of 90%. CD4 + T cells
were propagated in RPMI-1640 medium containing the following
supplements 1% (v/v) GlutaMAX-I, 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% (v/v) L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin and
streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (all from Gibco, Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Activation of T cells was performed with the T Cell
Activation/Expansion kit (Miltenyi). In all, 1 × 106 cells/mL were mixed
with beads using a bead-to-cell ratio of 1:2, and 2 × 105 cells were see-
ded per well of a 96-well round-bottom tissue culture plate and

incubated for 24 h. The cells were pooled before electroporation and
cultured in antibiotic-free medium for 24 h after electroporation.
Cryopreserved PHH were derived from a de-identiﬁed individual
donor (F00995-P, Lot.: VNL, BioIVT). One vial of frozen PHH (~5 × 105
cells) was thawed in 50 mL of Cryopreserved Hepatocyte Recovery
Medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). After nucleofection cells
were seeded on collagen-coated 96-well cell culture plates (Corning,
SigmaAldrich) containing culture medium (Williams’ Medium E, 1%
(v/v)
L-glutamine-penicillin-streptomycin,
0.1 µM
dexamethasone
(Sigma-Aldrich), 1% (v/v) insulin-transferrin-selenium (Thermo Fisher

changed to serum-free culture medium with 0.25 mg/mL Matrigel
Basement Membrane Matrix (Corning, Sigma-Aldrich). Serum-free
complete culture medium was changed daily. All cells were maintained
at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Primary human CD3 + T cells were isolated from a healthy donor
Leukopaks (NHS-BT UK). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated from whole blood by Ficol centrifugation using SepMate
tubes
(STEMCELL
Technologies)
and
subsequent
isolation
of
CD3 + T cells using negative selection isolation kits (STEMCELL Tech-
nologies) following the manufacturer’s instructions. CD3 + T cells were
cultured in TexMACS Medium (Miltenyi Biotech) supplemented with
5% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Merck), 100 units/mL penicillin
(Merck) and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Merck) and 300 IU/mL IL-2
(STEMCELL Technologies). T cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/mL
(typically 10 × 106 cells per well of a six-well plate) and activated with
ImmunoCult T Cell activator (STEMCELL Technologies) following
manufacturer’s instructions. 72 h post activation, editing was per-
formed as described below. Cells were passaged, and media was
changed as appropriate to maintain culture density as above. Sex and/
or gender was not considered in the study design.
Cell lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contaminations,
and cell identity was conﬁrmed through STR proﬁling.
Generation of HEK293T trafﬁc light reporter cell line
The trafﬁc light reporter (TLR) construct was designed similar to
Certo et al.42 consisting of a defective enhanced green ﬂuorescent
protein (eGFP) mutated in amino acids 65-67 (eGFPm) and linked to
out-of-frame T2A and DsRed under CMV promoter42. Sequences are
provided in Supplementary Data 1. For TLR cell line generation, the
TLR construct was stably integrated into the AAVS1 locus of
HEK293T cells using ObLiGaRe21. The ObLiGaRe-TLR construct was
co-transfected with zinc-ﬁnger nuclease (ZFN)-AAVS1 plasmid in a 1:3
ratio using FuGENE transfection reagent (Promega) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Transgene integration selection was
performed with puromycin (Gibco) before single cell clones were
generated by limited dilution. Clonal HEK293-TLR cells were validated
for transgene integration in the AAVS1 locus with junction PCR and
copy number integration using ddPCR (Supplementary Data 2).
Junction PCR was performed with Extensor Hi-Fidelity PCR Master
Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in a 20 µL reaction using 500 nM of
target-speciﬁc primers and the following cycling conditions: 94 °C for
2 min, 35x (94 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, 68 °C for 45 s) and 68 °C for
7 min. ddPCR set-up was as follows; the ﬁnal ddPCR PCR reaction
contained 1× ddPCR Supermix for Probes, no dUPT (Bio-Rad), 1× FAM-
labelled puromycin assay (BioRAD), 1× AP3B1-HEX-labelled human
reference assay (dHsaCP1000001, BioRAD), 1/40 HindIII (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) and 50 ng genomic DNA. Automated droplet gen-
eration, PCR ampliﬁcation, droplet reading, and analysis was per-
formed as described below for the translocation assay. In brief,
probes targeting puromycin were normalised to the AP3B1 reference
assay for copy number integration analysis. A clone with single-copy
integration was selected and expanded. For the TLR screen, 1 × 108
HEK293-TLR cells were electroporated with 75 µg plasmid containing
SpCas9 and eGFP-targeting sgRNA sequence, and 125 µg HDR donor
plasmids using MaxCyte STX (Maxcyte). Electroporated cell pools
were cryopreserved until further use.
TLR screen
In the primary TLR screen 20,548 compounds were tested at 2 µM
(n = 1). For the screen, 5000 transiently transfected HEK293-TLR cells
were seeded per well of a 384-well poly-D-lysine-coated cell culture
plate (Greiner) containing the library compounds, DMSO (negative
control), or 1 µM KU0060648 (positive control)82. The plates were
incubated for three days at 37 °C before medium was removed and
cells were detached with Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) (Gibco). FACS buffer
(PBS, pH 7.4 (Gibco) 1 mM EDTA (Ambion), 2% (v/v) FBS (Gibco) and FL-
4 well identiﬁcation beads (AH Diagnostic) were added to the wells and
cells were transferred to 384-well round bottom plates (Corning).
Samples were analysed with the Intellicyte iQue screener (Sartorius)
and ForeCyt® Enterprise Client Edition 6.2 Software. The gating strat-
egy is detailed in Supplementary Fig. S1b.
Samples eligible for the screen contained more than 1000 cells
per well. Gates were deﬁned based on control samples as follows;
DsRed-positive cells >15% as an increase of EJ and DsRed-positive cells
<8% as decrease of EJ. GFP-positive cells >4.5% were considered as an
increase of HDR events. Compounds were regarded as inactive for
DsRed-positive cells <15% and GFP-positive cells <4.5% (Fig. 1c).
To validate the results of the primary screen 380 compounds were
re-analysed in a second hit conﬁrmation screening round. To investi-
gate if the effects of HDR and EJ were dose-dependent, all compounds
were tested in a ten-point dilution series with dilution factor three
ranging from 10 µM to 0.51 nM. Compound exclusion criteria were
GFP/DsRed ﬂuorescence values above 50% (false-positives) and lack of
dose-dependency in the secondary screen. Compounds with random
effects on a few points and no dose-response were considered inactive.
Transfections – plasmid delivery
HEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates (15,000–25,000 cells/
well), 48-well plates (45,000 cells/well) or 24-well plates (90,000 cells/
well) 1 day prior to transfections. Compound treatment was initiated
1–4 hours before transfections with FuGENE HD transfection reagent
(Promega) following the manual. In all, 50 ng of SpCas9, 30 ng of
sgRNA were transfected with 1 pmol of dsDNA donor or 1–2 pmol of
ssDNA donor per well of a 96-well plate. For large deletion analysis,
115 ng SpCas9, 70 ng of sgRNA (targeting HBEGF or non-targeting
sgRNA) and 180 ng of HDR donor plasmid or 3 pmol of ssDNA were
used per well of a 48-well plate. For the translocation assay, 375 ng
SpCas9 and 120 ng of each sgRNA targeting PCSK9 and HBEGF were
transfected per well of a 24-well plate. Respective controls were set up
with non-targeting sgRNAs.
Transfections – sgRNA delivery to inducible Odin-SpCas9 hiPSC
ODinCas9-inducible hiPSC81 were reverse transfected with sgRNAs
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
according to the manual. In short, cells were sub-cultured 1 day before
transfections. The next day, SpCas9 expression was induced with
doxycycline (10 µg/mL) for 1 h. After 6 hours, cells were washed with
PBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), detached with TrypLE Express
Enzyme (no phenol red, Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) and resus-
pended in cell culture medium. In all, 1.28 × 104 cells were mixed with
29 ng of sgRNA, 0.25 pmol of ssDNA or dsDNA, 0.3 μL RNAiMax in 5 μL
OptiMEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). The cells were seeded into
96-well cell culture plates containing culture medium with DMSO or
inhibitors.
Transfections – RNP preparation and delivery
To prepare RNP complexes, Alt-R SpCas9 nuclease v3 (IDT) and sgRNA
were incubated in a 1:1 molar ratio for 5–10 min at room temperature.
RNPs were kept on ice until electroporation. Immediately before

transfections, DNA donors, electroporation enhancer oligo and cells
were added to the RNPs. Prior to electroporation, cells were washed
with PBS and cell number and viability were assessed using a Cedex
HighRes (Roche) or Vi-cell XR (Beckman Coulter) cell counter. Cells
were resuspended in respective electroporation/nucleofection buffer
HEK293T cells and HepG2 in SF Buffer (SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X
Kit, Lonza), Jurkat cells in SE buffer (SE Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit,
Lonza), PHH in P3 buffer (P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit,
Lonza) and primary human CD4 + T cells in R buffer (Neon Transfec-
tion System). For electroporations, 2 × 105 HEK293T cells, 3.5 × 105
HepG2 cells and 2 × 105 PHH were combined with 100 pmol SpCas9,
100 pmol sgRNA, 40 pmol ssDNA and 60 pmol electroporation
enhancer oligo, or 20 pmol dsDNA and 100 pmol electroporation
enhancer oligo. In all, 5 × 105 Jurkat cells were electroporated with
25 pmol SpCas9, 25 pmol sgRNA, 25 pmol ssDNA or 25 pmol dsDNA
and 25 pmol of electroporation enhancer oligo. In all, 5 × 105 primary
human CD4 + T cells were electroporated with 30.5 pmol SpCas9,
36 pmol sgRNA, 25 pmol ssDNA or 25 pmol dsDNA, and 40 pmol
electroporation enhancer. The following Lonza 4D-Nucleofector pro-
grams were used: HEK293T: CM-130, HepG2: EH-100, Jurkat: CL-120
and PHH: EX-147. Primary human CD4 + T cells were electroporated
using the Neon system (Invitrogen) applying the following settings:
1600 V, width: 10 ms, and pulse number: 3. Afterwards, cells were
distributed into six wells of a 96-well cell culture plate containing
culture medium with DMSO or inhibitors.
Integration of HiBiT and HaloTag-HiBiT tags
HiBiT integration at the different target sites required various cut-site-
to-insert distances, depending on available protospacer sequences
(integration distance to cut sites were: CTNNB1: 14 bp, HDAC2: 2 bp,
MAPK8: 26 bp, NRAS: 10 bp, NR3C1: 12 bp). Whenever possible, we
introduced additional silent mutations in the PAM. Prior to electro-
poration, cells were pre-treated for 24 h with combinations of 1 µM
AZD7648, 3 µM PolQi1, or 3 µM PolQi2. RNP complexes were assembled
by incubating 100 pmol SpCas9 and 120 pmol gRNA in a ﬁnal volume
of 10 µL nuclease-free duplex buffer for 10 min at ambient tempera-
ture. 6 ×105 cells were resuspended in 100 µL Ingenio Electroporation
Solution (Mirus), and RNP complex with either 100 pmol ssODN or
7.5 µg plasmid donor DNA was added to the cell suspension. Cells
containing RNP and donor DNA were electroporated at 150 V using the
Ingenio EZporator Electroporation System (Mirus). Cells were incu-
bated at ambient temperature for 5 min and transferred to a six-well
plate containing 2 mL growth medium with or without combinations
of 1 µM AZD7648, 3 µM PolQi1, or 3 µM PolQi2. HiBiT and HaloTag-
HiBiT insertions were analysed 3- and 14-days post-electroporation,
respectively.
HiBiT detection assay
To screen for integration, 2 × 104 cells were plated in solid white 96-
well tissue culture plates (Corning 3917) in 100 µL growth medium.
HiBiT was detected using the Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Detection System
(Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, 100 µL of
Nano-Glo HiBiT Lytic Detection Reagent was added directly to the cells
and incubated for 5 min on an orbital shaker (300 rpm) before
recording luminescence on a GloMax Discover (Promega) with 0.2 s
integration time.
Clonal isolation of HaloTag-HiBiT transfected Jurkat cells
Pools of edited cells were resuspended to 5 × 106 cells per mL in sorting
buffer (DPBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 10 mM HEPES (Gibco,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 0.2% FBS, and 10 units per mL of penicillin-
streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), passed through a
35 µm mesh ﬁlter (Corning, Falcon) to disperse clumps, and loaded
onto the BD FACSMelody (BD Biosciences) cell sorter. Single cells
were sorted into each well of solid white 96-well tissue culture plates
(4–5 plates) (Corning) containing 150 µL growth medium per well. Cells
were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until colonies formed (~3 weeks). To
screen cells for HiBiT insertion, replica plates were generated by
transferring 50 µL of cell suspension to a new plate. Luminescence in
the replica plated cells was immediately measured using the lytic HiBiT
detection assay (described above), and luminescence positive clones
from the corresponding well in the parental plate were expanded.
ddPCR analysis of HiBiT and HaloTag-HiBiT integration
Genomic DNA was puriﬁed by warming the frozen cell pellets to room
temperature and adding 50-100 uL of PBS, vortexing, and transferring
the cells into cartridges of the Maxwell RSC Cultured Cells DNA Kit
(Promega).
DNA
was
quantiﬁed
with
the
NanoDrop
spectro-
photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) or QuantiFluor ONE dsDNA
System (Promega) using QuantiFluor ONE Lambda DNA (Promega) as a
DNA standard, and a GloMax Discover Microplate Reader (Promega
GM3000); all DNA samples were diluted to 2-10 ng/µL for ddPCR.
ddPCR was performed using a QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System
(Bio-Rad) or a QX ONE Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) following
the manufacturer’s recommendations. PCR conditions employed the
ddPCR Supermix for Probes (No dUTP) (BioRad), and the amount of
DNA was about 25-50 ng puriﬁed genomic DNA per reaction for pools
and 2–10 ng DNA for clones. PCR conditions were modiﬁed for larger
amplicons utilising Subcycling-PCR83,84 (PCR condition: HiBiT integra-
tion (95 °C 30 s, 50x (95 °C 15 s, 4x (62 °C 15 s, 72 °C 30 s) 72 °C 5 min,
4 °C hold)); HaloTag-HiBiT integration (25 °C 1 min, 95 °C 10 min, 50x
(95 °C 10 s, 62 °C 15 s, 72 °C 3 min30 s, 62 °C 15 s, 72 °C 3 min, 62 °C 15 s,
72 °C 3 min) 4 °C 5 min, 25 °C 2 min). Primer and probes are shown in
Supplementary Data 2). HiBiT knock-in pool detection assay included
two gene-speciﬁc primers spanning the targeted site and one gene-
speciﬁc probe outside the homology arms. Such as, both KI and non-
inserted allele produces a ﬂuorescence signal. Additionally, a HiBiT
detection probe is added, only producing ﬂuorescence signals in KI
alleles. KI levels were calculated by the ratio of HiBiT-to-gene-speciﬁc
signal. For HaloTag-HiBiT detection, the assay contained two gene-
speciﬁc primers outside of the homology arms, paired with two pri-
mers at the 3′ and 5′ end within the HaloTag encoding region. A
ﬂuorescent gene probe was used to detect the gene coding region in
the 5′ ﬂank amplicon, and a ﬂuorescent probe to HiBiT was used to
detect the 3′ ﬂank amplicon. Thus, a KI allele of HaloTag generates a
signal with the gene-speciﬁc probe from the amplicon with 5′ gene-
speciﬁc primer and the 3′ end HaloTag primer, and with the HiBiT
probe in the amplicon of the 5′ end HaloTag primer and the 3′ gene-
speciﬁc primer. Alleles that do not receive a KI will only give a signal
with the gene-speciﬁc probe and the 5′ gene-speciﬁc primer and the 3′
gene-speciﬁc primer. All signals were compared to that of RPPH1 on
chromosome 14, which is expected to be diploid, and therefore the
ratio of the 5′ ﬂank or 3′ ﬂank positive droplets would represent the
percentage KI, expressed as percent, of HaloTag-HiBiT into the gen-
ome. For the detection of HaloTag-HiBiT in cell clones, the ratio of
HiBiT to the gene-speciﬁc signal represents the number of chromo-
somes with a KI for each clone and was used to establish whether each
clone was heterozygote or homozygote for HaloTag-HiBiT.
GFP integration in TRAC locus of primary human CD3+ T cells
Integration of GFP expression cassette into the TRAC locus was per-
formed as described previously85. CD3+ T cells were activated for 72 h
with ImmunoCult T cell activator (STEMCELL Technologies) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were treated with inhibitors or
DMSO 5 hours before electroporation. RNPs were produced by com-
bining 100 pmol of synthetic sgRNA (Merck; resuspended in TRIS-
EDTA (pH 7.5)) with 40 pmol recombinant SpCas9 protein at room
temperature for 30 min using a 2.5:1 molar ratio of sgRNA to SpCas9.
Immediately prior to electroporation, CD3+ T cells were pelleted by
centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min, washed once in PBS and

resuspended to 1 × 105 cells/µL in Lonza electroporation buffer P3. In
all, 1 × 106T cells were mixed with the CRISPR/Cas9 RNP and dsDNA
HDRT (3 µg) in 25 µL total volume in a 96-well v-bottomed plate before
being electroporated using the Lonza 4D 96-well electroporation sys-
tem, pulse code EH-100. After electroporation 125 µL pre-warmed
medium was added to each well of the electroporation plate and cells
were carefully transferred to culture vessels. Cells were either cultured
in the presence of DMSO or inhibitors. In all, 24 h post electroporation
medium was changed to remove inhibitors and 7 days later KI fre-
quencies were determined through GFP detection by ﬂow cytometry
using the BD LSR-Fortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Bioscience) and FlowJo
v10.8.0. At the same timepoint cell viability and live cell counts were
determined using the Cellometer Auto 2000 (Nexcelom).
ddPCR translocation assay
The translocation assay targets PCSK9 and HBEGF and was performed
as described previously86. In short, genomic DNA was isolated from
HEK293T cells 3 days after transfections using the Gentra Puregene
Cell Kit (Qiagen) and was diluted to 10 ng/μL. Custom ddPCR assays
were
ordered
from
Bio-Rad
detecting
balanced
translocations
between PCSK9 and HBEGF (Supplementary Data 2). AP3B1 (BioRAD)
was used as reference assay. ddPCR PCR reaction contained 1× ddPCR
Supermix for Probes, no dUPT (Bio-Rad), 1× FAM-labelled HBEGF-
PCSK9 custom assay (BioRAD), 1× AP3B1-HEX labelled human reference
assay (Bio-Rad), 1/40 HaeIII (Invitrogen) and 50 ng/μL genomic DNA.
20 µL PCR reaction was used to generate lipid droplets with an auto-
mated Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad). PCR ampliﬁcation was performed
using the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min, 40x (94 °C for 30 s,
ramp 2 °C/s; 63.2 °C for 1 min) followed by enzyme deactivation at
98 °C for 10 min. Readout was performed with QX 100 Droplet Reader
(Bio-Rad) and ddPCR Droplet Reader Oil (Bio-Rad). Data analysis was
conducted with QuantaSoft 1.7.4 Software from Bio-Rad.
Deep-targeted amplicon next-generation sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted three days after transfection with
QuickExtract (QE) (Lucigen). Cells were washed once with PBS and
50 µL QE was added per well of a 96-well plate. The reaction was
incubated for 10 min at 70 °C followed by 10 min at 98 °C. Plates were
spun down at maximum speed and stored at −20 °C. Deep-targeted
amplicon sequencing was performed from genomic DNA using the
NextSeq platform (Illumina). In brief, 1–3 µL genomic DNA from QE, or
50 ng of puriﬁed genomic DNA, was used to generate amplicons
ﬂanking the CRISPR edited sites with two sequential rounds of PCR. In
the ﬁrst round of PCR forward and reverse sequencing adaptors were
introduced
with
the
amplicon-speciﬁc
primers
(Supplementary
Data 2). Amplicons were generated with Phusion Flash High-Fidelity
PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in a 15 µL reaction con-
taining 250 nM of target-speciﬁc primers using the following cycling
conditions: 98 °C for 3 min, 30-35x (98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 5 s, 72 °C
for 5 s). For off-target analysis and HiBiT integration Q5 Hot Start High-
Fidelity 2x Master Mix (New England Biolabs) was used in 15 µL reac-
tions with 500 nM of target-speciﬁc primers and the following cycling
conditions for off-target analysis: 98 °C for 3 min, 30x (98 °C for 10 s,
65 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s), ﬁnal extension at 72 °C, 2 min and for
HiBiT integration 98 °C for 30 s, 25x (98 °C for 10 s, 67 °C for 50 s, 72 °C
for 120 s). PCR products were bead-puriﬁed using HighPrep PCR Clean-
up System (Magbio Genomics) or ProNex Size-Selective Chemistry
(Promega) and analysed on a fragment analyser (Agilent) to determine
size and concentration. 0.5 ng of PCR1 product was subjected to
another round of PCR to add unique Illumina indexes (Nextera XT
Index Kit, Illumina) with KAPA HiﬁHotstart Ready Mix (Roche) in a
25 µL reaction including 500 nM indexing primers. Thermocycling
conditions were: 72 °C for 3 min, 98 °C for 30 s, 10x (98 °C for 10 s,
63 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min), 72 °C for 5 min. For HiBiT integration
analysis, indexing PCR was performed with Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master
Mix applying the following cycling conditions: 98 °C for 30 s, 10x
(98 °C for 10 s, 65 °C for 75 s, 72 °C for 120 s). Indexing PCR products
were bead puriﬁed. Purity and average length were analysed with
fragment analysis (Agilent), and concentration was quantiﬁed with a
QuBit 4 Fluorometer (QuBit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Life Technologies,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) or by qPCR (ProNex NGS Library Quant Kit,
Promega). DNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 or
Illumina MiSeq platforms.
Long-read sequencing for large deletion assessment
HEK293T cells were transfected with different combinations of
SpCas9, HBEGF-targeting sgRNA and HDR-plasmid repair template or
ssDNA as described above. Three days after transfection the cells were
subcultured in a ratio of 1:3. Genomic DNA was isolated one day later
with Gentra Puregene Cell Kit (Qiagen). Amplicons for long-range
sequencing were generated with Q5 High-Fidelity polymerase in 100 µL
reactions (New England Biolabs) including 500 nM primers and up to
1000 ng genomic DNA using the following PCR protocol: 98 °C for
30 s, 30x (98 °C for 10 s, 70 °C for 10 s, 72 °C 6 min) and ﬁnal extension
at 72 °C for 6 min. Target site speciﬁc primers contained barcoded
adaptors for sample multiplexing (Supplementary Data 2). PCR pro-
ducts were bead-puriﬁed using HighPrep PCR Clean-up System (Mag-
bio Genomics) and loaded on a fragment analyser (Agilent) to
determine size and concentration. 110 ng of each sample was pooled,
and long-read sequencing was performed by GeneWiz/Azenta using
PacBio SequeI I SMRT sequencing.
Bioinformatic analysis
Demultiplexing of Amp-Seq data was performed with bcl2fastq soft-
ware. The fastq ﬁles were analysed with CRISPResso2 version 2.1.143
using a quantiﬁcation window of 8. A detailed list of parameters, such
as reference sequences, can be found in Supplementary Data 4. Variant
tables from CRISPResso2 analysis were exported into Microsoft Excel
ﬁles using a Python and R script available in the supplementary
information. Variant tables were investigated with RIMA34 v2, a
Microsoft Excel for Microsoft 365 based tool, which uses visual basic
programming for applications (VBA) code to analyse and visualise
InDel proﬁles from NGS data. CRISPResso2 and RIMA v2 data analyses
comparison is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3a.
Long-range sequencing reads were demultiplexed and subreads
were converted into circular consensus sequences (CSS) using PacBio
ccs version 6.4.0. Afterwards, reads were aligned to the reference
sequence (Supplementary Data 4) using pbmm2 version 1.9.0 and
minimap2 version 2.15 with non-default options –preset CCS –sort87.
Genomic coverage was calculated applying bedtools version 2.20.0
genomecov for raw coverage and deeptools version 3.5.1 bamCover-
age for CPM-normalised coverage with non-default options–binSize
1–normalizeUsing CPM88,89. Coverage summary statistics were calcu-
lated with samtools version 1.15.1 coverage. Visualisation of coverage
was performed with JBrowse 2 version 1.7.690. Deletion proportion was
calculated as previously described31, i.e. (Ct−Cm/Ct), where Ct is the
number of unique reads that aligned within the amplicon and Cm is the
mean per-base read coverage of the amplicon region. Deletion index31
is the difference in deletion proportion between treated and control
groups, as deﬁned previously.
Statistics and reproducibility
All sequencing experiments were performed with cells separated into
three stocks, each individually transfected with the same transfection
mix, recovered, and analysed (technical replicate); or cells from sepa-
rately cultured stocks were individually transfected with different
transfection mix, recovered and analysed (biological replicate). Gra-
phical visualisation and statistical analysis were performed with
GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software, Inc) or JMP 16.1.0 (SAS
Institute Inc.). Applied statistical tests, samples sizes and p-values are

indicated in the ﬁgure legends. No statistical method was used to
predetermine sample size. Few data were excluded from the analyses
due to low transfection efﬁciency, as indicate in the reporting sum-
mary. The experiments were not randomised. The Investigators were
not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.
