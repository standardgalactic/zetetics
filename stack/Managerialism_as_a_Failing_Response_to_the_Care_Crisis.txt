Chapter 6. Managerialism as a Failing Response to the Care Crisis 
 
Hanna-Kaisa Hoppania, Antero Olakivi, Minna Zechner, Lena Näre 
Introduction 
For several decades now, elderly care services have been characterised by recurring crises in 
Finland. In 2006, a political scandal erupted when allegations became public of insufficient staff 
ratios in Koukkuniemi, the largest unit of institutional care for older adults in the Nordic countries 
at the time (Yle, 2006). In 2019, a scandal broke when the National Supervisory Authority for 
Welfare and Health (Valvira) ordered the closure of several care homes owned by private care 
companies due to severe neglect in the quality of care, and announced that they were investigating 
several complaints regarding deficiencies in elderly care (Valvira, 2019). Valvira’s lawyer 
described the situation in the first care home as an ‘acute crisis’, which is why it was closed down 
immediately (Tiessalo, 2019). The situation was described as a ‘care crisis’ by the media, expert 
commentators and opposition politicians as well as the Regional State Administrative Agencies 
(AVI, 2020).  

Care crisis is understood here as referring to a situation in elderly care that has reached a critical 
phase in relation to the quality of care, also involving public concerns over the quality and 
conditions of care work. While a crisis is commonly understood as a temporary disruption, for 
many people in the world, such as older adults in poor health, a crisis can become a lasting, 
endemic condition. Nevertheless, when a crisis has been identified by central actors in the field, 
action needs to be taken. 
In Finland, a common line of action is routinely suggested as a solution to the crisis of elderly care: 
improvements in the management of care. When developments and outcomes in elderly care turn 
into a media frenzy and draw public attention to deficiencies and problems of all kinds from 
individual neglect and abuse to systematic understaffing, poor working conditions and widespread 
inadequate and inhumane treatment, at some point, the quality of management is identified as a key 
factor causing the strife, and hence better management is proposed as a solution to the crisis (eg 
Räsänen, 2011; Hoppania, 2015; Hoppania et al, 2017). However, very little public debate has 
emerged about what (good-quality) care management actually entails. How, precisely, can 
management solve the acute problems in the quality of care and care work? Why do the crises of 
care persist, after years of intensive efforts to resolve them by improvements in management? This 
chapter approaches these questions by bringing the recent research on management trends in elderly 
care into dialogue with theories of the logic and rationality of care. 
The chapter begins by discussing management trends in the care sector since the 1980s to 1990s. 
While many of these trends are global, the discussion focuses on the Nordic countries and Finland 
in particular, with an empirical focus on home care and institutional elderly care. Firstly, a brief 
discussion is provided of the historical context in which management has emerged as a key target of 
political intervention. The political arguments are highlighted via which managerialism, as a belief 

and value system that stems from the world of business and production rather than reproduction, has 
emerged as the driving ideology in the reform of elderly care in Finland and beyond. 
Secondly, the chapter explores two prevailing trends of management as they have emerged in 
elderly care in Finland. Drawing on Hanne Marlene Dahl (2009), the discussion distinguishes 
between the predominantly rationalistic logic of details as a systemic logic that shapes the structures 
of care provision, and the more normative logic of self-governance as an affectively appealing 
discourse that offers emotionally engaging subjectivities and (often false) optimism to floor-level 
care management in various organisations. These trends have been the object of care research to an 
extent, notably in the work of Dahl (2009, 2012; also, Hoppania et al, 2017; Olakivi, 2018; 
Hirvonen et al, 2020), and in a number of empirical case studies discussed in this chapter. The 
contribution to the existing literature is to examine these two sides of managerialism explicitly in 
light of the logic of care (Mol, 2008). 
The logic of care focuses on the needs of the individual and on care relationships. Since care needs 
are situational and temporal, they are seldom similar even for individuals of the same age and with 
the same illness. Instead, care needs vary even for the same person at different times. The 
production of care differs from, say, the production of cars and toothbrushes. This creates evident 
complications in the context of increasingly marketised care, including in Finland where private 
companies have dramatically increased their share of care provision during the past three decades 
(Karsio and Anttonen, 2013; Kröger, 2019). The marketisation of care, together with the increasing 
influence of business consultants in public service provision (Hirvonen et al, 2020), has also shaped 
publicly owned care organisations by introducing management styles that are imitating industry and 
business. These managerial styles have influenced the work of women in particular, who comprise a 
great majority of care workers all over the world. Men, in turn, are over-represented in the higher 
echelons of managerial hierarchies, also in the care field (Adams, 2010; Hussein et al, 2016). 

After discussing the different trends of management in light of the logic of care, the chapter returns 
to the socio-political context of the care crisis and the pitfalls of managerialism that have been 
exposed. Neither of these management styles sufficiently respect the logic of care, and at worst they 
contribute to the production of new crises. Moreover, it appears that the political focus on 
management obscures the root cause of the care crisis: the under-resourcing and undervaluing of 
gendered and embodied professional care work. 
Quality and efficiency through management? 
According to Kröger (2019), a demographic panic has been driving Finnish care policies, and 
governments have put a great deal of effort into avoiding their constitutional responsibility to serve 
the care needs of older adults. The avoidance of this responsibility has predominantly been implicit, 
with little open political discussion about the responsibilities of care, before the supervising bodies 
closed care homes and media coverage became widespread in 2019 (Hoppania, 2015). Incremental 
changes, such as more stringent needs testing and rises in client fees have led to complicated service 
systems and difficulties in accessing services. The politics of avoidance have created a situation in 
which family members need to shoulder heavier responsibilities than before, and the numbers of 
reports and complaints about inadequate care have increased dramatically, especially since 2019 
(AVI, 2020). Another crisis is located within care work, characterised by staff shortages and 
employees’ psychophysical overload (Kröger et al, 2018). 
Public debate and policy routinely offer better management as a solution to the crises (for example, 
STM, 2017). The alluring idea is that good management limits the need for economic investments 
in public care provision (Hoppania, 2015). This argument was strong even in the 1980s and 1990s 
during the first wave of New Public Management (NPM) that made the management of service 
provision a key target of political intervention (Henriksson and Wrede, 2008; Hoppania et al, 2016). 

In practice, NPM entailed management styles and tools from the private sector and businesses being 
implemented in the public sector, including in the provision of elderly care (Trydegård, 2012). 
NPM has been an international project, where ideas have travelled across countries and sectors. As 
a result, care work management in Finland and beyond has borrowed management styles, for 
example, from Japanese car factories (Lean Management), the US navy (Total Quality 
Management) and big business (Balanced Scorecards) with diverse results (Trydegård, 2012; 
Hirvonen et al, 2020).  
NPM has been infused with high hopes, but also criticised (Diefenbach, 2009). According to critics, 
the constant focus on the development of management has diverted attention away from other 
targets of development, such as inadequate staff ratios and the fact that people with intensive care 
needs are increasingly forced to live at home. Indeed, the question about sufficient resources has 
typically been sidelined in elderly care policy reforms, even if it has somewhat paradoxically been 
the driving force behind those reforms (Hoppania, 2015). This might be changing now in Finland, at 
least to some extent, as in 2020 the parliament committed to raising staff ratios in care homes – 
albeit only gradually and excluding home care services. Nevertheless, research suggests that 
currently the Finnish care system is in ‘a situation where, as a result of both individual and 
structural issues, [older] people in need of care do not receive sufficient assistance from informal or 
formal sources, and thus have care needs that remain uncovered’ (Kröger et al, 2019, p 3). In 
comparison to the level of funding for elderly care services in other Nordic countries, Finland is 
over one billion euros short annually (Seppälä, 2019). When public officials responsible for elderly 
care in the municipalities were asked about the sufficiency of home care, nearly one in two (46 per 
cent) replied that there are not enough home care services (THL, 2018). Clearly the enduring 
political focus on the development of care management has not solved these problems in Finland.   

The diversifying toolbox for managing care work 
Managerialism refers to a broad ideology of industrialised societies according to which problems in 
almost any area of society can be effectively resolved via managerial interventions (Räsänen and 
Trux, 2012, p 45; Klikauer, 2015). Managerialism can be seen as an ideology whereby the world 
gets better when it is put into the hands of specialised managers (Räsänen and Trux, 2012, p 42). 
The aim is to control people and issues and ignore what cannot be controlled. From a managerialist 
perspective, moreover, management is a specific job, a profession requiring specific training and 
skills (Grey, 1999). Managerial skills are specific, but they allegedly apply to any field of work. As 
Thomas Klikauer (2015, p 1107) writes: ‘Managerialism’s perilous central doctrine is that 
differences between a university and a car company are less important than their similarities and 
that the performance of all organisations can be optimised by the application of generic 
management skills and knowledge’. Resisting managerial interventions, and interventions by 
business consultants promoting the latest trends of managerialism, may be particularly difficult for 
female-dominated service occupations, including elderly care work, compared to male-dominated 
fields, such as medicine (Hirvonen et al, 2020).  
In Finland, care work managers (including leaders, supervisors and middle managers) are still 
expected to have specific training for care work and not only for management. However, 
management has become a new and independent field of expertise and a target for development and 
improvement in care work. Hence, while managers aim to manage care work, the work of managers 
is a target of management as well. New management styles, models, ideals and structures are 
developed continuously – and care work managers are expected to develop themselves accordingly. 
The turn to managerialism is a relatively recent one in care work in Finland. During the heyday of 
Nordic welfare state politics (1970–90), Finnish care politics placed a relatively strong emphasis on 

professional – instead of managerial – ideals and ethics of care provision (Henriksson et al, 2006). 
According to the professional ideals, care workers and their supervisors should have a relatively 
highly specialised and formal education in care work and their activities should primarily follow 
professional ethics of care (Paasivaara, 2002). These ideals have by no means lost their power in 
Finland: legislatively, care workers and their supervisors are still required to have formal education 
in care (Act on Qualification Requirements for Social Welfare Professionals, 272/2005). In 
comparison to other Nordic countries, Finnish care workers have the highest educational levels 
(Kröger et al, 2009). Since the early 1990s, however, political debates in Finland have become 
increasingly critical of professionalism in care (Henriksson and Wrede, 2008). Critical arguments 
have depicted professional care systems as old-fashioned, self-serving, economically inefficient, 
inflexible and not transparent enough (Henriksson and Wrede, 2008). To solve these problems, 
critics routinely call for better management. The increasing marketisation of care, and the respective 
diversification of public and private care providers, has only increased the calls for transparency 
and managerial control (eg Sitra, 2018). 
Political and public calls for transparency, flexibility, efficiency and quality can be difficult to 
object to (Dahl, 2012). Yet care workers and academic commentators have criticised managerial 
transformations, especially transformations that imitate a specific style of management: the 
industrial and Taylorist model of standardised work processes, hierarchical planning, and 
formalised surveillance and control systems of care workers, originally developed for factory work 
management (Dahl, 2009; Diefenbach, 2009). 
Contemporary working life idealises innovations, flexibility and self-governing employees – in 
contrast to Taylorist standardisation. While few nowadays openly advocate Taylorism in elderly 
care management, a number of Taylorist management tools have been implemented in care work 
since the 1990s. These include the obligation of care workers to constantly document and report on 

their work – an obligation that has been resisted by care workers since the 1990s (Paasivaara, 2002). 
Another Taylorist tool is the creation of quasi-markets within public care production, including the 
idea according to which care provision can be disintegrated into standardised, measurable and 
statistically comparable products and routines that care workers – especially in home care – perform 
by following pre-planned timetables and to-do lists (Heikkilä et al, 2014). These practices draw on 
an industrial management ideology that Dahl (2009) calls the logic of details. 
The logic of details also implies new divisions of labour in care work. Professionals in leadership 
roles are increasingly expected to act as specialised managers in charge of the detailed control of 
their staff members’ performance – rather than as experienced seniors who offer guidance to their 
junior colleagues (Bolton, 2005; King, 2012). This division of labour mitigates the importance of 
professional care work skills, education and specialisation both among managers and frontline 
workers. Instead of skilled professionals, the logic of details requires a flexible, compliant and 
controllable workforce willing to work according to the instructions and timetables planned by 
higher-level managers (Henriksson et al, 2006). To increase flexibility, a shorter educational path to 
the most routinised jobs in elderly care work has been established under the title of care assistant in 
Finland (Sinervo et al, 2013). This division of labour enables high turnover rates in care: if care 
workers mainly follow timetables and plans imposed on them by others, and require less work 
expertise and experience, they become increasingly replaceable. Often employers find such 
replaceable care workers among migrants and racialised minorities, especially in the metropolitan 
region of Helsinki (Näre, 2013; Olakivi, 2019). In Helsinki, 24 per cent of care assistants were 
foreign-born in 2016 (Statistics Finland, 2019). The proportion of foreign-born care assistants has 
more than tripled from 2004 (7 per cent), while the proportion of foreign-born care managers has 
remained close to zero (Statistics Finland, 2019).  

The Taylorist logic of details is not the only trend of Western managerialism in contemporary 
societies (Miller and Rose, 2008). Taylorist management has also become a common target of 
critique in care work (Gilbert, 2005; King, 2012). Managerialism has had to constantly renew itself 
and seek new legitimacy. Compared to the Taylorist principles of standardisation, hierarchy and 
external control, prevailing managerial trends tend to highlight almost opposite values, such as 
innovation, flexibility and employees’ internal control (Boltanski and Chiapello, 2005). In recent 
decades, such managerial ideals and arguments have, to a degree, travelled from business and 
industrial management to public service provision (O’Reilly and Reed, 2010). In line with Dahl 
(2009), this chapter argues that these managerial trends draw on the logic of self-governance. 
The logic of self-governance expects care workers to be responsible, autonomous, proactive, self-
steering and reflexive agents who constantly develop themselves, solve problems in their 
organisational environments and get things done – regardless of burdensome and precarious 
working conditions (Moffatt et al, 2014; Olakivi, 2017). The logic of self-governance expects care 
work managers, in turn, to activate and empower the above qualities in their subordinates. Instead 
of hierarchical controllers of the Taylorist model, care work managers are expected to act as 
inspiring leaders (O’Reilly and Reed, 2010), facilitators (du Gay et al, 1996), motivational coaches 
(Oldenhof et al, 2016), or ‘enterprising co-ordinators of care’ (Bolton, 2005, p 8), who influence 
their subordinates via subtle human resource management techniques (such as performance 
appraisal interviews and the articulation of ‘organizational values’). 
Theoretically, the logic of self-governance sits well with the traditional, professional ideals of 
Finnish welfare state politics. While there is a clear conflict between professional ideals and the 
Taylorist logic of details, the logic of self-governance, to a degree, aligns with the professional 
ideals of internal devotion, responsibility and constant development (O’Reilly and Reed, 2010; 
Olakivi and Niska, 2017; see also Baagøe Nielsen in this volume). The logic of self-governance 

can, however, also impose novel expectations on care workers and their managers: instead of 
highlighting formal and specialised education, professional traditions and collective responsibility, 
the logic of self-governance highlights generic creativity, learning by doing, and the constant 
comparison of individual workers with respect to their personal performance and productivity 
(Moffatt et al, 2014; Olakivi, 2017). 
Both lines of care work management, the logic of details and the logic of self-governance, are 
associated with the neoliberal politics of public welfare provision (Dahl, 2009). Whereas the logic 
of details highlights hierarchies and external standardisation, the logic of self-governance highlights 
another aspect of the neoliberal project (Miller and Rose, 2008; Baines et al, 2012): individual 
responsibility and constant self-development. In Finnish private and public sectors, publicly funded 
development projects according to the logic of self-governance have gained economic and 
ideological support since the 1990s (Arnkil, 2004; Hirvonen et al, 2020). 
However, the growing appeal of the logic of self-governance has not led most care organisations to 
abandon the logic of details. Rather, care organisations have adopted some of the ideals of self-
governance alongside the prevailing logic of details and the ideals of external control, disintegration 
and fragmentation. Many care organisations continue to implement information technologies and 
relatively faceless systems of reporting, recording and monitoring as management tools for 
streamlining processes by comparing separate units’ performance statistics (Ahosola and Lumme-
Sandt, 2019). Respectively, the same organisation can have a number of middle managers and 
lower-level supervisors (ward managers, head nurses, home care supervisors) who have little 
control over the top-level management systems and technologies (Björk et al, 2013). The main task 
of these supervisors and middle managers is to coach, inspire, motivate and activate their 
subordinates’ commitment, attitudes and values, and abilities to govern themselves and manage 
their jobs regardless of the Taylorist system (Antonsson, 2013). In this task, the discourse of self-

governance can offer middle managers affectively appealing resources, tools and subjectivities – 
but it can also create novel conflicts between care workers and their supervisors. 
The logic of care and the limits of detailed control  
Care is a particular kind of practice that follows the logic and rationality of care (Waerness, 1984; 
Mol, 2008). The logic of care means that – unlike on the factory floor, or in clearly defined service 
products such as haircuts – the needs that require a response can change rapidly and unexpectedly. 
Care involves a human relationship in which the response of the one receiving care plays a part 
(Fisher and Tronto, 1990; Anttonen and Zechner, 2011). Care, at least good care, is an ongoing 
process including the caregiver and care receiver rather than a defined service product (Mol, 2008; 
Zechner, 2008). 
The starting point in care work is always the need for care, not choice or want. In professional care 
work, the worker has to recognise and understand the kind of care that is required in a particular 
situation, and also to respect the autonomy of the person in need of care. Care is always about 
bodily, corporeal relationships. Individual caring situations are indirectly affected by a complex 
network and history of care relations. The personal (care) histories of the caregiver and the care 
receiver affect the situation and both parties’ experiences of it (Valokivi and Zechner, 2009; 
Hoppania et al, 2016).  
Paying attention to the bodily dimension of care illustrates the psychic and material limits of care 
management (Twigg et al, 2011). One can never be certain how a body will respond to care. 
Similarly, since care is relational work, the cognitive and emotional responses of both the person in 
need of care and the care worker vary (King, 2012). Care is always unpredictable to an extent, and 
therefore care work that follows the logic of care requires sensitivity and the ability to respond to 
changing situations. Hierarchical attempts to standardise and control care in line with the logic of 

details cause problems precisely due to this logic’s incompatibility with the logic of care (Hoppania 
and Vaittinen, 2015).  
A key source of conflict between the logic of details and the logic of care derives from time use. 
Implementing economic rationalisation in care work that ontologically resists standardisation is 
bound to make conceptions of time collide. The Taylorist logic of details gives care workers few 
opportunities to adjust their work rhythms to the changing situations (Astvik and Melin, 2012). For 
example, defining and standardising the amount of time that particular tasks for the recipients of 
care – such as eating, bathing, giving medication – should take, a common practice especially in 
home care in Finland, ignores the logic of care and the unpredictable nature of care situations. This 
can decrease both the quality of care and care workers’ wellbeing and satisfaction, as care workers’ 
abilities to follow the ethics of care dramatically decrease (Hirvonen and Husso, 2012). When 
managerially standardised time frames of work conflict with the actual time frames of care, a 
further danger is that the workers’ needs – that is, their needs to satisfy their employers but also to 
take care of their own wellbeing in precarious working conditions – start to compete with the needs 
of the recipients of care (Sipiläinen et al, 2011). In Finnish home care, 39 per cent of employees 
state that in order to get their work done, they need to contravene the principles or rules of the 
workplace (Vehko et al, 2017). 
According to a common argument, the logic of details pursues both economic efficiency and also 
quality of care. In this view, the quality of care improves if organisations have more control over 
the services they offer, by monitoring the performance and time use of care workers and the 
conditions of the recipients of care, and by collecting detailed information that higher-level 
managers and experts can quantify and statistically compare. These practices of rational-technical 
(Trevithick, 2014) quality control effectively ignore the everyday experience and professional 

knowledge of care workers, and also of middle managers and lower-level supervisors, in favour of 
higher-level management, numerical data and controlled methods. 
Numerical data can, of course, be useful when different units and care organisations are compared. 
Ideally, numerical data can uncover real problems and highlight successes in the quality of care. It 
is, however, far from self-evident that numerical data can measure all aspects of the quality of care 
and the actual, situationally changing needs of the care recipients (Kurunmaki et al, 2016). In 
Finland, the long-lasting interest in numerical quality control has not prevented recurring crises. At 
worst, the logic of details can create separate realities: one in the everyday life of care, practical 
needs and encounters, another in the systems of higher management in which the recipients of care 
as well as care workers are reduced to numbers that are managed from a distance (Hoppania et al, 
2016). 
Finally, continuous reporting and monitoring of care absorbs time from actual care work. According 
to a recent study from Finland (Kröger et al, 2018), the proportion of elderly care workers that 
considered that documentation consumed too much of their working time grew from 38 per cent in 
2005 to 70 per cent in 2015. Paradoxically, the tool that was meant to control the quality of care can 
duly become an impediment to good care (Banerjee, 2013). 
Organisations and service systems can tackle the above problems if they start to understand care as 
a human relationship and professional work that follows the ethics and logic of care. Consequently, 
the possibilities of management appear in a different light: what is central to management and 
policy making is to create conditions that enable work practices in line with the logic of care where 
individual and situational needs for care direct the organisation of care work. To enable this, care 
workers must have professional ethics and skills, including formal education, and practical abilities 
to form lasting relationships with their care recipients. Lasting relationships are a precondition for 

care workers to be able to recognise situational changes in the needs of the recipients of care. 
Growing turnover rates in elderly care work hamper this precondition. Finally, care workers must 
have practical resources – that is, time – to respond to the care recipients’ situational, changing and 
unpredictable needs.  
The logic of care and the limits of self-governance  
In the 2020s, the inadequacy of Taylorist management is relatively well acknowledged in Finland 
among care workers, academics and also among middle managers and lower-level supervisors in 
old age care. The ways in which middle managers and care work supervisors understand and talk 
about good care often follow the logic of care instead of the logic of details (Stenman et al, 2015). 
These understandings highlight the importance of respecting older persons’ individual needs and the 
need to invest time in the interaction between care workers and the recipients of care (Surakka et al, 
2014, p 225–6). How middle managers can progress from appreciating the logic of care discursively 
to supporting it in practice is, however, another question. 
In care work organisations, middle managers inhabit a difficult position. If the larger structural 
systems of care follow the Taylorist logic of details, and if middle managers lack the power to 
transform these structures, their options are limited. Yet managerial discourses expect middle 
managers to have an impact on care, and these discourses are normatively compelling (Olakivi, 
2018). Middle managers can find the subjectivities enabled by the logic of self-governance 
affectively appealing and empowering (Olakivi and Niska, 2017). Instead of transforming the 
external systems of care work organisation – that may seem impossible – managers can conceive of 
themselves as inspiring leaders and motivational coaches (O’Reilly and Reed, 2010; Oldenhof et al, 
2016; Hirvonen et al, 2020). They can activate their subordinates in becoming more responsible and 
independent actors able to proactively and dynamically respond to the care recipients’ unpredictable 

needs, regardless of the Taylorist structures. In an article by Olakivi and Niska (2017), a head nurse 
in a Finnish public sector care home described her work, as a ‘coach’, as follows: “What I find most 
difficult is maybe giving negative feedback, or if we have to give warnings. That’s not nice. I prefer 
being like a coach. So that I support and try to find a way so that the people will find the right way 
to act and find their own strengths, and that way support the functions as well.” 
The logic of self-governance seems to offer new optimism for care work managers. According to 
the optimist ideal, care work managers do not have to force their subordinates to act against the 
ethics of care. Instead, they can coach their subordinates to serve these ethics, but in alignment with 
more distant (and less visible) socio-political and economic objectives (Hirvonen et al, 2020) – that 
is, the political objective to avoid economic investments in the material conditions of care work. 
This management style aims to translate the objectives of employers and policy makers – better 
economic efficiency – into projects more easily acceptable to care workers – better quality of care 
and constant self-development (Moffatt et al, 2014). Simultaneously, the care worker is detached 
from their social relationships and brought under the managerial gaze as an individual target of 
intervention, with individual values, emotions and self-management abilities as targets of 
development. In the above article by Olakivi and Niska (2017), a home care supervisor discussed 
elderly care work, its burdens, and her own reactions to these burdens, as follows: ‘It’s a bit like 
you either like it [care work] or you don’t. So in my opinion, when people always talk about the 
rush, the rush is a bit self-imposed [by care workers], so that sometimes you even have to stop 
people and go, like, “Hey, would you just sit down and see that it’s not really that bad after all”.’ 
Solving problems in care work via the logic of self-governance is not easy. Firstly, care 
organisations’ support for employees’ self-governance often seems superficial. If the structures of 
care continue to be organised according to the Taylorist logic of details, and if care workers are not 
granted the actual autonomy to decide how they organise their daily work, or the education and 

experience to enable such decisions, expecting care workers to govern themselves may appear to be 
a tall order – or simply another form of exploitation (Olakivi, 2018). Care workers are mainly given 
the autonomy to decide how they navigate through the plans, timetables and obligations imposed on 
them by others (Boyd, 2002). Supporting self-governance turns into supporting care workers’ sense 
of responsibility, not their autonomy. If these techniques of coaching and activation are successful, 
care workers begin to accept individual responsibility for solving problems that their employers 
have caused, such as understaffing. The logic of self-governance does not change the logic of 
details, but merely downplays care workers’ abilities to object to it. Similarly, middle managers 
who draw attention to structural problems in their work environment are stigmatised as unable to 
manage, coach and activate their staff members.  
Even if care workers are granted real autonomy and the ability to decide how they organise their 
daily work, this does not self-evidently help. If the real problem is understaffing and a lack of 
resources, care workers’ increased autonomy does not resolve the problem. In a recent Finnish 
study, having autonomy in daily work did not decrease care workers’ intentions to leave their jobs 
(Olakivi et al, 2020). In the prevailing management discourse, however, self-governance tends to 
attract more attention than, for example, understaffing. Self-governance appears as something that 
middle managers and care workers can (and normatively should) cultivate, while understaffing 
appears to be out of their control.  
The logic of self-governance pressures both care workers and middle managers who become 
responsible for solving care problems by supporting their subordinates’ abilities to govern 
themselves. The logic of self-governance easily engenders interaction conflicts between care 
workers and their supervisors – between two female-dominated groups, neither of which are 
responsible for the prevailing care crises. If a supervisor is responsible for supporting her 
subordinates’ abilities to govern themselves but the subordinates feel that the real problem in care is 

not their self-governance but the lack of resources, conflicts are likely to emerge (Olakivi, 2018). In 
a recent survey from Finland, nearly half of care workers in home care felt that their supervisors did 
not take care workers’ concerns about their work overload seriously (Erkkilä, 2018). Middle 
managers also face contradictory expectations. They are expected to have experience in the care 
field, to work near the frontline of care work while the major part of their working time is 
consumed by administrative tasks, financial responsibilities and constant recruitment in order to fill 
the gaps in their staff caused by high turnover (Antonsson, 2013, pp 163−5). They are expected to 
be motivational and inspirational leaders for their subordinates while, in real life, they may have 
very little working time to support and supervise their staff (Björk et al, 2013, p 269; Kröger et al, 
2018). Instead of focusing on the (in)actions of business owners, policy makers and higher-level 
managers in the field of elderly care, the logic of self-governance thus focuses on care workers and 
their immediate supervisors, and engenders conflicts between them that burden the entire work 
community (Satka and Hämeenaho, 2015). 
The logic of care also applies to care workers and their supervisors, who are in many ways 
vulnerable and dependent on each other, on their bodies, on social relations in and out of the 
workplace. These vulnerabilities and dependencies make care workers and their supervisors prone 
to various unpredictable, situationally changing needs deriving from work but also beyond it, 
including from family obligations. The argument according to which care organisations can resolve 
all problems by supporting care workers’ self-governance overlooks such needs, vulnerabilities and 
dependencies (Hoppania et al, 2016). The logic of self-governance merely combines the 
unpredictability of care with a strong responsibilisation of care workers and their immediate 
supervisors. 

Conclusion 
While the deficits and crises in elderly care are starker in Finland than in other Nordic countries, the 
changes in management as a primary solution to these crises have also been more common than in 
neighbouring Sweden, for example (see Anttila et al, 2018). The broad ideology of managerialism 
cannot be reduced to any one type of management. Indeed, critiques of any one style of 
management often only call for a different, allegedly better style of management, thus reinforcing 
the ideology of managerialism. This chapter has focused on how two styles of managerial 
intervention, the more rationalistic logic of details and the predominantly normative logic of self-
governance, clash with the logic and rationality of care. The logic of details emphasises the division 
of care work into specific tasks, the measurement of outputs, and a hierarchical division of labour 
divided between planning and control on the one hand, and implementation on the other. The logic 
of self-governance focuses on motivating and activating workers’ abilities to control and develop 
themselves. Common to both management styles is the fact that they overlook care workers’ 
professional and experiential knowledge on care and, at least in the Finnish context, the material 
circumstances of care provision. 
The logic of details constructs a vision of care divided into predefined outputs that are carried out 
by the care worker with limited participation in the planning of care, and with limited abilities to 
respond to unpredictable care needs. Here, the care relationship and the logic of care are not the 
centre of attention. Rather, the focus is on documentable, measurable and manageable outputs of 
care. The management of care diverges from care relationships and becomes a field of 
specialisation for professionals who have expertise in planning and in keeping statistics on care 
(Kantanen et al, 2015). This development has repercussions for individuals receiving care. While 
care workers balance between their specified work tasks and clients’ wishes, clients have to content 
themselves with the norms laid down in a system-oriented manner (Andersson et al, 2004). 

Unlike the logic of details, which highlights external control, the logic of self-governance expects 
care workers to be internally motivated, entrepreneurial, and responsible for implementing good 
care, for constantly developing themselves, and for being efficient. If the employee fails, the logic 
of self-governance identifies problems in the worker’s values, commitment, responsibility or ability 
to practise self-governance – and calls for managerial interventions to solve such problems. The 
task of the manager is to guide the employee in the right direction. The manager has to reassure the 
care worker that anything is possible with the right attitude – even and especially if this belief 
conflicts with the employee’s experience. Here, as well as in the logic of details, the care worker’s 
knowledge of the work is subjugated to the manager’s knowledge. The normative logic of self-
governance demands a lot from the manager who, due to their own work overload, may have 
limited abilities to support their subordinates.   
The analysis of different management trends and their combinations from the logic of care 
perspective responds to the question of why care crises continue to occur even after decades of 
developing care management. Simply put, care is difficult to manage. While we do not intend to 
deny that elderly care would benefit from good management, our discussion has demonstrated that 
business-like management models are a poor fit for the realities of care work. Prevailing 
management styles that are in conflict with the logic and rationality of care can aggravate, not 
alleviate, care crises. Importantly, the political focus on management easily obscures the root causes 
of the crisis relating to the under-resourcing and undervaluing of gendered and embodied 
professional care work. As long as the political focus continues to downplay the fact that care is a 
labour-intensive sector and that good care can only be achieved with a sufficient number of valued 
and educated professional workers whose work is organised respecting the logic of care, crises will 
occur.
