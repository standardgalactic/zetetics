The quality of a professional portfolio career in the 
post-industrial era

ABSTRACT
Post-industrial society has witnessed trends according to which the 
labour market has become more flexible, services have expanded and 
immaterial work and horizontal work organisation has emerged, shap­
ing professions in respect to the employment and work they can offer. 
An outcome of these trends is a portfolio career, an employment 
pattern based on holding down multiple jobs, which increases the 
variation in the quality of career trajectories. Portfolio careers, how­
ever, are shaped at the intersection of industry and profession. This 
article studies the quality of a professional portfolio career by inves­
tigating the employment pattern and the task profile. Two case stu­
dies, one involving business consulting professionals and the other 
professionals in the creative industry, are investigated. The study is 
based on the analysis of interview data. For both professional groups, 
the quality of employment was impaired by the insecurity inherent in 
a portfolio career, but the quality of the professional profile of tasks 
was relatively adequate. For the consulting professionals studied, the 
quality of the task profile is due to the coherent but multidisciplinary 
continuum of tasks, which in turn is due to the market-based service 
industry. For the professionals in the creative industry, the profile 
consisted of professional tasks and tasks external to the profession, 
which is due to underemployment in the industry.

1. Introduction
Post-industrial society has witnessed trends according to which the economy is liberalised, the 
labour market has become more flexible, services as both an industry and a mode of labour 
have expanded and horizontal work organisations have emerged (Boje and Furåker 2003; Vallas 
2017). The liberalisation of a market is related to global insecurity, which promotes flexibility in 
labour policies, both in relation to public decision-making and the management of work 
organisations (Vallas 2017). For vertically organised production, industrial relations are based 
on long-term commitment, which in the post-industrial era is replaced by the transactional 
contracting of employees, thus resulting in the fragmentation of work (Rubery 2015). 
Employment is increasingly short-term employment or self-employment, with a limited number 
of permanent staff co-ordinating and managing the core functions of the work organisation 
(Neal and Morgan 2000). ´Neo-liberalism´ is often used to describe this liberalisation in the 
economy and in the labour market (Standing 2014, 32–37).

However, some patterns of atypical work, particularly self-employment, are not exclusively 
precarious but polarised into low-skilled and low-waged labour and professionals with high incomes 
(OECD 2018, 89–94). The trend towards self-employment is regarded as leading to insecurity, but is 
also claimed to provide a positive alternative to an organisational career, offering independence and 
freedom (Susskind and Susskind 2017, 124–126; Standing 2014).
The consequences of this increase in non-standard employment vary across nation states. In the 
Nordic countries, the consequences of the liberal wave have, for historical reasons, been moderate 
(Pollitt and Bouchaert 2004). A policy for promoting welfare society in order to tackle insecurity in 
employment has been applied in the Nordic countries, but the welfare state has been adjusted to 
global economic competition, with a policy of increasing flexibility in the labour market through 
softer implementation (Einhorn and Logue 2010).
International statistics institutions and Finland’s statistics institution confirm changes in 
employment patterns, particularly in terms of self-employment (Eurofound 2018) and part-time 
jobs (OECD 2018, 89). The growth in part-time self-employment is common in western Europe and 
has been remarkable in Finland and Denmark (OECD 2018, 89). The self-employed are strongly 
polarised into the categories of the low-skilled/low-waged and professionals with high incomes 
(OECD 2018, 89–94). Multiple job holding tends to be highest in the Nordic countries, varying from 
6 to 12%, whereas the average proportion is 4% in the European countries (Pouliakas 2017).
Non-standard employment also applies to the professional labour force in addition to the low- 
wage and low-skilled labour force (Susskind and Susskind 2017, 124–126). With the horizontal 
organisation of work, the outsourcing of professional labour is increasing, and instead of recruiting 
a permanent professional labour force, short-term employment and replacing professional staff 
with services are becoming more common (Noordegraaf 2011). As a consequence, professionals 
must derive their incomes from many sources, and thus, underemployment and the related 
insecurity may ensue. Instead of a full-time, permanent employment contract, professional work 
is organised as assignments or short-term employment contracts. This reorganisation also refers to 
the possibility of degrading the content of work through the unstable career pattern. However, 
holding down multiple jobs or a portfolio career is not a dominant trend and the transformation of 
a professional career tends to vary with the profession and the context of work (Brint 2001; Burns 
2019).
This article focuses on professionals with higher education qualifications in the post-professional 
era by investigating portfolio careers. For the professional labour force, a career is based on 
professional expertise, work and the related position in society and the labour market, and thus, 
their commitment to work is motivated by immaterial rewards in addition to the material rewards 
(Brint 2001; Burns 2019; Haapakorpi 2012). A portfolio career may decrease the opportunities for 
a satisfactory career as the employment pattern, carrying the risk of precarious employment, may 
exert pressure for individuals to accept professionally demeaning assignments and contracts 
(Bamberry and Campbell 2012). As the labour force with a tertiary-level education accounts for 
almost 30% of the European labour force (Eurofound 2018) and as knowledge work is embedded in 
the economy in many ways (Vallas 2017), studying the quality of careers reveals the changes in the 
mode of work and the terms of employment. Academic interest in this study originates in the 
transformation of professional careers and modes of work: how the careers are constructed in the 
context of the growing supply of professional labour force and, at the same time, increasing demand 
for knowledge workers, but increasingly on non-standard employment terms.
The article studies the quality of a professional career based on multiple job holding by investi­
gating two different professional groups, professionals in the creative industry and professionals in 
business consulting, both of these being exposed to market conditions and terms, but dissimilar in 
the nature of the profession. The study is based on an interview analysis.
The article proceeds as follows: First, the theories related to portfolio career are studied to 
understand the employment pattern and theories on professions, knowledge and education are 
discussed to frame their work. Second, the professional groupings are presented with a short 
442

literature review and some statistical information. Third, the data and methodology are studied. 
Fourth, the analysis is carried out in the form of two case studies. Fifth, the conclusions and 
discussion close the article.
2. Theoretical approach and research problem  
2.1 Portfolio career and terms of employment
The portfolio career implies a special employment pattern based on holding down multiple jobs and 
a combination of tasks with a risk of unemployment, underemployment and degrading work. This 
phenomenon has been the object of theories focusing on precariousness, implying degrading terms 
for employment and insecurity (Lorey 2015; Standing 2014, 11).
Precarious employment is spread over professional and qualified groupings of workers, in 
addition to the low-income and low-skilled labour force (Standing 2014; Lorey 2015). With the 
flexible organisation of work and labour, professional work is outsourced and acquired in the form 
of services from agencies or then professionals are employed on short-term contracts (Susskind 
and Susskind 2017, 128–135). The proportion of self-employed professionals is increasing; this is 
related to uncertainty about the future but also to freedom in work (Susskind and Susskind 2017, 
124–126).). For free professionals, tolerating the insecurity, paired with a desire for professional 
freedom, has been interpreted subjectively, developing oneself as a professional individual and 
controlling the uncertainty with individualised methods (Lorey 2015, 70–83, see also Susskind and 
Susskind 2017).
Susskind and Susskind (2017) argue for new professional configurations related to the liberal­
isation of the economy and labour. With the deregulation of the labour market, diversification of 
professional services, standardisation of professional work, multidisciplinarity and flexibility come 
into play (Susskind and Susskind 2017, 114–119). Decomposition of professional tasks reorganises 
the job descriptions (Susskind and Susskind 2017, 123–125) and technology tends to replace routine 
tasks, and tasks are reorganised within and between professions or new jobs (Susskind and Susskind 
2017, 124–126). Free consulting labour force is utilised for specific organisational purposes (Hurl 
2017) and the tasks are of a relatively short or limited duration (Barley and Kunda 2006). Qualified 
professional managerial work may be accomplished in middle management as a consulting service 
with less favourable terms of employment (see Standing 2014; 2018). This does not put consulting 
professionals in a marginalised position but generates a wide variety of elite management con­
sultants and knowledge workers in precarious positions (Kitay and Wright 2007).
The creative industry has been a particular subject of studies focusing on precarious employment, 
for artists and professionals in the cultural sector have a long history of unpaid work in their calling, 
in addition to non-standard employment. Andrew Ross summarises the contemporary studies on the 
creative industry as the dilemma of job satisfaction and poor work conditions as the sacrificial costs 
of doing creative autonomous work include long hours, self-exploitation and extreme flexibility (Ross 
2008, see also Lindström 2016). In particular, women in freelancer positions tend to have a higher 
tolerance of precarious employment terms, with the possibility of doing satisfactory work (Bridges 
2018).
2.2 The intersection of profession and industry
Given the employment trends, the fear of degrading professional work has emerged, for poor 
terms of employment may to lead to degrading careers and replacing institutionalised professional 
knowledge with more suitable informal and applied expertise (see Brint 2001; Susskind and 
Susskind 2018; Susskind and Susskind 2017). However, instead of totally degrading autonomy 
and discretion, diversified career trajectories are due to the intersection of professional and 
organisational reshaping (Burns 2019; Haapakorpi 2012) or industry-specific reshaping (Burns 
2019; Brint 2001). Regarding the body of knowledge, Brint claims that institutional knowledge 
JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND WORK
443

systems are the source for new types of knowledge work as a new type of knowledge emerges 
from the knowledge systems based on a continuum of verifiable systems mediated via universities 
(Brint 2001; see also Švarc 2016).
The changes in professions are incremental, but they may result in a profound transformation over 
time (Susskind and Susskind 2017). Instead of a solid profession, a multiplicity of professionalities (Evans 
2008) emerges related to multitasking and portfolio careers (Howkins 2001). The diversified career 
trajectories are also related to the stratification of professions (Susskind and Susskind 2017, 126).
This article focuses on the quality of portfolio careers in two case studies at the intersection 
of profession and industry. The definition of the quality of a professional portfolio career 
consists of two dimensions: the employment position in the labour market and the coherence 
and adequacy of the tasks. The employment position implies the following; first, how the 
consulting professionals and the professionals in the creative industry regard the non-standard 
employment pattern, and second, are their reasons for the portfolio career negative, driven 
solely by economic reasons or based on positive motives. The positive motives or reasons 
suggest emphasis on their dominance over the negative reasons. The coherence implies the 
compatibility and relatedness of the tasks, and the adequacy relates to the nature of the tasks 
being in line with the profession.
The intersection of profession and industry is the framework for studying the quality of 
portfolio careers. Industry-specific market and labour market shape the terms and conditions 
for employment, but professions contribute with their body of knowledge based on educa­
tion and a related way of working. For the business consulting profession, the industry is 
a market-based service industry (Susskind and Susskind 2017), and the creative industry is the 
context for applications of arts and culture with scarce resources and related underemploy­
ment, but at the same time, with the growth of activities (Fleischmann and Daniel 2015; 
Ashton 2015). The former represents a multidisciplinary mode of professional work in the 
discussions of the post-industrial era (Susskind and Susskind 2017). The latter mode repre­
sents a single-disciplinary mode of professional work but with a variety of tasks in respect to 
the particular discipline of art and culture (Fleischmann and Daniel 2015; Ashton 2015).
Both professions are institutionalised in higher education, although not in the same rigid 
way as in the case of legal and healthcare professionals. The professionals interviewed were 
already mid-term or mature professionals with a fairly long time having elapsed since their 
graduation, and thus, although their educational career was the basis for their work careers, it 
was less important than for young professionals. In Finland and the other Nordic countries, 
higher education policy is based on state-regulated, state-funded and fee-free education. 
Formal institutional uniformity, without clear hierarchies between universities is typical 
(Fägerlind and Strömqvist 2004). Thus, the professional qualities tend to be relatively uniform, 
t, which may serve to standardise professional work profiles.
The quality of the portfolio career is investigated ‘objectively’ through the criteria of sourcing 
from the perspectives of the research literature and investigated ‘subjectively’ through the views of 
the people with a portfolio career themselves as there is no common understanding and agreement 
about the quality of the career.
The research questions are:
●Quality of employment. First, how do the professionals regard the non-standard employment 
providing unstable income? Second, what are their reasons for pursuing a portfolio career?
●Quality of task profile. First, are their task profiles coherent, consisting of related tasks? Second, 
are the tasks adequate in respect to their profession?
Before presenting the data and methodology, the professions of arts and culture in the creative 
industry and the business consulting professionals in the consulting industry are briefly described.

3. Description of the professions
3.1 The consulting profession
In affluent Western countries, among them Finland, the growth of business consulting services has 
been significant (Boje and Furåker 2003; Statistics Finland 2018). Consulting services cover a variety 
of fields, including business consulting. The professionals interviewed for this study were specialised 
in coaching, counselling, training, evaluation and development project management, and their 
professional work fell into the category of management consulting services according to the 
Statistical Office of Finland, which is adjusted to the European guidelines for statistical offices 
(Statistics Finland 2018). These business management consulting activities employ about 22,000 
individuals in the industry and half of them are self-employed (Statistics Finland 2020). The sig­
nificance of the consulting profession does not lie in the statistical numbers but rather in the mode of 
professional work – in other words, in service-oriented knowledge work. In addition, consulting 
professional services are required to complete a specific task
which is tied to a relatively short or limited duration (Barley and Kunda 2006).
The consulting profession lacks clear and solid identification in respect to the body of knowledge 
due to the multidisciplinarity and the merging of different disciplines, applications, experience and 
problem solving (Susskind and Susskind 2017, 114–119; Brint 2001; Hurl 2017). According to Hurl 
(2017), the interaction of consulting professionals with intra- and inter-organisational knowledge 
production is the basis for their expertise. Some professional organisations and accrediting bodies 
have emerged, but for the business consulting professionals, market success as social acknowl­
edgement is relevant compared with the intermediate bodies typical for the more institutionalised 
professions (Maestripiere 2016).
3.2 Professions in the creative industry
The creative industry has been one of the key sources of employment and a contributor to 
economic growth in the post-industrial era (see Statistics Finland 2019), but economic develop­
ments and new technologies have cut the labour costs and made the industry effective, conse­
quently increasing flexible adjustment to the circumstances (Fleischmann and Daniel 2015). In 
2018, the proportion of the labour force in the creative industry was 3.8 per centof the total labour 
force in Europe and in Finland 5 per centof the total labour force. Higher education is fairly 
commonplace for professionals in the culture industry, with 59% holding a tertiary-level qualifica­
tion and in Finland, 60% of them have completed a higher education degree (Eurostat 2019). The 
professionals in the culture industry more often make their living as self-employed (33%) com­
pared with other industries (14%); in Finland, the corresponding proportions are 28% and 12% 
respectively (Eurostat 2019, 63–70). Earning income from many sources was common; 11% of them 
had multiple jobs, the comparable figure for the average for the labour force in Finland being six 
per cent (Statistics Finland 2019). However, the statistical methods for collecting and analysing 
data may underestimate the actual proportion as multiple job holding is rarely a permanent 
employment arrangement and more like a flexible way of organising one’s current projects and 
income (Haapakorpi 2021).
Employment outside the culture industry is often necessary in order to earn sufficient income 
(Throsby and Petetskaya 2017, 61), and in many studies, the hybridisation of work has been 
recognised (Lindström 2016; Throsby and Petetskaya 2017; Throsby and Zednik 2011; Rensujeff 
2015). Australian researchers claim that, measured in working hours, half of the hours are spent on 
creative work and a quarter are tasks related to arts and culture (Throsby and Petetskaya 2017, 61). In 
Finland, the corresponding proportions are 39% and 44% (Rensujeff 2015). However, the definition 
and categorisation of ‘pure’ professional work are not unambiguous. For example, the same task may 
be categorised as creative work or external work, depending on the purpose of the task and relation 
to other tasks (Rensujeff 2015).

4. Methodology and data
The interview data come from the ‘Multiple job holding - practices and institutional frame’ research 
project (2019–2021), which focused on multiple job holding among professionals with a higher 
education qualification. The interviews were carried out from March to September 2019. Each 
interview lasted approximately one hour. The face-to-face interviews were conducted at the 
researcher’s workplace or in a meeting room in a library. Some of the interviews were carried out 
via telephone. The interviewees were recruited for via personal networks and social media, and with 
the help of partner organisations of the research project. The interview themes were loose, which 
allowed the interviewees to add their own themes. The relevant characteristics of work and expected 
challenges or problems in multiple job holding were the basis of the interviews in the following way.
●How did the employment pattern take shape considering the multiplicity of assignments and 
contracts?
●Did the employment pattern have a negative impact on the interviewee’s economy and 
wellbeing, for example increased work load and stress?
●Did the interviewees regard a portfolio career as something positive and if so, why?
●How and why had the interviewee embarked on a portfolio career? Did they have no options 
for full-time employment or did they choose this way?
●Were the interviewees’ tasks meaningful and related to their profession?
The interview data were collected and recorded and transcribed into text files by a company 
providing research services.
The group of 45 interviewees varied regarding their profession and industry, and the reasons for 
multiple job holding, professional profile and position in the labour market diverged. The criterion 
for choosing the professional groupings for the study was their portfolio career, which was typical in 
both industries. On the basis of earlier studies, professionals in the creative industry also perform 
tasks external to their artistic work, unlike consulting professionals, and the aim was to ascertain how 
the quality of the tasks was constructed in respect to the variety of professional tasks. From among 
the interviewees with background in economics and in the behavioural and social sciences, 
a coherent group of 12 business consulting professionals emerged. The second group was 
a group of professionals with a degree and professional career in the arts and culture. This group 
consisted of 11 interviewees. Of these 23 interviews, eight were carried out by telephone.
The interview data were analysed using content analysis (Silverman 2006).The interview ques­
tions produced expected themes, such as insecurity regarding one’s income and future, but also 
unexpected themes, such as the quality of previous career as a motive for embarking on a portfolio 
career. The coding was based on the main themes of the research problem: first, the employment 
pattern and related subthemes and, second, the profile of the tasks in respect to the interviewees’ 
professions. As the research problem dealt with the assumed problems related to the employment 
pattern and the tasks, in the coding, the investigation of the problems was translated into the 
concept ‘quality’, which implies a good-bad dimension and characteristics of the work.
With this process, relations between the codes were constructed. Insecurity was inversely related 
to freedom, combining positive with negative. Insecurity was also related to extreme flexibility in the 
market, implying the coping method, the constant acceptance of and search for new assignments or 
contracts in the labour market.
The coding of the quality of the professional task profile was based on the codes emerging from 
the task descriptions and the relations of the tasks, educational/disciplinary core of work and the 
interviewees’ assessment of the meaningfulness of the tasks.
The consulting professionals and the professionals in the creative industry had similar experi­
ences, orientation and views about the two first pairs of themes, but differed regarding the past 
career and the expansion of tasks.

The background information on the two groups is presented in Table 1. Both groups were 
dominated by women; eight out of eleven of the professionals in the creative industry were female 
while among the consulting professionals, the number was ten out of twelve. The gender distribu­
tion must be born in mind when interpreting the results, although gender was not the topic of the 
research. For the creative industry, men tend to have prestigious creative tasks more often than 
women and women tend to more often take on tasks external to the creative core of the industry 
(Hesmondhalgh and Baker 2015). The literature on gender in the consulting industry was scarce, 
which may be related to the ambiguous nature of the industry and the profession. According to the 
literature on gender, a masculine model emphasising self-management caused gender inequality in 
the career trajectories (Kumra and Vinnicombe 2008).
Table 1
The business consulting professionals were in their late career, and the professionals in arts and 
culture were mid-career. The ages of the professionals in arts and culture ranged from 30 to 60, but 
all of them had at least a five-year-long career after graduation. Earlier studies on the creative 
industry indicate that inappropriate tasks tend to be more typical for young professionals (Throsby 
and Zednik 2011). The studies dealing with the business consulting profession show that, for mature 
professionals, the portfolio career may be related to age discrimination or a better alternative to 
a career in a large corporation (Platman 2004). Related signs were detected from the data, but to 
a minor extent (Haapakorpi 2021).
The analysis is presented in two individual case studies as they differ in respect to their profession 
and are thus not readily comparable. Similarities were the insecurity related to an atypical employ­
ment pattern, flexible adjustment to the terms of employment and appreciation for the freedom 
inherent in a portfolio career.
5. Results and interpretations
5.1 The business consulting profession
Quality of employment was impaired by the constant insecurity and fear of dropping out of the 
market and losing sources of earnings. The consulting professionals’ method for coping with the 
constant insecurity was extreme flexibility in the labour market, and, for example, they moved 
quickly from entrepreneurship to an employment contract when a suitable job became available. 
Insecurity and the related extreme flexibility in the labour market was also shared by the profes­
sionals in the creative industry.
It (the idea of starting one’s own business) was tempting, but, at the same time, it was frightening for you also 
have to make your living! If you don’t get enough assignments, you don’t get any unemployment benefits. (Man, 
coach, 60-65 years)

Despite the shared insecurity, the reasons and motives for a portfolio career revealed variation 
regarding the quality of employment. Those consulting professionals with mainly economic reasons 
for holding down multiple jobs regarded their employment pattern as poor when compared to full- 
time employment, for which they have been striving in vain.
Those consulting professionals with positive motives for pursuing a portfolio career had negative 
experiences in their previous work history, in other words, repeated redundancies in the employer 
organisation and related reorganisation of jobs and personnel in addition to decreasing opportu­
nities for professional tasks. Leaving these organisations and starting their own business was 
motivating and a fresh start to revise their professional expertise. They did not consider their position 
poor in the labour market despite the insecurity, for the portfolio career provided them with 
meaningful professional tasks and independence from organisational commitment.
The business consulting professionals provided services in the field of competence and organisa­
tional development. It was a broad area of varied tasks, including the main categories of training for 
adults, coaching and the management of development projects. The tasks were related, and thus 
formed a a continuum of the applications of business consulting professional expertise. The patterns 
of consulting were instructing people and organisations in relation to targets with consulting 
schemes. The management of a development project was a task for promoting defined targets, 
such as developing client services. The coaching was carried out as an external service, whereas the 
managers of development projects were usually employed on a short employment contract, with 
subsidiary tasks accomplished as self-employed people.
With regard to the definition of the intersection of profession and industry, consulting refers to 
a mode of work in a market-based business environment and profession to the special expertise 
originating from a multiplicity of disciplines, from economics, and behavioural or social sciences and 
a work history in HR management, adult education and counselling. The service mode of the 
profession emerges from this intersection. The multidisciplinarity was not occasional and free from 
the institutional professional patterns as the interviewees’ educational backgrounds had laid the 
groundwork for their previous and present careers.
Despite the variety of tasks, relatedness was discernible. In the following quote, one of the 
managers of development projects describes her way of combining tasks, which was typical. She 
applied her professional expertise to a variety of tasks carried out as an employee and as an 
entrepreneur, and the relatedness of the tasks relieved the workload of the portfolio career:
My assignments and employment contract originate from the same source, which is training, testing and 
counselling. I carry out the teaching at my workplace and utilize the related planning and experience I have 
gained from the training service provided by my enterprise. It is really motivating. (woman, 60–64 years old, 
development project manager)
The quality of employment did not match the quality of the task profile, which follows some of the 
theories on the precarious employment of professional labour force (Standing 2014, 2018; Lorey 
2015). Qualified professional work is carried out with differentiated terms, in stable and high-income 
but also in unstable positions (Standing 2014). In addition, referring to the negative work history of 
some of the consulting professionals, neoliberal employment terms are also recognised in standard 
employment with degradation of work.
Table 2. Consulting professions: main and subsidiary jobs, employment pattern and educational 
background at the time of the interview
Despite the relatively good quality of employment and task profile, there were some disconti­
nuities in the quality of professional autonomy. The purpose of the service was sometimes 
defined by the client in an improper way, which decreased the professional control over the 
service. A comment was made by a coach whose idea of coaching was ignored by his client 
organisation:

A. HAAPAKORPI

The personnel coaching sessions are nowadays rather short, although coaching should be a long process. They 
[he managers of the customer firms] say ‘go there for three or four sessions and try to do something’. That is an 
approach which does not recognise the perspective of development in work. They regard it rather as a method 
to pacify their personnel. (man, 60–64 years old, coach)
The redividing of the mandate for defining the purpose emerged from the service-based profes­
sional activity and the market-based position of the consulting profession, for the market-based 
professional service is not reinforced by an influential professional institution (Maestripiere 2016). 
Thus, even though the quality of task profile is high, the professionality is exposed to suffering from 
declined control over the purpose of their service.
Although sharing the control of the purpose of the service did not notably emerge from the data, 
it tackles the core of the profession. The control represents the mastery of the profession and the 
independent position.
5.2 Professionals in the creative industry
For the artists and professionals in the creative industry, standard full-time paid work has not been 
an institutionalised practice, for the history of the industry is based on culture business, elite arts and 
a position outside the labour market. Hence a portfolio career has been a standard pattern for 
making one’s living in the industry. (Ross 2008). The artists interviewed confirmed that there were 
only few full-time employment opportunities in their discipline. They also argued for their freedom 
as free professionals. However, some of them also discussed the limits of that freedom, as in the 
interviewee quote below.
There are no permanent employment contracts available in the (dance) business. But what is positive is that I can 
do just those things I want. However, the competition in the business is tough and it’s a good question if I can 
really choose, for I guess I have had to take everything I have been offered. (Woman, dancer, 30-40 years)
Of the producers with subsidiary tasks, two of them considered their portfolio career a poor employ­
ment pattern and preferred full-time employment in one employer. For producing in Finland, there 
are some options for full-time employment in some niches. The quality of employment is multi- 
dimensional for it implies, first, an obligatory portfolio career with some full-time employment 
alternatives and, second, a position with practically no options for standard employment but 
a strong motivation for freedom in creative work.
Despite the insecurity, the portfolio career trajectories were not casual; the continuum of the 
career was based on internal labour markets; in other words, the professionals got new assignments 
from the projects with which they had been associated in their careers. For example, there were no 
open calls for theatrical productions as the directors chose the staff for the teams.

Most researchers of precarious employment, for example Isabel Lorey (2015), consider this kind of 
portfolio career precarious despite the voluntary nature of atypical work, because it is accompanied 
by constant insecurity. However, this concept of precariousness is fairly pervasive as it includes all 
insecure jobs despite other qualities of the work. For a more detailed study on employment and 
work, the following approach is applied here when analysing the quality of employment. Insecurity is 
a constant state in a portfolio career, but the reasons and motives differ and the quality of employ­
ment varies. First, for those engaged in free artistic work and with scant options for full-time 
employment, the reason for the portfolio career is voluntary as regards their choice to work in the 
discipline. Second, for those with some options for full-time employment and a preference for 
standard employment instead of a portfolio career, the quality of employment suffers from the 
inevitable employment.
The other layer on the quality of a portfolio career is the quality of task profile, which is related to 
the significance of the artistic calling. The analysis of the coherence and adequateness of the tasks 
was inspired by Throsby and Zednik’s (2011) categorisation of the tasks in the field.
The tasks ranged from creative work to, first, creative work in another field of arts and 
culture, second, to expert tasks related to creative work, third, to producing and, fourth, to tasks 
external to creative work. Thus, the continuum based on creative work covered tasks to a limited 
extent, to the exclusion of external tasks . Despite the external tasks, the creative work was still the 
core of the profession from which the subsidiary tasks were sourced and where the portfolio career 
was based.
Some of the interviewees carried out projects in another field of arts or culture, but the 
opportunities for monetary rewards varied according to disciplinary boundaries. In the institutiona­
lised arts, the boundaries are closed to artists with no educational achievements and institutionalised 
positions in the field, which also applies to funding opportunities. In the new disciplines, for example, 
in media arts, the boundaries tend to be more flexible due to weak institutionalisation. In the 
following quote, a stage designer describes the vulnerability of her portfolio career and its strict 
terms. She had lived abroad due to her husband’s work and as a foreigner had no opportunities for 
theatrical productions:
I could not get assignments at the theatres in the country and for that time I did some work as a visual artist. 
However, I didn’t get any funding, awards, peer reviews or so on, because I am excluded for not having a proper 
CV. [] I lost my contacts to theatre production during the time abroad. (woman, 30–40 years old, theatre 
professional)
In the second category, the expertise in the field provided them with tasks in training and education, 
journalism and similar work (such as writing articles and assessments) and mounting exhibitions. 
These tasks, based on the expertise in the discipline deviated from artistic work in the sense that they 
required taking a distance from the individual’s own creative work, being based on an analytical 
perspective and mindset.
The third category, producing or applying arts in various consumption contexts, is a task between 
artistic expertise and project management. In addition to project management with budgeting, 
business planning, marketing and organising, expertise in the creative industry was needed to 
accomplish the task. The discipline was interrelated with production tasks. A producer with 
a variety of tasks describes his portfolio career as follows:
All the productions for radio and club happenings are based on the financial prerequisite. [] It is a risky business 
[in the not-so-popular artistic discipline]. I don’t necessarily get any money every year from the festivals. But 
I enjoy the collaborative work in the artistic community . I do also have solo jobs in radio work and teaching and 
working on the visualisation of my productions. (man, 30–40 years old, producer)
The fourth category comprised tasks external to arts and culture, but these differed as regards the 
motivation for the task. Two of the interviewees reported inevitable side jobs (selling and consulting) 
which they carried out for purely economic reasons. The voluntary tasks were motivated by 
economic consideration but also by an attempt to expand their field of activities, or example in 
450
A. HAAPAKORPI

the professional associations. Such tasks were meaningful and they emerged in connection with 
their creative activities and included chairing associations in the field. In the following quote, 
a dancer describes her fairly broad career trajectory.
Well, I am a dancer, but as a performing artist, I also participate in theatre productions. [] But it is very hard to get 
full-time employment in the dance profession, and there is a certain rationality to expanding one’s activities. () 
I also do some production tasks and write journal articles about dance . I am interested in politics and culture 
policy, and I have done some studies on them. At the moment, I am the chair of (X) association and deal with 
matters related to social policy. (woman, 30–40 years old, dancer)
Table 3 presents the variety of tasks. The individual interviewees usually had two tasks and four of 
them had more than three tasks at the same time.
Multiplicity of tasks was common for the professionals in the creative industry, but the quality 
depended on the perspectives applied. When applying a perspective emphasising only the core of 
the profession – creative work – the portfolio careers were not coherent but a collection of unrelated 
tasks. When applying the broader perspective, a portfolio career is considered coherent if the 
external tasks are due to economic, but also meaningful, motives for expanding one’s sphere of 
activities. Adequateness follows suit: the criterion of adequateness was fulfilled if the career was also 
considered to meaningfully bundle non-creative tasks.
6. Assessment of the study
The number of interviewees was limited, but the research literature in the field supported the 
interpretations. Despite the Finnish context, the findings can be generalised across nation states in 
Western countries as the literature in the field shows similarities regarding professional career 
trajectories in business consulting and in arts and culture.
The preponderance of females in the data has to be considered as follows. Male portfolio 
careers in the creative industry may be less divergent, but not to a large extent (concluded on the 
basis of the statistics regarding the tasks). For the consulting profession, it is more difficult to 
assess the impact of gender, which is due to the nature of the profession. However, leadership 
positions were lacking in the female-dominated data, which may imply a gendered model in the 
industry.
7. Conclusions and discussion
The quality of the portfolio career was related to the intersection of profession and industry. For both 
professional groups, the quality of employment was impaired by the insecurity inherent in a portfolio 
career, but regarding the reasons and motives for pursuing a portfolio career, the quality of employ­
ment varied. The quality was enhanced when positive motives, mostly the desire to do free 
professional work outweighed the negative aspects, insecurity. For the artists in the discipline with 
no opportunities for full-time employment, the choice of a portfolio career was due to engagement 
in artistic work. However, for those with a preference for full-time employment, the inevitable 
portfolio career impaired the quality of their employment.

For the business consulting professionals, the professional profile was based on a broad con­
tinuum of tasks. The broad range of the tasks and the flexibility for providing services determined the 
mode of the professional work. The relatedness of the tasks made the portfolio career coherent 
despite variation in the tasks. As an expanding profession, the tasks emerged from their broad range 
of qualifications and the market demand.
For the professions in the creative industry, the quality of the portfolio career was related to the 
underemployment in the industry and to creative work as the core of the profession. The tasks were 
based on the core of the creative work, related tasks and external tasks. Considering the quality of 
the portfolio career as coherent, the criteria were not always fulfilled with the external tasks 
necessary for earning one’s living. However, the tasks external to the core of the creative work 
became meaningful for those with meaningful activities in various social spheres and industries. 
Inappropriate jobs were rare despite the variety of the tasks.
For the professionals in the creative industry, the core of their work was based on a single 
discipline related to their educational background, and their task profile was individually shaped 
due to their personal interests and lives. For the consulting professionals, the multidisciplinary 
approach was adopted by professionals with different educational backgrounds. For them, the 
multidisciplinarity was collective, related to the demand in the market-based service industry.
The quality of the professional portfolio careers reflected continuities and emerging changes at 
the intersection of professions and industries. The case studies particularly represented the profes­
sions exposed to the flexible labour market. With the adopting of strategies regarding their profes­
sional career and earning their income, they expanded their careers and, with that process, they also 
shaped the pattern of the profession.
When starting the analysis, the criteria for the quality of the portfolio career were determined by 
following the idea of a profession with an institutionalised body of knowledge and related working 
methods and practices. The analysis caused a rethinking of the criteria. With these results, the critical 
question of ‘proper’ professionalism was erased as the case studies are quite far from the conception 
of a profession. That question, however, is not relevant if the aim is to understand the transformation 
of professions in the post-industrial society. Instead of this question, professionalities, as the out­
come of constant change but still being embedded in the professional origins, reveal the nature of 
the process of the profession.
For the tendencies in post-industrial society and advanced technologies, it is probable that new 
combinations of tasks will continue to increase as professional portfolio careers. This challenges higher 
education to provide intellectual and professional flexibility but does not remove the institutionalised 
knowledge systems and related professional training as the core of new professionalities.
