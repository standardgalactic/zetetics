Course Introduction 
Overview 
This course will introduce the students to the analysis products available within Autodesk® 
Algor® Simulation Professional and the proper usage of these tools.  The program 
capabilities include static stress with linear and nonlinear material models, mechanical event 
simulation, heat transfer, fluid flow, linear dynamics, natural frequency (modal) analysis with 
nonlinear materials, transient mass transfer, and electrostatics analyses.  The course will 
utilize hand-built models and those originating from CAD solid modeling programs.  The 
students will learn basic Finite Element Analysis (FEA) theory, the various meshing options, 
available load and constraint options, and how to create results presentations (including 
images, animations, and HTML reports).  The Finite Element Analysis in Action course 
curriculum is organized into three main sections, as follows. 
 
• 
This Course Introduction section contains necessary prerequisite information concerning 
software installation and configuration, how to obtain updates and technical support, and 
basics concerning the user interface.  The program emulates the view orientations and 
mouse actions of many popular CAD packages.  However, the procedures detailed within 
this course are all based on the default Algor Simulation settings for the views and mouse 
functions.  Please ensure that all student workstations are set up accordingly so that the 
software behavior will be consistent with the text. 
• 
The Presentation Slideshow is provided in two forms.  Within the second section of this 
Instructor Manual, the slides are presented in handout fashion, two per page.  In addition, a 
separate Microsoft® PowerPoint® presentation is included for classroom projection. 
• 
The Steps for Exercises section includes descriptions of all of the exercises included 
within the slideshow presentation along with keystroke-specific procedures for correctly 
completing the exercises. 
 
Software Installation, Services, and Support 
Installing and Running Autodesk® Algor® Simulation 
The simulation software is distributed on DVDs with the exception of software for the Linux 
platform, which is distributed on CDs.  In addition, the software may be downloaded from the 
Autodesk website.  When you place the software DVD into a DVD-ROM drive, a launch 
dialog having four options will appear.  If you want to set up the software on a client 
workstation, whether you will be using a license locked to a single computer or a network 
license, press the "Install Products" button.  If using a network license, you must already 
have the license server software installed to a computer on the network.  If you wish to create 
pre-configured deployments for installing the product on multiple client workstations, choose 
the "Create Deployments" command.  If you want to set up the computer as a license server 
to control the number of concurrent users through a network, or, if you wish to install optional 
reporting tools, press the "Install Tools and Utilities" command.  Finally, a fourth command 
on the launch screen, "Read the Documentation," leads to a screen from which you can 
access a ReadMe file and other installation and licensing guides.

FEA in Practice – Instructor Manual – Autodesk® Algor® Simulation Professional 2011      4/30/2010 
During the product installation process, you will need to specify your name, the name of your 
organization.  You will also need to enter the product serial number and the product key.  
Otherwise, you will be limited to a 30-day trial period.  To customize the installation location 
on your computer, the components to be installed, and/or to specify a network license server, 
you will have to press the "Configuration" button that appears on one of the screens during 
the installation process.  Then, follow the prompts, provide the required information, and click 
the "Configuration Complete" button to continue the installation process. 
 
Any time after the installation, you will be able to start the software by using the available 
shortcut found in the "Start" menu folder, "All Programs: Autodesk: Autodesk Algor 
Simulation."  The version number is included in the start menu folder name and shortcut.  
The name of the shortcut will depend upon which package has been purchased ("Simulation," 
"…Simulation MES," "…Simulation CFD," or "…Simulation Professional").  In the dialog 
that appears when the program is launched, you will be able to open an existing model or 
begin a new model.  The simulation software will be used to create, analyze, and review the 
results of an analysis within a single user interface, regardless of the analysis type.

Notes Concerning System Requirements: 
* 
We recommend usage of a 64-bit version of the operating system to run large models of any 
analysis type and for Mechanical Event Simulation, CFD, and Multiphysics analyses.  
While a 32-bit machine can be configured for larger system memory sizes, architectural 
issues of the operating system limit the benefit of the additional memory.  
 
** 
Linux may be used as a platform for running the solution phase of the analysis only.  It 
may be used for a distributed processing (or clustering) platform.  However, pre- and 
post-processing is done in the graphical user interface, which must be installed and run 
on a Microsoft Windows platform. 
 
*** 
These requirements are due to the use of multimedia in our product line and the 
availability of distance learning webcasts, software demos, and related media.  
 
Minimum system requirements and additional recommendations for Linux platforms may be 
found on the Autodesk website.  To navigate to the Autodesk Algor Simulation web page, 
access the HELP pull-down menu within the user interface, select the "Web Links" pull-out 
menu, and choose the "Autodesk Algor Simulation" link.

FEA in Practice – Instructor Manual – Autodesk® Algor® Simulation Professional 2011      4/30/2010 
Updates 
The software is updated with new functionality on a continual basis.  The following three 
types of releases are provided: 
 
1. A major version:  Indicated by the four-digit year of the software release (based upon 
the Autodesk fiscal year, not the calendar year) 
2. A "subscription" version:  Customers with a current maintenance subscription are 
eligible for additional releases that may be made available between major product version 
releases.  These are designated by the addition of the word "Subscription" after the major 
version number.  
3. A service pack:  Incorporates minor improvements to a major or subscription release and 
is indicated by the letters "SP" and a service pack number after the major or subscription 
version number. 
 
How to Determine the Software Version 
Access the HELP pull-down menu in the user interface and select the "About" command.  
This dialog will display the version that you are using.  In addition, the program title bar and 
the splash screen that appears at each program launch will indicate the major version number 
of the software.  However, as with the start menu group name and program shortcut, it will 
not indicate the subscription and service pack variants. 
 
How to Obtain an Update 
Update notifications are provided via the "Communication Center" within the user interface.  
The Communication Center icon is located at the right end of the program window title bar.  
The state of the Communication Center icon changes whenever new information is available.  
The Communication Center provides up-to-date product support information, software 
patches, subscription announcements, articles, and other product information through a 
connection to the Internet.  Users may specify how frequently the Live Update information 
will be polled—on-demand, daily, weekly, or monthly.  When a program update notification 
is received, the user will be given the option of downloading and installing it. 
 
Navigating the User Interface 
In this section, we will introduce you to the Autodesk Algor Simulation user interface.  This 
interface is the same for each of the available packages, including the foundational Algor 
Simulation product and the Algor Simulation CFD, MES, and Professional products.  The 
only difference will be with regard to which advanced features or capabilities are enabled. 
 
We will begin with an overview of the major components of the graphical user interface.  
Then, we will discuss the toolbars, keyboard, mouse, ViewCube, and additional view 
controls.  Please note that the behavior of the keyboard, mouse, and ViewCube – as discussed 
within this manual – are based on the default program settings for a clean installation of the 
product.  Many of the features to be discussed are customizable via tabs and settings within 
the "Options" dialog, reachable via the "Tools: Options" pull-down menu command. 
 
Figure 2 on the next page, along with the legend that follows it, introduces the major 
components of the user interface.  This manual is based on Autodesk Algor Simulation 
Professional 2011.  Users of other versions may encounter differences between their version 
and the interface described herein.

FEA in Practice – Instructor Manual – Autodesk® Algor® Simulation Professional 2011      4/30/2010 
Toolbars 
Autodesk Algor Simulation accesses program functions through pull-down menus, context 
menus, and toolbars.  The available toolbars and menus vary for each program environment 
(FEA Editor, Results, and Report).  By default, the toolbars are positioned at the top of the 
screen, just under the pull-down menus.  As is true for the menus, commands are logically 
grouped into a number of different toolbars.  For example, one toolbar includes predefined 
view orientations, another includes various selection tools, still another includes structured 
meshing tools, and so on.  These may be displayed, hidden, or repositioned as desired. 
 
Most of the toolbars and pull-down menus will not appear until an existing model is opened 
or a new model is created.  To see the toolbars of the FEA Editor at this time, start the 
program. Dismiss the "What's New" screen if it appears, select the "New" icon in the initial 
dialog ("Open" / "New"), and click the "New" button.  Navigate to a working folder, type in 
the name of your choice in the "File name:" field, and click the "Save" button. 
 
How to Display or Hide Specific Toolbars 
To display or hide toolbars or to adjust the icon size or style, access the TOOLS pull-down 
menu and select the "View Toolbars..." command.  To display another toolbar activate the 
checkbox for that toolbar.  Deactivate the checkbox for each toolbar that you prefer to hide.  
Additional checkboxes are provided for the toolbar size and style options.  Press the "Close" 
button to exit the "Toolbars" screen.   
 
How to Dock Toolbars 
Toolbars can be docked on the top, bottom, and/or sides of the display area.  To dock a 
toolbar, first click on the title bar and drag it toward one of the edges of the display area.  
Once you reach the edge, the shape will change to signify that you are at a location where the 
toolbar may be docked.  Release the mouse and the toolbar will dock at the location of the 
mouse.  That is, it will snap to the docked position and the title bar will disappear.  This is 
illustrated in the following images.

Using the Keyboard and Mouse 
The keyboard and mouse will both be used to operate within the user interface.  The keyboard 
will be used to enter the required data for loads, constraints, material properties, and so on.  It 
will also be used to modify the behavior of particular mouse operations.  That is, certain 
keyboard keys, when held down, will change the behavior of the mouse. 
 
The software supports a number of different mouse configurations.  This document assumes 
that the default template for a new installation is in effect.  However, user settings, or those 
retained from a prior Autodesk Algor Simulation installation, may cause the behavior to differ 
from that described herein.  To ensure that your mouse actions follow the descriptions in this 
book, access the "Tools: Options: Mouse Options" dialog and choose the "Algor 
Simulation" template. 
 
The left mouse button will be used to select items.  How items are selected will depend upon 
the selection mode chosen in the "Selection: Shape" pull-out menu or toolbar.  The type of 
objects that are selected (such as lines, vertices, surfaces, parts, edges, or elements) will 
depend upon the selection mode chosen in the "Selection: Select" pull-out menu or toolbar. 
 
Hold down the <Ctrl> key while left-clicking an object to toggle the selection state of the 
clicked object.  That is, unselected objects will be added to the selection set and previously 
selected items will be removed from the selection set.  Holding down the <Shift> key while 
left-clicking will only add clicked objects to the selection set (this will have no effect on 
already selected items).  Finally, holding both <Ctrl> and <Shift> while left-clicking will 
only remove clicked objects from the selection set (this will have no effect on items that are 
not already part of the current selection set).   
 
Pressing the right mouse button with the cursor hovering over items in the tree view will 
access a context menu with commands relevant to the item under the cursor.  When items are 
currently selected, either within the tree view or display area, the right-click context menu 
will display commands and options that are specifically relevant to the selected items.  For 
example, if a surface is selected, only surface-based commands will appear in the context 
menu.  You may right-click anywhere in the display area when items are selected to access 
the context menu.  However, to access the context menu within the tree view area, you must 
right-click with the cursor positioned on one of the selected headings. 
 
If a mouse has a wheel, rolling the wheel will zoom in or out on the model.  Holding down the 
middle mouse button or wheel and dragging the mouse will rotate the model.  Press the 
<Ctrl> key while holding the middle button and dragging the mouse to pan the model, 
moving it within the display area.  Press the <Shift> key while dragging the mouse with the 
middle button down to zoom in and out, making the model larger as the mouse is moved 
upward and smaller as it is moved downward.  You will likely find the use of the middle 
mouse button and wheel to be more convenient than choosing a command like "Rotate" or 
"Pan," clicking and dragging the mouse, and then pressing <Esc> to exit the command. 
 
Finally, the X, Y, or Z key on the keyboard may be held down while dragging the mouse with 
the middle button held down.  Doing so will rotate the model, as before, but constraining the 
rotation to be only about the corresponding X, Y, or Z global axis direction.  You may also 
use the left and right cursor keys on the keyboard while holding down X, Y, or Z to rotate 
about these axes in fixed increments (15 degrees by default).  The rotation increment is 
customizable via the "Tools: Options: Graphics: Miscellaneous" dialog.

Introduction to the ViewCube 
As is true for the mouse, the software also supports a number of different view configurations.  
This document assumes that the default view options template and view navigation settings 
for a new installation are in effect.  However, user settings, or settings retained from a prior 
Autodesk Algor Simulation installation, may cause the view orientations and behavior to 
differ from those described throughout this document.  To ensure that your view commands 
follow the descriptions in this book, access the "Tools: Options: Views Options" dialog and 
choose the "Algor Simulation" template. 
 
Next, access the "Graphics" tab of the same "Options" dialog, select "Navigation Tools" from 
the items listed on the left side of the dialog, and click on the "View Cube" button.  Click the 
"Restore Defaults" button followed by “OK” to exit the "ViewCube Properties" dialog. 
 
Finally, click the "Steering Wheel" button.  Click the "Restore Defaults" button followed by 
“OK” to exit the "SteeringWheels Properties" dialog.  Click “OK” to exit the "Options" dialog. 
 
The ViewCube will be located in the upper right corner of the display by default but may be 
relocated.  The appearance will change depending upon whether the view is aligned with a 
global plane and whether the cursor is near the cube or not.  The ViewCube, in its various 
appearances, is shown in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4:  ViewCube Appearance 
 
The six standard view names, as labeled on the cube faces, are the Top, Bottom, Front, Back, 
Left, and Right.  These may be selected by clicking near visible face names on the cube, as 
shown in Figure 4 (b) or by clicking the triangular arrows pointing towards the adjacent faces, as 
shown in Figure 4 (c), which shows the cursor pointing to the arrow for the Bottom view.   
 
In addition, there are clickable zones at each corner and along each edge of the ViewCube.  
Clicking on a corner will produce an isometric view in which that particular corner is 
positioned near the center and towards you.  Clicking an edge will produce an oblique view, 
rotated 45 degrees, half-way between the views represented by the two adjacent faces. 
 
When the cursor is near the ViewCube, a "Home" icon will appear above it and to the left, 
providing easy access to the home view.  This is an isometric view having the corner between 
the Front, Right, and Top Faces centrally positioned and towards you by default.  The home 
view may be redefined by right-clicking the Home icon and choosing the "Set Current View 
as Home" command while viewing the model positioned as desired. 
 
When one of the six standard views is active and the cursor is near the ViewCube, two curved 
arrows will appear above and to the right of the cube, as seen in Figure 4 (c).  These are used 
to rotate the model to one of the four possible variants of the particular standard view.  Each 
click of an arrow will rotate the model 90 degrees in the selected direction.

When the face being viewed is changed via the ViewCube, the model may move to the 
selected view in the manner that requires the least amount of motion.  For example, say we 
are first looking at the Right view, with the word "Right" positioned upright (that is in the 
normal reading position).  Now, if we click the downward arrow above the cube, the model 
will rotate 90 degrees to reveal the top face.  The Top view will be rotated 90 degrees 
clockwise from the upright orientation (that is, the word "Top" will read in the vertically 
downward direction).  Activating the "Keep scene upright" option will cause the Front, 
Back, Left, and Right views to automatically be oriented in the upright position (Top above, 
Bottom below) when changing to any of these views.  You may, however, rotate the view 
after initial selection, if desired.  Go to "Tools: Options: Graphics: Navigation Tools: 
View Cube" to locate the "Keep scene upright" setting.  It is activated by default. 
 
The point of this discussion is that whenever a new face is selected using the ViewCube, the 
resultant view rotation may differ, depending upon the prior position of the model.  If the resultant 
orientation is not what is desired, simply click one of the curved arrows to rotate the view. 
 
Additional View Controls 
Immediately below the ViewCube is a pallet of additional view controls.  This 
consists of seven tools, each of which may be individually enabled or disabled.  
All are on by default.  Figure 5 shows the view control pallet. 
 
From top to bottom, the seven tools are as follows: 
 
• 
SteeringWheels 
• 
Pan 
• 
Zoom 
• 
Orbit 
• 
Center 
• 
Previous View 
• 
Next View 
 
Each of these icons, except for the Previous and Next commands, function as a 
toggle—clicking it once to activate a command and again to deactivate it.  
Several of these tools, such as Pan, Previous, and Next are self-explanatory. 
 
The "Zoom" tool includes a fly-out menu allowing the choice of one of four different zooming 
modes—Zoom, Zoom (Fit All), Zoom (Selected), and Zoom (Window).  The first of these 
causes the model to become larger as the cursor is moved upward in the display area and smaller 
when it is moved downward.  The Fit (All) mode encloses the extents of the whole model.  After 
selecting objects in the display area, the Zoom (Selected) tool fits the selected items into the 
display area.  Finally, after selecting the Zoom (Window) tool, you can click and drag the mouse 
to draw a window defining the area you wish to expand to fill the display area. 
 
The "Orbit" tool has two variants, selectable via a fly-out menu—Orbit, and Orbit 
(Constrained).  The former allows the model to be rotated freely in any direction.  The 
Constrained option causes the model to rotate only about the global Z-axis, similar to pressing 
the Z key while dragging the mouse with the middle button depressed. 
 
The "Center" tool is used to center a point on the model within the display area.  Click with 
the mouse to specify the desired center point after selecting the Center command.  This point 
also becomes the display pivot point, about which the model pivots when being rotated.

The "SteeringWheels" tool is customizable and, in its default setting, produces the Full 
Navigation Wheel shown in Figure 6.  The full navigation wheel floats above the model view, 
following the cursor position.  It provides an additional access method for several functions 
found elsewhere on the view tools pallet as well as a few additional functions. 
 
 
Figure 6:  Full Navigation Wheel 
 
The "Rewind" button on the navigation wheel presents a timeline of thumbnails representing 
various views that have been used during the modeling session.  Simply release the mouse 
button with the cursor positioned at the thumbnail representing the view to which you wish to 
jump.  This is more convenient than pressing the previous or next view buttons multiple times. 
 
For additional information concerning these view controls, consult the User's Guide. 
 
 Legacy View Controls in Autodesk Algor Simulation 
Traditional view controls and options are also provided via the pull-down menus and toolbars 
at the top of the user interface window.  Options for displaying or hiding the mesh or model 
shading may be found here as well as eight pre-defined, standard view orientations.  The 
orientations will depend upon the currently active views options template (previously 
discussed in the "Introduction to the ViewCube" section of this introduction). 
 
There is also a "User-defined Views" dialog that may be used to save, modify, or restore 
custom views.  Additional capabilities include a local zoom feature and display toggles for the 
scale ruler, miniaxis, and perspective mode. 
 
The "Local Zoom" feature displays a small rectangle that represents the area to be 
magnified.  A larger rectangle shows an overlay of the magnified region.  You may click on 
and drag the local zoom window to position it anywhere on the model within the display area.  
The size of the local zoom area and magnified overlay and also the zoom level can be 
customized via the "Tools: Options: Graphics: Local Zoom" dialog. 
 
For additional information concerning the legacy view controls, consult the Help files.

Mechanical Event Simulation (MES)
MES overcomes many limitations of static stress 
analysis by accounting for…
• Geometric nonlinearity (large deformations that change 
the load and/or constraint positions and directions) 
• Acceleration/inertia
• Damping
• Motion-enabled contact or impact (that is, surface-to-
surface contact that changes over time due to motion or 
component deformation)
• Nonlinear material behavior (such as plastic deformation 
due to exceeding the material yield strength).
 
Slide 182:

Mechanical Event Simulation (MES)
(continued)
Other MES characteristics:
• Loads and results are time-dependent, providing 
many instantaneous results “snapshots” over a 
user-defined period of time.
• Load curves are used to define how the given 
loads vary over time.
• Multiple results time steps are provided for post-
processing.
• Results may be graphed versus time.  The integral 
and first or second derivative of the results may 
also be graphed.

MES – Shell Elements
• MES shell elements are similar to 
linear plate elements.  They are 
triangular or quadrilateral, are 
planar (or nearly planar), and have 
three or four corner nodes.
• There are several available 
formulations (consult the Help files 
for more information).
• Composites are a subset of shell 
elements in MES, rather than a 
separate element type.

MES – Kinematic Elements
• Kinematic elements can be either 2-D or 
3-D elements. 
• Kinematic elements do not experience strains 
and do not report stresses. Otherwise, these 
elements behave just like flexible brick 
elements.
• They have an advantage over conventional 
brick elements because of their small 
contribution to the size of the global stiffness 
matrix.  This results in faster run times.
 
Slide 186: 
© 2010 Autodesk, Inc.  All rights reserved.
MES – Contact Elements
• Contact elements can have 
different stiffness values in 
compression and tension. 
• These elements can also have a 
breaking stress at which point 
the stiffness will be zero.  
• These elements can be used to 
simulate cables.

MES – Coupling Elements
• Coupling elements aid in the 
simulation of parts that "couple" 
at a known length.
• This coupling is modeled by 
introducing a stiffness when it 
reaches this length. This 
stiffness is calculated using the 
modulus of elasticity, a coupling 
area, and the length of the 
element. 
 
Slide 188: 
© 2010 Autodesk, Inc.  All rights reserved.
MES – Dashpot Elements
• Dashpot elements can be used 
to apply local damping to a 
model. 
• You can specify a damping 
coefficient that will control how 
much these elements affect 
motion.

MES – Actuator Elements
• Actuator elements are line 
elements whose lengths can 
change over time. 
• They are used to simulate 
defined movement of a part 
(such as hydraulic cylinders or 
solenoids).
 
Slide 190: 
© 2010 Autodesk, Inc.  All rights reserved.
MES – Slider Elements 
• A slider element consists of two 
collinear lines connected at one 
node. 
• The node in the middle will be 
allowed to move along the line 
defined by the other two points, 
letting the node “slide” such as 
if it were in a guide or slot.

MES – Pulley Elements
• Pulley elements consist 
of three nodes: driver, 
pivot, and slack.
• As the driver node 
moves toward or away 
from the pivot, the slack 
node will move in the 
opposite direction by a 
set relationship.

MES – Pipe Elements
• Pipe elements allow you to 
model piping systems under 
internal pressure loads.  
• The pipe elements can be either 
straight sections or bends.

MES – Hydrodynamic Elements
• Hydrodynamic elements 
can be either 2-D or 3-D 
elements. 
• These elements allow for 
the simulation of the 
interaction of fluids with 
solids without considering 
the details of the flow.

MES – Surface-to-Surface Contact
• Specify two or more surfaces that may come 
into contact during the event duration.
• Can include static and dynamic friction effects.
• A “slide, no bounce” option is available to 
prevent objects from separating once they’ve 
come into contact.
• Consult the Help files for more information 
concerning the various surface contact options 
and parameters.

1.
Before meshing, set the default contact = “Free/No Contact” and define a surface 
contact pair between Part 1 and Part 2, which will prevent mesh matching 
between the parts (this is desirable for MES contact surfaces).
2.
Mesh the model at an absolute mesh size of 0.0625” (1/16th of an inch).
3.
Modify line attributes to consolidate the contact surfaces.  Use surface 100 for 
the 1st contact pair, 101 for the 2nd, and 102 for the 3rd – include chamfers.  For 
the drive wheel, surfaces 100 and 101 will each encompass about one-third of the 
perimeter of the wheel’s C-shaped cylindrical contact surface.
4.
From the “General Surface-to-Surface Contact” screen, redefine the first pair to 
be Part 1/Surface 100 to Part 2/Surface 100.  Create two more pair—Part 1/ 
Surface 101 to Part 2/Surface 101 and Part 1/Surface 102 to Part 2/Surface 102.  
Set the contact element “Updating” to “Automatic.”  Set the contact parameters 
for all three pair as follows…
• Contact problem type = “High Speed Contact (Impact)”
• Contact type = “Surface to Surface”
• User specified contact stiffness = 1000 lbf/in
• User specified contact tolerance = 0.0011” (eliminates the effects of 0.001” part clearances 
and prevents chatter, resulting in a quicker and more stable solution).

Create four universal joints, one at each end face of the four stub shafts, 
entering the specified vertex coordinates from the preceding diagram.  
6.
In the element definition screen for parts 1 and 2, set the analysis type to 
“Large Displacement.”  Set the material for the drive wheel to “Brass, Red” and 
for the driven wheel to “Plastic – Nylon Type 6/6.”  For all four joints…  Change 
the element type to “Pipe”  – In the element definition screen, set the OD to 
0.1” and the wall thickness  to 0.03”  – The material is to be custom defined, 
E=100e6; all other values remain at zero.
7.
Apply the nodal boundary conditions and loads specified on the preceding 
diagram to the center points of the four joints. For Joint 4’s lumped mass, 
specify a uniform mass of 0.00088 lbf·s2/in and a mass moment of inertia in the 
Z-direction of 0.00135 lbf·s2·in. These values simulate a steel disk 1/8” thick 
with a diameter of 3.5”.
Use load curve 1 for the prescribed displacement (rotation) and load
curve 2 for the nodal moment. Load curve 1 ramps linearly from 0 to 1 in 
1 second.  Load curve 2 is constant at 1.  Set a death time of 1 second in the 
active range data dialog for the prescribed displacement.

8.
In the analysis parameters screen, set the event duration to 1 second and 
the capture rate to 90.  This will produce a time step for every two degrees 
of drive wheel rotation.
9.
Under the equilibrium tab of the advanced analysis parameters, uncheck the 
“Automatic” box for the displacement tolerance and set the value to 0.02.
10.
Run the Analysis and review the results.  Generate a von Mises stress 
animation and a plot of displacement magnitude vs. time for two 
nodes – one on the drive wheel’s indexing pin and one on the perimeter of 
the driven wheel.

NOTE:
Depending upon the computer hardware, this analysis may take several 
hours to run.  You may wish to allow several steps to converge, stop the 
analysis, and then load the already completed model from the provided 
archive file, “Exercise M\Results Archive\Exercise M.ach”.

Multiphysics
• A multiphysics analysis combines the effects of 
multiple analysis types.
• The initial analysis is performed.  
• Another analysis is set up using the results from 
the initial analysis as the loading in the 
subsequent analysis.
• For some analyses, iterations are required to 
reach a converged solution.
• Steady or unsteady coupled fluid flow and 
thermal analyses solve for fluid and thermal 
results simultaneously.

convection on the temperature distribution (where 
the temperature does not significantly influence the flow 
pattern).
• Apply temperature results from a heat transfer 
analysis to a fluid flow analysis to drive natural 
convection (where the flow does not significantly 
influence the temperature distribution).

Background on Material Models
• Material models are subsets of the element 
types.
• These models allow you to make decisions 
on what type of material properties will be 
used for each part in the model.
• For example, if a part will see the plastic 
region of a stress versus strain curve, you 
should select one of the von Mises material 
models for an elastic/plastic analysis.

Orthotropic
• This material model can have different 
properties in the three orthogonal 
directions. 
• The required properties are identical to the 
isotropic material model.  However, you 
enter separate values for the three 
directions.

Temperature-Dependent
• For some elements, the properties for both 
isotropic and orthotropic materials can be 
defined on a temperature-dependent basis.
• The values are linearly interpolated between 
the specified temperature points.

Elastic-Plastic (von Mises)
• von Mises:  This material models is based on a bilinear 
simplification of the stress-strain curve.  The modulus 
for the elastic region, the yield point, and the modulus 
for the plastic region must be defined. If the material 
library includes the elastic modulus, yield point, 
ultimate strength, and elongation; the program will 
automatically calculate the plastic modulus for you.
• von Mises Curve:  This material model uses either an 
approximated stress-strain curve or actual stress-strain 
data.  As above, if the material library includes the 
elastic modulus, yield point, ultimate strength, and 
elongation; the approximated stress-strain curve will be 
generated automatically.  Alternately, you may define a 
table of true stress-strain data (either within the material 
library manager or the material application screen).

Elastic-Plastic (von Mises)
(continued)
• Isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening 
variants of the von Mises material models are 
available.  
– Use the “von Mises with Isotropic Hardening” model for 
non-reversing load conditions.
– The “von Mises with Kinematic Hardening” model is 
recommended for greater accuracy when reversing 
strain cycles will occur.

Foreword 
Starting Autodesk® Algor® Simulation 
The software may be started by:  
 
• 
Accessing the Windows "Start" menu and selecting the "All Programs" pull-out menu, 
followed by selecting the "Autodesk" group and the "Autodesk Algor Simulation" folder 
within it.  Select the "Autodesk Algor Simulation" command. 
• 
In addition, the program may be started by choosing the "Autodesk Algor Mesh" command 
within supported CAD solid modeling applications.  This method starts the program and transfers-
in the CAD solid model in one operation. 
 
Defaults 
Each exercise is written using the default program settings, as if the software has been opened for the first 
time after installation.  In this way, a user can work through the exercises in any order.  If a user will be 
working through several exercises during one session, some settings from one exercise may be retained, 
creating incorrect or invalid steps in the following exercise.  To minimize this possibility, exit the program 
at the end of each exercise and reopen it to begin a new exercise.  It is possible for an experienced user to 
work through several exercises without this precaution, but extra care should be taken to review that input 
is correct and appropriate. 
 
It is important that the user access view commands exactly as described, except as otherwise indicated (that 
is, from the pull-down menus or toolbars).  These commands ensure a constant and repeatable view 
orientation that is not ensured when using the ViewCube.  Specifically, while the displayed plane will be 
correct, the rotational position may not be as expected when using the ViewCube. 
 
Several program settings are global.  That is, once set, they will influence the program behavior for every 
model until the settings are changed again.  In particular, the solution steps in this manual may be 
invalidated if a deviation is made from any of the settings listed below.  These are the program settings 
upon which the solution procedures are based: 
 
• 
"Tools: Options" … 
o 
"Analysis" … 
 
"Automate Analysis" – Activated 
 
"Ask to show mesh results after CAD meshing" – Activated 


Input Files and Archives 
The University Course Curriculum is distributed in the form of an executable, self-extracting archive and is 
delivered electronically.  Hardcopies of the curriculum are not available.  When the downloaded archive is 
extracted, various documents and folders will be created within the folder at the extraction location.  Along 
with the Instructor Manual (PDF file) and the presentation slides (PPT file), there is a set of folders 
containing the example and exercise model input files and results archives.  These are clearly identified by 
the folder structure and naming convention.  Discretion should be used with regard to which files and 
folders are made available to the students via a shared network drive.  It is recommended that the instructor 
only shares the example and exercise model input files and results archives.  The Instructor Manual and 
presentation slideshow should not be shared.  However, exercise handouts may be provided for the students 
by selecting and printing the appropriate pages of the Instructor Manual or by printing excerpts as PDF 
files and sharing these with the students on a per-assignment basis. 
 
Many of the exercise input files are in the form of CAD universal formats.  A number of the 
input files, and all of the results files for the course examples and exercises, are in the form of 
Algor Simulation archive files (*.ach).  These input files and results archives must be copied 
to the local computer workstations for each student before they are opened.  Do not try to 
open or run models directly from a shared network drive.  This will produce excessive 
network traffic, slow down the analyses, and some analyses may fail to run across a network 
connection.  For this reason, students who have their “My Documents” folders mapped to a 
shared network drive, as is a common practice in university settings, should NOT place FEA 
models in their “My Documents” folder.  Instead, a folder for FEA models should be created 
on each local workstation hard drive.  Models can be archived to the shared folder for 
portability during the setup process or after they have been solved. 
 
Opening Archives 
1. Copy the set of folders and files to your local computer from the class directory.  
2. Start Autodesk Algor Simulation and select the "Open" icon at the left side of the dialog. 
3. Select the "Algor Simulation Archive (*.ach)" option in the Autodesk Algor Files section of the 
"Files of type:" drop-down box. 
4. Double-click to open the desired folder, highlight the desired file, and press the "Open" button. 
5. In the "Browse for Folder" screen, select a folder on the hard drive for the location of the 
restored model files. 
6. Click the “OK” button. 
 
The model will be restored to the selected folder and automatically opened in the FEA Editor environment.   
 
For exercises based on CAD solid models, the input files will be universal formats (such as STEP, IGES, 
and so on), rather than Algor Simulation archives.  These files should be placed in the desired working 
folder prior to opening them.  The FEA files will be created in the folder where the CAD file resides when it 
is opened. 
 
Printing of Exercise Descriptions and Solution Steps 
Individual exercise descriptions and/or solution steps within this manual may be printed and distributed to 
the students at the instructor's discretion.  However, they are not to be distributed beyond or outside of the 
current class of the university or trade school that owns the Autodesk® Algor® Simulation license.

Validation of Results 
The force in truss CD can be verified using the method of sections. 
 
First, the vertical reaction force at joint A is determined by summing the moments about joint G. 
 
∑Mz = 0 
1000(144) + 2000(288) - RA(432) = 0 
RA = 1666.667 lbs. 
 
Then, the truss assembly is sectioned though trusses BD, CD, and CE and the vertical forces are balanced. 
 
∑Fy = 0 
1666.667 – 2000 + FCD(8/10) = 0 
FCD = 416.667 lbs.

Figure D1:  Hoop Stress Results 
 
To compare the results with the theoretical value, the hoop stress should be obtained from a node at a 
distance removed from free ends or constraints.  This will avoid local effects, which the theoretical solution 
does not take into account.  When comparing FEA results with closed form solutions, it is important to be 
aware of any assumptions or limitations of the theoretical solution.  We will inquire on the nodal stresses at 
the mid-height of the ring (that is, at Z = 4”).

Cantilever Beam Model 
Brick Elements 
Objective:  
Determine the maximum bending stress in the beam from the applied load. 
 
Geometry: 
  
 
 
 
Loads: 
10,000 pounds will be applied downward at the free end of the beam.  This should be 
distributed between the nodes in the center horizontal row.  The two end nodes will have 
half the force that is applied to the other nodes. 
 
Constraints:  
The center row of nodes (running in the Y-direction) at the fixed end will be fully 
constrained.  The remaining nodes at the fixed end will be constrained only against 
translation in the X-direction. 
 
 
 
 
 
Elements:  
Brick 
 
Material:   
Steel (AISI 4130)

"Save" 
Press the "Save" button. 
 
We will create a mesh with four elements across the width of the cantilever cross-section and six elements 
across the height of the cross-section.  Since the bending stresses vary, and in fact reverse, across the cross-
section height, the higher element count in this direction will help to ensure that these bending stresses are 
accurately captured.  We will then extrude the cross-sectional mesh into a solid mesh, using twenty-four 
elements along the length of the cantilever.

Comparing Element Types  
Beam, 2-D, Plate and Brick Elements 
Objective: 
Analyze a beam model using different element types and compare the results.  
 
Geometry: 
 
 
 
 
Loads: 100 psi downward along the top. 
 
Constraints:  
Fixed at left end and simply supported at right end. 
 
 
 
 
 
Elements:  
2-D: 
The pressure is applied as a 100 psi surface load along the top edge. 
Beam: Convert the 100 psi load over the 0.25 in width to a 25 lb/in distributed load. 
Plate: 
Model the 10" x 0.5" dimensions and enter a thickness of 0.25".  The pressure 
must be converted to forces on the top edge as follows:    
 
• (Length/# elements along edge) * Width * Pressure = Force  
• Force/2 located at the end (i.e., corner) nodes 
Plate:  
Model the 10" x 0.25" dimensions and enter a thickness of 0.5".  The pressure is 
applied as a -100 psi traction load in the Z direction. 
Brick:  The pressure is applied as a 100 psi surface load. 
 
Material:   
Steel (AISI 4130) 
 
 
Note
 
:  This exercise must be performed using two design scenarios or two different analysis models.  The 
2-D element model must be analyzed separately from the rest of the models because 2-D elements cannot 
be included in any model that has nodes outside of the YZ plane (X=0).

Inquire on the result types listed in the “Results” table at the end of the exercise solution (page SE.77)  See 
how the listed 2-D part values compare with your results. 
 
Building the 3-D Model 
We will create a second design scenario in which to build the 3-D model, since we cannot mix 2-D and 3-D 
elements within a single analysis.  However, the remaining three variants may all be constructed within the 
second design scenario.

Mesh Convergence 
2-D Elements 
Objective:  
To perform a static stress analysis with linear material models on a classical problem, 
utilizing different meshes densities to determine where convergence occurs.  Use mesh 
density settings of 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400.  Increase the 2-D mesh 
generation "Angle" from the default value of 15 to 30 degrees.  This will ensure that the 
mesh density controls the element size for all cases, otherwise the angle would control 
the element size for coarser meshes. 
 
Geometry: 
The part shown below is 1" thick.

Mechanical Event Simulation (MES), Geneva Mechanism 
Brick and Pipe Elements 
Objective:  
Create universal joints for the rotation, loading, and constraining of two CAD-
based parts.  Define surface to surface contact to produce the proper component 
interaction.  The drive wheel will be rotated one-half of a revolution to produce 
a single, 90º indexing movement of the driven wheel.  Produce a von Mises 
stress animation as well as a graph showing the displacement magnitude versus 
time at the drive wheel's indexing pin and at the OD of the driven wheel. 
 
Geometry: 
Use the Exercise M.stp file located in the "Exercise M\Input File" directory.  See 
next page for meshing, geometry modification, and contact setup instructions. 
 
 
 
• Joint 1 center vertex location; (0, 0, -0.125) 
• Joint 2 center vertex location; (1.414214, 0, -0.125) 
• Joint 3 center vertex location; (0, 0, 0.875) 
• Joint 4 center vertex location; (1.414214, 0, 0.875) 
 
Loads: 
Initial velocity of 30 rpm about axis through Joints 1 and 3 (parallel to Z-axis) 
applied to the Drive Wheel (Part 1) 
 
Prescribed displacement of a half-revolution in one second (30 rpm) at Joint 3. 
 
Constant 2 lbf.in. nodal Z-moment at Joint 4 (Assign to Load Curve 2 and set a 
"Death Time" of 1 second for Active Range 1 to ensure that the displacement 
remains active for the entire simulation event.) 
 
Nodal lumped mass at Joint 4 – Uniform mass of 0.00088 lbf s2/in and a mass 
moment of inertia in the Z-direction of 0.00135 lbf s2 in.  These values simulate 
a steel disk 1/8” thick with a diameter of 3.5”

Load Curve 1 (Prescribed Rotation)… 
 
 
 
 
Load Curve 2 (Nodal Moment)… 
 
 
 
 
Meshing, Geometry Modification, and Surface Contact Setup Instructions:  
1. Set the default contact = “Free/No Contact” and define a surface contact 
pair between Part 1 and Part 2, which will prevent mesh matching between 
the parts (this is desirable for MES contact surfaces). 
2. Mesh the model at an absolute mesh size of 0.0625”. 
3. Modify line attributes to consolidate the contact surfaces.  Use surface 100 
for the 1st contact pair, 101 for the 2nd, and 102 for the 3rd.  For the drive 
wheel, surfaces 100 and 101 will each encompass approximately one-third 
of the perimeter of the wheel’s C-shaped cylindrical contact surface. 
4. From the “General Surface-to-Surface Contact” settings, redefine the first 
pair to be Part 1/Surface 100 to Part 2/Surface 100.  Create two more pair; 
Part 1/Surface 101 to Part 2/Surface 101 and Part 1/Surface 102 to 
Part 2/Surface 102.  Set the contact element “Updating” to “Automatic.”  
Set the contact parameters for all three pair as follows… 
• 
Contact problem type = “High Speed Contact (Impact)” 
• 
Contact type = “Surface to Surface” 
• 
User specified contact stiffness = 1000 lbf/in 
• 
User specified contact tolerance = 0.0011” (eliminates clearance and 
chatter).

Nonlinear contact occurs between a node and an element face rather than between pairs of nodes, as is the 
case for linear contact.  For this reason, it is best if the meshes between adjacent contact parts are not 
matched.  By default, meshes are not matched for MES contact pairs.  That's why it's important to define 
surface contact between parts 1 and 2 prior to meshing.  Later, we will modify the geometry and the contact 
definitions, localizing the contact calculations to include only those surface pairs where contact will 
actually occur.  This will be done to minimize the number of contact calculations the solver must perform 
and to speed up the analysis. 
 
We will also specify an absolute mesh size of 0.0625".  The program's default geometry-based mesh sizing 
function will automatically provide finer elements around the circumference of the small pin, resulting in an 
acceptable mesh without further refinement.

NOTE
 
: Depending upon the computer hardware, this analysis may take an hour or several hours to run.  If time is 
limited, you may wish to allow several steps to converge, stop the analysis, and then load the already 
completed model from the provided archive file, “Exercise M\Results Archive\Exercise M.ach”. 
Viewing the Results 
We will review the stress results for time step 44 (when the peak stress occurs), create and export a graph 
showing the displacement magnitude as a function of time, and create an animation showing the stress 
results for the whole simulation. 
 
We will also turn off the display of contact diagnostic probes so that they will not appear within the 
animation.  These probes mark areas of node/surface penetration and/or chatter and are useful for 
troubleshooting a model that is having difficulty converging.  They do not necessarily indicate a problem, 
since slight, localized penetration is not uncommon and may be insignificant.  Contact behavior is 
influenced by the mesh density, mesh smoothness, and contact stiffness.  Chatter is generally the result of 
excessive contact stiffness and makes convergence more difficult. 
 
 
Mouse 
Click the "Toggle Load and Constraint Display" toolbar 
button to turn off the display of the load and constraint 
symbols.  Your screen should now look similar to Figure L1. 
 
Mouse 
Disable the displaying of “Contact Diagnostic Probes” by 
clicking the associated toolbar icon.

The annotation and legend will indicate the maximum stress value.  This stress should be approximately 
5,000 to 5,200 psi and will be in the contact area of the indexing pin.  Contact stresses are rather sensitive 
to surface mesh and contact settings changes, so expect different peak values for modeling variants.  The 
screen image should resemble Figure M4.

Before making the stress animation, let's override the default legend range for the plot.  This will be done 
for the following two reasons: 
1. To make the correlation between stress level and plot color consistent for all video 
frames—otherwise, the stress range in the legend will be recalculated for each frame 
based on the minimum and maximum stress result at that time step only. 
2. Because the high contact stresses are localized and the typical stresses in the two 
wheels are much lower—changing the display range to a lesser maximum value will 
bring out a broader range of color throughout the assembly and reveal the more 
typical and lower stress values.

The maximum stress is about 40,300 psi, which is well over the yield stress of 36,000 psi.  Therefore, a 
nonlinear material model is necessary.  We will create a second design scenario within the model for the non-
linear run.  Before doing so, we will check the displacement magnitude to compare with the later results, 
which will consider plastic deformation. 
 
 
"Results: Displacement: 
Magnitude" 
Access the RESULTS pull-down menu and select the 
"Displacement" pull-out menu.  Choose the "Magnitude" 
command.   
 
The maximum displacement magnitude should be about 2.67 inches.  We expect this number to be less than 
the actual displacement with plastic deformation considered. 
 
Creating a New Design Scenario  
 
"Tools: FEA Editor" 
Access the TOOLS pull-down menu and select the "FEA 
Editor" command. 
 
Mouse 
Right-click on the "Design Scenario 1" heading in the tree 
view and select the "Copy" command. 
 
Mouse 
Right-click on the "Design Scenario 1" heading in the tree 
view and select the "Rename" command.

Type "Elastic Material" into the "Description" field. 
 
“OK” 
Click the “OK” button. 
 
Mouse 
Right-click on the "Design Scenario 2" heading in the tree 
view and select the "Rename" command. 
 
"Nonlinear Material" 
Type "Nonlinear Material" into the "Description" field. 
 
“OK” 
Click the “OK” button. 
 
You now have two design scenarios defined within the model, one for the elastic (isotropic) material model 
and one for the non-linear (von Mises with isotropic hardening) material model.  Double-clicking on an 
inactive scenario heading will make it the active scenario.  We will now modify the element data for the 
second design scenario to specify the non-linear material model. 
 
Modifying the Element Data  
 
Mouse 
Right-click on the "Element Definition" heading for Part 1 
in the tree view. 
 
"Modify Element Definition..." 
Select the "Modify Element Definition…" command. 
 
"von Mises with Isotropic 
Hardening" 
Select the "von Mises with Isotropic Hardening" option 
in the "Material Model" drop-down box. 
 
“OK” 
Click the “OK” button. 
 
Since the material model has been changed, we will revisit the material selection dialog to refresh the 
properties for the selected material. 
 
 
Mouse 
Double-click on the "Material" heading for Part 1 in the 
tree view. 
 
"OK" 
Verify that a non-zero “Strain Hardening Modulus” is shown in 
the material properties list and click "OK."

Running the Analysis 
 
"Analysis: Perform Analysis…" 
Access the ANALYSIS pull-down menu and select 
the "Perform Analysis…" command. 
 
Viewing the Results 
 
"Results: Stress: Beam and Truss: 
Worst Stress" 
Access the RESULTS pull-down menu and select the 
"Stress" pull-out menu.  Select the "Beam and 
Truss" pull-out menu and select the "Worst Stress" 
command.  The maximum stress (~37,287 psi) is now 
below the previous value.  Therefore the effect of the 
lower modulus that was used after yield is obvious. 
 
"Results: Displacement: Magnitude" 
Access the RESULTS pull-down menu and select the 
"Displacement" pull-out menu.  Choose the 
"Magnitude" command.  The displacement with 
plasticity of the material taken into account (~4.65 
inches) is approximately 2 inches greater than the 
prior displacement.
