Abstract
With the remarkable advancements in image generation and open-form text gener-
ation, the creation of interleaved image-text content has become an increasingly
intriguing field. Multimodal story generation, characterized by producing narra-
tive texts and vivid images in an interleaved manner, has emerged as a valuable
and practical task with broad applications. However, this task poses significant
challenges, as it necessitates the comprehension of the complex interplay be-
tween texts and images, and the ability to generate long sequences of coherent,
contextually relevant texts and visuals. In this work, we propose SEED-Story,
a novel method that leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
to generate extended multimodal stories. Our model, built upon the powerful
comprehension capability of MLLM, predicts text tokens as well as visual to-
kens, which are subsequently processed with an adapted visual de-tokenizer to
produce images with consistent characters and styles. We further propose mul-
timodal attention sink mechanism to enable the generation of stories with up to
25 sequences (only 10 for training) in a highly efficient autoregressive manner.
Additionally, we present a large-scale and high-resolution dataset named StoryS-
tream for training our model and quantitatively evaluating the task of multimodal
story generation in various aspects. The models, codes and datasets are released in
https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Story.

Introduction
Interleaved image-text data is ubiquitous on the internet, characterized by multiple images interspersed
with text. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in generating interleaved image-text
content [52, 16, 1, 11, 49], driven by the remarkable advancements in image generation [43, 26, 9, 36,
54] and open-form text generation [53, 48, 59]. This has given rise to Multimodal Story Generation,
an intriguing and valuable task that involves the generation of narrative texts and vivid images in
an interleaved manner. This task goes beyond traditional text-based storytelling by fusing text and
visuals to enrich narratives, creating a more immersive storytelling experience where visuals and text
dynamically interact and complement each other.
However, multimodal story generation poses significant challenges due to the complexity of the
inputs and the high demands on the quality of the outputs. Firstly, this task necessitates a thorough
comprehension of interleaved data, where text is not only abstract and narrative in nature, but also
deeply intertwined with complex images. The model must be adept at deciphering the intricate
relationships between images and texts to maintain a coherent narrative flow. Secondly, this task
requires the generation of not only a plausible text plot, but also visually captivating images that
are consistent in characters and styles. The model should be capable of achieving coherence in the
generation of both text and visuals, ensuring an engaging storytelling output.
Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [23, 60, 39, 5, 28, 58, 26, 22] have show-
cased powerful comprehension abilities in understanding multimodal data, which makes them ideally
suited for interleaved image-text content in multimodal stories. Consequently, we introduce SEED-
Story, a novel approach that builds upon the MLLM to harness its comprehension strength, while
further equipping it with the capability to generate coherent images align with the narrative texts.
Specifically, following previous work [45, 16], we utilize a pre-trained image tokenizer and de-
tokenizer, which can decode realistic images with SD-XL [41] by taking the features of a pre-trained
ViT as input. During training, given the interleaved visual and textual data, we adopt the next-word
prediction and image feature regression training objectives to regularize multimodal generation. A
fixed number of learnable queries are fed into the MLLM, where the output hidden states are trained
to reconstruct the ViT features of the target images. To further enhance the consistency of characters
and styles in generated images, we propose de-tokenizer adaptation, where the regressed image
features from the MLLM are fed into the de-tokenizer for tuning SD-XL. This adaptation allows for
better maintenance of coherence in low-level image details from the de-tokenizer, ensuring a more
visually consistent storytelling output.

Furthermore, to enable the efficient generation of coherent long stories, we propose a multimodal
attention sink mechanism based on window attention [7], which maintains a fixed-size sliding window
on the Key-Value (KV) states of the most recent tokens, as well as the beginning of text tokens,
images tokens, and the end of image tokens. We empirically find that retaining these tokens will
largely mitigate the model’s failure with window attention when the token length surpasses the cache
size, allowing our model to generalize to longer sequences than the training sequence length in an
efficient manner. Our model with the proposed multimodal attention sink mechanism can generate
long stories with up to 30 multimodal sequences, featuring rich text plots and diverse visual scenarios.
Additionally, we introduce a dataset named StoryStream for training and evaluating multimodal
story generation. We design an automatic pipeline that leverages MLLMs to obtain a large-scale and
high-resolution dataset featuring a sequence of narrative-rich texts and intriguing images, derived
from animated videos. StoryStream is four times larger in terms of data volume compared to the
existing largest story dataset [27], and it boasts higher image resolution, longer sequence lengths,
and more detailed story narratives. We further meticulously design evaluation metrics to assess
multimodal story generation, taking into account image style consistency, story engagement, and
image-text coherence. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model, SEED-Story, achieves
superior performance in these aspects.
In summary, Our contributions are three-fold. (1) We propose SEED-Story, a novel method that
leverages an MLLM to generate multimodal stories with rich narrative text and contextually relevant
images. (2) We propose multimodal attention sink to enable the efficient generation of long stories
with sequence lengths larger than those used during training. (3) We introduce StoryStream, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for training and benchmarking multimodal story generation.

Related Work
Story Visualization vs. Multimodal Story Generation
The domain of story visualization, initially
pioneered by StoryGAN [25], has witnessed substantial advancements across various models focus-
ing on improving image quality, narrative flow, and character consistency. StoryGAN introduced
a framework based on sequential conditional GANs with dual discriminators that enhanced both
narrative coherence and visual fidelity. Subsequent developments such as DuCoStoryGAN [32]
and VLCStoryGAN [31] have integrated video captioning to better align text descriptions with
corresponding visuals. The field has further expanded with the adoption of diffusion models aimed
at refining the quality of generated story images. StoryDALL-E [33] utilizes pre-trained models
augmented with cross-attention layers to support story progression from an initial image. Innovations
like AR-LDM [35] and Story-LDM [42] have introduced auto-regressive diffusion models to create
coherent sequences of images, while TaleCrafter [17] has employed LoRA and optimization tech-
niques to ensure consistent characters throughout complex visual narratives. Intelligent Grimm [27]
has proposed open-ended story visualization and has developed the auto-regressive model StoryGen,
which includes a vision-language context module to further enhance character consistency. In con-
trast to all above, our work advances beyond story visualization by focusing on multimodal story
generation. This approach continues the story with additional text and creates corresponding images,
offering a richer, more engaging narrative experience into the story generation process.
MLLM for Multimodal Story Generation
In the rapidly evolving domain of large language
models (LLMs) [53, 8, 10] and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [23, 60, 30, 40, 6,
29, 58, 26, 46, 57, 15, 14, 55, 11, 61, 47, 24], recent research, such as StoryGPTV [44], explores
using MLLMs for story generation by converting visual features into token embeddings. StoryGPTV
requires character and object masks for training its LDM. In contrast, our model, with the visual
tokenization and de-tokenization, have a stronger visual comprehension ability, making it trains
directly from interleaved text and image data without the need for masks. MM-interleaved [52] design
an MMFS module to process interleaved text-image data and achieve multimodal story generation
through image features and LLM output. While our approach directly generates images through LLM
output tokens. We take MM-interleaved as an important baseline and compare with it.
Visual Story Dataset
In the landscape of datasets for visual storytelling, various collections have
been developed. The VIST [20] dataset is noteworthy for its use of realistic images, though it
struggles with maintaining character consistency across stories. The Pororo [25] and Flintstones [18]

datasets, while popular for animation-based story datasets, are hindered by their low resolution and
the simplicity of their accompanying texts. Another significant dataset is StorySalon [27], which
offers high-resolution images and is large in scale, but it lacks global consistency across a series
of images. To address these gaps, we introduce StoryStream, a globally consistent, large-scale,
high-resolution animated style dataset with engaging, narrative-rich text for complex storytelling,
overcoming the limitations of existing datasets. The analysis is shown in Table 1.

Method
3.1
Story Generation with Multimodal Large Language Model
Visual Tokenization and De-tokenization
The overview of our method is presented in Figure 2.
To effectively extend visual stories, our model must comprehend and generate both images and text.
Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in generative MLLMs that unify image comprehension
and generation [41], we develop a multimodal story generation model. Our model employs a pre-
trained Vision Transformer [12] (ViT) as the visual tokenizer and a pre-trained diffusion model
as the visual de-tokenizer to decode images by using ViT’s features as inputs. Specifically, visual
embeddings from the ViT tokenizer are fed into a learnable module, which then serves as inputs for
the U-Net of the pre-trained SD-XL [41]. This process replaces the original text features with visual
embeddings. During this stage, the parameters are optimized using open-world text-image pair data
as well as story data to enhance the model’s encoding-decoding capability. After this training phase,
we expect the visual tokenizer and de-tokenizer modules to preserve as much image information as
possible in the feature space.
Story Instruction Tuning
In our instruction tuning process for story generation, we sample a
random-length subset of a story data point for each iteration. The model is tasked with predicting
the next image and the next sentence of the story text. Within MLLM, all images are converted into
image features using a pre-trained ViT tokenizer. For the target text tokens, we perform next-token
prediction and use Cross Entropy loss to train for this discrete target. For the target image features,
the model uses a series of learnable queries as inputs and continuously outputs a series of latent
embeddings. We then compute the cosine similarity loss between the MLLM’s output and the target
image features. During this stage, we fine-tune the SEED-Story model using a LoRA [19] module.
De-tokenizer Adaptation
After instruction tuning, the SEED-Story MLLM effectively produces
story images with correct semantics but lacks style consistency and details. We attribute this issue to
the misalignment between the latent space of the MLLM output and the image features. To address
this, we perform de-tokenizer adaptation for style and texture alignment. In this stage, only the
SD-XL image de-tokenizer is trained. Conditioned on the MLLM output embeddings, SD-XL is
expected to generate images that are pixel-level aligned with the ground truth. The separate training
of the de-tokenizer offers two key advantages. First, it avoids optimization conflicts between the
LLM and the de-tokenizer. Second, it conserves memory, making the process executable on GPUs
with limited memory.

Long Story Generation with Multimodal Attention Sink
Generating long visual stories has substantial potential in various applications, including education
and entertainment. However, creating these stories with MLLMs presents significant challenges.
Datasets for extended, interleaved stories are not only rare but also impede the training process due

Figure 2: Overview of the SEED-Story Training Pipeline: In Stage 1, we pre-trains an SD-XL-based
de-tokenizer to reconstruct images by taking the features of a pre-trained ViT as inputs. In Stage 2,
we sample an interleaved image-text sequence of a random length and train the MLLM by performing
next-word prediction and image feature regression between the output hidden states of the learnable
queries and ViT features of the target image. In Stage 3, the regressed image features from the
MLLM are fed into the de-tokenizer for tuning SD-XL, enhancing the consistency of the characters
and styles in the generated images.
to their complexity. To address this, we have to employ a train-short-test-long approach, training
models on shorter narratives and extending to longer generations during inference.
Moreover, during inference, generating significantly longer stories than the training data often leads
to model degradation, producing lower-quality images, as illustrated in the first row of Figure 10.
This process also requires extensive token usage to ensure continuity and coherence, which in turn
increases memory and computational demands.
A simplistic solution for this is to use a sliding window technique, depicted in Figure 3 right (b).
However, this method disrupts the token relationships in the Key-Value (KV) cache, resulting in subpar
generative outcomes, as demonstrated by StreamingLLM [56]. To overcome this, StreamingLLM
introduces an attention sink mechanism that preserves the initial tokens, thus allowing for efficient
processing of lengthy generations without quality compromise. While effective in language models,
its efficacy diminishes in multimodal contexts, as shown in Figure 3 right (c).
To enhance long multimodal generation, we revisit the attention maps of MLLMs. After conducting
numerous experiments across various models and cases, we analyze the attention maps across different

layers and heads. Our analysis reveals that most queries predominantly focus on four types of tokens:
(1) starting tokens, (2) punctuation tokens, (3) beginning-of-image (BoI) tokens, and (4) end-of-image
(EoI) tokens. Unlike language-only models, MLLMs place considerable attention on specific image
tokens, particularly those near the BoI and EoI, as illustrated in Figure 3 left.
Building on these insights, we propose a new mechanism for extended generation in MLLMs, termed
the multimodal attention sink. During generation, we consistently retain the starting tokens and the
image tokens adjacent to the BoI and EoI. Although punctuation tokens receive high attention values,
their latent value norms are minimal, contributing insignificantly to the final output, so we do not
keep them, as noted by [13]. Our proposed mechanism enables our model to generate high-quality
images while maintaining a low computational footprint.

StoryStream Dataset
4.1
Dataset Construction
An ideal source for creating a multimodal story generation dataset is cartoon series, which inherently
contain rich plots and consistent character portrayals. We selected three cartoon series to construct
our dataset and we present the Curious George in the main body of our paper. The process begins
with collecting various series, from which we extract keyframes and their associated subtitles [21].
Each keyframe is then processed by GPT-4V [34] or Qwen-VL [6] to generate a detailed image
description. These elements—keyframe, subtitle, and description—are compiled into a single group.
We aggregate 30 such groups and input them into GPT-4, supplemented with background information
about the cartoon series. Following our instructions, GPT-4 generates high-quality narrative texts
suitable for training story generation models.
During dataset construction, we discovered that employing the above chain of thought approach
not only produces more accurate narrative text but also speeds up the construction process. Unlike
directly feeding all images directly to GPT-4, which is limited to 10 images due to API constrains, our
approach produces longer stories. We also significantly improve the model’s understanding of each
image by incorporating detailed descriptions. This enhancement in image comprehension enriches
the narrative details, providing a richer story generation reference.

Key Features
Large-scale.
Our StoryStream dataset comprises three subsets totaling 257,850 released images.
This represents a significant improvement over existing datasets in terms of scale, specific numbers
are presented in column 2 of Table 1. To the best of my knowledge, it is the largest visual story
generation dataset featuring consistent main characters.
High Resolution.
Unlike existing story generation datasets, such as Flintstones and Pororo, which
offer images at a resolution of 128x128, our story stream dataset provides high-resolution images of
480x768.
Narrative Text.
Our dataset diverges from existing ones that utilize simple and descriptive lan-
guage. We offer abstract, narrative, detailed, and story-toned texts that are more akin to real-world
applications, such as visualizing narratives from a storybook, examples are shown in Figure 4. Story

text of existing datasets obey the form of “name” + “action”, like “Poby is playing the violin.”.
Contrarily, our story text involves more intrinsic elements. This effectively enhances the engagement
of audiences. An analysis of the average text length per sentence is shown in column 5 of Table 1.
Long Sequence.
Moreover, our dataset enhances long story comprehension by offering up to 30
images per story point. Within these 30 images, our corresponding texts present a cohesive narrative,
effectively conveying the progression and intricacies of extended stories.

Previous story generation approaches primarily utilize

These models take the previous image and text as input,
and then generate only the next image based on the current
text prompt. For a fair comparison, we adapt our model
to a visualization-only format. For StoryGen [27], we also
train it to produce images with previous images and texts. For LDM [43], we only give it text-image
pairs. The visual results are shown in Figure 5. SEED-Story model shows better style and character
consistency and higher quality compared to baselines. We also conduct a quantitative evaluation in

Multimodal Story Generation
For comparative analysis, there are relatively few established methods for generating multimodal
stories. To establish a baseline for comparison, we fine-tune the recently developed MM-interleaved
model on our dataset. We detail the comparative results in Figure 6. The FID is employed to assess
the visual quality of the generated images. Additionally, we ask GPT-4V to compare and choose a
preferred option between each of the generation results of MM-interleaved and SEED-Story across
several dimensions: Style Consistency, which evaluates the stylistic uniformity across different
images; Story Engagement, which measures the ability of narratives to captivate and maintain
audience interest; and Image-Text Coherence, which assesses the alignment and relevance between
images and their accompanying texts. The appendix presents our visual results and details about
prompt engineering methods.
For qualitative presentation, we demonstrate our SEED-story effectively helps users control the
story plot. Figure 7 shows that using the same starting image but different initial texts, the narrative
branches into two distinct storylines.
We provide more cases in Figure 8 and Figure 9 to prove our multimodal long story generation
capabilities. SEED-story can generate long sequences with engaging plots and vivid images.

They drove along a curved road 
surrounded by grass and trees. The 
sky was clear, and George's heart 
was full of excitement.
Suddenly, George noticed a cat 
lying on the road. He crouched 
near the car's front wheel, 
watching the cat.
George stood near the parked car, 
looking up at the man in the 
yellow hat. They were surrounded 
by trees and a blue sky.
George, with his big eyes and 
mischievous smile, stood ready 
for the next adventure.
They reached a colorful park with a 
slide, a ladder, and a playground. 
The green bushes and trees added to 
the playful atmosphere.
George and the man in the yellow hat 
stood beside the parked car in the 
green landscape. They were ready for 
their next adventure.
Their journey led them to a vibrant 
landscape with a large slide in the 
foreground. A slide extended into a 
pool, inviting them to play.
They reached a vibrant roller coaster 
track set against a blue sky with fluffy 
white clouds. The ride featured red and 
yellow accents, adding to its charm.
The amusement park was colorful and 
bustling with visitors. A large Ferris 
wheel stood in the foreground, with 
buildings and greenery in the distance.
The man in the yellow hat and George 
stood in front of a roller coaster track, 
looking concerned. They were unsure of 
what to do next.
George, with his big, curious eyes, 
looked up at the man in the yellow hat. 
He was eager to have some fun.
Their journey took them to a colorful 
amusement park with a towering roller 
coaster. The park was surrounded by 
greenery and a cityscape.
The next day, George and the man in 
the yellow hat found themselves on a 
roller coaster. George appeared excited 
while the man looked concerned. Their 
adventure had just begun.
On their way home, they took a boat 
ride. The man held onto the steering 
wheel, while George and a child peeked 
out from the boat's window, smiling. 
They were having a great time.
Finally, they returned to their colorful house. 
The walls and the roof under the clear sky 
made the house look inviting and peaceful. 
It was the perfect end to a perfect day.
The man in the yellow hat and 
George waved goodbye from the 
doorway of their house. They were 
ready for another day of adventures.
At the end of the day, they returned to 
their vibrant yellow house. The walls 
and roof glowed in the twilight, and the 
trees and hills in the background added 
to the peacefulness of their home.
Finally, George and the man in the yellow hat sat 
on a bench inside a colorful cockpit with a steering 
wheel and control levers. They were ready to go 
home, but their adventurous spirit was ready for 
the next day.
The man in the yellow hat and George waved 
goodbye from the doorway of their house.

while George and a child peeked out from 
a window. They were all smiling, looking 
forward to their next adventure.
Finally, George and the man in the yellow hat 
sat on a bench inside a colorful cage with a 
bright wheel. The man looked concerned while 
George appeared curious. They were ready to 
go home, but their adventurous spirit was 
ready for the next day.

Long Story Generation
To verify our effectiveness in long story generation, we conduct an experiment visualizing a long
story using the SEED-Story model, but with varying attention mechanisms. We chunk our data into
stories of length of 10 considering the training efficiency. We set the window size as the same as the
training length. Qualitative results depict in Figure 10 demonstrate that window attention quickly
collapses when the inference length exceeds the training length. Both dense attention and attention
sink approaches fare better, yet still fail to produce meaningful images as the inference sequence
lengthens. In contrast, the multimodal attention sink consistently produces high-quality images.
In terms of efficiency, the multimodal attention sink exhibits significant improvement over dense
attention, with only a modest increase in time and memory costs compared to window attention and
vanilla attention sink. These additional costs stem from retaining extra image tokens in the KV cache.
Quantitative results presented in Table 3 substantiate the above conclusion.

Conclusion
This work introduces SEED-Story, a pioneering approach that leverages a Multimodal Large Language
Model to generate multimodal long stories with rich narrative text and contextually relevant images.
We propose a multimodal attention sink mechanism to enable our model to generalize to generating
long sequences in an efficient manner. We further present a high-quality dataset named StoryStream
for training and benchmarking the task of multimodal story generation effectively.

Implementation Details
A.1
Visual Tokenization and De-tokenization
For visual tokenization, we use Qwen-VL pre-trained ViT-G. We first resize the image to 448x448
images and then use ViT to produce its feature of length256 with 4096 dimension. (shape: [256,
4096]). Inside the MLLM, we use a Q-Former architecture to process the image embedding. It takse
the ViT image feature as key and Value, and conduct attention with its learnable queries. The length
of learnable queries are 64. For de-tokenization, we also use a Q-Former architecture to transform
the MLLM output to the shape of SD-XL condition embedding.
A.2
Instruction Tuning
Instruction tuning data is formatted as follows: for each story, we sample a random length and
compute losses on the last sequence (highlighted in red text). The sequence format is structured as:
<bos>[start of the story.][User prompt:
][following sequence
1][following sequence 2][following sequence 3][following
sequence 4] ...
[target sequence]<eos>
For our language model (LLM), we utilize the LLAMA2-7B pre-trained model and finetune it
using LoRA, supported by the peft library. The hyperparameter r is set to 6, and lora_alpha
is set to 32.
The modules optimized include the q_projection_layer, v_projection_layer,
k_projection_layer, o_projection_layer, gate_projection_layer, down_projection_layer,
and up_projection_layer. We employ a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 to finetune this model on
our dataset across approximately 6 epochs, utilizing 8 NVIDIA-A800 GPUs.
A.3
De-tokenizer Adaptation
In this stage we fully finetune the SD-XL model. The data format is as the same as instruction
tuning, but we fix all MLLM params and optimize only the SD-XL. It takes the MLLM output and
is asked to produce image correspond to the ground truth. The SD-XL model was trained using 4
NVIDIA-A800 GPUs. A learning rate of 1 × 10−4 was chosen to facilitate gradual weight updates,
ensuring stable convergence, while a weight decay of 0.03 was applied for regularization to prevent
overfitting. Training was performed using mixed precision (bf16), which significantly reduced
memory usage and accelerated the training process without compromising the model’s accuracy.
The model underwent three training epochs, balancing the learning of complex patterns against
computational resource use, optimized for large-scale datasets and sophisticated model architectures.
B
Attention Map Visualization
In this section, we present additional visualizations of attention maps. These maps are derived from
various model runs, including varying data lengths, attention heads, and layers. The visualizations

Details about GPT-4V Evaluation
F.1
Comparative Evaluation
To evaluate the effectiveness of MM-interleaved and SEED-Story in multimodal story generation,
we initiate an experiment where each model produces a story of five segments, based on a common
starting image and text. The segment limit is set to five to accommodate the constraints of GPT-4V,
which can handle a maximum of ten images per input session. In total, we generate 180 stories for
assessment. For evaluation, we employ GPT-4 or GPT-4V to determine which model produces the
better story in each case, based on the framework established in L-Eval [2]. We calculate the win rate
for each model to determine its performance relative to its counterpart. The prompt we used is shown
below.
“Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the generation story
contents provided by two AI assistants. Your job is to evaluate which assistant’s
generation is better. Your evaluation should consider {the style consistency of the
story images / the engagement of the story / the coherence of the generated
text and images}. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which
the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the
length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of
the assistants.Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output
your final verdict by strictly following this format: “[[A]]” if assistant A is better,
“[[B]]” if assistant B is better, and “[[C]]” for a tie.”
F.2
Score Evaluation
We also provide a prompt for directly estimating the performance of the generated results without
comparing to others. The prompt we used is shown below. We present the direct estimation score is
shown in Table 4
“Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the generation story
contents provided by an AI assistant. Your job is to give a score out of 10. Your
evaluation should consider {the style consistency of the story images / the en-
gagement of the story / the coherence of the generated text and images}. Do
not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Be as objective
as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final score by strictly
following this format: “[[score]]”, such as “[[7]]”.”
Table 4: GPT4 score evaluation results in 3 different aspects-style consistency, story engaging level,
and text-image coherence.

Story Video
To showcase the capabilities of our multimodal generation model, we employ a video generation
technique to animate the images. We then synchronize these moving images with audio to create a
narrative video, which is available in our supplementary materials.

Broader Impacts
This project may potentially produce copyrighted content, particularly when used inappropriately or
without adherence to existing intellectual property laws. To mitigate this risk, we will implement a
rigorous compliance framework that respects the copyrights of third parties. This involves setting
strict usage licenses that align with the legal standards dictated by our data sources. Our aim is to
protect intellectual property rights while fostering innovation and ethical use of our technology. We
20

also commit to educating users on the importance of respecting intellectual property rights when
using our technology. This will be achieved through detailed user guidelines, training sessions, and
readily available support to help users understand and navigate the complexities of copyright laws.
By taking these measures, we aim not only to comply with legal standards but also to promote a
culture of respect for intellectual property within our user community, thereby contributing positively
to the broader digital ecosystem.
I
Limitations
Lack of Realistic Data Experimentation:
This limitation points to a potential gap in the validation
of the SEED-Story model under practical, real-world conditions. Without experiments using realistic
data, it’s difficult to ascertain how the model would perform in scenarios that are not perfectly
controlled or that deviate from the training conditions. This can be crucial, especially in applications
like storytelling where the context and variability of real-world data play significant roles. A possible
solution would be to incorporate a broader range of test conditions, including noisy data or data from
"in-the-wild" storytelling scenarios, to evaluate the robustness and adaptability of the model.
Training on a Non-Diverse Dataset:
The second limitation is the restriction of the model’s training
to animation datasets which does not cover a large scale or diverse styles. This can severely limit the
model’s ability to generalize and produce outputs in styles that are not represented in the training
data. This is particularly limiting in creative tasks such as storytelling where the ability to adapt to
various artistic and narrative styles is crucial. To mitigate this, expanding the dataset to include a
wider array of styles, genres, and visual aesthetics could be beneficial.
