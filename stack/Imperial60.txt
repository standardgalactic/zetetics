INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE IMPERIAL MODEL 6o 
Unpacking 
Typewriters with cloth covers are packed in 
wood-wool, and the lid of the packing-case is 
nailed down. Remove the lid and lift the 
machine clear. The carriage will be found in a 
separate wrapping and it will be necessary to 
place this on the machine in accordance with 
instructions below. 
Typewriters with metal covers and base-
boards are clamped to the bottom of the case, 
which should first be unscrewed. Lift the 
bottom away from the case, together with the 
machine, baseboard and metal cover. 
Unscrew the machine from the baseboard 
and remove wrapping. 
Now turn the typewriter over on its side 
and remove the two hexagon headed nickel 
plated screws, each of which has a red label 
attached marked "PACKING SCREW. REMOVE 
BEFORE USING MACHINE". These screws are situ-
ated at the rear of the type-unit ( or keyboard 
section) and are screwed into the type-unit 
runners Nos. 29 and 30 Fig. I. Replace 
machine on feet and remove the two screws 
which will be found immediately underneath 
the type-unit release levers Nos. 23 and 24 
Fig.I. These screws will also be found to have 
red labels attached marked as above. The pur-
pose of these four screws is simply to ensure 
that the type-unit is securely locked in the 
typewriter frame during transit. 
Screw the machine back to the baseboard.

Assembling 
First unwrap the carriage (which will b c 
. 
e1ound 
m a separate compartment of the packin 
) 
. 
. 
g case 
and place 1t on the machme as follows:-
Lift the carriage by both hands, and with 
the fore-fmgers press the carriage clampin 
wedges on either side Nos. 15 & 16 Fig. 2 an~ 
Fig. 7. Place the carriage centrally over the 
machine, allowing it to fall over the two 
carriage locating studs Nos. 50 & 51 Fig. 2. 
In so doing carefully watch the front part of 
the carriage to ensure that there is a slight 
clearance between the platen and the card 
guide No. 52 Fig. 2. Be careful also to hold 
the carriage absolutely level when lowering 
on to the machine. When the carriage is cor-
rectly located on the studs, release the wedges, 
and the carriage will remain firmly in position. 
Remove the plugs at each end of the carriage 
as per instructions on labels attached. 
The margin stops Nos. 2 & 3 Fig. 2 will be 
found to be adjusted to the central position in 
order to lock the carriage for transit. These 
must be adjusted outwards along the scale as 
described in paragraph "Setting the Margin-
Stops" on page 9. 
All that remains to be done now before the 
carriage is ready for use is to attach the tension 
drawband No. 53 Fig. 2. To do this, first 
move the carriage to the full extent of its left-
hand traverse by · using the carriage release 
lever No. 8 Fig. 2. Now with the right-hand 
lift the drawband lever No. 54 Fig. 2 and at 
d

the same time move the carriage across to the 
right ~hen the drawband will be automatic-
ally attached. 
Remove the two safety locking screws 
under the right and left hand type-unit release 
levers Nos. 23 & 24 Fig. 2 and the machine is 
then ready for use. (Instructions for fitting the 
ribbon will be found on the next page). 
The Ribbon 
The ribbon is wound on two spools Nos. 56 & 
57 Fig. 3 and automatically moves along one 
space each time a character is typed. This

movement ensures that the ribbon is worn 
evenly and as the ink quickly spreads from the 
unused to the used parts, uniformity of impres-
sion is made certain. The ribbon does not 
move however when the space bar is used or 
when the carriage is moved by hand. 
Ribbon Colour Switch 
The Model 60 is fitted with a mechanism 
enabling the operator to write in either of two 
colours as desired e.g. Black/red, Blue/red, 
Brown/green, etc., the particular colours 
being determined by the choice of ribbon. On 

I • 
the le& of the type-unit front plate will be 
found the colour change lever No. 22 Fig. 3· 
When this lever is moved downwards the 
second colour is automatically brought into 
operation. 
Fitting the Ribbon 
Every machine is supplied complete with a 
ribbon and two spools which arc clearly 
marked on the top flange "right-hand" or 
"left-hand". It is important at all times to 
make sure that the spools are placed in their 
respective right and left-hand positions on the 
machine, with the marked side uppermost, 
otherwise they will not work correctly. 
"Imperitype" brand ribbons are recom-
mended and these are supplied ready wound 
on a spool marked "right-hand". When fitting 
a new ribbon therefore, it is necessary to wind 
the old ribbon on to the right-hand spool so 
that the left-hand spool is empty and ready to 
accommodate the new ribbon. To do this it 
is only necessary to move the ribbon reverse 
lever No. 44 Fig. I t:) the left, lift the hinged 
ribboncover No.19 Fig.3 and rotate the right-
hand spool in a clockwise direction until the 
ribbonisfullywound. The next operation is to 
remove the old ribbon and spools complete 
which is a simple operation. Depress shift-
lock key No. 26 Fig. 3 thereby locking the 
type-unit in the 'capital' position and replace 
hinged ribbon cover. Take hold of the ribbon 
each side. of the ribbon centre guide No. 40 
6 
Fig. 3 and move it downwards and inwards 
until the top edge becomes disengaged from 
the outside guides. The hinged ribbon cover 
should now be lifted up when the two ribbon 
spools will be seen. Do NOT MOVE THE 
CARRIAGE OR ATTEMPT TO REMOVE THE TYPE-
UNIT WHILST THE HINGED RIBBON COVER IS 
IN THE RAISED POSITION. Remove each spool 
by swinging the ribbon spool tension lever 
and guide Nos. 58 & 59 Fig. 3 out of the way 
and lift the two spools clear of the machine. 
Now detach the end of the old ribbon from 
the empty spool and attach the free end of the 
new one in its place. Take care to ensure that 
the black portion of the ribbon -is uppermost' 
and that there are at least three turns of ribbon 
on the left-hand spool before attempting to 
place on the machine. The new ribbon on its 
two spools should now be taken and placed 
on the respective spindles, again taking care to 
push back the tension levers whilst doing so 
and afterwards threading the ribbon through 
the tension lever guides No. 58 & 59 Fig. 3. 
Now close the ribbon cover and place the 
ribbon behind the inner prongs of the ribbon 
centre guide. The ribbon is now pressed down-
wards until the top edges are again engaged by 
the outside guides. To make the ribbon taut 
the ribbon reverse lever No. 44 Fig. I should 
now be moved to the right and the cover 
again lifted. The left-hand ribbon spool can 
now be lightly turned by hand to take up any 
slackness in the ribbon. Replace the hinged 
ribbon cover, release the shift-lock, and the 
machine is ready for use.

Reversing the Feed 
Should it be necessary at any time to alter the 
direction of the ribbon's motion this can be 
done by moving the ribbon reverse lever 
No. 44 Fig. I. When this is moved over to 
the right the ribbon winds on to the left-hand 
spool and vice-versa. 
Stencil Cutting 
When cutting stencils it is essential that the 
type shall not strike through the ribbon. By 
lifting the stencil switch No. 20 Fig. r the 
7 
ribbon mechanism is automatically thrown 
out of action and will remain so until the 
ribbon colour change lever No. 22 Fig. 3 is 
moved downwards into the black or red 
position. A safety lock in the colour change 
switch safeguards the operator against accident-
ally moving the lever into the Stencil position. 
Position of the Type-
writer when in use 
The height of the machine in relation to the 
position of the operator is of the greatest 
importance if the best results are to be obtained.

[,I 
Should the typewriter be either too high or 
too low, correct control of the keyboard can-
not be maintained. The typewriter table or 
desk should be about 26 inches high, and the 
surface perfectly horizontal. The height of the 
operator's chair should be such that the fore-
arms are just level when the elbows are resting 
close to the sides and the fore-fingers are 
covering the top row of keys. 
Inserting the Paper 
Before feeding paper into the machine lift 
bail bar No. 38 Fig. 4 to its full extent i.e. 
until it springs forward. Lower again until it 
rests against its supports and the auxiliary feed 
rollers Nos. 36 & 37 Fig. 4 will now be clear 
of the platen roller. 
Place paper on paper shelf No. 33 Fig. 4 
close up to paper locating guide No. 4 Fig. 4 
on the left of the paper shelf. This guide can be 
adjusted for position by simply sliding along 
as required. Now rotate platen turning knob 
No. 14 Fig. 4 away from you and the paper 
will automatically be fed through the machine, 
passing under the platen roller No. 7 Fig. 4 
and behind the bail bar rollers. Now push the 
thumb lever No. 34 or 35 Fig. 4 or move the 
line space lever No. 18 Fig. 4 and the auxiliary 
feed will spring smoothly back into its work-
ing position and automatically hold the paper 
firmly against the platen roller. The auxiliary 
8 
feed rollers can be adjusted for correct position 
by simply sliding them along the bail bar. 
Generally speaking they should be set about 
half an inch inwards from the edges of the 
paper. 
Adjusting the Paper 
If the paper has not been fed through perfectly 
straight it can be properly adjusted as follows. 
Pull forward the feed roller release lever 
No. 31 Fig. 4 to its full extent. This frees the 
paper in the machine and also slightly raises 
the bail bar and auxiliary feed rollers. The 
edges of the paper can now be adjusted until 
they are quite level after which the feed roller 
release can be returned to its normal position. 
Setting the Margin 
Stops 
The width of the writing line is controlled by 
the position of the left and right-hand margin 
stops Nos. 2 & 3 Fig. I which can be set in any 
desired position. The new "Quickset" margins 
on the Model 60 can be set in a moment, 
using the right-hand only, as follows. Hold 
the right-hand platen turning knob to steady 
the carriage, depress the "Quickset" margin 
lever No. 32 Fig. 4 with the thumb and move 
the carriage until the margin stop desired to 
be set is picked up. By keeping the margin

lever depressed and further movmg the 
carriage (in either direction) the selected stop 
can be placed in any desired position as in-
dicated on the visible margin scale No. I 
Fig. I. When the lever is released the margin 
stop is automatically set. Before setting the 
second stop however, it is necessary to depress 
the carriage release lever No. 9 Fig. 4 and 
move the carriage away from the first margin 
stop before again using the "Quickset" margin 
lever, otherwise the first stop will again be 
picked up.

Line Spacing 
On the left-hand side of the carriage is the 
line-space lever No. 18 Fig. 4. This fulfils the 
double purpose of returning the carriage to 
the start of the writing line ( as determined by 
the setting of the left-hand margin stop) and 
of turning up the paper for another writing 
line. The operation of the line space lever can 
be adjusted to feed the paper up from one to 
three lines at a time in half-line stages. The 
distance between lines is pre-set by moving 

the line space adjusting lever No. 5 ~ig. I to 
the desired position as shown by the hne space 
indicator No. 6 Fig. 1 · 
Writing point and use 
of Scales 
The position of the vertical writing point can 
always be determined by reference to the 
writing point indicator window No. 43 Fig. 5. 
All scales on the carriage are synchronised, 
i.e. the number shown in the writing point 
window will correspond with the same number 
on the bail bar and margin scales. The horizon-
tal writing line is located immediately above 
the line indicator No. 39 Fig. 5 and the 
bottom edge of the 'capitals' aligns with the 
top edge of the line indicator. 
Writing on Lines 
Sometimes it is necessary to depart from the 
standard line spacing of the typewriter in 
order to write on a printed line that does not 
correspond with the typewriter spacing. This 
is done in one of two ways, according to 
circumstances:-
( a) Normally, by pushing in the disc No. 17 
Fig. 5 on the left platen turning knob No. 13 
Fig. I. This releases the platen from the 
ratchet wheel and the platen can then be 
turned freely to the desired point, enabling 
the operator to write on a ruled line in any 
position. When the disc is released, the platen 
IO 
once more becomes engaged with the ratchet 
and normal line-spacing is resumed from that 
point. 
( b) When previous matter has been typed 
and it is necessary to return to exact former 
line-spacing lever after having made a depart-
ure from it, the platen locating release lever 
No. ro Fig. 5 should be used. This will be 
found on the left of the carriage, and when 
pressed forward will disengage the platen-
ratchet for so long as it remains in the forward 
position. When pushed back to the normal 
position, the writing will be resumed m 
accordance with the original matter. 
Moving the Carriage 
When it is desired to move the carriage with-
out using the line space lever, steady the car-
riage with the hand and depress either of the 
two carriage release levers Nos. 8 & 9 Fig. 5. 
The carriage can then be made to move freely 
to any desired position. (N.B. When it is 
moving to the left, do not release the lever 
until the carriage is stationary.) 
To type on Cards or 
thick Envelopes 
When it is necessary to type on cards or thick 
envelopes, lever No. 42 Fig. 5 should be 
moved into position "C" as shown in the 
illustration. When typing normally or taking 
carbon copies the lever should be returned to 
position "D".

To rule Horizontal or 
Vertical Lines 
On the top edge of the Line Indicator No. 39 
Fig. 5 are two small notches. To rule horizontal 
lines place pencil point in one of these notches 
and move the carriage endways. To rule 
vertical lines, rotate platen with turning knob. 
Carriage Lock 
By adjusting the margin stops Nos. 2 & 3 Fig. 5 
to the centre of the carriage, not only is the 
carriage locked in the central position but the

"l-.:J------42 
whole of the typcbar mechanism is locked 
also. Thus, the typist is enabled to secure the 
machine against interference when not in use. 
The Keyboard 
The Imperial Model 60 is supplied with the 
Universal standard keyboard. It has the advan-
tage, however, of possessing forty-five keys, 
which give ninety characters as compared 
with the usual eighty-four. A full range of 
figures is given, including the numerals "r" 
and "o". 

Shift Keys 
To obtain a capital letter, or one of the 
characters printed uppermost on the key-tops, 
depress either of the shift-keys Nos. 27 & 28 
Fig. 6 and then strike the required key with 
the other hand. The shift-key must not be 
released until the character has been typed. 
To type a passage entirely in capitals ("upper-
case"), depress the shift-lock No. 26 Fig. 6. 
This locks the type in the "capital" position, 
and the machine will continue to write 
capitals so long as the shift remains locked. 
To return to the small (or "lower-case") 
characters, depress either of the shift-keys 
Nos. 27 & 28 Fig. 6 which releases the shift-
lock. 
Space Bar 
The space bar No. 49 Fig. 6 when depressed, 
has the effect of moving the carriage by the 
space of one letter. This bar is in front of the 
keyboard, and is used for obtaining spaces 
between words, etc. It is normally operated 
by the right or left thumb, as convenient. 
Depress the space-bar as follows:-
ONCE between words or after a comma; 
TWICE after a colon or semi-colon; 
THREE TIMES after a full-stop, query or 
exclamation. 
Back Space Key 
On the left of the keyboard there is a key 
marked "Back Space" No. 25 Fig. 6 which, 
I2 
when depressed, returns the carriage by the 
space of one letter at a time. This key is par-
ticularly useful when writing numbers in 
columns and also enables one to make a quick 
correction. 
The Warning Bell 
Just before coming to the end of each line of 
writing the bell will ring. This is to warn the 
operator that six more characters only can be 
typed on that line. After this, however, the 
I 
margin release key can be used (see next 
paragraph). The margin warning bell may be 
switched out of action if desired by moving 
the bell lever No. 62 Fig. 7. 
• 
Releasing the Margin 
Stops 
It is sometimes necessary to write a note in the 
margin. To do this, depress the margin-release 
lever No. 48 Fig. 6 at the same· time moving 
the carriage to the right, when it will run back 
past the left-hand margin-stop, thereby en- . 
abling typing to be done in the left-hand 
margin of the paper. 
Similarly, when six characters have been 
written after the warning bell rings, the type-
bars will automatically lock to prevent over-

p 
i 
l

running of the margin. By depressing the 
margin-release key typing can be continued 
to the ·end of the full writing line. 
Tou.ch ·Adjustment 
Control 
The '.J;ouch Adjustment control is on the 
right-hand side of the type~unit front plate 
No. 46 Fig. 6. It can instantly be adjusted to 
suit the finger pressure of the individual typist 
and gives a completely uniform tension on all

keys. Key tension is lightest at the No. I 
position and is increased as the control lever 
is moved through the six selective positions. 
Dead Key 
When correspondence in foreign languages is

are carried on so-called "dead-keys". The 
carriaae remains stationary ·when these keys

are struck; thus, the required accent is typed 
first and the letter afterwards. 

SETTING AND USING THE TABULATOR 
General 
The tabulator is a device which enables the 
carriao·e to be brought rapidly and auto-
matic~lly to any desired point or points with-
out usino- the space bar or carriage release 
lever. F~ this purpose a tabulator 'stop' is 
provided for each writing space, the stops 
themselves being accommodated on the 
tabulator stop rod inside the carriage. Two 
types of inbuilt tabulator, the Unit Model 
and the 10-key Decimal Model are available 
with the Model 60. Both types are described 
in the following pages. 
The Unit Model 
Setting the Stops 
As an example, it is assumed that the tabulator 
is required for writing some columns of names. 
First determine the point on your paper at 
which each column commences and note its 
number on the front scale pointers for future 
reference. To set the stop at that point depress 
the tabulator setting key No. 45 Fig. 6. R epeat 
for every stop position required. 
Using the Tabulator 
Having set a stop for each column, move the 
carriage to commencement of line (i.e. left 
margin stop). Press down the tabulator bar 
No. 47 Fig. 6 when the carriage will immedi-
ate:y travel to, and halt at, the first column. 
DO NOT RELEASE THE TABULATOR BAR UNTIL 
THE CARRIAGE HAS STOPPED. Type the required 
entries and press the tabulator bar again. The 
carriage will again move to the next colurn 
and so on. In this way column entries fall int 
accurate register right down the page. 
0 
The Decimal Model 
Instead of the tabulator bar this model has an 
additional row of ro operating keys as shown 
in Fig. 8. 
Words 
When tabulating columns of words, the 
theory of operation is the same as that des-
cribed under the last heading ("The Unit 
Model"), except that you will use the first 
( or left-hand) key on the extra top row instead 
of the usual tabulator bar. The result will be 
the same ; the carriage will halt at every point 
where a stop has been set. 
14 
Figures 
When tabulating numerals, set a tabulator stop 
at the point where the last figure in your 
column is to be written, and press the proper 
keys once only. It is then possible to write any 
quantity from 1-99,999,999. Since the 
"comma" is often used when writing numbers 
in excess of 999 it should be understood that on 
the Imperial Decimal Tabulator the additional 
space required by the comma is included when 
you press the proper key. Commas are allowed 
for when writing the following:-

Money 
When tabulating money columns determine 
the _position of the unit in the pence column, 
settmg tabulator stop at that point. Then press 
the proper tabulator key. 
To write any amount from rd. to 
£9,999 19s. ud. press the proper tabulator 
keys once only. One stop will be sufficient 
for ~ach column of figures providing the

After this, the whole machine

This brushing and dusting 
should be done before com-

in addition to which, the type 
should be cleaned additionally 
as often as required, and 
always before and after cut-
ting a stencil. "Imperitype" 
ribbons, however, tend to re-
duce type-clogging, and with 
their use the type remains clean 
for a much longer period.

Clearing the Stops 
The following instructions apply to both 
models. When any particular stop-combina-
tion is finished with, it is cleared by pushing 
backwards the tabulator stop clearing lever 
No. 60 Fig. 7 when all stops are returned to 
normal together, ready for the next setting. 
Should it be necessary to clear individual stops 
this can be done without unsetting the whole 
by pressing tabulator bar or key until the 
carriage comes to rest at the particular stop 
it is desired to clear. Now press the individual 
tabulator stop clearing lever No. 61 Fig. 7 
and the selected stop will return to its dis-
engaged position. 
Automatic Brake 
Uniformity in the speed of travel of the car-
riage between one stop position and another is 
ensured by the fitting ofa centrifugal brake. This 
brake also provides against any possible varia-
tion when carriages of different lengths are used. 
Cleaning the Machine 
To clean the type, draw type-unit forward 
(s:e page 18) and with the special brush pro-
vided, brush the type with a sideways motion. 
16 
Oiling the Machine 
If the typewriter is kept well dusted it will not 
need much oil, especially if it is in constant 
use. More machines are ruined by the use of 
too much oil than by the lack of it. 
Use only the oil which we provide, for it 
is the best procurable and any other is apt to 
"gum" after a time and thereby hamper the 
work of the machine. 
All working parts should have a drop of oil 
occasionally. Never oil the typebars. 
Every Imperial typewriter is guaranteed, but 
the manufacturers do· not take any responsi-
bility if the machine gets out of order through 
carelessness, or if the screws or any other parts 
of the machine are wrongly turned, or if any 
mechanic not sent out by the manufacturers 
or their agents undertakes a repair. 
Covering the Machine 
Prevention is better than cure-and to prevent 
dust from getting into the machine, use the 
dust-cover or the metal cover, as the case may 
be, when the machine is not in use. Dust, 
especially when allied with over-oiling, spells 
ruin to any delicate machinery.

THE IMPERIAL· FEATURE OF "INTERCHANGEABILITY" 
We don't like the word "interchangeability". 
It is long and clumsy, but it's the only one 
which can rightly describe a most important 
feature of our Model 60 typewriter. Briefly 
FRAME 
the Model 60 is built on the principle of unit 
construction so that the type-unit (keyboard 
section), the carriage and the platen roller can 
all be quickly changed without using any 
TYPE-UNIT 
tools. In planning the Model 60 on these lines 
our designers have provided a flexibility of 
operation that only Imperial can give. 
Our illustrations show the four component 
parts. Firstly, there is the FRAME SECTION. 
Into this fits the TYPE-UNIT, which slides 
into its correct position like a drawer. Type-
units fitted with different type styles covering 
CARRIAGE 
nearly every written language can be supplied. 
The CARRIAGE is now fitted into position 
and is available in five different widths, from 
12" to 26". The PLATEN ROLLER fits into 
17 
PLATEN 
the carriage and is supplied in varying degrees 
of hardness. 
The combination of these features is ex-
clusive to Imperial and enables greater s~rvice 
to be obtained from one machine. With an 

extra type-unit for a different language or an 
additional longer carriage for special work one 
Imperial will do the work of many type-
writers. Another point, it is a simple matter 
for the machine to be kept thoroughly clean, 
an important factor in the life of a typewriter 
and the quality of the work it produces. 
The .Type-unit 
To remove the type-unit, press type-unit 
release levers Nos. 23 & 24 Fig. I in the front-
plate of the machine, with the right and left 
thumbs. The type-unit is now free in the 
machine, and can be drawn forward by 
placing the first finger of each hand behind the 
back spacer key No. 25 Fig. I and the margin 
release No. 48 Fig. I respectively. When 
drawn out to its full extent, the type-unit 
should be lifted slightly forward and tilted, 
when it can be lifted clear of the machine. 
Take care not to scratch the enamel on the 
front of the frame with the base of the type-
unit. Do NOT TRY TO REMOVE TYPE-UNIT 
WHEN THE HINGED RIBBON COVER IS IN THE 
RAISED POSITION OR WHILE THE SIIlFT-KEY IS 
LOCKED. When the type-unit is withdrawn, 
all parts are accessible for cleaning and oiling. 
To replace the type-unit, tilt it into the 
machine until it slides freely upon i!s runners 
Nos. 29 & 30 Fig. I and then push it back with 
the thumbs, when it will automatically lock 
itself in position. 
The Carriage 
To remove the carriage from the machine 
first move the carriage along to the full extent 
of its right-hand traverse, lift the draw-band 
18 
lever No. 54 Fig. 2 with the right-hand and 
while doing so move the carriage by means of 
the carriage release lever No. 8 Fig. 2 to 
the full extent of its left-hand traverse. It will 
now be found that the carriage drawband 
No. 53 Fig. 2 has automatically been detached. 
Take hold of the ends of the carriage with 
both hands and with the forefingers press the 
carriage clamping wedges Nos. 15, & 16 Fig. 7 
on either side. The complete carriage can now 
be lifted vertically from the machine. Instruc-
tions for replacing the carriage will be found 
o~ page 4 under the heading "Unpacking". 
The Platen 
To remove the platen, first move the carriage 
a little to the left and life the bail bar No. 38 
Fig. I to its full extent. Hold the right 
platen-turning knob No. 14 Fig. I with the 
right-hand, and the left platen-turning knob 
No. 13 Fig. I with the left-hand. Pull forward 
platen clamping lever No. 12 Fig. 2 with the 
right thumb and lever No. II Fig. 2 with the 
left thumb. The platen can now be lifted clear 
but it is advisable to keep the right-hand side 
of the platen a little higher than the left as 
this facilitates withdrawal from underneath the 
line space lever. 
To replace the platen, reverse the above 
instructions, taking special care to see that the 
grooves on the platen spindles fall into the 
slots on the carriage-ends. 
The above instructions for dismounting the 
machine, while apparently involved, are 
actually simple. After a little practice in the 
manipulation of the various units the different 
movements are made swiftly and freely.
