'Ht moi, ..., si favait III comment en revenir,

The series is divergent; therefore we may be
able to do something with it.
O. Heaviside
One service mathematics has rendered
the
human race. It has put common sense back
where it belongs, on the topmost shelf next
to the dusty canister labelled 'discarded non-
sense'.
Eric T. Bell
Mathematics is a tool for thought. A highly necessary tool in a world where both feedback and non-
linearities abound. Similarly, all kinds of parts of mathematics serve as tools for other parts and for
other sciences.
Applying a simple rewriting rule to the quote on the right above one finds such statements as:
'One service topology has rendered mathematical physics ...'; 'One service logic has rendered com-
puter science ...'; 'One service category theory has rendered mathematics ...', All arguably true. And
all statements obtainable this way form part of the raison d'etre of this series.
This series, Mathematics and Its Applications, started in 1977. Now that over one hundred
volumes have appeared it seems opportune to reexamine its scope. At the time I wrote
"Growing specialization and diversification have brought a host of monographs and
textbooks on increasingly specialized topics.
However, the 'tree' of knowledge of
mathematics and related fields does not grow only by putting forth new branches. It
also happens, quite often in fact, that branches which were thought to be completely
disparate are suddenly seen to be related. Further, the kind and level of sophistication
of mathematics applied in various sciences has changed drastically in recent years:
measure theory is used (non-trivially) in regional and theoretical economics; algebraic
geometry interacts with physics; the Minkowsky lemma, coding theory and the structure
of water meet one another in packing and covering theory; quantum fields, crystal
defects and mathematical programming profit from homotopy theory; Lie algebras are
relevant to filtering; and prediction and electrical engineering can use Stein spaces. And
in addition
to this there are such new emerging subdisciplines as 'experimental
mathematics', 'CFD', 'completely integrable systems', 'chaos, synergetics and large-scale
order', which are almost impossible to fit into the existing classification schemes. They
draw upon widely different sections of mathematics."
By and large, all this still applies today. It is still true that at first sight mathematics seems rather
fragmented and that to find, see, and exploit the deeper underlying interrelations more effort is
needed and so are books that can help mathematicians and scientists do so. Accordingly MIA will
continue to try to make such books available.
If anything, the description I gave in 1977 is now an understatement. To the examples of
interaction areas one should add string theory where Riemann surfaces, algebraic geometry, modu-
lar functions, knots, quantum field theory, Kac-Moody algebras, monstrous moonshine (and more)
all come together. And to the examples of things which can be usefully applied let me add the topic
'finite geometry'; a combination of words which sounds like it might not even exist, let alone be
applicable. And yet it is being applied: to statistics via designs, to radar/sonar detection arrays (via
finite projective planes), and to bus connections of VLSI chips (via difference sets). There seems to
be no part of (so-called pure) mathematics that is not in immediate danger of being applied. And,
accordingly, the applied mathematician needs to be aware of much more. Besides analysis and
numerics, the traditional workhorses, he may need all kinds of combinatorics, algebra, probability,
and so on.
In addition, the applied scientist needs to cope increasingly with the nonlinear world and the

vi

extra mathematical sophistication that this requires. For that is where the rewards are. Linear
models are honest and a bit sad and depressing: proportional efforts and results. It is in the non-
linear world that infinitesimal inputs may result in macroscopic outputs (or vice versa). To appreci-
ate what I am hinting at: if electronics were linear we would have no fun with transistors and com-
puters; we would have no TV; in fact you would not be reading these lines.
There is also no safety in ignoring such outlandish things as nonstandard analysis, superspace
and anticommuting integration, p-adic and ultrametric space. All three have applications in both
electrical engineering and physics. Once, complex numbers were equally outlandish, but they fre-
quently proved the shortest path between 'real' results. Similarly, the first two topics named have
already provided a number of 'wormhole' paths. There is no telling where all this is leading -
fortunately.
Thus the original scope of the series, which for various (sound) reasons now comprises five sub-
series: white (Japan), yellow (China), red (USSR), blue (Eastern Europe), and green (everything
else), still applies. It has been enlarged a bit to include books treating of the tools from one subdis-
cipline which are used in others. Thus the seriesstill aims at books dealing with:
- a central concept which plays an important role in several different mathematical and/ or
scientificspecialization areas;
- new applications of the results and ideas from one area of scientific endeavour into another;
- influences which the results, problems and concepts of one field of enquiry have, and have had,
on the development ofanother.
Spinors are important in theoretical physics, specifically in quantum theory. Usually one finds the
word at least once in the table of contents of, say, the Journal of Mathematical Physics, or Letters
of Mathematical Physics. In addition they have an important (and far from unrelated) role to play
in differential geometry and topology. Even so, the concept of a spinor, and the word, tend to be
used somewhat loosely (and inaccurately), possibly due, until the present volume, to the lack of a
precise, thorough, and accessible, book on the topic.
Mathematically, spinors are (the elements 00 a representation space of a Clifford algebra, them-
selves also objects of considerable current interest, and that is the point of view, originally due to
Chevalley (1954), that is taken in this book, that is both rigorous enough for mathematicians and
concrete enough for physicists.

Introduetion.
This book has been conceived as a treatise on the theory of Clifford algebras and
spinors, from the viewpoint of applications to differential geometry and mathematical
physics, which would be both elementary and as complete as possible.
These algebras, sometimes called 'geometric' because of their relation to orthogo-
nal transformations, were discovered by W. K. Clifford in 1878, as a generalization of
W. R. Hamilton's quaternions (1858). A whole school of researchers now use them
to generalize the theory of functions of a complex variable : this is the 'Clifford
analysis', which will not be considered in this book 1.
In the literature, the notion of 'spinor' has remained very ambiguous. Its origins
lie in the work of E. Cartan on group representation (1913), but it was given its
current name only in 1930, after the discovery of spin by Pauli and Dirac.
And
only in 1935-38 were the Clifford algebras used by R. Brauer, H. Weyl and-again-
E. Cartan to construct spinors.
For many years, the book 'Lecons sur la theorie
des spineurs' was the standard reference for a whole school of theorists. The clear
and rigorous definition of the spinors as irreducible representation spaces for Clifford
algebras-which holds in all dimensions, all signatures and all characteristics-was
given by Chevalley in 1954. In spite of its depth and rigor, Chevalley's book proved
too abstract for most physicists and the notions explained in it have not been applied
much until recently, which is a pity. In a parallel way, the notion of spinor structure,
derived by A. Haefliger (1956) from the work of Ch. Ehresmann was successfully
applied by A. Lichnerowicz to field theory (1964) and by many authors in alge-
braic topology to differential geometry and to the theory of fiber bundles; without,
surprisingly, relying on the resources of Clifford algebras and their representations.
Today, very few mathematicians and physicists have a sound knowledge of spinor
theory.
Spinors are used in field theory with such abuses of linear algebra that
they are no longer useful for the study of global problems. Often, authors consider
only one given dimension and signature, using special methods which cannot be
applied to the general case. The term 'spinor' itself is not always clear, and a 'spin
representation' might either be a true representation or a covering, depending on the
author. Some authors ignore the modern definition of spinors as elements of minimal
left (or right) ideals of a Clifford algebra; if it is used, the algebra representations
are sometimes insufficiently distinguished from the representations of the associated

groups, which appear in the theory of fiber bundles : the consistency may be greatly
compromised by such confusions.
We think that many researchers would like to have a systematic treatise offering
the detailed exposition of these notions, which have become indispensable both in
geometry and in quantum mechanics.
This book is equally meant for mathematicians, being rigorous, and for physi-
cists, being concrete. Starting from a relatively elementary level (corresponding to
the third year at university), we recall the main results from orthogonal and symplec-
tic geometry-we will explain later why the symplectic case is included here-and
some notions on tensor, exterior and symmetric algebras; the advanced reader may
browse the first two chapters, noticing the influence of E. Artin, and find the main
definitions and results on the Clifford algebras and their associated groups in Chap-
ters 3 and 4. Chapter 5 is of central importance : we recall some basic facts on the
representations of semi-simple algebras which explain the notion of spin representa-
tion; some properties of primitive idempotents and minimal left ideals are given, but
we concentrate on the complex case, which is the most important one for physics,
and introduce the essential notion of isotropic r-vector, which will prove fundamen-
tal for the sequel. Chapter 6 assumes that the reader is somewhat familiar with the
classical Lie groups. Next, in Chapter 7, we give a survey of matrix methods and
link our approach with an old but very widely used method. Chapters 8 and 9 are
concerned with the spinors in maximal index. In these two chapters, we are closest
to Chevalley's methods, but, since we are not interested in the exceptional character-
istics, our methods are, we think, simpler and more concrete. The first part, which
has the tools needed further on by the reader (researcher or student), ends there :
the other part requires a thorough knowledge of Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 8.
Chapter 10 is one of the most important for applications to physics. It offers a new
approach to 'charge conjugation' and its related notions (Majorana spinors), and has
new and exhaustive results. Chapter 11 is short, but essential for the understanding
of the cohomological methods; it contains the definition of new groups introduced
by the author around 1970, as 'groupes de spinorialite'. Chapters 12 and 13 offer
a new approach to problems which have been tackled by many different methods
in recent publications : the twistors, reduced to the rank of spinors, appear in the
setting of conformal geometry, and certain graded Lie algebras and supersymmetries
are related to a generalized triality principle or, if one prefers, to an extension of the
well-known Hurwitz problem. Chapters 14 and 15 form, along with Chapter 16 (an
applications chapter for physicists), an essential part of this book, concerned with the
differential geometry of spinor fields. We use an original approach to the problem of
spin fibration, which relies on the algebraic setting of Chapters 5 and 8 and explains
the spinor frames which, often, seem to appear from nowhere; the existence of spinor
structures is that of pseudo-fields of isotropic r-vectors, an essentially geometric
notion which can serve as an algorithmic tool for applications. Spheres and projective
spaces are given as examples and are, for the first time, solved using elementary

methods.
This formalism is applied in Chapters 15 and 16, where the principal operators
of quantum mechanics are given, both in the local and in the global setting.
Chapters 17, 18 and 19 form a separate entity, only depending on Chapter 1.
We define the deformations of the algebras associated to a symplectic manifold and
geometrize the Maslov index. By analogy with the orthogonal case, we introduce
'symplectic Clifford algebras' which, generalizing the so-called Weyl algebras, have
a similar role, in the symplectic case, to that of the ordinary Clifford algebras in the
orthogonal case. We construct 'spinoplectic' groups (analogous to the spin groups)
and symplectic spinor bundles, using a procedure which is identical to that in Chapter
14. The three-sided index and the Maslov index are defined geometrically and we
show that the deformation problem can be solved in this way, our symplectic Clifford
product being a generalization of the Moyal product.
The book ends with a few articles. One of them is concerned with idempotent
fibrations in the Clifford algebra of a manifold, a problem which has proved very
interesting in the past few years. We introduce the notion of amorphic spinor bundle,
explain how it differs from that defined in Chapter 15 and warn against possible
confusions and unwarranted identifications.
The second article presents the so-called Penrose transform in a purely spinorial
setting (no twistors are used), and defines instantons.
Finally, the third article describes the geometrization of the Fourier transform,
acting on the fields of symplectic spinors.
We think that these articles are very significant for the philosophy and the spirit
of this work, and therefore thought it useful to include them, even though this further
increases its size.
The author wishes to express his gratitude towards Y. Panabiere for the careful
typing of the main part of the manuscript.
He warmly thanks all his colleagues who have encouraged and helped him for the
writing and the publication of this book.

Background on bilinear forms.
1.1.1
The vector spaces under consideration will generally be of finite dimension over the
real number field R or over the complex number field C ; we write K for either R or
C when reasonings and results are true for both.
Let E and F be vector spaces of dimension nand p respectively and let B be a
bilinear form :
B
:
( x , y ) E E x F ~ B ( x , y ) E K ,
we will write
'"Yx
: Y ~ B(x,y),
where x is fixed,
by : x ~ B(x, y),
where y is fixed.
for its partial functions. Let (ei), i = 1, ... ,n and (h), j = 1, ... , p be bases for E
and F respectively, then we put
B(ei' h) = aij
and the matrix (aij) will be denoted by a.
If we change the bases :

it will be for the rest of this book, we know that

CHAPTER 1
1.1.2
The rank of a bilinear form.
Let E" and F" be the dual spaces of E and F respectively. Define mappings
"f : z -+ "f:r:,
6 : y -+ 611 ,
"f : E -+ F",
6 : F -+ E".
The kernel of 6 is a subspace E' of F called the conjugate of E in F, i.e. :
E' ~ F, and ify E E', B(x,y) = 0
Vx E E.
We define the conjugate F' of F in E in a similar way :
F' ~ E, and if x E F', B(x, y) = 0
Vy E F.
B is said to be non-degenerate if E' = F' = {O}, and degenerate otherwise.
If E' = F' = {O}, "f and 6 are injective and clearly n ::::; p and p ::::; n so n = p.
Otherwise, we write ElF' for the quotient space of E by F' (i.e. the set of classes
modulo F' of elements in E) . FIE' is defined analogously, and we have the following
proposition :
Proposition 1.1.1 ElF' and FIE' have the same dimension.
This dimension is
called the rank of B (or rk(B) for short).
Proof. B(x, y) = B(x, yt} if y -
Yl E E' and B(x, y) = B(Xl' yt} if z = Xl (mod F' )
and y = Yl (mod E'). Setting
x = Cl(x) (mod F'),
y = Cl(y) (mod E'),
we get
B(x,y) = B(x,y),
where B is bilinear on ElF' X FIE' and 13(x,y) = 0, Vx E ElF' is equivalent to
B(x,y) = 0, Vx E E, so Y E E', and y = O. Similarly B(x,fj) = 0, Vfj E FIE' is
equivalent to x = O. Hence 13 is non-degenerate and dimEIF' = dim FIE'.
I
Note that if (<pi) and (fi) are the dual bases of (I;) and (ei) respectively, "f(ei) =
o.ii<pi and 6(1;) = o.iifi since "fei(Y) = B(ei'y) = o.iiyi = o.ii<pi(y). "t being the
transpose of 6, both matrices have equal rank, which also proves Proposition (1.1.1) :
if this rank is r ,
r = dim"f(E) = dim ElF' = dim6(F) = dim FIE'.
We will remember that r is the common rank of "t and 6 and that it is equal to the
rank of the matrix 0..

The dimension of conjugate subspaces.

Given that the rank of B is r , we know that a matrix ex.' can be found such that it
is equivalent to a and has zero entries except for aii = 1 when i = 1, . .. ,r.
1. If B is non-degenerate we can consider bases for which the matrix of B has the
reduced form we just indicated; then
n
B(x,y) = I>iyi.
i=l
This is the classical situation of duality. Hence
Proposition 1.1.2 Let B be non-degenerate, let V be a subspace of E and
V' its conjugate in F, then
dim V + dim V' = n
(2)
where n = dim E = dim F . Furthermore, if V" is the conjugate of V' in E I
V"=V.
2. If B is degenerate and if dimE = dimF = n, rk(B) = r
dim V + dim V' 2:: n .
(3)
Indeed, V' = V'IE' ~ FIE', V = VIF' ~ ElF'. Also iJ is non-degenerate
and y E (V)' implies y E V', hence
dim V + dim(V)' = r,
dim V +dim V' 2:: r,
dim V + dim V' - dim E' 2:: r,
dim V + dim V' - dimE' 2:: dimF - dimE',
dim V + dim V' 2:: n .

Definitions.
1. If E = F, the determinant of a
is called the discriminan t of B for the basis
(ei) ' As a' = ATaA if ei' = Atek,
det a' = det a(det A?
(4)
In this special case, E' is called the right conjugate of E and F' is called its
left conjugate.

CHAPTER 1
2. Let E and F be two vector spaces over K with bilinear forms Band C . An
isomorphism a : E -t F is said to be an isometry iff
B(x,y) = C(ax,ay),
Vx,y E E .
(5)
If E = F and B = C, the set of isometries is a group.
Note that if B is non-degenerate and if ax = 0, then C(ax, ay) = 0, Vy E E
and (5) implies that B(x,y) = 0, so z is an element of the left conjugate of E,
hence z = 0 and a is injective. Also, if a : E -t F is an isometry,
B(ei, ej) = Ctij = B(aei, aej) = Cti',j'
where ei' = a e., so from (4) it follows that (det a)2 = 1. The isometries for
which det a = 1 are called rotations and these for which det a = -1 are called
reversions The set of rotations is a normal subgroup of the group of isometries
and its index is at most 2. a -t det a is a homomorphism whose kernel is the
group of rotations. In certain cases, all isometries are rotations.
1.1.5
The two fundamental geometries.
Assume E = F. It is especially interesting to consider choices of B for which E' = F',
so that left and right conjugates coincide. This is the case if for all (x, y) E E x E ,
B(x,y) = 0 is equivalent to B(y,x) = 0, which clearly holds if B is symmetric or
antisymmetric. Now we prove the converse :
Proposition 1.1.3 Iffor all (x, y) E Ex E, B(x, y) = 0 is equivalent to B(y, x) = 0,
then B must either be symmetric or antisymmetric.
Proof. If x , y, z E E we have
B(x, B(x, z)y) - B(x,B(x,y)z)
B(x, y)B(x, z) - B(x, z)B(x,y)
O.
But B(x,B(x, z)y - B(x ,y)z) = 0 is equivalent to B(B(x, z)y - B(x, y)z, x) = 0 and
we obtain :
B(x,z)B(y, x) - B(x, y)B(z, x) = O.
(6)
For x = z, B(x,x)B(y,x) = B(x,x)B(x,y). If B(x,y) =J. B(y,x), B(x, x) = 0 and,
similarly, B(y,y) = O. Assume now that for some (x,y) E Ex E, B(x,y) =J. B(y,x),
then B(z,z) = 0, Vz E E. Indeed :
1. If B(x,z) =J. B(z ,x), the previous reasoning leads to B(z,z) = 0 if we replace
y by z.
2. If B(x,z) = B(z,x), then by (6) and because B(y,x) =J. B(x,y), B(x,z) =
B(z,x)=O.

ORTHOGONAL AND SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRIES.
5
We may assume that B(y , z) = B(z, y), otherwise we reobtain case 1 for y. Replacing
z by yin 2, B(y,z) = B(z,y) = 0, hence
B(x + z,y) = B(x,y) =I B(y,x) = B(y,x + z)
and if we replace z by z + z and x by y in 1, we see that
B(x+z,x+z)=O.
But from B(x, x) = 0 (since B(x, y) =I B(y, x) and B(x, z) = B(z, x) = 0), B(z, z) =
O.
Clearly there are only two cases to consider : either B(x,x) = 0, '<Ix E E, or
for some z E E, B(z,z) =I 0 and then B(x,y) = B(y,x), '<Ix,y E E since if for
x,y E E, B(x,y) =I B(y,x), B(z,z) = 0 would follow by the previous reasoning. If
B(x, x) = 0, '<Ix E E , replacing z by x +y, we have that B(x, y) = -B(y, x) . If for
some z E E, B(z,z) =I 0, B(x,y) = B(y,x).
I
If B is symmetric the geometry is called orthogonal. If B is antisymmetric, the
geometry is called symplectic. No other case can occur if left and right conjugates
are to coincide. From now on E = F is assumed, unless stated otherwise.
1.2
Common properties of the orthogonal and the symplectic geome-
tries.
Let B be a bilinear form on E x E which is either symmetric or antisymmetric. The
left and right conjugates of V are now called orthogonal to V and VI will be written
V.L. In the orthogonal case, B(x,x) is written Q(x) for short.
1.2.1
The radical.
Definition 1.2.1 The set ofx E E for which B(x,y) = 0, '<Iy E E, is a subspace of
E called its radical and denoted by rad E or E.L .
Clearly rad E = 0 if B is non-degenerate, E is then said to be non-isotropic. Let U
be a subspace of E such that the restriction Blu of B to U induces a geometry of
the same type (orthogonal or symplectic) as the geometry on E.
Definition 1.2.2 The radical rad U of U is defined as un U.L .
Note that although rad E = E.L, rad U =I U.L in general. U is said to be isotropic if
radU =I O.
Definition 1.2.3 If E = E 1 EEl E2 EEl .. . EEl E; where the sums are direct and the E;
are pairwise orthogonal spaces (for B), we say that E is the direct orthogonal sum
of the E; and write

Here two subspaces Ei , Ej are orthogonal if
CHAPTER 1
B(x,y) = 0,
Vx E Ei'
Vy E Ej .
Lemma 1.2.1 If E = E1 + E2 + ...+ E; where the sum is not necessarily direct,
but the E; are pairwise orthogonal, then
rad E = rad E1 + rad E2 + .. . + rad Er •
(1)
Proof. It is sufficient to note that if x = E~=l Xi, Xi E Ei, and if X E rad E, B(x, Yi) =
0, VYi E Ei, so B(Xi' Yi) = °and Xi E rad Ei.
Conversely if every Xi E rad Ei,
Ei=l B(Xi,Yi) =°and B(x,y) = 0, Vy E B, so X E rad E.
I
Corollary 1.2.1 If each B, is non-degenerate, B is non-degenerate.
Proof. Trivial.
I
Lemma 1.2.2 There exists a U ~ E such that E = rad E 1. U and Blu is non-
degenerate.
Proof. If we set E = E1. EEl U, the sum is orthogonal :
E = E1. 1. U = rad E 1. U.
But by Lemma (1.2.1),
rad E = rad(rad E) 1. rad U = rad E 1. rad U
since rad(rad E) = rad EnE = rad E. Hence rad U = 0 and Blu is non-degenerate. I
Proposition 1.2.1 Let E be a non-isotropic space and let U be one ofits subspaces ,
then
1. Ul..J.. = U, dim U +dim U1. = dim E,
2. rad U = rad U1. = U n U1. ,
3. U is non-isotropic if and only if U1. is non-isotropic,
4. For non-isotropic U, E = U 1. U1. ,
5. If E = U 1. W, U and W are non-isotropic and W = U1. .
Proof. By formula (2) of (1.1.3) we have
dim U + dim U1. = dim E.
That U ~ (U1.)1. is obvious; if dimU = p and dim E = n , dim U1. = n-p and (U1.)1.
has dimension p, so (1) is proved. radU = Un U1., radU1. = U1. n U1.1. = Un U1. .
If U is non-isotropic, rad U = 0, hence U1. is non-isotropic and the converse holds
too.
U + U1. being a direct sum, U 1. U1. = E. If E
= U 1. W, W
~ U1. ,
dim W = n - dim U = dim U1., so W = U1., U n U1. = 0 = rad U.

Definition 1.2.4 E is said to be totally isotropic if B == 0 on E . A subspace U ~ E
is said to be totally isotropic if Blu == O.
Both {O} and EJ. are totally isotropic. A vector x E E is called isotropic if B(x ,x) =
O. (Generally, when we say that some vector is isotropic, we will also mean that it
is non-zero.)
Lemma 1.2.3 If, in an orthogonal geometry, the subspace U
~ E is such that
B(x,x) = 0, Vx E U, then U is totally isotropic.
Proof. B(x + y,x + y) = 0 implies 2B(x,y) = 0 and hence B(x,y) = O.
In this case, the geometry defined on U by B is also symplectic.
I
1.2.2
Decomposition in lines and in hyperbolic planes.
Let U be a two-dimensional non- isotropic subspace of E, containing an isotropic
vector x:l O. Let y E E, y:l Ax so (x,y) = U.
We try to find an isotropic vector z E U for which B(z , z) = 1. Setting z =
ax + f3y,
B(x,z) = f3B(x,y).
Now x tt radU and there exists a y for which B(x,y):I 0, U being non-isotropic,
hence f3 is uniquely defined by B(x,z) = 1. In the symplectic case , B(z,z) = O. In
the orthogonal case , to have B(z, z) = 0 requires
B(ax + f3Y' ax + f3y) = 0,
i.e.
2af3B(x, y) + f32 B(y,y) = O.
As f3B(z , y) :I 0, a can be determined and z follows. If we change the notations we
have that
U = (x,y),
B(x,x) = B(y,y) = 0,
B(x,y) = 1.
(2)
Conversely if dim U = 2 and if (2) holds, let U E rad U, where u = ax + f3Y' then
B(u, y) = 0 implies a = 0,
B(x, u) = 0 implies f3 = 0,
so U must be non-isotropic. In the orthogonal case the vectors collinear with x or y
are the only isotropic vectors, since B(u,u) = 0 implies af3 = O.
Definition 1.2.5 A non -isotropic plane that contains a non-zero isotropic vector is
called hyperbolic. An orthogonal sum of hyperbolic planes PI, P2 , .•• , P; is said to
be a hyperbolic space H2r :

8
CHAPTER 1
By Lemma (1.2.1), H2r must be non-isotropic. The previous results lead to :
Proposition 1.2.2 A hyperbolic plane is generated by a pair (x, y) for which
B(x, x) = B(y, y) = 0
and
B(x,y)=1.
Such a pair (x, y) is called hyperbolic.
Definition 1.2.6 E is said to be irreducible if it cannot be decomposed as an or-
thogonal sum of proper subspaces.
As E = E1. 1. U an irreducible space must be non-isotropic (E1. = 0) or totally iso-
tropic (E1. = E), but in the latter case its dimension must be 1. (Any decomposition
of a totally isotropic space as a direct sum being orthogonal.)
If E is non-isotropic,
• if the geometry is orthogonal: by Lemma (1.2.3), E contains a non-zero non-
isotropic vector x, (x) is a non-isotropic space, rad(x) = 0 and x 1. (x)1. = E
implies dim E = 1.
• if the geometry is symplectic : let x =P 0, x E E, rad E being 0, there is an a
for which B(x,a) =P o. (x,a) is a non-isotropic plane U (Blu is represented by
a matrix of rank 2). E = U 1. U1. so U1. = 0 and E = U, dimE = 2.
We have proved :
Proposition 1.2.3
• If the geometry is orthogonal, the space E is a direct orthogonal sum of lines:
{aI, a2, .. . ,an} is an orthogonal basis of E and none of the ai is isotropic if
and only if E is non-isotropic.
• If the geometry is symplectic and if B is non-degenerate, E is the direct ortho-
gonal sum of hyperbolic planes, E is a hyperbolic space and dim(E) is even.
If B is degenerate, a totally isotropic space must be added to the orthogonal
sum of hyperbolic spaces.
Proposition 1.2.4 Let the (Xi, Yi) be hyperbolic pairs, if

is a hyperbolic space, if a is an isometry from E to itself, and if a fixes each of the
x., then a is a rotation and
a(x.) = Xi,
a(y.) = a{x; + Y"
where the matrix ((aj)) is symmetric in the symplectic case and antisymmetric in
the orthogonal case.
Proof.
a(Yi) = a{x; + b{Yi>
B(a(xi),a(y.)) = B(x.,y.)
and
B(a(Yi),a(y;)) = B(y.,y;)
immediately lead to these conditions.
I
Definition 1.2.7 An isometry a of a non-isotropic space is called an involution if
a 2 = Id.
Proposition 1.2.5 Every involution has the form - Idu + Idv where E = U ..1 V .
(Here U and V are non-isotropic, and one of them may be 0 if a = Id or a = - Id).
Proof. If a 2 = Id,
B(a(x),a(y)) = B(x,y),
B(a(x),y) = B(x,a(y)),
B(a(x) - X, a(y) +y) = o.
U = (a-Id)E and V = (a+Id)E are orthogonal subspaces; a(a(x)-x) = -a(x)+x,
a(a(y) + y) = a(y) + y so Un V = O. Any vector X E E equals
-Ha(x) - x) + Ha(x) + x)
so E = U ..1 V and a = -Idu+Idv.
From this proposition we deduce that if p = dim U :
det a = (-l)P.
If U is non-isotropic, p is even in the symplectic case.
I
Proposition 1.2.6 If U is non-isotropic and if a : E -+ E is an isometry fixing all
lines of E, then a = ± IdE.
Proof. Let (x) be the space generated by x E E, where x I:- o.
a(x) = ax,
Vy E (x),
a(y) = a(bx) = ba(x) = abx = ay.

10
The coefficient a is independent of x since if (x,y) has dimension 2,
a(x+y) = c(x +y),
a( x + y) = ax + by,
hence a = b= c. Choosing x,y for which B(x,y) # 0,
B(x,y) = B(a(x),a(y)) = a2B(x,y),
so a2 = 1.

Witt decomposition and the Witt theorem.
CHAPTER 1
I
Let B be non-degenerate, i.e. E is non-isotropic, let U be a subspace of E, then by
the result in (1.2.1), U = rad U ..1 Wand W is non-isotropic. Let (el, e2, .. . , er ) be
a basis of rad U, el, e2, . .. , er being isotropic vectors.
Proposition 1.2.7 There are isotropic vectors iI, h ,...,ir E E such that every
(e., i.) is a hyperbolic pair, all planes P; =
(e., i.) are pairwise orthogonal and
PI ..1 P2 ..1 .. . ..1 Pr ..1 W is a non -isotropic space containing U.
Proof. For T = 0 there is nothing to prove.
We use induction on T. Let U = (el' e2, . . . ,er ) ..1 W be assumed and let Uo =
(el,e2' . . . ,er-l) ..1 W , e, E ut. ut contains a vector a for which B(er,a) # 0,
otherwise e, would be orthogonal to ut, implying that e, E ut n utl. = rad ut =
Uonut; (er , a) is a non-isotropic subspace of ut, generated by some hyperbolic pair
(er,ir). Let us define P; = (er,ir). P; ~ ut implies U« ~ P; I P; is non-isotropic,
just as Pr is. The radical of Uo, Uonut, has dimension T - 1, Uo = rad Uo ..1 W . By
the induction hypothesis for P;, there are hyperbolic (e.,i.) in P; for 1 ::; i ::; T -

Proposition 1.2.8 (Witt decomposition.)
Let U be a maximal totally isotropic
subspace ('m.t.i .s.' for short) where U = (el' e2, .. . , er ) . Then there exist isotropic
vectors (II, h ,... ,ir) such that the (e.,i.) are hyperbolic pairs, U' = (Il,!2, .. . ,ir)
is totally isotropic and
E = U EB U' ..1 G
where G = (U EB U')l. . In the orthogonal case, if z E G, Q(z) # 0 if and only if
z # o.

11
Proof. If U is a m .t.i.s. we will have rad U = U and W = 0 in the previous proof. So
we only need to establish the second part of the proposition.
If z i' 0, z E G satisfies B(z,z) = 0 then B(x,z) = O.
Vx E U, U +(kz) is totally isotropic, contradicting the maximality hypothesis on
U.
I
Proposition 1.2.9 (Witt theorem.) Let E be a vector space with a non-degenerate
symmetric or antisymmetric bilinear form. Let F and F' be subspaces of E for which
a : F -+ F' is an isometry. Then a extends to an isometry of E .
Proof. If F is isotropic, let F = U as in Proposition (1.2.7), where rad U i' o.
If a : U -+ Viis a isometry, it extends to an isometry from the non- isotropic
space
PI ..1 P2 ..1 . . . ..1 P; ..1 W
to V' . Indeed, using the notations of Proposition (1.2.7), if
a(e.) = e~,
W' = a(W),
a(U) = (e~, e~, . . . , e~) ..1 W' ~ V' ,
we can find iI in V' such that (ei,in = Pi is a hyperbolic pair (i = 1,2, . .. ,r) where
the Pi are orthogonal to W' (by Proposition (1.2.4)). We extend a by requiring that
aU.) = II· This way we can assume that F is non-isotropic.
• The symplectic case ;
E = F ..1 Flo,
E = F' ..1 r ":
We only need to show that Flo and r- are isometric; but F lo and F,
1- are
of equal dimension, hyperbolic and non-isotropic, so they are isometric by
Proposition (1.2.3).
• The orthogonal case :
1. If F = F' we can extend a by keeping all elements of F fixed.
2. If dimF = dimF' = 1 and F i' F' : let F = (v), F' = (Vi), Vi = a(v),
Q(v) = Q(v') i' 0 and (v,v') is two-dimensional.
If (v, Vi) is non -isotropic, an isometry can be found such that it ex-
tends a and maps v tov' and Vi to v; one then applies 1.
If (v, Vi) is isotropic, BI(v,v/) has a one-dimensional radical. Let w be
a basis of this radical, v 1. (w),
Vi = av+ bw.
Q(v') = a2Q(v), so a = ±1; taking a = 1 and replacing bw by w :
w = Vi -v.

12
CHAPTER 1
Setting z = v + v', (w,z) = (w) EB (z ), and (w, z) takes the part of U
in Proposition (1.2.7), w that of rad(U) and z that of W .
By Proposition (1.2.7) there exists ayE E for which B(y, z) = 0,
Q(y) = 0, B(w,y) = 1. (z) EB (y) EB (w) is non-isotropic, there exists
an isometry mapping z to z, w to -wand y to -yo v = (z - w)/2
is mapped to v' = (z +w)/2 as should be. Invoking 1 completes this
part of the proof.
3. We use induction on dimF.
Let F =
Fl ..1 F2 , where dim(Fl) and
dim(F2 ) are greater than or equal to 1. F2 ~ Fl.l, so F, and F2 must be
non-isotropic. a(F) = a(Fl) ..1 a(F2), al = alFll a2 = a1F2 ' a(F2) is
orthogonal to a(Fl ) = al(Fl) hence
a(F2 ) ~ (al(Fl)).l = (a(Fl)).l.
a2 extends to an isometry "2 (by the induction hypothesis) which applies
Fl.l into (al(Fd).l, since F2 ~ Ft and a(F2) ~ (al(Fl)).l . al ..1"2 (where
the notation is self-explanatory) applies Fl ..1 Fl.l = E onto itself, hence
it is an isometry.
I
Proposition 1.2.10 Let E be non-isotropic, then all the maximal totally isotropic
subspaces of E are of the same dimension r, called the index of E; 2r ::; dim E .
Proof. If F and F' are m.t.i.s. and if dim F ::; dim F', F can be mapped linearly and
injectively into F' by an isometry which extends to an isometry a of E to E .
a(F) ~ F', but a-l(F') is totally isotropic, so F = a-l(F'), F' = a(F), dim F =
dim F'. As F ~ F.l, if F is totally isotropic :
dimF +dim F'" = n,
dimF.l ~ dimF = r',
2r'::::; n,
r'::::; n/2.
Hence if F is a m.t.i.s. dimF =r with 2r ::; n .
Remarks.
I
• Two totally isotropic spaces V and V' of equal dimension can be mapped to
each other by an isometry (since it is sufficient to extend any linear map of V
onto V' to an isometry).
• If two totally isotropic r-dimensional spaces F and F' satisfy F n F' = 0 and
FEB F' is non-isotropic, and iffurthermore Q(z) f 0, Vz f 0 in (F EB F').l (we
are in the orthogonal case), r is the index of E.
If F would not be a m.t.i.s. there would exist a totally isotropic Fl 2 F . Then
a Xl E Fl could be found for which, if Xl = Y + z,

but B(y + z,y + z) = Q(z) = 0, so z = O. As y E Fl, Y is orthogonal to all
elements of F
~ Fl . Furthermore y E F' implies that y is orthogonal to all
elements of F ', and F ffi F ' would be isotropic.
1.3
Special properties of the orthogonal geometry.
1.3.1
We will assume that E is non-isotropic. Our goal is to prove that any isometry can
be factored as a product of orthogonal symmetries. We will write Q(x) for B(x,x),
so
2B(x, y) = Q(x + y) - Q(x) - Q(y) .
Q is the quadratic form associated to B.
Definition 1.3.1 Let H be a non-isotropic subspace of E. The orthogonal symme-
try UH with respect to H is defined by
UH(X+Y)=x-y,
xEH1.,
yEH.
Clearly UH is an isometry and
detuH = (_l)dimH.

Theorem 1.3.1 (Fundamental Theorem, E. Cartan, J. Dieudotuie.) Every isometry
a of E is the product of symmetries with respect to non-isotropic hyperplanes. If
dim E = n, any a =I Id can be factored as a product of at most n symmetries.
Proof. To prove the first part is relatively easy, since it holds for n = 1.
1. Assume that a(x) = z , z being a non-isotropic vector. Then
E = (x) ED (x).L
and (x).L is non-isotropic and invariant under a. Now use induction, assuming
that the restriction of a to (x).L is a product of k symmetries with respect to
non-isotropic (n - 2)-dimensional spaces F I , F2 , . . . , Fk . Then U is the product
of the symmetries with respect to the non-isotropic hyperplanes
2. Assume that O"(x) = -x, x being a non-isotropic vector. If s is the symmetry
with respect to (x).L we can set v = sa and apply the previous reasoning.
3. Assume that for all non-isotropic non-zero vectors z , a(x) =I z and a(x) =I -x.
Setting y = a(x) , Q(y) = Q(x) and z + y and x - y cannot both be isotropic,
since Q(x + y) - Q(x - y) = 0 leads to 4Q(x) = 0, i.e. Q(x) = 0 (if K = R or
K = C).
• If z - y is non-isotropic and s is the symmetry with respect to (x - y)1. ,
x and yare mapped to each other by s.
2B(x, z - y)
U(x_y)(x)=x-
Q(x-y)
(x -y)=y.
Now we can set v = sa to obtain the first case.
• If z + y is non-isotropic and s' is the symmetry with respect to (x + y)1.,
(-x) and yare mapped to each other by s'. We then set v = s'o , v(x) =
- x and obtain the second case.
This completes the first part of the proof.
Now we will give a more complete proof (which holds for any field K not of
characteristic 2.)
1. 1 need not be modified : an z E E exists for which Q(x) =I 0 and a(x) = z , we
assume k ::; n - 1.

2. For some z , Q(x) i' 0 and a(x) - x is non-isotropic. Then let H = (a(x) - x)l.
and let u be the symmetry with respect to H. B(a(x)+x,a(x)-x) = 0 implies
that a(x) + x E H. u(a(x) + z ) = a(x) + x, u(a(x) - x) = -a(x) + x so
(u 0 a)(x) = x.
u 0 a satisfies the assumption in 1, choosing k ~ n - 1, a is a product of at
most n symmetries.
3. If n = 2. 1 and 2 allow us to assume that E has non-zero isotropic elements
(for if all vectors in E are non-isotropic, either 1 or 2 applies). We may assume
that E = (x,y) where (x,y) is a hyperbolic pair (d. (1.2 .2)) .
• a(x) = ay, a(x +ay) = ay +x is non-isotropic, apply 1.
• a(x) = ax, a(y) = a-1y (we can assume that a i' 1). Then for z = x+y,
a(z) - z = (a - l)x + (a-1 - l)y is non-isotropic and 2 applies.
4. n ;::: 3. Given 1 and 2 we may assume that no non-isotropic vector is fixed by
a and that a(x) - x is isotropic, Vx E E for which Q(x) i' O. There are three
steps in the proof :
• First step : we can assume that for all non-isotropic elements x of E,
a(x) - x is isotropic and prove that for all isotropic x E E, a(x) - x is
isotropic, so that (a + Id)E is a totally isotropic subspace W ~ E.
Indeed, let x satisfy Q(x) = 0, then (x)l. is at least two-dimensional since
n ~ 3 and (x)l. contains a non-isotropic vector y (otherwise (x)l. would be
totally isotropic, and as rad(x) = rad(x)l. = (x), rad(x)l. would contain
xl.) . Q(y) i' 0 and if f = ±1, a(y) - y must be isotropic (by assumption)
and so must be u = a(y +fX) - (y +ez) = (a(y) - y) +f(a(x) - x). Then
Q(u) = 2fB(a(y) - y,a(x) - x) + f2Q(a(x) - x) = O. Putting first
f = 1,
then e = -1 and adding the results, one obtains Q(a(x) - x) = O.
• Second step : if VI E W 1. then VI = a(VI) since, W being totally isotropic :
Vv E E,
0= B(a(v)-v,a(v')-v') = B(a(v),a(v'))-B(v,a(v'))-B(a(v)-v,v')
and a(v) - v E W, VI E W 1. imply that the last term vanishes.
B(a(v),a(v')) = B(v,v')
leads to B(v,v'- a(vl )) = 0, vl - a(v l ) E radE = 0, VI = a(v l ) .
• Third step : having assumed that no non-isotropic vector is invariant
under a, all vectors of W 1. must be isotropic and W is totally isotropic.
Now dim W + dim W 1. = n, dim W
~ n/2 and dim W 1. ~ n/2 imply
dim W 1. = dim W = r

(7 fixes all

case 4 cannot occur if
(7 is a reversion, and the proof is complete for

5(7 is a

1.3.2
The real case.
Definition 1.3.2 Q is said to be positive definite ifQ( x) > 0 for all non-zero x E E.
Q is said to be positive ifQ(x) 2: 0 for all non-zero x E E .
The definition of negative definite and negative are similar. Note that Q is positive
definite if and only if Q is positive and B is non-degenerate. Indeed, if Q is positive,
let y E E satisfy Q(y) = 0, then "Ix E E, Va E R, Q(x + ay) = Q(x) + 2aB(x,y);
if B(x, y) =I 0 the second term could have any real value, which is impossible, so
B(x,y) = 0 and radE is the set of y E E such that Q(y) = o.
Theorem 1.3.2 (Sylvester Theorem.) If E is a real n-dimensional space and if Q
is non-degenerate, a basis (el' e2, . . . , en) (said to be orthonormal) can be found such
that :
The index of Q is r if r ~ n - r, otherwise n - r; r is independent of the choice of
the orthonormal basis.
Proof By Proposition (1.2.3) and since K = R, Q(x) can be written as In the
theorem. Suppose, for instance, that r
~ n - r, then taking
F = (el +en, e2+ en-l, . . . , er + en-r+l),
F' = (el - en, e2 - en-I, · · ·, er -
en-r+l)
and
G = (er+l, . . . , en - r ) ,
a Witt decomposition is obtained and by remark 2 after Proposition (1.2 .10), r is
the index of Q. Hence r does not depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis.
•
The Sylvester Theorem is thus seen to be an easy consequence of the Witt de-
composition theorem.

ORTHOGONAL AND SYMPLECTIC GEOMETRIES.

1.3.3
The orthogonal groups.
If E is non-isotropic, i.e. B is non-degenerate, the isometry group of E is called the
orthogonal group O(E, B).
This group is most often denoted by O(Q), where Q is the associated quadratic
form .
If dim E = n, we also write O(n, K).
In the real case, if the Sylvester decomposition has p plus signs and q minus signs
(or signature (p,q) for short), we will write O(p,q,R) or O(p,q).
If q = 0, p = n we write O(n, R) or O(n).
SO(Q) stands for the rotation group. The notations SO(p,q), SO(n) should be
clear.
1.4
Special properties of the symplectic geometry.
Recall that any symplectic space E with a non-degenerate antisymmetric bilinear
form B is a hyperbolic space :
the hyperbolic planes Pi contain the hyperbolic pairs (Xi,Yi) and these 2r vectors
form a basis of E which will be called symplectic.
Clearly the discriminant of B relative to this basis is l.
The isometry group of E is called the symplectic group , denoted by Sp(2r, K).
1.4.1
Symplectic transvections.
Let a E E, a =I 0. We will try to find a a E Sp(2r, K) such that
a(x) =
X + rp(x)a,
rp(x) E K .
If such a a exists, B(a(x),a(y)) = B(x, y) so
rp(x)B(a, y) = rp(y )B(a, x).
Fix a Yo for which B(a, Yo) =I 0, then
<p(yo)
<p(x) = B(
)B(a,x) = cB(a,x),
a,Yo
so
a(x) = x + cB(a,x)a
c E K
(1)
where c is constant. It is easily verified that every homomorphism of the form (1)
is an isomorphism (a- 1 being obtained if we replace c by -c) and that every such a
preserves B . a is called a symplectic transvection of 'direction ' a.

18
CHAPTER 1
If c = 0, a = Id.
If c i: 0, a fixes x if and only if x E (a)l., which is analogous to the orthogonal
case, where a fixes the points of some hyperplane. Conversely if a symplectic isometry
a fixes the points of a hyperplane H, then a is a symplectic transvection . Indeed,
Vx E E , Vy E H :
B(a(x) - x,y)
B(a(x),y) - B(x,y) = B(a(x),y) - B(a(x),a(y))
B(a(x),y - a(y)) = O.
Then a(x) - x E H>, n- is a line (a) and a(x) = x + rp(x)a.
Remark. One can immediately verify that the symplectic transvections of direction
a make up a commutative group isomorphic to the additive group of K.
If U is written Ua then UcUd = Uc+d and ac = Id if and only if c = O.
1.4.2
Factorization.
We will now prove a factorization property in terms of symplectic transvections, for
elements of the symplectic group.
Lemma 1.4.1 A non-zero vector x can be mapped to another non-zero vector y by
a product of at most two symplectic transvections.
Proof. U being a symplectic transvection, if a( x) = y, x +cB( a, x)a - x = u(x) - x =
cB(a, x)a = y - z , hence y - x is collinear with a.
• If y = z , take U = Id.
• If y i: x and B(x,y) i: 0, as
U(X) = X + cB(x - y,X)(x - y)
and
U(x) = x - cB(y, x)(x - y),
the choice of c for which cB( z , y) = -1 ensures that a( x) = y.
This reasoning fails if B(x,y) = O.
Then we look for a z such that B(x, z) i: 0 and B(y, z) i: 0, which we can
find :
if xl. = yl., we take a z outside of xl., then x can be mapped to z, then z
to y by two transvections.
- If xl. i: yl., let u E xl. , U
~ yl. and v E v",
V
~ xl.,
W = U + v,
B(x,w) = B(x,v) i: 0 and B(y,w) = B(y,v) i: O. We can map z to w,
and then won y, by two transvections.

Lemma 1.4.2 Given two hyperbolic pairs (Xl,Yl) and (X2 ,Y2) there exists a product
of at most four transvections mapping (Xl,Yl) to (X2,Y2)'
Proof. Using at most two transvections Xl can be mapped to X2 and the pair (Xl,Yl)
will be mapped to a hyperbolic pair (X2, Y3)' Now it is sufficient to show that (X2' Y3)
can be mapped to (X2,Y2) using at most two transvections. Indeed, if (x,y) and
(x, Y') are two hyperbolic pairs :
• If B(y, yl ) =I 0 we map Y to Y' by a transvection of direction Y - v', and since
B(X,y' - y) = 0, X is fixed .
• If B(y,y') = 0, (x,x + y) is a hyperbolic pair. B(y,x + y) = -1 so (x,y) can
be mapped to (x,x + y) and as B(x + y,y') = B(X,y') =I 0, (x,x + y) can be
mapped to (x, s').

Theorem 1.4.1 (Factorization Theorem')
Every symplectic transformation a is
the product of symplectic trensveciiotis; if n = 2r = dim E, a can be factored as a
product of at most 4r transveetions. a is always a rotation (det a = 1).
Proof. Let U be a non-isotropic subspace of E,
E = U 1.. U1. .
If T is a transvection of U1. , Idu 1.. T is a transvection of E, so if (x ,y), (x',y') are two
hyperbolic pairs of U1. , (x ,y) can be applied to (x', y') by at most four transvections
of E , each of which fixes all vectors in U.
Let G be the subgroup of Sp(2r, K) generated by all transvections.
If a E Sp(2r, K) and if (Xl, Yl),(X2, Y2), . .. ,(xr,Yr) is a symplectic basis of E, we
set
u(xi) = xi,
U(Yi) = yj,
j = 1,2, . , " r .
If there exists aT, E G mapping the first i symplectic pairs (x"" y"') on the (x~ , y~),
T, transforms the given basis into

the 2i first elements generating U and the other elements generating U1. . Choose
aTE G fixing all vectors of U and mapping
(X:~l' Yi~l) to (x:+l, y~+l)' then TT,
applies the i + 1 first pairs (x"" y"') on the
(x~, y~), a = 1, .. . ,r + 1.
Repeating
this procedure we construct an element of G which maps the (x"y,) to the (x:,yi) ,
i = 1,2, ... , r. So G = Sp(2r, K).
At most 4r transvections were used in th is construction.
Finally, Uc =
U~/2' so det U = 1.

Proposition 1.4.1 The center of Sp(2r, K) is ± IdE.
CHAPTER 1
Proof. If 7 is a non-identity transvection of direction a, 7(X) - x E (a), Vx E V .
If a E Sp(2r, K) , then a7a-1(x) - x = a(7a-1(x) - a-1(x)) E (a(a)), so o-ta:' is
a transvection of direction a(a). If a is in the center, ora" = 7 for any transvection
7, so (a(a)) = (a); a fixing all lines in E is IdE (by Proposition (1.2.6)) .

The universal property.
Let fp be a p-linear mapping of EI x . . . Ep into a vector space F. Then there exists
a unique linear mapping 9 of 0 PEi to F such that
g(Xl 0 X2 0 . . . 0 xp) = fp(xi , X2,···, x p),
V(XI, X2, • . . , xp) E EI X E2 X . . . x Ep
and fp ---+ 9 is a vector space isomorphism.
Proof. Such a 9 must satisfy

satisfies the requirements, fp = go Op where 0p(XI' X2, . . . , x p) = Xl 0 X2 0 . . . 0 x p, I
In particular, if F = K then fp E E; 0 .. . 0 E; so 9 E (EI 0 . . . 0 Ep)· and we
can identify both spaces. In this identification a gi 1i2 •••ip corresponds to Oi1i2 .. .»,

2.2
Essential properties of exterior algebras.
E is an n-dimensional vector space over K and E· is its dual.
2.2.1
The space of exterior forms of order p.
Definition 2.2.1 A p-form CPP E 0 PE· , (p > 1) is called antisymmetric if for all
Xl, X2, .. . ,Xp E E ,

TENSOR, EXTERIOR AND SYMMETRIC ALGEBRAS.
25
If the p-form CPP is zero whenever X i = Xi, it is said to be alternating; it is obvious
that an alternating form is antisymmetric (just take Xi = Xi =
~i + TJi in (1)).
If a is a permutation of (1,2, ... ,p), written a =
(~2 ...p) of signature
' 1'2 .. ·I p
we deduce from (1) that
(2)
From (1) it also follows that CPP vanishes if Xl, X2, • . • , Xp are linearly dependent.
Definition 2.2.2 The antisymmetrized p-form CPP of the tensor Tp E ®PE*, p > 1,
is defined by
(3)
for all Xl, X2, . • . , X p E E, the sum extending over the p! terms corresponding to the
p! permutations of the symmetric group Sp.
(It will be more convenient to define E~'~2 : : :~P
= 0 whenever the index sequences are
different and to sum independently over each index, from 1 to n).
ATp = CPP is obviously antisymmetric and AATp = ATp (i.e. A2 = A). ATp = Tp
if Tp is antisymmetric. A can be extended by linearity. Then the antisymmetrization
A is linear and maps ®PE * into a subspace of ®PE*, which will be written I\P(E*),
the space of antisymmetric p-forms.
We also define the notations 1\I(E*) = E* and 1\D(E*) = K .
Proposition 2.2.1 dimf\P(E*) = G~ .
Proof. Any CPP E ®PE* is of the form
where
ak,k2...kp = cpp(ek"ek2, . . . ,ekp)
1 ~ k; ~ n.
If k; =
ki , the corresponding component will vanish, so there are at most
A~
non-zero terms left . Let Xl, X2, " " XP stand for the naturally re-ordered sequence
(k l , k2 , ... , kp ) , then
ak,k2...kp = E~~~: : : :~:a"'''2 '' '''P
(where there is no implicit summation). Grouping the p! terms including any per-
mutation of (Xl , X2, . . . , Xp), we obtain:

CHAPTER 2
(where one should sum over the kl , k2, ... , k.p but not over Xl, X2, . .. ,Xp) .
The
8klk2 ...kl'€~~:22::.t are antisymmetric.
These C~ elements are linearly independent,
for any vanishing linear combination of them would lift to the 8 k,k2...kl' , which is
impossible.

The a X' X2..'XI' where Xl < X2 < ... < XP will be called the strict components of
<pp to distinguish them from the antisymmetric tensor components ak,k2...kl"
2.2.2
The graded algebra A(E").
Now we define
A (E") = EB;=oAP (E").
(4)
Note that, by a remark of (2.2.1), N(E) == 0 if p > n. The dimension of A(E") must
then be
Lemma 2.2.1 The set of all 8 E 0(E") such that A(8) = 0 is a two-sided ideal of
0(E").
Proof. Let l(E") be the set of these elements. Then l(E") obviously is a vector
space and contains all 8 for which
The lemma will be proved if it can be shown that
A(8 0 T) = A(T 0 8) = 0,
"IT E 0 P(E"),
VB E ®q(E" )
whenever A(8) = O.
This follows from a property of the permutations: any a E Sp+q can be factored
as ao 0 (3, where fJ is an element of the subgroup H of all elements in Sp+q fixing
p + 1,p + 2, . .. , p +q. Now if <Pp+q = A(8 0 T) and writing a(xi) for Xa(i),
First keeping ao fixed and letting (3 vary, we obtain:
and the sum yields 0 by the antisymmetry of 8.

Proposition 2.2.2 The quotient of the algebra 0 (E") by the two-sided ideal l(E")
is an associative algebra whose underlying vector space is A( E") .

algebras.
Note that every T E ~(E·) can be uniquely decomposed as
T = ep + 8,

since T = AT + (T - A(T)) and A(T - A(T» = O.
Conversely, if T = ep + 8 as above, A(T) = Aep = ep and (J = T - A(T). Hence
the restriction of
to A(E·) is an isomorphism, therefore allowing the identification in the proposition
and the definition of a multiplication A, called the exterior product, turning A(E·)
into an associative algebra.

Definition 2.2.3 The exterior product A is defined by

Note that if T, T' E ~(E·),
A(T ~ T') = A(T) A A(T'),
and hence
A(T ~ T' ~ Til ~ . . .) = A(T) e A(T') ~ A(T") e ...
If T, T' and Til are antisymmetric :
TAT' A Til= A(T ~ T' e Til).
Because of the decomposition in (4), A(E·) is a graded algebra on Z with the property
(6)
if ,pp and epq are of order p and q.
In fact , (6) means that A(E·) is graded commutative. To prove (6), note that if

By the reasoning used to compute the dimension of I\P(E'), the C~ exterior products
obtained in (7) from all sequences (XI,X2, . . . , Xp) form a basis of N(E') if the
(JI, (J2, . . . ,(In form a basis of E' .
In particular, if we set p = n, if cpl, cp2, . . . ,cpn are n forms of E',
since dim I\n(E') = 1. a = det(cpt, cp2 ,
,cpn), the determinant of the n elements
cpl, cp2, .. . ,cpn relative to the basis ((JI , (J2,
,(In).
Proposition 2.2.3 Two linear forms are linearly independent if and only if their
exterior product does not vanish.
Proof. If (JI, (J2, .. . , (JP are linearly dependent linear forms, and, for instance, (JI =
>'~(Ji then
, '
consists only of zero terms.
Conversely, if (JI, (J2, . . . , (JP are linearly independent, we can add some forms
(JP+I, . . . , (In, completing them to a basis of E' . The C~ exterior products of p of these
forms, ordered naturally on the indices, form a basis for I\P( E'), hence (JII\(J21\. . .I\(JP,
being an element of this basis, cannot vanish.
I
All the facts we have established concerning the exterior product on E' are equally
true for E, we will henceforth rather consider I\(E).
2.2.4
The universal property.
Let jp be a multilinear antisymmetric mapping of Il"E into the vector space F.
Then there exists a unique linear mapping 9 from N(E) to F such that

The proof is similar to that of (2.1.7).
Some consequences.
If F = K , jp E N(E·) by definit ion and 9 E (N(E))·,
establishing a duality between /\(E)· and N(E), if we specify that for p =I q, N(E· )
and N(E) are orthogonal under the duality.
Considering N(E·) and N(E) as
subspaces of ®P(E· ) and ®P(E), the duality introduced before for the tensor spaces

Exterior powers of a linear mapping.
Let U : E -+ F be a linear mapping. If to
(Xl,X2, .. . , xp ) E DPE we associate U(Xl) /\ U(X2) /\ ... /\ u(xp ) E N F , the universal
property can be applied and there exists a unique linear map /\P(u) : N(E) -+ N(F),
for which:
(9)
/\P(u) has the following elementary properties :
1. If U maps E into F and v maps F into G, N (v 0 u) maps N(E) linearly into
N(G) and
2. If U is surjective, so is /\P(u).
3. If U is an isomorphism from E to F , N(u) is an isomorphism from N( E) to
N(F) and the inverse isomorphism is N(u-1).
Proof. 1 is straightforward, for 2 one should note that every element of N F is a
linear combination of elements Yl /\ Y2 /\ ., . /\ YP' Yi E F , the Yi being of the form
Yi = U(X;), Xi E E . 3 is obvious.
I
2.2.5
Another definition of the exterior algebra.
To facilitate the transition to Clifford algebras, let us consider the two-sided ideal j
in ®(E ) generated by the elements of the form
X ® z , x E E. j consists of all sums
of the form
In fact, replacing X by X + Y, j could equally well be generated by the elements of
the form X ® Y + Y ® X where x, Y E E.

30
CHAPTER 2
Proposition 2.2.4 Tbe exterior algebra /\(E) is tbe quotient algebra of the tensor
algebra ®(E ) by the two-sided ideal j generated by tbe x ® x, x E E.
Proof. A multiplication i\ can be defined as follows on the quotient i\(E) : if CI(u)
stands for the quotient class of u , u E ®(E ), we set
CI(u)i\ CI(v) = Cl(u ®v).
E -t i\(E) : x -t Cl(x) being injective, z E E and Cl(x) can be identified : if
x, x' E E and Cl( x) = CI(x'), x - x' E j and the elements of j being at least of
order 2, x = x' . Similarly, the elements of K can be identified with their image.
x ® x E j implies x i\z = 0 and x i\ y = -y i\z , Yx, y E E . These properties,
along with the associativity, imply that if the sequence of elements XI, X2 , • • • ,Xp E E
has one or more repeated members,
and hence
i\(E) is generated by the
.
.
.
eXt /\ eX2 /\ • • • /\ e x p'
1 ~ Xl < X2 < ... < Xp ~ n
if the (ei) form a basis of E. The multiplication table of these elements is the same
as that of /\(E), as indicated before . The algebras i\(E) and /\(E) can therefore be
identified.
I
2.2.6
Decomposable elements of /\(E), p-vectors.
Definition 2.2.4 An element Xl /\ X2 /\ • • • /\ x p E N(E) is said to be decomposable;
it is also called a p-vector.
Lemma 2.2.2 Let z
=1= 0, Z E N(E), p < n, tben tbe elements z E E for whicb
Z /\ x = 0 form a q-dimensional subspace Vi of E, q ~ p. If (Xi), i = 1, .. . , q is a
basis of Vi, z = v /\ Xl /\ .. . /\ Xq for some v E /\P-q(E).
Proof. Vi is obviously a subspace and if q is its dimension, a basis of E can be
obtained from Xl, X2 , • • • , X q and (n - q) other elements.

where aI, a2, . . . , a p is an increasing sequence of indices .
Z /\ X ao = 0
31
for ai = 1,2, . . . , q, by the assumption, hence the aala2 °o.ap where none of the indi-
ces 1,2, .. . , q occur must vanish. Furthermore, if one of the indices aj from 1 to
q is absent from certain sequences, exterior multiplication by x a ; will, through the
vanishing of the left-hand side, prove that all the coefficients of such sequences must
be zero: all non-vanishing terms therefore contain Xl /\ X2 /\ . . . /\ Xq, q < P and
Z = v /\ Xl /\ X2 /\ . . . /\ Xq •
I
Note that obviously "Vz = E if p = n .
Lemma 2.2.3
Z is decomposable if and only if dim(Vz ) = p.
Proof. If dim("Vz) = p, v is scalar. Conversely, if z = Yl /\ Y2 /\ ' " /\ YP i 0, Yi E E,
then the Yl,Y2, . . . ,YP are linearly independent elements of "Vz, so dim("Vz) = p since
dim("Vz) cannot exceed p.
I
Proposition 2.2.5 Let {Xi} and {Yi} be two linearly independent sets, 1 ~ i ~ p.
Then Yl /\ Y2 /\ . . . /\ YP = A(XI /\ X2 /\ . .. /\ xp) , A E K*, if and only if the (Xi) and
the (Yi) generate the same subspace of E .
Proof. If these subspaces coincide and if (fl' h, ...,fp) is a basis of this subspace F,
Xl /\ X2 /\
/\ Xp = a(fl /\ h /\
/\ fp),
Yl /\ Y2 /\
/\ Yp = {3(fl /\ h /\
/\ fp),
a E K*
{3 E K*,
since dim f\P( F) = 1. Conversely if Yl/\ Y2/\ ' . . /\ YP = AXI/\ X2/\' .. /\ Xp i 0, A E K*,
Z = Yl /\ Y2 /\ ... /\ YP satisfies dim(Vz ) = p since "Vz contains Yl,Y2, . . . , Yp. As it also
contains the Xl, X2, . . . , xp, it is also the subspace generated by them.
I
Consequences.
To each decomposable element Z E f\P(E) a unique p-dimensional
subspace can be associated, viz. Vz '
Conversely, to each p-dimensional subspace
F there corresponds a p-vector which is unique up to a non-zero scalar factor.
(Xl, X2 , · . . , xp) being a bas is of F and el, e2, . . . , en a basis of E,
where the aI, a2, . . . , a p are a strictly increasing sequence of indices.
The

Plucker or Grassmann coordinates of F .

CHAPTER 2
2.3
Essential properties of symmetric algebras.
2.3.1
The space of symmetric forms of order p,
Definition 2.3.1 A p-form <pp E @P(EO), p > 1, is said to be symmetric if for every
sequence Xl, X2 , •• • , x p E E,
so that for any a E Sp : (1,2, .. . ,p) --+ (iI,i2,.. . ,i p )
(2)
For p = 1, <PI is a linear form. For p = 0, <Po is a scalar.
Definition 2.3.2 The symmetrized p-form <pp of the tensor Tp E @PEO, p > 1, is
defined by
(3)
(Here a(Xi) stands for Xa(i)) .
We write S(Tp ) =
<PP' If Tp is symmetric, S(Tp ) = Tp , so S2 = S . We extend
S by linearity. S is a linear mapping from @P(EO) into the subspace of symmetric
forms in @P(EO) which is denoted by VP(EO). Setting VO(EO) = K , VI(EO) = Eo,
we define
v (EO) = EB;'o vP (EO) .
V(EO) is an infinite-dimensional subspace of @(EO).
Proposition 2.3.1 dim(VP(EO)) =
C~+p_l.
Proof. An element l{Jp E VP(EO) can be written uniquely as
l{Jp = aklk2 ...k/lkl @Ok2 @ . . . @ Okp E @P(EO)
(4)
where the ak1k2 •••kp are symmetric. Let kl , k2 , • •• , kp be a sequence of not necessarily
distinct numbers from 1 to n and let Xl, X2, . . . ,Xp be the same sequence, but ordered,
so that
(5)
Regrouping the terms of l{Jpinvolving some permutation of kl, k2 , • •• , kp , a linearly
independent set is obtained.
Its cardinal number equals the number of sequences
satisfying (5).
Now if we note that the p numbers Xl, X2 + 1, X3 + 2, . . . , XP + P - 1 are pairwise
different and form an arbitrary sequence of numbers between 1 and n + p - 1, the
proposition is proved.

2.3.2
The symmetric algebra V(E*).
The set of () E ®(E*) such that S((}) = 0 is a two-sided ideal of ®(E*), denoted by
.J(E*).
The proof is similar to the antisymmetric case, considering S(T ®(}) and S((}®T)
and factoring a E Sp+q as ao 0 f3, f3 E H. (d. subsection 2.2).
An element T of ®(E *) can be uniquely split as T = ep+(}, ep E V(E*), () E :T(E*).
V(E*) and ®(E *)/ .J(E *) are identified. We define
(6)
As before we deduce that S(T ®T' ®T") = S(T)V S(T') V S(T"). A basis for VP(E*)
is given by
(}'Xl V (}'X2 V . .. V (}'XP,
1::; x. ::; X2 ::; . . . ::; Xp ::; n
(7)
if the (}i form a basis of E* . It is common practice to write (}'Xl V (}'Xl = ((}'Xl )2 etc .
Clearly any element of this basis can be written in the form
(8)
where aI , a2 , . . . , a n are non-negative integers satisfying al + a2 + ...+ an = p.
Therefore we can identify V(E*) with the algebra of polynomials in n variables with
coefficients in K,
(9)
Finally we can consider a universal property and consequences which parallel the
antisymmetric case . The formula (8) can now be written
where perm stands for the permanent of the matrix ((epi, Xj}).
As a final remark, V(E) can be defined as the quotient of ®(E ) by the two-sided
ideal j
generated by all x ® y - y ® x, where x, y E E.

(2)
(3)
itp(x ® a) + x ® itp(a) = (x, tp)a = itp(x)a
since i'P(x ® 1) = (x, tp) = itp(x).
Assume that ill' is defined on ®O(E), ®l(E), .. . ,®h-1(E), then (3) yields, for
x ® a E ®h(E),
i'P(x ® a) = -x ® i'P(a) + i'P(x)a.
The existence and uniqueness of ill' on ®h(E) follow from the bilinearity of the right-
hand side and from the universal property of the tensor algebra.

(5)
As (i'P)2 = 0 on K, (i'P)2 = 0 on ®h(E) by induction. The second formula can be

Proposition 2.4.4 ill' is an anti-derivation of the tensor algebra, its degree is -1 :

Proof. It is sufficient to verify that, using the definitions of (2.2.5), the two-sided
ideal j is invariant under ill" so that we can divide by j in order to define the action
of ill' on the exterior algebra. Assuming that a has order h, i'P(a Q9 x Q9 z Q9 b) =
i'P(a) Q9 z Q9 x Q9 b+(-1 )ha Q9 z Q9 x Q9 i'P( b) together with i'P(x Q9 x) = 0 yields the

3.1
Definition and general properties.
Let E be an n-dimensional vector space on K, (R or C), Q a quadratic form and B
its associated symmetric bilinear form :

Definition 3.1.1 The orthogonal Clifford algebra is defined as the quotient of the
tensor algebra ¢9(E ) by the two-sided ideal N(Q) generated by the elements of the
form
x ¢9x-Q(x),
xEE C ¢9(E).
We will generally speak of 'Clifford algebra', as long as the symplectic case is not
considered. If Q(x) = 0, the orthogonal Clifford algebra coincides with /\(E) (d.
Chapter 2, 2.5).
The Clifford algebra will be written as C(E, Q), but often this will be shortened
to C(Q).
Let PQ be the canonical mapping ¢9(E ) ~ ¢9(E)/N (Q) = C(Q), then just as
¢9(E ) is generated by E, C(Q) will be generated by pQ(E). We will soon establish
that pQ(E) and E can be identified.
The definition immediately leads to
(pQ(X))2 = Q(x),
from which, expanding (PQ(x + y))2 = Q(x + y), we obtain
PQ(x)PQ(Y) + PQ(Y)PQ(x) = 2B(x, y).
(1)
(2)
The gradation on C(Q).
The tensor algebra is the direct sum of two spaces :
¢9(E ) =T+ EB T-, where
T+ = EBh=D¢92h (E)
37

38
and
CHAPTER 3
u = it 0 ea-
T- = $ h=O18l2h+l (E).
The generators of C(Q) are elements of T+ I so N( Q) = N+(Q) (JJ N-(Q), where
N+(Q) = N(Q) n T+
and
N-(Q) = N(Q) n T- .
It follows that
C(Q) = C+(Q) $ C-(Q),
where C+(Q) = pQ(T+) and C-(Q) = pQ(T-).
Obviously C+( Q) is a subalgebra of C( Q) and the properties
C+(Q)C+(Q) ~ C+(Q),
C-(Q)C-(Q) ~ C+(Q),
C+(Q)C-(Q) ~ C-(Q)
prove that C(Q) is graded over the group Z2 = {O, I}, i.e. it is semi-graded.
3.1.2
The universal property of C(Q).
Theorem 3.1.1 (Fundamental Theorem.) Let F be an algebra over K and let u be
a linear mapping from E to F such that
(U(X))2 = Q(x),
Vx E E,
then there exists a unique homomorphism it from C(Q) to F such that
C(Q)
7u~
E
F
Proof. it must be unique since the set of all PQ(x), x E E, generates C(Q). u has a
unique natural extension to a homomorphism v from I8l(E) to F,
v(Xl I8l X2 I8l . .. I8l Xh) = v(Xl)V( X2) . . .v(Xh) = u(xt}u( X2) .. .u(Xh).
From (U(X))2 = Q(x) it follows that
v(x I8l x - Q(x)) = v(x I8l x) - Q(x) = (u(x)? - Q(x) = 0
so v vanishes on N(Q) and v(t) =v(t') whenever t - t' E N(Q).
Therefore, taking the quotient, a mapping it can be deduced from v;
u
IS a
homomorphism from C(Q) to F . Setting i = PQ(t), it(i) = v(t) by definition, so
it(x) = u(x) and it 0 PQ = u on E.

Consequences : main involution and anti-involution.

• Let F be the reverse algebra C(Q)O of C(Q) and u = PQ . The restriction of
it to pQ(E) C C(Q) will be the identity since it must map PQ(x) E C(Q) to
PQ(x) E C(Q)O : therefore a unique [3 exists such that
[3(ZZ') = [3(z')[3(z)
and that its restriction to pQ(E) is the identity. Clearly [32 = Id, since
Xi = PQ(Xi),
Xi E E .
[3-1 = [3 and [3 must be injective.
[3 is called the main antiautomorphism (or main anti-involution) of C(Q); we
stress the fact that its restriction to PQ is the identity.
• Let us consider a vector space E' with quadratic form Q' and let f : E -+ E' be
linear. C(Q') being the Clifford algebra of E' , we will assume that Q' 0 f = Q
so that
(PQI(f(X)))2 = Q'(f(x)) = Q(x),
and we may consider u = PQ 0 f : E -+ C(Q').
Then there exists a homomorphism Cf from C( Q) to C(Q') such that
Cf 0 PQ = PQI 0 f
on E. In particular, for E' = E, Q' = Q, f = - Id, we find that there exists a
unique homomorphism a from C(Q) to C(Q) such that a 0 PQ = -PQ on E.
As a 2 = Id, a-I = a . a is called the main automorphism (or main involution)
on C(Q) and its restriction to pQ(E) is - Id.
• The universal property also proves that if (E, Q) and (El , Qd are isometric
spaces, the Clifford algebras C(E,Q) and C(El,Ql) are isomorphic.
3.1.3
The dimension of the algebra C(Q).
Proposition 3.1.1 Ifn is the dimension of E, dimC(Q) ~ 2n.
Proof. Let (el>e2,... ,en) be a basis of E , then, writing P as PQ now:
p(e;)p(ei) + p(ei)p(e;) = 2B(e;, ei),
(p(e;))2 = Q(e;)
imply, by an easy reasoning, that C{Q) can be generated by products of the form
p(eil)p(ei2) ... p(eip),
1 ~ i l < i 2 < ... < i p ~ n
and by p(l), whose number does not exceed 2n .

CHAPTER 3
Definition 3.1.2 Let F and G be two graded algebras, then their tensor product
can be given the structure of an associative algebra if we define, for homogeneous
elements,
(al ® a2)(bl ® b2) = (-1)P:l Q1 albl ® a2b2
where P2 is the degree of a2 and ql is the degree of bl , and extend this multiplication
by linearity.
The proof is immediate; the algebra obtained in this way is called the graded tensor
product of F and G.
Lemma 3.1.1 Let Q and Q' be quadratic forms on the finite-dimensional vector
spaces E and E', then there exists a surjective homomorphism from C(Q EB Q') to
C(Q) ® C(Q') .
Proof. Q EB Q' is the quadratic form on E EB E', considered as a direct orthogonal sum;
the tens or product C( Q) ® C(Q') has the multiplicative structure from Definition
(3.1.2) and the Clifford algebras are Z2-graded. Now define
u(x, x') = p(x) ® 1+ 1 ® p(x'),
x E E ,
x' E E' .
It is easily verified that this mapping u : E EB E' --. C( Q) ® C( Q') satisfies
(U(X,X'))2 = Q(x) +Q(x') = (Q EB Q')(x,x').
Applying the Fundamental Theorem yields the existence of a homomorphism ii. from
C(Q ffi Q') to C( Q) ® C( Q'). The latter algebra being generated by the elements of
the form p(x) ® 1 and 1 ® p(x'), the resul t is proved.
I
Proposition 3.1.2 The dimension of C(Q) is 2n. If (el' e2, . . . , en) is a basis of E ,
the set of
p(l),
p(e;Jp(e;2) '" p(e;I')'
1::; i l < i 2 < ... < i p ::; n
is a basis for C(Q).
Proof. We use induction on n .
If dim E = 1, ®(E) can be identified with the algebra of polynomials in one
variable and N(Q) is the ideal generated by X 2 -
a where Q(x) = a ; by a classical
result, C(Q) is two-dimensional.
If dimE> 1, we set E = E' EB El l where dimEI = 1, and Q = Q' EB QI as in
Lemma (3.1.1). By this lemma, C(Q EB Q') can be mapped to C(Q') ® C(Qd, so
dimC(Q) ~ dim(C(Q') ®C(Qd). The induction hypothesis being that dimC(Q') =
2n - l , this implies dim C( Q) ~ 2n and the result is proved.

• /\(E) and C(Q) are linearly isomorphic.
An isomorphism between them maps eil /\ ei2 /\ ... /\ ei" to p(eil )p(ei2) . . . p(ei,,)
if 1 ::; i 1 < i 2 < ... < i p ::; n and maps 1 to p(I).
• The elements of K and E can be identified with their images under p.
As p(1) and p(ei) are elements of a basis of C(Q), they form a linearly inde-
pendent set :
p(a) = ap(l) = 0 implies that a = 0, and
p(x) = Ei'=l xip(e;) == 0 implies xi = 0, so x = O.
The restrictions of p to K and to E are therefore injective, and the result is
obtained. Henceforth we will write a for p(a), e, for p(e.) and {ei1ei2 . .. ei,,} for
the basis of C(Q) given before; also 1 = e0. The relations (1) and (2) become
x2 = Q(x), xy + yx = 2B(x,y).
• The homomorphism of Lemma (3.1.1) is an algebra isomorphism:
C(Q ED Q') = C(Q) 0 C(Q')
where the tensor product is graded.

3.1.4
Simple examples.
• We have already noted that if dimE = 1, C(Q) is the algebra of polynomials
in one variable. If e is a non-zero element of E, e2 = Q(e) and (1, e) is a basis
of C(Q). In the real case, e can be chosen so as to have Q(e) = ±1 or Q(e) = O.
- If Q(e) = -1, e2 = -1, the real algebra obtained is the complex number
field.
- If Q(e) = 1, e2 = 1, setting
el == (1 + e)/2,
e2 = (1 - e)/2,
(el , e2) is a new basis for C(Q) such that
C(Q) is then the direct composition of 2 fields isomorphic to K :
The elements of C(Q) are called hyperbolic complex numbers.

42
CHAPTER 3
- If Q(e) = 0, e2 = 0, C(Q) is the set D of dual numbers. D is a commu-
tative ring.
Remark.
If F is a three-dimensional real vector space and if A is the affine
space associated to F, we define
FI=F @D
and call the elements of F I dual vectors. These dual vectors can be applied to
torsor reduction: if T is a torsor whose reduction elements in MEA are SM
and 9M (vector sum and resulting moment), the dual vector
is associated to T and the study of torsors can be reduced to the geometry of
the space F'.
The hyperbolic complex numbers can also be applied to certain physical theo-
ries (e.g. general relativity).
• Let dimE = 2 and let (e1' e2) be an orthogonal basis of E for which Q(e1) = 01
and Q(e2) = 02.
A basis for C(Q) is then given by 1, e1, e2, e1e2 and it immediately follows that
e1e2+ e2e1 = 0, by (2)
(e1)2 = 01 and (e2)2 = 02 by (1)
(e1e2)2 = -0102,
(e1e2)e1 = -e1(e1e2) = -01e2 and
(e1e2)e2 = e1(e2)2 = 02e1'
C(Q) is a generalized quaternion algebra; if 01 = 02 = -1, the skewfield H of
Hamilton's quaternions is obtained. (In the classical notations, e1 = i, e2 = j,
e1e2 = k.)
In Chapter 7, other examples will be given, from the work of E. Cartan and
others, related to the traditional exposition of mathematical physics.
3.1.5
The role of the 'fermionic' creation and annihilation operators.
The vector space isomorphism obtained between A(E) and C(Q) may depend on
the choice of the base for A(E). The reader may verify, using formula (8) in the
sequel, with xu = ei, ei2 ... eil" that two isometrically related bases define the same
linear isomorphism. We will now display a linear isomorphism between A(E) and
C(Q), defined independently from any choice of bases, and related to the creation

and annihilation operators introduced in Chapter 2, 4.1.
Using the notations of
Chapter I, 1.1 for the symmetric bilinear form B,
"til : x -. B(x,y)
is an element of E*, the 'covariant' vector associated to the 'contravariant' vector y.
Let us write "til = v', so that y*(x) = B(x,y).
By Chapter 2, 4.1,

Using a classical definition which will be considered in Chapter 5, we obtain a rep-
resentation of G(Q) in the exterior algebra of E .
Lemma 3.1.2 Given a bilinear form F on E, there exists a unique linear endomor-
phism >'F on 18l(E) such that :

j denotes the two-sided ideal of ®(E ) generated by the x ®x (d. Chapter 2,2.5).
Proposition 3.1.3 If B is the symmetric bilinear form associated to Q, (i.e. Q(x) =
B(x,x)), the operator >"B maps the ideal N(Q) into j

Taking the quotient in (6), applied to u E C(Q) for F = B,
(8)
where the product in C(Q) is, as always, simply indicated by the juxtaposition of
the factors .
Analogous isomorphisms >"F could be obtained using any bilinear form F for
which F(x,x) = Q(x), but the choice of the (symmetric) B is natural.
Note that both sides of (8) are elements of the exterior algebra, so that a second
multiplication can be defined on I\(E), identifying >"B(V) with v E C(Q), using
xu = x 1\ u + ix.(u),
x E E,
u E I\(E).
(9)
Some theoretical physicists call this algebra over I\(E) a Kiihler-Atiyah algebra; but
the correspondence given by (8) or (9) is already given by Chevalley and Bourbaki,
and is implicit in E. Cartan's work.
The importance of (9) is that it expresses, step by step, computations in the
Clifford algebra C(Q) in terms of other computations in I\(E). Conversely, noticing

ORTHOGONAL CLIFFORD ALGEBRAS.
45
that >"-8 maps j into N(Q), one could exchange C(Q) and A(Q) in the reasoning,
having noted that itp can be obtained on the Clifford algebra by taking the quotient,
to express computations in the exterior algebra in terms of computations in C(Q).
Sadly, >"8 is not an algebra isomorphism and the identifications in A(E) are no longer
covariantly functorial in C(Q), or, put more plainly, a basis change in C(Q) messes
up the Z-homogeneous components of an element that is linearly identified to its
image in the exterior algebra. Hence (9) does not provide a new definition of the
Clifford algebra, but merely offers a computational method, whose interest is only
to yield an intrinsic linear isomorphism (having chosen F = B) between C(Q) and
A(E) .
The most important point is that any computation in the Clifford algebra can be
expressed in the exterior algebra, and vice versa.
Remark. If we compare Proposition (3.1.3), (8), (9) and the results deduced before
from (4), the creation and annihilation operators are seen to generate a Clifford
algebra which is isomorphic to an endomorphism subalgebra of A(E); x E E and
Lx E End(A(E» can obviously be identified to yield another definition of the Clifford
algebra, which is often used by theoretical physicists.
3.1.6
Extension of the scalar field.
If K is a subfield of the (commutative) field K', the amplified
vector space E' of
E by K' is the tensor product K' 0 E. It is also a vector space over K' under the
scalar multiplication a'(a 0 x) = (a'a) 0 x, where a',a E K' and x E E .
If (el, e2, . . . , en) is a basis of E over K , the el, e2, . .. , en are also a basis of E'
over K' : if the Ii are a (possibly infinite) 1 basis of K' over K, if z E K' 0 E where
z E Li,jtii(Ji 0 ei) and only a finite number of terms do not vanish, tii E K,
z = L>..i 0 ei = L>..i(1 0 ei),
>..i E K'.
Furthermore, L >..1t(1 0 elt) = 0 implies
L >..It 0
elt = 0 and L tilt(Ji 0 elt) = 0,
hence tilt = 0 and >..It = 0; the result then follows from the identification of 1 0 ei
with ei'
Let B be a symmetric bilinear form on Ex E and let Q(x) = B(x,x) be its
associated quadratic form, then B has a unique extension B' to E' X E' . Indeed, if
B' extends B, B'(ei, ei) = B(ei, ei), defining B' completely. If Q'(x) = B'(», z ), Q'
is an extension of Q. Conversely, if Q~ extends Q, the associated symmetric bilinear
form extends B, since :
2B~ (x, y) = Q~(x +y) -
Q~(x) -
Q~ (y)
lThis case will occur in Chapter 17; K' will then be the ring of formal power series in one
indeterminate. The extension of the tensor algebra operations to this case is obvious .

CHAPTER 3
and B' = Bf .
Q' is therefore unique, just as B'.
1£ Q is non-degenerate, Q' is also non-degenerate, the discriminants of Q and Q'
relative to the basis (ei) being equal.
Proposition 3.1.4 Let K be a subfield ofK', let E' and G'(Q) be the vector space
and the Clifford algebra obtained from E and G(Q) by the extension of the scalar
field, then G'(Q) and G(Q') are isomorphic.
Proof. G'(Q) is an algebra with the multiplication
(a ®v)(a' ®v')=aa' ®vv',
Va,a'EK',
Vv,v'EG(Q).
We associate to 1 ® e, = e, E E' the element 1 ® pQ(ei) E G'(Q) and define by
linearity a K'-linear mapping from E' to G'(Q) written as 1 ® PQ = u.
Every element of E' being a finite sum of terms of the form a ®x, a E K', x E E,
it is sufficient to verify that
and to apply the universal property :
it (d. Theorem (3.1.1)) is a homomorphism from G(Q') to G'(Q) and is obviously
surjective, hence bijective since the dimensions of G'(Q) and G(Q') are equal.
I
In the sequel , we will apply these results to K = Rand K' = C .
3.2
Real and complex Clifford algebras: the 'periodicity theorems'.
In the previous section, the only special property of Rand C we used was the fact
that their characteristic differs from 2, and all results and properties carryover to
Clifford algebras over finite-dimensional modules of characteristic different from 2. In
this section, however, we will fully use the special properties of the real and complex
number fields.
3.2.1
The real case.
Let B be a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, we will assume that the associ-
ated quadratic form Q has signature (r, s) where r+s = n, so that in an orthonormal
basis :
Q(x) = (X1)2 +...+(XT)2 _ (XT+1)2 _ ... _ (xn )2.
G(r, s) will stand for C(Q). The tensor product used here is over non-graded algebras.

Proof. Let E, E' be (n = r + s)-dimensional spaces, let E2 be a two-dimensional
space, and let Q, Q', Q2 be their non-degenerate quadratic forms.
Consider the direct orthogonal sums E (B E2 and E' (B E2.
Let (el' e2) be an
orthonormal basis of E2 and let
where x is the image of x' under a linear isomorphism identifying E' and E .

defined as a mapping from E' (B E2 into C(Q2) 0 C(Q) .
(u(x' + y))2 = -(ed(e2)2x2 + y2 + (yel e2+ ele2Y) 0 x,
but Y = ael + (3e2 causes the last term to vanish.
Taking Q' = Q if Q(el)Q(e2) = -1 or Q' = -Q if Q(edQ(e2) = 1, we get
u(x' + y)2 = (X')2 + y2 = (Q' (B Q2)(X' + y).
The proposition then follows from the universal property of Clifford algebras and
from their dimensions, since the image of u contains y 0 1, el 0 1, e2 0 1, ele2 0 z
and hence (ele2 0 x)(ele2 0 1) = ±(1 0 z ); these elements generate C(Q2) 0 C(Q'),
u is surjective and therefore it is bijective.

These formulas imply that :

0 PC(I, 1) 0 C(k' ,O)
C(2, 0) 0 C(O, 2) 0 C(k' - 4,0),
k' > 4
and if
k' = 4q
k' = 4q+ 1
k' = 4q+ 2
k' = 4q+ 3

0 C(O, 2) 0 C(2, 0)
C(2, 0) 0 C(O, 2) 0
0 C(O, 2) 0 C(O, 1).
C(p,p + k') and C(O, k') are deduced from these formulas by exchanging rand s
in C(r,s).
Finally, we need only compute C(l, 0), C(O, 1), C(I ,1), C(2,0) and C(0,2). Let
Mn(R), Mn(C) and Mn(H) be the matrix algebras with real, complex and quaternion
components. Taking the basis

Furthermore Mn(R) I8l Mp(R) ~ Mnp(R) and the isomorphism between C(r,r) and

In the sequel we will use the classical results Mp(H) ~ Mp(R) I8l Hand Mp(C) ~
Mp(R) I8l C. Then

C(O, 2) I8l C(2,0)

H ® M2(R) ~ M2(H) ~ C( 4,0).
Using (3) (r = 0, s = 2) we obtain
H I8l H ~ M4(R).
Then H I8l C ~ C(O, 2) ® C(O,1) leads, using (3) and (1), to
and these results allow us to compute all real Clifford algebras. The following results
are helpful :
1.
C(r, s) I8l C(O, 8) ~ C(r,s + 8) and C(r,s) ® C(8, 0) ~ C(r + 8, s)
(the 'periodicity' isomorphisms). Indeed, C(r, s) ® C(2, 0) ~ C(s +2,r) by (2),
C(s+2,r) I8lC(0,2) ~ C(r,s+4) by (3) etc. C(r,s+4) I8lC(2,0) ~ C(s+6,r).
C(s+6,r) I8l C(0, 2) ~ C(r,s+8), and C(0,8) ~ C(0,2) I8lC(6,0) ~ C(0 ,2) 18l
C(2, O) I8lC(O, 4) ~ C(O, 2)I8lC(2,O)®C(O, 2)®C(2, 0), which proves this result .
2. C(r,s) ®C(p,q)~C(r+p,s+q) ifp=q, (mod4).
3. C(r, s) ® C(p, q) ~ C(s + p,r + q) if p = q + 2, (mod 4). These formulas are
proved in a similar way to 1, using Proposition (3.2.1).
Finally, we can tabulate the Clifford algebras for the signatures (p, s). p +q = n ,
p plus signs and q minus signs, and include all cases, when the 'periodicity' is taken
into account. We write R, C, H for matrix algebras and 2R, 2H for the direct sum
of two identical matrix algebras. Note that 2C does not occur here, which will be a
very important result in the sequel.

It is known that the matrix algebras Mn(R), Mn(C) and Mn(H) are simple (d.
ultra), so we have that
C(p, q) is not simple, but rather the direct composition of two simple ideals, if and
only if p - q = 1, (mod 4).
Note the isomorphisms C(p,q):::: C(p+4,q-4) ifq 2: 4 and C(p,q):::: C(q +
1,p -1) if p =J O.
. The algebras constructed on even-dimensional spaces E are simple and can be
identified with real or quaternion matrix algebras.
3.2.2
The complex case.
We have proved before that C(Q') = C'( Q) if the prime stands for complexification
or for a complex space. By tensor product, we see that
C'(2r) ~ C(r, r) ~ C :::: M 2r(C).
A similar reasoning to the one in the real case proves that
C'(r + 1) :::: C'(l) ~ C'(r).
(4)
One considers a (r + l l-dimensional complex space E' = E~ EB (ed where (el)2 = 1,
el being orthogonal to
E~ . Now define U(XI + y) = (el ~ Xl) + (YI ~ 1), Y E (el),
Xl E E~. Then
(U(XI + y))2 = (xd + (y)2 +(elY +yel) ~ Xl = (xd2+ y2
and the conclusion is similar to the real case. Just as for C(l, 0), we see that C'(l) =
C EB C, hence
C'(2r + 1) :::: C'(2r) EB C'(2r) :::: M 2r(C ) EB M 2r(C ).
A periodicity of order two appears. The Clifford algebras on even-dimensional spaces
E' are simple, those on odd-dimensional spaces are the direct composition of two
simple ideals.

CHAPTER 3
3.3
The direct study of the Clifford algebra structure.
We first assume that Q is non-degenerate, dim E = n > O. Some of the results in
this section have already been obtained in section 2; nevertheless we give a direct
treatment of Clifford algebras without resorting to the special properties of Rand
C.
In fact, the methods and results in this section can be applied to any finite-
dimensional vector space over a commutative field whose characteristic is different
from 2.
3.3.1
If E is an even-dimensional vector space over K (n = 2r) .
If the index of Q equals r, Q is said to be neutral.
Proposition 3.3 .1 If dim E = 2r and Q is neutral :
1. C(Q) is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a (2r)-dimensional vector
space S over K.
2. C+(Q) is the direct composition of two ideals, each of which is isomorphic to
the endomorphism algebra of a (2r - 1)-dimensional vector space over K.
Proof. Q being neutral, E = F $ F' where F and F' are maximal totally isotropic
subspaces (Chapter 1, 2.3). Hence a basis
can be found such that the Xi span F and the Yi span F'. Then
Let S be the subspace of C(Q) generated by the set of
and by x0f = f.
If we notice that the set of XiI Xi2 . .. XihYjl Yi2 . •. Yjk for 1 :S i, < j2 < .. .jk :S r
is a basis of C(Q), it is easily seen that Sis C(Q)f.
The dimension of S is 2r •
Let p be the representation of C(Q) in S :
p(u)vf = uu];
u E C(Q) .
If we set XiI ' " Xi h =
XH for short, we get XJ(ni~H YiXi)YH(XHJ) = xJf, modulo
a non-zero factor.
XJ(ni~HYiXi)YH(XKJ) = 0 if K # H .
This proves that p is
surjective since we can obtain every element of the canonical basis of End S . Due to
the dimensions, p is bijective which proves 1.

ORTHOGONAL CLIFFORD ALGEBRAS.
51
To establish 2 it is sufficient to note that if u E C+(Q), vf and uvf have the
same parity.
C+(Q)f and C-(Q)f are each invariant under C+(Q), p being injective, the
image of C+(Q) by p is in End S+ x End S -, (S+ = C+(Q) n S, S - = C-(Q) n S)
and the dimensions guarantee that p is a bijection.
I
The center Z of C(Q).
Q still is assumed non-degenerate, but the index of Q
may now again be arbitrary.
Let (el,e2, . . . ,en ) be an orthogonal basis of E, such that Q(x) = ai(xi)2, x =
xiei' eie; + e;ei = 0 if i =I- j and (ei)2 = ai, ai =I- O.
Lemma 3.3 .1 The elements (eilei2 "

An algebra is said to be central if its center is the scalar field K .
Proposition 3.3.2 If dim E = n is even and Q is non-degenerate, C(Q) is a central
algebra.
Proof. From the proof of Lemma (3.3.1) we know that in both cases an e, can be
found such that it anticommutes with an element of the basis of C(Q) different from
eo and ei; here eo stands for e0.
Let u = >.ili2 ,..imeil ei2 • • • eim E Z .
Given any v = ek1ek2. . . ekm =I- eo, let e, anticommute with v. The mappings
u -t eiu and u -t ue, are bijective, ei(ei1 • •. eim) and (e., .. . eim)ei are equal to the

CHAPTER 3
If Ca i= 0, 0 ::; a ::; v, then v =
e~lu E A. The coefficient of eo in v cannot
vanish since, up to a non-zero scalar,
e~l is equal to ea , and u -t e~lu is bijective
and permutes, up to non-zero coefficients, the elements ep ' In the proof of Lemma
(3.3.1), the existence of a e, such that e"ei = -eie", i = 1,2, . . . ,n, was established,
eie"ei = -aiel' and aiV + eivei E A, but its term in e" has vanished, whereas the
coefficient of eo still differs from O. Proceeding in this fashion, an element of A of
the form .A°eo could be found, hence eo E A and A is a trivial ideal. This yields the
Proposition 3.3.3 If dim E = n is even and Q is non-degenerate, the two-sided
ideals ofC(Q) are trivial.
Such an algebra will be called simple (d. Chapter 5). Joining Propositions (3.3.1)
and (3.3.3), we have :
Theorem 3.3.1 If dim E = n = 2r and if Q is non-degenerate, the algebra C( Q) is
simple and central.
Remarks.
If K = R we proved in section 2.1 that C(Q) is isomorphic to a matrix
algebra M1(R) or M1,(H); it is possible to prove directly, in the framework of matrix
theory, that C(Q) is simple and central. Similarly, if K = C, C'(2r) ~ M 2r(C) and
the same conclusion is valid.
The algebras C(3, 1) and C(I, 3), which are used in relativity theory, are M4(R)
and M2(H) respectively.
Clearly the results of section 3.1 can be applied to other cases, K might even be
a commutative ring and E a finite-dimensional module.
These remarks are meant for the mathematicians who read this book;
they
will also verify that the results tabulated in section 2.1 correspond, in the even-
dimensional case, to a theorem of Wedderburn on simple algebras (d. Curtis-Reiner
p. 175).
3.3.2
E is an odd-dimensional space, n = 2r + 1, and Q is non-degenerate.
Theorem 3.3.2 If dim E = 2r + 1 and if Q is non-degenerate,
1. C+(Q) is simple and central.
2. If Q is of maximum index r, C+(Q) is isomorphic to End S where S is a (2r ) _
dimensional vector space over E .
Proof. Let us consider a non-isotropic Xo E E and let (xo).L be its orthogonal com-
plement. On (xo).L we define the quadratic form Ql :

ORTHOGONAL CLIFFORD ALGEBRAS.
Ql is non-degenerate, since if z E E :
Q(z) = Q(x +y) = ao(xo)2 + Q(y)
53
if x E (xo), Y E (xo).L, so if Ql would be degenerate a decomposition of Q(x) in less
than n squares would be obtained, which is impossible.
Note that if y E (xo).L, xoY = -yxo and
By the universal property, y -+ xoY can be extended to a homomorphism v from
C(Ql) to C+(Q) : these two algebras having the same dimension and C(Qd being
simple, v is an isomorphism.
Hence C+ is a simple central algebra isomorphic to the algebra C(Ql) over a
space of dimension 2r .
To prove 2 a Witt decomposition can be used :
Ql is neutral and Proposition (3.3.1) can be applied.
I
Corollary 3.3.1 The Clifford algebra C(Q) of an odd-dimensional space E, n =
2r - 1, is isomorphic to a Clifford algebra C+(Qd of a (2r)-dimensional space E1 .
Prooi. Taking E 1 = E ffi (xo) and Ql such that Ql(XO) = a, aQl(Y) = -Q(y) for
a =f: 0, y E E, and that (xo) is orthogonal to E for Q1> the previous result can be
applied.
I
The center Z of C(Q) .
The reasoning is similar to the case n = 2r . Setting
eN = ele2 . . . en, eN is central since it commutes with all (eil ei 2 ••• ei m ) introduced in
section 3.1 and Z contains Keo ffi KeN . From now on the proof runs along the same
lines as that in 3.1, only ).0 and ).N need not vanish. We have :
Proposition 3.3.4 If dim E = n = 2r + 1 and Q is not degenerate the center of
C(Q) is Z = Keo + KeN .
Z is called the 'quadratic extension of K', considered as a ring .
The ideals of C(Q).
Let A =f: {O} be a two-sided ideal of C(Q) .
We reason as in the case where n is even, but e» behaves differently since eNei =
eieN . A similar computation proves that A contains a central element of the form
eo+ aNeN, where aN E K.

CHAPTER 3
• If (eN)2 = (-I)'IUIU2 " '0n in the notations of 3.1, where El = n(n -1)/2, is
not a square in K (i.e. (-1YD, D being the discriminant of Q, is not a square),
then
(eo+uNeN)(eO - uNeN)
A
-'-------:--~--:--:---.:.. = eo E
e~ -
u~(eN)2
and A is a trivial ideal. Then obviously Z is a field.
• If for some j E K, (eN)2 = 1/P, we take
u = eo+jeN and v = eo - jeN.
2
2
Then vu = uv = 0, u 2 = u and v2 =
Vj Z = Ku E9 Kv and Z is the direct
composition of two fields, each of which is isomorphic to K.
Furthermore, C(Q) = C(Q)uE9C(Q)v since if w E C( Q), w = weo = w(u+v) =
wu + wv and w'u = wv implies W 'U
2 = wvu and w'u = O.
If w E A, w = yu + zv , y, z E C(Q), u(yu + zv) = yu E A and v(yu + zv) =
zv E A. If zv t- 0 we repeat the reasoning used in the case where n is even
(replacing the element v of the previous proof by zv). In the formula for z, eN
is replaced by (u - v)fj and we form
Ui(ZV) + ei(zv)ei E A
eventually to establish the existence of an element .xv in Z , .x E K',
The same can be done if yu t- O.
Finally, A contains u + v = eo if both yu and zv are non-zero: then A is
trivial. Hence if A is non-trivial, it is either of the form C(Q)u or C(Q)v. And
since u and v are elements of Z, each ideal of C(Q)u is an ideal of C(Q), so
C(Q)u and C(Q)v have no proper two-sided ideals and must be simple.
This can be summarized as follows :
Proposition 3.3.5 If dimE = 2r + 1, if Q is non-degenerate and if D is the dis-
criminant of Q :
1. If (-IY D is not a square in K, C(Q) is simple and its center is a field.
2. If(-ItD is a square in K, C(Q) is the direct composition of two simple ideals :
C(Q) = C(Q)u +C(Q)v,
u 2 = U ,
v 2 = v,
uv = 0,
where u and v are central elements. The center is the direct composition of
two fields, each of which is isomorphic to K : Z = Ku E9 Kv.
For instance, if Q is positive definite (K = R), 1 applies if n = 3, (mod4) and 2
applies if n = 1, (mod4). If K = C, 2 always applies.

55
Some results valid for K = C will be summarized here; they rely on the algebraic
closedness of C. Q is assumed of maximal index.
Theorem 3.3.3
• If E is a (n = 2r )-dimensional complex vector space and ifQ is non -degenerate :
1. C(Q) is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a (2r )-dim ensional
complex vector space; C(Q) is simple and central, Z = C.
2. C +(Q) is the direct composition of two ideals , each of which is isomor-
phic to the endomorphism algebra of a (2r - 1 )-dimensional complex vector
space, so C+( Q) is the direct composition of two simple ideals.
• If E is a (n =
2r + 1)-dimensional complex vector space and if Q is non-
degenerate:
1. C+(Q) is simple and central, and it is isomorphic to the endomorphism
algebra of a (2r )-dim ensional complex vector space.
2. C (Q ) is the direct composition of two simple ideals, each of which is
isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a (2r )-dim ensional complex
vector space.
C(Q) = C(Q)u EB C(Q)v,
u 2 = u,
v 2 = V,
uv = 0
and Z = Cu + Cv = Ceo + CeN .
Both cases 1 and both cases 2 correspond by an isomorphism if the dimensions
match.
3.3.4
Degenerate Clifford algebras.
Now we will assume that the rank nl of Q is less than n. As in Chapter 1, 2.1, we
set
E = E1 EB F,
dim E, = nl,
F is the radical of (E, Q) and Q induces on E 1 a quadratic form Ql of rank nl
(Lemma (1.2.2)) .
Proposition 3.3.6 The Clifford algebra C( Q) is isomorphic to the graded tensor
product of C(Qd and /\ (F )
Proof This is a special case of formula 3 in section 1.3.
Proposition 3.3.7 If Z is the center of C(Q) :

CHAPTER 3
• Ifrk(Q) = n1 is even, Z = I\+(F) .
• If rk(Q) = n1 is odd, Z = 1\+(F) EB eNl 1\+ (F), where eNl = e1e2 . . . en 1 is the
product of the elements of an orthonormal basis for (EI , Q1)'
Proof. Every element 11. E C(Q) can be written in the form
where H, L, M, R are index sets, eu, JR, eHh, .. . are ordered products of elements
of (ei,fj), e, E E I and f; E F, aHL , bM , • • • are scalars, IHI = h1 + h2 + ... + h.,
en = eh1 eh2 ••• eh. etc. If 11. is a central element and if we multiply from the left and
from the right by Jp, then subtract, we obtain as terms involving only the (f;) :
"L,cRJRJp(l- (_l)IRIIPI),
R
which must vanish, so either CR = 0, JR is of maximal degree or JR is even . But
JR cannot be of odd maximal degree since it must commute with every et., and
L-RCRJR E I\+(F) follows.
EM bMeM must be central in C(Q1)j by the previous results on the center of a
non-degenerate Clifford algebra,
L-M bMeM E K if n1 is even,
L-M bMeM E Keo + KeNl if n1 is odd;
but the latter case cannot occur since eN1 cannot commute with Jp if IFI is odd.
We are left with central elements of the form
Given a term with even ILl, we multiply by ep from the left and from the right,
and see that aHLeH is central in C(Q1)j if n1 is even, it lies in I\+(F), if n1 is odd,
in (Keo+ KeNJ 1\+ (F).
Given a term with odd ILl, we multiply by en and see that jHI must be even. If
en does not contain e, as a factor, the multiplication by e, will lead to aHL = 0, so
eH = eNl and n1 is even, but then eNJL, ILl odd, does not commute with y E 1\-(F)
and the proof is complete.
I
The center of I\(F) is easily seen to be I\+(F) is dimF is even and N(F)+I\+(F)
if dim F = p is odd.
Also, an element of 1\(F) is invertible if and only if its zero
degree term does not vanish.

THE CLIFFORD GROUPS, THE TWISTED CLIFFORD
GROUPS AND THEIR FUNDAMENTAL SUBGROUPS.
E is an n-dimensional vector space over K with quadratic form Q. In sections 1 and
2 we will assume that Q is non-degenerate.
4.1
Clifford groups.
4.1.1
Let G be the set of invertible 9 E C(Q) such that
<pg(x) = gxg-1 E E,
"Ix E E .
Then clearly if g' E G, gg' E G; <pg is linear and injective, hence surjective and
s:' E G.
Definition 4.1.1 Tbe multiplicative group G of invertible 9 E C(Q) sucb tbat
epg(X) = gxg-1 E E,

The intersection of G and C+(Q) is called the special Clifford group G+.

5. G is tbe set of elements in C(Q) of tbe form >'X1X2 . . . Xk, where X E K* and
Xl, X2 , . . . ,Xk are non-isotropic vectors, if n is even. If n is odd, this is true for
G+, in wbicli case k must be even.
Proof.
• Clearly lpg = lp(g) is an isometry, since Q(gxg-1)= (gxg - 1)2 = gx2g-1= x2 =
Q(x). lp is a homomorphism from G to O(Q). If 9 E ker e , lpg = IdE, gx = xg,
9 E Gn Z .
• Let a E E, if Q(a) = 0, a2 = 0 and a is not invertible in C(Q). If Q(a) =J 0,
the inverse of a is a(Q(a))-l and

hence a E EnG and -lp(a) is the symmetry relative to a.L.
• If n is even and U E O(Q), then u is a product U1U2 .. .Uh, the Ui being
symmetries relative to hyperplanes (X1).L ,(X2).L, . . . , (Xh).L, where the Xi are
non-isotropic vectors (Chapter 1,3.1). Write
U1 = - lp(X1),"" Uh = -lp(Xh),
9 = X1 X2 · · .Xh,
lp(g) = (-1 )hU1U2 . . .Uh = (- 1)hu.
If h is even, 9 E G+ and lp(G+) :2 SO(Q). If the dimension is even, eN =
e1e2 .. . en anticommutes with all x E E , lp(eN) = - IdE. If h is odd, lp(gen ) =
U, so
lp(G) = O(Q) .
We only have to verify that lp(G+) ~ SO(Q). If uE O(Q) \ SO(Q), h is odd
and if atE G+ would exist for which lp(t) = U = lp(geN) then geNr1 E Z,
but since Z = K, this is impossible, as geNr1 E C-(Q).
• If n is odd, the previous reasoning shows that
lp(G+) :2 SO(Q).
(- IdE) is an element of O(Q) \ SO(Q) and every element of O(Q) is generated
by (- IdE) and SO(Q). SO we only have to verify that (- IdE) is not an element
of lp(G).
If for some t E G, txr1 = -x, "Ix E E, teir1 = -ei would imply teNr1 =
-eN, but this contradicts the fact that eN E Z .
The results on the kernels are obvious. Finally, 5 is a consequence of the previous

4.1.2
Reduced Clifford groups.
Lemma 4.1.1 Let [3 be the main anti-automorphism of G(Q) .
Then vs E G+,
[3(g)g E K· and N : 9 ~ [3(g)g is a homomorphism from G+ to K·.
Proof. If x E E and 9 E G, x' = gxg- 1 is invariant under [3 :
[3(x') =[3(g-l)[3(X)[3(g)
so [3(G) = G and [3(G+) = G+ . <p([3(g)g) = IdE, so [3(g)g E Z, but if 9 E G+, as
Z+ = K, [3(g)g E K· .
N(gg') = [3(gg')gg' = [3(g')[3(g )gg' = N(g )N(g').
Note that if n = 2r, Z = K and the lemma holds for 9 E G.
Definition 4.1.2 If 9 E G+ or if 9 E G with n = 2r, the scalar
N(g) = (3(g)g
is called the spin norm on g.
I
Definition 4.1.3 The kernel Go of N in G+ is called the special reduced Clifford
group, it is the set of 9 E G+ such that [3(g)g = 1. If n is even , the kernel Go of N
in G is called the reduced Clifford group, Gt= Go n G+(Q).
4.1.3
Spin groups.
• Assume that n = 2r.
Definition 4.1.4 The subgroup of 9 E G for which N(g) =
±1 is called
Pin(Q) and the intersection Pin(Q) n G+(Q) is called Spin(Q).
In the real case (which is by far the most important), we have that :
- If Q is positive definite, as 9 = AXIX2 . . . Xk , [3(g)g > 0 hence
Spin(Q) = Gt c c; = Pin(Q).
- If Q is negative definite,
Spin(Q) = Gt = Go C Pin(Q).
- If Q is indefinite ,
Gt c Go C Pin(Q),
Gt C Spin(Q).

THE CLIFFORD GROUPS.
Clearly, ep(Pin(Q)) = O(Q), ep(Spin(Q)) = SO(Q) and ker e = ±1.
• Assume that n = 2r + 1.
61
Definition 4.1.5 The subgroup of 9 E G+ such that N(g) = ±1 is called
Spin(Q).
In the real case :
- If Q is definite : Gt = Spin(Q).
- If Q is indefinite: Go C Spin(Q).
ep(Spin(Q)) = O(Q) and the kernel of ep is ±1.
Whenever ker ep is discrete, we will say that sp is a covering.
4.2
Twisted Clifford groups or Clifford a-groups.
4.2.1
The groups introduced this far do not allow to reach the whole of O(Q) if n is odd.
Therefore new definitions are in order.
Definition 4.2.1 If a is the main automorphism of C(Q), the group of invertible
elements 9 E G such that a(g)xg- 1 E E, Vx E E , is called the Clifford a-group f .
We also define f+ = I' n C+(Q).
Let Pg(x) = a(g)xg- 1 = x' E E, then
so x 2 = X,2 and p(g) = Pg is an element of O(Q). Clearly p is then a representation
of r in O(Q).

9 = xI X2 · · · Xh satisfies p(g) = u. Then p(f) = O(Q) and p(f+) = SO(Q).
What is the kernel of p ? If U E kerp, a(u)x = xu, Vx E E and if u = u+ + u-,
u+x = xu+ and u-x = -xu-.
Let (ei) be an orthogonal basis of E j in the basis (ei1 ei2 • • • e,...) of C(Q), we will
distinguish the elements involving el and those where el does not occur as a factor.

62
CHAPTER 4
u + = Vo + elvl where Vo and VI are linear combinations of elements in which el does
not occur.
u+el = elu+ implies that
and VI must vanish.
Replacing el by
e2 , . . . ,en, we see that u+ E K·.
Similarly,
u- = Wo + elWl , U-el = -elU- leads to Wo + elwl = Wo -
elWl and WI = 0 so that
u- = 0 since K· et C-(Q).
Finally, we see that u E K·. Furthermore, r is the set of (>.XIX2 . .. Xk) such that
Q(Xi) -# 0 and>. E K., whereas I'" is obtained in the same way, restricting k to even
values.
We can formulate the
Theorem 4.2.1 Ifpg(x) = o:(g)xg-1 , X E E, 9 E I' :
1. P is a representation of I' in O(Q) whose kernel is K · and p(r+) = SO(Q).
2. If a, Q(a) -# 0, is an element of E, p(a) is the symmetry relative to (a).l.
3. r is the set ofelements in C(Q) of the form >'XIX2 . . . Xk, Xi being a non-isotropic
vector, i = 1,2, . . . ,k, >. E K·, and I'" is obtained by the even k ,
4. I' = G ifn is even, I'" = G+ ifn is odd.
Note that if n is odd, reG. Indeed, >'XIX2 .. . Xk E G but>. + J.LeN = I where >.
and J.L are non -zero and I is invertible, is an element of G but not of r in general.
Spin o:-groups or twisted spin groups.
Lemma 4.2.1 For every 9 E r, {3(o:(g))g = &(g) is a scalar and
&(gg') = &(g)&(g').
Proof. This can be verified by an analogous computation to that of Lemma (4.1.1) ,
or directly by Theorem (4.2.1, part 3).
I
Note that when both are defined, N(g) = ±&(g).
Definition 4.2.2 The subgroup of elements 9 E I' such tbat &(g) = ±1 is called
PinQ(Q) and its subgroup PinQ(Q) n C+(Q) is called SpinQ(Q).
If n is even, PinQ(Q) = Pin(Q) and SpinQ(Q) = Spin(Q). If n is odd, Spin(Q) =
SpinQ(Q). Although <p and p only coincide on r+ = G+ we will use the notations
Pin(Q) and Spin]Q) regardless of the parity of n . This will not cause confusion; but
if n is odd it should be noted that Pin(Q) is a subgroup of r.

THE CLIFFORD GROUPS.
63
4.2.2
The torogonal spin groups.
Let us assume that E is real and let E', Q' and C(Q') be the complexified versions
of E, Q and C(Q).
Definition 4.2.3 The multiplicative group ofinvertible9 E C( Q') such that pg(x) =
a(g)xg- 1 E E , Vx E E and IN(g)1= 1 is called the torogonal group Tor(Q). Also,
Tor+(Q) is defined as Tor(Q) n C +(Q').
Clearly p(Tor(Q)) = O(Q) and p(Tor+(Q)) = SO(Q). The kernel of p can be
determined using the same method as for I', it satisfies kerp = Sl = U(l), and
Tor(Q) is the set of elements in C(Q') of the form
Since we can simultaneously replace Xi by -Xi and>. by ->. in the previous factor-
ization, we write
Tor(Q) = s: x Z2 Pin(Q).
This factorization justifies the name of reduced enlarged spin group 1 , its elements
can be written as
9 = exp( iOh,
'Y E Pin(Q),
0 E R.
4.2.3
The algebras C(Q) and C(- Q ) and their associated groups.
In Chapter 3, 2 above it was shown that the algebras corresponding to Q and - Q
have, in general, different structures: although C(8k, 0) and C(O, 8k) are both simple
real matrix algebras, and C(8k +4,0) and C(O, 8k +4) are both simple quaternion
matrix algebras, all other pairs of algebras where Q is positive definite and -Q
therefore negative definite, have a different structure.
Definition 4.2.4 Let F and G be graded algebras and let f : F -+ G be a degree-
preserving linear mapping such that for all pairs aI, a2 of F, whose degrees are PI
and P2,
Then f is called a left graded algebra homomorphism.
Proposition 4.2.1 There exists a left isomorphism from the Z2-graded algebra
C(Q) to the Z2-graded algebra C( -Q).
1Later on, we will introduce enlarged spin groups where 51 is replaced by c·.
We could also
define the subgroup pin(Q) of elements 9 E Tor(Q) such that N (g) = 1 (cf. J. Popovici).

CHAPTER 4
Proof. Consider P_Q : E -t C(-Q), then (p_Q(x))2 = -Q(x). Extend P_Q to a
mapping v : Q9(E ) -+ C(-Q), by
V(Xl Q9 X2 Q9 . . . Q9 Xh) = p-Q(xd Q9 P_Q(X2)' "
Q9 P-Q(Xh)( _1)[h/2],
[h/2] being the integer part of h/2. Then v is a naturally defined left homomorphism
as can be verified ifthe parity of [(h+h')/2]- [h/2]- [h'/2] is proved equal to that
of hh'.
Since v(x Q9 x - Q(x)) = -(p-Q(x))2 - Q(x) = 0, by a reasoning similar to
that used to prove the universal property, v will give rise to a mapping from C(Q) to
C(- Q) which will be a left homomorphism and, due to the dimensions, is necessarily
an isomorphism.
I
Corollary 4.2.1 C+(Q) and C+( -Q) are isomorphic (in the usual sense) .
Proof. This is a direct consequence of their definition.
I
Corollary 4.2.2 The underlying sets of r(Q) and I'( -Q) can be identified and the
groups r(Q) and r(-Q) are isomorphic.
Proof. This follows from Theorem (4.2.1, part 3) and the isomorphism from r+(Q)
to r+(-Q) follows from Corollary (4.2.1).
I
4.3
Degenerate Clifford groups.
4.3.1
We use the notations of Chapter 3, 3.4. The rank of Q is nl < nand E = El EB F
where dimEl = nl and F is the radical of (E, Q). Q induces a quadratic form Ql
of rank nl on Eli its associated symmetric bilinear form will be written Bl .
The definition of the twisted Clifford group r is the same as in section (4.2) .
Proposition 4.3.1 P is a homomorphism from I' to the monoid O(E, Q) of isome-
tries of (E, Q) whose kernel is the set /\(F)* of invertible elements in /\(F) .
Proof. One easily sees that /\(F)* is a subset of kerp. The computation of this kernel
is completely similar to the non-degenerate case, all other statements are obvious. I
Proposition 4.3.2 p is a homomorphism onto the group E of isometries of (E, Q)
whose restriction to F is the identity.

THE CLIFFORD GROUPS.
65
Proof. Indeed, p(g) is clearly injective, so it is an isomorphism of E, which obviously
has to be an element of E. We will prove that p(r) = E.

Choosing al for which Q(ad i= 0, any element of O( Ql) can be obtained by
the composition of such symmetries; more precisely, if (ek) is an orthogonal basis
of (El , Ql) and if (1;) is an arbitrary basis of F, agE I' can be found such that
pg(e.) = L:k afek and pg(Ji) = Ji, where the matrix (an corresponds to an isometry

For fixed s we

If we compose these transformations of 9 and "t, the result is obtained, since

Spin groups.
As before, considering the center of C(Q) leads to N(g) = [3(a(g))g E I\+(F)' and
N(gg') = N(g )N(g').
Note that v E 1\(F)' need not be reduced to a scalar, even if N(v) E K', so that
to consider only the elements for which N(g) = ±1 does not necessarily lead to a
discrete kerp. Therefore we introduce the following
Definition 4.3.1 Let 0 be the normal subgroup of elements if r which have the
form a +u, where a E (K·)2, and u E 1\(F) is of non-zero degree. Then the quotient
group riO will be called Pin(Q).
Taking the quotient, p : r -> ~ gives a p: Pin(Q) -> ~ for which ker(p) = {-I, I}.
By Proposition (4.3.3), every element of Pin(Q) is a product
Here k is even if an element of Spin(Q) is considered.
Remark.
We could define the quotient group r = rib., where b. is the invariant
subgroup of elements of the form 1+u, u E 1\(F) being of non-zero degree, to obtain
from N a mapping N from rib. to I\(F)Ib.. Then Pin(Q) would be defined by
elements 9 such that N(g) = ±1.

SPINORS AND SPIN REPRESENTATIONS.
5.1
Notions on the representations of associative algebras and on semi-
simple rings.
5.1.1
Representations of an associative algebra A.
Definitions.
Let A be an associative algebra on the commutative field K (R or C), K ~ A. 1£
E :f:. 0 is a vector space, a homomorphism p from A to End E which maps the unit
element of A to IdE is called a representation of A in E .
The degree of the representation is the dimension of E . The addition in E and
the mapping A x E
-+ E : (a, x)
-+ p(a)x turn E into a A-module called the
representation module.
Conversely, if A is an algebra over K and if E is an A-
module, E is a vector space over K and if a E A, the mapping 'Y : a -+ 'Yo, with
'Ya(x) = ax, x E E, is a homomorphism from A to End E, so it is a representation of
AinE.
Therefore the study of A-modules is equivalent to that of the representations of
A.
p(a)(x) will often be written a.x, a * x or ax.
A representation p is said to be faithful if the kernel of p is zero : p(a)x = 0,
Vx E E should imply that a = O. In general the kernel of p, which is the set of a E A
such that a.x = 0, Vx E E, is also called the annihilator of its module.
A representation p is said to be simple or irreducible if the only invariant sub-
spaces of p(a), Va E A, are E and {OJ. This also means that the representation
module is simple, i.e. it has no proper submodule.
A representation is called semi-simple or completely reducible if its module is
semi-simple, i.e. it is the direct sum of simple modules. This also means that E is
the direct sum of subspaces which are globally invariant under p(a), Va EA.
Equivalence of two representations. Two A-modules E and E I , whose exterior
multiplications will be written . and *, are isomorphic if there exists a bijection ep
from E to E I such that

ep(x + x') = ep(x) + ep(x') and
ep(a.x)=a*ep(x),
VaEA,
Vx,x'EE.
Accordingly, two representations are called equivalent if their modules are iso-
morphic, which amounts to the existence of a K-linear isomorphism ep from E to E'
such that ep 0 p(a) = p'(a) 0 ep, Va E A, or
p'(a) = ep 0 p(a) 0 ip-1.
If dim E = n , then dim E' = n .
5.1.2
Simple A-modules.
We will only assume that A is a ring with unit.
1. For the module M over A, to be simple just means that M = Ax for all z =f 0,
since Ax is a submodule of M containing x = Lx; a simple module is therefore
generated by a single x =f O.
2. As being the module obtained from A under left multiplication, a left ideal J
of A can be identified to a submodule of As and vice versa. This ideal is said
to be maximal if it differs from A and if it is not part of any other proper left
ideal in A. As/J is simple if and only if J is maximal, for if J' ;2 J is another
left ideal, As/ J' ~ As/ J.
3. If M is simple, the annihilator J of x I- 0 is a maximal left ideal of A. Indeed,
ep : a --+ ax has the left ideal J as kernel, but As/J = M and M is simple.
Conversely, every left maximal ideal of A is the annihilator of some element
of a simple A-module : As/J is simple if J is maximal, by 1, As/J = Aao,
denoting by ao the equivalence class of Qo modulo L; we can take ao = I since
if 1 E J, J is trivial. Then AsjJ = AJ and aJ = 0 if and only if c.I = a E J .
5.1.3
Semi-simple modules.
Let us consider a module obtained as the direct sum of simple modules.
Lemma 5.1.1 Let M = (f)iE1Mi where M, is simple. If N is a submodule of M,
there exists a subset J of I such that
and a semi-simple supplement to N in M can therefore be found .
Proof We have that M = N + L,iEIMi. Now define HI = N, H2 = N + MI =
HI + M I , Hk+I = H k + Mk · Then Hk n Mk is a submodule of Mk so it is either zero
or identical to Mk . If the intersection is Mk , Hk+I = H k + Mk = H k and Hk+I can
be deleted; if the intersection is zero, Hk+I is kept.

CHAPTER 5
Lemma 5.1.2 Every submodule and every quotient module of a semi-simple module
are semi-simple.
Proof. Let M be the direct sum of the Mi, i E I, which are simple. If M = N EB F
where F = EBjEJMj, M = G EB F where G = EBirpMi. N ~ M/F and G ~ M/F
so N is isomorphic to G and must be semi-simple. Since M / N = F, every quotient
module is semi-simple.
I
Corollary 5.1.1 If M is a direct sum of simple modules (Mi)iEI, every simple sub-
module of M is isomorphic to one of the Mi.
Proposition 5.1.1 The decomposition of a semi-simple module as a direct sum of
simple modules is unique up to order and isomorphisms.
Proof. Let M = MI EB .. . EB Mk = NI EB .. . EB Nl and assume that k ~ l.
We will prove by induction that
where NI ~ M I , ... , N, ~ Mj , 0 ~ j
~ k.
If we already know that
M is the direct sum of
and some Np , where p :::: i, by Lemma (5.1.1) . Comparing the last two decompo-
sitions of M, we get Mj = EBp?jNp, so EBNp reduces to a single term which we will
write as N, and the proposition follows.
I
Definition 5.1.1 If N is a simple A-module, let>' be the class of A-modules iso-
morphic to N : the sum of the terms in EBiEIM, which are isomorphic to N are
called the isotypic component of type>. of the semi-simple module M . If all Mi are
isomorphic, M is said to be isotypic.
5.1.4
Semi-simple rings.
We will first prove the
Lemma 5.1.3 The following are equivalent :
1. As is semi-simple.
2. Every A-module M is semi-simple.

Proof. Let
A~I) be the direct sum of a fam ily of modules indexed by I, all of which
are equal to A•. Each x E A~I) can be written uniquely as
To this element we will associateL:iEI eiai, if ai, i E I are a set of generators for the
module M . A homomorphism u will be defined from
A~I) to M such that its kernel
is the submodule N of elements in A~I) for which L: f,iai = OJ then M ~ A~I)/ N . If
A. is semi-simple, A~I) is semi-simple, hence M is semi-simple (by Lemma (5.1.2)).
1 is a special case of 2.
•
A ring for which 1 or 2 holds is called semi-simple.
Proposition 5.1.2 If A is a semi-simple ring and if J is a left ideal of A, tbere
exists an idempotent element e E J sucb tbat J = Ae = J e.
Proof. Let J' be the supplement to J in A, then J' is semi-simple by Lemma (5.1.1).
1 = e + e' for some e E J, e' E P , so Vx E J, x = z e + z e', xe E J , »e' E J' and
x = xe and xe' = 0 follow. (In particular, eel = 0). From this we can deduce e2 = e,
J = J e and Ae ~ J = J e ~ Ae implies J = Ae.
•
Proposition 5.1.3 Let A be a semi-simple ring, tben tbe isotypic components of A
can be identified witb tbe minimal two-sided ideals of A . Every two-sided ideal of A
is tbe direct composition of minimal two-sided ideals.
Proof. M = As, M). being the isotypic component of type X, M). is a two-sided ideal.
If 6b is the right multiplication by b in A, e5b is an endomorphism of A, and e5b(M). )
is isomorphic to a quotient of M)., hence it is part of M). and M). is a two-sided ideal.
If a two-sided ideal N contains M i , which is of type .A, M i =
Ae where e is
idempotent and N must contain all M j of type A.
Indeed, M j being of type A must be isomorphic to Mi by an isomorphism r.p :
r.p(x) = r.p(xe) = xr.p(e) = xb,
b = r.p(e),
z E Mi.
M j = {xb,x E Mi }
~ N .
Every two-sided ideal is a submodule of As, hence it is the sum of some sim-
ple submodules such as Mij every two-sided ideal is therefore the sum of isotypic
components and it is minimal if it is itself isotypic.
One easily verifies that the composition is direct : if A, = ElhiM ).i where the M).i

CHAPTER 5
Proposition 5.1.4 Every simple module on a semi-simple ring A is isomorphic to
a minimal left ideal of A.
Proof. Indeed, every simple A-module is isomorphic to a quotient of As d. section
1.2, hence to a simple submodule of A, since As is semi-simple.
•
5.1.5
Simple rings.
Proposition 5.1.5 Let A be semi-simple, then the following are equivalent:
1. All simple A-modules are isomorphic.
2. The semi-simple A-module As is isotypic.
3. A and (0) are the only two-sided ideals of A
Such a ring is called simple .
Proof. Clearly 1 implies 2 and 2 and 3 are equivalent by Proposition (5.1.1) . 1 follows
from 2 by Proposition (5.1.4) since every simple A-module is isomorphic to a minimal
left ideal of A, i.e, to a simple submodule of A" so there exists only one type.
•
5.1.6
The radical.
Definition 5.1.2 A maximal submodule of M is a submodule which differs from
M and is not contained in any other submodule than M . The radical of M is the
intersection of all maximal submodules of M .
If A is a ring, the radical of A, written n(A), is the radical of As, i.e. the intersection
of all maximal left ideals in A.
Lemma 5.1.4 The radical of A is a two-sided ideal, either zero or proper.
Proof. a E n(A) means that a belongs to all maximal left ideals of A, so it lies in
the annihilator of each element x#-O of each simple A-module; a is therefore an
element of the annihilator of each simple left A-module. But the annihilator of an
A-module is a two-sided ideal, so the radical is the intersection of two-sided ideals
and therefore itself a two-sided ideal.
I
Proposition 5.1.6 Every finite-dimensional algebra A over K whose radical is zero,
is semi-simple.

SPINORS AND SPIN REPRESENTATIONS.
73
Proof. Let A. be a finite-dimensional space over K .
Consider the set £ of submodules which are the intersection of a finite number
of maximal submodules of A•. The elements of £ are also vector spaces; let R be
an element of maximal dimension and let N be a maximal submodule of A•. Since
N n R ~ R by the defining property for R, N n R = R, so R ~ N for all maximal
N, which can only hold if R = 0 and therefore n(A) = O.
Hence there exists a finite family Mi , 1 SiS p of maximal submodules of A.
whose intersection is not zero. Let rpi : x E A. ---+ rpi(x) E A./M; be the canonical
homomorphism, then n i(rp.) is an injective homomorphism from As to ni(As/Mi)
where
p
p
II rpi : x ---+ (rp1(X), . .. ,rpp(x)) E I1(As/Mi),

i=1
since ni(rpi)(X) = n. rpi(X') implies that z - x' E Mi, i = 1,2, . . . ,p and z = z' ,
M, being maximal, As/Mi is simple, hence nf=1(As/Mi) is semi-simple and
n.(rpi) being an injective homomorphism, A. is semi-simple.
I
Corollary 5.1.2 A finite-dimensional algebra over the field K is a simple ring if
and only if it has no proper two-sided ideals.
Proof. This follows from the previous results and from the definition of simple rings. I
This corollary justifies the terminology of Chapter 3, where a Clifford algebra
was defined to be simple if its two-sided ideals were trivial.
5.1.7
Some results on the idempotent elements of semi-simple rings.
1. We have proved that if A is a semi-simple ring and if J is one of its left ideals,
there exists an idempotent element e E J such that
J = Ae = Je,
x = xe,
z E J.
Note that the same left ideal can be determined by several different idempotent
elements. A non-trivial example of this fact will be given in the Clifford algebra
(Chapter 8, 1.2).
2. From the proof of Proposition (5.1.2), we know that if A is the direct sum oftwo
left ideals J and J', there exist idempotent elements e and e' (J' = Ae' = J'e')
such that
e + e' = 1,
e2 = e,
(e')2 = e'
ee' = e'e = 0
and this result can be extended to any direct sum :

H
CHAPTER 5
e1+e2+ . . . +ele=1,
{ei)2=ei'
eie;= e;ei =0,
i,j=1,2, . . . ,k, itj
with a similar proof. Such a set (ell e2, .. . ,ele) is called an orthogonal system
of idempotent elements.
This system allows to express any element x E A uniquely in the form
3. If J is a left ideal of A and e is an idempotent element of it , J is a direct sum
of minimal left ideals J1, J2 , • • • , 1,. If we define
e1 = e1e, by 1, since x = :z:e for :z: E J,
J1 , J2 , • •• , J, being left ideals, the uniqueness of the decomposition implies that
The same holds for e2, .. . ,e, so that
e, being an idempotent element of Ji.
4. A is now clearly seen to be the direct sum of two-sided ideals J1 , J2 , • • • , JIe if
and only if 1 = e1 + e2 +...+ ele and the idempotent elements determining
the J; are in the center of A. For Clifford algebras, we have encountered this
situation in Chapter 3, 3.2.
Definition 5.1.3 An idempotent element e is called primitive if no decomposition
e = e' + e" exists, where (e')2 = e', (e"? = e" and e'e" = e"e' = O.
Proposition 5.1.7 If e is primitive, Ae is a minimal ideal.
Conversely, if J is a
minimal ideal, every idempotent element of J is primitive.
Proof. If J is not minimal, and J = Ae, ideals J1 , J2 , . • • , J, can be found as before in
3. Then for e' = e1 and e" = e2+ ... + e" {e')2 = e', (e")2 = e" and e'e" = e"e' = O.
If J is minimal and if J = Ae where e = e' + e" as in the definition, then Vx E A,
:z: = xe' + xe", the sum being direct (since xe' = ye" implies xe'e" = ye" = 0). So
Ae' and Ae" are non-trivial left ideals in J, which is a contradiction.

Proposition 5.1.8 J = Ae is a minimal left ideal (or, equivalently, e is primitive),
if and only if eAe is a (possibly non-commutative) field.
We will need the
Lemma 5.1.5 Let A be a ring with unit, A =I 0 whose left ideals are trivial. Then
A is a field, and vice versa.
Proof Let A be a field and J one of its left ideals, J =I O. There exists an a E J
such that a =I 0; then z = (xa-l)a E J, "Ix EA.
Conversely, let x E A, z =I 0, then the left ideal Ax contains x and must therefore
be equal to A . Then x' E A can be found for which x'x = 1, x' =I O. Replacing
x by x' , an element e" is found such that XliX' = 1.
Now x" = xl/x'x = x and
x'x = xx' = 1, proving that A is a field.
I
Proof of the proposition. If J = Ae is a minimal left ideal, let JI be a non-zero left
ideal of eAe (which is a subring with unit).
AJI <;;; AeJe <;;; J e = J.
AJI is a left ideal of A , contained in J, so J = AJI .
eAe = eJ = eAJI = eAeJI <;;; JI ,
from which eAe = JI follows, JI being a subset of eAe by assumption. The only left
ideals of eAe are therefore eAe and (0), so by the lemma, eAe is a field.
Conversely, if J is not minimal,
yields a decomposition
e = el + e2,
el = ele = eel , e2 = e2e = ee2 by 3 above ; el = eej e, e2 = ee2e, but ele2 = 0 proves
that eAe cannot be a field.
I
Proposition 5.1.9 Let J and J' be minimal left ideals : J = Ae, J' = Ae' where e
and e' are primitive. Then these left ideals are isomorphic if and only if J' = J a' for
some nonzero a' E JI.
Proof If J' = Ja', z -+ xa' clearly is an isomorphism from J to J'. Conversely, if sp
is an isomorphism, ep(xe) = xep(e) for all z in A .
But xe = x if x E J and hence ep(x) = xep(e). Setting a' = ep(e), J' = J a'
follows.
I
Remarks.
Ja' is a left ideal of A , Ja' <;;; J'. Ja' = J' by the minimality of J', so J
is isomorphic to J' is and only if J J' = J' .

76
CHAPTER 5
From <p(x) = x<p(e), it follows that <p(e) = al = eo' and al = eale/j every isomor-
phism from J to JI therefore corresponds to
Y ---t yexoel,
Xo E A,
exoel i:. 0
since aiel = xoel, Xo E A .
Note that 'isomorphism' in this context means A-isomorphism .
There also exists abE J such that J = Jib , hence J = J alb. J = Ae contains
an invertible element z, eAe being a field, hence z = zo'b, alb = 1, b = ai-lor
JI = al - 1J al so that J1 is the image of J under an inner automorphism.
If e
l and e are two primitive idempotents determining isomorphic ideals, a u E
C(Q)* can be found such that e' = ueu-1 .
Proposition 5.1.10 If A is an algebra over K = C and if e is a primitive idempo-
tent, the set of exe, z E A, is Ceo
Proof. If f is a homomorphism from the A-module V to the A-module Wand if
both V and Ware simple, either f is zero, or it is an isomorphism (this is called
the Schur Lemma). Indeed, only two cases can occur : kerf
= V, im f
= 0 or
ker f = 0, imf = W . If V = W, u is a homomorphism of the A-module V and .A
is an eigenvalue of u, u -
.A Id = U1 is again a homomorphism of V but cannot be
injective, hence U1 = 0 and
u = .A Id .
Applying a remark above to the right multiplication by eze, e = el and J = JI, the
proposition follows.
I
5.2
Spin representations.
Using the notations of Chapter 3, 3.3, we have obtained for non-degenerate Q, if
dim E = n, that
• If n = 2r, C(Q) is a simple algebra.
• If n = 2r + 1, C(Q) is either simple or semi-simple.
The most interesting case for applications occurs when K = C.
The reader may
consult Theorem (3.3.3) where this situation is summarized.
5.2.1
The spinors for n = 2r and K = C.
All representations considered here will be of finite dimension, i.e. they involve finite-
dimensional vector spaces only.
By 1.5, all irreducible representations of C( Q) are equivalent, and C( Q) being
simple, they are all faithful.

SPINORS AND SPIN REPRESENTATIONS.
77
The representation of C(Q) in a (2r )-dimensional space S , constructed in Propo-
sition (3.3.1), is irreducible, since p(C(Q)) = End S. Hence all irreducible represen-
tations of C(Q) are of degree 2r .
The elements of S are called spinors (their dependence on C(Q) being implicit).
We generally use the 'standard' representation p given in Chapter 3 :
E = FEBF'
being a Witt decomposition, F and F' are maximal totally isotropic subspaces,
(Xl, X2, ···, Xr, YI,Y2,·· ·, Yr) is a 'special' Witt basis, where
B(Xi' Yi) =
~Oij,
B(Xi' Xi) = B(Yi' Yi) = 0,
XiYj +YjXi = Oij.
Setting f = YIY2 ... Yr, S is the minimal left ideal of C( Q) generated by the
and by x0f = f .
The representation p is given by
p(u)vf = uu],
u E C(Q).
Remark.
Observe that (1)2 = 0, so f is not an idempotent; nevertheless, if we
put:
and
e = l'f is a primitive idempotent and corresponds to the minimal left ideal under
consideration.
p induces a representation on C+( Q), denoted by p+, and representations p of
the group G, p+ of G+, Po of Go, pt of Gt and, in general, of all spin groups.
Semi-spinors.
C+( Q) is semi-simple, but not simple, by the results of Chapter 3,
3. p+ is the direct sum of two non-equivalent irreducible representations.
This follows from Proposition (3.3.1, part 2), C+(Q) being the direct composition
of two simple ideals, each of which is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of a
(2r - 1)-dimensional complex vector space, in agreement with Proposition (5.1.3).
The representation spaces are C+( Q)f and C-(Q)f. The elements of the repre-
sentation spaces of irreducible representations of C+(Q) are called semi-spinors. As
a special case, S+ = C+(Q)f and S- = C-(Q)f are serni-spinor spaces.
Spin representations of G, G+ and Gt.
A representation of a group is defined to
be a homomorphism from that group into the isomorphism group of a vector space .

78
CHAPTER 5
For the groups under consideration here, the group operation is induced by the
multiplication in the algebra, so the representations of C(Q) induce representations
of the groups related to it .
The spin representation of G = r induced by p is simple.
Indeed, since every non-isotropic vector of E is an element of G and since Q is
non-degenerate, E is generated by EnG and C(Q) is, as an algebra, generated by
elements of G, proving the statement.
The spin representation of G+ = I'" induced by p is the direct sum of two non-
equivalent irreducible representations.
As an algebra, C+( Q) is generated by products of even numbers of non-isotropic
elements of E, hence C+(Q) is, as an algebra, generated by G+, the representations
are therefore irreducible. If the representations were equivalent as group representa-
tions, this would extend to C+( Q) and contradict their non -equivalence as algebra
representations.
Similar results hold for Po and pt, since one can assume that for the elements
el, e2, .. . , en of an orthonormal basis, Q(ei) = 1, so that C(Q) is generated, as an
algebra, by elements of Go.
Important remark.
If K = R and if Q is of maximal index, all these results
remain valid, except for those on Go and Gt .
5.2.2
The spinors for n = 2r +1 and K = C.
Knowing that C+(Q ) is simple, we choose a (2r )-dimensional space S from the Witt
decomposition

is (2r )-dimensional and linearly isomorphic to C+(Q)f.
Let i be the isomorphism
from C+(Q) to C(Ql) (d. Chapter 3,3.2), Ql being (up to a non -zero factor) the
metric induced by Q on F EfJ F', then we define the representation p+ by
p+(u)(vJ) = i(u)vf,

The induced representations of r+ = G+ and Gt can be pro ved simple as in the
even case.
There are exactly two different extensions of the spin representation of C+(Q) in
S to an irreducible representation of C(Q ) in S.
The center Z of C(Q) is generated by eo = 1 and by an odd element z for which
Z2 E K (z is, up to a non-zero factor, eN = ele2 '" en)'
We can assume that z2 = 1.

injective since z2 = 1.
The linear mappings ep : U -t Ul + U2 and epl : Ul - U2 are homomorphisms from
C(Q) to C+(Q) and the mappings
p = p+ 0 ep,
pI = p+ 0 epl
are therefore irreducible representations of C(Q) extending p+ .
We will now prove their uniqueness up to equivalence.
If PI is a representation of C(Q) extending p+ and if z is as before, we define
a = Pl(Z).
a 2 is the identity on 5 since z2 = 1 and a commutes with all operators in p+(C+(Q)),
Z being a central element of C(Q).
a 2 being the identity, 5 is the direct sum of the space 51 of elements W such
that a(w) = wand of the space 52 of elements such WI such that a(w l ) = -WI . By
the commutation property, these spaces are invariant under p+(C+(Q)). p+ being
simple, one of the 51, 52 must be 5 and the other, O. Hence a = ± Id and PI coincides
with one of the representations given before, since
These two representations are non-equivalent, since if
P'(U) = 1/J 0 p(u) 0 1/J-l,
pl(Z) = 1/J 0 p(z) 01/J-l or - Id = 1/J 0 Ido1/J-l = Id, which is impossible. These repre-
sentations induce representations of G and I'; they are called the spin representations
of C(Q), G and f .
5.2.3
The spinors in the real case.
We will use the table in Chapter 3, 2.1 and the classical fact that the matrix algebras
Mn(R), Mn(K) and Mn(H) are simple.
Under these conditions, one sees that it is sufficient to consider the values of
p - q (mod 8), independently of p + q.
Simple computations lead to the conclusion that, 5 being an irreducible repre-
sentation space of C( Q), if p - q = 0,1,2 (mod 8), dimR(5) = 2[n/2] where [.J stands
for the integer part, whereas if p - q = 3,4,5,6,7 (mod 8), dimR(5) = 2[n/2]+I .
Take for example the Minkowski space El,3 with orthogonal basis eo, el, e2, e3,
(eo)2 = 1, (e;)2 = -1, i = 1,2,3.
p - q = 6 (mod 8) so dimR(5) = 8 (note that for E3,1' dimR(5) = 4).

The elements e = (1 +eo)/2, e' = (1 +eoe3)/2, e" = (1 + ele2e3)/2 are primitive
idempotents : it can be easily verified that C(Q)e, C(Q)e' and C(Q)e" are eight-
dimensional or, equivalently, that eue, e'ue' and e/'ue" belong to a field, Vu E C(Q).
The most natural spin representation is given by the left multiplication.
The
algebra being simple, all three left ideals found are minimal and C(Q)-isomorphic.
Now consider the real space E2,l with a pseudo-metric of signature (2,1) and an
orthogonal basis (el' e2, e3) :
The elements et =
(1 + et}(1 + e2e3)/4, eII =
(1 + e2)(1 + ele3)/4, em =
(1 - el)(l - e2e3) and erv = (1 - e2)(1 - ele3) are easily seen to be an orthogonal
system of primitive idempotents (d. 1.7). If A, B = I , I I, I I I or IV ,
(eA? = eA,
LeA = 1,
eAeB+ eBeA = O.
A
Then S is two-dimensional and
Since p - q = 1, the algebra C(2,1) is the direct composition of two simple four-
dimensional ideals. By Chapter 3, 3.2, idempotent elements u , v can be chosen
such that C(Q) = C(Q)u EEl C(Q)Vj u = et + elY, v = eII + em, (u and v are not
primitive). The results on semi-simple algebras are thus confirmed.
Important remark.
In the Minkowski space, we found three idempotent elements
e, e' and e" from which three families of idempotent elements can be deduced if we
apply inner automorphisms to them,
e -+ ueu-t,
u E C(3, 1)*.
It is important to distinguish the inner automorphisms for which u E G or some
other Clifford or spin group . Indeed, there cannot be au E G such that e' = ueu- l ,
and no such relation can be found between any pair of e, e', e".
The situation is quite different for the idempotent elements eA in C(2 , 1). The
following definitions are therefore in order.
5.2.4
Algebraic and geometric equivalence.
Definition 5.2.1

SPINORS AND SPIN REPRESENTATIONS.
1. Two idempotent elements such that for some, E G (the Clifford group),
are called geometrically equivalent.
2. Two idempotent elements such that for some u E C(Q)',
e' = ueu- 1
are called algebraically equivalent.
81
By the remark following Proposition (5.1.9) we know that two primitive idempotents
are algebraically equivalent if the Clifford algebra is simple .
Proposition 5.2.1 Let n = 2r and let Q be of maximal index r, then the primitive
idempotents of the form 1'1 (using the notations of2.1) are geometrically equivalent.
Proof. An element of the Clifford group can be found such that it sends a Witt basis
(Xi, Yi) to any other given Witt basis (xi ,yD.
I
The great importance of the idempotent elements 1'1 (i.e. of the isotropic r-
vectors 1) for the study of spinor structures is illustrated by the previous proposition :
as will be shown in Chapter 8, an orthogonal system of 2r such primitive idempotents
can easily be obtained, leading to an expression for the Clifford algebra as a direct
sum of 2r spinor spaces.
Under the assumptions of Proposition (5.2.1), it is easily seen that
are idempotent, but (as the reader can verify) they are not primitive, by the criterion
given in Proposition (5.1.8).
Similarly, the idempotent elements (1+Xi+Yi)/2 = (1+ei)/2, Q(ei) = 1, generally
are not primitive. The decomposition
1 + el
1 - el
1 = -2-
+ -2- ,
(1 + e1)(1 - e1) = 0
shows that C( Q) is the direct sum of two geometrically equivalent (22r - 1)-dimen-
sionalleft ideals, where 22r - 1 > 2r unless r = 1.
Starting from 0(1,1), primitive idempotents
can be constructed, eAe being R in this case.

82
CHAPTER 5
Taking tensor products, two primitive idempotents in C(I, 1) are seen to have a
primitive idempotent product in C(2,2). Repeating this, the primitive idempotents
are obtained in C(r, r), here Ai E R . In particular, this can be applied to the complex
even-dimensional case.
Setting >'1 = >'2 = ...= >'r = 0, the idempotent element
considered in 2.1 is reobtained; its geometric meaning is particularly simple.
Some of these idempotent elements are not geometrically equivalent; for instance,
taking n = 2, r = 1, (>'1 + XdYl and X1Y1 are not geometrically equivalent, although
they must be algebraically equivalent. Indeed, if'Y E G was such that
,(>.1 + X1)yn- 1 = X1Y1,
>'l(a'Xl + b'Y1)+ ab'x1Y1 + a'by1x1 = X1Yl
which, if >'1 ::f; 0, is impossible.
5.2.5
Some properties of the primitive idempotents in a Clifford algebra.
In this subsection we consider a faithful spin representation p in a space S. S will
be a vector space over K such that the image of the Clifford algebra C(Q) under
p is the set of linear K-endomorphisms of S. This is the case for the real Clifford
algebras with signature (p,q) which are isomorphic to matrix algebras over R, C or
H, when p - q ::f; 1(mod 4). By the 'periodicity' properties,
K=R,
ifp-q=0,1,2(mod8)
K=C,
ifp -q =3,7(mod8)
K=H,
ifp-q=4,5,6(mod8) .
Proposition 5.2.2 If p is a faithful spin representation on S, if p(C(Q)) ~ EndS
and if e is a primitive idempotent determining tbe minimal left ideal J = C( Q )e, ibe
kernel of p(e) is a bypexplene H ~ Sand p(J)H =o.
Proof. e2 = e leads to (p(e)y = p(e) so that the minimal polynomial of p(e) is
X2 - X = X(X -1). By a classical result of linear algebra, S can be decomposed as
S = ker(p(e) - Id) EB ker p(e).

SPINORS AND SPIN REPRESENTATIONS.
Setting H = kerp(e), H' = ker(p(e) - Id), if ve E J,
p(ve)H = p(v)p(e)H = 0
hence p(J)H = O.
To prove that H is a hyperplane in S, set
s = h + h',
hE H,
h' E H'.
If v E C(Q) satisfies p(v)h = 0, Vh E V,
p(v)s = p(v)h',
Vs E S,
p(ve)s = p(v)p(e)s = p(v)h'o
83
p being faithful, ve = v and therefore v E J; J is the set of u E C(Q) such that
p(u)H = O.
But the set of u E C(Q) such that p(u) maps a subspace HI
~ S to 0 is a
non-zero left ideal J1 and HI ~ H implies J1 :2 J . J being minimal, H must be a
hyperplane.

For example, if we take S and the representation as in 2.1, the idempotent element
e = f'f is seen to annihilate the hyperplane determined by

Lemma 5.2.1 Under the assumptions of the previous proposition , if J' is a minimal
right ideal, p(J') maps S onto a subspace of dimension 1 over K.
Proof. Let J' = e'C(Q), (e')2 = e',
S = ker(p(e') - Id) Ell ker p(e') = D' ED D
Since p(e')(S) = D', p(e'v)S ~ D' and p(J')(S) = D. Conversely, if p(v')(S) ~ D',
p(e') being the identity on D' , p(e'v') = p(v') and v' = e'v', Hence J' is the set of
u E C(Q) such that p(u)(S) = D'.
The set of u E C(Q) for which p(u) maps S into a subspace D~ C S is a right
ideal J{, and D~ ~ D' implies J{ ~ r, D' being non-zero, it must be one-dimensional
over K.
I
Proposition 5.2.3 The intersection of a minimal left ideal and a minimal right
ideal of C( Q) is a subspace of dimension 1 over K.
Proof. If J and J' are such ideals, J n J' is the set of v E C(Q) such that
p(v)H = 0,
p(v)S = D'.

84
If x = h + h', h E H, h' E H', and if v E J n J',
p(v)x = ayo = p(v)h',

v --+ >-'Yo is an injective linear mapping, since p(v')xo
p(v)h' and p(v) = p(v'), so v = v'.
This mapping is an isomorphism and dim( J n J') = 1.

Immediate consequences.
If e and e' are primitive idempotents determining J
and J' , e'C(Q)e is a subspace of C( Q) of dimension lover K .
An anti-automorphism {3 exists, providing a bijection between left and right ide-
als, hence (3(e)C(Q)e has dimension lover K.
Every primitive idempotent therefore determines a subspace of C(Q) of dimension
lover K .
If {3(e)e i= 0, the element determines the subspace.
Note that for an idempotent f'f, {3(e)e = 0 and the one-dimensional subspace
contains f.
Corollary 5.2.1 For real Clifford algebras of signature (p, q),
eC(Q)e is a field isomorphic to R if p - q = 0,1,2 (mod 8),
eC(Q)e is a field isomorphic to C if p - q = 3,7 (mod 8),
eC(Q)e is a field isomorphic to R if p - q = 4, S, 6 (mod 8).
Proof. Immediate.

-+ Ox is a homeomorphism from C(Q) to a subspace of the
endomorphisms of C(Q). This homeomorphism and its inverse are analytic.
Proof. X -+ Ox is injective since XY = X'Y, VY E C(Q), implies X = X' . Given a
basis of C( Q), the matrix of Ox obviously consists of components depending analyt-
ically on the components of X .
Since Ox(1) = X, if the sequence Ox" has a limit, so does Ox,,(1) = X n and 0 has
a continuous inverse.
Note that 0 is linear, hence dO = O.

system of linear equations), C(Q)' is a Lie group.

£(C(Qt) = C(Q).

[Ox,Oy] = OxOy - OyOX = O(XY - YX)
[Ox,Oy] = [dO(X) ,dO(Y)] = dO([X, YJ) = O([X, YJ),

[X,Y] = XY - Yx.

cp(exptX) = exp(tadX).

The Lie algebra of the Clifford group.
First consider the Clifford group G.
Proposition 6.1.3 G is a closed Lie subgroup of C(Q)*,

88
CHAPTER 6
Proof. If all elements of the sequence Un are in G, <pCun) preserves E and so does the
limit U if Un tends to u.
G being closed in C( Q)', it has the structure of a topological Lie subgroup of
C( Q)', by a classical result, then X E .L:(G) if and only if exp tX E G.
I
The following remark will prove useful :
<pCexp tX) maps E into itself for all
t E R, so ad X also maps E into itself, and the converse.
Let x,y E E, then Vz E E,
xyz - zxy
2xB(y,z) - (xz + zx)y
=
2B(y, z)x - 2B(x, z)y
so that
ad(xy)(z) = 2B(y, z)x - 2B(x, z)y E E
and xy E .L:(G).
If E is odd-dimensional, the center Z of C( Q) is generated by 1 and by an odd
element eN . For any U E Z, adu = 0 and hence Z ~ .L:(G).
Let C be the space which is linearly generated by the products (xy) , z ,Y E E and
by eN E Z if n is odd. A basis for C is given by the eiej, i < i, by eo = 1 and, if n
is odd, by eN.
So dimC = n(n - 1)/2 + 1 if n is even, n(n - 1)/2 + 2 if n is odd.
The image of Gunder <p is O(Q) or SO(Q) depending on the parity of n and we
know that the Lie algebra of O(Q) or SO(Q) is (n(n - 1)/2)-dimensional.
If n is odd : ker e = G n Z and since SO(Q) ~ G/(G n Z),
dim.L:(SO(Q)) = dim.L:(G) - dim.L:(G n Z)
and dim.L:(G) = n(n - 1)/2 + 2 leads to .L:(G) = C.
If n is even, a similar reasoning leads to dim.L:(G) = n(n - 1)/2 + 1.
If r is the twisted Clifford group, the situation is the same regardless of the parity
of n since the kernel of the representation is in both cases R' and p(I'] = O(Q).
Hence :
Proposition 6.1.4 .L:(G) is linearly generated by the elements (xy), x,y E E and
by eN E Z ifn is odd. .L:(r) is linearly generated by the elements (xy), x,y E E,
regardless of the parity of n.
If we consider the special Clifford group G+ = r+, exp tX is the limit of a
sequence in C+(Q) if X E C+(Q), and therefore it lies in C+(Q).
Conversely, if
exptX E C+(Q), its derivative at t = 0 must lie in C+(Q), so that
.L:(r+) = .L:(r) n C+(Q)
and
Proposition 6.1.5 .L:(O+) = .L:(r+) is linearly generated by the elements (xy),
x,y E E . Its dimension is n(n - 1)/2 + 1.

6.1.4
The Lie algebra of Spin(Q).
Recall that PinQ(Q) was defined as the subgroup of 9 E f such that N(g) = ±l and
SpinQ(Q) as its subgroup PinQ(Q) n C+(Q). When n is even PinQ(Q) = Pin(Q),
when n is odd, Spin(Q) = SpinQ(Q).
These groups obviously are topological Lie subgroups of Clifford groups.
Let us determine the Lie algebra of Spin(Q).
Proposition 6.1.6 The Lie algebra of Spin(Q) is the set of X E .C(G+) = £(f+)
such that f3(X) + X = o.
Prooi. X E £(Spin(Q)) means that exptX E Spin(Q), which can be expressed by
f3(exp tX) exp(tX) = 1. Taking the derivative at t = 0,
f3(X) + X = 0
(8)
and £(Spin(Q)) is (n(n - 1)/2)-dimensional.
I
This result can be explained by noticing that Spin(Q) is a covering of SO(Q) so
that the Lie algebras of Spin(Q) and SO(Q) are isomorphic.
Note also that £(Spin(Q)) is the subspace of C+ generated by the products (xy),
x ..L y, since f3(xy) + xy = 0 if and only if xy + yx = 2B(x,y) = o. A basis of
£(Spin(Q)) is given by {eiej ,i < j} if (el' e2, ... , en) is an orthogonal basis of E .
Using classical results from the theory of Lie groups and algebras, the isomor-
phism from the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group to the Lie algebra of the spin
group can be found explicitly.

Connectedness.
Proposition 6.2.1 IfQ is a definite quadratic form and ifdimE > 1, Spin(Q) = Gt
is connected.
Proof. We have seen that ep(Spin(Q)) = SO(Q) and that kerep, restricted to Spin(Q),
is {1,-1} (d. Chapter 4).
Note that (-1) lies in the connected component of 1 in Spin(Q), since if z , y E E
such that B(x,y) = 0 and Q(x) = Q(y) = 1 (or Q(x) = Q(y) = -1),
(xy)2 = -Q(x)Q(y) = -1.
Taking the series expansion of the exponential function and noticing that (xy)2 = -1,
we obtain:
exp(txy) = cost +(xy)sint,
exp(7rxy) = -1,
(1)
so that a continuous path from 1 to (-1) can be found in Spin(Q).
Knowing that Spin(Q) is a covering of SO(Q) there exists a connected neighbor-
hood V' of 1 in SO(Q) which, by a classical result, is homeomorphic to a connected
neighborhood V of 1 in Spin(Q).
vx E Spin]Q),
x' = ep(x) =
x~ x~ . . . x~,
and such a factorization is always possible in terms of x~ E V' since SO(Q), being
connected, is generated by the neighborhood V' of the identity. Then
Now ep(x) = ep( XIX2 • . • Xk) and by the results on the kernel of ep,
The connectedness of V is equivalent to its arcwise connectedness and implies the
existence of continuous paths from 1 to Xl, X2, • • • , Xk, hence also from 1 to z , since
there exists a continuous path from 1 to -1 which can be used if e = -1.
Then Spin(Q) is arcwise connected, hence connected.

Obviously at is normal in Spin(Q) and if two elements g, g' of Spin(Q) are
equivalent modulo at, N(g)
=
±N(g').
Hence there are two quotient classes,
Spin(Q)/at = {I, -I}.
Now let (x, y) be a pair of elements for which N(x) = N(y) and let P be the plane
(x,y). Either P is isotropic (but not totally, since N(x) = ±1), or non-isotropic of
index 0 or 1. There are three cases to consider :
1. P is isotropic.
Let z E P n pJ.., N(z) = O. P = (x) EB (z), B(x, z) = 0, Q(x) = Q(y) = e,
f = ±1. If y = ax + fJz, Q(ax + fJz) = e if and only if a 2 = 1, so
y = ±x+ >.z,
>. E R.
Letting t vary from 0 to >., a continuous path from x to y or from -x to y is
obtained, yielding a continuous path from xy to ±x2 = ±1.
2. P is non-isotropic of index O.
An orthonormal basis (x, z) can be found in P, y = >'x + p.z and Q(y) = e if
and only if >.2 + p.2 = 1. Setting
y = x cos t + z sin t
a continuous path from xy to x2 = ±1 is obtained.
3. P is non-isotropic of index 1.
A Witt decomposition gives
P = (z) EB (Z/)
where z, z' are isotropic and B(z, Zl) = 1.
y = aoz + fJoz/,
Q(y) = 2aofJo,

Similarly, x = O}Z + /3}Z', x = o}Z + Ez'/(20}), o} :/:- O.
If 00o} > 0, a continuous path from x to y is obtained, hence also from xy to
x 2 =
E.
If 000} < 0, a continuous path from -x to y is obtained, hence also from xy
to _x 2 = -E.
In all three cases a continuous path from an arbitrary element of Gt to 1 or -1
is found .
Now distinguish two cases :
• If dimE = 2.
Q having a non-zero index, its index is one and 3 applies.
OOO} > °and
OOO} < 0 being mutually exclusive, it is impossible to reach both 1 and -1 by
a continuous path starting from xy . Gt has therefore exactly two connected
components.
• If dimE> 2.
Using the reduced diagonal form of Q one sees that there always exist ortho-
gonal x, y such that
N(x) = N(y) = E = ±1.
The reasoning used in the definite case can therefore be applied to the plane
(x, y) and offers a continuous path from 1 to -1. Hence Gt is connected.
I
Corollary 6.2.1 IfQ is indefinite, lp(Gt) is connected regardless of the dimension .
Proof. lp(Gt) is generated by products
and ±1, which is mapped to the identity by lp, IS reached by a continuous path
starting from XiYi .
•
Consequence.
For n > 2, Gt , which is of index 2 10 Spin(Q), must be the
connected component of the identity in Spin( Q).
By the isomorphism theorems on the groups
lp(Spin( Q)) "-' Spin(Q)
lp(Gt)
Gt'
lp(Gt) is the connected component of lp(Spin(Q)) = SO(Q).

p(Spin(Q)) = SO(Q) ~ Spin(Q)
(2)
knowing that SO(Q) has index 2 in O(Q), O(Q) has four connected components if
Q is indefinite, regardless of the dimension-a well-known result we have rapidly
reobtained.
By (2), Pin(Q) also has four connected components.
The connected component Gt corresponds to the 9 E C +(Q) such that N(g) = 1,
Spin(Q) to the 9 E C+(Q) such that N(g) = ±1 and Pin(Q) to the 9 E C(Q) such
that N(g) = ±1.
The elements of <p(Gt) are products of an even number of symmetries relative

THE MATRIX APPROACH TO SPINORS IN THREE
AND FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SPACES.
We will survey the traditional methods widely used by theoretical physicists and
show how they fit in the modern theory.
In order to understand the reasons underlying these theories, we should consider
the work of E. Cartan and Dirac. To linearize the Klein-Gordon operator,

We will recall the local isomorphisms of SU(2, C) and SO(3, R) and those of
SL(2, C) and the restricted Lorentz group, used by E. Cartan, who discovered the
spinors in his study of the representations of the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group,
but did not give them a special name.

THE MATRIX APPROACH TO SPINORS.

The complex Clifford algebra in C3.

Let E = C3 and let (et, e2,e3) be its canonical basis .
For x = xiei' let Q(x) =

C(Q) has a basis 1, el, e2, e3, e12, e13, e23, e123, where el2 stands for ele2, e23 for
e2e3 etc. and the rules
(ei)2=I, i=I,2,3
eiej + ejei = 0,
i # j
apply.
C+(Q) has an irreducible representation in a space of dimension 21 = 2 on C .
C+(Q) is isomorphic to End(C2), as can be verified if we define the matrices

If we associate G'x to e12, G'I/ to e23, G'z to e31 and G'o to I, an isomorphism p+
from C+(Q) to End(C2) is defined and p+ can be called the spin representation of
C+(Q), the elements of C 2 being called 'spinors'.
By Chapter 5, 2.2, this representation can be extended to a representation p =
p+ 0 cp of C(Q) in C2. We define
u = U1 + ie123u2,
Ut,U2 E C+(Q),
(iel23? = 1.
If U= e1, U2 = ie23 and U1 = 0, p(ed = iG'1/ and similarly p(e2) = iG'z, p(e3) = iG'x'
The image F of E under p is a three-dimensional subspace of End(C2), given by
the endomorphisms with matrix

X G'x + X G'I/ + X G'z,
x' E C.
It is easily seen that F can be identified to the set of matrices with zero trace. The
restriction of p to E is a linear isomorphism from E to F defining on F a 'metric'
Q':
Q'(H) = Q(h)
if
H = p(h).
Let us determine the image of the group G+ under p":
If U E G+, Vh E E, h' = uhu- 1 E E and therefore p(h') = p(u)p(h)p(u- 1 ) E F,
or with obvious notations,
H' = U 0 H 0 U- 1 E F,
U E GL(C2 ) .

96
CHAPTER 7
Conversely, if H' = UHU-1 where H E F and U E GL(C2), the trace of H' is
zero (trH' = trH =0), so H' E F .
The restrictions of p to C+(Q) and E being bijective, we deduce from
H' = U 0 H 0 U-t,
if
H = p(h),
U = p(u),
u E C+(Q)
and H' = p(h') , h' E E :
h' = uhu-1 E E
and
u E G+.
Therefore p+ is an isomorphism from G+ to GL(C2).
In the older publications on this subject, the representation cp
u -.
CPu is
described using UHU-1, written cpu(H), so that
cp(GL(C2)) = SO(3, C)
by the results on the Clifford group.
Now we can prove that cp(U) E SO(3, R) if and only if U is unitary up to a
complex factor.
Indeed, a 'real' vector in F can be identified with a matrix H such that fI = _ HT
(for such a vector, xl , x2 and x3 are real).
cp(U) E SO(3, R) if and only if
UHU-1 = -(UHU-1f
= (U-1)TfIuT,
whenever fI = _HT. fI = (UT[r)fI(([r -1)(U-1)T) for all H obtained from real xl,
x2 , x3 • UT[r E Z n G+ impl ies [rTU = >.I and Uj..JX is unitary.
The kernel of the restriction of ip to SU(2, C) is a subset of the set of invertible
elements of the center End(C2), i.e. {C7o, -C7o}. We have proved :
SU(2, C) is a double covering of SO(3, R).
Remarks.
1. SU(2, C) is the set of endomorphisms with matrix
where Q, (3, 'Y and 5 are real and Q2 +(32 +'"(2 + 52 = 1 because of (2).
SU(2, C) is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of unit quaternions and is
therefore a double covering of SO(3, R).
We have reobtained the result which, historically, led to the first definition of
the quaternions.

THE MATRIX APPROACH TO SPINORS.
97
2. If U is a real matrix and, as an element of SU(2, C), determines a rotation of
angle a, the matrix of ep(U) can be written, relying on
H' = UHU- 1 ,
as

If OX, OY, OZ is a positive orthogonal reference frame and if we identify C 2
with the plane OXZ, a rotation of angle 2a and axis OY corresponds to U.
So when h E C2 C C3 'turns' over 2a around OY, h, considered as a spinor,
'turns' over a around OY. This is no paradox : to a rotation of angle a around
OY there corresponds, under ep, a rotation of angle 2a around the same axis .
7.2
Minkowski Clifford algebras and Dirac matrices.
7.2.1
Minkowski space and the Lorentz group.
We start by a general definition holding for all dimensions.
A real n-dimensional vector space with a non-degenerate indefinite normal hy-
perbolic quadratic form will be called a Minkowski space ER or En - 1,l ' There exist
orthonormal bases eo, e1, e2, . . . ,en - 1 = {eo,e.] for which

a latin index such as i will vary from 1 to n - 1; a greek index will vary from 0 to n .
xO is called the time coordinate, the xi are called space coordinates. Using the
Einstein convention, we write
where 9ij = -Cij, 90i = 9iO = 0 and goo = 1 in the basis {eo,e.}; go./3 stands for the
inverse matrix of go./3.
Remark.
We could also have chosen the signature (l ,n - 1) without affecting the
essential results of this chapter.

and if Ag ::; - 1, XO and XO have opposite sign, but if Ag ~ 1, they have the same

The connected component of the identity in the Lorentz group L n (i.e. O(n-l, 1))
is the group L~ which was written <p(Gt) in Chapter 6. It consists of matrices A
whose determinant is 1 and contains all elements of SO(n - 1) for which Ag = 1;
therefore this subgroup is characterized by
det A = 1,
Ag ~ 1.
These conditions lead to the existence of exactly four connected components (con-
firming the results of Chapter 6), the other three being obtained by
det A = 1,
detA = -1,
detA = -1,

A similar factorization holds for all even n .
The case where n is odd is left as an exercise for the reader.
The orthochronic group is generated by L~ and the space symmetry; it has two
connected components.
7.2 .2
Four-dimensional minkowskian Clifford algebras.
Let G'(Q) be the complexified Clifford algebra G(Q) = G(3,1). G'(Q) is isomorphic
to the endomorphism algebra of a four-dimensional complex vector space, which will
itself be isomorphic to Ec .
The Dirac matrices.
Let Fe be the complex vector space generated in End(C)
by the four matrices 'Ya, Q = 0,1,2,3,
Lemma 7.2.1 The algebra generated by the four Dirac matrices is End(Ec).
A direct and elementary proof for this lemma runs as follows:
Proof. The generated algebra contains :
where 0 :::; ~ < Jl :::; 3, which are 16 linearly independent matrices, since, except for
1, their trace is zero.
Indeed, ("(0)2 = -1, (,,(d2= 1, i = 1,2 ,3, 'Ya'YlJ +,na = 0 if Q ¥-13.

where e = ±1 and we have relied on the invariance of the trace under cyclic permu-
tation. Given the properties of the matrices in (3), this implies
Finally,
tr(-Y01'11'21'3) = tr(-YO(-Yl1'21'3)) = tr(-Yl1'21'31'O) = - tr(-Y01'11'21'3)'
Now if
F = A+ p,°1'o + p,l1'l + ...+ p,01231'01't"Y21'3 = 0,
tr(F) = 4A = 0 and, similarly, tr(-yoF) = tr(p,°1'o1'o), 1'~ = -I, so p,0 = 0 etc.
1£ we set p(e",) =1'"" P is seen to extend to an algebra homomorphism sending a
basis of G(Q) to a basis of End(Ec), hence p must be a spin representation.
I
Remark.
A faster, but less elementary proof of Lemma (7.2.1) can be given as
follows: define an endomorphism u from Ec to Fc by u(e",) = 1'",. By the multipli-
cation table of the 1'""
for all
~ E Ec, so by the universal property of Clifford algebras, there exists a
homomorphism ii. from G'(Q) into the algebra generated by the Dirac matrices, u
clearly is surjective and G'(Q) being simple, ii. is injective, so the algebra generated
by the (-y",) is sixteen-dimensional and must coincide with End(Ec).
Restriction of the field to R .
Let us consider the Clifford algebra G(Q) of
the Minkowski space E3•1 and the real vector space F generated by the real linear
combinations ofthe Dirac matrices. G(Q) is known to be a simple algebra. Using the
universal property, an R-endomorphism from E to F can be defined by the method
of the previous remark. G(Q) is therefore isomorphic to the real algebra generated
by the four Dirac matrices, which, in turn, is isomorphic to End(E).
The 'vector' and the 'spin' structure of F.
The isomorphism between E and
F gives F a Minkowski space structure. G(Q) is isomorphic to End(E), hence to
End(F). The representations of C(Q) can be constructed using End(F), F is then
a spinor space.
1£ A E G, A E End(F) and A-I exists, AFA-l ~ F. Setting epA(X) = AxA-l, v«
is an isometry and for z = 1'"" A1'",A-1 =
A~1'A '
(A~) is the matrix of a Lorentz isometry.
In this way, an element of F can either be considered as a vector in a Minkowski
space on which the Lorentz group acts, or as a spinor on which the group G, iso-
morphic to the Clifford group of E3•1 , acts. The associated operations are related
by
A1'",A-1 =
A~1'",'

This concept is found in many publications by theoretical physicists; we see that
it is closely linked to the four-dimensional case (2" = n 2 if n = 4) .

This choice of coordinates shows the signature (1,3) of the metric. ep maps A to
an element epA or ep(A) of 0(1,3), somewhat abusively denoted by L4 •
One easily shows that 8L(2, C) is arcwise connected so that ep(A) belongs to the
restricted Lorentz group L~.
It is obvious that ep(A) = ep(A') implies A' = ±A.
The Lie algebra of 8L(2, C) is six-dimensional over R and consists of the 2 X 2
complex matrices with zero trace. A real basis for it is

[X, Z] = 2X,

we can construct elements in the Lie algebra of 8L(2, C) :

It can easily be proved that the image of the Lie algebra of 8L(2, C) obtained in
this way is six-dimensional over R. It is therefore the Lie algebra of 0(1,3) which,
by the exponential function, generates the connected component of the identity in
0(1,3), i.e. L~ .
Tbexeiore 8L(2, C) is a connected double covering of the restricted Lorentz group.
For xO = 0, cp(A) E 80(3, R) (by the connectedness of 80(3, R)).
By ijJ the Lie algebra of 80(3,R) is obtained and as ijJ(bk) = iijJ(ak), k = 1,2,3,
we see that the image of the Lie algebra of 8L(2, C) under ijJ can be interpreted
as the Lie algebra of 80(3, C); 80(3, C) being connected, 8L(2, C) is a covering of
SO(3, C).
The Lie algebras of the groups SL(2, C) , SO(3 , C), Spin(I,3) and 80(1,3) are
isomorphic.
Using a Lorentz basis (eo,el,e2,e3) satisfying (eo)2 = 1, (ek)2 = -1, k = 1,2,3
the basis
ele2,e2e3,e3el,eOel ,eOe2,eOe3
of .c(L~) is obtained. One easily verifies that
[e3etf2, e2e3/2] = -ele2/2,
[eoel/2, eOe3/2] = e3eI!2
and all cyclic permutations of these equations.
Setting J( e2e3) = eOel etc. an operator J is obtained for which J2 = - Id, giving
a complex structure to .c(L~) .
The isomorphism between the Lie algebra of 80(3, C) (given a real structure)
and that of the Lorentz group is at the origin of the 'complex vectorial formalism'
of relativity theory (d. ultra Chapter 8, 3).

Q is assumed non-degenerate of maximal index r, dimE = n = 2r over K .
In Chapter 5, 2.1, an analogous situation was considered for K = C; we will use
the same notations.
f = YlY2 . . .Yr will be called an isotropic r-vector. The spinor space S is C(Q)f
and the spin representation p is just the multiplication from the left .
Lemma 8.1.1 fC(Q) is a minimal right ideal.
Proof This follows at once from the existence of the anti-automorphism {3, C(Q)f
being a minimal left ideal (d. Chapter 5).
•
Proposition 8.1.1 f and II being isotropic r-veetors, G(Q)f n flC(Q) is a one-
dimensional subspace (over K) of C( Q).
Proof This is a special case of Proposition (5.2.2), since C(Q)f and flC(Q) are
minimal ideals, the first a left ideal, the second a right ideal of G(Q).
This result being very important, we also give a direct proof: first let us determine
the intersection of C( Q)f and fC( Q). If uf = Iv, u, v E G(Q), we may assume that
u and v are linear combinations of Xl , X2, . .. , Xr. Taking a term of maximal degree in
u, UQ = a it ...ik Xit Xi2 . •. Xik (where there is no summation), and multiplying from the

So uf = (.A +ul)f, AE K*.
If Ul = 0, uf = Af and the proof is complete; otherwise ud = f( v - A) and we
are back in the previous case for Ul, Ul contains a non-scalar term of minimal degree
and a contradiction is reached.
In general, if uf = flV there exists, by the Witt theorem, an element, of the
Clifford group such that fl = ,-1 f" and therefore ,-luf = f,-lV,
we note however that Ais not unique, if fl = ,d'll, ,-I,d = f,-l'l = a f,

F' and Fl being m.t.i.s. determined by f and fl, we will say that the pure spinors
determined by f and It are also determined by F and Fl , since by Proposition (2.2.5),
if Y~, Y~,· .. ,y; form another basis of F', y~y~ ... v; and YlY2 ... Yr are collinear.
For example, C(Q)fnfC(Q) contains i, and F, associated to (XlX2"
,Xr) de-
termines, with F', the pure spinor XlX2 . . . xrf = f' f, which is idempotent.
To simplify the notations we will assume that F', associated to YlY2 . . . Yr, is fixed
and we will say that any other m.t.i.s. 'determines an equivalence class of collinear
pure spinors'.
Lemma 8.1.2 Fl being a m.t.i.s., there exists agE G (the Clifford group) such
that gF'g-l = Fl; then gf is a pure spinor determined by Fl.
Proof. The existence of 9 follows from the Witt theorem. If ep is the projection of G
on O(Q), setting a = ep(g),
gF'g-l = epg(F') = Fl ,
gfg-l is a product It of elements of a basis for Fl , and
gf = fIg E C(Q)f n flC(Q) .
I
Proposition 8.1.2 Given a spin representation in C(Q)f, every m.t.i.s. is charac-
terized by an equivalence class of pure spinors.
Proof. Every pure spinor lies in the intersection of two ideals C(Q)f and ItC(Q). If
Fl = gF'g-l, uf = Agf for all pure spinors determined by Fl , according to Lemma
(8.1.2).
I
Conversely, to each pure spinor there corresponds a unique m.t.i.s. Fl , as is proved
by the following lemma :

THE SPINORS IN MAXIMAL INDEX AND EVEN DIMENSION.

Lemma 8.1.3 If F1 is associated to gf :
1. F1 = {x E E , xgf = O}, i.e. Fl is the intersection of E and the annihilator of
gf, which is an element of the representation module.
2. If uf E S is such that xuf = 0, "Ix E FI, then uf = >.gf, >. E K* and uf
characterizes Fl .
Proof. Indeed, if x E FI, xgf = Xflg and as Xfl = 0, xgf = 0.
Conversely, if xg f = 0, let E = F1 EEl F{ be a Witt decomposition, then x = Xl+x~,
(Xl +xDgf = 0, (Xl +xDflg = 0, (Xl +xDfl = 0 and, as xIii = 0, XUl = 0 so that
x~ = °and X E Fl.
For 2, xuf =°if and only if ,X,-l(-yUJ) = 0, "t E G and the property of X E Fl
we are considering will also hold for ,Fn- l . Hence we can assume that Fl = F.
C(Q)f is linearly isomorphic to /\(F) and uf is, by this isomorphism, associated
to an element of degree r in /\(F) since xuf = 0, therefore
uf = >'XlX2 .. . xrf
and F being associated to XlX2 . . . xrf, uf is in the class of pure spinors determined
by F .
•
Important remark.
uf = >.gf for all pure spinors determined by Fl = gF'g-l,
but one should note that 9 is by no means uniquely determined, even modulo a scalar
factor : there can exist, E G such that ,f,-l = k]', k E K* and Fl is associated
to g,f.
Corollary 8.1.1 If(ul ,u2, .. . ,ur) determine a m.t.i.s. F{, if(zl,z2 , . . . , zr) deter-
mine a m .t.i.s. F2 and if >'ZlZ2 . . . z; = UlU2 .. . ur, F{ = F2.
Proof. Indeed, fl = UlU2 · · .Ur, fr = >'ZlZ2 . . 'Zr , setting
II =,h- l ,
h = >.,f,-l and ,f is a pure spinor determined by F}, and also by F2.
•
Finally, we conclude that having chosen a spinor space C(Q)f, a class of pure
spinors can be bijectively associated to each m .t.i.s.-or equivalently, that a m .t.i.s.
is characterized by a class of pure spinors.
Remark.
A pure spinor is a semi-spinor, since we can assume it is st, 9 E G where
9 is a product of non-isotropic vectors in E ; 9 has a well-determined parity. If 9 is
changed to g, where ,f,-l = k]; k E K*, then yj' = kf, = >'f, >. E K*"
is even
and therefore g, and 9 have the same parity.
Definition 8.1.2 A m.t.i.s. will be called even or odd according to the parity of its
associated pure spinor.
Obviously two m.t.i.s. are of the same parity if and only if one of them can be
mapped to the other by an element of SO(Q).

The subgroup of O(Q) inducing the identity on a m.r.i,s.
Let E = FEEl F' be a Witt decomposition and let (Xi, Yi) be the corresponding Witt
basis (d. Chapter 5, 2.1). If the isometry U fixes all points of F, it gives rise to
another Witt decomposition :
E = FEEl Ft,
Ft = u(F').
Now set U(Xi) = Xi, U(Yi) = a1xj + b~Y/C) i = 1,2, .. . , r . The isometry property leads
to B(a~xt+b~xk,Xj) = oii so b1 = 01, and B(a~xl+ofxk,a~xl+ojYI) = 0 implies that

Replacing YlY2 ... Yr by
u(yt)U(Y2) . . . u(Yr) we obtain a new idempotent element which also determines
C(Q)1'.
This provides us with the example announced in Chapter 5, 1.7 part 1. These
two idempotents are essentially different (we would call them trivially different if
they only differed by a sign), yet they are geometrically equivalent.'.

Proposition 8.1.3 (Using the notations of Chapter 4') Ifu E f\2(F), exp(u) E Gt
and ep(expu) fixes the elements of F . Conversely, every element ofO(Q) which fixes
all elements of F is in ep(Gt) and can be written as ep(expu), u E f\2(F).
Proof. Obviously the elements of the form exp u, u E f\2(F), generate a group . Each
element of f\2(F) being the sum of decomposable elements, it is sufficient to show
that if Xl,X2 E F, exp(xlx2) E G to prove that expu E G.
But from XiY + YXi = 2B(Xi, y), i = 1,2, Y E F' we deduce that
exp(u)y(exp(u))-l = (1 +u)y(1 - u),
where u = XIX2, or exp(u)y(exp(u»-l = y + 2B(X2,Y)Xl - 2B(Xl,Y)X2 E E.
Obviously exp(u) E G+. (3(XIX2) = -XIX2, so ifu is decomposable,
(3(exp(u»
= exp( -u) = (exp(u))-l,
hence exp(u) E Gt. This result is easily extended to arbitrary u E f\2(F).
Finally, since u commutes with all elements of F, ep(exp u) fixes each element of
F .
Conversely : we need only establish that ep(exp(f\2(F»)) is the set of elements in
O(Q) which fix all points of F .
If u = XIX2, exp(u)Yj(exp(u))-l = Yj + 202,jXl - 201,jX2.
If u = a12xIX2, exp(u)Yj(exp(u))-l = Yj+2a12(o2.jXl - Ol,jX2)'
Now ifu = aili2xilXi2 = L;Xa , ai1i2 = _ai2i1,

The general form of pure spinors.

This general form can be deduced from the following two lemmas and from Propo-
sition (8.1.4).

(1 E ep(Gt) fixing all elements of V and mapping Vito V".

CHAPTER 8
Proof. Under an isometry 7 the problem is not changed, (7 is replaced by (7' = 70(707-1
and if (7 E <p(Gt), so will (71; on the other hand if 7(V) = Vi, (71(Vt} = Vi and
(J'
fixes all elements of Vi : 7(V) n7(V') = 7(V) n 7(V").
We may assume that V = F.
Let (Xi,Yi) be a Witt basis corresponding to the decomposition E = F ED F' and
let F n V' = F n V" = (XI, X2 , ... , Xh).
FI = (Xh+t,. . . ,XT, YI, Yh) is a m.t.i.s., and F I n V' = O. Indeed, if z E FI n V' , it
is orthogonal to all elements of FI and V', so to
but the space which is orthogonal to this (r + h)-dimensional space and contains
Xh+l, .. . ,XT is (Xh+t,. . . ,xT). Therefore z E (Xh+t, . . . ,xT) but z E V' and F n V' =
(Xl, " " Xh) then imply that z is zero.
Hence E = F I ED V' = FI ED V" and, applying another isometry, we must only
prove that if
E = F ED V' = F ED V",
there exists a (7 E p(exp(1\2(F))) mapping Vito V" .
A Witt basis for the decomposition F ED V" can be found : taking
x~ in F) a
y~ E V" is associated, requiring that B(x~, yD = 1.
(x~, y~) is non-isotropic and E
can be written as (x~, yD ED HI ED H~ where dim HI = dim H~ = r - 1, HI and H~ are
totally isotropic, etc.
Let u be an isometry sending the Witt basis {Xi, Yj} of FED F' to the Witt basis
{xi, yj} of F ED V' : xi = u( Xi) = A~Xk, yi = U(Yi) = Bfyk + CfXk.
Now necessarily ATB = Id and U is the product of two isometries :
Xi --+ A~Xk = Xi --+ Xi,
u. --+ BfYk = Y; --+ Y; + CNA-I)~Xk ,
the first one, preserving F and F' separately, can be interpreted as a simple change
of Witt bases; this basis change completed, an isometry (7 is obtained; it fixes every
point of F and sends F' to V' . The same holds for F and V", proving the lemma. I
Lemma 8.1.6 Let (Xl, X2, . . . , Xh) be a free system in the m .t.i.s. F and let M be
the space generated by it ; let M' = F' n M." , Then V = M + M ' is a m .t .i.s. and
XlX2 . . . Xh! is a representative spinor of V (if the sequence is empty, ! is obtained).
Proof. We may assume that each Xl,X2, . .. ,Xh belongs to a Witt basis {Xi, Yj}
adapted to the decomposition E = F ED F'.
Clearly V is a m.t .i.s. since the or-
thogonal space to M in E contains F and the r - h vectors Yh+t,. . . ,Yh,
Ml. n F' = (Yh+t, . . . ,Yh+T) and V is the space of the (Xl, . .. ,Xh, Yh+t, . .. ,YT)'

Proposition 8.1.4
1. u] is a pure spinor if and only if u =
.:\ exp( v )XIX2 . . . Xh where Xl, X2 , .. . ,Xh
are linearly independent in F, .:\ E K* and v E /\2(F).
2. If uf represents F1, (Xl, X2, . . . , Xh) is a basis of F n Fl .
Proof. By Lemma (8.1.6), if Xl, X2,
, Xh are linearly independent, XIX2 .. .xhf rep-
resents V such that VnF = (Xl, X2,
, Xh); applying exp v, (exp v)V(expv)-1 = FI ,
F n FI = (Xl, X2 , . .. , Xh) and 2 is proved; furthermore exp(v )XIX2 .. .xhf is a spinor
rep resenting Fl.
Conversely, if FI is a m.t.i.s. and if (Xl, X2, . . . , Xh) is a basis of FI n F, let us
define V as in Lemma (8.1.6), then V n F = FI n F so by Lemma (8.1.5) there
exists a v E /\2(F) such that rp(expv) maps V onto FI and exp(v)xIX2 . . . Xh is a
pure spinor defining Fl .
•
Corollary 8.1.2 If the dimension n is 4 or 6, all semi-spinors are pure.
Proof. In four dimensions, a pure spinor can be written as .:\(1 + aXIX2)f,
.:\(1 + aXIX2)(bx1+ cX2)(b'X1 + c'x2)f
=
.:\(bc' - b'C)X1X2f,
.:\(1 + aXIX2)(bxI + cX2)f =

and a semi-spinor (axI +{3x2)f , (a' +(3'XIX2)f is of one of these forms.
The proof in the six-dimensional case is similar.
•
Corollary 8.1.3 If V and V' are two m .t.i.s. and if h = dim(V n V'), V and V' are
of the same parity if and only if h = r (mod 2).
Proof. By the Witt theorem there exists a 0' E O(Q) mapping V to F. Note that
V and V' have the same parity if and only if O'(V) and O'(V') have the same parity
(if 7(V) = V' , 0'70'-1 maps O'(V) to O'(V'), and
7 E SO(Q) if and only if 0'70'-1 E
SO(Q)). Therefore we can assume that V = F .
A representative spinor for F is X1X2 . . .x.] and a representative spinor for V' is
u' = >. exp(v )XI . . . xhf; (Xl , X2, .. . , Xh) being a basis of V' nF, the result is proved. •

Corollary 8.1.4 Every (r - 1)-dimensional totally isotropic subspace (t.i.s.) of E
is contained in exactly one even m .t.i.s. and in exactly one odd m.t.i.s.
Proof. We reduce the problem to a subspace U of F with basis Xl, X2 , • .. , Xr-l ' If
V is an m.t.i.s. containing U, of the same parity as F, dim(V n F) = r (mod 2) and
dim(V n F) 2: r - 1, so V = F , otherwise the same reasoning leads to V n F = U.
If s is a pure spinor representing V, s =

the Xl, . •. ,Xr-l must occur in exp v, h being equal to r - 1 : (exp V)Xl .. . Xr-l =
Xl • • ' xr-l ' The space V is uniquely determined by s.
Conversely, Xl .. . xr-d is a pure spinor and represents a m.t.i.s. of different
parity, also containing U.

8.1.4
Decomposition of the Clifford algebra as a direct sum of minimal
left ideals.
Lemma 8.1.7 The isotropic r-vectors f and I' determine the same minimal left
ideal if and only if they are collinear.
Proof. By the Witt theorem, a 5 E Pin(Q) can be found, such that 5f5- 1 = 1';
if C(Q)f = C(Q)I', there exists a s E C(Q) such that f5- 1 = sf, which, by
Proposition (8.1.1), implies that jS-1 = .xd, .xl E K· . Using {3 : Sf --+ N(5).xd,
I' = .xf, .x E K'; the converse is obvious.
Iff and I' are not collinear, they determine different left ideals, whose intersection
must be 0 by minimality.
I
Consider the Witt decomposition and its adapted basis {Xi,Yi}, i,j = 1, . .. ,r .
A new adapted Witt basis is obtained if Xk and Yk' are exchanged. If k =I- k', the
isotropic r-vectors Yl.. . Xk . .. Y r and Yl . . . Xk' . . . Yr are not collinear, and the same
holds for any pair of isotropic r-vectors obtained by replacing a sequence of p different
elements Yk1Yk2 ' - v»; by Xk1Xk2 "
, X kp (1 < p:::; r, kl < k2 < ' " < kp ) . In this way,
a system of 2r isotropic r-vectors determining 2r minimal left ideals is found; the
intersection of any two of these ideals is O. The Clifford algebra is the direct sum of
these 2r ideals, so we have :
Proposition 8.1.5 The Clifford algebra C(Q), Q being neutral, is the direct sum
of minimal left ideals determined by 2r isotropic r-vectors.

Consider f3(uJ)vf = f3(J)f3(u)vf = Eff3(u)vf where E= (_ly(r-l)/2.
f3(uJ)vf E C(Q)f n fC(Q),
so it is a pure spinor and by Proposition (8.1.1), we can write :
f3(uJ)vf = B(uf, vJ)f,
B being a bilinear form on S x S.
The following properties are immediately obtained :

Finally, B(vf,uJ)f = f3(J)f3(v)uf = Ef3(J)f3(u)vf and
f3(B(vf,uJ)J) = EB(vf,uJ)f = f3(J)f3(u)vf.

Proposition 8.2.2 Let V and V' be two m .t.i.s. in E and let uf and u'f be their

(9)
Proposition 8.2.3 All invariantbilinear forms for the spin representation pt of Gt
are linear combinations of Band 13.
Proof. Let B' be such a bilinear form . S· being the dual of the spinor space S, there
exists a dual representation w to pt, w(g) = (pt)T(g-l) by definition.
Define <1> by <1>, : t -+ B(s,t) and <1>' by

By (2) :
i.e.
(<1> 0 pt(g)s,t) = (<1>(s),pt(g-l)t) = (pt T(g-l) 0 <1>(s),t),
or w(g) 0 <1> =
<1> 0 pt(g) and , similarly, w(g) 0 <1>' = <1>' 0 pt(g).
<1> being bijective (since B is non-degenerate), this leads to
VJ = <1> -1<1>' commutes with all pt(g), hence with all p+(u) for which u is generated
in G(Q) by the elements of Gt. But all u E G+(Q) can be generated in this way (d.

8.3
The tensor product of a spin representation with itself or with its
dual.
We still assume that dim E = 2r and that Q is non-degenerate of maximal index r .
8.3.1
Definition 8.3.1 P being a spin representation of the Cliffordgroup G in the space
S, we set :
(p 0 p)g(s 0 t) = p(g)(s) 0 p(g)(t) ,
'<Is, t E S,
vs E G.
This is the classical definition of the tensor product of a representation p with itself.
In what follows, we will take S = C(Q)j, the Clifford algebra C(Q) being simple,
and we use the notations of Chapter 5, 2.1.
Proposition 8.3.1 S 0 S can be identified with C(Q) and the representation p0 p
can be identified with the representation X given by
Xg(W) = N(g)gwg-1,
9 E G,
wE C(Q) .
(1)
Proof. Let
TJ : (uj, vI) E S x S --+ ujf3(v) E C(Q), f3 being the main antiautomor-
phism, then
TJ is bilinear and by a classical result (Chapter 2, 1.7), there exists a
linear mapping 'l/J : S 0 S --+ C(Q) such that

We prove that 'l/J(S 0 S) = C(Q). C(Q) being simple, it is sufficient to verify that
'l/J(S 0 S) is a two-sided ideal, S 0 Sand C(Q) having the same dimension.

If wE C(Q), wuf{3(v) E .,p(S ~ S) and
uf{3(v)w = uf{3({3(w)v) E .,p(S ~ S),
so .,p(S ~ S) = C(Q) and .,p is a linear isomorphism.
Identifying the two spaces
using .,p, guf ~ gvf is identified with guf{3(gv) = guf{3(v ){3(g). But {3(g) = s:' N(g)
(Chapter 4, 1.2), so guf{3(gv) = N(g)guf{3(v)g-l = N(g)g(uf ~ VI)g-l, and since
C(Q) is linearly generated by the uf ~ vt, the proposition is proved.

Proposition 8.3.2 w being the dual representation of p (i.e. w(g) = pT(g-l), 9 E
G), S ~ {3(S) can be identified with C(Q) and the representation p ~ w of G can be
identified with the representation Ad for which
(Adg)w = gwg- 1.
Proof. Defining as in 2.1 the bilinear form B by
(2)
B(u]; vI)f = {3(uI)vi,
(ff = {3U)),
({3(uI), vI) -+ B(11.f, VI) is a non-degenerate bilinear form from fC( Q) ~ C(Q)f to
K, allowing us to linearly identify fC(Q) with the dual of C(Q)f :
(Ju ,vf) = fB({3(u)f,vI) .
Considering pT(g-l),
(JU,g-lV!) = fB({3(u)f,g-lVI) = fN(g)B(g{3(u)f, vI)
=
fB({3(ug-1)f,vI) = (Jug-t,vI),
pT(g-l) is seen to be the multiplication by s:' from the right, in fC( Q),
(p ~ w)(g)(uf ~ vI) = guf ~ ive" .
Replacing 7J by (uf,vI) -+ ufv in the proof of Proposition (8.3.1), guf ~ fvg- 1 and
g(UfV)g-l can be identified in the same way.

Corollary 8.3.1 The representation p x p defines a representation (p x p)h ofG in
Ch/Ch-l, Ch being the subspace of C(Q) generated by the products of at most h

The representations 0" of O(Q).
1£ for each w E C( Q) we construct gwg- 1 , the same result is obtained if 9 is replaced

a representation of O(Q) into C(Q), or into /\(E), after a linear identification, is
obtained. 0'P(g) preserves C,,/C"-l (which is linearly identified with /\"(E)) yielding
a representation 0" of O(Q) in that space.

In fact, Proposition (8.3.2) does not require the hypothesis that dim E be even
and that Q be of maximal index. We will give an example related to the complex
vectorial formalism introduced in Chapter 7, 2.3.
Take 9 in the connected component of the identity in Spin(1,3), written as
Spino(1,3) and the space CdCl which can be identified with the Lie algebra of
this group.

The action of 9 gives rise to a new C-linear basis

(e~, e~, e~, e;) being a new Lorentz basis.
Taking exterior products a pseudo-metric on 1\2(E) given by

e2 1\ e3 + ieo 1\ el etc. (linearly identified with e2e3 + ieOel etc.)

for a 'metric' with isometry group 0(3, C]; by the connectedness only SO(3, C) is
obtained as the image of Spino(1,3) and
SO(3, C) = Spino(l, 3)/Z2 =

Spino(1,3) is just ct, whose index in Spin(1,3) is 2, so that

Chapter 9
THE SPINORS IN MAXIMAL INDEX AND ODD
DIMENSION.
In this chapter, Q is assumed non-degenerate and of maximal index r, dim E = n =
2r + 1.
Such a situation was already considered for K = C in Chapter 5, 2.2.
By the results of Chapter 3, sections 3.2 and 3.3, C(Q) is isomorphic to the Clif-
ford algebra C+(Qd ofa (2r+2)-dimensional space (Ell Ql) and C+(Q) is isomorphic
to the Clifford algebra of a (2r)-dimensional space (E l , Ql)'
These isomorphisms are not unique. C+(Q) is simple, C(Q) is semi-simple, being
the direct composition of two simple ideals.
Two possibilities arise for the study of these Clifford algebras : either E is con-
sidered as a subspace of El , or El is considered as a subspace of E; the former is
suited to the study of m.t .i.s. of E, the latter is better adapted for the construction
of the irreducible representations of C+(Q) and of the standard spinors.
9.1
Standard spinors.
9.1.1
Let F and F' be two m.t.i.s. in E and let Zo E E be non -isotropic, such that
E = F EIJ F' EIJ (zo),
Q(zo) = a E K*,
is a Witt decomposition, El = F EIJ F' being orthogonal to zoo
Just as in the proof of Theorem (3.3.2), we can introduce the 'metric' Ql on El
with:
then Ql is, up to a non-zero factor, the induced metric. (If K = C, the factor can
be assumed equal to 1.)
The isomorphismj : C(Qd ~ C+(Q) is the natural extension ofy E E l ~ zoy E
C+(Q).
118

THE SPINORS IN MAXIMAL INDEX AND ODD DIMENSION.
The standard spin representation of C(QI) is in the space
S = {Xi,Xi2 " ,xi"f , f = YIY2· " Yr},
119
{Xi,Yj} being a Witt basis for (F EB F', Q); note that S is a subset of C(QI) ' By the
isomorphism i, S corresponds to a set of elements u+ f = (ut + zou;)J if r is even,
u+ fzo = (ut + zou2)fzo if r is odd.
We can restrict ourselves to the first form for any parity of r and choose for the
irreducible representation of C+(Q) the space of
on which C+(Q) acts by left multiplication.
9.1.2
A fundamental invariant 2-form for Gt.
If (u+f, v+I) is a pair of standard spinors, we set as before :
If f3(J) = ej,
f3(u+ I)(v+I) = eff3(unvt f + aeff3(u;)v; f + eff3(unzov; f + eff3(u;)zovtf.
If r is odd, the first two terms vanish, if r is even, the last two terms vanish .
Definition 9.1.1 The fundamenta12-form B is defined by
B(u+t, v+I)f = f3( u+1)(v+I)
if r is even,
B(u+i, v+I)zof = f3(u+ 1)(v+I)
if r is odd.
Obviously B is non-degenerate and invariant under Gt . If r = 0, 1(mod 4), B is
symmetric; if r = 2,3 (mod 4), B is antisymmetric. B is defined analogously. Both
Band B can be extended to C(Q)f.
9.2
M.t.i.s. and pure spinors.
Given Zo, Q(zo) = a ::j. 0, the m.t.i.s. of (zo).L = El are the same for the quadratic
form Q as for Ql ' Hence, in E I , the results of Chapter 8 hold . But we want to study
the m.t.i.s. of E rather than El .
Consider (E ,Q) as a subspace of the (2r + 2)-dimensional space (EI , Ql)'
El

QI(Z~) = -a, QI(X) = Q(x)
if
X E E. Ql has rank 2r + 2, PI = F EB (xo) and P{ = F' EB (Yo) are m.t.i.s.
of El , (xo) being determined by Zo + z~ and (Yo) by Zo -
z~ .
We may assume

Pl $ Pt·
C(Q) can be identified with the sub-algebra of C(Ql) generated by E . C+(Q)
and C(Q) are semi-simple and isomorphic, so the spinor spaces are (2r)-dimensional.
The spinor space S for C+(Q) is determined by the Xii . .. Xi,.!, the even spinor
space st for C+(Ql) is determined by the basis consisting of the Xii • . . Xi"XO!YO, h
being odd, and the Xii . . . Xi,,!yo, h even .
The representations in the irreducible spaces Sand st are equivalent; one can
for instance associate Xii .. . Xi,,!yo to Xii •• . Xi,,! if h is even and Xii· .. Xi"XO!YO to
it if h is odd.
The representations of the Clifford groups G+ and at of C+(Q) and C+((h)
generate these algebras and are therefore also equivalent. Writing p+ and pt for
them, i being the equivalence, G+ c at leads to
pHg) 0 i = i 0 p+(g),
V9 E G+.
The isomorphism between C(Q) and C+(Ql) not being unique, if i' also has the
previous property, viz. pt(g) 0 i' = i' 0 p+(g),
w = i-l oi' commutes with the left action of 9 and, G+ generating the central algebra
C+(Q), w is a homothety.
Hence tbe equivalence between tbe representations in S and in st is unique up
to a non-zero scalar factor.
9.2.1
The pure spinors in the odd-dimensional case (maximal index).
Let V be a m.t.i.s. of E, hence an r-dimensional subspace. It is also a m.t.i.s. of El
for the quadratic form Ql and by Corollary (8.1.4), it is contained in exactly one
even m.t.i.s. Vi of s;
Let 31 be a pure spinor representing Vi and let u be the spinor s E S for which
i(s) = 31, then by the preceding results, u is determined up to a non-zero scalar
factor.
Definition 9.2.1 i : S -+ st being tbe representation equivalence, a spinor of tbe
space generated by s E S is called a pure spinor if i(s) is a pure spinor.
V is contained in a unique even m.t.i.s. of s; Conversely, if Vi is an even m.t.i.s.
of El , Vi n E is totally isotropic in E, hence necessarily r-dimensional (the only
possible dimensions being rand r + 1).

Lemma 9.2.1 There exists a bijection between the set of m.t.i.s. in E and the set
of even m.t.i.s. in E1, every m.t.i.s. of S being represented by a pure spinor, unique
up to a non-zero scalar factor.
Proposition 9.2.1 Let V be a m.t.i.s. of E whose representative pure spinor is s
and let z be an invertible element of the centerofC(Q), z rf:. K.
1. V is the set of all x E E such that p+(zx)(s) = 0.
2. If s' E S is such that p+(ZX)(S')= 0, \Ix E V, then s' = AS, A E K*.
3. If 9 E G+, p+(g)(s) represents cp(g)(V).
Proof. p+(zx)(s) = °if and only if i 0 p+(zx)(s) = 0, i.e.
(pt(zx))(st} = 0,
Sl = i(s),
or (pt(X))(Sl) = 0, z being invertible in the center; this implies by Lemma (8.1.3)
that x E 'Cl, so x E V since x is also an element of E. This proves 1.
If 9 E G+,
i 0 p+(g)(s) = Pi(g)(st}
so t.hat i op+(g)(s) represents cp(g)('Cl) by the results of Chapter 8. V being a subset
of Vi, cp(g)V is contained in cp(g)(Vi), so p+(g)(s) represents cp(g)V, proving 3.
Taking the representation in S = ur] (ef. 1.1), the stated property can be ex-
pressed by zx(u+ J) = 0, S' = u+!, \Ix E V ; this property for V extends to F' (ef.
the proof of Lemma (8.1.3)), the even m.t.i .s. containing F ' is F' EI1 (Yo) = F{.

Chapter 10
THE HERMITIAN STRUCTURE ON THE SPACE OF
COMPLEX SPINORS-CONJUGATIONS AND
RELATED NOTIONS.
10.1
Some background and preliminary results.
10.1.1
Sesquilinear forms and hermitian forms.
K is the complex number field C. a stands for the complex conjugate of a .
An n-dimensional complex vector space E can be given another complex vector
space structure if we replace the product ax, x E E, by ax, without changing
anything else. This space will be written E. Every basis of E is a basis of E and
vice versa. If Oi, i = 1,2, .. . ,r is a basis for the dual E' of E, the {;i defined by
{;i(x) = (ji(x) form a basis of the dual E'.
A sesquilinear form B on Ex E is a bilinear form on E x E, i.e.
B(ax,y) = aB(x,y),
Vx,y E E ,
Va E C .
(1)
Nothing else changes and the theory of bilinear forms developed in Chapter 1 car-
ries through. A sesquilinear form B such that B( x,y) = B(y, x) is called bermitian
sesquilinear (or also bermi tian symmetric).
The orthogonal space V.L to the subspace V of E is defined as before, just as the
concepts of isotropic subspace, totally isotropic subspace and non-isotropic subspace.
If B is non-degenerate and if V is non-isotropic, E = V EI1 V.L.
B(z , x) = H(x) is the bermitian form associated to B.
Conversely, B can be
retrieved from H if we set
4B(x,y) = H(x +y) - H(x - y) +iH(x +iy) - iH(x - iy) .
(2)
It can be proved that E, given a hermitian sesquilinear form, has bases consisting
of pairwise orthogonal vectors; more precisely, vectors Xl, X2, . . . , Xh E E exist such
that

p being the rank of B, Aij E K· . Since we are working over the complex field, a basis
can be found for which
p
B(x,y) = I>i[i7/i,
fi = ±1,
i=1
(3)
~ i and 7/i being the coordinates of x and y in this basis .
The index r of the hermitian sesquilinear form B is also the maximal dimension
of the totally isotropic subspaces and 2r ~ n. A Witt decomposition and a Witt
theorem can be proved in this setting too : the reasoning is completely similar to
the orthogonal case.
A finite-dimensional complex vector space provided with a positive definite her-
mitian sesquilinear form is called a hermitian space, i.e, B(x,x) 2: 0,
Vx E E and
B(x, x) = 0 implies x = O.
If the rank of B is n, B being non-degenerate, the space is called pseudo-
hermitian. By (3),

10.1.2
Conjugations in representation space.
The following definitions hold both for algebra representations and for group rep-
resentations. Let us consider the representations of an associative algebra A in a
complex vector space E . E is an A-module (d. Chapter 5),
(a,x) E A X E -+ ax E E .
Definition 10.1.1 A conjugation is a homomorphism J of the A-module E such
that J is semi-linear, i.e. J(o:x) = aJ(x), and J2 = ± Id.
J being an A-module homomorphism of E , J(ax) = aJ(x) and J(X1 +X2) = J(xd+
J(X2)' Clearly the product of two conjugations is an A-linear isomorphism.
Recall that the quaternion skewfield H is a two-dimensional complex vector space.
Now consider the cases J2 = Id and J2 = - Id separately.
1. J2 = - Id.
If E has the structure of a 'left' vector space over H, it is a complex vector
space of twice that dimension.
Using the classical notations i, i, k for the
standard basis of Hover R, set
J(x) = jx,
x E E
J(o:x) = [ccx = ajx = aJ(x).
j defines a conjugation J such that J2 = - Id.

124
CHAPTER 10
Conversely, if an A-module homomorphism J of W exists and j2 = - Id,
J(o:x) = aJ(x), then if:r is the endomorphism defined by i,
aJ = -sa
and J, :r generate a quaternion algebra, W becomes a vector space over H in
a natural way and hence:
Proposition 10.1.1 A conjugation J such that j2 = - Id corresponds to a
quaternionic representation .
2. j2 = Id.
Note that if E is real, j2 = Id for J = ±1.
On Ee = C0RE we set J(o:®x) = a®J(x) and a(o:®x) = o:®(ax), a E A.
Ee then has a conjugation satisfying j2 = Id.
On Ee, with its real structure, J can be considered as R-linear; Ee as the
direct sum of EI and E2 , the real proper subspaces of Ee associated to the
eigenvalues 1 and -1 of J.
Conversely, if W is a complex representation space and J is a conjugation such
that j2 = Id, r(W) being the 'realified' space of W, the set of x E r(W) such
that J(x) = z or J(x) = -x form real subspaces E 1 and E2 whose direct sum
is r(W)j x -+ ix exchanging these spaces, they are of equal dimension,
EI = (1 + J)r(W),
E2 = (I - J)r(W),
and E I , E2 are A-modules. Therefore :
Proposition 10.1.2 To each representation into a complex space having a
conjugation J such that j2 = Id, two equivalent real representations can be
associated. J2 = Id corresponds to a real representation.
10.2
The fundamental hermitian sesquilinear form. Special cases.
10.2.1
We consider the complexification (E', QI) of a real vector space (E, Q), Q being
non-degenerate, of signature (p,n - p) :
B being the symmetric bilinear form associated to Q and, for instance, p :::; n - p,
dimE = n = 2r.

Let E' = F EB F' be a Witt decomposition.

the (Xi ,Yi) form a special 'real' Witt basis , adapted to the decomposition F EB F '
and associated to the ordered real basis (el' . .. ' en), (ei)2 = 1, i ~ p, (el)2 = -1,
i ~ p+1. (The reader will have no difficulty to write down a special 'real' Witt basis
if p > n - p.)
On the complexification E' of the real space E there exists a complex conjugation;
taking a real basis in E', the complex conjugation is seen to be a linear mapping
from E' to F;I (d. 1.1) . From this one proves, along the same lines as in Chapter
3, 1.2 for the main automorphism a, that the complex conjugation is a semi-linear
isomorphism of C(QI) and that it commutes with a and /3.
If I is an isotropic r-vector determining a m.t.i.s. (so it is unique up to a non-zero
scalar factor), 1 determines the complex conjugate m.t.i.s. (generally, we will use the
bar to denote the complex conjugation) .
By Proposition (8.1.1), III = V ,). E C.
If I is a m.t.i.s. defining F ', then either
1. 11 = 0, I being collinear to YIY2 .. .Yn this will happen if p i- 0 and, in
particular, if Q is neutral (F' = PI).
2. 11i- 0, III = ).1, ).:f: O. This occurs if p = o. III = V implies 111 = ~l ,
(JJ)(JJ) = ).1I and (JJ)(JJ) = ~lI so ). is real.
In general, III i- 0 will mean that F' n PI = 0, by Proposition (8.2.2), whereas
III = 0 will mean that F'n PIi- o.
We will first study these two cases, which occur in the neutral case and in the
elliptic case.
10.2.2
1. The invariant hermitian sesquilinear form when 1 = exp(iO)/, 0 E
R.
Let us consider the fundamental bilinear form Band B(ul,vJ). We define
/3(uJ)vl = a1i(u/, vJ)1
(1)

126
CHAPTER 10
where a is chosen such as to turn 1{ into a hermitian sesquilinear form .
This condition means, explicitly,
aexp(iO) = ec,
e = (_ly(r-l)/2. Therefore it is sufficient to take some square root of fexp(iO)
for a.
Obviously 1{ is invariant under Go and non-degenerate.
Such considerations clearly hold for 13 as well, and for any real linear combi-
nation of Band 13, but the invariance then reduces to Gt.
2. The invariant hermitian sesquilinear form when]f ::I o.
Note that the
linear mapping
u] E C(Q')] -+ u]f E C(Q')f
is bijective, since u]f = u'f f implies that u]f] = ulf f], u>.] = u'>'] or si]=
u' j. Therefore this mapping is an equivalence between the spin representations
in C(QI)] and in C(Q')f.
In this case we define
(3(u]f)vf = 1{(uv, vf)f
(2)
1{ has hermitian symmetry by an elementary computation and because ,X is
real.
1{ is non-degenerate and invariant under Go; the same conclusions hold as in
case 1.
10.2.3
The 'charge conjugation' and the 'Dirac adjoint'.
In the first case, ] = exp(iO)f, consider
quI) =exp(ia)u] = exp(i(a - O»uf.
C is semi-linear and C2 = Id. Furthermore, if 9 E G, the real Clifford group,
C(guf) = gC(uf).
One easily verifies that
1t(C(uI),vf) = f1{(C(Vf),uf) .

The semi-linear mapping A from S = C(Q')f to fC( QI) will be called the Dirac

Remarks.
• One might wonder what relationship exists between e' and the sign of A (where
III = AI, lI::f. 0).
Since II belongs to the intersection of the ideals C( Q')I and to;Q'), we can
define (d. Lemma (8.1.2))
lI=a-yI,
aEe',
and an easy computation then shows that ao = Ae' so that A and e' have the
same sign.
• If 1 = exp(iO)I, -yI-y-1 = exp(iO)I implies -yl = exp(iO/2)I and ;;;nI = I,
e' = 1.
Relying on these remarks, some verifications can be carried out.
We will now study different questions concerning the m.t.i.s. and the isotropic
r-veetors determining them, eventually giving the explicit geometric meaning of e',
In the following I determines the m.t.i.s. Pl.
Lemma 10.3.3 If-yl is a pure spinor determining Pi, ,E Pin(QI), x is an element
of Pi if and only if x-yl = O. If -y E Pin(QI) and if x-yf = 0, Vx E Pi, -yl is a pure
spinor and determines Pl.
Proof. This is a special case of Lemma (8.1.3).
•
Lemma 10.3.4 If B is the real symmetric bilinear form associated to Q and if
B(y,y) = 0 for all y E F ', B(y,x) = 0 for all x E F' and Pi = F'.
Proof. Apply the hypothesis to y + x and y +ix; Pi is orthogonal to F' and F' being
a m.t.i.s., F ' = Pi follows.
•
Lemma 10.3.5 If B(y, y) ::f. 0, for all non-zero y E F', a Witt basis
(Xl, . . . , xr , Y1, . . . ,Yr)
can be found such that
iii = OXi,
0 = ±1,
i = 1,2, . . . ,r,
Fin pi = 0
and 0 does not depend on i.
Proof. Choosing Y1 E F', we set Xl = ±Y1; Xl cannot be collinear with Y1 . H1 =
(Xl, yd is non-isotropic and B(X1' yd = 1/2 can be assumed, B(Y1' iii) being real;
Y2 E F' n (H1)J. and X2 = ±jh are chosen such that H2 = (X1,X2,Y1.Y2) is non-
isotropic and B(Xi,Yj) = oij/2, i,j = 1,2, etc. Finally a Witt basis of the stated
type is obtained, and Pi = (Xl, X2, . . . ,Xr), F' = (Y1'Y2, . . . .v-) .
B(y, y) is real and has the same sign on all of F', so either 0 = 1 or 0 = -1
regardless of the index.

Proposition 10.3.1 IfF' is a m .i.i.s. ofthe space Ec = E' and dim(FlnF') = r-h,
1. a Witt basis
can be constructed, such that the isotropic vectors YI,Y2 , . . . ,Yr generate F',
Yh+l,Yh+2, . . . ,Yr form a basis of F' n F' and YI = OXI, ' . . ,Yh = OXh, 0 being
either 1 or -1,
2. if "Yf is a pure spinor determining F', we can choose:
up to a scalar factor, and
up to a scalar factor.
Proof. If h = 0, 1 is obvious since F' = F' and "Y = 1 will do.
Assume that h > O.
By Lemma (10.3.4), there exists a YI E F' such that
B(Y1>ih) = ±1/2.
Let HI = (YI,yd, then HI is non-isotropic and so is (HI)J. .
F{ = (HI)J. n pi is (r - I)-dimensional. If B(y, y) = 0 for all Y E F{, F{ = F{
by Lemma (10.3.4), therefore a Witt basis can be constructed with Xl = ±YI and
Y2,Ya,·· ·, Yr E F{ n F{ = F' nF', proving 1.
If there exists a Y2 E F{ such that B(Y2,Y2) = ±1/2, we construct the non-
isotropic space H2 = (Yl, Y2 , YI ,Y2) and obtain the same situation, so we can proceed
as in the proof of Lemma (10.3.5).
We still have to prove that 0 does not depend on the index i = 1,2, .. . , h. Suppose
that Yh = Xh and Yh-l = -Xh-l ' We can construct Zl = Yh+>'Yh-l such that .x>. = 1,
Zl = Xh - >'Xh-l implying that B(z1>Zl) = O. To Zl we can add
Z2 = Yh - >'Yh-l'
The (r - h + 2)-dimensional space F~ = (Zl, Z2,Yh+l, . . . ,Yr) satisfies the conditions
of Lemma (10.3.4), but F~ is the intersection of F' with the non-isotropic subspace
K = GJ., where G = (XI , . . . ,Xh-2,YI,' . . ,Yh-2)'
Lemma (10.3.4) can be applied to the non-degenerate restriction of B to K . Then
F~ = F~, so F' n PI contains F~ , which is impossible, the dimension of F' n F' being
r - h.
The proof of 2 uses Lemma (10.3.3), verifying that "Ix E F/, x"Yf = O. This can
be tested for Xl, • . . , Xh,Yh+l, . . . ,Yr :
and since the Yi, i 2: h+1, can be expressed in terms of the Yj, j 2: h + 1, the same
holds for them.

Lemma 10.3.6 If W is an h-dimensional complex subspace of the m.t.i.s. F' and
W = W, a basis Yl, Y2, · · ., Yh of W can be found such that Yl = ih, ···, Yh = iih.
Proof. Consider Zl E W . If Zl = AZl' A E C, A = exp(iO), taking Yl = exp(iO/2)Zl'
one obtains Yl = iii.
If (Yl, iii) is linearly independent, we form Yl = Zl +Zl and Y2 = i(Zl - Zl), then
Yl = iii, Y2 = ii2.
Suppose that we have obtained a linearly independent system Yl, Y2, . .. ,Yo, where
Yl = iii, .. . ,Yo = ii0 and let Zo+l not belong to the space generated by these s vectors.
If the system Yl, . .. , Yo , Zo+l, Zo+l is linearly independent, we set Yo+l = Zo+l + Zo+l
and Yo+2 = i(zO+l - zo+d. If the system is linearly dependent,
and we take Zo+l = Z.+l - Ei=l aiYi different from zero. Choosing the ai such that
Zo+l = Y.+l / Qo+l and the previous situation is obtained.

Proof.
1 follows from Proposition (10.3.1) and Lemma (10.3.6).
2 has already been proved.
3 can be proved using the construction method for a special Witt basis .
If the first 2h vectors of a Witt basis of the indicated type have been constructed,
we choose Yh+l = iih+l and Xh+l, then

The Sylvester decomposition of Q then contains 2h + T - h = h+ r positive terms

If 6 = -1, an analogous method leads to h + T negative terms and p =

Note that if(p, n-p) is the signature ofQ where p positive terms occur, h = p-r

By the definition and the properties of pure spinors, we may write
(3(uJ) = a7-£(uf, vfh f .
a and 7-£(u ]; v J) being scalar. a fixed.
7-£ is a non-degenerate sesquilinear form, as can easily be verified, and we will
choose a such that 7-£ is hermitian.
From (3(iiJ)uf = a7-£(vf,ufhf, (3(uJ)vft =
f.a7-£(vf,uJ)! if NCr) = 1, so
(3(uJ)vf = f.f!a1-l(vf.ufhf and for 7-£ to be hermitian. f.f.'a = a must hold; so we
can choose a = exp(iO) such that a2 = f.f./. The definition can be reformulated as
follows :
Definition 10.3.1 For the even dimensions, we define a hermitian sesquilinear form
7-£ on the complex spin or space, by
(3(uJ)vf = a7-£(uf,»Tnt,
a2 = ee',
(where! = Ifl-1, I E GO(Q'), tlf = f.lf and (3(J) = ej).
(2)
Note that the definition of 7-£ only depends on I
by a factor of ±1 (r can be
replaced by IT, T E H') . a can be chosen as 1 or i. Obviously, 7-£ is invariant under
Go.
Remarks.
We could take lEG' and absorb the coefficient a in I; 7-£ would then
be hermitian under a certain condition on I .
Clearly 7-£ can be replaced by any non-zero real multiple.
We will find the conditions for the positive definiteness of 7-£ in section 3.5.
Using iJ instead of (3 yields a form il which is invariant under Gt.

An application to quantum mechanics.
Definition 10.3.2 Let w E G(Q'), then by left multiplication, w defines a linear
operator, which is called hermitian if
H(uj,wvJ) = H(wuj,vJ) ,
uj,vj E S.
Obviously this condition is equivalent to :
(3(w) = w .
Note that if A is this operator, H(Aep,'l/J) = H(A'l/J, ep), ep = u]; 'l/J = vj, so H(A ·, .)
is a new hermitian form .
In the Minkowski space of signature (+ + +-), f' = 1, 1'j = 0 and ff' = -1.
Take an orthonormal basis :
(ed = -1,

Xl = --2-'
e4 - el
YI = --2- '
(e2)2 = (e3)2 = (e4)2 = 1,

(Xl, X2 ,YI,Y2) form a special Witt basis, Y2 = X2 and we can choose '"1 = -i(X2+Y2) =
e2, NC'Y) = 1,1'"1 = 1.
Writing (9ki) for the components of the pseudo-metric tensor, we define
ek = li ei ·
Then ek defines a hermitian operator Ak. (3(uf)vj = iH(uj,vJ)e2f, setting 'l/J =uj,
(3(7jJ)ek'l/J = iH('l/J,Ak'l/J)e2f.
The four real numbers H('l/J, Ak'l/J) written ('l/J, Ak'l/J) = x» define a vector X called
the 'current vector' relative to H (cf. ultra, Chapter 16). (5) implies that
The charge conjugation multiplies the current vector by -1.
Note that with the other signature, f' = -1 and the current vector is preserved.

form .
• If Q is negative definite : 6= -1, h = r.rt! = (-IYIf, (6)' = (-1)'.
The linear isomorphism of the spinor space with an exterior algebra guarantees
the existence of 2r terms of each parity in the expression of a spinor in terms
of the basis formed by the Xi,Xi, . . . Xi.!.
1-£ is a neutral hermitian form (i.e. of index 2r - 1 ) .

Xi = Xi or Xi = 6Yi and only the latter case could produce a non-vanishing
term if it occurred for i = i l , ... , i,; however, h < r implies that a product
Yh+! . . .Yr will then give O. So the basis vectors of C(Q')f are all isotropic for
1-£. 1-£ being non-degenerate, this means that this basis gives rise to a maximal
Witt decomposition with a (2r )-dimensional m.t.i.s. (relative to 1-£) : 1-£ is
therefore neutral.
This result generalizes the special case of the Minkowski space, for which Dirac
already introduced a neutral sesquilinear form. Summarizing,
Proposition 10.3.4 The hermitian form 1-£ is positive definite if Q is positive defi-
nite, otherwise it is neutral.
Remark.
For /3, it is definite if Q is negative definite, otherwise it is neutral.

The construction of a positive definite sesquilinear form.

of the complex conjugate with an automorphism of the Clifford algebra.
In
particular, if the automorphism a' is the natural extension of the linear map-
ping ej ---+ ej if Q(ej) = 1, ej ---+ -ej if Q(ej) = -1, j = 1,2, . . . ,n = 2r, where
the ej form a fixed orthonormal basis . We will write it = a'(u), u E C(Q').
If,' E Pin(Q') determines the pure spinor ,'f for the generalized complex
conjugate, i.e. f = ,'f,'-l, we see, just as in 3.1, that there exists a scalar
EO equal to ±1 such that f,' f = Eof and EO is well-defined. If, for instance,

" = (Xl + YI)(X2 + Y2) ' " (xr + Yr),

Proposition 10.3.5 1-£+ is a positive definite bermitian sesquilinear form.

ff =I- o.
The definition of u --+ it depends on the choice of the orthonormal basis, but the
conjugation itself is the same for all orthonormal bases determining the same direct

decomposition.
10.3.7
Majorana spinors.
We have noted in section 1.2 that if a conjugation C exists such that C2 = Id in a
space W, the realified space r W of W is the direct sum of two real spaces EI and
E2 such that
E I = (I + C)(rW),
E2 = (I - C)(rW).
These two real space have the same dimension.
If we consider the space of spinors sucb tbat tbe constant f' = 1 (ef. section 3.1),
this space gives rise to such a property; using standard notations from theoretical
physics such a spinor, written .,p, is the sum of two spinors .,pI and .,p2 where
.,pI = (1 + C )(.,p),
2
(10)
The spinors .,pI and .,p2 are called Majorana spinors; the product by i exchanges
them:
(11 )

138
CHAPTER 10
If the complex diinension of the spinor space under consideration is 2r , the real
dimension of the Majorana spinors is also 2r •
C commuting with the action of G, the two Majorana spinor spaces are globally
invariant by the left action of G (which is obvious) : the representation of G in
the spinor space is therefore the sum of two real representations and we note that
p - q = 0,2 (mod 8).
Remark. If C2 =- Id we have seen (in section 1.2) that the spin representation is
'quaternionic'. It is still possible to write 'I/J = 'l/Jl + 'l/J2 uniquely, where
'l/Jl = (1 ~ iC )('I/J),
'l/J2 = (1 ~ iC )('I/J),
C('l/Jd = i'I/J2,
C'l/J2 = -i'I/Jl '
(12)
(13)
This does not lead to a decomposition of the spinor space as a direct sum of two
complex subspaces, since (1 ~ iC )(1 - iC) = 1 and every element 'I/J can be written

the ''l/Jl-form', or also
the ''l/J2-form'.
This situation occurs when p -
q = 4,8 (mod 8) (d. the table in Chapter 3, 2.1).
10.3.8
Weyl spinors.
Let us consider the product eN = ele2 . . . en of the elements of an orthonormal basis.
If n = 2r we know that eN anticommutes with all x E E . By a change of orthonormal
basis, eN transforms in ±eN. We have proved that if c,og(x) = gxg-\ x E E, 9 E G,
c,o(eN) = - IdE.
Hence c,o(eN) extends naturally to the main automorphism of the
Clifford algebra.
It is obvious that eNf = (-It feN,
and eN is a pure spinor, determining aU) (a replaces the complex conjugation).
As a(eN) = (-I)neN, a(eN)eNf = ff, f = ±1 and (-I)n(eN)2 = (eN)2 = f since
n = 2r.
f = (-It(n-l)/2(-lt-p = (-It-p •
By analogy with section 3.3, the transformation W, obtained as the composition

is called the 'Weyl conjugation'. We should then set :
139
but to obtain W2 = Id (in particular for the Minkowski space), (eN)2 = (_l)h
we will introduce a scalar factor TJ such that TJ2 = (_l)h and we define the 'Weyl
conjugation'
W(uf) = TJeNuf.
W commutes with the action of G+ . Putting
(14)
l+W
CPt = (-2-)VJ,
(15)
a spinor can be written as the direct sum of two 'Weyl spinors' such that
(16)
Now it is obvious that a spinor common to the Majorana and the Weyl approach
will exist if and only if C commutes with the product by TJeN, i.e. if r = p (mod 2);
but as p = r or r + 1 modulo 4, for a Majorana spinor, this condition reduces to
p = r modulo 4, and is not satisfied for Minkowski spaces (where p = 1 or 3).
10.3.9
A Weyl-Dirac charge conjugation or 'chiral' conjugation.
eN defines an automorphism of the Clifford algebra whose composition with the usual
complex conjugation yields a new complex conjugation (ef. 3.6). Using the notations
of section 3.6 we will obtain a new factor EO, equal to
and a Weyl-Dirac conjugation follows, using a(u) (it commutes with the action of
G+); the so-called Majorana condition will then be satisfied if
i.e. if (_1)(p-r)(p-r+1)/2 = 1, p = r or r - 1 modulo 4 (or p - q = 0,6 (mod 8)).
Using this definition, a Weyl spinor will be a Majorana spinor if p = r modulo 4.
10.3.10
General conjugations.
To end this study of the even-dimensional case, let us try to find all conjugations
for the representations of the Clifford group G or of its subgroup G+, in the spinor
space C(Q')f.
Given a conjugation C, all other conjugations J can be obtained by taking the
composition of C with a linear isomorphism which commutes with G (or G+) . By the

140
CHAPTER 10
general study of Clifford algebras over even-dimensional spaces with neutral signa-
ture, every linear isomorphism of C(Q')f is a left multiplication by some invertible
element of C(Q').
G is generated by the non-isotropic vectors in E.
If a linear isomorphism of
C(Q')f commutes with all elements of G it must be a scalar, so that relying in
J2 = ± Id, the scalar will be of the form exp(iB), BE R : in this way the conjugation
C of section 3.3 is reobtained.
If we replace G by G+, the linear isomorphism under consideration is the left
multiplication by an invertible element of the center of C+(Q'), G+ being generated
by the products of an even number of non-isotropic vectors. Therefore a conjugation
J can be obtained by applying C (defined in 3.3) and a multiplication by >. + p,eN,
where
(17)
>., p, E C . We have proved :
Proposition 10 .3.6 If the dimension n = 2r,
1. the conjugations C which commute with the action of G are of the form C(uJ) =
exp(iB)u:'Yf, B E R, If being the complex conjugation pure spinor defined in
Proposition (10.3.3). If p is the number of positive terms and q is the number
of negative terms in the Sylvester decomposition of Q, there exist Majorana
spinors for C if and only if p = r or r + 1 modulo 4 (or p - q = 0,2 (mod 8));
Weyl-Majorana spinors exist if p = r modulo 4 (p - q = 0 (mod 8)).
2. the conjugations J which commute with the action of G+ are products of C
defined in 1 and the left action of an element>. + p,eN, eN = ele2 . . . en, under
the conditions expressed by(17). J2 = f'(1)'1 2+1p,1 2(- 1)h)Id, wbete e' is defined
in Proposition (10.3.3) and h = Ir- pl.
G can be replaced by rand G+ by r+ without affecting these results.
Remarks.
1. If h is even, J2 = f' Id, so if h = Ir-pl is even it is impossible to define Majorana
spinors for a conjugation which commutes with G+, if Ir - pi = 2 (mod 4) or
p - q = 4 (mod 8).
The spin representations obtained for p - q = 4(mod8) are of 'quaternionic'
type. In all other cases, they are of 'real' type.
2. To each of these conjugations C there corresponds a Dirac adjoint A by formula
(7) of 3.3.

THE HERMITIAN STRUCTURE ON THE COMPLEX SPINORS.
10.4
Invariant hermitian sesquilinear forms.
141
We are still considering the case where n =
2r.
Let 'HI be a sesquilinear form,
'H1(uf ,vJ) is semi-linear in u] and linear in vf. C being the conjugation of section
3.3, where
Cuf = u,f,
IE Pin(Q');
we define
>.81(uf ,vJ) ='H1(C(uJ),vJ),
AE C"
(1)
A arbitrary but fixed.
8 1 clearly is a C-bilinear form and if 'HI is non-degenerate, the same holds for
8 1 . If 'HI is invariant under the elements of the real Clifford group G, the action of
G commuting with C, 8 1 will also be invariant. Conversely, given 8 1, (1) determines
'HI. We say that 8 1 and 'HI are associated.
We will study the sesquilinear forms invariant under the action of Gt.
In particular, the forms 8 and 'H introduced before are associated, since
{:J(C(uJ))vf = {:J(u,J)vf = (:J(uh)vf = I3b){:J(uf)vf,
and I can be chosen in Go(Q') so that Nb) = 1, and II3(C(uJ))vf = {:J(uJ)vf, or
f'
-
>,'H(uf, vfhf = (:J(uJ)vf
which is of the form introduced in 3.2 to define 'H.
By the previous results, every C-bilinear form 8 1 , invariant under the action of
Gt, can be written as
We have obtained :
Proposition 10.4.1 Every sesquilinear form on the spinors which is invariant under
the action of Gt is of the form
'HI = 01'H + I3di,
01,131 E C,
where'H and it are associated to 8 and B.
Let us now assume that the sesquilinear forms are hermitian, the condition is
expressed on 8 1 by
A81(C(uJ) ,vJ) = A8 1(C(vJ),uJ),
it will be satisfied by 8 and 8 for a suitable choice of >..
Indeed, the preceding
computations and the results of 3.2 show that we must take
,-
ffa = a,
a being f'/ A, or Aff' = .x, which can always be done if Ais 1 or i. The same holds
for 8, where >'ff' = .x and f = (_ly(r+l)/2 . Therefore :

142
CHAPTER 10
Proposition 10.4.2 Every hermitian sesquilinear form on the spinors which is in-
variant under the action of Gt is of the form
'H and it being the hermitian sesquilinear forms defined by
/3(uf)vj = a'H(uj,vjhj,
S(uf)vj = ait(uj,vjhj,
a = ff'a (so a = 1 or i) and -yj being the conjugation pure spinor.
This Proposition completes a remark in section 3.2.
Remark.
The hermitian sesquilinear forms which are invariant under the action of
all Go (instead of just Gt) are of the form 0.1'H. These are also the forms for which
the action of z E E is a self-adjoint operator. The forms /31it are these for which
x E E is anti-self-adjoint.
If u] and vj are Majorana, a k = ±I, ±i exists such that 'HI(uj, V J) = kB l (uj, V J).
If 'HI is hermitian, 'HI(vj, uJ) = kB l (uj, vJ) = ±kBl ( u], vJ) if we assume also that
Bl is either symmetric or antisymmetric.
Hence Bl (uj, V J) is either real or pure
imaginary, for all pairs of Majorana spinors.
10.5
Conjugations and hermitian sesquilinear forms if n = 2r + 1.
The real (n = 2r +I)-dimensional space E is given a non-degenerate quadratic form
Q of signature (p,q).
By Theorem (3.3.2), if Zo E E, Zo being non-isotropic, C+(Q) is isomorphic to
the Clifford algebra C(Qd of (zo).L = EI given the quadratic form Ql = -aQ where
Q(zo) = a. The study of C+(Q) can be reduced to that of the simple central algebra
C(QI)'
Consider the complexified space (E', Q') of (E, Q) and its Witt decomposition
E' = F EEl F' EEl (zo),
F EEl F' is also a Witt decomposition for the complexified space (E~, Q~) of (E l , QI)
and we can consider the space S = {Xii Xi2 . .. Xihj, j = YlY2 . .. Yr} (d. Chapter 9),
as the spinor space for the Clifford algebra C(QD, isomorphic to C+(Q').
We may assume that a = ±1.
Defining 1 = -yi-r', -y E Pin(QD, we set Cl (uJ) = u-yj and it is obvious that
q = e'Td, f' being computed for (El , Ql)'
This conjugation allows us to define Majorana spinors if and only if f' = 1, i.e. if
a = -1, P = (p + q - 1)/2 or (p + q - 1)/2 + 1 modulo 4, or p - q = ±I (mod 8).
If a = 1, p and q are exchanged and the same condition is obtained.

THE HERMITIAN STRUCTURE ON THE COMPLEX SPINORS.
143
A conjugation C on the spinor space of C+(Q') will be defined by C1 and the
isomorphism j
: C(Q1) --t C+(Q) which associated ZoY E C+(Q) to Y E E1 (d.
Chapter 9), i.e.
C(j(uf)) = j(C1(uf)).
In the spinor space for C(QD the notion of Weyl spinor is well-defined, j can be
used to define it in C+(Q').
There exists a second method to define a conjugation, if we consider, using the
notations of Chapter 9, 1.1, the irreducible representation of C+(Q') by left multi-
plication in the space of
u+1 = (ut +zou2)f.
By a result proved in Chapter 4, 1.6, the algebras C+(Q) and C+(-Q) are iso-
morphic. Therefore we can assume that q > 1.
We choose Q(zo) = -1, (zo).1. is a space of signature (p,q- 1) and if J = ,1,-1,
there exists a, E Pin(Q') having the same parity as Ir- pi (by Proposition (10.3.3)).
1. If h = Ir- pi is even, we take
2. If h is odd, "
= ,Zo is such that ,'!r,-l = (-1Yj.
(a) If r is even, we define
C(u+ f) = fj,+,zof.
(b) If r is odd, we consider in (zo).1. the orthonormal basis e1, e2, ... ,e2r,
," = 'ZOe1e2 ... e2r then satisfies ,"1,,,-1 = j and we define
C(u+ f) = fj,+,zoe1 e2 ' " e2rl,
C then commutes with the action of G+.
Majorana spinors will exist for this conjugation if and only if p = r or r + 1,
modulo 4 (d. section 3.3), i.e. if p - q = ±1 (mod 8).
Once the pure spinor ,lis constructed, the latter method allows the construction
of a hermitian sesquilinear form 1£ using a similar method to that of the even-
dimensional case, viz.
f3(u+f)v+1 = al£(u+l,v+f),I,
a 2 =
EE'
where the notations are analogous to those of 3.2. 1£ is invariant under Gt.
Other results, analogous to those obtained in the even-dimensional case, can then
be established by routine computations.
Remark.
We have obtained Majorana spinors when p - q = 0,1,2 (mod8), in
accordance with the results of Chapter 3,2.1. Also note that for p- q = 4,6 (mod 8)
we have obtained spinors which correspond to the quaternionic representation of the
real Clifford group G. These results can be summarized as follows:

SPINORIALITY GROUPS.
We use the hypotheses of Chapter 10, 2, dim E = n = 2r, E being real, E' denotes
its complexification. In the notations of Chapter 10, 2.1, f = Y1Y2 . . .Yr defines the
m.t.i.s. F' .
11.1
Definition 11.1.1 H is the subgroup of, E Spin(Q) such that
,f = ±f
and p(H) = Q is the spinoriality group associated to f.
Note that if another isotropic r- vector l' was chosen in F', l' = x], >. E C, and
the definition of Hand Q is therefore independent of the choice of f.
If another m.t.i.s. of E' is chosen, H will change into a conjugated subgroup of
Pin(Q'), but also :
Lemma 11.1.1 Two subgroups H and Hi associated to f and I, by Definition
(11.1.1) are conjugate in Pin(Q).
Proof. By Proposition (10.2 .2), every m.t.i.s. contains r vectors Yl, Y2, . .. ,Yr to which
vectors (Xl, X2, . .. , x r ) can be added in order to obtain a 'real' Witt basis {Xi , Yj} j
therefore an element of O(Q) mapping one such basis to another one can always be
round.
•
In what follows, we will assume that the isotropic r-vector f = Y1Y2 . .. Yr is built
from vectors belonging to such a 'real' Witt basis .
Proposition 11.1.1 In the elliptic case, Q can be identified with the special unitary
group SU(r, C). Q is the set of elements with determinant 1 in the stabilizer of a
m.i.i.s. The dimension of Q is r 2 -

N("() = 1 and 111-1 = f . If Yj' = 1yn-1, Yi' = A{'Yj, Xj = (iej + en_j+l)/2 implies
xi' = 1Xj1-1 and Xi' = A{,xj.
The Witt basis {Xi,Yj} is mapped to the Witt basis {Xi',yP} and
E A{,At, = bi'k'.

Considering f as a r-vector in N(F') leads to det(p("()) = 1.
The other results are either obvious or have already been proved.

that of Proposition (11.1.2).

Definition 11.1.2 He is the subgroup of, E Spin(Q ) such that

Xexp(iB) being an arbitrary element of C'. p(He) = ge is called an enlarged spino-
riality group.
ge is the stabilizer of an m.t.i.s. under the action of SO(Q).
In the elliptic case, the proof of Proposition (11.1.1) shows that X = 1 so that
p(He ) = ge must be isomorphic to U(r, C).
In the general case, X may differ from 1. These groups are of dimension r 2 +
p(p - 1)/2 when 0 ~ p ~ r .
If p f. 0 the enlarged spinoriality group is not isomorphic to a generalized unitary
group (their dimensions differ).
ge is connected if p = 0 and has two connected components if 0 < p ~ r .
9 is an invariant subgroup of ge if both groups are associated to the same isotropic
r-vector.

Let us consider in SO(Q') the subgroup 9'
of the st abilizer of an m.t.i.s. whose elements have determinant equal to ±1. Since,

by Chapter 10,3.1, ,f = ±/1,f, fl E C' if and only if ,f,-l = Nh)fl2f, an element
of 9' must be of the form
where
{
A E GL(C,r),
detA = ±1,
ATB = Id,
BTC+CTB=O,
so it is the product of a change of Witt bases for F EB F' :
where det(a) = ±1 and aT j3 = Id, and a matrix of the form
m=(~
~)
where 0 is an antisymmetric complex matrix, m E p(exp( A2(F'))) . Conversely, every
element of p(exp( A2(F'))) is of the form given for m (d. Chapter 8,1.2).
The definition of the group H' in Spin(Q') such that
p(H') = 9'
is obvious.
Similarly we can define groups H~ and 9~ , analogous to the He and ge in Definition
(11.1.2) .
More results concerning the structure of spinoriality groups can be found in the
thesis of J. Timbeau, (Toulouse, 1985).

COVERINGS OF THE COMPLETE CONFORMAL
GROUP-TWISTORS.
12.1
The complete conformal group.
E is a real n-dimensional vector space with a non-degenerate quadratic form of
signature (p, q) (p positive and q negative terms). B is the associated symmetric
bilinear form, it satisfies B(x,x) = Q(x) .
Let us consider the set of continuously differentiable homeomorphisms f from an
open set 0 of E to some other open set in E, such that if x EO, and if jx is the
tangent linear transformation in x, there exists a continuous function). which has
no zeroes and such that :
BUx(u),j,,(v)) = ).2(x)B(u,v),
Vu,v E E.
(1)
This set forms a pseudo-group of transformations called (abusively) the conformal
group of (E,Q) and denoted by Cn(p,q).
By a theorem of Liouville (which we accept without proof), when n 2: 3, every
element of Cn(p,q) is a product (in arbitrary order) of a number of translations,
isometries, homotheties and inversions. Only the inversions can cause some problems
for their domain of definition. One can easily verify that all these transformations
have the property expressed by (1).
If we include the inversions, we will speak of the 'complete' conformal group; if we
do not include them, a subgroup called the 'restricted' conformal group is obtained;
its elements are defined in all points of E.
The notations of the previous chapters are still used : E is also written E(p, q)
and has an orthonormal basis of the form
(ei? = 1,
i = 1,2, . . . ,p,

basis

The Clifford algebras of E(p,q) and E(p + l,q + 1) are denoted by Cl(p,q) and

will be written G(p,q), G(p + 1,q + 1), Spin(p, q) etc.

Coverings of the complete conformal group.
12.2.1
Lemma 12.2.1 There exists an injective mapping u from E(p, q) to the isotropic
cone C of E(p + 1, q + 1), defined by:
u(x) = Hen+l + eo)x2 + x + ~(en+l - eo),
x E E(p,q).
(1)
It is easily verified that u(x) = u(x') implies x = x' and that (u(x))2
0 in
Cl(p+l ,q+l).
The isotropic transformation (1) can also be written as :
u(x) = xox2 + X - Yo,
(2)
xo, Yo belonging to a special Witt basis of E(p + 1, q + 1).
Note that the vector u(x) can have any isotropic direction except that of Xo
(unless we would assign this direction as the limit for x 2 tending to infinity). Indeed ,
every isotropic vector of E(p + 1, q + 1) is of the form
and has the same direction as u(x) if we choose

elements of E(p + 1, q + 1). The proof consists of two steps :

that every element of Cn(p,q) can be reached by a product of a finite number of
suitably chosen v .

Proposition 12.2.3 The kernel of 'I/; : Pin(p + 1, q + 1) -+ Cn(p, q) is

Proof. If 9 E ker'l/;, a(g)u(x)g-l = ug(x)u(x) for all z E E(p,q).
By the remark

hence p(g) = ± IdE or
a(g)yg-l = ±y,
Vy E E(p + 1,q + 1)

leads to the four possible values for g.
We still have to prove the
Lemma 12.2.2 If (E ,Q) has isotropic elements and if U E O(Q) fixes all isotropic
lines, U = ± IdE (dimE = n ~ 3).
Proof. E contains a hyperbolic pair (x,y) and (x,y).1 is non-isotropic.
Let z E
(x,y).1.
If Q(z) = 0, u(z) = cz by assumption; if Q(z) f:. 0, (x,y,z) is a Witt
decomposition of the space E 3 generated by z , y, z and (z) is the only line in E3
which is orthogonal to (x,y). It is sufficient to prove that U maps E3 to itself, then
u(z) = cz follows since, by assumption, u( x) = ax and u(y) = by. But
u = x -
~Q(z)y + z
is isotropic,
u(u) = du = dx -
~Q(z)dy + dz = ax -
~bQ(z)y + u(z)
hence u(z) E E3 , a = b= c = d, every vector in (x,y) and in (x,y).1 is multiplied by
a, u(X) = aX, VX E E and the lemma follows from Proposition (1.2.6).

Ifv = aeO+ben+l +w, N(v) = I; = ±1, wE E(p,q), it follows from formula (6) that
'1/;(v) is the symmetry relative to (w).1 if a = b = 0 and (4) leads to uv ( x) = 1, hence

12.2.3
The connectedness of the conformal group.
Let
C~(p, q) denote the connected component of the identity in the conformal group
Cn(p,q). If an element of Pin(p + 1,q + 1) is mapped by 'l/J into C~(p,q) the same
holds for all other elements in its connected component. Conversely every element
of C~(p, q) has a pre-image under 'l/J in one of the connected components of ker'l/J, 'l/J
being a covering. Hence the set of connected components of ker'l/J in Pin(p + 1, q + 1)
is the pre-image of C~(p, q).
Let Go(P+ 1, q+1) (or Go for short) be the subgroup of elements in Pin(p+1, q+1)
of spin norm 1 and let Gt = Go n Spin(p + 1, q + 1). By Chapter 6, section 2, Gt
is a connected subgroup of index 2 in Spin(p + 1,q + 1).
But Pin(p + 1,q + 1)
has four connected components (as was proved in Chapter 6, 2), these being Gt,
Spin(p + 1, q + 1) \ Gt and the components obtained from these two by the action
of a non-isotropic vector of spin norm 1.
Note that by a classical result :

Twistors.
12.3.1
155
Definition 12.3.1 Every irreducible representation space for a Clifford algebra be-
ing called a spinor space, we will call twistor space all direct sums of spinor spaces.
If the spinor space is a minimal left ideal, the twistor space will be a left ideal of
the Clifford algebra under consideration.
In the following, we will only consider the direct sums of two spinor spaces and
the term 'twistors' will only be used in this sense.
Essentially, we will only use real even-dimensional vector spaces E(p, q) where
p + q = n = 2r, and the notations of Chapter 10, 2.
The complexified Clifford
algebra and, more generally, all complexified spaces will be den oted with primes.
Let I and 11 be two isotropic r-vectors such that the sum
Cl'(p, q)1 EB Cl'(p, q)h
is direct and defines a twistor space.
Proposition 12.3.1 There exists a representation of Cl'(p + 1, q + 1) in
Cl'(p, q)1 <B CI'(p, q)/l
for wh ich Cl'(p, q)1 and CI'(p,q)h are isomorphic to the spaces of even, resp. odd
spinors ofCl'(p+ l,q + 1).
Proof. Recall that
Cl(p + 1, q + 1) = Cl(p, q) 0 Cl(l, 1).
Let {Xi, Yi} be a special Witt basis of E'(p + 1, q+1) and {x ,y} a special Witt basis
of E'(l, 1), then
is a special Witt basis of E'(p + 1, q + 1) and a ,
E Pin(Q') can be found such that
Xi' = ,Xi/-I, Yi' = ,Yi/-1 if {XiI , Yi /} is another special Witt basis. Set <I> = 10 Y =
IY, then Cl'(p + 1, q + 1)<I> is a spinor space for Cl'(p + 1,q + 1). Let I = Y1Y2 · · · YTl
h = ,1,-1 = y~y~ .. . y; with I and 11 not collinear, and assume for instance that,
is odd.
A linear isomorphism i from Cl'(p, q)1 0 Cl'(», q)h to Cl'(p + 1, q+ 1) is defined
by associating
if h is even,
if h is odd,
if h is even,
if h is odd.

156
CHAPTER 12
The representation p of CI'(p+ 1, q+ 1) in the sum of the spaces is then pw = i-1owoi
(w being the left product by w in CI'(p + 1, q + 1)<I» . The parity conditions can be
verified if w is even.
•
Hence a twistor space for CI(p, q) (or CI'(p, q)) is isomorphic to a spinor space for
CI(p + 1, q + 1) (or CI'(p + 1, q + 1)).
The four-fold covering of the conformal group Cn(p, q) by Pin(p + 1, q + 1) is
called the 'twistor' covering because of this property of CI(p + 1, q + 1).
Remark.
When p + q is even, the four-fold covering of C~(p, q) is either Spin(p +
l,q + 1) or Gri(p + 1,q + 1) by section 2.3. Spin(p + l,q + 1) acts on the space
CI'+(p+ 1, q+ 1)<I> of serni-spinors isomorphic to CI'(p, q)f, which becomes the 'twistor
representation space' for CI'(p, q). This leads some authors to (wrongly) consider
CI'(p, q)f as the twistor space for CI'(p, q); the correct choice for this space is, by
Proposition (12.3.1), CI'(p, q)f ffi CI'(p, q)ft.
12.3.2
Neutral spin groups and unitary groups.
In Chapter 10 a hermitian form 1-l was defined on the spinor space C(Q')f, satisfying
f3(uf)vf = a1-l(uf, vfhf,
a being 1 or i and f = , f,-1 defining the conjugation pure spinor ,f.
If the quadratic form Q is not positive definite, 1-l is neutral; this will therefore
always be the case for the spinor space of CI'(p + 1, q + 1).
Proposition 12.3.2 If p + q = 2r, r
~ 2, the connected component of Spin(p +
1,q + 1) is a subgroup ofSU(r,r).
Proof. If 9 belongs to the connected component in Spin(p + 1, q + 1), 13(9)9 = 1 so
that the natural action of this component on CI'(p + 1, q + 1)<I> by left multiplication
is an isometry for H,
The connected component of Spin(p + 1, q + 1) is generated by that of Spin(p, q)

Lemma 12.3.1 If x is a non-isotropic element of the n -dimensional vector space
E(p,q) and if Ox : y --+ xy , then det(Ox) = (x)2ft .
Proof. Let x be the element (e.) of an orthogonal basis : (ei)2 = O:i and order the
elements of a basis ei1 ei, . .. eik of C(Q) lexicographically :
followed by the ei,i, ...ik with i 1 > 1.
Oel is bijective and sends the 2n- 1 elements starting with e1 to the 2n- 1 other
elements of the basis (up to the coefficient 0:1)'
f el being the sign of the permutation
it is readily seen that

•
The result concerning the determinant of Og follows immediately from the factor-
ization of 9 E Spin(p + 1, q + 1) as a product of non-isotropic vectors.
In the special case under consideration, N(g) = 1 and det Og = 1 so that 9 defines
a special unitary transformation on a space with neutral metric.
The dimension of Spin(p + 1, q + 1) is (r + 1)(2r + 1), hence if r ~ 2,
(r + 1)(2r + 1) ::; (2r? - 1
and the connected component of Spin(p + 1, q + 1) can be considered as a subgroup
of SU(r,r).
•
Corollary 12.3.1 The connected component of the identity in Spin(2,4) is isomor-
phic to SU(2, 2).
Proof. r = 2, p = 1 and (r + 1)(2r + 1) = (2r)2 -1 = 15, and SU(2, 2) is connected.
This corollary explains the importance of the group SU(2, 2) in 'twistor' minkow-
skian geometry.

Linear and affine description of the properties of the spinors in a
Minkowski space E.
Here r = 2, p = 1 and q = 3.
Using the notations of Chapter 10, h = r -
p = 1 and e' = -1 so that the
conjugation C defined by C(uf) = u,f satisfies C2 = - Id and the quaternionic case
applies. We may choose ,f = xd = ied ·
The space S- of odd spinors is (xIi, xd) = (p,a) and, applying C, a basis
(I, xIxd) for the space S+ of even spinors is obtained.
We will write (uf)' = C(uf).
Using the notations of Chapter 8, 3.1, we set
7jJ(uf 0 vf) = uf{3(v),
7jJ being the classical isomorphism from S x S to C(Q') . If we set! X = (1 + {3) 0 1/;,
it is easy to verify :
1
x(p 0P')=XI,
x(a 0 pO) =
X2 ,
x(a 0 a') = YI ,
X(p 0 a') = -Y2,
(1)
and X is a linear isomorphism from S- 0 S+ to E', equivariant under the action of
Gt·
Consider uf 0 vf, or explicitly, (ap + ba) 0 (-a'a' + b'p'), then
(2)
and X(uf 0 v f) is readily seen to be isotropic when uf E S- and v f E S+.
This isotropic vector is real if and only if
which holds in particular if b = -a' and a = 1/ so that :
x(uf 0 (uf)'),
uf E S-
is a real isotropic vector.
Similar facts apply to
x(uf 0 (vf)') +x(vf 0 (uf)') ,
uf,vf E S-
being real; it is the image under X of
(u +v)f 0 ((u +v)f)' - uf 0 (uf)' - vf 0 (vf)' .

Anticipating the results of Chapter 13, X can be related to the generalized
triality principle.
f
0 xd is obtained from B(xf,xtf) = A(J 0 xtf,x) = B(J 0 xd,x) for all
x E E' = ECi taking x equal to Xl, YI, Y2 successively, f 0 xlf is seen to be collinear
with Y2.
For X = X2 we get
(4)
or
a" 0 p = 2Y2,
or
a" o a = -2YI,
p·op= -2XI'
p" 0 a = -2X2'
Hence the isomorphism X is, up to a constant factor, the generalized triality
principle in Minkowski space.
In what follows , many properties could be proved for the general case of a com-
plexified four-dimensional real space with arbitrary metric. We will, however, restrict
ourselves to the spaces of initial signature (1,3), i.e., the quaternionic case.
Proposition 12.3.3 Every minkowskian semi-spinor is a pure spin or, and con-
versely.
The converse was proved in Chapter 8.
Proof. If F is the plane (XI,X2)' F' the plane (YI,Y2), E' = F ffiF', by Proposition
(8.1.4), uf is a pure spinor if and only if u is of the form

of two semi-spinors, a pair of totally isotropic planes of different parity can be as-
sociated. These planes intersect along an isotropic line D (d. Proposition (8.1.2)).
Hence : to every non-zero spinor without parity, an isotropic line of the vector space
E can be associated. (This is called 'construction (A)'.)
Proposition 12.3.5 The isotropic line associated to (u+f ,(u+f).) is real.
Proof. By Lemma (8.1.3), the points x of the plane associated to u+f are charac-
terized by x(u+ f) = O. u+ f and (u+f). correspond to planes intersecting along the
line 6., and a point z E 6. is characterized by
or xii+,f = O. A point y E ~ is characterized by
yu+f =O ,
yu+,f =O
or yii+,t-r: = 0 and yu+lCnf,-l = 0, but i,f = f'f leads to
hence 6. = S.
•
Proposition 12.3.6 The line D associated to uf = u +f +u- f by construction (A )
can be identified with the line determined by X(u+f Q9 u - f) .
Proof. If u: f = (ax1 + bX2)f, u+ f = (a' + b'X1X2)f,
x = x(u+ f Q9 u- f) = ab'x1 + bb'X2 - a'bY1 + aa'Y2;
it is immediately verified that
So, given uf = u+f + u- f up to a scalar factor (such an object will be called a
projective spinor), two real isotropic lines can be associated to it , determined by
Using the above formula for x'»! Q9 vf), the necessary and sufficient condition for
these lines to coincide is

(which implies that 1-l(uf,uj) = 0).
Now it is possible to associate to every spinor a pair of affine lines, one of them
containing X(u- f .:9 (u- j).) and parallel to X(u+ f .:9 (u +j).), the other one defined
by the same conditions with both vectors exchanged. We have already noted the
possibility to associate an isotropic line through the origin in the affine space E' to
every pair of semi-spinors, i.e. a homogeneous isotropic line to every spinor.
Proposition 12.3.7 Construction (A) establishes a bijection between the set of
pairs of projective pure spinors of different parity and the set of homogeneous iso-
tropic lines in E'.
Proof. This follows at once from Corollary (8.1.4) (each (r - i)-dimensional totally
isotropic subspace of E' is contained in exactly one even m.t.i.s. and exactly one odd
m.t.i.s.)
A direct proof could be given here, using Proposition (12.3.6) and formula (2); it
is sufficient to compute a,b,a',b' associated with a vector
where Ct"{ = (36.
I
Every vector in E' being the sum of two isotropic vectors, every vector in E' can
be obtained as the image under X of a sum uf .:9 v f + u' f .:9 v'f involving only two
terms.
Construction (B). To generalize construction (A), we determine the set of x E E'
such that:

where A,>.' are non-zero fixed scalars. Note that
so that x 2 = >.>.' = k, a constant, and (5) is equivalent to
If we set x = xo+ x', Xo being a particular solution of x( u+ j) = >.(u- j) (if such Xo
exists), we see that x'(u+ j) = o. x' is a general element of a totally isotropic plane.
The first condition in (5) means that x lies in a totally isotropic affine plane and the
second condition has a similar meaning. Hence, once an Xo has been found, satisfying
(5), the solution set of (5) is an affine isotropic line 6.. But from the equivalent
formulation, it follows that 6. is the intersection of a m.t.i.s. and a quadric x 2 = kj
such an intersection must contain the line at infinity of the m.t.i.s. and another line

direction of 6. determines a homogeneous line 6.0 and therefore the pair (u+I, u-1),

ni« f,u+ J) = H(ul" f,ut J) = H(u- f ,utJ) = H(u+ j,«; J) = 0
(9)
Conversely, the explicit form of these conditions implies
aa' + bb = aa~ + bb~ = ala' + blb' = ala~ + blb~ = 0,
ala, = b/bl and
a'/a~ =
b'/b~, meaning that the homogeneous lines of directions 6.
and 6.1 coincide. Hence (9) expresses that 6. and 6.1 have the same direction .

164
CHAPTER 12
We shall henceforth assume that 6. and 6.1 have different directions. If there
exists an x E 6. n 6.1, computing H(uj,ud) and applying (7) , (8), immediately
leads to
H(u+I, u}I) = ).).-lH(u - I, uiI),
H(u-I, uiI) = ).').'-lH(u+I, u} I),
(10)
(11)
).).1 being non-zero and real.
Conversely, both lines having different directions, the left-hand sides of (10) and
(11) cannot both vanish; if H(u+I, u}I) :f:. 0, if x(u+I) = ).(u:I) and if x(u} I) =
N(utJ), (x being real, take the intersection of 6. and the plane x(ulI) = ).I(ut I),
this point generally exists), then (10) implies that x 2 = ).).1, so x E 6. n 6.1 . Hence
(10) and (11) express that the real lines 6. and 6.1 intersect either in a finite point
or 'at infinity'.
For special )., ).', a suggestive condition is obtained : if ). is pure imaginary (and
therefore N too),
and 6. and 6.1 intersect in a finite point or at infinity if and only if their representing
spinors are orthogonal under H .
Finally, note that if ).N = 0 and only one of the factors vanishes, the same
conclusions hold, although the proofs will not .
In fact, one can use the continuity for ).I = e, € --> 0, condition (10) remains.

E. Cartan's triality principle.
13.1.1
E is an eight-dimensional vector space over a field K of characteristic zero (usually,
K = R or C) with a non-degenerate quadratic form of maximal index 4. The Witt
bases and the spinor spaces are those defined in the previous chapters.
A Go-invariant bilinear form B is defined by
f3(uJ)vj = B(uj,vJ)j,
(1)
B is non-degenerate and, since 2r = 8, r = 4, B is symmetric, zero on S+ X S- (d.
Chapter 8, 2) and we recall that :
B(guj,gvJ) = N(g)B(uj,vJ),

(4)
A(x +uf, x' +u'f) = B(x, x') + l3(uf, u'f),
z , x' E E,

A is non-degenerate and the subspaces E, S+ and S- are non-isotropic for A; the
orthogonal complement of any of these spaces is clearly the sum of the two others.
A cubic form Fo on A is defined by :
Fo(x+uf+u'f) =l3(xuf,u'f) =l3(uf,xu'f),

Through 'polarization' a symmetric trilinear form cI>o on A x A x A is deduced :
cI>o(, 7],0 = Fo( +7] +0 +Fo() +FO(7] )+Fo(O - Fo( +7]) - Fo( +0 - FO(7] +0,
(,7],(EA.
Proposition 13.1.1 There exists a commutative, non-associative algebra structure
on A = E x S such that :
( 0 7] = 7] 0 ( = w E A,
V(, 7] E A,
where A(w, 0 = cI>o(, 7], 0, V( E A.
(5)
Proof The commutativity follows from the symmetry of cI>o and the existence from
the non-degeneracy of A.

Proposition 13 .1.2 (07] = 0 if ( and 7] each belong to exactly one of the subspaces

cI>o(, 7], 0 = Fo( + 7] + 0

Proof. If ~ E E and TJ E S+, lllo(L TJ, () is zero when ( E E + S+, so ~ a TJ belongs
to the orthogonal space of E + S+, relative to A, i.e. S -. The other inclusions have
similar proofs.
I
Proposition 13.1.4 For all x E E and uf E S :
x a uf = xuf,
"y(x a uJ) = Q(x)"Y(uJ),
x a (x a uJ) = Q(x)uf.
(7)
Proof. The first formula need only be proved for uf E S+ (or uf E S-). It is an
immediate consequence of the definition and of the properties of B. For example, if
x auf E S-, u'f E S-,
B(x auf,u'J) = A(x a uf,u'J) = lllo(x,uf,u'J) = Fo(x +uf + u'J) = B(xuf,u'J)
and x a uf = xuf since B is non-degenerate on S- x S-. The other formulas are
obvious.
I
There exists a natural representation J-L of the Clifford group G in A, if w

J-L(g)(w) = gxg- 1 + g(uf + u'J),
and we have:

gufagvf = N(g)g(uf a VJ)g-l,

J-L(g) is an automorphism of A jf9 EGo.
Proof. These results all follow from routine computations.

Remark.
In general, every automorphism of the vector space A for which A and
Fo are invariant gives rise to an algebra automorphism of A. This is the case for the
action of elements in the group Go and (9) expresses this result.
Note that the spaces E, S+ and S- are all of the same dimension 8 and that this
follows from the choice of r = 4 (we need 2r - 1 = 2r) . An important result holds in
this case:
The triality principle.
There exists an automorphism .J of the vector space
A = E x S = E EEl S+ EEl S- such that .J3 = Id . Both the bilinear form A and the
cubic form Fo are invariant under .J. Furthermore,.J maps E to S+, S+ to S- and
S- to E.
A complete proof can be found in Chevalley's book; we will only indicate its main
points.

CHAPTER 13
Choose Xl E E such that Q(Xl) = 1, Xl EGo.
Choose uti E S+ such that -y(uti) = l.
If X E E we set r( x) = uti 0 X = xuti E S- . r is an isomorphism from E to S- .
If u'f E S- we set r( u' f) = X E E. r is thereby defined on E EB S-.
If u] E S+, we set
r(uf) = B(uf, uti)uti - uf E S+,
r is an automorphism of S+. Finally we define .J = J.L(xl)r.
Then the Cayley numbers or octonions can be constructed if we choose Xl and
uti as before, ui =
Xl 0 uti = XlUti . If X, y E E, xuif E S+, yuti E S- and
xuif 0 yuti E E , we define
X* y =
(xu~f) 0 (yuti)
and prove that if K = R the octonion algebra is obtained. This non-associative
algebra can be constructed more directly as follows : consider the set E = H X H
where H is the usual skewfield of Hamilton's quaternions. E is an eight-dimensional
vector space over R .
If X = (a, b) and X' = (a', b'), we define
x+x'=(a+a',b+b'),
ax = (aa ,ab) ,
aER
and if a denotes the conjugate of a E H,
xx' = (aa' - b'b, b'a+ ba')
defines a multiplication which satisfies the bilinearity conditions for algebras; the
pair (1,0) is its neutral element.
Setting x = (a, -b) and xx = Ix1 2 ,
xx = (aa+ bb,O)
so that Ixl 2 = (a2,0), a E Rand [e] =°is equivalent to x = (0,0) . If x -# 0, x/lxl2
is the inverse of x.
A direct computation shows that Ixyl = Ixllyl and that xy = 0 implies that X = 0
or y = O.
13.2
The generalized triality principle.
13.2.1
Now E is a vector space of even! dimension n = 2r over the field K (K = R or C),
with a non-degenerate quadratic form Q of maximal index r . Using the previous
notations,
S+ = C+(Q)f,
S- = C-(Q)f.
IThese results can be adapted to hold in the odd-dimensional case as well.

THE TRIALITY PRINCIPLE.
169
On S x S a bilinear form B can be defined as in Chapter 8, 2 (or as in the previous
section when r = 4) using the anti-automorphism (3; its composition ~ = (3 0 a with
the main automorphism gives rise to another bilinear form, E. B is invariant under
Go, 13 is invariant under Gt (d. Chapter 8, 2).
Band 13 are non-degenerate and either symmetric or antisymmetric.
B(uf,vJ) = (_ly(r-l)/2B(vf,uJ) ,
E(uf,vJ) = (-ly(r+l)/2E(vf,uJ) .
If r = 2,3 (mod 4), B is antisymmetric.
If r = 0,1 (mod 4), B is symmetric.
Ifr = 1,2(mod4), 13 is antisymmetric.
If r = 0,3 (mod 4), 13 is symmetric.
B vanishes on S+ x S- and S- x S+ if r is even, it vanishes on S+ x S+ and
S- x S- if r is odd.
13 coincides with B on S+ x S and with -B on S- x S.
These facts lead us to consider different cases.
In the following, F will be a
vector subspace of C( Q) on which O(Q) can act naturally, F is given a quadratic
form extending Q : if, for instance, F is the Lie algebra of a spin group, the Killing
form can be chosen. The intersections F n C±(Q) will be written F±.
13.2.2
The generalized triality principle or interaction principle. (n = 2r,
r = 1,2,3(mod4).)
If r = 2,3 (mod 4), B is antisymmetric.
A = F x S = F EI7 S is given a bilinear form A :
A(x + uf,x' + u'J) = B(x,x') + B(uf,u'J),
x,x' E F,
uf,u'f E S,
(1)
where B stands for the extension to F of the symmetric bilinear form associated to
Q. A is non-degenerate.
Using obvious notations, we define :
(2)
x E F+ if r is odd, x E F- if r is even . Next we define for ~,TI, ( a trilinear form q,o
as in section 1.
If r = 1,2 (mod 4), 13 is antisymmetric.
Similar definitions are used for A, Po and ~o .
Now we are in an analogous situation to that leading to Propositions (13.1.1),
(13.1.2) and (13.1.3) . The results are summarized in the:
Proposition 13.2.1
1. Ifr is even, defining A = F- EI7 S, there exists a non-associative commutative

CHAPTER 13
algebra structure over A such that
eo TJ = TJ 0 e= w E A, vt, TJ E A,
where A(w , () = <po(e,TJ ,0,
V( E A. eo TJ = 0 ifeand TJ each belong to one
of the subspaces F -, S+ and S- .
F- 0 S+ ~ S-,
S+ 0 S- ~ F- ,
S- 0 F- ~ S+.
2. If r is odd, defining A = F+ EB S, analogous results hold, but
F+ 0 S+ ~ S+,
S+ 0 S- ~ F +,
S - 0 F+ ~ S- .
A similar proposition holds for A and <i>o.
(3)
(4)
Since we can no longer consider the automorphism :J or call this 'E. Cartan's
triality principle', these results are called a generalized triality principle or, relying
on the inclusions in (3) and (4), an interaction principle.
It can be ver ified at once that x 0 uf = xu] and guf 0 gv f = N(g )g(uf 0 V /)g-l,
9 E G+.
The remark following Proposition (13.1.5) still holds.
The case where Band i3 are symmetric could also be considered; but the anti-
symmetric case will prove useful and essential in the sequel.
13.2.3
Orthosymplectic graded Lie algebras.
V is a (Z2)-graded vector space if it is the direct sum of two subspaces Va and VI,
where va is called the even component and VI the odd component.
An element of Vi is said to be of degree i, and the degree of v will be written Ivl. Of
course, the degree is only defined for homogeneous elements, i.e. those belonging to
Va or Vi .
A Lie algebra V is said to be graded if V = Va EB VI and
[a,b] = -( _l)lallbl[b,a],
L (_l)lallcl[a, [b, c]] = 0
(cycl.)
where the second requirement is called the 'graded Jacobi identity'. The set End(V)
of endomorphisms of V is a graded Lie algebra with
[a, b] = ab - (_l)lallblba
Endo(V) sends Vi to Vi, i = 0,1, whereas End1(V) sends Va to VI and VI to Va .

THE TRIALITY PRINCIPLE.
171
Definition 13.2.1 Let V be a graded vector space and h a non-degenerate bilinear
form on V x V such that hlvoxvo is antisymmetric, hlvlXVl is symmetric and hlvoXVl =
hlvl XVO= 0;
90 = {a E Endo(V)lh(ax, y) + h(x,ay) = 0, \Ix , y E V;}
(5)
91 = {a E End 1(V)lh(ax, y) = h(x, ay), \Ix E VI, \ly E Vol
(6)
90 EEl 91 is called an orthosympJectic graded Lie algebra.
We will use the notation 90 EEl 91 = Osp(VO, ~) .
The verification of this definition may be carried out by the reader.
13.2.4
The interaction algebra and the construction of some orthosym-
plectic graded Lie algebras.
Considering the situation of section 1.2, if r =I 0 (mod 4), a non-degenerate antisym-
metric bilinear form invariant under the action of Gci on the spinor space is given
by B or B, so that S is a symplectic space.
Using the notations of the previous subsection, set
Vo = S,
v, = {F+
if r is odd,
1
F-
if r is even ,
and take A or A for h. Gci acts on F± by an isometric extension of its action on E
and by left multiplication on S as a symplectic transformation .
We define
{
uf a vf,
if uf and vf have different parity,
uf(v f) =
0,
if uf and v f have the same parity,
(7)
uf(x) = xuf,
x E F±.
Now we can verify that
A(uf(x),u'f) = A(x,uf(u'f)),
which is condition (6), since for uf and u'f of different parity, it is equivalent to
(assuming uf E S+, u'f E S-) :
The graded Lie algebra generated by the (odd) elements of S and by the (even) en-
domorphisms obtained from the representation of the Lie algebra of Gci (or Spin(Q))
in F± and S is an orthosymplectic algebra which we will denote by 90 EEl 91.

172
CHAPTER 13
The graded brackets corresponding to odd elements will be written using {-, '},
the other ones using [', -].
{uj, vf}(wf) = uf 0 (vf 0 wf) + vf 0 (uf 0 wf) E S
{uj,vf}(x) =xufovf+xvfouf E P±,
x E P±.
{uf,vf} acts in S as an element of the Lie algebra of the symplectic group of Sand
in p± as an element of the Lie algebra of the orthogonal group.
For 9 E Gt we obtained :
guf 0 gvf = g(uf 0 vf)g-l,
(8)
from which, taking a derivative along a path starting at the identity in Gt and
tangent to a E L:(Spin(Q)), we get
auf 0 vf + uf 0 avf = a(uf 0 vf) - (uf 0 vf)a.
(9)
But (8) still holds for 9 in the group of transformations preserving A and Po, so
that (9) still holds for any even element a of the orthosymplectic graded Lie algebra
go EI7 gl just defined .
Let a be an even element of go EI7 gl .
a(x) = ax - xa,
x E P±,
a(vf) = avf,
vf E S,
[uf,a](x) = (ax - xa)uf - axuf = <xau],
[uf,a](x) = -(auf)(x)
[uf, a](vf)
uf 0 avf - a(uf 0 vf)
= u] 0 avf - a(uf 0 vf) + (uf 0 vf)a,
applying (9) gives:
[uf, a](vf) = -(auf)(vf)
and from (10) and (11) we get :
[uf, a] = -auf.
(10)
(11 )
(12)
Remark. If a E P± , {uf, v f}( a) = auf 0 v f +av f 0 uf and if a is an even element
of go EI7 gl ,
{uj, vf}(a) = a(uf 0 vf) - (uf 0 vf)a.
Similarly, if {uf,vf} is also an element of P±, (12) yields
[uf, {uj,vf}] = -{uj, vf}(uf),
(13)

THE TRIALITY PRINCIPLE.
and the graded Jacobi identity
:E [uf, {vf,wf}] = 0
(eycl .)
becomes
:E vfo(wfouf)+wfo(vfouf)=O
(eye!.)
or
:E (ufowf)ovf = 0
(eye!.)
if {uf, V f} is an element of p± for any choice of uf, vf. This also means that
{uf, vfHwf) = -(uf 0 vf)(wf).
173
(14)
(15)
Relying on (13) and (15), {uf, vf} can be identified with the natural action of
-(uf 0 vf).
Note that {uf,vf} being an infinitesimal symplectic mapping in the space S,
given the bilinear form B (for instance), it can be identified with an element z E C(Q)
by the classical isomorphism between C(Q) and the endomorphism space of S. This
element z satisfies f3(z) + z = 0 in order to satisfy (5); if z is decomposed in terms of
homogeneous components relative to the products of orthonormal basis vectors e., z
only contains terms of degree 2,3 (mod 4).
If, for example, r = 3 and if we choose F+ = /\2(E) + /\6(E), {uf,vf} can
always be identified with an even z and {uf,vf} can be identified with -(uf 0 vf)
as indicated above.
13.2.5
An example of an orthosymplectic graded Lie algebra.
The algebra which we are about to construct will be called complex conformosym-
plectic minkowskian.
The Minkowski space E is given an orthonormal basis el, e2, e3, e4 with (ed2 = 1,
(e2)2 = (e3)2 = (e4? = -1. A two-dimensional space Eo with orthonormal basis
{eo,es} satisfying (eo? = 1, (es)2 = -1 will be added to it . Its complexification
yields a six-dimensional space (EL QD with Clifford algebra C(Q~) . The following
special Witt basis is chosen on E~ :
eo+ es
Xo = --2-
eo - es
Yo = --2-
el + e4
Xl = --2-

Yl = ---

(corresponding to the translations),
(corresponding to the special conformal transformations).
We will set S = C(QDf, f = YOYIY2 ·
Since T = 3, we choose P+ = 1\2(E D EEl C eN where eN = eOele2e3e4eS, and the
form Bon S.
Let B1 be the natural extension of the quadratic form of E~ to P+. We choose
the (9ij) being the coefficients of the 'metric' on

To compute f
0 xof, we consider
B(zf,xoJ) = B1U 0 xof,z),
Vz E P+
yielding f
0 xof = 2YIY2. The other computations are similar.
A suitable choice of BI(eN , eN) gives the following table for the 'anti-brackets'

The reader may also consider the action of eN and the brackets of even elements.
The real case.
Let H be a hermitian sesquilinear form on the spinor space C( Q~)J
(J = YOYIY2) such that :
{J(uJ)f = u;'H(uf,vfhf.
In this signature and dimension,
E = E' = -1 and 1f = -ixd = ed is a possible
choice.
The charge conjugation C satisfies C2 = - Id .
C(J) = - ixd,
C(xlxd) = ixd,
C(xoxd) = -iXOXIXd,
c(xoxd) = ixof.
Note that C changes the parity.
Definition 13.2.2 A spin or uf = u+f + u- f is said to satisfy a Majorana type
condition if :
C(u+J)=u-f
or, equivalently, C(u- J)
-(u+J). A spin basis {Xi, Xi 2
• • • XiJ} is said to be of
Majorana type2 if the conjugates of the even elements in the basis coincide with its
odd elements.
In such a basis, a 'Maj orana spinor' has odd components given by the complex
conjugates of its even components.
If uf satisfies the conditions of the definition, so does auf if a is even and real,
and gufg-l if 9 E Pin(Q).
The Majorana type properties are preserved by these natural real transforma-
tions.
From a 'Majorana type' basis, another basis can be deduced, in which the com-
ponents of these spinors are real. For instance, the following basis :

when uf and v f are of the same parity and a belongs to £( 0(2,4)), to Ri or equals

In the real case a generalized triality principle is constructed with a instead of

u( zuf, vf) = B1(z, uf 0 vf)
z 0 uf = zuf,
uf,vf E S of the same parity, z E F+ and the other compositions are S+ 0 S- = 0,
F+ 0 F+ = o.
We choose F+ = £(0(2,4)) EEl ReN in order to identify {uf, vI} and -(uf 0 vf).

The ordinary brackets and the brackets similar to (17) should be added to this table;
together, they define a real minkowskian orthosymplectic graded Lie algebra.
13.2.7
The relationship with the Wess-Zumino heuristic formalism and
the work of other authors.
In a large number of publications from 1970 on, many authors have introduced graded
Lie algebra tables, generally without any logical justification. Using their notation,
this is the table of Wess-Zumino :
[Pm, Pn] = 0,
[Pm, Qa] = [Pm, Qa] = 0,
{Qa,QI3} = 2a:13Pm,
{Qa , Qt3} = {Qa, QI3} = o.
(22)
Pm is a translation operator in Minkowski space, the Qa define the spinors and
the Qa the conjugate spinors. In terms of coordinates, the space is described by xm ,
8a and Ba, where the coordinates with latin indices commute whereas those with
greek indices anticommute ('graded analysis') . Then one defines:
D

From table (16) in section 5, we can extract :

-2Y1YO,
2XIYO,
2X2YO
(24)
(and a second isomorphic table in which (-xo) replaces Yo in the right-hand sides) .

We can think of (24) as isomorphic to the table :

(J in the left-hand sides now being Y1Y2)'
More generally, from (16) and (17) we can obtain the table (a = Uk or yek) :
luf, a] = 0,
[a,b] = 0,
{u+i, »:f} = -(u+ f
0 v-I),
{u+ f,v+ f} = {u- t,»: f} = o.
(26)
The analogy between (26) and (22) is obvious and can be made even more explicit.
Using notations which are familiar to physicists, we choose :

and easily verify that
{Q2 - Q1, Qi +Qd = 8Y2,
{Q2 + Q1,a, + Qi} = -8Y1,
{Q2 - Q1, Qi - Qd = - 8X1,
{Q2 + Q1, Qi - Qd = - 8X2'
Defining :
Q1 = xd - xd,
Q2 = xd + xd,
Qi = - f - x1xd,
Qi = - f + x1xd
we can identify (25) and the second line of (22). Note that the Qi and Qi defined this
way are the charge conjugates of Q1 and Q2 respectively, if the charge conjugation C
is chosen such as to satisfY,f = ied· (Q1' Q2, Qi, Qi) can be taken as a'Majorana
type' basis for this conjugation.
Many tables for graded Lie algebras relevant to mathematical physics and used
in the literature, could be found along similar lines .

EXISTENCE CONDITIONS FOR SPINOR
STRUCTURES.
14.1
The Clifford algebra of a manifold.
14.1.1
V is a real n-dimensional Coo manifold with a pseudo-riemannian structure of sig-
nature (p, n - p) (we will assume that p :s; n - p).
Q is, just as before in the case of E = R", a non-degenerate quadratic form of
signature (p,n - p). V is 'modeled' on (Rn,Q). X stands for a smooth vector field
of V, and the set of all such fields is denoted by Dl(V). The field of quadratic forms
is also denoted by Q.
Definition 14.1.1 The Clifford algebra Clifv]Q) of V is tbe quotient of tbe tensor
algebra Q9D1(V ) of differentiable vector fields on V by tbe two-sided ideal J generated
by tbe elements
X 18' X - Q(X),
X E D1(V) .
Formally, this definition coincides with the definition given in Chapter 3 for vector
spaces. Dl(V) is a module over the ring Coo(V) of Coo differentiable functions.
If U is an open set in V, Clifv(Q) induces an algebra Clifu(Q) on U which
can be identified with the quotient of Q9Dl(U) by the two-sided ideal Ju (where
X E Dl(U)).
If the coordinates (x
Q
) are defined on U, a/ax 1 ,a/ax2 , . • • , a/axn form a basis
of Dl(U), which is a free module of dimension n, and Clifu(Q) is a (2n)-dimensional
module over Coo(U) : the proofs are the same as for vector spaces.
If x E V, Clifv(Q) induces a Clifford algebra Clifx(Q) at the point z , this algebra
is a (2n)-dimensional real vector space that can also be constructed directly on the
tangent space by the well-known procedure.
The definition of Clifford fields is similar to that of vector fields .

14.1.2
Derivations in the Clifford algebra of a manifold.
181
Let x ~ Y", be a vector field Y on V which induces a local one-parameter transfor-
mation group t ~ ({Jt. If CPt stands for the natural extension of the tangent map d ({J t
to tensor fields , the Lie derivative L y of the tensor field K is defined by :
(LyK)", = lim~(K", - (cpt(K))", ).
t-.O t
Ly is a derivation in the tensor algebra of V . From this it follows that :
Ly(X ® X - Q(X)) = Ly(X) ® X + X ® Ly(X) - Ly(Q(X)),
and if 9 stands for the symmetric bilinear form associated to the field Q on V , by
an easy contraction :
Lx(Q(X)) = 2g(LyX,X) + (LyQ)(X) .
X ® X' +X' ® X - 2g(X, X') belonging to J, Ly is seen to globally preserve J if and
only if Ly(Q) = 0, in which case Y induces a local isometry group (Y is a Killing
field) . We have proved :
Proposition 14.1.1 The Lie derivative L y extends to tbe Clifford algebra of V if
and only if L y ( Q) = 0, Y inducing a local isometry group .
Now let "il be a linear connection. The same formal computations yield :
"ily(X ® X - Q(X)) = "ily(X) ® X + X ® ("ilyX) - "ily(Q(X) )
"ily(Q(X)) = 2g("ilyX,X) + ("il yg )(X,X)
and the result :
Proposition 14.1.2 Tbe covariant derivative "ily extends to tbe Clifford algebra of
V if and only if 'Wg = °i.e. tbe connection "il is euclidean .
14.1.3
The Clifford bundle of V.
The group O(Q) has a natural extension to C(Q) of its action in E = R", as can be
shown if we verify that O( Q) preserves the ideal generated by the z Q9 x - Q(z ), or
also by the results of Chapter 8, 3.2, using the representation B such that :
B'I'(g)(w) = gwg- 1 ,
9 E Pin(Q)
(or Bp(g)(w) = a(g )wg-1 ) .
To the principal bundle of orthonormal bases for V a vector bundle of fiber C(Q)
can be associated by a classical procedure; its structural group is the previously
defined extension of O(Q). This bundle is the Clifford bundle of V , denoted by
Clif(V,Q) (or Clif (V) for short). It is a bundle of rank 2n over Rand its fibers are
real Clifford algebras.
A section of Clif(V) is a Clifford field by the definition in section 1.

182
CHAPTER 14
Proposition 14.1.3 The bundles Clif(V) and A(T(V)) are linearly isomorphic when
considered as vector bundles.
Proof. A(T(V)) is the exterior algebra bundle associated to the tangent bundle T(V)
of V . This follows at once from the linear identification between C(Q) and A(E). I
Note that the space of sections of Clif(V) has a Clifford algebra structure.
Algebraic spin subbundles.
Definition 14.1.2 Every vector subbundle Spin(V) of Clif(V) such that Vx E V ,
Spin",(V) is a minimal left ideal of Clif",(V) is called an amorphic algebraic spin
subbundle. Every local or global section of Spin(V) is called an amorphic spinor
field. Every section of Clif(V) such that e", is an idempotent element of Clif",(V) for
all x E V will be called an idempotent field. Every section x ---. f(x) ofClif(V) such
that f( x) is an isotropic r-vector is called a field of isotropic r-vectors.
It is easy to give sufficient conditions for the existence of an amorphic spin sub-
bundle :
1. there exists a global primitive idempotent field
2. there exists a global isotropic r-vector field (if Q is neutral, n = 2r) .
By the results of Chapter 5, 1.7 and 2.4, the first condition is stronger than the
second if Q is neutral. But both conditions clearly can be weakened since there may
exist different idempotent elements which determine the same left ideal and since
the isotropic r-vector may be replaced by >..f, >..(x) :I 0, Vx E V .
We will prove an important result, assuming that the second condition holds :
Proposition 14.1.4 The covariant derivative defined by an euclidean connection 'V
does not extend naturally to the amorphic spinors.
Proof. Consider the case where Q is neutral, n = 2r, and where there exists an
isotropic r-vector field x --+ f( x) defining the amorphic spin subbundle.
Take a Witt basis over a suitable open set U, x
--+ {e",(x),e.a'(x)} , a.,f3 =
1,2 , ... ,r, such that f(x)
= (el.6. .. .er.)(X) and that the spinor field is given
by
If \l could be naturally extended to the spinors,
would hold .

should hold , meaning that, if the wj are the connection forms for the chosen Witt
bases,
w;. = o.
However, if we express that \1 is euclidean in terms of the Witt basis , we obtain
w;. + w~. = 0,
(1)
and these conditions do not imply that w$. = O.
Remarks.
A similar result holds for the Lie derivative.
In Chapter 11, we introduced the group H of elements, such that ,f = ±f,
p(H) = 9 and L.:(Q) = L.:(H) consists of elements u such that uf = O.
If (x Q

where both summations are over all a and 13 from 1 to T .
f3(u) + u = 0 implies that E~ a

If an element of an enlarged spinoriality group is considered, only condition (3)
arises. This proves :

184
CHAPTER 14
Proposition 14.1.5 If the signature is neutral, an euclidean connection will nat-
urally induce a derivation on the local amorphic spinor fields (defined by a local
isotropic r-vector field) if and only if its forms have values in the Lie algebra of an
enlarged spinoriality group.
Analogous results can be obtained for the case where the first sufficient condition
is assumed to hold .
V extends naturally to the emotpbic spinors if
eVe = O.
(4)
Indeed, e2 = e and \7xue = V x(ue
2 ) = Vx(ue) + ueVxe, so that V will not , in
general, satisfy (4).
14.2
Existence conditions for spinor structures.
We assume that n = 2r and use the notations and the assumptions of Chapter II),
2.1 concerning the space (E, Q) and its complexification (E', Q').
14.2.1
Trivial Pin( Q) spinor structures.
Let {x a , Y/3} denote the 'real' Witt basis W obtained from an orthonormal real basis
using the method of Chapter lfl, 2.1.
f = YIY2 · · ' Yr ,
C( Q')f is a spinor space for the representation p of C( Q') for which p(u)v f = uvf.
The space C( Q')f will be considered as the space of a faithful representation of
Pin(Q).
Consider another 'real' Witt basis 0 =
{~a, 7J/3}, associated to the orthonormal
basis R, such that
0= <pg(W),
9 E Pin(Q),
<p(g) = T E O(Q) .
Then
s = {~al ~a2 .. . ~a"g!} = {gXil Xi2 . . . Xi,,!}
(1)
is a basis for C( Q')f.
If 0 is replaced by another real Witt bas is 0' associated to the orthonormal basis
R' of E, where :
g' = ,g, S is replaced by

If ,p is an element of C2r defining a spinor in the basis 5 and ,p' defines the same
spinor in the basis 5', we set
(3)
The choice of 5 corresponds to that of the pair (R,g) (W being fixed) . Hence
(R, g) and (D,g) can be called 'spin bases' over Rand D respectively. Since there
exist Witt bases for C(Q')! which are not associated to real orthonormal bases,
we consider pairs (D,g) and (D',g') where D and D' are arbitrary Witt bases and
s.s' E Pin(Q'), but / = g'g-l belonging to Pin(Q), since we are only interested in
the action of Pin(q) on C(Q')! and on the bases .
Definition i4.2.1 D, D' being Witt bases, s.g' E PineQ'), the pairs (D, g) and
(D', g') are said to define a trivial Pine Q) spinor structure if
D' = O"(D),
<Ph) = 0",
/ = g'g-l E Pin(Q).
Two triples (D,g,,p) and (D',g',,p'), 1/J,,p' E C2r then determine the same spinor if
and only if
in the sense of (3).
Note that if the basis W = {Xi,Yj} and the ideal C(Q')Y1Y2 " ' Yr are replaced
by another Witt basis
{x~, yj} and the ideal C(Q')y~y~ . .. Y;, a /1 E Pine Q') can be
found such that it maps W' to Wand (O,g) is replaced by (TID/II ,91d = (D1,gd .
(D,g, ,p) and (D1 , gl,1/J') still determine the same spinor since

-Hence the choice of the spinor ideal does not influence the definition.
Note that if we would use a primitive idempotent instead of an isotropic r-vector,
we would not be certain that a /1 E PineQ') can be found such that it maps one
primitive idempotent to another (cf. Chapter 5, 2.4).
This situation can be naturally generalized if we replace Pine Q) by a principal
bundle, the set of D by a bundle of bases under the group O(Q), the spinor space by
a 'vector spin' bundle on which the group PineQ) acts, and the previous 'equivariant'
actions by morphisms : all this leads us to the following
14.2.2
Definition 14.2.2 (Pin(Q) spinor structure on a manifold, n = 2r.) Let V be a
pseudo-riemannian (or a riemannian) Coo paracompact (n = 2r)-dimensional mani-
fold, let ( be the principal bundle of orthonormal bases, with group O(Q). A Pine Q)
spin or structure is said to exist on V if a principal bundle." with group PineQ) and
a principal morphism h from." to ( can be constructed.

where R., and R<p(-r) , 'Y E Pin(Q), stand for the 'right translations' and q, II for the
projections on the base.
More explicit ly, since we can always define the bundles." and eusing open sets
(Ua)aEA corresponding to a common trivialization, local sections Za, Ra with tran-
sition functions 'Ya[3 and <Pba(3) must exist, such that Vx E Ua n U[3,
Z[3(X) = za(xha[3(x),
'Ya[3(x) E Pin(Q),
h(z[3(X)) = R[3(x) = h(za(x)<Pba[3(x))) = Ra(x)epba[3(x)).
Clearly, the orthonormal bases could be replaced by 'real' Witt bases.
By a standard procedure, a 'vector spin' bundle ( (q : ( -t V) with group PineQ)
and fiber C 2r can be associated to the principal bundle 17, Pin(Q) acting on C2r by
(3).
C2r will be identified with the standard space for which
is a basis .
If 8 stands for the isomorphism from G(Q') to C2
r which is determined by the
basis {Xi,Yi} , its restriction to G(Q') allows us to set 1f; = 8(u), u E G(Q')f, 1f; E C2r.
By classical results a field of PineQ) spinors 1f; over an open subset U of V is a
differentiable mapping

14.2.3
Necessary conditions for the existence of a Pin(Q) spinor struc-
ture.
If x E U0. and if x ~ ROo(x) is a differentiable field of orthonormal bases, this field
can be identified with a field of 'real' Witt bases x ~ Woo(x), so that
where the
()~ are local isomorphisms : if x E u; n UfJ and if ((}~),
((}~) correspond to
Uo. and UfJ respectively, the transition functions from
()~ to
()~ are of the form ep(ro.fJ),
ro.fJ(x) E Pin(Q), where ro.fJ is a differentiable function of z , For each z E Uo. the
((}~) define an isomorphism from C(Q) to Clifx(V) which can be extended to the
complexifications C(Q') ~ Clif~(V) .
The Pin(Q) spinor structure on V then induces a tr ivial Pin(Q) spinor structure
(d. sect ion 1) on the tangent space at x : an open set U containing z can be found
along with an equivalence class of pairs (Dx,9x) where x ~ Dx is a local section of
the bundle ec and x ~ 9x is a differentiable mapping sending z E U into Pin(Q'),
(D~)9~) being equivalent to (Dx,9x) if 9~9;;1 E Pin(Q).
Note that arbitrary Witt bases must be used in the complexified bundle ec.
If x E Uo. n UfJ , two equivalent pairs (in the sense of Definition (14.2.1)) must be
obtained :
(D~ =
(}~{>.0.(X)(Xi ,Yj)A~1(X)},90.(X)),
(D~ =
(}~{>.fJ(X)(Xi,Yj)A~1(X)},9fJ(X)) ,
where Ao.(X), AfJ(X),90.(X),9fJ(X) E Pin(Q'), Ao. and AfJ are defined on U« and UfJ re-
spectively, and 90., 9fJ on some open neighborhood of x in Uo.nufJ , 9fJ9;;1(X) E Pin(Q)
and 9fJ(x) = 90.fJ(z )90.(x), the ep(90.fJ) being the O(Q)-valued transition functions from
Do. to DfJ. Also note that
A0.90.fJA~1 = ro.fJ.
We set
(}:{>.o.(X)(Xi,Yj)A~l(X)}= ep:{Xi,Yj},
the ep~ determine an isomorphism from C(Q') to
Clif~(V) .
By the results of section 1, the space of spinors over x can be identified with an
ideal of Clif~(V) and the spin bases with the bases of this ideal, hence a spinor in x
can be considered as a well-defined element of some minimal left ideal of Clif~(V).
The identification of a basis for ex with ep~{Xi, . .. XiJ} commutes with the act ion
of r E Pin(Q), since a spinor in z has components ai' oo.ih(x) and
ai, .ooih(x )ep:(Xi, ... xihf) = ep:(ai, oo.ih(x )Xi, ... XiJ)
so relying on (5),
ep:b-lai, oo.ihrxi, . . .XiJ) = r-1ai' oo.ih(x)ep:(rXi, ... Xihf)·
ep~ corresponding to the action of E90.fJ(x), E = ± 1) the spinor which is identified
with ep~(f) in the first basis is described by ep~(E9;;J(X)J) in the second one, so
f = Ef9;;J(X),

and applying the main antiautomorphism,
ga(3(x)f = ±f,
CHAPTER 14
(6)
which means that ga(3 belongs to the subgroup H of Pine Q) introduced in Chapter
11 and that <p(ga(3) belongs to the spinoriality group 9 c O(Q).
Next we obtain
which we will write as
f(3(x) = 9a(3(x)fa9;J(X).
<p~(ga(3(x)) =
<p~(ga(3(x)) = 9a(3(X) and, relying on (6) :
f(3(x) = N(9a(3(x))fa(x),
(7)
(8)
where N(9a(3(x)) = N(ga(3(x)),
Note that the <p(ga(3) are transition functions for sections of the complexification
of ~, the cocycle lfJC!a(3) which defines ~ and the cocycle <p(ga(3) are cohomologous in
O(Q') .
We have proved :
Proposition 14.2.1 If a Pin(Q) spinor structure exists on the manifold V :
1. Modulo a factor (±1) there exists, on V, a field ofisotropic r-vectors (a 'pseudo-
field') i.e. avectorsubbundleofClif'(V,Q') defined, for X E Ua, by fa(x) ,
2. The complexified pseudo-riemannian bundle ~c of frames admits local sections
such that if0.(3(x) = 0.a(x)<p(ga(3(x)), x E Va n V(3, <p(ga(3(X)) E O(Q),
f(3(x) = 9a(3(x)fa(X)9;J(X),
f(3(x) = N(9a(3(x))fa(x) ,
3. The structural group of the pseudo-riemannian bundle ~ of frames can be re-
duced, in O(Q'), to a spinoriality group.
14.2.4
Sufficient conditions for the existence of a PineQ) spinor structure.

(9a.(3(X) E Pin(Q)), a Pin(Q) spinor structure exists on V.
In this proposition, the 9a.(3 are determined up to a sign change.
Proof.
1. Relying on (8), f(3(x)Ya.(3(x) = 9a.(3(x)fa.(x) leads to
N(Ya.(3(x))fa.(x)Ya.(3(x) = 9a.(3(x)fa.(x),
and by the results on pure spinors :
But since
gQf3(x)fa.(x)g~J(X) = lV(gu{3(x))fu(x)
the Fundamental Lemma (10.3.1), ensures that
N(Ya.(3(x)) = p,2N(Ya.(3(x)),
p,2 = 1
so that Ya.(3(x)fa.(x) = ±fa.(x) and
f(3(x)y~J(x) = ±fa.(x) i.e.
9a.{3(x)f = ±f,
9a.(3(X) E H.
189
2. Choose a standard f such that cP~(J) = fa. (e ), cP~(J) = f(3( x) and introduce the
local Clifford section z ~ CP~(Xil .. .XiJ) over (Ua.); we will write (Xil . .. XihJ)~
for short.
(Xi l . . . XiJ)~ = ±Ya.(3(x)(Xil . . . XihJ)~
and both Clifford sections being well-defined, for x E Ua. n U(3 a i'a.(3(x) can be
found such that cp(i'a.(3) = cp(Ya.(3(x)), "Ya.(3(x) E Pin(Q).
and a Pin(Q) spinor structure for V is obtained, since at every point z E
Ua. n U{3 n Ui ; the coefficients of "Ya.{3(x), "Ya.-y(x) and "Y(3-y(x) will satisfy the

CHAPTER 14
Proposition 14 .2.3 A pseudo-riemannian manifold has a Pin(Q) spinor structure
if and only if the structural group of the principal bundle of frames can be reduced
to a spinoriality group in O(Q').
Proof. Denoting the transition functions by cp(gal3(x)) ,
the cp~ being the local isomorphisms :
gal3(x)fa(x) = ±fa(x)
leads to fa(x)g;;J(x) = ±fa(x) and from fl3(x) = gal3(x)fa(x)g;;J(x) we find
fl3(x) = ±gal3(x)fa(x) = ±fa(x),
fl3(x)g;;J(x) = ±fa(x)
and the proof continues as in Proposition (14.2 .2), part 2.
I
Corollary 14.2.1 The set ofPin(Q) spinor structures on a manifold Von which at
least one exists, is of the same cardinality as Hl(V, Z2)'
Proof. This follows from part 2 in the proof of Proposition (14.2.2) ; the good choice
of 1a13 depends on a cocycle with values in Z2 ~ {-1, 1}.
I
Remark.
1. If a Pin(Q) spinor structure exists, it is important to note that the reduction
to a spinoriality group leads to a SO( Q)-valued cocycle; from this, one cannot
conclude that the bundle ~ is orientable, since this reduction is carried out in
O(Q').
2. Under the same assumptions as 1, an algebraic spin subbundle is defined by the
pseudo-field whose restriction to Ua is x --+ fa(x); this is a complex subbundle
of the bundle Clif'(V,Q').
3. If V is orientable, the notion of Spin]Q) spinor structure should be clear to the
reader, who may easily adapt the results of this subsection to that case .
14 .3
Some particular results.
14.3.1
Spinor structures on spacetime VI,a.
Let us compute a spinoriality group, using the special Witt basis

THE CLIFFORD ALGEBRA OF A MANIFOLD.
191
and express that uf = 0, f
= Y1Y2, if u E £(H), the Lie algebra of H .
These
elements are of the form QX2Y1 + aY1Y2, or
(1)
Band C being real numbers. £(H) is easily seen to be a commutative Lie algebra.
Consider the connected component of the identity in the Lorentz group 0(1 ,3), i.e.
the restricted Lorentz group, sometimes written as L~ . The connected component
go of the spinoriality group g must be a commutative group of real dimension 2, its
Lie algebra being commutative. Formula (1) shows that every element of this group
is generated by :
a hyperbolic rotation 'ljJ in (e1' e3),
a hyperbolic rotation B in (e1' e2),
an ordinary rotation B in (e3'e4),
an ordinary rotation 'ljJ in (e2'e4)'
This group therefore is not compact, and being connected and abelian, a classical
result implies that it is isomorphic to R 2 • Under these conditions a spinoriality group
(connected or not) is homeomorphic to a finite product of copies of R 2 .
If a Pine Q) spinor structure exists over V1,3 , a reduction to a spinoriality group
must occur for the structural group 0(1,3). By a known result, the bundle obtained
in this way is trivial, its structural group having the topological property established
in the previous paragraph. Hence :
Proposition 14.3.1 If a Pine Q) spinor structure exists over spacetime, the bundle
of frames is triviel.'
14.3.2
Almost hermitian structure and spinor structure.
Let V be an (n = 2r)-dimensional almost complex manifold and let Q be a positive
definite metric on Q endowing V with an almost hermitian structure. In Chapter
11, we saw that in this case a spinoriality group g is similar to SUer, C) in O(Q').
We recall some classical results.
A real (n = 2r )-dimensional manifold is called a almost complex manifold if the
structural group of its frame bundle can be reduced to GL(n, C). This is equivalent
to the existence of a section J : x -? Jx of T(V) 0 T*(V) on V for which J2 = - Id,
or to the decomposition of the complexified tangent bundle TC(V) as a direct sum
of two complex conjugate bundles, i.e. TC(V) = T1 E£1 1'1> the trivialization cocycles
of the vector bundles T1 and 1'1 having complex conjugate transition functions. Such
a V is orientable.
Then a hermitian metric can be defined on V, such that for the associated sym-
metric bilinear form, g(JX,JY) = g(X,Y) holds for all vector fields X, Yon V.
1Note that the reduction is in O(QI).

192
Next a regular antisymmetric 2-form F is defined on V by
F(X,Y) = g(X, JY),
CHAPTER 14
giving V an 'almost symplectic' structure.
In each z E V, the spaces (Td", and (1\)", are eigenspaces of J with eigenvalues
i and -ij they are totally isotropic for the metric g. The subbundles T1 and 1'1
therefore naturally define two amorphic spin subbundles of Clif'(V)-in the purely
algebraic sense of Definition (14.1.2) .
Definition 14.3.1 A SpineQ) spinor structure is said to be naturally associated to
the almost hermitian structure if the amorphic spin subbundle defined by it is the
complex subbundle O(V) determined by T(V) in TC(V).
Note that the introduction of an almost hermitian structure reduces the structural
group of the tangent bundle T(V) to U(r, C) and that O(V) can be identified with
TI .
Under these conditions, we have :
Proposition 14.3.2 The reduction to SUer, C) in SOCQ') of the structural group
of T(V), V being a manifold with almost hermitian structure, is equivalent to the
existence of a SpineQ) spinor structure which is naturally associated to the almost
hermitian structure.
Proof. Let (Uat ,Oat) be an atlas of local trivializations of T(V),
O~ extends to the
Clifford algebras. We set
f~(x) = O~(f),
f = Y1Y2 . . .Yr
(as before),
f~(x) = 9~{J(x)f~(x)g':;(x),
<p(g~{J(x)) E U(r, C),
f~(x) = Jt~~f~(x),
where IJtat/3(x)1 = 1 since this coefficient corresponds to the determinant of a unitary
matrix. If the group VCr, C) reduces to SUer, C), the cocycle defined by the (Jtat{J)
is cohomologous to the identity and local isomorphisms Oat exist for T(V), with
transition functions in SUer, C), for which
Oat(f)
=
O~(Aat(x)fA~l(x)) ,
Aat(x) E Pine Q')
(even Spin]Q'))
=
fat(x).
fat(x) and
f~(x) define the same m.t.i.s. at z , but
f/3(x) = 9at/3(x)fat(x)g;:J(x),
f/3(x) = fat(x)
and N(gat/3(x)) = 1 completes the proof.
The converse follows from the previous
results.
I
In fact V is orientable and we could speak of Spin(Q) spinor structures.
The following Lemma will be used in the proof of Proposition (14.3.3) :

Let 6 E Pin(Q) sending {Xi,Yj} to {Xil,Yjl}, 616- 1= >.2f implies that 6f = J.lf
and >.2 = J.l2N(6) (d. Chapter 10, 3.1), but 6 E Spin(Q) and N(6) = 1. so Sf = ±f
and 6 may be chosen such that 6f = >'I.

pbic to tbe tensor square of anotber complex line bundle.

for some cocycle (lIa{3 ), local sections X E Ua ~ G-a(x) exist in the bundle of cocycle
(lIa{3 ), such that a~(x ) =

Equating this to fa and relying on f~ (x) = J.la{3(x)f~ (x ), f{3(x) = fa(x ),
and there exists a Spin(Q) spinor structure.
Conversely, if V has a Spin(Q) spinor structure, we may assume that it is nat-
urally associated to B(V), x ~
f~(x) defining B(V) locally and x -t fa(x) being a
Spin(Q) spinor structure (so f{3(x) = fa(x), f~(x) and fa(x) are collinear).

From f{3(x) = f,,(x) we then see that

Remark.
Hl(V, CO) is known to be isomorphic to H2(V, Z) . The cocycle (P,a{3)
defines the first Chern class cl(B(V)); Proposition (14.3 .3) means that a Spin(Q)
spinor structure exists if and only if cl(B(V)) = 2Cl(B(V)) for some cl(B(V)) E
H 2(V, Z) . This condition implies the vanishing of the second Stiefel-Whitney class
W2, since it is the (mod 2) reduction of cl(B(V)) .
14.3.3
The generalized twistor bundle naturally associated to a Pin(Q)
spinor bundle.
Having defined a twistor of order q as any element of a vector space isomorphic to
the direct sum of q spinor spaces for the complexified Clifford algebra over (E, Q), a
twistor is an element of a left ideal of C(Q') for the chosen representation.
If a Pin(Q) spinor structure exists on the manifold V , we know by the previous
results that a pseudo-field of isotropic r-vectors exists in its complexified Clifford
bundle.
The choice of the standard spinor space corresponds to that of an isotropic r-
vector f .
From f
= YIY2"'Yr, where {Xj,Yi} is a real Witt basis, 2r isotropic
r-vectors, of which no two are collinear, can be obtained if we exchange some Xk and
Yk (d. the proof of Proposition (8.1.5)) .
Clearly, the choice of f does not affect the definition of the spinor vector bun-
dle associated to the spin principal bundle (H is changed to gHg-l, 9 E Pin(Q)).
Therefore we have the :
Proposition 14 .3.4 If there exists a Pin(Q) spinor bundle over V, there also exists
a twistor bundle of order 2r over V, i.e, the Clifford bundle is the Whitney sum of
2r spinor bundles.
14.4
Enlarged spinor structures and others.
14.4.1
Definition 14.4.1 The pseudo-riemannian (possibly riemannian) manifold V is said
to have a enlarged Pin(Q) spinor structure if the structural group O(Q) of the prin-
cipal bundle of frames can be reduced in O(Q') to an enlarged spinoriality group.

THE CLIFFORD ALGEBRA OF A MANIFOLD .
195
Proposition 14.4.1 If an enlarged Pin(Q) spinor structure exists on V :
1. There exists, up to a non-vanisbing scalar factor, a field of isotropic r-vectors
on V and, consequently, a vector subbundle of Clif'(V, QI), defined for x E Ua
byfa(x).
2. Tbe complexified pseudo-riemannian bundle of frames bas local sections :
x E Ua -+ na(x),
n,e(x) = na(x)<p(ga,e(x)),
<p(ga,e(x» E O(Q),
x E U; n U,e, sucb tbat f,e(x) = fLa,efa(x), fLa,e(x) E C*,
f,e(x) = ga,e(x)fa(x)g~J(x),
and conversely.
Proof. If 1 and 2 hold, the proof given for Proposition (14.2.2) leads to
ga,e(x)f = >'a,e(x)f,
>'a,e(x) E C*.
Conversely, if ga,e(x)f = >'a,e(X)f, the proof of Proposition (14 .2.3) can be used. I
Corollary 14.4.1 If V bas almost complex structure, an enlarged Spin(Q) spinor
structure exists on it .
Proof. Obvious, since IILa,e1 = 1 in this case.
I
Remark.
If we define the group Ge ~ C(QI) of all pexp(iB)g, 9 E Pin(Q), p > 0
and B real, replacing Pin(Q) by Ge in Definition (14.2.2) leads to the necessary
condition expressed by parts 1 and 2 of Proposition (14.4.1).
We could therefore speak of a Ge spinor structure when the condition of Definition
(14.4.1) is met.
Topological considerations which the reader may find in the literature, allows the
reduction of Ge to its subgroup obtained by fixing p = 1; when Q is positive definite,
this is already so for algebraic reasons.
In this case the group is called a reduced enlarged spinoriality group (or a torog-
onal spinoriality group) and we speak of a torogonal spinor structure.
14.4.2
Enlarged spinor structures on the spacetime V1,3 .
The computation of the Lie algebra for a torogonal spinoriality group leads to an
element v = B(el - e4)e3 + C( el - e4)e2+ Ae2e3, using the notations of subsection
3.1, A, Band C being real.
This Lie algebra clearly is not commutative. The simple reasoning proving Propo-
sition (14 .3.1) no longer holds.
The Lie algebra of the 'little group', i.e. the stabilizer of (el - e4) can be identified
with the Lie algebra of a torogonal spinoriality group. Hence :
The 'little group' associated to an isotropic vector and a torogonal spinoriality
group are (at least) locally isomorphic.

CHAPTER 14
14.4.3
Pine Q') spinor structures.
We shall only consider complexified spaces. Pine Q') can be projected onto O(Q'),
with a kernel consisting of four elements, N(g) = ±lleading to {I , -1, i, -i}.
The Definition (14.2.2) and the proof of Proposition (14.2.1) can be adapted at
once.
E = ±1 or E = ±i, so f{3(x) = ±fQ(x) replaces formula (8). An analogous
proposition to (14.2.2) can be stated and proved.
Consider a subbundle of m.t .i.s. in the complexified bundle Tc(V) , i.e. a complex
subbundle with, in every x E V, an m.t .i.s. of T6(V) as fiber.
By Proposition
(2.2.5), such a subbundle r corresponds to a field of isotropic r-vectors defined over
V up to a non-vanishing scalar factor. If (UQ)QEA is a set of trivializing open sets
for this subbundle, we can define, for z E UQ, X --> fQ(x) =
e,o~(YIY2"
' Yr), where
f{3(x) = J-LQ{3(x)fQ( x), z E UQ n U{3,
J-LQ{3 E CO . The
J-LQ{3 define a cocycle for the
complex line bundle N(r). Such a description was given before when V was assumed
to be almost complex (d. Proposition (14.3.3), with r = B(V)).
Lemma 14.4.1 If fQand f{3 are local isotropic r-vector fields connected with the
m.t.i.s. subbundle over the trivializing open sets UQ and U{3 , new isotropic r-vectors
f~ and f~ can be chosen such as to define the same bundle and that if x E UQ n U{l,
f~(x) =
±f~·
Proof. As in Lemma (14.3 .1) (but.x = pexp iB here, p > 0) we introduce the Witt
basis f' = Y~Y~ .. . Y~ = .x2I,
Then there exist local sections

Proposition 14.4.2 The existence of a PineQ') spinor structure on V is equivalent
to that of a m .t.i.s. subbundle ofTc(V).

THE CLIFFORD ALGEBRA OF A MANIFOLD.
197
Proof. One part of this proposition has already been proved. Conversely, if a m.t.i.s.
subbundle of Tc(V) exists, (f~) can be found such that
fMX) = ±f~(x),
fMx) = 9Q(i(x)f~(x)9~J(x),
9Q(i(x) = lp(gQ(i(x)),
gQ(i(x) E Pin(Q'),
and the analogous result to Proposition (14.2.2) can be applied.
I
Remark.
By Corollary (10.3.1), a 'real' Witt basis can be considered when deter-
mining a m.t .i.s. If, therefore, we have a PineQ') spinor structure determined by the
conditions of Proposition (14.4 .1), except that lp(gQ(i(x)) E O(Q'), we can return to
the case where
f(i(x) = jLQf3(x)fQ(x)
ff3(x) = i'Qf3fQ(x)i'~J(x),
lp(-yQ(i(x)) E O(Q),
relying on the previous remark.
The notions of enlarged spinor structure and of PineQ') spinor structure are there-
fore equivalent. Since the existence condition for a Pin(Q') structure is independent
of the signature of Q, the same holds for the existence condition for an enlarged
spinor structure (except for the existence of pseudo-riemannian bundles).
14.5
Spinor structures in the odd-dimensional case.
Assume that V is (2r + I)-dimensional and orientable. The groups under considera-
tion are SOCQ), SpineQ) etc. Our definitions from section 2 go through unchanged.
The standard spinors being a representation space of C+( Q) (d. Chapter 9), we
consider a Witt basis {Xi,yj,ZO}, where Zo is non-isotropic, the Xi,Yj,ZO determine
a Witt decomposition and the space of {Xi, . .. Xihf, f =YIY2 . ..Yr} is the standard
spinor space. The results of section 2 can now easily be adapted to this case.
14.6
Spinor structures on spheres and on projective spaces.
14.6.1
Manifolds are considered here with Coo differentiable structure.
We will establish the existence of a spinor structure on all spheres s-, where n = 2r
or 2r + 1, r 2:: 1, by showing that r global isotropic sections of the complexified
tangent bundle can be defined such that they are linearly independent and generate
an m.t.i.s. field at every point.
An atlas with two maps is defined for S" by inversions, with centers given by
the poles P and P' whose Cartesian coordinates are (0,0, .. . , 1) and (0,0,
, -1).

We will also use the inversion with center Q = (-1,0,

plane K(xt = 0), with general point W denoted by (W2,W3,
wn+d. It can easily
be verified that :
In the intersection of the coordinate domains corresponding to the inversions with
centers P and Q, a local isotropic vector field of S" corresponds to local fields of
Hand K respectively, by the tangent stereographic maps. If we choose the field
A(u) = el +ie2 on H, (el' e2, . .. , en) being the canonical orthonormal basis of H , a
field B(w) on K is associated to A, its components being given, relying on (3) , by

Choose aI , {31 such that 0 < al < {31 ~ 1/2.

8(p, Wn+l) = 0,
if p ~ {31 or 11 - wn+ll ~ (31.
The existence of such a (non-unique) function follows from a classical result.

Now we prove that for p

11 - wn+ll ~ (31, G does not vanish anywhere.
Indeed, if G would vanish,
W2 = i(l - Wn+l)

For each solution where G vanishes we must ensure that 11- wn+ll < 1/2. Direct

so that 11 - Wn+ll ::; 1/2 is automatically satisfied.
If B= 7r/2, 1 - Wn+l = 1/2, W2 = 1 and the corresponding value of )..2p2 is 5/4,
but since 1 - wn+1 = 1/2 implies B = 0 by the definition of B, a contradiction is
reached.
Similarly, if B= 7r/2 -
f is a solution, f being arbitrarily small, (1-wn+l)2 +w~ =

again leads to a contradiction.
Therefore a maximal value Bo < 7r/2 exists for the solution.
Denoting the left-hand side of (6) by j2(B), if Bo < Bl < 7r/2, (1/)..2)j2(Bl) = p~
can be made smaller than 1/4 if ).. is sufficiently large; and we can even make sure
that (l/)..2)j2(B) < 1/4 for all B ::; Bl.
Since 11 - w:'+ll = 11 - cosBl - ksinBll
can be assumed strictly smaller than 1/2, a function B(p, Wn+l) can be found (in
infinitely many ways) so as to satisfy the previous conditions and B(Pl,W:'+l) = Bl,
and whose graph does not intersect the graph of 8 --t (B,(l/)..)f(B),l-wn+1(B)) in
any acceptable solution. C cannot vanish.
For p = 0, 8(p,wn+d = 7r/2, W2 = -l/k, 1 - Wn+l = k - 1, C2(P) = ai,
Cn+1(P) = -a, Cj(P) = 0, j = 3,. .. ,n, where 2a = l/P + (k - 1)2 i' o.
In this way, B has been deformed to a non-vanishing isotropic field for p ::; (3l; the
image of this field under the inversion with center Q yields, along with A obtained
previously, a global field of non-zero isotropic vectors on s-, we have
Proposition 14.6.1 On every sphere s-, n
~ 2, there exist fields of everywhere
non-zero isotropic vectors which are sections of the complexified tangent bundle of
s-.
If n ~ 4, we choose an orthonormal bas is el, e2, ea, e4, .. . and consider in H the
fields A(u) = el +ie2 and A'(u) = ea +ie4. We construct in K the analog B' of B
for A', its components B~(w) are, relying on (3) :
B~ = - W2(Wa + iW4),
B~ = 2/D - wa(wa + iW4),
Bi = 2i/D - W4(Wa +iW4),
B~ = -Wk(W2 +iW4),
B~+l = (1 - Wn+l)(wa + iW4)'
We deform this field in the same way as B . The deformed field C' is everywhere
non-zero since C~ = C~ = 0 would imply iwa = W4, so Wa = W4 = 0 and 2/D would
vanish, W4 = ...= Wn = 0 and W2 = 1 - Wn+l, which is impossible.
B and B' clearly are linearly independent everywhere; this property carries
over to their deformations C and C' since a( W )B(w) + (3(W )B'(w) = 0 with W =
(W2' Wa, ... ,Wn,Wn+l) would imply that Band B' are linearly dependent at W, which
is impossible.
Repeating this procedure, a global field of isotropic r-vectors can be constructed
on the sphere S", n = 2r or 2r +1. So, S" being orientable :

THE CLIFFORD ALGEBRA OF A MANIFOLD.
201
Proposition 14.6.2 On every sphere s-, n = 2r or 2r + 1, there exist global fields
of isotropic r-vectors, and s- therefore has a spinor structure.
Remark.
Replacing el + ie2 by el - ie2 in the proof of Proposition (14.6.1), two
complex conjugate isotropic vector fields are obtained on S"; similarly, two complex
conjugate global fields of isotropic r-vectors can be constructed on S", giving rise to
a Witt decomposition of the tangent space at every point.
The reader should not conclude from this that, for even n, s- has an almost
complex structure : this is known only to hold if n = 2 or 6.
The following considerations should clarify this :
We associate the field J to the field J constructed on S"; (J + J)/2 is a real
vector field 2 on s». Considering the real parts of (B2 , • • . Bn+1 ) and (C2 , . • • , Cn+1 ) ,
the vanishing of its components leads to the same conditions as the vanishing of J
or J; (J + J)/2 is therefore an everywhere non-zero field of real vectors. Of course,
it is a section of the complexified tangent bundle; we know that such a situation is
impossible in the real bundle of S", n = 2r.
So if the bundle determined by the global field of isotropic r-vectors and the
conjugate field were almost complex, the reduction to a spinoriality group would
occur in the real orthogonal group and there would exist non-vanishing global sections
of the real tangent bundle on the sphere, which is impossible.
Since there exists a global real non-vanishing vector field on every odd-dimen-
sional sphere, there exist n linearly independent sections of the complexified tangent
bundle of any sphere and hence:
Corollary 14.6.1 The complexified tangent bundle of any sphere is trivial.
Remarks.
It is easy to construct many different non-vanishing complex vector
fields on even-dimensional spheres.
For instance, in R S = (el,e2,e3,e4,eS)j we can consider the sphere S4 and the
complex fields'
U = -X2el + xle2 + (X4+ ixS)e3 - X3e4 - iX3eS,
V = -ix4el - X3e2 + X2e3 + (xs + iXl)e4 - X4eS,
(the Xi being the usual Cartesian coordinates). U and V are clearly tangent to S4
and do not vanish anywhere on it .
On the sphere S2 the field
1= [(1 - z) - x(x + iy)]el + [(1 - z)i - y(x + iy)]e2 + (1 - z)(x + iy)e3
2Meaning that, at every point, it coincides with its conjugate.
3But note that these examples are too naive to be used in the proof of Proposition (14.6.1).

202
CHAPTER 14
is tangent and isotropic, non-zero unless x = y = 0 and z = 1; the field
J = [(1 - x) - y(y +iz)]e2 + [(1 - x)i - z(y + iz)]e3+ (1 - x)(y +iz)el
is also tangent and isotropic, it vanishes only at x = 1, Y = z = O.
It is easy to verify that they determine the same isotropic direction in every
point where they are both defined, so their union defines a global field of isotropic
directions on S2, again proving that S2 has an enlarged spinor structure.
14.6.2
Now consider the projective plane pn(R) which can be obtained from S" by an
identification of antipodal points under the symmetry s relative to O.
where 7r is the projection from s- to pn(R).
The metric on pn(R) is naturally
deduced from that on s: and every spinor structure on pn(R) will give rise to a
spinor structure on S", which will then be invariant under the isomorphism induced
by s. Conversely, there corresponds a spinor structure on pn(R) to every spinor
structure on s- which is invariant under s.
Let us examine the action of s on a field of isotropic vectors on S" , Locally,
we can use an inversion with center P to consider the isotropic field J of S" \ {P}
obtained from A(u) = el + ie2, whose components at M = (Xl, X2, . . . ,xn+t) are
given by
Xl = (1 - xn+t) - Xl(Xl +iX2),
X2= i(l - Xn+I) - X2(XI +iX2),
Xk = -Xk(Xl +iX2),
Xn+I = (1- Xn+l)(Xl + iX2) j
and (s(J))(M) = -J(M).
First assume that n is even.
The symmetry s determines an element ,
E
Pin(n + 1) which transforms the field of isotropic r-vectors f of a spinor structure of
S" to f' = , f,-l j this structure will be invariant under s if :
l' = N(,)f,
by the results of section 2.3. Since l' = (-lYf and N(,) = 1, the metric being
positive definite, a spinor structure on pn(R) exists if and only if (-1Y = N(,) = 1,
i.e. ifr = 2r' (n = 4,8,12, . . .).
Note that if the metric was negative definite, , should be replaced by "
where
N(,/) =
-1, since s corresponds to an odd number of hyperplane symmetries,
N(a) = -1 for a vector in Rn+l given this metric.
In this case, the existence
condition is (-lY = -1, or r = 2r' +1 (n = 2,6,10, . . .). pn(R) is non-orientable if
n is even, so the structures are Pin(Q) spinor structures.

THE CLIFFORD ALGEBRA OF A MANIFOLD.
203
Now assume that n is odd.
By the general results on Clifford algebras, C+(Q) is,
in the odd-dimensional case, isomorphic to the Clifford algebra of an n-dimensional
space with a metric of opposite signature (d. Chapter 3, 3.2). If, therefore, the metric
is positive definite, we reobtain the previous situation with N(r/) = -1, r = 2r' +1,
for n = 3,7,11, . .. , there exists a spinor structure on pn(R) (which is orientable).
If the metric is negative definite, we reobtain the previous situation with N(I) =
1, but the determinant of the isometry determined by I is negative, which is inadmis-
sible since pn(R) is orientable. For n = 5,9,13, . .. there exists no spinor structure
on pn(R), regardless of the definite signature.
These results could also be obtained by methods from algebraic topology, which
are not of interest for our purposes.
14.6.3
The complex projective space pn(c) is obtained from the space R 2n+2, given a linear
operator J such that J2 = - Id which determines a complex space structure C n+1 on
it. Pn(C) is the quotient of the sphere S2n+! (the set of points x E cn+! for which
xx = 1) by the equivalence relation for which y and z are equivalent if and only if
z = JIp(Y) where JIp = coeip + Jsin<p (this corresponds to z = (expi<p)y in cn+l).
JIp is an isometry, since (JlpX)2 = x2, z and J(x) being orthogonal. Note that
J o = Id, J.,.= - Id.
The action of JIp on a standard isotropic r-vector of H, written I, is expressed
by :
fl = Ilpf,;1 = (cos rup+ i sin tup)f,
lip lifts JIp to Spin(2n + 2), since
(cos<p+ Jsin<p)(el + ie2) = (cos o + isin<p)(el + ie2)
can be assumed; by Lemma (14.3.1) there exists 51p E Spin(2n + 2) such that
(

51p is defined modulo ± Id, and the Fundamental Lemma (10.3.1) ensures that
5lpf5;1 = (cos tup +i sin n<p)f,
(5;1, 1p)f(5;1, 1p)-1 = f·
On S2n+l we reobtain the case examined in 6.2 for pn(R). There exists a spinor
structure if and only if n is odd.

Spin connections-covariant derivation.
15.1.1
We consider a pseudo-riemannian (possibly riemannian) manifold V with a spinor
structure in one of the senses introduced in the previous chapter. The dimension of
V is n = 2r.
The spinors are constructed using minimal left ideals by the method of isotropic
r-vectors in the complexified Clifford algebra. ( is the spinor bundle and r(0 the
space of its sections.
We have already noted that the covariant derivation associated to an euclidean
connection V naturally extends to the manifold's Clifford algebra but not, in general,
to its spinor fields.
Let U be an open set in V on which a local field of Witt bases {x"" XI3'}, Ct., /3 =
1,2, . . . , r is defined, such that the product XpX2 ' . .. X r ' = ! represents the pseudo-
field of isotropic r-vectors which we know to exist if V has a Pin(Q) spinor structure.
Over U we can express the local spinor fields in terms of the frame {Xil . . . Xih!}'
The local components of the connection form V will, if V is euclidean, satisfy
the conditions worked out in the previous chapter :

Spin-euclidean connections.
Definition 15.1.1 Every connection satisfying the conditions (1), (3) and (4) is

General spin connections.
Let w be the euclidean connection form, then the isomorphism between the Lie
algebras associates to it a form u with values in the Lie algebra of Spin(Q).
By the method used in Chapter 6, 1.4, noticing that every element of the Lie
algebra of Pin( Q) can be written as a~xixi, the summation being from 1 to n, where

so that the matrix Ilaill of the Lie algebra of O(Q) corresponds to

Lie algebra of Pin(Q) :
ep(a~xixj) = 411aill.
In terms of the euclidean connection form w, the Xi standing for local sections of
special Witt bases, we have
To the euclidean connection with form w, there corresponds a spin connection with
L:(Pin(Q))-valued form
under the principal morphism from the bundle 7] to the bundle e (cf. Definition
(14.2.2)), which is a connection on the spinor bundle ( associated to the principal
bundle 7].

Remark.
By a classical result from connection theory, an infinite number of con-
nect ions acting on the spinor bundle ( can be obtained by adding to u any I-form
field 8 with values in the linear endomorphism algebra of the spin sections, i.e. by
the properties highlighted before, a Clifford algebra valued l-forrn field.
The resulting forms are no longer L:(Pin( Q) )-valued. 8 is called the Clifford excess
of the connection.
By Proposition (15.1.4), an enlarged spin-euclidean connection can be considered
as a particular spin connection with non-vanishing Clifford excess (it equals !w~:) .

The covariant derivative of cospinors.
By a classical procedure the connection extends to the dual (* of the bundle ( ,
and the connection form on the dual is _uT .
Assuming that the structural group of the pseudo-riemannian bundle can be
reduced to its subgroup of elements rp(Go) (such that N(ga{3(x)) = 1), then a field
x -+ f(x) of isotropic r -vectors can be defined and, by the definition of the bilinear
form B (Chapter 8, 2.1), there exists a field of bilinear forms, st ill denoted B such
that :
{3(vJ)wf = B(vf, wJ)f.
B is non-degenerate and Bx defines a duality between Clif~(V)f and the minimal
right ideal fClif~(V).
The dual bundle of (, considered as fClif~(V), can therefore be identified with
the bundle fClif~(V), which we will call the cospinor bundle.
If v f and wf are canonical basis sections vf = X a 1 . . . xa,J, wf = X{31 •• • X{3kI,
the definition of the dual connection (still denoted by D) leads to the relations :
(fv,Dwf) + (D(Jv),wf) = dB({3(Jv),wf) = 0,
B({3(Jv),uwf) + B({3(Dfv),wf) = 0,
fvuwf = -(Dfv)wf,
Vwf.
D(Jv) = -fvu
(8)
a formula that solves completely this problem and, if the connection has no Clifford
excess, expresses that if the cospinor rp equals {3(.,p) :
Drp = {3(Drp)
i.e.
D({3.,p) = {3(D.,p).
From this, covariant derivatives can be obtained on all the fields considered before,
using the duality and the tensor product.
Proposition 15.1.5 If D is the spin derivative canonically associated to \l, DB = O.
Proof. D extends to tensor products of spinors by a classical procedure and commutes
with contractions, so by the previous computations and the definition of the dual
connection, using the same notations :
(-{3(vf)u,wf) + ({3(vf) ,uwf)
and the result follows from
dB(vf,wf) = 0
(DB)(vf, wf) + B(Dvf, wf) + Biu],Dwf)

In fact, physicists use an orthonormal basis ei, but these e, being linear combina-

= Da(Da1/J) + ~EaEf3(DaD{3 - D{3Da)'ljJ.
For the computation, it is more convenient to assume that the (Ea ) form a natural
frame of local coordinates, so that by (10) ,

Relying on the Bianchi identities

The definition of b. does not depend on the choice of the local frame Ea. If these

global charge conjugation C exists (d. Lemma (15.1.2», choosing the Ea real and
relying on (14), we obtain for the Dirac adjoint A(7jJ) = ~ that
L7jJ = fDa - m7jJ,
L7jJ = -Da"pf - m~ = -Da~f - m~
or L~ = L7jJ and similarly L'~ = L'"p.
c) The tensor product of spinor and cospinor fields (1-1 type spinors). We
saw in Chapter 8, 3 that S (j!) (3(S) and C(Q') can be identified by vf (j!) fw ~ vfw
and that
gvf (j!) fwg- t ~ gvfwg- t ,

Consequently, there exists an isomorphism from the tensor product of the spinor
bundle ( with the cospinor bundle Co introduced before to the complexified Clifford
bundle; hence also an isomorphism from this tensor product to the exterior algebra

F2"p can be expressed in a similar way;
and these formulas hold for arbitrary E" and -;.
By the bundle isomorphism just mentioned the spin connection D which is canon-
ically associated with the euclidean connection V, corresponds to the extension of
V to Clifford fields.
The parallel transport along V transforms an orthonormal frame in another or-
thonormal frame, so the linear identification of Clifford algebras and euclidean alge-
bra fields is preserved by the covariant derivative.

The Lie derivative of spinors.

Let X be a Killing field of V (i.e. a field which induces a local group of isometries,
hence such that Lx(Q) = 0, by a well-known result). We have mentioned in Chapter
14, 1.2 that the Lie derivative Lx defined by X can be naturally extended to the
Clifford algebra of V .
Consider a connection \7 with form w on V, assumed euclidean and torsion-free.
By a classical result from differential geometry,

or a~:f for short .
For x E V , the matrix of Lx belongs to an enlarged spinoriality group.
Let us assume in particular that this matrix corresponds to an element of .c(Q)
and that \1 is torsion-free and spin-euclidean (the existence of such a connection may
cause problems for the topology of V i we have proved in Schemas d'Einstein-Dirac
en spin 1/2, Ann. LH.P. Vol. 23, n. 3, 1975, that the Ricci tensor of the connection
must vanish identically in this case). Let .,p be a local Witt section as in section 1 of
this chapter.

the proof of Proposition (15.1.2) and yields
HqkXkx;xi).,p = X k\1k.,p,
the fjk being the coefficients of the connection \1. As to (\1",X), we can write
relying on (1).
Transforming the second set of terms yields

Now, if we make no assumptions on the Killing field X nor on the matrix field

In general, this derivation will no longer be associated to the Lie derivative in
the Clifford algebra. The Lie derivative is then extended to the dual spinors and to
tensor products by requiring the usual properties and, particularly, the commutation
with contractions. A similar computation to that for the covariant derivative proves
that if 8 = I»; ... X"'h is a cospinor,
and that
Lx(8) = X k\7k8 + H\7 jX)i8xixj .
It is then a routine task to compute the Lie derivatives of all types of spinors. Finally,
we may define
Lx = Lx <:9 In + 12, <:9 Lx,
the Lie derivative allowing the extension of this operator to 'tensor-spinor' fields,
just as we did for the covariant derivative.
15.2.2
Generalization.
Let us examine under what conditions a derivation D of the tensor algebra of V,
preserving the type and commuting with the contractions. will 'naturally' extend to
spinor fields. First, it must extend to the Clifford algebra, so it should preserve the
ideal J generated by the elements X <:9 X - Q(X). The same computation as for
the covariant derivative and the Lie derivative shows that D(Q) = 0 is the condition
for D to extend to the Clifford algebra. The restriction of D to vector fields defines
an infinitesimal isometry. In the canonical Witt bases, the matrix IIDjl1 of D has to
satisfy the condition D~. = O. which is clearly a sufficient condition. The action of
D on the spinor "l/J belonging to a local Witt basis, is then expressed by
"l/J ~ HD~xixj)"l/J
.
D can then be extended using the same procedure as before. to the cospinor fields
and to all tensor products of tensors and spinors, under the sole condition that IIDjl1
be the matrix of an infinitesimal isometry.

Chapter 16
THE DIRAC EQUATION.
16.1
We will express the main results concerning the Dirac equation, using the concepts
and the notations of this book.
In this chapter, we use a standard Minkowski space E with complexification
E'; its signature is (+ - --), an orthonormal basis is given by e1,e2,e3,e4 where
(e1)2 = 1 and a Witt basis

f = YIY2·
On the spacetime manifold, the local fields of orthonormal frames will also be denoted
by e, and the field of Witt bases by (Xi, y;).
D is the spin connection which corresponds naturally to the torsion-free pseudo-
riemannian connection .
The structural group of the pseudo-riemannian bundle will be assumed reducible
at least to the image group of Go, the elements of Go having spin norm 1. Then
there will exist a field of bilinear forms B which are invariant under the action of Go
and a field of hermitian sesquilinear forms 'H. naturally associated to B, in the sense
of Chapter 10, 4.
There exist Majorana spinors which are compatible with the action of G+(X).
If the manifold is also oriented, a spinor field is said to have a well-determined
chirality if ieN'l/J = 'l/J or ieN'l/J = - 'l/J , eN = e1e2e3e4j since eNf = - if :
and ieN'l/J = 'l/J is equivalent to
0:3 = 0:4 = 0 whereas ieN'l/J = -'l/J is equivalent to
0:1 = 0:2 = O. The chirality property is therefore equivalent to the existence of a
well-determined parity.

The conjugation spinor will be 'Yf = -iX2f = ed and C will be defined by
then C commutes with the action of G+, C2 = Id and C is globally defined since the
manifold is oriented. One easily verifies that
For the chosen conjugation, a spinor is of Majorana type if O!l = - &4 and 0!2 = -&3 '
A basis for the Majorana spinors is given by :
16.2
The Dirac equation and the associated quantities.
16.2.1
We consider the equation
(1)
m being a real constant; the factor i on the right-hand side can be justified as follows :
ifC'Ij; = 'Ij;,
C(ekDk'lj;) = Cep = -ep
and ep belongs to the Majorana spinor space defined by this property; this space can
be obtained from the space of spinors such that C'Ij; = 'Ij; using a multiplication by i
(d. Chapter 10, 3.7).
Indeed, C(ekDk'lj;) = -ekC(Dk'lj;) since eNek = -ekeNi the conjugation u] --. u'Yf
commutes with Dk (Proposition (15.1.9)) and Dk('·'11"'(2"'(3"'(4) = 0, since "'(1"'(2"'(3"'(4 can
be obtained from the fundamental tensor-spinors "'(1' "'(2' "'(3' "'(4 by a product which
corresponds to a contraction, and D commutes with contractions; D"'(i = 0 then
leads to
C(ekDk'lj;) = -ekDk(C'Ij;) = -ekDk'lj;.
Note that we have proved ekDk(C'Ij;) = miC('Ij;), so
Proposition 16.2.1 The Dirac equation is invariant under the conjugation C.
Let 'Ij; = alsl +a2s2 + a3s3 +a4s4 ' Assume for the moment that spacetime is the
Minkowski vector space E. A routine computation expresses (1) as the system :
8l a 4 +82a 3 +83a l +84a 4 = ma3,
81a 3 +82a 4 - 83a 2 - 84a 3 = -ma4,
8l a 2 +82a l - 83a3 +84a2 = -mal,
8l a l + 82a 2 + 83a 4 - 84a l = ma2,

where fA stands for a/auk, u1, u2, u3, u4 being the coordinates on E, u l the time
coordinate.
Consider, for instance, the case where the spinor 'I/; does not depend on the space
coordinates; (2) then splits in two independent systems :

and

If we set
'1/;1 = exp(mu1A)'I/;l(O),
'1/;2 = exp( -mu1A)'I/;2(0)
are the solutions of (3) and (4) which equal '1/;1(0) and '1/;2(0) for ul = O.
Now return to the general case of a spacetime manifold.
We will construct several tensor fields which physicists associate to the spinor
fields .
In doing so, we will rely on our results from Chapter 10, 4 and use the
antisymmetric bilinear forms Band Ewhich are invariant under Gt.

and the vector 'ljJ 0 '-P is isotropic if and only if
as can easily be verified using (8), i.e. if al = >'{31 and a2 = >'{32 or a3 =
J.L{33 and
a4 = J.L{34 . In particular, this happens when cp = 'ljJ, but the necessary and sufficient
condition is that 'ljJ+ = >.cp+ or 'ljJ- = >.cp- .
Proposition 16.2.2 'ljJ 0 cp is isotropic if and only one pair of chiral components is
identical up to a scalar factor. In particular, 'ljJ = cp is sufficient.
Remark.
We have that
Replacing B by 13, another operation a is obtained for which ufavf = vfauf and
Proposition (16.2.2) still holds.
Any bilinear form invariant under Gt is known to be of the form B1 = aB + b13
so, if X B stands for the vector 'ljJ 0 cp,
We have proved the
Proposition 16.2.3 For any bilinear form 8 1 = aB + b13 with a
-=J. b, the time
component of X B1 is a (positive or negative) definite bilinear form of the component
spinors.
Definition 16.2.1
~XBI is called a 'current' associated to the pair of spinors 'ljJ and
CPi it is denoted by J1('ljJ,cp). J('ljJ,cp) and i('ljJ,cp) correspond to 8 and 13.

THE DIRAC EQUATION.

From the Dirac equation we deduce that if 'Ij; and 'Ij;' are solutions for the coeffi-
cients m and m' :
!3('Ij;',e"'D",'Ij;) = mi!3('Ij;','Ij;),
!3(e"'D",'Ij;','Ij;) = m'i!3('Ij;','Ij;),
and adding both sides :
!3(e'"D",'if;', 'Ij;) + !3('Ij;', e'" D",'Ij;) = (m + m')i!3('Ij;', 'Ij;).
Introducing the fundamental tensor-spinor-y" associated to e"', and relying on f3( e"') =
e'",
!3(D",-y'lj;', 'if;) + !3(-y'lj;', D",'Ij;) = (m + m')i!3('Ij;', 'Ij;);
now since D!3 = 0,
D",(!3( e"''Ij;','Ij;)) = (m +m')i!3('Ij;','Ij;)
and the definition itself leading to 13(e"'11,1,11,'J) = (11,1 0 11,'J)'",
(9)
In particular, if'lj; = 'if;' or even if !3('if;','Ij;) = 0, for all choices of m, m' :

holding also if m = m' = O.
Considering Binstead of 13, one can prove in a similar way that
(11 )
(12)
so that if B('if;,,'Ij;) = 0 (which, as a matter of fact, is easily verified to be equivalent
to !3('if;', 'Ij;) = 0), (10) will hold for all currents J1('Ij;', 'if;).
Proposition 16.2.4 For all currents J1('Ij;', 'Ij;) such that !31('Ij;, ep) = 0, the conser-
vation law D",J! = 0 holds if 'Ij; and ep are solutions of the Dirac equation.
16.2.3
Sesquilinear vector-valued interaction operations.
We now want to replace the bilinear forms by hermitian sesquilinear ones naturally
associated to them by the procedure of Chapter 10, 4; the conjugation C will be the
product of the one used in Chapter 10,4, by eN = e1e2e3e4.
Let us define
11.1(C(11,J) ,vJ) = >.131(11,1,vJ),

Remarks.
In the first case, 'H(uj,vJ) = i13((CuJ),vJ) and if u.] and vj are
Majorana spinors, the remark in Chapter 10, 4 applies so that B(u], vJ) must be
real, which can easily be verified for 81, 82, 83, 84.
In the second case, H(u], vJ) = B(Ca], vJ) and H is pure imaginary for Majorana
spinors, which can again be verified for the (explicit) 81, 82, 83, 84 -
Also note that
'H(uj, xvJ) = 'H(-xuj, vJ),
H(uj, xvJ) = H(xuj,vJ)
and that!
H(Cuj,CvJ) = B(uj,CvJ) = -r3(Cvj,uJ),
H(Cuj,CvJ) = -H(uj,vJ).
Our aim is to construct, using 'HI, a sesquilinear extension of the operation 0,
denoted by 0, such that
'Hl(uj,xvJ) = >.Bl (Cuj , xvJ) = B(ujovj,x)
for all pairs (uj,vJ) E S x S and all z E E'. We will prove the

Proposition 16.2.5 The only sesquilinear extensions of the operation
0 (in the
sense of the preceding remark) are constructed using 'HI = kH, k E R , H defined

B(u+f
0 o: f +v+f 0 u-I, x)
and B(uf 0 v f, x) is only obtained for B .
?-l(uf, vI) = B(ufovI, x) for arbitrary u] and v f therefore does not make sense.
Now write
whereas
it(uf, xvI) =
it(xuf, vI) =
B(ufovf, x)
= it(vf, xuI)
=
B(vfouf,x)
=
B(vfouf,x)
since B is the extension of a real bilinear form. This gives
uf ou] = vfouf.

B('ljJeep, 'ljJeep) = B((C'ljJt, ep-)B((C'ljJ)+, ep+) = B(C'ljJ+, ep-)B(C'ljJ-,ep+).
B( 'ljJeep, 'ljJeep) = il('ljJ+, ep- )il('ljJ-,ep+).

Finally:
modulo an unimportant non-zero real factor, only one hermitian sesqui-
linear form, invariant under Gt allows the extension of the commutative operation

(14) can be used to easily verify that il is actually invariant under Go and that
the composition is equivariant.
Recall that Gt is the covering of the restricted Lorentz group and that Go is the

This form il allows the construction of the positive definite form ('ljJ 0 'ljJ)1, which
justifies its use by physicists in the Dirac theory.

The interaction operation for a positive definite sesquilinear form.
If we consider hermitian sesquilinear form which are invariant under a subgroup of
Gt, other sesquilinear interaction operations can be found . For example, let 1t+ be
invariant under the covering of the subgroup r which preserves a split of E into a
positive and a negative part. This construction was mentioned in Chapter 10.
Introduce a conjugation C such that

plexified Clifford algebra once an orthonormal basis is fixed.

This antisymmetric tensor is said to be the spin associated to the pair ('l/J, cp)2 . It
is only defined up ta a constant factor.
This spin can also be expressed in term of the pairwise orthogonal bases e3e4 +
iele2 = fl, e2e4 + iele3 = f2 and e2e3 + iele4 = f3 related to the complex formalism
(d. Chapter 8, 3.2), and their conjugate bases :

As we expected, th is tensor is pure imaginary when 'l/J = cp.
It vanishes identically if 'l/J = cp and if the spinor has a well-defined chirality.

A density tensor clearly can be constructed using the hermitian sesqui-

Definition 17.1.1 The quotient of the tensor algebra 0 (E ) by the two-sided ideal
N(F) generated by the elements

is called a common symplectic Glifford algebra (or a Weyl algebra).
If F = 0, we reobtain V(E ) (d. Chapter 2, 3). The quotient algebra will be
denoted by Cs(E, F) , often shortened to Cs(F).
Let PF be the canonical mapping 0 (E ) -+ 0 (E)/.N(F ) = Cs(F)j 0 (E ) being
generated by E, Cs(F) will be generated by PF(E) and we will see later that PF(E)

tben there exists a unique bomomorpbism u from Cs(F) to A such tbat u = u0 PF.
Proof. If it exits, u is unique since PF(E) generates Cs(F). u extends to a unique
homomorphism v from Q9(E) to A such that
From (2) it follows that v(x Q9 y - y Q9 x - F(x, y)) = 0, hence v vanishes on N(F)
and u is obtained by taking the quotient.

Let :1 be the two-sided ideal generated by the (x 0 y - y 0 x).
Proposition 17.1.1 >'F maps the ideal N(F) into:1 and defines an vector space
isomorphism from Cs(F) to V(E) .
Proof. Just as in Chapter 3, it is sufficient to prove that
The reasoning is similar to the orthogonal case.
Using the previous lemmas and
definition, one verifies that
>'F(x 0y-y0x-F(x,y))E :1.
Then for c = (x 0 y - y 0 x - F(x, y)) 0 b, >'F(C) E :1, and >'F(a 0 c) is computed,
assuming that >'F(C) E :1, starting with a = y E E .
All of these are routine computations.

Proposition (17.1.1) allows us to identify PF(a:) with a: E K and PF(X) with
z E E.
If (ei) is an ordered basis of E, i = 1,2, . . . ,n, the products (el)ClI(e2)Cl2 . .. (en)Cln
with a:i E N form a basis of Cs(F). Note that every element of Cs(F) is a finite
linear combination of elements of this basis .

Formula 7 applied to U E Cs(F) gives

where the product in Cs(F) is written as the juxtaposition of the factors .
Just as for Clifford algebras, there are two algebraic operations on V(E), identi-
fying >'F(v) with v E Cs(F), the second one is defined by
xu=xVu+jx'(u),
xEE,
uEV(E).
(9)
But just as in Chapter 3, the identifications are only linear and (9) gives a com-
putational algorithm rather than a definition. Note also that the creation and anni-
hilation operators generate a symplectic Clifford algebra which is isomorphic to an
endomorphism algebra of V(E) so that the situation is analogous to the orthogonal
case (cf. Chapter 3, 1.5).

Proposition 17.1.2 IfF and F' are two antisymmetric bilinear forms on the n resp.
n'-dimensional vector spaces E and E', there exists an isomorphism from Cs( F EEl F')
to Cs(F) ~ Cs(F').
Prooi The space E EEl E' is given the bilinear form F EEl F', extending the similar
definition in the orthogonal case (Chapter 8, 1.3). We set
u(x,x') = (x ~ 1) + (1 ~ x'),
x E E,
x' EE',
then u maps E EEl E' into Cs(F) ~ Cs(F') and it is easily verified that u satisfies
condition (2). Applying the universal property, there exists a homomorphism it from
Cs(F EEl F') to Cs(F) ~ Cs(F') which is an algebra homomorphism; u is surjective
since the x ~ 1 and 1 ~ x' generate Cs(F) ~ Cs(F'). But upon consideration of the
bases for these algebras, it is seen to be injective.
•
Remark.
1. The linear isomorphism >'F from V(E) to Cs(F) commutes with the action of
the symplectic group; this follows easily from formula (8), using induction.
2. The isomorphism >'F does not associate the elements (et}a, V (e2)a2V . . .V(en)a"
with (el)a'(e2)a2 .. . (en)a,,; for instance >'F(ele2) = el V e2 -
~ ' where n = 2
and F(el' e2) =
1 is assumed. The situation is more complicated than the
orthogonal case where >'B(ei, ei2 .. . eip ) = ei, 1\ ei2 1\ ... 1\ eip if the (ei) form
an orthonormal basis (cf. formula 8 in Chapter 3,1.5), >'B commutes with the
action of the orthogonal group.
3. To add a symmetric bilinear form to ~F does not invalidate Proposition (17.1.2)
or formula (8).
17.1.4
Proposition 17.1.3 If F is non-degenerate, the center of Cs(F) is K .
Proof. Choose a symplectic basis {ea,ef;l'}' the elements of Cs(F) which can be
expressed as linear combinations of products not involving ea' commute with ea'
Let u be an element of the center, u = Ul + V, v not containing any power of ea';
since Ul ea - eaUl = 0, if Ul contains a term in (ea.)k and since

bilinear form of rank 2r. Then from Proposition (17 .1.2) :
Proposition 17.1.4 The symplectic Clifford algebra Cs(F) is isomorphic to the

Enlarged symplectic Clifford algebras.
17.2.1
The Weyl algebras constructed in this way do not allow the construction of Clifford
groups and spin groups having properties similar to the orthogonal case. This caused
them to be treated as mathematical curiosities until a very recent date. In fact, they
were commonly defined using differential operators with constant coefficients. Now
we will construct new algebras that will fully generalize the Clifford algebras to the
symplectic case. These algebras are called 'enlarged symplectic Clifford algebras' and
their elements are infinite linear combinations of the products (el )a,(e2)a2

used for Cs(F). Such sums will have a formal or a non-formal meaning, depending
on the introduction of convergence conditions.
It will be convenient to introduce an antisymmetric bilinear form hF, which is a
non-degenerate symplectic form, h will either be an indeterminate or a constant in
K which we will call Planck's constant.
Definition 17.2.1 If H = K[[h]] is the algebra of formal power series in the inde-
terminate h, with coefficients in K, let
EH = E ~ K[[h]] .
EH is a free module over K[[h]] (and an infinite-dimensional vector space over K)
called the Planck module.

17.2.2
The formal symplectic Clifford algebras.
Henceforth we assume that G has maximal rank n = 2r. EH is given the symplectic
form hF. We define the algebra Cs(hF) in the same way as Cs(F). Nothing essential
must be changed; we reobtain the same results (such as the universal property, the
linear isomorphism with V(EH) and the trivial center).
It will also be useful to define an enlarged algebra, rather than to consider each
element as a finite linear combination of generators (el)Q:l(e2)Q:2 . . . (en)"''' , Qi EN.
We consider formal power series with coefficients in K[[h)) and, since formula (12) is
now expressed by
(ei)k(ej)1
=
(ej)l(ei)k + hlkF(ei,ej)(ej)l-l(ei)k-l +
.
+(h)P(F(ei,ej))pCrCrp!(ej)'-P(ei)k-p +
.
(1)
it will be convenient to consider h as a indeterminate of degree 2.
Let us call this module over K[[h)J, Cs(hF).
Proposition 17.2.1 Cs(hF) is an associative algebra.
Proof. It is sufficient to verify that the product of two elements in Cs(hF) is again
an element of Cs(hF). The rest is obvious.
Proposition (17.1.2) still holds for Cs(hF) and allows us to consider a two-
dimensional space and elements
where (el' e.-) is a symplectic basis and the ak and bk are formal power series in h
(the other cases either are trivial or can be reduced to this case).
The coefficient in K of hP( el)1(el.)k in the expansion of ii:v comes, by (1), from :
1 1
ak+·bl+.
k!l!(akbl-hak+lbl+l+ . .. +(-h)"

+...)
and, in fact, from the coefficient of hPin akbl, the coefficient of hP- l in ak+lbl+l, . . .,
of hP-' in ak+.bk+.i so from a finite number of terms, since 5 S p.
I
This also ensures that the definition of Cs(hF) does not depend on the basis.
The universal property, the isomorphism with an enlarged symmetric algebra and
the center are still as before and can be proved in the same way.
Definition 17.2.2 The elements ofCs(hF) are called symplectic formal series (or
s.f.s. for short).
h being considered as a indeterminate of degree 2, the total degree of a monomial
in h, el, e2, . .. ,en is invariant for any change of basis, as can be verified using (1). The
formal series can therefore be considered as series with coefficients in K constructed
on 2r + 1 indeterminates (ei) and h. This convention allows us to formulate :

240
CHAPTER 17
Definition 17.2.3 The total order w(u) of u =I 0 is the smallest integer q ~ 0 such
that the homogeneous part of degree q does not vanish .
Then, just as in a commutative algebra :
w(u+v) ~ min(w(u),w(v)),
(u +v =I 0),
w(uv) ~ w(u)+ w(v).
Proposition 17.2.2 (Substitution principle.) If the X; are symplectic formal series
with vanishing constant term and f(el' e2,. . . , en, h) is a symplectic formal series,
then f(Xl, X 2 , •• . , X n , h) is also a symplectic formal series.
Proof. If k + I is fixed, only a finite number of terms make up the right-hand side
of (1); when the products are ordered, each coefficient can be obtained from a finite
number of terms.
I
Proposition 17.2.3 A symplectic formal series is invertible if and only if its con-
stant term in K is non-zero.
Proof. Apply the substitution principle to the inverse of 1 - X i'
I
17.2.3
The truncated formal symplectic Clifford algebras.
Consider the quotient II of the algebra K[h] of polynomials in H by the ideal of
multiples of hP, P being a fixed integer (p ~ 2). II is a p-dimensional algebra over K
and its general element is given by
p-l2: aihi,
ai E K,
h = CI(h)(mod hP ) .
i=O
The II-module E ® II, also denoted by Ea, is free and has an (np)-dimensional
v
vector space structure over K. It is called a truncated Planck module. Cs(hF)p (also
written 6s(hF)) is the Clifford algebra obtained by the same procedure as before, it
still has the properties proved in 1.3 : given an ordered basis of E, its elements are
truncated symplectic formal series (t .s.f.s.). They can also be considered as formal
series with coefficients in K in the indeterminates el, e2, . . . ,en, h. Nothing needs to
be changed in the definition of the total order w, and both Propositions (17.2 .2) and
(17.2.3) still hold. Note that in the right-hand side of (1) at most p terms can occur
in any case.
Proposition 17.2.4 If P2 > PI, there exists a natural homomorphism m p 2P1 from

Cs(hF)P2 to Cs(hF)Pl'

241
Proof. More precisely, if H(p) is the quotient H modulo hP , there exists a homomor-
phism from the algebra H(P2) to the algebra H(p.) .
A linear homomorphism from
E R(P2) to ER(pll can be derived from it, this is a linear homomorphism u from ER(P2)
v
to GS(hJ)Pl such that:
u(x) *Pl u(y) - u(y) *Pl u(x) = (h)Pl F(x, y),
x,Y E ER(P2);
indeed, as in the proof of the Fundamental Theorem (17.1.2), u is extended to v from
v
@( E R(P2») to Gs(hF)Pll where
V(XI @ X2 @ . . . @ Xh) = u(xd *Pl U(X2) *Pl . . . *Pl U(Xh),
v(x @ Y - Y @ x - (h)P2F(X,y)) = u(x) *Pl u(y) - u(y) *Pl u(x) - (h)Pl F(x, y) = o.
from which we find ii, taking the quotient, and m P2 P1 = ii.
Corollary 17.2.1 The set of homomorphisms
I

defines a projective system of mappings and associative algebras with limit Cs(hF).
17.2.4
The formal symplectic Clifford algebras over K((h)).
Now the ring K[[h]) is replaced by the field consisting of its rational fractions, mean-
ing that in the expansions of Clifford elements a finite number of negative exponents
of h are allowed. The elements of K((h)) will also be called formal series in hand
the new algebra will still be denoted by Cs(hF) (abusively).
An arbitrary symplectic basis {ea , e{3'} being chosen , the general element of this
algebra is called a symplectic formal series and its general term it is of the form
where the hi and ki are positive or zero integers. Symbolically, we will write
•
'"

where the H, K* stand for multi-indices and the AHK' are formal power series in
K(h)).
Symplectic spinors for Cs(hF).
Consider the quotient of the algebra Cs(hF) by
the left ideal Jm generated by the (ea')' when a symplectic basis {ea,ea'} has been
chosen. The elements of Jm are of the form L AHK.eJ eK', where K* is non-empty.
The representation of Cs(hF) in this quotient space is defined by left multiplication;

242
CHAPTER 17
the space of this representation will be written Cs(hF)'P* (by analogy with the
orthogonal case), 'P* being just a symbol resembling the isotropic r-vector of the
orthogonal case. The space Cs(hF)'P* is called the space of symplectic spinors. A
change of symplectic basis gives rise to an equivalent representation.
Note that the space Cs(hF)'P* is linearly isomorphic to the symmetric algebra
on the vectors (e1, e2, . . . , er ) .
The following proposition justifies this terminology :
Proposition 17.2.5 The representation of Cs( hF) in Cs( hF)'P* by left multiplica-
tion is irreducible.
Proof. Indeed, the left ideal Jm is maximal, for if an element u = L AHeH is added
to it, the multiplication table (11) of 1.4 shows that, h being invertible, 1 will be an
element of the resulting ideal, which must therefore coincide with the whole algebra.
Jm being maximal, the representation is irreducible by the results in Chapter 5.
I
Proposition 17 .2.6 In a sense that will specified later, the algebra Cs(hF) with
coeflicients in K((h)) is simple.
Proof. We use induction on the dimension of E to prove the existence of a set of
maximal left ideals with zero intersection.
Assume that dim E = 2 and choose the ordered symplectic bases (e1' e1') and
(-ep, ed. The corresponding minimal left ideals are
J1 = {u = Lk,l Akl(el)k( el·)I,
J2 = {u = Lk,ltLkl(e1')k(e1)',
1 ~ 1,
l ~ 1,
Ak,l E K((h))},
tLk,l E K((h))} .
If v = Lk.1 Okl(e1)k(el')" l ~ 1 is an element of J1nJ2, 001= 0 since if v = L 00,(Cl')"
we see, expressing it in the basis (-el" e1), that it cannot be an element of J2 unless
it vanishes. But for k = a # 0 given, Oal = 0 since, multiplying v from the left with
(e1.)a the multiplication table of the first basis (e1, e1') creates in (e1')av E J1n J2
terms in Oal(ep)l, up to a non-zero coefficient, and this implies Oal = O.
If dimE = n = 2r and (el, . .. ,er,ep, . . . ,er . ) is a symplectic basis for E, we
consider the maximal left ideals :
r
J~ = L Cs(hJ)ea . ,
a=1
Ordering the basis as follows :
r
J~ = Cs(hF)e1 + L Cs(hF)ea • .
a=2
an element of J{ n J~ is either of the form
u =L Akl(e1)k(ep)1 +U/,

or of the form
U=EJLkl(el')k(ed+u",
i :
1,
k,l
243
where >'kl and JLkl are coefficients which contain no powers of el or el' and commute
with el and ep ; u' and u" contain no factor in el or el•. The same reasoning as when
n = 2 proves that >'kl = JLH = O. The problem is then reduced to n - 2 dimensions
and the induction hypothesis can be applied.
So there exists a set Jm1, Jm2, . .. , Jmk of maximal left ideals with zero intersection.
Let !Pm. be the canonical homomorphism :
IT(!Pm.) is an injective homomorphism from (:s( hF) to TI(Jm.) since
implies that u' - u E Jm • for all Jm • •
Jm • being maximal, Jm • is simple and TI(Jm .) is said to be semisimple, just as its
inverse image under TI(!Pm.)'
The Jm • are left ideals which are naturally associated to symplectic bases; there
exists a symplectic transformation sending one of these bases to another one , and this
symplectic transformation defines a representation equivalence. All simple modules
obtained in this fashion are isomorphic, and such an algebra is said to be simple", I
Remark.
All two-sided ideals of (:s(hF) are trivial. If J is a two-sided ideal and if
u E J, consider a minimal term for the lexicographical ordering of the ea and ecr.. ' If
it is >'HK. eH eK• (where there is no summation), a left multiplication by eH" followed
by a right multiplication by eK produces an element of J with a non -zero term of
degree O. This element is invertible and J must be trivial.
17.2.5
Large non-formal symplectic Clifford algebras.
h is considered here as a real or complex parameter. Using the notations of formula
(2), we choose, after a certain rank,

Condition (3) is independent of the chosen symplectic basis.
By elementary
convergence rules, it can be verified that an algebra over K is obtained; we will

245
If a = 0, the convergence of (4) requires an upper bound for p(u). The series in (4)
converges if sup(p(u), p(v)) < 1/ V2h; if h is Planck's constant, this upper bound is
of the order of 1013 in C.G.S. units, hence it is very large.
17.2.7
Clifford, toroplectic and spinoplectic groups.
Definition 17.2.4 The subgroup of invertible elements -y E Cs(hF) such that for
all x E E H , -yX-y-1 E E H is called the formal symplectic Clifford group G:J.
We immediately see that G:I is a group, that -y -t pb) where pb)(x) = -yX-y-1 is a
homomorphism from G:I to Sp(2r, K[[h]]), the group of K[[h]]-linear isomorphisms
a from EH such that F(ax,ay) = F(x,y), x,y E EH , and that the kernel of p is the
set K[[hW of invertible elements in K[[h]].
Proposition 17.2.7 The exponential elements exp(ta2 ) , t E K[[h]], a E E H are
elements of G:I and satisfy
Proof. Obvious.
p(exp ta2 )x = x + 2hF(a,x)ta.
(8)
I
When K = R or C, we consider h either as an indeterminate or as an element in
K. h can be replaced by h E K if the indeterminate h is given a numerical value in
K, but the notation h will be avoided when this will not cause confusion. Similarly,
any expression in which h is replaced by h will be written with a hat.
Set p(exp ta 2 ) ( z ) = z +2hF( a, x)ta, if t E K, a E E, a symplectic transveetion is
obtained on the right-hand side (Chapter 1, 4.1); we know that the symplectic group
Sp(2r, K) is generated by the set of symplectic transvections.
Note that a formal
algebraic identity allows us to write
where a = F( a, b), giving rise to a convergent scalar factor if h is replaced by h.
This leads us to the following :

246
Definition 17.2.5 The quotient of the subgroup of elements
CHAPTER 17
in Gff by the subgroup of elements 1+u, u E K[[hll is called the symplectic Clifford
group c».
The following sequence is exact :
1 -t K* -t Gs ~ Sp(2r, K) -t 1.
(9)
Since Sp(2r, K) is connected, it is generated by an arbitrarily small neighborhood
of the identity, hence every element of Sp(2r, K) is a finite product of elements u
such that Ip(u)1 < 1/1ii from 2.6 will be satisfied in the non-formal case.
Definition 17.2.6 (Symplectic spin norm.) Let K = C and write G'ff and G's for
the corresponding groups. We use the main antiautomorphism f3 of the symplectic
Clifford algebra, for which f3IEI = i Id, (E' being the vector space under considera-
tion) and define the spin norm N(T) by N(T) = f3(Th .
Obviously if , E G'ff,
N(T) = f3(Th E C[[h],

N(T,') = N(T)N(T'),

E G's, taking the quotient ensures that N(T) E C* (replacing h by h where
necessary in the computation of f3(,h).
The toroplectic (or metapleetic) group. If E' is the complexification of a real
symplectic space E , of real dimension n = 2r, and if G's is its symplectic Clifford
group, the subgroup of elements, E G's such that ,X,-l E E, Vx E E,
with
IN(T)I = 1 (or, if one prefers, IAr(T)1 = 1) is called the toroplectic (or metaplectic)
group, denoted by Mp(r).
The following sequence is exact :
1 -t 51 -t Mp(r) -t Sp(2r,R) -t 1.
(10)
The spinoplectic group.
Under the same conditions as before, if N(T) = 1 is
required, a group SP2 is obtained for which the following sequence is exact :
(11 )
The clear analogy would motivate the name of 'symplectic spin group' for this
group; but we will see later on that there exist groups for which Z2 in the exact
sequence is replaced by Zq and Z, so we should specify this and call it a spin group
of order 2; we will use the name 'spinoplectic' for it.

17.2.8
247
In this paragraph, we will prove that Gs and the derived groups are Lie groups. We
will initially assume that K = R, that h is a real indeterminate and that E is a real
(n = 2r)-dimensional space with complexification E'. It is well-known that an elliptic
metric (-,.) can be defined on E, along with an R-linear orthogonal endomorphism
for this metric, denoted by J, such that j2 = - Id and (Jx, y) = F(x, y). Then
F(Jx,Jy) = F(x ,y) and J is simultaneously symplectic and orthogonal.
Let us decompose E' as the direct sum of two complex conjugate subspaces [1
and £2 with bases (fa) and (fa')' a = 1,2, . . . ,r, satisfying
(fa,f(3) = (fa.,f(3') = 0,
(fa,f(3') = Oa(3.
F(fa,f(3) = F(fa·,f(3.) = 0, F(fa,f(3.) = iOa(3'
The fa and ee- form a 'real' Witt basis for the metric of E' .
JI£l = i Id,
JI£2 = -i Id,
Jfa = ifa ,
Jfa • = -ifa •
Je; = ea',
Je a • = -ea'
If we define ea = (fa' +fa)/.;2, ea' = (fa' -fa)/(i.;2), the (ea, e(3.) form a symplectic
and orthogonal basis of E . We will write E = E1 Ef) E2 , ea EEl, ea' E E2 . Every
element of Sp(2r, R) which commutes with J will be called unitary; the group U(r)
is the set of all elements in SO(2r) which commute with J ; U(r) is the pairwise
intersection of the groups Sp(2r, R), SO(2r) and GL(r, C).
If Gs contains a local Lie group r, r is endowed with a smooth manifold structure
and contains the neutral element 1; 9 E r
-+ g-l E r will be a Coo map and
is .s') -+ gg' will be a Coo mapping from an open set U x U in r x I' to / . The
Lie algebra r. of this local group will contain the elements a2 , Va E E, this being
the tangent to t -+ exp ta 2 at t = OJ I' will contain exp( -sb2 ) exp(ta2)exp(sb2 ) for
sufficiently small sand t, hence r. will contain exp( -sb2)a2 exp(sb2 ) obtained when t
varies; now letting s vary, r. must contain a2b2 - b2a2 = 4hF(a, b)ab- 2h2(F(a, b))2,
and since r. must also contain the tangent to t -+ exp At, A E R, it must be the Lie
subalgebra of terms of degree 0 and 2, in the symplectic Clifford algebra.
Lemma 17.2.1 For all a E E, exp(ta2) E Cs(hF)o ift is small enough.
Proof. If {ea, e{3"} is a symplectic basis, we write a = L~(>.aea +{Laea')' Aa, {La E R

us to consider the case n = 2 first . Let us determine the coefficient of (ed( el')j in

By the results of section 2.5, when
Ct = 0, exp ta2 and exp tb2 also belong to
Cs(hF)o for sufficiently small t and s. From the formal algebraic identity :
we formally deduce that
exp(-b2)a2exp(b2) = exp(a2b2 - b2a2) = exp(4hF(a, b)ab)exp(-2h2(F(a, b)?),
so that exp( tab) also belongs to Cs( hF)o if t is sufficiently small.

250
CHAPTER 17
As we recalled at the beginning of this paragraph, there exist bases of E which
are simultaneously orthogonal and symplectic and the isomorphism of Cs(F) and the
symmetric algebra induces on Cs(F)o the euclidean structure of E, independently of
the basis choice; so this defines the topological structure of a normed space on the
vector space Cs(hF)o.
Lemma 17.2.2 There exists a neigbborbood of 0 wbicii is injectively mapped into
Cs(hF)o by ibe exponential map.
Proof. This follows from Lemma (17.2.1), from its consequences and from a standard
result concerning the exponential map.
•
Lemma 17.2.3 Gs contains a local Lie group r witb Lie algebra L.
Proof. By a general result, there exists a local Lie group generated by L; this group
can be identified, using Lemma (17.2.2), to the group generated by the expta2 for
sufficiently small t, since this Lie group is obtained by the so-called Hausdorff con-
struction.
•
Proposition 17.2.8 Gs has a Lie group structure.
Proof. It is sufficient to apply Proposition 118, page 112 of Bourbaki's Groupes et
Algebres de Lie, cbapitres 2 et 3 (Hermann, Paris, 1972) which, in our notations,
says :
If Gs is a group and if, in tbe local Lie group r contained in Gs, an open set
U containing the identity e can be found, sucb tbat it bas an analytic manifold
structure, and if V is an open set in U sucb tbat V = V-I, V2 ~ U and
1. (x, y) -+ xy-1 is analytic from V x V to U
2. vs E Gs there exists an open neighborhood VI of e, VI ~ V, witb gVlg-l ~ U
and such that x -+ gxg- 1 is analytic from VI to U
tben Gs has a Lie group structure.
Formula (12) yields for X, Y E L that

(13)
so ad being continuous in L, II ad(Y)(X) 11 ::::; Mllxlillyll, M being a constant, if Y is
fixed, setting ex = MIIYII, the norm of E(l/n!)(ad y)n(x) is bounded by IIXIIexp ex
and X can be chosen so small (X E V ~ U) as to ensure that the right-hand side
is in r and arbitrarily close to the identity.
Since 9 E Gs is a finite product of
exponential elements, if X E L is close enough to 0, 9 exp X s:' will be arbitrarily
close to e.

Lemma 17.2.4 Tbe projection p from Os to Sp(n, R) and I E Os -t N(-y) E C·
are Coo .
Proof. Invoking a classical result on homomorphisms it is sufficient to prove that p
is continuous.
By a remark made previously, we can note that every element of Os can be
expressed as a finite product of elements in the local group I', which can even be
assumed of the form exp ta 2 , a E E, but :
p(exp ta 2 ) ( x) = x + 2hF(a, x )ta
and the result follows at once.
The property of N(-y) is trivial since N(exp ta 2 ) = 1.
•
Corollary 17.2.2 The groups Mp(r) and Sp2(r) are topological Lie subgroups of
O~ and Os respectively.
Using the notations of the beginning of this paragraph, we have the
Proposition 17.2.9 Pexp(t La €a€a') induces x -t exp( -iht)x on C1 and x -t
exp(iht )x on C2 .

Proof. It is sufficient to explicit a condition for real-valuedness, to note that faee,
commutes with L"Y f-yf"Y' and to invoke Corollary (17.2 .2).
I
We will prove later on that this image is equal to U(r).
Proposition 17.2.11 The spinoplectic group Sp2(r) is a connected group and a
non-trivial double covering of Sp(2r, R).
Proof. We must only prove the existence of a continuous path from (-1) to (+1)
in SP2(r) . Consider t --t exp( -rit/2) exp((t/ h) L fafa') = o(t) ; this is a continuous
path of spin norm 1, 0(0) = 1, 0(27r) = exp(-i7l")exp«271"/h)Lfafa')'
If r is odd, po 0(271")
Id and by Corollary (17.2 .3), 0(271") =
±1 , but by
continuity,
(16)
271" '"
exp( h
L...J fa€a') = 1
(this also follows from an easy direct computation), so that 0(271") = -l.
If r is even, we use induction on the dimension of E, E = E1 EB E2 being a direct
symplectic sum, we take 01(t) inducing the identity on E1 and 02(t) as o(t) above;
then the induction hypothesis reduces the problem to the odd-dimensional case .
I
Remark.
From this it follows easily that Mp(r) is connected (this is also a conse-
quence of a general result : Sp(2r, R) and 51 are connected, hence so is their quotient
Mp(r)).
Proposition 17.2.12 The Lie algebra Mp(r) of Mp(r) has a basis formed by the
(ed2 and eiej , i < j , where the e., i = 1~ . ,2r are an arbitrary basis of E , and it
is a Lie sub-algebra of Cs(hF) with the bracket [u, v] = uv - vu .
Proof. Note that if ad u(x) = ux - xu, u E Cs(hF ), x E E, ad u(x) E E if and only if
u is the sum of terms of degree 0 and 2, ad u lies in the Lie algebra of the symplectic
group,

The elements ad(ei)2, ad(eie;), i < i, are linearly independent over R, so because
of the dimension of Sp(2r, R), they form a basis for the Lie algebra of the symplectic
group, the kernel of pis R* in Gs and 51 in Mp(r}, The result follows.
I
Remark.
The Lie algebra of Sp2(r) is the quotient Lie algebra of Mp(r) by R :
the r(2r + 1) elements (ei)2, e.e], i < i , do not form a basis for that algebra (since
a bracket gives rise to elements of R).
Writing E' = Ee , we see that the fa€{3, fa' €{3', 0 ~ {3, fa f{3, , 1, form a basis for the
complexified Lie algebra of Mp(r). The elements of Mp(r) aij€i€j

Proof. The €a€fJ.

surjective; finally, the spin norm is taken into account.

Corollary 17.2.4 Spir) is generated by the elements of the form
where the Ct.;; are real, ei is a basis for E, i
:::; j and no summation occurs on i

conditions.
Proof. This follows from the connectedness of these groups and from their Lie alge-

Lemma 17.2.5 Mp'(r) being obtained from E' = Ec in a similar way as Mp(r)
from E, the subgroup Gi of elements in Mp'(r) which fix all points of £i, i = 1,2, is
generated by the exp(u), u E C ED V 2£;.
Proof. The set of these u gives rise to a commutative Lie subalgebra of Mp'(r)
and exp(u) clearly fixes all points of £i; conversely each element of OS(hF) which
commutes with all elements of £; is a formal series in the €a if i = 1 or in the Ea. if
i = 2.
I
It is obvious that
Mp'(r) = GL(r, C) ED G~ +G;,
where Gi is the connected group generated by the exp(u) for u E C ED V2£i; we
note that GL(r, C) ED mis a Lie subalgebra of Mp'(r) and that mis one of its
ideals . Therefore
G~ is normal in the subgroup generated by the exponentials of
GL(r, C) ED G~.
The elements of Mp(r) are products of exponentials of elements in !l(r),
G~,
G~, so the consequence of Lemma (17.2.5) allow us to consider products where the
exponentials of elements of U(r) come first.

since the exponential is surjective on compact or on abelian Lie groups.
An analogous reasoning shows that
This decomposition which, in this form, is necessarily unique, is a Cartan decompo-
sition, U(r) being a maximal compact subgroup of Sp2(r). Therefore, summarizing :
{
a = exp( -ih E ao.o.· /2) exp(ao.{3· f.o.f.{3' ),
ao.{3· = a{3o.· ,
Tl = exp(ao.{3eo.e{3),
T2 = exp(ao.·{3· eo..e{3')'
(18)
where ao.{3 and ao.·(3· are real and summations should be carried out.
From [ao.{3· f.o.f.(3"
f.-y] = -ihao.-y·f.o. we deduce that det(p(a)) = exp(ih E ao.o.·), if
p operates in the space £2 of the f.o."
The scalar coefficient in the decomposition of a is therefore a square root of the
determinant of p(o') (when h is replaced by h) and has a geometric meaning. This
remark should be compared with an often used method for the construction of a
double covering group of the symplectic group.
17.2.9
The q-fold covering of the symplectic group and its universal cov-
ering.
For I
E Sp2(r), I = exp(iO)f£ where eip(iO) = (N(J-L))-1/2, - meaning that h is
replaced by h in its argument. This suggests the more general definition : consider
the set of elements of Mp(r) of the form

then using the consequences of Lemma (17.2.5) it is easy to see that these elements
form a closed subgroup of Mp(r), with general term 1= exp(iO)J-L satisfying
Tbis subgroup is called a symplectic spin group of order q (or spinoplectic of
order s) and is denoted by Spq(r).
Proposition 17.2.14 Spq(r) is a non-trivial q-fold covering of tbe symplectic group.
Proof. If p(J-Lexp(iO)) = Id, necessarily p.eip(iO) E Sl, taking E ao.o.· = -2k7r/h
and relying on (16), we see that the q elements exp(27rki/q) are in the kernel of the
restriction of p to Spq(r). It is easily seen that these are the only elements in the
kernel (which, therefore, is isomorphic to Zq). The connectedness of these groups is
proved as for Sp2(r).
I

SYMPLECTIC CLIFFORD ALGEBRAS.
255
Finally, the universal covering of Sp(2r, R) is defined by considering the subgroup
of elements of Mp(r) of the form
exp( i(}) exp( aa{3' EaE{3' )T1 T2
for which ,,£aaa'h/(} is rational. It is denoted by Spoo(r). Details are left to the
reader.
The kernel is isomorphic to Z.
The notation SPq(r) will stand for any
symplectic spin group, q = 2,3, . . . ,00 .
17.2.10
The Heisenberg group.
The elements of E and R form a (2r + I)-dimensional Lie algebra H. Using the
exponential, a connected Lie group with multiplication
exp(x + t) exp(x' + t') = exp(x + x' + t + t' + ~hF(x, x'))
is defined. This is the Heisenberg group. Usually, h = 1.

Chapter 18
SYMPLECTIC SPINOR BUNDLES-THE MASLOV
INDEX.
18.1
The symplectic Clifford bundle of an almost symplectic manifold.
18.1.1
In this chapter, V is a smooth real manifold, of dimension n = 2r, paracompaet
and endowed with an almost symplectic structure defined by a field F of alternating
bilinear forms of maximal rank n = 2r in every point. If dF = 0, V is a symplectic
manifold.
It is equivalent to state that V has an almost complex structure (d .
Chapter 14, 3.2); to an almost complex structure there always corresponds an almost
hermitian structure. Such a manifold is known to be orientable.
F will also stand for the 2-form of the standard real symplectic space E.
The Weyl algebra of V can be defined by an adaptation of Defini tion (14.1.1), but
in each point x E V an infinite-dimensional vector space is obtained, which is linearly
isomorphic to the symmetric algebra of the space Tx(V). Propositions (14.1.1) and
(14.1.2) can immediately be adapted.
The definition of the Weyl algebra bundle of V is obvious; this bundle is linearly
isomorphic to the symmetric algebra bundle V(T( V )).
Note that two frames which are related by a symplectic transformation define,
by AF, the same linear isomorphism between the Weyl algebra and the symmetric
algebra; this should be compared with the crucial analogous remark in the orthogonal
case.
18.1.2
We generalize the notion of Weyl algebra bundle to that of symplectic Clifford bundle,
both in the formal and in the non-formal sense.
In the first case the fibers are
isomorphic to Cs(hF), in the second case to some Cs(hF)a-we noted that formula
(3) in Chapter 17, 2.5 has a meaning which is independent of any choice of basis .
It is very important to note that the fundamental group of the principal bundle of
256

SYMPLECTIC SPINOR BUNDLES.
257
frames in T(V) is reducible to the unitary (compact) group U(r), a subgroup of the
orthogonal group.
Any subbundle of the symplectic Clifford bundle will be called an amorphic spin
subbundle if for all x E V its fiber is a minimal left ideal of the formal symplectic
Clifford fiber.
Sufficient conditions for the existence of such subbundles are easily found :
1. There exists a global field of maximal totally isotropic subspaces for F : such
a subbundle is called lagrangian for T(V).
2. The complex subbundle determined by T(V), which, as we know, defines an
amorphic orthogonal spinor bundle over V with an almost hermitian struc-
ture, also determines an amorphic symplectic spinor bundle, by the properties
recalled at the beginning of 2.8 in Chapter 17. This bundle lies in the complex-
ified Clifford bundle and is determined by a complex lagrangian subbundle.
Definition 18.1.1 A Sp2(r) spinor structure (called 'spinoplectic') is said to exist
on V if a principal bundle TJ with group Sp(r) and a principal morphism h from TJ to
the principal bundle ( of sym plectic frames can be found .
Since the group Sp]r) is not compact, the structural group reduces to the double
covering of U(r), i.e. the group He of elements a of the form
a = exp(-ih Lao",,' /2) exp( a°{J' )EoE{J"
a°{J' = a{Jo' (Proposition (17.1.13)). (He is isomorphic to the subgroup of elements
9 E Spin(Q) such that 9f = exp(iO)f, using the notations for orthogonal spinors).
U(r) being a subgroup of SO(2r, R), we see that if there exists a spinoplectic
structure, there must exist an orthogonal spinor structure, in the strict sense of
Definition (14.2.2), but with group Spin(Q) since V is orientable.
An existence condition for such a structure is therefore given by Proposition
(14.3.2).
Because V is orientable and its orthogonal spinor structure is of group Spin(Q),
there exists a field of isotropic r-vectors which completely determines the complex
structure of the tangent bundle. Take as standard spinor space the quotient of the
(complexified) algebra CS(hF) by the left ideal J:" generated by the (Eo') ; this space
will be denoted by CS(hF)if!* (to resemble the notation used for the orthogonal
spinors). SP2(r) acts naturally by left multiplication on this space and in an effective
way, since all two-sided ideals ofthe algebra are trivial, and Sp2(r) generates Ct(hF).
To the principal bundle." with group Sp2(r) we can associate a spinoplectic bundle
( with a fiber which is isomorphic to CS(hF)if!*, SP2(r) acting by left multiplication
on the fiber.

258
CHAPTER 18
Definition 18.1.2 Every local or global section of the vector bundle ( of typical
fiber as( hF)~· and structural group SP2(r), associated to the spinoplectic principal
bundle will be called a symplectic spinor on V .
Definition 18.1.3 There exists a metaplectic (or, better, toroplectic) structure on
V if a principal bundle "11 with group Mp(r) and a principal morphism h from "11 to
the principal bundle ~ of symplectic frames can be constructed.
Just as in Definition (18.1.1), Mp(r) will reduce to its subgroup p-l(U(r)); Mp(r)
occurring as S1 xz, Sp2(r) will reduce to a group isomorphic to S1 xz, He' i.e. a
torogonal group (Chapter 14, 4.1). Therefore the notion of toroplectic structure can
be identified with the notion of torogonal structure naturally associated to the almost
hermitian structure (Chapter 14, 3.2).
Finally, still relying on Chapter 14, 4.3, this metaplectic structure is the equiva-
lent of what we called, at the beginning of this paragraph, an amorphic symplectic
spinor bundle determined by the complex lagrangian bundle related to the complex
structure of the tangent bundle. Such a structure therefore always exists over the
manifold V .
Remark.
As in the orthogonal case, care must be taken to distinguish between the
notion of amorphic spinor and that of a spinor corresponding to a spinor structure
over V . On the typical fiber of amorphic spinors we consider the action of the sym-
plectic group, not that of a spinoplectic group. The action of the symplectic group
is consistent with the conditions of (17.2.5), the non-formal viewpoint is therefore
allowed for the amorphic bundles.
18 .1.3
Symplectic pure spinors.
By the conventions of Chapter 17, 2.4, we can also define 'right' symplectic spinors,
the space of right spinors constructed using the right ideal generated by the (ea ) will
be denoted by ~as(hF) . In general, using the symplectic basis {eallet!i}' we will
define the real spinor spaces if!1as(hF) and as(hF)~r . These definitions carryover
to the complex case; if (fa, ft!.) is the basis derived from the (ea , et!") as in subsection
17.2.8, we will denote by as( hF)~· and ~aS(hF) the associated spaces of complex
symplectic spinors.
Note that the spinoplectic structures naturally induce the complex case, not the
real case.
Proposition 18.1.1 The intersection of a space of right symplectic spinors and
a space of left symplectic spinors is one-dimensional, both in the real and in the
complex case.
('intersection' stands here for 'double class'.)

Proposition 18.1.2 There exists a hermitian sesquilinear form H on the space of
complex symplectic spinors CS(hF)if.>· defined by
(1)
where ,BIEI = i Id (Chapter 17, 1.2). H is invariant under the action of the group
Sp2(r).
Proof. We have a pure spinor and H( uif.>·, vif.>·) is the conjugate of H( vif.>· ,uif.>·). Note
that if u is homogeneous, ,B(u) = (-1 )degu,B(u) and from the multiplication table

(Ea)'(Eao)k - hilk(Ea)l-l(Eao)k-l +

it follows that
H(EHif.>· ,EHif.>.) = H!(h)IHI,
H(EHif.>·,EKif.>.) = 0
where EH is analogous to the eH introduced in Chapter 17 and h is treated as a real
variable.
The basis EHe-/JH!( h)IHI is therefore orthonormal. In the non-formal case, for
the algebra Cs(hF)a, we get convergent series which define a pre-Hilbert norm on
Cs(hF)aif.>·. The invariance of H under the action of Sp2(r) follows at once from the
condition on the spin norm.
I
Consequence. If there exists a spinoplectic structure on V, there also exists a field
of hermitian sesquilinear forms.
Then the local construction of H is global.

The three-sided inertial cocycle and the Maslov index.
18.2.1
The three-sided inertial index.
We start with purely algebraic considerations. E is an (n = 2r )-dimensional vector
space with the symplectic form F; a lagrangian space is maximal totally isotropic
for F .

CHAPTER 18
Lemma 18.2.1 Let L, L', L" be three lagrangian spaces such that L n L' = L n L",
then there exist (in general, non-unique) s E Sp(2r, R) fixing all elements of Land
mapping L' onto L".
Proof. Let (ea , ep.) be a symplectic basis for E whose vectors (es) lie in L. Then
clearly s is expressed by :
(1)
We may assume that the ea were chosen such that (el' e2, ... ,e,\) generate LnL'; then
e'\+l, .. . , er , ep, . . . , e>.. generate a lagrangian L, for which Ll n L' = Ll n L" = O.
Let L2 be the lagrangian with basis el , e2, . .. , ex, e(>'+l)"
. .. , er . , then clearly
and L n L' = L n LI/ = L n L 2 • But there exists a symplectic transformation f) which
fixes all points of Ll , the vectors el , e2, . . . ,e,\ and sends L' to L2; if f)' sends L" to
L 2 in a similar way, s = e:«.
I
If L n L' is not zero, we see that s is not unique. But if L n L' = L n L" = 0,
(1) proves its uniqueness and establishes a bijection between the set of lagrangians
which are transversal to L and the set of symmetric r x r matrices.
Under the assumptions of Lemma (18.2.1), it is always possible to choose the
(ea , ep.) such that
(2)
Now set Z = F(·, s(-)), Z is a quadratic form on L' and if L n L' = L n L" = 0, s is
unique.
Definition 18.2.1 If the signature of the quadratic form Z, Z(x)
x E L', is (p, q) (p plus signs, q minus signs), define
Inert(L', L, L") = - Inert(L", L, L') = p - q = - L ta o
a
F(x ,s(x)),
(3)
Remark. If the triple (L', L, L") can be continuously deformed, keeping L' and L"
transversal to L, Inert(L', L, L") remains constant if dim(L' n L") remains constant.
Note that if L' n L" = 0, ea' --+ ea' , ea --+ -ea - taea• gives rise to a symplectic
transformation that fixes all points of L' and sends L to L", so, when
L' n LI/= L n L' = L n L" = 0,

SYMPLECTIC SPINOR BUNDLES.
261
Inert(L, L', L" ) = -Inert(L', L, L") and Inert is antisymmetric and invariant under
cyclic permutations.

Proposition 18.2.1 Every'Y E Gs which fixes all points of the lagrangian is of the
form ft.(exp(ta(e"J2/2)), ta = ± 1, the ea being a basis for L; if L EB L' = E and
L" = 'Y(L'), the 'signature' of the sequence ofta , -(2: ta), is given by Inert(L', L, L").
Proof. ph) = s can be factored in terms of symplectic transvections, if a E L,
and we may assume that h = 1. a can be chosen such that t = ±1. Taking
a suitable choice of the ai, and i, allows us to reach every s defined by (1).
In
particular, we can choose the basis {ea, e{3'} so that s is defined by (2) and that

The 'signature' of the (ta) therefore has an intrinsic meaning.
•
Lemma 18.2.2 Given three lagrangians L, L' and L", there exists a lagrangian M
which is simultaneously transversal to them.
Proof. It is easy to prove that a lagrangian L can be identified with l =
aii- 1 ,
a E U(r), and that L is transversal to M if and only if l -
m is invertible, where m
corresponds to M . There are infinitely many suitable M.
•
Lemma 18.2.3 If L1 , L2 , L3 and L4 are lagrangians such that L2 is transversal to
L1 , L3 , L4 and that L3 is transversal to L1 , L2 , L4 , then
Proof. This follows from the previous remark.
•
Now, if L1 , L2 , L3 are arbitrary lagrangians, we choose an M which is transversal
to all three of them and, in accordance with (5), we define

262
CHAPTER 18
The indices on the right hand side remain constant if M varies while remaining
transversal to LI, L2 , L3 ; the left hand side will not depend on the choice of M.
This index is antisymmetric and, by its definition, invariant under symplectic
transformations. Note that (6) immediately leads to
which displays the invariance under cyclic permutations.
Invoking Proposition (18.2.1) again, we obtain :
Proposition 18.2.2 Given three arbitrary lagrangians L1 , L2 , L3 , if 713 E Gs fixes
all points of the lagrangian M which is transversal to L 1 , L3 and if it sends L1 to
L3i if 721 and 732 have similar properties for L2 , L1 and L3 , L2 respectively, and if
Remark.
Other definitions could be adopted; the signature could be defined as
the number of minus signs (d. Leray), but this loses some antisymmetry properties.
Some authors use a signature whose sign differs from ours .
Choosing M transversal to L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 (d. Lemma (18.2.4)) shows immediately
that (5) is valid for any four lagrangians, since it is the translation of a cohomological
property. Inert is a cocycle.
We will consider the decomposition of this cocycle and define the Z-valued Maslov
index.
18.2 .2
The Maslov index.
Lemma 18.2.4 The unitary group U(r) acts transitively on the set of lagrangian
subspaces with stabilizer O(r) .
Proof. If E =
E 1 Ell E2 is a symplectic Witt decomposition where E2 = J(E1 )
is orthogonal to E1 , since (Jx,y) = F(x,y) (Chapter 17,2.8), let L1 be another
lagrangian; if {<Ol} and {7]Ol} are orthogonal bases of E1 and L1 we send <Ol to 7]",>
J«",) to J(."",) and obtain a transformation which is both orthogonal and symplectic,
hence unitary.
I
We will consider the conditions under which the image of a lagrangian Gunder
a symplectic transformation s is a lagrangian L' transversal to L.
There exists a u E Spq(r), q = 2,3, . . . ,00 which sends the symplectic and ortho-
gonal basis {eOl' el3'} of E1 Ell E2 to the corresponding elements of a symplectic basis
{EOl' E{3'} corresponding to the decomposition E = L Ell L'.

The three-sided inertial index and the Maslov index.
Definition 18.2.3 if L1 and L2 are two lagrangians transversal to a lagrangian M,
we define m(Lt , L2 ) = ~Inert(L1' M, L2 ) ; m(L1 , L 2 ) is called the Maslov index of the
pair (L 1 , L2 ) .
By a previous remark, this integer or half-integer does not depend on the choice of
M (as long as it is transversal to L 1 and L 2 ) and (7) becomes, for three arbitrary
lagrangians :
Fnert(L1,L2 , L3 ) = m(L1 , L3 ) + m(L3 , L 2 ) + m(L2 , L 1 ) .
Proposition 18.2.4 If, E Spq(r) , q = 2,3, . . . , 00 sends the lagrangian L on the
transversal lagrangian L', preserving the lagrangian M which, itself, is transversal to
Land L', m oo(, ) can be identified with m(L, L') and m q(, ) is the reduction, modulo
2q, of m(L, 1').
Proof. We can choose a symplectic basis (Ea, Ea')' adapted to the decomposition
E = M EI1 L, such that p(,)(Ea), also denoted by ,(Ea), is equal to Ea and

Cohomological problems.
On the manifold V, a field J of real endomorphisms, such that J2 = - Id, can be
defined, thereby determining a complex and a riemannian structure for it . If a global
field L of oriented lagrangians exists over V a classical result is that T(V) = L ffiJ(L)
and the tangent space at x E V is modeled on E1 ffi E2 = E1 ffi J( Ed. The structural
group of the tangent bundle can be reduced to the orthogonal isometry group of E1
(or E 2 ) , i.e. SO(r) C U(r), where SO(r) is identified with SO(r) x SO(r).
Lemma 18.2.5 The field L of oriented lagrangians defines a field of isotropic com-
plex r-vectors for the riemannian structure.
Proof. The subbundle defined by L has (as special cases) transition functions U a /3(x) E
U(r) sending E1 to E2 , so that by formula (8) the field of isotropic r-vectors fa over
the open set Ua n U/3 is multiplied by exp(-i1rmoo(ua l3(x))), m oo(j)-I(Ua l3(X))) can
be written as La ta/2 where La ta can change by multiples of 4. If J.'a/3(x) preserves
E1 the result is obvious.
I
A field L of oriented lagrangians therefore determines a spinoplectic bundle natu-
rally associated to the complex structure. Then we see that formula (9) determines,
by "t = p-l (ua l3(x)), a Z2-valued cocycle, hence a bundle with group Z2 which we
will call the Maslov Z2 bundle of the pair (L, J L) of lagrangians.
We obtain a second spinoplectic bundle, which is isomorphic to the first one if
and only if the Maslov Z2 bundle is trivial.
Maslov bundles.
The case which is usually considered corresponds to a trivial
manifold R2r with a symplectic structure and a lagrangian submanifold L, i.e. a
submanifold whose tangent space in every point is a lagrangian. If x E L, (L 1 )", is a
lagrangian over x parallel to a fixed lagrangian in R 2r, L", is the tangent lagrangian
to E in x . Over E a bundle will be defined whose fiber in x is generated by the set of
Maslov indices of the elements in SPq(r) mapping (L1 )", to L"" these two lagrangians
being transversal in general.

Lemma 18.2.6 The complement in E of the set E of points z such that (Ld",nL", =I

Proof. Write V = R2r = E1 E9 E2 , E1 and E2 as before, and T",(V) = L", + Ei , Ei
being parallel to E2 j there exists a symplectic transformation p(x) such that the
form, in general, a basis of L"" since, in general, the matrix a~·(x) is regular and L""
Ei are transversal; the 'singular' points correspond to the non-transversality. As
() e:
~.( ) _

the singular points occur where
det({)x~· /{)x")"j3. = 0, so E is the image of the
critical point set of a mapping which, in every point of E fails to be a submersion.
By the Sard theorem, t:\ E is everywhere dense.
Now let £I be the set of z E E such that (Ld", n L", = OJ by Lemma (18.2 .6),
Z' = t: (where I' is the closure of £I).
A sheaf F with fiber Zq is constructed
over £'j it is also a trivial bundle over each open subset of £'j F is generated by
the sections z
--+ m q ( ,
) "" where ,'" is constant element over each connected open
set of £I and sends (L1 ) ", to L",. We consider the pre-sheaf PrF over E', then the
pre-sheaf i(PrF) where i stands for the inclusion of £' in L, If U is an open set of
c, i-1(U) = U \ (E n U). Over U, i(PrF) consists therefore of the sections of F
over U. Applying the 'sheaf functor' Fs, we construct Fs(i(PrF)). If x E U and if
S E i(PrF), [s",] being the germ of s in z , it is the general element of the sheaf. This
sheaf with fiber Zq can be identified with the Zq bundle, hence it is the Maslov Zq
~~ .
I
This construction can be generalized if we consider two lagrangian fields x --+ L",
and x
--+
L~ over L in R 2r .
Identifying L{x) with l(x) E U(r) and L'(x) with
l'(x) E U(r), the previous reasoning can be repeated where (L 1 )"" L", are replaced
by L""
L~ . L(x) is transversal to L'(z ) if and only if l(x) - l'(x) is invertible and
the mapping z
--+ det( l(x) - l'(x)) from E to C is such that the complement of its
kernel is everywhere dense in L.
Finally, a Maslov Zq bundle could be defined on a manifold V with a symplectic
bundle and two fields of lagrangian subs paces Land L'. The details are left to the
reader.

ALGEBRA DEFORMATIONS ON SYMPLECTIC
MANIFOLDS.
To a (n = 2r)-dimensional paracompact symplectic manifold V, we associate the
associative algebras COO(V) and COO(V, C) of differentiable real resp. complex-valued
functions.
F is the symplectic 2-form, dF = 0 and the rank of F is everywhere
maximal.
In this chapter we will use the symplectic Clifford bundle to construct deforma-
tions of these algebras.
Our method will prove that this problem can always be
solved, i.e. that there is no obstruction to this construction.
The fundamental idea is to send the algebra COO(V) in the sheaf of sections of
the symmetric covariant tensor bundle, which is linearly identified with the symplec-
tic Clifford bundle; to define on the latter bundle an associative, non-commutative
product, where the Planck constant is the deformation parameter; finally to return
to the initial algebra.
19.1
The generalized Taylor homomorphism.
Let Xo E V and let (Xl , x 2 , •• • ,xn ) be a local coordinate system on V with origin at
xo. On the tangent symplectic bundle, there exist an infinite number of torsion-free
connections such that \lF = 0, two of them differ by a completely antisymmetric
tensor of order 3. Let f E COO(V), and j its germ at Xo, 600(xo) is the associative
algebra of such germs, V(T;o) is the usual algebra of formal series with real coefficients
constructed over the cotangent space T;o at V in x. To every j E 600
( xo) we associate
<p(j) = j E V(T;o)' defined by
j = f(xo) + (\l;f)xodxi +...+ S[(\lili2 °o.iJ)xodxil 0 dXi2 0 . .. 0 dXih] +...
(1)
where S is a symmetrization still to be defined and \l is torsion-free and satisfies
\lF = 0 (such a \l is called a symplectic connection).

In the flat case, we want to reobtain the ordinary Taylor expansion, its general

The right-hand side of (2) is in fact well-defined, independently of any local basis;
if, for instance, we choose a symplectic basis in xo, using the notations of Chapter

In particular, \li(\ljf) = \l(ijJ! and \l(ijJ! = \lijf if there is no torsion.

remains valid by the simple formal analogy with the covariant derivatives
it leads to

so there exists a generalized Taylor homomorphism j
-+ j.
The kernel of this
homomorphism is, in general , non-zero. To eliminate this difficulty, we will make
some assumptions that will be weakened later on.
Note that if the Taylor homomorphism, computed for the usual partial deriva-
tives, is injective, the generalized homomorphism will also be injective, since reason-
ing by induction proves that the sequence of '\7(q, .'l2•...•qn) is equivalent to the sequence
of 8q' 'l2...qnf.
Now introduce assumption (H) :
Suppose that, for some choice of '\7, there exists a subspace CH(xo) =f 0 of germs
in Xo and positive constants a and A (depending on f
E CH(xo) and on xo) such
that
(Ht)

is injective.
It can be verified that if j and 9 satisfy H l , so will their product (by the Leibnitz
formula) and their sum. Furthermore, condition (Hl ) is independent of the local
basis.
Some cases where (H) can be satisfied arise if V is a fiat symplectic space with
the trivial connection and f an analytic function whose partial derivatives satisfy
Hl , and if V is a symplectic manifold with an atlas which is compatible with (Hl ) :
f being chosen such that '\7(i, .i2 ••• ••iq)f = 0 and q fixed on an open neighborhood of
Xo·
19.2
Deformations of the algebra CH(xo,C).
We consider complex-valued Coo functions j E CH(xo,C).
The linear isomorphism i from the symmetric algebra to the symplectic Clifford
algebra over T;o gives rise to the isomorphism CPl = i ~ cP from CH(xo, C) to the
complexified symplectic Clifford algebra. We will write 7= CPl(i). Under hypoth-
esis (HI) we obtain an image in the non-formal complex algebra C's(hF)l/2' If the
product in the symmetric algebra is denoted by juxtaposition of factors and the
symplectic Clifford product by 0 , a new multiplication is defined on CH(xo, C) by
(1)
(note that the series 70~ is convergent when the (dx)ij are interpreted as numbers).
The product * is immediately associative, but depends on the choice of the linear
isomorphism i. In relation with the construction of global deformations (d. ultra, 3
and 4), we note that if the isomorphism >'F is used, it is 'invariant' under symplectic
transformations and the product will be independent of the symplectic basis over
Xo E V.
The structural group of the tangent bundle reduces to U(r) and we may consider
bases which are commonly called hermitian and are constructed over the vectors

written as (Ea , Ea , ) in section 2.8 of Chapter 17. The basis changes involving matrices
from the unitary group will obviously preserve the linear identifications made starting
from a particular hermitian basis. The product constructed in this way is therefore
'invariant' under unitary transformations.
We will make (1) explicit using such a
linear isomorphism.
Denote by (-tF) the symplectic form, t being a real parameter, and let (()a, (){3')
be a hermitian cobasis at Xo (a basis of T:o)' ()a = (ea + iea,)/'Ifi, ()a' = (ea -

Similarly, \IT\l(ijk)! equals \IT\I(ijk>! plus terms involving the curvature
tensor and its covariant derivatives; again the Bianchi identities ensure that no new
curvature terms appear by covariant derivation.
Then it is easily seen that all these correction terms vanish if the value of the
product j *9 is taken in Xo.
19.3
Formal deformations of the algebra COO(V, C).
Note that both formula (6) of the previous section, valid in the flat case, and the
analogous formula with curvature terms, give a computational algorithm which can
be automatically extended to all germs of COO(V) functions, if they are considered as
formal power series in t, since the verification of the associativity leads to identical
computations in all cases. Hence :
Proposition 19.3.1 On every symplectic manifold there exists in all points Xo a
formal deformation of the algebra C:(C) of germs of differentiable functions.
The constructed deformation allows us to define the mapping Xl
---7 U"'o *g",o )(XI)'
Xl belonging to some neighborhood of Xo. For Xl = Xo, if Xo varies, the mapping
X ---7 U", *9",)(X),
denoted by

remark :

Proposition 19.3.3 The product * has the symplectic covariance property : if B is
a symplectic differentiable mapping, B(f*g) = (Bf)*(Bg), where (0f)(x) = f OO-l(X).

(Of * Og)x, = CP2 (t/J(Bf)x, 0 t/J(Og)x,)
and we choose t/J such that T(Ro) = t/J(Rd where T is the parallel transport for the
connection ~and R o?..R l are the adapted hermitian bases in Xo and Xl '
Since t/J(0f)x, = T1xo '
\l being a symplectic connection, this can be written as
from which the stated property follows .
I
Summarizing, a brief description of the deformation of COO(V, C) runs as follows :
the structural group of the tangent bundle is reduced to the unitary group and the
isomorphism CPl, determined by a choice of bases adapted to the almost hermitian
structure, sends the sheaf of germs of differentiable functions into the sheaf of germs
of sections of the complexified symplectic Clifford bundle; the zero-degree component
in 0" and OK' of the product of germs of sections associated to f, 9 E coo(V, C) then
defines f * g.
19.4
Formal deformations of the algebra COO(V, R).
The preceding method can be applied if we replace the bases adapted to the almost
hermitian structure by symplectic bases and use the 'covariant' isomorphism (for all
symplectic transformations) AtF; this allows us to remain in the real field. The global
existence of deformations raises no problem, so :

274
CHAPTER 19
Proposition 19.4.1 On every symplectic manifold, there exists a formal deforma-
tion of the associative algebra COO(V, R) .
Nevertheless, the correspondence by AtF is complicated and, to have a convenient
computational method, in the natural setting of theoretical mechanics, we will as-
sume that the manifold possesses a global field L of real lagrangians (this holds for
the usual phase space V = T·(M)). We know that V has a complex structure J and
that T(V) = L ffi J L; a classical reasoning from differential geometry then shows
that the structural group of the bundle can be reduced to O(r) x O(r) . Using real
cobases adapted to this decomposition of the tangent bundle, denoted by (<pC>., <pC>.'),
formula (4) of section 19.2 is replaced by

and the computations are carried out just as in the complex case , yielding formally
identical results.
19.5
The Moyal product.
Let E be a real symplectic (n = 2r)-dimensional space with cartesian coordinates
(xl, x2 , •• • , xn ) . First considerthe set P of real polynomial functions in (xl, x2 , • •• , e"),
of arbitrary finite degree.
Let I, 9 E P, we define
00 tk
f *M. 9 = ~ k!Mpk(f ® g) ,
where
plc(f ® g) = pi1ilpi2i2 .. . Pikik(8il ...iJ) ®R (8i1...ik9),
M(f ® g) = Is,
f *M.g is the Moyal product of f and 9 for the real parameter value t. If P is replaced
by the set PC>. of entire series in (Xl ,.. . ,xn ) with coefficients of the type introduced
for the algebras Cs(hP)C>., we see that the Moyal product is defined for i.e E PC>.'
Using E ®R R( (t)) = E' or by the definition of Chapter 17, the algebra 6s(tP) is
formal. Let (<pi, t o<pi = t<pi) be a basis of (E')·, the dual of E', which is a symplectic
space.
It is known that the formal algebra P is an associative algebra under the Moyal
product. Let us accept this result for the moment; later we will deduce it indepen-
dently in a natural way using our approach.
Put u(<pi) = xi, u(t<pi) = tx i, u extends to a linear mapping from (E')· to P'.
Since:
U(<pi) *M. u(<pi) - u(<pi) *M. u(<pi) = tpii = tP(<pi,<pi)
u(t<pi) *M. u(T<pi) - u(t<pi) *M. u(t<pi) = t 3 pii = tP(t<p', t<pi),

ALGEBRA DEFORMATIONS ON SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS.
275
the universal property of symplectic Clifford algebras (Chapter 17, 1.2) implies the
existence of a homomorphism u from Cs(tF) to P', under the Moyal product, such
that u 0 PtF = U. By the remark in Chapter 17, 2.4, the two-sided ideals of Cs(tF)
being trivial, u must be injective. One can verify that u(!pi)n = (xi)n , u(trn ( !pi)n) =
trn(xi)n and that u reaches all generators of P.
The algebra Cs(tF) is therefore isomorphic to the Moyal algebra.
Let us have a closer look at this isomorphism :
u( epi) = xi,
u(epi 0 epj) = u(epi) *M. u(epj) = xi *M. xj = xix j +ir«,
u(epi 0 epj 0 epk) = xi *M, (xjxk + tFjk)
xixjxk+tFijxk +tFikxj +tFjkxi
xi(xjxk +tFjk) +tFijxk + Fikxj
xiu(!pj 0 !pk) + j~:Fu(!pj 0 !pk)
and this relation holds for any number of factors, so that if we consider the right-
hand sides, which have values in the symmetric algebra, u can be identified with the
linear isomorphism AUF.
So we have, in this setting :
Proposition 19.5.1 The Moyal algebra can be identified with the 'Kiihler-Atiyah
algebra' determined by the isomorphism AUF from the symplectic Clifford algebra
to the symmetric algebra.

THE PRIMITIVE IDEMPOTENTS OF THE CLIFFORD
ALGEBRAS AND THE AMORPHIC SPINOR FIBER
BUNDLES.
We intend to clarify the 'primitive idempotent' method of defining spinor bundles
as fields of minimal ideals in some Clifford algebra. In this, the fundamental notion
of 'geometric Clifford spinoriality group', similar but not at all equivalent to that of
'groupe de spinorialite' defined by the author in [1, d], will appear. Existence condi-
tions depend on the choice of the standard left ideal and give a 'chaotic character'
to the physics. The existence of primitive idempotent fields requires that very strict
conditions be satisfied.
We give several examples.
The primitive idempotent method offers algebraic
tools, but raises a lot of geometric obstacles and cannot replace, improve or generalize
the r-isotropic approach [1].
20.1
Preliminaries [I, d].
Let E be a real or complex n-dimensional vector space endowed with a non-degenerate
quadratic form Q.
We denote by C(E, Q) or, shorter, C( Q), the Clifford algebra. If E is a real space
and if Q has signature (p,q) (p positive and q negative squares), we also write Ep,q
for the space and Cp,q for its Clifford algebra.
If n = 2r, C(Q) is a simple central algebra. If n = 2r +1, the even part C+(Q) of
C(Q) is a central simple algebra. We shall call denote by A either C(Q), if n = 2r,
or C+(Q), if n = 2r + 1.
According to the Skolern-Noether theorem, any automorphism of A is an inner
automorphism. The inner automorphisms which preserve E globally are induced by
the action of the non-twisted Clifford group G and will be called geometric inner
automorpbisms (or G.I.A. for short).
If J is any left or right ideal, there exists an idempotent e, which is non-unique
in general, such that J = Ae . If the ideal is minimal, e is said to be a primitive

idempotent. Then there cannot exist a decomposition e = e' + e" where e' and e"
are mutually annihilating non -zero idempotents (e'e" = e"e' = 0).
If e and el are primitive idempotents, there exists au E A' (the set of invertible
elements in A) such that el = ueu-1 , and if e and el determine the ideals J and J1
respectively, either J n J 1 = J = J 1 or J n J 1 = {O}.
It is well known that eAe is isomorphic to a division ring K and that this property
characterizes the primitive idempotents.
When E is real, according to the classical periodicity properties, if e is a primitive
idempotent:
eAe = R,
p - q = 0,1,2 (mod 8),
eAe = H,
p - q = 4,5,6(mod8),
eAe = C,
p - q = 3, 7(mod8).
When E is complex, eAe = C (d. Chapter 5).
Notice that if eue = x, A E K \ {O} = K',
eue = Ae = eA,
A= eA= Ae
and AA-1 = A-I A = e, where A-I is the inverse of A in K.
It is of importance to note that this inverse is not the inverse in A; e is its own
inverse in K , ee = e, but not in A, because ee = e:f 1.
20.2
Amorphic spinoriality groups.
Let e be a primitive idempotent.
We are looking for elements u E A' such that
e' = ueu- 1 and that both e and e' determine the same left ideal J in A.
It is evident that these elements u form a subgroup of A', called Ee , and that we
can identify Ee and Eel if e and el determine the same ideal J . We will call Ee the
stability ideal of the left ideal J = Ae for the action of inner automorphisms.
Ee is a 'Clifford spinoriality group (C.S.G.)'. Clearly, different C.S.G. are conju-
gate in A'.
Proposition 20.2.1 If the primitive idempotent e defines the left ideal J and if
u E Ee , there exists a A E K' such that eu-1 = A, and if e' = ueu-1, e' = uAe.
Conversely, if one chooses u E A' such that eu = A-ie, A E K', taking ueu- 1 = e'
leads to e' = uAe and e' determines the left ideal J ifuAe = ve, v E A'.
Proof. If e' = ueu-1 also determines J, e' =
Be, (J E A' and reciprocally, then
eu-1 = u-1(Je = eu-1e = A, v E A, A E K', A= Ae = eu-1 or eu = eA- 1 = A-Ie; we
obtain e' = uAe .
The converse is easy.

CHAPTER 20
20.3
Idempotents and anti-involutions.
First we choose the usual anti-involution f3, f3(x) = z , if x E E.
If e as an idempotent, so will f3(e) and if e is primitive, so too will f3( e) : thus
f3(e) also determines a minimal left ideal J' .
Interesting properties arise from the comparison of J and J'.
1. J n J' = {O} : then e i- f3( e) and e, f3( e) determine a left ideal K = J Ell J'.
If f denotes an idempotent determining K, f is the sum of two primitive
idempotents :
(a) If e + f3(e) is a non-primitive idempotent, e + f3(e) determines K and
ef3(e) = f3( e)e = 0 according to a classical result.
If e' also determines J , e'f3(e') = u)..(e)f3(e)f3()..)f3(u) = O. This case occurs
frequently.
(b) If e + f3(e) is not an idempotent, the previous result does not hold. This
case occurs, for example, as follows : consider the algebra C1 ,l and a Witt
frame {Xl, Yl}, XIYl + YIXI = 1; the idempotents e = (al + XI)YI , al i- 0,
and Yl(al +Xl) = f3(e) are primitive; if they verify (e +f3( e))2 = e+f3( e),
as we have ef3(e) = 0, also f3( e)e = 0, but this result is wrong; the ideals
corresponding to e and f3( e) have zero intersection and we must have
e +f3( e) = 1 if e +f3( e) is a (trivial) idempotent.
If e + f3(e) is not an idempotent, there exists a u preserving J and a v
preserving J' such that
ueu-Ivf3(e)v-1= vf3(e)v-1ueu-1= 0,
taking into account that eu- l = )..e :
evf3(e) = 0,
f3(e)ue = O.
Reciprocally, if vf3( e)v- l determines the same ideal J' as f3( e) and if
evf3(e) = 0, J = J' is impossible because, taking e = vf3( e)v- 1 , ee = 0, e,
edetermining J .
We may write e = weJe, o E K (Proposition (20.2 .1)),
ee = e i- 0
is a contradiction.
If e' also determines J, e' = u)..e, f3(e) = f3(e)f3()..)f3(u) so that evf3(e) = 0
implies e'vf3(e') = O. There exists a v EA· with e'vf3(e') = 0 for any e'
associated to J and v preserves J'.

279
2. J n J' = J = J'. fJ(e) being a primitive idempotent :
fJ(e) = vev-\
v E A*.
According to Proposition (20.2 .1), there exists a ..\ E K* such that
fJ(e) = v..\e,
fJ(e)e = fJ(e) ~ fJ(e)e = e, e = fJ(e) and efJ(e) = fJ(e)e -=I o.
We can state :
Proposition 20.3.1 If e determines J and fJ( e) determines J', both being minimal
left ideals of c(Q),
1. If J n J' = {O}, then e -=I fJ(e).
(a) e + f3( e) is idempotent : ef3(e) = f3( e)e = O.
(b) e+f3(e) is not idempotent: there exists a u preserving J and a v preserving
J' such that evf3(e) = f3( e)ue = 0 and e'vf3(e') = 0, for any e' determining
J .
2. IfJnJ'=J=J',f3(e)=e.
3. If ef3(e) = 0, necessarily J n J' = {O}.
More generally, if there exists a v
preserving J' such that evf3(e) = 0, then J n J' = {O}.
We intend to obtain simpler results, so we restrict the group A* to its subgroup B
of elements u such that f3(u)u = uf3(u) E R * (in the real case) or f3(u)u = uf3(u) E C*
(in the complex case). Note that if u E B the set of all primitive idempotents e such
that e =
f3( e) or e + f3( e) is idempotent if e -=I f3( e), is preserved by the inner
automorphisms defined by elements of B.
We must observe that the group ~e is replaced by a group Se, and that Se, Set
are conjugate in ~e (using the notations of section 2).
Note also that f3 commutes with the inner action of u if u E B .
Proposition 20.3.2 If J n J' = J = J', if e, e' are primitive idempotents determin-
ing the same left ideal J and if e' = ueu- 1 with u ESe, then e = e' ,
(f3(e) = e implies f3( e') = e' because f3 commutes with u.)
Proof. We have f3(e)f3(..\)f3(u) = u..\e (Proposition (20.2.1)),
ef3(..\ )f3(u) = u..\e = ef3(..\ )f3(u)e = ef3( >. )f3(u )f3(e),

CHAPTER 20
Remark 1. If e and e' both determine J, if f3( e) determines J' and if f3( e') deter-
mines JII, JII i: J' except if e = e'.
Since f3(e') = f3(u-1)f3(e)f3(u), if f3(e') determines the same left ideal as f3(e), there
exists a
(J' E K such that
(Proposition (20 .2.1)), but
f3(u)f3(e) = f3(>.-l)f3(e);
multiplying the first equality by the second and vice versa, we obtain :
f3(e) = (J'f3(>,-l)f3(e) ,
(J' = f3(>.),
f3(u)f3(e)f3(u- 1) = f3(e) = f3(e'),
then e = e', We can now summarize our results :
Proposition 20 .3.3 If the primitive idempotent e determines the left ideal J and
if f3(e) determines the left ideal J',
1. If e i: f3( e) and if e+ f3( e) is an idempotent, then
J n J' = {O},
ef3(e) = f3(e)e= O.
If e" i: e, e' = ueu"; u E Se also determines J , and if f3(e') determines JII,
then J n JII = {O}; if e' i: e, J' n JII = {O}.
2. If e = f3(e), J n J' = J = J', "Ie' such that e' = ueu- 1 , u E S., if e' also
determines J , e' = e.
Remarks 2.
In case 2, the group S, appears as one of the u E B such that eu = ue.
In case 1, e' = Be with BE K*, Bi: 1 is impossible : in fact, e' = Be yields
f3(e') = f3(e)f3(B) = f3(B)f3(e),
f3(e') and f3(e) correspond to the same left ideal, and that contradicts the remark if
Bi: 1.
We shall give below an example with e' = e (case 1).
We can choose ~ instead of f3, where fJ = f3 0 a., a. is the main involution of G(Q) :
o.(x) = -x, x E E.
When u E B, put f3(u)u = uf3(u) = N(u) E R* or Co ; if e = f3(e), in the
notations of section 2,
eu-1 = Xe,
ue = N(u)f3(>.)e,
ueu-1 = N(u)f3(>.)>'e,
e' = N(u)f3(>.)>.e,
N(u)f3(>.)>. = 1.

If u E G, 2 U defines a G.I.A . and u E B : with the elements of G, we obtain
a subgroup a e of Ee and Se : ae is called a geometric Olifford spinoriality group
(G.O.S.G.). a e is defined, a priori, modulo a conjugation in Ee , when J = Ae is
given.
But o; = a e, if e' = ve is any idempotent in Ae.
In fact, ifu E a e , eu = A-1e = eA-1, AE K.,
veu = vA-1e,
e'u = (VA-1v-l)e' = e'ue' = ae',
a E K.,
e'u = ae' = e'o.
Conversely, if e'u = a e' = e'a,
veu = ave,
eu = (v-lav)e = eue = >.-le = e>,-l,

The proof works also with Se, Se' in the same situation. We can speak of a; (or Se)
as the subgroup of G (or B) whose e1ements preserve the left ideal J = Ae.

Examples and comments.
20.4.1
The real space E1,3 '
We have p- q = -2 (mod 8) and the example belongs to the quaternionic type. The
spinor space dimension is 2 over Hand 8 over R.
Let (eO,el,e2,e3) be a frame of E1,3 with (eo)2 = 1, (e,)2 = -1, i = 1,2,3; it is
easy to prove that

[3(h) = hand j3(h2) = b«, but that j3(h1) f; hI and [3(hI) f; b-, [3(hl) + hI = 1, so
hI corresponds to the case 1,(a) and hI, h2 to the case 2 of Proposition (20.3.1).
Actually we can check:
{huh, u E O(Q)} = {(aele2 + be2e3 + ce3el + d)h, a, b,c, dE R},
{h2uh2,u E O(Q)} = {(aele2+be2e3+ce3el +d)h2, a,b,c,dE R},
{hluhl, u E O(Q)} = {(a + bel +ce2+dele2)hl, a, b,c,s e R}
where the division ring H appears.
According to the classical properties of the simple algebras, 0 1,3 is the direct sum
of two left ideals (and of two right ideals as well); for example (1 - eo)/2 = hand h
give such a decomposition.

282
First we are looking for Eh .
A real frame for spinor space is

We look for u E A' such that
hU=>,-lh,
>'EH',
u = lux + h0.1 ,
0.,0.1 E A,
hu = lux = >.-lh = h>.-I.
We can then write
u = lux + h(-y+ eN6),
0.",6 are quaternions (of the form aele2+be2e3 +ce3el+d), commuting with hand
h, and heN = eNh.
If u' is the inverse of u,
u' = ho' + h(-y' + eN6/),
uu' = 1,
and then
boo' + h(-y + eN6)ho.' + h(-y + eN6)h(-y' + eN6') = 1.
A right multiplication by h gives
boo' = h,
0.' = 0.- 1
(necessarily 0. f= 0); a right multiplication by h gives likewise :
h(, + eN6)h(,' + eN6')h = h,
"
= ,-I
(because, f= 0).
Taking these results into account :
h + h(-y + eN6)ho.-
1 + h + h,eN6' = 1,
heNMo.-l + heN,6' = 0,
6' = _,-160.-1.
We obtain if h' = uhu-1 ,
h' = (1+ eN 60.- 1)h,
but the coefficient of h must be invertible if hand h' define the same ideal, and it is
easy to check that 6 = 0 and h' = h.
Eh is the set of elements u belonging to hH' EEl hH', and because hh = hh = 0
we can state : Eh , the C.S.G. of h = (1 + eo)/2, is isomorphic to H' x H'. It 's also
the stability group of h.
We obtain the same results with h2•

The invertibility condition gives 5 = 0, Eh , is isomorphic to H* x H* and Eh, is also
the stability group of hI .
These results were expected. But what about ah, ? Taking into account the Lie

The real space E3 ,l '
p - q = 2 and the Clifford algebra C3 ,l belongs to a real type. The real spinors could
be called 'Majorana spinors' and belong to a four-dimensional real space; 0 3,1 is the
direct sum of four spinor spaces.

CHAPTER 20
We choose (eo)2 = (ed2 = (e2)2 = 1, (e3)2 = -1 and the primitive idempotent
h = HI + eo)(l + eOele3) = HI + eo)(l + ele3),
(3(h) =f h =f ~(h), K = R.
We have to determine u such that

We put u = hao + L:~ hiai, h, hI, b«,h3 are a complete system of primitive idempo-

following conditions :

hiai(hao + L:~ hjaj) = hi.
Note :
h(eOe2) = (eoe2)h},
h2(eOe2) = (eoe2)h3,
(eoe2)h = hl(eOe2),
h(eIe2) = (ele2)h3, h2(ele2) = (eIe2)h l,

We obtain similarly the coefficients of al and aJ .

h' = [1 +(2: h;a;)ao1]h.

Calling {3' the coefficient of eOe2 in al and ," the coefficient of el e2 in a3, we
obtain :
h' = [1 + a(;I({3'eoe2 +6eOel+,"ele2)]h
and the invertibility condition gives 6 = {3' = ," = o.
The real dimension of I:h is 10.
Now we consider only u E G (the Clifford group) and we determine (1h (at least
its connected component of the identity). L:(G) is the Lie algebra of G.
If v E L:((1h) , according to section 2, hv = >'h, >. E R
we obtain easily :
and (1h is four-dimensional.
Instead of checking uhur? = h', we calculate
v E L:((1h),
vh - hv = (v - >.)e
vh - hv = (aeO(el + e3)+ be2(el +eJ) + c(eJel + l))h.
More particularly, if v E L:(Pin(Q)), d + >. = 0 and
is a general element of the Lie algebra of a group (1}..
If we consider the stability group of h, if v belongs to its Lie algebra, vh - hv = 0,
and the connected component of the stability group of h reduces to the identity.
Remark 4.
In the paper [1, f] we defined a group called 'Groupe de spinorialite
elargi reduit' (reduced enlarged spinoriality group). It is easy to verify that (at least
for its connected component), (1}. is isomorphic to this group, c = 0 corresponds to
our reduced spinoriality group.

286
CHAPTER 20
20.4.3
An important remark about the stability group of the primitive
idempotents.
Suppose we change of primitive idempotent to define the same minimal left ideal.
For example in 0 3 ,1 , we choose :
1 + e1 + e3 and 1 - e1 - e3 belong to
~h, h' determines the same ideal as h.
We intend to compare the connected stability groups of hand h' in the connected
component of G. For h this set is the identity.
We search for v E .c(G) such that
vh' - h'v = 0,
v E .c(ah')'
It is easy to verify that .c(ah') = .c(ah)'
Take v = (aeo + be2)(e1+ e3)+ ce3e1 + k where a, b,c, k E R.
vh' - h'v = v(l + e1 + e3)h - (1 + e1 + e3)hv = 0,
vh - hv = (el +e3)hv - v(e1 + e3)h = -c(l- eo)(e1+ e3)
!(aeo + be2)(1 - eO)(e1 + e3) = -c(l - eO)(e1 + e3),
c = a/2,
b = 0
v = aeO(el + e3) + (a/2)e3e1 + k is the general element of the stability group's Lie
algebra for h'. Thus the stability group of h' differs from the identity.
We state the crucial result :
Two primitive idempotents can define the same minimal left ideal but have dif-
ferent stability groups in G.
This explains why the primitive idempotent fields are, in general, inappropriate
tools to define amorphic spinor bundles (d. below).
Nevertheless, we have obtained interesting results about idempotents that are
preserved by some anti-involution f3 or fJ : if f3(e) = e or if fJ(e) = e, the group a,
is the stability group of e and if e' also determines the minimal ideal Ae, ae, = a. is
the stability group of e'.
We insist that two distinct minimal left ideals Ae, Ae' give rise to groups ~. and
~.t which are always conjugate in A' but not necessarily conjugate in G (d. the
example above with h, hl , h2 E 01,3)'
20.4.4
It is particularly important to define the anti-involutions 1, commuting with a G1-
action, G1 being a subgroup of G (or G+ if n is odd) such that 1(e) = e for some
idempotent. We shall examine this problem in the section 7 of this chapter. In bun-
dle problems we sha.llbe confronted with particular G.I.A . satisfying some particular

PRIMITIVE IDEMPOTENTS AND AMORPHIC SPINOR BUNDLES.
287
conditions. The most important case is given by G.I.A. preserving a direct ortho-
gonal decomposition Ep,q = Ep EB Eq in positive and negative parts. There exists
an automorphism ex' in Cp,q such that ex'(ej) = ej if Q(ej) = 1 and ex'(ej) = -ej if
Q(ej) = -1. The anti-involution f3 composed with ex' gives a new anti-involution
f3', but f3' commutes only with the G1-action where G1 is the subgroup of G or G+
preserving the above orthogonal decomposition. We shall prove in section 7 that any
anti-involution 'Y, commuting with a G1-action (G1 preserving E, subgroup of G or
G+ is n is odd) is f3, /3, or like f3'.
For example, in C1,3 , with the orthogonal decomposition associated to the frame
eo, e1, e2, e3, the idempotent h = HI + eo)(l + e1e3) satisfies f3(h) = h. Naturally,
Proposition (20.3 .2) is applicable with f3' .
20.4.5
Real and complex minkowskian spinors.
Again consider the space E1 ,3 : a spinor frame (after choice of the particular idem-
potent (1 + eo)/2) is given by :
1 + eo,
e2e3(1 + eo),
e3e1(1 +eo),
e1e2(1 + eo),
eN(l + eo), eNe2e3(1 + eo),
eNe3e1(1+eo),
eNe1e2(1 +eo),
where the quaternionic frame 1, e2e3, e3e1 , e1e2 appears modulo (1 + eo). (Some au-
thors call these spinors 'biquaternions'.)
Here (eN)2 =
- 1; if one substitutes i for eN, a frame for 4-dimensional com-
plex space is obtained. This complex space is nothing but a spinor space for the
complexified Clifford algebra cg.
Note that spinor spaces are defined modulo a representation equivalence. We
can choose instead of h = (1 + eo)/2 the primitive idempotent h1 = (1 +eoe3)/2 =
((1 - e3)/v'2)h((1 + e3)/v'2) and h is not geometrically equivalent to h1.
Substituting the complex number i for eN, we obtain the idempotent e :
and if we define the Witt basis
eo + e3
Y1 = --2-'
eo - e3
Xl = --2-'
e = -X1X2Y1Y2,
and according to the previous construction real spinors determined by the idem-
potent (1 + eoe3)/2 correspond to the complex spinors defined by the idempotent
(-X1X2Y1Y2) where the two-dimensional isotropic vector f = Y1Y2 appears (d. the
author's methods [1] or Chapter 5 above).
Observe that these two kinds of spinors are not geometrically equivalent (non
covariant in the Lorentz sense).

Now we consider the spaces E3,t and Eg,

The C-spinor space is four-dimensional over C, eight-dimensional over R . From
two examples of R -spinor spaces (determined by hand h2 ) we obtain the realification
of the C-spinor space determined by HI + ete3)(1 + eNeOe2), and the C-spinor space
itself is determined by 1(1 + ete3)(1 +ieOe2) or by the isotropic 2-vector YtY2.
Grosso modo we obtain the complex case changing suitably eN into i.
Note
nevertheless that this method gives a particular idempotent for eg and, as there
exists an infinite set of idempotents giving the same ideal as the isotropic 2-vector
YtY2, the idempotent method and the author's 2-isotropic method are not at all
equivalent : only the latter is a 'geometric' method.
20.5
Amorphic spinor bundles.
Before entering this subject it is important to note that Clifford algebras possess
two kinds of properties : tbey are semi-simple (or simple) associative algebras (and
idempotents are connected witb tbis property), but tbey also are 'geometric algebras'
arising from an ortbogonal space (tbe spinor group comes from that). The bundle
problems are tied to G or O(p,q) actions and are therefore geometric, so we work
with the geometric inner automorphism (G .I.A.) preserving globally the standard
space E.
20.5.1
Minimal left ideal bundles.
Let V or Vp,q be a connected pseudo-riemannian manifold with a regular pseudo-
metric of signature (p,q).

PRIMITIVE IDEMPOTENTS AND AMORPHIC SPINOR BUNDLES.
289
There exists a vector bundle Clif(V) whose fibers are isomorphic to Cp,q, with
structural group Clif(Q) (or Clif(p, q)), natural extension of O(Q) (or O(p,q)) or
natural extension of the improper inner action if G or Pin(Q).
We consider a vector subbundle of which the fibers are minimal left ideals of the
Clif(V) fibers.
The typical fiber for that subbundle is a minimal left ideal of the standard algebra
Cp,q, but note that there does not exist any left action of G or Pin(Q), or Spin] Q),
on the fibers, there only exists an improper inner act ion for these groups.
This
subbundle is called an amorphic spin or bundle (A.S.B).
If we call a e a geometric Cliffordian spinoriality group (G .C.S.G.), this projection
(non skew) onto O(p,q), p(ae ) will be called an orthogonal spinoriality group (O .S.G.)
(the primitive idempotent e defines a standard minimal ideal in Cp,q).
A standard result about the fibrations gives the statement:
Proposition 20.5.1 There exists an A.S.B. with standard fiber Ae if and only if the
structural group O(p,q) of the tangent bundle T(V) is reducible to the orthogonal
spinoriality group p(ae ) .
Remark 5.
Note that this definition is, a priori, completely different from the one
about 'spinor structures' associated to a covering of the bundle of pseudo-orthogonal
frames. No proper action of a group such as Pin(Q) or Spin(Q) is involved.
On the contrary, the 'maximal isotropic subspace' method, giving also bundles
of minimal left ideals, and developed by the author in [1] (or Chapter 14 above), is
strongly related to the covering principal bundle approach.
If {3(e) = e or i3( e) = e or {3'(e) = e, i.e. if e is invariant under an anti-involution
which commutes with the structural group, the group a e is the stability group of e
(Proposition (20.3.2)) and we have :
Proposition 20.5.2 If the primitive idempotent e determining the standard fiber
Ae is invariant under an anti-involution commuting with the structural group of
T(V), the existence of an A.S.B. modeled by Ae is equivalent to the existence of a
global field of primitive idempotents in the Clifford bundle.
Here we can ask whether, in the Clifford algebra A, there exists a primitive
idempotent e' and an anti-involution '"'f commuting with the p(G)-action (if n is
even) or the p(G+)-action (if n is odd), such that '"'f(e') = e', We can also consider
some subgroup of G or G+.
Remark 6.
A priori, the existence of an A.S.B. does not imply the existence of a
field of primitive idempotents patterned by some standard primitive idempotent e.

290
CHAPTER 20
20.5.2
Examples of A.S.B.
a) First consider the space EI ,3'
If we choose the standard idempotent h = (1 + eo)/2, f3(h) = h, J n J' = J = J'
and
f7h is the stability group of h, f7h preserves eo and preserves globally the space
(eI, e2,e3)' If there exists on Vi. ,3 an A.S.B. modeled by h, the structural group
of T(V) reduces to 0(3) and there exists a 'time-like' vector field and a primitive
idempotent field.
If we choose now the idempotent h2 = (1 + eIe2e3)/2, (3(h2 ) = b«, the group f7h2
preserves h2 and eIe2e3, the existence of an A.S.B. implies a space orientation for
Vi.,3 and the reduced structural group is 0(1) x SO(3).
Finally, we take hI = (1 + eoe3)/2, f3'(ht} = b«, 13' is an anti-involution of which
the type was defined in subsection 4.4, compatible with the group 0(1) x 0(3). If
we have an A.S.B. there exists a field of hyperbolic planes (corresponding to eOe3)
and if we suppose that Vi.,3 is orientable, p(f7hl) admits the Lie algebra determined
by ele2, the structural group of T(V) is reducible to SI .
b) Consider the space E3,1 and the primitive idempotent
h = HI + eo)(l + e2e3) = HI + eo)(l + eOeIe3)'
Taking into account the reduction to 0(1) x 0(3), there exists an anti-involution 13
such that f3( h) = hand p(f7h) considered here in O(1) x 0(3) is the stability group
of h.
If we suppose that V3,1 is orientable (we want to use our previous results) we
obtain p(f7h) = Id.
The existence of an A.S.B. modeled on h implies the triviality of the tangent
bundle. (We find again this result using h' = (1 + el + e3)h, v = aeO(el + e3) +
(a/2)e3el + k is a general element of the Lie algebra of the stability group; k = 0 is
possible, a = 0 is necessary.)
These examples prove that if V carries a pseudo-riemannian structure :
Proposition 20.5.3 The existence of an A.S.B. oyer V is not connected with tbe
intrinsic topological properties of tbe manifold V .
20.5.3
Connections over A .S.B. : amorphic spin-euclidean connections
(A.M.S.E. connections).
First suppose that there exists a standard idempotent with f3( e) = e, and choose Ae
as a standard fiber . We have, according to classical terminology, a p(f7e )-stru cture in
the bundle of T(V)-frames and, according to our results above, a bundle of minimal
left ideals determined by a global field of idempotents : abusively we note this field
x -t ex and f3( ex) = ex, 'ltx E V .
If u E f7e , ueu-I = e and v belongs to the Lie algebra £(f7.) if and only if
ve - ev = O.

PRIMITIVE IDEMPOTENTS AND AMORPHIC SPINOR BUNDLES.
291
Still according to classical results there exists a principal connection 'V with a £(a.) -
valued form w such that exw(Xx) - w(Xx)ex = 0 (A.M.S.E. connection) (abusively
ew(X) - w(X)we = 0) for any vector field X over V .
Proposition 20.5.4 If e =

fundamental field of idempoienis and 'V the principal p(a.)-connection.
Proof. Indeed, let , be a curve with (d,/ dt)t=o = X (r(0)) and (el ' e2, ... , en)'1(t) an
orthonormal frame obtained by 'V-parallel translation of (el , e2, ... , en)'1(O) along , .
If T is any vector field and if T(r(t)) = TOl(r(t))eOl(r(t)), it is classical that
and our connection 'V extends naturally to the Clifford algebra. If 'V preserves the
amorphic spinor space field, the translated of (e )'1(0) is (e)'1(t) and 'Vxe = O.
•
Remark 7.
We have the same result with fJ and {3'; the last case supposing a
previous reduction of the structural group.
Now consider the case where we do not know if there exists a primitive idempotent
field over V .
If u Ea., ueu-l = e', eu =
e~-l =
~-le ,
~ E K· , if e is the selected standard
idempotent, in the notations of Proposition (20.2.1).
In the Lie algebra £(a.) :
ev = eb = be,
ve - ev = (v - b)e.
Nevertheless, we can locally define a field x
-+ ex, the local fiber is A(z )ex.
Suppose that x = ,(t)i the translated of (e)'1(t) = E'1(t) are such that
and we have (abusively)
'Vxe = W(X)e
where W(X) is a local Clifford field.
B'1(t) = U(r(t))A(r(t)) and the derivative for t = 0 gives W = u'(O) + N(O).
Remark 8.
'Vxe = W(X)e implies e'Vxe = O. From e2 = e we obtain :
'Vxe
2
('Vxe)e +e('Vxe) = 'Vxe
= W(X)e + e'Vxe = W(X)e
hence e'Vxe = o.

292
Conversely, if eVxe = 0, as
Vx ('l/Je) = Vx('l/Je2) = 'l/J(Vxe)e + 'l/J(eVxe) + (Vx'l/J)e,
V X ('l/Je) = W(X)e,
\f'l/J.
CHAPTER 20
One finds this result in [2].
Note that this property only has a local meaning, x -4 e", being local.
It appears that the best tool for the definition of amorphic spinor bundles is not
the idempotent field but the geometric Clifford spinoriality groups a. .
Also, the
global existence of fields of primitive idempotents greatly constraints the topology of
the manifold and may depend on the standard idempotent e, according to subsection
4.3.
20.5.4
Spinor fields and exterior algebra fields.
A Clifford algebra is linearly isomorphic to an exterior algebra, but there is, unfor-
tunately, no canonical isomorphism''; so we must stress the conventional character of
any particular isomorphism. The most 'natural' identification consists in the choice
of orthonormal frames, so that it becomes possible to speak of the homogeneous
components of a Clifford number; the transition functions of the tangent or cotan-
gent bundles have values in the orthogonal group and allow a linear identification of
the Clifford bundle and the exterior bundle.
But what about the amorphic spinor bundles and the exterior bundle? Can one
somehow identify a spinor field with an exterior algebra field?
If we consider an amorphic spinor field carrying the orthogonal (improper) rep-
resentation of the reduced group a., there is no problem, but we are confined to the
reduced group.
Physicists usually consider ordinary spinor fields carrying the faithful Pin(Q) or
Spin] Q) representation; after convenient reduction of the Pin(Q) group to a subgroup
H, the identification could be possible and coherent, but we will be restricted to the
group H (d. Chapters 11 and 14). With the Pin(Q) group, the identification between
ordinary spinor fields and elements of minimal left ideals, endowed with the faithful
representation of Pin( Q) by left multiplication, is not coherently possible.
The following example clarifies the situation : consider the space E3 •1 with prim-
itive idempotent e= HI + eo)(1 + ele2) (d. above), and the spinor :
'l/J = (a +f3eoe2 + -yele2 + beOel)e,
eo E Pin(Q), the improper orthogonal action of Pin(Q) gives :
eo'l/Jeo 1 = 'l/J,
(eo1 = eo),
eo'l/J = (a +-yeoele2)e
3There are infinitely many Kahler-Atiyah isomorphisms, cr. Chapter 3, 1.5.

PRIMITIVE IDEMPOTENTS AND AMORPHIC SPINOR BUNDLES.
293
and there is no equivariant action respecting the identification.
We summarize the situation as follows :
• The identification between Clifford algebra fields and exterior algebra fields is
convenient for orthonormal frames (different conventions lead to inextricable
checking).
• The identification between amorphic and ordinary spinor fields restricts us to
some spinoriality group and Pin(Q) or Spin( Q) spinors in the ordinary meaning
are not exterior form fields.
• A lot of spinoriality groups appear (or may appear) with amorphic spinor
bundles of which the existence conditions have no intrinsic topological meaning
for the manifold under consideration (a lot of covariance groups are possible in
the same algebraic context).
Finally, we examine the possible identification between the de Rham laplacian
and the Dirac laplacian.
We consider here the pseudo-riemannian cotangent bundle T*(V), (EOI.),
0: =
1, . . . ,n is a local orthonormal frame.
To the p-form B with components B0I.101.2...OI.P we associate the Clifford algebra field
and if we are working with a convenient amorphic spinoriality group the identification
extends to the spinors.
The checking of the Dirac laplacian is easier if we use the EOI. as the components
of the 'fundamental tensor-spinor' -y ('\1, = 0); if we introduce
EOI.'\10I.'l/J = P('l/J)
we easily obtain
[). is the Dirac laplacian.
But
EOI.'\10I.'l/J = EOI. 1\ '\1a'l/J +iEa('\10I.'l/J),
(iEa is the inner product) and according to an elementary result :
EOI.'\10I.'l/J = d'l/J - 6'l/J,
('\1 is a torsion-free connection) where d is the usual exterior derivative and 6 the
coderivative
because cJ.2 = 62 = o.

294
If we put D..DR = -(d5+5d), D..DR is the de Rham laplacian and
CHAPTER 20
where we can identify the spinor field 'if; with an exterior algebra field.
Remark 9.
There exists a close relation between this situation and some develop-
ments in electromagnetism theory where both laplacians are used. In [1, e] however,
we are using the isotropic approach instead of the idempotent approach and we have
a special case of the last situation by a translation of some results.
20.6
Epilogue.
It appears that amorphic spinor structures lead to many geometric difficulties, par-
ticularly if one uses primitive idempotent fields on manifolds. Mathematicians are
free to introduce and to study these intricate situations, but what about the mean-
ing of physical theories constructed from them ? Amorphic spinor fields possess a
'chaotic' and 'exotic' character. What is the advantage? Some people would like to
work with differential forms , and these are a really nice tool, but we have proved in
this paper that some identifications give rise to big obstacles; differential forms and
Pin( Q)-spinors are very different objects, both locally and globally, so we sho uld not
confuse them.
It is a very good idea to consider spinors as elements of minimal left ideals in
Clifford algebras, but as complex vector spaces are essential in physical theories, the
best point of view is to consider complexified vector spaces : then it is possible to
preserve particular properties coming from the signature (the converse is a popular
idea, but a wrong one, d . the author's theory of conjugation, Majorana spinors
and sesquilinear forms over spinor space [1, d], [1, g] and Chapter 10).
In this
complexified context the 'r-isotropic' method developed by the author is not only an
algebraic method but chiefly a geometric one : it gives a field of left ideals as in the
idempotent approach, but these spinor spaces are closely connected with coverings of
the principal tangent (or cotangent) frame bundles (any pseudo-riemannian bundle
will do).
Then the best definition of spinor structures in the wider sense can be
given .
If we want to obtain the real case, we introduce Majorana spinors covariant under
the Clifford group action (G-action) if p - q = 0,2(mod8), or under the special
Clifford group (G+) action if p - q = 0, 1,2,6,7 (mod 8) . (d. [1, g] and Chapter 10).
We then have the covariance according to the Lorentz action and the theory satisfies
the 'relativistic credo'.
Except if one admits the philosophical idea of a 'chaotic physics', it is reasonable
to drop the idempotent approach, but are physicists and mathematicians reasonable
people?

Complements.
20.7.1
a) We are looking for the anti-involutions, of the real algebra C( Q) which commute
with the orthogonal inner action of the Clifford group G, or some subgroup G1 of G,
if n = dim E is even.
\:Ig E G, \:Ix E C(Q) we have
,(gxg-1)= g,(X)g-l
,(x) = ,(g)g,(x)g-l,(g-l).
As ,(x) is any element y of the central algebra C(Q), necessarily ,(g)g E R*,
If we choose 9 = x E E, x2 #- 0, then x E G,
,(x)x = 1,
,(x) =
IJ-X,
,2 = Id implies ,(x) = ±1, so the eigenvalues of, are ±1. If ,(x) = x, \:Ix E E, we
obtain the involution {3. If,(x) = -x, \:Ix E E, we obtain the involution p.
If there exist two proper subspaces E1 , E2, eigenspaces for 1 and -1 :
x = Xl + X2,
Xi E Ei,
i = 1,2.
If , and 9 commute :
,g(X1)
=
g(X1)'
,g(X2)
=
-g(X2),
g(xd E E},
g(X2) E E2,
9 preserves E 1 and E 2 , but if 9 can be any element of G, this case is impossible.
In even dimension, there exists in C(Q) only the anti-involutions {3 and p com-
muting with the orthogonal action of G.
Nevertheless, if we consider a subgroup G1 whose elements preserve E1 and E2 , if
, preserves E, , commutes with the orthogonal action of G1 only if G1 is a subgroup
preserving the direct decomposition E = E1 Ell E2 and, reduces to {3 or pover each
E, (d. subsection 4.4 above).
Note that if we consider G+ C G, the preceding method fails (if x E G, z rt G+).
b) We are looking for, which commutes with the G+ action in C(Q), n = 2r.
C(Q) is simple, so any anti-involution is of the form:
,(x) = (3(bxb-1), se C*(Q),
and ,2 = Id implies (3(b) = ±b. The commutation with any 9 E G+ is equivalent to
bg = ±gb, 4 (we choose 9 E Spin(Q), one sees that the condition is admissible).
4Here we use {3(g) = ±g; notice that {3'(g) = ±g can be wrong if {3' is defined as in subsection
4.4 ! But {3'(g) = ±g does hold if 9 E G!.

296
Notice that if 9 is any element of G+,
bg = qb;

Hence bg = eqb, e = 1 or (-1), e is the same for any gj but bg = -gb is impossible

Remark.
Method b) also works in case a) and gives bx = -xb, x E E, x2 I- 0,
b = eu if b ~ R* .
If we choose b E C+(Q) with (3(b) = ±b, the subgroup G, of G given by the
set of 9 E G such that bg = ±gb, is the maximal subgroup of G commuting with
"I : "I(x) = (3(bxb-t ). For example, the {3' anti-involution subsection 4.4 corresponds
to b = ete2 " . ep, Gt preserves (et , e2,... , ep), hence also the orthogonal subspace

Hence the choice of b E C*(Q) determines the "I-commuting group Gt ; on the
contrary, the choice of Gt can determine several "I (cf. G+ above).

20.7.2
Now consider the odd-dimensional case, n = 2r + 1, and the simple central algebra
C+(Q), the anti-involutions '1 commuting with the action of G+.
f3 and fJ are identical, and we define another anti-involution '1 according to 'Y(x) =
f3(bxb-1). The case b) applies, but C+(Q) is central and b E R· .
In odd dimension, there exists in C+(Q) only the anti-involution f3 = fJ commut-
ing with the orthogonal action of G+.
The remark at the end of the first subsection extends naturally to the odd-
dimensional case.
20.7.3
We are looking for a pair b, e) of a primitive idempotent e and an anti-involution
'1, such that 'Y(e) = e for a given C(Q), n = 2r and E is a real space.
We put : f3( e) = beo:", 'Y(x) = f3( bxb-1)j 'Y2 ( x) = x implies
f3(b-1)bxb- 1f3(b) = x,
Vx E C(Q)
and the necessary condition
f3(b) = f(b),
f = ±1,
'Y(e) = f3(beb- 1)
but f3(e) = beb-1 implies e = f3(b-1)f3(e)f3(b) = f3(beb- 1) and 'Y(e) = e.
Conversely, if '1'(e) = e, '1' an anti-involution, there exists a b' E C'(Q) with
'Y'(x) = f3(b'xb,-l) , 'Y'(e) = e implies f3(b'eb,-l) = e and f3(e) = b'eb'-I, 'Y'2(X) = x
implies f3( b') = fb' and we can state :
Any anti-involution '1, such that 'Y(e) = e, is defined according to 'Y(x) =
f3( bxb- 1), if b satisfies f3( e) = beb"? with f3( b) = eb, f = ±l.
Moreover we have the remarkable property:
If there exists such a pair ('1, e), ('1',e') has the same property, if e' is any primitive
idempotent in C(Q).
e' = ueu- 1,
f3(ueu- 1) = f3(u- 1)f3(e)f3(u) = f3(u- 1)bu-1(ueu-1)ub-1f3(u),
f3(e') = b'e'b,-l
with b' = f3(u- 1bu-1u),
f3(b') = ff3(u- 1)bu-1 = eb",
'Y'(x) = f3(b'xb,-l),
'Y'(e') = e',
It is sufficient to examine a particular primitive idempotent el in C(Q). If f3(el) =
be1b-1 with f3(b) = eb, 'Y(el) = el and 'Y'(e') = e',

298
CHAPTER 20
Note that b such that f3( e) = beb-I is not unique.
The subgroup (proper or
improper) GI of Pin(Q) is defined according to the supplementary condition
bg = ±gb,
vs E GI .
It depends on b,b', . . . or on e, e', ... associated to 1,1', . . ..
If e belongs to Lounesto's list it is easy to see that f3'( e) = e. Then there exist l'
such that 1'(e') = e' for any idempotent e'.

SELF-DUAL YANG-MILLS FIELDS AND THE
PENROSE TRANSFORM IN THE SPINOR CONTEXT.
We use particular properties of spinor geometry in dimension 4, in order to give
a new approach for the introduction of self-dual connections in Yang-Mills theory
(instantons) and the Penrose transform. Our approach essentially uses pure spinors
and associated totally isotropic spaces; twistors are not employed.
Our method
shows that the Penrose transform is nothing but a far and rather hidden resurgence
of results of E. Cartan. We finally indicate a possible generalization of the instantons,
called by us 'spintantons', which is connected to our definition of the enlarged spinor
structures. Here we consider Coo structures only.

CHAPTER 21
If we consider a principal bundle with U(I) as a structural group over E1•3 and
a section x -+ u(x), then x -+ exp(icp(x)) . u(x) is also a section. If A defines a
connection w, the components A~, A", are related by
with 'If; = -icp. The curvature form is n = dw + ~[w,w] = dA and (1) , if J = 0,
can be expressed as d(*n) = 0 (* is the Hodge operator for the volume form 1}al3-(6 ) .
We can obtain (1) from a variational principle using the Lagrangian E = ~ F"'I3Fa13,
varying the A",.
The Yang-Mills fundamental idea was to change U(I) into SU(2).
More generally, one considers at present a principal bundle over the manifold V
(E1•3 or the Einstein space-time V1,3 as well) with structural group G, w is a principal
connection, with curvature form n.
If a, a' are two sections such that
a'(x) = a(x)g(x),
x E V,
g(x) E G,
then
w' = Ad (g-1)w +g-1dg,

Mathematicians often prefer to write
or
_~110112 + L(ep, D~ep) if another field ep interacts with O.
In the physicist's jargon : the connection becomes the 'gauge potential', the
curvature becomes the 'gauge field', G is the 'gauge group' and an isomorphism of
the principal bundle a 'gauge transformation'. If we choose different cross-sections,
a change of cross-sections is a 'gauge change'.
21.1.2
Self-dual and anti self-dual fields.
V is a Coo riemannian or pseudo-riemannian oriented manifold with n = 2k di-
mensions and N
(resp. r(N)) the bundle of p-forms (resp. the space of p-form
cross-sections). The star (or Hodge) operator * is defined by
where (oj(3) is the scalar product of the differential forms, TJ the n-volume form or
the orientation :

(modulo a normalization coefficient). We recall the classical results:
in the riemannian case,
in the pseudo-riemannian case,
where 1:1 = 1 if det 9 > 0 or (-1) if det 9 < O.
If k = 2, *2 = Id in the riemannian case and - Id in the minkowskian case, and
p = 2, giving the direct sum
corresponding to the spectral decomposition for the star operator.
The bundle 1\2 is the direct sum of self-dual and anti self-dual forms .
Note that * is conformally invariant.
It is then natural to consider connections with curvature form 0 such that *0 =
±O in the riemannian case, or *0 = ±iO in the minkowskian case.
The Y.-M.
condition D(*0) is then automatically satisfied, DO = 0 being the Bianchi identity.

CHAPTER 21
21.1.3
Instantons ([1, 5]).
Some physicists are interested in connections giving a lagrangian with compact sup-
port so that the action integral is always defined over any domain with boundary in
R 4 • Sending R 4 to S4 by stereographic projection, one considers a Coo vector bundle
(with complex rank r, base S4) associated to a principal bundle with group SU(r)
and provided with a connection whose curvature is self-dual : *n = n (self-dual
connection). This bundle is called an instanton. If *n = -n, the curvature is anti
self-dual. A change of orientation exchanges both cases.
It is difficult to find a physical meaning for such a scheme (a pseudo-particle ?)
except for changing t (the time), to it in the quadratic minkowskian form, but
unfortunately many topological difficulties arise from this algebraic modification.
Probably it would be better to consider the compactified Minkowski space isomorphic
to S3 x Z2 Sl and thus define the 'minkowskian instanton' over this last base (*n =
in).
A bundle with self-dual connection satisfies topological conditions, for example,
for a hermitian bundle the first Pontryagin number is positive ([1]).
With elliptic signature self-dual connections give an absolute minimum for the
Yang-Mills lagrangian : this property explains why, in spite of their artificial nature,
many people are interested in instantons.
21.2
The Penrose transform as a resurgence of Cartan's work.
Grosso modo the Penrose transform consists in the one to one association between an
instanton and a certain vector bundle over P3(C); usually the authors interested in
this subject rely their approach on the rather fancy notion called 'twistor' ([7]) and
use the Pauli-Dirac matrix formalism. This method appears rather as an intricate
and heavy artifice. As a matter of fact , in the modern frame, and according to the
ideas of E. Cartan ([2]), the Penrose transform is really like a far resurgence of the
important notions described in ([2, 3, 4a] and Chapter 8 above) and called 'pure
spinors '. In 4 and 6 dimensions any even or odd spinor is also a pure spinor ([4b])
and this remark is crucial for the following developments.
We choose the minkowskian signature, but our results are also valid for the elliptic
signature.
21.2.1
Pure minkowskian and conformo-minkowskian spinors and asso-
ciated spaces.
Our notations are like in the preceding paper [4b] and the chapters above.

uf = u+f + ti" f is a minkowskian spinor.
The maximal totally isotropic subspaces (m .t.i.s.)
attached to u+f and u- f
(pure spinors) respectively, are constituted by the set of points x E Eg such that
x(u+J) = 0 or x( u- J) = 0. Thus two families of m.t.i.s. appear (even and odd ones).
If
u- f = (axI +bX2)f
u+f = (a' + b'XIX2)f
the m.t.i.s. are defined, according to [4b], by

Two m.t.i.s. with different parity intersect and have an isotropic straight line in

The m.t.i.s. are bijectively attached to the pair of projective spinors represented
by (u-i, u+J) ; this pair bijectively defines a homogeneous straight line in Ef3' ([3,
4a] and Chapter 12 above).

It is easy to verify that £ is contained in the isotropic cone of E2,4 ; modulo a negligible
set this image represents the compactified Minkowski space isomorphic to Sl x Z2 S3.
v extends naturally to the complexified space Ef3' Im(v) becomes £1.
(71") defined by (5) is contained in Eg and its intersection with it corresponds to
0. ' = -1. We call (71"1) = 71" n f/, (71"1) is the set of points such that :
(7)
According to the isotropic transform the points of (71"1) arise from the points of a
totally isotropic affine plane in Ef3' called (71"2) and defined by
(8)
and the parallel homogeneous plane (71"3) by
Remark.
In these computations, we have assumed ao
~ O. If ao = 0, we can
assume that a3 ~ 0 and obtain analogous results; (9) becomes
Finally, after the choice of a frame in E2,4 and E1,3, the set i;+ constructed by
the projective even spinors for Ef4> that we can identify with the set of projective
spinors for Ef3' defines the space P3(C), and the points corresponding to ao = a3 = 0
constitute th~ space Pl(C).
We write O(P3(C)) = P3(C) \ P1(C)..
If we compare (9) and (4), we see that (71"3) is the more general even m.t.i.s. in
Ef3' and we obtain :
Proposition 21.2.1 After tbe choice of a frame in E1,3 and E2,4, we can associate
to any element of O(P3(C)) an even totally isotropic affine plane (71"1) in Ef4 and
an even totally isotropic affine plane (71"2) in Eg. Tbus O(P3(C)) is in one to one
correspondence witb tbe set of tbe even totally isotropic affine planes of Eg.
The same proposition holds for the odd planes.
Remark 2.
We shall use below the elementary remark that an even affine plane
in Ef3 is an equivalence class of pairs (X,71"3), X E Ef3> 71"3 an even m.t.i.s. in Ef3'
where (X, 71"3) and (x', 71"~) are equivalent if and only if 71"3 = 71"~ and X - x' E 71"3.

21.2.2
Self-dual connections and vector bundles.
We consider fibrations with a structural group acting effectively in the typical fiber.
Gt denotes the grassmannian of even m.t.i.s. in Ef3' The fundamental 4-form of
El ,3 is defined by the dual frame of (e., e2, e3, e4), w;itten
According to subsection 1.2 we say that a plane in Ef3' defined by a decomposable
2-form cf? is self-dual (resp. anti self-dual) if
'
*cf? = icf?
resp .
* cf? = -icf?
We write down that :
()l 1\ ()3 ~ ()4 1\ ()l ~ ()3 1\ ()l,
()3 1\ ()4 ~ ()2 1\ ()l ~ ()4 1\ ()3,
()4 1\ ()2 ~ ()3 1\ ()l ~ ()2 1\ ()4.
Proposition 21.2.2 Every even m .t.i.s. in Ef3 is anti self-dual. Every odd m.t.i.s.
in Ef3 is self dual.
Proof. Indeed, from (9),x is determined by the pair -a3x2 + aaYl, a3xl +aOY2, hence,
after a dual identification by the bivector :
cf?
=
i( a~ + a~)(()l 1\ ()2) + (a~ -
a~)(()l 1\ ()3) + 2aaa3(()l 1\ ()4)
+i( a~ - aD(()2 1\ ()4) + 2iaoa3(()2 1\ ()3) -
(a~ + a~)( ()3 1\ ()4)
defining the plane (7l'3)' *cf? = -icf? is immediate.
The same proof works with odd m.t.i.s.
Lemma 21.2.1 *n = in is equivalent to n null over any even m .t .i.s. (7l'3)'
•
Proof. We associate to (7l'3) a conjugate plane 7l'3, using a conjugation taking into
account the signature. It is easy to prove that 7l'3 and 7l'3 have the same parity. The
planes (7l'3) and (7l'3) carry a 'real Witt frame' and the computation of cf? above shows
that this form is a linear combination of
constituting an anti self-dual frame; supposing that n is null over (7l'3) is equivalent
to say that the three components of n over the anti self-dual frame are zero, then n
is a self-dual form.
•
Coming back to the fibration problems, we put in correspondence (x, 7l'3) E Ef3 x
Gt and () E O(P3(C)), () = cp(X,7l'3)' cp is only a surjective map; (0 being a vector
bundle with O(P3(C)) as a base, cp*(O is a bundle over Ef3 x Gt, with cp*(~) we

306
CHAPTER 21
can construct a bundle over Ef3 if and only if, for any points z, z' E 0(P3(C)),
z = cp(x, 71"3), z' = cp(x, 7I"~), the fibers at z deduced from
~z; and
~z;, are the same. It
is then easy to see that such a z' describes any right line from z if z is fixed . (0 is
trivial over any such line.
cp·(O restricted to Ef3 has a natural parallelism between z and x', if x - x' E 71"3,
for some even plane (71"3)'
According to standard results it is as much as to say
that there exists a connection with null curvature form along the even m.t .i.s. (71"3)'
According to Lemma (21.2.1), the curvature is self-dual.
We can state :
Proposition 21.2.3 A vector bundle over 0(P3(C )) inducing a trivial bundle over
any rigbt line defines also a vector bundle over Ef3 witb ibe same rank, baving a
self-dual connection and satisfying the Y .-M. condition.
Conversely, let (17) be a rank r complex vector bundle with structural group, over
Ef3' with a self-dual connection.
We call trivializing distinguished open set (U) of Eg an open set with a field of
even affine m.t.i.s. such that
When x describes (U) we can associate to it a point z E 0(P3(C)) and z describes an
open set (V) in 0(P3(C)). At z we construct ~z; isomorphic to the 17", fiber. Evidently
we need an identification between
~z; and
~z;, if
z = cp(X,7I"2(X)),
z' =
cp(x ,7I"~(x)) ,
the constructed bundle is trivial over any straight line.
If(x, 71"2(x )) and (x',7I"2(X')) give the same z, 71"3(x) = 7I"3(X') and x'-x E 7I"3(X), but
the self-dual connection has a curvature form n which vanishes over 71"3(x), and we can
identify 17", and 17",', the construction of the fiber at z is coherent. The differentiability
comes if we consider that we have a bundle over the set of equivalence classes (x, 71"3),
because 1/ is null over any even (71"3) and the classes are identified with the points of
0(P3(C)). Then :
Proposition 21.2.4 For any vector bundle, witb a structural group, and Ef3 base,
carrying a Y .-M. self-dual connection, we can associate a vector bundle over 0(P3 ( C))
witb tbe same rank; tbis bundle is trivial over any straight line.
Now we intend to prove that 0(P3(C)) can be replaced by P3(C) in Propositions
(21.2.3) and (21.2.4).
Indeed, let uri j =I 0 be a pure spinor, it is always possible to find an open set
(0) in the space of projective spinors, which contains uri j and such that (0) is

SELF-DUAL YANG-MILLS FIELDS AND THE PENROSE TRANSFORM
307
in bijective correspondence with an open set (Od in EPa x Gt. To show this, we
determine a new Witt frame, taking
ao then becomes
i = 0,1,2,
(10)
and because the ai, i = 1,2,3 are not all zero we can obtain a~ # O.
This change of frames can be interpreted as a transformation by an element 'Y
belonging to the reduced special Clifford group G';j = exp(t\2F), F = (xo, Xl, X2)
(d. [4a) and Chapter 8, 1.2),
because G't is in the connected component of a spinoriality group ([4a)) . 'Y trans-
forms a neighborhood (0) of urij with ao = 0 into an open set 0 1 where the new
coefficient ao is different from O.
If (e) is a vector bundle (with a structural group) over P3(C), naturally associated
to a principal bundle, the construction of cp·(e) above is independent of the choice of
a frame, modulo the change (10) : because this change replaces cp·(O by cp·b·(O),
where 'Y. is a principal bundle isomorphism. However, constructing a bundle over all
of P3(C), coming from the bundle (1/) above (d. the proof of Proposition (21.2 .4))
requires the gluing of bundles obtained over the four open sets corresponding to
ao # 0 or, if ao = 0, a; # 0, i = 1,2,3; if, for example, a2 # 0 in a point of P3(C)
reached within two frames Ro (ao # 0) and R, (al # 0) we have to change simply
the coordinates of C 4 x (Gt), Xl for (ao + a~alXl)/ao, X2 for (ao + a~alX2)/ao,
Yl for yl and y2 for y2 (in (11) a~ # 0, a~ = a~ = 0). This yields the gluing iso-
morphism. Finally, the bundles being considered through some covariant, permitted
isomorphismsf we can state :
Theorem 21.2.1 There is a natural one to one correspondence between :
1. complex vector bundles with structural group, base P3(C), trivial over every
line of P3(C), and
2. bundles with the same rank over Ef3 having a self-dual connection.
Remarks.
a) With the euclidean space E4 and Ep, nothing changes in these developments,
except for the definition of the self-dualty (*n = n instead of *n = in). Theorem
2Some authors, forgetting these peculiarities, have caused confusion.

308
CHAPTER 21
(21.2.1) holds in the euclidean case. It is the same over the E2•2 space with neutral
signature, but in that case we can define real spinors directly and consider P3(R)
instead of P3(C).
b) A bundle over Ef3 is also a bundle over EI •3 x EI •3, we can then consider bundles
over E I ,3 (or E4 ) in Theorem (21.2.1).
Now we have :
Theorem 21.2.2 There is a natural one to one correspondence between :
1. complex vector bundles with structural group, base P3(C), trivial over the real
lines of P3 ( C) and
2. bundles with the same rank over S3 x SI (or S4) having a self-dual connection.
Proof. The proof uses stereographic projection, it is almost the same for both cases:
choose for example S4. By means of two stereographic projections epl and ep2 with
antipodal centers, one puts over S4 an atlas with two charts UI and U2 , each U,
diffeomorphic to a topological disk of R4 . If there exists over R4 a Y.-M. bundle
with self-dual curvature, there corresponds to it two bundles 6 and 6 with the same
property over UI and U2 , because epl and ep2 are conformal transformations. 6 and
6 have isomorphic restrictions to UI nU2 , a gluing method allows to obtain a unique
bundle ~ over S4 with the stated property.
I
Remark.
According to a) in the previous remark, we have the same result with
S2 x S2 and P3(R).
Proposition (21.2.4), Theorems (21.2.1) and (21.2 .2) express the Penrose trans-
form [5] with smooth hypotheses only.
Often the rank of the bundle (0 is two and the structural group is SU(2, C).
Evidently, any reduction of the structural group gives more particular structure
for the corresponding bundle over P3(C) : starting from SU(2, C) one obtains a
quaternionic structure over the fibers ([1, 5]).
21.2.3
Spintantons.
'Spintanton' is coined for spin-instanton. Suppose that the curved space-time ori-
ented manifold Vl,3 has an enlarged spinor structure. If the complexified tangent
space Tc(Vl,3) has a field of even m.t.i.s., Vl.3 satisfies our previous hypothesis and
conversely ([4a, 4c] and Chapter 14,4.1).
Let (U) be an open set in VI ,3 trivializing the tangent bundle and let a be the
associated spinoriality projective bundle (fibers of the enlarged spinor bundle are
minimal ideals in the tangent Clifford algebra and define projective complex space in
three dimensions). It is always possible to increase the tangent bundle by means of
a trivial bundle with complex rank 1, giving again in every fiber Eg an immersion

Suppose we also have over V1•3 a vector bundle TJ with structural group G acting
effectively on it . We locally reobtain the situation described in Propositions (21.2.3)
and (21.2.4).
On account of the equ ivariance of the spinor group action and the
special Lorentz group action which transforms even m.t.i.s. into one another, we can
associate to the bundle (TJ ) with self-dual connection a complex bundle (0 over the
projective enlarged spinor bundle (a). Bundle (e) will be trivial over any subset of a
identifiable to some U x D , where D is a straight line in P3(C)-an intrinsic property
because the spinor group acts linearly in the spinor space-and where U is an open
trivializing set, homeomorphic with a pseudo-euclidean disk.
It is clear that the results hold for any riemannian or pseudo-riemannian manifold
in four dimensions, admitting an enlarged spinor structure.
Definition 21.2.1 We sball call 'spintanton' any G-complex vector bundle (TJ) over
a manifold in four dimensions (V4, V1,3, V2,2' 113,1) baving an enlarged spinor structure
and carrying a G-self-dual connection.
Hen ce its properties are described by the geometry of certain vector bundles over
an enlarged spinor bundle of typical fiber P3(C).
It is very well known that spheres have strict spinor structures, but there exists
an important peculiarity : indeed 5 4 has a unique class of enlarged spinor structures,
because it is possible to construct over 54 a global field of m.t.i.s. in Tc (V4 ) . The
enlarged spinor bundle is identifiable with P3(C) x 54. The same property holds for
53 x 51, because T( 53 x 51) is trivializable and also for 52 x 52 because 52 is carrying
a global field of isotropic directions ([4, d] and Chapter 14, 6.1) .
Finally, a 'spintanton' over 54, 53 x 51, 52 X 52 reduces to an instanton, proving
the soundness of the generalization.
The situation is particularly simple for a space-time V1•3 admitting a strict spinor
structure because T(V';,3) is parallelizable and again a bundle over P3(C) appears,
corresponding to a self-dual connection.
Spintantons over V';,3 and the associated bundle over a clearly have a physical
meaning.

SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES, COMPLEX
STRUCTURES, SYMPLECTIC SPINORS AND THE
FOURIER TRANSFORM.
22.1
Introduction.
We have directed our attention to the problems raised by the Fourier transform on
curved symplectic manifolds. The generalization of the remarkable tool offered by
this transform in R" to such manifolds is awkward and leads to the difficulty known
as the 'Maslov class' or 'index'. It appears that a geometrization of this transform
is required before it can be turned into a global tool. In the process, the complex
structure J adapted to the symplectic form and to an associated pseudo-riemann-
ian form will prove to be closely linked with the Fourier transform, which can be
identified, up to some constant factor, with the lifting j of J to a symplectic spin
group. Then the geometrization can be carried out at once , if a few conditions, which
hold in all usual cases, are sat ified; the geometric Fourier transform is the natural
action of j on the symplectic spinors.
The 'nice' geometric properties of the Fourier transform can then easily be ex-
plained, along with their relation to the Heisenberg group and algebra, as was pointed
out already by many authors, and especially by R. Howe ([3]). We give some examples
of computations carried out using this approach (the laplacian, the Hermite func-
tions, Heeke's formula, covariance problems). But this method seems most promising
in the setting of geometric quantization, when applied to the deformation of Poisson
algebras.
We have concentrated our effort on the algebraic and geometric aspect rather than
on those problems that seemed closer to analysis, leaving them to the specialists;
we will only indicate the relation with functional spaces, distribution theory and
differential operators-several of these could lead to important extensions which the
reader may carry out.

Elementary notions.
Let E be a real (2r)-dimensional vector space with a symplectic form F. The endo-
morphism J of E satisfies J2 = -1 and endows it with a complex structure.
Definition 22 .2.1 J is said to be adapted to F in signature (p, q), p + q = r, if
there exists a non-degenerate Hermitian Form TJ : E x E
---t C of signature (p, q),
such that F = - im(TJ).
Writing TJ(x,y) = re(TJ(x,y))+i im(TJ(x,y)), we see that (x,y) ---t -im(TJ(x,y)) is
a symplectic form on E and that (x,y) ---t re(TJ(x,y)) is a symmetric quadratic form
of signature (2p, 2q).
Note that re(TJ(ix,y)) = -im(TJ(x,y)) = F(x,y), re(TJ(x,y)) = -F(Jx,y) and
TJ(x,y) = -F(Jx,y) - iF(x,y) or, more simply,
re(TJ(x,y)) = (x,y)
where
(Jx, y) = F(x, y),
(Jx, Jy) = (x,y),
F(Jx, Jy) = F(x, y),

and J is orthogonal and symplectic.
A maximal totally isotropic subspace of E (for the symplectic form F) is said to
be legrengien; such a space must have real dimension r.

metric (., -): if J is adapted to F, J(L) is a supplementary lagrangian of L and is
orthogonal to it .

Proposition 22.2.2 Let E = L EEl L', where Land L' are lagrangians and 9 is a

Jon L, adapted to F For the signature (p,q) and such that J(L) = L' and that the
restriction to L of the hermitian Form with imaginary part given by (-F) is g.
Ptooi. If J exists, 9 is transported to L' by the isometry J, so that L' is orthogonal to
L; then necessarily F(x,y) =g(Jx,y), Vx,y E E; hence J(x) follows from F(x,y) =
g(Jx,y), J2 = -1 will hold and we will take TJ(x,y) = g(x,y) - iF(x,y) for J to be
adapted to F in the signature (p,q).

In practice, we consider a symplectic basis (e"" e/3')' 0.,(3 = 1,2, . . . , r, adapted
to the decomposition E = L EEl L' and such that
F( e"" eW) = 5"'/3,
F( e"" efJ) = F( e"" ,fJ') = 0,

F(Jea,eW) = -g(ea,ef3') = 0, hence Jea E L'.

Jea = ea',

By Proposition (22.2.2), a symplectic space E can be constructed with J adapted to
F in the signature (p,q) j given L, the choice of L' determines L uniquely. Proposition
(22.2.1) shows that if L is an arbitrary lagrangian which is non-isotropic for (-,. ),
an orthogonal basis (el' e2, . .. , er ) can be chosen in L and completed with elements
(el" e2', . . . , er · ) to a symplectic basis which is adapted to the decomposition E =
J EB J(L).
Note that U(p,q) is the set of elements of Sp(2r,R) which commute with J; it
is also the set of elements of O(2p,2q) with determinant 1 which commute with J,

As in our previous articles and works, we introduce several symplectic Clifford alge-
bras. h being an indeterminate (but we may interpret it up to a constant factor, as
the physicist's Planck constant), we take the quotient of the tensor algebra over the
module
E' = E 0 K K[[h]],
K = R or C,

by the two-sided ideal generated by the elements
x@y-y@x- hF(x,y),
x,y E E .
CHAPTER 22
This gives us the associative algebra Cs(hF) (also called a Weyl algebra), which will
be 'enlarged' in several ways :
• Cs(hF), whose general element is a formal series in the powers of e""
e~.,
0., f3 = 1,2, . . . ,r, with coefficients in K [[hJ), called the formal symplectic Clif-
ford algebra. We will also use the field K((h)) of rational fractions.
• Cs(hF)"', for which h is fixed and the general element is
where 0. is a real number, 0. > 0, Hand K* are multi-indices,
IHI = L: hi, H! = h1!h2!•••hr !, the hi being non-negative integers, and from a
certain rank onwards,
IM(H, K*)! ~ o-(u)p(u)IHI+IK'I,
where 0-(u) and p(u) are positive constants.
• Cs(hF)T' the truncated algebra, obtained as the quotient of Cs(hF) by the
ideal of multiples of hN , where N is a fixed positive integer, N > 1j the
coefficients of its elements are polynomials in h of degree not exceeding (N -1).
When h is fixed, the truncated algebras give rise to algebras whose elements are
series with coefficients in K ; if h is then understood to be 'very small', we obtain the
viewpoint of non-standard analysis.
If a E E, t E K, for all z E E,
exp(ta 2)x exp( -ta2 ) = x + 2htF(a, x)a
where exp(ta2 ) can be considered as an element of Cs(hF), Cs(hF)T or Cs(hF)'T.
We have previously introduced the symplectic spinors as a projective limit of a
sequence of left ideals. This can be done for each of the algebras defined here.
The spaces of symplectic spinors are constructed starting from a symplectic basis
(e"" ep.) and can be linearly identified with a symmetric algebra over the space of e""
0. = 1, ... ,r , where the meaning varies according to the chosen symplectic Clifford
algebra.

SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES AND THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
315
For the sequel, it is advantageous to consider a space of symplectic spinors as the
quotient of the symplectic Clifford algebra by the left ideal generated by the (eao),
the representation being the left multiplication followed by the quotient.
This convention allows us to identify the multiplication by eao with (-h8/8qa ),
and ea with s", replacing (ea)k by (qa)k, qa being a coordinate variable; these iden-
tifications follow from
This convention leads us to interpret the Clifford algebra Cs(hF) as the 'Weyl alge-
bra' of differential operators with constant coefficients, for a space RT E9 (RT)*, the
symplectic spinors becoming series in the symplectic algebra of RT.
The defining conditions of Cs(hF)a will then ensure the analyticity and , for
O! > 1/2, we obtain functions with rapidly decreasing derivatives. Note that these
function spaces are also algebras.
22.4

subgroup onto the symplectic group, we can prove that

by aafJo = _afJa o . Writing
We have proved :

CHAPTER 22
Proposition 22.4.1 The Lie algebra of O(p,q) is isomorphic to the set of linear
combinations with pure imaginary (resp. real) coefficients of the EoEf3' -
Ef3Eo ' (resp.
of the Xf3eoef3' - Xoef3eo ' ) '
A simple computation in the symplectic Clifford algebra yields :

it is easy to verify that

[U, V] = -W,
[U, W] = -2U,
[V, W] = 2V.
Hence we obtain the Lie algebra of 8L(2 , R) and we can state :
(3)
Proposition 22.4.2 The U, V , W defined by (3) are the elements of a basis for the
Lie algebra of a subgroup of 8p(2r,R) which is isomorphic to 8L(2, R) (or 80(2, 1))i
the elements of the connected component of the identity in O(p,q) commute with
this subgroup.
Hence O(p,q) and 8L(2, R) form a pair of subgroups in 8p(2r, R) such that each
one is the centralizer of the other, a well-known result (d. [3]).

Proposition (22.4.2) can be related to the following well-known property : every
symplectic space (E, F) of dimension 2r, with a complex structure J adapted to Fin
the signature (p,q), p+q = r, can be (non-uniquely) identified with the tensor pro-
duct of a two-dimensional symplectic space and an r-dimensional pseudo-euclidean
space with a metric of signature (p,q).

The U, V, W correspond to the Lie algebra of Sp(2, R) 0 ra, = SL(2,R) 0 Idr

explanation for the commutation properties expressed in Proposition (22.4.2).

Hence J is obtained by P from exp( -(pi/2)(U +V)) and we have the :

If we use h/(27ri) in (1), -i7r 2(U + V) becomes (-i7r 2/ h)(U + V),
(-7ri/4)(27rp2 - 1:::./(27r» becomes (-7ri/4h)(27rp2 - h21:::./(27r» and h2/(27r 2 ) replaces

formula (1) of 22.2.

320
CHAPTER 22
Convergence problems in this setting may be tackled using an algebra Cs(hF)'" or
truncation modulo hN ; such computations arise in the Maslov method of stationary
phase and are most interesting for applications to physics.
By the remark at the end of section 2, we see that if a > 1/2, using a Taylor
expansion, our definition of the Fourier transform on the symplectic spinors coincides
exactly with the classical definition in the set of analytic functions represented by
series in Cs(hF)'" (e", is replaced by q"').
Another generalization consists in the replacement of R" EEl (Rr). by the cotan-
gent bundle to a real r-dimensional manifold with a pseudo-riemannian structure of
signature (p,q), p+ q = r, M = T·(V) has a canonical symplectic structure if J is a
complex structure in the sense of Definition (22.5.1), its existence can be verified as
in Proposition (22.2.2), since there exist global fields of supplementary lagrangians
on T·(V) , the structural group of the cotangent bundle reducing to U(p, q), and in
this case, even to O(p,q), g"'13· f",f13. has a global meaning, just as

in the symplectic Clifford algebra of M.
If symplectic spinor fields related to the real symmetric algebra of V can be
defined, (a sufficient condition for this is the existence of a field of real oriented
lagrangians, d . [1, b] and Chapter 18), restricting T·(V) to V we will consider a
function in COO(V) (given locally as f(ql, . .. .v» and associate a sheaf cpU) of
enlarged symmetric algebras to it by the following natural procedure :
At every point x E V we construct a formal series in the algebra VT;(V) whose
terms are the symmetrized covariant derivatives for a torsion-free symplectic connec-
tion (d. [1] and Chapter 19). This sheaf of symmetric algebras is also a symplectic
Clifford algebra sub-sheaf, hence a symplectic spinor sub-sheaf. i, (or jh) is a sec-
tion of the symplectic Clifford algebra sheaf acting naturally by left multiplication
on cpU) :
7l't(p - q)
-
cpU) ~ exp(

)J1 . cpU)
is a global formal Fourier transform if we restrict ourselves to the algebras Cs(hF).
If non-isomorphic symplectic spinor structures exist on M , we will obtain dif-
ferent global Fourier transforms, and the set of these global Fourier transforms is
parametrized by H1(M, Z2), whose elements are just the Maslov classes, modulo Z2
(d. [1, b] and Chapter 18).
Clearly, if we replace the Sp2(r) symplectic spinor structures by the SPq(r) struc-
tures or by the metaplectic structures, a Zq-valued or even 5 1-valued Maslov index
will arise ([1, b]).
The difficulties related to the Maslov index appear as soon as one wants to 'glue'
the classical Fourier transforms, which are particular local expressions of the global
transform just defined and whose existence depends on that of a symplectic spinor

SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES AND THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
321
structure for T*(V)-their existence is guaranteed if supplementary fields of real ori-
ented lagrangians can be defined (the reduction of the structural group to SO(p,q)).
Summarizing the principal results:
Proposition 22.5.2 If, over a real r-dimensional manifold V with pseudo-riemann-
ian struct ure of signature (p, q) (p+q = r), symplectic spinor fields for the cotangent
bundle T*(V) with a complex structure J adapted to the metric can be defined,
there exist generalized global formal Fourier transforms which are obtained by the
left multiplication (modulo exp(7fi(p - q)/4)), by a lifting i, of J in the symplectic
spinor sheaf for every function f E Coo.
Note that this transform is no longer formal if the sheaf associated to f is, for
instance, in the algebra
Cs(hF)~ at every point x. Then we completely recover ,
locally, the classical interpretation, if Q > 1/2.
Remarks.
1. If the polynomial e27fx\ dn / dx n ) ( e-2n 2), x being a real variable, is called the
nIh degree Hermite polynomial, it will be naturally related to
in the space of symplectic spinors, relying on the correspondence principle.
The same holds for exp( 47fU)P(ea - ) exp( -47fU) where P( ea - ) stands for
which is associated to
the set of all e-
7f(x ,x)P ( x) is total in .cb(Rr) ([2]), it is constructed from the
exp(-27fU) exp(47fU)jP( ea)j-l exp( -47fU) = exp(27fU)P(ea - ) exp] -47fU)
applying the correspondence principle.
So our approach immediately explains these results; we will say more about
this later. We can also understand now why, using symplectic spinors, we are
able to recover all the essential algebraic properties of the Fourier transform.
2. In this setting, we could also try to reobtain some integral transforms having
an inversion property and a Parseval-Plancherel theorem.
We will replace i, by an element of the symplectic Clifford algebra, and, more
precisely, by an element, of the group Sp2(r).

322
CHAPTER 22
The commutation with the action of O(p,q) will in general be lost, but the
inversion property and the Parseval-Plancherel theorem will be preserved, for
if'Y E 8p2(r), 13(1), = 1.
Nevertheless, we will not necessarily obtain an
integral transform (this, in fact, may already occur for elements in the covering
of 8L(2, R) ([6, p. 198])).
The refinement of these results offers an interesting research subject.
3. The action of the symplectic Clifford algebra on spinor space corresponds to
that of a set of differential operators. The elements of the symmetric algebra
generated by the (ea.) correspond to constant coefficient differential operators.
22.6
Bilinearity and sesquilinearity.
The 'symplectic spin' Parseval-
Plancherel theorem.
Consider the symplectic spinors, whose space is linearly isomorphic to the symmetric
algebra of the ea, a = 1, . . . ,r . They correspond to the Schrodinger representation.
We will consider either Cs(hF)ip' or Cs(hF)aip' , depending on the interest in the
formal case .
13 being the main antiautomorphism satisfying f3lEc = i Id, we write symbolically,
in terms of double classes :
ipf3(u )vip' = ipB( uip , vip' )ip'
(1)
where the uip, vip' have real or complex coefficients. B(uip ,vip') is a scalar? since
we take the quotient by the (ea.) to the right and by the (ea ) to the left . The scalar
result is in K[[h]] or in C depending on whether the algebra used is formal or not.
It is easy to see that :
B(eH"ip,eKip') = 0
if
H t K,
B(eH"ip,eHip*) = (-ih)IHIHL
A duality between the space of ip spinors and the space of ip* spinors appears here.
Note that the convergence conditions on vip* E Cs(hF)aip* can be satisfied for
elements such that uip tf. Cs(hF)aip*, e.g. uip = expt(e-y.)2ip, which act as 'distribu-
tions' in relation to them.
It will prove interesting to define a positive definite hermitian sesquilinear 'form';
we choose h = 1/(27ri) because we want to compare with a Fourier transform, but
then it is better to set
2In fact, on a manifold, it is a density of weight 1.

the elements Eo., Eo.' are 'real' and have the multiplication table
There exists an obvious isomorphism between the symplectic Clifford algebras con-
structed over the (es) and those constructed over the (Ek ) , so that we consider the
symplectic Fourier transform determined by the multiplication by exp( 71"i(p - q)/ 4)i1
where t. is obtained from
J is adapted to F in the signature (p,q), F(Eo.,E[:3') = oo.[:3/(47f),
F(Eo., J Eo.) = ~;,
etc.
Let (3 be the main antiautomorphism deduced from
the symplectic spinors being determined by the (Eo.).
We will write
(3(u<J!*) = <J!(3(u),
(3(u<J!*) = <J!(3(u),
where :-stands for the complex conjugate. We form
(2)
1-£(u<J!* ,v<J!*) is a scalar and it is easy to verify that
1-£(eH <J!' , eK <J!*) = 0,
if
K 1= H,
1-£(eH<J!*,eH<J!*) = IhJlHIH!.
1-£ is positive definite hermitian sesquilinear. It is invariant under all elements of
the group Sp2(r) and, in particular, under t. (the symplectic Parseval-Plancherel
theorem).
Note that the exponential elements exp ta 2 , exp tb2 can, for certain values of t,
lead to divergent series for Band 1-£ if h is a complex number; in that case formal
series in h must be considered; h being a pure imaginary indeterminate for the (ek)
or a real indeterminate for the (Ek ) .
Important remark.
We could have chosen the symplectic spinors constructed
with the E;:; or with the E;;, where

(4)
which determine a Lie algebra isomorphic to that of 5L(2, C) or 50(3,1) (or the
Lorentz group). Note that X, Y, Z are linear combinations of L",(e",)2, L",(e",.)2
and L",(e",e",.).
Let us construct a spinor space over the symmetric algebra of the (E",) (which
correspond to the Bargmann-Fock representation). If we want to easily compare our
results with the classical Fourier transform, we choose h = -1/(21r), the correspon-
dence principle assign the product by qa to E;:; and the derivation

to (E;;).
The Fourier transform then corresponds, up to a constant factor, to the action
of exp[-(i1r/4)(21rp2 - 6/(41r))] on the space of polynomials in q"', or to the left

To have a Parseval-Plancherel theorem, we must replace J1 by ]1 (J1
IS the
transform of ]1 under e", --+ E,;, e",. --+ E;;).
1-£ clearly is invariant under the action of the symplectic spin group 5p2(r).

SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES AND THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
325
Finally, we see that from the geometric standpoint, we could define a spin Fourier
transform by the product with the lifting j of the complex structure (modulo an
isomorphism of the symplectic Clifford algebra which , restricted to the spinors, is an
isometry for the hermitian sesquilinear forms associated to their spaces , which may
differ) . We know that j commutes with the elements of the lifting of the unitary
group U(p, q).
Remark.
If we consider two arbitrary symplectic spinor spaces with general ele-
ments uq.i and uq.* (associated to some Ea or Ea' constructed, as before, from real
elements similar to ea, ea')' we can easily define a sesquilinear form on their pro-
duct : the transitive action of the symplectic group on the set of lagrangian subspaces
reduces this problem to the previous case. The ambiguity of the symplectic trans-
formation associating two given lagrangians does not cause any serious problems
because the introduced sesquilinear forms correspond to each other under the action
of Sp2(r). In the literature, equivalent computations are known as 'pairing' ([5]).
22.7
The laplacian and the symplectic geometry.
We once again put h = 1. L: Xa( ea. )2 corresponds to the laplacian b.. (generalized
to the signature (p, q)) when its action on the symplectic spinors, interpreted as
polynomials in s", a = 1, . . . , r, is considered.
Taking the exponential, -y = exp(L: Xa(ea' )2t) is a symplectic transvection and
b..uq.* = 0 is equivalent to -yuq.* = uq.* for all t E R .
Indeed, -yuq.* = uq.* implies
from which, taking the derivative at the identity,
(L: Xa( ea' )2U- u L:Xa(ea' )2)q.*
0,
L:Xa(ea' )2Uq.*
O.
Conversely, if L Xa( ea' )2u q.* = 0, -yuq.* is constant, but for t = 0, -y(0) = 1 and the
result follows. Hence :
Proposition 22 .7.1 The harmonic symplectic spinose uq.* are the invariant spinors
under the natural action of the one-parameter group

CHAPTER 22
Remark. If we consider any second order constant coefficient differential operator
(in the {)/ {)qO)
L: A0,8
{)2
{)qo{)q,8,
the same property obviously holds for the one parameter symplectic transformations
subgroup
t --. exp[(L: A°,8eo.e,8. )t].
0,{3
Consider the quotient of the algebra Cs(hF) by the two-sided ideal (S) generated
by (2:(eo ·)2- 1).
Every homogeneous polynomial in the (es-) can be written as
which, iterated, gives
where Po, Ps ,P2 , P3 , •• . cannot be divided by 2:(eo•)2.
Applying -y(1) = exp 2:( eo·)2 to Pi ( es-) by
then taking the quotient by S, we see at once that Pi(Eo . ) is invariant under -y(l),
because -y(l) = 1 modulo S .
We have obtained, in very little time, a classical result on the decomposition of
polynomials in terms of harmonic factors Pi ( qO) and of 2:(qO)2 (d. [2]). In particular,
if qO is real (taking q = 0), the restriction to the unit sphere sn-l of a polynomial
in n variables is equal to the restriction of some harmonic polynomial.
The symplectic spinors obtained in the quotient algebra by S are Fourier series
in T variables, when eo. is replaced by q",
Clearly this will also hold for the symplectic spinors constructed with the (fo, fo. ),
the reasoning being the same.
The above remark allows us to give a meaning to the notion of Fourier series on
a quadric.
Remarks.
1. We also see that the norm obtained from K is not the usual Hilbert space norm
on L2, since the (eH <1>.) do not form an orthonormal basis in this space.
2. ['j. is self-adjoint for K : this follows at once from the interpretation of ['j. as
2: eo· (up to a real coefficient).

SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES AND THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
327
3. 6. being self-adjoint for K, a classical reasoning shows that every symplectic
spinor can be decomposed as utI>" = v<I>" + 6.(w<I>"), where v<I>" is harmonic.
Recalling the interpretation of 6., we know that every polynomial in the (e",.)
is of the form
where Po(e",) is harmonic, and we reobtain the property established just before
using S .
Now we will apply the correspondence principle e", -+ s", e",. -+ -
8~a (h = 1) to
study some invariance and covariance problems for the laplacian.
Consider the elements (G) :
{
X",e",ef3' - Xf3 ef3e",.,
Eo: eae Q
.
)
e Q .
)
! 'L'"X"'( e",)2e-y. - X-ye-y 'L-y(e",e",.) = tI>-y,
(infinitesimal rotations)
(infinitesimal homotheties)
(infinitesimal translations)
(infinitesimal accelerations)
each of which corresponds to an element from (G') :
{
- q"'X",(8/ 8qf3 ) + qf3Xf3(8/8q"') = qf3(8/8q"') - q",(8/8qf3),
-q"'(8/ 8q"'),
-8/8q"',
'L'"q-yq"'(8/8q"') - ! 'L""t3 g"'f3q",qt3(8/8q-Y).
It is easy to verify directly that the elements of G form a Lie algebra such that
(G') is a 'representation' of it in terms of vector fields in RT, with a metric of signature
(p,q).
The Lie algebra of the complete conformal group Gp,q can be recognized.
6. is 'represented' by 'Lx",(e",.)2.
We already noted that
so the laplacian is invariant for the Lie algebra of infinitesimal isometries.
Then
'"
'"
is a covariance property of 6. under homotheties; finally, the 'accelerations' give
which is a covariance property only when r = 2.

328
CHAPTER 22
22.8
Some other applications.
As examples, and to illustrate particular advantages of our approach, we will prove
some results which, in the literature, are established using analytical techniques.
First take h = 1/(27ri) (and the spinors constructed on the symmetric space of
the (ea), all Xa being 1).
Lemma 22 .8.1 The natural action of exp( -7r l:(ea)2t) = exp(-27rU)t sends ea' to
ea" - 27rhie., = ea' + ite a .
Proof. Just compute
I
Taking t = 1, ea' becomes ea' + iea = V2€a'.
P being a real homogeneous
harmonic polynomial of degree k, we will prove Heeke's formula:
Note that if we order by ea " , ea ,
(recall that P(ea") stands for P(el' , e2', . . . , er • )), modulo terms in (ea"y.( ea)1' (no
term involving the (ea') only, of degree less than k, occurs on the right-hand side
because P is harmonic (Proposition (22.7.1))).
On the other hand, the acti on of exp(27rUt) extends to an algebra automorphism
and hence
exp(27rUt)P(ea")exp(-27rUt) = P(e a • - ite a ) ,
P( ea') exp(-27rUt) = exp( -27rUt)(P(ea') +(-it)kP( ea) + R(ea, e(3.))
where R(ea , e{3') = Q( ea ) , deg Q < k, modulo a left multiple of the e: ,
But Q(ea ) vanishes identically, for if we consider the algebra antiautomorphism ex-
tending ea -+ ea", ea" -+ ea,
P being real.

SYMPLECTIC STRUCTURES AND THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
329
If a Q(eo) occured in P(ea. - ieo), a term involving only the (ea.) and of the
same degree as Q(eo) would appear in P(eo - ieo')' relying on by the exchange of
eo and ea., and this was proved impossible before . Hence
P( ea.) exp(-27rU)<[>'
]1P( ea· )]11] 1exp(-27rU)<[>'
exp(-7rir/4)P( eo) exp(-27rU)<[>'
P( eo) exp(-27rU)<[>'
(-i)kP( eo) exp( -27rU)<[>'
=
(_ i)k]IP( eo) exp( -27rU)<[>' ,
(i)k]I P(eo) exp( -27rU)<[>',
(i)kF(P(eo) exp( -27rU)<[>')
which is the stated equality.
The Fourier transform of Hermite functions (q = 0).
We consider symplectic
spinors of the form
exp(27rU)P(ea.) exp( -47rU)<1>-
where P is homogeneous of degree k,
exp(27rU)P(ea.) exp( -27rU)
P(ea. - ieo)
=
P( - i(eo + ieo' ))
(-iv/2)kP(fa.) .
Multiplying by ]1,
(1)
(-iv2)k]IP(fa.) exp(-27rU)<[>'
(_iy'2)k]IP(fa.)kI] 1exp( -27rU)<[>'
=
(_iy'2)k( _i)k P(fa.) exp(-27rU)<[>'
= (_i)kP( ea. - ieo) exp(-27rU)<[>'
(_i)k P( ea. - ieo) exp(27rU) exp( -47rU)<1>'
(_i)k exp(27rU)P(ea.) exp( -47rU)<1>·.
hence
F(exp(27rU)P(ea.) exp(-47rU)<[>') = (_i)k exp(27rU)P(ea.) exp( -47rU)<[>' ,
which yields, in accordance to the classical result,
where hk is the k'h Hermite function.
Taking into account (1) and the expression of our symplectic spinors, we easily
deduce that the only symplecticspinors which are invariant under the Fourier trans-
form are of the form exp(27rU)Q(ea.) exp( -47rU)<[>' , where Q(ea.) is a formal series
(which may converge) consisting of even terms only : the set of even Hermite func-
tions (i.e. k is even) therefore 'generates' the complex space of invariant functions
under the Fourier transform.
Clearly, if k is odd, we obtain functions which undergo a sign change (this is the
spectral decomposition of F, given that F 2 = Id) .

330
In the notations of the remarks in section 5,
:z: = (ql, ... , qr). Following J. Dieudonne ([2]), we set
and, in our notations,
JC(exp( -27rU) exp(47rU)P(ea") exp( -47rU)cp*,
exp( -27rU) exp(47rU)Q(ea " ) exp(-47rU)CP*)
CHAPTER 22
equals K( P( ea " ) exp( -47rU)CP, Q(ea " ) exp(-47rU)CP*), relying on the results of sec-
tion 6; if we take q = 0, for instance, we obtain
and
JC(P(ea ) exp( -7rU)cp·, Q(ea ) exp(-7rU)cp*),
now since F(exp(-47rU)cp·) = 2- r / 2 exp(-7rU)cp·, we get
2- rJC(P(e
a )cp· ,Q(ea)cp·),
or K(wP, wQ) = 2-rJC(P, Q) (d. [2, p. 116]).
Many other examples could be given .
Conclusion.
Now we have clarified the close link between the Fourier transform
and the complex structure adapted to the symplectic structure in arbitrary signature,
it is possible to algebrize and geometrize a number of computations which are usually
carried out in a purely analytic context.
The Fourier transform defined in this way, acting on the symplectic spinor spaces
can, under some conditions (the vanishing of the second Stiefel-Whitney class of the
symplectic manifold, the existence of a pair of supplementary lagrangian fields), be
extended over a manifold with a symplectic spinor fiber bundle.
The set of these global Fourier transforms is then parametrized by a Maslov index
(or class).
The study of problems involving Poisson algebra deformations, geometric quan-
tization and differential operators will then be much easier.
