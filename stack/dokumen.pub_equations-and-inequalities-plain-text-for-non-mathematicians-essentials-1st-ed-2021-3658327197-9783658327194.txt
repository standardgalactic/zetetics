Introduction
Solving equations is an omnipresent problem when dealing with problems from
natural sciences, technology or even economics. It does not necessarily have to
be about higher mathematics, even simple equations like linear or quadratic ones
can cause problems. These types of equations will be dealt with in the following.
It is not just a matter of merely solving them, but also of dealing with equations
that at ﬁrst seem inaccessible, but which, after clever remodelling, turn out to be
easily controllable and, above all, solvable. This includes the fractional and root
equations, which are treated in the following pages.
Not quite as often as equations, but still often enough one encounters the pro-
blem of having to solve an inequality. These are also discussed below, especially
linear inequalities and fractional inequalities leading to linear ones.
This booklet will help you by presenting ready-made rules for solving the
above equations and inequalities and by giving you the opportunity to practice
them using numerous selected examples.
Since the subtitled text is explicitly (also) aimed at non-mathematicians, it is
deliberately written in generally understandable language so as not to discourage
readers by using excessive technical language; after all, the subtitled text is also
supposed to be “plain text.” For example, we will speak of “superscripts” instead
of “exponents,” and likewise of “unknowns” instead of “variables.”

Equations
Summary
1.1
What Does an Equation Look Like Anyway?
An equation consists of (at least) two expressions connected by an equals sign,
thus it has the form
Expression1 = Expression2
For example
2 + 2 = 4
(1.1)
an equation which is not really anything to criticize, except of course that it is
boring.
You can also combine several expressions into a single equation—hence the
“at least” in brackets in the ﬁrst line—for example,
2 + 2 = 3 + 1 = 4.
This is helpful when several forming steps are carried out in succession, for
example
(3 + 2) · (9 −3) = 5 · 6 = 30.

Equations
But even that is still relatively boring.
It becomes more interesting if the equation contains an unknown—in technical
jargon also: Variable -, something like
2 + x = 4
(1.2)
or something creepy like
sin(log(tan(x42))
3 sinh(2x) + 17 =

42cos(x).
(1.3)
In these cases, the point is to ﬁnd those numbers that can be used for x, so that
the expressions on both sides of the equals sign are really the same.
This is called solving the equation, and the x-values concerned are called the
solutions of the equation. The summary of all solutions of an equation is often
called the solution set of this equation.
At the latest now it becomes clear why I described equations like (1.1) above
as boring: There is nothing to solve here, the equation is simply right or wrong.
I think we can agree that Eq. 1.2 has exactly one solution, namely x = 2.
Before you despair now because you have no idea how to solve Eq. 1.3: There
you are like me, it was just an extravagant example to keep the tension high.
Chitchat
The equal sign “=” was introduced in 1557 by Robert Recorde in his algebra text-
book “The Whetstone of Witte.” It is supposed to symbolize two parallel lines,
because in Recorde’s view there is nothing more equal than two parallel lines
(“bicause noe 2 thynges can be moare equalle”) (Source: Lexikon der Mathematik).
1.2
What Can You Do with an Equation Without Changing
Its Solution Set?
Well, ﬁrst of all, any expression that occurs in an equation can be transformed
at will, such as multiplying or summarizing, as long as this does not change its
value.
For example, you cannot tell at ﬁrst glance whether the equation

1.2
What Can You Do with an Equation …
3
2 · 17 −24
5
= (−5)2 −46
2
(1.4)
is true—I certainly cannot. But if you calculate both expressions, you get on
the left side
2 · 17 −24
5
= 34 −24
5
= 10
5 = 2,
on the right
(−5)2 −46
2 = 25 −23 = 2.
Equation 1.4 is therefore “actually” only 2 = 2 and “is therefore true.”
It can also be helpful in solving equations that contain an unknown: The
equation
x + 3x + (2 · 3)x + 7x = 17
looks quite strange; but when I summarize the left side, it just says 17x, so the
equation is simpliﬁed:
17x = 17,
and has the only solution x = 1.
Most of the time, however, one will have to manipulate both sides of the
equation to ﬁnd its solution. For example, if you need to solve x + 3 = 7, it will
be a good idea to subtract 3 on both sides of the equation. This will immediately
give you the solution x = 4 to the initial equation, and that is certainly the solution
to the initial equation.
It won’t always be that easy, very often you have to change the equation several
times to get to the goal. But what can you do with an equation without changing
its solution set—returning to the title of the chapter again?
Rule
The following manipulations of an equation do not change its solution set and may
therefore be used as often as desired:
• Add or subtract the same number on both sides of the equation

4
1
Equations
• Multiply both sides of the equation with the same number, which must not be
zero
• Divide both sides of the equation by the same number, which must not be zero
You will ﬁnd plenty of examples of this on the following pages, so I will limit
myself to just one: The equation
x2 + 3x −84 = x2 + x.
(1.5)
I subtract on both sides x2 + x and thereby obtain the already greatly simpliﬁed
equation
2x −84 = 0,
and if you now add 84 on both sides and then divide both sides by 2, the solution
is explicitly x = 42 there. And if you don’t believe me—which I could understand
at any time—you can put this value into the initial Eq. (1.5) as a check; you get
the same on both sides, namely 1806.
Know-it-all info
According to the above rule, there are no restrictions when adding or subtracting
numbers, while multiplying and dividing with or by zero is not allowed. Why is this
so?
Well, adding or subtracting the number zero on either side of the equation does
not change it in the slightest, so it is not surprising that this process is allowed.
Whether it is very useful for solving the equation remains to be seen.
Multiplying both sides with zero immediately transforms each equation into the
new equation 0= 0. While this has the charm of being correct, it has the disadvantage
that the solution of the original equation can no longer be determined from it, and
this cannot be reversed.
After all, dividing anything by zero is simply not allowed, it has nothing to do
with solving equations in the strict sense.

1.3
Linear Equations

1.3
Linear Equations
Some types of equations occur repeatedly, so there are “ready-made” formulas
for them; we will look at these in more detail on the following pages. I start with
the linear equations.
Example 1.1
A car driver drives for several hours at constant speed on a level road (in
a mathematics book this is possible). Due to its gentle driving style, the car
consumes only 5 L of petrol per 100 km distance, that is, 0.05 L/km. At the
beginning of the journey the tank was ﬁlled with 40 L petrol. If you sum this
up, you get the “petrol function.”
b(x) = 40 −0.05 · x,
which indicates how many liters of petrol are still in the tank after x kilometers
driven.
After a few hours, the driver suspects that the tank could soon be empty,
and he wants to calculate when this will be the case. How can he do that?
Well, “empty tank” means nothing more than that the fuel function has a value
of zero, so it is the equation
40 −0.05 · x = 0
(1.6)
to solve.
Because x is linear here, that is, without a superscript, root or other
disturbing additions, this is called a linear equation.◀
Deﬁnition 1.1
An equation of form
mx + d = 0
with real numbers m and d, where m must not be zero, is called linear equation.
You have already seen a ﬁrst example of such a linear equation in (Eq. 1.6):
There was m = −0.05 and d = 40. Further examples follow in a moment.

6
1
Equations
Know-it-all info
The requirement that m ̸= 0 is certainly sensible, because if it is m = 0, the equation
is reduced to
d = 0,
and that is either wrong, if d is not zero, or meaningless.
The nice thing about linear equations is that they always have one—and exactly
one—solution, and that you can give it without too much calculation; and that is
exactly what I want to do now.
Rule
The linear equation mx + d = 0 has the solution
x1 = −d
m .
There is not too much to say about the derivation here: First deduct d on both sides
of the equation and then divide by m. And there is the given solution formula.
Know-it-all info
With everything you do in your mathematical life (whatever that is exactly), you
should ask yourself if you are not doing something strictly forbidden, such as
dividing by zero or taking the square root of a negative number.
Neither of these things happens here: The only thing that is divided here is the
number m, which, according to the deﬁnition of the linear equation, must not be
zero, and there is nothing to be seen of a root here for miles around.
Example 1.2
a) In the linear equation
2x + 5 = 0
we have m = 2 and d = 5. Consequently, their solution is
x1 = −5
2.

1.3
Linear Equations

You might want to add that to the equation for veriﬁcation purposes. You
never know with me.
b) The equation
3x −7 = 0
has the solution
x1 = −−7
3 ,
which, because of the good old rule “minus times minus equals plus,” can
be written down even more nicely
x1 = 7
3.
c) The equation
2x + 5 = 47 −x
you got to get your mind right a little bit ﬁrst: Addition of x and subtraction
of 47 on both sides turns it into the linear equation
3x −42 = 0.
It has the solution
x1 = −−42
3
= 42
3 = 14,
and this value is therefore also the solution of the initial equation.
◀
Example 1.3
We should ﬁnally come back to the driver from example 1.1 and calculate how
far his fuel will go. For this we have to solve the equation
40 −0.05 · x = 0

Equations
solve. But with the new knowledge you have just acquired it is easy: Here
m = −0.05 and d = 40, that is
x1 = −
40
−0.05.
Now what? Well, you can, for example, rewrite the value −0.05 to −5
100 and
then apply tighter fractions: The good old rule: “You divide by a fraction by
multiplying with its reciprocal” leads to
x1 = −40
−5
100
= −40 · 100
−5
= −4000
−5 = 800.
However, you can also use the calculator … In any case, you get the result
that the gasoline is sufﬁcient for a total of 800 km.
I can’t think of much more about linear equations, so let’s go straight to
the more sophisticated quadratic equations.◀
1.4
Quadratic Equations
1.4.1
First Examples
To say it right from the start: The term “quadratic equation” is not quite correct,
strictly speaking, the equation itself is of course not quadratic (but rather broad),
just as the electric locomotive driver is not powered by electricity. The name is
rather due to the fact that in such equations the x is not only linear, but also has
the superscript 2, that is, the equation contains the expression “x to the power of
two” or “x squared.”
But what exactly does a quadratic equation look like? First, an example from
the world of text problems.
Example 1.4
A rectangular plot of land has the area of 351 square meters and the perimeter
80 m. Is it possible to calculate the length of the sides of the plot with this
information?
To answer this question we should ﬁrst give the two side lengths names,
let’s call them x and y. Since the area of a rectangle is just the product of the

1.4
Quadratic Equations
9
side lengths, I know from the ﬁrst speciﬁcation that
x · y = 351
is—whereby I have omitted the units in the best mathematical tradition.
To determine the circumference of the rectangle, you have to take twice the
length of the sides and add them up; thus
2x + 2y = 80.
So now we have two equations with two unknowns; unpleasant thing. To
reduce this to an equation with only one unknown, I ﬁrst solve the second
one after one of the unknowns, let’s say after y. This is done in two steps like
this: First you divide both sides by 2, which results in
x + y = 40,
and then subtract x on both sides, resulting in
y = 40 −x.
In words: y is the same as 40 −x, and therefore I can replace y with 40 −x
in the ﬁrst equation without breaking anything. This results in
x · (40 −x) = 351.
If you now multiply out the left side and shift the 351 to the left side, you get
the equation
−x2 + 40x −351 = 0.
(1.7)
This is my ﬁrst example of a quadratic equation. The answer to the ques-
tion asked at the beginning, whether one can calculate the side lengths of the
rectangle, is now quite clear: “It depends.” If you can solve quadratic equati-
ons, yes, otherwise no. A few pages further on at the latest, your answer will
be “yes”.
I have quite a few more examples for you, but ﬁrst I should write down
exactly what a quadratic equation is. It’s called a deﬁnition.◀

10
1
Equations
Deﬁnition 1.2
• An equation of form
ax2 + bx + c = 0
with real numbers a, b, and c, where a must not be zero, is called a quadratic
equation.
• An equation of the form
x2 + px + q = 0
with real numbers p and q is called quadratic equation in normal form.
A quadratic equation has a normal form if the coefﬁcient, that is the number
before x2 equals 1 (and is therefore not explicitly written down). Why then rena-
ming the other two numbers p or q, you shouldn’t ask yourself or me, that’s what
has become common practice.
Example 1.5
a) The equation
2x2 + 3x −2 = 0
(1.8)
is a quadratic equation with a = 2, b = 3 and c = −2.
b) The equation
−x2 + 40x −351 = 0
from the input example is a quadratic equation with a = −1, b = 40 and
c = −351. It has no normal form, which is x2 due to the inconspicuous
minus sign.
c) The equation
x2 −2x −3 = 0
(1.9)
is a quadratic equation in normal form with p = −2 and q = −3.
d) The equation

1.4
Quadratic Equations
11
3x2 −√x + 5 = 0
is not a quadratic equation (because of the root).
◀
Know-it-all info
The requirement that a ̸= 0 is also useful here, because if it is a = 0, the equation
is reduced to
bx + c = 0,
so a linear equation, and we have already looked at linear equations further ahead.
The other two coefﬁcients b and c (or p and q), on the other hand, may well
be zero; the following examples show that this may even have advantages.
Example 1.6
a) The poorest quadratic equation I can think of is
x2 = 0.
(1.10)
So here b and c are zero at the same time. At least it can be easily released:
Here we look for a number x, which squares, that is, multiplied by itself,
gives zero. However, this can only be achieved by a number, namely x = 0.
So this is the only solution of the quadratic Eq. 1.10.
b) Not much more demanding is the equation
2x2 −8 = 0.
(1.11)
So here a = 2, b = 0 and c = −8. The essential point is that b = 0,
because it makes it easy to solve the equation: Dividing by 2 and then
adding the constants 4 on both sides forms (1.11) to convert into
x2 = 4.
(1.12)
Surely you have already seen that one solution of this equation is x1 = 2,
but beware! There is also a second solution, namely that x2 = −2 because
of the rule already quoted, minus times minus equals plus (−2) · (−2) =

12
1
Equations
4. Equation 1.12 and therefore also Eq. 1.11 has two different solutions,
namely x1 = 2 and x2 = −2.
c) Also for the Equation
x2 + 9 = 0
b = 0, but this does not help the solution: If you put 9 on the right side,
you get
x2 = −9.
A solution of this equation (and thus also of the initial equation) would
therefore be a number x, which multiplied by itself results in something
negative. But there is no such thing, at least not in the range of real numbers
in which we are moving here. Therefore, this equation, as harmless as it
looks, is unsolvable.
d) You should also see c = 0 an example of the case; how about this:
x2 + 3x = 0.
(1.13)
Now comes a little trick that you can always use if you want c = 0: I put
the factor x on the left side outside the brackets and get
x · (x + 3) = 0.
Now, a product is zero exactly when at least one of the factors is zero.
Therefore the expression x · (x + 3) is zero if either x = 0 or x = −3. And
thus Eq. 1.13 has the two solutions x1 = 0 and x2 = −3.
Every quadratic equation can be brought into normal form by dividing both
sides of the equation by a (whereby nothing changes on the right side, because
zero by a is zero, so a can be as large as it wants). The concrete calculation
rule for this is as follows:◀
Rule
Any quadratic equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0
can be brought into normal form

1.4
Quadratic Equations
13
x2 + px + q = 0
by setting:
p = b
a
and q = c
a .
As I said, nothing else happened here but that every single summand was divided
by a. For example, the normal form of Eq. 1.8 is:
x2 + 3
2 x −1 = 0.
(1.14)
Just as further ahead in the solution of the linear equation, it must be emphasized
that one may divide by a without restraint, since it is assumed to be unequal to
zero.
Since every quadratic equation can now be brought into normal form, no for-
mula would be needed to determine the solution of a general quadratic equation;
it would be sufﬁcient to be able to solve the quadratic equation in normal form.
This is quite true, and quite a few mathematicians—myself included—are basi-
cally only concerned with equations in normal form and their solution by the
so-called p-q-formula, which I will show you below.
For the sake of completeness, and because the formula for the solution of the
general equation has such a nice name, I want to introduce it brieﬂy in the next
section.
1.4.2
The Midnight Formula
The following infobox gives complete information about how many solutions a
quadratic equation can have and how to calculate them if necessary. In particular,
it contains the so-called midnight formula (1.15); it is also known under the very
profane and far from beautiful name a-b-c formula.
Know-it-all info
A quadratic equation
ax2 + bx + c = 0
has either no solution at all, or one or two different solutions.

Equations
To ﬁnd out which of these situations exists and to calculate the solutions if
necessary, one ﬁrst determines the number
D = b2 −4ac.
• If D is negative, the quadratic equation has no solution.
• If D is zero, the quadratic equation has exactly one solution, namely
x1 = −b
2a .
• If D is positive, the quadratic equation has two different solutions x1 and x2,
which can be calculated using the midnight formula
x1 = −b +

Usually this is summarized in the short form

together.
Chitchat
The midnight formula is so called because many people think that every student
must be able to recite it by heart when you wake him up at midnight. As I said
above, I don’t necessarily agree with this opinion, because the easier to remember
p-q-formula does the job.
I think only the math-enthusiasts among you can really enjoy formulas like
(1.15), and you probably spontaneously think of some things you’d rather do at
midnight than recite that formula. So I’ll just give you an example and then go
straight to the p-q-formula, which is at least a little bit more compact than the
midnight formula.
Example 1.7
a) Let’s start by looking at the equation

1.4
Quadratic Equations
15
2x2 + 3x −2 = 0
(1.16)
from example 1.5. Here a = 2, b = 3 and c = −2, which returns the value
D = 32 −4 · 2 · (−2) = 9 + 16 = 25,
and since 25 is positive, we know that the equation has two solutions. The
midnight formula provides
x1 = −3 +
√
25
2 · 2
= 2
4 = 1
2 and x2 = −3 −
√
25
2 · 2
= −8
4 = −2.
Equation 1.16 therefore has the two solutions x1 = 1
2 and x2 = −2. If you
do not believe this—which I would understand immediately, because I am
always making miscalculations—you can easily check it by inserting these
values into the left side of the equation; try it, I will wait here as long as it
takes.
b) For the equation which is only slightly different from (1.16)
2x2 + 3x + 2 = 0
(1.17)
results in the value
D = 32 −4 · 2 · 2 = 9 −16 = −7,
which is a negative number. The actually quite harmless looking Eq. 1.17
is therefore unsolvable.
◀
Example 1.8
I had promised at the end of example 1.4 that you would be able to calculate
the side lengths “a few pages further” by solving Eq. 1.7; and that is now
ready.
The equation to be solved is
−x2 + 40x −351 = 0.

16
1
Equations
So here a = −1, b = 40, and c = −351, and so
D = 402 −4 · (−1) · (−351) = 1600 −1404 = 196,
is positive. Therefore the equation has two different solutions, namely
x1 = −40 +
√
196
−2
= −40 + 14
−2
= 13
and
x2 = −40 −
√
196
−2
= 27.
The respective other side length y is obtained from the correlation y = 40 −x
determined in the example, it is
y1 = 40 −x1 = 27 and y2 = 40 −x2 = 13.
And now you can also see that the side lengths of the rectangle are in fact
clearly determined, they are 13 and 27, because which side I call x and which
I call y is of course my own artistic freedom.
That’s it with the general quadratic equations, I turn now to the p-q-formula
(and you’re bound to do so, after all you paid money for this book).◀
1.4.3
The p-q-Formula
Without too much preface, I would like to present the p-q-formula for solving
quadratic equations in normal form. Since you have already seen that any qua-
dratic equation can easily be brought into normal form, this means nothing else
than that you can use this formula to solve any quadratic equation.
Rule

Yes, I know that the whole thing is very similar to the midnight formula, and
I also admit that I have been working with copy and paste here, one has to move
forward. But please note: I would like to recommend the p-q-formula as a rule,
because in my opinion and experience you should use it; the midnight formula,
on the other hand, I have formulated as know-it-all info.

In painting, music, architecture, and many other ﬁelds, the golden ratio plays an
important role. In the language of geometry it can be described as follows: A rec-
tangle is constructed according to the golden ratio, when the ratio of the longer side
to the shorter is the same as the sum of the two side lengths to the longer.
Any more questions? Probably.

Equations
Fig.1.1 A rectangle
Surely a look at Fig. 1.1. Here I have drawn a rectangle, the longer side named
x and the shorter side y. The above requirement now means in formulas
x
y = x + y
x
.
(1.19)
Since it only depends on the length ratio of the two sides, I may normalize one
of them and do so by setting the length of the shorter side y = 1 to 1. That makes
(1.19) the already much more friendly looking equation
x
1 = x + 1
x
.
If we multiply by x and leave out the already unnecessary denominator 1, we get
the equivalent equation
x2 = x + 1,
and if you now bring everything to the left side, you get the quadratic equation
in normal form
x2 −x −1 = 0.
(1.20)

The value d from the p-q-formula is equal to
d = 1
4 −(−1) = 1
4 + 1 = 5

is positive. Thus there are two different solutions of the quadratic Eq. 1.20, namely
x1 = 1
2 +

5
4 ≈1.618 and x2 = 1
2 −

5
4 ≈−0.618.
Since negative side lengths are rather unusual for rectangles, the only reasonable
solution to the problem is x1 = 1.618....
In case you have forgotten which problem we have actually solved here (which
I could well understand), here again in summary: The question was what the ratio
of the two sides of a rectangle constructed according to the golden ratio must be;
and the answer is: The longer side must be about 1.618 times as long as the shorter
one.
By the way, the rectangle in Fig. 1.1 is actually drawn according to this principle.
Such ﬁgures are considered to be particularly beautiful. (No, I don’t want to argue
about that now.) For example, the Parthenon on the Acropolis in Athens is built
according to the golden ratio—although it is not known whether the builders applied
this construction principle on purpose or whether they chose a “beautiful” ground
plan rather intuitively.
But now enough of chitchat, here are a few examples of the p-q-formula,
because to learn mathematical contents, there is nothing better than practicing,
practicing, and in case of doubt practicing again.
Example 1.9
a) The quadratic equation to be solved is
x2 + x −2.
So here p = 1 and q = −2. So there is
d = 1
4 −(−2) = 1
4 + 2 = 9
4,

20
1
Equations
and since 9
4 is positive, two different solutions of the quadratic equation
can be expected. These are
x1 = −1
2 +

9
4 = −1
2 + 3
2 = 1 and x2 = −1
2 −3
2 = −2.
b) The second equation we want to look at is
x2 −3x = 0.
(1.21)
You may remember example 1.6 d and therefore see that you can exclude
x on the left side and thus convert the equation into the form
x(x −3) = 0.
From this, in turn, it can be directly seen that the equation has the two
solutions x2 = 0 and x1 = 3, because for this one of the factors on the left
side becomes zero.
But that’s exactly what I don’t want to know for the time being (older
mathematicians can be quite stubborn), but without further thought I will
throw the p-q-formula on (1.21). This is not quite as pointless as it might
seem: In a stressful situation, such as a test, you may not see the decom-
position possibility just shown, and then it helps if you can hold on to
something as secure as the p-q-formula.
So here p = −3 and q = 0, and so
d = (−3)2
4
−0 = 9
4 > 0.
The two solutions of the equation to be expected are
x1 = −−3
2 +

9
4 = 3
2 + 3
2 = 3 and x2 = −−3
2 −

9
4 = 3
2 −3
2 = 0,
in full accordance with the result obtained at the beginning.
c) Now we look at the quadratic equation
x2 −6x + 9 = 0
(1.22)

1.4
Quadratic Equations
21
I think I can save myself the trouble of explicitly naming p and q again,
you’ve got that up to now. For d I get the value
d = (−6)2
4
−9 = 36
4 −9 = 0.
Equation 1.21 thus has only one solution according to the p-q-formula,
namely
x1 = −−6
2 = 3.
Know-it-all info
Perhaps you know the binomial formula, even though I have not mentioned
it in this text with any word so far. If you do, you can apply it once to the
left side of Eq. 1.22, and you will get the expression (x −3)2, the equation is
equivalent to
(x −3)2 = 0.
In this form, however, you can see with the naked eye that the equation has
x = 3 as the only solution.
So we have found two different ways to solve (1.22); there are worse things
to do.
d) No one has claimed that the numbers appearing in an equation must always
be integers. Here are the following two examples. To solve the quadratic
equation
x2 −3x + 11
4 = 0.
(1.23)
Here
d = 9
4 −11
4 = −1
2,
is negative. That is why the “to solve is” such a thing: The square Eq. 1.23
is not solvable.
e) One should not stop like this, so at the end of this example, therefore, a
solvable equation. But without integer coefﬁcients:

22

Equations
x2 + 5
12 x −1
6 = 0.
(1.24)
So here we will have to deal a little with fractions. Don’t worry, I’m with
you—if it’s not this very fact that worries you.
The worst thing here is probably to calculate the value d, so let’s get it over
with. First…
d =
25
144 · 4 −(−1
6),
because 52 = 25 and 122 = 144. The two minus signs at the back “lift
themselves away,” as my children would say, and it might also be a good
idea to bring the whole thing down to a common denominator 144·4 = 576.
This will result in
d = 25
576 + 1
6 = 25
576 + 96
576 = 121
576
Whatever this may be exactly, it is in any case a positive number, and
therefore Eq. 1.24 has two solutions. These are
x1 = −5
24 +

121
576 = −5
24 + 11
24 = 6
24 = 1
4
and
x2 = −5
24 −

121
576 = −5
24 −11
24 = −16
24 = −2
3.
By the way, in case you didn’t immediately see that the root of 576 is 24,
you are just like me. But that doesn’t matter, just put the calculator on it! In
exercises or exams, you usually get smooth values, because your lecturers
don’t want to constantly recalculate “crooked” values.

1.4.4
Quadratic Equations Which Are Not Recognizable at First
Glance
Sometimes quadratic equations appear hidden, that is, an equation that may initi-
ally appear much more complicated can be reduced to a quadratic equation. In
this short section, I will introduce three situations in which such things typically
occur.
I will show the ﬁrst situation with an example: The equation to be solved is
x(x + 1)(x + 2) = x3 + 2x2 −1.
At ﬁrst sight hardly feasible, because here even the superscript 3 appears, so
the equation seems to be far from being a quadratic equation. But it just seems
so; if you multiply the left side and sort by x-power, you get the equation
x3 + 3x2 + 2x = x3 + 2x2 −1.
(Don’t despair: I didn’t do this in one step either, a little extra calculation was
necessary here). Now you subtract x3 on both sides, which results in
3x2 + 2x = 2x2 −1.
This looks much more friendly, because the superscript 3 has completely disap-
peared. Now I bring everything to the left side of the equation by subtracting 2x2
on both sides and adding 1; I get
x2 + 2x + 1 = 0,
thus a quadratic equation of purest form, and even thankfully already in normal
form. It has the only solution x1 = −1, as you can see for example with the help
of the p-q-formula.
And why does this equation not look as a quadratic one, as it was said in the
title? Because here, ﬁrst of all, even greater superscripts than the 2 appear and
the equation therefore does not look like a quadratic one at ﬁrst. But since the
expressions with these larger superscripts are fortunately balanced on both sides,
they are omitted when the equation is smoothed and only a quadratic equation
remains.
Here is another example. Also the equation

24
1
Equations
1
2 x(x2 −1)(3 −2x) = 3
2 x3(1 −2
3 x)
(1.25)
looks very inaccessible at ﬁrst glance. But this is deceptive, as you can see by
multiplying and then sorting by x-power: The left side can be transformed in two
careful steps into
1
2 x(x2 −1)(3 −2x) = (1
2 x3 −1
2 x)(3 −2x) = 3
2 x3 −3
2 x −x4 + x2,
the right one to
3
2 x3 −x4.
The Eq. 1.25 formulated at the beginning is therefore equivalent to
3
2 x3 −3
2 x −x4 + x2 = 3
2 x3 −x4.
If you look sharply, you will see that the complete right side also appears on the
left side and can therefore be removed on both sides. It remains
−3
2 x + x2 = 0.
But this is a quadratic equation (the purists can still bring that x2 forward to make
complete agreement with the deﬁnition), it has the two solutions
x1 = 3
2 and x2 = 0,
and if we have not made any conversion errors along the way, this also applies
to the initial Eq. (1.25). Try it out by inserting these two values into the output
equation.
A second situation, in which quadratic equations can appear hidden, we have
already seen above in the conversation about the golden ratio. There the equation
x
1 = x + 1
x
a so-called fractional equation, as a variant of the quadratic equation

1.4
Quadratic Equations
25
x2 −x −1 = 0
has been exposed.
Another, similar example of this kind is the equation
x −41 =
40
x −2.
(1.26)
To smooth this out, ﬁrst multiply by the denominator (x −2), which leads me to
the equation
(x −41)(x −2) = 40,
so we get
x2 −43x + 82 = 40
If you subtract 40 on both sides, you get the quadratic equation in normal form
x2 −43x + 42 = 0.
Don’t be afraid of big numbers! The number d usually deﬁned for the p-q-formula
here
d = 432
4
−42 = 1849
4
−42 = 1849
4
−168
4
= 1681
4
,
is positive. Thus the quadratic equation has two solutions, and without much
ado I calculate these as
x1 = 43
2 +

1681
4
= 43
2 + 41
2 = 42 und
x2 = 43
2 −41
2 = 1.
And these two values are in fact also solutions of the initial Eq. (1.26), as one
checks by inserting the respective value on both sides of the equation—I will
refrain from the “effortless” that is otherwise usual at this point.
Chitchat
By the way, equations such as the one just discussed can also show you the strength
of the mathematical “formula language,” which is frowned upon by most people

26
1
Equations
and makes some people downright afraid of mathematics. Completely unnecessary,
because formulas only serve to make the statements, here the task, more precise and
thus clearer.
For if you wanted to put Eq. 1.26 into words, you would have to say something
like “I am looking for numbers which have the property that they give the same
result if you subtract 41 from them on the one hand and subtract 2 from them on
the other hand and then divide 40 by the value just received.”
You don’t even understand the task at hand, let alone the solution.
And a third and last example will show you that behind fractional equations
there are often “only” quadratic equations.
Example 1.10
To be solved
1
x =
1
x + 1 −
1
x −1.
(1.27)
In order to get rid of all three denominators here, I unfortunately have to
multiply by your product, since obviously none of the three denominators is
contained as a factor in any of the others. This gives me an intermediate result
x(x + 1)(x −1)
x
= x(x + 1)(x −1)
x + 1
−x(x + 1)(x −1)
x −1
,
and after shortening the factors that occur simultaneously in numerator and
denominator,
(x + 1)(x −1) = x(x −1) −x(x + 1).
Now it’s time to start multiplying out again: I get
x2 −1 = x2 −x −(x2 + x),
so
x2 −1 = −2x
or

1.4
Quadratic Equations
27
x2 + 2x −1 = 0.
This quadratic equation also has two solutions, namely
x1 = −1 +

1 −(−1) = −1 +
√
2 and
x2 = −1 −
√
2.
◀
A quadratic equation can also be hidden under a root, so to speak, which brings
us to the topic of root equations at the very end of this chapter. A ﬁrst example
is the equation

x2 + 2x + 6 + 3 = 0.
(1.28)
To get closer to the solution of this equation, you have to somehow get rid of the
root, and since the natural enemy of root extraction is squaring (that is, multiply-
ing by itself), this is the one to use. However, if you apply this operation to the
equation in the form given here, you have to apply the binomial formula on the
left (or multiply it out on foot) and you get
(

x2 + 2x + 6 + 3)2 = (x2 + 2x + 6) + 6 ·

x2 + 2x + 6 + 9.
You can now summarize this further as you like, you will not get rid of the root.
It is much better to ﬁrst convert the initial Eq. (1.28) into the form

x2 + 2x + 6 = −3
to bring, and then to square. This immediately delivers
x2 + 2x + 6 = 9,
so the quadratic equation
x2 + 2x −3 = 0.
(1.29)
I hope you haven’t completely forgotten the p-q-formula about all the transfor-
mations of fractions and roots. You can now apply it to (1.29) and get the two
solutions

28
1
Equations
x1 = −1 +

1 −(−3) = −1 + 2 = 1 and
x2 = −1 −2 = −3.
But if you sit back contentedly and are happy to have found two solutions to
the equation, you will be bitterly disappointed. With root equations it can happen
that one ﬁnds solutions of the transformed equation—in this case the quadratic
equation—which, however, do not fulﬁll the initial equation to be solved. These
solutions are then called mock solutions.
And that’s what’s happening here: If you insert the two values x1 = 1 and
x2 = −3 in (Eq. 1.28), you get both times the expression
√
9 + 3 = 0,
who, by any stretch of the imagination, is not right. So we are dealing with two
mock solutions, and the initial equation itself has no solutions at all.
Know-it-all info
Why is it possible that, when solving root equations, mock solutions can occur,
that is, solutions of the transformed equation, but which are not solutions of the
initial equation? Well, this is because interim squaring can change the solution set
of the equation, because squaring is not only the natural enemy of root extraction,
but also the absolute killer of negative signs; nobly formulated: Squaring is not an
equivalence transformation.
A very simple example already shows this: The equation
−2 = 2
is certainly not correct even with the most generous interpretation of algebra. But
if I square both sides of the equation, I get the correct equation
4 = 4.
In order not to leave you quite so demotivated from this chapter, I will now show
you two examples of root equations that can really be solved.
Example 1.11
a) The ﬁrst example is
x −
√
210 + 37x = 0.
(1.30)

1.4
Quadratic Equations
29
One should always try to isolate the root on one side of the equals sign and
bring everything else to the other side. It’s not always possible, but here
it’s very easy and results in
x =
√
210 + 37x.
Squaring both sides provides
x2 = 210 + 37x,
thus the quadratic equation in normal form
x2 −37x −210 = 0.
I have neglected the term d in the last examples. Here I calculate it again
explicitly and ﬁnd
d = 372
4
−(−210) = 1369
4
+ 210 = 1369
4
+ 840
4
= 2209
4
.
Now this is the place where you think you have made a mistake or the
person posing the problem has used nasty crooked numbers, but it only
seems so: 2209 is a square number, to be more precise 2209 = 472, and
therefore the quadratic equation has the nice “smooth” solutions
x1 = 37
2 +

2209
4
= 37
2 + 47
2 = 42 and
x2 = 37
2 −47
2 = −5.
To make sure that we didn’t work for nothing again and calculated only
dummy solutions, I put these values in the left side of (1.30) and get
42 −
√
210 + 37 · 42 = 42 −
√
1764 = 42 −42 = 0;
so x1 is actually a solution of the initial equation. It does not look so
good with x2 = −5, inserting this in (1.30) gives here
−5 −

210 + 37 · (−5) = −5 −
√
25 = −5 −5 = −10,
so not zero. x2 = −5 is therefore a mock solution.

30
1
Equations
b) One should solve

2x2 + x + 1 −x = 1.
(1.31)
Again, it is strongly recommended to isolate the root on the left side by
adding x on both sides; this will result in

2x2 + x + 1 = x + 1,
an equation that can easily be squared and thus the following can be
obtained:
2x2 + x + 1 = (x + 1)2,
so
2x2 + x + 1 = x2 + 2x + 1.
If you now bring everything to the left side, you get the clear quadratic
equation
x2 −x = 0.
Either with the p-q-formula or with the help of the decomposition one ﬁnds
the two solutions of this equation x2 −x = x(x −1):
x1 = 1 and
x2 = 0.
I hardly dare, but let us nevertheless insert these values into the initial
Eq. (1.31). For on the left side we get x1 = 1
√
2 + 1 + 1 −1 =
√
4 −1 = 2 −1 = 1.
x1 is therefore actually a solution. Encouraged in this way, I now take
x2 = 0 and use it. I get
√
0 + 0 + 1 −0 =
√
1 = 1.

1.4
Quadratic Equations
31
So solution x2 is also solution, so now we have also seen a root equation
which has no mock solutions.
◀
And that’s a happy ending to this chapter, don’t you think?

Inequalities
2.1
What Kind of Inequalities Are Meant Here?
The last chapter was about equations, that is, statements in which two or more
expressions are connected by an equals sign and thus represent the same thing.
One might now think that an inequality consists of two or more expressions
connected by the inequality sign “̸=.”
In the literal sense of the word, this would also be correct, but things like
3 ̸= 4 are not really sparkling, and also “inequalities” with unknowns, something
like
x2 + 2x −15 ̸= 0
(2.1)
don’t bring much new. Here we are looking for all numbers x, which do not fulﬁll
the corresponding equation x2 + 2x −15 = 0. But for this you can simply solve
this quadratic equation using the p-q-formula (Attention: learning objectives!) and
ﬁnd x1 = 3 and x2 = −5. Thus, the “inequality” (2.1) is solved by all numbers
which are not equal to 3 or −5.
In the case of an inequality in the mathematical sense, however, one wants to
know it a little more precisely and asks which of the two expressions is smaller
than the other or for which values of the unknown x this is the case.
This is ultimately due to the fact that the numbers we know in this way can
all be arranged on a straight line, the so-called number line, and this means that
of two different numbers (or more generally: expressions) one is always smaller
than the other and can therefore be found further to the left than the other on the
usual number line (Fig. 2.1).

Inequalities
Fig.2.1 The number line
You want to be a little more speciﬁc? You’re welcome:
▶Definition 2.1 An inequality consists of (at least) two expressions connected
by one of the characters<(“smaller”), ≤(“smaller or equal”),>(“larger”), or ≥
(“larger or equal”).
Example 2.1
For example 42 ≥17 is such an inequality, although not very exciting, but
x + 2 < 13
(2.2)
is also an inequality, namely one that contains an unknown and therefore must
be solved. What we are looking for here are those numbers x with the property:
If you add 2 to x, the result is still smaller than 13. Even without too much
knowledge of higher mathematics, you may ﬁnd that these are all numbers
smaller than 11.◀
Know-it-all info
Note the small but subtle difference between the characters ≤and<(or ≥and>):
While it is still allowed if the associated expressions ≤are equal, it is forbidden
with<.
In other words, the statement 42 ≤42 is completely correct, whereas 42 < 42
is simply wrong.
Since you probably don’t want to discuss four different forms of inequality any
more than I do, I will concentrate on one of them in the following, based on the
following consideration:
• Although the meaning of the signs ≤and<as just emphasized is not the same,
the methods for transforming and thus solving the inequalities associated with
them are exactly the same; therefore in the following I will limit myself to the
real inequalities, that is, expressions associated with<or>.

2.2
What Can You Do With an Inequality Without Changing Its Solution Set?
35
• Expression1 < Expression2 obviously means exactly the same as Expression2 >
Expression1; therefore I will only consider with<related expressions in the
following.
Inthefollowingwewilldealwiththesolutionofinequalitiescontaininganunknown.
What exactly is meant by “solving,” I wrote down at the beginning of the previous
chapter of the equations; you may want to turn back to it, I will wait here for you.
2.2
What Can You Do With an Inequality Without Changing
Its Solution Set?
Admittedly, I used copy and paste to get the title from the ﬁrst chapter, one has to
work efﬁciently nowadays.
However, with the following rule about allowed manipulations of inequalities,
I can’t do that without further ado, but I have to pay hellish attention; and you
should do the same when reading.
Rule
The following manipulations of an inequality do not change its solution set and may
therefore be used as often as desired:
• Adding or subtracting the same number on both sides of the inequality
• Multiplying both sides of the inequality with the same positive number
• Dividing both sides of the inequality by the same positive number
Did you ﬁnd the difference to the equations? Well, maybe it wasn’t that difﬁcult,
because I wrote it in italics: While in equations, multiply and divide by any number
except zero, here it’s only allowed with positive numbers.
And that’s a good thing: For example, the inequality
−1 < 2
(2.3)
is absolutely correct, because −1 is further to the left on the number line than 2. But
if I multiply it with the negative number −3, it becomes
3 < −6

36
2
Inequalities
which is certainly not right.
But what if for some reason you are forced to multiply both sides of an inequality
with a negative number? Well, with a little extra effort, you can handle that too. I
pedantically write this down again as a rule; this is to be understood as a supplement
to the previous one.
Rule
The following manipulations of an inequality do not change its solution set and may
therefore be used as often as desired:
• Multiplying both sides of the inequality with the same negative number and
exchanging both sides at the same time
• Dividing both sides of the inequality by the same negative number with
simultaneous permutation of both sides
If I observe this new rule and again multiply the inequality (2.3) with −3, it becomes
−6 < 3,
which has a much better truth value than the false result determined above.
Chitchat
In many other books you will ﬁnd at the end of the two points of the rule just
formulated the phrase, “with simultaneous inversion of the inequality sign”; in this
case the solution of (2.3) would be 3 > −6. This is of course just as correct as—in
all modesty—my formulation above, I have chosen it because I want to concentrate
on the “<” sign as written above; and I can sometimes be quite stubborn, ask my
wife.
2.3
Linear Inequalities
Just as with equations, there are also some types of inequalities which occur again
and again and for which there are therefore “ready-made” solution formulas. In
this text I will concentrate mainly on linear inequalities and modiﬁcations of them;
at the end of the chapter I will also tell you why.
For once, I don’t want to give an example—I get older—but rather give the
deﬁnition right away and explain it with examples afterward.

2.3
Linear Inequalities
37
Deﬁnition 2.2
An inequality of form
ax < b
with real numbers a and b, where a must not be zero, is called linear inequality.
One asks here, for which values of x the product ax is smaller than the given
number b. First examples of this are
3x < 42
(2.4)
or perhaps
−2x < 12.
(2.5)
But what is the answer to this question? Well, in the last section I wrote that you can
divide both sides of an inequality by the same positive number without changing its
solution set. This is practical, because 3 is certainly a positive number, and therefore
I am allowed to divide both sides of (2.4) by 3 and thus get rid of the factor before
x. (By the way, I may divide both sides of (2.5) as well as any other inequality by 3,
but that would not be very useful. Not funny? OK, forget it.)
After dividing by 3, (2.4) becomes the expression
x < 14,
and this is already the solution of this inequality; in words: All numbers smaller
than 14 solve (2.4), for example 13, 371
372, 0, −1, and −9999.
I cannot list all solutions here, because there are inﬁnitely many, and this is quite
typical for inequalities: In contrast to equations, they usually do not have ﬁnitely
many solutions.
Know-it-all info
If you want it to be formulated in a mathematically correct way, you have to describe
the solution set L of (2.4) like this
L = {x|x < 14}.
So you will ﬁnd this in many mathematics books—should you ever pick one up
again—but I will hardly ever use it again.

Inequalities
Let us now ﬁnally take a look at the solution of (2.5). Here, of course, it makes
sense to divide by −2 to get rid of the pre-factor of x. I do that too, but I have to
keep in mind that −2 is negative, and thus the extended rule about swapping sides
at the same time comes into play. To cut a long story short: (2.5) becomes
−6 < x.
Solution of this inequality are all numbers x, which are larger than −6, that is, which
are further to the right on the number line than this number.
This applies, for example, to x = −5; set this value to the left side of (2.5) for
checking purposes. Following the good old rule “minus times minus equals plus”
you will get (−2) · (−5) = 10, and 10 is certainly less than 12.
What I have just done with the special numbers 3 and −2, I can also do with gene-
ral positive or negative pre-factors a of the inequality and thus obtain the following
rule for their solution:
Rule
The solution of the linear inequality ax < b consists of all numbers x to which
applies:
x < b
a , if a > 0,
or
b
a < x, if a < 0.
We have already looked at two examples of this before (which is typical mathema-
tical English, because you won’t get the solution by looking at it alone), so I will
now just add one more. I will also show you that the sign of b, the right side, does
not matter at all. b can be as negative as it wants to be, it does not change the rule.
Example 2.2
The linear inequality to be solved is
−3x < −12.
(2.6)

2.4
Linear Inequalities That Have Yet to be Sorted
39
True to the rule, I now have to divide −12 by −3—that makes 4—and swap
both sides. I get the solution 4 < x. All numbers x, which are greater than 4,
thus fulﬁll the inequality (2.6).
As a rather arbitrary example, I set x = 10 and get −30 < −12; and that is
correct. You hesitate? Well, when you have negative numbers, you have to keep
in mind that the smaller of two is the one that is greater in amount. Unusual,
but correct. Or perhaps the number line that has already been strained several
times will help you: Of two negative numbers, the one that is further to the
left is smaller; and that is certainly the case for −30 compared to −12.◀
2.4
Linear Inequalities That Have Yet to be Sorted
With this somewhat cryptic headline I mean the fact that linear inequalities will
seldom appear in the same beautifully sorted form ax < b. Most of the time you
have to get them into this form by separating the parts with x and the constants.
Still pretty cryptic, I admit. I’d rather make an example.
Example 2.3
The inequality to be solved is
4x −3 < 2(x −2) + 5.
(2.7)
First, I undo the parenthesis on the right side and summarize the constants here
as well; this gives
4x −3 < 2x + 1.
Now I subtract 2x on both sides of the inequality and add 3 at the same time.
This gives
2x < 4,
thus a linear inequality in standard form. Its solution is x < 2, and this is
therefore also the solution of the initial Eq. (2.7).
Actually, this is always the method, if in an inequality x only occurs
linearly, that is, without a superscript, and also not as input of a function,

40

Inequalities
and also not multiplied by itself: You multiply if necessary, summarize and
then separate all expressions with x from the constants like hazardous waste.
There is no rigid rule for this, I prefer to illustrate the procedure again with an
example.◀
Example 2.4
The inequality to be solved is
−7x + 3 + 5(2x −1) < −(x + 3) + 5,
whose practical relevance I do not want to discuss here; it is just another
example.
Exceptionally without disturbing intermediate comments, I give the trans-
formation steps in the following:
−7x + 3 + 10x −5 < −x −3 + 5
3x −2 < −x + 2
4x < 4
I leave the solution of this to you in my conﬁdence. Little tip: You shouldn’t
land very far from x < 1.◀
And that’s it with this small section, because I think I could already make the
procedure clear with two examples and a few additional remarks.
2.5
Linear Inequalities That Are Not Immediately Obvious
Just like equations—there, under the same heading, I had treated the quadratic
ones exemplarily—there are also inequalities, which are not seen as having the
same simple structure. I will show you some examples.
Example 2.5
The inequality
(x −1) · (1 + 2x) < x · (2x + 5) + 5
(2.8)

2.5
Linear Inequalities That Are Not Immediately Obvious

does not look very linear at ﬁrst glance, but we will see that this is
deceptive.
To simplify the inequality, I ﬁrst multiply both sides out; this leads to
x −1 + 2x2 −2x < 2x2 + 5x + 5
Now I can subtract 2x2 on both sides, which makes this square expression
disappear completely; it just remains
−x −1 < 5x + 5
or
−6x < 6.
The solution to this is (Attention, check learning objectives!)
−1 < x,
that is, all numbers greater than −1.
In order to at least make it plausible to you that we are not making non-
sense here, I would like to insert two numbers from the solution set into the
initial equation and see whether they give a true result. Of course, this is not
a complete sample, but it is a test, after all.
The simplest number x that I can think of for the condition −1 < x is
x = 0. If I insert this value in (2.8), it becomes
−1 < 5,
so a true statement.
The next number that comes to my mind is x = 42 (mathematicians are
strange people). This value makes (2.8) the inequality
3485 < 3743.
This is obviously correct as well.◀

Inequalities
Example 2.6
The second and last example of this small section deals with the inequality
x < (x3 + x2 + x + 1) · (1 −x) + x4.
(2.9)
Doesn’t look very linear either, right? I can understand that, but it’s misleading.
If you multiply the right side of the ﬁgure, you get
(x3 + x2 + x + 1) −(x4 + x3 + x2 + x) + x4.
Here, however, pretty much everything is removed, and only a simple 1
remains; inequality (2.9) is therefore simply
x < 1,
and at the same time is already solved.
So you see: Even if an inequality does not look like a linear one at ﬁrst,
one should not despair and ﬁrst multiply, summarize, and simplify everything
that is possible. Maybe you will be lucky and everything non-linear will stand
out.◀
2.6
Fraction Inequalities
I have saved the most interesting type of inequality I want to introduce to you
until the end: Inequalities in which the unknown (also) occurs in the denominator
of a fraction.
Example 2.7
A ﬁrst example of this is
3x + 2
x
< 4.
(2.10)
Maybe you are thinking: What is the problem, you multiply both sides by x,
then the denominator on the left side disappears and you have a beautiful linear
inequality in front of you? In principle that is correct, BUT:

2.6
Fraction Inequalities
43
Attention! Attention! Attention!
Since one does not yet know whether the denominator, that is, x, is positive
or negative, and since it again depends on whether or not one has to swap both
sides of the inequality after multiplication, one has to distinguish between these
two cases and treat them separately. And this is exactly what I am doing now.
Case 1: 0 < x. In this case I can multiply the inequality (2.10) without
changing anything and get
3x + 2 < 4x,
so the condition
2 < x.
Now toward the end of this booklet you have to concentrate well once again:
In this ﬁrst case, which we are currently investigating, x must therefore fulﬁl
two conditions: It must be greater than 0 due to the case distinction, and it
must be greater than 2 as a result of the transformation. So, in general, these
are two conditions that will contribute to the formulation of the solution, but
in this example—and this will very often be the case—the second condition
is sharper than the ﬁrst one (since any number greater than 2 is automatically
greater than 0), so that in reality only one condition remains here, namely
2 < x.
(2.11)
Case 2: x < 0. In this case, after multiplying, I have to swap the two sides
and get
4x < 3x + 2,
so x < 2. Here now a similar phenomenon occurs as in the ﬁrst case: The
solutions must meet the two conditions x < 0 and x < 2, since the ﬁrst
undoubtedly implies the second, the whole thing is reduced in this second
case to
x < 0.
(2.12)

44
2
Inequalities
The total solution set of the inequality (2.10) thus consists of all numbers x
which satisfy either (2.11) or (2.12), that is, which are either greater than two
or less than zero.
Of course it can happen that the denominator does not only contain an
isolated x; here is an example of this, too.◀
Example 2.8
The inequality to be solved is
x −1
2x + 1 < 1.
(2.13)
Again, the two sign situations of the denominator must be distinguished in two
separate cases.
Case 1: 0 < 2x + 1, so −1
2 < x. In this case I can multiply the inequality
(2.13) and obtain
x −1 < 2x + 1,
so
−2 < x.
So the unknown x must fulﬁll two conditions here too; it must be greater than
−1
2 due to the case distinction and it must be greater than −2 as a result of the
transformation. And just as in the ﬁrst example, one of the two conditions—
here the ﬁrst one—is sharper than the other (since every number greater than
−1
2 is automatically greater than −2), which is why also here in reality only
one condition remains, namely
−1
2 < x.
(2.14)
Case 2: 2x + 1 < 0, so x < −1
2. Here too I multiply the inequality (2.13) by,
but now I have to reverse the two sides and obtain
2x + 1 < x −1,

2.6
Fraction Inequalities
45
so x < −2. As in case 1, here too we have two conditions on x, namely
x < −1
2 and x < −2, one of which automatically entails the other. In case 2,
the solution is therefore
x < −2.
(2.15)
There are no more cases, since 2x + 1 certainly must not be zero, so that I
can extract from (2.14) and (2.15) the solution set of the inequality (2.13); it
consists of all numbers which are either greater than −2 or less than −1
2.
If you would like to have another formal language version at the end of this
text: The solution set of (2.15) is
L =

x ∈I R|x < −2 or −1
2 < x

.
◀
A third and—to your consolation—last example should help you to practice the
procedure and at the same time show that a solution does not exist in every case.
Example 2.9
This last example concerns the inequality.
2x −6
x −1 < 0.
(2.16)
Here too, of course, I must distinguish between two cases:
Case 1: 0 < x −1, so 1 < x. In this case, I can multiply by the denominator
without swapping the sides of the inequality and obtain 2x −6 < 0 (since the
right hand side is multiplied by zero)
x < 3.
(2.17)
There are two conditions: 1 < x and x < 3. This time, neither of them implies
the other, so both must be taken into account. The solution set thus consists of
all numbers x that are simultaneously greater than 1 and less than 3, that is,
that lie between 1 and 3 on the number line.
Case 2: x −1 < 0, so x < 1. Here too I can multiply by the denominator,
but now I have to swap the sides of the inequality 0 < 2x −6 and obtain

46
2
Inequalities
6 < 2x or
3 < x.
(2.18)
A possible solution x of the inequality would thus have to be both smaller than
1 and larger than 3. However, such a number has not been invented until today,
therefore in this case there is no solution of the inequality (2.16), and the only
solutions are those which resulted in case 1.
I consider it didactically appropriate, at the end of this book, to give you
the rule for solving such fractional inequalities only after the examples; when
you have read it, perhaps you can work through the three examples of this
section again after that.◀
Rule
To solve a linear fractional inequality of the form
ax + b
cx + d < e,
where a, b, c, d, and e are numbers, and c and d must not be zero at the same
time, one proceeds as follows
• A distinction is made between the two cases 0 < cx + d and cx + d < 0.
• Case 1: 0 < cx+d. Multiply by the denominator and you get the linear inequality
ax + b < ecx + ed,
which can be solved using the methods described above. Then the solution condition
obtained in this way must be reconciled with the condition 0 < cx + d. Depending
on the situation, the following cases can occur:
• One of the two conditions implies the other; then only the stricter condition needs
to be taken into account to formulate the solution.
• Both conditions can be fulﬁlled at the same time and neither implies the other;
then both conditions must be taken into account when formulating the solution.
• The two conditions are contradictory, that is, if one is fulﬁlled, the other is
violated; then there is no solution in case 1.

– Case 2: cx + d < 0. Multiply by the denominator and you get the linear
inequality
ecx + ed < ax + b.
Know-it-all info
No, actually not an info, but more an invitation to think, because in the meantime
you are the know-it-all: Why must c and d not be zero at the same time?
This brings us to the end of this booklet. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
By the way, if you were waiting for me to introduce you to quadratic inequalities,
I have to disappoint you: Quadratic inequalities can be quite violent, and since this
text, according to its subtitle, is (also) addressed to non-mathematicians, I wanted
to spare you this. We have already achieved enough together.

What You Learned From This essential
• Linear equations always have exactly one solution, which can easily be
determined
• There are also ready-made solution formulas for quadratic equations
• Often complicated looking equations, for example root or fractional equations,
can be traced back to quadratic or even linear equations and thus be solved
quite easily
• Solving inequalities is not as difﬁcult as one often believes
