Note: This chapter is mainly focusing on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The analysis of the former is fairly independent from the 
particularities of space particle dualism theory (SPD), while the later depends sensitively on it. I 
do not account for the SPD-specific intergalactic distances until very late in this chapter. This 
chapter is concentrating on the emergent universe hypothesis and the influence of so-called 
‘abundance of future observation’, but it turns out that at least one aspect of the SDSS is in fact a 
result of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). For details on BAO, see chapter 4.16.  
 
Since the Copernican revolution people have been asking themselves if there is life on other planets. 
If we are not the centre of the world, then it would be reasonable to assume that life exists in other 
parts of the universe as well. For long time people were speculating about life on Mars or even 
Venus. Probes have been sent to both Mars and Venus and didn’t find any signs for life there – not 
even micro-organisms. Even until today, there is no scientific evidence for life elsewhere in the 
solar system.  
 
Is it possible to detect life on an interstellar scale? In the last 70 years we have sent television 
signals out into all directions of space. These signals are, at least in principle, detectable in a radius 
of 70 light years already. With our current technology we would not be able to detect any signals 
from such a distance. But if the signals are sent out and concentrated into a certain direction in 
space, then they become detectable even with our current technology. It would not be too much of 
an effort for a highly advanced civilization to send such signals into the direction of all potentially 
life bearing planets.  
How many alien civilizations would one expect to find in our galaxy? In 1961 the astronomer 
Frank Drake tried to approach this question with his famous equation, now known as the Drake 
equation. If 𝑅∗ is the average rate of star formation in our galaxy, 𝑓𝑝 the fraction of stars with 
planets, 𝑛𝑒 the number of planets that potentially support life,  𝑓𝑙 the fraction of those planets that 
actually develop life, 𝑓𝑖 the fraction of those life bearing planets which develop intelligent civilized 
life, 𝑓𝑐 the fraction of those civilizations which develop communication technology and 𝐿 the 
length of time over which those technological civilizations exist, then the number of intelligent 
civilizations with telecommunication technology in our galaxy should be:  
 
𝑁= 𝑅∗× 𝑓𝑝× 𝑛𝑒× 𝑓𝑙× 𝑓𝑖× 𝑓𝑐× 𝐿 
 

𝑅∗ is estimated to be 7 stars a year.1 𝑓𝑝 was estimated 0.2 −0.3 back in 1961, but recently it 
became evident that every star has planets orbiting it, so that it is actually 1. 2, 3 A study from 2013 
estimated that about 40% of stars have earth-sized planets in their habitable zone.4, 5 So 𝑛𝑒= 0.4. 
If all of these planets would develop intelligent civilizations, and if these civilizations wouldn’t 
get lost, then we would have about 40 billion intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way. One way 
to get less than that is to choose numbers for 𝑓𝑙, 𝑓𝑖 or 𝑓𝑐 that are smaller than 1, which is equivalent 
to saying that the development of life is very unlikely even on planets which potentially support 
life (small 𝑓𝑙), or that the evolution up to intelligent life is very unlikely (small 𝑓𝑖). If we assume 
that RNA, which is the predecessor of DNA, formed out of random collisions of molecules, then 
a small 𝑓𝑙 would be plausible. According to estimates from Frankis Crick, one of the discoverers 
of the DNA structure, the chance to get such a structure out of random molecule collisions is about 
1 to 10260 (!).6 On the other hand life developed rather early in history. Fossils of the first simple 
life forms can be as old as 4.1 billion years, while earth itself is 4.5 billion years old. The time 
difference here is basically just the time it took for earth to cool down to a level where it could 
support simple cellular life. At that time there was not even any oxygen in the atmosphere – that 
came 1.1 billion years later. Some say, if life formed that early on earth, its emergence should be 
a natural law, and not an exception. This would suggest a value for 𝑓𝑙 close to 1. Various 
researches suspect the formation of first RNA and then DNA to be much more likely than 
originally suggested by Cricks. They point out that various substances have the tendency to form 
double helix-like structures naturally and spontaneously in salty water.7  
 
There are two classic ways to deal with the early formation of life. One approach is the hypothesis 
that the fabric of space-time somehow supports the formation of life. The other is that primitive 
life (or at least RNA) emerged in cosmic clouds and came to earth on meteoroids – this was Crick’s 
approach. Yet the fact that there is no cellular life at all on Mars speaks against this hypothesis. 
Also there is not much to gain from extending the time for the formation of RNA a few billion 
years further into the past. That doesn’t make it much more likely. But in both cases, we would 
expect life to emerge wherever there are suitable environmental conditions.  
 
If we now really take 𝑓𝑙 to be 1, what can we say about 𝑓𝑖 and 𝑓𝑐? It is true that only one species 
out of so many on earth developed high intelligence, civilization and technology? If that is the case, 
then it seems to be a highly improbable path for life to take. But are Homo sapiens really the sole 
species that developed intelligence? The Neanderthal reached a level of evolution comparable to 
that of Homo sapiens, but he was wiped out. What prevents today’s apes from evolving into 
humans? It is basically only the fact that we already occupy this ecological niche. From this 
perspective the evolution to intelligent life does not seem unlikely at all.  
 
There are deep mysteries in the mechanism of evolution, especially the evolution of algorithms, to 
which we will come back to in chapter 4.20, but for the present issue it is enough to know that 𝑓𝑙, 
𝑓𝑖 and 𝑓𝑐 are probably all close to 1.  
 
The only remaining way to reduce the number of intelligent civilizations in the Milky Way is to 
choose a small number for 𝐿, which equals saying that intelligent life is ‘self-destructive’. An 
indicator of that is the ‘atomic threat’. Atomic bombs present on earth now would be enough to 
wipe out all human life on this planet. In 1966 the astronomer Karl Sagan speculated that this may 

explain why we haven’t received any signals from extraterrestrial civilizations.8 Stephen Hawking 
also became a supporter of this view.  
 
I don’t find this convincing: technology allows humans to protect themselves from natural disasters 
and even impacts of meteoroids. Intelligence should allow them to survive longer or even for a 
potentially unlimited time. And even if self-destruction is likely, it would be hard to imagine that 
all 40  billion intelligent civilizations destroyed themselves shortly after developing 
communication technology. The life expectation of telecommunication civilizations really doesn’t 
have to be very high to lead to big numbers for 𝑁. Assuming that 𝑓𝑙, 𝑓𝑖 and 𝑓𝑐 are all 1, we have 
2.8 times the life expectancy of a typical civilization. With a ridiculously small 𝐿 = 100 yr we 
already get 280  civilizations. A more realistic 𝐿 = 1000 yr  gives us 2,800  intelligent 
civilizations, and so on.  
 
It would take only one out of 40 billion civilizations to be more cautious and live longer, and we 
would have a highly advanced civilization which could conquer the whole galaxy. Even with 
technology not much more advanced than ours it would be possible to send out so-called Von 
Neumann probes which could plant life on all life supporting planets across the galaxy. A 
civilization could also choose to build large space ships as big as cities which could harbour 
generations of people, plants and animals. According to estimates by Paul Davis and John Gribbin 
it would take about 10 million years to colonize the galaxy using currently reachable speeds. This 
is a small number compared to the age of the Milky Way itself, and it becomes even smaller when 
better technology is used. Because of the missing air friction, momentum is always conserved in 
outer space, even when there is no thrust. Therefore it would be easy to accelerate a space craft to 
let’s say 90% the speed of light, by dropping a large number of atomic bombs one after another 
behind it. Thereby a galaxy could be colonized in much shorter time. Even if it would still be hard 
to cross the whole galaxy, stellar neighbours would have no problem visiting us. At 90% the speed 
of light, a spacecraft could reach the next star in about 5 years. Even if the home planet of a 
civilization got destroyed, it could reach a life supporting planet circling another star, just by using 
technology only slightly more advanced than ours.  
 
This brings us to the Fermi paradox: if life exists in various places across the Milky Way, then it 
would be, considering the relatively young age of earth, very hard to see why advanced 
civilizations didn’t already form millions of years before. 9 Wouldn’t such civilizations have 
colonized the whole Milky Way already? 
 
When we look out to the night sky, we do not see it like it is now, but how it was in the past. In 
relativity theory we would not worry much about this, since things exist there without being 
observed. But in quantum theory it is much different: here things have to be observed in order to 
be in certain states. As mentioned in chapter 1.2 space particle dualism can only work if there is a 
distinct conscious now-slice. Although we have certain quantum states all over the border of the 
collective past light cone, a hypothetic alien on this past light cone couldn’t be conscious. It 
couldn’t be an observer as well, because it is not on the conscious now-slice. Such an alien could 
not collapse a wavefunction. If we would allow that, we would end up with conscious light cones 
all over space-time, and that would at the end result in fixed quantum states for the whole of space-
time. As mentioned in chapter 1.2 that would wipe out all quantum effects, and bring us back to a 
classical space-time.  

 
Aside from that we have to remind ourselves that from a real quantum perspective the spacetime 
view on reality is of mere illustrative nature and should not be taken literally. The philosophy of 
quantum gravity should be based on a refusal of the spacetime paradigm.  
 
This seems all fine, but what about the people around us? Light always needs time to reach us, 
even on earth. So other people should also lie on our past light cones. Yet that doesn’t make them 
unconscious. Believing so would bring us to solipsism. Indeed, Eugene Wigner argued that it leads 
to solipsism! However, we know better: the difference between people around us and a remote 
alien is that all particles on earth are endlessly entangled with each other. That makes them all 
belong to a single large wavefunction 𝛹, which collapses in some places, but grows in other places; 
all at the same time. It is this oneness, or inter-entangledness, of the wavefunction that creates the 
conscious now-slice 𝑆 (the ‘eye’  being a symbol for consciousness).10 The wavefunction of 
the universe can then be written as 
 
|𝛹𝑈〉= |1〉+ |2〉+ ⋯+ |n〉+ |A〉+ |B〉+ ⋯; 1, 2, … , A, B, C, … ∈Ι
− 
 
With |n〉 being the various mutually entangled conscious observers and |A〉, |B〉, … various 
objects they observe.11 All of them have to lie on the conscious past light cone Ι
−.12 The future 
light cone I+ on the other hand is not of particular interest for the wave function. Nothing on it is 
in a certain state. Things within the borders of Ι
− are partially in a certain state. The ability of 
observers in P or P (the symbol  representing earth) to reconstruct the past is bound to a low 
entropy condition on earth.  
 
 
Fig. 27. Light rays which constitute the border of the future of event 𝐸2, reach the point 𝑃 of the 
conscious observer. That leads to the collapse of the wave function for 𝐸2. The past of 𝐸2, 
namely 𝐸1, was measured by 𝑃 before, but that was some time before. The ability to reconstruct 
𝐸1 depends sensitively on low entropy in the region 𝑃. The future of 𝐸2, namely 𝐸3, although 
being on our now-slice, is completely uncertain. It has not been measured yet. We can say that 
only the past of 𝐸3, namely 𝐸2 exists, but not the present. sketch from the 19th May 2005 
 
On a cosmic scale all observers are positioned in the same point P which represents earth. And on 
a terrestrial scale, distances are too small to require any analysis with space-time diagrams. If we 
take 𝛪
− to be the past light cone of collective consciousness, then the point P has to be replaced by 

a zigzag structure ‘vvvvv’ when zooming in on it. As the number of conscious observers in the 
universe grows, the number of entangled conscious light cones grows.

Only if the universe starts off with a single conscious light cone, all light cones can be entangled. 
Places in space-time beyond the light cone of a certain observer are called ‘elsewhere’. If the light 
cone we are looking at is the joint light cone of collective consciousness, then this ‘elsewhere’ is 
just nothingness. Something which has never been measured must be in a state of maximal 
superposition. Such a state can be called ‘Omnium’ and is equal to non-existence. If we allow 
‘states’ in the ‘elsewhere’ to collapse into consciousness inhabited states, even if it is only on the 
conscious now-slice, it would happen immediately all over an endless universe. That would lead 
to several problems:  
 
1. Things on the past light cones of different unentangled observers in remote places of the 
universe would have to be in accordance with each other. Having an independent wave function, 
this is hard to achieve. It would mean having things outside the wavefunction influencing 
things inside. 
2. The conscious now-slice is built by entanglement. It is hard to see how those alien observers 
could emerge on the same now-slice.  
3. The quantum state of a past earth now observed by aliens in a remote place in the universe 
would have to be dependent both on the state of the present earth and the state which 
manifested through the observation of those aliens. Basically, the wavefunction could no 
longer represent the maximal accessible knowledge, because things that have never been 
measured could be in certain states already.  
4. Nothing could tell us how many of those other civilization would have to emerge on the now 
slice. Without restrictions we could have basically anything emerging from this Omnium.  
 
Then we also have to look at how life emerges. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the 
whole past of the universe was fixed in the moment consciousness emerged. If that is true, a part 
of the evolution on earth ‘happened’ completely in superposition. That brings us to point 5: 
 
5. If it is the emergence of consciousness which teleologically determines the formation of RNA 
and DNA in a superpositioned past, then those other civilizations across the universe would 
have had to emerge all at the same time, because a planet which is unceasingly observed in its 
early history could not develop life.  
 
Before we said that allowing the emergence of (unentangled) conscious observers on our past light 
cone would lead to endless many conscious now-slices all across space-time, and would thereby 
destroy all superpositions. Allowing for conscious observers emerging all across the unobserved 
parts of our conscious now-slice would not destroy superpositions, but it would restrict them a lot. 
Not only the boundary of the past 𝛪
− is in a certain state, but basically the entire space-time region 
enclosed by 𝛪
−. However, the degree of certainty within different regions enclosed by 𝛪
− depends 

on local entropy conditions. The past of a black hole for example is totally uncertain. Having a 
universe full of conscious observers on 𝑆 we would have the whole endlessly vast past region 
below the surface 𝑆 in a fixed state, leaving just the little gap regions between the light cones 
undetermined.  
That could be a problem for consciousness, because photons which have been measured at some 
time in the past don’t lead to as much superpositioning in the brain as ‘Omnium-photons’ do.  
 
If we are the only conscious observers in the universe, and the above strongly suggest that, then 
what is within our cosmological horizon should be everything that exists. Our past light cones 
would be all there is of the universe. Only within these cones there would be a certain quantum 
state. Yet even the people we see around us lie on our past light cones, because light needs time to 
get to us.  
 
Different people lying on each other’s past light cones can still belong to the same reality, because 
they are connected through entanglement, allowing their wavefunctions to change all at the same 
time. That means we live on a conscious now-slice of space-time which is created through quantum 
entanglement. This notion of a distinct present was unknown to the theory of relativity, but it 
becomes necessary if we introduce the quantum measurement into the picture.  
 
Other stars and galaxies are incomparably farther away from us. Their light needs hundreds, 
thousands or even billion years to travel to us. When we look at the night sky, we are not looking 
at the universe as it is today, but as it was in the past. Our observation is therefore only measuring 
the past, not the present.  
 
In our immediate environment measuring photons equals measuring the objects that emit them, 
because the distances the photons have to travel are tiny; yet for the photons of stars and galaxies 
the distances are huge, so that measuring photons does there not equal measuring the objects that 
emit them. Therefore, the ocean of photons the earth resides in represents merely an ocean of 
potential existence which turns into reality just in the very moment we decide to visit those other 
places in the universe.  
 
So, stars do not exist on our now-slice, but only on our past light cone, while things near to us are 
entangled with us, and can therefore co-exist with us. Only our immediate environment, the 
biosphere is in a certain state, ‘right now’.  
 
Arriving here some might be tempted to search for a last resort in speculating that heat photons 
emitted by earth could spread entanglement into the outer cosmos. However, these photons are 
propagating into the future and form the border of our future 𝐼+. Nothing on the 𝐼+ hyper-surface 
is in a certain state, so there is not really anything to get entangled with.  
 
Regions of the ‘elsewhere’ which are part of 𝑆 and which are close to 𝛪
− have been measured 
very recently and stayed unmeasured for only a short time. Can they be in certain states? The 
answer is no. Quantum states get fuzzy very quick after measurement. Unceasing measurement is 
what makes this quantum world appear classic at a macroscopic scale. 
 
Still, we cannot be sure how far beyond earth entanglement reaches, if at all. Surely there is 

entanglement between us and the pioneer probes which already left our solar system. Some 
properties of their constituent particles are fixed instantaneously as particles on earth that are 
entangled with them are measured. However, their overall state is measured hours later, since light 
from them needs to travel large distances to arrive to us here on earth.  
 
Even if we had a whole planet entangled with our planet, it still wouldn’t support the independent 
formation of life there. The formation of RNA and the subsequent formation of DNA has to happen 
in a vast superposition. Very much like in Wheeler’s delayed choice experiment (see chapter 2.5), 
the future has to determine the past.  
 
Although the above argumentation could have been derived from the standard Von-Neumann 
interpretation and special relativity alone, it is the concept of a distinct present, a conscious now-
slice, which allows for a systematic reasoning in this realm. We can therefore say that it is a 
prediction of space particle dualism theory, that 
 
§ There is no alien life. All life can only exist if connected through entanglement. 
 
This is very much like a reversal of the Copernican revolution. Leaving out quantum mechanics, 
earth is in a random position in the universe, orbiting a random star, in a random galaxy, being part 
of a random galaxy cluster. But when considering quantum mechanics, earth is the center of this 
world, being the only place where things are in a certain state, and also the only place where life 
exists.  
 
In space particle dualism theory, everything has to see or affect each other, otherwise it falls into 
non-existence. So in this theory, the world is much smaller than in theories without state reduction: 
no hyperspace, no colliding universes, no baby-universes born out of black holes or even just out 
of vacuum fluctuations at the Planck-scale, and all the other materialistic hocus pocus. In this 
idealist world view the world ends where observation ends.  
 
Of course, having no alien life forms might be pretty disappointing for many. It does also appear 
very unusual for a scientific theory to predict the non-existence of alien life forms. The normal 
scientific, and very reasonable, argument is that if life is a natural phenomenon, it must be very 
common all over the universe, otherwise it would look like something created by a god.  
Although this prediction sounds odd, it does solve the Fermi-paradox. If life is common in the 
Milky Way, then it is strange that developed civilizations didn’t form millions of years before us. 
Even if most destroy themselves shortly after developing the technology required for space travel 
and far range communication, there would still be a few which didn’t. Given the enormous amount 
of time that already passed since the beginning of physical time, they should have already 
colonized most parts of the Milky Way. But they didn’t. Why is that? The answer I am proposing 
here is: because they do not and cannot exist.  
 
What if we find alien life one day? Would that disprove space particle dualism theory? Potentially 
yes, but not if it could be shown that we share a common origin with them, for example in the way 
that they ‘planted’ us. However, it would make less sense to plant just the seeds for evolution and 
not a fully developed range of species.  
I am quite confident that the SETI program will continue to find no signs of extraterrestrial life.  

 
Besides SETI constantly failing to detect signals from (intelligent) alien life and exoplanet surveys 
also failing to find a single planet with an atmosphere shaped by biological organisms, is there still 
other evidence indicating that earth is special and that we are alone in the universe?  
 
Indeed, there is! There is overwhelming evidence that earth being the only place where 
wavefunctions collapse had a tremendous impact on the overall structure of the universe. This is 
evident from the analysis of various large-scale structures in the universe. In 2005 Lawrence 
Krauss held a lecture where he mentioned disturbing anomalies in the cosmic microwave 
background (CMB); he said:  
 
“… But when you look at the CMB map, you also see that the structure that is observed is in fact, 
in a weird way, correlated with the plane of the earth around the sun. Is this Copernicus coming 
back to haunt us? That’s crazy. We are looking out at the whole universe. There’s no way there 
should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun – the plane of the 
earth around the sun – the ecliptic. That would say we are truly at the center of the universe.”13 
 
What he was talking about is generally referred to as the ‘axis of evil’, a line through the microwave 
background which separates hotter and colder spots. The axis itself is a hot spot and less mysterious, 
because it is caused by the redshift due to the motion of the earth around the sun. What makes an 
anomaly out of it is the alignment with other structures above and below it. It turns out that if one 
connects the cold spots with straight lines, those lines intersect exactly where earth is. It was also 
noted that the sky above this axis is slightly hotter than the sky below and that the cold spots seem 
to be aligned in shape with this axis. However, those big cold and hot spots were not very distinct, 
because they were covered with an ocean of smaller irregularities, so that it was easy for the 
scientific community to ignore them.  
 
Max Tegmark heard of these anomalies in the CMB and decided to analyze them with a computer 
program by splitting up the CMB into so-called spherical harmonics. This aims to smudge out the 
small irregularities and leave only a predetermined number of big ones. Choosing 1, we see only 
the axis of evil. Choosing 2 and 3, more cold spots appear above and below it (see fig. 28 & 29).  
Same as Krauss, Tegmark thought the anomalies might disappear when more exact measures of 
the CMB from the Planck satellite telescope are available. In 2013 they became available, but the 
anomalies remained.  
 

 
Fig. 28. The ‘axis of evil’ among which hot and cold spots in the microwave background are 
arranged on.14  
 
 
Fig. 29. If we project the microwave background onto a sphere, we find that this ‘axis of evil’ 
roughly coincides with the orbit axis of the earth around the sun.  
 
But this is not all. As Professor John Hartnett from Australia pointed out, there also seems to be a 
general asymmetry in the intergalactic matter distribution around us. When analyzing the 
distribution of photon frequencies, it turns out that most photons prefer to have frequencies which 
are natural multiples of ∆z ≈0.027 . That means a majority of galaxies is concentrated in 
concentric shells around us (!). These concentric shells of higher galaxy concentration lie with a 
distance of about 250 million light-years from each other (see fig. 30 & 31).15 
 

 
Fig. 30. Large scale distribution of galaxies in the universe according to the “Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey” (SDSS).  
 
 
Fig. 31. The galaxies seem to lie on concentric shells with a distance of about 250 million light 
years.  

 
This non-Copernican periodic structure in the galaxy distribution has a likelihood of only 1: 1669 
to have formed by chance and appears impossible to explain when adhering to decoherence theory 
where consciousness plays a rather passive role accounting only for the here merely subjective 
separation of realities. It can only be explained when accepting the role that the Von Neumann-
Wigner interpretation foresees for consciousness, having it creating reality by causing the 
reduction of the wavefunction all over an endlessly vast but death universe.16 
 
Why this number? Why are those concentric spheres of higher galaxy density arranged in a 
distance of about 250 million light years from each other? When I first heard of this number, it 
immediately reminded me of the roughly 240 million years it takes for the sun to both orbit around 
the center of our galaxy and to pass from one major spiral arm to the next and how this was linked 
to mass extinction events on earth due to the higher rate of asteroid impacts and supernova 
explosions within the spiral arms, by a team around M.D. Filipovic in 2013.17  
 
What is the connection? After each mass extinction there is a new ‘explosion of life’ and this may 
lead to a higher density of galaxies, because the outer universe only slowly crystallizes out from a 
vast superposition into a certain state by the act of observation by conscious observers.  
 
But this is not the only way to link the distance between these concentric spheres and the passage 
time of our sun from one spiral arm to the next. Even within the spiral arms of our galaxy tragic 
events do not occur on a regular basis. Furthermore, tragic events leading to mass extinction do 
not only occur within the spiral arms, and there is no guaranty that the biggest such events would 
occur only during the passage through a spiral arm. But what is fundamentally different during the 
time of a spiral arm passage, is that the view to the outside universe is not as clear as in the middle 
between two spiral arms. 18, 19 Huge gas clouds are obscuring the sight, which leads to a less 
frequent measurement of quantum states beyond our galaxy.20 
 
As mentioned before, the sun’s galactic orbit period, which is 240 myr,21 is also roughly the time 
the sun needs to get from one spiral arm to the next. For being related to the 250 million light 
years for the spacing of the concentric shells discovered by Hartnett, the travel from one spiral arm 
to the next must take an additional 10 million years.  
 
Only if the travel from one spiral arm to the next takes exactly 250  million years, the here 
presented scheme can work.  
 
There are several uncertainties here. The milky way galaxy was first believed to be a barred spiral 
galaxy with only two spiral arms, while today most scientists suggest a four spiral arms structure. 
Yet the testimony of the surveys conducted is ambiguous: When traced by old stars the milky way 
appears to have two spiral arms (see fig. 32), and when traced by gas and young stars it appears to 
have four spiral arms (see fig 33).22  
 

 
Fig. 32. NGC 3200, an example for a barred spiral galaxy with only two spiral arms. 
 
 
Fig. 33. UGC 12158, an example for a galaxy believed to resemble the milky way quite closely 
in shape. 
 
Furthermore, there is a big uncertainty in the spiral arm rotation period: according to recent 
estimates from Ortwin Gerhard from the Max Planck institute in Germany the pattern rotation 
period could range anywhere from 220 to 360 myr.23  
With two spiral arms the rotation period of the milkyway galaxy has to be double the galactic orbit 
period of the sun for the sun to re-enter a spiral arm after one orbit:  
 
240 myr × 2 = 480 myr 
 
This is already above the values suggested by the aforementioned recent estimates (220  to 
360 myr) and therefore it seems that we have to dismiss this possibility. Furthermore, the evidence 
of the last 15 years is increasingly pointing at a four spiral arm structure. 24, 25, 26 
With four spiral arms the galaxy must have an orbit period which is 1.25 times the galactic orbit 
period of the sun. That yields 
 

240 myr + 240
4
= 300 myr 
 
For this to be related to the 250 mlyr spacing of the concentric shell pattern of our universe, the 
re-entrance must happen 10 myr after one full orbit. Thus, the rotation period of the milky way 
galaxy has to be 
 
240 myr + 240
4 + (250 −240) = 310 myr 
 
This is within the present estimates (220 to 360 myr).  
The big uncertainty in the pattern rotation period arises from the spiral arms not being solid objects 
but merely density waves (somewhat similar to a traffic jam) which propagate at a different speed 
than the stars, that is, nothing moves at their orbit speed, and therefore there isn’t any straight 
forward direct measurement one can do to determine this pattern speed.  
 
So, what can we do? What about the various theories linking spiral arm passages to things on earth, 
such as mass extinctions and variations in the overall temperature? They must be based on some 
pattern rotation speed and by examining the evidence that exists for these theories we may be able 
to determine the pattern speed.  
 
Some have linked mass extinctions to something that can be easier known, namely the oscillation 
period in the suns galactic orbit, which is 70 million years, resulting in the sun passing through 
the midplane every 35 million years and being in it about 100,000 years.27 Yet of course there 
must be a spiral arm where the sun passes through the midplane, otherwise there won’t be a 
significant increase in star density.  
 
When studying the various proposals, one quickly realizes that most of them suggest periods of 
spiral arm passages of only about 100 million years. The cosmologist Nir J. Shaviv from the Racah 
Institute of Physics in Israel made extensive research on a link between ice ages and passages 
through spiral arms. The passage period he suggests is 135 ± 25 million years.28, 29 As his research 
shows every ice age can be linked to the passage through one of the Milky Way’s various spiral 
arms (see fig. 34). 
Furthermore, he did not try to make the spiral arm pattern rotation speed fit his theory, but rather 
he made a very careful study of all ever-proposed rotation periods and made a meticulous analysis 
to support the value he chose, which is 11 .0 km s−1 kpc−1.  
 

 
Fig. 34. Each time we enter a spiral arm there is a new ice-age. fig. taken from Shaviv (2002)28 
 
What about the initially mentioned study by M. D. Filipovic linking mass extinction to passages 
through spiral arms? What speed do they use? It is 11.9 km s−1 kpc−1  and based on previous 
research by Andrew Overholt (2009). That is very close to the value used by Shaviv, and both of 
them don’t appear to have tuned this value in order to fit their theory. That means the more recent 
estimate by Ortwin Gerhard that give a great uncertainty about the pattern rotation period must be 
overly pessimistic.  
 
What evidence is there for mass extinctions to be linked to passages through spiral arms? Filipovic 
and his team looked at six major mass extinctions and five ‘lesser mass extinctions’ in the past 500 
million years. As shown in fig. 35 all of these eleven extinction events seem to have happened 
during a passage through a spiral arm.  
 
 
Fig. 35. The Milky Way model (left) based on Churchwell et al. (2008) and a slightly modified 
model with an extra sub-arm hidden on the other side of the galaxy.  
The blue circles represent the major mass extinctions, while the orange circles represent ‘minor 
mass extinctions’. fig. taken from Filipovic (2013)17 
 
According to their model we spend about 60% of the time in spiral arms and the chance for all 
nine events to lie within spiral arms purely accidentally is 0.36%.  
Both the ice-age theory and the mass extinction theory are based on almost the same pattern speed. 
What pattern rotation period does it correspond to? It is 500 million years! Looking again at fig. 

35 we notice that although there are many thinner spiral arms all over the place, there are only two 
regions where all spiral arms come together and where the star density must be highest and that is 
besides the two sides of the central bulk. Although the thinner arms are able to cause mass 
extinctions and ice-ages, they probably don’t significantly obscure the sight to the outside universe 
and therefore don’t influence how the universe is build up retrospectively (with the future 
observation collapsing the wavefunction of the past universe).  
 
According to Filipovic it takes the sun 500 million years to pass through all spiral arms. That 
means it takes the sun 250 million years to get from one side of the bulk to the other. That are the 
250 million years we were looking for.  
 
While Filipovic and his team could only be 99.64% sure that their findings are not due to mere 
chance, combined with the here presented theory on the emergence of the concentric shell structure, 
we can raise the certainty to 99.9976%.  
 
Let’s now re-examine the Sloan Digital Sky map (fig. 30) and see what other features draw our 
attention. Most viewers take particular note of the huge galaxy density on the left, which represents 
the Sloan great wall. It is 433 Mpc long (about 1.4 billion light years), and about one billion light 
years away from earth.30 But it is not just this wall which draws the viewers’ attention. The galaxy 
density on the left side appears to be greater in general! The left side is the northern hemisphere. 
The CfA2 Great Wall and the Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall also happen to be located in 
the northern hemisphere. Fig. 38 shows the gross difference between the galaxy density in the 
northern hemisphere (left) and the southern hemisphere (right):  
 
 
Fig. 36. Gross left right asymmetry in the galaxy distribution between the northern (left) and the 
southern hemisphere (right). fig. taken from Hartnett (2008)10 
 
Re-examining Fig. 30 and 31 we notice that this north-south asymmetry exists there as well. Since 
the galaxy formation is determined by the initial matter density distribution as reflected in the 
CMB, it is natural to have a correspondence in structure here. And it shows that this asymmetry 
can’t be just due to a neater cartographing of the northern hemisphere.  
 
Why do we have such a higher galaxy distribution density on the northern hemisphere? Using the 

same explanation pattern as previously, we may attribute this to the fact that earth is located above 
the equator plane of the milky way by about 75 to 101 light years towards the northern galactic 
hemisphere.31 That makes us measuring the northern hemisphere with a slightly higher frequency. 
However, the layer of galactic gas orthogonal to the galactic plane is not very thick, and the 
difference is not big. Also, during the suns orbit around the center of the milky way it crosses the 
galactic equator, so that the time spend above and below the equator is more or less the same.  
 
A more promising way of explanation is to be found on the surface of earth: 67.3% of the land 
mass is to be found on the northern hemisphere of the earth. Since only very few photons can reach 
out deep enough below the surface of the water in order to influence conscious observers there, 
we can, in a first simplified approach, ignore the sea, and assume that the southern hemisphere of 
the night sky is measured with a 32.7% lower frequency.32  
 
If this model is correct, it would show that there was conscious life on earth since many spiral arm 
passages of the sun. When consciousness newly emerged on earth, the rest of the universe was still 
in maximal superposition; its structure was not settled. Although it was physically some billion 
years old, it was not really out there in a certain sense. It was created in a top to bottom manner by 
being looked at, having the habituated future determining the unhabituated past. That means it 
spend the first 9.6 billion years in a maximal superposition, an omnium-like state of all possible 
states and all possible pasts, and all its structure, including the concentric shells of higher galaxy 
distribution were not created before the emergence of consciousness (sentient) beings on earth.  
We can imagine conscious beings sending shockwaves out to the universe causing wavefunctions 
to collapse. It is like dropping stones on a water surface. When one periodically stops dropping the 
stones into the water there will be gaps between the areas with a lot of waves. Those are the gaps 
between the concentric shells of higher galaxy distribution. Those gaps are caused by photons from 
these regions never being measured by sentient beings and therefore never having existed. Areas 
of the universe which happen to have sent out photons successfully detected by conscious 
observers would then be fuller of matter. After all, only a photon which is finally measured at some 
point is a real photon. Its whole being together with its past can only come into existence by the 
process of measurement by a conscious observer.  
 
If 7 is the total number of these concentric shells of higher galaxy distribution, then conscious life 
on earth could be about 1.75 billion years old. Yet multicellular life started 1.5 billion years ago. 
If we assume that the emergence of multicellular life marks the emergence of consciousness, then 
there can’t be more than 6 concentric shells of higher galaxy distribution.  
It may well be that the seventh concentric shell can be dismissed as statistically not significant 
enough, or that multicellular life started earlier. Further research has to show if one of these two 
possibilities is true.  
Let’s now have a closer look at the distribution of galaxies and compare it with the biological 
evolution. In fig. 37 we have the Sloan digital sky map laid besides a table on the history of life 
on earth.  
 

 
Fig. 37. A comparison between patterns in the distribution of large scale structures in the 
universe on the left, and events in the evolution of life on earth on the right. One concentric shell 
corresponds to 250 million years.  
Note: As we will see later, SPD has a different scaling.  
 
Now let’s look at where the galaxy distribution is highest.  
It is on the third shell, at a distance of about 750 million light years. On the table on the right we 
have the ediacara biota, which lasted from 635 myr ago till 542 myr ago. It peaked in the Avalon 
explosion 575 myr ago. Then we have the Cambrian explosion, which began 541 myra and lasted 
20  or 25  million years. If we take the two together, we have a time span from 635 myra  till 
516 myra (or 521 myra). Including all of the Cambrian period, which lasted for 55.6 myr, we 
have a span from 635 myra  till 485.4 myra . The highest concentration of galaxies we find 
between the third and the second shell, which corresponds to 750 myra till 500 myra. As we see, 
there is a rough correspondence here. We have to keep in mind that there is no chance to have a 
peak of galaxy distribution density at a distance of let’s say 635 mlyr, because that would be in 
between two shells, corresponding to a time when earth was hidden in a spiral arm. However, as 
the map shows, there seems to have been a lot of conscious activity on earth even beyond 750 mlyr. 
The sponge-like animal Otavia antiqua emerged 760 myra in the Tonian period (1000 myra till 
720 myra).33 The first metazoans (animals by biologic definition) are believed to have appeared 
800 myra. That matches the super dense third shell pretty well. We may now look at all the known 
megastructures within the conscious sphere (the 6 or 7 shells corresponding to 1.5 billion lyr) and 
their distances:  
 
CfA2 Great Wall (Northern Great Wall; the Wall): from 300 mlyr till 500 mlyr. 
Sculptor Wall (Southern Great Wall): at a distance of 434 mlyr (z = 0.03). 
Sloan Great Wall: at a distance of about 1 billion light years. 
 
The earliest sexual reproduction which started 1.2 billion years ago in the Proterozoic Eon doesn’t 
appear have had a big impact on the 5th shell (1.25 billion light years away) to which it corresponds, 
but at least the Sloan Great Wall lies roughly in that distance. The Northern Great Wall and the 
Southern Great Wall lie in distances that correspond to the heights of biological evolution, well 

after the Cambrian explosion. The movement of life in form of invertebrates (spineless animals) 
onto land began during the Silurian Period roughly 420 million years ago. That corresponds to 
the Southern Great Wall (434 mlyr).  
 
By the Carboniferous period (360 myra), early vertebrates (animals with a spine), our four-legged 
ancestors, had in turn left the water and were feeding on the invertebrates. This corresponds to the 
Northern Great Wall (300 mlyr till 500 mlyr).  
For comparison: the dinosaurs lived from 231 myra or 243 myra till 66 myra.  
So we have a periodic concentric shell structure that marks the beginning of multicellular life (6 
or 7 shells), a megastructure that marks the beginning of sexual reproduction and two close-by 
megastructures which mark the first heights of evolution after the Cambrian explosion.  
 
How does Hartnett himself explain these structures? He explains the concentric nature (all galaxies 
move away from us) with a model in which the universe is a white hole. The periodicity in the 
pattern he explains with periodic acceleration and deceleration in the expansion of this white hole. 
That is very troublesome, because then one has to postulate a non-homogeneous acceleration of 
the universe, which just can’t really be found in the data. One could only make adjustments within 
the relatively narrow bandwidth of measurement inaccuracy.  
 
Another issue is that these concentric shells are not perfectly regular in their shape, so that they 
become hard to explain with periodic fluctuations of a homogeneous expansion. Therefore, 
Hartnett has to assume that we are not in the middle of this structure, but about 135 million light 
years away from it! 
A second possibility he considers is that these concentric shells are not a real space effect, and 
caused solely and merely by those fluctuations in the expansion speed. In that case we wouldn’t 
be located in a special position in the universe. However, there doesn’t seem to be any mechanism 
by which one could get such periodic fluctuations in an otherwise smooth accelerated expansion.  
Also with this approach, generally referred to as Carmelian cosmology, it becomes impossible to 
account for the north-south asymmetry which can be found both in the cosmic microwave 
background and the galaxy distribution. Therefore, Hartnett is forced to ignore it or blame it on 
unbalanced surveys in the northern and southern hemisphere respectively (2016; personal 
correspondence).  
This shows in how much trouble one gets when approaching cosmology in a classical non-quantum 
fashion.  
 
What about the cold spots in the CMB, can we explain their exact position?  
Yes, we can: The plane associated with the rotation axis of the earth is called the equinox plane. It 
corresponds to the dipole structure in the CMB.  
The plane associated with the motion of earth around the sun is called the ecliptic plane. It 
corresponds to the quadrupole structure in the CMB.  
It is natural to assume that the measurement frequency is lowest at the poles of a certain rotation 
or orbit axis (very few conscious observers can survive at the poles).  
 

 
Fig. 38. The equinox plane corresponding to the dipole structure, and the ecliptic plane 
corresponding to the quadrupole structure.  
 
 
Fig. 39. The alignment of the CMB with the ecliptic poles and the equinox. 
 
It is also natural that the south ecliptic pole has a larger cold spot with a bigger red shift (lower 
energy).  
Future investigations will show if the galactic orbit axis of the sun can also be linked to a certain 
structure in the CMB, which if so, will most likely be the octupole structure (not depicted here).  
 
Some scientists who try to explain away the CMB anomalies take it for granted that at least the 
dipole can be attributed to a local motion of the Milky Way galaxy relative to the CMB background. 
One can actually derive a speed for this motion using the CMB, which is 369 km/sec.34 However, 
as the Indian physicist Ashok K. Sengal showed, these isotropies and alignments exists for other 
types of radiation as well, and trying to explain them by a motion of the local group leads to totally 
different speeds and directions for the Milky Way galaxy. For the radio sky it leads to a four times 
higher velocity, and for quasars it leads to a speed at 3% of light speed and an opposite direction 
for the motion (!). 35, 36 Thus it could well be that the Milky Way is instead not moving at all.  
 
The likelihood for these CMB alignments to emerge out of mere chance is 1,500 and together with 
the concentric shell structure discovered by Hartnett this leaves only a 6: 300,000,000 chance for 
both phenomena to be ‘coincidences’. Adding in Filipovic’s findings we arrive at  
 

9
25 × 
6
100,000 × 
1
3,500 =  6.171428571 × 10−9 
 
And that is a certainty of 99.99999938%.  
 
So far we have been using quantum mechanics in its orthodox interpretation only, without 
involving much of space particle dualism.  
 
The CMB was released more or less simultaneous all over the universe, so it should be unaffected 
by the particularities of the expansion scheme.  
That is not true for the galaxy distribution we see in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  
As we will learn in chapter 4.12, the expansion scheme of space particle dualism has a huge impact 
on our assessment of distances in the universe.  
 
Intergalactic distances according to space particle dualism 
 
What light year distance do Hartnett’s periodic redshifts (Δ𝑧 =  0.0246) correspond to according 
to space particle dualism? That can be calculated using a scale factor we will derive in chapter 
4.12. The value of this scale factor is:  
 
∆𝑥𝑧=  39,625,004,647 yr 
 
Accordingly, we find that:  
 
𝑧1  =  0.0308 is 1,220,450,143 light years. 
𝑧2  =  0.0554 is 2,195,225,257 light years. 
𝑧3  =  0.0800 is 3,170,000,372 light years. 
𝑧4  =  0.1046 is 4,144,775,486 light years. 
𝑧5  =  0.1292 is 5,119,550,600 light years. 
𝑧6  =  0.1538 is 6,094,325,715 light years. 
 
The distance between these redshifts is 974,775,114 light years – roughly a billion light years. 
This is much more than the 250 million light years spacing that we have in standard cosmology. 
It destroys the correspondence with the time the solar system takes to travel from one corner of 
the dense bulk region to the other.  
 
We could now employ a trick, and try to save our original explanation scheme by saying that we 
didn’t account for the position of the sun relative to the galactic plane. For example, if the sun has 
to be both outside the bulk region and above the galactic plane in order to have maximal 
measurement frequency, then the periodicity of ideal observation would not be 250 million years, 
but 1 billion years.  
 
What is the periodicity of oscillations of the sun over the galactic plane?  
Estimates from the 80’s find a period of 26 to 37 million years.37 Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece 
recently assumed a period of 35 million years when proposing possible correlations with short 
extinction cycles.38 That is the time between each time the sun dives into the galactic disk. Twice 

this time is the time between each time the sun reaches the highest point over the galactic disk. 
Aside spending time in the bulk regions, the sun is located inside one of the various spiral arms 
about 60% of the time. Therefore, within 250 million years, the number of times the sun reaches 
the highest point while being outside the bulk regions is:  
 
𝑓𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘 = 
250
2 (2 ×  35) × 3
5 =  1 
 
This shows that it is not true that maximal exposure is reached only every fourth time the sun is 
outside the bulk regions.  
 
Even if the estimates are wrong, and the oscillations are much slower, we are facing two other 
even more serious problem:  
 
(1) If there is a measurement maximum every 1 billion years, then the expected pattern should 
disappear already after 1 −3  concentric shells, dependent on when we believe that 
consciousness emerged. We could now try and say that maybe only the first three shells are 
statistically significant, but that is not convincing, because when looking at a high-resolution 
map of the galaxy distribution the pattern is clearly visible and recognizable by the naked eye, 
far beyond the third shell.  
(2) If we only care about the exposure on the northern hemisphere, the pattern should appear on 
the northern hemisphere only, and if the effect is strong for both sides, the shells on the northern 
hemisphere and the southern hemisphere would have to be out of alignment.  
 
How can it be that the future observation density principle we employed here works perfectly fine 
for the cosmic microwave background, but not for the distribution of galaxies?  
 
Well, did it explain everything we see in the cosmic microwave background? It certainly explained 
the north south asymmetry and the position of the four cold spots, but it did not explain the small 
density fluctuations.  
Similarly, we do re-discover the north south asymmetry in the distribution of galaxies, and we do 
find cosmic voids approximately in the same directions in the sky as we found cold spots in the 
cosmic microwave background, both of which can be explained by the density of future 
observation, but the density fluctuations in the galaxy distribution seem to lie outside of this 
explanation scheme.  
 
Short range periodicities 
 
Hartnett’s survey was searching for a periodic pattern and if there is any concentric structure within 
the galaxy distribution, then even if the claimed pattern spacing is strong for only two shells, it 
will still yield an impressive sigma value for the whole surveyed redshift collection. 
 
It could be promising to try and find maxima of galaxy distribution density regardless of periodicity. 
If at a certain distance there are more galaxies to be found regardless of the direction in the sky, 
then that is remarkable, even if there is no periodicity. Expecting periodicity on the contrary makes 
us want to continue the pattern as far as possible. 

 
Limiting the survey to smaller radii could reveal more significant periodicities on smaller scales. 
For example, one could limit the surveyed region to 3.5 billion light years, which corresponds to 
the time since which multicellular life exists on earth, and look for periodic minima of galaxy 
population density every 250 million light years.  
Alternatively, one could also be looking for patterns that correlate to the passage through ordinary 
spiral arms, which happens much more frequently.  
 
In any way, if the whole of Hartnett’s pattern is statistically significant, then such correlations can 
explain only parts of what we observe.  
We will soon look at what could explain patterns that extend to infinity, but first we want to explore 
explanations for local maxima in galaxy population density within a limited range of 3.5 billion 
light years.  
 
Something else we should notice here is that Δ𝑧 =  0.0246  is not the only peak redshift 
periodicity that Hartnett found: others are Δ𝑧 =  0.0102, Δ𝑧 =  0.0170, Δ𝑧 =  0.0448.  
 
These all have their own statistical significance and could all correspond to different periodicities 
on earth.  
 
 
Fig. 40. The statistical significance of the various periodicities in the redshift abundance. fig. 
taken from Hartnett (2008) 
 
So, what distances do Hartnett’s various maxima of periodic redshift abundance correspond to 
according to space particle dualism?  
 
Using the above-mentioned equation yields:  
 
Δ𝑧1  =  0.0102 is Δ𝑠1  =  404,175,047 light years 
Δ𝑧2  =  0.0170 is Δ𝑠2  =  673,625,079 light years 
Δ𝑧3  =  0.0246 is Δ𝑠3  =   974,775,114 light years 
Δ𝑧4  =  0.0448 is Δ𝑠4  =  1,775,200,208 light years 
 
Do they correspond to any periodicity on earth?  
A passage through a spiral arm happens about every 142 million years. Entering the dense bulk 
region happens every 250 million years. These are periodic events. The above distances are those 

we obtain when looking for periodicity. 
 
What if we don’t look for periodicity, but for distinct events instead?  
The highest galaxy population density we have at a redshift of 𝑧 =  0.0800, which according to 
SPD corresponds to 3,170,000,372  light years. The first evidence for multicellularity is from 
cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived 3 –  3.5 billion years ago, which would match that redshift 
value.39 However, first direct evidence for brains is from 521 million years ago.40  
 
 
What about baryonic acoustic oscillations? 
 
At this point we should consider that the concentric shells structure is not a genuinely non-
Copernican structure. An alternative explanation that would turn it into a more mundane 
phenomenon is baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO).  
After Hartnett discovered these patterns, other cosmologists analyzed them further and tried to 
come up with an explanation. The most common explanation now is that they represent scaled up 
shock waves from the early universe. 41  
Such shockwaves would originate from places of higher density. According to SPD that are 
primordial black holes, while in the mainstream they are believed to originate from quantum 
fluctuations in the mass density of the early universe.  
 
According to space particle dualism theory irregularities in the matter distribution of the early 
universe can only originate from primordial black holes as well as irregularities in the 
measurements of future observers.  
 
As we will see in chapter 4.16, the major periodicity of Δ𝑧3  =  0.0246 , corresponding to a 
distance of Δ𝑠3  =  974,775,114  light years, can indeed be explained with baryonic acoustic 
oscillations, when using the full age of the universe that we derive there.  
 
In the mainstream there is no hope of finding an explanation for the size of these oscillations, 
because there their size ultimately depends on how much microscopic vacuum fluctuations were 
amplified by the arbitrarily adjustable parameters of inflation.  
 
Accepting baryonic acoustic oscillations as the proper explanation of the concentric shells pattern 
doesn’t mean that abundance of future observation becomes irrelevant when it comes to the 
distribution density of galaxies.  
Both the north south symmetry in the galaxy distribution, as well as large structures like the great 
wall indicate that there is more going on than just acoustic oscillations.  
 
Short range periodicities and oscillations over the galactic plane 
 
The sun is located about 26,490 light years away from the center of our galaxy. The bulk region 
extends only to about 10,000 light years. So, when we talk about the sun diving into the bulk 
region, what we really mean is entering one of the two major spiral arms, which both originate at 
where the bulk region extends the farthest.  
So, at the end, it might turn out that we really have to think more in terms of individual spiral arms, 

and not in terms of simple in-bulk-out-of-bulk model.  
 
Within one spiral arm transit, the solar system doesn’t change its position relative to the galactic 
plane much. We can therefore estimate the chance that it is both outside of a spiral arm and above 
the galactic plane as 1 4
⁄  (above → in → below → in → above).  
 
We know that this works only for spiral arm transits, but for simplifying the analysis, we will 
temporarily assume that it works for near-bulk-transits as well.  
 
When doing so, we get a maximal measurement frequency due to out-of-bulk residence not every 
250 million years, but every 4 × 250 million = 1 billion year.  
So, although the main 1 billion years periodicity can be explained in terms of baryonic acoustic 
oscillations, within a radius of 3.5 billion light years this could be further enforced by the effect 
the abundance of future observation has.   
 
The idea that measurement exposure is maximized when the solar system is above the galactic 
plane doesn’t apply only to when it is located half way from one bulk region to the other, but also 
when it in between two spiral arms.  
Let’s divide the distances between the periodic redshift abundances by 4, in order to accounting 
for the times when the solar system is hidden beneath the galactic plane, and see if they match with 
periodicities we observe in the Milky Way:  
 
Δ𝑠1  4
⁄
=  101,043,761 ly 
Δ𝑠2  4
⁄
 =  168,406,270 ly 
Δ𝑠3  4
⁄
 =  243,693,779 ly 
Δ𝑠4  4
⁄
 =  443,800,052 ly 
 
Δ𝑠1  4
⁄  and Δ𝑠2  4
⁄  are both somewhat close to the 142 million years it takes for the solar system 
to go from one spiral arm to the other and when taking the average between the two, we arrive at 
a value that is really close to this time.  
 
(Δ𝑠1  4
⁄ ) + (Δ𝑠2  4
⁄ )
2
 =  134,725,016 lyr ~ 142,000,000 yr  
 
As one would expect, these two are the weakest periodicities and they are not easily visible. Δs3 
is the redshift periodicities that was highlighted in fig. 30 and it corresponds precisely to the time 
it takes for the solar system to travel from one low-density side of the galaxy to the other and to at 
the same time be located above the galactic plane.  
 
Δ𝑠3  4 =  243,693,779 lyr
⁄
 ≈ 250,000,000 yr 
 
Δs4 is the strongest periodicity and it would be strange if it wasn’t easily visible in fig. 30 and fig. 
31. The reason why fig. 30 & 31 seem to depict a single periodicity and not two is that 
Δs4 ~ 2 × Δs3.  
 
Δ𝑠4  8 =  221,900,026
⁄
 lyr ~ 250,000,000 yr 

 
It is likely that this split into Δ𝑠1 & Δ𝑠2  and Δ𝑠3 & Δ𝑠4  is due to imprecision in the alignment 
between the oscillation over the galactic plane and the time the low-density regions of the galaxy 
are reached; that is lower density between spiral arms in the case of Δ𝑠1 & Δ𝑠2, and low density 
between the two bulk regions in the case of Δ𝑠3 & Δ𝑠4.  
 
At this point it is unclear if the weaker of these periodicities exists even when cutting out the largest 
data sample with a radius of 3.5 billion light years.  
Hartnett was analyzing redshift abundance within a redshift radius of 𝑧 <  0.1784 .  Our own 
radius of interest here is 𝑧 <  0.088. That is roughly 1 2
⁄  of it, yet as we will see in chapter 4.16, 
half of all supermassive black holes discovered within a range of 𝑧 <  10  are actually found 
within redshifts of below 𝑧 =  0.088. This shows that 𝑧 <  0.088 is the most densely observed 
volume in the sky.  
If some of the weaker redshift periodicities, say Δ𝑧1 & Δ𝑧2  yield higher sigma values when 
restricting the survey to 𝑧 <  0.088 , then that is evidence that they do not represent baryonic 
oscillations, but the influence of the abundance of future observation instead.  
 
However, Δ𝑧3 and possibly Δ𝑧4 are certain to be unrestricted in range, and in chapter 4.16 we will 
be exploring how they can be used to prove that the full age of the universe we will be deriving 
there is indeed correct.  
 
Origins of the abundance of future observation principle 
 
So far we have explained the cold spots in the cosmic microwave background only qualitative by 
assuming having a larger abundance of observers for certain directions in the sky leads to the 
wavefunction of the universe collapsing in a way that materializes more stars, galaxies and 
microwave background photons in those directions.  
 
We have not so far touched upon the question of how this principle could be expressed 
mathematically or on if it can be derived from quantum mechanics, or possibly from the similar 
worlds interpretation.  
 
In short, the abundance of future observation principle as we have used it so far is saying that more 
stuff appears where there are more measurements. It would mean that there is a bias in nature 
against zero-measurements.  
This may sound good, but without precise math to quantify it, it is not worth much. 
 
If this principle is to be applied universally, then it should be possible to demonstrate it in a 
laboratory. For example, we could let a photon pass a beam splitter and then enter two boxes 
simultaneously, in superposition. One box shall have many detectors, and the other only one. If 
our principle is correct, then more photons should be detected in the box with the many detectors.  
 
Fewer detectors increase the likelihood that the photon simply gets absorbed by the walls of the 
box, heating it up ever so slightly. That would correspond to a zero-measurement. However, we 
know that even when the experimenter is not in the room, both measurements and zero-
measurements can occur. Therefore, we have to seriously ask ourselves, what reason there can be 

for measurements to be favored over zero-measurements by nature.  
 
Many things come to mind when pondering upon this question. Morphic resonance, which is the 
tendency of patterns to repeat, is one of them. It would favor quantum states which lead to chains 
of events that are more ‘content rich’, and have therefore more resonance with other eons (see 
chapter 4.20). However, it is hard to see how a detector detecting a few more particles can ‘enrich’ 
anything. Also, if this was a natural law, the effect could be much too strong.  
 
If we simply want to compare measurements and zero-measurements, which is absorption by a 
wall or simply not showing up in the detector, without any strong resemblance with our 
cosmological problem at hand, then we can also imagine that we let photons pass a beam splitter 
that has a photon detector only on one side, let’s say it is the reflection side, and those photons that 
pass through the beam splitter are simply getting absorbed by a wall.  
It would be pretty surprising to find that more than 50% of the photons make it to the detector. For 
not having been discovered yet, the effect should be very small, let’s say less than 1%; but if it is 
so small, then it would be very hard to distinguish from ordinary micro-psychokinesis. And if that 
is so, then why don’t we use that as our working hypothesis instead?  
 
Cosmokinesis 
 
Could it be that the abundance of future observation principle in cosmology is simply long-term 
micro-psychokinesis on a cosmological scale?  
Could the CMB-anomalies be really a subtle ‘psi effect’ that has built up over hundreds of millions 
of years. 
 
From half a century of human experiments with random number generators, we know that a 
quantum random event that originally has a 50%  chance of happening, reaches 51%  when 
intention is present.42 When the single bits are replaced by pictures, this chance is in fact higher 
(see chapter 2.3 & 2.4), but we are concerned with single photons that reach us from the sky, and 
that is a situation which is much more similar to random binary bits, and therefore we have to stick 
to the 51% which was found for those.  
50%  correspond to random chance, and so 51%  correspond to 0.5%  deviation from random 
chance.  
 
If we simplify the situation by dividing the earth into two regions, one with observers, and one 
without observers, then we can imagine that every time an observer is moving outside in the night, 
he has a strong intention of seeing things better. In an ideal setting this would lead to photons 
arriving at the observer inhabited part of earth with a 0.5% greater likelihood.  
 
What this means for the cosmic microwave background is that there should be 0.5% more photons 
in the warmer regions than in the cold ones. We can now set out to check if this is the case.  
 
The density of photons in the early universe and in the cosmic microwave background is given by:  
 
𝜌𝛾 = 16 𝜋 𝑘3 𝜁(3) 𝑇3
𝑐3 ℎ3
=  20,286,824.875 × 𝑇3 

 
The precise temperature of the cosmic microwave background is 2.72548 ±  0.00057 K . The 
temperature fluctuations are in the range of ± 0.00003 K. We can now calculate how large the 
difference in photon number density is between cold and hot regions of the cosmic microwave 
background.  
 
The number of photons is 410,703,815 per cubic meter in cold spots and 410,730,940 per cubic 
meter in hot spots.  
 
The ratio between the two equals:  
 
(2.72548 − 0.00003)3
(2.72548 +  0.00003)3 
 
Which means that there are 0.0066% more photons in the hot spots than in the cold spots.  
 
We do not expect observers to wish for more light on daytime, and therefore observer intention 
should only be active at night. This should lead to a decline in the overall effect to about the half, 
because there is sun light about half the time, corresponding to an effect size of 0.25%.  
 
Most prehistoric animals are believed to be diurnal, which means that they were active during the 
day and sleeping during the night. If we take human sleep as an example, we sleep about 8 hours 
of the 12  hours that are dark on average. That leaves about 5  hours that we were spending in 
darkness, before torches or light bulbs were invented. If we were spending all that time outside, 
where the night sky is visible, that would give an expected effect size of 0.04%.  
The discrepancy of this with the 0.0066% found in the CMB is only a factor of 6.  
 
It is pretty clear that not during all of the sleepless time in darkness do we wish for better sight, 
and that probably explains the missing factor of 6.  
On the other hand, there were also night active animals in prehistoric times, but those were, most 
likely, a minority, same as in today’s animal kingdom.  
 
This quick approximate calculation shows that the expected effect size of psychokinesis and the 
actual temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are in the same order of 
magnitude. Arriving in the right order of magnitude is the best we can hope for with 
approximations like this.  
 
Even when remaining skeptical about the above derivation of the expected psi effect size, there is 
one thing our calculation clearly shows, and that is that the temperature fluctuations in the CMB 
are well within the range of what is possible with micro-psychokinesis. If the fluctuations were 
larger, micro-psychokinesis would be ruled out right away.  
 
Fluctuations that are smaller than the effect size of psychokinesis on random number generators 
on the other side are to be expected. Animals are not wandering outside in the dark all the time, 
and even when they do, they might not always wish to spot something. Sometimes they are just 
relaxing. Only when hunting or when investigating danger, is there a need for good sight. That is 

the only time when we can expect this intention to be present.  
 
If we want to arrive at precisely the effect size we observe in the cosmic microwave background, 
then the time of focused intention should be 38 minutes per night.  
 
Conclusion 
 
This is just one example of how much impact the interpretation of quantum mechanics has on the 
analysis of observational data. Contrary to common believe, there are much more ways 
superpositions can be observed than just interference. Large superpositions can lead to large scale 
quantum tunneling around black holes (see chapter 4.3), they enable mind over matter interaction 
in and beyond conscious brains (see chapter 2.1), they help 5-fold symmetry quasi-crystals to grow 
(see end of chapter 2.1), and as we saw in the present chapter, they both allowed the formation of 
DNA and had a huge impact on the overall structure of the observable universe.  
 
In this chapter we saw that life in the universe has to start from one point and end in one point – 
the α (Αλφα) and ω (Ωμεγα) if we want. I think that shows the oneness of all living beings. We 
will come back to that in chapter 4.20 and chapter 5.1, where we will discuss the nature of 
consciousness in detail.

10. The 𝑆 here can stand for both slice and surface. 

11. We shall here not bother to attach complex valued probabilities to the different states in this 
wavefunction. Entangled states with more than two particles become increasingly 
complicated with increasing numbers of particles. The + in between the different states 
indicates that they are entangled. Non-entangled states would be multiplied (which is 
sometimes denoted with the symbol “”, representing a so-called tensor product). However, 
being not entangled is usually just an approximation, since basically all things on earth are 
entangled with each other.

16. This is a simplification: while disproving all non-consciousness-based interpretations of 
quantum mechanics, these non-Copernican structures do not strictly disprove the many minds 
version of decoherence theory. It doesn’t really make a difference if one says that the 
wavefunction collapsed or that one world split into two. What makes a difference is where 
the collapse or the split takes place. Both in the Von Neumann-Wigner interpretation and in 
the many minds decoherence theory it happens when signals are registered in the 
consciousness of an observer. So, the two theories should be equal in their predictions. And 
yet, this is another simplification, because it would mean to pretend that decoherence theory 
is really a self-consistent theory, while we learned in chapter 2.1, that it would make quantum 
probabilities impossible, and that macroscopic interference would be inevitable on long term. 
Also, the arguments in the present chapter are made using clear-cut criteria for what exactly 
is entangled. In standard quantum mechanics these do not exist. There the most common 
view is that everything is entanglement, and that entanglement simply gets lost in the 
complexity of the intercorrelations of particles.  
17. This theory was established in 2013 by M.D. Filipovic, J.Horner, E.J.Crawford, and N.F.H. 
Tothill and is available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4838.pdf. 
18. Of course, there is no clear-cut edge between spiral arms and the area between them, but 
those concentric shells do also not have clear-cut edges.  
19. It is unclear if being in a spiral arm could really notably obscure the sight, but even now we 
can see only a small part of our universe (less than half) because the disk representing our 
milky way is in our sight. We can only see what is above and below. When diving into a 
spiral arm it is plausible that even less would be visible. 
20. It shall also be noted that tragic events like meteoroid impacts do not only diminish the 
number of observers, but they usually also result in a darkening of the sky and have therefore 
a similar obscuring effect as all the gas clouds and local star clusters found in the spiral arms 
of our galaxy.
