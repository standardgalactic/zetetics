QUANTUM FIELD THEORY FOR ECONOMICS
AND FINANCE
An introduction to how the mathematical tools from quantum ﬁeld theory can
be applied to economics and ﬁnance, this book provides a wide range of quan-
tum mathematical techniques for designing ﬁnancial instruments. The ideas of
Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, state spaces, operators and Feynman path integrals are
demonstrated to be the mathematical underpinning of quantum ﬁeld theory and are
employed to formulate a comprehensive mathematical theory of asset pricing as
well as of interest rates, which are validated by empirical evidence. Numerical
algorithms and simulations are applied to the study of asset pricing models as
well as of nonlinear interest rates. A range of economic and ﬁnancial topics is
shown to have quantum mechanical formulations, including options, coupon bonds,
nonlinear interest rates, risky bonds and the microeconomic action functional. This
is an invaluable resource for experts in quantitative ﬁnance and in mathematics who
have no specialist knowledge of quantum ﬁeld theory.

Foreword
I am aware of the author’s work in applying theories of physics to ﬁnance since
2003, and the present book is a logical outcome of the author’s line of thinking.
The presentation of quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) given in this book is based on four
strategic decisions.
(1) From the very outset it introduces the notion of quantum mathematics. This
immediately attracts the attention of readers, with regard two points. First, they real-
ize that in order to feel at home in QFT, they must devote enough time and attention
to mastering these techniques. Second, once they have them well in hand, they can
also use them outside of physics because they are just mathematical techniques.
(2) The book avoids giving applications of QFT to physics as this does not in the
least help to understand QFT as a mathematical discipline.
(3) Throughout the book the formalism of the Feynman path integral is used,
which intuitively is indeed the most appealing formalism of QFT.
(4) Last but not least, the book provides applications of QFT to a variety of
economic and ﬁnancial problems. One must realize that this is indeed quite different
from calculations tied to high energy physics. Why? Needless to say, the whole
machinery of QFT was created for applications to high energy physics; thus, one
just follows the track and there is no need to raise any questions. On the contrary,
QFT was not created to price options. Thus, instead of just following the track, at
each step we have to modify and adapt our understanding of the mathematical tools
of QFT.
The book has three distinctive features that are worth highlighting.
(1) There are many books on QFT, but this is a ground-breaking book that
connects QFT with concepts in economics and ﬁnance.
(2) Almost half the book is devoted to studying models of economics and ﬁnance.
As the book proceeds with different topics of QFT, chapters on economics and
ﬁnance are introduced to show the close mathematical connections between these
domains of knowledge.

Foreword
(3) Many of the applications to economics and ﬁnance are based on models that
can be empirically tested. To me, the most remarkable aspect of the book is that
empirical tests show that these models are surprisingly accurate.
Going through the applications of QFT is a highly rewarding exercise as it tests
our degree of understanding and expands our view of QFT. When readers grasp the
logic of the applications, it will bolster their self-conﬁdence and make them feel at
home with QFT, and empower them to apply the mathematics of QFT to new ﬁelds
of inquiry.

Preface
Quantum ﬁeld theory is undoubtedly one of the most accurate and important scien-
tiﬁc theories in the history of science. Relativistic quantum ﬁelds are the theoretical
backbone of the Standard Model of particles and interactions. Relativistic and non-
relativistic quantum ﬁelds are extensively used in myriad branches of theoretical
physics, from superstring theory, high energy physics and solid state physics to
condensed matter, quantum optics, nuclear physics, astrophysics and so on.
The mathematics that emerges from the formalism of quantum mechanics
and quantum ﬁeld theory is quite distinct from other branches of mathematics
and is termed quantum mathematics. Quantum mathematics is a synthesis of
linear algebra, calculus of inﬁnitely many independent variables, functional
analysis, operator algebras, inﬁnite-dimensional linear vector spaces, the theory
of probability, Lie groups, geometry, topology, functional integration and so on.
One of the mathematical bedrocks of quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld
theory is the Feynman path integral [Baaquie (2014)]. Unlike functional integration
in general, the Feynman path integral is a functional integral with another key
feature, which is that the path integral is constructed out of an underlying (inﬁnite-
dimensional) linear vector space. Operators are deﬁned on this vector space,
including the central operator of theoretical physics, which is the Hamiltonian.
The ﬁrst application of calculus – made by Newton – was in the study of the
dynamics of particles; calculus subsequently has gone on to become the univer-
sal language of quantitative modeling. Similarly, although quantum mathematics
emerges from the study of quantum phenomena that are intrinsically indeterminate,
the mathematical structure is not tied to its origins. Examples discussed below show
that the mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory extends far beyond only quantum
systems and can also be applied to a wide variety of subjects that span natural and
social sciences. It is my view that quantum mathematics will, in time, supersede
calculus and become the universal framework for quantitative modeling and math-
ematical thinking.

Preface
Important applications of quantum mathematics outside quantum physics have
been made in vastly different ﬁelds, resulting in many ground-breaking results.
Quantum mathematics has been applied to many classical problem; two famous
examples are (1) the solution of classical phase transitions by Wilson, which led to
his Nobel prize in physics in 1982 [Wilson (1983)] and (2) the complete classiﬁca-
tion of knots and links in three dimensions by Witten, for which he was awarded the
Fields medal in 1989 [Witten (1989)]. More recently, superstring theory has led to
a plethora of new results in pure mathematics using quantum mathematics. In fact,
it would be no exaggeration to state that superstring theory has opened hitherto
uncharted domains of pure mathematics of higher dimensions [Polchinski (1998);
Zwiebach (2009)].
The formalism of quantum ﬁnance has been developed in this spirit and is based
on the application of quantum mathematics to ﬁnance [Sornette (2003); Baaquie
(2004, 2010)]. Two-dimensional quantum ﬁelds have been applied by Baaquie
(2010) for analyzing interest rates and coupon bonds. Applications to economics
has been made by Baaquie (2013a), and Baaquie and Yu (2018) have utilized a
two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld to describe and model futures asset prices. The
bedrock of the application of quantum mathematics to both ﬁnance and economics
is the employment of the Feynman path integral for modeling the behavior of
interest rates and of spot as well as futures asset prices
The application of ideas from physics to economics and ﬁnance has led to the
creation of a new ﬁeld called econophysics, and to which quantum ﬁnance belongs
[Mantegna and Stanley (1999); Roehner (2002a)]. Applications to psychology
[Baaquie and Martin (2005)], to the social sciences [Haven and Khrennikov
(2013)] and to decision sciences [Busemeyer and Bruza (2012)], to name a few,
show the increasing utility of quantum mathematics in quantitative studies of
social phenomena. Many universities, institutes and centers are teaching courses
on the applications of quantum mathematics, and researchers are ﬁnding new and
unexpected applications of quantum mathematics. For instance, the Institute of
Quantum Social and Cognitive Science “promotes and develops high level research
on the identiﬁcation of quantum structures in non-physical domains, in particular,
in socio-economic and cognitive sciences. The employment of the mathematical
formalism of quantum mechanics outside the microscopic world is a growing
research ﬁeld and it has rapidly attracted the interest of the scientiﬁc community
and the media.”1
Quantum mathematics needs to be made accessible to a wide readership –
beyond science, mathematics and engineering – so that students and researchers
from all ﬁelds of study, including the social sciences, can employ the mathematical

tools of quantum mathematics. Only with the knowledge of quantum mathematics
being widespread can it fulﬁll its potential and, like calculus, become the sine qua
non of all ﬁelds of quantitative modeling.
The mathematics of quantum mechanics has been discussed by Baaquie (2014)
in Path Integrals and Hamiltonians. In contrast to the study of quantum mechanics,
this book is an introduction to the mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory. What
distinguishes quantum ﬁeld theory from quantum mechanics is the coupling of
inﬁnitely many variables, or inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom. The main purpose
of this book is to introduce the mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory to researchers
in ﬁnance and economics. The topics chosen are geared toward imparting the
mathematical tools of quantum ﬁeld theory that can facilitate further studies of
ﬁnance and economics. This book provides a quick and simple primer to quantum
ﬁeld theory and can also be used as an introductory graduate text for readers
from science, mathematics and engineering who are not specializing in theoretical
physics.
A quantum ﬁeld has quantum indeterminacy, whereas a classical stochastic ﬁeld
has classical randomness. The subtle difference between these is the subject of
measurement theory in quantum mechanics [Baaquie (2013b)]. All the applications
of quantum ﬁelds to economics and ﬁnance are in fact the application of stochastic
ﬁelds; however, since the mathematics of stochastic and quantum ﬁelds are identi-
cal, the generic term “quantum ﬁeld” is used for all applications of quantum ﬁelds
to domains outside quantum physics.
How can one introduce quantum mathematics to students, readers and researchers
unfamiliar with quantum ﬁeld theory?
Unlike topics in mathematics, such as calculus, that have a well-deﬁned syllabus,
quantum ﬁelds cannot be so neatly modularized. Given the vast and increasingly
complex mathematics of quantum ﬁelds, it is virtually impossible for one book to
cover the entire terrain of quantum ﬁeld theory.
This book presumes a working knowledge of linear algebra, calculus and prob-
ability theory. All the derivations are done from ﬁrst principles and are compre-
hensive; there is no need to refer to any material outside this book. In order to
introduce quantum ﬁeld theory to readers from “distant” subjects, some of the
leading examples of quantum ﬁelds are studied in detail. Starting from simpler
examples, the various chapters lay the groundwork for analyzing more advanced
topics. These examples encode many of the leading ideas of quantum ﬁeld theory
and are the building blocks of more advanced models.
To make the applications of quantum mathematics to economics and ﬁnance
more tangible, the chapters on economics and ﬁnance are interwoven with chapters
on quantum ﬁelds. In this manner, the reader can directly examine and connect the
ideas of quantum ﬁeld theory with its application, and in particular can see how

xxii
Preface
these ideas are carried over to economics and ﬁnance. About 60% of the material
of the book is directly an exposition of quantum ﬁeld theory, with the remaining
chapters being focused on its various applications to economics and ﬁnance.
The manner of presentation of the two pillars of the book – quantum ﬁelds on
the one hand and economics and ﬁnance on the other– is quite different. Quantum
ﬁeld theory needs no empirical evidence for its utility and validity since the entire
domain of particle physics stands as a testament to its empirical success. Hence the
focus in the chapters on quantum ﬁeld theory is on the various mathematical ideas
and derivations, and only a ﬂeeting connection is made with other subjects. An
integral and pure presentation of quantum ﬁeld theory is necessary to show that it
is free from a bias toward any speciﬁc application. In fact, if one skips the Chapters
on economics and ﬁnance, which are marked by an asterisk, the book then reads as
an introductory graduate text on quantum ﬁeld theory.
Unlike mathematics, which has results of great generality, such as theorems
and lemmas, one only needs to ﬂip through the pages of a textbook on quantum
mechanics or quantum ﬁeld theory to see that there are no theorems in quantum
physics; instead, what one has are leading models and important examples – with
the mathematical analysis ﬂowing naturally in interpreting, explaining and deriving
the “physics” of these models. Quantum ﬁeld theory is illustrated and elaborated
on by analyzing a number of exemplary models, such as the scalar, vector and
spinor ﬁelds. Each of these quantum ﬁelds is described by a speciﬁc Lagrangian
and Hamiltonian – and has distinctive properties on which the book focuses. More
advanced chapters such as the structure of the renormalization group are presented
later, when the reader has a better grasp of the underlying ideas.
The methodology of the chapters on economics and ﬁnance is quite different
from the chapters on quantum ﬁeld theory. In my view, the only justiﬁcation for
the application of quantum mathematics to empirical disciplines outside quantum
physics – including economics and ﬁnance – is that it must be supported by empiri-
cal evidence. In the absence of such evidence – and there are many papers and books
that make conceptual connections between quantum mathematics and classical sys-
tems with little or no empirical evidence [Bagarello (2013)] – the application in my
view is still not complete, and stands only as an interesting mathematical metaphor.
For the metaphor to become a concrete mathematical model, empirical evidence is
indispensable.
For this reason, topics from economics and ﬁnance have been chosen (for inclu-
sion in the book) that have empirical support from market data. Furthermore, a
detailed analysis is given on how these quantum mathematical models are adapted
to the market – and subsequently calibrated and tested. In chapters on economics
and ﬁnance, very speciﬁc and concrete theoretical models are analyzed – all based
on path integrals and Hamiltonians. The introductory chapter on nonlinear interest

Preface
xxiii
rates concentrates on the formalism; the reason is that a quantum ﬁnance model of
nonlinear interest rates, as realized by the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor),
has been calibrated and exhaustively tested using market data; hence, only certain
key features of the formalism are discussed. Two chapters use numerical algorithms
and simulations to study nonlinear interest rates; these chapters illustrate a key
feature of nonlinear interest rates, which is that in most cases numerical techniques
are necessary for obtaining a solution.
The models that have been proposed in economics and ﬁnance – all of which are
based on work done by myself and collaborators – are quite distinct from those that
appear in quantum physics. In particular, all the models in economics and ﬁnance
have an “acceleration” kinetic term – a term forbidden in quantum mechanics (due
to the violation of conservation of probability); it is this term that gives a ﬂavor
to all the results in economics and ﬁnance that is quite different from what one is
familiar with in physics.
The derivations in this book are not tied down to the application of quantum
ﬁelds to physics – as this would require concepts that are not necessary for
understanding the mathematical formalism of quantum ﬁelds. Furthermore, topics
that apparently have no connection with ﬁnance or economics – but have played
a pivotal role in quantum ﬁeld theory – have been included in the hope that these
ideas may lay lead to ground-breaking theories and models in economics and
ﬁnance.
Nonlinearities of quantum ﬁelds arise due to self-interactions or because
of coupling to other ﬁelds – and require the procedure of renormalization for
obtaining ﬁnite results. The canonical case of a self-interacting nonlinear scalar
ﬁeld is studied in great detail so as to illustrate and analyze the issues that arise
in renormalization. The formalism of quantum ﬁeld theory culminates in the
concepts of renormalization, renormalizability and the renormalization group – and
which are among the deepest ideas of quantum ﬁeld theory. It has been shown by
Sornette (2003) that ideas from the renormalization group can provide a mathemat-
ical framework for understanding, and even predicting, market meltdowns.
Many topics, such as fermions, spinors, ghost ﬁelds, bosonic strings and gauge-
ﬁxing, are discussed that may seem to have no connection with economics and
ﬁnance. The reason for including these topics is intentional. The broad range of
topics covered gives a ﬂavor to the reader of the great variety and complexity of
the models that are a part of quantum ﬁeld theory. A major omission has been
the study of Yang–Mills gauge ﬁelds and that of spacetime supersymmetry. These
topics need a background far in advance to what has been assumed, and hence could
not be covered.
It is impossible and unwise to try to second guess what future directions eco-
nomics and ﬁnance will turn toward; furthermore, gearing the topics discussed

xxiv
Preface
toward what is known closes off many future applications. For this reason, the
main thrust of this book is to make the reader aware of, and familiar with, a wide
array of quantum mathematical models so that a researcher can make leading edge
connections and create new pathways between the domains of quantum ﬁelds and
economics and ﬁnance.

Synopsis
The underlying template running through all the chapters of this book is the appli-
cation of the concepts of quantum ﬁeld theory to the description of indeterminate
and random phenomena, be they classical or quantum in origin.
Quantum ﬁeld theory was initially developed to explain the phenomena of high
energy physics and soon spread to condensed matter and solid state physics. The
common thread of these applications was that of a quantum system with a large
number of degrees of freedom (independent variables). The pioneering work of
Wilson (1983) and Witten (1989) showed that quantum ﬁeld theory is not tied to
quantum physics but, instead, has a wide range of applications in many other ﬁelds.
These ground-breaking developments brought to the forefront what can be called
quantum mathematics, mentioned earlier in the Preface.
Quantum mathematics refers to the system of mathematical concepts that arise in
quantum systems – with some of the leading concepts being that of quantum ﬁelds,
vacuum expectation values, Hamiltonians, state spaces, operators, correlation func-
tions, Feynman path integrals and Lagrangians.1 The interpretation of quantum
mathematics, in general, does not have any relation to physics and, instead, needs
to reﬂect the speciﬁcity of the domain of inquiry to which quantum mathematics is
being applied.
Many of the standard books on quantum ﬁeld theory are written primarily for
a readership that is drawn from theoretical physics. There are voluminous and
encyclopedic books on quantum ﬁeld theory – such as the three-volume opus by
Weinberg (2010) which runs for more than 1,500 pages – that are meant for profes-
sional theorists and researchers, being inaccessible to nonspecialists and beginners.
1 There is a clash of terminology regarding the term “Lagrangian.” In economics, the term is used for the
auxiliary function – for which there is no special term in physics – required when using a Lagrange multiplier
for constrained optimization. In physics, the term “Lagrangian” encodes the fundamental model describing a
quantum phenomenon, and has an ontological status equal to that of the Hamiltonian. In this book, physics
terminology is used.

Synopsis
Some books on quantum ﬁelds are geared toward speciﬁc applications, such as the
book by Peskin and Schroeder (1995), which is written for applications in high
energy theory and phenomenology, or the book by Zinn-Justin (1993) that seeks to
explain critical phenomena.
This book eschews the standard approach and provides a quick and concise intro-
duction to quantum ﬁeld theory, meant for an audience from ﬁnance and economics
who has neither the patience nor the motivation for reading any of the specialized
books. This book is focused on providing a direct route, with a minimum use of
formalism, to the leading ideas of quantum ﬁelds – from free ﬁelds to the concept
of renormalization and the renormalization group.
The emphasis of this book is on the underlying mathematics of quantum ﬁeld
theory – which could form the basis of applications of quantum mathematics to
disciplines that go beyond theoretical physics. In particular, this book is an intro-
duction to the mathematical formalism of quantum ﬁelds that one would require for
undertaking modeling in ﬁnance or in the study of economics.
In the Table of Contents, Chapters on economics and ﬁnance are marked by
asterisks for ease of reference. Topics from economics and ﬁnance have been inter-
woven with topics of quantum ﬁeld theory. This interleaving of chapters has the
purpose of clearly demonstrating and illustrating how ideas from quantum ﬁeld
theory carry over to economics and ﬁnance. The unifying theme of all chapters
on economics and ﬁnance is that (1) topics are discussed that can be modeled
using action functionals, Hamiltonians and path integrals and (2) as discussed in
the Preface, topics that can be empirically tested have been included.
The chapters on quantum ﬁeld theory were taught for many years as an
introductory graduate textbook for quantum ﬁeld theory. Problems have not been
included for chapters on quantum ﬁeld theory since there are many books, such as
Radovanovic (2005) and Cheng and Li (2000), that have problems and solutions
for different topics of quantum ﬁeld theory.
1.1 Organization of the book
Figure 1.1 shows the connection of the various chapters of the book, which are
grouped into four parts. A reader can navigate the chapters by concentrating on
only the chapters of interest.
Part I is the introduction to the two underlying themes that underpin quan-
tum ﬁelds, which are the quantum principle and classical ﬁeld theory. The math-
ematical formalism of these two subjects contains the seeds for the mathematics
and applications of quantum ﬁelds. All the chapters in Part I are based on the

in the next three parts.
Chapter 2 introduces the foundations of quantum mechanics; the quantum prin-
ciple leads to quantum indeterminacy and to the quantum theory of probability.
Quantum probability has emerged in recent years as a major new subﬁeld of deci-
sion science and behavioral ﬁnance, and the discussion in this chapter is partly
to introduce the ideas of quantum probability. A brief discussion of path integrals
and Hamiltonians for quantum mechanics prepares the ground for the subsequent
analysis.

Synopsis
In Chapter 3 classical ﬁeld theory is studied to understand the Lagrangian formu-
lation of classical ﬁelds. The Lagrangian and action functional are one of the pillars
of quantum mathematics, and classical ﬁelds are a precursor to quantum ﬁelds.
Global and local symmetries of the theory are encoded in the symmetries of the
Lagrangian. To illustrate the interplay of symmetry breaking and gauge invariance,
symmetry breaking for a nonlinear complex scalar ﬁeld coupled to the Maxwell
ﬁeld is analyzed; it is shown to lead to both the Landau–Ginzburg formulation of
superconductivity and the Higgs mechanism of particle physics. The Lorentz group
is analyzed to understand the structure of empty spacetime, and it is shown how the
Lorentz group classiﬁes the various types of classical relativistic ﬁelds.
Chapter 4 studies the evolution kernel for the quantum mechanical acceleration
action, which is a higher derivative action. This chapter gives a derivation of the
evolution kernel using the state space and Hamiltonian and not a path integral
derivation as given by Baaquie (2014). The acceleration action is a key to the studies
of asset prices as well as of forward interest rates. The reason is that asset prices
are described by the complex branch of the acceleration action, whereas forward
interest rates are described by the real branch. The acceleration action yields a
pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian and, due its higher derivative kinetic term, yields
results quite different from quantum mechanics.
Chapter 5 is on option theory. Central ideas such as the martingale condition
and option prices free from arbitrage opportunities are discussed in the quantum
mechanical framework. The Black–Scholes equation is given a quantum mechani-
cal derivation with no reference to stochastic calculus. The Black–Scholes equation
is generalized to the Baaquie–Yang equation using results from the acceleration
action. Options for equities and foreign exchange are derived and empirically tested
using market data. It is shown that options provide a more accurate gauge of market
instabilities than the volatility of the underlying asset.
In Chapter 6 the formulation of statistical microeconomics is reviewed and a
Lagrangian is postulated for modeling asset prices. It is shown how the application
of Feynman path integrals arises in the study of asset prices. Empirical evidence
is discussed to support the applications of quantum mathematics to the study of
asset prices. A Monte Carlo simulation is done to study the nonlinear aspect of
the Lagrangian, and conﬁrms the validity of perturbatively studying the nonlinear
regime using Feynman diagrams. Multiple commodity prices are analyzed and it is
shown that a Lagrangian for multiple commodities provides an accurate description
of the empirical correlation function of commodity prices.
Part II focuses on linear quantum ﬁelds and is a necessary preparation for the
study of nonlinear quantum ﬁelds. Quantum ﬁelds come in many varieties and with
a great range of underlying degrees of freedom. The simplest, but not unimportant,
case of a quantum ﬁeld is a scalar ﬁeld. The free quantum ﬁeld is studied as a

1.1 Organization of the book
5
precursor to nonlinear quantum ﬁelds. The main difference between a linear and
nonlinear quantum ﬁeld is that the free ﬁeld does not have any interactions.
Linear ﬁelds are important in their own right. The free ﬁeld comes in many
varieties, depending on the nature of the underlying degrees of freedom, with the
most important examples being scalar, photon and Dirac ﬁelds. One way of decou-
pling the free ﬁeld’s degrees of freedom is the method of Fourier transform, which
resolves the free ﬁeld into decoupled momentum degrees of freedom. The three
most widely used and most useful free quantum ﬁelds are the scalar, spinor and
vector quantum ﬁelds. These ﬁelds have many speciﬁc features of great generality
and hence need to studied one by one.
Chapter 7 studies the free scalar quantum ﬁeld, which has no self-interaction
but nevertheless has many features of a quantum ﬁeld and is an ideal theoretical
laboratory for starting one’s study of a system with inﬁnitely many degrees of
freedom. Figure 1.1 shows the central position of the free scalar ﬁeld in developing
the more complex and deeper structures of quantum ﬁeld theory as well as the
application of quantum ﬁeld theory to economics and ﬁnance. A scalar quantum
ﬁeld has one degree of freedom for each spacetime point. The scalar ﬁeld has
all the general features of quantum ﬁelds and its Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are
studied in detail. In particular, the formalism of creation and annihilation operators
is carefully analyzed as these are among the most useful mathematical tools for the
study of quantum ﬁelds. The quantum ﬁeld in two dimensions is the starting point
of this chapter as it is the simplest system quantum ﬁeld for which the Fock space
of states of a quantum ﬁeld is deﬁned.
Chapter 8 studies the free spinor quantum ﬁeld, of which the Dirac ﬁeld is a
leading example. The Dirac ﬁeld is based on fermionic degrees of freedom obey-
ing anticommuting fermion statistics. Spinor ﬁelds provide a representation of the
Lorentz group and are the result of the structure of spacetime. Due to its spinor
nature, the quantization of the free Dirac ﬁeld requires a multicomponent spinor
ﬁeld, having four degrees of freedom at each spacetime point. It is shown how, on
the quantization of the Dirac ﬁeld, two species of particles emerge in its spectrum
of states, which are the particle and its antiparticles. In fact, the primary motive
for studying the Dirac ﬁeld is to understand the emergence, and the properties,
of antiparticles. The relation between the particle and antiparticle states is ana-
lyzed and it shown that the Dirac ﬁeld is invariant under the exchange of particle–
antiparticle. Since the Dirac ﬁeld is a fermionic ﬁeld, the properties of fermionic
variables and the path integral for fermions are brieﬂy reviewed. The Casimir force
is evaluated for the Dirac ﬁeld and leads one to study the boundary conditions for
the Dirac ﬁeld and the associated state space.
Chapter 9 studies the free photon ﬁeld, which is a vector ﬁeld with the local
symmetry of gauge invariance. The symmetry of gauge invariance is so important

6
Synopsis
that the photon ﬁeld is also referred to as an Abelian gauge ﬁeld. To quantize
the photon ﬁeld, one has to choose a gauge. Choosing a gauge is necessary for
quantizing both Abelian and non-Abelian Yan–Mills gauge ﬁelds. The mathematics
required for choosing a gauge is studied in great detail, using both the path inte-
gral formalism, which leads to Faddeev–Popov quantization, and the Hamiltonian
formalism, which leads to the Coulomb gauge. The state space that results for
both the path integral and Hamiltonian quantization are discussed. The Becchi–
Rouet–Stora–Tyutin (BRST) symmetry exhibited by the gauge-ﬁxed action in the
Faddeev–Popov scheme is utilized to deﬁne the state space and is shown to be
equivalent to the Gupta–Bleuler quantization for a covariant gauge.
Chapter 10 analyzes interest rates in ﬁnance. Interest rates are modeled using
a two-dimensional stochastic ﬁeld that is mathematically identical to a two-
dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld. The action, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
for the forward interest rates are modeled using a linear (free) two-dimensional
Euclidean quantum ﬁeld. The Lagrangian is a higher order derivative system, and
empirical evidence is brieﬂy reviewed to support the modeling of interest rates by a
quantum ﬁeld. The state space and ﬁeld Hamiltonian operator are both shown to be
time dependent. The martingale condition is derived for the forward interest rates
using both the path integral and Hamiltonian formulation.
Chapter 11 continues the study of forward interest rates, with the additional
coupling of the risk-free to the risky forward interest rates. It is shown how a spread
over the risky rates – the spread being a quantum ﬁeld in its own right – allows one
to extend the formalism. The risky forward interest rates are empirically studied,
with reasonable support for the model from market data.
Chapter 12 studies a coupon bond with index-linked stochastic coupons. An
asset price, represented by a quantum mechanical degree of freedom, determines
the amount of payment of the stochastic coupons. The discounting of future cash
ﬂows is determined by the zero coupon bonds modeled by the risk-free forward
interest rates, which in turn is modeled by a two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld. The
ﬁnancial instrument is a synthesis of a quantum mechanical degree with a two-
dimensional quantum ﬁeld, and deﬁnes a distinct class of ﬁnancial instruments.
Part III discusses nonlinear quantum ﬁelds. The nonlinear properties of quantum
ﬁelds are, in general, mathematically formidable as well as being fairly intractable –
and for the same reason also yield novel and unexpected results.
In Chapter 13, a general derivation is given of the connection of operators and
state space with the Feynman path integral; in particular, it is shown that all the
time-ordered vacuum expectation values of Heisenberg quantum ﬁeld operators are
given by the correlation functions of the quantum ﬁeld using the Feynman path
integral. The Lehmann–Symanzik–Zimmermann (LSZ) formalism is reviewed to
show how the scattering of quantum ﬁeld states can be reduced to the time-ordered
vacuum expectation values of the quantum ﬁelds, which in turn can be evaluated

1.1 Organization of the book

using the path integral. These derivations show the centrality of the path integral in
the study of quantum ﬁelds.
In Chapter 14, the nonlinear scalar quantum ﬁeld is studied using perturbation
theory to understand the divergences of a quantum ﬁeld. Dimensional regularization
is used as an effective cutoff for the quantum ﬁeld; it is shown that the mass
and coupling constant of the quantum ﬁeld apparently seem to diverge. Feynman
diagrams are introduced as a useful bookkeeping device for the terms that appear
as one goes to higher and higher order perturbation theory.
Chapter 15 is a key chapter that introduces the idea, as well as a prescription, of
renormalization. Four different methods are employed to renormalize the nonlinear
scalar ﬁeld, which are given by bare and renormalized perturbation theory, the
background ﬁeld method and Wilson’s thinning of the degrees of freedom. All four
methods are shown to yield the same result, but from vastly different perspectives.
The deep and global structures of quantum ﬁelds are discussed in Chapters 16
and 17, which address the issues of renormalization and of the renormalization
group. The divergences that appear in perturbation theory and the procedure of
renormalization are seen to be the natural consequence of the fact that the quantum
ﬁeld describes a system with inﬁnitely many length scales. In Chapter 17 one
discovers the rather unexpected connection of quantum ﬁeld theory to the theory
of phase transitions. Recall that quantum ﬁeld theory was speciﬁcally developed
to address high energy phenomenon at short distances, whereas phase transitions
are determined by the behavior of the system for inﬁnitely separated degrees of
freedom.
Another branch of the book leads to the study, in Chapter 18, of effective actions
that describe symmetry breaking for nonlinear scalar ﬁelds and for scalar quantum
electrodynamics. The effective action is evaluated for both cases and it is shown that
scalar electrodynamics has spontaneous symmetry breaking that is renormalization
group invariant.
Nonlinear scalar ﬁelds lead to nonlinear models of interest rates, which is studied
in Chapter 19. This chapter concentrates on certain key aspects of the mathematical
formalism of nonlinear interest rates. The debt market is driven by Libor simple
interest rates. It is shown, due to a nonlinear drift required for fulﬁlling the martin-
gale condition, that Libor is described by a two- dimensional nonlinear Euclidean
quantum ﬁeld. Due to the higher derivative terms in the Lagrangian, there is no need
for renormalizing this nonlinear ﬁeld. Nonlinear drift is exactly obtained using both
the Wilson expansion and the Hamiltonian formulation of the martingale condition.
The empirical aspect of nonlinear interest rates has been studied by Baaquie and
Yang (2009), Yang (2012) and Baaquie et al. (2014b), and hence is not discussed in
this book.
Since perturbation theory is often not effective in studying nonlinear systems,
nonlinear interest rates are studied numerically in Chapters 20 and 21– with the

8
Synopsis
intention of exploring the nonlinear structure of these theories. The technique of
Monte Carlo simulation is used to evaluate the caplet and swaption price. The
interest range accrual swap is studied numerically, and it is shown how to extend the
Libor market model to a domain beyond the Libor lattice, to price this instrument.
Part IV analyzes two-dimensional quantum ﬁelds that are deﬁned on two-
dimensional manifolds. The reason for including these topics is because, so far,
it is two-dimensional quantum ﬁelds that appear in the modeling of ﬁnance and
economics. The examples chosen are important in their own right, which are
quantum electrodynamics in two spacetime dimensions and boson string theory
in an ambient 26-dimensional spacetime. These two-dimensional quantum ﬁelds
provide a glimpse of the rich and diverse variety of quantum ﬁelds that exist
in two dimensions and could be used for modeling problems in ﬁnance and
economics. Chapter 24 applies a nonlinear two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld to
the study of futures asset prices. The ﬁeld theory is free from divergences due
to the higher order derivative in the Lagrangia; this feature makes the theory
accessible to straightforward calculations since otherwise, the entire machinery of
renormalization would have been essential for obtaining ﬁnite results.
Chapter 22 discusses an exact solution of quantum electrodynamics in two space-
time dimensions. The exact solution of the Dirac ﬁeld coupled to the gauge ﬁeld
is reduced to a free ﬁeld. The coupling of a two-dimensional gauge ﬁeld to Dirac
fermions is studied for various nonperturbative phenomena, such as chiral sym-
metry breaking and conﬁnement of fermions, both of which are displayed by the
interacting system.
Chapter 23 is an elementary introduction to bosonic string theory. Bosonic
strings are deﬁned on a two-dimensional manifold and have many features, such
as breaking of conformal invariance, that lead to new insights into the behavior
of two-dimensional quantum ﬁelds. The gauge ﬁxing of the bosonic string leads
to the result that the bosonic string is consistent only in 26 spacetime dimensions.
Furthermore, the technology of Faddeev–Popov is shown to play a fundamental
role in the choosing a gauge for a quantum ﬁeld having conformal symmetry.
Chapter 24 analyzes futures commodity prices by extending the theory of spot
asset prices. Futures commodities prices are modeled by a higher derivative two-
dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld, and empirical evidence in support of this
model is discussed. The two-dimensional nonlinear quantum ﬁeld employed in
studying futures asset prices is a higher derivative Lagrangian.

The principal notion of the entire book is the concept of a quantum ﬁeld. A prelim-
inary understanding of a quantum ﬁeld is brieﬂy discussed.

1.2 What is a quantum ﬁeld?

Relativistic quantum ﬁelds arose from the synthesis of quantum mechanics and
special relativity. To maintain causality, special relativity – when combined with
quantum indeterminacy – requires the existence of antiparticles. The existence of
antiparticles makes nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, which has a ﬁxed number
of particles (degrees of freedom), inconsistent; particle–antiparticle annihilation
and creation from the vacuum needs a state space with an indeﬁnite number of
particles.
State space is a linear vector space, and the number of variables required to
describe the state space is based on the system’s inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom.
Recall a degree of freedom, for each instant of time, is an independent variable. For
example, a nonrelativistic quantum mechanical particle in three space dimensions
has three degrees of freedom. The requirement for an indeﬁnite number of particles
for relativistic ﬁelds ﬁnds its realization in a state space based on inﬁnitely many
degrees of freedom. The fact that Feynman path integral is built out of a state space
with inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom implies that the path integral is deﬁned
on an underlying manifold that is of two or higher dimensions. In contrast, a path
integral deﬁned on a one-dimensional manifold describes a quantum mechanical
system.
Quantum ﬁeld theory is appropriate for describing a relativistic quantum sys-
tem as well as classical random systems with inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of
freedom – such as systems undergoing a classical phase transition.
In summary, a quantum ﬁeld describes a system, either quantum or classical,
with inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom.
The question “what is a quantum ﬁeld?” is revisited in Section 15.14.1. Armed
with Wilson’s formulation of renormalization, a quantum ﬁeld will be seen to be
a system consisting of inﬁnitely many distinct, but coupled, length scales. Each
length scale is described by one of the quantum ﬁeld’s degrees of freedom. The
coupling of different length scales is due to nonlinearities of the quantum ﬁeld.

Quantum mechanics
2.1 Introduction
Quantum mechanics is based on the quantum principle, which is discussed in the
next section. Quantum mechanics is the logical starting point of quantum ﬁeld
theory since ideas such as operators, state space and path integrals can be introduced
in a simpler context, with the inﬁnite-dimensional generalizations being made later
in the analysis of quantum ﬁelds.
In a book addressing applications of quantum ﬁeld theory to economics and
ﬁnance, one may question whether there are, at all, any purely quantum effects.
This question is partly correct in the sense that all applications to economics and
ﬁnance considered in this book are based on the view that stochastic and random
phenomena in economics and ﬁnance are described by classical probability theory;
quantum mathematics is employed solely as a powerful computational tool for
addressing these problems.
However, there has been a major development in social sciences, especially
in decision sciences and behavioral ﬁnance, where quantum probability has been
directly invoked in explaining various observed social phenomenon. Quantum
probability and quantum superposition, which are some of the unique and enigmatic
results that emerge from quantum mechanics [Baaquie (2013b)], have found
myriad applications in the social sciences. Two books, by Busemeyer and Bruza
(2012) and by Haven and Khrennikov (2013), with references cited therein,
provide a comprehensive summary of the varied results, both empirical and
theoretical, that have been obtained in applying quantum mechanics to the social
sciences.
As reasoned above, for both mathematical and conceptual reasons, the study of
quantum ﬁelds needs to start from its roots, namely from quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics
2.2 Quantum principles
One of the starting points of a quantum ﬁeld is the principle of quantum mechanics,
which states that all physical systems are constituted by degrees of freedom that
are fundamentally indeterminate. The indeterminacy is realized in two different
manners [Baaquie (2013b)]:
• In the Hamiltonian formulation all physical observables are Hermitian opera-
tors acting on a state space built on the underlying degree of freedom. Physi-
cally observable quantities are the expectation value of the operators obtained by
either using the state space approach of Schr¨odinger or the operator algebra of
Heisenberg.
• In the path integral formulation, the degrees of freedom are integration vari-
ables and hence have no ﬁxed value and are intrinsically indeterminate. Physical
observables are deﬁned by the matrix elements of operators representing physical
quantities, which in turn can be evaluated using the path integral.
Both the path integral and state space/operator formulations of the quantum
principle are discussed in this chapter. The mathematics of quantum mechanics is
generalized in deﬁning quantum ﬁelds. But what remains valid for quantum ﬁelds
is that they are based on degrees of freedom that are quantum mechanical in nature,
being indeterminate. Moreover, the operator algebra and path integral mathematics
of quantum mechanics continues to be the mathematical backbone of these objects.
Dirac’s notation for linear vector space and operators is used extensively. For
those not familiar with the bracket notation, the connection of vector notation with
Dirac’s bracket notation is brieﬂy discussed in Section 2.10.
The three fundamental principles of quantum mechanics are the following:
• The degree of freedom; this can be discrete or continuous and can be one or
inﬁnitely many. The degree of freedom is denoted by φ; the collection of all its
values forms the space of the degree of freedom F.
• The state space, which in quantum mechanics is a Hilbert space. The state space
can be larger than a Hilbert space for systems that do not conserve probability,
as is the case for economics and ﬁnance. The state space is denoted by V and an
element of V is |ψ⟩∈V, where V : F →V. The dual state space VD consists
of all mappings, denoted by ⟨χ|, of V to the complex numbers C. The expression
⟨χ|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|χ⟩∗∈C is the scalar or inner product.
• Operators O that act on V and map it to itself O : V →V. The space of operators
is denoted by Q ≡V ⊗VD. The tensor or outer product of two state vectors is
given by |ψ⟩⊗⟨χ| ≡|ψ⟩⟨χ| ∈V ⊗VD.
In summary, quantum mechanics consists of the mathematical triple {F, V, Q}.

2.2 Quantum principles
15
The Hermitian conjugation of an operator, denoted by O†
i is deﬁned by
⟨χ|Oi|ψ⟩∗= ⟨ψ|O†
i |χ⟩
All eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real and can represent physically
observed quantities. Hence, physical observations are represented by Hermitian
operators
O†
i = Oi, i = 1, 2, . . . , N : Hermitian
In general, [Oi, Oj] ̸= 0. The physically observed value of a physical quantity Q,
such as position, energy,..., is given by ⟨|Q|⟩, where |⟩represents the quantum
state of the physical entity.
Consider the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator given by
O|ψn⟩= λn|ψn⟩; ⟨ψm|ψn⟩= δm−n
All Hermitian operators have the following spectral decomposition in terms of
their eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
O =

n
λn|ψn⟩⟨ψn|
The collection of all the eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operators yields a complete
set of basis states and yields the completeness equation for V given by
I =

2.3 Theory of measurement
To measure a physical quantity represented by operators Q, a device – ﬁguratively
shown in Figure 2.1 – has to be made that is custom designed to experimentally
realize all the properties of the projection operators n.
Note that the expectation value of n for state vector |χ⟩is given by
Eχ[n] = ⟨χ|n|χ⟩= Pn
Note that
Pn = Eχ[n] = ⟨χ|n|χ⟩= |⟨χ|ψn⟩|2 ≥0
Furthermore
0 ≥Eχ[(n −Pn)2] = Eχ[2

n = Eχ[n] −P2

reading λn indicates that the projection operator n has observed the state, with

2.4 Dirac delta function
17
Hence, the coefﬁcients have the important property that
0 ≤Pn ≤1;

n
Pn = 1
(2.3.3)
Eq. 2.3.3 shows that Pn have the interpretation of the probability of event labeled
by n.
Note that quantum theory of measurement requires that only one of the detectors,
represented by n, detects the quantum state. This is also called the collapse of the
wave function. Deﬁne
Pn = |cn|2 ∈[0, 1]
(2.3.4)
The interpretation in quantum mechanics is that Pn is the probability that the
detector – represented by n – detects the quantum state |χ⟩. Figure 2.1 is a
representation of the measurement process in quantum mechanics.
Eqs. 2.3.4 and 2.3.2 show that quantum mechanics is a quantum theory of prob-
ability that is a synthesis of classical theory of probability with the concept of an
underlying linear vector space V and Hermitian operators acting on it.
Note the fundamental paradox of quantum mechanics, namely that the founda-
tion of the quantum entity, namely the degree of freedom, can never in principle be
observed by any experiment.
Furthermore, two orthogonal projection operators n, m can never simultane-
ously observe the state function ψ. A measurement results in the state function
collapsing to either the state |ψn⟩= n|ψ⟩or |ψm⟩= m|ψ⟩; the state vector
|ψ⟩is never simultaneously observed by both the projection operators. If in any
experiment, two orthogonal projection operators simultaneously observe the state
function ψ, then that would spell the end of the current (Copenhagen) interpretation
of quantum mechanics.
2.4 Dirac delta function
The Dirac delta function is indispensable in the study of continuous spaces (degrees
of freedom), and some of its properties are reviewed. Dirac delta functions are
not ordinary Lebesgue measurable functions since they have support on a mea-
sure zero set; rather, they are generalized functions also called distributions. The
Dirac delta function is the continuum generalization of the discrete Kronecker delta
function.
Consider a continuous line labeled by coordinate x such that −∞≤x ≤+∞,
and let f(x) be an inﬁnitely differentiable function. The Dirac delta function,
denoted by δ(x −a), is deﬁned by

(2.4.5)
⇒

(2.4.6)
where last equation is due to the Dirac delta function being an even function. From
Eq. 2.4.5,

A useful identity for option theory is the following. For a stock price given by
S = ex, consider a payoff function
[ex −K]+ = (ex −K)(ex −K)
Using deﬁnition of the Dirac delta function and Eq. 2.4.8 yields

recall for n, m integers
δn−m =
 0,
n ̸= m
1,
n = m
(2.4.10)
Discretize continuous variable x into a lattice of discrete points x = nϵ, and let
a = mϵ; then f(x) →fn. Discretizing Eq. 2.4.1 gives

Considering x as a degree of freedom yields basis state vector |x⟩and dual basis
state ⟨x|. A function f(x) in Dirac’s notation is given by f(x) = ⟨x|f⟩and the scalar
product of two functions is

and yields the completeness equation

The completeness equation given in Eq. 2.4.12 plays a central role in analyzing
continuous degrees of freedom.

for all differential operators. From Eq. 2.5.1,
|ψt⟩= e−it
¯h H|ψ0⟩
(2.5.4)
The expectation value of a time-independent Schr¨odinger operator O is given by
(¯h = 1)
Eψ[O(t)] = ⟨ψt|O|ψt⟩= ⟨ψ|eitHOe−itH|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|O(t)|ψ⟩= tr(O(t)ρ)
where
ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|
is the density operator, also called, for historical reasons, the density matrix.
The time-dependent Heisenberg operator is deﬁned by
O(t) = eitHOe−itH
⇒i∂O(t)
∂t
= [O(t), 
H] : Heisenberg operator equation
Heisenberg’s formulation is more suitable for measurement theory. A device rep-
resents physical projection operators n; the quantum state is ρ. The result of
repeated measurements yields Pn = tr(nρ).
2.6 Feynman path integral
The Dirac–Feynman formulation of path integrals is derived from the Hamiltonian
operator. Although every Hamiltonian yields a path integral, it is not the case that
every path integral can in turn be expressed in terms of a Hamiltonian. This aspect
of path integrals comes to the fore in studying path integrals for curved manifolds,
but will be not addressed in this book.

2.7 Hamiltonian and path integral
For a continuous degree of freedom the Lagrangian consists of a kinetic term that
is usually the same for a wide class of systems; one needs to choose an appropriate
potential V(x) to fully describe the system. For the sake of rigor, consider the

Quantum mechanics
Path integral quantization is more general than starting from the Schr¨odinger
equation and the Hamiltonian operator for following reasons:
• The Schr¨odinger approach is based on the properties of state space in addition to
the Hamiltonian driving the Schr¨odinger equation.
• The spacetime symmetries of the quantum system are explicit in the Lagrangian-
based path integral approach, whereas in the Schr¨odinger approach these are
implicit and need to be extracted using the properties of the Hamiltonian and
state space. In particular, one has to derive the symmetry operators that commute
with the Hamiltonian.
• Path integral quantization yields a transparent formulation of constrained sys-
tems, as for example discussed in Baaquie (2014). In the Schr¨odinger formu-
lation, one needs both the Hamiltonian and commutation relations, which for a
constrained system are far from obvious and require a fair amount of derivations.
These considerations come to the forefront in the quantization of complicated sys-
tems like non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds. The starting point is the Lagrangian, and path
integral quantization turns out to be more efﬁcient than the Schr¨odinger approach.
2.8 Hamiltonian from Lagrangian
Recall in Section 2.6, the Lagrangian was derived from the Hamiltonian using the
Dirac–Feynman formula. In this section, it is shown how to derive the Hamiltonian
H if the Lagrangian is known; one can use the procedure of classical mechanics for
the derivation, but instead a quantum mechanical deviation is given in this section.
Option theory, discussed in Chapter 5, is based on classical random processes
that is similar to the diffusion equation. Hence, for classical random processes the
time parameter t in the path integral appears as “Euclidean time” t, which for option
theory is in fact calendar time. A Lagrangian that is more general than the one
discussed in Section 2.6 and that arises in the study of spot interest rate model in
ﬁnance is the Black–Karasinski model [Baaquie (2004)].
Let the degree of freedom be the real variable φ; in the Black–Karasinski model,
the spot interest rate is given by r = r0eφ. Consider the following Lagrangian and
action

Note the path integral integration measure

Dφ has a factor of e−νφ needed to
obtain a well-deﬁned Hamiltonian.
Recall from the discussion of the evolution kernel in Section 2.6, the path integral
is related to the Hamiltonian H by Eq. 2.6.9, namely
K(φi, φf; T) =

Dφe−νφeS = ⟨φf|e−τH|φi ⟩
(2.8.3)
One needs to extract the Hamiltonian H from the path integral on the left-hand side
of Eq. 2.8.3.
The Hamiltonian propagates the system through inﬁnitesimal time; the time
index t is discretized into a lattice with spacing ϵ, where t = nϵ with N = T/ϵ
and φ(x) →φn. The path integral reduces to a ﬁnite (N −1)-fold multiple integral,
analogous to what was obtained in Eq. 2.6.6. Discretizing the time derivative

Note that unlike Eq. 2.6.9, for which the Hamiltonian is known and the
Lagrangian was derived from it, in Eq. 2.8.5 one needs to derive the Hamiltonian
from the known Lagrangian. This derivation is the quantum mechanical analog of
the derivation of H given by Hamiltonian mechanics in classical mechanics and
discussed by Baaquie (2014).
The key feature of the Lagrangian that in general allows one to derive its
Hamiltonian is that the Lagrangian contains only ﬁrst-order time derivatives; hence,
discretization of the Lagrangian involves only φn that are nearest neighbors in time,
thus allowing it to be represented as the matrix element of e−ϵH, as in Eq. 2.8.5.
In contrast, for Lagrangians that contain second-order or higher order time
derivatives, discussed by Baaquie (2014), the derivation of the Hamiltonian from
the Lagrangian and path integral is nontrivial since the entire framework of
coordinate and canonical momentum is no longer applicable. Instead, one has
to employ the Dirac method required for quantizing constrained systems and,
in particular, evaluate the Dirac brackets for the system in order to obtain the
Hamiltonian and commutation relations.
In Eq. 2.8.5, the time derivative appears in a quadratic form; hence one can use
Gaussian integration to rewrite Eq. 2.8.5 in the following manner1

The Hamiltonian H = H(φ, ∂/∂φ) is a differential operator and acts on the dual

The Hamiltonian is quite general since both V(φ) and α(φ) can be functions of the
degree of freedom φ. Note that the Hamiltonian H in general is non-Hermitian –
and is Hermitian only for ν = 0 and a pure imaginary α. The path integral has a
nontrivial integration measure exp{−νφ} that arises from the underlying state space
and needs to be speciﬁed in addition to the Hamiltonian.
2.9 Summary
The principles of quantum mechanics are realized by indeterminate degrees of
freedom. An entity in quantum mechanics is described by degrees of freedom
that, due to quantum indeterminacy, simultaneously take all possible values. This is
realized by the operator formalism and by the Feynman path integral.
Both the operator formalism and the Dirac–Feynman path integral formalism
were brieﬂy reviewed as these form the basis for the generalizations that are
required for the description of quantum ﬁelds. The path integral was derived
starting from the Hamiltonian and in turn the Hamiltonian was obtained starting
from path integral quantization.
The interplay of the path integral with the underlying state space and Hamilto-
nian is one of the foundations and a unique feature of quantum mathematics that
distinguishes the Feynman path integral from functional integration in general.
2 As in Eq. 2.5.3, the convention for scalar product is ⟨p|φn ⟩= exp(−ipφn), and the sign of the exponential in
Eq. 2.8.7 reﬂects this choice. The deﬁnition of H requires it to act on the dual state vector ⟨φ|; if one chooses
to write the Hamiltonian as acting on the state vector |φ⟩, H† would then have obtained instead. Since H is not
Hermitian, this would lead to an incorrect result.

2.10 Appendix: Dirac bracket and vector notation
Linear algebra is based on the idea of the N-dimensional Euclidean space EN –
which is a ﬁnite-dimensional linear vector space. Vectors are elements of EN and
matrices are linear transformations from EN to EM. The synthesis of linear algebra
with calculus, which is the basis of functional analysis, is most easily carried out
by expressing vectors and matrices in Dirac’s notation. The discussion is conﬁned
to square matrices, which are linear transformations from EN to EN, although the
notation can also be applied to the general case.
The basic ingredient of the Dirac bracket notation is the following
ket : |..⟩= vector;
bra : ⟨..| = dual vector
Taken together they form the complete bracket
bracket : ⟨..|..⟩= scalar product = complex number
Consider, for generality, a complex valued vector v, which is represented by the
ket-vector
v = |v⟩; vi = |vi⟩
There is no need to make the symbol v boldface inside the ket since the notation
makes this clear. The dual bra-vector is given by
v† = ⟨v|
The canonical basis and its dual vectors are given by
ei = |i⟩; e†
i = ⟨i|
Linear superposition is written as expected
u = av + bw ⇒|u⟩= a|v⟩+ b|w⟩
with the dual expression given by
u† = a∗v† + b∗w† ⇒⟨u| = a∗⟨v| + b∗⟨w|
The expansion of a vector into its components is
v =

In Dirac’s notation, the scalar product is given by
v† · w = (⟨v|)(|w⟩) = ⟨v||w⟩= ⟨v|w⟩

Furthermore
w† · v = (v† · w)∗= ⟨v|w⟩∗⇒w† · v = ⟨v|w⟩∗= ⟨w|v⟩
For the orthonormal basis states

sions is because the measure is invariant under translations, that is, under x(t) →
x(t)+ξ(t); one can easily verify that this symmetry of the measure yields the result
obtained in Eq. 2.11.5.

Classical ﬁeld theory
3.1 Introduction
The concept of the classical ﬁeld is introduced in this chapter. The forms that Nature
takes in physics are a variety of ﬁelds, including the Standard Model of high energy
physics as well as the geometrical theory of gravitation. The key feature of a ﬁeld
– in fact, its most important and deﬁning property – is that the ﬁeld carries both
energy and momentum at every point of space (and time). This is the reason that
a ﬁeld is considered to be a physical entity – as physical as a classical particle –
with the difference that the ﬁeld’s energy and momentum can ﬂow from one part to
another, unlike a particle for which its energy and momentum are at the point that it
occupies (of course, this point can move). Just as is the case for particles, the time
evolution of a ﬁeld exactly conserves the ﬁeld’s total energy and momentum.
As the ﬁeld evolves in time, the energy and momentum of the ﬁeld can be redis-
tributed from one point of space to another by the variation in the ﬁeld’s strength.
The term “a propagating ﬁeld” is shorthand for describing the redistribution of the
ﬁeld’s energy and momentum at the different points of space; this redistribution can
take place in many ways, with the most commonly studied case being the wave-
like oscillations of the ﬁeld’s strength at different points of space. A propagating
electromagnetic ﬁeld can, in principle, propagate out to inﬁnite distances. And,
conversely, a propagating electromagnetic ﬁeld impinging on a charged particle
can transfer energy to it and cause the particle to accelerate.
The total energy and momentum of the ﬁeld coupled to charged particles, taken
together, is exactly conserved at every point of spacetime.
In general, a classical ﬁeld is a determinate entity, which is completely speciﬁed
by assigning a numerical value to the ﬁeld (with appropriate dimensions) at every
point in spacetime. The values specifying the ﬁeld at every point can change as the
ﬁeld evolves in time. A particle of classical physics occupies a single point, whereas
a (scalar or a vector) ﬁeld is spread over space. The numerical value of a ﬁeld can be
a single number, as in the case of a scalar ﬁeld, or it can consist of several numbers,
35

36
Classical ﬁeld theory
as in the case of a spinor or a vector ﬁeld. The gravitational ﬁeld is a tensor ﬁeld
requiring 10 real numbers at every spacetime point.
The two pillars of contemporary physics are Einstein’s theory of gravitation
and the Standard Model of particle physics. Both of these pillars are based on the
concept of the ﬁeld, with gravity being a nonlinear classical ﬁeld and the Standard
Model being described by quantum ﬁelds. The classical ﬁeld is a determinate func-
tion of spacetime, having a unique and determinate (numerical) value for every
point of spacetime. In contrast, quantum ﬁelds are indeterminate and “have” all
possible values at every point of spacetime.
The ﬁeld exists at all points of space with the energy and momentum of the ﬁeld
being spread all over space. The strength (numerical value) of a classical ﬁeld at
the different points of spacetime is a measure of the energy and momentum at that
point.
The description of a classical ﬁeld using Lagrangian mechanics is discussed,
including the symmetries of the Lagrangian and the conserved quantities that arise
from such symmetries. A few classical ﬁelds, which include the effective ﬁeld
theory that describes superconductivity as well as the classical theory that describes
the Higgs mechanism, are discussed to illustrate some of the classical ﬁeld’s key
features.
3.2 Lagrangian mechanics
The mechanics of a classical point particle, speciﬁed by position x(t), is deter-
mined by md2x/dt2 = F. For conservative system with force given by a potential
F = −∂V/∂x, the classical trajectory xc(t) obeys Newton’s laws:

3.5 Symmetries

3.5 Symmetries
The symmetries of a system are those transformations of the ﬁeld ϕ and of the
coordinates x = (t, ⃗x) that leave the ﬁeld equations of the theory unchanged. The
symmetry is realized by the transformation leaving invariant the Lagrangian (up to
a divergence) and hence the action S.
A symmetry transformation by deﬁnition leaves the action functional invariant.
By considering an inﬁnitesimal symmetry transformation, the invariance of the
action yields a volume term that is zero due to the ﬁeld equations as well as a
boundary term that is also zero. The boundary term contains the generators of the
symmetry transformations that yield a conserved current. Noether’s theorem shows
how to extract the conserved currents that result from the symmetry of the action.
Consider a general symmetry transformation that has the form
x →˜x = ˜x(x); ϕ(x) →˜ϕ(˜x)
(3.5.1)
The transformation leaves the Lagrangian invariant (up to a divergence), and hence,
for any arbitrary volume V, we have
S =

d4 ˜xL( ˜ϕ(˜x), ˜∂˜ϕ(˜x), ˜x) =

d4xL(ϕ, ∂ϕ, x)
The coordinate transformation yields
˜xμ = xμ + δxμ; d4 ˜x = Jdx
where the Jacobian J is given by
∂˜xμ
∂xν = δμ
ν + ∂ν(δxμ) ⇒J = det
∂˜xμ
∂xν

= 1 + ∂μ(δxμ)
Expanding the action to lowest order in the coordinate yields
S =

d4 ˜xL( ˜ϕ(˜x), ˜∂˜ϕ(˜x)) =

d4xJ{L( ˜ϕ(x), ∂˜ϕ(x)) + ∂μLδxμ}
Using the expression for the Jacobian J yields
S =

d4x{L( ˜ϕ(x), ∂˜ϕ(x)) + ∂μLδxμ + L∂μ(δxμ)}
=

d4x{L( ˜ϕ(x), ∂˜ϕ(x)) + ∂μ(Lδxμ)}
(3.5.2)
Deﬁne the variation of the ﬁeld at the same spacetime point x by
δϕ(x) = ˜ϕ(x) −ϕ(x)
(3.5.3)
Since the transformation is a symmetry, it leaves the action invariant and yields
δS = 0 =

42
Classical ﬁeld theory
Note the fact that δS = 0 in Eq. 3.5.4 is a consequence of the symmetry of the
Lagrangian under the symmetry transformation in question. This is quite different
from the derivation in Section 3.3 of the ﬁeld equations, where one imposes the
condition of δS = 0, with this condition constraining the classical ﬁeld to obey
the classical ﬁeld equation. It is no coincidence that the symmetry transformation
and ﬁeld equation both end up with δS = 0, since it can be shown that the ﬁeld
equations in fact already contain the symmetries of the Lagrangian [Peskin and
Schroeder (1995)]. For an inﬁnitesimal transformation, using Eqs. 3.3.5 and 3.5.4,
δS =

2 Under a symmetry transformation, the equations of motion are left invariant as long as

⇒δL = ∂μJ μ
The current J μ given above does not change the equations of motion because, using Gauss’s theorem, it
integrates to zero in the action. It, however, does contribute to the boundary term δS∂V. We will ignore the
extra current J μ as it is not required for subsequent discussions.

3.6 Noether’s theorem
43
We analyze special cases of Eq. 3.5.6 to understand the signiﬁcance of Noether’s
theorem.
3.6 Noether’s theorem
For internal symmetries, ˜x = x and only the degrees of freedom are transformed.


= 0 : conserved invariant
and we obtain the Noether current
jμ = δϕ
∂L
∂(∂μϕ)
(3.6.1)
The conserved current jμ given in Eq. 3.6.1 is a classical result. On quantizing
a classical ﬁeld, some of the classically conserved currents may no longer be con-
served; in particular, for a classical ﬁeld having the symmetry of scale invariance
and chiral invariance, on quantization of the classical ﬁeld, the symmetry is broken.
If the ﬁeld has many components, denoted by ϕa, the conserved current is
given by
jμ =

a
δϕa
∂L
∂(∂μϕa)
(3.6.2)
The derivation of the Noether current is based on the ﬁeld equation and is essentially
equivalent to the ﬁeld equation; in other words, the Noether currents can be obtained
directly by studying the ﬁeld equations. Studying the boundary term is in practice
a more efﬁcient and transparent procedure for identifying the conserved currents.
The Dirac ﬁeld is deﬁned in Chapter 8 in terms of multicomponent anticom-
muting ﬁeld variables ¯ψa, ψa. For a Dirac ﬁeld the Noether conserved current is
given by
jμ =

the anticommuting nature of the Dirac ﬁeld.

Note that the stress tensor in Eq. 3.7.2 is only deﬁned up to a total divergence. An
equivalent and modiﬁed stress tensor that is conserved can be deﬁned as follows:
˜Tμν = Tμν + ∂λ(Kλμν); Kλμν = −Kμλν
⇒∂μ( ˜Tμν) = 0
(3.7.4)
In some cases, such as electrodynamics, the stress tensor has to be modiﬁed to make
it symmetric, as required by angular momentum conservation.

and hence

Lagrangian given by
LG = ∂μϕ∗∂μϕ −μ2ϕ∗ϕ −λ[ϕ∗ϕ]2; λ > 0
(3.8.1)
The parameter μ2 in the Lagrangian yields a well-deﬁned and convergent quan-
tum ﬁeld theory for both positive and negative values.

ϕ(x) =

√

[ϕ1(x) + iϕ2(x)]; ϕ∗(x) =

2
[ϕ1(x) −iϕ2(x)]

Consider the global U(1) symmetry transformation
ϕ(x) →ϕ′(x) = e−iαϕ(x); ϕ∗(x) →ϕ′∗(x) = eiαϕ∗(x)
The phase α is constant and hence the transformation is a global one.
The Lagrangian is invariant and hence
L(x) →L′(x) = L(x)
The complex ﬁeld can be represented using polar coordinate as follows:

T > Tc

3.9 Landau–Ginzburg Lagrangian

Choosing υ to be at the minimum of the potential yields
υ2 = r2
0 = −μ2
λ
Since the ﬁeld is being expanded about the minimum of the potential, the choice
for υ2 eliminates the ﬁrst term in the potential – which has both the linear term in
σ and the quadratic π2 term. The mass of the π ﬁeld is zero because the π2 term is
zero and this is due to the excitations of the ﬁeld along the valley of the potential,
which are massless; the massive ﬁeld σ results from excitations away from the
valley.
The ﬁeld π is massless and is called the “Goldstone boson” ﬁeld. It is a result of
the phase transition having long-range correlation functions.
Replacing μ2 by −λυ2 in the Lagrangian, we obtain
LG = 1
2∂μσ∂μσ −1
2(2λυ2)σ 2 : massive scalar
+ 1
2∂μπ∂μπ : massless scalar
−λυσ(σ 2 + π2) −λ
4[σ 2 + π2]2 : interaction
+ 1
4λυ4 + 1
2υ2μ2 : constant
(3.8.4)
Expanding the ﬁeld about the nonzero minimum breaks the global symmetry of
ϕ →eiαϕ, which exists in the original Lagrangian, and the vacuum state of the
corresponding quantum ﬁeld theory is said to have spontaneously broken the global
U(1) symmetry.
The reason the symmetry is broken is because the ﬁeld variables are now σ, π.
The transformation σ ± iπ →e±iα(σ ± iπ) no longer leaves the potential term V
invariant. This is because υ2 > 0 is a physically observable quantity and it cannot
depend on the gauge and hence cannot be changed by a gauge transformation.
Hence, for υ2 > 0, the Lagrangian L is no longer U(1) invariant. The sponta-
neous symmetry breaking has given rise to the massless Goldstone boson ﬁeld π.
3.9 Landau–Ginzburg Lagrangian
Scalar electrodynamics consists of a complex scalar ﬁeld coupled to an Abelian
gauge ﬁeld. The Landau–Ginzburg Lagrangian provides a phenomenological
description of the superconducting phase of ordinary conductors using scalar
quantum electrodynamics. The complex scalar ﬁeld ϕ is an order parameter that
describes the phase transition. The development of the microscopic Bardeen–
Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory showed that, in the condensed superconducting

50
Classical ﬁeld theory
phase, the complex ﬁeld’s “mass term” – given by ϕ∗ϕ – represents the density of
superconducting Cooper pairs of electrons.
A local (gauge) transformation is one for which the parameter α = α(x) depends
on the spacetime point x. Consider the U(1) local gauge transformation given by
ϕ(x) →ϕ′(x) = e−iα(x)ϕ(x); ϕ∗(x) →ϕ′∗(x) = eiα(x)ϕ∗(x)
which yields
∂μϕ(x) →∂μϕ′(x) = e−iα(x)∂μϕ −i(∂μα)ϕ
Under a U(1) local gauge symmetry, from Eq. 3.8.1 we have
LG →L′
G = LG + ∂μα∂μαϕ∗ϕ + i∂μαϕ∗∂μϕ
−μ2ϕ∗ϕ −i∂μα(∂μϕ∗)ϕ −μ2ϕ∗ϕ ̸= LG
Hence the Goldstone Lagrangian LG does not have local gauge symmetry.
A gauge ﬁeld is introduced to obtain exact local gauge symmetry. Consider the
Landau–Ginzburg Lagrangian

where the gauge covariant derivative and gauge ﬁeld tensor are given by

Note that
|Dμϕ|2 ∼|∂μϕ|2 + ϕ∗A∂μϕ + (Aϕ)2
Local gauge transformations are deﬁned by
ϕ(x) →ϕ′(x) = e−ief(x)ϕ(x)
ϕ∗(x) →ϕ′∗(x) = eief(x)ϕ∗(x)
Aμ(x) →A′
μ(x) = Aμ(x) + ∂μf(x)
Hence

Furthermore, for the gauge ﬁeld
Fμν →∂μ(Aν + ∂νf) −∂ν(Aμ + ∂μf)
= ∂μAν + ∂μ∂νf −∂νAμ −∂ν∂μf = Fμν
So we conclude that L has U(1) local gauge symmetry.
The conserved Noether current for symmetric Lagrangian (υ = 0) is given by
the global gauge symmetry transformation and from Eq. 3.6.1
jμ =
∂L
∂(∂μϕ1)δϕ1 +
∂L
∂(∂μϕ2)δϕ2 +
∂L
∂(∂μA)δAμ
Recall, for α =constant,
ϕ′ = e−iαϕ; ϕ′∗= eiαϕ∗
⇒
δϕ = −iαϕ; δϕ∗= iαϕ∗
and
δAμ = ∂μα = 0
Hence, in terms of the complex scalar ﬁelds
jμ =
∂L
∂(∂μϕ)δϕ +
∂L
∂(∂μϕ∗)δϕ∗+
∂L
∂(∂μA)δAμ = −(D∗μϕ∗)iαϕ + Dμϕ(iαϕ∗)
The overall scale of the current is ﬁxed by the units used, and for α = 1,
jμ = i(ϕD∗μϕ∗−ϕ∗Dμϕ)
(3.9.1)
More explicitly,
jμ = i(ϕ∂μϕ∗−ϕ∗∂μϕ −2ieAμϕ∗ϕ) = i(ϕ∂μϕ∗−ϕ∗∂μϕ) + 2eϕ∗ϕAμ
The condition that ∂μjμ = 0 is a result of Noether’s theorem that jμ is a conserved
current.
The ﬁeld equations are obtained by considering ϕ and ϕ∗to be independent
ﬁelds; one can obtain the same result by writing the complex ﬁeld in terms of two
real ﬁelds. The ﬁeld equations, for λ = 0, are the following:
ϕ : 0 = ∂L

Classical ﬁeld theory
Note that the last equation above states that
∂νFμν = jμ
Since Fμν is antisymmetric, one has the identity ∂μ∂νFμν = 0, and hence consis-
tency requires that
∂μjμ = 0
(3.9.4)
In other words, the gauge ﬁeld Aμ can only be coupled to a conserved current,
reﬂecting the conservation of electric charge. Eq. 3.9.4 shows that the Noether
conserved current, as mentioned earlier, is in fact already contained in the ﬁeld
equations.
3.9.1 Meissner effect
The Meissner effect refers to the phenomenon where a superconductor expels mag-
netic ﬁelds, up to a critical value of the ﬁeld.
A superconductor is in thermodynamic equilibrium with no time dependence;
hence all the time derivatives in Landau–Ginzburg Lagrangian are set to zero.
The conserved current, from Eq. 3.9.1, is given by
jμ = i(ϕ∂μϕ∗−ϕ∗∂μϕ) + 2eϕ∗ϕAμ
For the symmetry-breaking superconductor phase, since the Landau–Ginzburg
has the same potential as the Goldstone Lagrangian, the leading order of the ﬁeld
is given from Eq. 3.8.3 by
|ϕ0| =
1
√
2
υ
and we obtain
ϕ∗ϕ ≃|ϕ0|2 = 1
2υ2
Since the ﬂuctuation of the ﬁeld is small over space, we have that ϕ∂μϕ∗−ϕ∗∂μϕ
is negligible. Hence, for a symmetry-breaking superconductor phase we obtain, to
leading order, the value for the current, which is given by
jμ ≃eυ2Aμ : London equation
The ﬁeld equation Eq. 3.9.3 now yields
∂νFμν = ∂ν(∂μAν −∂νAμ) = eυ2Aμ
(3.9.5)
Note that
∂μ∂νFμν = 0 ⇒∂μAμ = 0
This is a gauge condition on Aμ.

Figure 3.3 The magnetic ﬁeld penetrates only up to a length of g inside a
superconductor. The condensed phase is perturbed up to a skin depth of ξ.
Hence, from Eq. 3.9.5
∂ν∂νAμ + eυ2Aμ = 0 : Massive Klein Gordon equation
The gauge ﬁeld has become massive since the phase transition of the scalar ﬁeld
leads to the breaking of gauge symmetry. We will see in Section 3.10 that this is the
same as the Higgs mechanism.
Consider a superconductor occupying the half plane, with its surface at x = 0.
The magnetic ﬁeld is given by ⃗B = ⃗∇× ⃗A. Imposing a constant magnetic ﬁeld
of strength ⃗B0 in the z-direction, the London equation yields the magnetic ﬁeld as
given by
(−∂2
x + eυ2) ⃗B = 0 ⇒
⃗B = e−x/g ⃗B0; g = 1/(eυ2) : Meissner effect
As shown in Figure 3.3, the magnetic ﬁeld penetrates into the superconductor only
to a depth of g, called the penetration depth; for a low temperature superconductor,
g ≃10−9 m.
The scalar ﬁeld ϕ is the analog of the σ ﬁeld. For the condensed phase, the mass
of the scalar ﬁeld, similar to the σ ﬁeld as given in Eq. 3.8.4, has a mass of 2λυ2;
hence the ﬁeld equation for the ﬁeld ϕ in the condensed phase – the analog of
Eq. 3.9.2 – yields
(+∂2
x −2λυ2)|ϕ| + O(ϕAμ) = 0
Using the boundary condition that for ϕ in the condensed phase, we have

the ﬁeld equation yields
|ϕ(x)| =

υ(1 −e−x/ξ); ξ = 1/(2λυ2)

Classical ﬁeld theory
Hence, the condensed phase is broken near the boundary of the superconductor, and
the length is given by ξ = 1/(2λυ2). The behavior of the gauge and scalar ﬁeld for
the condensed phase is shown in Figure 3.3.
In particle physics, for spontaneously broken gauge theories, the mass of the
gauge ﬁeld Aμ is equal to the inverse of the penetration depth g and the mass of the
Higgs boson is equal to the inverse of the correlation length ξ.
3.10 Higgs mechanism
The interplay between local gauge invariance and spontaneous breaking of symme-
try is the basis of the Higgs mechanism. A direct way of seeing this interplay is
to choose the so-called unitary gauge. Consider polar coordinates for the complex
scalar ﬁeld given by
ϕ(x) =
1
√
2
r(x)eiθ(x)
Choose a speciﬁc unitary gauge that is determined by the θ ﬁeld and given by3
Aμ →Aμ −∂μθ
The gauge-covariant derivative term then yields
Dμϕ →
1
√
2

∂μ + ie(Aμ(x) −∂μθ(x))

r(x)eiθ(x)
=
1
√
2

∂μr(x) + ieAμ(x)r(x)

In other words, the gauge transformation completely removes one degree of
freedom and makes the complex ﬁeld ϕ(x) into a real ﬁeld r(x). The choice of
gauge produces no change in Fμν and hence we obtain
L(r, Aμ) = 1
2|∂μr(x) + ieAμ(x)r(x)|2 −1
2μ2r2(x) −1
4λr4(x) −1
4FμνFμν
For the spontaneously broken phase, μ2 = −λυ2, with υ ̸= 0. Let
r(x) = υ + σ(x)
3 The unitary gauge is a singular limit of the so-called Rξ gauge; it can be shown [Peskin and Schroeder (1995),
Eq. 21.29] that in the unitary gauge, the gauge ﬁeld Aμ is massless for the case of μ2 > 0. The Rξ gauge is
deﬁned by the gauge-ﬁxing term

The massless Goldstone ﬁeld π in Eq. 3.8.4 has been removed using the gauge sym-
metry of the Lagrangian. Instead of the Goldstone ﬁeld, one now has the gauge ﬁeld
acquiring a mass equal to e2υ2; the extra degree of freedom for the massive gauge
ﬁeld mass arises by the gauge ﬁeld absorbing the Goldstone degree of freedom.
On quantizing the ﬁelds, symmetry breaking is the result of the properties of the
quantum vacuum |⟩of the system. The broken phase is characterized by
⟨|Aμ|⟩= 0; ⟨|ϕ∗ϕ|⟩= υ
In the path integral formalism, this condition yields
E[Aμ] = 0; E[ϕ∗ϕ] = υ
where E[O] is the expectation value of the ﬁeld variables O.
The symmetry breaking by the Higgs scalar ﬁeld ϕH(x) is given by
v = E[ϕH(x)] = ⟨| ˆϕH(x)|⟩= 246 GeV/c2
The nonzero value of v is the basis for all the fundamental particles in nature having
a nonzero mass [Baaquie and Willeboordse (2015)].
In summary, the Higgs transition and mechanism describe the following
phenomenon.
• Before the phase transition, the system has local gauge invariance and consists
of a complex scalar plus massless gauge boson. The number of the degrees of
freedom before the phase transition is 4 = 2 + 2.
• After the system undergoes a phase transition, the condensed phase breaks local
gauge invariance and consists of a real scalar and a massive gauge boson. After
the phase transition, the number of degrees of freedom is also 4 = 1 + 3.

56
Classical ﬁeld theory
The process of a massless gauge ﬁeld acquiring a mass through a phase transition
is called the Higgs mechanism. The magic of gauge invariance and symmetry
breaking combine to give a new result. In the absence of the gauge ﬁeld, a phase
transition leads to the appearance of the massless Goldstone boson, but when cou-
pled to the gauge ﬁeld, the Goldstone boson is completely removed from the theory,
and, instead, the gauge ﬁeld becomes massive and the complex massive charged
scalar ﬁeld becomes a massive real scalar ﬁeld with zero charge.
3.11 Lorentz group
In the previous sections, both scalar and vector ﬁelds have been discussed, and in
Section 3.7 on the Noether current, the stress tensor was analyzed. Scalar, vector
and tensor ﬁelds are classiﬁed according to their transformation under the Lorentz
group, which is a non-compact Lie group that encodes the symmetries of relativistic
spacetime. Another ﬁeld of fundamental importance is the spinor ﬁeld, of which the
Dirac ﬁeld is the leading exemplar.
The scalar, vector and spinor ﬁelds form the backbone of the study of quantum
ﬁelds. Since all these ﬁelds are characterized by their properties under Lorentz
transformations, the main features of the Lorentz group are summarized. It is further
shown how the various ﬁelds are classiﬁed using the Lorentz group.
Consider a spacetime point t, ⃗x; the relativistic invariant distance of this point
from the origin using the metric given in Noteworthy 3.1 and setting c = 1, is given
by
t2 −⃗x2 = xμxμ = ημνxμxμ
The Lorentz group in four spacetime dimensions is given by all the transformations
Lμν (in matrix notation) that preserve the invariant distance.
˜xν = Lμνηναxα
⇒x = Lηx
Using η = ηT and η2 = I yields the condition that determines Lμν:
˜xη˜x = xη(LTηL)ηx = xηx ⇒LTηL = η
(3.11.1)
L is a real four-dimensional matrix; Lorentz transformations consist of rotations
in three-dimensional space, which require three (compact) parameters, and boosts
in three space directions, which require another three (noncompact) parameters.
The parameter space of the Lorentz group is a six-dimensional space; the parameter
space is not compact, since the boosts take values over an inﬁnite range. Hence, the
Lorentz group is a noncompact group [Tung (2003)].
The six parameters of the Lorentz group can be organized into a three-
dimensional complex vector – consisting of three complex parameters as its
components – and is given by

3.11 Lorentz group
57
⃗α = ⃗θ + i ⃗ρ
The parameters ⃗θ and ⃗ρ are elements of the following spaces:
⃗θ ∈S3;
⃗ρ ∈ℜ3
⇒(⃗θ, ⃗ρ) ∈S3 × ℜ3
The three-dimensional sphere S3 is the compact parameter space of SU(2), whereas
⃗ρ is noncompact, taking values over the inﬁnite three-dimensional Euclidean
space ℜ3.
The Lorentz group is SO(1, 3); its Lie algebra is given by su(2) × su(2). Hence,
the Lorentz group elements, in general, are given by [Tung (2003)]
M = exp{i⃗α · ⃗A} exp{i⃗α∗· ⃗B}
(3.11.2)
with the commutation equations of the generators Ai, Bi being given by
[Ai, Aj] = iϵijkAk; [Bi, Bj] = iϵijkBk; [Ai, Bj] = 0
The commutation equations are of two independent su(2) Lie algebras.
The matrix L given in Eq. 3.11.1 is a speciﬁc representation of the Lorentz
group. In general, a representation of the Lorentz group M is determined by the
representation chosen for the underlying generators Ai, Bi; they both form an su(2)
Lie algebra, which is labeled by multiples of half integer j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . ., with
dimensionality of 2j + 1.
A general irreducible representation of the Lorentz group SO(1, 3) is given by a
choice of (j1, j2) for the generators, and yields
Ai = Ti(j1) ⊗Ij2; Bi = Ij1 ⊗Ti(j2); [Ti(j), Tj(j)] = iϵijkTk(j)
where Ij1, Ij2 are unit matrices of dimension j1, j2, respectively. Hence, from
Eq. 3.11.2, the Lorentz transformation is given by
M(j1,j2)(⃗α) = exp{i⃗α · ⃗T(j1)} ⊗exp{i⃗α∗· ⃗T(j2)}
Unlike compact Lie groups, the representation M(j1,j2)(⃗α) is not unitary because
the parameters ⃗α are complex.4 M(j1,j2)(⃗α) is a (2j1+1)(2j2+1)×(2j1+1)(2j2+1)-
dimensional complex valued non-unitary matrix; M(j1,j2)(⃗α) represents the Lorentz
group by its action on an underlying linear vector space of dimension
(2j1 + 1)(2j2 + 1).
For example, the j1 = 1
2 = j2 generators are given by the Pauli matrices
Ai = σi ⊗I; Bi = I ⊗σi; I = diag(1, 1)
These generators yield a (1 + 1)(1 + 1) = four-dimensional representation of the
Lorentz group, which is given by
4 All unitary representations of noncompact groups are inﬁnite dimensional.

3.12 Relativistic ﬁelds
All ﬁelds in high energy particle physics are relativistic ﬁelds; in other words, the
ﬁelds are well deﬁned under transformations of the special theory of relativity.
Furthermore, all the Lagrangians are chosen to be relativistically invariant as is
required for describing physical phenomena that are relativistically invariant. In
particular, all the physically measurable predictions of quantum ﬁeld theory are
relativistically invariant.
Consider a spacetime quantum ﬁeld ϕa(x), which is an n-component multiplet,
labeled by the index a = 1, . . . , n; the n × n representation of the Lorentz group
determines the transformation of this multiplet. The general transformation rule for
any multiplet, under a Lorentz transformation determined by ⃗α, in matrix notation,
is given by
ϕ(x) →ϕ′(x′) = M(j1,j2)(⃗α)ϕ(x); x′ = Lx
(3.12.1)
If one considers the ﬁelds to be Heisenberg operators on Hilbert space, then the
Lorentz transformations are realized by inﬁnite-dimensional unitary transforma-
tions U(⃗α) that act on the operator and yield the following:
ϕ(x) →ϕ′(x′) = U†(⃗α)ϕ(x)U(⃗α) = M(j1,j2)(⃗α)ϕ(x); x′ = Lx
3.12.1 Scalar and vector ﬁelds
Scalar ﬁelds transform according to the representation given by j1 = 0 = j2, for
which A = 0 = B, and yields
M(0,0) = 1
Hence from Eq. 3.12.1, a scalar ﬁeld ϕ has the following transformation:
ϕ′(x′) = ϕ(x)
The transformation of a scalar ﬁeld is shown in Figure 3.4. The value of the trans-
formed ﬁeld at the transformed point is equal to the original ﬁeld at the original
point.
One of the most important functions of the ﬁelds is the Lagrangian density L(x).
If the Lagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar, then the action and all the correlation

functions are relativistically invariant. Under a Lorentz transformation, a scalar
Lagrangian density yields
L′(x′) = L(x); d4x′ = det L d4x = d4x
Hence the action is relativistically invariant since
S′ =

The transformation of a vector ﬁeld is shown in Figure 3.4. The transformed vector
ﬁeld at the transformed point is rotated in relation to the original ﬁeld at the original
ﬁeld at the original point. Note the additional feature for the vector ﬁeld. Since it
transforms as the tensor product of two representations of the Lorentz group, it is
reducible. In particular, using the properties of su(2) Lie algebra, we have

three space dimensions. The result given in Eq. 3.12.2 shows that a four-component
Lorentz vector ﬁeld carries a spin-one and spin-zero representation of the Lorentz
group. Under rotations in three space dimensions, the time component of the vector
ﬁeld A0 does not change, and hence we identify it as being the spin-zero component
of the Lorentz four vector.
The only vector ﬁelds that are renormalizable are gauge ﬁelds. For these ﬁelds,
the scalar particle is removed by choosing the temporal gauge of A0 = 0. The spin-
one gauge particle has only two components of the three possible states of spin-one
representation due to the gauge invariance of the state space. From the point of
view of the Lorentz group, one can now see these features in the derivation of the
Hamiltoninan and gauge-invariant state space in Sections 9.2 and 9.3.
3.12.2 Spinor ﬁelds5
Parity, realized by operator P, is deﬁned by the inversion of only the space dimen-
sions, with the time direction being left unchanged, and is given by
P(t, ⃗x) →(t, −⃗x)
The Dirac ﬁeld, studied in detail in Chapter 8, is a four-component spinor ﬁeld.
It can be shown [Das (2008)] that the parity operator P that realizes the effect of
space inversion for the Dirac ﬁeld is given by
ψ(t, −⃗x) = Pψ(t, ⃗x) = ηψ(t, ⃗x); |η| = 1 ⇒P = γ0
where γ0 is a Dirac gamma matrix deﬁned in Eq. 3.12.5. Under the parity transfor-
mation, the representations j1, j2 are interchanged and one has
PM(j1,j2)(⃗α)P = γ0M(j1,j2)(⃗α)γ0 = M(j2,j1)(⃗α)
Hence, for obtaining a system that is invariant under the parity transformation, one
has to use the representation given by M(j,j)(⃗α) and with the spinors having the
dimension (2j+1)2. The Dirac ﬁeld, which is invariant under parity transformations,
transforms under the M( 1
2 , 1
2 )(⃗α) representation of the Lorentz group.
The chiral representations of the Lorentz group are given by M(j,0)(⃗α), with
the chiral ﬁeld being (2j + 1)-dimensional. Spacetime spinor ﬁelds that violate
the symmetry of parity, such as the massless neutrino, are two-dimensional and
transform under the M( 1
2 ,0)(⃗α) representation of the Lorentz group.
The four-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group is given by

S yields a reducible representation, since each component of the tensor product acts
independently on the underlying vector space. Hence, in block diagonal represen-
tation using the 2 × 2 block notation, S is given by
S =
( exp{i⃗α · ⃗σ}
0
0
exp{i⃗α∗· ⃗σ}
)
The Dirac spinor ﬁeld, in 2 × 2 block notation, is given by
ψ =
( ψu
ψd
)
Under a Lorentz transformation – ignoring the transformation of the spacetime
points as these do not enter the discussion – the Dirac spinor transforms, as per
Eq. 3.12.1, as follows:
ψ′ = Sψ =
( exp{i⃗α · ⃗σ}
0

exp{i⃗α∗· ⃗σ}

shown that γ0 is given by [Tung (2003)]6
γ0 =

)
⇒S†γ0S = γ0
(3.12.5)
where the last result follows from Eqs. 3.12.3 and 3.12.4.
The Dirac Lagrangian given in Eq. 8.3.1 is relativistically invariant, and a sketch
of the proof is the following. Consider the mass term given by
¯ψψ = ψ†γ0ψ = [ψ†
u ψ†
d]
( 0

) ( ψu

Hence, from Eq. 3.12.5, Lorentz transformation of the mass term yields
¯ψψ →¯ψ′ψ′ = ψ†S†γ0Sψ = ¯ψψ : invariant
Using an explicit representation of the gamma matrices γμ that follows from the
representation of the Lorentz group that we are using, it can be shown that [Tung
(2003)]
S†γμS = L ν
μ γν
6 There are inﬁnitely many equivalent representations of the Dirac matrices and the one chosen here for γ0 is not
the same as that given in Eq. 8.2.3, which is more convenient for analyzing the Hamiltonian of the Dirac ﬁeld.

Classical ﬁeld theory
from which it follows that
¯ψ′γμψ′ = L ν
μ ¯ψγνψ
Hence, ¯ψγνψ transforms as the L(⃗α) vector representation of the Lorentz group –
and hence is a Lorentz four vector; this is sufﬁcient to show that the Dirac
Lagrangian is a scalar and the Dirac action is Lorentz invariant.
It can be shown that the massless Dirac equation splits into two separate equa-
tions, one for ψu and the other for ψd; the two-component chiral spinors are called
Weyl spinors and transform under the M( 1
2 ,0)(⃗α) representation of the Lorentz
group [Tung (2003)]. The massless equation obeyed by the Weyl spinors can be
shown to be Lorentz invariant. The massless neutrino in particle physics is taken to
be a Weyl spinor and provides the mechanism for parity violation in nature.
Tensor products of the representations of the Lorentz group M(j1,j2)(⃗α) give rise
to tensor ﬁelds and spinor ﬁelds with higher spins.
The quantum ﬁelds that appear in phase transitions and mathematical ﬁnance are
not relativistic quantum ﬁelds. In particular, the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson action,
which describes phase transitions and is discussed in Section 17.7, is deﬁned
in d = 3 space dimensions and has no well-deﬁned properties under Lorentz
transformations.
3.13 Summary
The notion of classical ﬁeld sets the stage for the concept of the quantum ﬁeld. Both
quantum and stochastic ﬁelds are rooted in the formalism of classical ﬁelds, with
the idea of Lagrangian, action and Hamiltonian running through all the derivations.
Conservation laws and symmetries are features of all quantum ﬁelds, and these
are initially introduced in the context of classical ﬁeld theory. Classical concepts of
symmetry carry over to quantum ﬁelds. Conserved currents and charges are key fea-
tures of quantum ﬁelds, especially in deﬁning the state space of the quantum ﬁeld.
Important ideas such as symmetry breaking occur in classical physics, and
the Meisner effect and Higgs mechanism were discussed to introduce nonlinear
Lagrangians that later will be seen to be the starting point of the analysis of various
quantum ﬁelds.
A brief and condensed discussion of the Lorentz group was given to let readers
have a glimpse of the vast application of Lie groups to quantum ﬁelds. The Lorentz
group provides a classiﬁcation of spacetime quantum ﬁelds determined by how
they transform under Lorentz transformations. The scalar, spinor and vector ﬁelds
are deﬁned by their transformation properties. The more general topic of applying
Lie groups to determine the dynamics of quantum ﬁelds was not discussed, but is
something that the readers should be aware of.

Acceleration action
4.1 Action and Hamiltonian
The acceleration Hamiltonian has wide application in many subjects [Baaquie
(2014) and references cited therein] and in particular will play an important role in
later discussions on option theory, commodities and interest rates. In fact, in all the
applications of models based on quantum mathematics to economics and ﬁnance,
the acceleration Hamiltonian and Lagrangian always seem to be required.
Fundamentally, it is the acceleration term in the action – absent in physics – that
seems to be essential in describing the dynamics of phenomena in economics and
ﬁnance, and this also makes behavior of the models of the social phenomena of
economics and ﬁnance vastly different from natural phenomena that are studied in
physics.
The acceleration Hamiltonian depends on both position x and velocity
v = −dx/dt, and is given by [Baaquie (2014)]

of two decoupled harmonic oscillators H0; the similarity transformation is given by
the operator Q [Baaquie (2014)]:

The expression for the classical action given in Eq. 4.2.18 is real valued for all three
branches, and as mentioned earlier, Sc < 0 for all three branches.
Although the Hamiltonian derivation of the transition amplitude is only valid for
the real branch, one can analytically continue the results given for Mij to the critical
and complex branch as well. The path integral derivation, given in Section 4.4, is
valid for all three branches and validates the result found by analytic continuation
of the real branch.
4.2.1 Limiting case: ω1 = ω = ω2: real
The critical branch has ω1 = ω2; it has been shown in Bender and Mannheim
(2008) and Baaquie (2014) that the critical Hamiltonian is given by a direct sum of
Jordan blocks. The Lagrangian, from Eq. 4.1.6, is given by

It is an intractable problem to obtain the result given in Eq. 4.2.20 from the
Jordan block-diagonal Hamiltonian. In contrast, the path integral derivation yields
Eq. 4.2.17 for all three branches; hence Eq. 4.2.20 provides the transition amplitude
for the critical branch by a straightforward limit of the real (or complex) branch –
showing the power of the path integral.
4.2.2 Limiting case: ω = 0
One can further take the limit of ω →0. From Eq. 4.2.19, the Lagrangian is
given by

The result above is the generalization of the Black–Scholes pricing kernel given in
Eq. 5.7.6.
4.3 Limiting case: τ = 0
The transition amplitude is given by
K = ⟨xf, vf|e−τH|xi, vi⟩
In the limit of τ →0, it must yield the following Dirac delta-function inner product:
lim
τ→0 K = ⟨xf, vf|xi, vi⟩= δ(xi −xf)δ(vi −vf)
(4.3.1)
The proof of the normalization given in Eq. 4.3.1 is not straightforward because the
xi, vi (and xf, vf) variables have cross-terms and hence the limit of τ →0 for the
two variables has to be taken simultaneously.

70
Acceleration action
The proof of the normalization given in Eq. 4.3.1 can be shown indirectly in the
following manner. Note that in general, for ˜f(ζ) being the Fourier transform of f(z),
f(z) =

dxδ(x −z)f(x) =

dζ
(
dxδ(x −z)eixζ

(4.3.2)
Let a representation of the delta function be given by !(x, z) such that
lim
τ→0 !(x, z) = δ(x −z)
Then from Eq. 4.3.2 it is sufﬁcient to show that

dx lim
τ→0 !(x, z)eixζ = eizζ
and the general result follows from the properties of the Fourier transform. For the
transition amplitude, it can be shown by a long and tedious calculation that
lim


dxfdvfK(xf, vf; xi, vi; τ)eizxf +iwvf = eizxi+iwvi
(4.3.3)
which in turn yields the required limit given in Eq. 4.3.1.

4.4 Transition amplitude: Path integral derivation
The path integral formulation is reviewed and some equations are repeated for ease
of reading. The transition amplitude can be equal to the pricing kernel, as in the
case of Black–Scholes given in Eq. 5.4.3. Or the transition amplitude can be used
for obtaining the pricing kernel as given in Eq. 5.9.3, which is the case of the
acceleration Hamiltonian.

4.4 Transition amplitude: Path integral derivation
71
The path integral is an efﬁcient tool for evaluating the evolution kernel, and
the derivation given below complements – and in fact is more general than – the
Hamiltonian derivation of the evolution kernel given in Section 4.2.
The description of the stochastic evolution of a classical random system is
deﬁned by the Hamiltonian H operator for the system [Baaquie (2004)]. As given
in Eq. 4.2.1, the evolution kernel is the matrix element of the Hamiltonian operator
K(x, v; x′, v′; τ) = ⟨x, v|e−τH|x′, v′⟩
The evolution kernel K(x, v; x′, v′; τ) has another representation. As discussed
in Section 2.6.9, it is deﬁned by the (Euclidean) Feynman path integral over all
possible paths x(t) of a security from its initial value x′, ˙x′ at time τ = 0 to its ﬁnal
value of x, ˙x at time τ. More precisely,
K(x, v; x′, v′; τ) =

The boundary conditions for all the allowed paths in the Feynman path integral
given in Eq. 4.4.1 is the following:
x(0) = x′, ˙x(0) = −v′; x(τ) = x, ˙x(τ) = −v

Since the Lagrangian given in Eq. 4.4.3 is quadratic, the path integral can be
solved exactly using the classical solutions. The stochastic variable x is separated
into two parts: the classical solution xc and stochastic part ξ:
x = xc + ξ
(4.4.4)
3 The parametrization chosen for H is more suitable for studying the path integral.

Acceleration action
with the classical solution xc given by
δS[xc]
δx(t) = 0
The classical solution has boundary conditions as Eq. 12.5.3 and we hence obtain
xc(0) = x′, ˙xc(0) = −v′; xc(τ) = x, ˙xc(τ) = −v
(4.4.5)
Hence, Eqs. 4.4.4 and 4.4.5 yield the boundary condition as
˙ξ(0) = 0; ˙ξ(τ) = 0; ξ(0) = 0; ξ(τ) = 0
(4.4.6)
The acceleration action S separates into two parts and is given by
S = S[xc] + S[ξ]
(4.4.7)
Note S[ξ] is independent of x, v, x′, v′ and depends only on τ. The pricing kernel is
given by
K(x, v; x′, v′; τ) =

The Hamiltonian is well deﬁned for the real branch, and the evaluation of the
evolution kernel given in Eq. 4.2.18, rigorously speaking, is valid only for the real
branch. To complement the Hamiltonian derivation of the evolution kernel, the path
integral is solved for the complex branch. For the complex branch, the classical
solution xc(t) satisﬁes the equation

xc(t) satisﬁes the equation
a....x c(t) −2b¨xc(t) + cxc(t) = 0

According to the market data, the solution for the index is in the complex branch of
Eq. 4.4.12; hence
b2 −ac < 0

Deﬁne y as the four conjugate roots of the equation

Then the relationship from (a, b, c) to (r, ζ) is as
b = +a(r2 −ζ 2); c = a(r2 + ζ 2)2
(4.4.17)
Using the notation of r and ζ, the general solution of xc(t) is given by
xc(t) = ert(a1 sin ζt + a2 cos ζt) + e−rt(a3 sin ζt + a4 cos ζt)
(4.4.18)
where a1, . . . , a4 are constants ﬁxed by the boundary conditions and hence depend
on x, v, x′, v′.

Acceleration action
4.5 Summary
The acceleration Lagrangian is an important exemplar in its own right and has a
vast range of applications. In fact, in Baaquie (2014) three chapters are devoted
to studying the intricacies and complexities of this seemingly simple model. The
crux of all the new properties of the model comes from the acceleration term; for
example, this term leads to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and hence is ruled out as
an allowed quantum mechanical system.
The importance of the Lagrangian, and of the path integral formulation, is that it
is valid for all three branches, whereas the Hamiltonian works well only for the real
branch. For the critical and complex branches, the Hamiltonian has to be carefully
continued and requires a number of new ideas; in particular, for the critical branch,
the Hamiltonian maps into the direct sum of inﬁnitely many Jordan blocks [Baaquie
(2014)].
The acceleration action is a key model for all applications of quantum mathe-
matics to economics and ﬁnance. There are no issues with the Hamiltonian being
non-Hermitian since the interpretation is not based on probability theory. The
results given in this chapter are valid for all three branches of the theory and this
plays a crucial role in applying the acceleration action to asset pricing, option
pricing and interest rate models.
It is worth noting that the kinetic term in physics, given by m(dx/dt)2 for a degree
of freedom x, does not change from model to model; what changes is the nature of
the degree of freedom as well as the potential term. The kinetic term for all the
applications of quantum mathematics that are discussed in this book is given by
L(dx2/dt2)2 + *L(dx/dt)2. This kinetic term makes the applications in economics
and ﬁnance distinct from quantum physics, and yields results that are refreshingly
different from what one obtains in quantum physics.

Option theory*
5.1 Introduction
It is shown how quantum mechanics provides a natural framework for understand-
ing the theory of option pricing. One of the four famous papers that Einstein (1905)
wrote was “On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid
Demanded by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat”. This phenomenon, called
Brownian motion, is explained by the theory of random walk, also called a stochas-
tic process. Interestingly enough, the ﬁrst formalization of random walk was not in
Einstein’s paper, but instead in the study of ﬁnance.
The famous mathematician Henri Poincare assigned one of his graduate students,
Louis Bachelier (1900) to study the evolution of a ﬁnancial security, such as a stock
of a company or a bond issued by a government. To price any ﬁnancial instrument
one needs to model the evolution of a stock, and Bachelier assumed that the stock
price evolves randomly following a normal distribution. This is very close to the
modern approach pioneered by Black and Scholes (1973); except in the modern
approach it is the logarithm of the stock price, and not the stock price itself, that is
assumed to be normally distributed.
Ideas from theoretical physics have found increasing applications in ﬁnance
[Bouchaud and Potters (2003); Mantegna and Stanley (1999); Baaquie (2004,
2010)]. The discussion in this chapter is largely based on Baaquie (2008), with
the focus on deriving the main results of option theory using the mathematics of
quantum mechanics.
5.2 Options on a security
Financial derivatives, or derivatives for short, are important forms of ﬁnancial
instruments that are traded in the ﬁnancial markets. As its name implies, derivatives
are derived from other underlying ﬁnancial instruments: the cash ﬂows of a
77

78
Option theory
derivative depend on the price of the underlying instruments [Hull (2000); Jarrow
and Turnbull (2000)].
Given the uncertainties of the ﬁnancial market, there is a strong demand for
predicting the future behavior of securities. Derivative instruments are a response
to this need and contain information for estimating the behavior of a security in the
future. There are three general categories of derivatives, namely forwards, futures
and options.
Derivatives have many uses, from hedging a portfolio in order to reduce risk to
the use of derivatives as a tool for speculation. Most of the options are traded in the
derivatives market, which is a growing and highly diversiﬁed market.
Options are derivatives that can written on any security, including other deriva-
tive instruments. An investor may be more interested in the proﬁt that can be made
by entering into an option’s contract, rather than actually possessing the asset on
which the option is written, as is the case for a futures or forward contract.
An option C is a contract to buy or sell (called a call or a put) that is entered
into by a buyer and seller. For example, for a European call option the seller of the
option is obliged to provide the holder of the option the stock of a company S at
some predetermined price K and at some ﬁxed time in the future. The buyer of the
option, on the other hand, has the right, but not an obligation, to exercise the option.
If the price of the stock on maturity is less than K, then clearly the buyer of a call
option should not exercise the option since the buyer can buy the security at a lower
price from the market. If, however, the price of the stock is greater than K, then the
buyer makes a proﬁt by exercising the call option. Conversely, the holder of a put
option has the option to sell the security at a predetermined price to the seller of the
put option.
In summary, an option in general is a contract with a ﬁxed maturity, and in which
the buyer has the right to – but is not obliged to – either buy from or sell a security
to the seller of the option at some predetermined (but not necessarily ﬁxed) strike
price. The precise form of the strike price is called the payoff function of the option.
There is a great variety of options, and these can be broadly classed into path-
independent and path-dependent options.
Path-independent options are deﬁned by a payoff function that only depends on
the value of the underlying security at the time of maturity – the payoff function is
independent of how the security arrived at its ﬁnal price.
5.3 European call and put option
The most widely used path-independent options are the European call and put
options. Consider an underlying security S. Let the European call option on S(t)

be denoted by C(t) = C(t, S(t)), and gives the owner the option to buy the security
at some future time T > t for the strike price of K.
At time t = T, when the option matures the value of the call option C(t, S(t)) is
clearly given by
C(T, S(T)) ≡g(S) =
 S(T) −K,
S(T) > K
0,
S(T) < K
(5.3.1)
where g(S) is the payoff function, also written as g ≡(S −K)+. Figure 5.1(a) is a
call option.
A European put option, denoted by Put = Put(t, S(t)), gives the holder the option
to sell a security S at a price of K. Clearly, if the price of the security at time T is
larger than the strike price K, the holder of the option will not sell the security to the
seller of the option since a better price can be obtained by selling it in the market.
Hence
Put(T, S(T)) ≡h(S) =
 K −S(T),
K > S(T)
0,
K < S(T)
where h(S) is the payoff function of the put option. Figure 5.1(b) is the payoff of a
put option.
The concept of arbitrage is fundamental in ﬁnance, and entails the following:
there can be no risk-free return on any asset higher than what the (money) market
has to offer. Usually the risk-free return that the money market offers is the instan-
taneous return on a ﬁxed deposit in a bank, given by the spot interest rate r(t).
For spot interest rate given by r, taken to be a constant, an argument based on
the absence of arbitrage opportunities shows that
C(t) + Ke−r(T−t) = Put(t) + S(t); t ≤T
(5.3.2)
and is called the put–call parity.

Option theory
5.4 Quantum mechanical pricing of options
The central problem in option pricing is the following: given the payoff function
at some future time T, what is the price of the option at an earlier time t < T,
namely C(t, S(t))? The standard approach for addressing option pricing in mathe-
matical ﬁnance is based on stochastic calculus [Jarrow and Turnbull (2000)]. An
independent derivation for the price of the option is given based on the formalism
of quantum mechanics [Baaquie (2008)].
A stock of a company is never negative since the owner of a stock has none
of the company’s liabilities, and a right to dividends and pro rata ownership of a
company’s assets. Hence
S = ex ≥0; −∞≤x ≤+∞
The stock price, at each instant, is considered to have a random value, making
it mathematically identical to a quantum particle. The real variable x, similar to
a quantum system, can consequently be considered to be a degree of freedom
describing the behavior of the stock price.
Financial instruments are functions of x and form a state space, which is always
taken to be an inﬁnite-dimensional linear vector space. The state space is not a nor-
malizable Hilbert space since fundamental ﬁnancial instruments such as the stock
price S(x) are not normalizable. The state space consists of all possible functions of
the degree of freedom x.
Consider a linear vector space V with elements given by |ψ⟩; the dual space VD
consists of all mappings of elements V into the complex numbers. Elements of the
dual vector space are denoted by ⟨χ|; let |ψ⟩be an element of V. The mapping to
the complex numbers – called the inner product – is denoted by ⟨χ|ψ⟩: complex
number.
The completeness equation for the degree of freedom, from Eq. 2.4.12, is
given by
 ∞
−∞
dx|x⟩⟨x| = I: Completeness equation
I is the identity operator on (function) state space, |x⟩is a coordinate basis for the
state space and ⟨x| is the basis of the dual state space. The inner product can be
realized by the completeness equation by the following:
⟨χ|ψ⟩= ⟨χ|
( ∞

dx|x⟩⟨x|
)
|ψ⟩=
 ∞
−∞
dxχ∗(x)ψ(x): χ∗(x) = ⟨χ|x⟩; ψ(x) = ⟨x|ψ⟩
Option pricing in the framework of quantum mechanics is based on the following
assumptions.

5.4 Quantum mechanical pricing of options
81
• All ﬁnancial instruments, including the price of the option, are elements of a state
space. The stock price is given by
S(x) = ⟨x|S⟩= ex
The call option price and the payoff function are given by state vectors
C(t, x) = ⟨x|C, t⟩; g(x) = ⟨x|g⟩
and similarly for the put option.
• The option price is evolved by a Hamiltonian operator H, that, due to necessity
of fulﬁlling put–call parity, evolves both the call and put options.
• The price of the option satisﬁes the Black–Scholes–Schr¨odinger equation, which
is the analog of the Schr¨odinger equation in option theory and is the evolution
equation for the option price:
H|C, t⟩= ∂
∂t|C, t⟩
(5.4.1)
Eq. 5.4.1 yields the following
|C, t⟩= etH|C, 0⟩
The ﬁnal value condition given in Eq. 5.3.1 yields
|C, T⟩= eTH|C, 0⟩= |g⟩⇒|C, 0⟩= e−TH|g⟩
and hence
|C, t⟩= e−(T−t)H|g⟩
or, more explicitly, for remaining time τ = T −t,
C(t, x) = ⟨x|C, t⟩= ⟨x|e−τH|g⟩
(5.4.2)
Using the completeness equation, given in Eq. 2.4.12, yields
C(x, T −t; K) =
 ∞
−∞
dx′⟨x|e−τH|x′⟩g(x′) =

dx′P(x, x′; τ)g(x′)
(5.4.3)
and similarly for the put option
Put(t, x) =
 ∞
−∞
dx′⟨x|e−τH|x′⟩h(x′)
(5.4.4)
where the pricing kernel is given by
P(x, x′; τ) = ⟨x|e−τH|x′⟩
(5.4.5)
The pricing kernel p(x, x′; τ) is the conditional probability that, given the value
of the stock is ex at time t, the stock price will have the value of ex′ at future time

82
Option theory
T = t + τ.1 Eq. 5.4.5 shows that the pricing kernel is the matrix element of the
differential operator e−τH, and is the evolution kernel.
5.5 Martingale condition: Hamiltonian
The fundamental theorem of ﬁnance states that for option price to be free from
arbitrage opportunities, the Hamiltonian H must yield a martingale evolution [Hull
(2000)]. The martingale condition is the mathematical expression in probability
theory of a fair game in which, on the average, a gambler leaves the casino with the
money with which the gambler enters.
Mathematically, a martingale states that the expectation value of a (random)
stochastic process, say the evolution of a stock price S(t), is such that the discounted
value of its future price is equal to its present price. In equations, for S = ex, the
martingale condition, for τ = T −t, is given by
ex = e−rτ
 ∞
−∞
dx′P(x, x′; τ)ex′: Martingale condition
(5.5.1)
where r is the risk-free spot rate.
Writing
P(x, x′; τ) = ⟨x|e−τH|x′⟩; ex = ⟨x|S⟩
the martingale relation given in Eq. 5.5.1 together with the completeness equation
given in Eq. 2.4.12 yields the following expression [Baaquie (2004)]:
⟨x|S⟩= ⟨x|e−τH
 ∞
−∞
dx′|x′⟩⟨x′|S⟩= ⟨x|e−τH|S⟩
e−τH|S⟩= |S⟩⇒H|S⟩= 0 ⇐⇒Hex = 0
(5.5.2)
The martingale evolution is expressed by the fact that the Hamiltonian annihilates
the underlying security S; this fact is of far-reaching consequence in ﬁnance since
it holds for more complicated systems like the forward interest rates.
5.6 Hamiltonian and option pricing
What should be the form of the Hamiltonian driving option pricing? Assume that
H has the following fairly general form:
1 To rigorously deﬁne the conditional probability, p(x, x′; τ) has to be normalized as follows:
p(x, x′; τ) →
p(x, x′; τ)

dx′p(x, x′; τ)

H = a + b ∂

(5.6.1)
The necessity of obeying the martingale condition given in Eq. 5.5.2 rules out any
potential term V(x) in the Hamiltonian of the form H + V.
Consider for starters the price of a put option. Suppose the strike price K →
+∞; then the payoff function has the following limit h(S) = (K −S)+ →K:
constant. Hence, similar to Eq. 5.4.2
Put(t, x) = ⟨x|e−τH|h⟩→⟨x|e−τH|K⟩= e−aτK
Since K →+∞, the option is certain to be exercised, and the holder of the option,
in exchange for the stock he or she holds, is going to be paid an amount K at future
time T. The present-day value of the put option, from the principle of no arbitrage,
must be the value of K discounted to the present by the risk-free spot interest rate.
Hence
Put →e−rτK
⇒a = r
The martingale condition is given in Eq. 5.5.2, that is,
Hex = 0 ⇒b = σ 2

(5.6.2)

(5.6.3)
Note H is not Hermitian; this is a general feature of all Hamiltonians in ﬁnance,
the root cause of which arises from the requirement of satisfying the martingale
condition [Baaquie (2004)].
The option requires a representation of the two following distinct concepts of
time, shown in Figure 5.2.
• When the option is sold, at time t, the option is set to mature at future time T,
which exists at present time t in the minds of the buyers and sellers of options.
• The option matures at future calendar time T.

at future time T to present time t is done by the spot rate r. These two forms of
discounting are shown in Figure 5.2. A more complex form of discounting the
payoff function for future calendar time and present future time appears in the
index-linked coupon bonds, and is given in Figure 12.4.
The Black–Scholes Hamiltonian makes no reference to the market value of the
drift of the stock price, which is determined by its rate of return. The reason is
that the price of option can only reﬂect the risk-free rate of return given by r,
since otherwise it would be open to arbitrage opportunities [Hull (2000); Jarrow
and Turnbull (2000)].
The evolution of the option price, for remaining time deﬁned by τ = T −t, is
given by the Black–Scholes–Schrodinger equation:

The parameter σ is the called the volatility of the stock price, and indicates the
degree to which the evolution of the stock price is random.
In terms of the variable S = ex and calendar time t, the Black–Scholes–

(5.6.5)
and is the manner in which this equation usually appears in the literature in ﬁnance
[Jarrow and Turnbull (2000)].

5.7 Black–Scholes Hamiltonian: Pricing kernel
85
5.6.1 Put–call parity
In the notation of expectation values, writing out the call option as C(τ, x) =
C(S, T −t, K), the call and put options are given by
C(S, T −t, K) = e−r(T−t)E(S(T) −K)+; Put(S, T −t, K) = e−r(T−t)E(K −S(T))+
If one compares the above expression for the call option with the one given in
Eq. 5.4.3, it becomes clear that the pricing kernel provides an explicit and concrete
realization of how to take the expectation value of the future payoff function. The
martingale condition is given by
S(t) = e−r(T−t)E[S(T)]; T > t:
Martingale condition
(5.6.6)
The payoff functions for call and put can be written using the Heaviside  function
as follows:
(S −K)+ = (S −K)(S −K); (K −S)+ = (K −S)(K −S)
Using the identity for the  function given in Eq. 2.4.4 yields
(S −K)+ −(K −S)+ = S −K
Taking the expectation value of the above identity and discounting by the spot rate
yields that the call and put option obey
e−r(T−t)
E(S(T) −K)+) −E(K −S(T))+)

= e−r(T−t)
E(S(T)) −E(K)

Using the martingale condition given in Eq. 5.6.6 yields
C(S(t), τ, K) −Put(S(t), τ, K) = S(t) −e−r(T−t)K
which is the put–call parity given in Eq. 5.3.2.
5.7 Black–Scholes Hamiltonian: Pricing kernel
To get a ﬂavor of how the formalism of quantum mechanics can address problems
in ﬁnance, consider the calculation of the pricing kernel:
P(x, x′; τ) = ⟨x|e−τH|x′⟩; τ = T −t
(5.7.1)
The ﬁrst step in determining the pricing kernel is to ﬁnd the eigenfunctions of H.
This can be done efﬁciently by going to the “momentum” basis in which H is
diagonal. The Fourier transform of the |x⟩basis to momentum space is given by
⟨x|x′⟩= δ(x −x′) =

that yields, for momentum space basis |p⟩, the completeness equation

2π |p⟩⟨p| = I
(5.7.2)
with the scalar products given by
⟨x|p⟩= eipx; ⟨p|x⟩= e−ipx

One might be tempted to consider evaluating the matrix element ⟨p|H|x⟩by directly
differentiating on |x⟩; but ⟨p|∂/∂x|x⟩̸= ∂/∂x⟨p|x⟩and hence this would give an
incorrect answer.
The operators ∂/∂x and H are deﬁned by their action on the dual coordinate
basis ⟨x| and not on the basis |x⟩; for a Hermitian Hamiltonian this distinction is
irrelevant since both procedures give the same answer – and hence this issue is
ignored in quantum mechanics – but this is not so for the non-Hermitian case. In
fact, it is precisely the non-Hermitian drift term that comes out with the wrong sign
if one acts on the basis |x⟩with H.
For example, the Black–Scholes Hamiltonian yields the following result:
⟨p|H|x⟩= ⟨x|H†|p⟩∗=

It can be seen from Eq. 5.7.4 that functions eipx are eigenfunctions of H, labeled by
the “momentum” index p and Eq. 5.7.2 shows that the eigenfunctions are complete.

and variance of σ 2(T −t), as is expected for the Black–Scholes case with constant
volatility [Hull (2000)].
In general for a more complicated (nonlinear) Hamiltonian it is not possible to
exactly diagonalize H, and consequently one cannot exactly evaluate the matrix
elements of e−τH, and other perturbative schemes have to be developed [Baaquie
(2014)].
5.8 Black–Scholes option price
Once the pricing kernel has been evaluated, the price of an option can be obtained
by Gaussian integration. Due to its widespread usage, an explicit derivation is given
of the call option price, which is given from Eq. 5.4.3 by

The result obtained above is the famous Black–Scholes formula for option pricing
[Hull (2000)], which continues to be one of the cornerstones of derivative instru-
ments, and of ﬁnancial engineering in general.
5.8.1 Implied volatility
The Black–Scholes formula unfortunately does not give an accurate price for the
options of equities and similar instruments. The reason is that the volatility param-
eter σ in the option price needs to be determined. Suppose one takes the volatility
to be the historical volatility of the underlying security S = ex and given by
σ 2
H = E[x2] −(E[x])2

88
Option theory
Then it can be easily shown, using market data, that the option price determined
using σ 2
H is incorrect.
The market price of an option, denoted by CM, is based on the trader’s view of the
future movement of the underlying security. The option’s volatility parameter in the
Black–Scholes formula, given in Eq. 5.8.2, is adjusted to produce the market value
of the option price, and is termed as implied volatility σ 2
I ; the implied volatility is
denoted by
σ 2
I (τ, K, t):
Implied volatility
and depends on strike price K, time to maturity T −t and calendar time t. The
market option price is given by
Cdata(S, T −t, K) = CBS(S, T −t, σI(τ, K, t), K)
(5.8.4)
In other words, the Black–Scholes equation is used in the market as a way of
representing the option price, once the implied volatility σ 2
I is given. The Black–
Scholes equation cannot predict the market’s option price.
The need to use implied volatility for pricing an option shows that the Black–
Scholes pricing formula does not have enough information to describe the pricing
of market-traded options. One possible reason for this is that the option price – at
a given instant – should depend not only on the value of the underlying security
S = ex, but also on the velocity of the underlying security dS/dt.
5.9 Option pricing
Let ˙x = dx/dt be the velocity of the logarithm of a security S = ex. In general,
the option price C can depend on the price and velocity of the security. A payoff
function H(x, v; K) can depend on both the ﬁnal stock value and velocity; for
remaining time τ = T −t
C(x(t), ˙x(t), τ, K) =

dxd˙x′P(x, ˙x; x′, ˙x′; τ)H(x′, ˙x′; K); ˙x = dx
dt
where the pricing kernel
P(x, ˙x; x′, ˙x′; τ)
is the conditional probability. The conditional probability is deﬁned to be the prob-
ability that the future value is x′, ˙x′ at time T, given the value of x, ˙x at present time t.
To clarify the notation, one writes
P(x, ˙x; x′, ˙x′; τ) = Pτ(x′, ˙x′|x, ˙x) = P(τ,x,˙x)(x′, ˙x′) ≥0

For payoff functions that do not depend on velocity ˙x, let
P(x, ˙x; x′; τ) =

d˙x′P(x, ˙x; x′, ˙x′; τ)
(5.9.1)
where P(x, ˙x; x′; τ) is the marginal conditional probability.
The Baaquie–Yang (BY) option price depends on both the value of the security
and its velocity but the payoff function is independent of velocity; for the European
call option, at time t, the BY option price is given by
CBY(x(t), ˙x(t), τ, K) =

(5.9.2)
In the quantum ﬁnance formulation of option prices, the conditional probability
P(x, ˙x; x′, ˙x′; τ) is given by an appropriately normalized transition amplitude, given
by the matrix element of an appropriate Hamiltonian operator that gives the transi-
tion amplitude of state |x′, ˙x′⟩to the dual state ⟨x, ˙x|. The transition amplitude
K(x, ˙x; x′, ˙x′; τ) = ⟨x, ˙x|e−τH|x′, ˙x′⟩
is the one given in Eq. 4.2.1, and hence can be realized by the acceleration Hamil-
tonian given in Eq. 4.1.1. The acceleration Hamiltonian H that depends on both x, v
is given by Eq. 4.1.1:

The minus sign in deﬁning v is due to the Hamiltonian, which is deﬁned for
Euclidean time [Baaquie (2014)].
The Hamiltonian H does not satisfy the martingale condition given in Eq. 5.5.2
since
Hex ̸= 0
Hence, the transition amplitude is replaced by the conditional probability
P(x, ˙x; x′, ˙x′; τ), which is given by normalizing the transition amplitude as follows

The BY model for option pricing – proposed by Baaquie and Yang (2014) – is
based on the Lagrangian and action given in Eq. 4.4.3, and is a generalization of
the Black–Scholes case.
The conditional possibility is given by the transition amplitude given by Eq.

5.11 Martingale: Conditional probability
Consider the case of foreign exchange (FX) options, as the martingale condition is
more general than for equities; let rf and rd be the risk-free foreign and the domestic
interest rates, respectively. The martingale condition for an equity is obtained by
setting rf = 0.
Let the domestic currency be $1 and the value of a foreign currency be given by
$ex. As discussed in Baaquie and Yang (2014) and Baaquie et al. (2014a), the FX
option martingale condition, generalizing Eq. 5.5.1, is given by

When the model is ﬁtted to market data, it is seen that the martingale condition
given in Eq. 5.11.3 is violated. In particular, α, for large τ, deviates from 1 whereas
ξ converges to zero [Baaquie and Yang (2014); Baaquie et al. (2014a)]. Even more
interesting is that ξ goes through a minimum as one increases τ, ﬁnally converging
to 0 for large τ. Only for τ near 0 is ξ ≃0 and α ≃1 – as required by the martingale
condition given in Eq. 5.11.3.
5.12 Market time
To accurately price options, one needs to introduce two new parameters λ and η
such that

The parameters λ and η allows us to rescale and dilate calendar time τ. The function
z(t) is called market time to differentiate it from calendar time t [Baaquie and
Bouchaud (2004); Baaquie (2004)].
Market time is the subjective estimate of time in the minds of the traders, whereas
calendar time is physical time. The parameters λ, η are a measure of market time,
which is greater than calendar time for t < λ and less for t > λ. The difference
between t and z, when η < 1, is shown in Figure 5.4. The transition amplitude is

Option theory
The model is calibrated by varying the parameters of the model, given by
a, r, ζ, λ, η to minimize the R2 error. The BY model option price is matched to the
market price by replacing τ in the model by z = λ((T −t)/λ)η, and yields
Cdata(S, K, T −t, t) = CBY(x(t), dx(z)/dz, z(T −t), K)
R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) are chosen to measure the goodness
of ﬁt. For each calendar date t, implied volatility is used to generate the market
option price Cdata, so the R-square and RMSE are functions of calendar time t. R2
is deﬁned, for the remaining time τn, by the following:

good ﬁt with R2 = 0.998. The typical values of the parameters for equity is given

Noteworthy 5.1 FX option data
In the FX market implied volatilities are quoted in terms of delta of the Black–
Schloes option price. There are various deﬁnitions of delta. Hence, for the correct
interpretation of the implied volatility quotes, it is important to know which deﬁ-
nition is being used [Baaquie and Yu (2017)]. From Eq. 5.8.2, the Black–Scholes
formula for FX European vanilla call options is given by

currency is included in the delta. The premium-included delta is calculated as
follows:

S = K

Option theory
The logic of this premium-included delta can be illustrated with an example. Con-
sider a bank that sells a call option on a foreign currency. This option can be delta
hedged with an amount of delta of the foreign currency. However, the bank will
only have to buy an amount equal to the premium-included delta when it receives
the premium in the foreign currency.
It can be observed from the above formula that the premium-included delta for a
call is not strictly decreasing in strike price like the Black–Scholes call delta.
5.13.2 FX options
The market price for FX options is given for the ATM strike price, for which K = S.
The parameters of the By model are calibrated using the ATM option price. The
option price is ﬁtted for K, τ and then compared with the result obtained using the
implied volatility surface. The parameters for the ATM ﬁtting yield an excellent ﬁt
with R2 = 0.9993.
The parameters obtained from the ATM ﬁtting, using the BY model, can generate
the price for all values of K, τ. The result obtained for the whole surface is slightly
worse than ﬁt just for ATM, and is shown in Figure 5.6. The parameters are given
in Table 5.2. The Black–Scholes formula with constant volatility has R2 = 0.9989,
but has higher RMS error: 17.9% compared with = 13.4% for the BY model.
The results for the BY option price as well as for Black–Scholes (BS) option
price and the market price are shown in Figure 5.6. The best ﬁt for the model’s
parameters is given in Table 5.2.

A detailed study has been done by Baaquie and Yu (2017) of the option of the
exchange rate of ﬁve major currencies against the US dollar, which are the euro,
British pound (GBP), Swiss franc (CHF), yen, and Australian dollar (AUD). The
Canadian dollar is highly correlated with the US dollar and the New Zealand dollar
with the AUD, and hence their analysis does not give any new insights.
The BY model, which has ﬁve free parameters, is ﬁtted to the ATM FX option
for eight different maturities; the results show, not surprisingly, that the BY model
yields an almost perfect ﬁt of the FX option of the ﬁve currencies with R2 greater
than 0.997. It has been shown by Baaquie and Yu (2017) that the BY option price
provides an almost perfect ﬁt of the ATM FX options for ﬁve major currencies
against the USD, which are the euro, GBP, CHF, AUD and yen.
5.14 FX options and market instability
A detailed study of FX options for the exchange rate of various currencies against
the US dollar, for the period from 2011 to 2015, shows the following behavior.
• For all currencies, there are “normal” periods where the BY model ﬁts the data
fairly well.
• There are sudden intermittent periods that punctuate the normal period. And
for these periods, the model fails dramatically, and this failure of the market is
attributed by Baaquie and Yu (2017) to be due to market instability.
• The volatility of the underlying FX rate is not a suitable indicator of market
instability.
The hypothesis put forward by Baaquie and Yu (2017) is that the failure of the
BY model to ﬁt market data is due to the effects of instability and nonlinearities that
are not captured by the BY model – since the BY model is essentially Gaussian. The
linearity of the BY model is used by postulating that market instability introduces
nonlinear effects causing the model to fail. In other words, it is the very failure of
the model that is used as a barometer and as a gauge for concluding that the FX
market has entered an unstable and nonlinear phase that could also potentially be a
crisis phase.
The behavior of FX options is an accurate gauge of the state of the international
ﬁnancial system. The FX markets are international and operate 24 hours a day – and

are expected to quickly respond to the changing tides of the major economic powers
[Garman and Kohlhagen (1983)]. Furthermore, there is a high volume of daily FX
transaction: trading in foreign exchange markets averaged US$5.09 trillion per day
in April 2016.3 High liquidity and the key role of currencies in the major economies
makes the FX option a reasonable gauge of the international ﬁnancial system.
It is empirically shown by Baaquie and Yu (2017) that all major currencies,
except for the Swiss franc, were heavily inﬂuenced by the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.
Only the cases of the euro and Swiss franc are analyzed, as the other major curren-
cies behave similar to the euro.
5.14.1 Euro
The BY model is used for predicting the euro FX option price data and is shown to
be useful as a gauge of the market’s instability. The drop in the accuracy of the BY-
model below 0.99 is used as an indicator of the failure of the model, due to market’s
instability leading to nonlinear behavior. The BY model could correctly reﬂect the
occurrence of the global ﬁnancial crisis on the EURUSD exchange rate. This result
is shown in Figure 5.7(a),with the period of the ﬁnancial crisis being indicated by I.
The price of EURUSD option was disordered for a short period after the 2008
ﬁnancial crisis. The 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, however, triggered sovereign debt crisis
in Europe in 2013, and this is marked as II in Figure 5.7(a). The crisis denoted by
II could also have had contributions from the US ﬁnancial crisis of 2013. Hence,
ﬁnancial instability was correctly gauged by the failure of the model.
The result of FX options was empirically analyzed along with the volatility of the
FX rate. For example, as shown in Figure 5.7(b), although FX rate had a high

volatility during the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, there are other periods of low volatility
including the unstable period marked by II in Figure 5.7(a), even though there
was a marked market instability for the euro in the post-2014 period. Hence, it
is reasonable to conclude that the volatility of the FX rate is not a very precise
criterion of ﬁnancial instability.
5.14.2 Swiss franc
The behavior of the model for the case of the Swiss franc is one of the most
interesting. To start with, the 2007–2008 ﬁnancial crisis left the Swiss franc
untouched since it did not take part in the leveraging and high risk instruments in
which primarily the US and UK banks, and to a lesser extent the European banks,
were engaged. Figure 5.8(a) conﬁrms our expectation that the Swiss franc was not
affected much in 2008; in contrast, the euro, including the British pound, was highly
impacted.
The Swiss franc had a very big FX volatility from 2010 to 2012 as shown in
Figure 5.8(b). This is because of a policy of the Swiss government. After the crisis
broke out in 2008, there was a ﬂight to safety in Europe, with large ﬂows of money
to the Swiss banks. The inﬂow of money raised the value of the Swiss franc and
led to the Swiss policy, announced in September 2011, that set an upper limit to
the valuation of the CHF to the euro being capped at 1.2. The announcement of the
cap led to a short burst of instability, marked as I in Figure 5.8(a), and to a high
volatility period marked II in Figure 5.8(b).
On January 15, 2015, the Swiss suddenly canceled the upper limit of CHF against
the euro, which is a rare and unpredictable event and can be called a “Black Swan”
event. This rare event is correctly captured by the failure of the model – indicated by

the same period, showing that volatility of the Swiss franc’s exchange rate, unlike
the case of the euro, followed the instabilities of the FX option price.
5.15 Summary
Option theory was derived for any security from ﬁrst principles and using a com-
pletely quantum mechanical approach. The BS equation is based on one of the
simplest Hamiltonians, namely a free particle with a drift. One of the most impor-
tant features of the BS equation is that it is free from arbitrage opportunities. In
mathematical ﬁnance, a martingale evolution of the underlying security ensures
arbitrage-free pricing. It was shown that the Hamiltonian annihilating the underly-
ing security is equivalent to the martingale condition.
The acceleration Hamiltonian and action was used for pricing the option. Due
to the higher derivatives, the acceleration Hamiltonian requires the stock price and
its derivative for pricing the option. To ensure arbitrage-free pricing, the martingale
condition was imposed on the conditional expectation obtained from the pricing
kernel of the acceleration Hamiltonian. The martingale condition is not exactly met,
with deviations from martingale being precisely quantiﬁed by the parameters of the
model. The resulting model based on the acceleration Hamiltonian, called the BY-
pricing model, was applied to the pricing of FX options, Nasdaq-100 Index as well
as stock prices. It was shown that the BY model gives very accurate results.
A key feature of the BY model for option pricing is that it can be used to predict
the price of options – and does not need the implied volatility surface from the
market, as is the case of the BS option price. The reason the BY model does not need
the volatility surface is because the additional information carried by the velocity
of the underlying security carries information missing in the BS equation, and is
sufﬁcient to price the option. Apparently, the implied volatility surface is a means of
bringing in additional information to the BS model to offset the fact that it depends
only on the value of the security, and not also on its velocity.
The BY option price has been shown to precisely describe the instabilities of
the ﬁnancial market. The fundamental basis for describing market instability is to
assume that strong nonlinear effects become important when the market becomes
unstable. Since the BY model is based on a Gaussian linear model, one expects
the BY pricing formula to fail in accurately pricing FX options when market insta-
bilities set in. Empirical studies show that the predictions of the BY option price
of market instabilities are very accurate, and in particular, far more accurate than,
for instance, using increased volatility of the underlying security as an indicator of
market instability.

Path integral of asset prices*
6.1 Introduction
The ﬁeld of microeconomics is primarily concerned with the decisions made by
individual consumers and ﬁrms on the allocation of scarce resources among differ-
ent ﬁnancial assets. Furthermore, this decision of what to acquire and for how much
ﬁnally results in the relative prices of assets. In particular, microeconomics focuses
on the role of supply and demand in the determination of prices.
Traded ﬁnancial assets come in many forms and the prices of these assets are
determined by supply and demand. These assets include tangible entities like com-
modities, real estate, land, factories, forests, mines and so on; shares are a class of
assets tied to tangible assets whereas derivatives are a class of assets with only an
indirect connection to an underlying tangible asset.
A proposal, made by Baaquie (2013a), formulates a theory of prices based on the
concept of the action functional, denoted by A. A statistical generalization of asset
prices is made, where it is postulated that the market price of every traded asset
is a dynamic variable – and which can be modeled to be an independent random
variable for each instant of time. In other words, all asset prices are stochastic
variables, with their time evolution being a stochastic process.
It has been postulated by Baaquie (2013a) that supply and demand (S, D, respec-
tively) are not two separate entities but, in fact, are two facets of a single entity,
namely the microeconomic potential V, given by
V = D + S
The microeconomic potential is one of the terms of the action functional, the other
terms being kinetic that depend on the dynamic change of prices.
The action functional provides a complete description of asset prices. The behav-
ior of prices is modeled by the Feynman path integral based on the action functional.
In particular, all the correlation functions of asset prices are deﬁned using the
101

102
Path integral of asset prices
path integral. The empirical auto-correlation provides an accurate instrument for
calibrating the model as well as providing a stringent empirical test of the accuracy
of the model.
The existence of the action functional for commodity prices has been empirically
veriﬁed by Baaquie et al. (2015). The model’s correlation function for different
commodities – using a perturbation expansion of the Feynman path integral – has
been empirically determined and calibrated using market commodity prices. The
model has been extended to multiple ﬁnancial assets, and it has been empirically
shown that a minimal model can simultaneously provide a good ﬁt for up to four
commodities [Baaquie et al. (2016)]. In sum, market data provides strong empirical
evidence in support of the statistical formulation of traded prices.
In Chapter 24, a model proposed by Baaquie and Yu (2018) for futures prices
is discussed. The model for spot prices is extended to account for futures prices.
To model futures prices, future time is joined to calendar time. Futures prices
are modeled as a nonlinear quantum ﬁeld, deﬁned on a two-dimensional “space”
consisting of calendar time and future time.
The microecomic model is designed to price assets that have a well-deﬁned
paper value and with their price being the result of trading in the ﬁnancial markets.
The model can, in principle, price any ﬁnancial asset. Given the myriad forms
of ﬁnancial assets, to illustrate the workings of the model, the following three
important classes of ﬁnancial assets are analyzed.
• Stocks and Shares
There is a vast variety of shares, from blue chip companies to start-up companies
to high tech companies. For example, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), one
of the leading stock exchanges in the world, has stocks for some 2,800 companies
that are traded daily. Instead of analyzing the very diverse set of shares, only the
shares of Apple and Google are empirically analyzed to illustrate the accuracy of
the model.
• Foreign Currencies
According to the Bank for International Settlements, trading in foreign exchange
markets averaged US$5.09 trillion per day in April 2016. The model is applied
to FX rates for EURUSD and GBPUSD. The pricing of FX options based on a
similar model is analyzed in Chapter 5; see also Baaquie and Yu (2017).
• Commodities1
The main focus of this chapter is the study the prices of different categories
of commodities. About 20 commodities are analyzed for both their stand-
alone behavior and the cross-correlation of multiple commodities. The reason
1 The term “commodities” is used for goods and services that can be traded.

6.2 Microeconomic potential
103
for focusing on commodities is because there are only about 30 major traded
commodities, and these come in well-deﬁned groups such as energy, metals and
so on. So one can study the cross-correlation of commodity prices belonging to
similar and different groups. A similar exercise for shares would be far more
extensive and needs to be carried out at some stage in the future.
6.2 Microeconomic potential
Consider the prices of N traded assets, labeled by 1, 2, . . . , N. Financial assets are
priced by their quantity and price is given for a given quantity. Let a typical asset
have a unit of quantity denoted by ˆqi; for example, the quantity can be 1 kg for
wheat. The price of the asset for one unit of quantity is denoted by ˆPi; for example,
ˆPi is the price of 1 kg of wheat. The market price of an asset – denoted by pi – is
deﬁned to be independent of the unit of quantity, and given by
pi = ˆPi ˆqi; i = 1, 2, . . . , N
(6.2.1)
Let p = [p1, . . . , pN] be the prices of N assets and let D[p], S[p] be the demand
and supply function, respectively, for these assets. The potential function V[p],
similar to classical mechanics, drives the time evolution of market prices.
The microeconomic potential can be chosen to be the sum of supply and demand
[Baaquie (2013a)]:
V[p] = D[p] + S[p]
(6.2.2)
An example of the microeconomic potential is shown in Figure 6.1(a).
The breakup of the microeconomic potential into a sum of supply and demand
need not hold for all values of the price since the breakup is essentially an asymp-
totic property of the microeconomic potential. One expects from the behavior of

consumers that the demand for an asset increases with decreasing price, and, con-
comitantly, the production of an asset increases with increasing price. Hence, the
most general microeconomic potential is stipulated to have the following two lim-
iting cases:
V[p] ≃
 D[p]:
pi →0
S[p]:
pi →∞
(6.2.3)
The simple form of the microeconomic potential V[p] shown in Figure 6.1(a)
allows one to write it as a sum of a demand and supply function for all values of
the price. However, there can be complex cases of the microeconomic potential
with multiple minima, as shown in Figure 6.1(b), where the concept of a demand
and supply function is only asymptotic, according to the general property of the
microeconomic potential given in Eq. 6.2.3.
For the potential shown in Figure 6.1(b), the absolute minimum of the potential
ﬁxes the market price to be p2 – a result that cannot be obtained using the concept
of setting supply equal to demand. A potential with two minima allows the price
to make a transition from the higher minima at price p1 to the absolute minima
with price p2 – and one can model the jump in the price of an asset using the
microeconomic potential.
In summary, the standard microeconomic theory of determining market prices
by equating supply to demand is not valid in statistical microeconomics.
In the framework of statistical microeconomics, stationary prices are determined
by the minimum value of the microeconomic potential, which replaces the standard
microeconomic procedure of setting supply equal to demand. For the special case
when the prices are constant (time independent) – given by the constant prices
¯p = (¯p1, ¯p2, . . . , ¯pN) – the prices minimize the value of the potential; namely, V[¯p]
is a minimum of V[p]. More precisely, the microeconomic potential V[p] has its
minimum value at its extrema ¯p, given by
∂V[¯p]/∂pi = 0 ; i = 1, . . . , N
(6.2.4)
The equilibrium market price is given by ¯p. What happens when p ̸= ¯p? The
microeconomic potential V[p] then causes the prices to “move,” that is, to change
and tend toward ¯p. Clearly, the more abrupt the change, the more unlikely it is; the
change of price should, on the average, be gradual and relatively “smooth.” The
smooth movement of prices requires a kinetic term T [p(t)], which is added to the
action functional.
In analogy with classical mechanics, the microeconomic action functional is
taken to be the sum of the microeconomic potential term V[p] with the microe-
conomic kinetic term T [p], namely


T [p(t)] + V[p(t)]

(6.2.5)
The speciﬁc form of the microeconomic kinetic term T [p] is determined by mar-
ket data.
Although the concept of the kinetic term is taken from physics, it ﬁnds a natural
expression in the evolution of the prices of ﬁnancial assets. It will be discussed later
that T [p(t)] is quite unlike the kinetic terms that appear in physics.
The action functional A[p] depends on the function p(t), t ∈[−∞, +∞]: each
possible function p(t) gives one numerical value for A[p]. For this reason A[p] is
a functional of the price function and is called the action functional, or action in
brief.
The microeconomic Lagrangian is given by
L(t) = T [p(t)] + V[p(t)]
(6.2.6)
The kinetic term T [p(t)] contains the time derivatives of the prices and together
with the potential function V[p(t)] determines the time evolution of stochastic asset
prices.
The dynamics of market prices is determined by assigning a joint probabil-
ity distribution for all possible evolutions of the stochastic commodity prices.
The probability distribution of the stochastic evolution of commodity prices is
postulated, in analogy with statistical mechanics, to be given by the Boltzmann
distribution
Joint probability distribution ∝
exp{−A[p]}
(6.2.7)
The postulate encoded in Eq. 6.2.7 describes a classical random system which
has a behavior that is similar to that of a statistical mechanical system – with
the expression exp{−A[p]} determining the likelihood for the (different) random
trajectories of the random prices.
6.3 Microeconomic action functional
Consider N ﬁnancial assets, with market prices given by pI; I = 1, . . . , N. Prices
are always positive and can be represented by exponential variables as pI = p0exI;
the normalized logarithm of prices, denoted by xI, is deﬁned as
pI = p0exI; xI(t) = ln(pI(t)/p0); I = 1, . . . , N
The unit of price p0 can be taken $1.
The demand and supply function are modeled to depend on prices via indices

The coefﬁcients ˜di, ˜si are determined by macroeconomic factors such as interest
rates, unemployment, inﬂation and so on [Baaquie (2013a)].
For the purpose of modeling, prices in statistical microeconomics are expressed
in terms of variables that are measured from the equilibrium value of the commodity
and normalized by the volatility of the commodity:
yi(t) = xi(t) −¯xi
σi
; i = 1, . . . , N
(6.3.2)
¯xi is the equilibrium value and σi is volatility of xi, and are given by
∂V(¯xi)

= 0; σ 2
i = E[

xi −¯xi
.2]; E[xi] = ¯xi
(6.3.3)
where ¯pi = e¯xip0. To leading order in volatility, the normalized coordinate in
Eq. 6.3.2 yields
E[yi(t)] = 0; E[y2
i (t)] = 1
(6.3.4)
Eq. 6.3.4 will place a constraint on the path integral. The normalized coordinate yi
is further discussed further in Section 6.7.
The normalized asset price variables yi are all of O(1) and hence one can model
and compare vastly different ﬁnancial assets, such as grain and gold, that have very
different volatilities and prices. Recall in the statistical microeconomic approach
the microeconomic potential is the fundamental quantity that is obtained by adding
supply and demand. The supply and demand functions yield the following microe-
conomic potential:

where
di = ˜dip0e˜ai ¯xi; si = ˜sip0e−˜bi ¯xi; ai = ˜aiσi; bi = ˜biσi
For the case of multiple ﬁnancial assets, the microeconomic potential for the
N ﬁnancial assets is further generalized by including a term that depends on the
product of the prices of ﬁnancial assets – and which cannot be placed either in
the demand or in the supply component of the microeconomic potential. The mul-
tiple asset microeconomic potential, from Baaquie et al. (2016), is given by

(6.3.6)
The ij term is introduced to model the cross-correlation of the different ﬁnan-
cial assets. The motivation for the ij term is the following. The ﬁt for the single
commodity using the microeconomic potential is very accurate [Baaquie et al.
(2015)]. Hence, one would expect that the effect of multiple ﬁnancial assets should
be a perturbation on the single ﬁnancial assets potential. This is the reason that
the simplest modiﬁcation of the single asset microeconomic potential is used for
modeling multiple ﬁnancial assets, and for consistency we expect ij to be small.
The dynamics of the prices for N ﬁnancial assets is determined by the kinetic
term T [p(t)] that, in general, is given by

Similar to the reason that led to modeling the cross-correlations by the ij term
in the microeconomic potential V, we continue to model the kinetic term to be
solely determined by the single asset, with the correlation with other ﬁnancial assets
completely accounted for by the ij term in the Lagrangian. Hence, the kinetic term
is chosen to be diagonal, with no cross-terms among the different ﬁnancial assets,

To map the model to the market, it is assumed that the stationary price of the
ﬁnancial asset ¯x is given by its average market value ˆx; this yields
ˆxi = ¯xi
(6.4.3)
Hence, from Eq. 6.4.2
eˆxi =

˜ai ˜di
˜bi˜si
-(1/(˜ai+˜bi))
(6.4.4)
Eq. 6.4.4 is one of the equations required for calibrating the model with market data.
Eqs. 6.3.5, 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 yield
aidi = bisi
(6.4.5)
Eq. 6.4.5 is another equation required for calibrating the Lagrangian.
Eq. 6.4.5 also directly follows from Eq. 6.3.5 by requiring that the potential has
a minimum for ¯yi = 0. From Eq. 6.3.5

6.4.1 Expansion of potential
From the deﬁnition of yi given in Eq. 6.3.2, the minimum of the action is about
yi = 0. Hence, expanding the potential yields

Let T be a constant parameter with dimension of time; for example T = 1 day.
A derivative has dimension of 1/T and integration has dimension T. Hence one
assigns, from the action and Lagrangian, the following dimensions to the different
parameters:
[Li] = T3; [*Li] = T; γi, βi, αi, ij = T−1
One can verify that all the formulas developed to model asset prices are dimension-
ally consistent using the above assignment of dimensions.
Physical quantities can be represented using the dimensions of the parameters.
For example, suppose the turnover of a commodity C is quantity unit ˆq per day.
Then one can express the turnover in various units:
ˆC = ˆqL−1/3,
ˆq*L−1,
ˆqγ , . . .
Of course it is a separate matter whether the market turnover is actually related
to one of the parameters of the action, but that is an empirical question that only
market data can settle.
The dimensional analysis of the parameters for holds for market time, introduced
later, as well, since the Lagrangian given in Eq. 6.9.3 for market time does not
change the dimensions of the parameters.
6.5 Feynman perturbation expansion
To evaluate the correlation functions for the nonlinear action for commodity prices
A is an intractable problem.2 Feynman perturbation expansion expands the correla-
tion functions about the quadratic action A0, for which all the correlation functions
can be exactly evaluated using Gaussian path integration, and brieﬂy discussed in
Section 2.11.
2 The terms “correlation functions” and “correlators” are used interchangeably.

112
Path integral of asset prices
The basic idea is to expand the nonlinear and cross-correlation terms exp{Ac +
AI} in a power series, and then evaluate the expanded exponential term by term.
Each term in the expansion can be evaluated using Gaussian integration; this, in
essence, is what constitutes Feyman perturbation expansion.
Consider the correlation of two commodity prices at two different times. The
Feynman perturbation expansion yields the following:
DIJ(t −t′) = 1
Z

Dye−A0[y]yI(t)yJ(t′)
(
1 −(Ac + AI) + 1
2!(Ac + AI)2 + · · ·
)
The evaluation of this rather complicated path integral is broken into the follow-
ing component parts.
• The auto-correlation is evaluated using a Feynman propagator for the single
commodity, labeled by I, and is given by
D(0)
II (t −t′) = 1
Z

Dye−A0[y]yI(t)yI(t′)
All the terms in the Feynman expansion are expressed in terms of the Feynman
propagator D(0)
II (t−t′). The superscript of 0 indicates that the Feynman propagator
is a Gaussian propagator evaluated using the quadratic action A0, and is not the
exact propagator DII(t −t′).
• The cross-correlation of two different commodities is evaluated, given by
D(0)

The empirical auto-correlation function of commodities follows the behavior given
by the complex branch. The structure of the Feynman propagator of an exponential
dampening multipied by the sine of the time lag |t −t′| is a reﬂection of the
fourth derivative in the Lagrangian and is essential to ﬁt the empirical correlation
of commodity prices.

cosh(2ϑ) > 1 there is an additional constraint that
*L >

4Lγ > 0
Hence D(0)(t −t′) is given by
D(0)(t −t′) =

models, discussed later in Chapters 10 and 19.

model’s parameter of the complex branch. The shape of the cross-correlator given

result obtained by ﬁtting the model to market prices.

6.6 Nonlinear terms: Feynman diagrams
The Gaussian propagator can only yield three parameters, namely L, ˜L and ,
whereas the action has six parameters. Hence, we need to use the nonlinear terms
in the action to fully calibrate the model.
The calibration of the nonlinear terms of the model is absolutely indispensable.
The reason is that it is only the nonlinear terms that go beyond the Gaussian model
and provide a microeconomic potential that has a minimum – and which is neces-
sary for matching the average market price of a given commodity. In particular, in
the absence of the nonlinear terms, the quadratic potential yields all average market
prices to be zero and is clearly quite useless for analyzing market prices.
It is shown below that the value of the nonlinear terms is ten times greater than
the error term, demonstrating that the value of the nonlinear terms is a deﬁning
feature of market prices. To check the consistency of the evaluation of the nonlinear
terms using Feynman diagrams, a numerical simulation is carried out in Section 6.8
to conﬁrm that the range of the nonlinear terms obtained from the market data can
in fact be obtained using the Feynman perturbation expansion.
The action is written in terms of the normalized variable y(t):
A =

where
α = (−a3de−a¯y + b3seb¯y) = (b −a)γ
β = (a4de−a¯y + b4seb¯y) = (a2 −ab + b2)γ
Once α, β, γ , ¯y have been obtained from market data, the potential’s parameter of
a, b, s, d are given by the following:

a higher order of the Feynman expansion. Expanding the action functional yields
the following power series:

6.7 Normalization
Recall from Eq. 6.3.4
E[yI(t)] = 0; E[y2

The cubic term given in Eq. 6.4.8 yields

dtD(0)(t) ≡ˆyI
The normalized variable picks up an average value as one goes to higher order and
hence yI needs to be redeﬁned, order by order; for the ﬁrst-order correction, one has
the following shift:
yI(t) →yI(t) −ˆyI
The shift in the stochastic variables yI(t) does not impose any constraint on the
model’s parameters. From the deﬁnition of the yI(t) given in Eq. 6.3.4:
E[xI] = σE[yI] + ¯xI = σ ˆyI + ¯xI
(6.7.1)
The other condition is more important; to lowest order, from Eq. 6.5.4, the
constraint yields
E[y2
I (t)] = D(0)(0) =
ω
2γ sin 2φ sin φ =
ω
4γ cos φ
(6.7.2)
Recall ω = (γ/L)1/4. Eq. 6.7.2 shows that
E[y2

1
4L1/4γ 3/4 cos φ
(6.7.3)
5 E[y4(t)]c = E[y(t)4] −3E[y2(t)]E[y2(t)].

6.7 Normalization
119
The result above shows that for the path integral to be convergent, it is necessary that
L, γ > 0. Note in particular, the convergence of the path integral is independent of
˜L, and which can take positive or negative values – leading to the real and complex
branches, respectively. The microeconomic potential (supply and demand terms)
yields only the γ term for the propagator; however, this term is necessary for a
convergent path integral, showing that for commodity prices to exist, it is necessary
that there be a microeconomic potential based on supply and demand.
Impose the normalization on E[y2
I (t)], which yields, from Eq. 6.7.3, a constraint
on the parameters given by
E[y2
I (t)] = 1 ⇒
cos φ = ω
4γ =
1
4L1/4γ 3/4 > 0
(6.7.4)
The condition given in Eq. 6.7.4 results in the path integral always being conver-
gent; this is because the condition E[y2
I (t)] = 1 constrains the parameters in the
path integral and ensures its convergence. Since y(t) is a real degree of freedom,
the convergence of the path integral requires
L > 0; γ > 0
Using Eq. 6.7.4, the parameter ˜L can be removed from the calibration since it
depends on L, γ . From Eq. 6.5.2,
*L =
0
4Lγ cos(2φ) =
0
4Lγ (2 cos2(φ) −1) = 1
4γ −2
0
Lγ
(6.7.5)
The convergence of the path integral does not depend on the sign of *L and hence
*L > 0 or *L < 0
The constraint on *L reduces the number of free parameters from ﬁve to four and
makes the model even more stringent than otherwise. Eqs. 6.5.4 and 6.7.4 yields
the Feynman propagator
D(0)(t −t′) =
1
sin φ e−ω|t−t′| cos(φ) sin{φ + ω|t −t′| sin(φ)}
(6.7.6)
In calibrating the model, parameters ω, φ are taken as the independent parameters;
Eq. 6.7.4 yields the value of γ and ω, φ – and which yields the values of L, ˜L from
Eqs. 6.7.4 and 6.7.5.
To second order, one has the result, from Eq. 6.5.9, that
1 = E[y2
I (0)]c = D(0)
I (0) −βI
2 D(0)
I (0)

dt(D(0)

Path integral of asset prices
To obtain the new constraint on γ recall that the Feynman propagator, from
Eq. 6.5.4 and dropping the subscript I, is written as
D(0)(t −t′) = Ne−ω|t−t′| cos(φ) sin{φ + ω|t −t′| sin(φ)}; N =
ω
2γ sin 2φ
(6.7.8)
Note γ factors out of the integration and we obtain, for C = C(ω, φ),
1 = N sin(φ) −βI
2 N 3 sin(φ)C ⇒γ =
ω
4 cos φ −β
8
ωC
cos φ sin2 φ + O(β2)
For the purpose of calibrating γ from data, Eq. 6.7.4 is used as it is sufﬁciently
accurate.
The redeﬁnition of γ , order by order in perturbation theory, is analogous to ﬁeld
renormalization discussed later in Section 15.4.
The higher order corrections bring about higher order changes in the deﬁnition
of the normalized variable yI. The parameter σ is given by
E[x2
I ] −E[xI]2 = σ 2
I E[y2
I (0)]c = σ 2
I
In other words, by holding E[y2
I (0)]c = 1, the value of σI does not change in higher
order and is an independent parameter of the model ﬁxed by the market volatility
of xI.
Recall from Eq. 6.4.3 that the value of ¯xI that minimizes the potential is set equal

Eq. 6.7.10 replaces Eq. 6.4.4 in the calibration of the model’s parameters. In this
manner, as one goes to higher and higher order of perturbation theory, the deﬁni-
tions of the normalized parameters are “renormalized”.

1. Use cross-correlation Eq. 6.5.8 and auto-
correlation Eq. 6.5.4 to ﬁt all data points to ﬁnd ω φ, λ, and η.
2. Substitute ω, φ, λ and η into Eqs. 6.7.4, 6.5.10, 6.5.11 and 6.5.2 to get

3. Using the value of all parameters obtained above as in Eqs. 6.4.5, 6.4.9, 6.4.10

6.8 Path integral: Monte Carlo simulation
The Lagrangian for asset prices is fundamentally nonlinear since the microeco-
nomic potential has a power-law dependence on the commodity prices. Since the
theory is nonlinear, one needs to determine what is the range of α, β for which the
perturbation expansion using Feynman diagrams is valid.
The values obtained for α, β are small, as in the example of cocoa in Section
6.7, and hence the Feynman expansion is justiﬁed. However, for other assets, the
value of α, β may be large; hence, the range of α, β needs to be determined for
which using the Feynman diagrams is in fact consistent. For this reason a numerical
calculation is carried out that does not assume α, β are small and ﬁnds the range for
which the Feynman expansion is valid.
A Monte Carlo simulation for numerically evaluating the Feynman path integral

discussed

theory
[Tanputraman (2014)]. The main purpose of the simulation is to ascertain the
range of the Lagrangian’s parameters for which perturbation theory is valid. This is
of fundamental importance in the calibration of the model since empirical analysis
is efﬁcient and accurate if the correlation functions can be expressed as analytic
functions of the model’s parameters.

122
Path integral of asset prices
If the calibration leads to parameters outside the perturbative regime, then the
calibration of the model would require evaluating the path integral numerically for
each possible ﬁt for the model’s parameters with market data. This would make the
calibration much more difﬁcult, if not impractical, and with large systematic errors
due to the errors from the numerical evaluation of the path integral. The Monte
Carlo simulation of the path integral, however, shows that, in fact, the parameters
required to match market data lie well within the perturbative domain of the path
integral.
The simulation builds on the work of Ming (1988). The theoretical basis needed
for the simulation is discussed, within the context of the commodity path integral,
and some relevant ideas are clariﬁed.
The fundamental goal of the simulation is to numerically calculate the expecta-
tion value of an observable Q given by
E[Q(x)] = 1

Dxe−A(x)Q(x), where Z =

The functional integration

Dx is over all the possible paths that x(t) can take. The
number of these possible paths is inﬁnite and hence a straightforward calculation
of the path integral is impractical. For simplicity, suppose time is periodic with a
period τ, namely that
x(t) = x(t + τ):
Periodic
For studying the correlation function for market prices, the limit of τ →∞will be
taken. The correlation function for the periodic path integral is given by
C(t) = 1
Z

Dx exp(−A[x])x(0)x(t)
Note that most of the paths (functions) over which C(t) is evaluated have negli-
gible weight since the Boltzmann weighting factor exp{−A(x)} is sharply peaked
about a few paths. The most probable paths are only those close to the classical
solution. Leveraging on this fact, the Metropolis algorithm was introduced [Robert
and Casella (1999)] as a method of importance sampling, called the Monte Carlo
method, for evaluating the Feynman path integral.

The correlation functions for the quadratic action A0[x] can be evaluated exactly

the exact lattice result.
Since time has a periodic boundary condition, the discrete variables have the

increases, the correlation function of the simulated conﬁgurations converges to the
expected values for continuous time t.
All the simulations are run with the same number of conﬁgurations given by
M = 100, 000. As expected, systems with larger N have a lower convergence
rate. The amount of time needed to update the conﬁgurations increases linearly
with N, and hence constitutes a limitation of the algorithm; for M number of
conﬁgurations, the error for the simulation is proportional to 1/
√
M.
The results given in Figure 6.7 show that expectation values obtained from the
simulation converge to the expected theoretical values. A major weakness of the
algorithm is that a signiﬁcant amount of time would be necessary to simulate sys-
tems with larger N. In addition, simulating a Lagrangian with an acceleration term
requires a signiﬁcantly larger number of iterations than otherwise. The results given
in Figure 6.7 verify that the simulation is accurate and the Monte Carlo simulation
of the path integral can be used for determining the range for perturbation theory.
The parameters L, ˜L and  are ﬁrst ﬁxed using market data and then the value for

The numerical values of E[y3] and E[y4], as a function of α, β, are compared with
the perturbative values, as given in Eqs. 6.6.1 and 6.6.2, respectively. The results are
shown in Figure 6.8 and we conclude that the range for the validity of the Feynman
perturbation expansion is given by

6.9 Mapping model to market data
The empirical correlator is denoted by the notation of GIJ(t) and is deﬁned by the
expectation value of the market prices and given by
GIJ(τ) = E[yI(t)yJ(t + τ)]
The key to the evaluation of GIJ(τ) is that it is function of only the time lag
between prices at different times – and is independent of t. Hence, one can sum
over the sample values of yI(tn)yJ(tn + τ) – with a constant time lag τ – and equate
the sample average to GIJ(τ).
More precisely, for a time series data set with time interval of ϵ, the prices are
given by yI(t) = yI(n), where t = nϵ and we have τ = kϵ; for a ﬁxed set of N
sample points, the correlator is given by the following moving average:
GIJ(τ) = GIJ(k) = E[yI(n)yI(n + k)]c

market =

N −k
N−k

n=1
yI(n)yJ(n + k) (6.9.1)
Note as time lag k gets larger, the number of data points used to ﬁnd GIJ(τ) in
Eq. 6.9.1 also decreases; and hence the value of the correlator for large time lag is
not very accurate.
The market value of the correlator is obtained by taking the moving average
over the data set, as given in Eq. 6.9.1. The model always yields a correlator that
is a symmetric function of IJ, which is not necessarily the case for the market
correlator [Baaquie et al. (2012)]. To equate the market correlator with the model,
it is symmetrized
GIJ(τ) = GJI(τ)
by symmetrizing its evaluation from market data

The parameter of time for the market and model are not the same. The reason
is that time for traders is determined by the liquidity of the market and rate of
transactions [Baaquie (2004)]. To reﬂect this feature of the market, deﬁne market
time z(τ) by

the single commodity,

The propagator is ﬁt ﬁrst as it does not depend on αI, βI. The parameters φI, ωI
in the formula for GI(t) on the right-hand side of Eq. 6.9.6 are varied so as to ﬁnd
the best ﬁt to the data points obtained for empirical GI(t). Once φI, ωI have been
obtained, one can determine the values of LI, ˜LI and γI.
The analytical expressions given in Eqs. 6.6.1 and 6.6.2 for E[y3
I ] and E[y4
I ] are
used to ﬁt the market data for a single asset. The empirical values of α, β are seen to
lie in the range given in Eq. 6.8.1. The values of αI and βI are obtained to reproduce
the market values for E[y3
I ] and E[y4
I ]. The fact that the best ﬁts for αI, βI lie within
the perturbative range makes the calibration accurate and efﬁcient.
6.10 Equity and FX rates
The model is ﬁrst applied to equity and FX rates. As mentioned earlier, from the vast
variety of share prices, Apple and Google are chosen as they have the most liquid
shares and hence yield market-driven prices. There are seven major currencies
and the EURUSD (e-US$) is the most widely traded currency pair. The empirical
analysis of two FX rates, EURUSD (e-US$) and GBPUSD (£-US$), is sufﬁcient
to demonstrate the general features of FX rates. The results are summarized in
Table 6.1. Recall from Eq. 6.7.5
*L = 1
4γ −2

Lγ
All ﬁts for the prices of equities, FX rates and commodities have *L < 0. This is
the reason that the complex branch of the model is required for ﬁtting the securities
prices.

• There are four parameters – γ , L, η, λ – that are varied to make the model ﬁt the
market’s auto-correlation function.
• There are three distinct shapes given in Figures 6.9 and 6.10.
• Apple in Figure 6.9(a) and GBPUSD in Figure 6.10(b) are similar, with a deep
minimum; this is because they have approximately the same value of λ ≈0.1.
• The ﬁt for Google in Figure 6.9(b) is reasonably accurate in spite of the irregular
behavior of its market auto-correlation function. The model can give a prediction

for Google much longer than 500 lag days since the model’s correlator has not
reached zero.
• In general, the combination of the values of η, λ determines where the model’s
minimum will lie. For the case of Google, the value of η = 0.40693 is the
lowest for the four securities and slows down the decay of the model’s exponential
exp{−ωz(t) cos(φ)} for the correlator D(0)
II (z(t)) given in Eq. 6.9.5; together with
λ = 0.20932 the model pushes out the minimum for Google past 500 lag days.
• The ﬁt for EURUSD in Figure 6.10(a) is the least accurate, due to two large
minima; the model can only generate a single minimum and hence the ﬁt is not
very good. The model can ﬁt the case of EURUSD for a maximum of 500 lag
days; this is because the value of the model’s correlator has reached zero; all
further values are also going to be zero.
• For the four securities, the model gives good results, as shown in Table 6.2, for
time time lags of up to 500 days. This is much longer than for commodities,
for which the model can usually give a good ﬁt for the auto-correlation function
for up to a maximum of 300 days’ time lag.
Results for varying time lag
• The parameters η, λ are ﬁxed for all four securities as there can be a case where
the same trader trades in all four securities. η, λ is ﬁxed using one of the securites.
• This leaves only two free parameters, γ , L, for ﬁtting the model to the remaining
three securities and leads to a drop in the accuracy of ﬁts. However, the ﬁts are
still remarkably good given that one has only two parameters to ﬁt the remaining
three securities.
• The parameters η, λ are ﬁxed by choosing their values to be given by the most
accurate ﬁt for Apple. The ﬁt is excellent for up to 500 days of time lag, and is
given by the earlier result as in Figure 6.9(a).
• The ﬁts for the three remaining securities are given in Figure 6.11. All three ﬁts
are excellent, but at the expense of reducing the time lag that can be ﬁtted by the
model. For example, the shorter time lag for EURUSD truncates the ﬁt before
the secondary minimum of the auto-correlation kicks in, and hence leads to an
improvement of the ﬁt.

The role of η, λ is indispensable in obtaining a good ﬁt, and this holds equally
well for all the commodities studied in the later section. The features of ﬁtting the
model to data that emerge for the case of equities and FX rates reappear for all the
other ﬁts, including ﬁtting the model to commodity prices. The discussion in this
section, in the context of equity and FX rate, is an example of how the model is
adjusted and varied to ﬁt market data, and in particular, these techniques will be
used to ﬁt commodity prices.
6.11 Single and multiple commodities ﬁt
There are two different procedures for doing the ﬁt for a given commodity: by using
the single commodity data or by doing a simultaneous ﬁt for multiple commodities,
which includes the calibration of the single commodity. The two procedures are
compared. The comparison ascertains how much the prices of other commodities
affect a given commodity’s prices. This comparison will verify that the multiple-
commodity prices are, in fact, a perturbation to the single commodity ﬁt of the
prices of a given commodity.
• A given commodity is calibrated using only the data for the given commodity.
This is denoted by S-commodity in Table 6.3.
• The same commodity is calibrated by doing a ﬁt for the commodities for all the
groups and maximizing the goodness of ﬁt for this collection of commodities,
including choosing the best value for the cross-correlation parameters ij. This
ﬁt is denoted by M-commodity in Table 6.3.
• In Table 6.3, Group A is a simultaneous ﬁt for three commodities, with two
commodities from metal and the other from energy. In Group B of Table 6.3, three
commodities from different groups, namely one from energy, one from metal and
one from food, are calibrated using our model.
• The single commodity ﬁt has an R2 above 0.94, whereas when the multiple com-
modity ﬁt is done, R2 is still good but now about 0.80.

Most of the parameters obtained from a single-commodity ﬁt and multiple-
commodity ﬁt are similar. The potential constants a, b, s, d given in Eq. 6.3.1,
as well as the market time parameters η, λ, change by about 10% in going from
the single- to the three-commodity ﬁt. This veriﬁes our intuition that the price
of a single commodity is mostly, up to 90%, determined by its own dynamics,
with the other commodities being a perturbation on its prices. Hence, while it is
true that single-commodity ﬁt is more accurate than the multiple ﬁt, the multiple-
commodity ﬁt contains the inﬂuence from other commodities and hence reﬂects
the market more accurately.
In conclusion, Table 6.3 shows that the statistical model for multiple commodi-
ties describes the market prices quite accurately with only a few parameters. The
result encoded in Table 6.3 further supports the basic premise of the model that the
multiple-commodity behavior of the market is a perturbation on the prices of single
commodities.
6.12 Empirical microeconomic potential
The complete calibration of the microeconomic Lagrangian for the different com-
modities yields the potentials directly in terms of the prices of the commodities.
Figure 6.12 shows the microeconomic potential of crude oil in terms of the three
variables y = (x −¯x)/σ(x), x = log(p/p0) and price p. The shape of the poten-
tial for all the commodities, as obtained by Baaquie et al. (2015), is similar to

the one shown in Figure 6.12(a), (b) and (c), with the potential being expressed,
respectively, in the normalized variable y, logarithm of price x and the market price
p. Potential similar to one found for commodities has also been discussed by Haven
and Khrennikov (2013). Note that the volatility of the commodity plays an impor-
tant role in determining the range of important ﬂuctuations for the commodities
price.
The shape of the potential is noteworthy: it has a wide, deep and almost ﬂat
minimum – which is unique – and then a sharp rise of the potential for both very
large and very small values of the price. The sharp rise is asymmetric, showing
that the buyers, who affect the potential for small values of the price, are driven
by considerations different from the potential for high prices – which affects the
sellers. One can speculate that the sharp rise in the potential is due to information
publicly available so that all market players – both buyers and sellers – know the
limits of what to expect for the equilibrium price.
The wide and deep valley around the minimum can be attributed to information
asymmetry: different market participants are privy to different amounts of informa-
tion about the price of the commodity and hence are not in agreement as to what
the equilibrium market price should be – and which determines the minimum of
the potential. This leads to a wide variation in the price the participants are willing
to trade, and is reﬂected in the wide and ﬂat values of the potential around the
minimum; and also leads to a larger volatility than otherwise, since a large volatility
is a consequence of a lack of precise information regarding the equilibrium price.
The kinetic and potential terms for commodity prices shows the central role
being played by the kinetic term. The kinetic terms are absent in the standard
treatments of microeconomic analysis of commodity prices – which are focused
(almost) solely on supply and demand. Of course, whether the kinetic term is, in
fact, important in the dynamics of commodity prices is an empirical question – and
which ﬁnds strong support in market data [Baaquie et al. (2015, 2016)].

6.13 Multiple commodities and market data
Recall the notation that the empirical correlators, evaluated from the data, are
denoted by GIJ and the results obtained by ﬁtting the model are denoted by
DIJ. The numbering for the indices I, J for the various commodities is given in
Table 6.4.
In Baaquie et al. (2016) 18 commodities are analyzed based on daily data
drawn for four major groups of commodities, given by energy, metal, food,
grain, from 1 January to 3 February 2015, and downloaded from www.investing
.com/commodities/real-time-futuresInvesting.com/commodities/real-time-futures.7
Since the correlators are symmetric, there are 171 correlators in total, with 18 auto-
correlation functions and 153 cross-correlation functions.
All the auto-correlation functions can be ﬁt to a high degree of accuracy and
conﬁrm the earlier results found in Baaquie et al. (2015) for single commodities.
The model can ﬁt the majority of the cross-correlators Gij(i ̸= j), which are
generically similar to the shape that the model generates from Eq. 6.5.8 and
are shown in Figure 6.3. Of the 153 cross-correlators, 110 are of the shape that
the model can ﬁt quite well. The rest of the cross-correlators Gij have features
that the model cannot ﬁt; in particular, if the cross-correlator has a local maximum
value at a time lag that is nonzero, then there are no choices of parameters for Gij
that can ﬁt the cross-correlator.
The ﬁtting is based on Eqs. 6.5.8 and 6.9.4:
GIJ(τ) = DIJ(z(τ)); I ̸= J

are given in Figure 6.13 for all the cross-correlators.
The ﬁtting of market correlator to the model is done in the following manner.

• Simultaneously ﬁt all the auto-correlation functions DII(z(t)) = DI(z(t)) with the
GI(t), as in Eq. 6.9.6, and evaluate the parameters ω, φ, η, λ. The value of η, λ
does not enter into the calibration of the other parameters.
• Using the values of ω, φ, as in Eq. 6.9.6, and the nonlinear terms given in
Eqs. 6.7.4, 6.5.10 and 6.5.11, L, ˜L, γ , α and β are evaluated.
• Use the parameters L, ˜L, γ , α and β as in Eqs. 6.4.5, 6.4.9, 6.4.10 and 6.4.11 and
ﬁnd [a, b, s, d].
• Evaluate the cross-correlation function DIJ; I ̸= J and determine IJ.
• The correlators are ﬁtted for a maximum time lag τ = 200 days.
Since the coupling of two commodities by IJ in the Lagrangian is not a sym-
metric function of I, J, Figure 6.13 shows the expected asymmetry. Commodity
prices are mostly positively correlated, with a few being negatively correlated.
The largest value of the cross-correlators is that of |6,17| = 0.1, which is the
correlation between the rough rice and cocoa group. Note the remarkable fact
that – ignoring this one value of the cross-correlator – the value of all the |IJ| <
0.08. The fact |IJ| < 0.08 provides strong evidence of the correctness of the
approach of considering the multiple-commodity model as a perturbation of the
single commodity prices, which requires |IJ| << 1.
Note that in extending the statistical model from single to N commodities,
N(N −1)/2 new parameters IJ are introduced, which in turn are ﬁxed by only a
single value of the cross-correlators GIJ(0), as given in Eq. 6.13.1.
For the statistical model, the entire dependence of GIJ(τ) on time lag τ > 0
is determined by the convolution of the auto-correlation functions D(0)
I (z(τ)) with
D(0)
J (z(τ)), as given in Eq. 6.5.8. The fact that the model can accurately describe
all the auto- and cross-correlators, up to N = 4 commodities, provides evidence for
the correctness of the model. The model can be extended to accurately describe
a collection of commodities with arbitrary N by introducing more terms in the
Lagrangian.
6.15 Fits for GII, GIJ
All the ﬁts of the model with data are carried out using the equations for the
correlation functions given in Eq. 6.5.8. All auto-correlators are normalized such
that GII(0) = DII(0) = 1. However, for displaying the results clearly, the entire
auto-correlator is rescaled – sometimes by scaling GII(0) > 1 or by GII(0) < 1 –
so that the results for the different commodities being compared start at the same
value but later do not overlap and hence can be viewed clearly. The analysis of up
to three commodities is discussed in this section, with results of simultaneously
analyzing up to six commodities given by Baaquie et al. (2016).

The results for the three commodities ﬁt is shown in Table 6.9 and Figure 6.18.
The R2 of the three-commodity ﬁts are normally between 0.8 and 1. Although
they are not quite high, the values are high enough to be convincing, as shown in
Figure 6.18. The ﬁt for up to six commodities is at the limit of the model’s efﬁcacy
and is discussed by Baaquie et al. (2016).
6.16 Summary
The theory of asset prices needs to explain the behavior of all assets, including
their cross-correlations: an action functional based on a statistical model of prices
needs to provide such a description. The study of multiple commodities provides

empirical evidence supporting the approach of statistical modeling of asset prices.
The ﬁts have R2 ≈0.8 for up to three commodities, which is reasonable but not
excellent.
The introduction of the microeconomic potential is fundamental to the action
functional model of asset prices. The potential, from Eq. 6.4.6, has the following
expansion:

One can see the model is insensitive to the full range of the potential for the cases
studied. One needs to have a microeconomic potential that has a minimum to ensure
an equilibrium price. Only three terms from the exponential supply and demand
enter into the calibration, given by
die−aiyi + siebiyi ≃di + si + γi
2 y2
i + αi
3!y3

However, for a discontinuous change of prices, the full range of the potential func-
tion becomes important. For example, the price of wheat had a sudden increase,
shown in Figure 6.19, and can be interpreted as a tunneling event. The full range of
the potential, including the double well as shown in Figure 6.1(b), is required for
the tunneling to take place.
One of the main empirical results of this chapter is that the model can ﬁt a
wide class of ﬁnancial assets, including equities, FX rates and commodities. It is

shown that the market of single commodities can be viewed as being partially
complete, with other commodities affecting the price of any given commodity only
perturbatively, with correlation terms contributing less than 10% to the price of
a single commodity. This result provides an explanation for the excellent results
obtained for the stand-alone single commodities, as was obtained by Baaquie et al.
(2015). One expects a similar conclusion for the price of shares as well as for the
FX rates.
A minimal extension of the single asset action was made using the term ijyiyj,
motivated by the need to preserve the accurate results for the single assets; for the
case of commodities, the ij term is sufﬁcient to simultaneously describe up to
four commodities with reasonable accuracy. One can improve the accuracy of the
model by including cubic, quartic and higher order terms of prices such as ijkyiyjyk
involving different assets. This would make the calibration more difﬁcult, but would
have the advantage of being able to accurately ﬁt a large number of assets.
Empirical studies place the statistical microeconomic theory of prices on a ﬁrm
footing. The signiﬁcance of the various terms in the action functional for the func-
tioning of the underlying economy needs further study. A logical place to start is
to study the formation of market prices [Roehner (2002b)]. An economic principle
is required to explain the modeling of prices using the microeconomic potential
and the kinetic term. One needs to ﬁnd, for instance, reasons – grounded on an
economic principle – that explain why the microeconomic potential supersedes the
independent modeling of supply and demand.
For the microeconomic kinetic term, one possible explanation is that it models
the processes of exchange and circulation. In particular, the parameters L, ˜L could
be determined for an asset by the market liquidity and turnover of the asset in
question. A fundamental underlying socio-politico-economic principle is required
that uniﬁes production, circulation, distribution, exchange and consumption. The

principle should provide a theoretical explanation as well as a derivation of the
microeconomic action functional A for both spot and futures prices.

Linear quantum ﬁelds

Scalar quantum ﬁeld
7.1 Introduction
The concept of a quantum ﬁeld is introduced starting with linear quantum ﬁelds.
The mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory, originating in the synthesis and fusion of
the quantum principle with classical ﬁeld theory, deﬁnes a mathematical system that
is the main focus of this book. A quantum ﬁeld is a mathematical system consisting
of inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom. Furthermore, a quantum ﬁeld is
an indeterminate ﬁeld, deﬁned on a given manifold, and is equivalent to set of all
possible conﬁgurations of the classical ﬁeld.
Free quantum ﬁeld theories, based on a quadratic Lagrangian, are linear and
equivalent to an inﬁnite collection of decoupled quantum harmonic oscillators.
There are only a few new features in the free ﬁeld over and above quantum mechan-
ics. Although there are interesting questions like causality, antiparticles and gauge
ﬁxing that one can study for free ﬁelds, viewed from the point of functional inte-
gration, free ﬁelds are essentially a collection of inﬁnitely many decoupled degrees
of freedom. The decoupled degrees of freedom can be solved, one by one, and
consist of a ﬁnite collection of independent variables. Although this may sound
like a retreat from the general case where all the degrees of freedom are coupled, it
is logical to start from the case of free ﬁelds for a number of reasons.
• Free ﬁelds are linear since their ﬁeld equations are linear. All free ﬁelds are
described by Lagrangians that are quadratic functions of the underlying degrees of
freedom. In the path integral formalism, all free ﬁelds are described by Gaussian
path integration.
• Free ﬁelds have quadratic Hamiltonians and hence can be mapped to an under-
lying oscillator algebra, leading to great simpliﬁcations. In particular, one can
introduce creation and destruction operators for obtaining all the excitations of
the free quantum ﬁeld.
149

150
Scalar quantum ﬁeld
• Free quantum ﬁelds can be solved exactly, in the sense that all the expressions for
quantities of interest can be obtained explicitly, using either the oscillator algebra
or Gaussian integration.
• A fruitful approach to the study of weakly coupled nonlinear quantum ﬁelds is
to start from the limit of a free quantum ﬁeld when the couplings are equal
to zero, and then obtain the properties of the nonlinear quantum ﬁeld. This is
the approach of using Feynman perturbation theory and Feynman diagrams, for
which the fundamental ingredient is the underlying free ﬁeld.
• The bulk of the discussion on nonlinear quantum ﬁelds in Part III is based on
Feynman perturbation expansions around the properties of the free scalar ﬁeld.
• The utility of the creation and destruction operators in the study of quantum ﬁelds
is illustrated by using the example of free ﬁelds. Furthermore, the free quantum
ﬁeld is analyzed in Minkowski spacetime to examine its relativistic structure –
and in particular to verify that it fulﬁlls the requirement of causality.
• The Euclidean continuation of the Minkowski theory is discussed and the path
integral for the scalar ﬁeld is deﬁned for the Euclidean ﬁeld. The continuation
of Minkowski to Euclidean quantum ﬁelds is introduced and is of fundamental
importance since almost all the derivations in this book are based on Euclidean
quantum ﬁelds.
• The Fourier transform is introduced to decouple the inﬁnitely many degrees of
freedom, since this technique, appropriately generalized, applies to all free ﬁelds.
The Heisenberg operator equations for the scalar quantum ﬁeld are studied as are
the various commutators.
7.2 Two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld
A quantum ﬁeld, similar to all quantum systems, is based on underlying degrees of
freedom. Consider an inﬁnite collection of real variables {xp: p = 0, ±1, . . . , ±∞};
this collection, taken together, constitutes the underlying degrees of freedom on
which the quantum ﬁeld is built. The quantum ﬁeld is two dimensional since one
of the dimensions is labeled by the index p, which is discrete in the case being
considered but is a continuous index for spacetime theories; the second dimension
is that of time. The four-dimensional generalization of the results of this section are
given in Section 7.8.
One of the deﬁning properties of a quantum ﬁeld that distinguishes it from
quantum mechanics – which is a system with a ﬁxed and ﬁnite number of degrees of
freedom – is that the quantum ﬁeld has inﬁnitely many independent (and in general
coupled) degrees of freedom.
The state space V is the ﬁrst structure that is connected to the degrees of freedom,
as the state space is a complete description of all the allowed (and observable)

7.3 Fock space
151
states of the degrees of freedom. Only after the state space is constructed can the
Hamiltonian be deﬁned – since it is an operator on the state space. The state space
and Hamiltonian, taken together, deﬁne the Lagrangian and path integral for the
degrees of freedom.
In sum, the four ingredients of a quantum ﬁeld are the following.
• State space
• Hamiltonian
• Lagragian
• Path integral.
7.3 Fock space
The state space of a quantum ﬁeld is a Hilbert space with inﬁnitely many indepen-
dent degrees of freedom. The state space is described by a complete set of basis
states; one such complete set is provided by an inﬁnite collection of independent
creation and destruction operators constructed from the underlying degrees of free-
dom. The Hilbert space of a quantum ﬁeld in the oscillator basis is called a Fock
space. The oscillator basis is most useful for describing a free ﬁeld, or systems that
are perturbations on a free ﬁeld, since the oscillator basis states are also eigenstates
of the free ﬁeld Hamiltonian.
Fock space can be used to describe the behavior of any quantum ﬁeld; however,
there are other descriptions of the quantum ﬁeld’s state space that are equally valid.
The most appropriate choice for a basis of the state space depends on the system
one is interested in.
It is important to note that Fock space is not tied to any dynamics, which is
described by a Hamiltonian. Instead, Fock space is a kinematical construct and
is the space in which the quantum system exists. The evolution of the quantum
system, including that of a quantum ﬁeld, charts out a trajectory in Fock space
[Baaquie (2013b)].

The labels pℓ, qℓ, . . . are the indices for a speciﬁc degree of freedom and its
associated state space. It will be seen in Section 13.5, where a more detailed
analysis is required of the quantum ﬁeld’s state space, that the three-dimensional
“momenta” are indices for the distinct degrees of freedom for the four-dimensional
quantum ﬁeld.
The interpretation of the state vector |⟩is that |d0|2 is the probability that all
the oscillators have no excitation; |dqn|2 is the probability that the qth degree of

of the state vector is one for which the state vector |0⟩is not an entangled state,
but instead is a tensor product of the individual state space, with no coupling of the
state vectors of the different degrees of freedom. The tensor product state of the
separate degrees of freedom is given by

Noteworthy 7.1 Fock state space
Consider two degrees of freedom x1, x2. The Hilbert state space has a representation
given by the tensor product of the two underlying Hilbert spaces V(x1), V(x2) and

154
Scalar quantum ﬁeld
V = V(x1) ⊗V(x2); the state vector is given by all functions ψ(x1, x2) ∈V
such that

dx1dx2|ψ(x1, x2)|2 = 1
|ψ⟩has another representation in the oscillator basis; using the completeness equa-
tion for the oscillator basis

ψ(n1, n2)|n1, n2⟩
Note the sum over n1, n2 starts from 1 because these are all states above the ground
state |0⟩; starting the sum from 0 would overcount the contribution of the ground
state.
The result above shows that one can write |ψ⟩in terms of basis states that are
based on the following representation of the state space:
V = V0 ⊕V1 ⊕V2
(7.3.6)
where
V0: linear span of |0, 0⟩; V1: linear span of {|0, n⟩, |n, 0⟩}; V2: linear span of |n, m⟩
The generalization of Eq. 7.3.6 for a one-dimensional quantum ﬁeld is given by the
Fock space representation
V =
+∞

ℓ=0
⊕Vℓ; V0 = |0⟩⟨0|
(7.3.7)
The expansion of the state vector given in Eq. 7.3.2 is based on the represen-
tation of V given in Eq. 7.3.7. The interpretation of Vℓis that it is the space
having ℓ“momentum” given by p1, . . . , pℓ, and which is the linear span of
|n1, q1; n2, q2; . . . ; nℓ, qℓ⟩for all of the excitations of n1, . . . , nℓ= 1, . . . , ∞. One
recovers the result in Eq. 7.3.6 for ℓ= 2. In other words, Vℓis the state space
that has ℓnumber of particles with momentum {p1, . . . , pℓ}, with the particle with
momentum pℓbeing in the nℓexcited state.
The Fock space for a d-dimensional quantum ﬁeld is a straightforward gener-
alization of the two-dimensional case. The single integer p is replaced by a d −
1-dimensional vector ⃗p, with each component of the vector having a Fock space
identical to the one being discussed. The Fock space for the d-dimensional case is

a continuous tensor product over the Fock space for each component of the vector
⃗p, and yields the following:

In conclusion, x(t, σ) is a two-dimensional free scalar quantum ﬁeld that con-
sists, at each instant of time, of inﬁnitely many independent degrees of freedom.
The main takeaway from this section is that a free quantum ﬁeld is equivalent to
a collection of inﬁnitely many decoupled harmonic oscillators. The collection of
inﬁnitely many variables is naturally organized in the form of functional calculus,
which includes functional differentiation and functional integration.
To render the quantum ﬁeld nonlinear, one needs to include nonlinear terms in
the Lagrangian. An important example is to add a |x(t, σ)|4 term, which yields

new features absent in quantum mechanics, and is discussed in later chapters on
nonlinear quantum ﬁelds.

The deﬁnition of canonical momentum π given in Eq. 7.4.1 is consistent with the
one given above in Eq. 7.4.5 since, in the Hamiltonian representation, all time-
dependent operators are considered to be Heisenberg operators. The consistency of
Eqs. 7.4.1 and 7.4.5 will become more clear in Section 7.5.
Eq. 7.4.5 yields the canonical commutation equations
[ϕ(⃗x), π(⃗x′)] = i δϕ(⃗x)

detailed derivation is given of the Heisenberg evolution equation. For Minkowski
time, the Heisenberg ﬁeld operator obeys
ϕ(t, ⃗x) = eitHϕ(⃗x)e−itH

and hence
∂ϕ(t, ⃗x)
∂t
= −i[ϕ(t, ⃗x), H]
(7.5.2)

Scalar quantum ﬁeld
Similarly, the time evolution of the canonical momentum is given by
∂π(t, ⃗x)

(7.5.3)
The operator realization of the canonical momentum that yields the canonical
commutation equations is

δϕ(⃗x)
Consider the Heisenberg operator equation:
∂ϕt,⃗x
∂t
= −i[ϕt,⃗x, H] = −ieitH[ϕ⃗x, H]e−itH
(7.5.4)
For the free ﬁeld Hamiltonian given in Eq. 7.4.4, the only nonzero term in the
commutator above is
[ϕ⃗x, H] = 1
2

⃗x′[π2
⃗x′, ϕ⃗x]
Note
[AB, C] = [A, C]B + A[B, C]
and this yields

(7.5.5)
Note ∂ϕ/∂t = π is the result expected from the classical deﬁnition of the canonical

5 The same symbol ϕ(t, ⃗x) is used for denoting two different objects: (1) in the path integral and Lagrangian,
ϕ(t, ⃗x) is an integration variable for each t, ⃗x; (2) the time-dependent Heisenberg ﬁeld operators are also denoted
by ϕ(t, ⃗x). From the context it will be clear what is intended. The two objects are closely related and this fact is
brought out in Section 13.2.

The classical ﬁeld equations, for the free scalar ﬁeld, appear as the operator
equations for the Heisenberg ﬁeld operators. The analogy with the classical ﬁeld
equation breaks down for nonlinear quantum ﬁelds due to the requirement of ren-
dering such ﬁeld theories ﬁnite using the procedure of renormalization.

7.8 Energy eigenstates
The scalar ﬁeld is equivalent to a inﬁnite set of decoupled simple harmonic oscil-
lators. Hence, similar to the case of the harmonic oscillators, the state space for
the scalar ﬁeld is generated by acting on the vacuum state with the creation opera-
tors. This section generalizes the result obtained for two -dimensional spacetime in
Section 7.2 to four dimensions.
The vacuum state, for all ⃗p, is given by
a⃗p|0⟩= 0 ⇒⟨0|0⟩= 1
Furthermore, from Eqs. 7.7.1 and 7.7.3,
H(a†
⃗p|0⟩) = (a†

⃗p)|0⟩= (E⃗p + E0)a†

Scalar quantum ﬁeld
Since [a†

two particles; this is a reﬂection of the fact that ϕ(t, ⃗x) is a bosonic scalar ﬁeld.

7.10 Unequal time commutation equations
Spacetime properties are encoded in the light cone, as shown in Figure 7.1. The
scalar ﬁeld in Minkowski space is investigated to study interplay of a quantum
ﬁeld with the structure of spacetime, and in particular whether a quantum ﬁeld is
consistent with causality.
One expects that for two space time points with space-like separation, the scalar
quantum ﬁeld at these two points should commute – as observations can be made
at space-like separation that are causally independent. In fact, it is the commutator
of the ﬁelds that vanishes for two space-like points, since all observations ﬁnally
require the commutator of the ﬁeld with the observable operator.

There is a nonzero amplitude for the operator product for space-like separation.
Does this violate causality?
It is expected that the commutator of physical observables is zero for space-like
separation since these operators should be simultaneously diagonalizable. Hence,
for Hermitian physical operators ˆO(x), special relativity requires that for space-like
separation
[ ˆO(x), ˆO(y)] = 0, (x −y)2 < 0
Recall
⟨0|[ϕ(x), ϕ(y)]|0⟩= (x −y) −(y −x)
(7.10.4)
If x, y have a space-like separation, that is (x −y)2 < 0, then we expect the
coordinate operator of the ﬁeld to be simultaneously observable, which in turn
requires
⟨0|[ϕ(x), ϕ(y)]|0⟩= (x −y) −(y −x) = 0:
x, y: Space-like (7.10.5)
If x, y are space-like, a Lorentz transformation takes (x −y) →−(x −y). Hence to
prove
[ϕ(x), ϕ(y)] = 0:
(x −y)2 < 0
one needs to show that (x) is Lorentz invariant; it then follows that (x) =
(x), where  is Lorentz transformation.
Deﬁne the function

7.11 The Feynman propagator
A fundamental feature of quantum ﬁelds is the Feynman propagator, which is the
amplitude of an excitation propagating from one spacetime point to another. The
Feynman propagator is deﬁned by
D(x, y) =
 (x −y),
x0 > y0
(y −x),
x0 < y0
(7.11.1)
and is written as
D(x −y) = θ(x0 −y0)(x −y) + θ(y0 −x0)(y −x)

7.11 The Feynman propagator
173
The propagator is an even function:
D(x −y) = D(y −x)
This deﬁnition takes into account relativistic causality as well as the fact that there
is an underlying Hamiltonian propagating the ﬁeld. The deﬁnition of (x−y) yields
the following:
D(x −y) = θ(x0 −y0)⟨0|ϕ(x)ϕ(y)|0⟩+ θ(y0 −x0)⟨0|ϕ(y)ϕ(x)|0⟩
≡⟨0|T{ϕ(x)ϕ(y)}|0⟩
T stands for the operation of time ordering the product of (noncommuting) opera-
tors deﬁned by placing the operators at earlier time to the right:
T[ϕ(ti, ⃗xi) · · · ϕ(tj, ⃗xj)] = ϕ(t1, ⃗xi) · · · ϕ(tN, ⃗xN); t1 > t2 · · · > tN

that is nonzero only in the future. Namely
DR(x −y) = θ(x0 −y0)⟨0|[ϕ(x), ϕ(y)]|0⟩= θ(x0 −y0){(x −y) −(y −x)}

7.12 Complex scalar ﬁeld
The complex scalar ﬁeld ϕ consists of a scalar particle together with its antiparticle.
A complex scalar ﬁeld carries charge and hence can couple to a gauge ﬁeld. In
contrast, a real scalar ﬁeld has zero charge and cannot have any coupling to a gauge
ﬁeld. The particle and antiparticle interpretation is valid only if both the underlying
real scalar ﬁelds have exactly the same mass m; otherwise, the interpretation fails.
In terms of the complex ﬁeld ϕ, the Lagrangian is given by
L = ∂μϕ∗∂μϕ −m2ϕ∗ϕ
where m is the mass of the complex scalar ﬁeld.
A complex scalar ﬁeld consists of two real scalar ﬁelds ϕ1, ϕ2 and is deﬁned by
ϕ(x) =
1
√
2
[ϕ1(x) + iϕ2(x)]
The Hermitian conjugation is given by
ϕ†(x) =

[ϕ1(x) −iϕ2(x)] ̸= ϕ(x)
Using the real component ﬁeld representation yields the Lagrangian
L =


i=1

Note that both the ﬁelds ϕ1, ϕ2 have the same mass m, and this is the basis of
identifying the complex scalar ﬁeld as consisting of a particle and antiparticle, since
a necessary requirement for a particle–antiparticle pair is that their masses must be
exactly equal.

The state space for the complex ﬁeld ϕ is
Vϕ = VA ⊗VB
where VA and VB are a state spaces isomorphic to the state space of a real scalar
ﬁeld.
In terms of the state space Vϕ, the creation and destruction operators have the
following representation:

⃗p1 = a†

⃗k creates an antiparticle state with the
opposite charge.
7.12.1 Charge conjugation
The complex ﬁeld scalar consists of two charged scalar particles that are particles
and antiparticles of each other, with the particle carrying a positive charge and the
antiparticle carrying a negative charge. This property of the complex scalar ﬁeld is
brought out by the charge conjugation operator, which interchanges particle with
antiparticle.
Charge conjugation is a unitary operator C that is deﬁned as follows:
CϕC† = ηϕ†; Cϕ†C† = η∗ϕ; |η|2 = 1
Repeating the transformation twice yields the following:
CC† = I ⇒C2 = I
The Fourier expansion given in Eqs. 7.12.1 and 7.12.2 yields the expected result:
CA⃗kC† = ηB⃗k; CB†
⃗kC† = ηA†
⃗k
(7.12.5)
Since charge conjugation interchanges particle with antiparticle, the charge oper-
ator for the complex scalar ﬁeld must also change its sign from plus to minus. A
straightforward calculation shows that under charge conjugation, the transformation
yields the expected result given by
CQC† = −Q
For a free complex scalar ﬁeld, there is no coupling to charge, but in the presence
of a gauge ﬁeld, the charge allows the complex scalar ﬁeld to be coupled to the
gauge ﬁeld. A ﬁeld theory that is symmetric under charge conjugation does not
have any invariant distinction between particle and antiparticle.
7.13 Free scalar ﬁeld: Path integral
To rigorously deﬁne the functional integral, spacetime has to be discretized into a
ﬁnite lattice, with the total number of lattice sites being ﬁnite and equal to Nd. The
Feynman path integral then is reduced to a ﬁnite-dimensional multiple integral.
Instead of using the lattice formulation, a heuristic deviation is given of a result that
can be obtained rigorously based on a lattice spacetime.

180
Scalar quantum ﬁeld
The path integral and correlation functions of the free ﬁeld are studied in
this section. The analytic continuation of the quantum ﬁeld from Minkowski to
Euclidean time is deﬁned. One of the most important correlation functions, which
is the expectation value of product of two ﬁelds at different spacetime points – also
known as the Feynman propagator – is analyzed in both Minkowski and Euclidean
spacetime.
The Feynman path integral for the scalar quantum ﬁeld is given by

with the Lagrangian for the free scalar quantum ﬁeld given by
L = 1
2∂μϕ∂μϕ −1
2m2ϕ2 + jϕ
The external current j(x) is a classical function and is introduced so that the gener-
ating functional for the free ﬁeld can be evaluated. Since S is quadratic functional
of the quantum ﬁeld, Gaussian integration is sufﬁcient to perform the functional
integral.
To diagonalize the action, deﬁne the Fourier transform:

7.14 Continuation to Euclidean time
To make the path integral a rigorously deﬁned expression, one analytically
continues from Minkowski time to Euclidean time.
Let Euclidean coordinates and momentum be given by
xE = (xE
0, xE
i ) = (τ, xE
i ); pE = (pE
0, pE
i )
Minkowski coordinates and momentum xμ, pμ are analytically continued to
Euclidean space by the following:9
x0 = x0 = −ixE
0 = −iτ, xi = xE
i
p0 = p0 = ipE
0,
−pi = pi = pE

(7.14.1)
9 The continuation of Minkowski to Euclidean momentum is a result that follows from the deﬁnition of canonical
momentum in Hamiltonian mechanics – and is discussed by Baaquie (2014).

given in Figure 7.3(a) and (b), respectively. Note that the direction of rotation of
the time x0 and momentum p0 axis is deﬁned unambiguously by the regularization
of the functional integral given in Eq. 7.13.1. The time axis rotates through −π/2 to
avoid crossing the singularity in the contour integral, as shown in Figure 7.3(a) and
the energy axis E = p0 rotates through +π/2, as shown in Figure 7.3(b). Hence,
one has the following deformation of the spacetime and four-momentum contour
integrals.

7.15 Summary
Many of the key ideas of quantum ﬁelds have been addressed in the context of a free
scalar ﬁeld. The more complex quantum ﬁelds all have the underlying properties of
a scalar ﬁeld, with many additional features that do not appear for the scalar ﬁeld –
and hence its relative simplicity.
The construction of the Fock basis for state space has great generality and pro-
vides a clear representation of the state space of a quantum ﬁeld.
The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian for a scalar ﬁeld were studied in great detail.
The ﬁeld operator’s decomposition into annihilation and creation operators is valid
for any linear quantum ﬁeld; the scalar ﬁeld provides the template for a similar
decomposition, but with many new and complicating features, of the Dirac and
photon ﬁeld.
The commutation equations of the scalar ﬁeld, and their relation to causality and
to the structure of spacetime, are valid for the more complex quantum ﬁelds, and
yield an insight to the workings of a quantum ﬁeld in general.
The Feynman propagator forms the backbone of all perturbation theory required
for nonlinear ﬁelds, and its derivation for the case of the free ﬁeld foregrounds its

appearance later on. The complex scalar ﬁeld provides a representation of antipar-
ticles that exempliﬁes how particle–antiparticle symmetry is realized in quantum
ﬁelds.
The Feynman path integral was introduced for the free scalar ﬁeld and is the
foundation for most of the derivations and modeling in all the other chapters.
Almost all chapters study Euclidean quantum ﬁelds; the continuation from
Minkowski to Euclidean space was carefully studied and it was shown that the
continuation preserves all the information. Given that Euclidean quantum ﬁelds are
more rigorously deﬁned, it is always preferable to study the Euclidean version.

Dirac spinor ﬁeld
8.1 Introduction
The Dirac equation was obtained in 1928 by P. A. M. Dirac with objective of
obtaining a relativistic version of the Schrodinger equation. What Dirac discovered,
instead, was a relativistic ﬁeld equation for a new type of particle, namely, relativis-
tic fermions – which includes the electron as its most well-known example. The
relativistic electron is a spinor ﬁeld, carrying spin and constituted by an electron
and its antielectron [Dirac (1999)].
The Dirac equation is the ﬁeld equation for a spinor ﬁeld and is analogous to
the Maxwell equation, which governs the classical behavior of the (relativistic)
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Freeman Dyson once said about Dirac, “His discoveries were
like exquisitely carved statues falling out of the sky, one after another. He seemed
to be able to conjure laws of nature from pure thought.”
The Dirac equation predicts that relativistic particles come in pairs of a particle
and its antiparticle; the antiparticle is as physical and fundamental as is its particle.
In particular, the Dirac equation predicts that the electron is a spin half particle that
comes together with a companion spin half antielectron with exactly the same mass,
called the positron. The existence of an antiparticle was, at that time, completely
unknown and beyond the concepts known to physics. The discovery of the anti-
electron in 1932 by Carl Anderson is considered to be one of the greatest triumphs
of modern theoretical physics. Since the antiparticle is a salient and outstanding
feature of the Dirac equation, the main focus of this chapter is to explicate the
speciﬁc features of the antiparticle and its relation to the corresponding particle.
The canonical formulation of the Dirac equation is discussed in this chapter and
many standard results are derived. Spacetime is taken to be a four-dimensional
Minkowski manifold, unlike in most of the other chapters where spacetime is taken
to be a Euclidean manifold. There are two reasons for this. First, since the path
integral is not discussed, there is no particular advantage in going to Euclidean time.

Second, using Minkowski spacetime allows one to introduce Minkowski Dirac
gamma matrices, which in turn allow the reader to connect with the vast literature
on the Dirac equation that almost always uses the Minkowski formulation.

ψ(t, ⃗x) = 0
The natural length ¯h/mc that enters the wave equation, consistent with relativity
and quantum mechanics, is called the Compton wavelength. For an electron with
mass me it is given by1
¯h
mec = 2.426 × 10−12 meters: Electron’s Compton wavelength
The scale of the Compton wavelength is much smaller than the typical size of
an atom, which is about 10−10 meters. Hence, one expects that a relativistic and
quantum mechanical particle, since it is much smaller than the atom, is a candidate
for being a fundamental particle; in fact, the leading example of a fundamental
particle is the (relativistic) electron.
In covariant notation, the covariant equation is given by

¯h2∂μ∂μ + m2c2.
ψ(x) = 0
(8.2.1)
where, for four vectors Aμ, Bμ, with μ = 0, 1, 2, 3, one has
xμ = (ct, ⃗x); AμBμ ≡AμBνημν; ημν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1) = ημν
Dirac felt that the second-order time derivative ∂2/∂t2 in the relativistic wave equa-
tion spoils the main mathematical beauty of the Schr¨odinger equation – which in
Dirac’s view is that it has only a ﬁrst-order time derivative. To address this issue,
Dirac chose to factor the wave operator in the following manner:
¯h2∂μ∂μ + m2c2 =

+i¯hγμ∂μ + mc
. 
−i¯hγμ∂μ + mc
.
(8.2.2)
The quantities γμ are not real numbers but are, instead, 4×4 matrices with the
following property:
γμγν + γνγμ ≡{γμ, γν} = 2ημν
1 Currently, the measured size of the electron shows its radius to be less than 2.82 × 10−15 m. According to the
Dirac equation, the electron is point-like, having zero radius.

8.2 Dirac equation

There are inﬁnitely many equivalent representations of the Dirac matrices. A rep-
resentation particularly suited for studying the Hilbert space of the Dirac ﬁeld is, in
block 2×2 notation, the following:
⃗γ =

Hence, from the right-hand side of Eq. 8.2.2

= ¯h2ημν∂μ∂ν + m2c2 = ¯h2∂μ∂μ + m2c2
and one has recovered the left-hand side of Eq. 8.2.2.
The function ψ(t, ⃗x) given in Eq. 8.2.1 is seen, from Eq. 8.2.2, to satisfy the
following:

−i¯hγμ∂μ + mc

ψ(t, ⃗x) = 0:

(8.2.5)
The Dirac equation is not a relativistic Schr¨odinger equation since the Dirac ﬁeld
ψ(t, ⃗x) is not a probability amplitude. Instead, the Dirac equation is a fundamen-
tal ﬁeld equation that describes electrons and positrons – analogous to the ﬁeld
equation for the Klein–Gordon scalar ﬁeld and the Maxwell’s ﬁeld equation for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld Aμ(t, ⃗x).
The Dirac ﬁeld has four components, given by ψα(t, ⃗x), α = 1, . . . , 4. Every
electron has spin 1/2 and hence needs two independent ﬁeld components for its
description; its antiparticle, namely the positron, is also spin 1/2 and needs another
two independent ﬁeld components. Hence, as expected, a Dirac ﬁeld ψα(t, ⃗x), at
each spacetime point, has in total four degrees of freedom and is described by a
four-component complex ﬁeld.
Furthermore, a spin 1/2 ﬁeld describes fermions obeying the Pauli exclusion
principle, which states that two fermions cannot be in the same quantum state.
In case of the Dirac ﬁeld, the exclusion principle states that two electrons cannot

190

occupy the same spacetime point; to fulﬁll the exclusion principle, the Dirac ﬁeld
ψ(t, ⃗x) is an anticommuting fermionic ﬁeld variable – in contrast to the scalar φ(t, ⃗x)
and electromagnetic ﬁeld Aμ(t, ⃗x), which are described by bosonic commuting ﬁeld
variables. Deﬁning the anticommutator by
{A, B} = AB + BA
the anticommutators of the Dirac ﬁeld are given by the following:
{ψα(t, ⃗x), ψβ(t′, ⃗x′)} = 0 = { ¯ψα(t, ⃗x), ¯ψβ(t′, ⃗x′)} = 0 = {ψα(t, ⃗x), ¯ψβ(t′, ⃗x′)}
In the path integral formulation of the Dirac ﬁeld, fermion integration is deﬁned
and the path integral is given by considering the Dirac ﬁeld to be a collection of
fermion integration variables [Baaquie (2014)].
8.3 Dirac Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
The Dirac Lagrangian can be obtained from the Dirac equation. The Dirac equation
given in Eq. 8.2.4 can be considered to be the result of varying a classical action.
Considering ¯ψ and ψ to be independent ﬁelds, the Lagrangian L( ¯ψ, ψ) is deﬁned
via the ﬁeld equation2

which yields
L = −¯ψ(−iγμ∂μ + m)ψ = ¯ψ(iγμ∂μ −m)ψ
(8.3.1)
The negative sign for the Dirac Lagrangian is taken to be consistent the rules of
fermion Gaussian integration given in Section 9.14.1. The Dirac action is given by
S =

ddxL =

ddx ¯ψ(iγμ∂μ −m)ψ
(8.3.2)
The Dirac Hamiltonian is obtained in a manner similar to the bosonic case using
the procedure of Lagrangian mechanics. Consider a boson degree of freedom q with
Lagrangian given by
L = 1
2 ˙q2 −V(q)
The canonical momentum p and Hamiltonian H for the system are deﬁned by
p = ∂L
∂˙q = m˙q; H = ˙qp −L = 1
2 ˙q2 + V(q)
2 The rules of fermion calculus are discussed in detail in Baaquie (2014); in this chapter minimal use is made of
fermion calculus, so an intuitive understanding will be sufﬁcient.

α = δL

(8.3.3)
where the anticommuting property of the Dirac ﬁeld has been used to obtain α.
Deﬁne the conjugate ﬁeld by
ψ† ≡¯ψγ0
The Dirac Hamiltonian density, using the anticommuting property of the Dirac
ﬁeld, is given by
H(⃗x) = ∂ψα
∂t α −L = ψ†(iγ0 ⃗γ · ⃗∂+ mγ0)ψ
⇒H(⃗x) = ψ†(−i⃗α · ⃗∂+ βm)ψ

In the canonical formalism, to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian density from the
Lagrangian, the only change is to remove the time derivative term from the Dirac
Lagrangian and reverse the sign of the remaining term. The canonical formalism
reﬂects the fact that the time derivative term in the Dirac Lagrangian is due to the
fermionic Hilbert space and is not a part of the Hamiltonian. A similar dropping of
the time derivative term was required for obtaining the transfer matrix for a simpler
fermionic case, discussed in Baaquie (2014).
The Dirac Lagrangian is written in phase space variables and is analogous to the
formulation of bosonic system in phase space, with a derivation given in Baaquie
(2014).
The Hamiltonian for the Dirac ﬁeld is given by
H =

d3xH(⃗x) =

where the matrix h is given by
h = iγ0 ⃗γ · ⃗∂+ γ0m = −i⃗α · ⃗∂+ βm
(8.3.5)
The ﬁelds ψ†(⃗x), ψ(⃗x) are considered to be time-independent Schr¨odinger opera-
tors. To quantize the Dirac Hamiltonian given in Eq. 8.3.4, the matrix h has to be
diagonalized so that one can ascertain the creation and destruction operators for
H. To quantize H canonical anticommutation relations are imposed on the normal
modes of the Dirac ﬁeld.

8.4 Euclidean Dirac Lagrangian
The formulation of the Dirac ﬁeld in Euclidean time is more suitable for studies
based on the path integral and for studying the lattice Dirac ﬁeld. The Euclidean for-
mulation is brieﬂy outlined. Let τ denote Euclidean time and γ E
μ denote Euclidean
gamma matrices. Deﬁne

8.5 Plane wave solutions
To diagonalize the matrix h given in Eq. 8.3.5, its eigenstates have to be computed.
Similar to noninteracting bosonic systems, the Dirac equation also has plane waves
as eigenstates. Due to the particle and antiparticle content of the Dirac ﬁeld, and
the fact that they both have spin 1/2, the plane wave solutions are four-dimensional
column vectors.
The eigenstates of h have the form
u(⃗p)ei⃗p·⃗x
where
hu(⃗p) = (⃗α · ⃗p + mβ)u(⃗p) = Eu(⃗p)

The positive and negative energy plane wave solutions can be obtained by the
following procedure. Deﬁne
u±(⃗p) = (h ± ω)u0
Then
hu+(⃗p) = (h2 + ωh)u0 = ω(ω + h)u0 = ωu+(⃗p) ⇒E = ω
Similarly
hu−(⃗p) = (h2 −ωh)u0 = ω(ω −h)u0 = −ωu−(⃗p) ⇒E = −ω
(h ± ω)u0 yields eight eigenstates, of which only four are linearly independent.
Two eigenstates are taken with positive energy E = +ω and another two with
negative energy E = −ω.

8.6 Quantization

Note that the four eigenvectors are orthogonal, namely
⟨u(i)|u(j)⟩∼δi−j; i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4
Two different normalization are commonly used for the u(i)(⃗p).

In summary, for |E| = ω > 0, taking V =

for the system with normalization N2 one obtains the eigenfunctions of the h matrix
as follows:

For V →∞, the allowed spectrum for E2 is given by

⃗p2 + m2, with 0 < ⃗p2 < ∞.
Hence, the positive-energy free Dirac particle has m ≤E ≤∞, whereas the
negative energy solution has −∞≤E ≤−m

are chosen to have some deﬁnite ﬁxed values, the ﬁelds
ψ†(⃗x), ψ(⃗x) can be thought of as classical ﬁelds having some ﬁxed (fermionic)

obtains the following diagonal form for the Dirac Hamiltonian:

(8.6.2)
In the Hamiltonian and state space formulation, the ﬁeld ψ(t, ⃗x), for each value
of t, ⃗x, is a Heisenberg operator on state space; equivalently, the coefﬁcients b(i)
⃗p in
Eq. 8.6.1 become operators for each t, ⃗p and each i.
The Dirac ﬁeld is quantized by considering the ﬁelds ψ†(t, ⃗x), ψ(t, ⃗x) to be
Heisenberg operators with a plane wave expansion given by considering the normal
mode coefﬁcients b(i)
⃗p (t) to be time-dependent Heisenberg operators. The Dirac
ﬁeld ψ(t, ⃗x) is an anticommuting ﬁeld satisfying the Pauli exclusion principle.
The canonical quantization of the Dirac ﬁeld is based on imposing equal time
anticommutation relations for the normal mode coefﬁcients:
{b(i)
⃗p (t), b(i′)†
⃗p′
(t)} = δi−i′δ⃗p−⃗p′
(8.6.3)
{b, b} = 0 = {b†, b†}
From the anticommutation given above and Eq. 8.6.2 for the Hamiltonian, one
would naively think, similar to the case of bosons, that the vacuum (ground state)
|!0⟩of the Dirac ﬁeld should be deﬁned so that it is annihilated by all the destruc-
tion operators b(i)
⃗p , namely
b(i)
⃗p |!0⟩= 0:
False vacuum
The problem with this vacuum is that it is unstable since the (second) negative
energy term in the Hamiltonian in Eq. 8.6.2 implies that the ﬁeld can keep on
lowering its energy by having more and more negative energy electrons – leading

to a vacuum state with inﬁnite negative energy. The proper Dirac vacuum is deﬁned

ﬁeld. In the path integral formulation the quantum ﬁeld ψ(t, ⃗x), ¯ψ(t, ⃗x), for each
value of t, ⃗x, is an independent fermionic integration variable, taking all possible
fermionic values [Baaquie (2014)].

Dirac spinor ﬁeld
8.7 Positrons: Hole theory
When Dirac discovered his equation, the concept of antiparticles was absent in
physics. The “negative energy” states were interpreted by Dirac to be negative
energy electron states. No negative energy electrons have ever been observed; in
fact, for a particle that is moving with only kinetic energy, a negative energy state
means that it must have imaginary velocity and hence is physically forbidden.
Dirac postulated that the vacuum state consists of a sea of all negative energy
electron states being occupied; Dirac then identiﬁed the concept of an antiparticle
state with the absence – from the vacuum state – of a negative energy electron state,
called a hole. The fermionic nature of the Dirac particles allows one to ﬁll up all
the quantum states, starting from the lowest available quantum state, which is the
vacuum state.3
In the hole theory of the positron, as originally conceived by Dirac, the absence
of electron with −ω, ⃗p, s is equivalent to the presence of positron with ω, −⃗p −s.
Table 8.1 summarizes the hole theory of positrons.
Charge conjugation, discussed in Section 8.10, takes the plane wave solution
with |ω|, ⃗p to a solution with −|ω| and −⃗p. The hole theory states that the absence
of a negative energy electron state is equal to a hole (positron) with energy +ω
and momentum ⃗p. On quantizing the Dirac ﬁeld, it will be seen that under charge
conjugation that electrons and positrons are exchanged, such that the electron ⇄
positron.
In the hole-theory interpretation of the Dirac ﬁeld, the positive part of the H
refers to electron creation and destruction operators with positive energy ω. The
negative part of H was thought to come from the creation of negative energy −ω
states by creation operator b(j)†
⃗p , and b(j)†
⃗p |⟩= 0 was taken to mean that all states
with energy −ω = −
0
p2 + m2 were occupied.
A hole in the negative electron sea is the interpretation of an antielectron. How-
ever, with the introduction of the idea of the positron as a particle in its own right,
the idea of the negative sea of electron can be dispensed with and H is rewritten
entirely in terms of the electron and antielectron operators.

Noteworthy 8.1 Fermi and Dirac sea
It is worth noting that in solid state physics, the concept of the Dirac sea is realized
by the so-called Fermi sea. Electrons in, say, a conducting solid are delocalized
in the solid and occupy available quantum states. In a solid, since electrons are
fermions, due to the Pauli exclusion principle, starting from the lowest energy state,
the electrons occupy higher and higher energy quantum states until all the electrons
in the solid are accounted for. The maximum energy occupied by an electron in
a solid is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi energy depends on the atomic and
lattice structure of the solid.
The analogy of negative energy electron states of the Dirac ﬁeld are electrons
having energy less than the Fermi energy. Holes can be created inside the Fermi sea
by removing an electron from the quantum state inside the Fermi sea; the absence
of an electron behaves exactly as “antiparticles.” The main difference is that the
electrons in the Fermi sea with energy less than the Fermi energy are physical
particles, whereas the negative energy electrons of the Dirac sea are nonphysical.
8.8 Antiparticles
In the modern interpretation of the Dirac ﬁeld there are no negative energy electron
states and one dispenses with the hole theory that requires the negative sea of
electron. Instead, the Dirac ﬁeld is understood to consist of two distinct types of
entities, particles and antiparticles; for the electron ﬁeld they are electrons and
positrons (antielectrons). All particles have positive energy and the vacuum simply
consists of no electrons and no positrons.
To precisely deﬁne electrons and positrons in the Dirac Hamiltonian, the follow-
ing redeﬁnitions are made of the creation and destruction operators that appear in
the system. Deﬁne the electron creation and destruction operators to be
i = 1, 2; b(i)†
⃗p ; b(i)
⃗p
δs−s′δ⃗p−⃗q = {b(s)†
⃗p
, b(s′)

(8.8.1)
The positron creation and destruction operators are deﬁned as
d(1)†

−⃗p; d(2)†
⃗p
= b(3)
−⃗p; {d(s)†
⃗p
, d(s′)
⃗q } = δs−s′δ⃗p−⃗q
(8.8.2)
The equal time anticommutation relations, from Eq. 8.6.3, are the following:
{b(s)
⃗p , b(s′)†
⃗p′
} = δs−s′δ⃗p−⃗p′ = {d(s)
⃗p , d(s′)†
⃗p′
}; s, s′ = 1, 2
(8.8.3)
{d, d} = 0 = {d†, d†}; {b, d} = 0 = {b, d†}; {b, b} = 0 = {b†, b†}

no negative energy states. It was the incorrect identiﬁcation of what the creation and
destruction operators are for the physical particles, in this case the electron and its
antielectron, that led to the incorrect view of the particle spectrum having negative
energy electron states.

The quantization of the Dirac ﬁeld yields, from Eq. 8.8.2, the following canonical
equal time anticommutation equation:
{ψα(t, ⃗x), ψ†
β(t, ⃗x′)} = δαβδ(3)(⃗x −⃗x′)
(8.9.6)
The unequal time anticommutator can be computed from the expansion of the ﬁelds
ψ(t, ⃗x) and ψ+(t

′) and yields
{ψα(x), ¯ψβ(x′)} = 0; x = (t, ⃗x); x′ = (t, ⃗x′)
(x −x

Space-like
Note for space-like separation of x, x′ the commutator of the Dirac (fermion)
ﬁeld is
[ψα(x), ¯ψβ(x
′)] ̸= 0
(8.9.7)
One may naively think that this would imply violation of causality since physical
operators with space-like separation, being causally independent, must commute.
However, this is not the case as Eq. 8.9.7 does not imply a violation of relativity
since ψ and ¯ψ are not directly measurable. What can be measured is the charge and
current density of electrons and positrons given by

202
Dirac spinor ﬁeld
jμ(x) = ie ¯ψγμψ −ie⟨!0| ¯ψγμψ|!0⟩
(8.9.8)
Using
[AB, CD] = −AC{D, B} + A{C, B}D −C{D, A}B + {C, A}DB
it can be shown that
[jμ(x), jν(x
′)] = 0
if
(x −x′)2 > 0
Hence operators representing physically measurable properties of a system are
indeed causally independent and commute for space-like separation.
8.10 Charge conjugation
The Dirac ﬁeld contains both particles and antiparticles. Since one of the unique
and remarkable feature of the Dirac ﬁeld is the concept of antiparticles, it is of great
interest to understand this new construction of theoretical physics in some detail.
Hence, the properties of antiparticles are analyzed using the concept of charge
conjugation.
Charge conjugation is the operation that exchanges electrons and positrons. In
the Dirac ﬁeld, there is no explicit difference between the particle and its antiparti-
cle. Hence one expects that the properties of the Dirac ﬁeld be should be unchanged
if one exchanges particles with antiparticles, which indeed is the case.
The appearance of charge e occurs in the Dirac equation only when the electron
is coupled to the electromagnetic ﬁeld:
Aμ = (A0, ⃗A):
Real
(8.10.1)
If one couples the Dirac ﬁeld to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, charge is able to differen-
tiate electrons from the positrons since they are oppositely charged. Hence, under
charge conjugation, one expects that the transformed ﬁeld should have the same
coupling to the electromagnetic ﬁeld as before, but with charge e replaced by the
opposite charge −e.
To study charge conjugation, the Dirac ﬁeld is coupled to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld using the procedure of minimal coupling, which is effected by replacing ∂μ by
∂μ −ieAμ. Minimal coupling maintains local gauge invariance for the coupled the-
ory. Hence, from Eq. 8.2.4, the Dirac equation with coupling to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is given by the ﬁeld equation

∂xμ
−ieAμ

γ μψ + mψ = 0 =

(8.10.2)
One expects that the electron in presence of Aμ gauge ﬁeld with charge e should be
equivalent to a positron with charge −e.

8.10 Charge conjugation

To study this question, the Dirac equation is analyzed to ascertain whether there
is an equivalent “charge conjugated” ﬁeld ψc – that satisﬁes Eq. 8.10.2 but with e
replaced by −e, as given below:

shown to be obtained by charge conjugation, namely
v(s)(⃗p) = Cu(s)∗(⃗p) = iγ2u(s)∗(⃗p); s = 1, 2
(8.10.8)
The positron spinors v(s)(⃗p) have a similar relation with the electron spinors. Since
C∗−1 = C, Eq. 8.10.8 yields
u(s)(⃗p) = C∗−1v(s)∗(⃗p) = Cv(s)∗(⃗p)
(8.10.9)
showing that charge conjugation carried out twice yields the original system.

Dirac spinor ﬁeld
8.10.1 Plane waves
Consider u(1)(t, ⃗x), the positive energy E = ω > 0 electron spinor. Applying charge
conjugation to this state should yield the antiparticle state with positive energy ω.
From Eq. 8.10.8, the positron spinor is given by
v(1)(⃗p) = Cu(1)∗(⃗p) = iγ2u(1)∗(⃗p)

where the last equation follows from Eq. 8.5.2. Eq. 8.10.10 is the result that can be
obtained from the deﬁnition given earlier in Eq. 8.9.4 for v(1)(⃗p).
Hence, under charge conjugation a particle state with spin up, energy ω and
momentum ⃗p, namely u(1)(⃗p), is mapped to −u(4)(−⃗p) = v(1)(⃗p), which is the state
of an antiparticle with spin down, momentum −⃗p and energy ω. Similarly, it can be
shown by an explicit calculation that
v(2)(⃗p) = Cu(2)∗(⃗p) = u(3)(−⃗p)
8.10.2 Dirac ﬁeld conjugation
Charge conjugation deﬁned in Eq. 8.10.5 is interpreted as an operator equation for
carrying out charge conjugation for the quantized Dirac ﬁeld. Charge conjugation
is analyzed to show that for the quantized Dirac ﬁeld, it is a symmetry that inter-
changes particle with antiparticle, namely that under the operation of C electrons
and positrons are exchanged.
Note that we have the following operator equation:
ψ† = (ψ∗)T; ψ∗= (ψ†)T
Hence, the operator interpretation of Eq. 8.10.5 is that the charge conjugated ﬁeld
is expressed follows:
ψc = Cψ∗
⇒ψc = Cψ(†)T
(8.10.11)

where Eqs. 8.10.8 and 8.10.9 have been used to obtain Eq. 8.10.12.
In the charge conjugated ﬁeld ψc(t, ⃗x), the spinor v(s)
⃗p is carried by the electron
creation operator b(s)†
⃗p
and the spinor u(s)
⃗p
is carried by the positron destruction
operator d(s)
⃗p . Hence, as expected, the charge conjugated Dirac ﬁeld ψc(t, ⃗x), given
in Eq. 8.10.12, has exchanged the particle and antiparticle content of the original
Dirac ﬁeld ψ(t, ⃗x) given in Eq. 8.9.5.
From Eq. 8.10.12 one can also read off the effect of charge conjugation on the
creation and annihilation operators. Denoting by C the unitary charge conjugation
operator that acts on the operators of the Dirac ﬁeld yields the following results:
C :

8.11 Dirac ﬁeld: Casimir force
The Casimir force is a result of the zero-point energy, which is the eigenenergy of
the vacuum state of a quantum ﬁeld. One can of course normal order the Hamil-
tonian to remove the zero-point energy, but the effect of the energy of the vacuum
reappears if one compares the difference of the energy between different vacuum
states. One of the simplest ways of studying the Casimir effect is to change the
boundary conditions on the quantum ﬁeld. The change in energy – in going from
one vacuum state to another – is a ﬁnite and measurable quantity. The Casimir
effect, in fact, dominates physics at the nanoscale and is responsible for many
phenomena including friction between solid surfaces.

Figure 8.2 Casimir effect: the Dirac ﬁeld conﬁned to a slab bounded by z = 0 and
z = d.
Consider the Dirac ﬁeld in the presence of two inﬁnitely large conducting plates
with space coordinates given by −∞≤x, y ≤+∞; the plates are separated in the
z-direction, with the z-coordinates of the plates being at z = 0; z = d.
The Dirac ﬁeld is deﬁned on the slab of spacetime bounded by the two plates,
with the Dirac ﬁeld taking values in a ﬁnite and open range, that is, 0 ≤z ≤d,
as shown in Figure 8.2. The treatment of the Casimir effect for the open interval
follows the derivation given by Milonni (1994).
The case of Dirac fermions deﬁned on a cylinder with periodic and antiperiodic
boundary conditions is analyzed later in Section 8.12.
The boundary conditions for the Dirac ﬁeld for the conﬁguration shown in
Figure 8.2 is now analyzed.
The current normal to the conducting plate should be zero. Let ⃗n−(z = 0) =
(0, 0, −1) and ⃗n+(z = d) = (0, 0, 1). Then
⃗n−· ⃗j = 0 = ⃗n+ · ⃗j
(8.11.1)
where
⃗n · ⃗j = ni ¯ψγiψ
It is shown below in Eq. 8.11.5 that these boundary conditions follow from
requiring that the Dirac action S on the semi-inﬁnite domain have no boundary
terms on being varied; that is, δS = 0 should not yield any boundary terms. The
reason for demanding that no boundary terms appear is because only then does the
quantum system have a (well-deﬁned) Hamiltonian and state space.

iδ ¯ψγ3ψ = −iδ ¯ψuσ3ψℓ+ iδ ¯ψℓσ3ψu = −i2δ ¯ψuσ3σ3ψu + i2δ ¯ψuσ 2
3 ψu = 0
Similar to Eq. 8.11.7 and keeping in mind that fermions are antiperiodic at the two
ends of an open interval, one imposes another boundary condition:
iγ3ψ(d) = −ψ(d)
(8.11.10)
In summary, the boundary conditions imposed on the boundary value of the
fermions are the following:
iγ3ψ(0) = ψ(0); iγ3ψ(d) = −ψ(d)
(8.11.11)
Consider only the z-axis that has the open boundary condition, ignoring the other
space directions. The Fourier expansion of the Dirac ﬁeld, as discussed by Milonni
(1994), is given by
ψ(z) =

(eipzz + ie−ipzzγ3)ψpz

eipzd = −e−ipzd
⇒pz = πn
2d : n = 1, 3, 5, . . .
(8.11.13)
Hence, from Eq. 8.11.13, the boundary conditions in Eqs. 8.11.11 and 8.11.13 are

Note that the zero point energy of the fermion ﬁeld is negative, unlike the case
for the photon, where it is positive. However, for both the Dirac and photon ﬁeld
conﬁned to a ﬁnite slab, the Casimir force is attractive. The reason is that the sum
for fermions over the odd modes effectively switches the sign of the (regularized)
vacuum energy. The Casimir force is independent of the charge of the electron and
depends only on c and ¯h.

8.12 Casimir force: (Anti-)periodic
We will now repeat the analysis for the Casimir force but with periodic and antiperi-
odic boundary conditions in the z-direction. Consider the Dirac ﬁeld conﬁned to a
inﬁnite slab in the x, y-directions and with cylindrical boundary conditions (periodic
or antiperiodic) in the z-direction, as shown in Figure 8.3. The fermions are deﬁned
on S1 with radius R and d = 2πR.
The path integral and state space both are a sum of two contributions, one
from fermions periodic in the z-direction and the other being antiperiodic in the
z-direction. These yield the following boundary conditions on the fermions.4
• Periodic – termed R (for Ramond sector)
ψ(z) = ψ(z + d);
¯ψ(z) = ¯ψ(z + d):
Periodic
Periodic boundary condition means that the fermions at z = 0 are equal to
fermions at z = d.
• Antiperiodic – termed NS (for Neveu–Schwarz sector)
ψ(z) = −ψ(z + d);
¯ψ(z) = −¯ψ(z + d):
Antiperiodic
Antiperiodic boundary condition means that the fermions at z = 0 are equal to
the negative of the fermions at z = d.

4 This is similar to the world-sheet boundary conditions in superstring theory. The periodic and antiperiodic
boundary conditions are the Ramond and Neveu–Schwarz boundary conditions, respectively, and we use adopt
this terminology [Polchinski (1998)].

8.12 Casimir force: (Anti-)periodic
211
In particular, the Hamiltonian with periodic and antiperiodic boundary condi-
tions for the Dirac ﬁeld is given by
H = HR ⊕HNS
(8.12.1)
with the state space similarly being a tensor product:
V = VR ⊗VNS
For the open boundary case, discussed in Section 8.11, the ends are open. This
implies that the fermions at the boundaries are distinct. So we had to introduce
boundary conditions given in Eq. 8.11.11 so as to obtain the classical ﬁeld equation.
However, for cylindrical geometry, the classical ﬁeld equation is automatically
satisﬁed by the periodicity and antiperiodicity of the fermions and is shown below.
• Periodic: The periodic boundary condition is
ψ(0) = ψ(d),
¯ψ(0) = ¯ψ(d)
(8.12.2)
The classical ﬁeld equation (ignoring the x, y, t dependence) is
δS = · · · δ ¯ψ(d)γzψ(d) −δ ¯ψ(0)γzψ(0) · · ·
(8.12.3)
For the periodic boundary condition,
δS = · · · δ ¯ψ(d)γzψ(d) −δ ¯ψ(0)γzψ(0) · · ·
= · · · δ ¯ψ(0)γzψ(0) −δ ¯ψ(0)γzψ(0) · · · = 0
(8.12.4)
• Antiperiodic: The antiperiodic boundary condition is
ψ(0) = −ψ(d),
¯ψ(0) = −¯ψ(d)
(8.12.5)
For the antiperiodic boundary condition,
δS = · · · δ ¯ψ(d)γzψ(d) −δ ¯ψ(0)γzψ(0) · · ·
= · · · −δ ¯ψ(0)γz(−ψ(0)) −δ ¯ψ(0)γzψ(0) · · · = 0
(8.12.6)
Hence the classical ﬁeld equation is satisﬁed by the periodicity and the antiperiod-
icity of the Dirac ﬁeld in the z-direcion – with no further condition required on the
Dirac ﬁeld, unlike the case for the open interval.
We assume the fermion degree of freedom has a similar form to that in the
previous case of open boundary conditions:
ψ(z) =

p3

The difference of Eq. 8.12.7 from the previous section is the constraint on p3 and
the absence of the γz term.

Hence, unlike the open boundary case for the Dirac ﬁeld, the periodic geometry

8.13 Summary
The Dirac ﬁeld equation is a synthesis of quantum ﬁelds with special relativity.
The occurrence of antiparticles is a necessary feature of all relativistic ﬁelds. A real

214
Dirac spinor ﬁeld
scalar ﬁeld is its own antiparticle, whereas for a complex scalar ﬁeld, the ﬁelds with
opposite charges constitute a particle–antiparticle pair.
A new feature of the Dirac ﬁeld is that the particles are fermions and carry spin
half. This leads to many new properties of the quantum ﬁeld that are absent in
the case of scalar ﬁelds. For example, the quantization of the Dirac ﬁeld, due to
special relativity, apparently leads to quantum states with negative energy. No free
particle can have negative energy, and so it was a puzzle at the time of its discovery
as to what the signiﬁcance was of the negative energy states. The “hole” theory
of antiparticles postulated by Dirac can be seen, with hindsight, as an attempt to
understand the concept of an antiparticle solely in terms of particles. This was quite
logical for Dirac, since antiparticles and antimatter had never been thought of and,
at that time, there was no physical sign of their existence.
In the modern formulation, there are no negative energy states – which arose
due to the incorrect identiﬁcation of the ﬁeld operators in the Dirac ﬁeld. With
the correct identiﬁcation of the antiparticle’s creation and destruction operators,
the Dirac ﬁeld is seen to consist of particles and antiparticles – all having positive
energy.
All the operators were expressed in terms of the creation and destruction opera-
tors of the particle and antiparticle. Charge conjugation showed that interchanging
particle with antiparticle is equivalent to changing the electric charge e to −e, as
expected.
The Casimir force for the Dirac ﬁeld was computed for different geometries to
study the boundary conditions that are encoded in the spinor ﬁeld.

Photon gauge ﬁeld
9.1 Introduction
The photon ﬁeld is a vector quantum ﬁeld that describes the quantized electromag-
netic ﬁeld. In the classical limit, the photon ﬁeld reduces to the Maxwell electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. The photon ﬁeld is a gauge ﬁeld, obeying the symmetry of local
gauge invariance, and with its lowest energy excitation above the vacuum state
being the massless photon.
It is worth noting that a quantum vector ﬁeld in general does not yield a ﬁnite
quantum ﬁeld theory because the time component of the ﬁeld gives rise to negative
energy states, which appear due to relativistic invariance. It is only vector ﬁelds that
are gauge-invariant that, when coupled to other ﬁelds, yield a ﬁnite and renormaliz-
able quantum ﬁeld theory. Heuristically speaking, gauge symmetry implies that not
all the vector degrees of freedom are physical. Hence, one can essentially eliminate
the time component of the ﬁeld using gauge symmetry.
It can be said with hindsight that it is no surprise that all the fundamental vector
ﬁelds that appear in the Standard Model of particle physics are gauge ﬁelds that
have the symmetry of gauge invariance. The breaking of gauge invariance, by, say,
the Higgs mechanism as discussed in Section 3.10, does not spoil the renormaliz-
ability of the gauge ﬁeld.
The photon ﬁeld is ubiquitous in nature and serves as an example of an Abelian
gauge ﬁeld. The key symmetry of the photon ﬁeld is that of gauge invariance. The
interactions of the Standard Model, carried by the electroweak bosons and colored
gluons, obey non-Abelian gauge symmetry.
The main thrust of this chapter is to study the key features of gauge symmetry
and to derive the implications of gauge-ﬁxing – for both the path integral and
Hamiltonian formulations of the photon ﬁeld. Four approaches to gauge-ﬁxing are
the following.
215

216
Photon gauge ﬁeld
• Derivation of the Coulomb Hamiltonian using the temporal gauge
• Derivation of the Coulomb Hamiltonian using the formalism of the creation and
destruction operators
• The Faddeev-Popov quantization scheme is discussed for the Abelian gauge ﬁeld,
with both the path integral and the BRST state space approach being studied in
some detail.
• Gauge-ﬁxing is not necessary in lattice gauge theory, introduced by Wilson
(1974).
The ﬁrst three approaches to gauge-ﬁxing are analyzed to get a ﬂavor of the issues
involved in quantizing the photon ﬁeld. Gauge-ﬁxing the lattice gauge theory is a
more advanced topic and will not be discussed [Baaquie (1977)].
All the derivations in this chapter are performed for the formulation of the photon
ﬁeld for Euclidean spacetime. The reason is that gauge invariance and gauge-ﬁxing
are features of the gauge ﬁeld not related to the structure of spacetime, and hence
analyzing the subject in Euclidean spacetime greatly simplﬁes the calcuation. All
repeated indices are summed over, and continuation back to Minkowski time is not
required.
Consider the Abelian gauge ﬁeld Aμ, which is a Lorentz vector ﬁeld, with gauge
transformation given by
Aμ →Aμ(φ) = Aμ + ∂μφ; δAμ ≡Aμ(φ) −Aμ = ∂μφ
Consider the gauge invariant ﬁeld tensor
Fμν = ∂μAν −∂νAμ :
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3
Under a gauge transformation, the ﬁeld tensor is invariant since
δFμν = ∂μδAν −∂νδAμ = ∂μ∂νφ −∂ν∂μφ = 0
Hence a gauge-invariant Lagrangian in Euclidean spacetime is given by

9.2 Hamiltonian and state space
The Hamiltonian and state space are obtained for the photon ﬁeld. The derivation is
similar to the one for a scalar ﬁeld, with the additional feature of gauge invariance
leading to new features in the derivation of the Hamiltonian.

Furthermore, for A0 = ∂0φ
F0i = ∂0Ai −∂iA0 = ∂0Ai −∂i∂0φ = ∂0(Ai −∂iφ) = ∂0Ai(φ)
Note the far-reaching fact that the time component A0 is not a dynamical degree of
freedom but, instead, appears in the action to ensure gauge invariance of the kinetic
term ∂0Ai.

In other words, since all φns occurs only in the combination of Ani −∂iφn, the

dφn
integrations occur only in the state vectors |Ani(φn)⟩and ⟨Ani(φn)|, respectively.
Hence a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian is deﬁned by the following:

9.3 Hamiltonian gauge-ﬁxing: Coulomb gauge
219
Since φ(⃗x) is arbitrary, Eq. 9.2.10 yields the constraint of Gauss’s law on the photon
state space given by
∂iEi(⃗x)|!⟩= ⃗∇· ⃗E(⃗x)|!⟩= 0
(9.2.12)
In summary, no gauge was chosen for Z or the action S in deriving the Hamil-
tonian, and H was obtained that acts only on gauge-invariant states. The procedure
followed is seen to be equal to choosing the temporal gauge given by
A0 = 0 ⇒Ei = F0i = ∂0Ai
Canonical quantization yields
[Ai(⃗x), Ej(⃗x′)] = iδ(⃗x −⃗x′)δij
with the simultaneous constraint that
⃗∇· ⃗E(⃗x)|!⟩= 0
9.3 Hamiltonian gauge-ﬁxing: Coulomb gauge
Gauge symmetry and gauge ﬁxing are analyzed in the Hamiltonian formulation.
The formalism is quite distinct from the path integral and hinges on gauge-ﬁxing
the electric ﬁeld operator, which is a differential operator for the photon quantum
ﬁeld.
The state space of the photon ﬁeld is gauge invariant, with the state vectors
obeying
![A(φ)] = ![A]
(9.3.1)
Recall from the discussion of the Lorentz group in Section 3.11 that a four-
component spacetime Lorentz vector is constituted by a Lorentz scalar and a
Lorentz three-vector. Hence the spacetime vector ﬁelds Aμ has three degrees
of freedom that form a vector given by Ai. Gauge invariance of the state space
further shows that of the three components of the gauge ﬁeld Ai(⃗x), only two are
independent–the third component is a redundant gauge degree of freedom. The
two independent components of Ai reﬂect the fact that the photon has only two
polarizations.
To eliminate the gauge degree of freedom from the state space one has to impose
one constraint at every point ⃗x on the gauge ﬁeld Ai(⃗x) by gauge-transforming it to
a new constrained gauge ﬁeld Ci(⃗x); the commonly chosen constraint condition is
the Coulomb gauge given by
∂iCi = 0
(9.3.2)

220
Photon gauge ﬁeld
The constraint on Ci(⃗x) in turn requires that the electric ﬁeld operator be modiﬁed
since the three differential operators
ET
i ≡
δ
iδCi
are no longer independent.
The gauge-transformed Ci yields the constrained electric ﬁeld ˜ET
i operator; it is
shown in this section that in the Coulomb gauge, the electric ﬁeld ET
i satisﬁes, as
required by ∂iCi = 0, the transverse commutation equation
[Ci, ET
j ] = i


δ(⃗x −⃗x′)
(9.3.3)
⇒
[∂iCi, ET
j ] = 0 = [Ci, ∂jET
j ]
Since the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are physically observable, they must commute
for space-like separation. It can be shown that
[ ˜Bi(t, ⃗x), Ej(t
′, ⃗x
′)] = 0 if (⃗x −⃗x
′)2 −(t −t
′)2 > 0: space-like
We choose the Coulomb gauge for a more general conﬁguration where there is an
electric charge density ρ(⃗x). The charge density can come from charged complex
scalar ﬁelds or charge-carrying fermions. In the presence of charges, Gauss’s law is
modiﬁed to
( ⃗∇· ⃗E −ρ)|!⟩= 0; Ei(⃗x) =
δ
iδAi(⃗x)
(9.3.4)
In the Coulomb gauge, the redundant gauge degree of freedom is completely
eliminated. To do so, perform a gauge transformation from Ai to (Ci, φ) such that
Ci = Ai −∂iφ
(9.3.5)
and choose the Coulomb gauge
∇iCi = 0
(9.3.6)
The magnetic ﬁeld is unchanged:
⃗∇× ⃗A = ⃗∇× ⃗C
(9.3.7)
The kinetic part of the Hamiltonian, namely ⃗E2, has to expressed in terms of Ci and
φ. Gauss’s law also has to reexpressed in terms of Ci and φ. For both these cases,
one needs to express δ/δAi in terms of the new variables.

9.3 Hamiltonian gauge-ﬁxing: Coulomb gauge

To evaluate the coefﬁcients δCj/δAi and δφ/δAi one needs to analyze the change of
variables (gauge transformation). Note

Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge
The instantaneous Coulomb potential arises from gauge-ﬁxing. It is not retarded,
unlike the Lienard–Wiechert potential, and may raise questions about Lorentz
invariance. However, it can be shown that the Hamiltonian in the Coulomb gauge
is consistent with Lorentz invariance.
9.4 Coulomb gauge: Normal modes
In Minkowski space, the expansion of the gauge ﬁeld ⃗C(t, ⃗x) in Coulomb gauge can
be written by considering the gauge ﬁeld as a collection of free scalar ﬁelds that
has a normal mode expansion similar to the one given in Eq. 7.6.4. Gauge-ﬁxing is
achieved by imposing the condition that the gauge-ﬁxed electric ﬁeld is transverse,
as given in Eq. 9.3.14 on the normal mode expansion of the gauge-ﬁxed photon
ﬁeld.
Consider the gauge-ﬁxed photon ﬁeld that satisﬁes the Coulomb gauge given by
∇· ⃗C(t, ⃗x) = 0
Due to the Coulomb gauge, the photon ﬁeld has two polarizations; the polarization
vectors are used for taking linear combinations of the creation and destruction
operators such that the gauge-ﬁxing condition can be fulﬁlled.

Photon gauge ﬁeld
Using the polarization vectors yields the following expansion of the gauge-ﬁxed

⃗ϵ⃗kλ = ⃗ϵ∗
⃗kλ; ⃗ϵ⃗kλ · ⃗ϵ⃗kλ′ = δλλ′; λ, λ′ = 1, 2
Since the gauge ﬁeld ⃗C = ⃗C† is Hermitian, the value of the polarization vectors for
−⃗k is deﬁned by
⃗ϵ−⃗kλ = ⃗ϵ⃗kλ
The Coulomb gauge ﬁxing condition is realized by imposing the constraint
∇· ⃗C(t, ⃗x) = 0 ⇒
⃗k · ⃗ϵ⃗kλ = 0

consequence of gauge invariance.

transformation:


dxi = J

i
dyi; J = det(Jij)
(9.5.1)

228
Photon gauge ﬁeld
Let the eigenvalues of the matrix Jij be given by λn; then the determinant is given by
det J =
N

n=1
λn
(9.5.2)
The divergence of Z can be seen by considering a change of variables
Ai, A0 →˜Ai, φ
that is encoded in the following gauge transformation:
˜Ai = Ai −∂iφ;
˜A0 = A0 −∂0φ
Hence, from Eq. 9.5.1
DAi = D ˜Ai; DA0 = det(∂0)Dφ = const × Dφ
The action S is gauge invariant and does not depend on φ and hence S[A] = S[ ˜A].
The change of variables yields, up to irrelevant constants,
Z =

DAeS[A] =

D ˜ADφeS[ ˜A] =

(9.5.3)
Note that although the path integral

D ˜AeS[ ˜A] :
ﬁnite
is ﬁnite, the path integral breaks Lorentz invariance since in the temporal gauge
˜A0 = 0. Hence this path integral is not suitable for perturbation theory using
Feynman diagrams. In Section 9.2 where the gauge symmetry was considered from
the Hamiltonian point of view, the temporal gauge was more appropriate. This is
because the Hamiltonian singles out one direction as time and apparently breaks
Lorentz symmetry.3
9.6 Gauge-ﬁxing the action
To obtain a ﬁnite and convergent partition function Z, the inﬁnite term

Dφ = ∞
needs to be factored out of the path integral. This procedure is called gauge-ﬁxing
or choosing a gauge. The pioneering work of Faddeev and Popov [Faddeev and
Slavnov (1980)] showed how to gauge-ﬁx the path integral for gauge ﬁelds.
Consider a gauge-ﬁxing term that necessarily breaks gauge invariance. A
Lorentz-invariant choice of gauge is given by
s = ∂μAμ = 0
3 Lorentz symmetry is preserved in the Hamiltonian formulation by a combination of gauge and Lorentz
transformations.

9.6 Gauge-ﬁxing the action

Do an inverse gauge transformation given by
Aμ →Aμ(φ−1) = Aμ + ∂μφ
(9.6.3)
Then the gauge-ﬁxing term in the numerator decouples from the gauge
transformation
s(φ · φ−1) = ∂μAμ(φ−1) −∂2φ = ∂μ(Aμ + ∂μφ) −∂2φ = ∂μAμ
and the denominator yields
s(φ
′) = ∂μAμ(φ−1) −∂2φ
′ = ∂μAμ −∂2(φ

After gauge-ﬁxing, the partition function is convergent. Note in the functional inte-
gral, all the four components of the gauge ﬁeld are integration variables. The action
S is Lorentz invariant and so is the Faddeev–Popov counterterm SFP – hence leading
to a Lorentz-invariant action and a symmetric perturbation expansion.

The gauge-ﬁxed partition function is a particular case of the fact that gauge-

E[ ˆO[A]] =

expression in Eq. 9.6.8, consider a gauge transformation A →A(φ) and integrate
over all gauge transformations by

Dφ. Using the fact that ˆO[A], S and SFP are all
gauge invariant, the expectation value is given by

The Faddeev–Popov term det(−∂2) is usually ignored for the Abelian gauge ﬁeld
since it is independent of the gauge ﬁeld Aμ.
Making all the four components of the gauge ﬁeld independent degrees of
freedom comes at a price, which is the gauge-ﬁxing term that is inserted as a
delta function constraint δ(s), and which necessarily breaks gauge invariance. The
Faddeev–Popov counterterm is required for ensuring that the gauge-ﬁxing term
introduced in the action leaves the gauge-invariant sector invariant. For the Abelian
gauge ﬁeld, the Faddeev–Popov counterterm does not depend on the gauge ﬁeld
Aμ, but this is not the case for the non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds.
The great utility of using the gauge-ﬁxed path integral to evaluate the expecta-
tion values is that gauge-ﬁxing leaves the gauge-invariant sector invariant. Since
the gauge-ﬁxed theory is Lorentz invariant, it can be used for a Lorentz-invariant
Feynman expansion of all gauge-invariant correlation functions.
9.7 Ghost ﬁeld: Finite time path integral
Consider the partition function for ﬁnite time – denoted by τ. The ﬁnite time
path integral, denoted by Z(τ), is a logically necessary part of the path integral
formulation of quantum ﬁelds. For example, in Section 22.7, the ﬁnite time partition
function Z(τ) is used for determining all the eigenenergies of two-dimensional
quantum electrodynamics:4
Z(τ) = tr(e−τ ˆH)
(9.7.1)
In computing the trace of the operator exp{−τ ˆH}, with the deﬁning Equation 9.7.1
for Z, the trace must be taken over a complete set of states that are periodic func-
tions in the time direction.

For inﬁnite time path integral the Faddeev–Popov term decouples from the gauge
ﬁeld. However, for ﬁnite time, the Faddeev–Popov term needs to be kept and we
examine this aspect. Since they are deﬁned by the determinant of bosonic ﬁelds, the

with τ = 1/(kB × temperature), but this connection is irrelevant for our discussion.

eigenstates required for the Faddeev–Popov determinant are periodic functions for
a ﬁnite time τ.
Hence, the determinant det(−∂2) is taken over only periodic functions. In the

The gauge-ﬁxed action SGF has four components for the gauge ﬁeld Aμ, whereas
there are only two physical degrees of freedom. This is because the photon is
massless and has only two polarizations. The Faddeev–Popov ghost determinant
precisely cancels the extra factors of determinant that arise from the gauge-ﬁxed
action SGF; the ﬁnal answer obtained above is what one expects.
To evaluate detτ(−∂2), one needs to ﬁnd all the eigenvalues of ∂2 and then use
the inﬁnite-dimensional generalization of Eq. 9.5.2. In the momentum basis the
eigenfunctions Wnp, which are periodic in interval [t, t + τ], are given by

9.9 Faddeev–Popov quantization
The representation of the determinant det(−∂2) using fermion integration, reviewed
in Appendix 9.14 and discussed in detail in Baaquie (2014), is fundamental to
the Faddeev–Popov formulation of constrained systems, and of gauge ﬁelds in
particular. The full power of the Faddeev–Popov formulation comes to the fore
in the study of Yang–Mills non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds. The essential ideas of the
Faddeev–Popov formalism are discussed in the simpler case of the photon ﬁeld.

The Faddeev–Popov determinant requires the ghost ﬁelds ¯c, c to be complex
fermionic ﬁelds due to the result for fermion Gaussian integration given in

The ﬁelds ¯c, c do not obey the spin-statistic rule that requires that all fermions
must have half-integer spin, and for this reason are called Faddeev–Popov ghost
ﬁelds. The fermionic ghost ﬁelds have spin zero, dictated by the rules of fermion
integration, and hence are not physical particles. Nevertheless, ghost ﬁelds play
a key role in the study of gauge ﬁeld theories and string theory and their full
signiﬁcance is mysterious and has not yet been fully understood.
9.10 Ghost state space and Hamiltonian
The state space of the quantum ﬁeld is determined by the time derivative terms
in the action; the reason is that the time derivative couples the gauge ﬁeld at two
different instants and at each instant, the gauge ﬁeld is a coordinate of the under-
lying state space. The ghost action is similar to the action for the complex scalar
ﬁeld discussed in Section 7.12. Hence, the state space has the fermion coordinate
eigenstates given by

δ(¯c −¯c′)δ(c −c′) = −(¯c −¯c′)(c −c′)
(9.10.1)
To prove the above statement, consider an arbitrary function f(¯c, c) of ¯c, c with the
following Taylor expansion:
f(¯c, c) = α + β ¯c + γ c + ω¯cc

9.10.1 BRST cohomology: State space
The Coulomb gauge, discussed in Section 9.3, is manifestly noncovariant and
explicitly breaks Lorentz invariance. The gauge condition is A0 = 0 supplemented

238
Photon gauge ﬁeld
by imposing the transversality condition on the state space given by ∂iAi = 0.
The normal mode method of gauge-ﬁxing also breaks Lorentz invariance since
only the space components Ci appear in the normal mode expansion, with the time
component of the gauge ﬁeld removed by gauge-ﬁxing.
One can also obtain a state space description of the photon ﬁeld using a covariant
gauge that respects Lorentz symmetry. For example, consider the Lorentz gauge
deﬁned by ∂μAμ = 0; one can consistently quantize the photon ﬁeld using the
Gupta–Bleuler formalism. However, the Gupta–Bleuler approach cannot be gener-
alized to Yang–Mills non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds.
The BRST method of quantization is a modern formulation of the Gupta–Bleuler
approach that is equally valid for the Yang–Mills ﬁelds. The ghost ﬁelds are used to
remove the extra degrees of freedom for the case of a covariant (Lorentz invariant)
gauge, and this formalism can be generalized to the Yang–Mills case.
The BRST method has the following ingredients. The gauge-ﬁxed action has a
BRST symmetry with a fermionic BRST charge operator QB. The BRST conserved
charge obeys [H, QB] = 0, where H is the Hamiltonian of the gauge ﬁxed theory
given in Eq. 9.10.5. The state space is enlarged to include the ghost ﬁeld VA ⊗V¯c,c
with completeness on this state space given by Eq. 9.10.3.
The physical state space is a subspace of VA ⊗V¯c,c and is deﬁned for |!⟩∈
VA ⊗V¯c,c. The physical gauge-invariant states |!⟩obey further conditions of BRST
cohomology, given below, that deﬁne the physical gauge-invariant state subspace.
• The operator QB is nilpotent since Q2
B = 0.
• The exact states are of the form QB|χ⟩that are automatically annihilated by QB.
These exact states are states that correspond to pure gauge transformations such
that Aμ = ∂μφ.
• Physical states |!⟩are constrained to be annihilated by QB and are said to be
closed under QB and obey QB|!⟩= 0. Since charge QB is conserved, the con-
straint is conserved over time.
• Physical states |!⟩are not exact, that is, |!⟩̸= QB|χ⟩.
• States that can be written as |!⟩+ QB|χ⟩are all equivalent to |!⟩and can be
shown to differ by only a gauge transformation.
• Physical states |!⟩are precisely the gauge-invariant states of the photon ﬁeld.
The BRST formalism is shown in Section 9.12.1 to reduce to the Gupta–Bleuler
scheme for the case of the Abelian gauge ﬁeld.
9.11 BRST charge QB
The gauge-ﬁxed action given in Eq. 9.10.2 is BRST invariant, which is the result
of choosing a gauge and its compensating Faddeev–Popov counterterm. The

Noether current due to BRST invariance yields the BRST charge QB [Das (2006);
Zinn-Justin (1993)].
It is convenient to write the gauge-ﬁxed action in terms of an auxiliary ﬁeld as

Consider a fermionic parameter λ such that

The BRST transformation consists of an inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation for Aμ
together with the following transformation of the ghost and auxiliary ﬁelds:
δAμ = λ∂μc; δ ¯c = −iλG; δc = 0 = δG
(9.11.3)
Note one can deﬁne a BRST transformation with δ ¯c = 0 and δc ̸= 0; this gives rise
to the same BRST charge.
The BRST variation of Eq. 9.11.1 is given by
δ ˜S = iλ

∂μG∂μc + iλ


BRST invariance yields a conserved fermionic charge QB using the Noether current

representations of the quantum ﬁelds Aμ and ¯c, c are written in terms of creation

similar to the case for the Euclidean free ﬁeld given in Eq. 7.14.8, is the following:

The signs of the kinetic and potential terms of HG are ﬁxed by the rules of fermion
integration. Note the differing signs for HA, HG for the kinetic and potential terms;
this is the reason that the zero point energies of the bosonic and fermionic ﬁelds
have opposite signs.9
Substituting the Fourier expansion for Aμ, ¯c, c given in Eqs. 9.12.2 and 9.12.4
yields – similar to the case of the real and complex scalar ﬁelds given by

state space is annihilated by QB, that is,
QB|!⟩= 0
(9.12.14)
9.12.1 Gupta–Bleurler condition
It is shown how the deﬁnition of state space given by BRST quantization reduces
to the Gupta–Bleurler constraint on state space when the gauge ﬁeld state space is
considered by itself, without the presence of the ghost ﬁeld.

Since the gauge and ghost ﬁeld are decoupled, the physical state vector is taken to
be a tensor product:
|!⟩= |!A⟩|!G⟩

244
Photon gauge ﬁeld
Ghost number is conserved and |!G⟩is taken to have zero ghost number. From
the expression for QB given in Eq. 9.12.13, the ghost state is taken to be the ground
state |!G⟩= |G⟩that is annihilated by A⃗p, deﬁned by10
A⃗p|G⟩= 0 = B⃗p|G⟩
Hence the BRST constraint reduces to
QB|!⟩= −i

⃗p
pμa⃗pμ|!A⟩B†
⃗p|G⟩= 0
Since B†
⃗p|G⟩̸= 0, to achieve QB|!⟩= 0 the following constraint is imposed on
the gauge ﬁeld state vectors:
QB|!⟩= 0 ⇒pμa⃗pμ|!A⟩= 0
This constraint can be written more transparently in real space; from Eq. 9.12.2
∂μAμ(⃗x) = ∂μA(−)
μ (⃗x) + ∂μA(+)
μ (⃗x)
where A(−)
μ
has all the annihilation operators and A(+)
μ
has all the creation operators.
The BRST constraint yields the following:
pμa⃗pμ|!A⟩= 0 ⇒∂μA(−)
μ (⃗x)|!A⟩= 0: Gupta–Bleuler condition
Note that, since
⟨!A|∂μA(+)
μ
= 0
the Gupta–Bleuler condition implies that for any physical state |!A⟩
⟨!A|∂μAμ|!A⟩= ⟨!A|

∂μA(+)
μ
+ ∂μA(−)
μ
.
|!A⟩= 0
In other words, instead of imposing the gauge condition on the operator Aμ, given
by ∂μAμ = 0, in the Gupta–Bleuler approach the weaker condition is imposed that
the expectation value of the operator ∂μAμ for any gauge-invariant (physical) state
has to be zero.
In conclusion, the physical gauge-invariant state space is given by the constraint
QB|!⟩= 0; |!⟩= |!A⟩|G⟩
The physics of the BRST constraint on state space has been discussed in Peskin and
Schroeder (1995).

9.13 Summary

9.13 Summary
The photon is a vector ﬁeld and is renormalizable, when coupled to other ﬁelds,
due to having the symmetry of gauge invariance. The path integral for the photon
ﬁeld is divergent due to gauge invariance and the procedure for ﬁxing a gauge is
necessary to have a ﬁnite theory.
The quantum ﬁeld theory of the Abelian gauge ﬁeld revolves around the concept
of gauge, and the main focus of the discussion in this chapter was on analyzing the
various ramiﬁcations of gauge symmetry. Although the photon is a free quantum
ﬁeld, a number of complexities arise in addressing the concept of gauge invariance.
Choosing a gauge for the gauge-ﬁeld, called gauge ﬁxing, is in essence a
constraint on the gauge ﬁeld – imposed to remove the redundant extra degree
of freedom from the theory. Gauge-ﬁxing leaves the gauge-invariant sector of
the theory unchanged; since all physical quantities are the expectation values of
gauge-invariant operators, gauge-ﬁxing leaves the physical sector unchanged.
There are many ways of gauge-ﬁxing the theory. One can remove the unphysical
degrees of freedom by, for example, choosing one component, such as A0 in the
temporal gauge, and setting it to zero. This choice of gauge leaves a very asymmet-
ric action that is suitable for studying the Hamiltonian and state space – but is not
amenable to Feynman perturbation expansion.
The Coulomb gauge was chosen for the Hamiltonian formulation. The Hamil-
tonian in the Coulomb gauge was derived to show the complexity of choosing a
gauge for a differential operator. A functional change of variables was required to
express the Hamiltonian in the gauge-ﬁxed ﬁeld variables. One obtains a transverse
electric ﬁeld operator and a Coulomb potential between external charge density.
The Coulomb gauge can be imposed on the normal mode expansion of the gauge
ﬁeld, and yields two polarizations for the creation and distinction operators. The
Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian, using the creation and destruction operators, was
obtained by implementing the gauge-ﬁxing condition using an appropriate choice
for the polarization vectors of the gauge-ﬁxed gauge ﬁeld.
A symmetric way of removing the unphysical degrees of freedom is to choose
a covariant gauge. This choice of gauge is compensated by the Faddeev–Popov
counterterm, which in turn introduces the concept of the ghost ﬁeld. Faddeev–
Popov quantization is most suitable for using Feynman perturbation theory and
is indispensable in the study of non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds.
The state space of the Faddeev–Popov gauge-ﬁxed theory is vastly increased by
the addition of the ghost ﬁelds to the quantum ﬁeld theory. A Hamiltonian in the
covariant Feynman gauge as well as a gauge-invariant state space – using coho-
mology of the nilpotent BRST charge operator QB – was derived for the covariant
gauge. It was shown that BRST cohomology yields the result obtained earlier by

246
Photon gauge ﬁeld
Gupta–Bleuler based on a covariant gauge. It is noteworthy that the BRST charge
is well deﬁned and nilpotent in Euclidean spacetime. For this reason the state space
analysis for the covariant gauge can be fully analyzed in Euclidean spacetime, with
no reference to Minkowski spacetime.
The fundamental reason for the adequacy of Euclidean spacetime for analyzing
the state space is that the state space is a structure that is time independent; and
for systems with Hamiltonians that do not depend on velocity, the Hamiltonians
for both Minkowski and Euclidean spacetime are identical. For more complex
higher derivative systems like the acceleration Lagrangian studied in Chapter 4,
the connection of state space between the two formulations is more complicated.
The ghost ﬁeld is an artifact of gauge ﬁxing and is a bit mysterious since it
seems to have mathematical signiﬁcance that is yet to be fully understood; for
instance, the ghost ﬁeld also appears in superstring theory, where it seems to be
indispensable. The ghost ﬁeld brings about a marvelously compact reorganization
of the mathematics of both the photon ﬁeld’s path integral as well its state space.
9.14 Appendix: Fermion calculus
Fermionic calculus has been discussed in detail in Baaquie (2014). The results here
are focused are on the Gaussian path integrals for fermionic variables.
An independent and self-contained formalism for realizing all the deﬁning
properties of fermions is provided by a set of anticommuting fermionic variables
ψ1, ψ2, . . . ψN and its complex conjugate fermionic variables ¯ψ1, ¯ψ2, . . . ¯ψN deﬁned
by the following properties:
{ψi, ψj} = −{ψi, ψj}; { ¯ψi, ψj} = −{ψj, ¯ψi}; { ¯ψi, ¯ψj} = −{ ¯ψj, ¯ψi}
Hence, it follows that

Noteworthy 9.2 Real and complex fermions
Fermions, like ordinary real variables, can be real and complex. Consider a real
fermion χ; its deﬁning property is
χ2 = 0 ⇒f(χ) = a = bχ with a, b : Real numbers
A complex fermion ψ and its complex conjugate ¯ψ are given by real fermions χ, ξ
as follows:
ψ = χ + iξ;
¯ψ = χ −iξ
⇒ψ2 = 0 = ¯ψ2

Since ¯ψ2 = 0, Taylor expansion shows that the most general function of the
variable ¯ψ is given by

Forward interest rates’ quantum ﬁeld*
10.1 Introduction
The application of the mathematics of quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory
to ﬁnance is a growing subject. The application of quantum ﬁelds to the modeling
of interest rates has been developed by Baaquie (2004, 2010). The modeling of
interest rates by a quantum ﬁeld is similar to the case of phase transitions, where a
classical system’s randomness is modeled using the mathematics of quantum ﬁeld
theory.
The theories of coupon bonds and of interest rates are based on two different
types of quantum ﬁelds: coupon bonds are modeled using a linear quantum ﬁeld
and Libor interest rates are modeled using a nonlinear quantum ﬁeld. Both the
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of quantum ﬁelds for the two cases are
developed to demonstrate the utility of these two different, but complementary,
approaches.
This chapter reviews the formulation of linear forward interest rates – based
on a two-dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld. Nonlinear Libor interest rates are
discussed later in Chapter 19.
The quantum ﬁeld driving the coupon bonds is discussed in some detail as it
exempliﬁes the appearance of quantum ﬁelds in ﬁnance. Key concepts of forward
interest rates and that of a martingale process are expressed in the framework of
quantum ﬁelds. Empirical evidence is provided in Baaquie (2004, 2010) to support
the modeling of forward interest rates with a two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld, and
is brieﬂy reviewed. Given the relatively recent application of quantum ﬁelds to
ﬁnance, empirical evidence will serve to ground this application.
The connection of the ﬁeld theory approach to forward interest rates with the
industry standard Heath, Jarrow and Morton (HJM) model [Heath et al. (1992)],
which is based on white noise, has been discussed in detail in Chapter 6 of Baaquie
(2004), and hence will not be repeated here.

252
Forward interest rates’ quantum ﬁeld
There are a number of features for the application of quantum ﬁelds to ﬁnance
that do not usually appear in physics. Some of these key new features are the
following.
• The quantum ﬁeld is deﬁned on a compact two-dimensional manifold, with one
dimension being calendar time and the other dimension being future time.
• Future time is a purely social construct and is the reﬂection of future expectations
of the participants of the ﬁnancial markets.
• The quantum ﬁeld’s compact domain has four boundaries, with Dirichlet bound-
ary conditions on two of the boundaries in the direction of calendar time and
Neumann boundary conditions on the other two boundaries.
• The action of the quantum ﬁeld is nonlocal and asymmetric; the compact domain
on which the action is deﬁned yields a time-dependent state space and a time-
dependent Hamiltonian.
• The Hamiltonian has a kinetic term that is nonlocal in the future time direction.
• A nonlinear action and Hamiltonian drives the so-called Libor interest rates.
• A central idea in the pricing of ﬁnancial instruments is the concept of the martin-
gale, which is given a path integral and Hamiltonian formulation.
Sections 10.13 and 10.14 are useful for empirical analysis of risk-free and risky
forward interest rates. For many emerging markets forward interest rates data are
not available and only the sovereign coupon bond data are available; for these cases
one needs the results of Sections 10.13 and 10.14 to carry out the analysis.
10.2 Forward interest rates
One of the most widely traded instruments in the ﬁnancial markets are Treasury
coupon and zero coupon bonds. These are promissory notes issued by governments
with a ﬁxed maturity in the future, and pay $1 at future calendar time T.
A zero coupon bond is a ﬁnancial instrument that gives a single predetermined
payoff, of say $1, called the principal amount, when it matures at some ﬁxed future
time T; its price at earlier time t < T is given by B(t, T). Note that for a zero coupon
bond there are no coupon payments, hence the name.
At time t there are in principle inﬁnitely many zero coupon bonds with varying
maturities; that is, bonds B(t, T), in principle, exist for all T ∈[t, t + ∞] years.
In practice, in the capital markets, the zero coupon bonds are usually issued with
maturity from one day to about 30 years in the future and hence T ∈[t, t+30] years.
The collection of the prices of all zero coupon bonds B(t, T), with maturity from
present time t to a maximum time T is called the zero coupon bond term structure.
The forward interest rate, denoted by f(t, x), is the instantaneous interest rate
ﬁxed at time t for an overnight loan at future time x > t. Both the bond market
and interest paid on cash deposits are determined by f(t, x). It can be shown that

In Feb, 2018, outstanding US Treasury bonds held by the public was $21.5
trillion, compared with the US GDP of $19 trillion in 2017. At any instant t, there
exist in the market Treasury bonds with maturity of up to future time TFR, and
hence forward interest rates f(t, x), at any instant of calendar time t, exist for all
future times given by t < x < t + TFR.1
Figure 10.1 shows the market data on the forward interest rates for the US dollar
obtained from the Eurodollar futures for 1990–1996. Figure 10.1 plots the daily
traded values of forward rates for only eight maturities, namely for maturities of
three months and yearly maturities from one to seven. The forward interest rates’
time evolution for eight maturities has the appearance of eight points randomly
evolving in time, but in a very correlated manner; for example, all the lines move
up and down together and they never cross. The full forward rate curve consists
of inﬁnitely many maturities, all of which evolve randomly in a highly correlated
manner.
Since at any instant t there are inﬁnitely many forward interest rates, an inﬁnite
number of independent variables are required to describe its random evolution.
The theory of quantum ﬁelds is a mathematical framework for studying problems
involving inﬁnitely many (independent) degrees of freedom, and so one is natu-
rally led to its techniques in the study of interest rates. The forward interest rates
are modeled as a boson quantum ﬁeld with f(t, x) being an independent random
variable for each x and each t.
1 TFR is greater than 30 years.

For the sake of concreteness, consider the evolution of the forward interest rates
starting from some initial time Ti to a future time Tf. Since all the forward rates
f(t, x) are always for the future, it is always true that x > t; hence the quantum ﬁeld
f(t, x) is deﬁned on a domain consisting of a trapezoid T that is bounded in the
maturity direction by parallel lines x = t and x = TFR + t, and in the time direction
by the horizontal lines t = Ti and t = Tf as shown in Figure 10.2(a). Every point
inside the domain T represents an independent integration variable f(t, x). Forward
rates and Treasury bonds are modeled by a two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld on a
ﬁnite (Euclidean) domain.2
The forward rates starting from some time Ti can in principle be deﬁned into
the inﬁnite future, that is, with Tf = ∞; for simplicity the inﬁnite limit of TFR is
also taken, and yields a semi-inﬁnite domain shown in Figure 10.2(b). The ﬁnite
domain T of the forward rates can be extended, as shown in Figure 10.2(b), to a
semi-inﬁnite wedge that is bounded by line x = t and by the line t = Ti in the time
direction.
10.3 Action and Lagrangian
To deﬁne a Lagrangian L, one needs a kinetic term, denoted by Lkinetic, and which
is necessary to have a time evolution for the forward interest rates. It is known
empirically that the forward interest rates have a drift velocity α(t, x) and volatility
σ(t, x); these have to appear directly in the Lagrangian. The important insight of
Heath, Jarrow and Morton [Heath et al. (1992)] consists in recognizing that the
combination of forward interest rates that occurs in ﬁnance is of the form
2 The ﬁeld theory interpretation of the evolution of the forward rates, as expressed in the domain T , is that of a
(nonrelativistic) quantum string moving with unit velocity in the x (maturity) direction.

Where A(t, x) is a two dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld.
The kinetic term should include the following term:
Lkinetic = −1
2A2(t, x)
Another term is required in the Lagrangian L that constrains the change of shape
of the forward interest rates in the future time direction x. The analogy of this in the
case of an ordinary string is a tension term in the Lagrangian that attenuates sharp
changes in the shape of the string, since the shape of the string stores potential
energy. To model a similar property for the forward rates one cannot use a simple
tension-like term (∂f/∂x)2 in the Lagrangian since this term is ruled out by the
so-called (risk-neutral) martingale condition for the forward rates [Baaquie (2004)].
The existence of a martingale measure requires that the forward rates Lagrangian
contain higher order derivative terms, essentially a term of the form (∂2f/∂x∂t)2
[Baaquie (2010)]; such string systems have been studied by Polyakov (1986) and
are said to be strings with ﬁnite rigidity and yield a term Lrigid in the forward rates
Lagrangian. Based on empirical studies of interest rates by Baaquie and Bouchaud
(2004), a third term is required in the Lagrangian Lstiff, so as to increase the stiffness
of the ﬂuctuations in the future time-to-maturity direction x.
The Lagrangian density L[f] is given by [Baaquie (2004)]
L[f] = Lkinetic[f] + Lrigid[f] + Lstiff[f]

The Lagrangian in general is nonlinear since the drift α(t, x) can, in general, depend
on the forward interest rates f(t, x). In fact, the main difference between the model-
ing of Libor interest rates and coupon bonds is that the Lagrangian for Libor has a
nonlinear drift term.
The drift term α(t, x) is completely determined by the requirement of obtaining
a martingale evolution of the forward interest rates.

Forward interest rates’ quantum ﬁeld
Since the ﬁeld theory is deﬁned on a ﬁnite domain T as shown in Figure 10.2(a),
to complete the deﬁnition of the model, boundary conditions need to be speciﬁed
on all four boundaries of the ﬁnite trapezoid T .
• Fixed (Dirichlet) Initial and Final Conditions
The initial and ﬁnal (Dirichlet) conditions in the time direction are given by
t = Ti ; Ti < x < Ti + TFR ; f(Ti, x): speciﬁed initial forward rate curve
t = Tf ; Tf < x < Tf + TFR ; f(Tf, x): speciﬁed ﬁnal forward rate curve
• Free (Neumann) Boundary Conditions
To specify the boundary condition in the maturity direction, one needs to impose
the condition on the action given in Eq. 10.3.6 that it has no surface terms. The
Lagrangian in the action

T L[f] can be integrated by parts with respect to x, and
the requirement that there are no boundary terms yields the following Neumann
boundary condition:
Ti < t < Tf: ∂

(10.3.8)
The Neumann boundary conditions are necessary for obtaining a Hamiltonian
for the forward rates. Doing an integration by parts in the maturity direction using
the Neumann boundary conditions yields, from Eqs. 10.3.7 and 10.3.3, the action

The propagator given in Eq. 10.4.4 has three branches, with the explicit expression
for D(x −t; x′ −t) for the three branches given in Baaquie (2004, 2014). The
propagator has been studied in detail by Baaquie (2014), including its state space
interpretation.
10.4.1 Stiff propagator
The propagator in Eq. 10.4.4 has been studied for the case of commodities in
Section 6.5.1. However, unlike the case of commodities for which the propagator
is deﬁned between two different calendar times, the propagator for the forward
interest rates is deﬁned for future time x −t and on a nontrivial domain wedge –
with Neumann conditions for x = t. To incorporate the boundary condition on the
propagator, the essential steps for its derivation are shown below.
The empirical behavior of forward interest rates is determined by the real branch
of the propagator D(x −t; x′ −t). The general case is given by the following.

The solution for α± yields three distinct cases, namely, when α± is real, complex
or degenerate. For the purpose of illustrating the general result, we consider only
the real branch.5

(10.4.9)
Although the propagators for the forward interest rates and commodities look
similar, there is one signiﬁcant difference. Recall that Section 6.7, and in particular
Eq. 6.3.4, shows that the path integration variable for commodities is constrained.
Unlike commodities that have normalized variables, the forward interest rates are
unconstrained; what this means in practice is that the calibration of the forward
interest rates has one extra parameter compared with the commodities.
Noteworthy 10.1 Critical point μ2 = λ2/2

derivative in future time x – consider the critical branch given by μ2 = λ2/2. Then

action given in Eq. 10.4.11; the propagator has a “kink” at x = 0 (derivative is
divergent) as shown in Figure 10.3(a). In contrast, a nonzero λ yields a propagator,
given in Eq. 10.4.12, that has no kink at x = 0, as shown in Figure 10.3(b).
The reason that there is no kink for x ≃0, from Eq. 10.4.12, is that the propagator
is given by
d(x) ≈

+ O(λ)
Hence the propagator is smooth at x = 0 and all derivatives are ﬁnite. Figure 10.3(b)
shows the higher order smoothed-out propagator. This smoothing of the propagator
was the reason that the stiff component Lagrangian Lstiff was introduced in the ﬁrst
place.
Hence, for μ2 = λ2/2
D(x −t; x′ −t) = λ4{d(x + x′ −2t) + d(x −x′)}
At the critical point, the Hamiltonian is pseudo-Hermitian – and not equivalent
to a Hermitian operator – and is given by a direct sum of Jordan blocks. The critical
correlation function given in Eq. 10.4.12 is due to the properties of the Jordan
blocks’ state space and has been evaluated by Baaquie (2014) using the state space
of the Jordan blocks.

10.5 Forward interest rate covariance
261
The backward derivative in Eq. 10.5.1 is necessary since x ≥t; hence
δf(t, t) = f(t, t) −f(t −ϵ, t)
which is consistent with the fact that the future is not known.
From Eq. 10.4.2, the equal time expectation value of the ﬁelds is singular. The
propagator given in Eq. 10.4.2 depends on future time x only via remaining future
time, measured by x −t ≡θ; the reason for this is the boundary condition at x = t.
To bring out this feature of the forward interest rates, the following notation is
introduced:
A(t, x) ≡A(t, θ)
On discretizing time t →nϵ, where ϵ is the spacing of the time lattice, from
Eq. 2.4.11, δ(0) = 1/ϵ; hence, from Eq. 10.4.2
E[A(t, θ)A(t′, θ′)] = δ(t −t′)D(θ, θ′) ⇒E[A(t, θ)A(t, θ′)] = 1
ϵ D(θ, θ′)
(10.5.2)
Central to the empirical analysis is the following covariance
E[δf(t, θ)δf(t, θ′)]c ≡E[δf(t, θ)δf(t, θ′)] −E[δf(t, θ)]E[δf(t, θ′)]
= ϵ2σ(θ)σ(θ′)E[A(t, θ)A(t, θ′)]
⇒E[δf(t, θ)δf(t, θ′)]c = ϵσ(θ)σ(θ′)D(θ, θ′)
(10.5.3)
The model’s volatility σ(t, x) = σ(θ) is given in terms of empirical volatility σE(θ)
as follows:
σ 2
E(θ) ≡E[{δf(t, θ)}2]c = ϵσ 2(θ)D(θ, θ) ⇒σ(θ) =
σE(θ)
√ϵD(θ, θ)
(10.5.4)
Noteworthy 10.2 Forward interest rate volatility σ(θ)
The deﬁning equation for σ(θ) is given by
∂f(t, x)
∂t
= α(θ) + σ(θ)A(t, θ); θ = x −t
and yields, for discrete time t = nϵ, the following:
δf(t, x) = α(θ) + ϵσ(θ)A(t, θ); θ = x −t
The volatility σ(θ) is arbitrary and is redeﬁned as follows:
σ(θ) =
1
√ϵD(θ, θ)σE(θ)

262
Forward interest rates’ quantum ﬁeld
Hence, from Eqs. 10.5.3 and 10.5.4
E[δf(t, θ)δf(t, θ′)]c = σE(θ)
D(θ, θ′)
√D(θ, θ)√D(θ′, θ′)σE(θ′)
(10.5.5)
The correlation given in Eq. 10.5.2 yields
E[δf(t, θ)δf(t, θ)]c = ϵ2σ 2(θ)1
ϵ D(θ, θ) = σ 2
E(θ)
(10.5.6)
Eq. 10.5.5 shows that the covariance is uniquely ﬁxed by the empirical volatility
σE(θ) and the model’s normalized propagator. Furthermore, Eq. 10.5.6 shows that
the volatility of the forward interest rates is given by the empirical volatility. This is
one of the strong points of the quantum ﬁeld theory model of forward interest rates,
that there is no need to ﬁt the volatility parameter but rather it is ﬁxed directly by
the empirical volatility.
10.6 Empirical forward interest rates
The expectation values determining the correlation functions are obtained by sum-
ming over historical data of the forward interest rates. Suppose historical data is
given for L days and denoted by ti = nϵ; the stochastic averages for all ﬁnancial
instruments are taken to be equal to its average over historical data.
Since the correlation functions are assumed to depend only on remaining future
time θ = x−t, one holds θ ﬁxed and sums over the L historical values of f(ti, ti+θ)
for calendar time ti = iϵ; hence, in all empirical analysis x = t + θ, and the new set
of coordinate variables is (t, θ).
From Eq. 10.5.1, the empirical values of the correlation function are determined
as follows:
δf(t, x) = f(t, x) −f(t −ϵ, x) = f(t, t + θ(t)) −f(t −ϵ, t −ϵ + θ(t −ϵ))
≡δf(t, t + θ); θ(τ) ≡x −τ

Deﬁning the normalized propagator of the model to be equal to the normalized
market covariance makes the calibration independent of σ(θ). No assumption
needs to be made regarding the form of the volatility. This is the reason for using
the normalized propagator, rather than the covariance itself, for modeling forward
interest rates. In particular, parameters such as η, μ, λ and so on, which need
calibration in quantum ﬁnance models, are ﬁtted from market data independent of
the value of σ(θ).
Eq. 10.6.4 provides the link between market correlations and the predictions
made by the model. The calibration of the model’s parameters is based on this
equation.
The empirical value of the correlation functions for the bond forward interest
rates f(t, x) are estimated from the market Libor and Euribor futures data for L(t, T)
using the approximation
L(t, T) ≃f(t, T)
The empirical Euribor normalized propagator for 1999–2004 is given in

correlated. Any two forward rates are strongly correlated – no matter how
large their separation is in maturity time – leading to the smooth surface for
the correlation shown in Figure 10.5.
There has been a signiﬁcant change in the highly correlated behavior of the for-
ward interest rates after the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. As can be seen later in Figure 11.5,
the behavior of the correlation function for 2011–2012 is comparatively irregular
with many variations that were absent in the pre-2008 behavior.
The empirically observable forward interest rates f(t, x) are assumed to depend
on future time only via the variable θ = x −t. A major innovation in quantum
ﬁnance is to introduce nonlinear future market time z(θ) in the modeling of ﬁnancial
instruments. f(t, x) is related to the quantum ﬁeld A by the following modiﬁcation
of Eq. 10.3.2:
∂f(t, x)
∂t
= α(z(θ)) + σ(z(θ))A(t, z(θ))

By incorporating market time into the model, the model’s correlation ﬁts market
data almost exactly, with error R2 = 0.96. The empirical value of the market
time index η for interest rates is usually about 0.3 and shows that future time, as
perceived by the market practitioners, slows down as the future time increases. The
ﬁt for the 2011–2012 US forward interest rates, as shown late in Figure 11.5(b), is
considerably less accurate with R2 = 0.79; this drop in the accuracy of the model
can be attributed to the irregularities in the correlation function, which probably
reﬂects competing ﬁnancial forces on the US debt market.
10.7 Time-dependent state space Vt
The Hamiltonian and the state space of a system are two independent properties
of a quantum theory; the Lagrangian and path integral are a result of these two
ingredients. The essential features of the interest rates’ Hamiltonian and state space
are reviewed; a detailed discussion is given in Baaquie (2004).
The state space of a quantum ﬁeld theory, similar to all quantum systems, is a
linear vector space – denoted by Vt – that consists of all functionals of the ﬁeld
conﬁgurations at some ﬁxed time t. The dual space of Vt – denoted by Vt,Dual –
consists of all linear mappings from Vt to the complex numbers, and is also a linear
vector space. The Hamiltonian Ht operator is an element of the tensor product space
Vt ⊗Vt,Dual and maps the state space to itself, that is,
Ht : Vt →Vt
Since x ∈[t, t + TFR] the quantum ﬁeld f(t, x) exists only for future time, that is,
for x > t. In particular, the interest rates’ quantum ﬁeld has a distinct state space Vt
for every instant t. For each time slice, the state space is deﬁned for interest rates
with x > t, as shown in Figure 10.7. The state space has a nontrivial structure due to

the underlying trapezoidal domain T of the xt space. On composing the state space
for each time slice, the trapezoidal structure for ﬁnite time, as shown in Figure 10.7,
is seen to emerge from the state space deﬁned for each time slice [Baaquie (2004)].
The state space at time t is labeled by Vt, and the state vectors in Vt are denoted
by |ft⟩. For ﬁxed time t, the state space Vt consists of all possible functions of the
interest rates, with future time x ∈[t, t + TFR]. The elements of the state space of
the forward interest rates Vt include all possible debt instruments that are traded in
the market at time t. Figure 10.7 shows the domain of the state space as a function
of time t.
In continuum notation, the basis states of Vt are tensor products over the future
time x and satisfy the following completeness equation:

(10.7.1)
The transition amplitude K for a time interval [t1, t2] as shown in Figure 10.7
can be constructed from the Hamiltonian and state space by applying the time-
slicing method. The time-dependent interest rate Hamiltonian H(t) propagates the
interest rates backward in time. The ﬁnal state |fﬁnal⟩at future calendar time t2 is
propagated backward to an initial state ⟨finitial| at the earlier time t1. In terms of the
boundary conditions given in Eq. 10.3.8, the ﬁnal and initial states, as shown in
Figure 10.7, are


t1≤s≤TFR+t1
| f(t1, s)⟩; ⟨finitial| =

t2≤s≤TFR+t2
⟨f(t2, s)|
Since the state space and Hamiltonian are both time-dependent, one has to use
the time-ordering operator T to keep track of the time dependence: H(t) for earlier

10.7 Time-dependent state space Vt

time t is placed to the left of H(t) that refers to a later time. The transition amplitude
from a given ﬁnal (coordinate basis) state | fﬁnal⟩at time t2 to an arbitrary initial
(coordinate basis) state ⟨finitial| at time t1 is given by the following [Baaquie (2004)]:
K = ⟨finitial|T

(10.7.2)
Due to the time dependence of the state spaces Vt the forward interest rates that
determine Z form a trapezoidal domain, as shown in Figure 10.7.
The connection of the transition amplitude of quantum ﬁeld theory, given by K
to the conditional probability that appears in option pricing can be indirect, as was
seen in the discussion on option theory in Section 5.10 and, in particular, given in
Eq. 5.9.3. In quantum theory, the conditional probability ∝|transition amplitude|2.
10.7.1 Bond state vector
The coupon and zero coupon bonds are important state vectors in the theory of
forward interest rates. Consider a risk-free zero coupon bond that matures at time
T with a payoff of $1. Recall from Eq. 10.2.1 that the price of a zero coupon bond
at time t < T is given by
B(t, T) = exp

−
 T

dxf(t, x)

The ket state vector |B(t, T)⟩is an element of the state space Vt. The zero coupon
bond is interpreted as an element of state space with the ket vector |B(t, T)⟩having
the coordinate representation given by
⟨ft|B(t, T)⟩= exp

−
 T

The norm of the zero coupon bond state vector is divergent since


showing that the state space of the forward interest rates is not a space of normal-
izable state vectors. In fact, the state space is much larger than the Hilbert space of
normalizable state vectors, which forms a subspace of state space Vt.
The coupon bond |B⟩is a state vector, with ﬁxed coupons of amount ci paid at
times Ti, and with a ﬁnal payoff of L at time T. In the state space language, a coupon
bond is the following linear superposition:
|B(t)⟩=

and 10.3.4, is given by
Lf(t, x) = −1

(∂f(t, x)/∂t −α(t, x)

D−1(x, x′; t; TFR)
(∂f(t, x′)/∂t −α(t, x′)
σ(t, x′)
)
−∞≤f(t, x) ≤+∞
Neumann boundary conditions, given in Eq. 10.3.8, have been incorporated into
the expression for the Lagrangian by requiring that the ﬁelds obey these conditions.
The derivation for the Hamiltonian is done for an arbitrary propagator D−1(t, x, x′),
although for most applications a speciﬁc choice is made.
Discretizing time into a lattice of spacing ϵ yields t →tn = nϵ. The Lagrangian
L(tn) is given by
L(tn) ≡

(10.8.2)
where f(tn, x) ≡ftn(x) has been written to emphasize that time tn is a parameter for
the interest rate Hamiltonian.
The Dirac–Feynman formula given in Eq. 7.4.2 relates the Lagrangian L(tn) to
the Hamiltonian operator and yields
⟨ftn|e−ϵHf |ftn+ϵ⟩= NeϵL(tn)
(10.8.3)
where N is a normalization. The Lagrangian yields the interest rate Hamiltonian
via Eq. 10.8.3.
Eq. 10.8.1 is rewritten using Gaussian integration and (ignoring henceforth irrel-
evant constants), using the notation

The propagator D(x, x′; t; TFR) is the inverse of D−1(x, x′; t; TFR).
Rescaling the variable p(x) →σ(t, x)p(x), Eqs. 10.8.1 and 10.8.2 yield (up to an
irrelevant constant)6

(10.8.7)
For each instant of time, there are inﬁnitely many independent interest rates
(degrees of freedom) represented by the collection of variables ft(x), x ∈[t, t+TFR].
The Hamiltonian is written in terms of functional derivatives in the coordinates of
the dual state space variables ft.
The degrees of freedom ft(x) refer to time t only through the domain on which the
Hamiltonian is deﬁned. Unlike the action S[f] that spans all instants of time from
the initial to the ﬁnal time, the Hamiltonian is an inﬁnitesimal generator in time,
and refers to only the instant of time at which it acts on the state space. This is the
reason that in the Hamiltonian the time index t can be dropped from the variables
ft(x) and replaced by f(x) with t ≤x ≤t + TFR.
The Hamiltonian for the forward interest rates, from Eqs. 10.8.5 and 10.8.7, is
given by
H(t) = −1

δ
δf(x)
(10.8.8)
Mσ(x, x′; t) = σ(t, x)D(x, x′; t; TFR)σ(t, x′)
The derivation only assumes that the volatility σ(t, x) is deterministic. The drift
term α(t, x) in the Hamiltonian is completely general and can be any (nonlinear)
function of the interest rates.
General considerations related to the existence of a martingale measure rule out
any potential terms for the interest rate Hamiltonian [Baaquie (2004, 2010)].7 The
dynamics is contained in the kinetic term with the function M(x, x′; t) encoding the
model chosen for the interest rates; the kinetic term for interest rates is, in general,
nonlocal in future time and does not appear in any model in physics. A wide variety
of models for M(x, x′; t) have been discussed in Baaquie (2004, 2010). The drift
term α(t, x) is completely ﬁxed by the martingale condition and, in particular, by
M(x, x′; t).
The quantum ﬁeld f(t, x) is more fundamental than the velocity quantum ﬁeld
A(t, x); the Hamiltonian cannot be written in terms of the A(t, x) degrees of
7 A potential term is a function only of f(t, x); the interest rate Hamiltonian can depend only on δ/δf(t, x).

freedom. The reason is that the dynamics of the forward interest rates is contained in
the time derivative terms in the Lagrangian, namely, the term containing ∂f(t, x)/∂t;
in going to the Hamiltonian representation, the time derivative ∂f/∂t becomes a
differential operator δ/iδf(t, x).8
10.9 Martingale: Path integral
Financial theory postulates that no ﬁnancial transaction can make a proﬁt above the
risk-free rate without an inherent risk in the transaction. This postulate is reﬂected
in the statement that there are no arbitrage opportunities in an efﬁcient ﬁnancial
market. The evolution of ﬁnancial instruments following a martingale process is
the mathematical realization of the theory of arbitrage-free pricing of ﬁnancial
instruments. A path integral and Hamiltonian formulation of the martingale process
in ﬁnance have been discussed in Baaquie (2004, 2010), and a brief summary of the
results is presented in the following two sections.
Discounting future cash ﬂows is a reﬂection of the future rates of return (time
value of money) and a numeraire is required for the discounting of future cash
ﬂows. Any ﬁnancial instrument that always has positive values can be used as a
numeraire.
From Eq. 10.5.1
E[δf(t, θ)] = ϵE[α(θ)]
The drift velocity α(θ) is ﬁxed by the martingale condition, as derived later in this
section, which results in a risk-free evolution of forward interest rates. A martin-
gale evolution yields a pricing of interest rate and bond options that is free from
arbitrage opportunities. The market drift, in contrast, carries risk and is not the one
determined by the martingale measure; hence, martingale drift α(t, x) cannot be
determined from the forward interest rates’ market data.
The martingale condition for a zero coupon bond states that the price of the
zero coupon bond B(t∗, T) at some future time T > t∗> t, when discounted from
time t∗to time t, is the equal to the bond price B(t, T). Consider the money market
numeraire exp{
 t∗
t0 dtr(t)}. For the money market numeraire future cash ﬂows are
discounted by the risk-free interest rate r(t) = f(t, t); the martingale condition
yields the following:
B(t, T) = E[e−
 t∗
t
r(t)dtB(t∗, T)]
(10.9.1)
where E[X] denotes the average value of X over all the stochastic variables in the
time interval [t, t∗].
8 If one wants to use the velocity degrees of freedom A(t, x) in the state space representation, one needs to use
the formalism of phase space quantization discussed in Baaquie (2014).

10.10 Martingale: Hamiltonian
For the case of nonlinear interest rates, the Lagrangian is nonlinear and ﬁnding the
risk neutral measure entails an exact evaluation of a nonlinear path integral – in
general, an intractable problem. For this reason, the derivation of the risk-neutral
measure for nonlinear interest rates is reformulated using the Hamiltonian.
The Hamiltonian formulation, even for the nonlinear theory of interest rates
with stochastic volatility, can provide an exact solution for the martingale measure
[Baaquie (2004)]. The drift for the nonlinear Libor market model is studied using
the Hamiltonian approach in Section 19.5 and the nonlinear Libor drift is evaluated
exactly [Baaquie (2009, 2010)].
For the case of equities and FX options, the existence of a martingale measure is
equivalent to a (risk-free) equity or FX Hamiltonian that annihilates the underlying
security S [Baaquie (2004)]. A similar condition holds for interest rate Hamiltoni-
ans, but with a number of complications arising from the nontrivial structure of the
time-dependent state space Vt and the fact that the spot rate r(t) = f(t, t) is itself a
stochastic quantity.
The martingale condition given in Eq. 10.9.2 is written in an integral form. How-
ever, similar to the case of a single security, it is clearly a differential condition since
it holds for any value of t∗. Hence take t∗= t + ϵ. The reason that one considers

10.10 Martingale: Hamiltonian

only an inﬁnitesimal change for the interest rates is because the Hamiltonian H(t) is
a differential operator. For an inﬁnitesimal evolution in time, the functional integral
in Eq. 10.9.2 collapses to an integration over the ﬁnal time variables ˜f t+ϵ on one
time slice t∗= t + ϵ. Writing f(t, x) = ft(x) yields

⇒|B(t, T)⟩= e−ϵf(t,t)e−ϵH(t)|B(t + ϵ, T)⟩
(10.10.4)
It can be veriﬁed, using the explicit representation of the zero coupon bond given
in Eq. 10.2.1, that
e+ϵf(t,t)|B(t, T)⟩= |B(t + ϵ, T)⟩
(10.10.5)
The discounting factor e−ϵf(t,t) plays the remarkable role of matching the zero
coupon bonds at two different time slices and yields the following eigenvalue
equation:
|B(t + ϵ, T)⟩= e−ϵH(t)|B(t + ϵ, T)⟩
(10.10.6)
⇒H(t)|B(t + ϵ, T)⟩= 0
(10.10.7)
There is nothing special about the bond that is being considered. Taking ϵ →0, one
arrives at the differential formulation of the risk-neutral measure: All zero coupon
bonds – and consequently all coupon bonds – are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian
H that are annihilated by H, that is, have zero eigenvalue. In symbols

10.11 Zero coupon bond option
The price of an option today, at time t, is deﬁned to be the discounted value of
the payoff function, which is settled at future time t∗. The concept of discounting
requires a discounting factor, or equivalently a numeraire. Discounting by r, the
spot interest rate yields the numeraire exp{r(t∗−t)}, which is the money market
numeraire.
The choice of a numeraire is quite arbitrary and any numeraire satisfying some
general requirement is adequate. The two most commonly used numeraires are (1)
discounting by the spot interest rate and (2) discounting using the forward bond
numeraire. The generality of choosing a numeraire is addressed in Baaquie (2010).
The property of numeraire is central to the concept of martingales.
Consider a zero coupon bond B(t, T); a call option maturing at time t∗has a
payoff, from Eq. 5.3.1, given by
P = [B(t∗, T) −K]+
To evaluate the option price C(t, t∗, K) at time t one needs to discount the payoff,
given at future time t∗, to present time t. Suppose one chooses the forward bond
numeraire using zero coupon bond B(t, t∗) as the numeraire. For the drift of the
forward interest rates given by Eq. 10.10.13, the combination C(t, t∗, K)/B(t, t∗) is
a martingale.
A salient property of martingales in option pricing is that the conditional expec-
tation value of the discounted future (random) price of the payoff is equal to its
present value; hence, since B(t∗, t∗) = 1, one has the following:
C(t, t∗, K)
B(t, t∗)
= E
(C(t∗, t∗, K)
B(t∗, t∗)

= B(t, t∗)E[(B(t∗, T) −K)+]
(10.11.2)
where P = C(t∗, t∗, K) is the payoff function.
Eq. 10.11.1 is the basis of pricing options C(t, t∗, K) written on any ﬁnancial
security. A martingale evolution of the underlying ﬁnancial security ensures that
the option price is free from arbitrage opportunities.

The expression for the price of the European option for a zero coupon bond is very
similar to the one for equity derived by Black and Scholes. The major difference
arises in the expression for the volatility q as this contains the correlation of the
volatilities σ(x, t) due to the nontrivial correlation of all the forward rates.
10.12 Coupon bonds
Cash represents present-day value, whereas bonds represent the present-day value
of future cash ﬂows. Bonds are fundamental instruments of debt; the seller of a
bond issues a promissory note to the buyer that states the seller’s (legal) obligation
to make a future payment of a certain predetermined amount. The amount equals
the payment made by the buyer today plus a component that is the return on the
bond and reﬂects the interest rate paid by the issuer of the bond.
Some of the primary ﬁnancial instruments of the national and international debt
markets are sovereign (government) and corporate bonds. Interest rates can be
derived from the market prices of bonds. Given the vast diversity of the bond
market, only those aspects of bonds are discussed that are of direct relevance to the
material covered in this book. The readers are referred to the extensive literature on
bonds [Livingstone (2005)].
Consider a coupon bond, denoted by B(t), that pays a principal of L when it
matures at time T, and pays ﬁxed dividends (coupons) ai at times Ti, i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

Figure 10.10 Coupon payments at preset future time.
The value of the coupon bond at time t < Ti is equivalent to a portfolio of zero
coupon bonds with maturities coinciding with the payment dates of the coupons.
The reason being that the two instruments have the same cash ﬂow: every coupon
payment for the coupon bond is equivalent to a zero coupon bond maturing at the
time of the payment. A fundamental theorem of ﬁnance states that any two ﬁnancial
instruments that have the same cash ﬂow are identical [Jarrow (1995)]. The proof
follows from the fact that, otherwise, arbitrage opportunities would exist for the
prices – and which is ruled out in an efﬁcient market. Quantitatively,
B(t) =
N

i=1
ciB(t, Ti) + LB(t, T)
(10.12.1)
For simplicity of notation, the time of maturity of the coupon bond is taken to be
the date of the last coupon payment, that is, T = TN.
Let B(t, Tn) be the value at time t of a zero coupon bond paying L at future time
Tn > t. The coupon bond then has the representation
B =
N

n=1
cnB(t, Tn) + LB(t, TN) =
N

i=1
aiB(t, Ti)
(10.12.2)
The ﬁnal payment is included in the sum by setting ci = ai; aN = cN + L.
A conventional coupon bond B has three key features, shown in Figure 10.10.
• The coupons cn are preﬁxed before the issuance of the bond and are paid at
preﬁxed future times Tn, usually annually or semi-annually.
• The coupon bond has a ﬁxed tenor, maturing at preﬁxed future time TN.
• The principal L is paid in a ballooning payment at future time TN.
Once the coupon bond is issued, the amount of the coupons must be paid –
regardless of the performance of the issuer. For a conventional coupon bond, the
ability of the issuer to pay the preﬁxed amount of the coupon cn is based on the
credit rating of the issuer. S&P credit ratings are given in Table 11.1 below.
10.12.1 Coupon bond yield-to-maturity y
Given the wide variety of coupon bonds, with different face values L and different
amounts and number of coupon payments ci and N, respectively, it is difﬁcult to
compare the rates of return of two different coupon bonds. For this reason, a yield-
to-maturity is deﬁned for coupon bonds and denoted by y.

10.13 Zero coupon bonds from coupon bonds
279
Coupon bond yield-to-maturity y is the annual yield such that, at time t, the
present value of the future cash ﬂows, discretely discounted yearly by y, equals
the face value of the coupon bond. For coupon bonds with N number of (annual)
payments, the yield-to-maturity is deﬁned as follows:
B(t) =
N

i=1
ci
(1 + y)i +
L
(1 + y)N
Given the values of B(t), ci and N, it is in general a nonlinear problem to evaluate y,
and is usually done numerically. Once the y value of a coupon bond is determined,
one can accurately compare it with other coupon bonds with very different cash
ﬂows. The deﬁnition of the coupon bond can be readily generalized to a yield-to-
maturity y for coupons that are paid out many times per year and so on.
From Eq. 10.12.1 one can conclude that the zero coupon bonds are the funda-
mental instruments of the bond market. If one can model the behavior of the zero
coupon bonds, one automatically has, in principle, a model for the coupon bonds.
However, as is to be expected, the coupon bond is a much more complex instrument
than the zero coupon bond.
10.13 Zero coupon bonds from coupon bonds
In this section, we discuss how to use the boot-strapping method to extract the zero
coupon bonds from coupon bonds [Baaquie et al. (2017)]. Data providers, such as
Bloomberg, every day give, labeled by t, the daily yield-to-maturity (YTM) yi(t)
for the coupon to be paid at future time Ti.9
Consider a coupon bond, denoted by CN(t). As in Eq. 19.7.1, deﬁne ℓ= 90 days.
The coupon payments can be made annually, semi-annually or quarterly, and yield
the following:
N = mn; TN = ℓmn: m = 4 annual; m = 2 semi-annual; m = 1 quarterly
Note that the maturity of the bond is given by n = TN/(ℓm), mℓis the tenor of the
coupon bond, N is the total number of coupon payments and TN is the total number
of years for the coupon bond to expire. The coupon payments are made at times
Ti = ℓmi; i = 1, 2, . . . , N
The coupon bond pays N ﬁxed coupons at time Ti = ℓmi, with the ﬁnal payment
made at time TN. The principal L is returned the end of TN years. The price of the
coupon bond is the sum of the discounted future cash ﬂows. Fix t = 0 and let
the coupon for the ith payment be ﬁxed at ci; the coupon bond has the following
expansion in terms of the zero coupon bonds:
9 Some data providers give the price of the coupon bond by varying the coupons ci so that the bond has its par
value. This case is not analyzed.

B(t, Ti) =

(1 + 1

(10.13.2)
The price of a coupon bond CN(t) = CN is written in terms of YTM y(t) = y by
the following equation:

CN(y) =
c
y/m + y/m −c/L
y/m
·
L
(1 + y/m)N
(10.13.4)
The par value of YTM is y/m = c/L and the price of the bond is then equal to its
face value L. In other words,
CN(y) = L: y = cm/L = par YTM
The data is usually given by the yield to maturity y = y(t); hence
CN(y(t)): Price of coupon bond
Each issuer of coupon bonds, whether a sovereign bonds or a corporate bonds,
has its own complete forward yield curve. The price for the coupon bond of a given
issuer is provided by the data provider by specifying all the coupons cn as well as
giving the daily price using the YTM y(t).
Consider a coupon bond with one payment of coupon c1 and let the YTM be
y(t) = y; then, from Eqs. 10.13.1 and 10.13.3
C1 =

⇒y1 = ˜y : y1 is ﬁxed
For a coupon bond with two payments, let the coupons be c1, c2 and let the YTM
be y; one has, from Eqs. 10.13.3 and 10.13.1,
c2

10.14 Forward interest rates from zero coupon bonds

Similar to above relation, once the values of y1, y2, . . . , yn−1 have been evaluated,
the value of yn can be determined recursively.
Hence, all the discounting factors, y1, y2, . . . , yn, . . . , yN can be obtained from the
price of coupon bonds C1, C2, . . . , CN with the different coupon payments given by
c1, c2, . . . , cN. We can then obtain the zero coupon bond from Eq. 10.13.2.
In general, for coupons cn and for time t in between Tm−1 and Tm, the coupon
bond price is given in terms of YTM y by the following:

Suppose that the data are given in a manner in which the maturity of the coupon
bond is always at a ﬁxed θi = t + Ti. The coupon bond then has a price, similar to
Eq. 10.13.1, at time t given by
CN(t) =

bond data are given with coupon bonds that have a ﬁxed maturity. Eq. 10.13.2 is
then modiﬁed to yield the zero coupon bond as follows:

10.14 Forward interest rates from zero coupon bonds
The forward interest rates are sometimes given directly, as is the case in the United
States. In other cases, the price of coupon bonds for different maturities is given,
from which the zero coupon bond price can be obtained as discussed in Section
10.13 and given in Eq. 10.13.2.
In this section, the forward interest rates f(t, x) are obtained from the price of
zero coupon bonds B(t, Tn) [Baaquie et al. (2017)].

• There are N conditions in Eq. 10.14.3.
• The boundary conditions given in Eqs. 10.14.4 and 10.14.5 are for points from 1
to N −1, and hence yield 2(N −1) conditions.
• One more condition is that the spot interest rate r is obtained from the market.
Using f(t, t) = r yields
f1(0) = r = a1
(10.14.6)
• The last condition is the Neumann condition at the end point, that is, f ′
N(TN) = 0;
this follows from the fact that the ﬁnal value of the interest rate is taken to be
random. Hence
f ′

(10.14.7)
In summary, from Eqs. 10.14.3, 10.14.4, 10.14.5, 10.14.6 and 10.14.7, the num-
ber of equations we have is
N + 2(N −1) + 2 = 3N
and this is sufﬁcient to ﬁx the 3N unknown parameters an, bn, cn.
There are 3N parameters and 3N linear equations. These linear equations are
written as AX = b, where the matrix A is deﬁned by Eqs. 10.14.3, 10.14.4, 10.14.5,
10.14.6 and 10.14.7. The structure of matrix A is in overlapping blocks of size
3 × 6 and organized as shown in Figure 10.12. More precisely, each block has the
following entries.
• The ﬁrst row is the continuity equation given in Eq. 10.14.4. The ﬁrst entry
A11 = 1 is due to the boundary condition given in Eq. 10.14.6. In general, there
are six entries to this row.
• The second row enters the data given in Eq. 10.14.3. In general, there are three
entries to this row.
• The third row is the condition given in Eq. 10.14.5, with four entries per row. The
last row of A encodes the boundary condition given in Eq. 10.14.7.

10.15 Summary
285
The algorithm discussed starts with N data points, and yields a ﬁt with 3N
parameters for the forward interest rates, hence obtaining a far superior result than
using only the N data points would yield. The reason is that the continuity and
differentiability of the forward interest rates was used, and in this way more infor-
mation is encoded into the ﬁt for the forward interest rates. One can, of course,

considered is sufﬁciently accurate [Adams (2001)].
10.15 Summary
The ﬁrst application of quantum ﬁeld theory to ﬁnance was in the modeling of
forward interest rates’ quantum ﬁeld f(t, x). The domain of the quantum ﬁeld is a
semi-inﬁnite trapezoid, with Neumann boundary conditions for the quantum ﬁeld.
On this domain, a stiff Gaussian Lagrangian is postulated for f(t, x), generalizing
the model proposed by Heath et al. (1992). A path integral “quantization” is postu-
lated to model the classical randomness of f(t, x).
The stiff propagator was derived and tested with market data using the US data
on the forward interest rates. It was seen that market data matches the predictions
of the model to a high degree of accuracy. Hence, empirical evidence shows that
the path integral description postulated for f(t, x) is well grounded.
Due to the trapezoidal structure of the underlying domain, a time-dependent
state space and Hamiltonian were obtained from the path integral. The martingale
condition for the ﬁeld’s evolution is required for the pricing of zero coupon bonds
to be free from arbitrage opportunities. A path integral and Hamiltonian derivation
was given of the martingale condition.
An exact derivation of options on zero coupon bonds was given using the state
space formulation. Coupon bonds are state vectors constituted by the addition of
the state vectors for zero coupon bonds. The last two sections discuss questions
close to the empirical aspects of the forward interest rates; it was shown how one
can ﬁrst extract, using the bootstrap method, the zero coupon bonds from the values
of the coupon bonds quoted in the market. And second, an efﬁcient algorithm was
discussed for obtaining accurate forward interest rates from the empirical values of
the zero coupon bonds.

Risky interest rates’ quantum ﬁelds*
11.1 Introduction
Risk-free forward interest rates [Diebold and Li (2006); Jamshidian (1991)] – and
their realization in US Treasury bonds as the leading example – have been studied
extensively. In Baaquie (2010), models of risk-free bonds and their forward interest
rates based on the quantum ﬁeld theoretic formulation of the risk-free forward
interest rates have been discussed, including the empirical evidence supporting
these models. The quantum ﬁnance formulation of risk-free forward interest rates
is extended to the case of risky forward interest rates.
The examples of the Singapore and Malaysian forward interest rates are used
as speciﬁc cases. The main feature of the quantum ﬁnance model is that the risky
forward interest rates are modeled both as a stand-alone case as well as being driven
by the US forward interest rates plus a spread – having its own term structure –
above the US forward interest rates. This chapter is largely based on the results
obtained by Baaquie et al. (2017).
Both the US forward interest rates and the term structure for the spread
are modeled by a two-dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld. As a precursor to
the evaluation of the put option of the Singapore coupon bond, the quantum
ﬁnance model for swaptions is tested using empirical study of swaptions for
the US dollar – showing that the model is quite accurate. A prediction for the
market price of the put option for the Singapore coupon bonds is obtained.
The quantum ﬁnance model is generalized to study the Malaysian case, and the
Malaysian forward interest rates are shown to have anomalies absent in the US
and Singapore cases. The model’s prediction for a Malaysian interest rate swap is
obtained.
Coupon and zero coupon bonds form the bedrock of the debt market
[Saa-Requejo and Santa-Clara (1997); Chance (1990); Jarrow and Turnbull (1995)].
Quantum ﬁnance models of risk-free coupon bonds match market data very well

cover 1975–2007; private sector local currency ratings cover 1981–2007.
[Baaquie (2010)] and so it is natural to extend the analysis to coupon bonds that
carry the issuing country’s risk of default. The possibility of default results, as is
well known, with an issuer having to pay coupons on risky bonds that are higher
than the risk-free case – the spread being determined by its rating, which is ﬁxed
by rating agencies [Merton (1974); Hui and Lo (2000)].
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) provides a rating of both sovereign and corporate
bonds on their issuance, and the rating is based on their future probability of default;
the various ratings with the probability of default are given in Table 11.1.1 From the
table it can be seen that sovereign debt in general has a lower risk of default than
private debt – except for the CCC/CC category, for which the sovereign debt’s risk
suddenly jumps.
In Sections 11.2, 11.3 and 11.4, the quantum ﬁnance models for the risk-free
and risky forward interest rates are deﬁned; the correlation functions of the models
are evaluated. The market correlator is deﬁned in Section 11.5, and the empirical
calibration of all the parameters of the model for the US, Singapore and Malaysian
forward interest rates are obtained and summarized in Sections 11.6, 11.8 and 11.9.
The swaption for the forward interest rates is deﬁned in Section 11.12 and the
US, Singapore and Malaysian markets are empirically analyzed. The results of the
chapter are summarized in Section 11.13.
The derivation of the risky coupon bond option is carried out in Section 11.10; in
Section 19.6 the equations for swaptions used in the empirical analysis are derived
from ﬁrst principles. Swaption data in the market are given in terms of Black’s
swaption formula, and a derivation of this is given in Section 19.7.

11.2 Risky forward interest rates
The risk-free US zero coupon bonds B(t, T), from Eq. 10.2.1, are determined by the
forward interest rates f(t, x) as follows:
B(t, T) = exp

−
 T

dxf(t, x)

As shown in Figure 10.2(b), let calendar time t be the vertical axis, and let the
horizontal axis x > t be future time. The shaded portion represents the forward
interest rates f(t, x): Every point in the shaded domain corresponds to one forward
interest rate.
The zero coupon bonds B(t, T) are shown in Figure 11.1 at two different cal-
endar times t0 and T0. The shaded domain shows the forward interest rates that
are bounded by the two zero coupon bonds. In the quantum ﬁnance formulation
of forward interest rates discussed in Chapter 10, the two-dimensional Euclidean
quantum ﬁeld A(t, x) is a random stochastic ﬁeld driving the forward interest rates;
the forward rates f(t, x), from Eqs. 10.3.1 and 10.4.1, are given by
∂f
∂t (t, x) = α(t, x) + σ(t, x)A(t, x)

The deterministic functions α(t, x), σ(t, x) are the drift and volatility, respec-
tively, of the forward interest rates. A(t, x) is a drift-less Gaussian quantum ﬁeld,
deﬁned on a semi-inﬁnite plane with two boundaries: one at t = t0 and the other
along x = t, as shown in Figure 10.2(b). The ﬁeld A(t, x) satisﬁes the Neumann
boundary condition given in Eq. 10.3.8:

(11.2.3)
The deterministic function β(t, x) is the drift of the risky forward interest rates
g(t, x). Due to the trapezoidal structure of the domain of the forward interest rates,
one can consistently choose
α(t, x) = α(θ); β(t, x) = β(θ); σ(t, x) = σ(θ); γ (t, x) = γ (θ)
where the remaining future time θ is deﬁned by
θ = x −t ≥0
The basic assumption of the model is that the risky forward interest rates are
driven by the risk-free forward interest rates f(t, x) – with the risky rates having a
spread above the risk-free rates. The spread is given by the quantum ﬁeld for the
spread term structure, and is denoted by ξ(t, x). The volatility of the spread is given
by the deterministic function γ (t, x) and is determined by its correlation function.
The spread also obeys the Neumann boundary condition

Note that unlike the case for commodities where ij in Eq. 6.3.6 is a con-

(x −t, x′ −t) given in Eq. 11.2.4.
11.3 Correlation functions
The auto- and cross-correlation functions of the risky and risk-free interest rates can
be computed from the correlation functions of the quantum ﬁelds A(t, x), ξ(t, x).
Using the Neumann condition for the ﬁelds A(t, x), ξ(t, x), the action given in
Eq. 11.2.4 yields, after an integration by parts and in matrix notation, the following:

The risk-free forward interest rates f(t, x) should be weakly correlated with
the risky forward interest rates g(t, x) since one does not expect, for instance, the

consistency, one expects that
|(x −t, x′ −t)| ≤0.1 ∀x −t, x′ −t

conﬁrm this expectation. All the calculations are done to O().

For equal time t = t′, note that the deﬁnition of volatilities σ, γ in the deﬁning
equations Eq. 10.3.1 and 11.2.2 can be changed up to a scaling factor. Using this
scale factor, the volatilities are redeﬁned as follows:3
σ(θ) →
σ(θ)
√ϵDE(θ, θ); σ(θ) →
σ(θ)
√ϵCE(θ, θ)

To simplify the notation, for equal time one can ignore the time index since the
correlator does not depend on it; hence, we adopt the notation

(11.5.7)
In this notation, the result given in Eqs. 11.5.4 and 11.5.5 is written as
E[δfδf]c(θ, θ′) = ϵσ(θ)DE(θ, θ′)σ(θ′);
E[δ(g −f)δ(g −f)]c(θ, θ′) = ϵγ (θ)CE(θ, θ′)γ (θ′)

11.6 Empirical volatility and propagators
All the data for the US, Singapore and Malaysian forward interest rates is daily data
taken from Bloomberg, for the period from 9 May 2011 to 18 January 2012.
The volatility of the US forward interest rates f(t, x) and of the Singapore spread
ξ(t, x) = g(t, x) −f(t, x) is determined from market data using Eqs. 11.5.8 and
11.5.9, respectively, and shown in Figure 11.2(a) and (b), respectively. Both the
volatilities are of the same order of magnitude. The volatility of the spread ξ(t, x)
follows the US case, as is to be expected since the US debt market drives the
international debt market.
Compared with earlier period (1999–2001) of volatility and kurtosis, shown in
Figure 11.3(a) and (b), of the US forward interest rates, there has been a dramatic
change. The change has taken place since – or more likely due to – the 2008
ﬁnancial meltdown, and is shown in Figure 11.3. The volatility for 2011–2012
is seen, in Figure 11.2(a), to increase indeﬁnitely as one goes to future time, as
opposed to the volatility for the 1999–2001 period, which has a maximum for future
time of about 1.5 years in the future around 2001–2002 and then levels off as one
goes into the future.
One can interpret the change of behavior of the US forward interest rates from
2000 to 2011 as implying that, unlike during the pre-2008 period, the volatility –
and hence the risk of the debt market – since 2008 has been increasing indeﬁnitely
for future time, pointing to a future that is increasingly unstable.
The test of the model is to compare the model’s correlators of the forward rates
for the risk-free and risky cases, given by D(z(θ), z(θ′)), C(z(θ), z(θ′)), with the
empirical correlators DE(θ, θ′), CE(θ, θ′). The calibration is done via the equations

One of the major advantages of the model is that the functions σ(θ), γ (θ) and
(z, z′) can be directly obtained from the empirical correlator without the need to
do any ﬁts.
11.6.1 Stand-alone Singapore rates
Consider a stand-alone model for the Singapore forward rates g(t, x), similar to the
risk-free case as in Eq. 10.3.1 and given by
∂˜g
∂t (t, x) = d(t, x) + s(t, x)B(t, x)
(11.6.1)
E[B(t, x)B(t′, x′)] = δ(t −t′)F(θ, θ′)
The Euclidean quantum ﬁeld B(t, x) has an action similar to A(t, x). The stand-alone
volatility is rescaled, and similar to Eq. 11.5.6, yields
s(θ) →
s(θ)
√ϵF(θ, θ)
Hence, empirical volatility is given by
E[(δg)2]c = s2(t, x)

E[(δ(g −f))2]c = E[(δg)2]c + E[(δf))2]c −2E[δgδf)]c

This yields
γ 2 = s2 + σ 2 −2E[δgδf)]c

Eq. 11.6.3 is shown in Figure 11.4(b), and the volatilities are consistent.

tain the accuracy of the stand-alone simpliﬁed model, and the results are given in
Table 11.2.
11.7 Calibration of US and Singapore models
The models for the US and Singapore forward interest rates are calibrated using the
empirical correlators.
The empirical value and the best ﬁt of the model are evaluated for the stand-alone
US forward interest rates as follows:
DE(θ, θ′) = E[δfδf]c(θ, θ′)
σ(θ)σ(θ′)
= D(z(θ), z(θ′))

E
.
(θ, θ′)
Note that all the matrices on the right-hand side of the above equation are empir-
ically determined. The value of E(θ, θ′) evaluated from the above equation has
large errors. The reason is that on numerically inverting DE and CE, both D−1
E and
C−1
E have large errors, of order 107. This is due to the fact that both are differential
operators, and are approximately given by the model’s values as in Eqs. 11.3.6 and
11.3.7.
Hence, instead of inverting the empirical propagators DE and CE, the empirical
inverses are replaced by the model’s value for their inverses D−1, C−1 given by

The diagonal value of (θ, θ) is near the value of 1, with the off-diagonal values
of (θ, θ′) being less than 0.4. We can tentatively conclude that our assumption of
the US and Singapore forward interest rates being weakly coupled is approximately
correct. The fact that (θ, θ) ≃1 can be due to the spread ξ(t, z) being most
strongly correlated with A(t, z) for equal future time.
11.8.1 Malaysian forward interest rates
The Malaysian forward interest rates h(t, x) are irregular, with features that are
absent for both the US and Singapore cases. The model for the Malaysian forward
interest rates and its spread over the US case is deﬁned by the following:
∂h
∂t (t, x) = m(t, x) + v(t, x)M(t, x)
(11.8.2)
∂(h −f)
∂t
(t, x) = n(t, x) + ζ(t, x)(M −A)(t, x)
(11.8.3)
The Euclidean quantum ﬁeld M(t, x) and the spread M(t, x) −A(t, x) has an action
similar to A(t, x).
The volatility function, deﬁned similar to the US and Singapore cases and
rescaled as in Eq. 11.5.6, is given by
E[(δh(t, θ))2]c = v2(θ); θ = x −t
The empirical volatility of the Malaysian forward interest rates, v2(θ), is shown in
Figure 11.10(a). A noteworthy feature is that unlike the US forward interest rates,
volatility v2(θ) plateaus after 9 years. The volatility of the spread – of the Malaysian
forward interes rates above that of the US – is given in Figure 11.10(b).
The propagator is given by the normalized correlation function (θ = x −t; θ′ =
x′ −t)

The propagator ˜H(θ, θ′) has values that are negative for future times such that
|θ −θ′| > 1.5 years, as shown in Figure 11.11(a). This implies that the forward
interest rates 1.5 years in the future move in the opposite direction to present-day
rates. Negative correlations are almost absent in both the US (only a few points
are slightly negative) and Singapore correlation functions. Whether there are any
regulations on the Malaysian debt market that are responsible for this behavior
needs to be studied.

If one studies the spread of the Malaysian forward interest rates above the US,
given by h(t, x)−f(t, x), one obtains the result given in Figure 11.11(b); the negative
correlation is alleviated a bit.
The model generates only positive-value propagators, as can be seen from the ﬁt
of the US and Singapore forward interest rates. The spread for the Malaysian can
be ﬁt by the model, but with large errors; the result is shown in Figure 11.11(c).
The R2 = 0.58 for the Malaysian spread is not a very good ﬁt, primarily because of
the negative values of the empirical propagator.

The calibration of the US, Singapore and Malaysian forward interest rates yields
the results given in Table 11.2.
The calibration for the forward interest rates has a number of key features. First,
the accuracy of the calibration of the US and Singapore stand-alone models is
comparable, with R2 equal to 0.79 and 0.74, respectively. Second, modeling the
Singapore forward interest rates as being driven by the US rates is marginally more
accurate, yielding an R2 equal to 0.80. Last, the value of market time, given by η, ω,
for the Singapore stand-alone forward interest rates is quite different from the US
rates.
The model has a fairly good ﬁt with data and
|DE(θ, θ′) −D(z(θ), z(θ′))| ≤0.19; |CE(θ, θ′) −C(z(θ), z(θ′))| ≤0.20; ∀θ, θ′
A possible conclusion from the calibration is that if one is interested in studying
the response of the Singapore forward interest rates to changes in the US forward
rates, then studying the spread is going to yield more accurate results. On the other
hand, if one is studying questions related only to the home market for Singapore
sovereign bonds, then the stand-alone model may be more appropriate.

11.10 Risky coupon bond option
305
The Malaysian-US spread ﬁt is not good, for reasons discussed earlier. The
values of the parameters are quite different from the US or Singapore case. A rather
unusual result is that b ≈0, showing that the Malaysian-US spread is near the
critical value of the system. The ﬁnancial implications of the forward interest rates
being near criticality needs to be studied further.
11.10 Risky coupon bond option
The price of the risk-free coupon bond option is more complicated than the zero
coupon bond option derived in Section 10.11, and has been evaluated in Baaquie
(2010). The derivation is generalized to the case of the risky bond.
A coupon bond is a portfolio of zero coupon bonds with ﬁxed coupons an paid
out at predetermined future times Tn = nℓ, where ℓis the tenor. From Eqs. 10.12.1
and 10.12.2, the risky coupon bond, having a principal L and maturing at future
time TN, is given by
R(t) =
N

i=1
anR(t, Tn) + LR(t, TN) ≡


i=1
cnR(t, Tn)
Let C(t) be the price of a call option at time t. A call option for the risky coupon
bond, maturing at future time t∗and with strike price K, from Eq. 5.3.1 has a payoff
function given by
C(t∗) = [R(t∗) −K]+
The price of a call option at time t is deﬁned to be the discounted value of the
conditional expectation value of the payoff function, given the value of the security
at time t, which in our case is the forward interest rates at time t given by g(t, x).
There is a wide choice of instruments that can be used for discounting future cash
ﬂows, all of which yield a martingale evolution of the underlying security. For
coupon bond options, the most suitable numeraire for discounting is the forward
bond measure, with the zero coupon bond R(t, t∗) used for discounting future cash
ﬂows. The call option, from Eq. 10.11.1, is then given by
C(t0)
R(t0, t∗) = E
( C(t∗)
R(t∗, t∗)
)
: Martingale condition
which yields, from Eq. 10.11.2, the option price at time t0 given by
C(t0) = R(t0, t∗) E[R(t∗) −K]+
(11.10.1)
Figure 11.12(a) shows the cash ﬂows for a coupon bond option that matures at a
time t∗before the bond is sold at time T0; Figure 11.12(b) is the case for t∗= T0.4
4 The caption in Figure 11.12 parenthetically refers to an interest swap as the cash ﬂows are identical to that of a
coupon bond. In Section 19.6, Figure 11.12 will be used for discussing interest rate swaps and swaptions.

Figure 11.12 The circles signify payment dates; the ﬁrst payment is at T1 and
the last payment is at TN; the coupon bond option (interest rate swap) becomes
operational at time T0. The shaded areas inside the rectangles indicate the set of
forward interest rates that determine the price of a swap. (a) A midcurve coupon
bond option (which is equivalent to a forward swap) is entered into at time t0 and
exercised at time t∗, before T0. (b) A coupon bond option (forward swap) is entered

The breakup of the coupon bond into R + V is based on the fact that all deviations
of the coupon bond from its forward price R are due to ﬂuctuations in the forward
interest rates that are controlled by its volatility σ(t, x). V has an order of magnitude
equal to O(σ)+O(γ ) and hence an expansion in power of V results in the volatility
expansion, discussed in Baaquie (2010), that one is aiming for.

requires two conditions:

(11.11.16)
Note that the integrand of Gij in Eq. 11.11.16 is over future calendar time: from
t0 to t∗. However, using the fact that the correlators depend only on θ, θ′ one can
rewrite the integral entirely in terms of the correlators evaluated from historical data
that precede time t0.
To be able to rewrite the correlator, as in Eq. 11.11.16, it is crucial that the cor-
relator such as E[δfδf]c(θ, θ′) depends only on future time θ, θ′ and not explicitly
on calendar time t. Empirical studies show that this symmetry is valid for periods
of up to 2-3 years or longer, depending on the regime of the market [Baaquie
(2010)].
11.12 Interest rate swaptions
Interest rate swaps for the US dollar and other currencies are widely traded instru-
ments. The empirical study of swaptions – options on interest rate swaps – can
be used for testing and calibrating the quantum ﬁnance models for coupon bonds
and hence of models for risky and risk-free forward interest rates. Swaptions are
discussed later in Section 19.6.
There are swaptions traded in the market in which the ﬂoating rate is paid at
intervals of ℓ= 90 days, and the ﬁxed rate payments are paid at intervals of 2ℓ=
180 days. For a swaption with ﬁxed rate payments at 90-day intervals – at times
T0+nℓ, with n = 1, 2, ..., N – there are N payments.5 For payments made at 180-day
intervals, there are only N/2 payments made at times T0 + 2nℓ, n = 1, 2, ..., N/2,
and of amount 2RS.6
Swaptions are discussed in Section 19.6 and the price of a payer paying ﬁxed
interest rates is given in Eq. 19.6.9. The payoff function for a swaption receiving
ﬁxed and paying ﬂoating rate is7
5 Suppose the swaption has a duration such that N is even. Note that for N = 4 the underlying swap has a duration
of one year.

A ≥0
0 :
A < 0
7 The price of CR for the case of 90 days’ ﬂoating and 180 days’ ﬁxed interest payments is given from CL by
using the put–call relation similar to the one in Baaquie (2010).

for the option price C(t0, t∗, K) in terms of the correlators E[δfδf]c(θ, θ′). The
correlator in turn is taken directly from the market data.
Note that the integrand of Gij in Eq. 11.12.5 is over future calendar time –
from t0 to t∗. The various domains for different values of Gij are shown in
Figure 11.15.
This symmetry of the correlator – depending on only future time θ, θ′ and not
explicitly on calendar time t – is crucial in pricing the coupon bond option (or
swaption).
11.12.1 US swaptions
A US dollar 1x10 swaption is an option on an interest swap that matures in one
year’s time and with 10 coupons in the future and is shown in Figure 11.12(b)
[Jagannathan et al. (2003)].
The US swaption is analyzed for the period 2013–2015, with the results shown
in Figure 11.16. The maturity of the swaption is taken to be t∗= 1/2 year.
Figure 11.16(a) shows the daily market value of the swaption together with the
model’s prediction. The coefﬁcient C2 is the main prediction of the model and is
shown in Figure 11.16(b). The R2 for the error of swaption’s market price compared
with the model price is 0.6 for 500 days and 0.8 for 200 days.
Recall that the expression for the US dollar put swaption, from Eq. 11.12.4, is
given by
P(t0, t∗, K) = B(t0, t∗)

C2
2π + 1

and consists of two parts: a contribution due to C2 and another contribution that
is model independent and given by (1/2)B(t0, t∗)(K −F). Both terms are of the
same magnitude and both are essential. The stochastic behavior of the swaption is

(11.12.8)
The expression of Gij in terms of the correlators is a result of the general frame-
work of the quantum ﬁnance model for forward interest rates; however, the empiri-
cal correlators themselves are model independent, and encode the full information
of the market. Using the market correlators for evaluating Eq. 11.12.8 yields more
accurate results since a speciﬁc choice of an action is calibrated against the market’s
correlators.
Singapore and Malaysian currency interest rate swaptions are not traded instru-
ments. The price of a swaption given in Eq. 11.12.4 can be used to generate the
model’s predictions on the value of the Singapore and Malaysian swaptions, and is
shown in Figure 11.17(a) and (b).
The Singapore swaptions – for modeling both the spread of the Singapore for-
ward interest rates above the US forward interest rates as well as for the stand-alone
Singapore forward interest rates – are seen to follow the US swaption values. As can
be seen from Figure 11.17(a), whenever the Singapore swaption value deviates from
the US swaption, the value of the Singapore swaption changes and criss-crosses the
US swaption value. It is logical to expect that the US swaption market should drive
the value of Singapore swaption, given that the US swaption is the most liquid
instrument and has the greatest range of maturities and coupon payments.
11.12.3 Malaysian swaptions
The model’s ﬁt for the Malaysian forward interest rates, discussed in Section 11.8.1,
is not very good with R2 = 0.58; the general framework of quantum ﬁnance
nevertheless can still be applied to the Malaysian case. The reason is that the

speciﬁc form of the action chosen in Eq. 11.2.4 is not necessary, and instead one
can start with a generic propagator for the action denoted by H−1(θ, θ′) without
specifying its dependence on θ, θ′. One can generalize the action given in Eq. 11.2.4

where M(t, x) −A(t, x) yields the spread of the Malaysian over the US forward
interest rates.
The earlier analysis for the price of the swaption goes through and one only needs
to empirically evaluate the propagator H(θ, θ′). Gij given in Eq. 11.12.8, required
for pricing a swaption, is evaluated empirically and hence the expression of Gij can
be evaluated in terms of the empirical correlators. Evaluating Gij empirically for the
Malaysian swaption, and the quantum ﬁnance model’s prediction for the Malaysian
swaption, using the Malaysian empirical propagator, is given in Figure 11.17(b).
Malaysia 1 is the result for the stand-alone Malaysian forward interest rates
and Malaysia 2 being the rates driven by the US forward interest rates.
The Malaysian swaption seems to be fairly insensitive to the movements of
the US swaption, which can be attributed to the Malaysian debt market being

318
Risky interest rates’ quantum ﬁelds
decorrelated from the US debt market. The Malaysian swaption’s price is always
much higher than the US swaption, which can be explained by the higher risk of
Malaysian swaptions compared with the US sovereign swaptions.
11.13 Summary
The study of risky coupon bonds reveals many new features of the forward interest
rates of emerging markets, of which Singapore is one of the more robust exam-
ples. The Singapore forward interest rates were studied both as stand-alone and as
being driven by the US forward interest rates. The empirical study shows that both
approaches give reasonable results.
The modeling of the Singapore forward interest rates by a spread over the US
extends the quantum ﬁnance formulation of forward interest rates to the study of
two coupled forward interest rates as given by the action in Eq. 11.2.4, with the
coupling  being small. This allows one to study the two rates perturbatively. The
extension of the martingale condition for two coupled forward interest rates leads
to new terms for the drift, as in Eq. 11.11.9, that couple the two forward interest
rates through the spread of the Singapore forward interest rates.
The result of the empirical calibration shows that modeling the Singapore for-
ward interest rates by a spread over the US is more in line with the parameters of
the US rates, in contrast to the value of market time index η from the calibration of
the stand-alone Singapore forward interest rates.
The Malaysian forward interest rates have anomalies not present in the US or the
Singapore cases; for this reason, an accurate ﬁt of the model could not be obtained
for the Malaysian case. However, one can extend the model, as discussed in Section
11.12.3, by using the quantum ﬁnance framework of an action functional and path
integrals, by letting the propagator in the action be determined empirically. Such a
generalization of the quantum ﬁnance framework allows one to study the Malaysian
forward interest rates and to price its options – such as the interest rate swaptions
and coupon bond call and put options.
In summary, if one is concerned with only the home market, one can model the
forward interest rates as a stand-alone case and ignore its coupling to the inter-
national debt market. However, if an emerging economy wants to issue sovereign
debt in the international capital markets, it is more consistent with the international
market to model the emerging market’s debt market as being driven by a spread
over the US debt markets.

Bonds: Index-linked stochastic coupons*
12.1 Introduction
A bond with index-linked stochastic coupons is deﬁned using the mathematical
framework of quantum ﬁnance. The discussion is based on the results obtained in
Baaquie (2017). The coupons are stochastic, with the quantum of coupon payments
depending on a publicly traded index. The index is chosen to reﬂect the primary
drivers of the revenues of the issuer of the bond. The index ensures there is infor-
mation symmetry and parity regarding the amount of coupon being paid – between
issuer and investor. The dependence of the coupon on the index is designed so
that the variation of the index mirrors the changing fortunes of the issuer, with the
coupon’s quantum increasing for increasing values of the index and, conversely,
decreasing with a fall of the index.
The index-linked coupon bond with market-linked stochastic coupons is an
example of an index-linked sukuk. The index-linked sukuk is an instrument that
implements one of the cornerstones of Islamic ﬁnance [Askari et al. (2012)]: that an
investor must share in the risk of the issuer so as to earn proﬁts from the investment.
The ﬁxed coupon bond, discussed in Section 10.12, is generalized to the case
where the coupons are stochastic. The framework of path integrals, state space
and the Hamiltonian operator is used to deﬁne the index-linked coupon bonds
with stochastic coupons. The future stochastic quantum of payments needs to
be discounted to yield the present value of the coupon. A speciﬁc payoff is
proposed to relate the payment of the coupons to an index, with the evolution
of the index being stochastic; the present expected value of the stochastic coupon is
derived.
The zero coupon bonds that constitute a coupon bond are modeled using forward
interest rates quantum ﬁeld discussed in Chapter 10. The coupon bond with the
embedded stochastic coupon is shown to obey the martingale condition. The price
of the index-linked coupon bond is determined in terms of the parameters of the
319

320
Bonds: Index-linked stochastic coupons
model. The call option price for the index-linked coupon bond is obtained as a
perturbation expansion in terms of the volatility of the discounting zero coupon
bonds. It is shown that the option price obeys put–call parity.
Consider the case of an issuer, such as a company extracting and selling oil, with
a varying and volatile ﬁnancial state. The issuer would prefer to issue a coupon bond
with the amount of coupon varying with the performance of the issuer. The coupon
in effect would be stochastic, depending on the uncertain future performance of the
issuer.
A coupon bond with stochastic coupons, in many ways, is similar to an equity
instrument and fulﬁlls the requirements of a risk-sharing partnership [Askari et al.
(2012)]. However, such a bond is still a debt instrument and this is preferred by
many issuers – since a debt instrument does not permanently dilute the ownership
of an enterprise.
A transparent criterion is required for ﬁxing the varying quantum of the coupon
payments. The proﬁt and loss (P&L) of the issuing enterprise is not a suitable
criterion since only the issuer knows the full information pertaining to the P&L –
with the investor being largely in the dark. This is the so called ‘agency’ problem
in ﬁnance [Merton (1974)].
The criterion for ﬁxing the coupon’s quantum must not have any information
asymmetry, with the issuer and the investor having the same information regarding
the varying quantum of the coupon. One choice for the criterion of the varying
coupon amount is that the quantum of coupon paid is determined by the market
price of the primary drivers of revenues of the company. In case of an oil company,
the natural index is the price of oil. This criterion works ideally for commodity-
based companies as well companies that generate their revenue from the sale of
publicly listed goods and services. For these reasons, the varying payment of the
coupons can be tied to an index, denoted by S(t), that has a publicly listed price,
such as Brent crude for oil: the quantum of coupon cn on the date of the payment
Tn would be determined by the value of the index on that date, given by S(Tn), or
the average of a ﬁxed number of preceding days.
In summary, for an index-linked coupon bond, the amount of the coupons is
uncertain and stochastic; however, similar to the conventional coupon bonds, the
coupons would continue to be paid at the preﬁxed future times Tn, and with a
ballooning payment on expiry of the coupon bond at time TN.
The coupon bond is traded in the capital market; hence the value of the coupon
varies with time and is indicated by cn(t). A precise connection of the index-linked
coupon cn(t) with the market index S(t) is required. A model is proposed in Section
12.2, and yields
cn(t) = cn(S(t), t, Tn)
The price of the coupon bond at time t is given by

where the derivation of the d(S(t), t, TN) term is given later in Eq. 12.4.5.
12.2 Stochastic coupon’s payoff function
Suppose the coupon is to be paid at future time Tn. The coupon is expected to vary
smoothly with changes in S. Doing a Taylor expansion when the coupon matures,
we expect the coupon payoff function to be
cn(t, S(t)) = pL + β(S(t) −S(Tn, )) + · · · : t ≃Tn
Two additional factors need to be incorporated into the payoff function. There
should be a ﬂoor, so that investors are guaranteed that the coupons are never neg-
ative; and a ceiling is required for the issuer to be protected against “black swan”
events. Hence, a model for the stochastic coupon’s payoff function that incorporates
the required features is given by
g(S) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
pL:
S ≤K1
pL + β(S −K1):

In the language of options, the payoff function is a bull spread, being long with a
call option on S with strike K1 and short with a call option with strike K2.
The following parameters (not all independent) of the coupon payoff function
need to be ﬁxed:
pL, pu, K1, K2, β.
• pL is a ﬂoor and the minimum coupon that is acceptable to investors.
• pU is the maximum coupon that the issuer is willing to pay. It could be pegged to
the credit rating of the issuer.
• K1, K2 is the maximum allowed variation of the index S before hitting the coupon
ﬂoor or the ceiling. Suppose the coupon bond is launched at some date t0 and let
the average of S (for say the past 100 days or less or more) be ¯S, with volatility
given by σI. Then one choice is
K1 = ¯S −σI; K2 = ¯S + σI
(12.2.2)
One can choose to vary the range of K1, K2 from ±σI to ±3σI.
• With this choice of parameters given in Eq. 12.2.2, β is ﬁxed and given by
S > K2
⇒pU = pL + 2βσI
⇒β = pU −pL

The change in the payoff δg due to δS change in the index is a maximum for changes
of S near its average value ¯S = $66. For S far from ¯S the cosh2((x −m)/s) term
makes the change in the hedged portfolio negligible. Hence, one only needs to hedge
the coupon for values of S that are far from ¯S.
12.3 Stochastic coupon’s pricing kernel
The payoff function given in Eq. 12.2.1 ﬁxes the value of the coupon cn(t) at a future
time Tn > t. The prices of the stochastic coupons are determined by the dynamics
of the underlying index S(t).
To obtain the value of the coupon at an earlier time t, the coupon payoff function
has to be evolved backward in time through remaining time Tn −t. The value of the
payoff function at earlier time t is mathematically identical to an option with the
payoff function g(S); for this reason, the terminology of option theory will be used.
One might be tempted to use the Black–Scholes option framework for deﬁning
the dynamics of S(t) using white noise, but in most cases this would not be use-
ful. The reason is that the Black–Scholes option framework requires the implied
volatility of S(t), which in turn is taken from the traded prices of the options on
S(t). In the case of an index based on the price of a commodity or some other

12.3 Stochastic coupon’s pricing kernel
325
instrument that does not have options that are traded in the market, the option price
and, subsequently, the price of the stochastic coupon cannot be determined.
Instead of the Black–Scholes equation, the evolution of the index is modeled
using a more general quantum ﬁnance model Hamiltonian. It has been shown in
Section 5.13 that the BY-option pricing model depends on the value of the security
S(t) and its derivative dS(t)/dt and does not need the implied volatility surface
for pricing the options on S(t); in particular, the option price does not require the
implied volatilty surface but instead requires only the time series of the market
prices of the underlying index S(t) [Baaquie et al. (2014a)].
No empirical applications are made in this chapter; the Hamiltonian is chosen
purely for its mathematical structure that requires a state space which depends on
both the degree of freedom S(t) and its velocity dS(t)/dt. This leads to results that
are more general than using the Black–Scholes type Hamiltonian which depends
only on the degree of freedom S(t).
Introduce the notation
S(t) = exp x(t);
˙S = dS
dt ; v = −dx
dt = −
˙S
S; τ = T −t
For every coupon cn, the payoff at the time of maturity Tn has to be discounted
over a time interval Tn −t to present time t. Since the time of maturity Tn
changes from coupon to coupon, denote the discounting interval by remaining
time τ = Tn −t.
The present value of the payoff, at time t, is given by C(x, v; τ) and depends on
both x, v. In Dirac’s notation, the option is a ket vector given by
|C(τ)⟩; C(x, v; τ) = ⟨x, v|C(τ)⟩
Similar to the Black–Scholes–Schr¨odinger partial differential equation for the
option prices given in Eq. 5.4.1, the evolution equation of the option is given by
∂|C(τ)⟩
dτ
= −H|C(τ)⟩⇒|C(τ)⟩= exp{−τH}|P⟩: τ = T −t

P(x, v) = ⟨x, v|P⟩

C(x, v, τ) = ⟨x, v|C(τ)⟩= ⟨x, v| exp{−τH}|P⟩
(12.3.2)

Bonds: Index-linked stochastic coupons

⇒cn(x, v; Tn −t) = ⟨x, v|cn; Tn −t⟩= ⟨x, v|e−(Tn−t)H|g⟩
(12.3.3)
and
|d; TN −t⟩= e−(TN−t)H|h⟩
⇒d(x, v; Tn −t) = ⟨x, v|d; TN −t⟩= ⟨x, v|e−(TN−t)H|h⟩
(12.3.4)
The index-linked coupon bond given in Eq. 12.3.4 is very general, where one
can design the coupon by one’s choice by choosing the appropriate payoff function
|g⟩as well as the Hamiltonian H to suit the index. A speciﬁc choice is made in this
chapter to illustrate the general results, but in fact all the derivations hold for an
arbitrary choice of payoff function and Hamiltonian.
The Black–Scholes Hamiltonian given in Eq. 5.6.3 needs to be extended for
deﬁning the discounting of the stochastic coupon’s payoff function. The evolution
of the index is modeled by the following quantum ﬁnance Hamiltonian discussed
in Chapter 4:
˜HI = −1
2a
∂2
∂v2 −v ∂
∂x + bv2 + 1
2cx2
(12.3.5)
The evolution equation of the index in general can have a drift, and to accommo-
date this the Hamiltonian of the index is deﬁned by the following:
HI = e−2bjx ˜HIe2bjx + bj2
(12.3.6)
From Eqs. 12.4.4 and 12.3.6, the pricing kernel, also called the evolution kernel, is
given by
K(x, v; x′, v′; τ) = ⟨x, v| exp{−τHI}|x′, v′⟩
= e−bj2τ⟨x, v|e−2bjx exp{−τ ˜H}e2bjx|x′, v′⟩
= e−bj2τ−2bjx+2bjx′⟨x, v| exp{−τ ˜H}|x′, v′⟩
Using the the completeness equation given in Eq. 4.1.2, the evolution kernel obeys
the following composition law:
K(x, v; x′, v′; τ + τ ′) = ⟨x, v| exp{−(τ + τ ′)HI}|x′, v′⟩

(12.3.9)
12.4 State space and Hamiltonian
The index Hamiltonian HI and the forward interest rates Hamiltonian Hf, discussed
in Section 10.8, together determine the time evolution of the bond that has stochas-
tic coupons. The total Hamiltonian for the index-linked coupon bond is given by
H = HI ⊕Hf
The state space is given by the tensor product of the index state space and the
forward interest rates state space:
V = VI ⊗Vf
The bond with stochastic coupons is an element of V.
The forward interest rates f(t, z) exist only for the future and hence z ≥t, and
hence yields a triangular domain. The triangular semi-inﬁnite domain on which
the forward interest rates are deﬁned is shown in Figure 12.3; the triangular domain

Noteworthy 12.1 Bond state space notation
A zero coupon bond B(t, Tn), as shown in Figure 11.1, extends in the future time
direction over the interval t ≤x ≤Tn. The label t denotes the time-dependent state
space to which it belongs to. Hence, the state vector that denotes B(t, Tn) must carry
both the index t and Tn. The zero coupon bond state vector and its components, as
in Eq. 12.4.2 – using the dual basis vectors ⟨f; t| – are given by
|Bn(t)⟩; B(t, Tn) = ⟨f; t|Bn(t)⟩= exp

The notation is a bit repetitive with the time label t appearing for both the dual basis

for clarity.

Eqs. 12.2.1 and 12.2.3 provide a generalization of the ﬁxed coupon bond (given
in Eq. 12.4.3) to a bond with stochastic coupons. As shown in Figure 12.3, the
future stochastic payments of the coupons are indicated by solid circles and paid
at t = Tn; the future payments are discounted, shown by the straight line, to future
time z = Tn at calendar time t0. The index-linked coupon bond is written as3

(12.4.5)
To see the necessity of introducing the coefﬁcient |d; TN −t⟩, consider t = TN
when the bond matures. Eq. 12.4.4 yields the expected result (L = 1):
B(TN) = (⟨fN|⟨SN|)B(TN)⟩=

⟨SN|g⟩+ ⟨SN|h⟩

⟨fN|BN⟩
= (cN + 1)B(TN, TN) = cN + 1
since
⟨SN|g⟩= cN; ⟨SN|h⟩= 1
For the index-linked coupon bond there is no discounting factor of
exp{−r(Tn−t)} for cn(x, v; Tn −t) – unlike a stand-alone option such as the call
option given in Eq. 5.8.2. This is because the discounting of the future coupon
payment is due to the time value of money, which is accounted for by the zero
coupon bond as shown in Eq. 12.4.5. In Figure 12.4, the discounting of the future

12.5 Evolution kernel: Feynman path integral
The evolution kernel is called the transition amplitude in the framework of the path
integral; it is given by the matrix element of the Hamiltonian operator [Baaquie
(2014)]:
K(x, v; x′v′; τ) = ⟨x, v|e−τHI|x′, v′⟩
(12.5.1)
where
v = −˙x = dx
dt ; ¨x = d2x
dt2
In addition to Eq. 12.5.1, the evolution kernel K(x, v; x′v′; τ) has another
representation discussed in Section 4.4. The evolution kernel is deﬁned by the
(Euclidean) Feynman path integral over all possible values (paths) x(t) of the
security – from its initial value x′, ˙x′ at time τ = 0 to its ﬁnal value of x, ˙x at time τ.
More precisely,
K(x, v; x′v′; τ) =

The boundary conditions for all the allowed paths in the Feynman path integral

x(0) = x′, ˙x(0) = −v′; x(τ) = x, ˙x(τ) = −v
(12.5.3)
The Hamiltonian given in Eq. 12.3.6 yields, from Eq. 4.4.3, the following

The moduli space of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian is given by all possible real
values of a, b, c. The three branches of the theory, namely the real, complex and
critical branch, are given by Eq. 4.1 [Baaquie (2014)].
For the parametrization of the Lagrangian chosen in Eq. 12.5.4, Section 4.4 and
Eq. 4.4.27 yield the following result for the evolution kernel:
K(x, v; x′, v′, τ) = NeSc(x,v;x′,v′;τ)
Sc(x, v; x′, v′, τ) = −1

Section 4.4 has the explicit expressions for the coefﬁcient functions Mij [Baaquie
and Yang (2014)]. The model for the index is calibrated to ascertain coefﬁcients
a, b, c, j using the unequal time auto-correlation functions of the index; the model’s
correlation functions are obtained using the path integral and discussed at length in
Chapter 6.
12.6 Price of stochastic coupons
The payoff function for the stochastic coupons does not depend on dS/dt and hence
is independent of v = −˙x. The marginal evolution kernel is formed by integrating
out v′ and is given by
K(x, v; x′; τ) =

dv′K(x, ˙x; x′, v′; τ)
The value of the stochastic coupon is given by
cn(x, v; Tn −t) =

Eq. 12.2.3 yields h(x, v) = ⟨x, v|h⟩= 1; hence

C(x, v, K; τ) =

dx′dv′K(x, v; x′, v′; τ)[ex′ −K]+; τ = T −t
(12.6.2)
The payoff function given in Eq. 12.2.1 yields

+ β[C(x, v, K1; Tn −t) −C(x, v, K2; Tn −t)]
(12.6.3)
The discounted coupon’s price is given in terms of the “option price” C(x, v, K; Tn−
t), and follows from Eq. 12.6.2. Writing out the expression for the index-linked
coupon bond given in Eq. 12.4.5 yields

The ﬁrst term depends only on pL and the last term depends on the strike prices
K1, K2 of the stochastic coupon. The price of the coupon bond varies with time and
can be traded at any time before the coupon bond expires at time TN. Eq. 12.6.4 is
the coupon bond price that can be studied empirically.
12.7 Martingale condition
To complete the pricing of the coupon bond, the zero coupon bonds need to be
modeled. As discussed extensively in Chapter 10, the zero coupon bonds B(t, Tn)
are expressed in terms of the forward interest rates f(t, z), where t is calendar
time and z is future time (Note the notation that z is not market time as given in
Eq. 10.6.5). The dynamics of f(t, z) is given by Eq. 10.3.1 as follows:

12.7 Martingale condition
333
∂f
∂t (t, z) = α(t, z) + σ(t, z)A(t, z); t ≥t0
(12.7.1)
The deterministic functions α(t, z), σ(t, z) are the drift and volatility, respec-
tively, of the forward interest rates. It is shown later in Eq. 12.7.4 that the drift
is determined by the martingale condition. A(t, z) is a drift-less Gaussian quantum
ﬁeld [Baaquie (2004)]. The Gaussian quantum ﬁeld A(t, z) is deﬁned by its auto-
correlation function
E[A(t, z)A(t′, z′)] = δ(t −t′)D(z −t, z′ −t)
The forward interest rates f(t, z) and quantum ﬁeld A(t, z) are both deﬁned on a
triangular domain, as shown in Figure 12.3, consisting of a semi-inﬁnite plane with
two boundaries: one at t = t0 and the other along x = t. The initial value f(t0, z) of
the yield curve at time t0 is taken from the market.
For the index-linked coupon bond price B(t) to be free from arbitrage oppor-
tunities, it must satisfy the martingale condition. The discussion in Section 10.9
is repeated, but this time for the coupon with stochastic coupons. One can choose
from a wide range of numeraires; the forward bond numeraire B(t, t∗) is chosen
since it is suitable for later discussion on coupon bond options maturing at future
time t∗.
The martingale condition, from Eq. 10.11.1, states that the future expectation
value of a martingale is equal to its present value. Writing the martingale condition
in terms expectation value E[..], yields (t∗≥t)
B(t, Tn)
B(t, t∗) = E

(12.7.2)

state space formulation, the martingale condition given in Eq. 12.7.2 has a Hamil-
tonian realization given in Eq. 10.10.12 and yields the following:

As shown in Eq. 12.7.7, maturity time t∗of the option cancels out in the discounting
of the stochastic coupon’s payoff function.
Hence, from Eq. 12.7.7, the index-linked coupon obeys the martingale condition
given in Eq. 12.7.3. Figure 12.5 shows how the discounting of the coupon from t∗to
Tn combines with the value of the coupon at time t∗to yield the value of the coupon
at time t0.
Eq. 12.7.7 shows that, given the manner in which the stochastic coupons are
deﬁned, the martingale condition is obeyed independent of the choice of the zero
coupon Hamiltonian HI. In fact, the martingale condition depends only on the

forward interest rates having a martingale evolution; hence the drift for the forward
interest rates given in Eq. 12.7.4 – derived for the zero coupon bonds having a
martingale evolution – is sufﬁcient to yield a martingale evolution even for the
index-linked coupon bond.
Moreover, Eq. 12.7.7 yields

and we have recovered the expression for the index-linked coupon bond given in
Eq. 12.4.5.
A number of points regarding the index-linked coupon bond can now be clariﬁed.
• The discounting of the future value of the stochastic coupon to its present-day
value is not by itself a martingale process. The reason is that this discounting
is of the value of the stochastic coupon and not of the time value of the future
coupon payment. Instead, discounting by the zero coupon bond B(t, Tn) accounts
for the time value of money of the future coupon payment at time Tn, given by
cn(x, v; Tn −t).
• It is only due to the embedding of the stochastic coupon in the coupon bond that
the martingale condition for the entire bond is fulﬁlled.
• The determination of the future stochastic coupon payments by the operator
exp{−(Tn −t)HI} is crucial for the coupon bond to obey a martingale evolution.
A martingale evolution for the index-linked coupon bond is possible only if a
Hamiltonian deﬁnes the discounting of the stochastic coupon’s payoff function.

336
Bonds: Index-linked stochastic coupons
• The martingale condition is obeyed by the entire coupon bond B as a single
instrument. That is the reason the ballooning payment needs to be altered by
the factor of d(x, v; TN −t), since the operator exp{−(Tn −t)HI} is applied to
entire coupon bond B. If the coefﬁcient of the ballooning payment is held to be a
constant, the martingale condition cannot be met.
• It is crucial to understand that the discounting of the stochastic coupon does not
give an option; this is the reason that the discounting of the stochastic coupon is
not a martingale.
• The Baaquie–Yang option pricing model discussed in Section 5.10 is based on
the same acceleration Hamiltonian as the one being used for the discounting
of the stochastic coupon and given in Eq. 12.3.6. However, the Hamiltonian
is employed, in Section 5.10, to generate a conditional probability that is sig-
niﬁcantly different from the evolution kernel; the conditional probability only
partially fulﬁlls the martingale condition.
12.8 Option for index-linked coupon bond
Options for index-linked coupon bonds are necessary for hedging the coupon bonds
as well as creating a secondary market for these bonds. A secondary market would
create greater liquidity for the instrument and hence lead to its accurate pricing.

12.8 Option for index-linked coupon bond
337
In the Hamiltonian formulation, the option price is given by discounting the pay-
off function using the Hamiltonian, with the drift ﬁxed by the martingale condition.
Using the forward bond numeraire, the present-day price of a call option on a bond
with stochastic coupons is given by
|CI(t∗−t0)⟩= B(t0, t∗)e−(t∗−t0)(HI+Hf )|P; t∗⟩

Note that the correlation of the coupons given by Pmn(x, v; t∗, t0) is determined by
the payoff function |g⟩and the Hamiltonian HI. Hence, it can be fully determined
at time t0.
The coefﬁcient C2 requires the following.
• The value of f(t0, z), the forward interest rates at t0 are taken from the market for
determining Fm(t∗, t0).
• The value of the stochastic coupon bonds cm(x, v; Tn −t0) requires x, v – which
are determined from the value of the index and its velocity at time t0.
• The correlator Pmn(x, v; t∗, t0) is ﬁxed by the model.
• The forward interest rate correlator E[δfδf]c(θ, θ′) is empirically determined
from the market data for zero coupon bonds.

12.10 Summary
The bond with index-linked stochastic coupons is a distinct asset class and expands
the instruments available for the debt market. Given the diversity of ﬁnancial
requirements of various enterprises, the index-linked coupon bond can serve to
provide greater ﬂexibility for enterprises taking on debt.
In an environment of increasing volatility, the bond with index-linked coupons
could be a useful instrument to stabilize the real economy. Commodity-producing
enterprises would have a built-in mechanism against the formation of a commod-
ity bubble, since higher commodity prices would entail higher payments for the
coupons.
The index-linked coupon bond has features that beneﬁt both the issuer and
investor. The primary advantage of the instrument is that there is no information
asymmetry between investors and issuers, thus increasing the attractiveness of
the instrument to the investors. The index-linked coupon bond, on the one hand,
provides investors with an instrument that allows them to proﬁt from an upturn of
the index and, on the other hand, allows the issuer to reduce the risk of paying a
high value of coupons during a downturn. There is a fair amount of ﬂexibility in
the design of the coupons, since the payoffs can be customized to suit the needs of
both the issuer and the investors.
Put and call options on index-linked coupon bonds would be useful in hedging
the instrument as well as creating greater liquidity by the issuer offering a put option
for the investor to exit from the index-linked coupon bond.
The index-linked coupon bond is a concrete realization of a ﬁnancial instru-
ment that minimizes risk and allows risk-sharing between issuer and investor. The
instrument has many key features of Islamic ﬁnance. The index-linked coupon
bond increases the range of instruments available for investors in Islamic ﬁnancial
instruments and helps to develop a greater depth for the Islamic capital markets
[Askari et al. (2012)].
Given the large variations in the price of oil, the price of the index-linked coupon
bond is expected to have large variations due to the strong correlation between
the index and the quantum of the coupon payment. The index-linked coupon is

344
Bonds: Index-linked stochastic coupons
a mechanism for the investor to go long on the index, but without the necessity
of hedging due to the coupons having a ﬂoor and ceiling; furthermore, unlike a
futures position on the underlying index, the investor is guaranteed the return of the
principal amount, and at a ﬁxed time in the future.
The index-linked coupon can be deﬁned for the case of the index having stochas-
tic volatility using the Merton–Garman Hamiltonian [Baaquie (2004)]. For the case
of jump-diffusion process being obeyed by the index, a Hamiltonian formulation
needs to be given of these processes. The analysis can be further extended to the
case where not only are the quanta of the coupon payments stochastic, but the
payments of the principal as well as the tenor of the coupon bond are also stochastic.
Such an instrument that has stochastic coupons, stochastic tranches for the payment
of the principal and a stochastic tenor is a debt instrument that is a representation
of the sukuk, a debt instrument of Islamic ﬁnance [Ghauri (2012)].

Operator expectation and S matrix
13.1 Introduction
The path integral representation of the quantum ﬁeld, discussed in Section 7.4, is
primarily used for computing the correlation functions of the quantum ﬁeld, which
are given by the expectation value of products of the quantum ﬁeld at different
spacetime points. The entire dynamics of the quantum ﬁeld is determined by the
action and Lagrangian of the system that yields the correlation functions; there is
apparently no sign of the underlying state space and Hamiltonian.
The interpretation of the correlation functions depends on the theory being stud-
ied. In high energy physics, the correlation functions are related to the scattering
cross-section of the underlying particles; for a system undergoing a phase transition,
the correlation functions yield the critical indices.
It is shown in Section 13.2 how the correlation functions are constructed out
of an underlying state space and Hamiltonian. In general, a functional integral
need not necessarily have any connection with an underlying state space. One of
the salient features of the Feynman path integral is this connection between path
integral, Hamiltonian and state space.
In Section 13.3, the scattering matrix, called the S-matrix, is analyzed. The
S-matrix is an operator that relates incoming states, with a given number of particles
with varied momenta that scatter off each other and result in outgoing states with
different numbers of particles with changed momenta. The S-matrix is an operator
on the state space of the quantum ﬁeld; it is shown in this chapter how all the matrix
elements of this operator for a scalar ﬁeld can be obtained from the correlation
functions. The discussion can be generalized in a straightforward manner to vector
gauge ﬁelds and spinor ﬁelds.
The idea of the S-matrix and scattering is deeply rooted in high energy experi-
ments, with all accelerators designed to carry out scattering experiments. However,
the reason for inclusion of this chapter is not for analyzing scattering experiments.

Operator expectation and S matrix
Instead, the S-matrix shows how states in Fock space that are related to other states
by the S-matrix can be extracted from the correlation functions – and which in turn
can be computed using the path integral. The concepts related to the S-matrix are
a major and general feature of the mathematics of quantum ﬁelds; these concepts
can be useful in other applications where elements of a state space are mapped into
other states – of course, with an interpretation that need not refer to ideas drawn
from scattering.

In general, for

one needs to time order the operators by hand before converting the matrix element
into a functional integral.

|⟩= E[ϕ(t1, ⃗x1) · · · ϕ(tN, ⃗xN)]; t1 > · · · > tN
(13.2.4)
Time-ordering is built into the path integral due to the fact that ϕH(t, ⃗x) are
Heisenberg operators that are transformed into integration variables; this very
special property of the functional integral is due to the state space that underpins
the Feynman path integral and leads to the time-ordering of Heisenberg operators.
13.3 S matrix: Deﬁnition
One of the main themes of this book is the analysis of the correlation functions.
In particular, the entire discussion of renormalization is focused on the behavior of
the correlation functions. The S matrix in high energy physics is obtained from the
correlation functions, and this key result is derived.1
There are two major objectives of high energy particle physics.
• The determination of the masses of elementary particles is a major consideration
in high energy physics.
• The Standard Model has three generations of fermions and all their masses have
been experimentally determined.
• The masses of hadrons (mesons and baryons), which are the bound states of
quarks and gluons, need to be computed. This requires the Hamiltonian formula-
tion of the quark–gluon quantum ﬁeld, called quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
The masses of the hadrons entail studying the state space, and in particular the
eigenstates, of QCD.
• Another major branch of high energy physics is the study of high energy colli-
sions, with a number of incoming particles colliding and scattering off each other;
the resulting outgoing particles can have momenta and numbers different from the
incoming particles. Figure 13.2 is an illustration of a scattering event.
• Scattering experiments are the focus of all high energy accelerators. The collision
can change the number and momenta of the incoming particles and elaborate
1 I thank Wang Qinghai for many fruitful and enlightening discussions on this topic.

13.4 Incoming and outgoing states
351
Incoming particles
Outgoing particles
Figure 13.2 Incoming state of m particles being scattered in the interaction
region – denoted by the dark ellipse – into an outgoing state of n particles.
quantum ﬁeld theories have been developed to calculate the predictions for the
outgoing particles.
• The transition amplitude for the scattering process of m incoming particles into n
outgoing particles is given by the S-matrix. In particular, the cross-section for a
given process can be computed once the S-matrix has been evaluated.
For simplicity, consider a real scalar quantum ﬁeld. It is shown that the S-matrix,
using the Lehmann–Symanzik–Zimmerman (LSZ) [Lehmann et al. (1954)] reduc-
tion formula, can be extracted from the following expression:
⟨|T

ˆϕH(t1, ⃗x1) · · · ˆϕH(tN, ⃗xN)

|⟩
All the calculations are in Minkowski space since scattering explicitly requires the
propagation of particles in real Minkowski time.
13.4 Incoming and outgoing states
The incoming and outgoing states are free particles; these states are constructed
from the free ﬁeld creation and destruction operators, with the free particle
having the renormalized mass of the nonlinear theory that we are going to describe.
The Fock state space of a free quantum ﬁeld, discussed for the two-dimensional
quantum ﬁeld in Section 7.2, forms a complete basis state: Both the incoming and
outgoing states can be represented by the basis states of a free quantum ﬁeld.2
In the scattering problem, as shown in Figure 13.2, there are three distinct Fock
state spaces:
2 It is assumed that the incoming and outgoing states are not bound states.

in⟨F, 0|0, F⟩in = 1
3 The notation of c, c† is used for the free ﬁeld destruction and creation operators to avoid later clash of notation.

13.5 Interaction representation

For example, the single particle state is given by
c†
⃗p1|0, F⟩in = |1, ⃗p1; F⟩in
The multiparticle in-states are the generalization of the basis states given in
Eq. 7.3.2; the label for the state space vector is given by
|n1, ⃗q1; n2, ⃗q2; . . . ; nℓ, ⃗qℓ; F⟩in
The interpretation of the incoming state vector is the following: There are n1 parti-
cles with momentum ⃗q1 · · · and nℓparticles with momentum ⃗qℓ.
For most applications, there is only one particle with a given momentum and
hence one has n1 = n2 = · · · = nℓ. With this simpliﬁcation, the incoming state
with ℓparticles in different states is given by
|1, ⃗q1; 1, ⃗q2; . . . ; 1, ⃗qℓ; F⟩in ≡|⃗q1; ⃗q2; . . . ; ⃗qℓ; F⟩in
The free ﬁeld Fock vacuum state, which will be shown to generate the scattering
states in the inﬁnite future, is similarly deﬁned by
b⃗p|0, F⟩out = 0;
out⟨F, 0|0, F⟩out = 1
The single particle state is given by
b†
⃗p1|0, F⟩out = |1, ⃗p1; F⟩out
and the mutiple particle state is
|1, ⃗q1; 1, ⃗q2; . . . ; 1, ⃗qℓ; F⟩out ≡|⃗q1; ⃗q2; . . . ; ⃗qℓ; F⟩out
13.5 Interaction representation
Consider the scattering event shown in Figure 13.2, with n incoming particles and m
outgoing particles. Free particles are sent heading toward each other; the collision
happens over a small volume and for a short time. After the scattering free particles
again emerge, but this time heading away from each other
Scattering is described by local interactions that only act if the colliding particles
are close to each other. Once the colliding particles separate, the n incoming and
m outgoing particles can be separately labeled and assigned momentum and single
particle quantum numbers.
Scattering is described by the Hamiltonian of the quantum ﬁeld. Far in the past
or future, the particles evolve like free particles. Only in the collision volume does
the interaction take place. Let us suppose that the interaction takes place at time
t = 0. The Hamiltonian is given by
H = H0 + e−ϵ|t|HI
Where H0 is the free noninteracting Hamiltonian.

354
Operator expectation and S matrix
The interaction representation is chosen to describe a scattering event because at
times in the far future and distant past, the eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian
are identical to the free particle eigenstates; the interaction takes place for a short
duration at t ≈0.
The factor of ϵ, known as the adiabatic switching on of the interaction, is put in to
explicitly restrict the action of the interaction Hamiltonian HI to t ≈0. An inﬁnite
oscillating phase factor develops for the S-matrix for t →±∞; the ϵ regulator
removes this phase factor [Huang (2010)]. For notational convenience, ϵ is often
suppressed when not required.
The reason that the interaction representation is chosen is because at times in
the far future and distant past, the eigenstates of the interaction Hamiltonian are
identical to the free particle eigenstates.
In the interaction representation, states are evolved by the interaction Hamil-
tonian HI and operators are evolved by the free ﬁeld Hamiltonian H0. A typical
time-dependent expectation value of a Schr¨odinger operator O, for an initial state
vector , is given as follows in the interaction representation:
⟨|eitHOe−itH|⟩= ⟨|eitH(t)e−itH0OI(t)eitH0e−itH(t)|⟩= ⟨I(t)|OI(t)|I(t)⟩
where
OI(t) = eitH0Oe−itH0
The time-evolved state |I(t)⟩in the interaction representation is given by
|I(t)⟩= eitH0e−itH|!⟩
⇒i ∂
∂t|I(t)⟩= eitH0(−H0 + H0 + e−ϵ|t|HI)e−itH|!⟩= e−ϵ|t|HI(t)|I(t)⟩
where
HI(t) = eitH0HIe−itH0
⇒[HI(t), HI(t′)] ̸= 0
The solution of the evolution equation in the interaction representation yields
|I(t)⟩= U(t, ti)|I(ti)⟩
Since HI(t) do not commute for different times, the evolution operator is given by
the following Dyson time-ordered product, deﬁned in Eq. 7.11.2 and denoted by T:
U(tf, ti) = T

exp

−i
 tf

(13.5.1)
To illustrate the idea of a time-ordered product, consider a term that arises in the
expansion of Eq. 13.5.1 (set ϵ = 0); operators with earlier time are placed to the
right:

To mathematically express a scattering event, consider preparing n well-
separated particles in the inﬁnite past, that is, with t = −∞; the particles can then
be considered to be free particles having the renormalized mass of the quantum
ﬁeld theory. Similarly, consider the outgoing particles to be in the inﬁnite future
t →+∞and also well separated and free particles.
Let the initial state at t0 = −∞evolve to a state vector at t = 0; this is given by
|{⃗k}, in⟩≡|I(0)⟩= U(0, −∞)|I(−∞)⟩
= U(0, −∞)|{⃗k}, F⟩in
(13.5.2)
Eq. 13.5.2 states that |{⃗k}, F⟩in, which is a state that consists of a collection of free
particles in the distant past, has evolved into the state vector given by |{⃗k}, in⟩.
|{⃗k}, in⟩can be labeled by the quantum numbers of free single particle states that
make up the state |{⃗k}, F⟩in, even though the state |{⃗k}, in⟩does not consist of a
collection of free particles. This is the key idea of the LSZ formalism.
It is shown by Huang (2010) that |{⃗k}, in⟩is an exact eigenstate, at t = 0, of the
full Hamiltonian; more precisely, deﬁne
|Xϵ⟩≡
Uϵ|!⟩
⟨!|Uϵ|!⟩; Uϵ = Uϵ(0, −∞); H0|!⟩= E0|!⟩
Then
lim
ϵ→0 |Xϵ⟩= c|⟩; (H0 + HI)|⟩= E|⟩
In other words, up to a normalization, |{⃗k}, in⟩≡|I(0)⟩is an eigenstate of H at
t = 0.
Similarly, the interaction state at t = +∞has evolved from a state at t = 0 and
is given by
⟨out; {⃗q}| ≡⟨I(0)| = ⟨I(+∞)|U(∞, 0) = out⟨F, {⃗q}|U(∞, 0) (13.5.3)
Hence, the transition amplitude for particles coming in from t = −∞and, after
scattering, going off to t = +∞, is given by
⟨out; {⃗q}|{⃗k}, in⟩= out⟨F, {⃗q}|U(∞, 0)U(0, −∞)|{⃗k}, F⟩in
= out⟨F, {⃗q}|U(∞, −∞)|{⃗k}, F⟩in
The derivation shows that the probability amplitude for the process shown in
Figure 13.2 is given by matrix elements of the S-matrix, which is deﬁned by

Assign momenta and number of particles N1, ⃗k1, . . . , Nm, ⃗km to the incoming
free particles and Nm+1, ⃗qm+1, . . . , Nn+m, ⃗qn+m to the outgoing free particles. From
Eq. 13.5.2, the exact eigenstate vectors can be labeled by the label of the incoming
free particle eigenstate as follows
|{⃗k}; in⟩= |N1, ⃗k1, . . . , Nm; ⃗km; in⟩; ⟨{⃗q}; out| = ⟨Nm+1, ⃗qm+1, . . . , Nn+m, ⃗qm+n; out|
Generalizing the completeness given in Eq. 7.3.3, one can write

The matrix elements of the S-matrix are given by

The S-matrix does not depend on time; the reason is that the scattering of particles is
a stationary process, with a steady (time-independent) stream of incoming particles
colliding and scattering off each other and appearing as outgoing particles.
13.5.1 Wave packets
The single particle state c†
⃗p|0; in⟩created by c†
⃗p is a plane wave state and hence is
spread throughout space; one needs to localize the plane wave state in space to have
well-separated incoming states. Introduce the weighting function f(⃗k); an incoming
spatially localized wave packet |⃗p0⟩is given by
|⃗p0; F⟩in = c†(p0)|0; F⟩in

For outgoing states, there is a separate set of free particle creation and annihilation
operators, denoted by b⃗p, b†
⃗p, that are not the same as the incoming states. The single
particle outgoing state is given by
b⃗p|0; F⟩out = 0;
out⟨F; 0|b⃗p = out⟨F; ⃗p|;
out⟨F; 0|0; F⟩out = 1
The outgoing wave packet is given by
out⟨F; 0|b(p0) with b(p0) =

d3k
(2π)3 f(⃗p0 −⃗k)b⃗k
The outgoing states are also deﬁned to have well-separated ﬁnal states.
For concreteness, consider the scattering of two particles off each other. In the
distant past and future, there are two spatially well-separated particles in incoming
and outgoing states, respectively, in the following compact notation:
| ⃗p1, ⃗p2; F⟩in = c†(p1)c†(p2)|0; F⟩in = c†
1c†

out⟨F; ⃗p3, ⃗p4| = out⟨F; 0|b(⃗p3)b(⃗p4) = out⟨F; 0|b3b4
(13.5.4)
From above, the scattering matrix S of two particles scattering off each other is
given by
⟨3, 4; out|1, 2; in⟩= out⟨F; 0|b3b4Sc†
1c†
2|0; F⟩in = S( ⃗p3, ⃗p4; ⃗p1, ⃗p2)
(13.5.5)
where the state vectors are labeled by momenta ⃗p1, . . . , ⃗p4.
13.6 Scattering
As the particles propagate from t = −∞, the wave packet spreads out and the
particles enter the collision volume, shown by the dark ellipse in Figure 13.2, where
their state vectors overlap and interact with each other. Once the particles start
to interact, the nonlinear interactions of the quantum ﬁeld need to be taken into
account.
The time-dependent Heisenberg ﬁeld φ(t, ⃗x) for the interacting picture is evolved
by the full Hamiltonian H. The deﬁnition of time-independent free ﬁeld creation
and destruction operators c†
⃗p, c⃗p, b†
⃗p, b⃗p is extended to time-dependent (nonlinear)
creation- and destruction-like operators, a⃗p(t), a†
⃗p(t). The creation- and destruction-
like operators are time dependent since they are deﬁned in terms of the Heisenberg
ﬁeld operators φ(t, ⃗x), which as mentioned obey nonlinear ﬁeld equations.

Deﬁne creation- and destruction-like time-dependent Heisenberg operators for

(13.6.2)
It is important to note that the interacting ﬁeld Heisenberg operator φ(t, ⃗x) does
not converge to the free ﬁeld Heisenberg operator ˜φ(t, ⃗x) in the distant past or
future; rather, it is the matrix elements of the S-matrix that converge, in the past
and future, to a representation based on the free ﬁeld state space. This condition of
matrix elements converging is weaker than the convergence as operators and avoids
inconsistencies.4
In analogy with the free ﬁeld, deﬁne the creation and destruction operators and
the vacuum state at t = ±∞as follows:
a⃗p(−∞)|(−∞)⟩= 0 = ⟨(+∞)|a†
⃗p(+∞)
Let the exact ground state of interacting ﬁeld be given by
|⟩; ⟨|⟩= 1
The exact vacuum state obeys the completeness equation given by

|s⟩⟨s

0 =

⟨|(−∞)⟩

and similarly for a†
⃗p. This yields
a⃗p(−∞)|⟩= 0 = ⟨|a†
⃗p(+∞)
(13.6.3)
4 This feature of operator convergence versus matrix elements convergence is similar to the basis of the Gupta–
Bleuler quantization of the photon ﬁeld discussed in Section 9.12.1.
5 The other terms are zero since none of the excited states have the quantum numbers of the vacuum.

⃗p(−∞) creates the scattering states at t = −∞. For the single particle case,
assume that Eqs. 13.5.2 and 13.5.3 yield the following [Srednicki (2007)]:

Wave function renormalization is denoted by Z and discussed later in Chapter 15;
it is necessary in going from the interacting ﬁeld φ(t, ⃗x) to the free ﬁeld ˜φ(t, ⃗x). We
then have, from above, that

interacting theory, similar to Eq. 13.5.4, are given from Eq. 13.6.8, by the following

tion given in Eq. 13.4.1, which is linear and yields

−⃗∇2+m2+∂2/∂t2. ˜φ(t, ⃗x) = 0;
hence, for the free ﬁeld, Sfree = I.
The expected result is that the S-matrix – for a free quantum ﬁeld given by Sfree –
is the identity operator. This is so because for a linear theory there is no scattering
of incoming particles, with the outgoing particles being identical to the incoming
particles.
In contrast, the nonlinear ﬁeld equation for φ(t, ⃗x) yields a nonzero result for
the last expression in Eq. 13.7.3. For example, a nonlinear interaction term such as
λφ4/4 yields the following ﬁeld equation:

∂2 + m2.
φ(x) = λφ3(x)
Eqs. 13.7.3 and 13.7.4 allow us to convert all the operators ai(+∞) to ai(−∞)
and operators a†
i (−∞) to a†
i (+∞).
Using the time-ordering in Eq. 13.6.11, the operators ai(−∞), from Eq.
13.6.3, yield ai(−∞)|⟩= 0. Similarly, a†
i (+∞) annihilate the vacuum due
to ⟨|a†
i (+∞) = 0, also due to Eq. 13.6.3. Hence all creation and destruction
operators are removed from the matrix element. This process of removing the
creation and annihilation operators from the S-matrix elements is the called the
LSZ “reduction” procedure.
From Eqs. 13.6.11, 13.7.3 and 13.7.4, we have

From Eq. 13.7.6, the only difference between incoming and outgoing states is in
the sign of the momentum. The S-matrix obeys crossing symmetry, since Eq. 13.7.6
yields
S(p3, p4; p1, p2) = S(−p1, −p2; −p3, −p4): crossing symmetry
For complex scalar ﬁelds, crossing symmetry implies the symmetry under exchange
of particle with antiparticle.
The generalization of the LSZ reduction formula to the case of arbitrary num-
ber of incoming and outgoing particles is straightforward, since each external leg
(both incoming and outgoing) is reduced independently from the rest. Hence, for
incoming momenta labeled by pi, xi, i = 1, . . . , m and for outgoing labeled by
pi, xi, i = m + 1, . . . , m + n, we obtain the ﬁnal result:

Hence, Eqs. 13.7.6 and 13.7.8 show that the S-matrix is the amputated correlation

renormalization constant Z coming from the S-matrix exactly cancels the terms
appearing in the exact propagator, leaving the fully amputated n-point correlation

vacuum expectation value of the Heisenberg ﬁeld operators. Eq. 13.2.4, repeated

Hence, from Eqs. 13.7.7 and 13.7.9, all scattering experiments can be studied using
the correlation functions evaluated via the path integral.
The extension of the LSZ formalism to the case of gauge ﬁelds and spinors has
been discussed by Srednicki (2007).
13.7.1 LSZ preconditions
A key assumption made in the LSZ derivation is that one can smoothly interpo-
late the matrix elements of the free particle incoming and outgoing creation and
destruction operators by the matrix elements of the time-dependent creation- and
destruction-like operators a⃗p(t), a†
⃗p(t) – deﬁned for the nonlinear quantum ﬁeld in
Eqs. 13.6.1 and 13.6.2.
Peskin and Schroeder (1995) have a discussion of the LSZ procedure using
the Kallen–Lehman spectral decomposition of the propagator, which is not very
transparent. The approach of Srednicki (2007) clearly highlights the role played by
the creation and destruction operators in the ﬁnal result.
A detailed discussion by Srednicki (2007) shows that the LSZ assumptions are
valid if the following two conditions are satisﬁed.
• The interacting ﬁeld must have zero vacuum expectation value

The reason for this is that when the ﬁeld φH(x) acts on the vacuum, it must not
create a superposed state of the single particle wave packet and the vacuum state.
• The ﬁeld must obey translation invariance that yields, for the momentum eigen-
state |⃗p⟩, the following:
⟨|φH(x)|⃗p⟩= eipx
(13.7.10)
Due to two-particle scatterings, there is a continuum of two-particle eigenstates –
as shown in Figure 13.4. The wave packets of the two particle incoming and
outgoing states behave differently from a nonfactorizable multiparticle state since
their overlap goes to zero for inﬁnite time. The operator a†
i (t) creates some non-
factorizable multiparticle states when acting on the vacuum state. The condition
given in Eq. 13.7.10 is sufﬁcient for making the contribution of the nonfactoriz-
able multiparticle states to the two-particle scattering amplitude negligible – by
waiting long enough.

Nonlinear scalar ﬁeld: Feynman diagrams
14.1 Introduction
This chapter studies the four-dimensional nonlinear scalar quantum ﬁeld. The
scalar degree of freedom is chosen since it is one of the simplest cases – without
having additional features that are unnecessary for studying the inﬁnities that
arise in quantum ﬁeld theory. For example, quantum ﬁeld theories, such nonlinear
Yang–Mills gauge ﬁelds or Dirac ﬁelds coupled to gauge ﬁelds, also have inﬁnities
but are more complicated to analyze than the nonlinear scalar ﬁeld.
To understand the nonlinear content of quantum ﬁeld theories, the scalar ﬁeld
ϕ(x) is studied, which has inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom; the coupling
is achieved by introducing a nonlinear potential for the ﬁelds in the Lagrangian. A
cubic potential yields an unstable path integral, so the simplest nonlinear term is a
potential that has a quartic power in the ﬁeld, given for a real scalar ﬁeld by λϕ4.
This theory is studied in detail in the following chapters since many of the key ideas
of quantum ﬁelds, including the theory of renormalization, can be described by this
nonlinear theory.
A quantum ﬁeld theory is equivalent to the set of all of its correlation functions.
The free (Gaussian) quantum ﬁeld theory is the only case for which all the corre-
lation functions can be written in terms of the correlation function of two ﬁelds.
For all nonlinear quantum ﬁeld theories, one needs to compute all the correlation
functions. Nonlinear quantum ﬁeld theories in general are almost impossible to
solve exactly. One can carry out a Feynman perturbation expansion of the nonlinear
quantum ﬁeld about the free ﬁeld; this perturbation requires a small dimensionless
parameter, which is usually a coupling constant contained in the nonlinear inter-
actions. For strongly coupled quantum ﬁelds, other techniques and approximation
schemes, mostly based on numerical methods, have to be used.
The nonlinear ϕ4 potential is studied only for the weak coupling sector, and
entails carrying out all calculations as a power series in λ. This expansion is a
365

366
Nonlinear scalar ﬁeld: Feynman diagrams
perturbation expansion about the free scalar quantum ﬁeld. Furthermore, the terms
in the perturbation expansion will be given a graphical interpretation using the
formalism of Feynman diagrams.
Feynman diagrams provide a diagrammatic and graphical way of calculating the
correlation functions of nonlinear quantum ﬁelds as a perturbation expansion about
the free ﬁeld. In some special cases, one can sum up inﬁnite classes of Feynman
diagrams, but in general one has a power series in the small expansion parameter.
In addition to providing a direct physical intuition for understanding and describing
the complex behavior of quantum ﬁelds, Feynman diagrams are also a powerful
computational tool, since each diagram corresponds to a precise and well-deﬁned
mathematical expression.
The nonlinear scalar ﬁeld is used for introducing Feynman diagrams. In this
book, only “one-loop” calculations are carried out explicitly, and the Feynman
diagrams for these can be directly read off from the action; there is no need to
write an elaborate set of rules – they are covered in most books on quantum ﬁeld
theory and need no repetition here. For this reason the rules for the higher loop
Feynman diagrams are not discussed.
Feynman diagrams are ubiquitous in the description of quantum ﬁelds and will
be used extensively in the later chapters as well. More complicated Feynman dia-
grams are used for describing quantum ﬁelds that appear in particle physics. In
fact, it would be no exaggeration to state that the study of quantum ﬁelds would
not have made the progress that it has made if not for the conceptual clarity and
mathematical facility that Feynman diagrams have brought to the subject.
14.2 ϕ4 theory: Lagrangian
The nonlinear ϕ4 theory has a Lagrangian and action, in Euclidean spacetime, that
is given by the following:

The action S must be dimensionless since it is exponentiated to deﬁne the path
integral. A dimensionless action S leads to the deﬁnition of the dimensions for all
the terms in the action. Consider the action in d-dimensional spacetime and let a
have the scale of length. The dimension of the ﬁeld ϕ is adϕ and yields

A scale transformation is given by the following:

⇒dm = −1
Mass has dimension of inverse of length since velocity of light c = 1. This implies

coupling constant λ be dλ. This yields

The nonlinear term couples all the degrees of freedom and, in particular, transfers
momentum across degrees of freedom with vastly different momenta.
Consider the case of weak coupling, with the dimensionless coupling constant
being small, that is, λ << 1. To evaluate all the quantities, one can expand the
nonlinear term in a power series
eSI = 1 + SI + 1

To evaluate this term requires the four-ﬁeld correlation function using the quadratic
action and is the lowest order result. All the higher order terms in the expansion for
Z require the evaluation of the correlators of higher and higher order, and all these
can be evaluated using the so-called Wick’s theorem.

yields

A general coordinate and ﬁeld transformation is given by
xμ →˜xμ = xμ + δxμ; ϕ = ˜ϕ(˜x) −ϕ(x)
A scale transformation is given by
xμ →˜xμ = eϵxμ
The Jacobian J, for d-dimensional spacetime is given by
∂˜xμ
∂xν = eϵδμ

From Section 14.2, under a scale transformation
˜ϕ(˜x) = eϵdϕϕ(x); dϕ = 1
2(2 −d)

14.4 Wick’s theorem

For the self-interacting quartic scalar ﬁeld, the Lagrangian and action is given by


For d = 4, the ﬁeld ϕ had dimension of dϕ = −1, mass has dimension of dm = −1
and λ is a dimensionless coupling constant.
The massless Lagrangian (m = 0) transforms as follows:
L( ˜ϕ, ˜x) = −e−dϵ



i
(∂iϕ)2 + e(4−d)ϵ λ

Since the Jacobian is J = eϵd, the action transforms as

Hence, the massless action is scale invariant.
For an inﬁnitesimal scale transformation
ϕ = −ϵϕ; ˜xμ = xμ + δxμ
⇒δxμ = ϵxμ
Hence, from Eq. 14.3.1, the Noether current is given by
−ϵJ μ =
∂L
∂(∂μϕ)ϕ −
(
∂L

Dropping the overall ϵ factor, the conserved scaling current, in d = 4, is given by
J μ = ϕ∂μϕ +

2∂ρϕ∂ρϕ −λϕ4

Although the classical massless ϕ4 theory is scale invariant, the quantized ϕ4 theory
exhibits the breaking of scale invariance in d = 4 due to the requirement of
renormalization.
14.4 Wick’s theorem
Wick’s theorem is the result of Gaussian path integration, and to foreground the
derivation, the case of a ﬁnite number of independent degrees of freedom is ﬁrst
reviewed.

Feynman diagrams are a graphical method for representing the correlation func-

propagator, which is represented by a straight line given in Figure 14.1.
Wick’s theorem states that for a product of an even number of quantum ﬁelds,
the correlator is given by all possible contractions; hence, similar to Eq. 14.4.1 the
result is
E0[ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2) · · · ϕ(xi)ϕ(xj) · · · ϕ(xN−1)ϕ(xN)]

free quantum ﬁeld. The various ways of contracting the four ﬁelds, all of which are
nonequivalent, are shown in the Figure 14.2.
In the next sections, the four-point correlator for a Lagrangian with nonlinear
quartic interaction will be studied in detail and the Gaussian portion of the four-
point function, given above, will be subtracted to leave the purely nonlinear portion.

To evaluate Z1, one needs to perform a Gaussian functional integral using Wick’s
theorem. The four ﬁeld lines – represented in Figure 14.3 – need to grouped pair-
wise and then a contraction is made to connect a pair of ﬁeld lines. Each contraction
results in a propagator that is also represented by a line, as in Figure 14.1.
All the ϕps in the correlation function are equivalent; for the ﬁrst contraction
given in Figure 14.4(a), there are three choices and one choice for second contrac-
tion, which yields the diagram given in Figure 14.4(b).

14.6 Connected correlation functions
Renormalization is a procedure for absorbing the divergences arising in quantum
ﬁeld theory by redeﬁning the coupling constant λ, mass m and the ﬁeld variable ϕ
such that all the correlation functions in the redeﬁned theory are completely ﬁnite.
To renormalize the theory, it is sufﬁcient to make the partition function ﬁnite –
since it contains all the potential divergences. To organize the analysis of the

374
Nonlinear scalar ﬁeld: Feynman diagrams
divergences, a procedure has to be adopted that allows for the identiﬁcation of all
the divergent terms. Once these divergences have been renormalized, all the other
divergences that could potentially appear in the theory are also rendered ﬁnite.
The partition function contains many combinations of the divergent terms,
and the ﬁrst step in the procedure of renormalization is to identify the so-called
connected correlation functions, which are now discussed.
Recall from Eq. 14.2.2, the partition function is given by
Z = E0[eSI] =

DϕeS0

Eq. 14.2.3 – is given by

The second term in the expansion for the partition function is given by

The computation for Z2 yields a term that has the following form:
Z2 = · · · + 1
2E0[SI]E0[SI] = · · · + 1

and which is the result of only the ﬁelds from a given vertex being contracted –
independent of the ﬁelds of the other vertex. This term, which is order O(λ2), can
be obtained by squaring the result of the earlier calculation for Z1 and need not be
calculated again.
The diagrammatic expansion of the partition function to O(λ3) is shown in
Figure 14.5. These diagrams are obtained by carrying all possible contractions on
the product of ﬁelds that appear for a given order in the expansion.
Two of the diagrams that can be built up from the lower order diagrams are
given by Figure 14.5(c), which corresponds to E0[SI]E0[SI] and Figure 14.5(e),

connected diagrams.
Diagrams are connected if all the lines representing the contraction of a pair
of ﬁelds are connected. If some of the lines are disjoint – not being connected to
another set of lines – then this diagram is disconnected and can be obtained from
the lower order diagrams.
It can be shown that taking the logarithm of Z removes all the disconnected
diagrams and yields [Zinn-Justin (1993)]
W = ln(Z)
The generating function W, with a Feynman graph expansion shown in Figure 14.6,
is given by a sum of only connected diagrams.
The expansion of eW yields all connected and disconnected diagrams; all the
disconnected diagrams in Figure 14.5 are precisely generated, with the correct
combinatorial factors, by expanding the exponential.
14.6.1 W[J]: Generating functional
A systematic way of studying the divergence of a quantum ﬁeld is by analyzing the
generating function W; in particular, all the correlation functions of the theory can
be obtained from W.
For a quantum ﬁeld, and for the ϕ4 theory in particular, the generating functional
is given by

14.7 Two-point correlation function

The connected correlation is given by subtracting all the disconnected Feynman
diagrams and, for ϕ4 theory, yields
G(x1, x2, x3, x4) = E[ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x3)ϕ(x4)]c
= E[ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2)ϕ(x3)ϕ(x4)] −G(x1, x2)G(x3, x4)

(14.6.4)
The connected correlator G(x1, x2, x3, x4) is graphically shown in Figure 14.8.
For the free quantum ﬁeld the four-point correlator is zero. The explicit expres-
sions given in Eqs. 14.4.4 and 14.6.4 yield
G(x1, x2, x3, x4)
Gaussian = D(x1, x2, x3, x4) −D(x1, x2, x3, x4) = 0
where D(x1, x2, x3, x4) is given by the Feynman diagrams in Figure 14.2.
For the free scalar ﬁeld the generating functional W0[J] is given by
W0[J] = 1
2

d4x1d4x2J(x1)D(x1 −x2)J(x2)
The free ﬁeld is linear and does not have any quartic vertex – and hence the con-
nected correlators for all four-point and higher cases are zero. This is because the
generating functional for the free ﬁeld W0[J] is quadratic in the external currents
J(x) and yields
δnW0[J]
δJ(x1) · · · δJ(xn) = 0; n ≥3: Free ﬁeld
(14.6.5)
In other words, the connected correlators pick out precisely the terms that are absent
in the linear free ﬁeld theory.

(14.8.1)
The momentum-conserving δ-function and the propagator for the external legs have
been taken out.
As is clear from the Feynman diagrams, to O(λ) the bubble diagrams do not
affect interaction vertex. The reason is that these bubble diagrams modify the single
lines, which in effect is accounted for in the diagram given in Figure 14.9 for
the propagator; it will be shown later that these diagrams can be absorbed into
the redeﬁnition of the mass parameter m, as in Eq. 14.7.1. In other words, the

380
Nonlinear scalar ﬁeld: Feynman diagrams
corrections to the propagator given by the bubble diagrams are taken into account
by the complete two-point correlation G(p1, p2).
Figure 14.11(a) is the vertex function that occurs in the Lagrangian, and is called
a tree diagram. There are 4! ways of contracting the external legs into the vertex
and hence the Feynman diagram yields
0
4 = −λ
The three one-loop diagrams given in Figure 14.11 are similar to the free ﬁeld
diagrams given in Figure 14.2. All these diagrams can be obtained from the diagram
shown in Figure 14.14 by appropriately permuting its external momenta.
In Figures 14.10 and 14.11 the loops in the diagrams represent integration vari-
ables. A loop represents a single integration over the four momenta. The termi-
nology of a one-loop or a two-loop diagram and so on indicates that there is one
four-momentum, two four-momentum and so on independent integrations in the
diagram.
Hence, to O(λ2), the vertex function has only three single one-loop diagrams,
given in Figure 14.11(b), (c) and (d) that need to be evaluated; each diagram has
only a one-loop momentum that needs to be integrated over. Figures 14.11(b), (c)
and (d) are topologically distinct and differ only in how the external momentum
is routed through the diagram. So it is sufﬁcient to evaluate one of the diagrams
and then permute the external momentum to obtain the other two. These diagrams
correspond, up to a combinatorial factor that will be evaluated later, to the following
expression:

To O(λ2), the four-point function is given by the three topologically distinct distinct

In fact, for ϕ4 theory, these are the only two types of divergent Feynman diagrams –
with quadratic and logarithmic dependence on the momentum cutoff. These
divergent terms receive contributions from all the higher order Feynman diagrams
leading to all powers of the coupling constant λ.
Making these divergent terms ﬁnite will also make the perturbation theory ﬁnite
to all orders; the cutoff  can then be taken to inﬁnity and one will then obtain a
ﬁnite theory if the theory is renormalizable, which is the case for ϕ4 theory.
There are many ways to regulate a ﬁeld theory, such as using momentum cutoff
or a lattice spacetime. One of the most widely used regularization schemes is that
of dimensional regularization, in which the dimension d of spacetime is taken to be
a continuous parameter. This form of regularization preserves many symmetries,
including gauge invariance; its main shortcoming is that it cannot regulate chiral
fermions, which are one of the cornerstones of the weak interactions. Renormal-
ization is the procedure for removing the regularization; obtaining a ﬁnite result is
only possible for renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theories.

For m2 = 0, the classical Lagrangian in d = 4 is invariant under a global scale
transformation given by x →sx, where s is an arbitrary scale. The continuation
to d = 4 −ϵ < 4 dimensions, required by the need to regulate the quantum ﬁeld
theory, has introduced a length scale μ. On taking the limit of ϵ →0, the scale μ
will continue to appear in the renormalized theory and this breaks scale invariance.
In general, the breaking of scale invariance is a general feature of a renormalized
quantum ﬁeld theory and will be discussed in Chapters 15 and 16.

The ﬁrst prefactor comes from the interaction action SI, and the second term C1 =

the diagram can be obtained.

when divergences are canceled. As illustrated in Noteworthy 14.1, ϵ implicitly
carries the scale μ.

The two-loop integrations have completely factorized – being reduced to essentially

two-loop integrations, In general, for a diagram of O(λn), the most singular term is
of order 1/ϵn, with all the lower orders poles also occurring.

14.13 Summary
The nonlinear ϕ4 scalar quantum ﬁeld has divergences in its correlation functions.
The divergent diagrams are ﬁrst regularized, that is, rendered ﬁnite, by using
the procedure of dimensional regularization, which entails analytically continuing
spacetime dimension to fractional dimension of d = 4−ϵ. The correlation functions
are then computed by using the rules of dimensional regularization and were found
to have terms such as 1/ϵ, 1/ϵ2, . . ..
Feynman diagrams were introduced to represent the terms of the perturbation
expansion for various quantities such as the partition function Z, W = ln Z,
the propagator, the four-point correlation function and so on. Feynman diagrams
allowed us to represent higher order diagrams and discuss their properties.
What is worth noting is that the one-loop calculation for the case of renormal-
izable quantum ﬁeld theories (this will become more clear in the next chapter)
is sufﬁcient to discuss all the essential features of renormalization. The two-loop
diagram is required for the ﬁeld renormalization of the ϕ4 scalar quantum ﬁeld; the
result was quoted and not derived because such a derivation is not required for any
of the later discussions.
This chapter puts into place all the ingredients that are required for the discussion
on renormalization in the next chapter.

Renormalization
15.1 Introduction
The divergences that are present in ϕ4 nonlinear scalar quantum ﬁeld theory are
typical of all nonlinear quantum ﬁelds. The key idea for removing inﬁnities that
arise in quantum ﬁeld theory is the concept of renormalization. The procedure
of renormalization and the renormalization group is required to “quench” these
inﬁnities and leads to deﬁnitions of calculable physical parameters that are all ﬁnite.
At a more theoretical level, the concept of renormalization leads to the idea of the
renormalization group.
Relativistic invariance requires point-like interactions of the local quantum
ﬁelds, dictated by the light cone structure of spacetime in special relativity; this
requires that the ﬁeld ϕ4(x), at each point x, be an independent degree of freedom
and hence any ﬁnite volume of spacetime has inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom.
Furthermore, the correlation length of the degrees of freedom is the inverse of the
lowest mass in the system, and for a nonlinear theory this leads to the coupling of
inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom.
Divergences appear in the study of phase transitions due to scale invariance since,
at the critical point, the ﬂuctuations of the degrees of freedom for all scales become
coupled and require a consistent treatment of the inﬁnitely coupled many degrees
of freedom.
Renormalization is the procedure that removes all the divergences from a theory.
Only a special class of quantum ﬁeld theories is renormalizable, with many theories,
for which the divergences cannot be removed by any procedure, being nonrenor-
malizable quantum ﬁeld theories.
A large class of renormalized theories, and these are the ones that occur in
many applications in high energy physics and critical phenomena, are deﬁned
392

15.1 Introduction

by the following multiplicative redeﬁnition of the bare quantities in terms of the
renormalized ones:
ϕB = Z1/2
ϕ ϕR; mB = ZmmR; λB = ZλλRμϵ
(15.1.1)
Note that the arbitrary scale μ enters only via the dimensional coupling constant λB.
The dimensionless renormalization constants Zϕ, Zm, Zλ, which we generically
call Z, are functions only of the renormalized mR, λR – both of which are ﬁnite in
the limit of ϵ →0. The renormalized coupling constant λR is dimensionless.
In mass-independent renormalization schemes, which include dimensional regu-
larization, the renormalization constants Z do not depend on the renormalized mass
mR.1 Since all the Z’s are dimensionless, masses in perturbation theory can only
appear in powers of ln(mR/μ). All the Z’s are well deﬁned for massless theories;
hence, to have a ﬁnite limit for the Z’s as mR →0, all the mass terms must be
absent [Joglekar (1987)].
Since all the Z’s are independent of mass, they are well deﬁned for massless
theories as well; this fact is of great advantage when studying massless Yang–Mills
gauge ﬁelds. As a consequence, in dimensional regularization, since all the Z’s are
independent of mass, we have
Zϕ = Zϕ(λR, ϵ); Zm = Zm(λR, ϵ); Zλ = Zλ(λR, ϵ)
(15.1.2)
The renormalization constants, ignoring terms of O(ϵ), are all divergent and are
given in perturbation theory by the following expansion

(15.1.3)
The ﬁeld variables ϕB, ϕR cannot be observed. To obtain a ﬁnite and nontrivial
renormalized theory, rescaling of the ﬁeld variables is determined by the require-
ment that the quantum ﬂuctuations for both the bare and renormalized theory must
have the same magnitude.
In the perturbative formulation of a renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theory, the pro-
cedure of multiplicative renormalization is sufﬁcient to remove all the divergences
for theories. Renormalization can be carried out using many different procedures;
a few of these are the following.2
• Bare perturbation theory
• Renormalized perturbation theory
• Background ﬁeld method
• Wilson renormalization.
1 There are other regularization schemes, like momentum cutoff discussed in Section 15.11, for which, unlike
dimensional regularization, mR can appear in the renormalization constants Z.
2 I thank Wang Qinghai for many fruitful and enlightening discussions on renormalization.

394
Renormalization
All these procedures can be carried out to all orders in perturbation theory, but
in practice the background ﬁeld method is the one that is most useful for one- or
two-loop calculations.
15.2 Renormalization schemes
The renormalization constants given in Eq. 15.1.1 require that a deﬁnition of the
renormalized quantities be given, and only then can the bare coupling constants
and masses be related to the renormalized ones.
The renormalization conditions are deﬁned by a scheme that is independent of
mass so that it can be applied to massless theories as well. The subtractions required
for deﬁning the counter terms are chosen so that the renormalization constants are
independent of mass. The ﬁrst scheme is deﬁned in terms of the vertex functions and
is physically transparent; the second scheme is based on dimensional regularization
and is simpler to carry out, but is more indirect in how the renormalized quantities
are connected to measurable parameters.
In ϕ4 theory, since there are three renormalization constants – given by
Zm, Zϕ, Zλ – we need three renormalization conditions; these conditions hold for
any theory that has three renormalization constants, and in particular includes
quantum electrodynamics.
The following are two widely used renormalization conditions.
• The two-point vertex function 2 and four-point vertex function 4 have been
deﬁned in Eqs. 14.10.2 and 14.11.1, respectively. The renormalized vertex func-
tions satisfy the following three renormalization conditions:3

p2=0
= 1
(15.2.1)
R
4 (p)

pi·pj=μ2(δij−1/4) = −λphy
(15.2.2)
The physically measured parameters of the theory are mphy, λphy – both of which
are ﬁnite and have no singularities. All schemes of renormalization must yield
the same value for these parameters. For relativistic quantum ﬁelds a further
condition is that, in Minkowski space, the single particle quantum particle must
obey the relativistic condition that
E2(⃗p) = ⃗p2 + m2
phy
(15.2.3)
In other words, a quantum particle has a relativistically invariant physical mass
given by mphy, which of necessity must be independent of the arbitrary scale μ.
3 The vertex functions are 1PI (one particle irreducible) and discussed in Section 18.5. The fact of being 1PI does
not affect any of the our discussions in this chapter.

15.3 Bare perturbation theory
395
The choice of momentum scale μ for deﬁning the renormalization counterterms
is arbitrary and any ﬁxed momentum can be chosen.4 The arbitrariness of the
momentum scale μ for evaluating the renormalized quantities is illustrated for
the case of ϕ4 in Section 16.5.
• Another set of renormalization conditions is called minimal subtraction. For an
analysis conﬁned to one-loop diagrams, minimal subtraction is a simple but less
physically transparent scheme. Dimensional regularization, in particular applied
to minimal subtraction, is a mass-independent renormalization scheme, and is
discussed in Section 15.5. In minimal subtraction, one isolates the 1/ϵ terms and
directly subtracts these terms by deﬁning the (divergent) bare coupling constants
and masses in terms of the (ﬁnite) renormalized masses and coupling constants.
Fixing the renormalized Lagrangian to yield ﬁnite renormalized correlation func-
tions by the various schemes yields equally consistent results. However, the differ-
ent schemes for deﬁning the renormalized mass and coupling constant, in general,
have only an indirect connection to the physically measured parameters mphy, λphy.
Nevertheless, all schemes of renormalization yield the same value for mphy, λphy.
Moreover, the renormalized masses and coupling constants for the different
schemes have different deﬁnitions and are related by the renormalization group
transformation – discussed later in Section 16.5. A momentum cutoff procedure is
discussed in Section 15.11, the background ﬁeld method is discussed in Section
15.12 and Wilson renormalization theory is discussed in Section 15.13.
15.3 Bare perturbation theory
In dimensional regularization, the propagator and four-point vertex function are
divergent as ϵ →0, where d = 4 −ϵ. To obtain ﬁnite results from ϕ4 theory, one
can redeﬁne the ingredients of the theory and then study if the theory is ﬁnite as
ϵ →0.
One starts from the “original” Lagrangian, which is called the bare Lagrangian,
with all the coupling constants and ﬁelds appearing being called bare quantities; and
from the bare quantities, the renormalized quantities, including the renormalized
Lagrangian, are obtained.
The original Lagrangian is taken to be written in terms of the bare quantities,
namely ϕB, λB, mB, and is given by
LB = −1
2∂μϕB∂μϕB −1
2m2
Bϕ2
B −λB
4! ϕ4
B
(15.3.1)
This deﬁnition holds in all dimensions d.
4 For massless theories, setting all the momenta of all the external legs to zero can lead to infrared divergences;
this will be addressed later in Section 18.10 in the analysis of the effective potential for massless ϕ4 theory.

396
Renormalization
The bare Lagrangian deﬁnes a theory with no cutoff. As discussed earlier, the
dimension of λB is [1/μϵ],where μ has the dimension of momentum. The Feynman
diagrams for the bare theory are expressed without the scale μ.
15.4 Mass and ﬁeld renormalization
In d = 4 −ϵ dimensions, the bare coupling constant λB carries a dimension of
1/aϵ and mass has dimension of 1/a, where a has the dimension of length. In the
expressions for the Feynman diagrams, the fractional power of the mass mϵ
B has to
be kept for dimensional consistency. The dependence of the divergent integrals on
the bare quantities is written out explicitly, and yields
I1 = λBm2
B˜I1; I2 = λ2
B˜I2; I3 = λ2
B˜I3; I4 = λ2
B˜I4
The two-point function is given by
GB
2(p, p′) = E[ϕB(p)ϕB(p′)] = δ(p + p′)G2(p)
Although the calculation will be limited to O(λ), the O(λ2) term needs to be
included in the propagator so as to obtain a nontrivial ﬁeld renormalization. The
tadpole and sunset diagram, shown in Figure 14.13, yields

• The coefﬁcient of the p2 is ﬁxed to be exactly one.
Eq. 14.10.3 gives G−1

The bare mass is chosen to cancel the divergence coming from the divergent term

398
Renormalization
choosing the deﬁnition of mR is that the divergent term is canceled using only the
dimensionless renormalized coupling constant λR since all the renormalization
constants Z depend only on λR, as in Eq. 15.1.1; furthermore, the cancellation of
the divergent term must be independent of mass and momentum as required by the
fact that renormalization constants Z are dimensionless as in Eq. 15.1.2.
Canceling a divergent term is ambiguous up to a ﬁnite constant. The scheme of
minimal subtraction (MS) removes this ambiguity and entails precisely canceling
only the 1/ϵ term in Eq. 15.4.6.5 Hence, from Eq. 15.4.6, deﬁne mR by the dimen-
sionally consistent equation that requires using the dimensionless renormalized

Hence the renormalization of mass is the result of interactions changing the energy
levels of the system. The renormalized mass mR is the energy of the ﬁrst excited
state above the ground state, and is the generalization of the result for the harmonic
oscillator given in Eq. 15.5.6. The observed mass of a particle in quantum ﬁeld
theory is deﬁned to be the renormalized mass and is the energy of the ﬁrst excited
state above the ground state. Hence, the result from quantum mechanics regarding
the renormalized mass has a similar interpretation as the renormalized mass in
quantum ﬁeld theory.
15.6 Coupling constant renormalization
To complete the renormalization procedure, λB needs to be expressed in terms
of the renormalized parameters λR and mR. The analysis is more complicated
since the mass and momentum dependence of the four-point function needs to be
accounted for.
The renormalized four-point function is given by
E[ϕR(p1) · · · ϕR(p4)] = Z−2
ϕ E[ϕB(p1) · · · ϕB(p4)] = Z−2
ϕ GB
4(p1, . . . , p4)
In terms of the connected vertex function 4, the four-point function is written as
follows:

The diagrams with a bubble diagram are precisely accounted for by the renor-
malization of mass; all the divergences from the bubble diagrams are removed by
replacing m2
B by m2
R.
The one-loop diagram is analyzed using the fact λB has a dimension. Writing out
the one-loop vertex 4 yields, from Eq. 14.11.2, the following:
B
4 (p1, . . . , p4) = −λB + λ2
B{˜I2(p1 + p2) + ˜I2(p2 + p3) + ˜I2(p3 + p4)} (15.6.1)
with momentum conservation requiring that p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = 0.

15.6 Coupling constant renormalization

Note that ˜I2(p) carries the dimension of 1/λB; this is necessary since the ﬁrst term
in 4 is λB and has dimension of μϵ.
The dimensionless renormalized coupling constant λR is deﬁned using MS;
hence, the 1/ϵ term is isolated in R
4 and is subtracted in deﬁning λB in terms of λR.

precisely cancel the 1/ϵ singular term in R

p2 = 0 in Eqs. 15.6.1 and 15.6.2. Then, using mB = mR + O(λB)

the condition given in Eq. 15.2.2. The relation of the two schemes is discussed
further in Section 15.6.1. The signiﬁcance of the renormalized vertex function
R
4 (p1, . . . , p4) is discussed in Section 16.6.
15.6.1 Renormalized massless four-point vertex
To make the procedure of subtractions more clear, the massless theory is analyzed
since the equations are more transparent. The massless four-point function is the
result for the case when all momenta are much larger than the mass mR. This is
due to dimensional reasons: Mass always appears in the Feynman diagrams as
mR/|p|, where |p| is the magnitude of a typical Euclidean momentum; hence for
large Euclidean momentum, the theory behaves like the massless theory.
In the limit of mR →0, the integral given in Eq. 15.6.7 yields

(15.6.10)
where the renormalized coupling constant λR = λR( ˜μ) is deﬁned at the momentum
scale of ˜μ = ˜cμ.
Eq. 15.6.10 shows that for the massless case, the MS scheme has a simple and
direct equivalent to the vertex function renormalization conditions given in Eq.
15.2.2. However, this is not the case for the massive case, since as can be seen
from Eq. 15.6.7, the connection of R
4 (pi) with λR(μ) is quite indirect: There is no
choice of momenta pi for which −λR(μ) is equal to R
4 (pi).
15.7 Change of scale μ

ized quantities, consider the renormalized four-point vertex function given in terms

Note that, as expected from the general features of dimensional regularization, the
Z’s depend only on λR and are independent of mass mR; hence, this scheme is
equally valid for massless quantum ﬁelds as well.
Both the bare quantities, mB, λB are divergent, but are tuned to diverge in a very
precise manner, and leave a ﬁnite renormalized result. This result is similar to
calculus in that inﬁnitesimals are multiplied and divided to yield ﬁnite results in
the continuuum limit.
This completes, to lowest nontrivial order, the renormalization of ϕ4 theory. The
renormalized mass mR and coupling constant λR are ﬁnite. All measurable results
of ϕ4 theory are ﬁnite functions of mR and λR. The results are given by one-loop
Feynman diagrams for mR and λR and, unexpectedly, one had to go two loops to
obtain Zϕ.
15.10 Renormalized perturbation theory
The renormalization scheme using the bare Lagrangian shows that one can render
the theory ﬁnite by introducing renormalized mass and coupling constants via the
renormalization scheme. For bare perturbation theory, the MS scheme was used for
deﬁning the renormalized parameters. One obtains an expansion of the bare quan-
tities as a power series in terms of the renormalized mass and coupling constant.
The lowest order result was obtained using bare perturbation theory, and shows
that the bare mass and coupling constant, to lowest order, are equal to the renor-
malized ones, with divergent terms being added at higher orders to render the
theory ﬁnite. This pattern is a general feature of the renormalization procedure.
The bare Lagrangian can be completely replaced by a Lagrangian deﬁned by the
renormalized ﬁeld variables and coupling constants.
The analysis of bare perturbation shows that the bare Lagrangian is deﬁned in
terms of the bare mass and coupling constant mB, λB and the bare ﬁeld variable ϕB.
Another equivalent way of organizing the perturbation expansion is to work directly

Renormalization
with only the renormalized quantities. The renormalized Lagrangian is obtained in
the following manner. Recall from Eq. 15.3.1 that the bare Lagrangian is deﬁned by
LB = −1

Bϕ2
B −λB
4! ϕ4

= LR + LCT
(15.10.1)
The Lagrangian LR yields the renormalized theory. The counterterm Lagrangian
LCT is deﬁned, order by order in λR, so that all the divergent terms that arise from
LR in perturbation theory are exactly canceled to each order by LCT.
There is clearly an ambiguity in the deﬁnition of LCT since, in canceling a
divergent term, one can always add a ﬁnite piece and still cancel the divergent piece.
The procedure used for renormalization, similar to the one for bare perturbation
theory, is that of minimal subtraction and consists, to lowest order, of canceling
only the divergent 1/ϵ terms that appear in the expansion.
Recall from Eq. 15.9.1, bare perturbation theory yields
Zm = 1 +

(15.10.2)
The result given in Eq. 15.10.2 is expressed in terms of the renormalized coupling
constant and mass mR, λR. The renormalization constants Zϕ, Zm, Zλ are rederived
using only the renormalized parameters mR, λR. Renormalized perturbation theory
is used with no reference to the bare theory.
The three renormalization constants are ﬁxed using the MS scheme. The singu-
larities that go as 1/ϵ are subtracted by introducing suitable counterterms in the
Lagrangian.
Similar to the bare propagator given in Eq. 15.4.1, the renormalized Lagrangian
LR yields the following tadpole and sunset diagrams for the renormalized propagator:

To lowest order, the solution given above agrees, as expected, with the result
obtained earlier using bare perturbation theory as given in Eq. 15.10.2.
Note that in renormalized perturbation theory, the Feynman perturbation expan-
sion is carried out completely in terms of the renormalized quantities. One ﬁrst com-
putes the Feynman diagram for a given order using the renormalized Lagrangian
LR. The scheme of renormalization is imposed for a given order. One then adjusts,
or renormalizes, the renormalization constants Zϕ, Zm, Zλ to subtract and cancel all
the divergent terms using the chosen scheme of renormalization.
The remarkable and enigmatic result for a renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theory
is that the procedure of canceling the divergent terms in a Feynman diagram using
the renormalization counterterms renders ﬁnite all Feynman diagrams to arbitrarily
high order. A deeper understanding of this rather bafﬂing and unexpected result is
given by the modern interpretation of renormalization, discussed in Chapter 17.
15.11 Momentum cutoff regularization
For completeness, a regularization using momentum cutoff is discussed. The one-
loop results are analyzed as these are sufﬁcient to illustrate the main features of this
method. All Feynman diagrams are evaluated in d = 4. All momenta in the loops of
Feynman diagrams are restricted to have a magnitude less than . Only mass and
coupling constant renormalization are analyzed; ﬁeld renormalization is similar but
needs a two-loop diagram.
For the one-loop renormalization of mass, using the result from Noteworthy 14.1
yields the following:
J1 =

Unlike the renormalization constants in dimensional regularization that are inde-
pendent of mass, momentum cutoff regularization yields mass-dependent constants.
This is one of major advantages of dimensional regularization since one can take
the limit for massless theories, something that is not so straightforward for the case
of momentum cutoff regularization.

Hence, the result for the renormalized R
4 (p1, . . . , p4) is the one that was obtained
earlier in Eq. 15.6.7 using dimensional regularization. The results differ in the
deﬁnition of μ, which is to be expected since one is using different schemes to
deﬁne μ. This difference yields equivalent renormalized coupling constants that
are related by a renormalization group transformation.

The renormalized mass and coupling constant for the background ﬁeld method,
given in Eqs. 15.12.14 and 15.12.13, respectively, have a μ-dependent term that
is absent in the result obtained earlier using the minimal scheme for both bare
and renormalized perturbation theory. The difference is because the background
ﬁeld method and the MS scheme have different momentum scales at which the
renormalized quantities are deﬁned. It is shown later in Section 16.5 that these two
schemes yield the same renormalized theory, with the renormalized quantities of
the two schemes being related by a ﬁnite renormalization group transformation.
The combinatorial factors for the background ﬁeld method are different, and eas-
ier to determine, than those of bare renormalized perturbation theory – but give the
same result. The one-loop four-point function, evaluated using three topologically
distinct diagrams given in Figure 15.1, is replaced by the computation of a single
connected diagram with two external legs given in Figure 15.5, thus greatly simpli-
fying the computation. In general, the background ﬁeld method is more efﬁcient in
evaluating low-order Feynman diagrams and has been used with great advantage in
studying the renormalization of Yang–Mills quantum ﬁeld theories [Abbot (1982)].
The background effective Lagrangian is deﬁned to be completely ﬁnite to all
orders in perturbation theory and hence provides an independent renormalization
scheme. All the quantum ﬂuctuations are integrated out and the mass and coupling
constants for the smoothly varying classical ﬁeld contain all the short-distance
effects of the quantum ﬁeld. Since the bare quantum ﬁeld Lagrangian has quantum
ﬂuctuations for all length scales, the long-distance effective Lagrangian’s mass
and coupling constants are the renormalized parameters. In effect, the mass and
coupling constants that appear for the classical ﬁeld are the renormalized mass and
coupling constants.
15.13 Wilson renormalization
Consider an arbitrary action S[ϕ] of a scalar ﬁeld ϕ. Let the theory have an ultra-
violet cutoff momentum , and the action is denoted by S = S[ϕ; ]. The cutoff
restricts all momentum such that |p| < ; the momentum takes values inside a
sphere in d-dimensional spacetime. The ﬁeld ϕ(x) has the following expansion in
terms of ϕp, the momentum degrees of freedom:

The fundamental equation for Wilson renormalization is given by Eq. 15.13.4:


DϕfeS[ϕf +ϕs]
On examining the thinning out of the degrees of freedom to one loop, as given
in Eq. 15.13.10, the computation looks like the procedure of renormalization in
the background ﬁeld method given in Eq. 15.12.1. Hence, the techniques of the
background ﬁeld method can be used, at least to one loop, for thinning out the
degrees of freedom.
In particular, note that Eq. 15.13.10 is identical to the background action obtained
in Eq. 15.12.2; the role of the classical ﬁeld ϕc is played by the slow variables ϕs
and the role of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld ϕ is played by ϕf. The classical ﬁeld equation
was not used in obtaining the momentum shell expansion; instead, the momentum
shell and other conditions removed all the terms linear in ϕf.
The combinatorics of the Wilson and background ﬁeld expansions are identical.
Hence, from Eqs. 15.12.12 and 15.13.4, the Wilson renormalization yields the
following renormalized action:

One remaining scaling is required before obtaining the renormalized action. The
reason is that the form of the renormalized action, deﬁned with a cutoff of b,
has to be brought as close as possible to the original action with cutoff . All the
dissimilarities of the two actions are attributed to the renormalization of the original
action’s parameters. In particular, the kinetic energy term (∂μϕ)2 for the original and
renormalized action needs to be identical so as to generate a sequence of actions that
goes to a nontrivial ﬁxed point and yields a nontrivial renormalization.

The form of the action S[ϕ, b] is the same as the original action S[ϕ].10 The only
“memory” the action S[ϕ, b] has of the higher momentum degrees of freedom being
integrated out is in the couplings given by m2(b), λ(b). This is the great insight of
Wilson: The arbitrary scale b, which appeared as μ in dimensional regularization,
encodes the scale at which one is probing the quantum ﬁeld. If the correlation
functions are of momentum less than b, then the effective couplings for the theory
are m2(b), λ(b).
In general, both the actions S and S(b) describe the same system; the only differ-
ence is that the bare action S can be used for computing correlation functions with
momentum up to , whereas the action S(b) can be used for computing correlation
functions up to a maximum momentum of b. In other words, by integrating out the
high momentum degrees of freedom no information has been lost; the renormalized
theory can be used for obtaining the correlation functions and other properties of
the original bare theory with a maximum momentum of |p| < b using the action
S(b) = S[ϕ, b].

15.14 Thinning of degrees of freedom

where S[ϕ] is the original action and S[ϕ, b] is the renormalized action with all
degrees of freedom with momentum higher than b having been integrated out.
In all the schemes based on dimensional regularization or momentum cutoff, the
ultraviolet divergences are a result of the inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom. The
scale μ – used for deﬁning the renormalized couplings – seems arbitrary, being
introduced purely based on the need to have a dimensional coupling constant in the
case of dimensional regularization. The breaking of scale invariance due to μ also
seems arbitrary.
In Wilson renormalization, the value of the scale μ is arbitrary but the scale
of necessity has to exist, since one is lowering the cutoff of the original theory
from cutoff  to b; the scale represents μ = b. Again, the breaking of scale
invariance must necessarily take place, even after one takes  →∞since the scale
μ will remain.
The original partition function Z has no information about b; hence, one has that

Using the vastly different Wilson scheme yields the same β-function obtained ear-
lier, with the insight that the scale parameter b has an interpretation as integrating
out the high momentum modes of the quantum ﬁeld.
Consider the following:
λ(b) = λ −λ2
3
16π2 ln(1/b)
As one decreases b by integrating out more and more of the shells of the high
momentum degrees of freedom, the running coupling constant becomes smaller.

426
Renormalization
One possibility is that it will decrease until it hits a ﬁxed point for a value of b = b0,
for which β(b0) = 0; if the β-function has no zero at lowest order, one needs to
compute higher order corrections to λ(b). If the β-function has no zeroes to all
orders, then the coupling constant will continue to decrease and become zero. The
β-function is discussed further in Chapter 16.
15.14.1 What is a quantum ﬁeld? Revisited
The question of what a quantum ﬁeld is was addressed in the beginning of this book
in Section 1.2, with the response that a quantum ﬁeld describes a system, either
quantum or classical, with inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom. Wilson’s
deep, intuitive and ground-breaking view of renormalization provides the following
profound and more comprehensive understanding of the question what is a quantum
ﬁeld? [Wilson and Kogut (1974); Wilson (1983)]. In fact, it is the view of many
leading ﬁeld theorists that it is Wilson who could understand and explain what a
quantum ﬁeld is.
• The quantum ﬁeld must be ﬁrst thought of a system that contains a cutoff ; this
is central to Wilson’s understanding of a quantum ﬁeld. This is the generalization
of the fact that calculus is inseparable from the existence of the inﬁnitesimal. In
Wilson’s formulation, an uncutoff quantum ﬁeld theory has to be obtained as the
limit of the cutoff theory. This is independent of whether one is using perturbation
theory or not [Wilson and Kogut (1974)].
• The quantum ﬁeld is understood to consist of inﬁnitely many degrees of free-
dom that are organized in a connected sequence of changing length scales. Each
momentum shell corresponds to a momentum scale. The nonlinear terms in the
action couple all the momentum scales. Furthermore, in a quantum ﬁeld as well
as for phase transitions, there is no characteristic scale that can be singled out and
allows one to neglect or treat the other scales as perturbations. Instead, all scales
need to be taken into account for quantum ﬁelds and critical systems, with the
procedure of renormalization achieving this objective [Wilson (1983)].
• An action with cutoff  describes correlation functions at the scale of . One
can change the scale of the theory from  to b by integrating out the momen-
tum shell between the two scales. This produces an action with cutoff b that
incorporates all the effects of the degrees of freedom in the shell from  to b.
The breaking of scale invariance is essential in deﬁning the renormalized theory,
since the b singles out a single scale, and hence breaks scale invariance.
• In full generality, the changing of scale results in a new action given in Eq. 15.13.2:
eS[b,ϕs] =

b<|p|<

DϕpeS[ϕf +ϕs]

15.15 Renormalizability to all orders
427
The momentum shell integration of action S gives rise to an action S(b) with
inﬁnitely many terms in ϕs. The fact that only a few parameters are needed to
deﬁne the renormalized theory, for the case of ϕ4 only the mass and coupling con-
stants, is related to the existence of ﬁxed points, and is discussed in Chapter 16. In
operational terms, all terms of O(ϕ5) and higher, from dimensional analysis, have
powers of 1/ multiplying them and these terms hence go to zero as  →∞.
• All divergences of quantum ﬁelds are seen to result in describing correlation
functions at low momentum scale, given by b →0, in terms of the theory deﬁned
at momentum scale . All the divergences of quantum ﬁelds are rendered ﬁnite
by comparing two nearby scales. In particular, from Eq. 15.14.2, the renormaliza-
tion constants arise from discribing correlation functions at scale b in terms of
coupling constant at scale . Hence

(p2 + m2)2
are perfectly ﬁnite in Wilson renormalization. However, if one takes b →0, as
is the case with the conventional schemes, these constants diverge and need to be
regularized.
The role of  is similar to the concept of the inﬁnitesimal in calculus – where
one needs to introduce the inﬁnitesimal and then take the value of the inﬁnites-
imal to zero to obtain the continuum limit. Similarly, one must introduce  and
then take the limit of  →∞to deﬁne the renormalized theory. In fact, the
renormalization of a quantum ﬁeld is termed by Wilson as taking the statistical
continuum limit since one is taking the limit of inﬁnitely many independent scales
due to inﬁnitely many coupled variables (degrees of freedom). “In the statistical
continuum limit functions of a continuous variable are themselves independent
variables ... In functional integration the ﬁelds are independent variables of inte-
gration” [Wilson (1983)]. In other words, the quantum ﬁeld ϕ(x) is the collection
of all possible (continuous and discontinuous) functions of x. Or equivalently, the
ﬁeld ϕ(x) is an independent continuous variable for each x.
15.15 Renormalizability to all orders
The study of ϕ4 theory showed that to lowest order, the theory has two divergent
diagrams, which were made intelligible by the procedure of renormalization. The
question naturally arises whether there are more divergent diagrams and whether
these appear at higher orders. And more importantly, can all the divergences that
appear at arbitrarily high order be removed by the procedure of renormalization?
This question is brieﬂy discussed in this section, with the technical proof being
covered in many standard texts [Peskin and Schroeder (1995); Zinn-Justin (1993)].

Figure 15.7 A O(λ11)-order Feynman diagram for a ϕ4 scalar ﬁeld theory.
A high order Feynman diagram is shown in Figure 15.7. For the theory to be
renormalizable, Feynman diagrams of arbitrarily high order all have to be ﬁnite.
For every Feynman diagram, D is deﬁned to be the superﬁcial degree of divergence.
This is a measure of how the Feynman diagram diverges as the regularization is
removed.
For a momentum cutoff , the norms of the integrations are restricted so that
k2
1 + · · · + k2
d < 2. Note that all the components of the momentum are restricted
only for the Euclidean theory, since for Minkowski space time the norm is not
positive deﬁnite. However, it is sufﬁcient to show that the quantum ﬁeld theory is
renormalizable in Euclidean spacetime for it to be renormalizable in Minkowski
spacetime.
In general, a Feynman diverges as D. Note for D ≥0 the graph is divergent,
with D = 0 indicating a logarithmic divergence. For D < 0, the graph is ﬁnite and
convergent.
A Feynman diagram in general is deﬁned by the following.
• E: number of external lines; an external line connects to only one vertex
• n: number of vertices
• I: number of internal lines; the two ends of an internal line are each connected to
a vertex, which can be (1) the same vertex as in the case of a bubble diagram, or
(2) two different vertices.
• L: number of loops; a loop is an independent d-dimensional integration.
Let the spacetime dimension be d and consider the general interaction terms ϕr,
with r ≥3. Each loop corresponds to a momentum integration over d dimensions
and gives a divergence of d; each internal line I corresponds to a propagator that
contributes a factor of −2 to the divergence.
Hence for L loops with I internal lines, D is given by
D = dL −2I
(15.15.1)

four external legs. (b) A Feynman diagram with six external legs.
Figure 15.8(a) has D = d −2 × 2 = d −4, which has ln  divergence for d = 4.
On the other hand, Figure 15.8(b) has D = d −6, which converges for d = 4.
The main criterion for classifying a divergent Feynman diagram needs to be
the number of external lines E that the diagram has – as this tells us how many
Feynman diagrams are divergent for the theory and need to be rendered ﬁnite by
renormalization.
The degree of divergence D is rewritten in terms of the number of external lines
E. For n vertices, an interaction of ϕr gives rn legs that sum to 2I + E since each
internal line connects two vertices. Hence
rn = E + 2I
The number of loops is determined by n and I. Each vertex in the Feynman diagram
has one momentum-conserving δ-function constraining the momentum integra-
tions, less one overall momentum-conservation δ-function for the entire Feynman
diagram. Hence
L = I −(n −1) = I −n + 1
(15.15.2)
For example, in Figure 15.7, n = 11, L = 9 and I = 19; hence we have L −1 =
8 = I −n, as expected.
The superﬁcial degree of divergence, from Eqs. 15.15.1 and 15.15.2, is given by
D = d(I −n + 1) −2I = (d −2)I −d(n −1)
(15.15.3)
For 1PI diagrams, discussed later in Section 18.5, all internal lines occur within a
loop and one has the condition
rn = E + 2I
which yields

D has the following cases.
• (d −2)r/2−d = 0 and hence D = d−(d−2)E/2: There are only a ﬁnite number
of external lines E for which the superﬁcial degree of divergence is positive.
D < 0 for sufﬁciently large E.
Since the bare Lagrangian has only a ﬁnite number of coupling constants, a
renormalizable theory can only have divergent diagrams for a ﬁnite number of
external legs E. The superﬁcial degree of divergence is independent of the number
of vertices n; hence this implies that for some E – for which D > 0 – there can be
inﬁnitely many divergent diagrams, with larger and larger n. For ϕ4 theory, two
examples of the inﬁnite collection of divergent diagrams are given in Figure 15.9.
The theory is renormalizable since the inﬁnitely many divergent terms can
all be absorbed by redeﬁning a ﬁnite number of bare coupling constants, which
correspond to the ﬁnite number of E for which D > 0.
• (d −2)r/2 −d < 0: Only a ﬁnite number of Feynman diagrams are divergent
since for large enough n, the superﬁcial degree of divergence D < 0; the rest of
the higher order Feynman diagrams are all convergent, and the theory is super-
renormalizable.
• (d −2)r/2−d > 0: There are an inﬁnite number of divergent Feynman diagrams;
theory is nonrenormalizable. One has inﬁnitely many divergent diagrams since
the degree of divergence D keeps increasing with increasing n; in particular, for
sufﬁciently large n there will be a divergent Feynman diagram for any number of
external lines E. Hence, for this case the theory cannot be rendered ﬁnite by any
perturbative procedure and is termed nonrenormalizable.
A ϕ4 theory in d = 4 and with r = 4 yields (d −2)r/2 −d = 0 and D = 4 −E.
Hence, there are only two divergent diagrams, namely, E = 2 and 4. There are
inﬁnitely many divergent diagrams for each case. For the case E = 2, some of the

15.15 Renormalizability to all orders
431
inﬁnitely many divergent diagrams can be seen from the tower of bubble diagrams
that occur for the propagator and are shown in Figure 15.9(a); all the divergences
can be absorbed by redeﬁning the bare mass mB in terms of the renormalized mass
mR and divergent counterterms.
In general, from Eq. 15.15.4 for d = 4, we have
D = 4 −E + n(r −4)
(15.15.5)
From the equation above, ϕ4 is renormalizable in d = 4 but ϕ6 theory is nonrenor-
malizable.
A ϕr theory in d = 2, from Eq. 15.15.4, yields
D = −d(n −1)
which is independent of r; hence all polynomial interactions are renormalizable.
This allows for nonpolynomial potentials, such as an exponential of the ﬁeld ϕ, to
be renormalizable in d = 2.
15.15.1 ϕ3: Super-renormalizable in d = 4
For ϕ3 theory in d = 4, from Eq. 15.15.5 we have
D = 4 −E −n; r = 3
In d = 4, only three Feynman diagrams are divergent for ϕ3 theory, and given
by the following:
• n = 1 ⇒D = 3 −E: For E = 1, there is a single one-loop tadpole diagram
shown in Figure 15.10(a). There is no E = 2 diagram and E = 3 gives a tree
diagram (no loops) that is ﬁnite. For E > 3, D < 0 and hence convergent.
• n = 2 ⇒D = 2 −E: For E = 2 there is a single self-energy one-loop diagram
that yields mass renormalization shown in Figure 15.10(c).
• n = 3 ⇒D = 1 −E: For E = 1, there is a single two-loop tadpole divergent
Feynman diagram shown in Figure 15.10(b).
• All the diagrams with n > 3 and for all E are convergent.

Renormalization
The three divergent terms can be rendered ﬁnite by introducing two counterterms.
• A linear term in the Lagrangian δhϕ, with δh canceling the one-loop and two-
loop divergent terms coming from the tadpole diagrams given in Figure 15.10(a)
and (b).
• A mass renormalization δm2 is added to the mass term in the Lagrangian to yield
(m2 + δm2)ϕ2 and cancels the one-loop divergence coming from the self-energy
diagram given in Figure 15.10(c).
Hence, in d = 4, ϕ3 theory is super-renormalizable.
15.16 Superﬁcial degree of divergence
The degree of divergence D < 0 does not mean that a graph is necessarily con-
vergent and this is the reason that it is called the superﬁcial degree of divergence.
Consider for example E = 6 for ϕ4 theory for which D = −2. A graph such as that
given in Figure 15.11(a) is convergent. But the graphs in Figure 15.11(b) and (c)
are divergent since they contain divergent subdiagrams.
However, intuitively it is clear that if one renormalizes the primitively divergent
graphs, then graphs such as those given in Figure 15.11(b) and (c) no longer have
divergent subgraphs, and should be convergent.
Weinberg’s theorem: If the D of a graph is negative and the D for all its subgraphs
are also negative, then the Feynman diagram converges.
Consider the Lagrangian in d dimensions, namely

• For dg > 0, the coupling constant gn yields a dimensional factor of μn|dg|;
hence, to make the product gnIn dimensionless, the Feynman diagram must go as
−n|dg|: The higher the order of the diagram, the more convergent it is. Hence the
theory is super-renormalizable as there are only at best a ﬁnite number of graphs
that are divergent.
• For dg < 0, the dimensional term μ−|dg| coming from the coupling constant must

• For dg = 0, there are inﬁnitely many divergent diagrams, but these appear only in
a ﬁnite number with a maximum given number of external legs. All the divergent
diagrams can be rendered ﬁnite by renormalizing a ﬁnite number of parameters
in the action that correspond to these external legs. Hence, the theory is renormal-
izable for dg = 0.
In conclusion, for renormalizable theories in d dimensions, dg = 0 and the coupling
constant g is dimensionless.
15.17 Summary
The divergences of a quantum ﬁeld theory were analyzed using Feynman diagrams.
Various procedures were used to make the divergences intelligible, with all of them
giving the same result. An arbitrary scale μ was seen to be essential for deﬁning
the renormalized theory, with all physically measurable quantities, of necessity,

being independent of μ. Wilson gave a deep and intuitive understanding of what
it means to renormalize a quantum ﬁeld. Wilson renormalization gives a clear
physical explanation of the procedure of renormalization as the integrating out of
the high momentum degrees of freedom; the arbitrary scale μ reﬂects how many
“shells” of the high momentum degrees of freedom have been integrated out – and
hence is arbitrary.
It is one of the mysteries of renormalization that additive inﬁnities, such as m +
δm and λ + δλ, can be removed by the multiplicative redeﬁnitions of the original
(bare) Lagrangian. The other mystery is how it is possible that by redeﬁning the
bare Lagrangian, which has only a few terms, all the higher correlation functions
are rendered ﬁnite – and yield a completely ﬁnite theory to all orders in perturbation
theory.
A partial answer is given in the next chapter on the renormalization group. The
key idea introduced in renormalization theory by Wilson, and discussed in some
detail in Chapters 16 and 17, is the concept of the “ﬁxed point” of the renormal-
ization group. The ﬁxed point is an “ultraviolet ﬁxed point” for the case of high
energy physics and an “infraviolet ﬁxed point” for the case of phase transitions. The
existence of ﬁxed points is the fundamental reason that a theory is renormalizable.
The existence of a ﬁxed point action is not a perturbative concept, but rather a global
and exact property of the complete action functional.
The number of parameters that need to be renormalized for obtaining a ﬁnite
theory is a property of the ﬁxed point. The existence of the ﬁxed point results in the
fact that perturbation theory can be rendered ﬁnite order by order – to all orders –
by renormalizing only a few parameters.

16.1 Introduction
The perturbation expansion of ϕ4 nonlinear scalar quantum ﬁelds yields diver-
gent results. An analysis of bare perturbation theory shows that a redeﬁnition of
the bare parameters, using the scheme of multiplicative renormalization, removes
all the divergences. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that varied renormalization
schemes, including the background ﬁeld method and Wilson renormalization, yield
the same results.
The momentum scale μ that appears in dimensional regularization is a general
feature of renormalization. In every scheme, a momentum or length scale must be
chosen for deﬁning the renormalized coupling constant and masses in terms of the
bare ones. The renormalization group reveals the physical signiﬁcance of the appar-
ently arbitrary scale μ. The renormalization group is a mathematical formalism for
studying the behavior of a system under a change of scale, which, in the present
case, means changing μ. In particular, the renormalization group determines how
the coupling constants change with a change of scale; the renormalization group
transformation relates the coupling constants at two different scales.1
Wilson’s approach to renormalization is the most intuitive – based on integrating
out the high momentum degrees of freedom – and is the most general scheme as
well. An exact deﬁnition of the Callan–Symanzik equation is given in Eq. 15.14.13.
The Callan–Symanzik equation is a realization of the renormalization group. How-
ever, it is fairly complicated to obtain the implications of the Callan–Symanzik
equation from the deﬁnition given in Eq. 15.14.13.
A computationally transparent analysis of renormalization is provided by bare
perturbation theory using dimensional regularization. The renormalized theory is
1 The renormalization group technically speaking is a semi-group, with the transformation only increasing the
scale; the renormalization group transformation is closed under multiplication, but does not have an inverse, as
is the case for semi-group.

deﬁned entirely in terms of the bare theory, with the renormalized theory being
deﬁned in terms of the bare theory by the procedure of multiplicative redeﬁnition.
Instead of starting from Eq. 15.14.13, a more tractable approach is to deﬁne the
Callan–Symanzik equation by analyzing the change in the correlation functions
holding the bare coupling constants and masses ﬁxed.
From Eq. 15.1.2, the renormalization constants Zm, Zϕ, Zλ depend only on λR
and ϵ. Central to the Callan–Symanzik equation is that the bare action is indepen-
dent of the scale parameter; in particular, λB is a ﬁxed quantity; hence, one can
solve for λR in terms of λB, that is,
λR = λR(μ−ϵλB, ϵ)
Using the fact that the renormalization constants Z in dimensional regularization
are independent of mass yields
λB = Zλ(λR, ϵ)λRμϵ
(16.1.1)
mB = Zm(λR, ϵ)mR
(16.1.2)
ϕB = Z1/2
ϕ (λR, ϵ)ϕR
(16.1.3)
where ϵ = 4 −d. Recall that λB, mB, ϵ and ϕB are all independent of the scale
parameter μ. It is for this reason that the renormalized coupling constant λR(μ) is
of central importance in determining how the behavior changes with the change of
scale μ.
16.2 Callan–Symanzik equation
The Callan–Symanzik equation is an example of the renormalization group equa-
tion as it describes how the correlation functions of the quantum ﬁeld theory change
as one changes the scale at which the renormalized coupling constants and masses
are deﬁned.
Consider the bare n-point vacuum expectation value

n(λB, mB, ϵ) = Zn/2
ϕ (μ, λR, ϵ)GR
n(λR, mR, μ, ϵ)
(16.2.1)
A simple derivation of Eq. 16.2.1 follows from the Wilson renormalization for-
malism. The bare correlation functions are deﬁned in terms of the original ﬁeld ϕ
with cutoff , and the renormalized correlation functions are deﬁned in terms of
the slow variables ϕs with cutoff b. The ﬁeld ϕs is rescaled and ϕs →Z1/2

by the deﬁnition of the bare Lagrangian, which is independent of the renormalized

The renormalized coupling constant λR = λR(μ) is a running coupling constant
that “runs” with the scale μ; it has a dependence on μ to precisely offset the
variation of the renormalized theory so that the bare theory is independent of the
arbitrary scale μ.
Noteworthy 16.1 Dimension of Connected Green’s Function
The “engineering dimension” of Gn(x1, . . . , xn) ≡Gn(x) is determined by the
dimension of the scalar ﬁeld ϕ, given in Section 14.2 by dϕ = (2 −d)/2. From
its deﬁnition
[Gn(x)] = μ−ndϕ = μn(d/2−1)
The momentum space Green’s function is given by
Gn(p1 · · · pn) =

dx1 · · · dxne−i 8N
i=1 pixiGn(x1 · · · xn)
Hence
[Gn(p1 · · · pn)] ≡[Gn(p)] = μ−ndμn(d/2−1) = μ−n(d/2+1) = μ−dn; dn = n(d/2 + 1)

440
β-function; ﬁxed points
If there are no masses, then the scaling of the Green’s function yields the following:
Gn(μp1 · · · μpn) = μ−n(d/2+1)Gn(p1 · · · pn)
(16.2.9)
Consider the example of the two-point function given by
G2(p1, p2) = δd(p1 + p2)G2(p1)
with
G2(p) =

d4xe−ipxE[ϕR(x)ϕR(0)] =

d4xe−ipxG2(x)
The two-point function for the free ﬁeld is given by
G0
2(p1, p2) = δd(p1 + p2)
p2
= δd(p1 + p2)G0
2(p2)
Hence, the engineering dimension of G0
2(p), from above, is given by
G0
2(etp) = e−2tG0
2(p)
(16.2.10)
For the free ﬁeld
G0
2(etp1, etp2) = e−td−2t δd(p1 + p2)
p2
= e−2t(d/2+1)G0
2(p1, p2)
which is the engineering dimension dn given in Eq. 16.2.9 with n = 2.
In general, for a free ﬁeld the scaling properties of a Green’s function are
determined by its engineering dimension, whereas for a renormalizable quantum
ﬁeld theory, the scaling properties are determined by the interactions.

Consider the renormalized n-point function

which is related to the bare n-point function by the following:

so that all the masses can be ignored and, in effect, one can take mR = 0.
Note etμ has the scale of momentum and behaves under scaling like a momen-
tum variable. The scaling of all the momenta, from Eq. 16.2.9, yields
Gn(etp, etμ, λR(t)) = e−tdnGn(p, μ, λR(t))
(16.3.3)
The coupling constant λR(t) remains unchanged above since it is dimensionless and
does not scale as a momentum.
Hence, Eqs. 16.3.2 and 16.3.3 yield
Gn(etp, μ, λR(0)) = en(t)Gn(etp, etμ, λR(t))
(16.3.4)
= e(−tn(d/2+1)+n(t))Gn(p, μ, λR(t))
(16.3.5)
The engineering dimension of the Green’s function Gn, namely dn, has been
modiﬁed due to the renormalization arising from the higher momentum degrees
of freedom, and the Green’s function has an anomalous dimension given by dn −
n(t)/t. From Eq. 16.3.4, it follows that the high momentum etp asymptotic behav-
ior of Gn is determined by its anomalous dimension and by value of λR(t) at the
high momentum.

(16.4.1)
Figure 16.1 shows that λR(μ) increases as μ increases; the approximation breaks
down for μm given by

3λ0 μ0
The expression for the running coupling constant λR(μ) is valid only for μ < μm.
The value of the coupling constant λR(μ) at μ in terms of the theory at μ0 is free from
any divergence. It is only when μ →∞that the ultraviolet divergences appear.
As expressed in the Callan–Symanzik equation, the value of μ0 is arbitrary. In
particular, a change in μ0 can be compensated by a corresponding change in the
value of λR(μ0) and yields
μ0

Hence, there has to be a constraint on the dependence of λR(μ) on μ such that
λR(μ) = f{α ln(μ/μ0) + h(λR(μ0))}

does not have the form in Eq. 16.4.5. It is only Eq. 16.4.1, obtained by integrating
the β-function, that has the correct functional form, as required by Eq. 16.4.5.
Eq. 16.4.5 yields the scale s deﬁned by
λR(μ) = f(ln(μ/s))
with
s = μ0e−h(λR(μ0))
The appearance of the arbitrary scale s breaks scale invariance; in other words, the
necessity of renormalizing a quantum ﬁeld theory leads to the breaking of scale
invariance.
The fundamental reason that the renormalization group improves the pertur-
bation expansion is because it replaces the bare coupling constant λB by the
renormalized running coupling constant λR(μ). As long as λR(μ) << 1, the theory
has an improved perturbation expansion for correlations with momentum less than
μ. This is due to the fact that the leading logarithms have all been summed up in
the expression of λR(μ).

16.5 Renormalization group
The renormalization group relates the renormalized coupling constants and masses
at different scales. A reﬂection of this is found in the various schemes for renormal-
izing a quantum ﬁeld, and this aspect is studied using the one-loop results for ϕ4
theory.
The result obtained for the β-function in Eq. 16.4.1 is valid to O(λ2

As can be seen from Eq. 16.5.1, the description of the quantum ﬁeld at the scale μ
(given by λR(μ)) in terms of the behavior of the quantum ﬁeld at momentum scale
μ0 (given by λR(μ0)) is completely ﬁnite since the ratio of these two scales given by
μ/μ0 is ﬁnite. The earlier result, obtained in Eq. 15.7.3, relating the renormalized
coupling constants at two different momentum scales is equivalent to Eq. 16.5.1;
the various coupling constants are shown in Figure 16.2.
All the divergences of quantum ﬁeld theory are due to describing the correlation
functions at a ﬁnite scale μ in terms of the bare quantum ﬁeld that is deﬁned at
the cutoff scale  – and which needs to be taken to inﬁnity to restore full Lorentz
invariance. This feature of the quantum ﬁeld can also be seen in Eq. 16.5.1: If we
set μ =  we recover the relation of the bare to the renormalized coupling constant
given in Eq. 15.11.6; the transformation from λR() to λR(μ0) becomes singular at
 →∞.
To illustrate the workings of the renormalization group, consider two differ-
ent renormalization procedures using (1) the background ﬁeld method and (1) the
scheme of minimal subtraction (MS).
The renormalized coupling constant in the background ﬁeld method, from
Eq. 15.12.13, is given by

are deﬁned at two different scales – and are related by the renormalization group
transformation since they both are representations of the same underlying quantum
ﬁeld.

ized mass. Since

MS scheme by the renormalization group transformation.
16.6 Physical mass and coupling constant
The derivation of the β-function β and of γm, which determines how the renormal-
ized coupling constant λR and mass mR depend on the scale μ, respectively, was
based on the formal properties of the Callan–Symanzik equation; the same result is
derived from a more intuitive point of view.
Recall from Eq. 15.5.5, the physically measured mass is given in terms of the
renormalized coupling constant and scale parameter μ by the following:

The physically measured mass and coupling constant are independent of the
arbitrary scale μ, and are said to be renormalization group invariant. To achieve this
invariance requires making both λR and mR to be functions of μ. The dependence
of λR(μ) and mR(μ) on μ is such that all physically measured quantities like

scale μ. The results are obtained using the Callan–Symanzik equation and are given
in Eq. 16.2.6.

ϵ = 1 since the system being studied has d = 3, and sometimes the system has
d = 2, 1 dimensions. Hence, the behavior for ϵ ̸= 0 is of physical interest.

where g is the renormalized coupling constant. A β-function similar to this case
occurs for the Yang–Mills gauge ﬁelds of quantum chromodynamics, with the
difference being that the β-function has the following behavior:
β = μ ∂g
∂μ = ϵg −ag3
(16.7.4)
with a = 11Nc/(48π2) for SU(Nc) gauge ﬁelds [Peskin and Schroeder (1995)].
The β-function given in Eq. 16.7.3 is analyzed, since it is simpler and has the same
qualitative behavior as Yang–Mills gauge ﬁelds.
Note that Eq. 16.7.3 is the same as Eq. 16.7.1, except that the signs of both ϵ and
a are reversed. Hence, for both of these β-functions, the ﬁxed point is given by g∗
β(g∗) = 0 ⇒g∗= ϵ/a
The solution of the running coupling is the same as Eq. 16.7.2 except for the crucial
difference of the sign of ϵ in Eq. 16.7.2. Hence, t = ln(μ/μ0) yields
g(t) =

1 −(1 −g∗
g0 )e−ϵ(t−t0)

All initial couplings ﬂow to g∗as t →∞, as shown in Figure 16.4(a). This is
quite the opposite of the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point for which all couplings with
λ0 > λ∗ﬂow to inﬁnity as one increases the momentum scale. In fact, as discussed
earlier, once the coupling constant becomes large, one cannot use the results of the
one-loop β-function as perturbation theory is no longer valid.
Taking the limit of ϵ = 0 for Eq. 16.7.5 yields

β-function; ﬁxed points
Eq. 16.7.6 is the famous result of asymptotic freedom that shows that, since the
sign yields a > 0, the coupling becomes weaker as the scale of momentum μ
is increased, and at inﬁnite momentum the theory is a free ﬁeld theory and is an
ultraviolet free theory. For this reason, an asymptotically free theory is the only
quantum ﬁeld theory that can be deﬁned all the way to inﬁnite momentum; all the
short-distance properties of the theory can be determined in principle using the
weak coupling Feynman perturbation theory. The most famous asymptotically free
theory is the Yang–Mills gauge ﬁeld.
16.8 β-function and ﬁxed points
In general, the ﬁxed points of the β-function are deﬁned by
β(λ∗) = 0
The ﬂow of the running coupling constants for various ﬁxed points is determined
by the sign of
β′ ≡∂β(λ∗)
∂λ
The renormalized running coupling λ(μ) deﬁnes the effective coupling at
momentum μ, where μ ∈[0, ∞].
At the ﬁxed point, the derivative of β(λ∗) determines the stability or instability
of the ﬁxed point. The two options are
β(λ∗) = 0; β′(λ∗) < 0: Ultraviolet ﬁxed point
or
β(λ∗) = 0; β′(λ∗) > 0: Infrared ﬁxed point
For the β-function given in Eq. 16.7.3
β′(λ∗) = −ϵ < 0
and theory has an ultraviolet ﬁxed point. An infrared theory is one for which all
initial values of the running coupling constant ﬂow into the ﬁxed point value λ∗, as
shown in Figure 16.3(a) and (b). The Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point yields
β′(λ∗) = ϵ > 0
and theory has an infrared ﬁxed point.
Near the ﬁxed point, such that λ ≈λ∗, Taylor expansion yields
μ ∂λ
∂μ = β(λ) = β′(λ −λ∗) + O(λ−λ∗)2
⇒λ −λ∗= exp{β′ ln(μ)}; β′ = β′(λ∗)

The scale of renormalization μ goes to inﬁnity for the ultraviolet limit and is zero
in the infrared limit. For these two limits, Eq. 16.8.1 yields

Infrared ﬁxed point
The ultraviolet and infrared ﬁxed points are shown in Figure 16.5(a) and (b),
respectively. For the ultraviolet ﬁxed point, the coupling constant starts from the
critical value of λ∗for inﬁnite cutoff μ = ∞; the renormalized coupling ﬂows
away from the ultraviolet ﬁxed point as the cutoff is decreased. In contrast, for the
infrared ﬁxed point, the renormalized coupling ﬂows into the infrared ﬁxed point as
the cutoff is decreased to zero, given by μ →0.
The theory in Figure 16.4(a) and (b) shows the behavior of an ultraviolet ﬁxed
point, with all initial coupling ﬂowing away from the value of λ∗. The β-function is
given by Figure 16.4(b). The arrows on the λ-axis indicate the ﬂow of λ(μ) under
the renormalization group.
The behavior of λ(μ) that corresponds to different β-functions is shown in
Figure 16.6.
The β-functions for the infrared and ultraviolet ﬁxed points, for d = 4, are given
in 1 and 2 of Figure 16.6, respectively. An infrared ﬁxed point β(λ) ≃λ2 > 0 is
given by 1(a) and 1(b) in Figure 16.6; as μ →0, the running coupling constant
ﬂows to λ∗; for ϕ4 theory λ∗= 0. In contrast, for an ultraviolet ﬁxed point given by
2(a) and 2(b) in Figure 16.6, β(g) ≃−g2 < 0; the critical coupling constant for this
case is also zero: g∗= 0; the running coupling constant starts at g∗= 0 as μ →∞.

dimensions. However, in the neighborhood of a nonlinear and interacting ﬁxed
point, the anomalous dimension of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ is a result of the scaling
properties of the ﬁxed point. This feature of the ﬁxed point of the quantum ﬁeld is
discussed further in Chapter 17.
Recall from Eq. 16.3.4, under the scaling of the momentum, the Green’s function
has the following behavior:
Gn(etp, μ, λR(0)) = e−tn(d/2+1)+n(t)Gn(p, μ, λR(t))
where μ is the renormalization scale.
Consider the two-point function; Eq. 16.3.4 yields
G2(etp1, etp2, μ, λR(0)) = e−td−2t+2(t)G2(p1, p2, μ, λR(t))
(16.9.1)
The two-point function is given by
G2(p1, p2) = δd(p1 + p2)G2(p1)
(16.9.2)
From Eq. 16.9.2
G2(etp1, etp2) = e−dtδ(p1 + p2)G2(etp1) = e−td−2t+2(t)G2(p1, p2, )
⇒G2(etp1) = e−2t+2(t)G2(p1)
(16.9.3)
In the case of the free ﬁeld, there is no anomalous dimension, as given in Eq.
16.2.10; however, the presence of a nontrivial ﬁxed point changes the scaling behav-
ior of the quantum ﬁeld. Writing out Eq. 16.9.3 in full yields

G2(etp, μ, λR(0)) = e−2t+2(t)G2(p, μ, λR(t))

As it stands, Eq. 16.9.4 cannot be explicitly solved due to the presence of λR(t) on
the right-hand side. However, for large t the existence of an ultraviolet ﬁxed point
allows for a solution.
The high momentum behavior of the theory is determined by the limit of t →∞.
Suppose the theory has an ultraviolet ﬁxed point; the running coupling constant will
converge to λ∗, its value at the ﬁxed point, and hence
t →∞⇒λR(t) →λ∗
Let the value of γϕ at the ﬁxed point be denoted by γϕ∗= γϕ(λ∗). We then have

Each logarithm term is given by a Feynman diagram and the Callan–Symanzik
equation sums up an inﬁnite set of Feynman diagrams to yield the scaling result.
One can obtain the scaling properties of the Green’s function directly from the
Callan–Symanzik equation. From Eq. 16.2.4, using the fact that at the ﬁxed point

large momentum transfer.
16.10 Summary
The Callan–Symanzik equation was derived using the computationally transpar-
ent framework of bare perturbation theory. An arbitrary scale μ is introduced for
deﬁning the renormalized mass and coupling constant(s). Leveraging on the simple
fact that the bare theory has no information of the scale μ, it follows that all bare
correlation functions must be independent of μ. Expressing the bare correlation
function in terms of the renormalized ones, it follows that the renormalized mass
and coupling constant have to depend on μ in such a manner that the bare theory is
independent of μ. This constraint is expressed by the Callan–Symanik equation.
The β-function is a function of the renormalized coupling constant and is given
by the variation of the coupling constant when μ is changed. The β-function being
zero, as is the case for the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point, is a result of the quantum
ﬁeld theory being scale invariant. The β-function is zero at the ﬁxed points of the
renormalization group transformation.
Fixed points lead to a dramatic simpliﬁcation of the correlation functions due
to scale invariance. Solving the Callan–Symanzik equation, in effect, allows one
to sum inﬁnite classes of Feynman diagrams to yield scale-invariant correlation
functions.
Fixed points play a central role in quantum ﬁeld theory. Ultraviolet ﬁxed points
are necessary for the renormalizability of quantum ﬁelds. In contrast, infrared ﬁxed
points determine the long-distance behavior of a quantum ﬁeld, and a nontrivial
infrared ﬁxed point describes the onset of a second-order phase transition.

Renormalization group and phase transitions
17.1 Introduction
The foundation of quantum ﬁeld theory was far from clear up to the 1960s, espe-
cially since the procedure of renormalization, by which inﬁnities were removed
from physical quantities, seemed to be ad hoc if not outright wrong. As observed
by Wilson, “the intuitive ideas [of renormalization] were encased in a thick shell
of formalism” [Wilson and Kogut (1974)]. But since experiments supported the
results obtained from quantum ﬁeld theory, the idea of renormalization could not
be set aside that easily.
Wilson demonstrated that renormalization, far from being an ad hoc procedure,
is at the very essence of quantum ﬁeld theory and is a reﬂection of the inﬁnitely
many coupled length scales that constitute a quantum ﬁeld theory. He further
demonstrated that a quantum ﬁeld theory is renormalizable because of a ﬁxed point
at inﬁnite momentum; the existence of this ﬁxed point has been termed by ﬁeld
theorist A.S. Wightman as: “Wilson’s vision of physics at inﬁnite momentum”.
A major result of Chapter 16 is the crucial role of ﬁxed points in the scheme
of renormalizing a quantum ﬁeld. Although the main motivation in the study of
renormalization is the taming of ultraviolet (UV) inﬁnities – which is made possible
by the existence of the UV ﬁxed point – a rather unexpected result from the point of
view of high energy physics is the existence of the infrared (IR) ﬁxed point. What
is the physical content of the IR ﬁxed point?
IR ﬁxed points don’t play a very big role in high energy physics since they are
not related to the problem of renormalization. It was the genius of Ken Wilson
that he identiﬁed the IR ﬁxed point with a phenomenon outside the domain of
quantum physics. His pioneering and ground-breaking work shows that the IR ﬁxed
points correspond to the description of statistical mechanical systems undergoing
a classical second-order phase transition.
To study phase transitions, the momentum scale μ has to be lowered to zero,
quite the opposite of raising the cutoff to inﬁnity as required by theories of
455

Renormalization group and phase transitions
high energy physics. Renormalizing the quantum ﬁeld by lowering its cutoff, as
discussed in Section 15.13, results in a series of renormalized actions that start at
the UV ﬁxed point and end at the IR ﬁxed point. To analyze the trajectory followed
by the renormalized actions, one needs to ﬁrst deﬁne the space of all possible
actions, called the Wilson space. Furthermore, the nature and detailed structure of
the ﬁxed points need to be studied to extract what features of observed systems are
determined by the structure of the ﬁxed points.
The focus of this chapter is on the ﬁxed points of the renormalization proce-
dure, studied in the context of the β-function in Chapter 16, and the topology and
geometry of Wilson space.
A ground-breaking result of Wilson’s analysis is that the same mathematical
system of quantum ﬁelds that explains the renormalizability of quantum ﬁelds
is also equally applicable to the study of phase transitions. The reason that this
result is unexpected is because phase transitions in statistical mechanics are the
result of purely classical randomness with no quantum uncertainty and no ¯h.
Furthermore, phase transitions are explained by equilibrium statistical mechanics
where there is no element of time. In contrast, quantum ﬁelds that occur in
quantum phenomena obey the principle of quantum uncertainty and are dynamical
time-dependent ﬁelds. The explanation offered by Wilson for this unexpected
connection is that both classical phase transitions and quantum ﬁelds are described
by systems with inﬁnitely many coupled length scales; this is the main property
of the two systems that makes their mathematical description identical [Wilson
(1983)].
The result that classical phase transitions can be described by the Wilson renor-
malization group has led to the idea that ﬁnancial meltdowns are also a form of
phase transitions. The ideas of the renormalization group and phase transitions have
been applied to ﬁnance by Sornette (2003) and Sornette and Zhou (2006).
Wilson’s formulation of renormalization allows one to isolate the speciﬁc degree
of freedom that one is interested in, and then go on to calculate the effect of all
the other degrees of freedom on the case in question. In the case of high energy
physics, one is interested in the behavior of the system at high energies and one
studies the degrees of freedom near the UV ﬁxed point. In contrast, for critical
systems, it is the long-distance degrees of freedom that are of importance and one
is led to study the system near the IR ﬁxed point. The idea of separately analyzing
the different length scales in a system with many scales has applications in many
areas of social science. For the purpose of illustrating the generality of the idea
of “thinning out the degrees of freedom,” note that in network theory real-space
renormalization group technique has been used for locating a mobile phone in a
wireless mobile network by “integrating out” the short-distance degrees of freedom
[Simkin and Olness (2001)].

17.2 Renormalization group
457
The fundamental reason why apparent divergences arise in quantum ﬁeld theory
is because one is describing parameters at very large scales in terms of the parame-
ters at the very small scale. Once one describes, for example, parameters at a given
scale in terms of parameters of nearby scales, the theory is perfectly ﬁnite and there
are no divergences.
This chapter analyzes the structure of the renormalization trajectory, ﬁxed points
and Wilson space. Applications of the renormalization group in particle physics
are discussed in Section 17.4 and in phase transitions in Section 17.10. The salient
properties of phase transitions are brieﬂy discussed and their connection to renor-
malization is elucidated. The ﬁxed point of the renormalization group transforma-
tion is analyzed and leads to the classiﬁcation of the functionals of the quantum
ﬁeld into relevant and irrelevant operators.
The term “quantum ﬁeld” is used as a generic term encompassing its applications
to both quantum ﬁeld theory and the theory of phase transitions. The terms “quan-
tum ﬁeld” and “quantum ﬁeld theory” should be viewed as belonging to quantum
mathematics instead of being tied to their applications to quantum phenomena.
17.2 Renormalization group
The Wilson space is the space of all possible actions S =

L. A single point in
this space represents a speciﬁc and particular action. For the ϕ4 theory, the two free
parameters m, λ are the coordinates of the space. To discuss the renormalization
group in general, the coordinates of this space are labeled by functions, namely
u2(p1, p2), u4(p1, p2, p3, p4), . . . with the action given by
S[ϕ] = −1
2

p1,p2
u2(p1, p2)ϕp1ϕp2−1
4!

p1,p2,p3,p4
u4(p1, p2, p3, p4)ϕp1ϕp2ϕp3ϕp4+· · ·
The coordinates of Wilson space consist of all possible interactions and are given
by all possible functions u2(p1, p2), u4(p1, p2, p3, p4), . . .; hence the space is inﬁnite
dimensional.1 In its full generality, the action functional need not have a Hamil-
tonian, as the existence of the Hamiltonian requires couplings in time to be only
through time derivative couplings such as ∂ϕ/∂t – and no nonlocal couplings in the
time direction are allowed.
From Eq. 15.14.12, the partition function is given by

Renormalization group and phase transitions
where S[ϕ] is the original action and S[ϕ, b] is the renormalized action with all
degrees of freedom with momentum higher than b having been integrated out.
Eq. 15.14.12 can be represented by the renormalization group transformation R
as follows:
S[ϕ, b] = R(b)S[ϕ]
(17.2.1)
Since the form of S[ϕ, b] is exactly the same as S[ϕ] except for the parameters that
have been renormaized, one can do a second transformation to reduce the cutoff
from b to b′b, b′ < 1 and obtain
S[ϕ, b′b] = R(b′)S[ϕ, b] = R(b′)R(b)S[ϕ]
One can do a direct transformation on the original action to reduce the cutoff to
b′b in one – instead of two – steps and obtain
S[ϕ, b′b] = R(b′b)S[ϕ]
Hence, one obtains that the renormalization group transformations form an Abelian
semi-group given by the composition law2
R(b′)R(b) = R(b′b)
A more convenient notation for this chapter is to let the arbitrary renormalization
scale b be written as follows:3
b ≡μ = e−t; t ∈[0, ∞]
and from Eq. 17.2.1, using simpliﬁed notation
S[e−t] = R(e−t)S[]; R() = 1
⇒St = RtS0; R0 = 1
(17.2.2)
Hence, as t increases from 0 to ∞, the renormalized action describes correlation
functions with momentum less than e−t.
The renormalization group transformation generates a set of actions S[ϕ, b] = St
with the initial (bare) action given by S0 with a momentum cutoff . An inﬁnites-
imal change in the renormalized action is obtained by setting t′ = t + ϵ and
integrating out the degrees of freedom in the momentum shell [e−t, e−(t+ϵ)].
From Eq. 17.2.2
St+ϵ = Rt+ϵS0 = RϵRtS0 = RϵSt
St + ϵ ∂St
∂t = RϵSt
⇒
∂St
∂t = 1
ϵ [Rϵ −1]St →∂R
∂t St ≡U[St]
2 The renormalization group (RG) is a semi-group since R−1 does not exist. However, it can be shown that RG
trajectories do not intersect. For this reason, an RG trajectory can be continued backward, in effect raising the
cutoff. Taking this into consideration renders the RG to be a full Abelian group.
3 The parameter t used in Chapter 16 is not the same as the parameter t of this chapter. They differ by a sign.

17.3 Wilson space
459
Hence, the renormalized action St+ϵ is obtained from St by the renormalization
group transformation given by
∂St
∂t = U[St]
(17.2.3)
Since there is a change of scale in going from S0 to St, any physical quantity
computed by the action St must be rescaled. In particular, let the correlation length
at t = 0 be denoted by ξ0 and let the correlation length computed using action St
be denoted by ξt. The momentum scale has been changed by the relation p = e−tq
in going from S0 to St. Hence, distances for St scale as the inverse of momentum
and yield
ξ0 = etξt
(17.2.4)
The trajectory in Wilson space of St, as t is varied from 0 to ∞, is called the
renormalization group trajectory, or sometimes renormalization trajectory in short.
If the renormalization group trajectory approaches an infrared ﬁxed point, it is
called an IR trajectory and similarly a UV trajectory if it emanates from a UV
ﬁxed point.
The Callan–Zymanzik equation, discussed in Section 16.2, determines the
change of the renormalized correlation functions as one changes the momentum
scale μ = e−t at which the renormalized theory is deﬁned. The renormalization
group transformation ∂St/∂t is the generalization of the Callan–Zymanzik equation
and is deﬁned directly in terms of the action. The functional form of the action St,
in general, changes as one changes μ.
The renormalization group also has a realization using the concept of block-spin,
where “blocks” of degrees of freedom are combined to form new renormalized
degrees of freedom [Wilson (1983)]. A toy model for block-spin renormalization
using the Ising model is given in Baaquie (2014).
17.3 Wilson space
The ﬁxed points of the renormalization group play a central role in deﬁning a
renormalized quantum ﬁeld as well as in the theory of phase transitions. The role
and existence of a ﬁxed point action has a transparent and intuitive formulation in
Wilson’s approach to renormalization.
Consider the space A of all possible actions S; one can represent any action
by an inﬁnite-dimensional functional Taylor expansion in terms of the derivatives
of the ﬁelds. The coefﬁcient functions of this expansion can be considered as the
“coordinates” of the space of all possible actions. Hence, action space is inﬁnite
dimensional. The renormalization trajectory refers to the trajectory in action space
A followed by St for t ∈[0, ∞].

460
Renormalization group and phase transitions
At a ﬁxed point the action is invariant under a change of scale and hence the
ﬁxed point action S∗is invariant under renormalization; from Eq. 17.2.3
0 = ∂S∗
∂t = U[S∗] = 0
⇒U[S∗] = 0 : Renormalization group invariant
The renormalization group transformation changes the scale of the action and St
describes the behavior of the Lagrangian at the scale e−t. The ﬁxed point action is
invariant under a scale transformation and hence the ﬁxed point action describes a
phenomenon that is scale invariant. Scale invariance implies the action is at a ﬁxed
point since
∂St
∂t = 0 ⇒St = S∗: Scale invariant
For the ﬁxed point action S∗, from Eq. 17.2.4, the correlation length is given by
ξ∗= etξ∗
Hence at the ﬁxed point the action’s correlation length is either 0 or ∞:
ξ∗= 0, ∞
(17.3.1)
Ignoring the case of ξ∗= 0 that corresponds to a system for which all the degrees
of freedom are decoupled, the ﬁxed point action S∗describes a critical system with
inﬁnite correlation:
ξ∗= ∞: Critical system
The renormalization trajectory ﬂows away from the UV ﬁxed point as one inte-
grates out the high momentum degrees of freedom, as shown in Figure 16.5(a), and
in doing so one increases t. On the other hand, the renormalization trajectory ﬂows
into the IR ﬁxed point as one probes the long-distance behavior and is shown in
Figure 16.5(b).
As one can see from the description of the renormalization ﬂows and ﬁxed
points, a ﬁxed point is neither intrinsically UV or IR: rather, its signiﬁcance is
determined by the renormalization trajectory. As shown in Figure 17.1, when the
renormalization trajectory ﬂows towards a ﬁxed point, the ﬁxed point appears to
be an IR ﬁxed point, and the same ﬁxed point appears as an UV ﬁxed point when
the renormalization trajectory ﬂows away from it [Huang (2010)]. Fixed points
are sources or sinks for renormalization group trajectories, with the UV being the
source of renormalization group trajectories and the IR being the sink.
There are some differences between IR and UV trajectories. The correlation
length along a renormalization group trajectory decreases, as given by Eq. 17.2.4;
since the IR trajectory ends up at the IR ﬁxed point that has inﬁnite correlation for

the case of a critical system and hence lies on the critical surface, the bare theory
has to approach the critical surface inﬁnitesimally close, as in Figure 17.2. The UV
trajectory has ﬁnite correlation length and hence the bare theory can lie on the UV
trajectory, as in Figure 17.2. If the IR and UV ﬁxed points are close to each other,
the renormalization group trajectory may seem to be an IR trajectory but may then
switch to an UV trajectory [Huang (2010)].
17.4 Fixed points and renormalizability
Quantum ﬁeld theories in particle physics must meet the requirement of relativistic
invariance. The quantum ﬁeld operators ϕ(t, ⃗x) and ϕ(t′, ⃗x′) at two space-like
separated points must commute due to the requirement of relativity – since
measurement at these space-like points must be causally independent. The quantum
ﬁeld, at each space point, is an independent degree of freedom, and hence “any

462
Renormalization group and phase transitions
region of ﬁnite size contains an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom” [Wilson
and Kogut (1974)].
Relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories of necessity must explain phenomena with the
distance scale ranging from zero to inﬁnity. One can render the quantum ﬁeld theory
ﬁnite by regularizing it – for example, by using a momentum cutoff 0 or a lattice
cutoff. As discussed in Chapter 14, on naively quantizing a nonlinear relativistic
ﬁeld, one encounters the so-called ultraviolet divergences, which are inﬁnities that
arise when the cutoff 0 goes to inﬁnity.
A necessary requirement of all quantum ﬁeld theories in particle physics is that of
renormalizability, a term used to denote theories that are free from ultraviolet diver-
gences. A renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theory leads to all correlation functions
being ﬁnite; in particular, the model calculation of all experimentally measurable
quantities is ﬁnite.
Wilson (1983) provided a fundamental understanding of quantum ﬁeld theories
by studying the problem of renormalization in the larger context of the behavior of
systems with inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom. Wilson utilized the key
concepts of the renormalization group and its ﬁxed points – as well as renormal-
ization ﬂows in Wilson space – to elucidate the exact nature of renormalization.
In particular, Wilson showed that the cutoff theory must have inﬁnite correlation
length for a quantum ﬁeld theory to be renormalizable.
Consider a quantum ﬁeld theory with a momentum cutoff 0. A renormalizable
quantum ﬁeld theory is ﬁnite in the limit of 0 →∞.
The following discussion is based on Wilson and Kogut (1974). Under renor-
malization, which entails lowering the cutoff of the action from 0 to e−t0, one
generates the sequence of actions St. As discussed in Section 17.2, the renormaliza-
tion transformation generates a set of actions St with the initial (bare) action given
by S0. The renormalization group transformation is given by
∂St
∂t = U[St]
with the ﬁxed points of the renormalization group transformation given by
U[S∗] = 0: ξ = 0 or ∞
17.4.1 Renormalization ﬂows in Wilson space
To simplify the discussion on renormalization, suppose there exists an ultraviolet
ﬁxed point SUV with inﬁnite correlation length and an infrared ﬁxed point SIR with
zero correlation length:4
4 This assumption is quite realistic since Yang–Mills quantum ﬁelds have an ultraviolet ﬁxed point – which is a
massless Gaussian (free) quantum ﬁeld with inﬁnite correlation length – and an infrared ﬁxed point with zero
correlation length, which is the conﬁning phase of the quantum ﬁeld.

Figure 17.3 shows the key features of Wilson space that are required for renormal-
izing a relativistic quantum ﬁeld.
• The infrared ﬁxed point action is S∗≡SIR and the ultraviolet ﬁxed point action is
S∗≡SUV.
• A line is marked P in Figure 17.8 for the physical surface. A point on the physical
line P is the location of the bare action. Points on the line P correspond to different
values of parameters, such as mass μ0 and coupling constant λ0, with the initial
cutoff of the bare action being ﬁnite.
• There is a critical surface, marked C in Figure 17.8, that has inﬁnite correlation
length ξ. The physical line intersects the critical line C for an inﬁnite cutoff,
namely 0 = ∞.
• The line marked E in Figure 17.8 is a trajectory that lies on a section of the critical
line (surface).
• The ultraviolet ﬁxed point SUV lies in C. It is important to note that all actions on
the critical surface (line) have inﬁnite correlation length. But they are not at the
ﬁxed point of the renormalization group.
• One can think of the critical surface C as being a ridge, with the action SUV being
at a saddle point of the critical surface.
• The line marked by R is a trajectory obeying the renormalization group equation
that ﬂows from the ultraviolet ﬁxed point SUV to the infrared ﬁxed point SIR.
Actions on R have ﬁnite correlation length.

464
Renormalization group and phase transitions
• Lines marked with dimensionless correlation length ξ indicate actions in Wilson
space with the same correlation length.
For action given by St, the physical correlation length ˜ξt is deﬁned by
lim
|x|→∞E[ϕt(0)ϕt(x)] = 1
Zt

DϕteStϕt(0)ϕt(x) ≈e−|x|/˜ξt
The scale of distance for action St increases with an increase in t, as given in
Eq. 17.2.4.
The ﬁxed points determine the renormalizability of a quantum ﬁeld. Rescale
all the dimensional quantities in the bare action S0 by appropriate powers of 0
and this renders all the actions in Wilson space to be dimensionless; for notational
simplicity denote the dimensionless action by the notation S0(0). The action S0 is
rescaled and the physical correlation length ˜ξt deﬁnes a dimensionless correlation
length ξt [Wilson and Kogut (1974)].
To simplify the notation, consider a ϕ4 scalar ﬁeld with the bare action having
the bare mass term μ0 and the bare coupling constants λ0. The dimensionless action
from Section 14.9, has the following dimensionless parameters r0, u0:
r0(0) = μ2
0/2
0; u0(0) = λ0d−4
0
(17.4.2)
The dimensionless action S0(0) has a dimensionless correlation length that is
determined independent of 0 and depends only on r0, u0, namely
ξ = ξ(r0, u0)
The procedure of renormalization, as discussed in Chapter 15, is to assign a
dependence of r0, u0 on 0 so that the renormalized mass μR and coupling constant
λR are independent of the cutoff 0. The following steps are required to deﬁne the
renormalized theory.
• First, specify the desired or required (ﬁnite) value for the renormalized mass μR;
for our case, u0 is held ﬁxed at some arbitrary nonzero value.5
• Next, choose the cutoff to be given by
0 = μRξ(r0, u0)
(17.4.3)
Since u0 is ﬁxed, Eq. 17.4.2 can be solved to obtain
r0 = r0(0) ⇒μ2
0 = r0(0)2
0; λ0 = u04−d
0
(17.4.4)
• For 0 →∞, Eq. 17.4.3 requires that the system has inﬁnite correlation length,
which entails that the bare Lagrangian must be critical and intersecting the critical
surface C.
5 The renormalization procedure does not depend on the value chosen for u0. For the case of quantum ﬁelds, this
arbitrariness of u0 is a reﬂection of the feature of “universality” that is seen in phase transitions – and discussed
in Noteworthy 17.1.

17.4 Fixed points and renormalizability
465
• Hence, to raise the cutoff to inﬁnity, take the following limit:
0 →∞⇒r0 →roc(u0) ⇒
ξ(roc, u0) →∞
This yields
0 =
lim
r0→roc(u0) μRξ(roc, u0) →∞
• The ﬁnite renormalized mass μR is independent of the cutoff 0 →∞since
μR =
lim
r0→roc(u0)
0
ξ(roc, u0) : ﬁnite
In summary, to take the cutoff 0 →∞, the Lagrangian’s bare mass term is made
to approach the critical surface C and the correlation length ξ →∞, as shown in
Figure 17.3. By construction, the renormalized mass μR is ﬁnite and independent
of 0. Note the crucial point that the system must have correlation length ξ →∞
for the cutoff to go to inﬁnity.
On the critical surface C, all actions have inﬁnite correlation length. The require-
ment of a ﬁxed point comes later, when one requires that the renormalization group
trajectory leave the critical surface and produce, at some scale, a ﬁnite correlation
length ξ.
If one starts on the critical surface, since the velocity ∂St/∂t ̸= 0, as shown in
Figure 17.3, the renormalized trajectory continues to “roll” on the ridge C until it
reaches the saddle point – where the ultraviolet ﬁxed point SUV is located. At the
ﬁxed point, the velocity ∂St/∂t = U(SUV) = 0: The trajectory can hence change its
direction of ﬂow – and roll down along the trajectory indicated by R to the valley.
The UV ﬁxed point is required for the renormalized trajectory to leave the critical
surface and produce a system having ﬁnite renormalized correlation length.
The ultraviolet ﬁxed point acts as a time sink, and the renormalized action St
spends a long time near the ﬁxed point. This is the origin of the (logarithmic and
power law) divergences that arise in perturbation theory. As the system undergoes
further renormalization, it ﬂows to the infrared ﬁxed point SIR on the renormalized
trajectory R, as shown in Figure 17.3. The renormalized trajectory R gives a collec-
tion of actions SR(ξ) that can be labeled by action’s correlation function, namely
SR = SR(ξ), ξ ∈[0, ∞]. The two limiting cases of the renormalization group
trajectory are
SR(ξ) =
 SUV,
ξ = ∞
SIR,
ξ = 0
Consider the points a, b, c and d in Figure 17.3; the point a lies on the renor-
malized trajectory and represents the renormalized action SR(2). As one increases
the cutoff 0, the points d, c, b show how the actions with higher and higher cutoff
0 generate a sequence of actions having ξ = 2, and which ﬁnally converge to the

466
Renormalization group and phase transitions
point a, which has a renormalized action with inﬁnite cutoff. Hence, the point a on
the curve R yields a correlation length of ξ = 2, and with the initial cutoff being
inﬁnite.
The role of the momentum parameter μ in dimensional regularization, as given
in Section 14.9, is played by the correlation length ξ; for the simple case discussed
here, if it is assumed that the form of the action is unchanged, the actions on the
renormalized trajectory R can be solved to yield the running coupling constant
given by
r = r(ξ); u = u(ξ)
In summary, a quantum ﬁeld theory is renormalizable only if the bare Lagrangian
lies on the physical surface P that intersects the critical surface C – and generates
a trajectory in Wilson space that ﬂows from an ultraviolet to an infrared ﬁxed point
of the renormalization group.
The procedure given in Eq. 17.4.3 for renormalization is remarkable since one
usually thinks of correlation length ξ in terms of distance and momentum cutoff 0
as being the inverse of distance. Wilson showed that the diverging correlation length
of a system undergoing a phase transition is equivalent to the cutoff of a quantum
ﬁeld theory going to inﬁnity. And in doing so, Wilson connected two vastly different
disciplines, namely the renormalizability of a quantum theory ﬁeld theory with the
phenomenon of phase transitions.
17.5 Classical phase transitions
Consider a large collection of classical particles obeying the laws of classical
mechanics. The randomness of statistical systems is classical, with the microstates
of the classical system – unlike quantum degrees of freedom – existing objec-
tively, independent of any measurement.6 The statistical mechanical system is in
equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature T. Note that the classical system is in
equilibrium and has no time evolution; also, there is no concept of a state vector,
there is no conservation of probability or a Lagrangian – concepts that are central
for the quantum aspect of quantum ﬁeld theory.
The clearest connection of quantum ﬁeld theory with classical statistical mechan-
ics is in the domain of classical phase transitions. As discussed in Section 17.4,
a renormalizable relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory is equivalent to a system with
an inﬁnite correlation length. A classical phase transition is also described by
inﬁnite correlation length; due to the concept of universality, discussed later in
6 One microstate corresponds to a speciﬁc position and momentum of every particle.

17.6 Second-order phase transition
467
Noteworthy 17.1, it turns out that the mathematics required for describing classical
phase transitions is identical to the mathematics of quantum ﬁeld theory.
The main connecting feature is that both renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theo-
ries and classical phase transitions are manifestations of inﬁnitely many correlated
length scales. Furthermore, both systems are described by ﬁxed points of the renor-
malization group transformations. To explain this idea in some detail, the Landau–
Ginzburg–Wilson formulation of classical statistical mechanics is studied.
17.6 Second-order phase transition
A qualitative change in the bulk property of a classical macroscopic object – due
to changes in its external environment such as temperature and at a critical tem-
perature Tc – is called a phase transition. Classical phase transitions are described
by classical statistical mechanics; they are classiﬁed as undergoing ﬁrst-order or
second-order phase transitions depending on whether the transition is discontin-
uous (having latent heat), which is the case for ﬁrst-order phase transitions, or
is continuous, or second-order. It can be shown experimentally that second-order
phase transitions, at critical temperature Tc, have inﬁnite correlation length for
the underlying degrees of freedom. It is second-order phase transitions that are
explained by the renormalization group.
An important example of a phase transition is the case of a ferromagnet, made
out of crystalline cobalt or iron. A ferromagnet is a naturally occurring magnet that
has a nonzero spontaneous magnetization M(T) > 0 (usually at room temperature),
and is said to be in an ordered state. When its temperature is raised past a critical
temperature Tc, which is over 1000 K for cobalt and iron, the ferromagnet loses
its magnetization. The ferromagnet is said to have undergone a second-order phase
transition, at temperature Tc, from its magnetic to its nonmagnetic phase, also called
the disordered state. In the disordered state, M(T) = 0 for T ≥Tc. Figure 17.4(a)
shows the phases of the ferromagnet as a function of temperature.
According to Landau and Ginzburg, phase transitions can be described by an
order parameter that characterizes the phase of a bulk system. For a ﬁrst-order
phase transition, the order parameter changes discontinously at Tc as shown in
Figure 17.4(b), whereas for a second-order phase transition, the order parameter
changes continuously. All phase transitions entail symmetry breaking, with the
ordered phase breaking a symmetry of the disordered phase.
The order parameter can, for example, be the spontaneous magnetization of the
system M(T). An underlying classical statistical ﬁeld ϕ(x) is the degree of freedom
of a critical system and describes the macroscopic behavior of the system. The
ordered state and disordered state are described by the expectation value of the
ﬁeld ϕ, given by Eq. 2.4.3 as follows:

The spontaneous magnetization is given by
M(T) = (Tc −T)β; T ≤Tc
where β is a pure number and is called a critical exponent.
The correlation function of the ﬁeld ϕ(x) near criticality is given by
G(x) = E[ϕ(0)ϕ(x)] =

(17.6.2)
where the correlation length near criticality is given by
ξ(T) =

(17.6.3)
At exactly T = Tc, spontaneous magnetization is zero: M(Tc) = 0, and the correla-
tion function goes to zero for large separation of the underlying degrees of freedom.
But ξ(Tc) = ∞and the correlation function decays very slowly – with the critical
system being scale invariant. Hence, for some constant K
G(x) = E[ϕ(0)ϕ(x)] =
K
|x|d−2+η ; T = Tc
(17.6.4)
Critical exponents β, η, ν are experimentally measured. The same critical expo-
nents describe phase transitions for a large class of critical systems.

Phase transitions are described by a Hamiltonian; depending on the phe-
nomenon, the Hamiltonian is deﬁned in three-, two- or one- dimensional space.
The Hamiltonian H is classical and, up to a constant, is the energy density of the
statistical mechanical system.
In the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson approach to phase transitions, the long-distance
properties of a critical system are modeled by degrees of freedom deﬁned on a
continuous space and described by a phenomenological Hamiltonian H. The short-
distance structure of the system, for example the interactions at the lattice spacing of
a solid such as a ferromagnet, are unimportant for its critical properties. The long-
distance properties of the system have many universal properties – for example,
exact spherical symmetry that is absent for the lattice. It is the long-range order of
the system that is described by the phenomenological Hamiltonian H; in particular,
the critical system is realized by the phenomenological Hamiltonian H having an
inﬁnite correlation length ξ.
To use the concepts of the previous chapters, the terms Hamiltoninan and
Lagrangian will be used interchangeably. The reason is that the classical Hamilto-
nian is mathematically identical to a Lagrangian in Euclidean spacetime, with the
only difference being that the classical Hamiltonian is deﬁned in one dimension
lower than the Euclidean Lagrangian.
The order parameter of the phase transition is encoded in the ﬁeld ϕ; the long-
range ﬂuctuations (conﬁgurations) of the classical statistical mechanical system
are mathematically equivalent to considering ϕ to be a quantum ﬁeld. The Landau–
Ginzburg–Wilson Hamiltonian, similar to the discussion in Section 3.8, is given by

system goes from the disordered to ordered phase since
m2
B > 0: T > Tc

(17.7.2)
In other words, the mass parameter has the following interpretation.
• m2

• m2

The computation of the properties of the phase transition will be done starting from
the disordered phase, namely m2

letting T →Tc, which entails taking the limit of m2
B →0.

All the Feynman diagrams that contribute to E[(ϕ)] – for T < Tc – have to be
summed up to obtain spontaneous magnetization M(T) as a function of T −Tc.
The system undergoes a phase transition at T = Tc, with the potential developing
a double well for T < Tc, as shown in Figure 17.5(b). The system spontaneously
chooses ¯ϕ to be one of the minima as its ground state – either ν or −ν, as shown in
Figure 17.5(b) – and in doing so breaks the symmetry of ϕ →−ϕ.
17.8 Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point
We examine the system as it approaches Tc from the disordered phase, namely for
temperatures T > Tc, as shown in Figure 17.6. The bare Lagrangian describes the
short-distance behavior of the system; the long-distance behavior of the system is
given by renormalizing the system and examining its behavior for momentum scale
μ →0.
At the phase transition, namely for T = Tc, the system is scale invariant and, as
shown by Wilson, is described by the quantum ﬁeld ϕ(x) being at the infrared ﬁxed
point. The ﬂow of the coupling constant as one renormalizes the system to decreas-
ing values of μ is shown in Figure 17.7. Hence, to study the critical properties of the
system, we study the long-distance behavior of the system near the Wilson–Fisher
infrared ﬁxed point. In particular, critical indices, which describe the universal
characteristics of a second-order phase transition, are determined by the properties
of the infrared ﬁxed point.

The experimental value of η for a wide range of phase transitions is in the range of
[0,0.1]; the crude estimate obtained of η ≈0.01 is consistent with experiments. For
the O(N) symmetric ϕ4 theory discussed in Section 15.8, it can be shown that
η =

The bare theory is given by the value of μ0 >> μ; for statistical mechanical
systems, the large momentum scale μ0 can be taken to be equal to the inverse of
the lattice spacing of a solid, which is about 10−9 m. Holding μ0 ﬁxed and large,
μ is decreased to ﬁnd the description of the long-distance behavior of the system
in terms of the bare Lagrangian, since it is the bare Lagrangian that is driven to
criticality as T →Tc.
The physically relevant scale for a system going critical is its correlation length,
and hence we take

17.10 Fixed points and phase transitions
A fundamental understanding and explanation of phase transitions is provided by
the topological ideas encoded in the renormalization group, as propounded by
Wilson (1983) and Wilson and Kogut (1974). The earlier discussion of the
signiﬁcance of the renormalization group for obtaining a renormalized quantum
ﬁeld theory is modiﬁed to analyze the physics of phase transitions.
As mentioned in Section 17.2 the description of phase transitions lies in the
infra-red ﬁxed point action S∗= SIR; hence
∂SIR
∂t
= 0 ⇒U[SIR] = 0 ⇒St = S∗
The ﬁxed point action from Eq. 17.3.1 yields for all t
ξ∗= e−tξ∗
⇒ξ∗= 0, ∞
Recall from Section 17.4.1, for action given by St, the correlation function ˜ξt, is
deﬁned by
lim
|x|→∞E[ϕt(0)ϕt(x)] = 1
Zt

DϕteStϕt(0)ϕt(x) ≈e−|x|/ξt
The scale of distance for action St increases with an increase in t; by rescaling the
action deﬁne dimensionless correlation length ξt from the correlation length ˜ξt. The
correlation length scales are given by Eq. 17.2.4:
ξt = e−tξ0
(17.10.1)
Eq. 17.10.1 reﬂects the fact that all length scales in St have been increased by a
factor of et; hence in comparing the correlation length computed from St with that
computed from S0, one obtains Eq. 17.10.1.
For the case of phase transitions, the infrared ﬁxed point action S∗≡SIR with
ξ∗= ∞– which is shown in Figure 16.5(b) – plays a central role. As discussed
in Section 17.3, the renormalized actions ﬂow into the infrared ﬁxed point action
with the lowering of the cutoff, or equivalently, when one is computing correlation
functions for the ﬁelds at larger and larger distances of separation.

17.11 Phase transitions and Wilson space
475
A phase transition is scale invariant and is hence described by the ﬁxed point of
the renormalization group. Note the remarkable fact that the ﬁxed point action S∗is
entirely determined by the renormalization group transformation U and is indepen-
dent of the cutoff action S[] that one may start from. This is the explanation, in
the framework of the renormalization group, of the universality of phase transitions
discussed earlier in the context of the critical indices.
17.11 Phase transitions and Wilson space
Wilson space has the following salient features, schematically shown with two
coordinates u2, u4 in Figure 17.8.
• The infrared ﬁxed point action S∗≡SIR.
• The main difference between the UV and IR ﬁxed points is that the UV ﬁxed
point is a saddle point on the critical surface C. In contrast, all renormalization
group trajectories that describe the system at T = Tc terminate at the IR ﬁxed
point.
• A line is marked P in Figure 17.8 for the physical surface. The physical line P
is the location of the bare action. Points on the line P correspond to different
temperatures T > Tc for the physical system.
• There is a critical surface, marked C in Figure 17.8. The physical line intersects
the critical line C for the critical temperature T = Tc. It is important to note that
all actions on the critical surface (line) have inﬁnite correlation length. But they
are not at the ﬁxed point of the renormalization group.

Figure 17.8 The critical system’s trajectory is the one approaching the critical

critical values. The line G denotes departure from the infrared ﬁxed point SIR.

476
Renormalization group and phase transitions
• The line marked E in Figure 17.8 is a trajectory on the critical line (surface).
• Note that renormalizable quantum ﬁeld theories require two ﬁxed points, namely
the UV and IR ﬁxed points to describe phenomena from zero to inﬁnite distances.
In contrast, phase transitions require the existence of only a single IR ﬁxed point;
the short-distance properties of a system undergoing a phase transition do not
affect the critical properties of the system since all the critical properties are
determined by the IR ﬁxed point.
• The line marked by G leaves the critical line at S∗≡SIR. Actions on G have
a ﬁnite correlation length and under the renormalization group transformation
converge to a ﬁxed point with ξ = 0. The reason is that for systems with T > Tc,
at sufﬁciently large length scales they are all decoupled.
Each temperature T corresponds to a correlation length, and we label the various
bare actions with dimensionless correlation length ξ. Suppose one starts the renor-
malization procedure with a bare action that has ξ = 1. As shown in Figure 17.8,
the sequence of actions St is generated by solving
∂St(1)
∂t
= R[St(1)]; S0(1) = SB(ξ = 1)
where SB is the bare action with parameters chosen to give ξ = 1.
Renormalization generates the actions St(1), which trace out a trajectory that
ﬂows toward the infrared ﬁxed point S∗≡SIR and then veers off. Similarly, tra-
jectories for St(4), St(5), . . . are shown in Figure 17.8. As S(t), lying on physical
line P, approaches the critical surface C, which has ξ = ∞, the trajectories stay
closer and closer to the critical surface C, spending more and more “time” t near
the critical surface before veering off. The behavior of the renormalized trajectory,
starting from some ξ ̸= ∞, is given in Figure 17.9.
On the critical surface, the trajectory of St remains on C since the velocity
∂St/∂t ̸= 0. On reaching the ﬁxed point SIR the velocity is zero and the trajectory
can veer off orthogonal to the critical surface, as shown in Figure 17.8.
17.12 Linearized RG equation
In the neighborhood of the ﬁxed point action S∗, the renormalization group equa-
tions can be linearized. Furthermore, near the ﬁxed point, the deviation of the
renormalized action St is controlled by eigenoperators deﬁned by the properties
of the ﬁxed point:
St(T) = SIR + δSt; U[SIR] = 0
⇒
∂δSt

= U[SIR + δSt] ≈L[δSt]

trajectory starts in the transient region, starting from a point P on the physical
line. The renormalization trajectory then spends a long “time” at the time-sink
provided by the infrared ﬁxed point S∗. The renormalization trajectory leaves the
ﬁxed point, labeled by G, being driven by the relevant operator.
where L is a linear operator. Consider the solution
δSt = eat(T −Tc)δSd
(17.12.2)
For the solution to hold, Sd needs to be an eigenoperator of L such that
L[Sd] = aSd
(17.12.3)
The eigenoperator Sd with eigenvalue a > 1 is called a relevant operator and the
ﬁxed point is termed as being once unstable. Note that
Sd : Does not depend on either t or T
since L depends only on U, which is independent of t and T. For simplicity, we
assume that the rest of eigenvalues of L are negligible.
Once the action St has spent a long time in the critical region near the ﬁxed point
action (see Figure 17.9), the action St has lost all memory of its initial starting value.
Hence, when St enters the correlation domain shown in Figure 17.9, its behavior is
determined by the properties of the ﬁxed point. The initial condition is
S0(T) = SIR + (T −Tc)Sd; T →Tc
The renormalization group trajectory that leaves the ﬁxed point SIR – shown by
line G in Figure 17.8 and as the correlation length domain in Figure 17.9, is given
by Eq. 17.12.2 as follows [Wilson and Kogut (1974)]:
St(T) = SIR + δSt = SIR + (T −Tc)eatSd
(17.12.4)
Note the trajectory leaving the infrared ﬁxed SIR, labeled by G, is determined by the
eigenoperator Sd of the linearized renormalization group transformation L.

478
Renormalization group and phase transitions
The dependence of St(T) on t, T near the ﬁxed point and in the correlation region,
and shown in Figure 17.9, is completely determined by the factor
(T −Tc)eat
Since the only scale in the system is ξ, one expects that when the increase in the
scale is of order et ≃ξ, St(T) will signiﬁcantly deviate from SIR, that is
et ≃ξ
⇒|St(T)| >> |SIR|
The coefﬁcient of Sd in Eq. 17.12.4 should become of order 1 when St(T) is far
from the ﬁxed point and hence a is determined by
1 ≃(T −Tc)eat ≃(T −Tc)ξ a
⇒ξ =
1
(T −Tc)1/a
⇒a = 1
ν
The behavior of the action in the correlation region is given by
St(T) = SIR + et/ν(T −Tc)Sd
We have a fundamental result that the critical exponent ν controls how systems near
criticality depart from the ﬁxed point action SIR. Note that ν is determined by the
eigenvalue of the linearized renormalization group transformation L, which in turn
depends only on the transformation U and not on the initial action that we start
from.
Linearization near the ﬁxed point is given by Eq. 17.12.1; in general
St(T) = S∗+ δSt
⇒
∂δSt
∂t
= U[S∗+ δSt] ≈L[δSt]

δSt =

m=1
cme−dmtOm
where the Om must satisfy
L[Om] = −dmOm; m = 1, . . . , N
(17.12.6)
Instead of a single eigenoperator Sd given in Eq. 17.12.3, depending on the proper-
ties of the ﬁxed point action S∗, the operator L can have a number of eigenoperators.
The eigenoperators are deﬁned by spacetime integrations as follows:
Om =

The eigenvalues are determined by the anomalous dimensions of the operators Om.
The expansion above leads one to the classiﬁcation of operators that determine
how perturbations close to the ﬁxed point S∗behave under the renormalization
group scale transformations. Perturbations that take the system exponentially fast
away from the ﬁxed point are called relevant operators and those that lead back
exponentially fast to the ﬁxed point are called irrelevant operators. Hence, one has
Om :
⎧
⎨
⎩
dm < d

dm = d

(17.12.8)
For marginal operators, with dm = d, one has to perturb to higher orders to deter-
mine if they are relevant or irrelevant.
17.12.1 Free ﬁeld ﬁxed point
Consider the free ﬁeld ﬁxed point given by
S∗=

ddx(∂μϕ)2
Since there are no interactions, the dimensions of the ﬁelds are given by their
engineering dimension, which is given in Section 14.2 by dϕ = (2−d)/2; the mass
dimension of the ﬁeld is −dϕ. Consider the dimension of the following functional:
On =

Let d = 4; this yields the following:

Except for ϕ4, all the higher order polynomials that are generated for the cutoff
action on integrating out the high momentum degrees of freedom are lirrelevant;

Renormalization group and phase transitions
hence they do not contribute to the action for the slow degrees of freedom as the
cutoff is lowered to zero.
Every relevant operator requires to be ﬁxed for the RG trajectory to either leave
the UV ﬁxed point or to reach the IR ﬁxed point; the number of relevant operators
of a ﬁxed point is called the degree of instability of the ﬁxed point. Likewise,
the renormalization group trajectory is stable on adding irrelevant operators to the
action as the stable directions are represented by irrelevant operators that do not
cause the renormalization group trajectory to leave the ﬁxed point.
The linearized renormalization group transformation L, in general, can have
many relevant operators that have eigenvalues greater than one. Each relevant oper-
ator corresponds to an unstable direction leaving the infrared ﬁxed point – and
corresponds to a thermodynamic variable that needs to take its critical value for the
system to go critical.
Excluding the magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic phase transition ﬁxed point has one
unstable direction, which is controlled by temperature. A tricritical phase transition,
on the other hand, has two critical parameters, which are the critical temperature
and critical concentration of two ﬂuids. Hence, the tricritical point is twice unstable
and has two relevant operators.
17.13 Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point: Topology
The topology of Wilson space becomes much more complicated if there are many
ﬁxed points, and the initial action can ﬂow into many different ﬁxed points. To
have a ﬂavor of the global topological structure of renormalization ﬂows in Wilson
space, the ﬂow of trajectories in the neighborhood of the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point
for d = 3 are examined. The case of d = 4 is uninteresting since the Wilson–Fisher
ﬁxed point merges with the free ﬁeld ﬁxed point. In d = 2 the Wilson–Fisher
ﬁxed point has a different and also nontrivial structure. The detailed structure of
renormalization ﬂows in Wilson space in the neighborhood of the Wilson–Fisher
ﬁxed point for d = 3 is given in Hollowood (2013), and some of the major results
are summarized below.
The Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point is a theory with inﬁnite correlation length and lies
in a critical surface, labeled by E in Figure 17.10(a). Actions of the renormalization
trajectories on the critical surface have inﬁnite correlation length and are massless
theories; the renormalization group trajectory lies on the critical surface. One IR
trajectory ﬂows into the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point from the Gaussian ﬁxed point,
as shown in Figure 17.10(a). Another trajectory, with all points having inﬁnite
correlation length and lying inside the critical surface of massless theories, ﬂows
into the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point, as shown in Figure 17.10(a). For both these
inﬂowing trajectories, the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point is an IR ﬁxed point.

There are two other trajectories leaving the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point, one with
increasing m and another with decreasing m; for both these trajectories the Wilson–
Fisher ﬁxed point is an UV ﬁxed point.
The renormalization ﬂows in Figure 17.10(a) show that the d = 3 Wilson–Fisher
ﬁxed point lies on a ridge and is a saddle point, with two UV trajectories leaving
the Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point on two sides of the ridge.
Figure 17.10(a) is revisted for analyzing the structure and types of quantum
ﬁeld theories in Wilson space. Figure 17.10(b) shows the renormalization ﬂows
for theories near the d = 3 Wilson–Fisher ﬁxed point, with the following salient
features [Hollowood (2013)].
• The two ﬁxed points are the Gaussian free ﬁeld ﬁxed point (with m = 0 = λ) and
the Wilson–Fisher interacting ﬁxed point.
• There are only two relevant operators for these two ﬁxed points and hence the
Wilson space of all possible actions reduces to the two-dimensional plane m, λ,
with each point on the plane being a possible action.
• Line A is a free massive theory that has a free ﬁeld UV ﬁxed point G.
• Both domains B and D consist of renormalizable theories that are massive and
interacting, with free ﬁeld UV ﬁxed point G.
• Domain D has m < 0 and hence consists of theories with symmetry breaking and
E[ϕ] ̸= 0: nonzero vacuum expectation value for the ﬁeld.
• Lines C and F are interacting renormalizable theories that have the Wilson–Fisher
UV ﬁxed point.
• As discussed earlier for Figure 17.10(a), line E is a critical surface that consists of
two ﬁxed points, and with two massless renormalization IR trajectories ﬂowing
into the Wilson–Fisher IR ﬁxed point.

482
Renormalization group and phase transitions
• All theories to the right of the lines C and F do not have actions with a renormal-
izable continuum limit since there are no UV ﬁxed points from which they can
originate.
In the discussion of Figure 17.10(b), it is seen that the Gaussian and Wilson–
Fisher ﬁxed points can be both IR and UV, depending on the renormalization group
trajectory. This is a concrete realization of the earlier discussion of Figure 17.1,
where the signiﬁcance of a ﬁxed point is determined by whether the renormalization
trajectory approaches or recedes from it.
Noteworthy 17.1 Quantum ﬁelds, phase transitions and universality
The ﬁxed points of the renormalization group describe the renormalizability of
quantum ﬁelds as well as provide a description and explanation of second-order
phase transitions. This at ﬁrst sight appears rather unexpected and counterintuitive
since the renormalizability of quantum ﬁelds arises from its short-distance proper-
ties. And in contrast, second-order phase transitions are characterized by the long-
distance behavior of the thermodynamic system, with the correlation length at the
phase transition point becoming inﬁnite. These two results are a consequence of the
properties and interpretation of the ﬁxed points. IR and UV trajectories are the ones
that end up or originate from a ﬁxed point, respectively.
In case of quantum ﬁelds, the ﬁxed points describe the ultraviolet properties of
the system. The existence of the ultraviolet ﬁxed point is necessary for the theory
to have a well-deﬁned behavior as one indeﬁnitely increases the momentum scale
at which the quantum ﬁeld is being probed.
In contrast, for thermodynamic systems undergoing phase transitions, their short-
distance properties are unimportant; what is important are the long-distance prop-
erties of the system, which are described by infra-red stable ﬁxed points. As one
probes the system at large and larger distances, the renormalized theory approaches
the infrared ﬁxed point and exhibits the expected scale invariance.
As discussed in Section 17.3 and shown in Figure 16.5, the property of being
infra-red stable or ultraviolet stable is not an intrinsic property of the ﬁxed point
[Huang (2010)]. If the renormalization group trajectory ﬂows into a ﬁxed point, it
appears to be infrared stable, and if the trajectory ﬂows away from the ﬁxed point,
it appears to be ultraviolet stable.
Critical systems exhibit universality. What this means is that the critical behavior,
in particular the critical exponents, depend on a few very general properties of
the critical system, such as its dimensionality and symmetry, and do not depend
on the detailed form of the underlying Lagrangian that describes the microscopic
properties of the system. For example, liquid–gas phase transitions have critical
exponents that are independent of the chemical composition of the ﬂuid. More

17.14 Summary
483
remarkably, the ferromagnetic and liquid-gas phase transitions also have the same
critical exponents.
The remarkable result of universality is explained by the renormalization group
using the fact that many different systems can ﬂow into the same IR ﬁxed point
when they are critical. The reason that phase transitions exhibit universality is
because many different actions can intersect the critical surface and hence the
critical behavior of all these diverse systems will be determined by the ﬁxed point
action and the renormalization group transformation R. The basin of attraction of a
ﬁxed point action is determined by all the actions that ﬂow to the ﬁxed point under
renormalization.
There is a key feature that differentiates the universal properties of a system
from its particular and speciﬁc properties. A particular system has its own speciﬁc
characteristics for all length scales; when it goes critical, only its inﬁnitely long-
distance behavior is relevant, and it shares this long-distance behavior with a large
class of systems.
17.14 Summary
Phase transitions are long-distance phenomena, whereas renormalizability studies
the behavior of the system at very short distances. What unites the study of
renormalizability with that of phase transitions is that both are systems with
inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom, and described by ﬁxed points of
the renormalization group.
For quantum ﬁeld theories that explain high energy phenomena, such as the
Standard Model of particle physics, all length scales, from the very small to the very
large, need to be explained and must yield a ﬁnite theory that can be empirically
tested. Hence, the ultraviolet ﬁxed point, controlling the short-distance physics,
must exist and the renormalized theory needs to have a well-deﬁned limit for long-
distance physics; if an IR ﬁxed point exists, then that deﬁnes the long-distance
theory, but the existence of the IR ﬁxed point for renormalizability is not necessary.
The renormalized quantum ﬁeld theory lies on the UV trajectory that crosses all
length scales, from zero to inﬁnity, and the renormalized parameter can be ﬁxed by
experiment to have a speciﬁc value at momentum scale μ.
Phase transitions are insensitive to the short-distance interactions of the system
and reﬂect only the long-distance properties of the critical system. Hence, phase
transitions need the existence of only the infrared ﬁxed point with no need for an
ultraviolet ﬁxed point. The IR ﬁxed point can be used for deﬁning a renormalized
theory since the cutoff can be removed using the fact that the IR ﬁxed point has

484
Renormalization group and phase transitions
inﬁnite correlation length. The values of the renormalized couplings for an IR ﬁxed
point are restricted to having the values of the ﬁxed point.
A subtle but major shift in the understanding of quantum ﬁeld theory is brought
about by its application to phase transitions. The “quantum” aspect of quantum
ﬁelds lies in the fact that the quantum ﬁeld is indeterminate, taking all possible
values in spacetime. The application of quantum ﬁelds to phase transitions shows
that the indeterminacy of a quantum ﬁeld is equally suitable for describing classical
random behavior, provided the classical system is complex enough to have many
length scales and requires inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom for its description.
What changes in going from the quantum to classical applications of quantum ﬁeld
theory is the interpretation of the mathematical structures of quantum ﬁelds.
Applications of quantum ﬁeld theory to turbulence, ﬁnance, pure mathematics
and so on shows that quantum ﬁeld theory is a discipline that spans many domains
of knowledge that go beyond quantum physics. The utility and facility offered
by quantum ﬁeld theory in the study of diverse disciplines – from the natural to
social sciences – points to the fact that quantum ﬁeld theory should rightly be
considered to be a subject of quantum mathematics. Quantum mathematics is based
on state space, operators, Lagrangians, Hamiltonians and Feynman path integrals –
and encompasses systems with both ﬁnite and inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of
freedom. The term “quantum” is retained in referring to quantum mathematics,
and in particular, the term “quantum ﬁeld” is retained in applications outside quan-
tum physics so that there is continuity in the terminology being used – which in
turn facilitates the transfer of results and structures from quantum physics to other
disciplines, and vice-versa.
The discovery of calculus was made by Newton in the study of classical physics,
and calculus subsequently went on to become a universal instrument of knowledge.
Quantum mathematics, similar to calculus, has the potential of growing beyond its
roots in quantum physics and becoming, in due course of time, the higher form of
calculus – and with universal application in myriad ﬁelds of inquiry.

Effective action
18.1 Introduction
Classical action is the foundation of classical mechanics; in particular, the minimum
of the classical action determines the classical ﬁeld equation. Classical action also
determines the equilibrium conﬁguration for the classical ﬁeld, which is ﬁxed by
the minimum value of the classical potential. For constant solutions of the ﬁeld
equations, the classical action is equal, up to a volume factor, to the potential energy
of the ﬁeld.
Hence, in classical physics, the symmetry breaking for a system is determined
by the potential of the classical ﬁeld. In Sections 3.8 and 3.9, symmetry breaking
for classical ﬁelds was studied for nonlinear ﬁelds. In Section 3.10, the Higgs
mechanism, which is the reﬂection of the interplay of symmetry breaking with
gauge symmetry, was discussed.
The discussions in Chapter 2 on symmetry breaking were classical and one
needs to answer the question: How does one study the breaking of symmetries for
a quantum ﬁeld? Is there a generalization of the classical action that incorporates
all the quantum effects and yields a criterion, similar to the minimization of the
potential energy for the classical ﬁeld, for symmetry breaking for quantum ﬁelds?
The answer is given by the effective action , which in turn yields the effective
potential. All calculations of this chapter are based on Euclidean quantum ﬁelds.
The effective action  is the generating functional of all the one-particle irre-
ducible vertices (deﬁned below) similar to W[J] being the generating functional of
all the connected correlation functions. To evaluate  one needs to renormalize the
theory and express  in terms of the renormalized mass and coupling constant.
The effective potential provides the criterion for symmetry breaking for a quan-
tum ﬁeld. For example, consider a theory with its Lagrangian being symmetric
under the transformation ϕ →−ϕ. Suppose the minimum of the effective potential
is given by ¯ϕ; it will be shown to be the vacuum expectation of the quantum ﬁeld
ϕ, namely

Effective action
¯ϕ = ⟨|ϕ|⟩= E[ϕ]
If ¯ϕ ̸= 0, then the symmetry of ϕ →−ϕ is said to be spontaneously broken.
18.2 Effective action : Deﬁnition
The generator functional W[J] of all the connected correlation functions of a quan-
tum ﬁeld is given in Eq. 14.6.1 as follows:
Z[J] = eW[J] =

DϕeS+

Jϕ
where J = J(x) is a classical external current.
Deﬁne ϕc = ϕc(x) to be the expectation value of the quantum ﬁeld in the
presence of the external source J(x)
ϕc(x) ≡δW[J]
δJ(x) = 1
Z

DϕeS+

jϕϕ(x)
(18.2.1)
In the effective action [ϕc], the role of J(x) in W[J] is replaced by the vacuum
expectation value ϕc(x). Deﬁne the effective action by the following:
[ϕc] = W[J] −

ddxJ(x)ϕc(x)
(18.2.2)
Note by its very deﬁnition, the effective action [ϕc] is independent of J(x), since
Eq. 18.2.1 follows from Eq. 18.2.2 only if δ/δJ = 0. What this means is that we
need to consider J to be a function of ϕc in the expression for  and hence J is not
an independent source term.
For W[J] the external source J(x) is an independent classical source and ϕc(x) is
a function of J(x). In contrast, in [ϕc], the independent classical source is ϕc(x).
In fact Eq. 18.2.2 is a Legendre transformation, taking a functional W[J] of J to
[ϕc], which is a functional of ϕc.
As expected of a Legendre transformation from Eq. 18.2.2, we have
δ
δϕc(x) =

ddyδW[J]
δJ(y)
δJ[y]
δϕc(x) −

ddy δJ[y]
δϕc(x)ϕc(y) −J(x)
or, from Eq. 18.2.1
δ
δϕc(x) = −J(x)
(18.2.3)
Eqs. 18.2.1 and 18.2.3 are dual to each other,
To obtain [ϕc] one ﬁrst solves Eq. 18.2.1 to obtain J = J(ϕc, x), considered as
a functional of ϕc. One then replaces J by J(ϕc, x) in Eq. 18.2.2 to obtain [ϕc].

Inverting the above equation yields
J(x) =

and for the free ﬁeld, the effective action [ϕc] is given by

Hence, for the free ﬁeld, [ϕc] is equal to the action S[ϕc].
It is shown that the result for the free ﬁeld is valid to leading order in ¯h for a
nonlinear classical action as well. Restoring ¯h, the deﬁnition of W[J] is given by

functional integral and yields


Jϕcl(x) + O(¯h)
and this yields
ϕc(x) = δW[J]
δJ(x) = ϕcl(x) + O(¯h)
In other words, to leading order in ¯h, the vacuum expectation value of the quantum
ﬁeld given by ϕc is equal to the classical ﬁeld ϕcl. Eq. 18.2.2 yields
[ϕc] = [ϕcl] + O(¯h) =

Hence, in the classical limit of ¯h →0, the effective action [ϕc] is equal to the
classical action.

In the calculation of the correlators, it was seen that the propagators for the external
lines were removed for studying, for example, the theory’s renormalization, as in
Figure 14.10 and discussed in Section 14.8.
The Feynman diagram shown in Figure 18.1(a), called one-particle reducible,
can be completely split up into three distinct disconnected subdiagrams by cutting
two single lines (which, recall, stands for the propagator). There is no independent
loop integration along the lines being cut.
The cutting of the single lines, and indicated by an arrow in Figure 18.1, leads
to subdiagrams, shown in Figure 18.1(b), that all cannot be split further into two

Effective action
subdiagrams by cutting a line and are called one-particle irreducible diagrams, and
denoted by 1PI. For 1PI diagrams, all internal lines occur only within a loop.
It is intuitively expected that the 1PI subdiagrams contain all the essential diver-
gences, and that each of the 1PI diagrams can be renormalized separately. The one-
particle reducible diagrams can then be renormalized using the 1PI renormalized
diagrams.
To formalize the framework such that the 1PI Feynman diagrams can be isolated,
the effective action [ϕc] is analyzed. In general [ϕc] has the following Taylor
expansion:
[ϕc] =

The functions n(x1 · · · xn) are the connected vertex functions; these are the 1PI
Feynman diagrams with the external legs removed, or amputated. In the discussion
below, explicit expressions for n are derived in terms of the connected Green’s
functions Gn. It is shown that the amputated Green’s functions yield n; however,
it will not proven that the n obtained are given by the 1PI Feynman diagrams, as
the proof is not required in any of the discussions.

symmetric functions of the spacetime coordinates x1 · · · xn.

For Feynman perturbation expansion, the action can consist of many ﬁelds and,
in general, has a quadratic part and an interaction vertex given by the following

Note that Z contains only the amputated Green’s functions. The nth-order term in
the perturbation expansion has the following features:
• Each propagator contributes a factor of ¯h; each internal line I corresponds to a
propagator and hence yields a factor of ¯hI.
• Each vertex contributes a factor of 1/¯h, and for n vertices yields a factor of ¯h−n.
• Hence, the nth-order diagram has a prefactor of ¯hI−n.
From Eq. 15.15.2, we have I −n = L −1, where L is the number of loops. The
prefactor is given by
¯hI−n = ¯hL−1
Hence, an expansion in the number of loops is an expansion of the effective action
about the quadratic action, in a power series in ¯h. An expansion about the classical
solution also yields a loop expansion about the classical solution.
For a single coupling constant, the loop is equivalent to an expansion in powers
of the coupling constant. Consider the ϕ4 theory with the action given by
S = −

d4x

2(∂ϕ)2 + 1

Rescale the ﬁeld ϕ to ϕ/

λ; then the action is

2(∂ϕ)2 + 1

Hence λ plays the role of ¯h since the effective expansion parameter for the loop
expansion becomes λ¯h. This is the reason that for ϕ4 theory, the concept of the loop
expansion and a perturbation expansion in the coupling constant have been used
interchangeably.
For a Lagrangian consisting of many quantum ﬁelds, the loop expansion takes
into account the contribution of all the coupling constants and organizes the

perturbation about the classical solution, which is different from a perturbation
expansion in the coupling constants.
18.6.1 Dimensional analysis

transform of the connected correlation function yields
Gn(p1 · · · pn) =

dx1 · · · dxne−i 8n
i=1 pixiGn(x1 · · · xn)
Using translation invariance of the theory implies that
G2(x, y) = G2(x −y)

In general, as seen from Eq. 18.5.5, n has an expansion in terms of Gn and lower
order vertex functions. For dimensional analysis, one needs to identify only the
dimensional aspect of the deﬁnition of n, and for this it is sufﬁcient to keep the
leading term. Hence, indicating dimensions by [..]

(18.6.1)
From Eq. 16.2.9, the dimension of the momentum Green’s function is
[Gn(p1 · · · pn)] = μ−n(d/2+1)
For the propagator n = 2 and hence
[G2(p1, p2)] = μ−(d+2)
Deﬁning G2(p) by
G2(p, p′) = δd(p + p′)G2(p)
yields, as in Eq. 16.2.10, the engineering dimension
[G2(p)] = μd[G2(p, p′)] = μ−2
The engineering dimension of n(p1 · · · pn) is given, from Eqs. 16.2.9 and 18.6.1,
by the following:
[Gn(p1 · · · pn)] = [G2(p)]nμ−d[n(p1 · · · pn)]

or
[n(p1 · · · pn)] = μ−n(d/2+1)μ2nμd = μd−n(d/2−1)
Hence for d = 4, the engineering dimension is given by
[n(p1 · · · pn)] = μ4−n
The vertex function n can develop an anomalous dimension, similar to the case
discussed in Section 16.9, due to the effects of renormalization.
18.7 Effective potential Veff
The effective action has a physical interpretation in terms of the energy of the
system. Consider the special case of a constant current J and a ﬁeld ϕc that depends
only on space. In terms of the Hamiltonian H, the deﬁnition of the generating
functional is given by
eW[J] = lim
τ→∞tr

Let |J⟩be the vacuum state given by

Since τ →∞, only the energy of the vacuum state is required; hence

d3xϕc
≃lim
τ→∞⟨J|e−τH+τJ

d3xϕc|J⟩= eW[J]
The result above shows that for constant J, the effective action W[J] is equal to the
negative of the energy of the vacuum |J⟩, divided by τ.
The J-dependent vacuum energy per unit volume E and ϕc are given by
E = ⟨J|H|J⟩= E(J); ϕc = ⟨J|ϕ(x)|J⟩= ϕc(J) : constant
Since J and ϕc are spacetime constants, the integral over spacetime factorizes and
the spacetime volume of the system is an overall multiplicative constant. Hence
W[J] = V(−E + Jϕc); V = τ

d3x
which yields the effective action
 = W[J] −J

Conversely, the limit yields

ϕc= ¯ϕ

In summary, the minimization of the effective action  yields the quantum ground
state, with the correct value for ¯ϕ, which has all the quantum contributions taken
into account. The effective action yields the appropriate criterion to be used for
deﬁning the quantum corrected ground state.
The effective action  has an expansion in terms of the powers of the derivatives
of the ﬁeld ϕc
[ϕc] =

ddx[−Veff(ϕc) + f(ϕc)(∂μϕc)2 + g(ϕc)(∂μ∂νϕc)2 + · · · ]
(18.7.3)
The effective potential Veff(ϕc) is the value of [ϕc] for ϕc = B, where B is a
constant. From the gradient expansion for  given in Eq. 18.7.3, from Eq. 18.7.1,
for ϕc = B, one has
Veff(B) = −[B]/V = E
Hence the effective potential has the correct sign in Eq. 18.7.3, being equal to
energy for quantum ﬁeld conﬁgurations that are constant. As a function of ϕc, the
minimum value of Veff is the minimum value of E – which as discussed above
yields the true quantum corrected ground state. The deﬁnition and sign of Veff in
Eq. 18.7.3 have been chosen to make the effective potential a quantum-corrected
generalization of the concept of the potential in classical mechanics.
From the discussion above, the value of B for which Veff(B) is a minimum is
equal to the vacuum expectation value of the quantum ﬁeld ϕ in the true quantum-
corrected vacuum state, given by ˜ϕ. And hence determines whether the ﬁeld spon-
taneously breaks a symmetry of the Lagrangian.
The ultraviolet divergences of the quantum ﬁeld appear in the effective action
and hence in the effective potential as well. In general, for ﬁeld renormalization
one needs to set the coefﬁcient of the kinetic term in the action, namely (∂μϕc)2,
to unity. Since only a constant value for B is being considered there is no kinetic
term in Veff(B), and one has to refer to the effective action for ﬁeld renormalization.

18.8 Spontaneous symmetry breaking
497
The derivation of the effective potential is being done to one loop of ϕ4 theory, and
to one loop there is no ﬁeld renormalization. Hence, we will not address this any
further.
There are a variety of conditions that one can impose to deﬁne the renormalized
mass and coupling constant, depending of the nature of the calculation. In general,
one needs to impose two conditions to renormalize the effective potential, which
are taken to follow the scheme given in Eq. 15.2.2; the minimum of the effective
potential deﬁnes the vacuum expectation value of the ﬁeld ¯ϕ; the quadratic term of
the effective potential deﬁnes the renormalized mass; and the quartic term deﬁnes
the renormalized coupling constant. Hence

18.8 Spontaneous symmetry breaking
Symmetry breaking is quite common in classical physics. For any potential with
multiple minima, the ﬁeld can take its stationary value at any of the minima of the
potential and consequently satisfy the equations of motion. In case of the double-
well potential given by V = g2
8 (|ϕ(x)|2 −a)2), the particle can be classically at rest
at either of the two points given by ϕ = ±√a, which breaks the ϕ →−ϕ parity
symmetry of the potential.
Phase transitions result from symmetry breaking, as discussed in Section 17.6.
The remaining sections of this chapter study whether quantum ﬂuctuations can
cause the system to undergo a phase transition. To foreground the discussion, the
answer in short is that for the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson ϕ4 theory it does not,
whereas for the Higgs Lagrangian it does.
A symmetry in quantum mechanics means the following. Suppose H commutes
with some operator R, that is, [H, R] = 0. R is the operator realization of the
symmetry of the action functional obtained by Noether’s theorem.
In classical physics, the Lagrangian fully describes the system, and the symme-
tries of the Lagrangian are also carried by the Hamiltonian. In quantum mechanics
the state space is a separate ingredient of the system, and the vacuum state of the
system can break the symmetries of the Lagrangian. Spontaneous symmetry break-
ing for a quantum ﬁeld is a case of the quantum vacuum breaking the symmetry
that is encoded in the Lagrangian.
Consider a Lagrangian that is invariant under the transformation of ϕ →−ϕ.
Let R be the operator deﬁned by

498
Effective action
R† ˆϕ(x)R = −ˆϕ(x)
One has
¯ϕ = ⟨| ˆϕ(x)|⟩= −⟨|R† ˆϕ(x)R|⟩
(18.8.1)
Due to translation invariance ¯ϕ is a constant independent of spacetime coordinate
x. The theory is said to have an unbroken symmetry, or a symmetric state space, if
the ground state |⟩is invariant under R, namely that it satisﬁes
R|⟩= |⟩: symmetric theory
The theory has spontaneously broken symmetry if
R|⟩̸= |⟩: spontaneously broken symmetry
It follows from Eq. 18.8.1 that
Symmetric:
R|⟩= |⟩⇒
¯ϕ = ⟨| ˆϕ(x)|⟩= 0
Nonsymmetric: R|⟩̸= |⟩⇒
¯ϕ = ⟨| ˆϕ(x)|⟩̸= 0
The nonsymmetric vacuum leads to the spontaneous breaking of symmetry. As
discussed brieﬂy in Section 17.6, symmetry breaking for a quantum ﬁeld is the
result of a phase transition from a disordered phase to an ordered.
The deﬁnition of the effective action provides a criterion for symmetry breaking
as it carries the complete information about the quantum system, including its exact
vacuum state. The effective action is given by the following:
δ
δϕc(x) = −J(x)
For a Lagrangian that is translation invariant, one has
¯ϕ = 1
Z

DϕeSϕ(x): constant

deﬁned by
ϕc(x, J) = 1

δJ

J=0

J→0 ϕc(x, J)
Recall that for the effective action, J is a function of ϕc, namely J(x) = J(x, ϕc) and
for ϕc →¯ϕ, Eq. 18.7.2 yields
lim
ϕc→¯ϕ J(x, ϕc) = 0

(18.8.2)
For a constant classical ﬁeld B, the effective action is up to a constant volume factor
equal to the effective potential
/V = −Veff(B)
and, from Eq. 18.8.2, this yields
∂Veff(B)
∂B

B= ¯ϕ
= 0
In other words the quantum-corrected value of ¯ϕ is given by the extremization of
Veff(B). Hence, for a system with R symmetry
¯ϕ = 0
symmetric: disordered phase
¯ϕ ̸= 0
nonsymmetric: ordered phase
Two Lagrangians are studied to understand symmetry breaking based on the
formalism of the effective potential.

LB[ϕ] = −1
2∂μϕB∂μϕB −1

The dependence of m2
B on temperature is given by Eq. 17.7.1.
• For m2
B < 0; T < Tc, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition.
This is the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson Lagrangian discussed in Section 17.7.
• For m2
B > 0; T > Tc the system is in the disordered phase and there is no
phase transition.
• It is shown in Section 18.10.2 that for the borderline case of m2
B = 0, the
system is disordered since ¯ϕ = 0 and there is no phase transition.
• Hence, the phase transition at T = Tc is a second-order phase transition.

(18.8.3)
where μ0 carries the dimension of momentum. The Lagrangian for the case of
μ2 = 0 is given in Eq. 18.12.1.
• For μ2 < 0, the system, as discussed in Section 3.10, undergoes a second-
order Higgs phase transition and spontaneously breaks gauge invariance.
• For μ2 > 0 the system is in the disordered phase and there is no phase
transition.
• It is shown in Section 18.14 that for the borderline case of μ2 = 0, we have
that ¯ϕ ̸= 0: The system is ordered and gauge symmetry is spontaneously
broken. Hence, for μ2 = 0 ⇒T = Tc, the system undergoes a ﬁrst-order
phase transition and is in the ordered phase; see Section 17.6 [Shen (1993)].
This ﬁrst-order phase transition is entirely due to quantum corrections to the
classical vacuum.
• Hence, the border line case of Higgs phase transition at T = Tc is a ﬁrst-order
phase transition.
In summary, the phase diagrams for the two cases are shown in Figure 18.4; the
Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson transition is shown in ﬁgure and is a second-order phase
transition, whereas the Higgs (H) transition shown in ﬁgure is a ﬁrst-order phase
transition. In both cases, the expectation value is a function of temperature, that is,
¯ϕ = ¯ϕ(T). The two cases can be summarized as follows: At the critical tempera-
ture both theories become massless. The derivation given in the following sections
shows that
¯ϕLGW(Tc) = 0;
¯ϕH(Tc) ̸= 0

18.9 ϕ4: One-loop effective action
The semi-classical expansion directly computes the effective action by doing a loop
expansion about the classical ﬁeld ϕcl that satisﬁes the Euler–Lagrange equation.
The background ﬁeld method is another procedure for computing the effective
action and is similar to the background ﬁeld method used for renormalizing the
theory, as discussed in Section 15.12.
The one-loop effective action is computed for the ϕ4 theory and the result is used
to ascertain if there is spontaneous breaking of symmetry for the quantum ﬁeld due
to the quantum corrections to the classical theory. The background ﬁeld method
is used as it provides an efﬁcient procedure for computing the one-loop effective
potential.

Lagrangian and counterterm as

The counterterms are O(λ) and hence all higher terms involving δλ, δm are of
O(λ2). The only change in Veff is that for V0 and V1, one simply replaces mB, λB by

All the divergent terms in Veff due to mB, λB cancel, leaving a ﬁnite expression for
Veff in terms of mR, λR. The arbitrary mass scale M does not appear; this because it
is set to zero by the condition deﬁning the renormalized parameters being imposed
for B = 0.
The effective potential does not have a ﬁnite limit as mR →0 due to the log-
arithmic term. This apparent divergence appears due to the deﬁnition of mB, λR at
B = 0. For the massless case, the renormalized mass and coupling constant are
deﬁned using a non-zero value for the scale M.
18.10 Massless ϕ4: Effective potential
To renormalize the massless ϕ4 theory, one needs to start with the massive the-
ory and deﬁne the renormalized coupling constant at a scale M by the following
conditions.
• The renormalized mass is zero, that is m2
R = 0.
• Mass renormalization is zero, that is δm2 = 0.
• The renormalized coupling constant is deﬁned at a nonzero scale M

It can be shown that the computation of ¯ϕ using perturbation theory to one

important.
An intuitive reason that Veff does not yield a consistent result is because the
O(λM) and O(λ2
M) terms in Eq. 18.10.3, being of different orders, cannot compen-
sate for the change of scale coming from ln( ¯ϕ2/M2) as one varies M holding ¯ϕ
ﬁxed.
RG improved perturbation
The renormalization group improved perturbation yields the correct renormaliza-
tion group invariant result. The choice of a scale M distinct from the expectation
value of quantum ﬁeld B is at the root of the inconsistent result. In the language of
Wilson renormalization, one is using the coupling constant λM, deﬁned at scale M,
to describe the behavior of the ﬁeld at some other distinct scale B. The only scale in
the theory is the value of B. Therefore, to study symmetry breaking – which could
occur for a speciﬁc value of B – the correct coupling constant to use is λ(B).
Hence choosing M = B yields, from Eq. 18.10.1, the effective potential for the
massless ϕ4 theory given by

There is no symmetry breaking for ϕ4 theory; the result is renormalization group
invariant and the renormalization group improved calculation yields the correct
result. Hence, from Eq. 18.10.6 and as given earlier in Eq. 18.8.4,
¯ϕ = ¯ϕLGW(Tc) = 0
As discussed in Section 18.8, the result shows that the ϕ4 Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson
phase transition is second order.
18.11 Massless scalar quantum electrodynamics
One way of making a non-zero ¯ϕ renormalization group invariant for a massless
theory is to introduce two independent coupling constants, by coupling the complex
ﬁeld scalar ﬁeld to the U(1) gauge ﬁeld. This theory leads to a consistent sponta-
neous symmetry breaking – due to the fact that the quantum vacuum state breaks
the symmetry of the Lagrangian – since the two coupling constants are sufﬁcient to
compensate for the variation of M in ¯ϕ.
The remaining sections of this chapter are devoted to the study of spontaneous
symmetry breaking in massless scalar quantum electrodynamics (QED). The
Lagrangian of the model, introduced for classical ﬁelds in Section 3.9, describes a
massive complex scalar ﬁeld interacting with itself and at the same time coupled to
a electromagnetic vector ﬁeld.
It is shown that, unlike the case of ϕ4, symmetry breaking of massless QED can
be consistently described by the effective action calculated to one loop level, and
the one loop is sufﬁcient to justify the validity of spontaneous symmetry breaking
to all higher loops. The photon ﬁeld is gauge invariant, and a gauge has to be chosen
to study symmetry breaking.
Based on the method developed in the earlier sections of this chapter, the one-
loop effective potential is computed in Section 18.13. In Section 18.14, symmetry
breaking due to the one-loop corrections is computed and veriﬁed. The ﬁnal section
is spent on proving the renormalization group invariance of the theory.

that is
Ac
μ = constant
Consider a gauge transformation

The fact that the effective potential does not depend on the background gauge
ﬁeld allows us to dispense with choosing a background gauge and we can choose

The method of integrating a ﬁrst-order differential equation for obtaining

which consists of an inﬁnite summation of all one-loop Feynman diagrams.

which is essentially a nonperturbative result due to the exp{−1/λ} singularity for

dominates over all the higher order loop corrections. An arbitrary scale M has been
produced by the process of renormalization.
The calculation shows that the spontaneous breaking of symmetry of the theory
in fact takes place and is consistently described by the one-loop result. Hence, from
Eq. 18.14.8 and as given earlier in Eq. 18.8.4
¯ϕ = ¯ϕH(Tc) ̸= 0
(18.14.9)
As discussed in Section 18.8, the result shows that the Higgs phase transition is
ﬁrst order. The ﬁrst-order transition also solves another possible contradiction in
the result obtained in Eq. 18.14.8. For second-order phase transitions, the critical
point is deﬁned by the ﬁxed point of the renormalization group transformation that
in turn implies β-function at the critical point is zero, and given by βsecond(Tc) = 0.
In Eq. 18.14.8, if one sets β →0, then ¯ϕ →0; this contradiction is avoided by the
fact that for a ﬁrst-order phase transition βﬁrst(Tc) ̸= 0, and hence the result given
in Eq. 18.14.9 is correct.

(18.15.1)
which shows that the effective potential Veff is renormalization group invariant.
It can be shown for scalar QED that4
β(e) = M de
dM = O(e3)
and hence under a change of M, the change in e given by β(e) contributes
dVeff/d ln M only to O(e6) and can be ignored.

Inserting the value of β from Eq. 18.14.3 leads to
d ln ¯ϕ
d ln M = d ¯ϕ
dM = 0
(18.15.2)
Eq. 18.15.2 is the key result, as it shows that the quantum ﬁeld’s spontaneously
acquired vacuum expectation value ¯ϕ is renormalization group invariant, and hence
a physical quantity.
Thus unlike the case of massless ϕ4, renormalization group invariance of ¯ϕ is
preserved in massless scalar QED. This is connected with the fact that contributions
to the effective potential diminish as one goes to higher orders in the present model,
and hence renormalization group invariance has to be valid for each term in the
perturbative expansion.
18.16 Summary
The effective action [ϕc] is a function ϕc, which is a deterministic function of
spacetime. The exact value of the effective action [ϕc], correct to all orders in ¯h,
contains all the quantum corrections to S[ϕcl], and is the reason [ϕc] is called the
effective action.
4 For photons coupled to electrons by charge e, the β-function is given by β = e3/(12π2).

522
Effective action
The classical ﬁeld equation is determined by δS[ϕcl]/δϕ = 0. This equation
is generalized to the quantum case with the equation δ[ϕc]/δϕc = −J, where
ϕc = ⟨(J)|ϕ|(J)⟩. For the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the function
limJ→0 ϕc(J) = ¯ϕ ̸= 0 (hence J[ ¯ϕ] →0), and yields δ[ ¯ϕ]/δϕc = 0. This is the
exact quantum generalization of the classical extermal condition on the classical
action S, with ¯ϕ being the vacuum expectation value, to all orders in ¯h, of the
quantum ﬁeld ϕ.
The effective action [ϕc] is the generating functional for all the 1PI connected
vertex functions and provides an exact and complete solution of a quantum ﬁeld
theory. A recursive method was discussed that generates all the higher order con-
nected vertex functions from the fundamental equation for the propagator. The
effective potential Veff, up to a spacetime volume factor V, is equal to −[ϕc],
where ϕc is a constant. For the case of a constant ϕc = B, the effective action yields
[ϕc] = −VVeff(B).
The effective potential Veff is the generalization of the classical concept of the
potential energy. The effective potential for the ϕ4 theory as well as scalar QED
was evaluated to one loop, for both the massive and massless theories. It was shown
that, to one loop, the effective potentials are renormalization group invariant.
The effective potential Veff contains all the information of the exact quantum
vacuum |⟩. For the case when there is spontaneous breaking of symmetry, the
quantum vacuum has a nonzero expectation value for the quantum ﬁeld, given by
E[ϕ(x)] = ⟨| ˆϕ(x)|⟩= ¯ϕ, where ˆϕ(x) is the Heisenberg ﬁeld operator. The
minimum of Veff = Veff( ¯ϕ) yields the value of ¯ϕ, given by
∂Veff(ϕc)
∂ϕc

ϕc= ¯ϕ
= 0 ⇒ϕc = ¯ϕ
A nonzero value for ¯ϕ ̸= 0 is a signal of symmetry breaking for the quantum
ﬁeld. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum ﬁeld theory is the result of the
quantum ﬂuctuations and makes no reference to temperature; rather, spontaneous
symmetry breaking is a result of the exact vacuum state of the Hamiltonian not hav-
ing the symmetry of the action. However, symmetry breaking can also be analyzed
in the context of phase transitions by taking the action to be equal to the classical
Hamiltonian of a statistical mechanical system – and with the mass parameter being
interpreted in the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson framework.
The value for Veff for massless ϕ4 theory apparently shows symmetry breaking,
but a closer examination based on the invariance under the renormalization
group shows that the symmetry breaking is an artifact of the incorrect use of
the effective coupling constant. The renormalization group improved calculation
shows that there is no symmetry breaking. A study of scalar QED shows that

18.16 Summary
523
there is spontaneous symmetry breaking with ¯ϕ ̸= 0; the result is shown to be
renormalization group invariant.
According to the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson theory of phase transitions, the mass
parameter of the classical Hamiltonian (also, loosely speaking, is sometimes also
called the Lagrangian) becomes zero at the onset of the phase transition, for which
T = Tc. The effective potential computes the value for the massless case, with the
result that ¯ϕLGW = 0 for the Landau–Ginzburg–Wilson ϕ4 theory, showing that
the transition is second order. In contrast, for the Higgs Lagrangian, the effective
potential yields ¯ϕH ̸= 0, for T = TC showing that the phase transition is ﬁrst order.

Nonlinear interest rates’ quantum ﬁeld*
19.1 Introduction
Chapters 10, 11 and 12 have focused on the linear (Gaussian) two-dimensional
quantum ﬁeld f(t, x) that describes the bond market. Nonlinear quantum ﬁelds play
a central role in ﬁnance: Interest rates on ﬁxed deposits are a pillar of the debt
market, and interest rates are described by a nonlinear two-dimensional quantum
ﬁeld. To study this aspect of ﬁnance, interest rates are analyzed. Currently, the main
instrument for interest rates in the ﬁnancial system is Libor, the London interbank
offered rate. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has indicated that Libor is going
to replaced by 2022.1 The discussions in this and subsequent Chapters 20 and
21 analyze Libor, as the market is using this instrument and all market data on
interest rates are based on Libor. However, the mathematics developed in this and
subsequent chapters is independent of Libor and is equally applicable to any interest
rate instrument.
Libor is often quoted and widely used by banks and ﬁnancial institutions. Libor
is one of the main instruments in the debt market and is the basis for many interest
rate instruments such as caplet, coupon bond options and swaptions. The three-
month Libor is widely used for setting the spot interest rate and is also the basis of
the Libor derivative market.
The continuously compounded instantaneous forward interest rates have been
discussed extensively in Chapter 10. The instantaneous forward rates are not
directly observable in the market, and need to be extracted from zero coupon bonds,
as discussed in Section 10.13. Hence, it is difﬁcult to use forward interest rates to
price traded instruments such as caps. Moreover, another intrinsic shortcoming of
forward interest rates, including its quantum ﬁnance generalization discussed in
1 Regulator calls on banks to replace Libor by 2022. www.ft.com/content/04dd3316-72ab-11e7-aca6-
c6bd07df1a3c.

19.1 Introduction
525
Section 10.2, is that the forward interest rates have a ﬁnite probability of being
negative.
Interest rates on cash deposits must be strictly positive and the Libor market
model (LMM) was introduced primarily for this reason. Brace, Gatarek and
Musiela (BGM) introduced the use of log-normal interest rates rather than forward
interest rates, for modeling Libor and is the industry standard [Brace et al. (1996)].
Black’s caplet formula can be exactly derived in this framework [Baaquie (2010)].
The LMM was signiﬁcantly developed and pricing swap rates were extensively
studied by Jamshidian (1997).
Similar to the Heath–Jarrow–Morton (HJM) model, the BGM model has the
same limitation in that the entire Libor rates are driven by a single white noise.
As observed from the market data, the Libor interest rates L(t, Tn), which have
dynamics similar to the forward interest rates, show randomness in both calendar
and future time. Hence, in principle and practice, the Libor rates for different future
time are imperfectly correlated.
To overcome the shortcoming of the BGM model, the volatility structure was
studied by Anderson and Andresean (2000). To capture more information from the
correlation of Libor interest rates, another approach is to incorporate a series of
white noises coupled with different volatility functions, which have been studied
by Brigo and Mercurio (2007). However, the different volatility functions need to
be calibrated to agree with the market data and a ﬁnite number of white noises is
not enough to capture all the information of the correlation function. If an inﬁnite
number of white noises is introduced, the methods are then not applicable and
inefﬁcient in practice. The calibration of the Libor market model has been studied
in many books and articles, such as Rebonato and Joshi (2002) and Brigo and
Mercurio (2007); all the calibration algorithms are designed and applied using the
BGM framework.
Intuitively, the Libor rates can be formulated and simulated using the quantum
ﬁnance approach. Baaquie (2009) gave a generalized formulation of the Libor mar-
ket model and the quantum ﬁnance approach is discussed extensively in Baaquie
(2010). The empirical analysis of the quantum formulation of the LMM has been
studied in Baaquie and Yang (2009).
The LMM model is deﬁned and two separate and exact derivations are given of
the nonlinear drift – based on the martingale condition – using the Wilson expansion
and a nonlinear Hamiltonian.
The present value of cash received in the future is obtained by discounting the
future payments by the forward interest rates f(t, x), deﬁned in Section 10.2. The
zero coupon bond, from Eq. 10.2.1, is given by

The quantum ﬁnance model for f(t, x), from Eqs. 10.3.1 and 10.4.2, is given by
∂f(t, x)
∂t
= α(t, x) + σ(t, x)A(t, x)
E[A(t, x)A(t′, x′)] = δ(t −t′)D(x −t; x′ −t)
Both α(t, x), σ(t, x) are deterministic functions. Empirical evidence from zero
coupon and coupon bond data shows that it is sufﬁcient to study the relatively
simple model for f(t, x) for which α(t, x), σ(t, x) are deterministic functions. This,
however, does not hold good for returns on cash deposits.
Let fL(t, x) be the Libor forward interest rates determining the future value of
cash deposits obtained by compounding the present-day value. In principle f(t, x)
can be used for computing the future value of cash deposits earning compound
interest. However, f(t, x) is differentiated from fL(t, x) for discussing Libor, since
the modeling of these rates is quite distinct.
The Libor forward interest rates fL(t, x) have same properties as the empirical
forward interest rates and the bond forward interest rates. The Libor zero coupon
bond is the bond discounted from future time T to present time t. Consider a cash
deposit to be made at future time Tn and for a duration (tenor) of ℓ, usually taken to
be three-months. One earns simple interest on the cash deposit given by Libor,
denoted by L(t, Tn). In discussing discounting and compounding for Libor, the

For fL(t, x) << 1, Eq. 19.1.2 yields L(t, Tn) ≃fL(t, x), as has been assumed in
Section 10.6.
The Libor forward interest rates, fL(t, x) are deﬁned for both calendar and future
time. The Libor forward rates in quantum ﬁnance approach are similar to Eqs.
10.3.1 and 10.4.2 and given by
∂fL(t, x)
∂t
= μ(t, x) + v(t, x)A(t, x)

E[A(t, x)A(t′, x′)] = δ(t −t′)D(x −t, x′ −t)
(19.1.4)

19.2 Libor: Simple interest rate
527
where D(x, x′; t) is the correlation function of the Libor forward interest rates
between different future times x and x′. D(x, x′; t) is the propagator in terminology
of quantum ﬁeld theory.
Although Eq. 19.1.3 looks similar to Eq. 10.3.1, there is a fundamental differ-
ence in that one has the additional requirement on Eq. 19.1.3 that fL(t, x) must
always yield L(t, Tn) > 0. This constraint leads to both μ(t, x), v(t, x) becoming
nonlinear and nonlocal functions of A(t, x). Unless the proper choice is made for
μ(t, x), v(t, x), Eq. 19.1.3 is unstable and leads to diverging values of fL(t, x).
The fact that μ(t, x), v(t, x) are nonlinear functions of fL(t, x) makes both L(t, Tn)
and fL(t, x) nonlinear two-dimensional quantum ﬁelds.
An ingenious method was found by BGM to choose the appropriate μ(t, x),
v(t, x). Instead of starting from the evolution equation given by Eq. 19.1.3, BGM
postulated that one could directly model Libor in terms of L(t, Tn). The BGM
formulation of LMM is deﬁned by [Brace et al. (1996)]
1
L(t, Tn)
∂L(t, Tn)
∂t
= ξn(t) + γn(t)R(t)
ξn(t) is the drift, which is a function of Libor rates L(t, Tn), and hence this makes
the model nonlinear. γn(t) is a deterministic function and R(t) is Gaussian white
noise given by
E[R(t)] = 0; E[R(t)R(t′)] = δ(t −t′)
The quantum formulation of LMM, which generalizes the BGM formulation, is
given by [Baaquie (2010)]

∂t

 Tn+ℓ

dxγ (t, x)A(t, x)
(19.1.5)
γ (t, x) is a deterministic volatility function and ξ(t, Tn) is a nonlinear function of
A(t, x). The quantum generalization of the Libor market model gives a full descrip-
tion of correlation functions and accurately models the imperfect correlations of
Libors that exist in the market [Baaquie and Yang (2009)].
Eq. 19.1.5 is well deﬁned and yields convergent solutions for Libor because
γ (t, x) is a deterministic volatility function. In particular, γ (t, x) is determined from
market data and it is shown how to completely ﬁx the drift ξ(t, Tn) as a function of
L(t, Tn) and γ (t, x) using the martingale condition. Determining the drift ξ(t, Tn), in
effect, shows that Eq. 19.1.5 is consistent with Eq. 19.1.3.
19.2 Libor: Simple interest rate
Libor is a simple interest rate instrument that was launched on January 1, 1986, by
the British Bankers’ Association. Libor is a daily quoted rate based on the interest

rates at which commercial banks are willing to lend funds to other banks in the
London interbank money market. The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) is
similar to Libor and is the benchmark rate of the euro money market, which has
emerged since 1999. Euribor is a simple interest rate that is paid for ﬁxed deposits
in the euro currency.
Cash deposits can earn simple interest rates for a given period of time. For
example, one can lock in at time t, a simple interest rate, denoted by L(t; T1, T2), for
a ﬁxed deposit from future time T1 to T2. The period of the deposit, namely T2 −T1,
is called the tenor of the simple interest rate.
A deposit of $1, made for duration of time T1 to T2 and paying simple interest,
will increase to an amount 1+(T2−T1)L(t; T1, T2). Similarly, the present-day value
of a Libor zero coupon bond B(t, T), paid at future time T, is given by
B(t, T) =
1
1 + (T −t)L(t; t, T)
and more generally
B(t, T2) = B(t, T1)
1
1 + (T2 −T1)L(t; T1, T2)
(19.2.1)
From the deﬁnition of zero coupon bonds given in Eq. 10.2.1 the simple interest
rates are given in terms of the instantaneous forward interest rates by Eq. 19.2.1

Libor for ℓ= three months’ tenure is widely used for pricing interest rate options
and other instruments; henceforth Libor for only three months’ tenure is considered.
The Libor time lattice is deﬁned by Tn = T0 + ℓn and is shown in Figure 19.1(a).

The zero coupon bond is issued at T0 and expires at Tn + ℓ.
The Libor rates are related to the zero coupon bonds by Eq. 19.2.5, namely
B(t, Tn + ℓ) =
B(t, Tn)
1 + ℓL(t, Tn)
(19.2.7)
Eq. 19.2.7 provides a recursion equation that allows one to express B(t, T) solely in
terms of L(t, T). Note that Libors are only deﬁned for discrete future time given by
Libor future time T = Tn = nℓ, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ∞. Libor future and calendar time
lattices are shown in Figure 19.1.

Bonds B(t, T0) that have time t not at a Libor time ℓk cannot be expressed
solely in terms of Libor rates. Consider zero coupon bonds that are issued at Libor
time, say, T0, and mature at another Libor time Tk+1; the Libor calendar and future
time lattices are shown in Figure 19.1(b). Since B(T0, T0) = 1, zero coupon bond

19.3 Wilson expansion and Libor drift
Numeraire is a basic concept by which the future cash ﬂow of ﬁnancial instruments
is discounted. As shown in Eq. 19.2.6, the combination L(t, Tn)B(t, Tn+1) can be
expressed as a portfolio of zero coupon bonds. This unique feature of Libor rates
leads to the unusual martingale condition of Libor rates given by
ℓL(t, Tn)B(t, Tn+1)
B(t, TI+1)
= B(t, Tn)
B(t, TI+1) −B(t, Tn+1)
B(t, TI+1)
(19.3.1)
The portfolio of zero coupon bonds is seen to be the difference of two discounted
zero coupon bonds, both of which can be rendered into martingales by an appropri-
ate choice of the drift. Hence, one chooses the forward bond numeraire, similar to
Eq. 10.10.11 and given by
χn(t) = B(t, Tn)
B(t, TI+1)
(19.3.2)
in which all instruments χn(t) are martingales for n = 0, ±1, ±2, ..., ±∞. Because
of the martingale condition, the nonlinear and nontrivial drift ξ(t, Tn) can be derived
by using a common Libor numeraire given by B(t, TI+1). The nonlinear stochastic
drift draws a distinction between the linear HJM model and nonlinear BGM model.
The martingale condition is given by
E
(∂χn(t)
∂t
)
= 0: martigale condition
The martingale condition, similar to Eq. 10.10.13, yields the following drift
[Baaquie (2010)]:
μI(t, x) =

dx′v(t, x)D(x, x′, t)v(t, x′)
(19.3.3)
One needs to replace the stochastic volatility v(t, x) by L(t, Tn), γ (t, x) to complete
the mapping from fL(t, x) to L(t, Tn).
Baaquie (2009) has given a derivation of ξ(t, Tn) in Baaquie (2010). A alternative
derivation of stochastic drift ξ(t, Tn) is given by Baaquie and Pan (2011). The
deﬁning equation for the LMM given in Eq. 19.1.5 yields

Differentiating Eq. 19.2.4 and using Eq. 19.1.3, the result for drift given in

Gaussian quantum ﬁelds is given by Baaquie (2010):
A(t, x)A(t, x′) = 1
ϵ D(x, x′; t)
(19.3.8)
Expressing D(x, x′; t) in terms of the quantum ﬁeld A(t, x), the drift ξ(t, Tn) can be
rewritten as

over v(t, x) that remains to be transformed to γ (t, x). Notice that the integral on x is
from TI+1 to Tn+1, which can be expanded in terms of only one Libor tenor time.

In summary, for each instant t Libor L(t, Tn) – which is the simple interest con-
tracted at time t for ﬁxed deposits made for the duration of interval [Tn, Tn+1] –
there is a single, separate drift given by ξ(t, Tn); this drift, in turn, is determined by
the forward bond numeraire B(t, TI+1).

˜ρ(t, x) makes the Libor ﬁeld ϕ(t, x) a nonlinear two-dimensional Euclidean quan-
tum ﬁeld. The deﬁning feature of the LMM is that the volatility function γ (t, x) is

It is shown by Baaquie (2010) that the Jacobian of the transformation given
in Eq. 19.4.14 is a constant, independent of ϕ(t, x), in spite of the fact that
the transformation in Eq. 19.4.14 is nonlinear due to the nonlinearity of Libor
drift ρ(t, x). A constant Jacobian leads to ϕ(t, x) being ﬂat variables, with no
measure term in the path integral. Flat variables have a well-deﬁned leading
order Gaussian path integral that generates a Feynman perturbation expansion
for all ﬁnancial instruments, thus greatly simplifying all calculations that are based
on ϕ(t, x).

(t, x) is a deterministic function and ρ(t, x) is a nonlinear stochastic term.
In the derivation of the martingale condition discussed in Section 10.9, the spot
rate r(t) was used, with the discounting instrument being the return on the money
market account. In other words, the discounted instrument follows a martingale
evolution and yields the following:

There is nothing special about using the money market account given by
exp{
 t∗
t dt′r(t′)} as the numeraire; any positive-valued ﬁnancial instrument is
equally suitable as a numeraire, with the drift changing with the change of
numeraire. For Libor, it is more suitable to discount the zero coupon bond with
another zero coupon bond, chosen to be B(t, TI+1), which has a ﬁxed maturity at
future time TI+1.
The nonlinear drift for LMM, using the Hamiltonian approach, has been deter-
mined exactly by Baaquie (2010) and in Section 19.3 using the Wilson expansion.
Choose the numeraire to be the zero coupon bond B(t, TI+1); for all n, the drift is
ﬁxed by the following instrument:
χn(t) ≡B(t, Tn+1)
B(t, TI+1)

19.6 Swaps; swaptions
The results on interest swaptions, studied in detail in Baaquie (2010), are
summarized.
A swaption is an option on the underlying swap, and for this reason the interest
rate swap is brieﬂy reviewed. To quantify the value of a swap, let the swap start at
Libor time T0, with payments made at ﬁxed times Tn = T0+nℓ, with n = 1, 2, ..., N;
the ﬁrst payment is made at T1 and the last payment is made at time TN; each
payment is a swaplet, with one party paying ﬂoating Libor and the other party
paying ﬁxed interest rate RS. Figure 19.3 shows the cash ﬂow in an interest rate
swap, where Party A pays at ﬁxed rates RS and receives payments at ﬂoating Libor;
Party B has the complementary cash ﬂow.

19.6 Swaps; swaptions
543
In sum, at time t0, the values of the forward swaplets – corresponding to a series
of interest rate payments made at future times Tn – yield the following forward price
for the receiving ﬂoating Libor and paying ﬁxed interest rate RS swap:
swapL(t0, RS) = ℓV

(19.6.2)
The swaps obey the identity

(19.6.3)
One can simplify the expression for the swaps. The Libor zero coupon bonds,
from Eq. 19.2.6, yield
L(t, T) = 1

with a similar expression for swapR.
An interest rate swaption, denoted by CL and CR, is an option on a ﬂoating or a
ﬁxed interest rate receiver swap, swapL and swapR, respectively.
Consider a swap with N payment dates given by Tn = T0 + nℓ; n = 1, 2, ..., N;
the swap starts at time T0, the ﬁrst payment is made at time T1 and the last payment
is made at time TN. A midcurve swaption, similar to a midcurve caplet, is contracted
at time t0 and matures at time t∗< T0. The payoff function for a midcurve swaption
is given in Figure 11.12(a) and is the same as a midcurve forward swap. The
swaption is an option on the swap and hence has the same cash ﬂow as a swap
if it is exercised.
The swaption that is analyzed in this section is the one that matures at t∗= T0,
when the swap becomes operational, and is shown in Figure 11.12(b). Almost all

market data on swaptions is exclusively given for this case and is, consequently, the
most important one for empirical studies of swaptions.
The swaption, on maturing, will be exercised only if the value of the swap at
time T0 is greater than its initial par value of zero. Hence, the payoff function for
the swaption for the ﬂoating and ﬁxed receivers swap, from Eqs. 19.6.1 and 19.6.2,
is given respectively by the following:

and similarly for CR(t, T0, RS). One can see that a swap is equivalent to a particular

can be used for analyzing swaptions.
Discounting by the forward bond numeraire B(t, T0), similar to the case of
coupon bond options given in Eq. 11.10.1, makes the swaption price computation-
ally more tractable; the price of the swaption, from Eq. 19.6.7, is given by

19.7 Black’s model for swaption
545
A change of numeraire changes the drift for the forward interest rates, as
discussed in Section 10.10.
19.7 Black’s model for swaption
Market data for swaptions, including the data provided by Bloomberg, is quoted in
terms of an effective volatility for the swaption based on Black’s model – similar to
the implied volatility surface being provided for the price of vanilla stock options.
From the effective volatility, the swaption price can be reconstructed. Hence, to
obtain the empirical value of the swaptions, Black’s formula for a swaption is brieﬂy
discussed [van den Hoek (2012)].
Consider coupon payments paid at ﬁxed times Ti = ℓi with duration of swap
being n years. In our case ℓ= 90 days, and Tn is the time when the coupon payment
is made and m is the number of times per year that the swaption payments are made;
the case of m = 2 is for semiannual swaption payments. Let the total number of
payments be N. The last payment of the coupon bond, which includes the payment
of the principal, is made at time TN. Hence
N = mn; TN = ℓmn
(19.7.1)
The swaption, a call option on a swap, has a payoff function, at time t∗when
it matures, given by Eqs. 19.6.5 or 19.6.6 – depending on whether it is a receiving
ﬂoating or ﬁxed swaption, respectively. The swaption for payer paying ﬁxed interest
rate Rk is given by
Cp
s(t∗) = V[swap(t∗)]+
For payments at equal time intervals one has Ti −Ti−1 = ℓ, which is the period
for each ﬁxed payment. Denote the zero coupon bonds by R(t, Tn) to include risky
as well as risk-free bonds. The swaption, from Eq. 19.6.7, is given by

19.8 Summary
Nonlinear interest rates determine the compounding rates of return on ﬁxed
deposits, and are the converse of zero coupon bonds, which determine the dis-
counted present value of future cash ﬂows. In principle, the same forward interest
rates determine both the compounding of cash deposits and discounting of future
cash payments.
As seen in Chapter 10, linear forward interest rates provide a very accurate model
of the market behavior of the zero coupon bonds. However, for cash deposits a
three-month Libor is a simple interest rate and requires nonlinear forward interest
rates for their modeling.
The Libor market model is the market standard for a mathematical description
of Libor, and the quantum ﬁnance generalization leads to a description based on a
nonlinear two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld.
The LMM has a nonlinear drift, and two ﬁeld-theoretic derivations of this drift
were given, one based on the Wilson expansion and the other on the Hamiltonian
operator.
Swaps and swaptions are interest rate derivatives used widely in the ﬁnancial
markets, and these instruments were deﬁned in terms of underlying Libor. The
market quotes the daily value for swaptions in terms of Black’s model, and a
derivation was given of Black’s model.

Simulation of nonlinear interest rates*
20.1 Introduction
Nonlinear quantum ﬁelds are notoriously difﬁcult to study and numerical tech-
niques are usually the most fruitful approach to these ﬁelds. As mentioned in
Chapter 19, Libor is currently the most widely used and accepted instrument for
interest rates. To examine the nonlinearities of interest rates, the Libor market model
(LMM) is numerically studied. The nonlinearity of the LMM lies in the nonlinear
drift term, which in turn is ﬁxed by the martingale condition. The focus in this chap-
ter is on analyzing the interplay of the martingale condition with the drift term –
and the price of interest rate caps is numerically evaluated to study this interplay.
The framework of quantum LMM, discussed in Chapter 19, is used for the
simulation. The imperfectly correlated Libor rates are simulated using a Gaussian
quantum ﬁeld, which in turn generates a recursion equation for the nontrivial
stochastic Libor drift. The three-month Libor is simulated and is used for generating
the price of the various instruments. Libor-based ﬁnancial instruments (such as
caplets and swaptions) are studied using both Monte Carlo simulations and the
volatility perturbative expansion. In particular, the simulated value of a caplet price
is compared with Black’s caplet formula, which is exactly derived from the LMM.
The invariance of the caplet price for different forward bond numeraires is veriﬁed
by using the simulation.
The simulation method is seen to have great potential in pricing interest rate
instruments. The discussion in this chapter is largely based on the results obtained
by Baaquie and Pan (2011, 2012).
20.2 Simulating Libor
Suppose the present Libor interest rate is L(t0, Tn); the Libor rate L(T0, Tn) at cal-
endar time t ,where t > t0, from Eq. 19.4.7, is given by

Eq. 20.2.1 is used for updating the Libor rates since it is valid when the updating
step size ϵ is small for calendar time t. In the Monte Carlo simulation, the Libor
rates are updated on a discrete time lattice. The Libor L(t, Tn) on future time is
deﬁned on a lattice with interval of tenor ℓ. The value of nn(t) and A(t, x) also
requires discrete future time, and hence, discretizing calendar and future time yields
t, x →ti = t0 + iϵ,
Tn →Tn = t0 + nℓ
where t0 denotes the initial value of calendar time. The initial value of future time
Tn should also be the present time, which is T0 = t0.
From Eq. 20.2.2, the updating process for the Libor rates is given by
L(ti + ϵ, Tn) = L(ti, Tn) exp

β(ti, ti + ϵ, Tn) + ϵWn

Hence
L(ti + ϵ, Tn) = L(ti, Tn) exp

(20.2.3)
In Eq. 20.2.3, the approximation β(ti, ti+ϵ, Tn) ≃ϵξ(ti, Tn) is assumed. In principle
the value of β(ti, ti + ϵ, Tn) is integrated from ti to ti + ϵ; but the future value of
the drift is not known so this approximation is necessary. Furthermore, for small
enough ϵ the error is negligible.
Libor for future time T is deﬁned on the Libor lattice of Tn with tenor ℓ. As shown
in Eq. 20.2.3, only the time step ϵ is needed to be small (e.g., ϵ = one day = 1/360
year). However, the step size ℓis not restricted to be as small as ϵ. It is known that
the tenor of Libor is taken to be three months. This means that the updating step size

of calendar time ϵ and future time ℓare not equal.1 Figure 20.1 shows the lattice of
updating process for Libor market model.
The updating step size of calendar time is taken to be 1 day and 90 days for
future time, which is given by

lattice with spacing ϵ:

• The initial value of L(t0, Tn) and ξ(t0, Tn) has to be ﬁxed.
• Once the value of L(ti, Tn) is known for all Tn, the value of the drift ξ(ti, Tn) is
completely ﬁxed by the formula for drift given in Eq. 19.3.18.
The nonlinear drift ξ(t, Tn) is the most important term in Libor market model.
Figure 20.2 shows the updating of Libor rates where Tn > TI. As shown in
Eq. 19.3.18, one needs the Libor rates L(ti, TI+1), L(ti, TI+2), . . . , L(ti, Tn) to
obtain the drift ξ(ti, Tn). Hence, in order to get the Libor rates L(ti + ϵ, Tn) of the
next step, the Libor rates of all future time Ti and calendar ti are needed. This
nonlinear feature of the Libor market model can give rise to nontrivial and novel
properties.
1 The updating step size of calendar and future time is equal for the case of instantaneous forward interest rates,
since calendar time t and future time x are both continuous and the updating step size of t and x need to be equal

• To obtain numerical values for ξ(ti, Tn) requires that the numeraire B(t, TI+1) has

• The stochastic term

 Tn+1

has an integration from Tn to Tn+1 in continuous future time. The lattice quantum
ﬁeld A(t, x) is deﬁned on a lattice with the same step size of ϵ for both t and
x directions, as shown in Figure 20.2. After generating A(t, x) on the lattice
of future time with spacing ϵ, the term  can be obtained by performing the
integration on the future time x. The quantum ﬁeld A(ti, x) has to be simulated to
obtain sample values of the stochastic quantity .
Hence, the three terms on right-hand side of Eq. 20.2.3 take values on the same
lattice, with the calendar time lattice being ϵ and the future time lattice being ℓ.
20.2.1 Intitial conditions
For the ﬁrst updating step t0 →t0 + ϵ, only the initial value ξ(t0, Tn) is given.
Hence, in the ﬁrst updating step, the approximation β(t0, t0 + ϵ, Tn) ≃ϵξ(t0, Tn) is
chosen for this simulation. The step size ϵ is chosen to be one day in this simula-
tion; the difference between β(ti, ti + ϵ, Tn) and ϵξ(ti, Tn) is negligible. The same
approximation is also made for Wn. Therefore, the initial condition for updating is
given by

−fxℓ(Tn −t0)

(20.2.4)
where fx is ﬁxed at 1.2 and f0 is set to be 0.3 for all the interest rate instruments
simulated in this chapter. The large value of Libor rates (L(t0, Tn) is around 0.3)
is chosen because the payoff function of coupon bond options and swaptions is in
terms of bonds; if f0 is small, the bond price does not change much. To clearly
observe the dynamics of the Libor market model, f0 = 0.3 is used for the initial
condition. In this simulation, 10 points of three-month Libor rates are generated,
which means that 0 ≤n < 10 for Tn.
To obtain the initial value ξ(t0, Tn) one needs L(t0, Tn) and the volatility function
γm(θ). Libor volatility γm(θ), with θ = x −t as time to maturity in the unit of year,
is taken as an (empirical) input in the simulation. It is obtained from the formula of
Baaquie and Yang (2009) that is given below
γm(θ) = 0.051 −0.038e−1.36∗(θ−0.25) + 0.279(θ −0.25)e−1.36∗(θ−0.25)
(20.2.5)
The volatility γm(θ) is plotted in Figure 20.3.
20.2.2 Libor drift
Empirical studies of interest rates show that it is the real branch of the propagator
given in Section 10.4.1 that is realized in the market [Baaquie (2010)]. The stiff
propagator for interest rates used for the simulation is given by Eq. 10.4.9:

The quantum ﬁeld A(t, x) has to be deﬁned on a ﬁnite lattice for the purpose
of simulation. The deﬁning equation for the Gaussian quantum ﬁeld A(t, x) is the
propagator given by
E[A(t, x)A(t′, x′)] = δ(t −t′)D(θ, θ′); θ = x −t, θ′ = x′ −t
The matrix D(x, x′; t) = D(θ, θ′) is a symmetric function of remaining future
time θ, θ′. Because the propagator (correlation function) D is always a positive and
symmetric matrix, the Cholesky decomposition can be used for decomposing D into
the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose.
Let 0 ≤θ ≤θM, where θM = Tmax −t and Tmax is the maximum future time; the
Cholesky decomposition for the propagator yields [Baaquie and Pan (2012)]
D(θ, θ′) =

where R(t, ζ) is an independent Gaussian random variable for each calendar time
t and future remaining time ζ. The consistency of the decomposition given in
Eq. 20.3.3 is veriﬁed by the following:

The simulation requires that both calendar and future time be discretized. For
inﬁnitesimals ϵt, ϵx let
t, x →mϵt, nϵx; θ →p = m −n
Let Tk = kℓ; for the simulation ℓ= 90ϵ. The quantum ﬁeld AL(t, x) and log

k(t, x) →(k)

For the process of updating ϕm,n, the step sizes of calendar time t and of future
time x are chosen to be equal, given by ϵ = ϵt = ϵx = 1 day. The lattice on which
ϕm,n and Am,n are evaluated is given in Figure 20.5.

The ﬁrst eigenvalue is nearly 96% of the sum of eigenvalues, 3% and 0.4% are

are enough for accurately representing the propagator. The three eigenfunctions
have the following interpretation.
• The leading eigenvector is y0, contributing 96% to the sum of eigenvalues – which
is a movement of the entire forward interest rate curve.
• The next eigenvector is y1, contributing 3% – is a movement of only the forward
interest rates curve near present time.
• The smallest eigenvector is y2, contributing only 0.4%, – a movement of the
forward interest rates curve peaking near 400 days into the future.

(20.3.8)
From Eq. 20.3.7, three white noises are sufﬁcient to generate sample values of
ϕm+1,n. This is due to the fact that three eigenvectors dominate the eigenfunction
expansion of the propagator D(x, x′; t) – and hence are enough to describe the
propagator D(x, x′; t). Eq. 20.3.6 shows that the sample values of the quantum
ﬁeld A(t, x) can also be generated by three white noises due to the eigenfunction
expansion.
For these reasons, one can think of the quantum Libor market model as a three-
factor model. However, there is a major difference between the quantum LMM
and the three-factor BGM model; this difference lies in the fact that the propagator
D(x, x′; t) has to be evaluated before its eigenfuctions can be evaluated. And to
evaluate the propagator from market data, one needs the full quantum formulation
of the Libor market model.
20.4 Caplet
Black’s caplet price has been derived exactly for the quantum LMM in Baaquie
(2010). The price of a caplet is obtained by a simulation; the accuracy of the
simulation is gauged by comparing it with the exact quantum Black’s caplet price.
Black’s caplet formula is a powerful tool for testing the simulation.

20.4 Caplet
559
The price of a midcurve caplet on Libor L(t∗, Tn), maturing at time t∗> t0, is
given by
Caplet(t∗, t∗, Tn) = ℓVB(t∗, Tn + ℓ)[L(t∗, Tn) −K]+
(20.4.1)
where V is the principal of the caplet and is taken to be 1 in this simulation.
The price of the caplet at present time, under discounting with the forward bond
numeraire B(t, TI + ℓ), is given by
Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn)
B(t0, TI + ℓ)
= E
(Caplet(t∗, t∗, Tn)
B(t∗, TI + ℓ)
)
(20.4.2)
If TI is taken to be equal to Tn, the caplet price is then given by
E
(Caplet(t∗, t∗, Tn)
B(t∗, Tn + ℓ)
)
= ℓVE[L(t∗, Tn) −K]+
(20.4.3)
As shown in Eq. 19.3.18, for numeraire B(t, Tn+1), the Libor rate from Tn to Tn + ℓ
has zero drift and Black’s caplet formula can be obtained analytically.
Black’s formula for caplet price is given by [Baaquie (2010)]

Figure 20.7. The maturity time t∗of caplet is set to be 180 days and Tn is set to be
equal to 360 days. As shown in Eq. 20.4.5, the key term in pricing the caplet is the
value of q2
n, which is of order γ 2. In order to test the stability of our simulation,
the deterministic volatility function γ (t, x) is multiplied with different constant
number 1 and 100. Other values between 1 and 100 are not tested because the
simulation with γ = 100γM also works very well. A quantity that is a measure of
how important the nonlinearities in the evaluation of a caplet are is given by

The parameters for the simulation of caplet are shown in Table 20.2. The sim-
ulation results are compared with the exact price of Black’s caplet formula. As
expected, and shown in Figure 20.8, the Black’s caplet price is in the range of
Monte Carlo error even when the value of q2
n is up to 1.5.
20.5 Caplet price: Numeraire invariant
The results for the caplet price have been obtained when the drift ξ(t, Tn) is zero.
Stochastic drift ξ(t, Tn) is the most important term in the Libor market model,
and for this reason the simulation of caplet price with nontrivial drift needs to be
investigated. It is well known that the caplet price Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) is invariant
under different forward bond numeraires B(t, TI+1), as shown in Eq. 20.4.2.

Figure 20.9(c) shows the domain required to price Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) using
B(t, Tn+2) as the forward bond numeraire. Although Caplet(t0, t∗, Tn) is only deﬁned
on the time interval from Tn to Tn+1, the Libor L(t∗, Tn+1) is still needed, as shown
in Eq. 20.5.1, to cancel the negative drift that arises due to the choice of numeraire.
Expectation value in the Eq. 20.5.1 cannot be solved analytically and can only be
evaluated using the simulation method.
To investigate and better understand the invariance of caplet price with nontrivial
drift, the cases of I = n −2, I = n −1, I = n + 1 and I = n + 2 are simulated

where E[...] denotes the expectation value for different numeraires B(t, TI+1). As
shown in equation above, the ﬂuctuation of the expectation value increases when I
increases, and hence the Monte Carlo error increases with increasing I. The caplet
price of I = n −2 is closest to the exact price because of its small Monte Carlo
error, while the caplet price of I = n+2 has biggest difference with the exact price.

simulation works for all smaller values of γ . Figures 20.10 and 20.11(a) show
the caplet price using simulation under different forward bond numeraires for 60γM
and 100γM, respectively. In both cases, the exact caplet price is in the range of
Monte Carlo error of simulation, which is plotted in Figures 20.10 and 20.11(b).
As expected, shown in Figure 20.10, the caplet price is invariant for different
forward bond numeraires. However, as shown in Figure 20.11(a), the caplet price
of I = n −1 and I = n −2 is lower than zero drift, while the caplet price of
I = n + 1 and I = n + 2 is a little larger. This result is different from the result
of 60γM for the reason that the Monte Carlo error can be quite large for the case
of 100γM. Compared with the case of zero drift I = n, shown in Figure 20.11, the
Monte Carlo error increases as I increases. This is because the Monte Carlo error
is calculated from the expectation value of the payoff function.

numeraires with γ = 100γM, and the sample conﬁguration is 100N = 109. Figure
from Baaquie and Pan (2012).
All simulation results are within the Monte Carlo error. The Monte Carlo error
can be reduced when the sample size N is increased. As expected, and shown in
Figure 20.12, the simulation results are nearly the same as Black’s caplet price
when the sample size is increased to 100N.
The simulation results provide clear evidence that the price of a caplet is invariant
if different numeraires are used. The test of changing forward bond numeraires
appears to conﬁrm the correctness of our simulation and suggests that other more
complex instruments can be priced using the simulation method.
20.6 Libor zero coupon bond option
Zero coupon bond call options can be evaluated exactly since the forward interest
rates are linear, with a quadratic Lagrangian; an exact derivation of the zero coupon
bond option is given in Section 10.11. In contrast, the Libor Lagrangian is nonlinear
and Libor zero coupon bonds are also nonlinear functions of Libor, given by
B(t0, Tn) =
n−1

i=0
1
1 + ℓL(t0, Ti)
The Libor zero coupon bond option cannot be evaluated analytically, and needs to
be evaluated either perturbatively or by using numerical simulations of Libor.
From Eqs. 19.4.7, 19.4.8 and 19.4.9

The volatility expansion for Libor interest rates is extensively studied in Baaquie
(2010). The stochastic drift β(t0, T0, Tn) ≡βn(t) is approximated by deterministic
drift β(0)(t0, t, Tn) ≡β(0)
n (t), since it is of order γ 2. Hence, Libor is given by
L(t, Tn) = L(t0, Tn)eβn(t)+Wn(t) ≃L(t0, Tn)eβ(0)
n (t)+Wn(t)
= ˜L(t0, Tn) + L(t0, Tn)(eWn −1) + O(γ 3)
(20.6.1)
The numeraire is chosen to be B(t, T0), so that I = −1. Hence, for Tn > TI and
from Eq. 19.3.18

Libor L(t, Tn) in Eq. 20.6.1 is log normal since the drift term is no longer stochastic.
Thus, the expectation value of L(t, Tn) can be calculated analytically because the
expectation value of (eWn −1) can be obtained by performing Gaussian integration.
The two expectation values that are used for pricing the options are given by
E[eWn −1] = 0,

E[(eWm −1)(eWn −1)] = emn −1 ≃mn + O(γ 4)

Consider the price of a zero coupon bond B(t0, Tn) at Libor calendar time t0,
which matures at Tn. A call option on the zero coupon bond, with strike price K and
which matures at future time T0 > t0, has a payoff function given by
P∗= [B(T0, Tn) −K]+
(20.6.6)
For the forward bond numeraire B(t0, T0), the call option price at present time t0,
denoted by C(t0, T0, K), is given by
C(t0, T0, K) = B(t0, T0)E[B(T0, Tn) −K]+

As discussed in Baaquie (2010), the volatility expansion for the call price of zero
coupon bond is given as follows:

For pricing the Libor zero coupon bond option, two different maturity times are
used: The maturity time t∗is set to be 180 days, while T0 is chosen to be 270 days;
bond maturity time Tn is chosen to be 900 days. Figure 20.13 shows the different
maturity times for the Libor zero coupon bond option.

The simulation of the option price *C(t0, T0, K) is plotted and compared with the
approximate price, which is based on the volatility expansion with an accuracy of
O(γ 2). As expected, shown in Figure 20.14(a), the simulation results are exactly
the same as the approximate price when γ = γM in which γ is order of 0.01.

568
Simulation of nonlinear interest rates
However, the approximate price has a small difference with the option price of
simulation when γ = 30γM in which mn is around 0.1 (shown in Figure 20.14(b)).
The absolute error for this case is around 2% and this small difference can still be
accepted in practice. The approximate price tends to have large error when γ =
60γM and γ = 100γM (shown in Figure 20.14(c) and 20.14(d)), and the volatility
expansion fails to give the accurate approximation.
The approximate price is based on the value of mn, hence a reasonable range of
mn is critical for checking the validity of the approximate price. To investigate the
relationship between the accuracy of the approximate price and the value of mn,
the simulation results are obtained by varying the value of constant γ . This means
that the value of γ is ﬁxed to be a constant for all future time and the call price is
calculated for different values of γ .
In order to reduce the inﬂuence of strike price on the comparison, the strike
price is ﬁxed to be B(t0, Tn), which is the case of the at money option. Figure 20.15
shows the comparison between simulation results with approximate price for
different values of γ . Since the expansion is in terms of mn and the value
of nn is the largest value among mn, the value of nn is given as the x-axis
instead of γ .
It is shown that the approximate price works well when mn < 0.1 and differs
from the simulation results when mn becomes larger than 0.4. This ﬁnding is
important because one can calculate mn from market data and apply the approx-
imate formula if it is in the accepted range. The simulation method, in contrast, is
free from any such restriction and can be applied to any market instrument and for
all values of market data.

simulation are compared with approximate price when nn is from 0 to 0.8

Consider the price of a coupon bond option at time t0 = 0, with strike price K
and which matures at t∗= 180 days; the coupon bond pays ﬁxed dividends at two
different future times T1 = 540 days and T2 = 900 days, with coefﬁcients c1 = 0.5
and c2 = 1.5. The same set of parameters, which are shown in Table 20.3, are also
used for the simulation of coupon bonds except that the range of strike price is from
0.8 to 0.9.
As discussed above, the same expansion and approximation used for the zero
coupon bond option are used to obtain the approximate price of coupon bond
options. The reasonable working range of approximation for coupon bonds should
be same as for the zero coupon bond option because a coupon bond is simply the
combination of Nc zero coupon bonds. Figures 20.16(a) and (b) show the compar-
ison between simulation results and approximate price. Similar to the conclusion
for zero coupon bond options, the approximate price works quite well for the cases
of γ = γM and γ = 30γM. As shown in Figure 20.16(c) and (d), the approximate
price fails when γ = 60γM and γ = 100γM.
The simulation results for at the money coupon bond options are calculated. The

when mn is much larger. Likewise, the working range of approximate price for
coupon bond options is 0 ≤mn ≤0.1.

It seems that the error of the approximate price of swaption is smaller than the
zero coupon bond option and the coupon bond option when mn is large. This
is because the swaption is not a combination of zero coupon bonds or similar
to coupon bond options, the error of approximate prices may cancel and become
smaller. However, similar to coupon bond options, the approximate price of swap-
tion works perfectly when mn < 0.1.
20.9 Summary
The primary objective of this chapter was to explore the advantages of simulating
the Libor market model. The simulation method of numerically updating Libor
rates, in the framework of quantum ﬁnance, was derived and used to price interest
rate derivative instruments. The Libor rates were updated daily in calendar time
and in future time. The quantum ﬁeld A(t, x) was generated to incorporate the
correlation contained in the stiff propagator.
The caplet price was analyzed and compared with the well-known Black’s caplet
formula. It was shown that the caplet price obtained from Libor simulation ﬁts

Black’s caplet formula quite well. Caplet price is invariant on using different for-
ward bond numeraires, and this important feature was conﬁrmed by the simulation.

key term in the Libor market model and yields many novel properties.

model. The approximate price for these three instuments is based on the volatility
expansion that places limitations on the value of correlator mn. The simulation
results show that the approximate price can give accurate results when the corre-
lator mn < 0.1 and fails when mn is much larger. The key advantage of the
simulation method is that it can work for any value of the correlator mn. This
ﬁnding is signiﬁcant because it shows that the simulation method is ﬂexible and
has no limitations on the parameters.
The simulation method does not have any constraints for its validity, such as
volatility expansion, and is a powerful tool in pricing coupon bonds as well as
Libor derivative instruments.
20.10 Appendix: An accurate expansion
The comparison between simulation results and approximate price is given in
Sections 20.6, 20.7 and 20.8 for coupon bond options and European swaptions.
The expansion for approximate price is based on Eq. 20.6.5 and is given by
E[(eWm −1)(eWn −1)] = emn −1 ≃mn + O(γ 4)
The approximation of emn −1 ≈mn has been made in the above equation. This
approximation is valid when the value of mn is small and may have large error
when mn has a large value. The large volatility γ is tested for both the simulation
and approximate formula. Hence, it is reasonable to use emn −1 instead of mn for
the purpose of comparison. The approximate prices for zero coupon bond, coupon
bond options and swaptions are calculated using emn −1, and the results of the
comparison between simulation and formula are shown in Figure 20.20.
The results given in Figures 20.20(a), (c) and (e) show that using emn −1
instead of mn improves the approximate prices for zero coupon bonds and coupon
bonds European options, especially when the value of mn increases. The errors
of the approximate prices are given in Figure 20.20(b), (d) and (f). However, the
approximate price does not give a more accurate price for swaptions. This result
may be because a different expansion is used for obtaining the swaption price.
However, these two approximate prices using mn and emn −1 are equivalent
when the value of mn is in the range of small volatility expansion.

Interest rate range accrual swap*
21.1 Introduction
Interest rate range accrual swap is one of the most popular nonvanilla interest rate
derivatives; more than USD160 billion of range accrual indexed on interest rates
has been sold between 2004 and 2007; the total volume has been increasing rapidly
in the last few years. At present, almost all interest rate range accrual swaps are
based on the behavior of the three-month Libor. The range accrual swap is studied
in the quantum ﬁnance formulation of the Libor market model (LMM), which has
been discussed in Chapter 19.
Range accrual swap is a derivative ﬁnancial instrument that is similar to a normal
interest rate swap. However, the ﬁxed interest rate is stochastic, since the rate is
based on how many days a chosen index was within a prespeciﬁed range before the
payment date. Consider a 90-day Libor with coupons paid every 90 days. The issuer
can sell a range accrual swap for which the ﬂoating payment is a 90-day Libor but
the ﬁxed interest rate depends on how many days in the preceding 90-day period
the 90-day Libor was within a prespeciﬁed range.
The investor may have a view that the market is or is not very volatile and that
consequently some index will or will not stay within a predeﬁned range. The range
accrual index could be an interest rate, a foreign exchange (FX) rate or a commodity
price. The investor makes an additional proﬁt if the view taken is correct and loses
money otherwise. This is the essence of the range accrual swap, that the index stays
within a prespeciﬁed range.
The range accrual swap can serve to hedge interest rate risk since the payments
are based on daily observations and not on a predetermined ﬁxed interest rate. Since
the counting of whether the index is in or outside a given range is done daily, the
range accrual swap can be thought as strips of binary options, with a daily payoff
that is accumulated and goes toward determining the “ﬁxed” interest rate that is
paid on the payment date.

Interest rate range accrual swap
There are also callable range accrual swaps in which the issuer can recall the
range accrual swap at a preﬁxed date, stop paying the coupons and return the prin-
cipal to the investor. A callable range accrual swap is a path-dependent swaption,
with the “ﬁxed” interest payment being stochastic. A callable range accrual swap
can be priced using the numerical methods discussed in this chapter.
The range accrual swap for interest rates has been studied in many books and
articles, such as by Navatte and Quittard-Pinon (1999) and Nunes (2004), using
the Gaussian Heath−Jarrow−Morton (HJM) framework; by Brigo and Mercurio
(2006), using the BGM-Jamshidian formulation; and by Jang and Yoon (2010),
with jump risk. The quantum ﬁnance formulation of the range accrual swap has
been studied by Baaquie et al. (2014b).
There are two reasons for studying the range accrual swap; the ﬁrst is that it is a
path-dependent derivative instrument and needs to be numerically priced; the earlier
discussion in Chapter 20 on simulation of Libor is further developed to analyze this
instrument. Second, the LMM as it stands can only price interest rate instruments
that are deﬁned on the Libor lattice. In pricing the range accrual swap, the LMM
has to be extended to the entire continuum semi-inﬁnite plane tx, which can only
be done by using the log Libor ﬁeld φ(t, x); the fact that the ﬁeld φ(t, x) is essential
for this extension shows that the ﬁeld φ(t, x) is more fundamental than L(t, Tn).
It is shown that the quantum formulation of LMM, discussed in Chapter 19,
can be extended to price the path-dependent range accrual swap. An approximate
price for the range accrual swap is obtained by linearizing the nonlinear Libor
drift. The price of accrual swap is evaluated by generating sample values of Libor
by simulation techniques discussed in Chapter 20. The numerical results on the
nonlinear behavior of the instrument are used for determining the range of validity
of the approximate linearized formula. This chapter is largely based on the results
obtained in Baaquie et al. (2014b).
Section 21.2 brieﬂy reviews LMM in quantum ﬁnance. In Sections 21.3 and 21.4
the range accrual swap is deﬁned in the mathematical framework of the quantum
LMM. In Section 21.5 we derive an analytical approximate formula for the price
of the range accrual swap. In Sections 21.6 and 21.7, we carry out a Monte Carlo
simulation to evaluate the price of the range accrual swap. In particular, we compare
the approximate analytical expression for the range accrual swap with simulation
results. We draw some conclusions in the ﬁnal Section 21.8.
21.2 Review of the Libor market model
The LMM has been discussed in Chapter 19, and the key results are reviewed for
ease of reading.
Recall that simple interest Libor L(t, Tn) is deﬁned on the Libor future time
lattice deﬁned by Tn = nℓ, where ℓis the Libor tenor. The Libor lattice is shown in

Figure 21.1; for ﬁxed tenor ℓLibor is only deﬁned on the Libor interval [Tn, Tn+1];
the shaded portion in Figure 21.1 shows all the Libors that exist for the Libor lattice.
Comparing Figures 21.1(a) and (b), it is seen that the wedge between the dotted
line in Figure 21.1(a) – which is the line of calendar time equal to future time – and
the heavy line grid lines does not have any Libor; this is the reason it is not shaded in
Figure 21.1(b). The range accrual swap precisely needs Libor in the empty wedge,
and it is discussed later how to extend the LMM to generate Libor for every point
in the wedge.

where γ (t, x) is the deterministic volatility. It is due to the deterministic volatility
γ that the LMM is well deﬁned. The correlation of the Gaussian ﬁeld A(t, x), from
Eq. 19.1.4, is given by
E[A(t, x)A(t′, x′)] = δ(t −t′)D(x, x′; t)
where D(x, x′; t) is the propagator.
Eq. 19.4.1 deﬁnes the logarithmic ﬁeld φ(t, x), which drives Libor interest rates,
as follows:

The total drift has a deterministic piece n(t, x) and a stochastic term ρn(t, x).
To ﬁnd its present value, all future cash ﬂows need to be discounted by a
numeraire – based on the prevailing interest rates and encoding the time value of
money. The forward bond numeraire is given by B(t, TI+1); for any Libor-based
ﬁnancial instrument F[L, t] the martingale condition states that
F[L, T0]
B(T0, TI+1) = EI
( F[L, Tn]
B(Tn, TI+1)
)
(21.2.2)
The subscript I is the symbol for the expectation value, namely EI[..], to indicate
that the expectation value is being taken over a stochastic process that has a martin-
gale evolution with respect to the numeraire B(t, TI+1).
The drift ρn(t, x) of the LMM is obtained by requiring the time evolution of all
Libor rates follow a martingale process with respect to the numeraire B(t, TI+1);
imposing the martingale condition yields, from Eq. 19.4.6, the following drift:

Note Eq. 21.2.3 deﬁnes the drift ρn(t, x) for x in the Libor lattice that Tn ≤x < Tn+1
for some n; as x takes values in different parts of the Libor lattice, the drift ρn(t, x)
also changes.
The quantum ﬁeld theory of the stochastic ﬁeld driving the interest rates is
deﬁned by a functional integral over all conﬁgurations of A(t, x). The partition

The interest rate swap deﬁned in Section 19.6 is generalized for the case of the
range accrual swap. For this reason, the usual swap and swaplets are reviewed
so that the more complex case can then be discussed. Swaps and swaptions are
discussed in Section 19.6, and the key ideas are reviewed below.
An interest rate swap is an agreement made today, to exchange two streams of
cash ﬂows at some future time. It is contracted between two parties in which party
A pays a ﬁxed interest rate RS and receives a ﬂoating rate determined by Libor (at
the future date), whereas party B pays a ﬂoating Libor and receives a ﬁxed rate;
Figure 19.3 schematically shows cash ﬂows for a swap at some future time.

582
Interest rate range accrual swap
Consider a swaplet that receives a single ﬂoating payment and pays at a ﬁxed
rate RS; the swaplet matures at time Tn and the ﬂoating rate is ﬁxed by the value
of the 90-day Libor, namely Libor L(Tn, Tn); both the ﬂoating and ﬁxed rate cash
ﬂows take place in arrears, at time Tn+1. For a sum of amount V, the value of the
swaplet, at present time T0, is equal to the future cash ﬂows – discounted by bond
B(T0, Tn+1) to present time and T0 and given by the following [Baaquie (2010)]:
SwapletL(T0, Rs) = ℓV B(T0, Tn+1)

L(T0, Tn) −Rs

(21.2.10)
A swap consists of a portfolio of swaplets, starting at Libor time T0; payments
are made at ﬁxed times Tn = T0 + nℓ, with n = 1, 2, ..., N −1; the ﬁrst payment
is made at T1 and the last payment at TN. The value at time T0 of the ﬂoating rate
receiver SwapL and ﬁxed rate receiver SwapR is

SwapL(T0, Rs) + SwapR(T0, Rs) = 0
(21.2.11)
Eq. 21.2.11 holds for any value of Rs and ensures that there are no arbitrage oppor-
tunities in the pricing of the swaps.
The par value Rp(T0) is deﬁned to make the initial values equal for ﬂoating rate
receiver SwapL and ﬁxed rate receiver SwapR; hence
SwapL(T0, Rp(T0)) = 0 = SwapR(T0, Rp(T0))
21.3 Range accrual swap
In a typical interest rate range accrual swap, the ﬁxed rate RS is not ﬁxed at the
start of the contract, but rather accrues contingent on a preselected Libor rate being
within a preﬁxed range [a, b] during a stipulated period preceding the payment. At
payment date, the payment fraction is ξRS where ξ =
κ
M and κ is the number of
days that the preselected Libor was in the range for the payment period; M is the
payment period of the individual swaplets. In this chapter, the payments are made
every M = 90 days and the 90-day Libor rate is tracked during this period to see
how many days it was within the prespeciﬁed range [a, b].
Consider Figure 21.2, where a single 90-day payment period is shown – from
calendar time Tn to the next payment time Tn+1. The Libor for the swaplet is
L(Tn, Tn) and is ﬁxed at time Tn; however, unlike a normal swap for which the

(21.3.1)
The horizontal lines indicate the 90-day Libor Lnk for calendar time Tn + tk.
The value of the 90-Libor is observed every day. In this way, it is determined for
how many days κ was the 90-day Libor Lnk in the preﬁxed range, as shown in
Figure 21.2. After 90 days, the rate for payment at time Tn+1 is ﬁxed to be
ξRS = κ
M · RS; M = 90 days
and the ﬂoating minus “ﬁxed” interest rate cash ﬂow is equal to L(Tn, Tn) −ξRS.

simplify the calculation of each swaplet. The discounted price of a swaplet, using
the numeraire B(Tn, TI+1), is a martingale and yields, from Eqs. 21.2.2 and 21.3.2,

Range accrual swap payoff function
Figure 21.4 shows the payoff function of the range accrual swap SwapA(T0, TN; a, b).
Each black dot in the ﬁgure represents a 90-day Libor L(Tn, Tm); the diagonal on
the edge is the line along which calendar time is equal to future time. All the
payments for each swaplet are made at one of the black dots on the diagonal line.
The line parallel to the edge diagonal indicates the 90-Libors that are observed
daily to determine how many days the 90-day Libor was in the prespeciﬁed range
[a, b]. The payoff function has a closure at future calendar time TN: the last accrual
swaplet
SwapletA(T0, TN−1; a, b)
is exercised at time TN−1 with the ﬁnal payments being made at TN.
The 90-day Libor Lnk being observed is indicated in Figure 21.4 by the horizontal
line with a circle; for time Tn+tk, the ﬁgure shows that the 90-day Libor Lnk consists
of a piece labeled 1 that starts at the diagonal edge, and then crosses the Libor lattice

at future time Tn+1, with the piece labeled 2 being the remaining part of the 90-day
Libor.
For pricing the range accrual swap, the values of the log Libor ﬁeld φ(t, x) have
to be determined for every point in the entire trapezoid. This will be clearer in
Section 21.6 where the simulation of the ﬁeld φ(t, x) is carried out for pricing the
accrual swap.
21.4 Extension of Libor drift
In terms of the log Libor ﬁeld, Libor Lnk deﬁned in Eq. 21.3.1 is given as follows:
ℓLnk ≡ℓL(Tn + tk, Tn + tk) = exp
 Tn+1+tk
Tn+tk
dx φ(Tn + tk, x)

(21.4.1)
Note that future time for Lnk does not lie on the Libor lattice, as given in
Figure 21.1, since it crosses Libor lattice at time Tn+1 – as shown in Figure 21.4.
At future time Tn + tk, all the Libor rates for the full Libor lattice interval [Tn, Tn+1]
no longer exist since the Libor rates for x < Tn + tk have expired.
As it stands, the Libor market model is only deﬁned for future time x lying in
a Libor lattice [Tm, Tm+1], where time Tm > t is in the future to calendar time
t; in particular, the drift in libor market Model is only deﬁned for φ(t, x) with
Tn < x ≤Tn+1. Comparing Figures 21.1 and 20.5 shows that the ﬁeld φ(t, x)

needs to be deﬁned in the wedge on the diagonal that does not have any Libor rates
on the Libor lattice.
Hence, the drift given in Eq. 21.2.3 for the quantum formulation of the LMM has
to be extended for deﬁning the evolution of φ(t, x) for x in the interval [Tn+tk, Tn+1].
For the rolling numeraire, take I = n in the numeraire B(t, TI+1); from Eq. 21.2.3,
the stochastic drift ρn(t, x) of Libor rate for Tn ≤x < Tn+1 is zero and is nonzero
for Tn+1 ≤x < Tn+2. Hence
ρn(t, x) =
 0,
x ∈[Tn, Tn+1]
̸= 0,
x ∈[Tn+1, Tn+2]
The stochastic drift for the range of Tn ≤x < Tn+2 is shown in Figure 21.5.
For the range of future time Tn + tk ≤x < Tn+1, it follows from the discussion
above that the stochastic drift ρn(t, x) is zero. Hence, to extend the LMM so that
it can price instruments such as the range accrual swap, we need to deﬁne the
deterministic drift n(t, x) for Tn + tk ≤x < Tn+1.
Since Tn +tk does not lie on the Libor lattice, the deﬁnition of deterministic drift
n(t, x) is extended by changing the lower limit of the integration (which deﬁnes
the deterministic drift) to a new lower limit of Tn + tk.
The evolution equation for φ(t, x), due to the existence of the wedge, has the
following two parts, which is shown in Figure 21.5:

Eq. 21.4.2 represents the extension of the LMM beyond the Libor lattice and
Eq. 21.4.3 follows from the deﬁnition of drift given in Eq. 21.2.3. Figure 21.5
shows the shaded portion, for which the drift (II), ρ2 is ﬁxed by the drift given by
Eq. 21.2.3; for the unshaded portion, the stochastic drift in Eq. 21.4.2 is zero and
the deterministic drift (I) is deﬁned by extending the deﬁnition of drift beyond the
Libor lattice. This extension of the drift (I) allows one to uniquely deﬁne φ(t, x)
for all x ≥t; the extended LMM can price any interest rate instrument, including
the range accrual swap.
The LMM has the initial condition speciﬁed at initial time T0. The market ﬁxes
all L(T0, Tn) – is shown in Figure 21.6 – from which one can extract all the loga-

21.5 Approximate price of range accrual swap
The term ρII(t, x) in Eq. 21.4.3 makes Lnk depend nonlinearly on the quantum ﬁeld
A(t, x). The volatility expansion for Libor drift was studied in Baaquie (2010). One
can expand Lnk as a power series in the volatility γ (t, x), with the leading term
yielding a linear theory for Lnk, and which in turn leads to an approximate analytic
expression for the accrual swap.
The volatility approximation is based on approximating the stochastic drift of
the LMM by a deterministic drift – justiﬁed by the fact that ρII(t, x) ≈ρII(T0, x) +
O(γ (t, x)). This approximation yields an expansion in φ(t) −φ(T0) = O(γ (t, x)),
which is a small quantity. Hence
eφ(t)
1 + eφ(t) =
eφ(T0)
1 + eφ(T0) +
eφ(t) −eφ(T0)
(1 + eφ(t))(1 + eφ(T0))
≃
eφ(T0)
1 + eφ(T0) + O(γ (t, x))
(21.5.1)
and this leads to the following linearization:

Interest rate range accrual swap
21.6 Simulation of range accrual swap
To evaluate the price of the accrual swap, one needs to generate sample values of
the Libor Lnk. To do so, one needs to start with the initial values of Libor L(T0, Tn),
given by the market, and extract from the market Libor the initial value of the log
Libor rates φ(T0, x) for all T0 ≤x ≤TN+1. The numerical algorithm is then used to
generate the sample values of Lnk, as shown in Figure 21.7, by simulating sample
values of φ(t, x) with t > t0.
Suppose the present Libor interest rate is ℓL(T0, Tn) = exp{
 Tn+ℓ
Tn
dxφ0(T0, x)}.
At time T, where T > T0, the log Libor, from Eq. 19.4.11, is given by
φ(T, x) = φ(T0, x) +
 T

dt

−1
2(t, x) + ρ(t, x) + γ (t, x)A(t, x)

In the Monte Carlo simulation, the log Libor rates φ(t, x) are updated on a
discrete time lattice. Both calendar time and future time are deﬁned on a lattice,
shown in Figure 21.7(a), with interval of ϵ = 1 day and yields
t →t = T0 + nϵ; x →x = T0 + mϵ
(21.6.1)
The updating process for φ, from Eq. 19.4.11, is given by

As shown in Figure 21.7(a), the values of φ(t, x) are updated in steps of ϵ,
indicated by horizontal lines, until one generates the values of φ(Tn+Tk, x) required
for obtaining a sample value of Lnk.
The ﬁrst updating generates sample values of L01, with T0 + ϵ = T0 + t1, since
tk = kϵ; that is, for n = 0, k = 1, and is shown in Figure 21.7(b). The algorithm
yields

Figure 21.7(b). The drift, from Eqs. 21.4.2 and 21.4.3, has the following deﬁnition:

Figure 21.8 shows a typical conﬁguration for Libor generated by the simulation.
The value for volatility was taken to be 50 × γm – where γm is the market volatility
of Libor – to magnify the effect of the barrier crossings.
In the simulation, the price of the accrual swaplet is obtained by evaluating the
average of the payoff for the sample conﬁgurations. The algorithm developed in
Chapter 20 and the simulation of Libor given in Eq. 20.3.8 yields

21.7 Numerical results and errors
The starting date T0 is 0, and T1 is set to be 90 days for the ﬁrst settlement. The
initial 90-day Libor at T0 is L(T0, T0) = 0.0269 and the accrual range is set as
(0.020, 0.030); in the simulation, ϵ = 1 day.
Figure 21.9 shows the jump in the drift across a Libor lattice time. This is to
be expected since on the diagonal edge, for a swaplet(Tn, Tn; a, b), the drift for
x < Tn+1 is deterministic whereas the drift for x > Tn+1 is a sum of deterministic
and stochastic terms.

difference when γ = 25∗γm but still can be acceptable in practice with the absolute
error under 2%. The approximate result tends to have large errors with simulation
when γ = 50 ∗γm and γ = 100 ∗γm, as in Figure 21.10(c) and (d).

The approximation fails to give an accurate for volatility greater than γ = 25 ∗γm,
as expected.
The range accrual swap price, as a function of ﬁxed leg RS, is plotted in
Figure 21.11(b). The par value of accrual swap R′
P shows a larger value compared
with the normal interest rate swap RP. The par value shows the utility of the range
accrual swap, since one is effectively paying a much smaller value for the ﬂoating
leg if the market becomes very volatile; and hence, in effect, one is receiving a
higher ﬁxed leg if the market is very volatile.
21.8 Summary
The objective of this chapter was to price the interest rate range accrual swaps
based on the formalism of quantum ﬁnance. The deﬁnition of the payoff function
for the accrual swap required the employment of the logarithmic interest rates given
by φ(t, x). The Libor market model deﬁned for the Libor lattice was extended
to accommodate the payoff of the range accrual swap, and this in turn was only
possible because the pricing was obtained using the logarithmic ﬁeld φ(t, x); unlike
Libor L(T, Tn), which is only deﬁned for the Libor lattice, φ(t, x) is deﬁned for the
continuous domain deﬁned by t ≥T0, x ≥t.
An approximate formula was obtained for the range accrual swap by linearizing
the nonlinear drift of the LMM. The Libor rates were studied numerically by using

a simulation for updating the daily Libor. The simulation showed that the approx-
imate price provides an excellent approximation when the Libor volatility γm is
taken from the market and that the approximate accrual swap formula fails only
for very high volatility, which one does not expect for normal market conditions.
The par value of the range accrual swap can be computed accurately using the
approximate formula and opens the way for empirically studying the pricing of
range accrual swaps.

Two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics
Two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics – also called the Schwinger model –
consists of the massless electron quantum ﬁeld coupled to the massless photon
ﬁeld in two spacetime dimensions. It is a simple model to start the analysis of
interacting quantum ﬁelds. Although the theory is formally nonlinear, a careful
analysis reveals that it can in fact be treated as two free ﬁelds, with the electron
contributing a mass term to the photon ﬁeld. Since the theory is linear, many exact
results can be derived, from the breaking of chiral symmetry to the generation of
mass for the photon.
The Schwinger model exhibits many features, such as the conﬁnement of the
fundamental fermions, which is expected to occur in quantum chromodynamics but
is difﬁcult to demonstrate due to the complexity of the four-dimensional quantum
ﬁelds.
22.1 Introduction
Free quantum ﬁelds can be reduced to studying only a ﬁnite number of degrees of
freedom. The study of free quantum ﬁelds is a preparation for studying interacting
quantum ﬁelds, which in general have inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom.
One of the simplest interacting quantum ﬁeld theories is massless quantum electro-
dynamics in two dimensions: the theory of massless fermions coupled to photons
in two spacetime dimensions. Studying the Schwinger model is a preparation for
analyzing more complicated nonlinear quantum ﬁeld theories.
An intriguing and far-reaching result is that although one starts off by having
a Lagrangian composed of the electron and photon degrees of freedom, but due
to the nature of the interaction the spectrum of states for the interacting theory
exhibits the presence of only massive bosons – no pure fermionic states and no pure
gauge ﬁeld states. Hence, although one starts with massless fermions and bosons,
601

Two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics
interaction results in the permanent conﬁnement of the fermions, with the electrons
only appearing in bound states and hence having boson statistics.
The Schwinger model can be solved exactly and is a model that exhibits
many non-perturbative features that one expects in four-dimensional quantum
ﬁeld theories. Some of these are the following.
• The Schwinger model is a simple model for studying chiral symmetry breaking
and fermion conﬁnement, which are features of the vastly more complicated four-
dimensional quantum chromodyamics.
• The model spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry of the theory. The axial
vector current that is classically conserved is not conserved after quantization.
• The breaking of chiral symmetry generates a mass for the gauge ﬁeld.
• The model exhibits conﬁnement of the fundamental fermions: the eigenstates of
the interacting theory do not have any fermions.
• The Wilson loop is evaluated exactly to examine if it is the appropriate order
parameter for conﬁnement of the fundamental fermions.
Many solutions take the approach of Schwinger (1962) that consists of using
the ﬁeld equations with a suitably regularized gauge-invariant current to solve the
model [Lowenstein and Swieca (1971); Hetrick et al. (1995)]. The model has been
studied using Feynman diagrams [Falck and Kramer (1988)] and in a background
electric ﬁeld [Coleman (1976)]. The solution discussed in this chapter is based on
the path integral [Baaquie (1982)].
The action is regularized in a manner that preserves gauge invariance. Note that
there is no need to introduce a cutoff since the theory is super-renormalizable. The
gauge ﬁeld is the decomposed into the sum of gauge-invariant and gauge-variant
pieces. The gauge-variant piece is removed by a gauge transformation and the
coupling of the fermions to the gauge-invariant piece is regularized. The fermion
path integral is performed to all orders in perturbation theory using the axial-vector
current anomaly [Bell and Jackiw (1969); Adler (1969)].
The conﬁnement criterion for the interacting theory is studied using the Wilson
loop integral [Wilson (1974)], which shows the exp(-area) dependence for the pure
gauge ﬁeld but not for the interacting theory. The behavior of the Wilson loop for
the interacting theory is explained by studying the eigenstates of the Schwinger
model [Baaquie (1983)].
22.2 Euclidean action
The model is deﬁned in two-dimensional Euclidean spacetime. The Euclidean
action, from Eq. 8.4.2, is deﬁned for two-dimensional spacetime using two-
component spinors ψ and ¯ψ and gauge ﬁeld Aμ. The action is given by

and the fermions completely decouple from the gauge ﬁeld.
The classical symmetry of gauge invariance is preserved on quantizing the
fermion and gauge ﬁeld degrees of freedom, but it turns out that the classical chiral
symmetry of the theory is broken. The reason is that the short-distance ﬂuctuations,
which are absent in the classical theory, are fundamental for quantum ﬁelds and do
not respect chiral symmetry.
The Feynman path integral for the theory is formally given by
Z =

DAD ¯ψDψeS
The partition function is divergent due to gauge invariance, and a gauge needs to
be chosen to have a well-deﬁned theory. It is most suitable to work in the Landau
gauge, discussed earlier in Section 9.8, given by
∂μAμ = 0
(22.2.12)
The action is gauge invariant and one needs to evaluate the counterterm for the
Landau gauge; the derivation in Section 9.6 is summarized below for complete-
ness. Let
s = ∂μAμ; s(ζ) = ∂μAμ(ζ) = ∂μAμ + ∂2ζ
Hence, from Eq. 9.6.1,

The gauge ﬁeld is decomposed as follows:1
Aμ(x) = ϵμν∂νs(x) + ∂μϕ(x)
(22.2.16)
where ϵμν is the antisymmetric tensor and s(x) and ϕ(x) are pseudoscalar and scalar
ﬁelds, respectively. Using Eq. 22.2.16 yields
Fμν = −ϵμν∂2s; ϵμνFμν = −2∂2s
(22.2.17)
Note that s(x) is gauge invariant and ϕ(x) is gauge dependent. Using Eq. 22.2.16
gives

(22.2.18)
yields
S1 = −

x
( ¯ψ∂ψ + i ¯ψγμψϵμν∂νs)
(22.2.19)
In eliminating the ﬁeld φ(x), no gauge was chosen for the gauge ﬁeld; the only
restriction is that one can evaluate only gauge-invariant expectation values for the
fermions and gauge ﬁeld, since only these quantities are independent of φ(x).
However, for the quantum theory it is not sufﬁcient for the degree of freedom φ(x)
to decouple from the action. The path integral also has to be convergent, and for
this it has to be gauge-ﬁxed – since otherwise the functional integral

Dφ will lead
to a divergent partition function.
Given the ansatz for Aμ given in Eq. 22.2.16, the path integral measure has the
following transformation for every spacetime point x:
( dA0
dA1
)
=
(
∂2
∂1
−∂1
∂2
) ( ds
dφ
)
≡J
( ds

)
Hence, the measure transforms as
DA = DA0DA1 = det(J )DsDφ = det(∂2)DsDφ
From Eq. 22.2.15
Z = det(∂2) det(∂2)

DsDφD ¯ψDψδ(∂2φ)eS[s, ¯ψ,ψ]

1 In ﬂuid mechanics, ϕ is the velocity potential and s is the stream function.

606

since
det(∂2)

Dφδ(∂2φ) = 1
Eq. 22.2.20 is the starting point for the analysis of the ﬁnite time path integral
discussed later. For the inﬁnite time path integral, det(∂2) is a constant and can be
dropped; hence, in the following sections the starting point of the analysis is the
following path integral:
Z =

DsD ¯ψDψeS[s, ¯ψ,ψ]
(22.2.21)
22.3 Point-split regularization
The action is regularized by point-splitting the fermions that constitute the axial-
vector current. The point-split axial current has to be an averaged over all possible
angles to recover spherical symmetry. This averaging requires that the matrices γ
and ∂μs are also projected in the direction in which the fermions are point-split.
Pick an arbitrary direction θ in the two-dimensional plane. Let ˆe1 and ˆe2 be the unit
basis vectors deﬁning the operator ∂; deﬁne
ˆe1(θ) = cos θ ˆe1 + sin θ ˆe2
ˆe2(θ) = −sin θ ˆe1 + cos θ ˆe2
(22.3.1)
and
γμ(θ) = ˆeμ(θ) · γ
∂μ(θ) = ˆeμ(θ) · ∂
(22.3.2)
Note

μ
γμ(θ)∂μ(θ) =

μ
γμ∂μ; γ5(θ) = γ5
and
{γμ(θ), γν(θ)} = 2δμν
(22.3.3)
Let a be an inﬁnitesimal number; then the (point-split) regularized action is
deﬁned by
S1[s, a, θ] = −

x
 ¯ψx∂ψx + ¯ψxγμ(θ)γ5ψx+aeμ(θ)∂μ(θ)s(x)
.
(22.3.4)
The regularization of the axial current does not generate any gauge-dependent
terms for the boson sector since the ﬁeld s(x) is gauge invariant; however, this
regularization does not respect gauge invariance for the fermion–boson coupling

it is shown by Baaquie (1982) that complete gauge invariance is recovered for the
fermions in the limit a →0.
There is no reason for putting the line integral exp

between the
point-split fermions as it would not restore gauge invariance for the fermions.
The quantum ﬁeld theory is deﬁned by the Feynman path integral of eS over all
values of the fermions and the gauge ﬁeld; in the Landau gauge, from Eq. 22.2.21,
the path integral is given by
Z =

DsD ¯ψDψeSB[s]+S1[s,a,θ]
where some (inﬁnite and irrelevant) constants have been ignored.
The path integral over the fermion ﬁeld is performed, giving
eS′[s,a,θ] =

For a ̸= 0, performing the local chiral transformation as given in Eq. 22.2.10 can
no longer decouple the fermions from the gauge ﬁeld – unlike the result obtained
in Eq. 22.2.11. Hence, the coupling of the gauge ﬁeld to the fermions is via the
anomaly in the axial current, and the regularization of the axial current shows this.
If one carries out the chiral rotations after setting a = 0, the fermions apparently
decouple from the gauge ﬁeld in the Lagrangian as in Eq. 22.2.11. However, the
chiral anomaly reappears since the fermion integration measure is not invariant
under a chiral rotation, as has been discussed by Fujikawa (1984).

¯η(x)M−1(x, y)η(y) −1

(22.4.19)
It can easily be veriﬁed that
M−1(x, y) = es(x)γ5G(x −y)es(y)γ5
(22.4.20)
The form of F[¯η, η] shows that by performing the local chiral rotation on the
fermions as given by Eq. 22.2.10, the fermions are effectively decoupled from
the gauge ﬁeld and behave like free massless fermions. The regulator affects only
det M, with M−1 not requiring a regulator.
As an example of the effect of the regulator, the propagator for the gauge-
invariant fermion–antifermion state is calculated. Using the bra and ket notation, as
in Eq. 22.3.7, yields
K(x) = E[ ¯ψxψx ¯ψ0ψ0]c = E[ ¯ψxe2s(x)γ5ψx ¯ψ0e2s(0)γ5ψ0]c

The cluster decomposition for ¯ψψ is violated since K(x) does not go to zero expo-
nentially for large x but, instead, tends to a constant; this is taken to indicate the
breakdown of chiral symmetry for the vacuum state of the interacting quantum
ﬁeld. The exact result obtained in Eq. 22.4.23 has been used for verifying numerical
studies of the Schwinger model by Marinari et al. (1981).

Eq. 22.5.4 shows that the expectation value of the axial current is proportional to
the gauge ﬁeld; this effect is nonclassical and due to the singularity of the fermion
propagator going as 1/a, which cancels an otherwise vanishing term a∂μ(θ)s(x).

Eq. 22.5.5 shows that the chiral current j5
μ(x) is not conserved and leads to
non-conservation of the chiral charge. Hence, chiral symmetry is broken. The
singularity of the fermion propagator is the result of short-distance quantum
ﬂuctuations. Symmetry breaking in this case arises from quantum ﬂuctuations
and is not due to a classical phase transition.

(22.5.7)
Chiral anomaly breaks conservation of the axial-vector current but leaves the con-
servation of the vector current intact. This is the reason why the vector-current Ward
identities are preserved in the limit a →0.
22.6 Wilson loop integral
The Wilson loop was introduced as a criterion for the conﬁnement of quarks
[Wilson (1974)]. The Wilson loop depends only on the topology of the manifold
and is independent of the geometry of the underlying manifold. Witten (1989)
showed that the expectation value of Wilson loops in three-dimensional Chern–
Simons Euclidean gauge ﬁeld theory yields the Jones polynomials, which arise in
the classiﬁcation of knots and links.
The Wilson loop is evaluated exactly for the Schwinger model and its behav-
ior depends on the coupling of the theory, exhibiting the “area law” of decaying
exponentially as the area of the loop for pure gauge ﬁelds and depending on the
perimeter of the loop for large coupling.
Let C denote a circular contour of radius L that encloses the (unique) area ,
shown in Figure 22.4. The Wilson loop integral is deﬁned by the gauge ﬁeld as
follows:

function of L and has the following asymptotic behavior:
lim
L→∞W ∼
 −L2,
g2 = 0
−L,
g2 > 0
(22.6.2)
Eq. 22.6.2 shows that for g > 0, the large gauge ﬁeld loops are not suppressed as
exp(-area), whereas for g2 = 0 they do show the area behavior. The question arises:
What is the connection between the Wilson loop integral and conﬁnement in the
presence of fermions?
The following interpretation is consistent with the results obtained in Eq. 22.6.2.
If the loop integral show exp(-area) behavior for the pure gauge ﬁeld (no coupling
to fermions, i.e., g2 = 0), then, when this gauge ﬁeld is coupled to the fermions,
the fermions are conﬁned. In this interpretation of the loop integral, one does not
expect exp(-area) behavior in the presence of fermions; since it is “known” that the
fermions are conﬁned in the Schwinger model, the above interpretation is consistent
with the results of this model.
22.7 Energy eigenvalues
The energy eigenvalues of the Schwinger model are exactly evaluated; due to a non-
trivial cancellation the fermion eigenvalues are eliminated. The eigenspectrum of
the interacting theory reduces to that of a free massive boson ﬁeld. The energy of the
fermion–string–antifermion state and the string tension can be exactly evaluated.
The relation of the string tension to the Wilson criterion of conﬁnement for the case
of the interacting theory is analyzed. The discussion is based on Baaquie (1983).
Let H be the Hamiltonian operator for Schwinger QED, En the eigenenergies,
and |!n⟩the orthonormal eigenfunctions. That is,
⟨!n|H|!m⟩= Enδnm
(22.7.1)
Fermion eigenfunctions using anticommuting variables have been discussed in
Baaquie (2014).

e−τEn
(22.7.2)
where the sum is over all the eigenenergies. The time τ plays the role of inverse
temperature and Z(τ) can be evaluated using ﬁnite-temperature methods [Kapusta
(1993)].
To evaluate Z(τ), consider the ﬁnite-time action for Schwinger QED in a two-
dimensional Euclidean space, with the boson (fermion) variables being periodic
(antiperiodic) with period τ. In effect the ﬁeld theory is deﬁned on a cylinder of
inﬁnite length.
The ﬁnite-time Euclidean action is deﬁned using the two-component spinors
¯ψ,ψ and the gauge ﬁeld Aμ, and with the coupling constant g. The notation S
is used for the ﬁnite time action and the difference from the inﬁnite time action will
be clear from the context. Similar to the inﬁnite time action given in Eq. 22.2.1,
deﬁne the ﬁnite time action by the following:

The boundary conditions for bosons are periodic in the time direction and
antiperiodic for the fermions. This gives
Aμ(t, x) = Aμ(t + τ, x)
(22.7.3)
ψ(t, x) = −ψ(t + τ, x);

The determinant of ∂2 is deﬁned on functions periodic in t with period τ, as in
Section 9.7. As in Eq. 22.2.16, consider the change of variables for ﬁnite time:
Aμ = ϵμν∂νs + ∂μφ
The Landau gauge completely eliminates the ﬁeld φ by setting it to zero in the path
integral. Similar to Eq. 22.2.9, the action is given by

The calculation of Section 22.4 is repeated for performing the ﬁnite time fermion
path integration. To evaluate the fermion path integral, note that the ﬁnite-time
fermion propagator is given by [Kapusta (1993)]
Gτ(t, x) =
1
(γμ∂μ)
+∞

n=−∞
einπδ(t −nτ)δ(x) =

n=−∞
einπG(t −nτ, x)
where, from Eq. 22.3.8
G(t, x) = 1
2π
tγ0 + xγ1
x2 + t2
Hence, for t2 + x2 = a2 →0
Gτ(t, x) = G(t, x) + O(a)
(22.7.8)
which shows that the short-distance behavior of Gτ is the same as the τ = ∞case.
As in Section 22.3, the regularization of the action is done by point-splitting the
axial-vector current ¯ψγμγ5ψ∂μs. The only property of the fermion propagator that
enters in the calculation is zero-distance behavior of the fermion propagator, which
is unchanged for ﬁnite time as in Eq. 22.7.8.
The ﬁnite time fermion path integral is evaluated; the point-split regularization
is not written explicitly as the result derived earlier in Section 22.4 is used. For
ﬁnite time, from the result for fermion integration given in Eq. 9.14.9, the partition
function is given by

To perform the boson integration, the redundant integration over φ is dropped
(which is equivalent to choosing the Landau gauge), and4

22.8 Gauge-invariant states
621
The eigenspectrum is the equally spaced energy levels of the free massive boson
ﬁeld. The integers np denote the number of particles np with momentum p that have
been created in the system. These massive excitations of the ﬁeld are the bound
states of the fermion–antifermion pair interacting via the gauge ﬁeld.
There are no pure gauge ﬁeld eigenstates, implying that the gauge ﬁeld can be
only be implied from its effect on the fermions. In contrast, for four-dimensional
quantum chromodynamics, one expects the quantum ﬁeld theory to have pure gauge
ﬁeld eigenstates.
The eigenfunctions of the interacting theory are
|!n⟩≡⊗p|np⟩with eigenenergy

p
np(p2 + m2)1/2
and form a complete basis for the Fock–Hilbert space of states for a two-dimensional
quantum ﬁeld theory, discussed earlier in Section 7.3.
The fermion-like eigenenergies have been eliminated from the spectrum due to
its interaction with the gauge ﬁeld, and the cancellation in Eq. 22.7.15 reﬂects this.
The absence of fermionic energy eigenstates is an indication that the fermions are
permanently conﬁned.
22.8 Gauge-invariant states
Consider a fermion–gauge ﬁeld–antifermion state that is gauge invariant. Before
calculating the energetics of this state, the deﬁnition of energy for a ﬁeld theory is
brieﬂy reviewed.
Recall from quantum mechanics the energy of an unnormalized state |!⟩is
given by
E = ⟨!|H|!⟩
⟨!|!⟩
(22.8.1)
where H is the Hamiltonian. To use the above deﬁnition for a quantum ﬁeld, a
suitable limiting procedure has to be used since the states are generally not normal-
izable. Also, in the path integral framework, the Hamiltonian is derived from the
action functional.
Let |χϵ⟩be a state close to |!⟩such that
lim
ϵ→0 |χϵ⟩= |!⟩
Then
E = lim
ϵ→0
⟨χ|H|!⟩
⟨χ|!⟩
= lim
ϵ→0
(
lim
t→0 −∂
∂t
⟨χ|e−tH|!⟩
⟨χ|!⟩
)
The amplitude ⟨χ| exp(−tH)|!⟩can be evaluated using the path integral, and hence
the energy can be obtained using Eq. 22.8.2.

The expression for energy is exact and is a gauge-invariant quantity. The energy of
the fermion–antifermion state given in Eq. 22.8.4 increases linearly with distance,
and the string tension – deﬁned as the energy per unit length – is given by g2/2.
It is obvious that the state |!⟩is not an eigenstate, given its complicated time
dependence. To understand how the state |!⟩is constructed, we expand it in the
energy eigenfunction basis. Let

In obtaining Eq. 22.8.5 only the leading-order terms in mL have been kept and in
effect this disregards the eigenfunctions with nonzero momentum p. This is the
static approximation, and a detailed study shows that this approximation has all the
leading-order effects.

Figure 22.7 Eigenfunction expansion of the gauge-invariant fermion–antifermion
state.
The state |!⟩is peaked at the state |N⟩, with integer N = α, and has a spread of
2α – which gives rise to the large dispersion for E.
Identifying the eigenstates |N⟩as N pairs of fermion–antifermion bound states,
we have the interpretation of Eq. 22.8.7 that the excited gauge invariant state is,
with the largest amplitude, a state of N ∼mL pairs. That is, for large L the gauge
string “breaks” instantaneously into a number of pairs proportional to the length of
the string. See Figure 22.7.
Hence, viewing the state |!⟩as a case where the quarks (fermions) are well sep-
arated in an attempt to see the single fermion will end up with the observation of the
bound-state pairs and not the isolated fermion. Once the fermions constituting the
gauge-invariant state are separated by a distance larger than m−1, pair production
takes place. Hence one can conclude that the fermions are permanently conﬁned
within a distance of m−1, and no isolated single fermion can be seen for separations
much larger than m−1.
This view of string breakup has been discussed by other authors, and the
Schwinger model provides a quantitative basis for this.
22.9 String tension and fermion conﬁnement
String tension μ is deﬁned as the change in the energy of the string when the length
is varied.
That is,
μ = ∂E
∂L
where E is the energy and L the length of the string. For the gauge-invariant
fermion–antifermion state |!⟩, Eq. 22.8.4 yields
μ = g2
2
The connection of μ with the Wilson loop integral can now be obtained. Consider
a square contour of length L and width t and with enclosed area  as shown in
Figure 22.8. Similar to Eq. 22.6.1, the Wilson loop is given by

Performing the bosonic path integral yields the exact result
W = exp[R(t, L) + R(L, t)]
where R(t, L) is given by Eq. 22.8.3. The result obtained for W exactly incorporates
the contribution of both the gauge ﬁeld and fermions and gives an insight into how
permanent conﬁnement occurs for fermions due to the properties of the gauge ﬁeld.
For large loops and large time, the Wilson loop is given by
W = exp
(
−g2
2m(t + L) + O(e−mt, e−mL)
)
W does not have exp(-area) Wilson behavior, and the string tension μ cannot be
extracted as the coefﬁcient of the area term. The reason for this is the string breaks
into (t+L) pairs and gives the exp(-perimeter) behavior for the loop; in other words,
fermion pair creation removes the Wilson area law behavior for the loop.
The Wilson loop in the absence of the fermions can be obtained by setting m = 0
in R(t, L), and yields the exact result
W = exp
(
−g2
2 tL
)
= exp [−μtL]
The string tension is the coefﬁcient of the area term. Hence μ can be obtained by
studying the large gauge-ﬁeld loops in the absence of fermions, and the introduction
of fermions does not change the value of μ, at least in Schwinger QED. Note that
in the presence of the fermions, for small loops, given by, t, L ≪1, one again has
W ∼= exp[−μtL + O(t2, L2)]
Hence, the following is the picture for conﬁnement in Schwinger QED: The small
gauge-ﬁeld loops show the Wilson exp(-area) behavior. As the loops are made

larger and larger, due to the Wilson behavior of the pure gauge loops, a large energy
is required to make these loops, and instead the system produces fermion–
antifermion pairs, breaking the string and giving the exp(-perimeter) behavior.
The string breaks, i.e., crosses over from the area to perimeter behavior at the
characteristic length scale of the system, which for Schwinger QED is m−1. See
Figure 22.9.
In summary, the behavior of the large gauge-ﬁeld loops in the pure gauge theory
determines whether or not there is conﬁnement of the fundamental fermions, and
the Wilson criterion is appropriate. However, in the presence of fermions, con-
ﬁnement can be equally studied by looking at the energy of the fermion–string–
antifermion state, which involves looking at the short-time behavior of the system.
Both these approaches can be used for evaluating the string tension and give the
same result in Schwinger QED.
22.10 Summary
A major advantage of the Schwinger model is that it can be exactly solved. The
breaking of the classical chiral symmetry by the nonconservation of the axial cur-
rent was shown to be the result of short-distance singularities, arising from quantum
ﬂuctuations, that render ﬁnite terms that are vanishingly small in the classical the-
ory. The model was solved exactly using a point-split current, and shows that the
axial-current anomaly is responsible for generating the mass term for the boson
ﬁeld.
One result, which is unexpected, is that the degrees of freedom that are used for
deﬁning the Lagrangian, namely the fermion and gauge ﬁeld, are not present in the
observable excitations of the quantum ﬁelds. Instead, an entirely new construct,
given by the bound state of fermions, appears in the spectrum of states. This feature
shows that Feynman perturbation theory, which in this case takes free fermions
and gauge ﬁeld to the starting point, is misleading and cannot represent the theory
accurately. In fact, the Schwinger model is a leading example in understanding
how and why quarks are permanently conﬁned inside the nucleus for quantum
chromodynamics.

628
Two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics
The Wilson loop integral was evaluated exactly for the interacting theory. In
the presence of fermions, the loop integral breaks due to the creation of fermion–
antifermion pairs, and does not show the area-law dependence that one associates
with conﬁnement of fermions. A detailed study of the eigenstates, however, con-
ﬁrms that there are no fermionic eigenstates for the interacting theory, and leads to
the conclusion that there is permanent conﬁnement of the fermions. The interacting
theory indicates conﬁnement according to the Wilson criterion if one takes the area
law for small loops as indicating the onset of conﬁnement and large loops indicating
the breaking of the loop by fermion pair creation.

Bosonic string theory
23.1 Logic of superstrings
A leading candidate for the uniﬁcation of the quantum principle of indetermi-
nacy with gravity is superstring theory. One of the main applications of quantum
ﬁeld theory is to superstring theory. The discussion on the bosonic string theory
shows the continuity of ideas from quantum ﬁeld theory in spanning a great variety
of subjects, ranging from high energy physics and statistical physics to mathe-
matics, ﬁnance and all the way to superstring theory. The discussion on super-
strings is conﬁned to only the bosonic string, as is appropriate for an introductory
discussion.
An important lesson from the study of bosonic string theory is that Gaussian
quantum ﬁelds continue to be important even in a completely new subject.
Furthermore, in superstring theory the focus on four-dimensional spacetime is
replaced by quantum ﬁeld theories deﬁned on two-dimensional manifolds. Two-
dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory also forms the bedrock of its applications to
economics and ﬁnance.
A popular and nontechnical explanation of the key ideas of superstring theory is
given by Baaquie and Willeboordse (2015). The following are some of the salient
features of superstring theory.
• Superstrings are all relativistic quantum superstrings and are based on the quan-
tum principle of indeterminacy. In particular, the necessity of going to 26 space-
time dimensions for the purely bosonic string and 10 spacetime dimensions for
superstrings is a direct result of the consistency between the quantum principle
and the special theory of relativity.
• There is currently no empirical evidence for the existence of superstrings.
• Even from the theoretical point of view, the “correct” superstring theory has not
yet been found.

• The different open and closed superstring theories in various dimensions are all
related to each other; this reﬂects an expectation that all the different superstring
theories are representations of the still sought-for single underlying superstring
theory.
Superstring theory is based on two key notions. First, a uniﬁed theory needs
to be supersymmetric, and second, more radically, that the point particles of the
Standard Model need to be generalized to one-dimensional relativistic quantum
objects called strings.
A one-dimensional string extends mass (energy) into a line – as opposed to
local quantum ﬁelds that have all the mass of particles existing at a single point,
as illustrated in Figure 23.1. The price to be paid for this extension of mass at a
point to a string greatly increases the number of independent degrees of freedom
(variables) – and creates new problems of mathematical consistency.
The strings in superstring theory can be of two types: open (ends do not connect)
or closed (the string forms a loop) as illustrated in Figure 23.2. Superstrings are
massless and the endpoints of the open superstring are traveling at the speed of
light. Similar to a point particle tracing out a world line as it evolves in time, a
string spans out a world sheet as it evolves.
Open and closed superstrings are part of a number of different but related super-
string theories and it is important to keep in mind that not all physically relevant
features have been found in the different theories. However, clear relationships

between the theories have been found and it is hoped that in the end a well-deﬁned
and comprehensive theory will emerge such that the current theories are its different
limits.
All the fermions and gauge ﬁelds (forces) of the Standard Model arise as
excitations of the underlying superstring, and spacetime itself is the manifes-
tation of one of the vibrational modes of the superstring. Superstring resolves
the problems of mathematical consistency of a quantum theory of gravity by
showing that closed superstrings generate the gravitational ﬁeld as the low energy
limit.
Consider a circle – a loop – as shown in Figure 23.3(a). The loop has a coordinate
σ that speciﬁes the different points of the circle. Since the loop is periodic, the
coordinate is also periodic with σ ∈[0, 2π]. Although spacetime itself emerges
from the dynamics of superstring theory, to simplify the discussion, consider the
closed loop to be in a 10-dimensional spacetime (9 space and 1 time dimension);
what this means is that the circle is taken to lie in 9-dimensional space and has a
time coordinate t, as illustrated in Figure 23.3(b). As the string propagates in time,
it spans out a world sheet, shown in Figure 23.4, and with coordinates of the world
sheet given by t, σ.
Let Xμ, μ = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9 be the position of the loop in 10-dimensional
spacetime; each point of the loop then has a coordinate given by Xμ(t, σ). Depend-
ing on the excitation, a closed superstring can be either a boson or a fermion.
The bosonic component of the superstring can be directly represented by the
coordinate Xμ(t, σ), while the fermion component is a spin 1/2 fermion on the
string’s world sheet, and its degrees of freedom are given by a two-component
spinor

23.2 Introduction to open strings
Since the string is an extended object, the evolution of a string spans out a
two-dimensional world sheet embedded in d-dimensional spacetime, as shown
in Figure 23.4. The degrees of freedom of the string on the world sheet constitute a
two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory and the techniques developed so far can be
applied to the study of this quantum ﬁeld theory. The approach of Polyakov (1987)
is adopted for studying the covariant bosonic string path integral.
The bosonic string theory is invariant under the reparametrization of the string
world sheet, and to have a ﬁnite path integral, similar to gauge theories, a gauge for
the metric on the world sheet has to be chosen. The Faddeev–Popov procedure of
gauge ﬁxing, discussed in Section 9.9 for the photon, can be applied to choosing a
gauge for the bosonic string.
The bosonic string theory discussed in this chapter is the quantum mechanics of
an open string since the evolution of only a single string is considered. The ﬁssion
and fusion of strings can be studied using the path integral, and is brieﬂy addressed
later. The analysis of bosonic string quantum mechanics, including arriving at the
critical spacetime dimension of dc = 26, can be carried out exactly using free
quantum ﬁelds deﬁned on the underlying two-dimensional world sheet of the
bosonic string.
One of the most striking features of the quantum mechanics of a single string
is that, unlike classical strings, it is only in certain critical spacetime dimensions
– dc = 26 for bosonic strings and dc = 10 for superstrings – that the theory
is consistent. This is shown in Figure 23.5. The critical dimension is required to
preserve conformal invariance and it has been shown by Polyakov (1987) that the
Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds play a crucial role in determining the critical dimension
of spacetime.

Noteworthy 23.1 Superstring theory
Superstring theory is discussed in many standard texts such as Polchinski (1998) –
which have been written for specialists. These texts are very technical,
extensive and exhaustive – and require a major effort to master. The book by
Zwiebach (2009) is an excellent introductory text on superstrings written for
physics undergraduates.
The mathematics of superstring theory is a natural continuation of quantum ﬁeld
theory. Without introducing any fundamentally new mathematics, one can start to
study the formalism of superstring theory.
In this chapter, the quantum mechanics of the covariant bosonic string is studied
as an example of free quantum ﬁelds in two dimensions. This chapter is meant as
an example of how quantum mathematics can be extended into greater and more
complex domains. String theory illustrates new features of free quantum ﬁelds,
which form one of the cornerstones of superstring theory.
23.3 Nambu–Goto string action
Consider a relativistic point particle of mass m moving in a ﬂat d-dimensional
spacetime with metric ημν = diag(−1, 1, . . . , 1); the trajectory of the particle is
given by Xμ(τ), where τ is some parameter (μ = 1, 2, . . . , d), and is shown in
Figure 23.6. The action S is given by the proper distance covered by the particle in
going from the initial to ﬁnal position, that is,

A string on any space like slice is speciﬁed by the string coordinates Xμ(σ),
where σ is a parameter; as it evolves in time, the string sweeps out a two-
dimensional surface given by coordinates X(σ, τ), as shown in Figure 23.4.
In analogy with the relativistic particle, the Nambu–Goto action is proportional
to the area swept out by the string, and string tension T (with units of energy/length)
is the analog of mass:

The area of the string world sheet is independent of reparametrizations; as shown
in Figure 23.7, a change of coordinates for the world sheet leaves the area of the
string unchanged. The string coordinates Xμ(σ, τ) are vectors in spacetime, but
on the world sheet they are scalars. The action is invariant under inﬁnitesimal
reparametrization transformations that are given by
τ →τ ′ = τ + ξ 0(σ, τ)
(23.3.7)
σ →σ ′ = σ + ξ 1(σ, τ)

The reason that the spacetime coordinates of the bosonic string Xμ(σ, τ) are
invariant under world-sheet reparametrizations is because, as mentioned earlier,
they are world-sheet scalars.
The world sheet can be an arbitrary surface and is described by a Riemannian
metric gαβ(σ, τ); the Polyakov bosonic string action is given by (g = det gαβ)

(23.3.11)
Eliminating gαβ in S using the ﬁeld equation for gαβ yields the Nambu–Goto
action. Although the two actions are equivalent at the classical level, they are quite
different at the quantum level. Most importantly, the Polyakov action can be given
a reparametrization invariant regularization (for example, the Pauli–Villars regular-
ization) that reveals the quantum conformal anomaly of the string action.
Under the reparametrization (diffeomorphism) of the world sheet given by
Eq. 23.3.9, one has, for spacetime index μ and world-sheet indices α, β,
δXμ = Xμ(σ + ξ 1, τ + ξ 0) −Xμ(σ, τ) = ξ α∂αXμ + 0(ξ 2)
(23.3.12)
δgαβ = gαβ(σ + ξ 1, τ + ξ 0) −gαβ(σ, τ) = ∇αξβ + ∇βξα + 0(ξ 2)
(23.3.13)
where
∇αξβ = ∂αξβ + γ
αβξγ
and γ
αβ is the Christoffel connection of the metric gαβ.
The action is invariant under Weyl (conformal) rescalings, namely
δgαβ = λ(σ, τ)gαβ; δXμ = 0

23.4 Covariant quantization

Last, the action is invariant under space time Poincare transformations
δXμ = aν

where aμ
ν and bμ are constant.
In addition to S, the other terms that are reparametrization invariant are
S1 = μ2

dσdτ√g; S2 = λ

dσdτ√gR(2)
where R(2) is the world-sheet Ricci scalar. The action S1 is necessary in spacetime
dimension less than dc, and S2 yields the Euler number for a world sheet of nontriv-
ial topology.

To linearize the constraints, a gauge is chosen for Xμ by singling out two compo-
nents X0 and X1
X± = X0 ± X1;
X+ = p+τ + a
Integrating out X± from the path integral yields a Hamiltonian involving only the
physical degrees of freedom. However, the light-cone formalism is only invariant
under SO(d −2) Lorentz transformations and not manifestly covariant. The lack of
manifest Lorentz covariance poses severe problems in allowing for the ﬁssion and
fusion of strings, which is required for obtaining a ﬁeld theory of strings.
23.4 Covariant quantization
Following Polyakov, the string action is quantized using the Feynman path integral;
let i denote an initial conﬁguration and let f denote the ﬁnal string conﬁguration;
then the amplitude for the transition from i to f is given by

Due to invariance of S under reparametrization, the expression in Eq. 23.4.2 is

23.4.1 Conformal gauge
Choose a gauge for the metric gαβ, with no constraints imposed on Xμ; hence, in this
approach the system is manifestly covariant even after gauge-ﬁxing. The light-like

The path integral can be written as
Z =

(23.4.4)
For conformal ﬁeld φ(σ, τ), the conformal gauge is deﬁned by constraining the
metric to have the following form:
gαβ = eφ(σ,τ)
( −1

)
≡eφηαβ
or equivalently
h++ = 0 = h−−
h+−= −eφ/2
To implement the conformal gauge, the method developed for the Faddeev–
Popov gauge-ﬁxing procedure discussed in Section 9.9 is followed. The symmetry
for strings is reparametrization invariance and a gauge is chosen to render the path
integral ﬁnite. The following counter term needs to be evaluated:

Dξ+Dξ−δ(h++(ξ+))δ(h−−(ξ−))
(23.4.5)
Let δh±±(ξ) be the change in the value of h±±(ξ) after an inﬁnitesimal coordinate
transformation given by Eq. 23.3.9. From Eq. 23.3.12, it can be shown that
δ(h++(ξ)) = ∇+ξ+ = ∂+ξ+ + (∂+φ)ξ+
δ(h−−(ξ)) = ∇−ξ−= ∂−ξ−−(∂−φ)ξ−
(23.4.6)
Changing variables from to ξ± to h++(ξ), h−−(ξ) yields
Dh++(ξ) = det
δ(h++(ξ))

Dξ+ = det ∇+Dξ+
(23.4.7)
Dh−−(ξ) = det
δ(h−−(ξ))
δξ−

Dξ−= det ∇−Dξ−
(23.4.8)
Hence, from Eqs. 23.4.5, 23.4.7 and 23.4.8,

Dξ+Dξ−δ(h++(ξ))δ(h−−(ξ)) = (det ∇+ det ∇−)−1

Dh++Dh−−δ(h++)δ(h−−)
Since

Dh++Dh−−δ(h++)δ(h−−) = 1
one obtains

Dξ+Dξ−δ(h++(ξ))δ(h−−(ξ))

Z =

Dh±±Dh+−DXDξ+Dξ−eiS[h,X](det ∇+ det ∇−)δ(h++(ξ))δ(h−−(ξ))
Doing the inverse transformation h(ξ −1) yields S[h(ξ −1), X] = S[h, X] due to
reparametrization invariance – and similarly for det(∇+) and det(∇−) as they are
reparametrization invariant. Hence the

Dξ−Dξ+ integrations decouple from Z
and yield the gauge-ﬁxed string action [Green et al. (1987)]

23.4.2 Weyl invariance
The variables h++, h−−have been eliminated in Eq. 23.4.10 due to the gauge-
ﬁxing delta functions; only h+−is still coupled to the string coordinates Xμ. At
the classical level, due to Weyl invariance, h+−also decouples from Xμ as can be
readily seen from the action Eq. 23.4.3 evaluated in the conformal gauge.
The Faddeev–Popov Jacobians det(∇+), det(∇−) can be represented using
fermion integration as given in Eq. 9.14.9 and yield
det(∇+) =

23.4.3 String path integral: Conformal gauge
It has been shown by Polyakov that Weyl invariance is broken due to quantum
effects, and that for bosonic strings only in d = 26 spacetime dimensions does
the ﬁrst quantized string become conformally invariant and the conformal ﬁeld
consequently decouples from the string ﬁeld.
Henceforth, only d = 26 is considered. Let
c = c+,
c−= ¯c,
b = b−−,
¯b = b++
The integration Dh+−decouples from the path integral in d = 26 and the conformal
gauge results in
gab = ηab
Hence, from Eqs. 23.3.10 and 23.4.13, the covariant gauge-ﬁxed action is given by
Sgf[X, c, b] = −T

dσdτ∂+Xμ∂−Xμ −1

Eq. 23.4.15 is the sought for result of gauge-ﬁxing and is the form of the string path
integral that is used for the remaining analysis.
To go beyond single string dynamics, according to Polyakov (1987) the ﬁssion
and fusion of strings can be viewed as the world sheet having nontrivial topology,
“handles” for closed strings, speciﬁed by the Euler number, and “holes” for open
strings. Figure 23.8(a) shows a string world sheet with nontrivial topology. The full
action is the S + S2 and the second quantized string ﬁeld theory is given by

where m = (m1, m2, . . .) are the moduli parameters specifying the conformally
inequivalent metrics for a given topology. The summation over all distinct open
string topologies is shown in Figure 23.8(b).
The Faddeev–Popov ghosts b, c, ¯b, ¯c are essential for decoupling the nonphysical
states; their role becomes even more important when fermions are introduced, since,
unlike the case of bosonic degrees of freedom, the ghost ﬁelds are directly involved
in the emission and absorption of fermionic degrees of freedom.

S = −T

dσdτ∂+Xμ∂−Xμ −1


dσdτ(c+∂−b++ + c−∂+b−−)
This classical action, taken together with ﬁeld equations for gαβ, yields the
constraints on the classical string coordinates of vanishing and traceless energy–
momentum tensor; that is, from action given by Eq. 23.3.10, the stress tensor is
given by
Tαβ = −1

or
Tαβ = ∂αX∂βX −1

23.5 Virasoro algebra
643
All further derivations are limited to the case of open strings. The open-string
coordinate is speciﬁed by parameter σϵ[0, π] with X(0, τ) ̸= X(π, τ). To obtain
the ﬁeld equation for X(σ, τ), make a variation X →X + δX and obtain
∂+∂−Xμ(σ, τ) = 0
together with the boundary condition
δX(σ, τ)∂σX(σ, τ)|π
σ=0 = 0
To satisfy the edge condition for the open string, one needs the Neumann boundary
conditions
∂σX(0, τ) = 0 = ∂σX(π, τ)
(23.5.2)
The result of the Neumann conditions is no outﬂow of momentum at the endpoints
of the open string. Hence, from Eq. 23.5.2
Xμ(σ, τ) = Xμ + pμτ + i

which yields
[αμ

12n(n2 −1)δn+m,0
(23.5.5)
where the last term is a c-nunber called central extension and reﬂects the breaking
of Weyl invariance. The operator L0 yields the masses of the string excitations and
in effect is the Hamiltonian; to see this, note that L0 determines the time evolution
of Xμ given by
˙Xμ(σ, τ) = ∂τXμ(σ, τ) = i[Xμ, L0]
The operator expressions for the ghost ﬁelds are now derived. The invariance of the
action Eq. 23.4.14 under the BRST transformation (discussed in Section 23.6) for
the open string requires the boundary conditions
c+(0, τ) = c−(0, τ),
c+(π, τ) = c−(π, τ)
and
b−−(0, τ) = b++(0, τ),
b−−(π, τ) = b++(π, τ)

[Lgh
n , Lgh
m ] = (n −m)Lgh
n+m −13
6 n(n2 −1)δn+m,0
(23.5.8)
Eq. 23.5.8 states that the anomaly due to the ghost ﬁelds is given by −13/6. This
result does not depend on the dimension of the ambient spacetime, but instead is a
result of the world sheet spanned out by the propagating string, and ﬁxes the critical
spacetime dimension for the string.
Hence, from Eqs. 23.5.5 and 23.5.8, the generator of the world-sheet Virasoro
generators is given by
Ln = Ln + Lgh
n
and has the following algebra:
[Ln, Lm] = (n −m)Ln+m + 1
12(d −26)n(n2 −1)δn+m,0
(23.5.9)
Eq. 23.5.8 is the key equation that ﬁxes the spacetime dimension; the reason is
that the anomaly due to the string coordinates is d/26. The only way of canceling
the anomaly and obtaining a consistent theory is to choose d for the cancellation.
Generators Ln have a central extension given by
c = d −26
12
= 0 for d = 26
In d = 26 the bosonic string has the following Virasoro algebra:
[Ln, Lm] = (n −m)Ln+m; d = 26
The vanishing of central extension is required for Weyl conformal invariance,
and this is the reason that a bosonic string is consistent only in d = 26.
23.6 BRST invariance
Although c, b and ¯c, ¯b seem unrelated in the action Eq. 23.4.14, they are connected
via the BRST symmetry transformation; the action is invariant under the BRST

QBRST contains all the information on reparameterization invariance even for the
gauge-ﬁxed action. The physical space of states is obtained using the properties of
QBRST, as was the case for the photon ﬁeld discussed in Section 9.12.
23.7 Physical bosonic state space
To obtain the physical states of the ﬁrst quantized string, the string Hamiltonian
is required together with the constraints on the Hilbert space resulting from
reparametrization and conformal invariance.
In a noncovariant light-cone gauge, the constraints introduced in the path integral
in Eq. 23.3.14 are simply the vanishing of T++ and T−−, which lead to a Hilbert
space with only physical states.
The classical constraints T++ = 0 = T−−on covariant quantization, however,
cannot be taken as operator equations since this would imply all Ln = 0, which is
inconsistent with the Virasoro algebra. Hence, similar to the Gupta–Bleuler covari-
ant formulation of QED discussed in Section 9.12.1, the constraints are expressed
in the covariant quantum theory as the vanishing of the matrix elements of the
energy–momentum tensor operator between any two physical states. The vanishing

23.7 Physical bosonic state space
647
of these matrix elements is just enough to decouple the negative norm states (that
always result in covariant gauge-ﬁxing) from the physical state space. Let ⟨phy| be
a physical state of the string; Eq. 23.5.1 yields
⟨phy|T++|phy⟩′ = 0; ⟨phy|T−−|phy⟩′ = 0
(23.7.1)
Eq. 23.7.1 is implemented by completely ignoring, for now, the ghost ﬁelds.
Eqs. 23.5.3 and 23.7.1 imply that for any physical state |phy⟩
Ln|phy⟩= 0 = ⟨phy|L−n,
n ≥1
(23.7.2)
(L0 −1)|phy⟩= 0
(23.7.3)
Due to ordering ambiguities, L0 is replaced by L0 −α in T++, and α = 1 due
to Lorentz invariance in d = 26 dimensions. It can be shown that if |neg⟩is any
zero or negative norm state, then Eq. 23.7.2 implies that ⟨neg|phy⟩= 0 and hence,
as required by the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, the physical
states are all of positive deﬁnite norm.
The ground state of the string is denoted by |0; k⟩, and is deﬁned by
αμ
n |0; k⟩= 0,
n ≥1
αμ
n |0; k⟩= kμ|0; k⟩
The excited states of the string are given by the Fock basis, discussed in Section 7.3

Bosonic string theory
The ground state of the open string |0; k⟩satisﬁes conditions Eq. 23.7.2 for
M2 = −2; hence, the ground state contains a tachyon.
Consider the ﬁrst excited state ζμ(k)αμ
−1|0; k⟩; for Ln, n > 0 to annihilate this
state requires
ζμkμ = 0
(23.7.5)
which means there are only d −1 independent polarizations for ζμ. The norm of
this state is positive only if
ζμζ μ > 0
(23.7.6)
One of the (d−1) states allowed by Eq. 23.7.5 has null norm for K2 = 0 = M2, and
consequently decouples from the physical subspace. Therefore from Eqs. 23.7.5
and 23.7.6, M2 = 0, and ζμ has only (d −2) polarization states. Hence, the ﬁrst
excited state consists of a massless vector particle having the expected d −2 states
of polarization, and is interpreted as the gauge-ﬁeld quantum of the Yang–Mills
ﬁeld.
In summary the following is the spectrum of open string states:

The analysis of the string spectrum of states can be carried out level by level for
all the higher energy states and is shown to be free of negative norm states. The
analysis for physical states made no reference to the Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds;
a more modern analysis of the spectrum of states uses QBRST to deﬁne the physical
subspace.
Consider an enlarged Hilbert space consisting of string states and ghost ﬁeld
states. A physical state |φ⟩has the string coordinate ﬁeld Xμ decoupled from the
ghosts and hence will, in general, be of the form of a tensor product (similar to the
factorization of the photon and ghost modes in Gupta–Bleuler QED discussed in
Section 9.12.1)
|φ⟩= |phy⟩|⟩gh
where |⟩gh is the ghost vacuum. Since Q2
BRST = 0 for d = 26, two states |φ⟩and

|φ⟩′ = |φ⟩+ QBRST|χ⟩

23.7 Physical bosonic state space
649
The complete set of constraints on |φ⟩due to reparametrization invariance is
expressed by the single equation
QBRST|φ⟩= 0
Note the crucial point that since QBRST is conserved, the condition above is valid
for all time.
In addition to the equation above it is also required that |φ⟩is an eigenstate of the
antihermetian ghost number operator with eigenvalue −1
2, that is,
Ngh|φ⟩= −1

for Lgh
n , due to the ambiguity for the ordering of zero modes c0 and b0, is not
deﬁned by the usual procedure with respect to a vacuum state that is annihilated by
all the annihilation operators; instead, normal ordering is deﬁned with respect to a
SL(2, C) invariant state |0⟩gh that is annihilated by b0; more precisely1

23.8 Summary
The analysis of open superstrings utilizes many ideas from other applications of
quantum ﬁeld theory. Gauge-ﬁxing is an underlying template and leads to BRST
quantization, and results from the study of gauge ﬁelds are adapted to a set of new
problems. Two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theories are also an ongoing theme in
the preliminary studies of string theory.
To remove the troublesome and nonphysical tachyon state, fermionic string
degrees of freedom, also deﬁned on the line on which bosonic string degrees of
freedom are deﬁned, are introduced. The fermion–boson coupling is supersymmet-
ric, and is one of cornerstones of superstring theory. Superstrings have fermionic
and bosonic excitations, accounting for all the fundamental bosons and fermions
that are observed; in particular, superstrings yield a zero mass vacuum state and are
consistent in critical 10-dimensional spacetime
The calculation for open strings can be repeated for closed strings, and the
striking feature of closed strings is the complete decoupling of the left and right
moving modes. To obtain the heterotic string, the left modes are considered as
purely bosonic and moving in 26 dimensions while the right modes are considered
to be supersymmetric and in 10 dimensions. The left-moving bosonic strings are
compactiﬁed to 10 dimensions plus 16 ﬂat (toral) internal dimensions.
Strings are an example of a conformally invariant quantum ﬁeld theory in two
world-sheet dimensional (parameter) space; powerful results from two-dimensional
conformal ﬁeld theory can be fruitfully used in analyzing strings.
Superstrings moving in curved space and compactifying strings from
10-dimensional manifolds to Minkowski (six-dimensional manifold) needs to
be studied for determining the phenomenology of strings. D-branes are deﬁned
as (D+1)-dimensional submanifolds of 10-dimensional spacetime on which the
endpoints of open strings are restricted. The study of D-branes and their connection
with observed phenomenon and possible models of the universe starts with the
analysis of open superstrings. And ﬁnally, there are superstring-like theories,
such as F-theory, deﬁned on 12-dimensional spacetime, and M-theory, deﬁned on
11-dimensional spacetime, that are also deeply related to superstrings.
This brief introduction to open bosonic strings is intended to give a ﬂavor of one
of the frontiers of quantum ﬁeld theory as well as a major domain of theoretical

Futures asset prices*
24.1 Introduction
The statistical theory of asset prices, for both single and multiple assets, has been
discussed in Chapter 6. In this chapter, the model for spot asset prices is extended
to model futures asset prices using a statistical ﬁeld theory of futures asset prices.
The futures asset prices are modeled as a two-dimensional statistical ﬁeld, and
a nonlinear Lagrangian is postulated. Empirical studies for the case of futures
commodity provide clear evidence in support of the model, with many nontrivial
features of the model ﬁnding unexpected support from market data. This chapter is
based largely on the results obtained by Baaquie and Yu (2018).
The study of futures asset prices is fundamental to microeconomics and to the
theory of asset pricing. Studies of forecasting commodity futures from the point
of view of economics and ﬁnance have been carried out in Cargill and Rausser
(1975) and Tomek (1997); the dynamics of futures commodity prices has been
studied by Smith (2005) and Pindyck (2001); and the effect of ﬁnancialization on
the commodities markets has been studied by Irwin and Sanders (2011).
Futures asset prices are modeled by generalizing earlier work in studying the
spot asset prices discussed in Chapter 6 [Baaquie (2013a); Baaquie et al. (2015,
2016)]. The model is calibrated and tested using daily data for commodity futures
prices, as these prices are readily available and are an extension of the study of spot
prices in Chapter 6.
The futures asset price, denoted by p(t, ξ), is a futures contract for the price of
an asset, locked in at present calendar time t, for buying or selling the said asset at
a future time, denoted by ξ > t – at which date in the future the contract matures.
At future time ξ, the buyer of the contract makes the payment and takes delivery
of the asset. The traders can either buy (long) or sell (short) the contract before the
contract matures at time ξ. A seller of an asset will short the futures price, whereas a
consumer of the commodity will go long on the futures contract. Exchange-traded
651

Futures asset prices
futures contracts are standard, with each contract clearly specifying the quantity,
quality, delivery location and delivery time for each commodity. Exchange-traded
futures contracts require margin calls.
The futures asset price depends on the price of the underlying commodity, and
hence a futures contract is a derivative product. Spot asset prices rarely come into
play in the commodities market since only if one is taking actual delivery of a
commodity does one pay the spot price. Instead, almost all sellers and buyers of
commodities enter into a futures contract. The futures commodity contracts are
fungible and can be traded; nearly 80% of all futures contracts do not result in the
actual delivery of the said commodity, since long and short positions can be offset.
In many cases, buyers and sellers settle the ﬁnal contract outside the commodities
futures exchange – for greater ﬂexibility regarding the schedule and port of delivery,
and other legal aspects of the futures contract.
Futures contracts are used largely for hedging by the sellers and buyers of com-
modities and other assets; the reason is that for a future delivery date, both the seller
and buyer are faced with possible large changes in the futures price; the holder of
the futures contract can sell off an unfavorable contract and reenter into a fresh
futures contract later on. Speculators are also in the market who only buy and sell
the futures contract and do not buy or sell the actual commodity; but speculators
provide market liquidity, since they buy and sell futures contracts that are being
offered by real sellers and buyers. In fact, it can be safely stated that the main role
of the futures prices and futures market is to provide a hedge for the sellers and
buyers of commodities.1
24.2 Modeling futures asset prices
The market price pi(t) of an asset, labeled by i, called the spot price, for calendar
time t, is given by2
pi(t) = p0exi(t)
The normalized spot asset prices are given by Eq. 6.3.2 as follows:
yi(t) = xi(t) −¯xi
σi
(24.2.1)
The multiple spot prices Lagrangian is deﬁned in terms of the normalized multi-
ple asset prices and given by Eq. 6.3.8 as follows:
1 I thank Brian Miller for valuable discussions on the functioning of the futures markets.
2 Note that prices for all assets, as shown in Eq. 6.2.1, are expressed in pure dollar terms, with no reference to the
underlying measure of quantity that the price of a commodity refers to.

Market futures asset prices pi(t, ξ), labeled by i – for calendar time t and future
time ξ – are given by
pi(t, ξ) = p0exi(t,ξ)
The calendar and future time coordinates of spot and futures asset prices are
shown in Figure 24.1. Similar to Eq. 24.2.1, the normalized variables for the futures
asset prices are deﬁned by
yi(t, ξ) = xi(t, ξ) −¯xi(t, t)

(24.2.3)
The normalized futures asset price is given by
ξ ≥t: yi(t, ξ): Futures price
The normalized spot asset price is given by
yi(t) = yi(t, t): Spot price
The spot Lagrangian, given in Eq. 24.2.2, needs to be generalized to a Lagrangian
that is valid for futures asset prices. One needs to add new terms to the spot
Lagrangian that attenuate the ﬂuctuations in the ξ-direction. A symmetric gen-
eralization of the multiple spot prices Lagrangian is given by [Baaquie and Yu
(2018)]

(24.2.4)
The futures Lagrangian has new terms ∂2yi/∂ξ 2, ∂yi/∂ξ that are purely “kinetic”
in the sense that they attenuate and dampen out ﬂuctuations in the future time
ξ-direction. The higher derivative term ∂2yi/∂ξ 2 has been included as it is sim-
ilar to the acceleration term ∂2yi/∂t2 that is the deﬁning feature of the applica-
tions of quantum mathematics to ﬁnance and economics. The Lagrangian given in
Eq. 24.2.4 is mathematically equivalent to a two-dimensional nonlinear Euclidean
quantum ﬁeld theory.
The microeconomic potential – containing the supply and demand terms as well
as the correlation term ij – is extended into the future direction. The parameters
ij continue to be constant real numbers – independent of future and calendar time.
Higher derivative ﬁeld theory actions, similar to Eq. 24.2.4 but in four spacetime
dimensions, have been applied to the study of cosmology, quantum and conformal
gravity by Mannheim (2011a,b). The Euclidean model was studied by Hawking and
Hertog (2002) in four-dimensional spacetime for its role in quantum gravity and
D-brane dynamics; the Euclidean path integral was used by Fontanini and Trodden
(2011) for analyzing the ghost states for Minkowski time.
The present time is taken to be t = 0; the value of the futures price at present
time yi(0, ξ) is ﬁxed by the market. On the semi-inﬁnite plane with a boundary at
ξ = t, as shown in Figure 24.1, the action is
S =
 ∞

 ∞

The spot asset prices yi(t, t) on the boundary are random variables since the
values of the future spot prices are not known at the present time. Hence, the futures
asset prices must obey the Neumann boundary condition given by
∂yi(t, ξ)

(24.2.7)
The path integral in Eq. 24.2.7 shows that futures prices are modeled by yi(t, ξ),
which are nonlinear two-dimensional statistical ﬁelds. Due to the higher derivatives
in the Lagrangian the quantum ﬁeld theory is completely ﬁnite, with no divergent
Feynman diagrams.
24.3 Gaussian approximation
The ﬁrst step in studying a nonlinear quantum ﬁeld is usually to linearize the
Lagrangian by keeping only the quadratic terms, and study it as a Gaussian (free)
quantum ﬁeld. To simplify the discussion, consider a single asset having small-
value ﬂuctuations of y(t, ξ) and expand the Lagrangian given in Eq. 24.2.4 as a
power series in y(t, ξ).
As in the case of single assets, for having the minimum of the microeconomic
potential at y(t, ξ) = 0, the following condition is chosen:
ad = bs
The Gaussian quantum ﬁeld, after integration by parts using the Neumann boundary
condition, has the following Lagrangian – given in terms of parameters L, γ1, γ2:

˜L
L; γ 2
1 γ 2
2 = a2d + b2s
The Lagrangian has three branches: real, complex and critical [Baaquie (2014)].
For convergence of the path integral, all branches require L > 0 and a2d + b2s > 0.
The modeling of single and multiple assets is described by the complex branch,
which requires complex γ1, γ2 [Baaquie et al. (2015, 2016)]. Since a2d + b2s > 0,
this imposes the condition that γ1, γ2 are a complex conjugate pair.
Hence, for the complex branch
γ1 = reiφ; γ2 = re−iφ
⇒2r2 cos(2φ) =
˜L
L
˜L can be negative or positive for the complex branch and yields
−1 < cos(2φ) < +1 ⇒
−π
2 < φ < +π
2

656
Futures asset prices
The strict inequality – that | cos(2φ)| < 1 – comes from the requirement that L is
ﬁnite, as given in Eq. 24.5.4.
The Gaussian approximation yields a quadratic action S given in Eq. 24.3.1.
The supply and demand, via the microeconomic potential, yield only a single term
in the action, which is Lγ 2
1 γ 2
2 y2/2; all the remaining terms arise from the kinetic
(derivative) terms, required for dampening rapid ﬂuctuations in the direction of
calendar time t and future time ξ.
However, the term Lγ 2
1 γ 2
2 y2/2 is crucial for stabilizing the path integral; without
this term, the path integral given by Eq. 24.2.7 is divergent. This divergence can be
seen clearly in the calculation of the Gaussian propagator, given in Section 24.5.3,
which is divergent for γ 2
1 = 0 = γ 2
2 .
The semi-inﬁnite domain over which y(t, ξ) is deﬁned, together with the
Neumann boundary condition given in Eq. 24.2.5, yields the following Fourier
expansion:

1 )(ω2 + α2k2 + γ 2

The factorization of −1(ω, k) given in Eq. 24.3.3 determined the choice made in
Eq. 24.2.4 for the extension of the spot Lagrangian into the futures direction.

24.4.1 Market time
The concept of market time [Baaquie and Bouchaud (2004); Baaquie (2010)] is
fundamental for mapping the model’s propagators to empirically determined corre-
lation functions. Traders operate in the market based on their subjective perception
of time, and this fact is captured by the idea of market time. Both calendar and
future time are modiﬁed by the concept of market time; in all propagators and
correlation functions in general, the following replacement is made:
z± →m(z±) = λ
z±
λ
η
(24.4.10)
where the function m(x) is market time. The connection of the empirical propagator
GE(z+; z−) to the model’s propagator is given by
GE(z+; z−) = G(m(z+); m(z−))
(24.4.11)
In ﬁtting the model’s correlators to the empirical correlators, the substitution
given in Eq. 24.4.11 is always made. To keep the notation simple, the variables t, ξ
continue to be used everywhere – keeping in mind that all ﬁts are made with market
time replacing all calendar and future time variables that appear in the model’s
propagators.

24.5 Propagator for spot asset prices
The spot prices y(t, t) provide a model for asset prices that is distinct from the spot
rate model discussed in Chapter 6. Calibration shows that both the models provide
a fairly accurate representation of commodity spot prices correlation functions. For
spot prices, from Eq. 24.4.6, we have
ξ = t; ξ ′ = t′
⇒z+ = z−= τ
Hence, from Eqs. 24.4.1 and 24.4.7, the spot prices propagator is given by

This is a noteworthy result as it shows that all three quantities, namely L, α, γ 2,
have to be nonzero for the path integral to converge. These are the coefﬁcients of
the three distinct types of terms in the Lagrangian, and all three coefﬁcients are
required to be positive for the path integral to be ﬁnite.
Consider imposing the constraint G(0, 0) = 1 on the path integral; then Eq.
24.5.7 and above yields
lim
γ →0 G(0, 0) = 1
In other words, once one imposes the normalization G(0, 0) = 1, the dependent
parameter ensures that the path integral will always converge and in doing so main-
tains the constraint to be G(0, 0) = 1. In particular, note that
G(0, 0) = 1 ⇒2πLαγ 2 = 1 ⇒L, α, γ 2 > 0
24.6 Contour map of G(t, ξ; 0, 0)
The value of G(t, ξ; 0, 0) for three different values of α is shown in Figure 24.3.

α is a dimensionless pure number, and the numerical value of α determines how
important future time is in the behavior of the correlation of futures prices. This is
because it is the ratio (θ ± θ′)/α that determines the contribution of future time to
the propagator. The value of α does not affect the spot rate correlation functions
and for this reason the calibration is insensitive to the value of α. The value of α

cannot be set to zero for spot rate correlations since, from Eq. 24.5.4, this would
lead to a singular limit for the propagator.
• α = 1: Figure 24.3(a) shows that the value of G(t, ξ; 0, 0) is constant for equal
distance in future time and calendar time, which implies futures prices affect the
spot price for an equal length of time for a given future calendar time.
• α > 1: Figure 24.3(b) shows that the values of G(t, ξ; 0, 0) for future time greater
than calendar time have the same values, from which one can conclude futures
prices affect the spot prices for a given future calendar time of shorter duration
than future time.
• α < 1: Figure 24.3(c) shows that future time smaller than calendar time affects
the spot prices for a given future calendar time.
A small value of α increases the contribution of near future time to the correlation
at future calendar time, and a large value of α requires a large future time to affect
future calendar time.
Consider the following example, discussed later in Section 24.11. Data of daily
futures price of crude oil are given until 10 years into the future and yield 10 data
points; these are in turn splined into 50 points. The analysis in Section 24.11 shows
that α = 20 is the best value for this case, which implies that future time becomes
important for spot prices after four years.
From the study of the contour map of G(t, ξ; 0, 0) and empirical results for α,
one can conclude that it is primarily the spot rates – reﬂected in the τ term in z± –
that determine the behavior of futures prices in the near future. It is only far into the
future, from about three years onward, that the dynamics of futures prices comes
into play.
24.7 Spot-spot rate G(t, t; t′, t′): Empirical and model
The spot-spot rate correlation function G(t, t; t′, t′) provides a model distinct from
the one discussed in depth in Chapter 6. One could consider the limit of α →0 and

The limit of α →0 is ruled out since it is a singular limit of the futures
Lagrangian and yields divergent results.
In effect, there are two distinct models for the spot rates; both models have their
own advantages.
• The spot rate given by Eq. 6.3.8 is useful for studying the correlation of the spot
rates of multiple assets. The futures prices Lagrangian is not very useful for this
case as it is computationally intensive and introduces large errors for multiple
assets.
• The futures model given by Lagrangian in Eq. 24.2.4 is the appropriate model
for studying spot asset prices in conjunction with futures asset prices. The model
gives a consistent model of all prices, both spot and futures, and this is required
for the model to be applied to market data.
The single commodity spot market prices are used for ﬁtting the model’s spot
propagator G(t, t; t′, t′) – given in Eq. 24.5.1 – to the empirical propagator. The
ﬁtting is at the boundary of futures price, as in Figure 24.1; both γ1, γ2 are complex.
For all cases, the model predicts the shape of the correlation function for over a few
hundred days of lag time – based on only four parameters.
Some typical ﬁts are shown in Figure 24.4: The correlation from data has an
irregular shape, whereas the smooth lines are the model’s ﬁt and prediction. From
Figure 24.4(a) and (b) it is seen that the pattern at the boundary for commodities

like gold and soybeans can be ﬁt almost perfectly, with R2 = 0.971 and 0.976,
respectively. When the shape has a deep valley, as in the case of corn data as shown
in Figure 24.4(c), the model cannot ﬁt such a deep minimum and the best ﬁt can
only give R2 = 0.608.
More recent data for crude oil, given in Figure 24.5, show that for different
regimes of time, the model ﬁts market spot prices quite well (R2 = 0.93).
24.8 Spot-futures G(t, ξ; 0, 0): Empirical and model
The propagator G(t, ξ; 0, 0) measures the correlation of the spot and futures com-
modities prices. This is the ﬁrst measure of how well the futures Lagrangian can
model the behavior of the futures asset prices.
The ﬁt of the correlation – determined from market data – of the spot and futures
prices for the corn is very accurate and yields R2=0.96. Figure 24.6(a) shows the
market correlation of the spot price of corn with its forward price G(t, ξ; 0, 0) with
the model’s propagator given in Figure 24.6(b). Similarly, Figures 24.7(a) and (b)
and 24.8(a) and (b) show excellent ﬁts of market data with the model of crude oil
and rice for the correlation between spot and futures prices, with R2 = 0.93 and
0.98, respectively.
The case of gold, shown in Figure 24.9, is included to illustrate the fact that
the model cannot ﬁt the prices of all commodities. Due to the highly irreg-
ular shape of the correlation between gold spot and futures, the ﬁt fails with
R2 = 0.41.
The results of the ﬁts for spot and futures prices are shown in Table 24.1.

24.9 Algorithm for empirical GE(z+, z−)
The propagator GE(z+, z−) is the correlation for futures-futures asset prices, with
z+, z−shown in Figure 24.1. This correlation is the test of the full content of
the futures Lagrangian and is also the most complicated case. The propagator is
empirically evaluated from market data and then matched with the model.
Matching model with the market data both calibrates the model’s parameters as
well as tests the accuracy of the model. The main features of the algorithm for
evaluating and calibrating GE(z+, z−) are summarized below.

• The propagator
G(t, ξ; t′, ξ ′)
(24.9.1)
in general depends on four variables, given by t, ξ; t′, ξ ′.

668
Futures asset prices
• The symmetry of the model yields the result
G(t, ξ; t′, ξ ′) = D(t −t′, ξ −t, ξ ′ −t′)
(24.9.2)
This shows that the model’s propagator depends on only three variables, given by
t −t′, x −t, x′ −t′. This feature of the model is used for evaluating the empirical
propagator.
• The model further requires the following:
D(t −t′, ξ −t, ξ ′ −t′) = G(z+, z−)
(24.9.3)
In other words, the model’s propagator depends on only two variables.
The evaluation and calibration of the empirical propagator is based on an algorithm
that reduces the dependence of the empirical propagator from four variables to two
variables.
The market data of the futures commodity prices y(t, ξ) are interpreted as the
outcome of sampling stochastic futures prices. A basic assumption of statistical
theory of prices is that the expectation value of stochastic prices is equal to the
historical average of the futures prices. To perform the average over historical data,
note from Eq. 24.9.2 that the model propagator G(t, ξ; t′, ξ ′) depends only on three
variables since for constant z
G(t, ξ; t′, ξ ′) = G(t + z, ξ + z; t′ + z, ξ ′ + z): Invariant under time translations
(24.9.4)
Invariance under time translation is a reﬂection of the assumption that there is no
special instant of time for the model. Of the four variables t, ξ; t′, ξ ′, one is auxiliary;
in Eq. 24.9.4 let the auxiliary variable be z = −t, which yields
D(a, b, c) = D(t −t′, ξ −t, ξ ′ −t′) ≡G(0, t −t′, ξ −t, ξ ′ −t′)
(24.9.5)
In Eq. 24.9.5, the following choice of variables (for future convenience) is made:
ξ −t = b; t′ −t = −a; ξ ′ −t = c −a
⇒ξ = b + t; t′ = t −a; ξ ′ = t + c −a
(24.9.6)
The three variables labeled a, b, c yield D(a, b, c), which is given by the following:
D(a, b, c) = G(t, b + t, t −a, c −a + t) = G(t, ξ; t′, ξ ′)
(24.9.7)
Eq. 24.9.7 is the theoretical basis of connecting the model with data. Since D(a, b, c)
does not depend on t, the variable t is taken to be an index labeling the random
samples of the propagator D(a, b, c).
The empirical propagator, denoted by DE(a, b, c), is deﬁned by summing over the
random samples in the following manner. Discretize t →tn = nϵ, and let ϵ = 0.2

years. Then the expectation value required for evaluating the empirical propagator
is given by

The empirical analysis is carried out using a ﬁnite sample size, and N = 200 days
is chosen for commodity data.
From Eq. 24.9.3, the propagator has a further reduction in the number of inde-
pendent variables, from
a, b, c →z+, z−

(24.9.9)
A major test for the viability of the model is whether data supports the reduction
in the dependence of the underlying coordinates from a, b, c →z+, z−.
A key link in the mapping from DE(a, b, c) to GE(z+, z−) is that the propagator
DE(a, b, c) is binned into a matrix with coordinates (z+, z−) for all points (a, b, c)
giving the same value of z+, z−. The mapping of points (a, b, c) to z+, z−is a
mapping of many points to one.
In the model for futures asset prices, for all points (a, b, c) that are mapped into
(z+, z−), the propagator DE(a, b, c) should approximately have the same value, and
yield a sample value of GE(z+, z−).
No model has so far been assumed for the empirical propagator DE(a, b, c).
Consider the three-dimensional parameter space E3 = (a, b, c). The parametric
equation for a surface
z+ = A; z−= B; A, B > 0
(24.9.10)
deﬁnes a two-dimensional surface S(A, B) inside E3. One expects that the appro-
priate choice for quantity α should lead to DE(a, b, c) = GE(z+, z−): a constant
on the surface S(A, B); changing A, B changes the surface, and in turn DE(a, b, c)
has another numerical value. The behavior of DE(a, b, c) being constant on surfaces
S(A, B), for the appropriate choice of α, would indicate that market data have a
pattern that is required and predicted by the model.

Each point a, b, c is mapped to a unique bin, labeled by [z+, z−]. The samples of
DE(a, b, c), obtained by varying a, b, c, are denoted by

The number of samples depends on the bin and yields K = K(z+, z−). The average
value is taken of all the sample values D(k)
E (a, b, c) that are collected in a given bin.
The average is taken to be equal to empirical GE(z+, z−). More precisely,

The optimum value of α is recursively chosen, together with γ1, γ2, for which

To ﬁnd the best ﬁt, the program has to run through many values of γ1, γ2, λ, η. For
each choice of γ1, γ2, λ, η, the entire binning process has to be repeated to ﬁnd the
best α. This is the reason that the algorithm is very slow, making the algorithm com-
putationally very intensive: The binning of the propagator D(k)
E (a, b, c) requires the
mapping of a three-dimensional parameter space, speciﬁed by a, b, c, to coordinates
z±, and which forms a two-dimensional subspace. The expectation from the model
is that the values of D(k)
E (a, b, c) are approximately constant on this subspace.

E (a, b, c)
Figure 24.10(a) shows the binning of D(k)
E (a, b, c) for a ﬁxed value of z+, z−;
the value of α=19.98 gives the best ﬁt of empirical GE(z+; z−) with the model’s
G(z+; z−); recall from Eq. 24.9.11 that k stands for the different sample values
of D(k)
E (a, b, c) in a bin, which is labeled by z+, z−. The values of D(k)
E (a, b, c) are
randomly distributed about its mean value in the bin; this is what one expects since
ideally all the D(k)
E (a, b, c) differ from the expected value D(a, b, c) due to random
errors and due to some outlying data points. The identiﬁcation of D(k)
E (a, b, c)
with G(k)
E (z+; z−) made in Eq. 24.9.11 is valid only if all the D(k)
E (a, b, c)s are
approximately equal.

2015, to September 8, 2016). Figure from Baaquie and Yu (2018).
Figure 24.10(b) is the binning of the same data, but with α = 1. In contrast
to the case of α=19.98, the binning of D(k)
E (a, b, c) for α=1 does not yield values
that lie randomly above and below the expected mean value. Instead, the values of
D(k)
E (a, b, c) tend to cluster and bunch up – either above the mean value, near 1.0,
or below the mean value, near 0.1. The clustering of data points for α=1 reﬂects the
fact that D(k)
E (a, b, c) is not equal to sample values of empirical G(k)
E (z+; z−), which
in turn implies that an average value of D(k)
E (a, b, c) in the same bin would not be an
accurate representation of GE(z+; z−). It is for this reason that the proposed model,
for an arbitrary value of α such as α = 1, cannot ﬁt the result obtained by binning
D(k)
E (a, b, c).
It is a rather unexpected empirical result – and one that is necessary for success-
fully describing futures prices by the proposed model – that for a unique choice of
α = 19.98 the mapping of (a, b, c) to the same value of z+, z−yields sample values
D(k)
E (a, b, c), for k = 1, 2, . . . , K that are approximately equal.
The negative result obtained by binning D(k)
E (a, b, c) for α = 1 provides a model-
independent test of the validity of the speciﬁc Lagrangian chosen in this chapter. By
choosing an arbitrary α and evaluating the value of the propagators for ﬁxed values
of (z+, z−), Figure 24.10(b) shows that for an arbitrary α the values of D(k)
E (a, b, c)
do not show the reduction of the number of variables from a, b, c to (z+, z−): The
values of D(k)
E (a, b, c) are not approximately equal.
One can do a model-independent variation of α to determine the optimum α for
which the binning from a, b, c to (z+, z−) effectively results in a D(k)
E (a, b, c) that
is approximately a constant; in this case, an optimum α would be a completely
model-independent result. It is of course the expectation from the model that the

model-independent result for optimum α would be close to the one obtained from
the model.
In summary, Figure 24.10(a) provides reasonable evidence that there is a unique
α for which the binning yields an approximately constant value for DE(a, b, c) on
surface S(A, B) discussed after Eq. 24.9.10; hence, one can conclude that there
exists a parameter α that encodes an inherent and model-independent property of
the market’s behavior. The choice of α = 19.98 is guided by the requirement of
obtaining the best ﬁt of the empirical propagator with the model’s propagator.
24.11 Empirical results for GE(z+; z−)
The value of GE(z+; z−) for different values of z+, z−is shown in Figure 24.11(a),
with the best ﬁt for the model’s G(z+; z−) shown in Figure 24.11(b). Given the
complexity of the ﬁt, a value of R2 = 0.695 is reasonable. A computationally
intensive study needs to be carried out for determining GE(z+; z−) more accurately.
The results of the calibration and ﬁtting of the model are summarized in
Table 24.2. The results differ from the earlier results given in Table 24.1 since
a different and more recent data set is used. The calibration of the model has
three distinct sources, namely the correlation function for (1) spot-spot prices,
(2) spot-futures prices and (3) futures-futures prices.
• Calibration using the spot-spot correlation function yields values consistent with
the results given in Table 24.1. The value of α is approximately 1 since it does
not appear in the spot-spot propagator G(t, t; t′, t′).
• The spot-future results for oil are also similar to the one obtained in Table 24.1.
The value of α is approximately 10.

• The value of L for the results given in Tables 24.1 and 24.2 are very different, by
a factor of over 104 for spot-spot and spot-futures results. It is not clear why the
values of L should differ so much. Tables 24.1 and 24.2 refer to two different
periods of time, January 1 to October 18, 2011, and November 20, 2015, to
September 8, 2016, respectively. It is unlikely that the value of L has changed
so dramatically due to the different periods used for the calibration.
• The value of α = 19.98 is highest for the futures-futures case, as can be seen from
Table 24.2. The reason, from the discussion in Section 24.6, is that the highest
contributions to the propagator are only for futures prices that are far in the future.
24.12 Summary
The empirical study of futures prices provides evidence for the suitability of mod-
eling futures prices based on a two-dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory.
The ﬁt of the model of the correlation function of spot prices, for all cases except
corn, is over 95% accuracy (going by the R2 score). The ﬁt of the correlation of
the spot to the futures prices, except for gold, is also accurate to over 93%. The
correlation of futures prices for two different future times, however, is good to
only 70%. This lower accuracy does not necessarily mean that the model cannot
deliver an accuracy of over 90% for this case. The computing power required for
studying the correlation of futures-futures prices is far higher than what is available
in a laptop. To fully test the model, one needs to study the futures-futures prices
correlation function using a supercomputer; only then can the full accuracy of the
model be gauged.
A two-dimensional Euclidean quantum ﬁeld has been applied in Baaquie (2004,
2010) to the modeling of forward interest rates f(t, ξ). The quantum ﬁeld theory
of forward interest rates – by a change of variables – leads to decoupling of the
inﬁnite degrees of freedom in the time direction, and results in a system with a
ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom [Baaquie (2004)].
For example, the decoupling in time can be done by going from a forward
interest rates quantum ﬁeld f(t, ξ) to a two-dimensional quantum ﬁeld A(t, ξ) by
the following change of variables:

674
Futures asset prices
∂f(t, ξ)
∂t
= β(t, ξ) + σ(t, ξ)A(t, ξ)
where β(t, ξ), σ(t, ξ) are deterministic functions [Baaquie (2010)]. The quantum
ﬁeld A(t, ξ) is decoupled in the time direction t and the action functional is effec-
tively many copies (labeled by t) of a quantum mechanical system, with role of
“time” being played by ξ.
If one moves from the path integral to the Hamiltonian, the degree of freedom
is f(t, ξ) and the inﬁnitely many coupled degrees of freedom cannot be decoupled.
But if one is interested in only the correlation functions of f(t, ξ), then these are
evaluated using the path integral and the system is effectively quantum mechanical.
In contrast, the model for futures asset prices is an irreducible two-dimensional
nonlinear quantum ﬁeld. Due to k−4 term in the propagator arising from the high
order derivatives in the action functional, this theory is completely ﬁnite. There
is no need for the procedure of renormalization, which is necessary for obtaining
ﬁnite results from nonlinear quantum ﬁelds without the higher derivative term.
Many questions remain, including studying the nonlinear terms of the model that
are required for determining the potential of the assets that yield the futures prices.
Another open question is the coupling of the futures prices of different assets – and
the calibration and empirical tests for these models.

24.14 Algorithm: Binning the propagator
The three independent variables a, b, c have a many-to-one mapping into the coordi-
nates z+, z−, which is referred to as a bin. The algorithm that reduces three variables
to two for the correlation function D(a, b, c) and yields the propagator GE(z+, z−)
is given below.
The main innovation is that there are no conditional statements to determine
which bin the variables a, b, c belong to; such conditional statements slow down
the program and make it ineffective. Rather, the algorithm runs through all the
values of a, b, c – and for each speciﬁc value of the parameters determines
which bin they belong to. The correlation function D(a, b, c) is then mapped
into GE(z+, z−, M(z+, z−)), and the counter M(z+, z−) keeps track of the number of
different values of the various D(a, b, c)s that are mapped into the z+, z−bin.
The value of α is varied so that all the D(a, b, c)s for a given bin z+, z−have
approximately the same value – and there is no trend away from an average value.
The model predicts that, for a large sample, all the different D(a, b, c)s in a given
bin z+, z−should be approximately equal. The futures data is studied to see if, in
fact, data behave as expected from the model. Using moderate computing power,
the empirical study seems to indicate that the model’s prediction is validated by the
futures prices for oil [Baaquie and Yu (2018)].

Epilogue
Quantum ﬁeld theory is a leading mathematical construct of science that encom-
passes myriad domains of knowledge as well as illuminates the path to new discov-
eries. Quantum ﬁeld theory is at the apex of modern mathematics, synthesizing and
incorporating almost all the advances made in mathematics, and itself contributing
to the fundamentals of mathematics. Its varied and labyrinthine structure ranges
from leading edge mathematics to the almost endless variety of quantum phenom-
ena that are only comprehensible within its framework. Pathways connecting it to
different disciplines are encoded in the vast and complex ediﬁce of quantum ﬁeld
theory and are waiting to be discovered.
All the concepts of quantum ﬁeld theory are geared toward the description and
explanation of indeterminate and random phenomena, be they classical or quantum
in origin.
Quantum ﬁeld theory has achieved singular success in explaining both the
elementary particles of nature as well as the fundamental interactions – barring
gravity – based on a variety of quantum ﬁelds. The fundamental quantum ﬁelds of
nature permeate all of spacetime, and provide predictions of unparalleled accuracy
and originality. Quantum ﬁeld theory has transcended the bounds of theoretical
physics due to its numerous triumphs – resulting in researchers from diverse ﬁelds
becoming familiar with its workings. This has led to developments, over the last
few decades, that have made it clear that quantum ﬁeld theory is not a discipline-
speciﬁc construct but, instead, has universal applicability.
To illustrate the application of quantum ﬁeld theory to domains beyond quantum
physics, a case in point is the results obtained by Witten (1989) for the classi-
ﬁcation of knots and links. The results are topological in nature and, a priori,
there seems to be nothing indeterminate about the classiﬁcation of knots and
links.
677

678
Epilogue
Noteworthy 25.1 Witten and knot theory
Witten deﬁnes knots and links by (the product of) entangled Wilson loops,1 which
are the exponential of line integrals of a gauge ﬁeld. The action functional for
the gauge ﬁeld is chosen to be the Chern–Simons Lagrangian deﬁned for three-
dimensional (Euclidean) manifolds. Both the Wilson loop and the Chern–Simons
action functional are independent of the geometry (metric) of the underlying mani-
fold – and hence deﬁne a topological quantum ﬁeld theory.
The expectation value of the Wilson loop is evaluated by performing the
Feynman path integral. The result that one obtains is a topological quantity –
with a special case being the Jones polynomial, which provides a classiﬁcation of
knots and links. Why should the expectation value of a stochastic quantity, such
as the Wilson loop, generate the Jones polynomial? Intuitively, this is because the
gauge ﬁeld carries information about the topology of the Wilson loops: The path
integral entails summing over all possible values of the gauge ﬁeld, and in doing
so “removes” all geometrical information of the Wilson loop and picks up only its
topological structure. What is nontrivial, and in some sense inexplicable, is that
the Chern-Simons action functional is precisely the one required for the probability
density of different gauge ﬁeld conﬁgurations in the knot theory’s path integral.
As mentioned earlier, there seems to be no obvious reason why quantum ﬁeld
theory should provide a solution to the description of knots and links. Witten’s
example shows that ﬁeld theorists straddling many subjects can connect the con-
structs of quantum ﬁeld theory to other specialized domains of inquiry. In general,
one can draw similarities and metaphors between quantum ﬁeld theory and other
disciplines. One way to proceed is to try and frame the key theoretical constructs
of a discipline, such as those from the social sciences, in terms of the analogs of
Hamiltonians, Lagrangians and path integrals. For empirically grounded subjects
such as ﬁnance, one needs to stay close to data for model-building and validation.
Connecting quantum ﬁeld theory to nonempirical disciplines, such as mathematics,
requires discipline-speciﬁc criteria for validation.
In this book, quantum ﬁeld theory was analyzed from two points of view,
both as a mathematical structure that is complete by itself and as a theoretical
tool for explaining and describing subjects that arise in economics and ﬁnance.
The applications of quantum ﬁeld theory to economics and ﬁnance are at an
early stage: of the vast array of quantum ﬁelds, only nonlinear scalar ﬁelds have
been used, with the rest of its mathematical structure – involving, for example,
(coupled) scalar, vector and spinor ﬁelds – having yet to ﬁnd any application.
1 Wilson loops are discussed in Section 22.6.

Epilogue
679
Furthermore, the applications discussed in this book are not based on any fun-
damental principles but, instead, are the result of Lagrangians that have been
postulated. For this reason, the applications discussed are based on models that can
be empirically tested – since there is no basis, except empirical, to conclude that
these models reﬂect the phenomena being studied.
The application of quantum ﬁeld theory to economics and ﬁnance will reach a
higher level of clarity and intelligibility when one can ﬁnd underlying principles
that lead economics and ﬁnance to the mathematical framework of quantum ﬁeld
theory. These principles have not yet been found. There is a need for fundamentally
new ideas that will ground – on principles that are clear and self-evident –the
application of quantum ﬁeld theory to economics and ﬁnance.
